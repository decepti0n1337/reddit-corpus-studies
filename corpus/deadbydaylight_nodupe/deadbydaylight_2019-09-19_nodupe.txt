I see this a lot in DBD and it really makes me laugh sometimes, I think the fact that both sides often thing something is unbalanced in the other side‚Äôs favour probably means it‚Äôs more balanced than they want to admit

*Finds and downs someone in the first 40-50 seconds of a game, hooks them, goes off to look for other survivors. 10 seconds later, two gens pop.*

Lol, you're just not good enough.

Time to make my friend salty cause he thinks demegorgen is op

He needs tweaking he has the potential to be powerful but shred need to break pallets without add-on

Perfect flair. Same friend, same.

Wait you get the mask for owning death garden? Why dont I have my mask then :(
---
If your first post was 
---
&gt;	My input is the perks are fine, you just need to learn how to utilize them
---
Then I would haven‚Äôt replied how I did, your first post in no way conveys what you said here. 
---
It might be true, however when compared with the survivor perks, in which you don‚Äôt have to do anything different to a normal game, you can see why I think the demogorgan perks are lacking. Sure they might be good in certain situations but there are so much better alternatives that they might as well not even exist. I don‚Äôt see why I would choose surge over ruin or pop, or cruel limits over bamboozle, or mindbreaker over literally any other perk.

THIS IS WHAT PARENTING IS LIKE! BE PROUD YOU CARRIED DWEETS HIGH!

&gt;sadly he's mid tier
---
What's wrong with that? Mid tier is good..
---
Yes it increases its range ? Or yes it‚Äôs a fixed range ?
---
I love this a lot
---
Because I wanted a huge hulking best to be a decent killer,
---
[removed]
---
Yeah, but spine chill kinda help me be the gen jock, so I use it to not confront the killer
---
Yep just got off work too. Boutta eat some faces soon
---
Every killer is viable at high ranks. I see plenty of low tier killers at rank 1
---
Got matches like this literally all day. Killer was always way lower than the lowest ranked survivor :(
---
Well, how about S.T.A.L.K.E.R?
---
Lol if I see a survivor go into the coal tower I leave.
---
just trying to stun the killer
---
Tbh u did pretty good for less than 20 hours dude keep up the good work!
---
I had that on my first bloodweb for Myers and Wraith
---
Leader doesn't do anything anymore in regard of gen speed
---
Real pros don't use flashy cosmetics
---
I HAVE SEEN LOOPS TALKED ABOUT AND I KNOW THERE ARE SET PIECES THAT ALWAYS SPAWN THE SAME (CERTAIN WALL SETS AND SUCH) IT'S JUST A LOT TO LEARN REAL EARLY. THIS GAME IS REAL FUN, BUT IT HAS NO TIME FOR CASUAL PLAYERS IT SEEMS.
---
If matchmaking wasn‚Äôt like that your queue times will be even longer.
---
Level 5 Killer gets level III with Tombstone and kills the baby dwights on the other side of the pallet. Baby Dwight: "Whaaaat?! That's BS! This game is lame!" \*Continue to play for 100+ hours\*
---
Baby Dwights become Michaels and the cycle starts over.
---
Don't do that, don't give me hope
---
yeah I tried that every time but the survivors tend to stick near the damned ironworks
---
Correct head to be serving at Scoops!
---
that‚Äôs so messed up. people suck
---
Was going against a reworked freddy and i made sure the random knew where the hatch was. Got into a chase and ran him to the other side of the map where i was downed. Freddy leaves and 2 seconds later random is downed on top of me. I stopped playing the rest of the day.
---
Honestly get the DLCs first before you even look at cosmetics, it's way smarter to get all the content first.
---
Yh I‚Äôve played plague a lot. The experience isn‚Äôt fun without add ons. She doesn‚Äôt have great gen pressure and even if survivors do cleanse which is seen as giving plague a free win. They cleanse away from all gens so if you go over ez loss. So she feels like a M1 killer after everyone‚Äôs broken.
---
Assuming you mean drones, all they do is reveal your exact location to the hunter, you can shoot the drone to destroy it temporarily
---
Maybe that's why everyone escaped?
---
Most likely a new killer that was salty that he got looped or a new killer that wanted to make sure he got at least 1 kill

Probably right on it being both with how our lobbies have been. They probably have a few kinks to iron out with the system.
---
This along with a few other things are quite common now; Can't heal self at all, can't see the healing progress when being healed, can't recover when DBNO and can't wiggle. Might add more if I remember any.
---
Has your butthole unclenched yet or are you gonna need surgery to fix that?
---
It was like that on ptb but deemed too powerful. I'd be down.
---
He was a rank 11 and he had another kill. Who he tunneled mercilessly since they didn't have decisive strike. All in tier 1, but he was running save the best for last, ruin, pop goes the weasel, and I don't remember the last perk.
---
I‚Äôm gonna need surgery bro it‚Äôs still clenched

Reason I'm maining Nancy at the moment also cause I want to get that perk for meg to mix with Sprint burst

What the fuck
---
imagine disconnecting and ruining someone's game because you're a little bitch
---
Sorry but thats how you deal with camping. You leave, there is no point in falling for his trap even more. If you leave there is a chance that killer might go : ''Hmm, only one kill. Maybe camping wasnt a good idea''  
---
But if the killer acknowledges the defeat and would like to secure that one kill then that was his last hope of doing something. Sorry that it happened to you but you can also look at his perspective
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuoYlwyejU0
---
Rank 4 as a survivor and rank 6 as killer in 2 weeks of first starting.  Learning as much as I could from streamers/youtubers definitely played a huge role.
---
‚ÄúHahaha üòÑüëâ‚Äù
---
Make Ruin baseline, starting at 5% regression, and remove the skill check fail where it stalls for like 2 seconds so when you hit the good it regresses but immediately starts filling up again.
---
Each totem removed from the game takes a percentage off, and when all are cleansed add a 5% extra boon to greats. Rework Ruin so it benefits keeping totems up. Other new perks can now bolster or change this regression system, something like...
---
Hex: Oops - Landing a good skill check results in a delayed startup to repair by 2/3/4 seconds. Just an example. Lots of options.
---
Totems now give a soft whisper sound effect in a proximity of 8 meters to survivors. 
---
Nerf Nurse. 2 blinks only, no add-ons to manipulate this at least. 
---
Buff all other killers besides Spirit and Billy. Gently. 2 traps baseline for Trapper.
---
Give Hag better iridescent. 
---
Give Clown massive blur effects when gassed. We need more killers that mess with your visuals. 
---
Give interactions between Killers to benefit survivors counterplay. If a survivor can get points from disarming a trap, or revealing Ghostface, they should get a sick 500 from dodging a Nurses blink and swing, or an extra 1000 Bold for pallet dropping a chainsaw swing. 
---
Make Kindred baseline. Remove killer aura reveal, add it to Deja Vu(or Fengs pretty weak Gen perk) and activate it when working on a generator and killer comes within so and so meters. 
---
Make gates require fast skill checks(as if effected by Huntress Lullaby with 3 tokens). Fails trigger an alarm.  I want opening gates to be a panic inducing last moment.
---
Make Huntress Lullaby tokens stay after cleanse. Or at least reduce to 3 tokens. 
---
All I got for now.
---
I mean how is that shit toxic it‚Äôs annoying yes but it‚Äôs in the game so how does that make it toxic but I will agree idk why insta heals are a thing
---
True but the wide open ones kind of fuck over the survivors. Also it kind of depends on the killer. Monto made a fucking cancer build on the Doctor where his terror radius damn near covered the entire map on the game and made everybody DC. It was glorious, but I wish that on nobody.
---
I hear you man it's sad cause she is awesome
---
This is not a competitive esport game.  It should be designed around horror atmosphere first and tryhard killers/survivors second.
---
I don't understand his perspective because I'm a green rank killer too and I accept defeat. I'll even stand at the exit gate and nod at the survivors. If they completed the 5 gens, and got a gate open, I consider that a GG.
---
Thank you Mr. Cramit
---
Its very difficult especially with hatch and endgame collapse. 
---
Now, this match I only scored enough the game thought I got a Merciless but in reality it said I was "Ruthless" http://imgur.com/a/8PRvFvv
---
Just protect the gens as much as possible for those first 10 minutes. Gets your hits, build up those points. Get ready to be gen rushed.
---
cool
---
You must be solo
---
Mid-tier is practically synonymous with decent
---
If big heads are your style then it's a good look, it just struck me is all
---
Well there are other better perks showing up in the blood web at the same time that I would rather take. By taking iron maiden I would have gotten it out of the way but I also would have possible lost out on those perks that I wanted.
---
...how can you be carried by friends as killer?
---
I was rank 18 killer was able to kill 3 survivors one escaped just because doors were too spread out and didn't want to tunnel off hook. But only one was yellow the rest were purple and up like how did the game break this much with ranks
---
I played hag today for a quest ( rank 11) . They only got 3 gens done. I don‚Äôt know why she isn‚Äôt used more. The key is to not chase and use traps.
---
These are the kinds of games that I really enjoy as survivor. Real ass-clenching moments.
---
With the sale, go for DLC. Better in the long run.
---
You seem like the kind of person to have a snake or other reptile as a pet.
---
They‚Äôre bugged since the patch
---
Yeah, I'm from Canada and most of my friends don't get on until really late for me. So I play some solos.

* Most crossposts are automatically removed, as they are typically unreleated to Dead by Daylight.

It has variable range. The cues are his hands being completely still and his hiss. It's hard to get used to in a pinch, so just screw around with it until you get the timing down.
---
Yeah ik haven‚Äôt screamed that loud since I first started out this game.  Most games are just crappy teammates or camping killers.  Still love the game though
---
&gt;reflexes of a squirrel on cocaine
---
i lost my shit
---
his head looks like scrotum and i wanna slap it
---
Ok
---
Hard to get banned in a game where the report options are as functional as a crosswalk button. A steam ban on dbd is probably just as hard to get if you're not actually cheating haha
---
I'm torn as someone who has spine chill in every survivor loadout but I also main Pig...
---
This seems like a stupid nerf though, as pig if I saw they run spine chill (scratch marks before I even get to the gen), I'd just strafe towards the gen while looking away.
---
Why Spine Chill was an annoyance to me as a stealth killer (as it should be, that's the point of the perk), there were ways to counteract it and it did *not* need a nerf
---
Sometimes it also helps to make them *think* you have left. Once they come down and you come right back, you're usually closer than you were and can at least get a hit. Not-great survivors tend to panic and play worse if they are injured because they no longer feel as confident.
---
For me spine chill used to be a crutch perk until a day before the new chapter dropped. You don't need it really. But yeah anything that helped map a killer will be negated IF they're under stealth.
---
Ah
---
I don‚Äôt think I ever said that? I play toxic as in looping. Flashlight body blocking and etc this build just helps me with that
---
They already get punished.
---
Be punished for survivors mistakes like a unsafe unhooks is next level entitlement
---
But accepting defeat and giving up before the game ends are completely different things. Game is not over yet and killer is suppose to kill. You accept defeat AFTER you are defeated not before.
---
probably just being another typical toxic survivor. yeah it sucks when that happens, but learn how to move on with your life
---
I dont camp but then dont tbag and both dickhead shits will stop. I soft tunnel people who tbag so.
---
&gt; I‚Äôve been looped as the demo more than any other killer because he doesn‚Äôt have any tactics to prevent that from happening 
---
I guess you've never played Wraith then...
---
100% its iconic
---
It really do be like that
---
My advice? get insidious on leatherface. Make your build Iron grasp, agitation, insidious, and either noed or ruin as the last perk. 
---
And just take survivors to the basement and camp. Survivors LOVE it
---
Your character model blocks line of sight, he has to be visible on screen.
---
He‚Äôs getting a buff soon, pounce will destroy pallets. I think that his portals could use a buff though, increase the travel speed and make the range of the Killer Instinct bigger.
---
Good for bbq
---
No, the rank system just doesn‚Äôt work. Especially if you‚Äôre solo. Fucking sweaty tryhard rank 1s in every low rank match
---
Nope, I haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs pretty much the same way when it comes to pallets?
---
Pig is one of my favorite killers, so you could do that if you want.
---
Even assuming that was the case, wow the killer has a poor chance agaisnt like 4% of the entire playerbase *wow* how sad
---
Or maybe they're running out of ideas so they want to get some cool characters in the game while they come up with a really good original idea instead of FUCKING LEGION
---
SERIOUSLY, THEY HAVE A KNIFE 
---
OOOOOO
---
KNIFE TIME
---
Let em work

Never not pallet stun the Entity.

---
Just slide some of them my way, thanks
---
Would you be asking for a nerf if you found him slightly over powered?
---
I prefer having more pallet but unsafe ones and few safe. Wanting to have dumb maps with almost every pallet safe is kinda annoying.. like the game
---
You just have to play unsafe pallets accordingly, they are not made to loop but take time to reach another pallet.
---
I rather have in a map 20unsafe pallets and 5 safe than 10safe ones tbh (over exaggerating since the min max pallet don't reach 20 but you get it)
---
1) He did get nerfed. While it might not seem big, it‚Äôs actually huge.
---
2) The PTB is a garbage in terms of assessing balance. It‚Äôs seldomly used by survivors and littered with ranks scattering across the board.  It‚Äôs mainly there to see if there are any bugs coming up in the patch and to make sure everything runs smooth.
---
That spirit keychain, and Spirit and GF picture are incredible adorable. My heart melted üò≠
---
Those are just toxic SWF, it happens to any killer
---
Just buy DLC if you want characters, it's always cheaper then buying each character individually with Cells unless you absolutely 100% just want only a Survivor/Killer from a DLC. (Or grind 9000 Shards per character if the character can be unlocked for free if you'd rather save money and spend time playing the game)
---
Impossible. Okay non humans but dinosaurs?.. really?.. how to kill a game mood 101
---
How is it a survivor mistake if the killer is camping? Or the "non camping" billy or spirit who instantly comes back the second after an unhook. It's gotten to a point everyone needs to run borrowed time/ds just to play the game. Where is the fun in that?
---
Gens are totems are hard to find and most pallets aren't even that safe. Bit early to make such a ridiculous call don'tchu thank?
---
I don't think I mean a drone.  It's like the equivalent of the DBD hook.
---
Never 5 games in a row to me. I'm just salty
---
Take my upvote pug
---
If the Killer didn't lobby dodge on that they are either a masochist or insanely good.
---
Yes. You're slow as fuck and the stalking takes forever. Maybe against rank 20 to 13 it's easy. Look at his add ons.
---
Do you know what his breaking pallet addon will be once he gets buffed?
---
But, would the big daddy be killer, or would it be a little sister? Or maybe a splicer?
---
Rank reset was recent so its definitely a possibility. Also I dont consider body blocking (or parading as you call it) for someone to make it to the exit gate toxic, tbh I encourage it because its something you should do as a good teammate.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Netflix replied on one of the DBD tweets teasing this outfit. So, it might actually be the next one she gets!
---
Wait is that actually his scream lmao
---
Cus it‚Äôs a game and they want to do what they want cus it‚Äôs a video game
---
I would save if I were you
---
Don't be toxic you can still win without being a sweaty butthole.
---
Worse because he doesnt have pounce.
---
Most streamers do it, they also use gamma on their monitors... its not shitty/good/bad it just is. You can still hide from people.
---
This game doesn't remove grass based on settings nor does it change draw distance. Play on low esp if you're the killer, nobody likes teleporting around because the killer has a potato.
---
Eh, I've never lost a game on the game as killer except my first ever time playing nurse where everyone got out. Those pallets are powerful but once the like 8 pallets on the map are gone, the survivors might as well jump on the hook themselves.
---
Who are you commenting to?
---
Leatherface still scares me the most during gameplay
---
Big facts. They're babies.
---
damn, it really did work, outstanding move my guy
---
Why?
---
Very nice! My daughter does these and I have trouble ironing them for her. You're look amazing. What's your secret?
---
Protection hits though
---
They're beta perks, unfinished version of perks that are already in the game. Example: Last Standing is Left Behind.
---
OP if you‚Äôre on PC, PM me your steam and I‚Äôll get it for you. No reason to delay yourself from this hype!
---
And they postponed that until later lol
---
When I want to try-hard with Mikeyboy, I like to run BBQ, Ruin, Monitor &amp; Abuse, and some other perk (Enduring, Spirit Fury, Whispers, etc). M&amp;A is really good for Mikey since, at Evil Within 1, it gives him zero terror radius.
---
[deleted]
---
Hah. Yeah. So you need to stand in between the Killer and the Person, both need to be Flagged as in a chase and no one can be further away than 1 toenailclipping
---
Nice strawman kid. If I mean mistakes I intended when you do unsafe hooks, idiot. God damn it you really need to strawman to have a discussion or you just can't read?
---
Welp every m1 killer has to bring enduring and SF to just play and except few ones ruin is needed, how fun is that? I can make the same argument so what? My God entitled much
---
Okay but minecraft cave music is probably royalty free so if this was real they could add that music when you see the killer, that would be scary af
---
Those are rookie numbers
---
Please do

Go watch tru3talent kill all four and get 32k on legion at red rank
---
Just take a hit for a survivor being tunneled off the hook. Not that hard
---
Tru3 is super cocky and tends to blame his mistakes on things other than him messing up.   
---
   
---
Compared to Otz who points out his own mistakes, and is really down-to-earth.
---
Hell yeah, Steve.
---
Hes been banned like 2 or 3 times
---
Why did this make me laugh so hard I cried?
---
Just figured we got multiple indoor maps before we got a harbor or water area map (Backwater Swamp does not count)
---
Sure, whatever nice talk
---
Yeah aiming to get M&amp;A, need to start leveling the Doc I guess. The amount of Gen grabs I've done today is unreal haha, could almost hear them scream
---
i use M&amp;A, ruin, bbq, and enduring//nurses/DH(if im running scratched mirror
---
Huh, weird, i thought we had to download it still. Maybe i just brain farted
---
Which literally makes you likely to be on hook in the next 30 seconds.
---
I would say there is a discrepancy between Killer getting stacks for hooks and that. If survivors got a stack for healing others/themselves i'd be fine but like this? Hell no
---
Yes, heres a list of things on both sides thats considered toxic: t-bagging, flashlight spamming, camping, tunneling, insta heals, keys, super optimal SWF squads, nodding hooked survivors or hitting them on hook, am i missing anything?
---
Your the one running WGLF so if you want bloodpoints you gotta deal

I just want a cosmetic bottom that doesnt look like shes wearing a trashbag. For the tops something like her Party Outfits or a great Jacket would be nice.

---
Welp I posted my answer in this thread but since you can't argue with it you just skipped it I guess.
---
Dw I get it, one day you'll get better as a killer.. maybe, not sure with that attitude
---
On ps4 i have legit been screenshotting all my matches. Cant rank up because theres never anyone to unhook. After reset i got put at 15 surv. Playing with ~18 killer and survs on average.  
---
Like you said, most killer games are opposite. 15 playing against level 12 and even a few purple try hard survs.  
---
Never had this much trouble ranking back up to green after reset. Maybe stranger things brought a lot of noobs?
---
Mikey is so good at jump scares! If you want a hilarious build go M&amp;A, Nurse's Calling, Ruin, and NOED. Use Scratched Mirror and Boyfriend's Memo plus burn the offering to go to Lerys.
---
This build makes it to where you can't go past EW1 but you can see survivor's auras when you stalk. It's a hilarious build!
---
That's quite the accomplishment!
---
It was going on the whole (3 minute) game so I don‚Äôt think so but who knows
---
I‚Äôm ready to take this into my games :)
---
Christ, you're a bit slow aren't you?
---
I watch him like everyday. He's my favorite streamer/ YouTuber rn. That being said I don't have 4k hours into the game like he does, so I can't really do the things he can.
---
Do you stream a lot? Really enjoyed the energy you gave off in this short video lmao
---
Fix your connection.
---
There is something called Nat. Google it
---
Yep keep insulting me instead of just stating your opinion vs mine and not giving any real discussion
---
WHY HAVE I BEEN IN A KILLER QUEUE FOR CLOSE TO AN HOUR. I DIDN'T OPEN UP THIS GAME TO SIT IN A LOBBY WITH THREE OTHER IDIOTS WAITING ON A FOURTH THAT'S NEVER GOING TO SHOW UP. I'VE BEEN REFUSING TO PLAY SURVIVOR BECAUSE MATCHMAKING HAS BEEN A COMPLETE JOKE. I'M A RED RANK SURVIVOR, I SHOULDN'T HAVE THREE BABY DWIGHTS (NOTHING AGAINST THE BABY DWIGHTS AROUND)  WITH ME AND A KILLER THAT LITERALLY JUST INSTALLED THE GAME. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO PIP WITH THIS MATCHMAKING, NOT TO MENTION I GET SHIT FOR BLOOD POINTS WITH BABY KILLERS.
---
Scoops steve is the new toxic nea, i always get ass blasted when i go against one.
---
survive with friends
---
My typical perk build on her is Ruin, Thrill of the Hunt, Discordance, and BBQ (for bloodpoints). If you dont care for the BP, then you can run Haunted Ground, Nurse's Calling, Stridor, or Surveillance. For my add ons, I usually run add ons that increase her movement speed while phasing. Mother Daughter Ring and Prayer Beads are the lethal combo but you'll get a lot of hate for it

---
Honestly not much of a mindgame. Wait till they Jump the pallet and hit them.
---
I know this comment is pretty expected, but, just get better. Watch looping videos from DBD content creators, prioritize getting better perks from survivors, and grind for hours on end. Personally, I got to the red ranks really easily from knowing how to chase the killer around.
---
im on PC, all ive seen is the spirit, knife guy and chainsaw guys alternating
---
You‚Äôre so pretentious it‚Äôs unbelievable haha.
---
I‚Äôve seen post game chats where people don‚Äôt have demogorgon and people rant due to the fact they are playing a killer they like
---
Yeah enduring or brutal strength I wanna get for the loops/pallets. Ruin would defo help, last 3 games got gen rushed to fuck but had tombstone on so still got two of the fuckers.
---
You don‚Äôt have to play that survivor to level them up
---
If anything, they need to weigh win/loss. 
---
Like if you win against someone of a lower rank, you gain less. 
---
But if you lose against them, you lose a ton. Like more than 4 pips. 
---
And on the other spectrum, gain a ton more for beating rank 1s as a low rank. 
---
Pretty much the system is broken. I‚Äôve been saying that since the first emblem change and it‚Äôs just getting worse. I legit don‚Äôt enjoy this game anymore because I‚Äôm forced to player least 1 tryhard that ruins the match.
---
Yeah that happened to me, then one just disappeared too. Annoying cause they were easily done too.
---
will blocking people through PSN prevent me from getting into matches with them?
---
They're already bored of going against the same shit, it's just that they want the killers to change it up and don't seem to realize that high-rank meta killers are meta because of how survivors play.
---
Amanda is best girl.

In case you want it

With Good totem RnG a Ruin last a 1 min. At best.

Fair to say most players know usual totem placements,not accurate but in a possible Area.
---
As annoying as Holding M1 for X more seconds I feel like it‚Äôs the only possible way that gens aren‚Äôt done quickly.
---
Or the only other Solution is Ruin increase skill checks chances,but good totem RnG would be needed.
---
It‚Äôs decent in Badham Preschool and the New ST maps(that mainly because I didn‚Äôt see all the totem placement,some were bugged,maybe they changed it,so now I‚Äôm not sure where they are)
---
Let‚Äôs be real good Totem RnG is like 1/10 matches and getting awful survivors is another.
---
Welcome to DBD my friend
---
How are insta heals toxic? It's legit so you can extend your chases. Flash lighting to extent chases isn't toxic,  clicking is "considered" toxic but does it really hurt anyone? Taking hits for other surviviors is legit protection points and something we are supposed to do. I take hits for randoms all the time,  it isn't just swf. Killers always blame swf because they don't let killers get easy kills. Literally nothing you described is that toxic. I was totally excited for the new killed,  and have been face camped by every single one lolololol. Now that's toxic.
---
Not my fault they can‚Äôt handle getting downed once
---
Did you even read the fucking post? I'm saying there should be less indoor maps because they are unbalanced for some killers
---
I feel like it‚Äôs a bit to early to tell he might need a buff due to speed of actions regarding portals because if you think about it anyway he has to walk to them to use them but there are add ons for that so I don‚Äôt know what they could do, I think shreds fine the way it is personally
---
Kind of hard to get any practice in when the game keeps crashing on them.
---
I've got a little over 1600 hours, and stuff still spooks me.
---
Hag traps are portable heart attacks after all.
---
Get over yourself. Can't take a couple tbags? Bolster your feelings
---
Fucking me. Last night I just went in circles screaming
---
Flashlights also emit inverted waves (like those used to cancel background noise)
---
I've noticed this. Idk why but I'm pretty sure some people just deliberately try and hold off ranking up to bully longer too. It's probably from their own lack of skill as killer and the incredibly low skill ceiling of survivor
---
I love Head-on + Dead hard. Land head on? Gtfo! Miss head on? Dead hard will save your ass.
---
Dude, who is downvoting these posts? Show yourself!
---
I'm so sick of Minecraft. I hate the game now
---
Its almost spooktober
---
Good escape!
---
Thanks man!
---
Were you running Dying light?
---
It‚Äôs not my connection it‚Äôs my friends and I will pass it along
---
You AIN'T GOT SHIT ON SWAMP MOMMA
---
Even a little is nothing. You could easily get 800 points and more during the next match, which this current setup is meant to rush you towards getting into.
---
Yeah, It's not fun for anyone I think. Bad palettes, the whole top floor is shady - just a row of little rooms? I ran into one to get away from a billy and found myself in tiny locker room with no where to go haha
---
The portal room is more boring than it should be. Could have been really cool. Bigger with a guaranteed gen in the back? Lockers should be maybe be grey. The hooks are awesome. The darker halls with the particles is cool. (upside down world) Too many narrow hallways -make em wider - needs more adjoining rooms. There's a lot of new detail but it feels cramped.  Get rid of that top floor - make the rest bigger.

Yes, is it bugged?
---
Seems so, ive seen reports of people crashing with it equipped, and ive had 2 game crashes when going for myers adelt.
---
Verify integrity of game files just look it up if you dont know how
---
It's impossible to repair 5 gens in less than a minute, not even close.

Ohhh yeah if you don't have premium.. I forgot about that.

---
That‚Äôs some fucking bullshit, why haven‚Äôt the devs said anything about the bug? Or even just vault the perk temporarily until it‚Äôs fixed.
---
This. In fact, some perks NEED you to take hits to activate (We're Gonna Live Forever and Mettle of Man).

TBH it's justified.  Whether or not you like it, it's still the highest selling video game of all time.
---
Do not skip The Clown. Bamboozle and Pop Goes The Weasel are meta and he has a better power than Legion
---
Surveillance, PGTW, BBQ+C, and Discordance on Freddy. GG.
---
Where is a totem when you need one
---
i have played the new map at least 15 times today and i don't even know it x-x
---
This is on demogorgon
---
I have seen only the bodies of those who died in the same hook they were, I haven't seen those tps
---
Definitely get clown and plague. Their perks are way too good to miss out on. Plus they're fun to play, whereas i don't really feel legion is fun to play for either side.
---
No matchmaking is fucked. I was facing rank 20 demogorgons the entire time I was in green and now am facing rank 19-17s and I‚Äôm purple.
---
The only one where it felt was fair was a spirit who looked like she purposefully deranks to bully lower leveled people.
---
I bought the dlc the day it came out and both Steve and Nancy didn‚Äôt have any cosmetics
---
It's SO hard to find totems on that map. If someone uses ruin, I'm probably not gonna find it.

Same

can i ask who vommy mommy is?

I think you mean Insidious Leatherface

At least it could go underground and stuff but sadly it doesn‚Äôt mega lunge

I'd send a screenshot of the issue to BHVR via their website/contact support. They'll likely be able to help you far better than we can.
---
I'm gonna have to side with Mom on this one
---
Huntress Lullaby works wonders if it doesn't get popped early
---
I want my friend u/toxxic-myers to see this
---
He's anything but, I've barely won a couple times (my win is anything that isn't displeasing the entity) but I've had way more losses. That could just be my lack of skill, but I don't find him powerful. Most toxic behavior derives from using crappy killers anyway. Wraith is bullied, clown is bullied, and leatherfaces are bullied
---
I wish you luck I just finished Adept Wraith and my advise is  Coxcombed Clapper+The Ghost Soot to create one sneaky Wraith that can yoink survivors from gens.
---
With how gay this sub is, no offense, every post would be "ooooo big daaaaaddddy" and I would not be able to stay a member of this sub.
---
I feel bad for the killer, but at the same time HOLY FUCK THAT WAS AMAZING
---
I'll copy paste it since you cannot use the scroll button.. and not only that
---
She's pretty good tbh
---
You can't put her as a leather face tier, it can catch people. Who cares lf can insta down if never catches anybody! Plus faster to break pallet? Ehhhh not really unless you preventively charge the chainsaw and if they don't drop it you just lose momentum
---
It has a nice map control, a nice lunge to close the distance fast and punish shack for example (something that many killers can't) and it's fun to play against since can just lunge in a straight line like Huntress hatchets
---
She's far from weak (or he/it, whatever. It's a non human so it's fine)
---
The Plague I assume
---
holy frick i love this. great job!
---
Indeed, don't run it until we get word from BHVR that it's fixed
---
I get what he's saying. A lot of YouTubers popular with a certain game are all trying Minecraft simply because its blowing up. YouTubers who pull 30-60k average views get 4k on an MC vid because they want to hop on the Minecraft train.
---
Lol thanks my guy the killer was actually pretty good.    And we exchange ggs at the end so it‚Äôs all good
---
I just want the Tom Cruise sunglasses
---
Amazing! Great job!!
---
Consoles have shitty internet cards. Usually you have to do some tricks to have Nat 1 or a good Nat 2. Usually opening the router ports too so you won't have problems
---
This kind of things are not exclusive for DbD, also fighting games and some fps are affected that's why would be good apply these changes depending on the router you use
---
Homophobia ain‚Äôt cool bro
---
Yeah, I could just relate to him only getting one kill as the demo
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and yeah getting tunneled isn‚Äôt fun at all for us, but you absolutely do NOT have to let anyone live unless you want to.
---
WHAT?! WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SHIT! I THOUGHT HE SHOT IT OUT OF HIS HAND LIKE A MANIC FUCKING GOKU! IM DISAPPOINTED NOW!
---
Amazing for survivors and awful for that poor trapper
---
Even though he didn‚Äôt get much kills he still didn‚Äôt face camp or patrol so I gotta give em props for that.  Thanks for watching btw hope you enjoyed
---
Why do you downvote the truth
---
Is that why I can't hear the Demogorgon's chase music? The thing sneaks up on me because I don't hear it coming.
---
None of the pallets are safe
---
And all the totems are gods
---
Unless it‚Äôs really apparent that something is wrong with the Killer (like PTB Ghostface), always give it a week or two before asking for buffs/nerfs
---
I played a Game this morning and oh my god.
---
Right as the match starts, I get someone in the basement almost immediately. Right as I hook them down there, Haunted Grounds popped. 
---
Somebody went in to save him, but triggered my trap and got Insta-Downed. The remaining 2 ran towards the basement, and triggered my Traps I had placed OUTSIDE. 
---
So literally the game has been active for under 5 minutes, and I had all FOUR of them in the basement. Such a hilarious time. I love Hag ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Unfortunately its based on a lot of players experiences with these three, but I‚Äôd go with Curtain Call. Clown is a pretty decent killer with nice perks, and Kate is s pretty good survivor. Where as the darkness among us additions are pretty weak, and theoretically, same with Demise of the faithful.
---
The raw sexual energy this post exudes is almost too much to handle
---
True. Its not, but I'm not being homophobic. I'm saying a lot of this sub's users always post about how they want shirtless killers, and for what? Because they think they're hot.
---
When Topless David was leaked, there was so much hype around how sexy David was and how he was "Daddy David". 
---
Like it or not, this sub acts gay. Whether they are or aren't isnt up to me
---
As a killer main I have fun playing against him as a survivor, but I‚Äôm having trouble learning how to play him, I wish I was back in brown ranks for a proper try rather than green ranks but oh well. Either way I agree, Demo doesn‚Äôt need changes.
---
The game is not for everyone
---
Hey it's me, OP
---
Get plague. Idk how anyone finds legion or clown fun to play. Both are so resident sleeper.
---
If Audrey II became a DBD daylight killer, the game would reach god status.
---
That was amazing!! Did you know the hatch was in there or was that just by pure luck??
---
Great story OP.
---
You seem well adjusted
---
Why can‚Äôt y‚Äôall be content for a second. I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt want this but give the devs a breather. We need to appreciate what we get and learn to ask for more in moderation.
---
perhaps
---
It was luck which was amazing I‚Äôll be admiring this clip for years
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: After opening the gates I could not leave the match, I could walk past the point of escaping and walk off the map, which ended up in me spawning again inside the trial and unable to escape
---
Something similar happened to me earlier today. The Nea had me follow her after she got me down from the hook and we got out through the hatch.
---
Skip Legion.
---
Spirit and Clown have incredibly good perks, and Kate has Dance With Me which is fun.
---
Plague and Legion have about 1 good perk each, but Plague is a lot more powerful, if a little dry at times. Jane and Jeff have crap perks.
---
Technically in the show there was a point where it was specifically hunting 1 person.  So it certainly is capable of thought beyond simply hunger
---
fucking same.
---
Was this on ps4 or xbox
---
 Too relatable
---
Completely agreed, and I believe this applies to games outside of DBD too
---
Dude, what a bad timing of camera angle... you looked to the other side, right when Myers went straight to you from the middle path.
---
Xbox
---
Perhaps auto vaulting window
---
Fair enough on **Cruel ~~Confinements~~ Limits**, taking in perks that you can‚Äôt really plan to capitalize off is definitely a risk, and especially in Trapper‚Äôs case risk something you usually want to minimize since his gameplan requires so much micromanagement and, frankly, sheer dumb luck.  But that‚Äôs the nature of gambling perks, sometimes they pay out the ass and sometimes they bust.  I think that speaks to a bigger problem with the meta (it encourages very conservative risk free play) than the perk itself.  That said, if you run it with **Tinkerer**, **Surveillance**, or **Bitter Murmer** you can definitely reduce the risk (though I fully admit, using half of your load out on perks to try and mitigate your own failure to apply pressure is definitely not optimal).
---
As for **Mindbreaker**, I feel like that‚Äôs only true against SWF, which I admit does break this perk (though tbf, SWF breaks more than 2/3rds of the Killer perks and half the survivor ones unfortunately), as even if you know you‚Äôre against a stealth killer you can‚Äôt know whether or not they‚Äôre busy unless you can actually see them (or with SWF).
---
That's why demogorgon boi is so smort
---
This new map is actually garbage, just like every other indoor map in the game.
---
You‚Äôre not even the same person I originally responded to, jesus i thought the person i was talking to was the guy who said he got 4k‚Äôs all the time. Anyway you have good points and maybe i‚Äôm not playing him 100% the best. But i think it says something when you have so much map coverage and the gens are still able to fly no matter what gen perks you have (i‚Äôve tried them all).
---
I‚Äôm starting to think the killer might‚Äôve been me, does my username match their gamer tag?
---
As a survivor, I LOATHE indoor maps.
---
Look Who‚Äôs Shitting in the Tall Grass is my favorite.
---
It's probably because of both the high price of the stranger things DLC and the new bloodweb update, making it way easier to find meta perks.
---
MiNInG aWaY
---
I‚Äôm not sure i didn‚Äôt remember his gamer tag sorry
---
Still vault over because the shock took an extra 2 second to get to survivor and a extra half a second to register.
---
I had no idea where she was taking me lol. I just thought it was to the other gate. I didn't expect to live after saving her so that was a pretty cool surprise
---
I've had the game since launch, and back in the early days I don't remember ever getting bullied as a survivor. However, I remember several reasons that made me not main killer until recently.
---
One was the infinite lobbies, but also the infinite loops. Back before they added the entity closing stuff off, and before Bloodlust was a thing. Once survivors started learning looping, it was impossible to catch them. Especially at the Killer shack. Just infini-hopping the window. I actually quit the game at that point and didn't come back until the Myers DLC.
---
Actually this would be lit
---
0:36 it's like ''Peekaboo bitch.''
---
great job, on point and definitely my favorite fit for legion
---
Ah yes... HELL
---
this is quality
---
Oh Hi Mike
---
What if he acted as a reverse spirit. Moved about in the shadows, but couldn't see survivors until he used his power? His map is brighter and he sees scratch marks and survivor shadows until he BENDS THE LIGHT. 
---
What if he infects survivors until they began to turn into a shadow + man who then would be in control of the survivor and would go hook themself? (you must struggle with yourself to resist THE MERGE and the SELF HOOK)  
---
What if he sent out 4 clones of himself to different areas and when the glowing + sign appeared on his chest you must remain perfectly still or else you'd trigger an aura alert? TRANSPOND &amp; LOCATE
---
What if he took the form of the survivor the furthest away from him and tried to get close to other survivors (heal/work on a gen together) to sabotage their progress and harm them? COUNTERFEIT COMRADE   
---
What if the noise he made when appearing near you was a 14.4k baud dial modem? 
---
What if he could down survivors with a short flash of light from his chest + and hides their incapacitated bodies in a locker until it was time to hook them or they were found and rescued by another survivor?  
---
PULSE &amp; HIBERNATION
---
Honestly I want this I think it would be a cool map
---
That moment had to be one of the scariest I thought I was home free lmao
---
Likewise!
---
What's with all the lava
---
The floor is lava.
---
It's an offering that gives **everyone** (killer and survivoirs) an extra 100% bloodpoints so at the end of the match, whatever they've made is doubled.
---
Thats a pretty good meme there son
---
His delay on his shred misses is increased. It‚Äôs not a huge amount, but it seems to have had a decent impact.
---
My man!
---
...He was being quite literal with it though.
---
*Coughs in shirtless David flair*
---
I stated an opinion, YOU attacked me. "Means your a crap Killer tho."
---
No you didn't you assumed I said something I didn't that's not an opinion xD
---
&gt; Fundamentally I think the Spirit/Clown/Doctor have the most ‚Äúfun‚Äù playstyle
---
Excuse me what in the fucking fuck
---
If you're able to watch TV shows and eat while playing Hag, you're probably Rank 20. ‚îê(¬¥ÔΩûÔΩÄ)‚îå
---
My condolences.
---
Then shouldn't flash lights work on anywhere on it's body and not just it's face?
---
Legion and Plague are both skippable. Their range from meme worthy to meh and as killers they aren't spectacular. Clown isn't a great killer either, but he gives you pop goes the weasel and bamboozle.
---
*Laughs in 99% Tier II*
---
What‚Äôs the issue with the SWF? I was trying to get into games with some friends today and there were so many issues that we only managed to do 2 games in 2 hours. We kept having people not be able to see others in the lobby, we had people suddenly get kicked out of the lobby while they appeared to still be there for other teammates, we had game crashes, etc. It was a nightmare.
---
It was
---
It's a very situational perk and that's why I the community dosen't use it as much
---
[It's streamers coming out of a party popper.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z%2BGbvBVYL._SX425_.jpg)

You weren‚Äôt chad enough to escape.
---
Ooooh yeah big daddy drill me harder
---
I'm sorry to say that you were completely outskilled in this clip
---
What getting hit by Wraith actually feels like-
---
The set up for second wind is so annoying.
---
At least on the PTB:
---
You cannot use speed boosts to help you. No medkit, no we‚Äôll make it, no botany, no nothing.
---
You have to do it alone. If someone helps you for even a second, it won‚Äôt count. 
---
Which brings me to the fact that: if they even tap themselves with self care...you don‚Äôt get it
---
It is incredibly irritating  to set up for a perk you can only use twice a game
---
Hes referring to the icon.....
---
Yeah that's the problem though, it's less about "if you're good enough" and more about "if they're bad enough" because of survivor advantage.  Also that advantage drastically increases depending on the killer you choose.
---
It doesn‚Äôt hide his greatest feature!
---
You realise men and women play this game right???
---
There‚Äôs always an extra cosmetic exclusive for buying the full chapter. No other way to get them.
---
While hero brine is cool and all of they even remotely thought of doing this they‚Äôd probably do the new hip kid version of herobrine, entity 303
---
Sauce?
---
I should've been more clear. I wasnt talking about any of this. By toxic i meant teabagging at every at every pallet stun. Dragging the game on unnecessarily longer than it couldve lasted and yes making fun of their playstyle in post game chat and such. I agree with everything what you said but im pretty sure i didnt complain about any game mechanic except maybe the mafchmaking.
---
Fix her face
---
Wait it actually cost $800???
---
The wide majority is men and thats a fact.
---
Spine chill is not terror radius based so it shouldn't be affected.
---
I get the frustration genuinely. Sometimes you can't account for what's going on with people though, can only speak for myself but there have been times I've needed to disconnect for a good reasons. 
---
In those occurances I've allways messaged the players after apologising for it I understand its uncool and I hate it myself when it happens to me but sometimes life gets in the way. 
---
Rage quitting is a thing though and this game can bring that out fairly easy would be good if the remaining survivors got some BP in survival based off of disconnections or something. As a killer a disconnection early game means you have no chance at a merciless victory and that is real irrating.
---
Never go in solely for the money. Go for fun first.
---
Killer queue is almost as fast as survivor for me. I think too many people are dodging based on ranks/levels
---
We already have the clown
---
I've tried to end a game like this the past month but unexpectedly ally-ooped off the hook as well. Too bad I just launched myself right into the killer doing his rounds. I was freaked on that amazing moment, dont care that I was killed.
---
by god i love him unconditionally.
---
LOOK HOW HAPPY HE IS
---
Happened to me as well yesterday while it was updating. Then checked verify integrity of the files, turns out few files were missing and started downloading few additional files. Then it got fixed. Try it.

---
Dwight forgives you
---
IT DOES, BUT THEY CAN GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE TECHNICALLY BEHIND THE HAND AND THEY DON‚ÄôT GET HIT
---
I know that's what was said, but in at least custom matches, the dedicated server exclusive bugs are there.
---
It's...entrails?? At least that's what the rorschach tells me.
---
Good idea, but they are too close to being different, maybe herobrine is different?
---
Oof, the back pedaling dude. It's okay to just admit you misunderstood my post.
---
They also said dedicated servers will be out during summer so we'll see about that
---
You are a person of impeccable taste and refined culture. Thanks my friend.
---
If you have a friend you can go into KYF
---
Lol you must have not been on youtube before 2014. Way more minecraft back then, in fact, a big part of minecraft's recent upsurge is the nostalgia from back then. Thats why I redownloaded it a little while ago. I feel like a dumb little kid again when I play it...actually not really because when I was a kid I was scared of the monsters and herobrine. I was a dumb kid.
---
BBQ, STBFL, Surge, Infectious Fright.
---
BBQ: self-explanatory.
---
STBFL: great perk on literally any M1 Killer and makes the next two perks an even deadlier combo. Demo also doesn't even have to actually ignore the obsession since using Shred on the obsession does not affect stacks, although it can be a little unreliable. 
---
Surge + Infectious Fright: M1 to win basically. You apply pressure on gens, locate nearby survivors, and make slugging a much easier task which further forces survivors off of gens.
---
Been trying to find some use for Cruel Limits (RIP Cruel Confinement) but it seems too map dependent for me to always take it. 
---
Thoughts?
---
What a clutch game
---
Then leave
---
Get over yourself. Cant take a couple campers? Bolster your feelings.
---
I can second this. It's very frustrating at the moment. Also I am noticing the hit boxes are a little off. Everytime I go in for a swing near a fast 90¬∞ turn I hit the wall. Another thing is when they drop  pallets I somehow still get the stun, even though I'm not close.
---
Honestly, I responded to the wrong comment and didnt wanna look like stupid because I'm sure that would be used against me like "he doesn't know what he's saying" but I guess I'll have to bite the bullet lol
---
If your goal is to humiliate someone you don't know and cannot directly interact with, you have bigger problems than camping.
---
I hate people like you
---
I've withstood it for over 2 years. Not outta the game just yet
---
I‚Äôve been using Small Game alongside Inner Strength and that‚Äôs the only thing keeping me from losing my mind
---
BHVR, NEVER PATCH THIS! Good punishment for body blockers
---
Then stop bothering us.
---
It‚Äôs okay to go in for both just don‚Äôt count on getting money and followers immediately
---
Wtf is up with his scream
---
Ok but people weren't hopping on a trend just for self benefit. Minecraft was just a good game that a lot of people wanted to play. Now its just "hmmm how do i get more views than I'm getting now. Oh PewDiePie's playing minecraft. Lemme hop on that."
---
I have no idea.  Hope they make him sound like his actual character soon
---
You just got countered. GG, ez, better luck next time. 
---
JK
---
Considering the atrocious state the ptb was in, I‚Äôm glad they delayed them instead of just releasing them in a broken state
---
Congratulations! Hype!
---
I don‚Äôt know 4 Moris in a game was kinda frustrating
---
UwU
---
No
---
As far as I'm concerned, I can say what I want and argue what for what I think is correct. If you wanna go the "just leave" route, we can just agree to disagree and you can move on
---
It was my pleasure!

I was able to get that one with the pig about 3 months ago, I remember hoping no one would dc
---
Other than light clicking what's wrong with the other things they did?
---
Okay you caught me ;-;
---
K nobody cares,leave if you can't handle toxicity
---
Maps. Maps suck and are the biggest reason for imbalance and unfun ganeplay, imo.
---
I like the map from an aesthetic standing but it's just so co fusing trying to find where I'm going.
---
Imagine thinking that rank matters, and even if it did how are you not red ranks as killer if that's what you choose to main
---
Killer, once you know how to run tiles on an M1, is basically the relaxed version of this game. You need sound cranked up playing to hear grass rustling but other than that the game is basically "determine what ways you'll let survivors get away to generate most BP/ stacks of certain perks for memes"
---
HAG out of anything shits on people for the least effort. What requires so much energy out of strolling around, pressing CTR and swinging at a survivor?
---
They can't avoid traps if you trap random as shit spots they don't expect. Plus if you trap near pallets or windows they'll just proc it though walls/ run to the safety and begin looping you right out of teleport.
---
It‚Äôs about playing as the killers you enjoy instead of just playing to the meta. You‚Äôll 4k a lot more than you lose no matter what killer you play
---
No joke, they definitely put the best totem hiding places in the game in this map. I've played several games where neither ruin nor devour ever went down.
---
I sometimes just dont even kill Steve's just cause I dont wanna hear that shit
---
This is my kind of luck when im playing killer and feel like sweating
---
Hope they actually fix his voice soon
---
Tbh it varies for me. Sometimes it's right away, other times it can be 15+ minutes. However I'm almost always matched with people way above or below my rank
---
People have suggested powers that could turn to other survivors but that seems so underwhelming when swf is a thing. Other than that seeing illusions of penny wise sounds kinda cool but probably a bit too overpowered if you have to pallet stun them to make them dissappear.
---
I will never shit talk a baby killer. I will always give them advice and help them when I can. 
---
You know who I will shit talk? Someone who tunnels and camps me. I always get tunneled and camped, and when I want bloodpoints and to have a good time to immediately be killed off while I ran the killer 3 Gens or die on first hook is bs. You don‚Äôt get points, I don‚Äôt get points, and if you do it just to be a problem player, then you deserve the shit talk.
---
Doc has some cool pallet denial/ mindgames (although some pallets are guaranteed downs like the unsafes outside large structures)
---
But Clown and Spirit are by far the most sleeper shit ever. Clown is "drop pallets fast and run to next tile" and spirit is "coinflip"
---
I can take a camper lol. Bro here thinking he's real smooth
---
I dont know what yall are talking about the plague is a blast to play for me just from her special ability alone and jane has head on and is super thicc so its a win win
---
I'm almost done getting my Steve to Prestige 3 lol. Gonna finish that before I even level Nancy.
---
This happened to me twice in the past week, its pre update
---
Although penny wise would be rad, I‚Äôm still hopin for jack from any of the king books/movies
---
You can just do it while you play it‚Äôs super easy! I would definitely invest into an overlay and alerts if your serious about it and you‚Äôll stand out. Also playing with friends is super helpful so you can stay entertaining and don‚Äôt have to talk to yourself.
---
Same.
---
Damn! Lucky!!!
---
I get that I should be playing for fun, but it's hard to have fun when you're getting your ass beat for not playing meta. Additionally, I don't personally agree that you'll 4k more often than you'll lose no matter who you play.
---
I really don't understand the hype for mincraft. Nobody I know plays it and it looks hella boring...
---
One of the few times I‚Äôve actually been lucky lol
---
Since forever
---
No joke it took me 7 tries to do that, 6 because of DCs and 1 where I failed. It was my last trophy too so frustrating.
---
Everyone does it. I can play on high but F that.
---
That doesn't exist anymore, they reworked the game completely.
---
Now the hunter shoots you down and leaves you to be picked up. If he catches you again he can sacrifice you there and you're out, or leave you alone again to get future downs and more points.
---
Your artwork is so beautiful! But my main gripe is the harsh downward lines above his brow. It makes him look very angry, and Michael's signature is the emotionless mask. If you erased those, it would greatly improve the look.
---
Someone doth protest too much. 
---
You ever suck a dick? Just give it a try. Might be for you. And a good dick can actually reach the mans g spot... maybe you should give it a shot
---
First time on the map yesterday. I was you.
---
No one found ruin, either.
---
I‚Äôd honestly be down
---
oof. Guess I‚Äôm just salty that I died that way.
---
I hate to be the dumb one but how do you use them or like get them??
---
Imagine if it's the The Mangler. Big ol laundry press the size of a tugboat just scootin through the cornfield
---
when should i have dropped it, before he was at the pallet?
---
At least this version doesnt fly across the map for his one shots. It's Big Daddy. He's loud and clanky with a big terror radius and probably C tier if his kit doesn't also include some way to map pressure / slow the game down *just a little bit*. But if he gets close you better bet that you're going down quick.
---
Video version because gifs have to be a minute: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhslD8BdvbQ&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhslD8BdvbQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
I didn't even notice that.
---
I'm just saying you're acting like you leaving would be a great inconvenience on us. It wouldn't.
---
One of the first times I played this chapter, a Steve got hooked and I honestly thought it was Kate glitching out.
---
Obviously not. I'm stating a fact. None of you had to give a shit. I'm just saying if that were to happen I'd leave. You got yourself involved in this, not me.
---
That's Meat to you
---
I dont know why the devs decided to go with that scream hope they fix it soon
---
Thanks! This makes a lot of sense.
---
I like how you escaped and the video ends but it replays , made me think you magically got teleported back onto the hook .
---
Every type or only the ones that rely on terror radius?
---
You deserved it
---
The new stranger things map is the biggest map I swear
---
The exact reason I'm never using the 2 Gruesome Gateaus on Dwight
---
The reason you get hit through pallet stuns is because the killer is the host. So their hit will register before the stun and as a result both happen, it sucks but once the dedicated servers are 100% functional this issue should be fixed. Till then it‚Äôs just because the killer has hair advantage
---
It did come out
---
There is no info regarding your question on the official website. 
---
Dedicated Servs are coming this Fall so I guess not.
---
He also has a little sister that runs around and randomly breaks generators. She can also mess with survivors (slow them down, possibly other status effects). Survivors can mess with her for a personal bonus (all action speed increase) but it enrages the killer and boosts his stats (faster and can 1 shot)
---
You're being a shitter in a public space and then you're all like "oh no you don't have to pay attention to me". You post it out there, it's there. Stick with it instead of acting like none of your words mean anything.
---
Since the update I've been dcing randomly and it just says that I escaped even though the game is still going on. Same thing is happening to my friends.
---
WOWHAHOW. THAT IS RELATABLE! I do enjoy watching stranger things tho, and also I'm good at the game too, so I'm willing to help any new players
---
You right
---
"Pro" Game Strat go to the room above the Saw room first, sometimes a gen spawns up there so then you might know 2 gens, and if there isn't just drop down to the bathroom gen.
---
I'm not backtracking or stepping down. You actually did not have to reply to me at all. My comment could've got 0 attention and I would not have cared. Again, stating a fact about myself. And what I said about this sub is also true
---
Better hope I‚Äôm not legion or ghostface if you do ;)
---
Will you end up covering every killer?
---
(pls say yes)
---
You‚Äôll destroy me lmao
---
Bruh, why you name shaming?  Bruh, you decided to queue up. Bruh, that ping isn‚Äôt that terrible. Bruh, be happy with your points and pip. Pips are wins, bruh. Bruh, rank 11 is a lot closer to rank 17 than you think.
---
I don't get often 4k but I have started to believe in something else than Kills, 10/10 Would've pick Clown again.
---
I'm not sure if there is a difference between dull totem and hex but I was able to cleanse this totem location multiple times today. They were all dull.
---
Clown Boi his laugh will start to make you feel things.
---
Huntress is bugged, turns out it wasn't related to dedicated servers.
---
I made it 1.0k. Cowards.
---
I made it 1.0k losers
---
I recently got my Wraith mori after matches and matches
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Yup, [pre updatw] submitted a ticket and was told, "we know. We're working on it."
---
Must still be working on it...
---
It‚Äôs a magical lobster that doubles all your monies.
---
Claudette has enough firecrackers to flash-bang Wraith straight back to The Howling Grounds.
---
Would you kindly get hooked, then die!
---
How do you make these lol
---
It's honestly horrible. Everything else is somewhat good.
---
So I wasnt going for name shaming. They are just beginners and I know that. I‚Äôm more surprised as to why the game decides to put me with them. And clever on you for using bruh. Thanks for trying to incite a reaction. And I also stayed on the lobby because its hard to find games on PS4. That one game took over 15 mins to find. 
---
Also, I fins this odd that you had the brain to write all this but not a brain to understand that Rank 17 and Rank 11 games are way different. People around rank 9-11 at least know how to do generators and pallet loop while people closer to rank 20 are generally beginners that don‚Äôt understand the game yet. Also, the ping was 200.
---
i hope they enjoy their vacation, they look like their having the time of their lives
---
The demegorgon is terrifying tho
---
Even on the ps4?  I've been working nights and thought it was still in the beta phase on PC.
---
It was an infinite Tier 1 Myers, probably thought I wouldn't see him despite him being so tall.
---
It‚Äôs a Snapchat filter.
---
Now that I think of it, it‚Äôs terror radius and spine chill is a distance perk. I apologise.
---
you fool  
---
you absolute buffoon
---
using any perk on killer is cheating
---
How you get out lol
---
Yep. Just started. I still want to point out that since the patch I have had 1/11 games where all ranks were relatively normal.
---
He's getting buffed to destroy pallets with his pounce, like one of his ultra rare add ons let you do but it will become part of his base kit.
---
Why do you not like it? I haven't seen any past 3 except for the most recent reboot. I thought it was an enjoyable change and the masks were a cool idea. I can see why it might not be liked though, no mikey rip. I might just be bias because of Tom Atkins; Night of the Creeps is one of my favorites.
---
Lvl 16 mike against a lvl 2, 3, 5, and 7
---
*real fun matchmaking*
---
No.
---
Pro tip: it‚Äôs not cheating using NOED either. Or any other perk. Or killing survivors. In short, it‚Äôs not cheating to actually play the game.
---
I thought I was so slick with an inventory full of purps and pinks with a few golds here and there on two characters. 
---
This though. This is straight fucked.
---
PLOT TWIST: Its steven King as the Survivor instead of any of his characters.
---
This sub already has it out for him. I dont see that perspective changing. He absolutely says he messed up a lot and almost always compliments a nice play by his opponent.
---
Tru3s biggest problem is the game is not balanced for the highest level of play. And if youre not playing against those players you wont understand some of his criticisms.  I dont play at those ranks either so many things he complains about dont effect my gameplay but I can see his point.
---
He can be a little cocky but I wouldn't call him even close to toxic. There's far worse out there as far as content creators go yet tru3 seems to be the one who gets the most hate.
---
Hes very good at this game and never claims to be the best so I dont see how hes out of line either. I love watching his videos and anyone can learn a lot from him.
---
Came out yesterday for PC. Should be out on PC. I think they fixed all that delay releases a while back
---
But back when the mask was being hyped recently I believe Deathgarden went on sale for 50% off from $15 and dropped down to $7.50 (might have been $10, pretty sure I didn't pay $15) and came with an extra copy or some shit (I still have a gift copy of the game sitting in my Steam inventory, and I only bought the game after the remake).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Basically even if I'm getting the sale wrong, two people could get the Meg mask for $7.50 (half of fifteen) by having just split the cost of the BOGO.
---
And if I'm right, the Meg mask could be gotten for more like $3.75 to $5 if you had a friend to split the BOGO with.
---
Even at full price the BOGO is/was still effectively cheaper than Scoops Ahoy, and may have even been cheaper than ~~Nea's~~ the Entity's mask.
---
They did their first live gig recently
---
Nah demogorgon
---
Cujo when?
---
It‚Äôs happening on PS4 aswell, trying to play with friends and we can‚Äôt see each other and when we finally do one of us gets kicked out of the lobby whilst one joins a game and we can‚Äôt fix it
---
Nice call of duty ghosts cosplay although I think ur on the wrong subreddit friendo! I think ur looking for r/codghosts
---
This is my favourite chapter I've played. It's honestly really well done, except for Steve's voice. Demo does pretty well in game, and he looks creepy. His vault always catches me off guard, he looks like a weird, but cute dog.
---
Yeah it's being really weird rn. Speaking of rank in rank 6 rn on survivor and it threw me with very low ranks multiple times like 17-20
---
he look like a brussel sprout
---
Well I've got 1,850 hours, so I'd day it's pretty good, plus it lasts for a while.
---
I could totally be wrong. But weren't they interviewed by the arcade guy? Oh crap he works there too?
---
Aight boomer
---
Just had a game against a laggy nurse. :/
---
You have ascended
---
Theyre normally inside shelves and stuff.  Never by gens now
---
I think the arcade guy is working at family video now too idk lol
---
Yeah, so at first, I thought I was being cheeky, but then I tried to leave and it wouldn't let me out. Thank god for endgame or one of us would have to DC.
---
Ur a fucking pussy just try and kill everyone. You're a killer not a nicer.
---
So beautiful
---
Or the cave sounds when you enter a room randomly
---
I think he's a fun Killer, but tbh Freddy is better in every ways, and freddy is a joke compared to the top 3.
---
But i am happy BHVR is now releasing balanced and fun killers instead of BS "i teleport to u gg no re" killers.
---
Its a party firecracker exploding
---
On ps4, when downloading games it‚Äôll have two sections
---
[Data to start]
---
[all data]
---
Data to start in the case of DbD, is just the tutorials, you‚Äôll need to wait for it to finish downloading all the way to play
---
You'd get atleast 300 per bloodweb lbh
---
Thats a big small brain save right there.
---
fax. i‚Äôm tired of the ranking system being unfair.
---
Its honestly as fun as you make it.
---
I mean yourself and other people have posted it
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ4oElfO25g&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Id do Jake, meg, David, And bill. Iron will, Adreniline, dead hard, borrowed time. make sure u save over 1 million tho. It's cool to be able to grind to infinity bps
---
Not sure how long you been playing but you can learn to counter flashlights. 5 seems pretty high. Just make sure you are looking at a wall when picking up a survivor. (Tho it can still happen. I had someone flashlight save through a window they were crouching right up next to. I couldn't see the beam and just their head and yet...)
---
You can also bait flashlight people to run at you and go hit them. Stand over the downed person for a second then turn and look around. They will practically run right at you.
---
The main problem is this game was not made for SWF and has not been balanced to compensate for it being added, thus the toxic team plays. Once you realize it, just play the game best you can, get your points and move on. Leave chat IMMEDIATELY after a match so you nor they say something stupid. (Don't give them the salt they crave)
---
It's all super infuriating. There are times of the day I won't play because of how much worse it gets. Adjust accordingly.
---
At times like this, you can use insidious for its intended purpose: crying without the survivors noticing you.
---
They could be doing Doctor Sleep seeing as the movie comes out in November,,, 
---
Killer : Rosie the Hat 
---
Survivor : Dan Torrence
---
Map : Overlook Hotel
---
That'd be a killer they could do so much with Rosies appearance 
---
Jack would be cool too I'm absolutely giddy at the possibilities
---
Right but I wanted to clarify how it affects the other perks that are dependent on being in a Killer's radius. I'm assuming with or without spine chill, if you don't feel the terror radius, your perks don't charge.
---

---
Well, if you're destroying a portal you can't hear it.
---
Like I dont want to play against a low tier killer, nor do I wanna play against killers who face camp the first down because my two rank 16s are doing  a spinning contest in the basement
---
No need to apologize. I had a question and we're all having a good conversation.
---
I call it the masks of shame. Trapper and Megan have to wear it as a scarlet letter if you beat tested that trash heap.
---
Does nothing agaisnt SWFs though
---
Damn ü§£ü§£ that‚Äôs my luck right there
---
They look too similar, I'd make Alex the survivor
---
Love the clip. I have had games where I'm 1 of 2 left and I have the key. I save the last guy from hook and have to motion to them for like 2 minutes straight because I have the key and I know where the hatch is and they don't know. Thankfully, we usually get away. Sometimes it pays to trust when someone motions to follow them.
---
&gt; The only two killers that this even affects are Freddy and the Demegorgon.
---
Wait what about pig or ghostface? Nvm for future updates.

PC is having all kinds of screen freezes and memory leak issues as well. pReTtY gOoD jOb So FaR

Shoot me an invite when it's ready. jonxsolo - psn

I have a mic

Useless with SWF
---
Fr tho I was playing earlier and barely escaped cause I couldn‚Äôt find the gaye
---
That‚Äôs ez win for survivor tho üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It was the Pig. I wasn‚Äôt upset at the one player for not helping - for awhile. I mean, even for me, if I realize a player isn‚Äôt being unhooked and I‚Äôm on a gen, I‚Äôll leave it to save another player. This person literally didn‚Äôt move unless what I presume they heard, was the heartbeat.
---
But the player squatting over my head, doing absolutely nothing, that person made me grumpy.
---
And I know, it‚Äôs just the logic that pisses me off really. It bothers me more that they‚Äôre hypocritical about it then it does that something was said in the first place.
---
Like if you‚Äôre gunna call me out, fine? But if I‚Äôm not the only one guilty of the same act than it is not solely my fault?
---
Fixing match making is coming next on the schedule
---
We meet again meat bag!
---
Great input, thank you!
---
If you read the update it clearly said that it only is for Freddy and the demegorgon
---
 [u/vredditdownloader](https://www.reddit.com/u/vredditdownloader/)
---
Learn the maps first. Identify the loops. Learn to loop without hitting objects. Learn god pallets. Takes time but you'll get there. 
---
Look up a video for the current meta perks and unlock them in the order you see fit.
---
That's why I made that correction.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I enjoyed all episodes but really wonder if their gonna do something with El and 8 for season 4.  Like she‚Äôs just there for 1 episode in S2 and then gone.
---
I think it was leaked, saying it was between 26th of september to 30th
---
The only problem with this game is matchmaking takes 10 mins+ &amp; worse with survive with friends.  I could never recommend this game to anyone as much as I love it because if that.
---
Whenever this happens to me it's so frustrating. But if I had a Ghostface at least teabagging like this while it happened it would give me all the lulz I need XD there's something about when he does it that makes it that much funnier!
---
Come onnn. Wraith is the weakest killer give him some slack
---
Yoooo I've done that before with a Micheal (without the hook jump). He was camping exit gate and I found hatch in killer shack
---
Happy to admit fault where I screw up mate all good :)
---
In a game, join soon
---
idk if it's mobile being wack or if the emojis just don't work

which can easily be seen based off when you got dbd.

Congrats! The trophy that‚Äôs put a dead halt to my platinum is ‚ÄúWhere did they all go?!‚Äù I don‚Äôt have 3 other friends who own the game, and one of the two that does own it doesn‚Äôt like playing it unfortunately. But I wish you the best of luck.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d68rll/so_ive_been_playing_huntress_and_nurse_for_about/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I'm well aware that females get admiration in the game and that my statement was negative. That's also the point. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. Just one of the only ones not afraid to voice it. And yes its negative for a reason. I'm voicing my distaste. Pretty obvious about that.
---
Whether it was unnecessary is a matter of opinion because I can say whatever I feel on here. I'll accept any repercussions that come with it, too. If you all want to come at me like you're doing right now, I'm perfectly fine with that. In my head, I know that I'm being called out because "im not gay for wanting so see every man in this game's abs and nips" is something everyone is really adamant about, despite it being wrong. You are gay. It is gay. It is a gay thing to say. People don't like the g-word, but its true. I guess if you can't see that, not much I can do to change your mind at this point, but I'll still try
---
Is it possible to have a custom flair? And if so, how do I get one?
---
But your not my dad
---
I‚Äôll do whatever it takes to win, fuck honour this is life or death
---
I mean it might be more in how you're framing being gay as bad, and also just sort of ignoring that women exist. I imagine that's the deal.
---
Maybe replace bloodhound with sloppy Bucher, the wrath actually has an add-on that does what bloodhound does, so that with sloppy will make it hard for survivors to lose you when they are hurt, hope that helps
---
Seriously? Jesus thats dumb. Surge just doesnt really synergize with anything besides survellaince. And i‚Äôve ignored it on the bloodweb multiple times like the big brain i am

Do you want the cosmetic or not? That's the only thing that really matters. You can sit at level 50 for a while farming with bbq and distressing until you have the BP cap, then prestige into almost level 50 immediately.
---
One of us one of us
---
Diversion could use a buff that it charges based on your proximity to the killer (not TR)
---
I said critically, on RT season 3 sits at 90% while season 1 and 2 are 97% and 94% respectively.
---
Season 3 also has the lowest audience score at 87%, well below the previous two seasons.
---
Like I said, I personally think season 3 is the best but that is the unpopular opinion out there right now.
---
I played on that map for the first time today. What a fucking mess. I fell down that one opening at the top of the map thinking the killer was right next to me. Turns out I fall in and get hit immediately.
---
But herobrine got removed last patch
---
The ideal characters I could think would be in terms of modeling, would be either a alpha series big daddy or a big sister. The powers for an alpha series could be to use little sisters, who would run around and act as monitors, giving the alpha series the ability to track down survs. They could also hinder survs by latching on to them and holding them down, applying an infect like deep wounds except it actually degrades when your engaging them. He could also have a drill charge that acts similar to Reinhardt's charge from overwatch, dealing 2 states of damage to survs and shredding pallets, but stunning them when they hit a wall, and having a timer on how often they do it.
---
Billy you at least have to have awareness of where survivors are, time chainsaws/ curves, and listen intently for wallhacks on tiles with tall grass/ footsteps.
---
Hag you can literally just go through the motions and follow a flowchart of super dumb behaviour and get solid results if they didn't bring flashlights/ don't play immersed 99% of the time.
---
I don't mean to imply she's OP as fuck or it doesn't require game knowledge or any skill- it's just the pattern is not difficult to do.
---
Bruh
---
Pig, my dude. Who needs speed when the survivors are too busy healing from wounds and getting party hats off their head to do anything else.
---
They can have part of it break off into an abandoned mineshaft.

I was all over it and changed positions and the prompt never came up :C

Yeah frame rate is a mess at the moment.
---
His terror radius should be Minecraft music at earrape levels
---
For sure
---
Same with Xbox
---
Pretty accurate
---
I don't think his issue is with lower level players but how messed up match making is.
---
I've had games as killer where the survivors where all 15+ and games where they where all purple ranks with me been at around 10. I watch my partner playing survivor and get put with rank 17s against a 7 killer.
---
Make this happen goddamit
---
It has good times and bad times, like any game. Of course, it still needs some work to tilt more towards the "good" side for both side of the spectrum.
---
3 meta perks in there. Cant go wrong with meta i guess. Not very imaginative though
---
I dunno. I see them as the perfect duo. Both are equally useful on their own, but when combined they form an unstoppable juke build.

---
Eh while he probably felt blindsided it likely he wasn't going to get out anyways.
---
That said if you're going to farm might as well let him farm with you for a bit to get some BP then kill him
---
Wouldn't surprise me. Heaven forbid Killers have anything good going for them.

&gt;I was all over it and changed positions and the prompt never came up :C
---
Maybe it bugs but not always? I am yet to have trouble cleansing it.
---
What you said is exactly what I meant with my post
---
We still got a little shafted. The killer was 12 and the survivors one after another ran into the basement committing suicide. I died the same way since we had 3 gens left and all 3 were in the basement.
---
Im fairly certain that hunters lullaby will also improve the regression
---
its because high rank players dc more, so during rank reset you face higher rank people as a result
---
Huh? What is this?
---
That would be nice if totems werent just handed to survivors on a golden platter
---
I know Herobrine is a huge icon in Minecraft but he looks too similar to Steve. Maybe instead we could have an Alex survivor? Or a creeper killer? 
---
Imagine an overgrown creeper with claws that fucking scratch at you.. and then has a power to ‚Äúblow up‚Äù and respawn, instantly downing survivors..
---
I don't understand this perk.
---
Surely any half decent survivor has some awareness how the scratch marks will appear for the killer when running. 
---
Am I missing something?
---
Then you notice it's in a bugged, inaccessible spot
---
Tinkerer
---
I didn't have a killer in mind, but now that you mention it I totally agree.
---
Mmmmmmm The Man in Black please
---
It had her dead at :16 and probably :20 but tossed it, but it might be on console and I can't even imagine trying to fight loops with a joystick as a juke like :37 usually never works on a mouse with decent dpi settings.
---
Yo that looks really sick. Good job! I wish my brain could come up with cool things like this.
---
I am almost positive that if it is a Hex: Ruin it spawns outside the map.
---
Very true.  At the least you can say demogorgon is great at defending totems
---
go scroll through the dozens of DBD streams with 0 viewers and see if you still think this is a worthy pursuit
---
dead 2 seconds in? Dunno bout all that.
---
Maybe give him like a Pop Goes the Weasel ability where he drills into a gen and regresses it except it takes longer than a standard gen kick? It seems wrong to make him a mobile killer but he would definitely need something to slow games down.
---
I literally just had this happened to me. Figured it would give you killer plenty of chase if he could just stay close to me so I just stayed connected. Forced Endgame but he ended up with 31k, so it worked out ok.
---
That is true. I suppose i‚Äôll try it when im done prestiging my demo
---
It's likely that it's the stress of the game that amplifies emotions. If you're not stressed and happy, you're content. Add stress to that and you become euphoric. --&gt; may be the reason that people like this game. If you are 'unhappy', stress makes the difference between 'meh' and what you describe as toxic. The average 14-year-old player can't deal with that. Additionally they learn to feel and behave that way in less exciting matches over time. 
---
If you're interested in this, look up the link between arousal and emotions. If not, please know that in the majority of cases it's not your fault how the other players act.
---
Sure! I‚Äôm not proficient in any means with him but I do find him decently fun to play. For reference, I usually main Spirit and Pig, so maybe he is just a bit refreshing for me. 
---
For me, I actually didn‚Äôt care for him at first either until I got better with the bottles. I was always very conservative and only used them upon initiating a chase. Nowadays, I‚Äôm much more ‚Äútrigger happy‚Äù with them and I use them to find survivors, much like the doctor. I see a lot of clowns that don‚Äôt do this and at least in my experience, it never really feels like a waste of time to chuck a bottle here or there, especially when patrolling gens. Whispers can help minimize this too if you want and I find it handy on most killers, but him as well. 
---
I still save 1-2 bottles mid-chase though so I am ready at any pallet contention. I feel like that‚Äôs where he can really shine with enough practice. Once you get fairly confident at predicting survivors in general, his power makes much more sense, I feel. I occasionally run Infectious Fright on him as well with mixed success. STBFL can be fun as well and combined with good bottle use can really get you momentum in early game, which is so important for killers. I also got into the habit of refilling my bottles after every down but before I hook, much like Huntress should. 
---
The Santa cosmetic also helps. (:
---
&gt; You call me a little bitch and flame me for saying I don't wanna play against a full stacked team
---
Because that just makes you one.
---
&gt; This sub claims the reddit isn't toxic its just the people in the game 
---
Bullshit
---
&gt; 2 perks vs a shit load of maxed perks and items doesn't make a difference. Especially for a new player. 
---
Difference? Yes. Reason to be a whiny bitch? No.
---
&gt; Sorry bub, but perks have a major impact on the game 
---
So are you a poor victim new player or some seasoned fucking veteran with this attitude, eh?
---
blindfolded as in their screen turns black or distorted? Could work, but it'd be a really new mechanic. I tried to stay simple, but if Behavior ever wanted to add a real blinded mechanic, I could see it stapled on to perks like this that are weak to SWF.
---
Tunneling doesn‚Äôt imply face camping necessarily, i cant count how many times i‚Äôve seen killers who‚Äôll step away from the hook, initiate another chase, and fucking instantly dropping the chase to 180 back to the hook the moment they‚Äôre rescued. Oftenly after injuring their current chase too...
---
Thanks! and yeah, at least just for the design space limitations it really does ruin a lot of the possibilities.
---
Good point
---
Nobody listen to this guy. He is a survivor main wanting less killers to go for 4k. Play what you want and kill them all.
---
Fixed it
---
He's too cool for Self Care. He just went inside a locker and came out a healthy man.
---
You walk faster too
---
Nah, that shit ain't safe at all lol. Bad killer. He kept back tracking for some Reason. He could have easily forced you to keep vaulting back and fourth resulting in an easy down.
---
As someone who adores BioShock 1 and 2, I would kill to play as the Big Daddy again.
---
I just look at all of the closed doors. There is usually a gen at them that opens the door if it‚Äôs done. Not sure how accurate that is though...
---
People do understand this. The perk still sucks.
---
I tried to find this on forums. Where did you read that? And when its goin live?
---
Source me up then, you keep stating your opinion as fact when I‚Äôve only given you facts.
---
Critics don‚Äôt like season 3 as much as the previous two and that‚Äôs a fact.
---
I started to use deja vu because of this xd or bring a map

I'm going to need the full video of this.

no no, people absolutely get it.
---
Wasn‚Äôt there a Stephen King movie where all the appliances turned evil from space lightning?

Head on is great when it works, which is... rarely. It's far too situational, at least in my opinion.
---
same here. JUST TOUCH MY DAM TOTEM
---
Wouldn't mind it, wonder what his ability would be...
---
How to solve this problem, use bloody party streamers or cakes :D
---
yeah, this was green ranks on xb1 so its expected.
---
No, I'd rather not.
---
And the dead ends this map has! Holy shut the other indoor maps at least have more than one entrance and exit. My first time playing it, I got cornered more than once.

I like this a lot

fun fact: they both spaniards

And because your next post didn‚Äôt actually stay;

No I don‚Äôt feel entitled to free wins, don‚Äôt fucking put words in my mouth. I just don‚Äôt wanna play with people like you.

Wait they did?!

I can understand the hate on Legion. Though being a Legion main all I can hear are sad trombone noises reading this thread. Hopefully one day Legion will be more viable,  until then I‚Äôll just keep rocking poor Susie and Julie and their crippling drawbacks.

Oh I know.  I was just joking around saying god isn't the reason I'm so great. 
---
It's an entirely false bravado nobody get angry at me
---
It doesn't take that long if you play a lot and have good look luck with items. I got like 36 cakes on doctor using a million bloodpoints I saved up. I also got about 80 some of those firecrackers because they dropped like candy from a pinata during that event and I only ever play periodically. People who stream or just play a lot, it's really easy to get a ton of items.
---
 Heck, Umbra has 1000 iridescent heads on huntress which is nuts to think about.

These things kill me i‚Äôm laughing so hard üòÇ

i know we all want pennywise but in terms of the SK lexicon and dbd, this character makes the most sense

I really hope a hot fix comes out soon
---
And that's why I can't trust Killers anymore when they actually want to help. Too many people who turn around and stab you in the back.
---
Once you offer to farm you're changing the dynamics of the game. The Survivors will no longer hide from you. They won't run away. They'll even let you hook them in exchange because what you are telling them by farming is that they may live.
---
Had fun killing someone who stood no chance against your attack because they believed you had some integrity left?
---
If you want to kill people don't pretend to farm. I'd rather have less BP and an honest game than a few more BP and more hate for humanity in my heart.
---
I agree that there‚Äôs really nothing that can be done. This was rly just me being salty and ranting but tbh rank doesn‚Äôt even matter anymore because I play in a 4man swf rank 8 and below with rank 20, 19, 18 killer constantly. So it rly sucks.
---
Down them, carry them to a gen and hit it.
---
Wait what does prestiging do exactly and when does it happen
---
I usually slug whoever is slug (usually 2-3 survivors) to assert my dominance and then I pick them up and hit a gen as an indicator.
---
Probably not the best method, but it shows them that I could have killed them all if I wanted and they are usually chill after that.
---
Don't worry about it dude. It really doesn't matter.
---
For some reason I think it‚Äôs gonna be a clown cosmetic.
---
But I won‚Äôt mind a Chapter.
---
What do you think should happen to hex perks. It‚Äôs strange. I completely share your opinions other than the big one because I actually like the hex mechanic.
---
It would be amazing! Imagine the perks!
---
Usually I'll slug one person, and nod at them. I'll hit walls/barrels/trees near by them and begin to pick them up and drop them. Typically they'll get the hint, and if they don't they're likely a low enough rank to not know or really understand what farming is (which I've had before in post game chats when they didn't understand what I was doing). If they stand up after they wiggle out and don't run away from you immediately, chances are they get it and you can now lead them to their friends/a gen/a pallet to stun you or whichever.
---
Doesn't always work that great with randoms, but if it's a SWF they're likely using a voice chat and can say "Oh hey come here, we're farming".
---
You have been blessed by the Hatch King Monto
---
Sounds lit boooiiii
---
Even if you *were* tunneling (which you weren't since you said they were the only person you really saw/could find), it's nothing bannable or even really "bad" per se (Bad manners maybe, but as a killer there literally are **no** rules, though most people beg to differ). As long as you aren't hacking or exploiting cheats, they can't do anything.
---
I feel bad when I'm accused of tunneling when it's, like you said- they're one of the few people I can find since everyone else is crouched and immersed or in lockers.
---
Yeah it's not your fault. Survivors shouldn't unhook if they're not willing to protect the one they just saved.
---
Second wind is decent
---
Thanks I will! I‚Äôll try and test it out.
---
What DS game is this a screenshot from?
---
I wouldn't even care about if he moried me aslong as he let me farm before that &gt;:(
---
Self-care is bad because it's a very selfish perk.
---
For the individual, Self-care is great. It provides them with a huge ability - being able to heal creates a big change in someone's playstyle. The perk provides incentives to spend time healing that otherwise should be spent on doing generators. The end result of the perk is great for the user, but it puts the team at risk since you are not pulling your weight.
---
&gt;Taking a medkit isn't always an option
---
This is why Pharmacy is becoming more popular.
---
&gt;Everyone sites hiding in a corner, but a decent player has enough awareness not to do that
---
At red ranks, I still see Claudette self-caring in the corner. As a survivor, I actually dodge lobbies that have Claudettes in them, and I find my teammates actually do generators. Jeffs, Ashes, Kates - I'm not sure why, but altruistic players seem to be drawn to these survivors so when I see these players I'm happy. With Claudette on the other hand, I know she is running self-care which means 30 seconds of being useless each time she gets hurt.
---
&gt;Bond is inconsistent
---
You do not know how to use bond correctly. You are not supposed to run around the map injured looking for people, that's stupid. You are supposed to stay and sit on a generator, whether you are hurt or not. Use bond to see if someone comes to YOU.
---
&gt;I honestly think people just say it's bad because their favorite streamer thinks it's bad.
---
If people like Tru3, Noob, Panda say it's a time-wasting perk, then surely that means something? Or do you ignore expert opinion soley because it's expert opinion, like a reverse appeal to authority fallacy?
---
People have fun in different ways. Unfortunately, some people‚Äôs fun is taking away the fun from others.
---
I can say with 100% confidence that this is true for all PVP games.
---
Here are a few of my more fleshed out ideas:
---
1. **Give the killer a totem lighting mechanic, or totem placement mechanic.** At the start of the match, the hex perk is non active and the killer must decide where to place the lit totem before the perk becomes active. This would need a limitation of maybe 32 meters between active hex perks, and would require extensive bug testing to ensure no impossible spots existed. However it would allow the killer to hide their hex totem in a spot of their choice in exchange for a small amount of time at the beginning of a match, and possibly exposing the location if survivors took the time to follow and track the killer as they hid. This wouldn't address the separation between the power levels of the hex perks, and I'd like to see a small buff to the HL and TTS with this potential solution. 
---
2. **Make hex totems harder to cleanse.** Right now its way to easy to hold m1 for **14** seconds and completely destroy the magic voodoo curse. It's boring gameplay for survivors, and it's frustrating for killers, there's really not much skill to defending or cleansing totems. So **Solution time:** Make cleansing **20** seconds with periodic hard skill checks that produce a notification upon failing. And, I'd even say that if a skill check is failed, the hex light would teleport to a different random totem in the map if one still exists. This would give a reason besides noed and BP to cleansing dull totems. The specific time and skill check difficulty would have to be tuned to be fair, but I think this would allow totems to feel more like tricky extensions of the killer, and not like helpless little sticks that need to be guarded.
---
3. **Harder to cleanse No.2.** Lit totems could require a sacrifice to remove, specifically they could display a random item type like a flashlight or toolbox and if a survivor had that item, they could sacrifice it with **M2** and cleanse the totem in the normal easy **15** seconds. Without the specific item, the survivor would have to **M1** clear the totem with a **30** second timer, and a blood sacrifice at the end (the loss of **1** health state). This would provide interesting gameplay decisions for the survivor, and mean that the loss of a totem would still net some value for the killer. It would be thematically appropriate and bring more depth to an otherwise dull mechanic.
---
Those are my favorites at the moment, but I'm sure I could come up with more if I thought about it more. I just hope something is done to help the hex mechanic, it really is my least favorite part of playing killer.
---
Optimization.
---
There was a post earlier that you can make hairs look somewhat better if you're on PC and have NVidia GPU
---
It‚Äôs an excuse so many killers say, like when survivors say ‚Äòyou used NOED, that‚Äôs not fair‚Äô even though it‚Äôs a perk in the game.
---
Consoles, guess I‚Äôm stuck with Ace Dirt for the time being.
---
I never have a problem finding games on ps4 for killer or survivor and usually survivors are good on both sides. Maybe it's the person not the game
---
tbh I've had more toxic players in 2 months of dbd than 6 years of playing League
---
It sounds sarcastic when he mentioned gen rushing, since loss of killers use that as an excuse to losing.
---
You seem to think it's faster to go find someone and waste 16 seconds each than to not have to travel far at all and spend 32 seconds on yourself? It's not hard to find someone with aura perks, but even walking over to them wastes time when you could just stand still.
---
That would be some next level shit. And honestly pretty Stephen-King-ian
---
Sounds awesome, too bad devs don't have guts for such rework
---
Thank you very much for this. Got them on my phone and I love them.
---
Any swf is considered toxic I‚Äôve learned even only a duo
---
time to buy a lottery ticket!
---
Ah, thanks
---
Repost
---
Ok good
---
Those are really fantastic ideas. I could see 2 and 3 being implemented well enough ( I‚Äôm especially a fan of three). 1 I feel like is what‚Äôs wrong with most of the trap killers, especially trapper where it‚Äôs take time to set up but gens go way too quick these days to give you an advantage.

Why do you want to make her unfun to play against?

if you're on mobile, you'll need to visit the site on desktop, and then look at the sidebar to the right - you should see a grey banner that says "leave" and right under that is "Show my flair on this subreddit.

Demogorgon: I fear no man.

But that thing...

It scares me.
---
This is my response to someone else on the thread.
---
Self-care is bad because it's a very selfish perk. It's a shit perk, but not because it's useless in any form - it's super useful.
---
Taking a medkit isn't always an option
---
Everyone sites hiding in a corner, but a decent player has enough awareness not to do that
---
Bond is inconsistent
---
You do not know how to use bond correctly. You are not supposed to run around the map injured looking for people, that's stupid. You are supposed to stay and sit on a generator, whether you are hurt or not. Use bond to see if someone comes to YOU. Only then when you see them enter your radius do you leave the gen and get them to heal you. As a bonus, you both go back to the generator and rush it out. (Personally, I prefer Aftercare).
---
I honestly think people just say it's bad because their favorite streamer thinks it's bad.
---
If people like Tru3, Noob, Panda say it's a time-wasting perk, then surely that means something? Or do you ignore expert opinion solely because it's expert opinion, like a reverse appeal to authority fallacy?
---
Iron will is a much better choice over self-care. It's better to use perks that synergize with being injured, instead of using self-care to try and undo inevitable health loses.
---
If you are an expert looper who can take the killer for 5 gen chases, then sure, use self-care. But in reality, most of you nerds are just wannabes and aren't that good a looping anyway, so please just do gens &lt;3
---
It reminds me of the first few seconds of this [gem](https://youtu.be/ee925OTFBCA)

look at flair

The demogorgon is PISSED

Or he is really bad at lag switching, which means he could be really good and just hiding it?

In 2 hours I got 2 games in with friends, they really broke SWF and KYF badly
---
Laughs in scratched mirror
---
&gt;You have to spend 32 seconds, not 20. Taking bond and finding someone could work, however it's inconsistent. If I have to travel half the map to find a teammate, that's time wasted
---
I doubt I have to spend more than 16 seconds finding someone with bond (which is useful the whole game)
---
&gt;The fact that my teammate/s has to stop whatever they're doing and heal me, that's time wasted for them and for me, and overall, for the team
---
As someone else pointed out, each of you lose 16 seconds regardless of time. However what they don't realize is that the other person very well could be injured, and instead of you leaving them unhealed and prone to go down, you're healing them too. Bond doesn't just work when *you* need to be healed, but self care does.
---
&gt;The less teammates that are still alive, the worse the perk gets.
---
The more aura reading perks the worse self care gets. While yes the combined total of time wasted is the same, the time you're vulnerable and can be seen by nurses, bbq, (I know it's not a aura perk), but infectious fright, is half
---
&gt;The fact that ruin is as common as it is makes me not want to work on a generator with someone else. 
---
Get better at skill checks and you literally won't notice the other person occasionally fucking up, however you will notice the gen getting done faster especially if there *is no ruin*.
---
&gt;You saying that SC and botany together is a fine combo is a bit odd to me. You shave off 10 whole seconds ( from 32 to 22 ) but you're using two perks out of four just to do one thing. That's not worth it imo.
---
Botany knowledge isn't just for yourself, it's for your whole team and again, it's less time you're vulnerable, and faster to heal a teamate which would go unhealed.
---
&gt;If you solo Q you really can't trust your teammates to be very productive. You say it's crazy to watch how many people run off by themselves and heal in a corner of the map, and you are 100% right, but there's no need for you to assume that everyone who uses self care is the type of oblivious, 0 self awarness player who would do that.
---
Fair, but this still applies to my last points about vulnerability and other teammates (which is even more important in solo que, when they're not guaranteed to run self care, but are almost guaranteed to be less productive unhealed)
---
As soon as I down one I'll go straight to a gen with them on my shoulder and smack it over and over until they wiggle off. That does the trick 9/10 times
---
For the individual, Self-care is great. It provides them with a huge ability - being able to heal creates a big change in someone's playstyle. The perk provides incentives to spend time healing that otherwise should be spent on doing generators. The end result of the perk is great for the user, but it puts the team at risk since you are not pulling your weight. 
---
If you are an expert looper who can take the killer for 5 gen chases, then sure, use self-care. But in reality, most of you nerds are just wannabes and aren't that good at looping anyway, so please just do gens and learn how to be a team player before you go all Rambo and try to 1v1 the killer in an asymmetric game. &lt;3
---
Same problem here. It's not smooth, bad frame rate and very often connection problems and my lobby split up for no reason
---
I just remember the one on that weird platform in the demogorgon room and hope it's there LOL
---
It‚Äôs the same for me. I spend about maybe 6 minutes waiting for the 5th person to join in the lobby. And it takes about 3 to 4 minutes to even find a lobby
---
Thanks! I do agree 1 does seem like the least plausible solution given how many bugs it would create, and it would hurt to have to demand setup time for every killer running hexes. 2 and 3 are also my favorites, but I figured 1 was such a different kind of solution that it was worth mentioning.
---
Its even longer for me :(
---
When survivors are going to be punished for genrushing and tunneling my hex? I just want to play, stop ruining my games, ffs

Were you a claudette on ps4 and got whacked by the Demi?

Because that happened to me today. Claudettes falling from the sky lol

Yesterday i found survivor games really quick! Killer games took about 10-15 minutes. Its really when u play cuz your dependant on others...
---
I‚Äôm not going to get into a show because it is dlc for a game I like. Stranger things just doesn‚Äôt seen like my type of show from clips I‚Äôve seen of it on YouTube
---
The total time wasted is the same, however the 16 seconds shaved off of being vulnerable and neing able to be seen by aura perks or fright, is extremely good, and bond like I said, helps you the whole time and allows you to group up and do a gen afterwards, instead of being off in fuck nowhere looking for one when you're done
---
Play guessing game. I'd suggest you to try playing kyf to learn this map more and get better in chasing people
---
So we aren‚Äôt supposed to do gens as efficiently and quickly as possible to escape so we aren‚Äôt killed? We aren‚Äôt supposed to take out hexes we see in the beginning of the match (especially if it‚Äôs ruin) it‚Äôs counterplay. It‚Äôs a part of the survivors job in the game. Why do you think you‚Äôre rewarded for taking out totems etc. face camping to be petty because I 360d you is ridiculous.
---
But we already have a clown.  
---
I'd love it if it was that one guy from The Shinning, hotel map would be dope too.
---
3 ghostfaces = all ghostfaces
---
inb4 people will just say ‚ÄúclEanSe toTemS anD geT gOod‚Äù 
---
This is actually a great idea for a re-work to the perk in my opinion. As a survivor main, I refuse to use No-Ed when I play killer because it‚Äôs just too much of a crutch and I hate playing against it due to the fact that it takes no skill to use. At least with things like Devour Hope you have to earn tokens. No reason NoEd should be any different.
---
To me it really depends on how optimal they are being, callouts and bodyblocking/saves.
---
I had something similar. I wanted to hook all twice but one was the third time so he died :/
---
Then I just bodyblock them and don't hit and hit against generators so they do them. One of them instantly got it, the other two didn't get it. After 10 minutes the second one got it, but the third was running away the whole match. I let them all escape

people who say pig is fun to play against just have good RNG or have the luck to not get tunneled while going to jigsaw boxes

---
Imo I think you were a little too greedy for a stun. The chase is more important than risk getting downed sooner, I'd say just throw the pallet after bloodlust starts happening.
---
everyone starting with a bear trap makes a lot of sense with the saw franchise
---
It's my opinion and that's where I think he is on the list
---
Urgh imagine approaching someone think it the survivor but when they turn around and bam it‚Äôs killer
---
If you ignore any time spent chasing, then yeah, sure.
---
Yeah, I was playing with a friend earlier and we had to stop because the game has just been acting up all day for some reason. Aside from long queue time, I got 0 points for survival when I escaped a few times and I got the glitch where I couldn‚Äôt escape at all. I couldn‚Äôt heal someone and they couldn‚Äôt heal me and neither of us were broken, it was just acting up.
---
Admittedly, we did run into a few killers with a noticeably bad internet connection so I will attribute some issues to that, but that wasn‚Äôt an isolated incident.
---
By that logic don't heal at all and then there's no time wasted
---
Demogorgon hates bear traps
---
Surprisingly ive only managed to get killer matches. Havent got a single survivor moment

This has been my experience for the past two days as killer. I think "Man, these survivors are extremely good. I'm not used to this." Get to the end and see two of them are rank 2 and 3, one is rank 10, and the last is rank 15.

Man that sucks not being able to be healed, and I thought that they patched the "not being able to escape" glitch

Oh well I guess

While I completely agree that the killer perks are pretty awful and need buffs, all of the survivor perks are also overshadowed by better perks and would likewise need buffs to actually be strong. Second Wind is the only genuinely strong perk of the release, but will it contest Adrenaline in the meta? Doubtful. Inner Strength is not nearly as good as people make it out to be - it's a conditional and situational way to heal yourself that regularly takes a lot more time investment than other ways of healing. It's nice to have in some situations, like after being rescued in the basement or when having Decisive active and jumping into a locker, or when you conveniently come across a Hex you would cleanse anyway, but overall it's an underwhelming perk that will hardly impact a meta that is already commonly referred to as being a "no-heal meta". Camaraderie, Babysitter and Better Together are pretty awful perks. Fixated is okay, but not meta-viable either. Your last section here is unnecessary. Both sides need better perks for the game to be refreshing and fun, and both sides are direly lacking new such perks, survivors not having gotten a meta-tier perk in years.
---
I like your Cruel Limits idea, only that I would make it apply to the killer's terror radius. Originally it was supposed to block all vaults map-wide, but blocking vaults in the killer's terror radius would be interesting, opening up some escape for a survivor in chase and likewise opening some killer and perk synergies. The perk still has basic counterplay too, just by 99ing gens so long as someone is being chased, so I don't see a huge issue with such a design.
---
Surge in my opinion should simply apply to all generators outside of one's terror radius, and apply a 10% regression, like a missed skill check explosion usually does, as well. That way it would be a viable stalling perk, yet without its only reasonable use being in 3-gen strategies (and again with some killer/perk synergies).
---
Mindbreaker should apply the Exhaustion status effect regardless of how far-progressed the generator is, and hold it for 30 seconds after letting go of the repair (albeit on a flat timer, still counting down if you run). That way survivors would not have their Exhaustion perk for the first 30 seconds of a chase, which would actually impact the game.
---
I understand the pain of campers as a legacy Jake I get camped almost every game. But as a ghostface main I would like to say not all camp.
---
I know , and it seems to have gotten worse after the update
---
Opposite in japan, before the update youd be lucky to successfully connect to two games an hour, now its every 5-10 mins with maybe 30% disconnects at lobby. A massive improvement.
---
Cosplays sweet and all but what you got in that tank
---
When a killer kicks a gen, for every 4 seconds that goes by, it regresses 1 second worth of time it's been worked on.
---
It's bugged, supposedly.
---
Its bugged. Equip and unequip something or change her cosmetics.
---
Before someone starts working on it again?
---
Every time I play Survivor I go up against about 3 to 5 Ghostfaces per session, and at least one of them camps. Today I got 3 camping Ghostfaces. I played against a Spirit and a Leatherface and both of them didn't camp, even during End Game Collapse.
---
It's literally just Ghostface players who camp at my rank. Every other Killer realizes that camping is boring an ineffective, but Ghostface mains would rather crouch in a corner and hold down M2 instead of play the game.
---
Ghostface mains are Survivor mains learning how to play Killer. :P
---
I haven't posted a bug report yet as my client has been messing up a lot since the update, so I'm trying whether it was just that session or not
---
Thank you for understanding. I even apologized to them in endgame chat but they weren't having it..  it's a shame most Survivers think killers have to follow unspoken rules. All of the rule guidelines posted on steam are satire anyway so anyone who takes them seriously is an idiot.
---
Right
---
I've heard of it but it never happened to me
---
As if it would make a difference with the red ranks I'm going against
---
And Freddy.  Anyone else can go fuck themselves though.  Even Nurse would be weak on a map that large.
---
I wish this was a DS game! It's from RWBY volume 1.
---
Late reply, but definitely a mobile friendly app, would be much better.
---
This is the correct answer. Only terror radius-related perks and conditions are affected by Undetectable. Spine Chill's description says "when they are within 32 meters and looking at you."
---
I didn‚Äôt realize that I want this. Until now.  For as much as IT and Candyman and Jason get tossed around. 
---
 I want to prayer bead and mothers ring a gelfling off a gen and mori it.
---
If you just want to do it as a hobby, it's as simple as downloading OBS and then reading/watching a tutorial on how to connect it to your Twitch account. You might spend a lot of nights playing to an empty room, but that's no different than not streaming at all, so if it interests you, I figure you might as well! Plus, someone might find you and really enjoy your personality and gameplay and playing for a (positive, friendly) audience is really a fun experience.
---
If you ever wanna turn it into a paying gig, that takes a lot of extra effort and research, but it can be worth it if it's something you're willing to put a lot of time and effort into, and there's lots of resources out there to help you figure all that out if/when you reach that point.
---
Yeah she slightly has the Quentin thing going on. Steve came out pretty good though.
---
I do agree with everything you said about the current Freddy.
---
But about the old Freddy being more skillfull, let me explain.
---
The biggest thing about the old Freddy, was juggling. If you didn't knos how to juggle, you we're fucked. 
---
The thing about "carefully thinking about where to place snares" thing, isn't exactly true. I am sitting with around 130 hours with the new Freddy, and this is how a match goes. 
---
Start the match, obviously it's a coldwind becaus apparently coldwind is the only map in the game. Go to a gen who you think survivors will be at, whilst placing some random snares at jungle gyms, or just loops in general. Find someone, and either 1, be an M1 killer, and wait until they fall asleep (happens if they're actually good at the game), or hit them if they're bad, and become a killer with a power to help him. The person will run to a loop, spam snares around the long side of the loop, make him/her run into it, and get a hit. Hook, and from there, rince and repeat. And thing is, it isn't fun.
---
Old Freddy, was basically this. Find a survivor, see if there's more, if there is more, sleep them all. You now have 1-2 people not doing anything except to fail a skillcheck. Chase the person, if you realize they are just going to run you around forever, use the aura reading on the others and head back. Sleep every survivlr you find in the chase. Once you get the person on a hook, the survivors wilm 90% of the time, BM the hook (because your a Freddy), sleep the person going for the save ASAP. Then hold your power on the hooked person. Then go for tha saviour. Rince and repeat. Dealing with bad RNG (skillchecks), and knowing how to juggle, required skill to some extent.
---
Awkward.... O_O
---
Same but ig i gotta go back to Mike Myers
---
Adiris is my main, and she definitely has flaws. A lot of people will not cleanse, and in doing so, you'll be a basic M1 killer who suffers heavily from safe areas, especially because you'll be too tall to mind game. In that regard, the Enduring/Spirit Fury combo feels very crucial for her, especially with maps like Blood Lodge where there are a ton of safe pallets in the center area with structures and junk piles too low to play around. If you don't have Corrupt Purge or some way to play around pallets in an area like this, you're gonna get teabags after teabags.
---
Apples can be helpful, but you might find that the absolute best addons (and this is coming from a main of the Plague, but as always opinions will vary) are cooldown addons. You can break someone with a stream of vomit without any effectiveness addons, so having the ability to swing soon after you finish a vomit is a very helpful thing.
---
Neighborville hype
---
10/10 idea imagine the demogorgons mori on ole Rian
---
Scratched mirror Myers just to hear that little thing squeal.
---
They should ideally all be Billy tier, not Spirit or let alone Nurse.
---
That said, good, experienced players can win most of their public matches with pretty much any killer character, and pretty decisively at that. I don't even usually tunnel or camp (that is, use optimal strategy trying hard to win) and still win more of my (red rank) killer matches than I lose. There are also add-ons that elevate the weaker killers into the upper tiers of lethalness.
---
It's not even just "good killers": according to BHVR stats, *all* killer characters average more than two kills at rank 1, on *all* maps. In fact, the *worst* average kill rate at rank 1 of the *least lethal killer* character on the *least killer-favoured map* was *55%*, and that was while *excluding disconnects* which would obviously only increase that number. And then the average kill rates of some killer characters can go into the 70% range, and some killer players are up in the 80s. So yeah, in terms of "balance", you can't just look at the core game balance, it always fundamentally has to do with the actual players facing each other, and in that respect, killers are already "imbalanced". Plus, as long as Nurse, Spirit, some ridiculously strong add-ons and Moris exist, you will always have a chance to win even against the most skilled, experienced, coordinated, etc. group of survivors.
---
The Amazon listing leaked the killers. The Nintendo page as well as behavior's page never specify which dlc's will be included. They only say 9 killers 3 cosmetic packs etc.
---
that explains a lot lol thanks
---
I had my reddit to the new system, and changing it for this is so weird.
---
Thank you so so much :)

But herobrine isn't real..
---
To me it sounds better in theory, like of course I can't play it but i like the sound of it, and any way the bear traps aren't completely useless I'd appreciate
---
Killers need to play the whole match with three perks active ( with instacleansed ruin that‚Äôs 2 perks) so I guess it‚Äôs good as the way it is
---
Best alien boi
---
I mean the other 4 are just as useless. Behaviour practically encourages toxic behavior at this point.
---
Taking away the spamming and replacing it with "hold *button* to give up" would go a long way. And hell, maybe they surprise me by doing something else
---
Great Jagras Junior
---
If you want to take it a step further, I actually recommend [the one made by /u/trekkspace](https://breakmedown.github.io/dbs-release/) as it has additional modifiers from perks and items.
---
I think it's a good idea but yes, just cleanse the totems. The issue with cleansing the totems is it's boring as fuck, and doing gens are already boring as fuck. Totems need to be drastically changed
---
You DC to stop wasting everyone's time
---
I want this fr fr
---
my killer queue is averaging on 10 mins+ and then it blesses me with a 4man, it makes me want to cry
---
Is it possible to learn this power
---
I do not understand a single thing about this video
---
What do you mean with "new map somewhere"?
---
Every gen in the Game is attached to a door. Find closed doors, you'll find a gen that isn't done.
---
You‚Äôre right. Comparing NOED to the hatch is like comparing apples to oranges.
---
At least you can counter NOED by cleansing totems. The only way a killer can counter the hatch is by stumbling upon it by accident, which survivors can do as well. And no, the hatch isn‚Äôt killer sided. Both survivor and killer have the same chance to get to it first. And even if the killer gets to it first, the survivor can just wait by an exit and escape. Not to mention those that wait for their teammate to die on hook while they camp the hatch. 
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right. NOED and the hatch are incomparable. The hatch is worse. Crutch win. 
---
Very hypocritical of you to complain that NOED is a crutch and unearned but refuse to admit that the hatch isn‚Äôt. 
---
Also, your teammates have to be HUGE potatoes to not get a single gen done. Even if you get potatoes for teammates one game, it doesn‚Äôt mean you get them all the time.
---
So it's fine to get frustrated at the game but at the end of the match what they did will not effect the next one.  I've gotten better at chasing loops by getting looped for 5 million gens. Flashlights SUUUCK but they're easy to get around look up or look down that way you can see which way they're going.  If they're tbagging at the exit just rush em out the door. If they're toxic in the lobby just hit continue and be on your merry way. I'm lucky to have a community to play with but I've met some really cool killers,/survivors in the game the toxic ones are just the loudest.
---
This shit happens pretty often after the last update. I rememeber one particular Hag dropping me to the ground to go check nearby surroundings for a hook she can actually reach.
---
The totems in Hawkings Lab are so well hidden that when I used Devour Hope on that map, even I couldn't find the totem
---
It's not up to devs to punish face camping. it's up to the other players. Don't play into the killer. Just do the gens and escape. There's no pressure on you so why the fuck are you all wasting time trading hooks, or even worse, standing near the hook, making it so the killer doesn't even lose chaser points.
---
The killer won't rank up or even take any points from the match if they face camp against survivors that know how to act
---
Absolutely not
---
Since you love quoting the devs too much, you should look up how they said how they are never going to touch NOED. 
---
Just cleanse totems. You get 1000 bloodpoints, they take 15 seconds, and now you get insta-heals if you bring Inner strength. The devs are BEGGING you to do totems. 3/5 times I DO decide to use NOED, it doesn‚Äôt even activate.
---
She invented fainting on television while wearing green and the Statue of Liberty's crown, I mean...QUEEN
---
Actually. Neither Clown's gas nor Freddy's snares "prevent fast vaults"
---
They lower your speed.
---
You can't fast vault the window when not running at full speed.
---
Not being able to fast vault is caused by being slowed, not prevented by the trap/gas effect
---
That map needs clearer indicators for generators. 
---
It does have those partially functioning gates next to them that open when you finish the generator, but first of all not all of the gens are located close to one, and second of all these gates are way less visible due to many tight corridors.
---
As much as I hate the rest of the map, The Game does a way better job of that. You can see the closed gates from far away and you 100% know there is a gen close to that, and the bathroom gen is always in the same spot, as opposed to the random location of the portal room generator.
---
Honestly the demogorgon looks so weird with the p3 on him it doesn't even look like blood more so Jelly
---
What do you expect? A round of expert mine sweeper to cleanse a totem?
---
It's a 14 seconds cleanse, and at least you got to look around to find the totems, they are already far more entertaining than gens.
---
Wanna be a dick killer deal with the consequences
---
but srsly I hate farming killers. I always rush the gens, open the gate and escape ASAP when that shit happens.
---
if you wanted to waste everyone's time, do that somewhere else. I only have 2 hours a day to play some DBD and I want to spend it on actually playing the game.
---
I'm only a survivor main because I don't have patience for the P3 50 Squadettes all running meta perks at rank 14 to bother playing killer, and it was against a trapper on the Hawkins map.
---
Both Killers and Survivors struggle with toxic and sweaty meta abusers unfortunately. But the devs honestly do not care. As long as they sell DLC and cosmetics they don't need to balance the game because money makes people lazy.
---
I do cleanse totems heavily.  Run small game too to punish reliance on noed crutch.  You don't have to tell me to cleanse totems.  Also I never once asked them to rework noed so lack of context with your response.  I agree it will never directly get touched.  Babykillers that rely on it would be outraged.  There are a lot of players that can't play without it.  Instead devs will probably continue what they started with the bloodpoint and emblem change to totems and Inner Strength and will just try to incentivize survivors to cleanse dulls instead to promote a secondary objective to help slow the gens down.

---
Tag the post as spoiler and just share the details.
---
Carrie Chloe ver? Gonna be too hot
---
I agree. I bought all previous killers as they came out just so that I can have all teachable perks on killers that I play right away, even if I didn't like playing as that killer.
---
Not feeling like buying this one at all, as I don't see using any of these in any scenario. MAYBE surge can be useful combined with surveillance if they buffed the measly 8%, other perks are just complete shit. 
---
Probably waiting for shrine to pick these up eventually.
---
Honestly man it doesn‚Äôt matter. NOED and the hatch will never get touched or reworked significantly. Why get angry about it? 
---
You win some and you lose some
---
Imagine if he had a slow mode where he moves at like 105% speed or something, but generators within his terror radius would explode and regress due to the tremble caused by his huge ass steps!
---
Easy save up a bunch of shards to repurchase perks you already got  and save up 1 million
---
The balloon and sound files were found in Fortnite though. Still, I remember Stranger Things collaborating with Fortnite before the new chapter was announced for DBD. So I would say it is very likely that the next killer is indeed Pennywise.
---
Thank you!  Couldn't remember quite right.
---
Has dead end rooms...
---
Definitely survivor friendly...
---
Something doesn‚Äôt match up there my man.
---
Self care takes 32 seconds. Healing a teammate takes 16 seconds. It's literally the same amount of time being spent.
---
I play for fun and to be thrilled getting a bit scared, this game just isn't fun anymore.
---
what console?
---
Deliverance + Decisive Strike = ez escape from campers
---
Was at my dads playing once. Had a killer game not going so well, but I‚Äôm like hey I‚Äôll push through. Cat tried to jump up on the tv unit and as she did, she stood on the PS4 power button by mistake. Killed the game I was in. All 4 survivors messaged me some severe salt.
---
Portal?
---
I don't care as much about getting a ton of points, for the most part I don't get to do anything because either the killer just tunnels and camps or there's Ruin and rng decides that I need back to back skill checks.
---
its been offered free for ps+ before im not sure if theyd do it again but... stranger things have happened..... ayooooo
---
I'd say it attracted a decent amount of new players because I've been getting a lot of boobies lately well more so then usual but I doubt alot of them will stay considering how toxic this community is, the grind etc
---
I don‚Äôt think I have ever saw a repeat as a ps plus game before as well
---
I like this perk. Strong but not completely broken. Amazing work my friend!
---
Show us your cosplay, bud
---
day of launch on pc it went from around 14k to 40k players concurrently. different times of the day change those numbers drastically though but i dont know about consoles.
---
Very fun game and a lot of the characters can be unlocked for free through playtime which is good.  Bloodweb progression feels good.  Tons of loadouts and addons to mess with for each of the characters.  What makes the game extremely enjoyable is putting the effort into learning how to properly play your sideman. For survivor learn how to run a killer, hit skill checks and make smart intelligent hook saves.  For killer learn how to apply map pressure and end chases efficiently.  The more you learn the more fun and less frustration you'll have in game.
---
The server is hosted by the killer (you), i dont know but they *could* have been crashing your I.P with an upload flood.
---
yea and i highly doubt they would right after a chapter release because they want all the money they can get and its already on sale right now on ps4
---
So many Hecks when I see ggez
---
I've learned to rather hook one time less than one time too many the hard way too. Sometimes you just lose count and if I'm not sure I'll just not risk it.
---
There are times I'll just not feel like farming so I just go do my thing (gens) and try to avoid the Killer as I usually would. Doesn't mean I didn't get it ^^
---
Or if the Killer plays favourites and keeps disrupting me to give the points to someone else, I'll stop farming and good luck finding me again for the rest of those hook points.
---
(Happened often enough that I'll find the hex totem and the Killer will pull me off but let others finish it, same with unhooks)
---
Will this include the controversial "Camping is a Valid Strategy"?
---
All you have to do is put on a jacket and paint a mask. All the lEgIoN cosplayers who think they worked so hard on their cosplays LUL
---
Ahh the notorious '3 perks killer' argument. That's it boys, pack your bags, the perk is balanced because killer has 3 perks.
---
Let's see your painted mask, bud
---
No, but I'm sure you want to be good at the game. And you want to have fun. And you want to make a lot of bloodpoints.
---
Go ahead and camp, but you won't get better at the game. And you won't have fun. And you won't make as many bloodpoints.
---
So... *shrug* do whatever you want I guess
---
How was that a dick, everyone was on hooks she just got a lucky 4%
---
Dead by Daylight: Heroic Mode
---
So that‚Äôs where the meme is from
---
Offerings add points at the end of the match, so you should take them for stuff you're good at 
---
(example, one that gives +100% in Objective, if you get to the cap \[8k\], you'll get 16k from that category)
---
Perks other than BBQ and WGLF increase the gains, so you should take them for stuff you're bad at 
---
(example, Distressing increases Deviousness by +100%, so instead of getting 300 per Doctor's shock, you get 600, making it easier to reach the 8k cap, but you can still only take out 8k out of that)
---
offerings go over the cap
---
perks (other than WGLF and BBQ) don't
---
Bruh. hes fun af
---
It happens. Don't think too much about it.
---
Enjoy your ban.
---
Yeah was never sure on the offerings. Thanks as well
---
Cool, but tokens are unnecessary. 
---
The effect is pretty fuckin' neat, so I'd want this going off constantly. 
---
Having to hook a guy is enough of a restriction.
---
I heard about the game before, but i never tried it, strategic games are more my type. But I really enjoy the show so i started playing last week before the DLC so i could get some practice in. Overall I‚Äôm staying but I‚Äôm quite bad lol
---
&gt;Cruel Limits:
---
Your ties to the otherworldly manifest when your prey attempts to get away.
---
&gt;Each time a Generator is repaired, all Windows and vault locations within a radius of 32 metres from the completed Generator are blocked for all Survivors for the next 30/45/60 seconds.
---
This is honestly so overkill. The perk has got me killed several times already. Buffing range and duration would be absurd.
---
asshole...
---
I like your idea mate. It makes a lot of sense for the survivors to already have a trap when the trial begins. I also love how you even incorporated the sabotage and hangsman perks to this, making those dead things somewhat relevant.
---
The El and 8 episode is one of the most hated episode in the show (and S2 is considered weak)
---
"I have osteoporosis"
---
This is actually some great stuff. Also the rarity of the item you sacrifice and the condition could be taken into account. ‚ÄúI (the entity) want a flashlight‚Äù ok well a gray one will let you cleanse over 30 seconds, a yellow one over 20, green over 10, a red instantly cleanses. If it‚Äôs half used then it takes longer. Etc.
---
According to the description undetectable just blocks aura reading (and removes terror radius and red light (I heard about it removing jump scare sound too, dunno if that went through)).
---
This means that premonition and spine chill should still work (except for Meyers t1 who is immune to all detection perks).
---
Good killers dont use noed
---
Undetectable stops aura reading too, which is the main new thing.
---
Oblivious is the survivor status which mess purely with terror radius
---
Ok , thanks
---
I dunno. Huntress' perks are pretty ass.
---
u lost what?
---
how u have cells without the brain?
---
lmao
---
It should be 30 seconds after you stop repairing, but the affect should be for the entire duration of the repair.
---
i agree
---
the game is only for swf idiots
---
Is that true? Leatherface sure didn't seem scared in the movies lmao.
---
Good one man. If ur gonna complain at least fix ur typing errors so people can actually read and understand it.
---
This game isn't for casuals, which I try to be myself. It's far worse for Killers if you don't run the meta perks since the objective is so easy to do that it sends people who suck at chases up the ranks because they can hold a single button for a minute straight.
---
use a translator lmao
---
Working fine on mine, on the main menu.
---
The fuck....?
---
On a real note why does Nancy look like a heroine addict her face is so sucked in.
---
It's not even abuse. It's just what happens in a game with perks. Some will be better than others, and if you use anything but those perks, you'll struggle.
---
YES
---
There's a special place in hell for people like this
---
He left the others for dead...
---
Nope. All blocking does is prevent you from getting messages or friend requests.
---
If they've done something against the terms of service then you would need to report them in addition to blocking them - at least that way there's a chance that Sony might take action against their account.
---
With balanced yes it‚Äôs more manageable but I‚Äôd still argue it‚Äôs the only killer sided map and the best one for killers in my opinion. You can patrol all the gens very quickly which is such a strong thing for killers, you aren‚Äôt gonna randomly lose a gen across the map you had no idea was being done. Yes there are a few unmindgameable pallets but you can force them down and after that there are many mindgameable. No crazy jungle gyms, no infinites.  The totem spawns are also some of the best. The only thing I can think that favours survivors is the exit gate spawns but the amount of killer games I‚Äôve seen won on that map compared to others is a large difference. Just my opinion though, I know the game is bad for some killers and some people in general just don‚Äôt like the map
---
Whatever the amount is, it's not enough.
---
I'm just using abuse as a way to make it sound worse honestly. I know Meta is Meta for a reason but it sounds dirtier when you add abuse.
---
It's not just Demo. It's game wide. Frames randomly drop, game crashes, people get booted from the game.
---
He definitely glitched over/behind the Exit gates. Happened to me before. I depipped lol
---
I played that map with killer yesterday, it's a nightmare lmao
---
The idea of rework does not need to be convoluted or cripple the perk too much. If devs feel lazy they can simply make it so that everyone knows the perk is in-game when it activates. Devs are also reworking the totem spawns consistently, for example, Badham and the new map has the best totem locations and many of the old maps already have decent spawns as well. 
---
What stops them from giving us a totem counter in the hud? That is one of many benefits that separate solo from SWF, information. Alternatively, we could get the totem HUD once the last generator is completed, that way, survivors who feel confident can go and look for remaining totems for extra BP, that gives some extra time for the killer.
---
I will only buy young Stephen King on crack. Thank you very much.

I would love to see someone make tarot cards out of these!
---
I actually really like legion just cause jogging around with a knife knowing where everyone is can be pretty fun
---
The devs has said with the current servers its difficult to pin down the reason as to why a connection is lost, once dedicated servers are up they will have the tools to punish people more appropriately for disconnecting.
---
I mean it's the right play when they can't find the totem fast
---
Is there a visual difference between the real Dweard and the alternative they made?
---
I'm also on ps4, playing both killer and survivor. Seen a few newbies around but 2 days into the dlc and my wait times for lobbies are just about the same. On release day I got lobbies instantly, had loads of players around.
---
aha that was me xx
---
In that day no one got a thumbs up :(
---
Do you have an NVIDIA graphics card per chance? If so, you can fix the hair in no time! 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d691n6/how_to_fix_ugly_looking_hair_on_low_graphics/
---
And people still complain about hexes when they dont do totems.
---
Forget SC. Yes, in one of 5 or 10 games it would've probably saved your life but you spend 32 seconds healing while the killer is chasing someone, instead, it's better to have a medkit with enough for 2 heals.
---
Doing what?
---
That's a weird way to spell Jack Torrance
---
They mean the free extra cosmetic you get from purchasing the characters in the DLC together, not separately. For Steve and Nancy you get slightly ripped variants of their default outfits. Demo gets nothing.
---
Literally stood in a fucking lobby for 20 minutes, then another 10 minutes of having 3 people in a lobby waiting readied up for the fourth and then I thought well my fuxking lobby is bugged so I just thought I'll bite the bullet and reload the lobby but then it made my PC crash and I can't turn it back on. Thanks BHVR.
---
Doesn't change the fact that if those 3 perks won't make it for the killer the 4th perk will finish the job easily.   I haven't been using that perk since infinities were gone because it only awards bad killers and it's unfair for the survivors to get punished for facing a shitty killer who can't secure a kill or two before the game is over.
---
Its odd, I've never had queues this quick for killer on chapter release?!
---
&gt; But we already have a clown 
---
I mean, you are not wrong and a "The Shinning" DLC would be cool and all but... Hillbilly and Leatherface both exist.
---
It was just a plain black hoodie off of amazon! I painted the design on it with fabric paint :D
---
Dude what? Are you illegally blind or something?
---
Crazy aye üòû
---
When the hag gets her first hit on you then casually saunters off to place more traps, you know you're gonna have a rough game.
---
More like genrush
---
Oh, I didn't know about that. I bought them all with auric cells. Well, the torn sweater and shirt cosmetics don't look like anything special.
---
I didnt say it was hard :p it actually wasnt that hard at all lol, the most difficult part was making the knife
---
This.
---
That's actually such a common situation. Some survs are so jumpy and use a drop down the moment they hear a heartbeat without checking surroundings. I mean, sure, when heartbeat tells you that killer is basically 2 meters away is scary, but sometimes it means he's right UNDER you.
---
I'm not sure who the original uploader is. I found it on a meme twitter account.
---
This is NOT true, survivors CAN lag switch here is a post where devs confirmed it, OP could have ran into this problem. 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/41035/lag-switching-bannable-laggy-survivors-fine
---
Totally agree, it's a perfect perk for killers like wraith who only hit survivors with basic attacks
---
This happened 6 games in a row to me.
---
I wish i knew, this is actually getting old, and if they arn't rank 2 or 3 they have Adrenaline Seriously if there was ever a time for that perk to get nerfed into the fucking dirt, and I mean SUPLEXED into the dirt its when the Nancy on Day.....2 Has it and its considered top tier.
---
I didn't know what to do we figured out he was lag switching earlier hence the early spin... Didn't help much at all
---
Calling someone a Pedo with no proof is a very nice and big brain thing. Hate his content if you like, hell, I do too, but don't make up such fucking bullshit and don't spread it with no fucking proof wtf
---
Unintended facecamp 0/
---
Wait, really? And here I was, thinking nvidia settings on two copies of the same game were going to be exactly the same.
---
[Comparison picture](https://i.imgur.com/rQ7Bhcg.jpg) - this is what I see.
---
Already made me quit, fuck these degenerate cunts. I'm glad I didn't waste money on this bullshit.
---
.
---
only just changing dying light to not encourage tunneling, the ability to sandbag people(to be fair I can't think of a way to fix this off the top of my head), no repercussions for dcing. These are just some things off the top of my head.
---
The old mechanic was basically a really long unhook. You'd have to do it uninterrupted so it was insanely difficult to rescue by yourself.

---
Prestige flairs are now available. :)
---
Faster walk speed. Could be interesting Vs spirit
---
&gt; Well its not unfair, the perk is just really good if the killer gets it active. 
---
Majority of perks are really good when they are active, NOED is straight-up broken and gives a free kill or two. 
---
&gt; I know how stupid that sounds ¬´JusT Do ToTemS¬ª, but really, thats it. 
---
How is that not an OP counter for a 'possibility' of NOED? Do you really get a chance to wander around the map every game and 'just do totems'? Or pray that your teammates will also 'just do totems'? 
---
&gt; Also, if you dont mind me asking, what is your rank? 
---
I do mind. I'm not here complaining about the perk because it affects me per se or that I see it often. I stand for the balance and this perk shift the scale a shit ton. Why do you think I keep mentioning 'bad killers'? I don't see NOED at higher ranks because the majority of those killers are able to finish the game before last-gen pops. For your information, I've been playing this game since day 1 and I've spent just as much time on this Reddit as I did in-game.
---
I think they need dedicated servers for dc penalties
---
Just to check - I'm assuming that these perks don't go together. I.e. The bonus carrying over from walking to crouching. (Because they both increase the speed of the walking type independently).
---
That's only temporary. Once the free weekend ends and you don't buy the game, you're not allowed to wear it anymore.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve experienced it a few times. It‚Äôs just such cheap move
---
exactly
---
Fotage from S1e8
---
What happened?
---
Yeah this is how i first noticed it, spinning the camera around while working on a gen.
---
It pauses exhaustion while the survivor is on a gen.
---
So if you go on a gen with 20 seconds recovery left, it stays paused at 20 seconds, then stays paused for 3 after they leave a gen. So after 3 seconds, the survivor would still need to wait 20 seconds to recover their exhaustion. So the survivors have a choice, do the gen and dont recover exhaustion, or recover exhaustion first but then they cant touch the gen if its below 50%.
---
I think a lot of people misunderstand this.
---
Surge is pretty crap, and cruel confinement is too situational. I‚Äôd actually consider mindbreaker the better of the 3 perks
---
I Dont need sleep i need anwsers DO IT
---
Less than 10k on a killer on rank 20, seems about right.
---
Ah ok, thank you!
---
Rank 14?
---
Haddonfield i take it? It has some texture glitches or whatever currently causing holes on ground which can teleport you to the exit gates.
---
If it was on sale, wouldn't that put her on the losing end since it's a competition about the most expensive cosmetic?
---
Aren't perks already mods?
---
Own Deathgarden
---
I agree. Dbd has become actually depressing gameplay wise (That is if you actually get to play)
---
. Idk what it is, it just feels so dead and blank..
---
Obviously camped if your points are that low with 3 kills. Play for points not for kills, it'll make the game more fun for you and everyone else
---
Your parents must be very proud of your accomplishment
---
This is the exact same way on xbox. Devs dont care about console players when they look at stabilizing their game.
---
Maybe I didn‚Äôt explained good. I mean like community mods that add things to the game, new gamemodes, killers or maps, like some other games have.
---
I didnt camp at all.
---
Can someone give me original picture please?
---
It takes 80 seconds for one survivor to do a generator and with two it cuts the time into half etc etc all generator information is on the DBD wiki
---
tried and it didn't work sadly. he says he can get into a lobby now but before the game starts and countdown begins he gets the error again. slow progress i guess, lol. thanks for trying though!
---
Oooh, that would be pretty cool. But it would work only work in a custom game
---
None of these options actually do anything. They are purely for placebo effect.
---
Yea sure, kinda like call of duty community maps or stuff like that.
---
Same way on xbox
---
Never hooked a single person actually, Nor hit them.
---
I loaded up the game to have some fun and just chainsaw across the maps and play as erracticly as I could. Ended up getting sent to Hawkins underground lab. So I decided to just chase people around the map revving my engines the entire time. Opened up the escape for em and then we just hung out till collapse happened. I was expecting them to leave, not really sure why they didnt. 
---
I have mainly played huntress and nurse for the week I've been playing the game. Catching up to people in this rank is just super easy with billy so I was just screwing around cause I'm so used to how slow hunt and nurse are lol.
---
A joke
---
Some good tips :)
---
&gt; while saving you the time required to go round kicking gens
---
Kicking gens is a waste of time 99% time anyway (unless you got Pop or some other gen perk).
---
Be shootin, be tootin, but most importantly; _be kind_
---
My bad
---
Too accurate
---
Of course not, even harder on a multiplayer game, but instead of releasing killers with the same abilities they could work on it.
---
I'm saying when I'm playing killers that aren't good, such as wraith and bubba
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d6c4ta/fps_drop_in_dreamworld/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
DbD is one of those games were we need some sort of experience/skill based MM, because it doesn't work otherwise. If it was 10 survivors vs 4 killers in a free for all it would be different, but not when it's 4 sweaty fucks vs 1 baby who installed half an hour ago.
---
Maybe your right, but I completely disagree about survivors not getting meta perks in years, mettle of man is one of the most recent ones that had to be changed because of how unfair and strong it was. Imo I really think inner strength is going to become meta combine it with perks like head on quick and quiet small game, decisive strike, and you will be able to stay alive more effectively. But I guess time will tell if I‚Äôm wrong and your right.
---
That's pretty much Freddy but as pig xD  instead of sleep, the trap activates
---
The demogorgon is creating holes in reality smh
---
Right.  And even though I play survivor just about exclusively, I don't wanna be matched with people much higher than me or the killer.  Yeah, I like winning (because bloodpoints), but it feels a little cheap when you know it's just because the weight of experience is on your team's side.  Not that you guys are playing well that day, cooperating effectively, etc.
---
Yeah it can put a bit of a sour note on playing killer when you're trying to learn the game and survivors go out of their way to try and troll you. 
---
Like obviously I'm shit, no need to rub it in dude.
---
Salmonella is pretty scary...
---
To me Nancy looks pretty spot on. I will admit that when she opens her mouth during some animations she looks like she is the next killer, but other than that she looks pretty good imo. Her voice doesn't sound like Nancy, but it isn't a bad voice job so I'm letting that slide.
---
The Jester
---
Do the devs actually read this forum? I don't disagree and I am all for giving feedback but are we all just spitting in the wind on here?
---
Batter up.
---
I don‚Äôt know how people even bother to play the game at that point. As much as I enjoy the game, I wouldn‚Äôt be waiting 15 minutes for a lobby.
---
Next let's add a stealth killer that has actual map pressure with high mobility instead of Myers 2.0
---
That's some dirty foreskin
---
Yes, and you call them "balanced offerings" despite the fact that they are obviously ebony moris...
---
Definitely rank 12. I mean, I've been playing a fair bit, but I'm only player level 
---
What I mean by boosting is more with high rank players routing the killer, it's a lot easier for me to get a lot of objective and altruism score up. Survival happens more often than not because I have good teammates, and I even get more evader than I usually would because I'm more likely to survive chases with other teammates baiting the killer to follow them. 
---
It does lead to me getting tunneled by some, but over all I do quite well purely because I've got really good teammates.
---
Ps4 player, playing killer has shown lower framerates then usual
---
?
---
It bloody annoying that for sure they basically get the lowest of their friend to play and then killers have to put up with this kind of bullcrap
---
If they make rule set 2 apart of her kit then this would be an excellent rework for that addon, rule set 2 could begin all survivors with RBT's on their heads.
---
I‚Äôve played some good hags but the demo feels like they have better shut down then the hag. I‚Äôm not buying new killers atm so idk how the demos teleport works exactly but it seems to control the flow of movement better than the hag on a lot of maps.
---
That's kinda the point of ultra rares, my dude. They add a bit extra power in a transformative way to make different play styles.
---
We have a shit ton of masked killers, two killers that eat people alive, and two hospital workers, a second clown wouldn't be to bad
---
 That was the most fustrating part for me as well.. I did the achievment 5-6 times (with last people dcing while moried) before actually obtaining it. Thankfully its the only achiev in the game that does require for noone to dc to get it. 
---
CHeers
---
when Steve (Minecraft) gets hooked:
---
*extended Minecraft death noise*
---
This is a very interesting perk concept!
---
Needs fixing it's just stupid, makes newer players less likely to play if people are abusing this system.
---
That was too strong.
---
If we both delete our comments (my question mark, this comment, and your explanation), then it'll be funny again!
---
They're supposed to be an enhancer to the power not a mixture of the clown, the doctor, and Billy
---
Adept Killer achievements require no early DCs :)
---
Or they could just flat out make this whole suggestion pigs rework entirely. That would also be cool.
---
Sis what?????
---
I was gonna say this is pretty op but huntress still has iridescent head so I'm not even mad
---
It‚Äôs just SO high pitched...
---
Nobody *has* to express any frustration on people who have nothing to do with the reason they're frustrated. I don't go out of my way to bully every survivor team I face  just because four sweaty fucks gave me a shit game. But I guess expecting maturity in this day and age is a bit too much to ask.
---
Would be nice if people played this game to have fun, instead of as a bullshit ego trip.
---
I've opted to play very stealthy. I'm happy to get a 0 chase score if it means I get plenty of play time and have fun.
---
That's the best thing about that map. Unfortunately it's a matter of time till the survivors get used to the common places where they spawn...
---
Once you Reach level 50, you may choose at any time to prestige or stay level 50. When you prestige, your level is set back to 1 and you lose all of your perks, add-ons, and offerings. However, you get a special bloody cosmetic piece each time, and which piece you get depends on if you prestige once, twice, or three times. Wearing the full prestige is like the ultimate way to say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fuck with me or you‚Äôre gonna have a really bad time‚Äù.
---
I know I feel like if the survivors a bit more higher ranks they should go into lobbies with a higher rank instead of the default rank
---
DON'T GIVE THEM THE FUCKING IDEA!!!!
---
Demogorgon traps are not meant to be used in chases. Hag's are.
---
I'm still in the game lol
---
Idk bout u but he is actually terrifying to play against
---
I keep getting matched with babies and toxic SWFs, and it‚Äôs really hard to tell which is which. Yesterday, I thought I was matched up against a toxic SWF, so I went Nurse. They were all babies. And I crushed them.
---
Is this a baby Steve post?
---
Here‚Äôs a clue.  On indoor maps like Lery‚Äôs and The Game, even Hawkins, there‚Äôs literal signs hanging from the ceilings that show you‚Äôre heading to the exit.
---
The gates look great tho
---
Same! I was runing a meme-no mither sabotage build in a custom game, and my friend still couldnt like complete 3 gens even though I kept wiggling but he still didn't complete 3, and I took the hatch
---
Steve needs his bat!
---
Damn that nancy jacket is nice completely forgot it existed
---
All I see is a mosaic
---
Yes I love it.
---
Well, that's just like, your opinion, man.
---
I know right.
---
Emblem system and reduced points, no stacks for  farming teammates was not always a thing. They are inefficient with many changes that's true.
---
I haven't heard about it but if that's true then I can't wait :)
---
I got into a game yesterday and a couple of them were super good players so I got laser focused and started mindgaming really hard and ended up getting the 4k.
---
Turns out only two of them were good and the other two were rank 20s with only one perk slot. I had to message them directly on Steam and apologize
---
Wish that were true. We did a match earlier, new map, all spawned together, all around a totem not 5 feet from gen buried in boxes in the corner of a hallway. It can happen. Probably rarer, but yeah.
---
I've made a quick screenshot guide here: https://imgur.com/a/HxrYaMX
---
Also whenever the killer has a different type of internet then you, the game literally softlocks you.
---
There's a problem with this
---
1. If it doesn't show one of the survivors in the bottom left being in hooked status, everyone will see through the ruse
---
2. If the above point is true, then if a survivor gets "fake hooked" and you see them next to you, that perk becomes useless for the round (especially with SWF)
---
Thanks! That's what I was hoping to go for.
---
Its more useful than the built-in Windows Troubleshooter.
---
10 bucks is a lot of money which is why I have only invested in Jane outfits since she‚Äôs my main AND I made it a point to purposely not buy all of her cosmetics so I don‚Äôt feel pressured to complete her collection. Everything else has either been for charity, events, and shards. I have also bought Scoops, Nancy outfit, Biker Kate and Leather Piggy but those were exceptional. I got Nancy‚Äôs because I plan on maining her too.

I wanted to be a legion main, but the world turned me into a spirit main :(
---
I'm a soloq survivor main(Red/purple every season). What's wrong with noed? It limits the killer too three perks during the match,  and it has a high chance of not even being activated. People say it rewards the killer for losing, but no it doesn't. Id say the killer I'm playing has noed 1/5 games. 1/5 noed times it kills me, 2/5 I don't die when exposed bc I can extend a chase enough to get the exits powered. 3/5 it gets cleansed. 
---
Why do you guys think it's broken?
---
Then you haven‚Äôt played much League in those 6 years
---
I bought DBD and F13 around the same time in 2017. Always liked F13 more and occasionally played DBD, F13 got boring after a while and I realized that DBD had more diversity so now I‚Äôm back playing
---
We don't have emojis yet. We'd have to resize and save each flair individually to add them as emojis for reddit redesign. Which is one of many reasons why we don't support the redesign so far.
---
seems kind of interesting but i dont ever see it being strong enough to be worth running, plus SWF exists  
---
even without that, you'd see where the survivor went down (unless they use knock out lul) and be able to deduce it from that, or even bond/empathy too
---
COMPLETED GENERATOR! This early in the trial, this fast with Ruin, on this side of the map, localized entirely within the killer shack?
---
Just dont hook the 5th person
---
Ez
---
I cant bring myself to buy Ahoy Steve so i guess im stuck maining Jake
---
It‚Äôs an ongoing glitch atm mate, guessing they‚Äôll patch it soon enough
---
Oops all scoops
---
And you wonder why everyone plays nurse and spirit
---
Not gonna lie, I was proud to find a single gen on that map. Ruin was up, but I physically saw a generator and almost cried
---
Our custom flairs are restricted to subreddit contributors (e.g. Developer Stream summaries by u/Spoiled_Soul), verified developers and subreddit moderators.
---
[Here's a report on it](https://appuals.com/dead-by-daylight-will-soon-punish-players-who-disconnect-during-matches/)
---
Haven't found an official statement on it except a mention at the very end of [this](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87216/status-update-dedicated-servers#Item_0)
---
Come on tell me bro
---
Hopefully
---
It's not just that, while being on this sub it appears that in general the toxicity in this game on consoles seems to be much higher
---
Well this is kinda embarrassing but I think this is very hot xD
---
They are both different killer The demogorgon can only put down a maximum of 6 portals and the hag can put down 10 and recycle through them and can also instantly teleport to them
---
Yes! I love this idea.
---
Can you at least crop you stolen meme?
---
not a level 1. Virtually useless at level 1.
---
I still think a 5th perk would be nice given swf on comms already has a massive advantage of communication
---
‚ÄúGg ez‚Äù
---
I honestly refuse to play Steve until they make him sound like he's in pain instead of being in a gay porno
---
**********BRUH**********
---
Lore wise actually yeah
---
It would be cool if survivors could like suggest a killer and if the killer plays that character they get bonus blood points or something maybe survivors can vote and if the killer picks that character 1 more gen spawns and the killer gets extra bp.
---
Him sounding like he's in a gay porno is why I switched mains...
---
&gt;Unhooking would not clear the fake aura
---
But survivors would all know that the survivor's been unhooked anyway just by looking at their health state and the fact that the **real** hooked survivor's aura would now not be visible. I'm not sure that's really a meaningful addition to the perk, unless the perk also messes with the UI to prevent players from knowing anything about a player being unhooked.
---
I mean, I think it's more when you hook someone it shows them in two places at once
---
That's not very Christian of you
---
The only problem with flashlights, if they can use them to make you drop a survivor as soon as you pick them up
---
I didn‚Äôt say they should be though did I? The OP of this comment asked how they are meant to get good as Killer playing against higher ranked Survivors and so I explained how. 
---
Matchmaking has and always will be messed up. It‚Äôs been like this almost a year, players need to accept it. There‚Äôs literally a dozen posts a day on this sub about it.
---
That's some Alan Wake shit right here!
---
Id say make it so the chainsaw is only audible when within 24m and cannot be heard beyond that range. Completely silent sound tiny bit OP since they dont have any time to react.
---
If you don‚Äôt have bl then your hopeless. There is only one part where you can have a prolong chase, and even then it‚Äôs too good for survivors with bl.Each pallet is so unsafe and short that if it‚Äôs a decent killer they would just go against the teams weakest member to get rid of the pallets. Good luck finding gens  on that map, much less totems
---
Imagine getting tbagged by Steve
---
Wow I was just saying. And yes it will probably always suck in this game as will a lot of things but it seems to be getting worse instead of better and at a time when a lot of new players will be joining us it's very unfortunate as it will most likely turn a lot of them away.
---
Didn't the devs say they'd like to add Springtrap ages ago?
---
I couldn‚Äôt think of a better name for my Reddit and I main Myers.
---
Just bend over and let it happen.
---
I tried to reinstall the game but it didn't help I think it's a bug because some people on forums are reporting it too.
---
Why would you ever want to go against billy
---
Try 4.
---
Just don‚Äôt use dying light right now until they fix it.

It isn't immune to flashlights, no. I managed to get 1-2 flashlight saves against it yesterday.
---
Do you have a clip of your save? Maybe your timing was off?
---
If you get the inverted controls, hit the button with the two squares
---
This is a great idea for an add-on, but I don't think it's for Billy. This should be for Legion.
---
Already happening lol
---
No. Upvote is a medkit :D
---
Mostly it's just too mess with people who aren't paying attention, and to allow for the killer to have 2 fake hooks out if they grab another down fast enough. 
---
I've been guilty of watching a video while playing and running towards a hook that's already been dealt with. Auto piloting survivors are a thing.

I mean, a lot of them are unsafe, but if survs have urban invasion it's pure hell, not counting that hillbilly, bubba and a lot of othera will be unplayable. Rip
---
To be honest I hope it's either Pennywise or Carrie although I would'nt mind Johnny or some of his other characters as killers
---
Yeet
---
Yeah me too, I quit overwatch a while ago. I used to be a zenyetta main and nutcracker was also my favorite
---
My first game wanted to play doctor. 
---
Ended up against level 10s bodyblocking and gen rushing my no perk having ass. 
---
Stared at a wall and cried when they butt danced at the gate
---
Take out their bloodpoints if they decide to play like that. No one gives a shit about emblems
---
I‚Äôm not sure, I kinda fell out of dead by daylight awhile back but I always like to check up on the game lol.
---
I got my Brazil shirt for $200 last year. That shit is $900-$1,500 now. It's insane.
---
Oh, the killer is meant to be all polite and loving is it? Give me a break. The killer should be perceived as a threat.
---
 [spolier]You get what you get and you don't get upset. [/spolier]
---
Genrushing and tunneling hex? Hahaha please create more of these imaginary mechanics.
---
Yeah let's buff even more a top tier killer that can insta down you at any time, also while we're at it let's nerf pig even more and remove her ability to walk.
---
And technically "It" it's not a clown.
---
It would be cool if he could change form.
---
Theres space for only one Steve
---
Would never happen.
---
Likely Iridescent add-ons:
---
Iridescent Chain - Chainsaw Sprint is not ended when colluding with a dropped pallet. Slightly reduced chainsaw movement speed.
---
Hardened Hull - Tremendously reduced penalty when colliding with objects during Chainsaw Sprint.
---
Demogorgon: CONFUSED SCREECHING
---
Boy would it be fun but do nothing but spend time trying to get that shit to deactivate all game!

Survivors get points slower than killers so it'll take more time if you strictly play them. The game is grindy but once you get some perks and know how to get points it gets better plus they just made the perks easier to get with this update. As for dlc you can get packs or single characters separately to save money but you'll miss out on the packs cosmetics. Say you wanted the stranger things dlc that's gonna be 12 bucks but say you only wanted Steve, then you can buy Steve for 5 only but just not get the other characters and same goes for everyone else.
---
The games gonna be hard at first btw so don't let it discourage you because it's very fun once you get it down and learn to survive or kill
---
Yeah gens still a Hussle since they goes to fast and even the worst player can hold one button to repair.
---
Still, the best thing is learn when to slug, ruin and pop. No need more things to slow the gens, focus on the weakest member and at last for the strongest.
---
The demogorgon is really good since can catch survivors easily in the shack if they do a tiny mistake. Cut loops etc
---
Isn't the demogorgon the problem. But the core mechanics since more objectives need to be added. Nothing complicated but to make the game slightly longer
---
Same, more toxic Nea

Then I shall pray I don‚Äôt have this happen to me on Xbox. I was hopeful it was just a pc thing. Lol.
---
What's the point in only imagining the dullest most obvious ideas?
---
This is Fan content, my dude. Feel free to be more creative then stat blocks. 
---
Why not an addon that doesn't just reduce the collision penalty but reversed it? Like Billy could become a billiard ball with 3 bounces and he could try to aim off corners to get crazy angles. 
---
That's just one random idea, but it's at least fun. 
---
We do remember that this is a game right? A game we play for fun?
---
I had tutorials for the knives but unfortunately I made this stake the night before a convention. So no pictures on the progress. My instagram does have a few photos of it in action just no progress pictures: https://www.instagram.com/p/B07rigthkBi/?igshid=fw44yc6d5gzy I'll do my best to guide ya with words.
---
Materials:
---
5mm yayahan eva foam (can be purchased at joanns)
---
Box cutter
---
Masking tape
---
Welwood contact cement
---
Thin wooden sticks
---
Dremel tool
---
Pen
---
Nutmeg brown paint
---
Matte white spray paint
---
Sterling silver paint
---
Apple red paint
---
Parts:
---
Base rectangle
---
2 smaller rectangles for the sides
---
3 fake protractors
---
Process:
---
1. I started by looking at some reference photos in order to visualize the dimensions. I settled with a base rectangle with the dimensions of 2in x 14 in
---
2. Cut out the rectangle shape from your eva foam. At this point you can also cut out the shape of the side rectangles. To achieve the slant seen in the pictures cut the foam at an angle. 
---
3. Apply contact cement to the areas you want glued. Wait a minute for glue to get tacky, then slowly and carefully fuse the foam together. 
---
4. Use the dremel tool to smooth out the sides and carve out the jagged tip. 
---
5. Wrap the thin wooden sticks in a little bit of foam so they resemble protracters. Glue these on with contact cement as well. 
---
6. At this point you should spray paint the whole thing matte white. 
---
7. Use your nutmeg brown paint to make the whole stake brown and dirty looking. A cool technique to use here is dabbing paint in an area then using your finger to rub in the pigment. Its messy but it works.
---
8. Use the sterling silver to paint to protracters and wooden sticks
---
9. Wrap the top part in masking tape. 
---
10. Using a ruler mark the inches using a pen or sharpie
---
11. Mix nutmeg brown with apple red paint to make a blood like color (still looking for a better method). Then apply it liberally to any part you think would be stained with blood.
---
12. Admire your work!
---
I hope this tutorial was helpful to you! If you have any further questions dont hesitate to ask.
---
Far as I can remember it was him and the turtle since the beginning of time and there was literally nothing else. I always found that confusing because he didn't seem all that powerful, or even very needy. In all the universe he sat in one time in one state in one country and ate a couple of kids every 27 years or so. Not too much of a sacrifice for the ultimate evil if you ask me. But it's been a while since I read the book. The underage gangbang really put me off King a while.

Carrie wasn't really a villain though she I dont think she'd work. She just snaps from all the abuse at the very end.
---
Jack Torrance would work but I'd imagine he'd just be a legion clone.
---
Pennywise is essentially an immortal god like the entity so itd be weird if he was captured by the entity but hes the one I feel like would work best. Especially if he could shapeshift and use balloons to float above people and stuff.

Yeah I have a much more powerful pc build than I need for dbd but still my game will freeze up often. The screen will still move and I can still hear the noises coming from the game/ when I press buttons but none of the buttons highlight when I hover over them or do anything and I always have to restart my pc to fix the issue because It won‚Äôt even let me close out of the game
---
Since I hate the new DLC, this might actually be really good.
---
It is tough to get around the place
---
They are free it's called 9k shards deal with it some people had to buy them by earning them with shards you're no different play the game to get better stuff
---
Just did a bit of research and I am right. Apparently they remain separate and don't play into each other.
---
But a bunch of legions running towards you isn't scary, after the first feral frenzy effect they kinda lose their intimidation factor. Chainsaw sprinting Billy will always be intimidating. 
---
I'll probably drop a new legion ultra rare idea soon. Fuming mixtape and the pin always felt really underwhelming to me.
---
It's probably not gonna happen the way I'm about to say it. But, it would be rather interesting if instead of his perks saying "A deep bond with the Entity," it would say something along the lines of "Your control over the trials..."
---
Killers: you guys need us! No killer! No game!. 
---
Surviviors: fix ur fucking internet then.
---
That's how it worked in ptb so I dont see why it wouldnt they are there types of movement for a survivor - running - walking - crouching. The perk will specifically mention one of the three it changes.
---
Also for exhaustion perks that increase speed they specifically just say increase movement speed rather than a specific type. So with urban evasion it specifically states crouching speed, as does the new Nancy perk states walking speed.
---
Bites your fingers off
---
They downvoted him because he told them the truth

Make the community come out with new killers
---
Last night someone got pulled off a window and DC'd before the animation was done
---
I'm confused, what for?
---
The one time I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm in console. Lol
---
Every character sounds like they're being banged. Ffs listen to Feng cleanse a totem
---
Thanks! That was the idea :D
---
Oh god I hope they don't ring pennywise to the game I will literally shit my pants when he comes towards me
---
I mean *technically* they're free on console, but you can just but them with shards
---
I guess, no thumbs for me today.
---
The rank system is 100% based on how you perform individually.  The emblems at the end of the match fill up that meter which determines if you gain a "pip" or two or you can black "pip" which means you stay the same. If you dont reach the black one you lose a "pip" (only after rank 15 or 16 though I cant remember
---
Then you need to buy some better bundle from your internet company. It's not a privilege, it's a product. If you'd rather complain about your internet rather than try to improve it, maybe you shouldn't be playing online multiplayer at all?
---
You dont need Ruin, especially at rank 20 where killer is way easier than surv. You have time to level up and unlock Hag.
---
Surge may be the worst killer perk introduced into the game from a DLC. I agree with most of this lost really. Second Wind would become a lot more reliable with a visual cue of the charge but I think that is a QOL change in the end.
---
Steve sounds... interesting... but Nancy has wonderful audio. 
---
The Demogorgon has a lot of potential as a high tier killer or at least mid-high tier. I feel like the lunge is a tad shorter than the PTB but haven‚Äôt done any tests from before to confirm. Solid DLC, hell I‚Äôd say the best so far but a lot of changes to perks and QOL features are needed
---
Yeah I'd be ok with that but he'll probably be just like every other licensed killer and come out the gate OP as fuck, get broken down to a toaster, and then worked on slowly as they rake in the cash over the next 2 years XP
---
Yes. I get pissed of when people are over a certain threshold of stupidity :)
---
You just showed you can't argue without strawmaning, so..
---
Yes, happened to me now I can hear noises and stuff, but the game itself is frozen and I can't play. I have to wait for the crash and restart it, but I'm sick of it I'll just stop playing this game so damn frustrating.
---
&gt;Interdimensional creature
---
&gt;Only abilities are to dig tunnels and lunge a bit
---
Doing gens is literally only way for survivors to win. Killers have multiple choices that doesn't include griefing players. If the killer is good enough they can pressure survivors enough that they don't complete gens. You can't prevent tunneling or camping as survivor.

Forget the game. I‚Äôm resonating emotionally with The Wraith right now. Guys I‚Äôm actually catching feels and I don‚Äôt know why.
---
Fuck.
---
yeah i feel with pennywise they have more to work with.
---
Although his lore would contradict the entity's as how can a immortal god capture an immortal god?
---
I was thinking maybe they could use the overlook hotel entity as a killer but that would be quite difficult to use as what are you gonna do with that.
---
Simply put Pennywise is easier to incorporate than most of Stephen kings other supernatural entitys and serial killers. (I doubt BHVR would add anything else but from these 2 categories of stephen king antagonists)
---
Point being?
---
*Cries in pre-rework Freddy PTSD*
---
It's a bug. BHVR was supposed to have it fixed by the time the ST chapter launched but uh...well you can tell they didnt
---
I'd legit just follow the trail.
---
"Yes daddies come at me"
---
cool steve is better than scoops
---
Yea that was my idea too, like having weird killers maybe also having funny abilities or even gamemodes like 2 killers, 8 survivors. It would be pretty cool and it can make the game more enjoyable. Kinda like they did with overwatch with the workshop maps
---
Or the devs just went to see It 2 and were checking their social media before the show and just decided to like Stephen King.
---
It kinda sound like what a farm animal would make
---
What kind of farm animal?
---
The game isn't the same now as it was then. Catchup mechanics and free DLC are very helpful in keeping an online game accessible to even newer players. And if you are competitively minded, **especially** if you are competitively minded, you **should want** for the newer players to catch up to you in a timely manner, without having to grind for months, even years. Unless you get a kick out of stomping players that have both less experience and less access to meta perks, as if you need more advantages on your side.
---
Cant wait for legion ^-^
---
Why are we talking about this? Isn't this tread about something different?
---
This is really cool, how did you make this, btw?
---
That they must be new here.

&gt;It is unknown what happened to him other than that he is no longer a Survivor in the Entity's Realm.
---
The guy i was originally referring to was Benedict baker.
---
Please dont tell me that's Jake Gyllenhall
---
Nice
---
IKR? they dont know any better so they camp and tunnel.
---
Some comments aren't.
---
No she didn't
---
It‚Äôs expensive and I don‚Äôt have a lot of options because of where I live. Jesus how many times am I gonna have to repeat it
---
Sheep and and some of them it depends on tbe species make a sort of creaking door sound
---
You should start the trial with no tokens, you only get tokens from hitting your obsession, and unhooking the fake survivor should trigger an exposed status effect to help prevent camping.
---
If nothing else, unhooking a survivor known to be fake would entice a camping killer to leave and search out the survivor who's now exposed.
---
How on earth would it work though?
---
I watched my older brother try both roles. 
---
Was I that bad?
---
I thought of a ventriloquist puppet killer, and I had a similar idea for one of their perks. I really like the idea.
---
I never understand why when I'm killer I can take a Survivor for a small walk to the mailbox then they break free. But when I'm a survivor I get took over the river and through the woods to Bubba's basement every time
---
Actual decent legion cosplay? My my this is a surprise
---
Sadly this post has been saved :)
---
Here's how to use them...
---
They look so good... I'm actually quite disturbed.
---
Don't worry my brotha, Legion buff is in the way
---
If I‚Äôm correct, my first game ever was as Hillbilly. Haven‚Äôt even touched him since. I should really give that ol‚Äô farmboy some love.

Yeah. Even I chase the other person if they both went the same way

In the second game, it sucks up all zombies toward it. So... kinda?
---
My only issue is when you look down on demo and the place a portal overlay is what is causing the issue...on my 1x that is the only issue I have otherwise the game runs real well for me
---
I know that feel. Usually once a gate is open and there's no one hooked, I just farm by setting traps or something until they leave...although I did get a spicy late game sacrifice playing Billy on Hawkins Lab; a Claudette was gloating a foot away from the exit proper and I chainsawed her and got the kill since she was dead on hook. It was beautiful.
---
Again, then maybe online games just aren't for you. Nobody wants to play with you if you have red bars ping every single game. Go back to single player games then or stop whining
---
Thanks! It's just photoshop and referencing Behavior's design style.
---
How is Demo's lunge the best in the game? Its not that hard to avoid.
---
I have an xbox one x and I've lagging a shit ton since the update. Makes zero sense, seeing that I'm connected via ethernet and I have the fastest console on the planet.... wtf
---
Hia everyone these were my first attempts at masks. I now know how to make em even better. But unfortunately haven't had a chance to remake em yet. Enjoy!
---
And this is where I instantly DC
---
Same here, except with my older brother playing survivor. He kept attempting to escape every time he was hooked and didn‚Äôt understand that he left scratch marks wherever he ran. He would only run.
---
"our icon" gurl don't speak for me.
---
I cant tell if it will grow to be annoying, every time her hits you he yells at you so angrily, stop screaming at me demigorgon
---
My partner started playing killer recently and is currently rank 20. She was bullied hard after a couple of games and hasn't played since. Being cornered by a swf with all gens done isn't fun. I've never seen survivors constantly blind a killer like that before. Feelsbadman
---
The choppiness and low frames is a console thing unfortunately that bhvr is actually working on to better optimise. I've played it on console and it is pretty rough at times particularly on certain maps and killers especially if bloodlust kicks in. As far as folks playing as spirit can you blame them? It's pretty hard playing as killers like Billy, nurse, and huntress on there as it is due to frames and spirit isn't affected by the poor frames and choppiness as those killers are pretty sure they wouldn't want to be subjected to playing weaker killers or having a rough time playing with those listed due to the poor optimization.
---
I hate when the internet is bad. I‚Äôm walking away then 5 seconds later I‚Äôm back where I‚Äôm started. Then the killer might grab me on vault when I‚Äôm long gone..
---
Stranger Things has some PRETTY mediocre perks for new players.
---
Maybe replace Surge with Pop. Also, replace BBQ with something like Unnerving. Makes skill checks a lot more difficult.
---
That perk is called stridor
---
Source?
---
I wish it did something like gave 1000 bp to the player you're giving props and you like 100
---
Really? Huh I hate it when it goes inverted so that might help
---
Some dlc packs have bonus cosmetics for when you purchase the pack instead of individual characters with auric cells
---
You could always make it that when the aura is shown the hooked survivor has a 50% chance of being moved to the aura on the second hook, would make it harder for SWF to steamroll over it
---
They dont like that its powerful.
---
Maybe, I didn't want to complicate it further so I just lest interpreting where Billy should be, as a skill challenge to catch fresher survivors.
---
Yes well i um, its... excuse me one second
---
wrong. I posted in this thread when it came up and came back for a reply to my comment I never saw. I just scrolled down further and unfortunately saw your chain of denial posts. Which is ironically exactly how you responded to me because you're in disbelief someone could dislike a douchebag like you.
---
3 gen strategy? Yeah, that would be a strong tactic for weaker killers. I want to learn how to play a good Trapper and I think Corrupt Intervention would be great for that strategy. With the recent bloodweb changes, I'll probably be able to come up with a good build for mid to late game. My biggest weakness as a killer is juggling chases with regressing gens and finding people not glued to gens.
---
Unless you‚Äôre good with hitting that small skill check, I‚Äôd go with either balanced landing or adrenaline. Keep in mind that balanced landing is hard to use on some maps because of the distance you need to fall whereas Adrenaline is an end game perk that only activates when the last gen has popped.
---
Learn how to take a screen shot or screen cap
---
It would make playing survivor way too easy so uh. No
---
Oh my god.
---
But what if... i sneak across and hit a generator and disguise it as a farm game?
---
Oh ho ho ho, delightfully devilish bubba
---
What Dwearder said
---
but just think of all the time that was waisted when all three survivors are looking for one person that is about to be one hooked
---
Keemstar?
---
Yes
---
It starts off trying to give advice but it turns into something where you soul gets crushed and you give up
---
This makes me incredibly sad. Wraith, buddy, go get 'em.
---
Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to
---
Steve lookin kinda fresh doe üò≥
---
but it takes more time to farm shards which means they have plenty of time to get the bloodpoints? poor logic.
---
Who is the artist?
---
Yeah, me too. I even open the gate if I am bored and don't wanna be farmed/bagged in some match. ^(this happens a lot.)
---
The head with smoke around it
---
I agree. The map has too much clutter and not enough pallet loops, and this is coming from someone who has *only* played killer on the map. Not to mention how the second floor is pretty much only there for fan service to Season 1, as well as a reason to make the map slightly bigger. Gens are hard to find, the pulsating sound effect from the Upside Down is way too loud and irritating, sometimes killers spawn in with missing textures (happened to me yesterday as Plague), the only reliable loops involve vaulting, and the whole place is too linear. Overall, the map is just not that good. The Stranger Things chapter as a whole has been pretty disappointing so far and really only feels like fan service to a demographic they didn‚Äôt even have until now.
---
What if I do want the answer
---
replace bloodhound for save the best for last
---
I‚Äôm absolutely shit with him but I play him because he‚Äôs fun as hell.
---
*Puts gun in mouth*
---
Fog whisperer
---
Why did you choose to loop him on the smallest side of the pallet in the beginning?
---
In a recent dev stream
---
I think the game is glitched and they're arguing who should be the one to DC to end the game
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave? You‚Äôre right though.
---
Well it's dangerous to go alone, here, take this
---
Darn, haven‚Äôt seen the movie in years
---
this just really makes me want to see videos of someone backseat gaming someone whos really bad lol
---
Yes. Absolutely. While you‚Äôre at it, get Leatherface and Of Flesh and Mud while they‚Äôre also on sale. You‚Äôll thank me later.
---
It's sad that some toxic killers have fun doing they're toxic shit. If I ever accidentally tunnel I always feel bad and try to give the last survivor the hatch.
---
Boooooooo.
---
Its a migratory pattern, the nesting season is brief and the numbers are there regardless of the predators, but when the wind changes they will all go back and you will look at the lack of livers on your plate and wonder "perhaps i should have devoured more hope?
---
Perhaps,
---
you animal
---
Anything's a legit tactic. You shouldn't let people dictate how you play. If you tunnel someone to death who you didn't like or who was giving you a hard time some people might just want to get them out of the game as soon as possible.
---
balanced landing makes the map a lot easier
---
ive used it plenty tho prolly not enough
---
Perk called head on
---
What do you mean?
---
You need the perk "Head on" for you to be able to stun them. If you don't have that it may explain some things.
---
Hag has gotta have the best Grand Hunt game, since you can just leave traps EVERYWHERE. got a really good game as Wraith yesterday on the Myers map with 3 gens close af, I could've gotten them all but let one of them get away because one of their teamates DCed and It'd shut hatch.
---
I mean we'll still get it, right? After they rework Nurses addons I think
---
Thanks, I'll try that. I just thought it was a server side issue.
---
Idc about imaginary internet dollars.
---
Dawg I hate to say it, that‚Äôs a perk called Head On. You need the perk.
---
I did rather black stuff over the screen
---
You have to be in the locker for 3 seconds before it activates. Then fast action (sprint while exiting) and it should stun the killer, as long as you aren‚Äôt exhausted
---
Oh myyyyyyyyy
---
Yup the rate at wich the gen regresses is a fucking joke tbh plus one tap and its back to normal, while you have to spend 3 secondskicking it
---
Why tho?
---
Can I hook you?
---
What if I started playing killer from nurse?
---
How about you do it? Art gets tossed around like a ball. How are we supposed to know who it is
---
Nancy is simply a fantastic  character,  and steve and demigorgon, throughout the show i was just infatuated with steve and nancy.
---
I thought you had so search every box to get the trap off. Was really surprised when I got the trap off on my first try.
---
I'd actually like to see an honor system in place. You get 2 honor tokens per match, you can honor the killer or survivors. Honors can provide a small bloodpoint percentage boost. You cannot honor your own friends. 
---
Its not much, but it could balance out the the absurd amount of insulting in this game. "Oh hey, that guy just honored me, we played well" sort of thing.
---
i have faith, would really like to play a stronger legion :p
---
I‚Äôm sure you can find it pretty cheap these days. It‚Äôs pretty much the same formula but in 2D. Which I personally found to make it harder but still a good game.
---
OMG. So this whole time I have been trying to practice I haven't had the actual tool to do it? Well now I feel even stupider. At least I can stop running directly for lockers now.
---
"Intense piano riffs sounded in his wake"
---
Ah, a man of culture, nice RWBY meme
---
Then try running enduring, it's a good all round perk no matter the level
---
Was only a couple times playing the map! I probably wasnt familiar with spot and what not.
---
They'll need Head On though yeah?
---
ormond 2.0
---
Suicided on hook? 0 survival points.
---
Funny story, I faced a baby nurse me and my friends and she opened the gate and face the wall like the wraith in this pic :( it was so heartbreaking.
---
No one has suggested to keep nerfing pig
---
Ol√©!
---
Right? I actually had a red rank tell me it was MY fault for ranking up to 13 and said that I probably played scummy to win and get that rank lmao. Like what? Imagine telling someone else they play scummy when you have 3000 hours and you're playing against someone with 20 hours. The hypocrisy went right over his head.
---
The game has too much loops is my issue
---
&gt; at least reduced in price?
---
Game is on sale like half of the time.
---
My first game was also Doctor, being in health care I felt it was fitting.
---
It was not. 
---
*cries in doctor*
---
&gt; And if you are competitively minded, especially if you are competitively minded,
---
then you don't need most of DLCs
---
"Farming" a survivor (that is, an unsafe unhook where you're doing it just for points rather than a realistic attempt at keeping the survivor alive) is considered poor form, no matter what perk you're using.
---
If you're *actually trying to save them* then the tier of the perk really makes no difference - the time doesn't start until they're hit, it pauses during the Mend action, and if they can't find somewhere safe in &gt;10 seconds then they're unlikely to do so in &gt;20.
---
Bear in mind that Borrowed Time is *not* "Unhook and run", you're expected to tank a hit and/or body block for the person you just saved - or even "trade the hook" to save yourself with Deliverance.
---
Oh no, perks. I‚Äôm so scarrrrrred
---
Lol its funny you chose gf since he is the only killer that teabags whenever he down someone
---
I realized with crawling and the speedy sonic button you crawl a little bit faster
---
Really? I never would have guessed.
---
dbds leatherface is basically just the first movie and that's it, and he's scared to disappoint his family, and now the entity, and he gets angry at the survivors for ruining his life
---
I do
---
Speedy sonic button?
---
Billy is on the back burner until new map falls off the rotation
---
Should be jack Torrance with the overlook hotel and Wendy as a survivor
---
Page 103, Article 4, Section B. A killer may not hit a survivor within 2 minutes of starting the match, doing so is an open invitation for the survivor to D/C
---
The only "rework" they need is to delete them and disable the add-on slots for Nurse.
---
I had a nurse apologize to me for being rank 20.. like.. it was their fault they got a group of high ranks, instead of the match making being broken. I felt so bad about it :(
---
Lmao! I saw Sattelizer was wearing it the other day on stream! It was hilarious
---
Thank you so much!
---
The button that makes you run
---
No kidding man. If I'm feeling thick skinned, I'll play some Wrath, but 90% of the time I'll get bullied so hard that it winds up being my last game for awhile. I bought clown awhile ago, but haven't played with it because I don't want to get mocked and bullied while I try to learn a character. Me playing bad and losing is one thing, but getting shit on all throughout by a bunch of survivors just bullying me, well I don't need that. I'm trying to have fun, and flashlighting teabags at the exit gates as four people run out is not fun.
---
i think she is A tier now
---
I understand what you're saying but I felt like you were missing my point a bit right up until the McDonald's part. Because that's exactly what I'm trying to say. This is, in effect, an unsolicited service. Technically, of course, it's not strictly "unsolicited", but the same logic applies. You wouldn't expect to be paid in the McDonald's example even if they had a sign on the wall saying "please let us know if there are any problems with the plumbing". Similarly, I don't believe that this situation demands payment because even though the service was requested, it was still essentially charity.

Yea she‚Äôs up there with billy and nurse I usually hear
---
What about the character and all my bp wasted on perks
---
Even if the game is Killer biased, it NEEDS to be, or there would be no one playing killer and we wouldn't have a game. The devs need to slant the win ratio slightly in favor of the killer to ensure people are enjoying playing killer, and join matchmaking often enough to accomodate for the huge player base of survivors. The power balance also needs to be built around the less-skilled player base, which is 95% of players. Maybe this balance falls apart at red tier where killers can perform better than intended, but red tier is not the priority.
---
You lose all your items/add-ons/offerings/perks (teachables will stay unlocked for other characters, if you got them in bloodwebs) and get bloody clothes.
---
You go to level I1 Win a bloody body and increase slightly the items quality
---
Shouldn't be the case. You can stun then when they're just walking by, that's how you do locker saves
---
Oh no that sounds horrible
---
Do it if you want, just saying my experience.
---
Perhaps, but I would feel that the inside of the hotel would take up more space of the map than the outside portion.
---
me tooi wanted to do wraith but got burned instantly and they saw me everytime.
---
combined with teabagging + flashlights i got to main nurse
---
and now from rank 19 to 9 i think it was good that i was bulied or else i would be stuck with wraith at rank 17
---
Ohhh my bad
---
"You gonna learn today!"
---
ok but can we appreciate how adorable Wraith is
---
ps4 sucks so duh
---
Ps4 matching is shit right now, I'm rank 10 with other green rank friends and it's giving us rank 19 and 20 killers and survivors
---
I don‚Äôt think I was holding that button when crawling though
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but does the surge explosion also incur the 10% regression, or does that apply only if a survivor is working on it. Does it stack with huntress lulliby? 
---
"If they fail a Skill Check, the Generator will explode and lose¬†10¬†%¬†repair progress"
---
i went up against a quadruple head on swf with flashlights on haddonfield.  THere's a rather small room with 3-4 lockers that they all piled in and hit me multiple times.  Fortunately I was playing as Billy, so I just camped the first hook I made knowing they would all come in for the saves and be promptly placed on the ground.
---
So should I get prestige?
---
Yeah he was lucky xD
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Levels#Prestige
---
wow
---
ahhh okay, well that's good to know. Thanks for the info.
---
Once you Prestige you'll start over on level 1 Claudette, lose all offerings, addons, items, and earned perks.. But you'll gain A 1 Prestige tag and a bloody cosmetic. My suggestion is use all your BP and items before you Prestige, save up as much BP and begin leveling her up again. Level up other survivors to recieve their unique perks so you can add them to your favorite character. The max is Prestige 3 Lvl 50. You get better blood web stuff. Items add ons, Bloodpoint offerings.
---
I don't really have strong opinions about it. Except it seems pretty strong for Trapper. Most of the paths are super linear and the traps work really well
---
It's good if you run bl. I guess it's on high priority cause I've gotten new map every game today in the rotation. It'll drop to 90 fps which is roughly a 20 to 30+ frame loss in comparison to other maps.
---
She is definitely top 3 killers by most of the streamers' opinions I've heard.  Looping her in a lot of places is impossible for long because her phase is so strong.
---
Exactly. Love how i'm getting downvoted for this :D
---
From what I heard they're planing so that all killers will have at least 2 ultra-rare addons. I don't know how true that is but it would be pretty cool
---
Sorry naive fanboy but not everyone is protecting ur fav streamer.
---
It's only worth doing if you want the bloody clothing cosmetic you get from it
---
The "grind" aka the OBJECTIVE other than ranking up is the only thing that keeps me playing I've got rank 1 on both killers and I own all killers most of which I purchased with shards I earned it makes it more rewarding to get a new character by earning them if you want to reduce the objective that the game offers use money
---
Dont worry, being bullied as a survivor turned me into a Legion main
---
I‚Äôm not letting a killer kill me, I‚Äôm a survivor for a reason. If they want to learn they need to play for real, but I ain‚Äôt ever going to be toxic
---
Yea that's how I made mine, but no pictures sadly. Some other subs like r/PS4 have that
---
Shut it, Private!
---
All I got as a new killer was pallets to muh teeth &amp; permanent retinal damage.
---
*Then* I have to endure squat-dancing of the testicals while generator's ping on-&amp;-on.
---
That's how it was when *I* started, Greenhorn Killers get *the same treatment*
---
Now Git Off Muh Lawn!
---
Hey, you're welcome! Did it work for you? Apparently it doesn't work for some people.
---
By any chance are you trying to use dying light? The perk crashes the game rn
---
All the dlc packs are on sale you have to be living off of food stamps if you can't afford to pay $4 for two characters if you really don't want to enjoy the feeling of accomplishment then just buy the characters
---
*Golly gee, it seems I have lost. Now I must call this player bad to make myself feel good about losing.*
---
He‚Äôs mid tier at best,
---
I did get it quite often tho, that is the problem out of my 10 games last not 4 of them were on this map. Only when i was playing the nurse though. Play demo get red foeest or some other shit. I also understand having disadvantages, but not being able to blink to the third floor of the building is kind of broken not a disadvantage.
---
It's resets your character to level 1, you lose everything on her but you gain a cosmetic and have increase chance of better items. It's up to personal preference whether you want to prestige or not.
---
There is absolutely nobody forcing you or anyone else to do all of that. Just get 9k shards, get the character you want (unless it‚Äôs a licensed character), and get the perks you want through leveling them up. Simple. Just because there‚Äôs a huge number of shards needed to get all of the perks, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre forced to in order to play the game. Grinding gets easier as you level up. It increases every 10 or so levels by about 5 (I think), and you get even more in increments of 100.
---
And no, Doctor and Hag will stay behind their respective paywalls.
---
Then you would support increased variety in the Shrine of Secrets, no? That was one of the solutions I suggested. That would definitely help players like you figuratively chase a carrot on a stick if the grind is your personal objective.
---
&gt; It's a shady practice
---
Selling a game is a shady practice? While giving you a chance to get something for free? And this "something" isn't mandatory to win? Shady, really?
---
I‚Äôm kinda disappointed, I wanted you both to just start making out..::
---
Um I think my point might've gone over your head. My whole point was to explain that the killer wasn't camping. Just the survivor had some nice perks to to essentially escape.
---
As everyone in the comments and I believe the intent of the post was to bad mouth the killer for "camping".
---
I think most people rank her third generally saying 1. Nurse 2. Hillbilly 3. Spirit
---
I‚Äôm hoping for the outfit Steve wears at the junkyard probably my favourite one
---
First off, no. Fuck Tyde Time lol.
---
Second off, Spirit is generally considered the second strongest killer after nurse on PC and (I think?) the absolute #1 best on console simple due to how easy it is to control her compared to nurse
---
Freddy pre-patch was really good for killers starting out. The straight up wall hacks that he had helped me learn to play killer. A lot of people used Freddy as an end game but i would use thanataphobia and stack on some add ons that slow down action speeds, on top of that with ruin and it was really hard for a lot of survivors to finish gens.
---
Source ?
---
I haven‚Äôt got it at all and the only time I got against the demogorgan I‚Äôm pretty sure he was either new or afk because I didn‚Äôt see him once and nobody even got injured
---
I think that it should be level 3 noed get insta down instead of all levels but that‚Äôs it. (Haven‚Äôt played in a long time idk if they changed it)
---
Rubber Gloves Steve 100%
---
That's the greatest thing I've heard in a while.
---
I don‚Äôt remember, however I have seen this on the subreddit when I first joined and even redrew this when I was learning how to use my wacom tablet
---
That‚Äôs Jake Gyllenhall.
---
every inside map makes billy a little weaker and spirit a little stronger.
---
I think nothing will help avoid entitled survivors.
---
Two survivors popped party streamers so I was gonna be nice while getting legion daily. I play with the mice though to get points. I‚Äôll hook each twice if I get the opportunity but run away from hook. I‚Äôll down survivors and bring them to gen and let them wiggle or drop them at a gen another survivor is at for them to get healed. On a second hook a guy gave up struggle immediately and kept messaging me the Claud body blocked him and wanted to tell me where she was. I said I was being friendly and he gave up and he flipped saying I‚Äôm not friendly because I hooked. Then spammed me with 22 party invites. 
---
Another player disconnected. Not sure why. 
---
Another player was upset I let the Meg live because she stole his tool box and didn‚Äôt like that I was friendly...
---
WHAT?
---
I personally love the idea of NoED, it does exactly what it implies but you can tell that it's being used as more of a crutch perk. I think keeping the movement speed addition would still be nice, but having it be token-based would help to remove the issues of people using it as a fallback, and place it a lot more safely into the *"Pop the last gen, I fucking dare you"*
---
Had this on accident yesterday. Ran this unfortunate Demo for 5 gens. After the match I saw the poor soul was only rank 20. I felt so bad I sent him a message apologizing for what just happened to him.
---
Lovely yo. I'll try that wee nasty bulid now, see how it goes.
---
Welp I'm not looking at mysterio the same way again.
---
Instead of just grunting or screaming when you drop a pallet on her she'll go "oh you dirty birdy!"
---
Nah they haven't changed it I don't think but I think it's only a perk for baby killers to help them learn I mean most rank 14 killers will wanna use better perks than noed
---
I was rank 17 or 18 and got matched with rank 4 and 6 survivors. Game is having a laugh.
---
Probably new I‚Äôd guess
---
How viable is myers? Keep trying play as killer but with a very limited amount of time I have to play i don't know if I'll ever be able play killer with how damn long it takes. Some people are forced survivor mains.
---
Don't forget about our new boys Freddy and Demogorgon! Two of the absolute strongest 3 gen campers in the game. Demo has some disgusting plays he can make with certain set ups.
---
TydeTyme's opinions on killers are all wrong. Spirit was almost top tier on release and then after her mid-chapter buff for sure became top tier.
---
No offense but don't listen to him on how effective/ineffective stuff is in this game, he's usually widely wrong in this aspect most of the time.
---
He is tho
---
Ok vid I guess, horrible music though
---
Don't even dream of a KYF. Tried so many times and Never worked.
---
Right right
---
Say sike right now
---
Fucking *yes* üëåüèª
---
Well dbd can be really toxic but also really nice. Today i played nurse for my first time, on ps4. In lobbies i wrote to people stuff like "first match with nurse, don't bully lol" they actually did not, they helped me learn how the blinks works, and the ones i managed to down were free to escape obv. I regained trust in this game lol
---
I apologized as the Survivor to a baby Billy on Xbox yesterday. "I'm so sorry Match making is so broken. I'm twice your rank and solo queings so it's not even SwF BS. I'm sorry dude, that match shouldn't have happened."
---
She didnt, But if i do good she will buy it
---
The instadown isn‚Äôt the problem, it‚Äôs the movement speed that I have an issue with. Having a permanent Play With Your Food Token is stronger than people realize.
---
I can disconnect tho
---
Yes, as long as they level up the characters on your account you can purchase them later and they‚Äôll be leveled up
---
Probably even though I went around most of the map (badham preschool) I didn‚Äôt even hear a heartbeat
---
I kinda had a similar issue the day the new patch came out. I wasn‚Äôt able to heal or wiggle but it hadn‚Äôt happened since, my guess is that they‚Äôve just done a pretty good job so far
---
No he is not
---
Small game, son. Deja by also.
---
1) and not killing survivors as fast as possible is a certain way to lose unless you are toying with bad survivors. Less survivors on the map, easier to put pressure. 
---
2) "griefing" is holding the game hostage, abusing gamebreaking bugs, etc. Intention to win using every available and legal instrument is not griefing. It is desire to win. 
---
3) Sorry to disappoint, but killers in general are weaker than survivors simply because it is 4 vs 1. In cases where both survivors and killer are equally good, killer is mostly likely to lose, unless he is very lucky. Applying pressure is possible when there is at least 1 survivor dead. Keeping all 4 busy is physically impossible, even against randoms, even when you are able to get an almost perfect triangle. This whole arguement about being good is viable only when difference between killer's and survivors' skill is huge, otherwise the game compensates survivors' lack of skill. 
---
4) you can. Simply don't get caught, since there are a lot of pallets and window loops on the map. If you are better than the killer you are going to run him for 5 gens or at least get enough for a black pip. I'm not even talking about DS, BT, instaheals and bodyblocking. 
---
P.S. some of this does not apply to nurse or spirit, bc these are the only killers with no direct counter play and which can succeed in defeating rank 1 swf regularly for obvious reasons. 
---
P.P.S predicting your question about my ranks: i have 4000 hrs in this game, I've been playing since beta and I am both killer and survivor rank 1.
---
If it affected all generators NOT CURRENTLY WORKED ON i think it would be somewhat balanced.
---
I mean I get both sides of this. With 20 hours you don‚Äôt really know anything so you could be playing somewhat ‚Äúscummy‚Äù without knowing. I know for a fact I was. Just proxy camping people because I was never good at chases. I‚Äôve gotten a lot better so it‚Äôs a lot more efficient for me to chase rather than camp. Especially points wise, I don‚Äôt really give a damn about pips if you‚Äôre good they‚Äôll come naturally. I just try to play efficient. I will be scummy if they want to be scummy first though. Flashlight clicks and teabags at the pallet, without being obvious bait of course, cause me to get straight up tunnel vision because I take it as a challenge. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how good you are.*downed in under 30 seconds with all the pallets still left on the map* ‚ÄúOh. You‚Äôre not as good as you think you are..‚Äù 
---
at this point I‚Äôm rambling but yeah. I see both sides. People need to be nicer to new players. That should be a cardinal rule for all games but people love bullying so all you can do is slap on that mori for those obvious swf‚Äôs
---
He‚Äôs the master is hands on illusion... I mean slight of handies... I mean gay magic.  Yeah, one of those.
---
added it
---
Reporting is a joke. In 1200 hours I've been banned for "communication abuse" twice and never did they get back to me after I used SAM and a fiddler to cheat shards nor after I sent them furry porn. The devs are autists.
---
Carbeture tuning guide is super powerful and should be ultra rare. But this addon is pretty cool
---
He's mid tier at best, but he is fun to play and fun to play against. Exactly how Killers should be. Devs shouldn't buff him, they should nerf the stupid killers like nurse/spirit.
---
*cries in treatment*
---
Buy it if you like it, have fun with the game
---
My gf with the exact same thing. Lmao.
---
I haven‚Äôt played since it happened; two days ago. It was sort of frustrating. I be a good survivor, do gens, get chased and lose them with mad dukes, only to get cockblocked by the door lmao. Will definitely try tomorrow night and see if it happens again
---
I say gg ez in every game because that is funny
---
God damnit behaviour, is nowhere safe from this?
---
I haven‚Äôt seen one person complain about Demo since the ptb released aside from this guys comment.
---
Ah yeah sorry, I‚Äôm sick and tired asf I see what you mean
---
The best way to find gens on the Saw map is look for closed doors.
---
Yeah that makes more sense.
---
 Lithe is usually better than Balanced, as there are more vaults then drops, plus if there are no windows you can use pallets to proc it. Personally I would use dead hard but your exhaustion perks is suited to your play style. Adrenaline can mess you up and is very situational, I would swap it for borrowed. DS is key. Final perk could be something like Inner Strength as it has synergy with DS, or Iron Will.
---
Thank you kind sir.
---
Clown is pretty good with certain add ons. One of those killers I get add ons for before I play them.
---
second wind is great when it works
---
I have a SWF party of 3 people. Rank 4, rank 8 and me rank 11. With the way matchmaking is currently, we just end up against killers from all ranks. However, we found that the rando's rank is always around the killer's rank. So when we come in a lobby with a rank 20 Dwight, we change our objectives to
---
#1 protect the baby dwight
---
#2 go easy on the gens and give the killer plenty of chase action
---
Do people actually like these kinda montages? I always think the heavy editing, which usually doesn't show rank, makes it seem less impressive. It is quite possible in half of these the killer downed you and just whiffed a few times and that's the clip you use, plus like I said no ranks so for all we know some of these killers could be like rank 20 which makes any 360 way less impressive.
---
There‚Äôs going to be a new character who‚Äôs responsible for digging up all the lore. They said on the 3 year anniversary stream that he will be called the prisoner or the observer or something like that. 
---
Also yes there probably won‚Äôt be new lore for licensed characters but we have so many original characters to learn about.
---
The only people who BM are the people too insecure to play well - that includes 'ez' typers
---
I haven't played DbD for a while (got super distracted by a slew of games) but when I think of playing, I have to really start earlier than I usually get to game just so I can get maybe four games into a session.  
---
Then I get hooked first and it just ruins the night and my motivation to keep playing.  I wish there was a single player campaign (somehow?) where I get to practice and improve.
---
That would be . . . AMAZING!!!
---
You don‚Äôt
---
Definitely understand your frustrations, hopefully this doesn‚Äôt happen again :)
---
You should probably mark this NSFW....
---
The dlcs are like 4 bucks right now......
---
It's sarcasm my dude
---
Happened to me today, am rank 17 (barely play killer) and had to play against 8-7-8-3 squad. 
---
I was like :| that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt get anyone.
---
In one year of dbd i've played against legion two times lol, on ps4 he's like the plague, nobody plays with them
---
I genuinely feel like a babysitter sometimes when playing killer, that's why I mainly play pig and not so seriously
---
Just like with Freddy... took a while, no one believed we'd actually get it, but here we are
---
Steve went from 
---
‚ÄúScrew company policy‚Äù
---
To
---
‚ÄúWhat company policy?‚Äù
---
I've seen a few, absolute madmen.
---
I really like the new map, aesthetically it is very pleasing and horror inducing. My only issue is that middle room because a good survivor can almost turn it into an infinite with 2 pallets in there and the stairs with drop downs they can just keep looping.
---
I wish the killer tutorials told you not to facecamp because to a new player that looks like the best strategy
---
I see MUCH more people complaining about others complaining.
---
What makes billy better than leatherface? Just askin.
---
yeah I am sitting here thinking to myself.. Do you know how many pallet teabags, flashlight blinds, pointing and bagging at the gate, holding hostage (before endgame collapse) and other such bullshit I had to go through to "git gud" as a killer? Now everyone is supposed to get a free pass?
---
If people cannot take losing and people trash talking and stuff, maybe don't play multiplayer (semi) competitive games. It happens in anything from LoL to DbD and back to CoD. Don't take it so personally if you lose. watch some videos. Get better. Mind game. accept defeat, strive for victory.
---
Do I teabag people as survivor? almost never. It serves no purpose and makes you look like an ass for no reason. Do I get mad when people Teabag me? of course not. Its a game. IF I get mad from a game, I am mad at myself for playing poorly. Not at others for doing what the game wants them to do. Kick my ass. Mistakes are made every game. Learn from them and do better. Crying about it doesn't solve anything
---
You're right, that map is bad for both killer and surv, but there are pallets every 5 meters so..
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; Double post
---
I used to be super friendly pig. No hooking at all but that can be really boring and I can be pretty good as killer so I decided to start sacrificing for achievements. Just funny when I decide I‚Äôll be friendly and they freak at me, but I can have games I get merciless and no one sends me messages.
---
Dude she did suck from PTB to launch and they buffed her like 4 times rapidly. While I disagree that she is still better than just B Tier, she was indeed as before the buffs.
---
Yes! I can't practice if I keep dying first.
---
Billy can pressure the map better since LF can only tantrum a fairly small distance and not as controllable.
---
I cry every time i see such wonderful trash meme and it got only a few likes more than a fucking cat in front of a screen or a shitty ass "look at me" cosplay crap :(
---
and yet Amanda still doesn't have Rules Set No. 2 in her base kit üôÑ
---
Yeah of course you play on console and do that lmfao
---
Naw I play on pc. I was playing Claudette though.
---
Where'd you here that
---
For survivor it isn't that good but if you really want the bloody body yes or to get perks with a bigger facility but the bloodweb exists. But if you really like she I think that's a good idea
---
Idk, Billy still racks in the highest kill counts and because it's harder to juke with a controller his saw is hard to dodge, and pair that with the hitboxes and bad optimization. Spirit is up there though
---
There should be a machine gun add on that allows you to rapid fire mini chainsaws.
---
Yeah.... thanks for that
---
agree
---
I meant every game I play not every game of DBD
---
How abt topless bunny feng?
---
I love the new map as a survivor, but I do run balanced landing on all my builds. I have made a few killers just give up chasing me a few times lol
---
Exactly?!  I'm decent on the generators and rescues but I'm horrible at looping and escaping. 
---
Then as a killer, I can't find people, and when I do, I get outsmarted.  
---
At least I'm on PS4, so no chat options to confirm how lousy of a player I am.
---
How y'all lookin' when you miss several shreds in a row because the game just decides not to hit
---
Someone was so kind to do it for me\~
---
or you could just play the game and offer advice after. 
---
I‚Äôm not spending the first 5 minutes to find the killer and see if he‚Äôs good or not to decide how I‚Äôm going to play, I‚Äôm going to get on a gen and if the killer doesn‚Äôt approach I‚Äôll ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù
---
Each category has things which can help you get points for other people's actions, and a good survivor vs. a new killer = the other survivors having it easy mode
---
yes that‚Äôs what i was implying.
---
Basement demo
---
I have faith. Then dedicating mid-chapters to fixes has been a godsend.
---
Same, same and same. I just now tried to play the demogorgon and they destroyed me. Going back to survivor..
---
As someone who plays mainly killer, every match ends either on me getting stomped, or the high ranks trying to farm each other to death
---
Do it yourself next time
---
I've had some amazing moments with the hatch that I wish was recorded. :(
---
I'm gonna prestige my Nancy for me it's nice to have.
---
This is noob3‚Äôs shitty juke montages level of trash. Please never post one of these again
---
There‚Äôs also one on that little broken ledge in the corner  behind the barrel upstairs in the gate room. 
---
Another one spawns in the utility closet next to the hole/drop down at the top level where 11‚Äôs isolation room and the observation rooms/offices are. 
---
There‚Äôs another that spawns under a tall shelf behind a barrel near a pallet. This room usual has the two pallets in the middle and the scaffolding stairs that can go up onto the shelves and frequently spawns In the middle.
---
No idiot. It will just dilute his moris and he'll still get looped
---
What about killer prestige
---
I am much better at survivor, just like in Friday the 13th, where I also rarely play as Jason but the one time I did, I was arse.  The only kill I got, I'm sure was due to lag.  
---
Also, there is just so much more to do and I get that sense of accomplishment.
---
I‚Äôd buy it, he‚Äôs fun to play and play against
---
It's also console gameplay which is the easiest for survivors to "juke" all they do is spin the analog stick in a circle 360ing is easy for console players because the killers sensitivity is too slow. There is no skill in this video.
---
And if you gonna play Claudette a lot that's worth it.
---
Subscribe to see the multiple I‚Äôll be posting in the future. You can leave you extremely intelligent comments there to.ü§≠‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Wait, what does the add on do again? Does it work like spirit fury or something like leatherface/Billy's chainsaw?
---
Don‚Äôt police other people‚Äôs decisions
---
And they say ‚ÄúThe chance of being sent to The Underground Complex will be increased for the first week of its release‚Äù  lol
---
Exactly the same as survivor
---
Really? I play in red/purple ranks on ps4 every season and people usually have a fairly easy time juking my Billy there. Now I dont use him a whole lot so maybe I just suck with it? 
---
Also Billy has nothing to counter loops where spirit obliterates them.
---
I mean it was an accident like
---
No thanks. You can continue to believe you did something special in that dogshit vid tho
---
CSB time: the first three games I played it was killer. I never found anyone. Got so much gg ez mocking that I didn‚Äôt play the game again for Months. 
---
It also took me a little while to realize I wasn‚Äôt finishing the Trapper animation so the traps weren‚Äôt getting set.
---
You‚Äôre welcome.
---
Same with killers. You lose everything and start from level 1 again with a blood cosmetic.
---
More special then anything you‚Äôve ever accomplished I‚Äôm sure. Seeing as you spend all day criticizing dead by daylight videos on reddit. üòÇ
---
I wasn't referring to PTB. I was referring to AT launch, she was a solid killer, then they buffed her to make her phasing more difficult to discern, tweaked a few add-ons and made her what she is now which is arguably one of the best killers in the game.
---
Dude. It‚Äôs a meme. Laugh or don‚Äôt üòÇü•¥
---
Thanks but I guess it's just not meant to be, feelsbadman. I am happy with 500 for my first post in 5 years though :L
---
Probably the same people who designed Quentin
---
I‚Äôd have to agree, this does waste some time in the game, but I have had cases where this perk came  in handy....
---
Windows are a big weakness to Spirit because if they vault it you have to then go around again, and certain perks can make a Spirit's day especially miserable (looking at you Iron Will / Distortion). While she is better at pallets, Billy's damage ends the chase before it begins.
---
Also I play on Xbox, and the devs had a stat chart that showed Billy is the top killer on Xbox and PS4, but Spirit is gaining popularity on PS4 but not as much on Xbox
---
No one believed cause it took nearly 2 years for it to actually happen lol
---
Its not worse when they can move around way further and go around corners and not get dodged by 360s.
---
That outfit is cool as fuck this is why Joey is my favorite out of the bunch.
---
I didn't even think of that many perks but yeah, there is more perks and items and add-ons to counter her. In terms of top most played killer for consoles it is probably between Spirit and Billy, but in terms of kills per game Billy is higher.
---
I didn't know there was an argument about this lol
---
I am sorry but this is not the game for people "just trying to wind down" its stressful and intense. Especially as killer. I would say the same thing about most multiplayer games.
---
Dont play COD to wind down. Or LoL. Or For Honor. Or siege. Or literally any competitive or even semi-competitive game
---
argument with whom?

*-Survivor crawls out of basement-*
---
‚ÄúGOOD LORD WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THERE?!‚Äù
---
I really dislike it personally. To be fair i'm not a fan of maps like Lery in the first place but this one is worst. My favorite maps are mostly the originals
---
Xbox too
---
Dont BHVR make up a new story for the killers anyway?
---
Lol gg Claud. Sad to see how many people this is affecting. Hope they fix it real soon. Was just scrolling through the thread and found similar videos. Pls DBD, we just want bugs fixed
---
If that happens, we better have Pea Shoot and dr. Zomboss as survivor and boss.
---
I know, it just detected a double post
---
Lol yes, the title isn‚Äôt the meme though. It‚Äôs a simple caption that I typed in a hasty 2 seconds in classü§® it‚Äôs not a debate over abortion laws guys, don‚Äôt take it to seriously
---
I disagree personally, I enjoy winding down after a stressful day to play a fun, challenging game.  It's unfortunate that most are made downright stressful because of little kids getting mad and trolling online
---
this is actually kind of terrifying
---
HURRY UP AND TAKE MY MONEY ALREADY
---
üôèüèº they sound like a smart chap
---
I want to toss out some advice I try to think of when this happens. 
---
When they start bullying, use this time to practice. Yes they are laughing at you, but they are also willing to let you chase them. And if you lose them, they‚Äôll cone back. Use that to hone your skills. 
---
They will also run to every pallet, and will do a gen the second you kick it, so you can turn around and kick it again. This is great for farming. 
---
Use them to get strong 
---
And I will tell you a secret. Eventually the over confident bully will make a mistake. And then you come down on them like thunder.
---
his teabag is a legit teabag since he can do it over the face of a survivor on the ground.
---
survivors teabag are only a metaphorical teabag while they are at safe distance while doing it.
---
Colliding with a dropped pallet whilst using shred automatically destroys the dropped pallet. So like Bubba and Billy.
---
Red Rank PS4/PC Survivor here, gotta disagree about Iron Will. I used to run the perk constantly, and I still will in purple ranks, but recently I've seen a metric fuckton of Spirits start running Stridor to counter Iron Will, since it completely breaks the perks effectiveness. (Which, really, really sucks. If Stridor didn't effect Iron Will, and if Spirit wasn't countered by just Perks, I wouldn't personally mind her as a Survivor main. But because that's not the case, it's just a pain in the ass to play against her, and she's usually all I see in high rank...)
---
Almost every add-on breaks the nurse for any reasonably skilled killer.  The nurse is a significant force without any add-ons at all for any reasonably skilled killer.  Either they dump all the existing add-ons and create new ones that have nothing to do with improving her base powers, or she has no add-ons.  Anything outside of that will just leave her broken.  
---
Survivor add-ons have no such game-breaking attribute and no survivor is any better/worse than any other once the teachable perks are unlocked, so it makes no sense to discuss deleting a survivor.
---
I've learned not to take the teabagging, finger pointing, and ez's too seriously. I'm not going to let some pesky random people ruin the game for me. Like the OP said we all gotta start somewhere. 
---
I was a baby nurse one game on swamp and the survivors finished all the gens and opened the gates (this was before the end game collapse.) They literally stayed and ran loops around me, flashlight clicking, teabagging, etc. I somehow managed to down two of them without NoED and get two sacrifices. They were so salty in the end game chat and I thanked them for the practice and left. Was a great moment in my baby nurse history.
---
He can be lol
---
He‚Äôs also the guy that will say YOLO when cleansing haunted ground...
---
He narrates everything he does.
---
I have to say i don't remember facing a P3 squadettes (unless you count like 2 Claudette's in some matches) but still, I've tried to play survivor and i can say that yeah, it sucks idk if its a fundamental flaw of DBD or something but while having that stuff contently is frustrating, having the short end of the stick all the time while facing off ageisnt 4 other people is agrovating, if you played killer, you would know that chasing a survivor threw a pallet they didn't throw down, only for their friend to be there and slam it when you go through is something that sends your blood boiling.  
---
it does for me at least, i have more then once screamed at my screen for that bullshit, im going to say this once, DBD does not need SWF, idc what people say SWF ruins the game and makes a lot of creative perks useless becuase "does nothing with SWF" if they want it so bad then killers should have the ability to opt out.  
---
We arn't NPC monsters and should not be forced to play with people with the biggest advantage....damn i went into my own rant :p
---
She totally should imo especially with the end game nerf.
---
But here's what I dont get. What makes you mad when you lose and the other team BMs you. Are you mad becuase you lost, thus basically being mad st yourself for not playing better? Or are you mad at the other people for being dicks? Becuase get mad at yourself all day. That's how we get better. But dont give those pricks the satisfaction of getting riled up over them.
---
I get mad when I get stomped in a game like this becuase I know it's my fault. I almost never get mad at other for trying to be a dick. They're a dick, that's on them, but if I was better I could beat them and then who cares? Problem is even if no one was toxic I would still get mad sometimes. Cuz sometimes you are just gonna play poorly.
---
That is why I don't reccomend games like this to wind down. At least not if you are like me.
---
Exactly. I just t-bag from the start and then later say ''just don't look honey''
---
Oh my bad I thought it deleted both of them
---
was the killers name in Cyrillic? also was she running noed? i see a pattern here
---
I'd get rid of unrelenting
---
who said i was taking this seriously, I actually like this meme
---
https://youtu.be/TTUKcUYspYw
---
It was from memory so it wasn‚Äôt too accurate.
---
Iron Will completely silences you whilst injured no matter what (tier 3 obviously). Stridor affects when you aren't hurt. So yes, it's still useful for Spirit to find people while phasing, but Iron Will silences pain.
---
And Spine Chill destroys any mindgame potential with her husk. If it's really her it activates, if it's the husk it is not active.
---
Not really you who is taking it seriously. The guy before youüòÇüòÇ
---
This is making the killer stronger. Do you have any ideas on how to buff the other party in return? As a survivor where do I get my time/item/health state back?
---
if its gonna be player controlled i'd expect them to use an Alpha series big daddy which has more mobility (for some reason). Than the standard big daddies you see in bioshock 1.
---
i doubt this meme because maybe they can stack and become the unstoppable force of juking
---
*Let's give the one-shot killer a red add-on and see what happens*
---
I like this add-on, tho
---
Myers is not top tier, but also definitely not bottom tier. I think he is one of the more fun killers to play with as you are able to genuinely scare people. Usually, at the start of the match you want to remain out of line of sight as long as possible, approach generators from an angle where survivors probably won't look and when you can see a survivor that doesn't run awag, stalk them to get out of Evil Within I
---
Once in Evil Within II, the real game begins, you are now viable in a chase, stalk when survivors aren't running, chase when you see an oppertunity, make sure that you stalk just enough to not go into Evil Within III.
---
When you're chasing a healthy survivor and you're right up their ass with nowhere to go for them, stalk them for a second to pop that Evil Within III and instantly put a stop to the chase. From there, I recommend you don't immediately pick them up as you still have a while minute of Evil Within left. Walk around a little and see if you can find anyone. If you can get 2 people down, you've created great pressure for the survivors and gen progress will slow down or even stop completely.
---
Myers is a snowball killer: one down can lead to more downs.
---
First off, two wrongs don't make a right so if you're gonna spout that kindergarden bullshit at me then at least remember it all. 
---
Second off, OP didn't pretend to farm. OP farmed. He allowed survivors to get extra points that they didn't earn. Where in the big Killer's Rulebook does it say that you have to let them farm til escape? He let the baby survivor go, as is so celebrated on this sub, but still got his mori kill as was his original objective.
---
And third and most importantly, I didn't do any of this shit. I commented on a Reddit post, I havent played this game in like 3 months. And yet you still felt the need to insult a stranger you don't know, over a game that neither of us were in. Think about how that reflects on your Cheeto crusted personality, twat.
---
Why does this actually make me super sad
---
Sweet, thanks. I never play the PTB, so it's good to hear these things
---
oh sorry, i got the wrong idea because you messaged me

Interesting, do you have a link?
---
Balanced landing, Iron Will, Quick &amp; Quiet and that one that gives you 9% in lots of stuff when injured are my only perks needed
---
Too many people playing killer at the time
---
Please elaborate because at face value, your post is very stupid.
---
Whispers Level 1: There is a survivor on the map

I do not understand how people think he's scary. He waddles around in such a dumb way. Someone got hooked with kindred the other day and I coudln't stop giggling at the 8 foot penguin making circles around them

And be sure to say GG :) in the end chat. Because these guys love nothing more than to make you mad, and to say ‚Äúhaha that was fun‚Äù will put a sour taste in their mouth.
---
1) Tunneling is not always the best way to win. By not tunneling killers create more gen pressure. If you tunnel the last 2 survivors are just sitting on gens unchecked. 
---
2) So the killers aim is to win when they sit on the hooked survivor at 5 gens slapping them? 
---
3) the 4 vs 1 idea is old as 2016 and killers being worse than survivors is from that same era. If you can't play killer now against equally skilled survivors I don't know what else to tell. It's been constant and major survivor nerfs for almost 2 years now.
---
''the game compensates survivors' lack of skill.'' This same applies to killers equally. 
---
4) It's almost impossible to not get caught to a good killer. Even if the killer is bad bloodlust will eventually help them to catch the survivor. If the killer is so bad that they don't catch a survivor for 5 gens, I think the killer is the problem. Out of DS, BT, instaheals and bodyblocking only instaheals are bs. The others can be prevented easily or actually help the killer to get more map pressure (hitting bodyblocking survivors).
---
P.P.S I don't care about your ranks since there are equally good and bad players at all ranks. :)
---
Hex perk could be stronger
---
NOED is only strong if the survivors dont cleanse totems it has a literal counter to it. Whereas the only counter to DS is slugging which the killer unfortunately didnt do. I am not here to argue the pros and cons of perks I am just stating about why I think the killer wasnt camping...
---
What is SWF? Picked this up recently with a bunch of buddies but we just have a ball playing customs against each other. Lol found this sub and keep reading tons of initialisms and stuff I don't recognize. Wanna try solo out but most posts I read here almost dissuade me from that lol trying to learn what I can.
---
Annnnnnnnnd, there goes all your karma XD
---
I would say it is supposed to be possible, but certainly not easy. 
---
Shack is meant to be a strong location for loops/mind games. And the fact that it appears on most maps means players generally get a lot more practice running it. But anyone can make a mistake. I think it just depends on whether you want to spend the time trying to make it work, or just avoid shack entirely
---
Spirit main here, can confirm.
---
Good man
---
Get rid of unrelenting and put on nurses and get rid of spies for sloppy / pop or bbq
---
Just make sure to not look into the deadlig.... I mean flash lights.
---
I replied to a specific comment you made about lunges, regardless of whether you were talking about powers.
---
I've not had a problem so far at all with loops, against Demo I just bait the lunge out by pretending to vault a window.
---
If you are thinking, saying and encouraging people that you "gotta get that mori daily somehow" you are part of the problem. Doesn't matter if you are doing it directly in game (which I never claimed, learn to read and not interpret random stuff into it) or indirectly.
---
Farming with no intention of letting everyone leave after is pretend farming, easy as that. I'm not gonna write down a whole definition for you.
---
As I already wrote in another comment here, if you start farming you change the game dynamics. If you suddenly stop the Survivors have no way of knowing and you're getting an undeserved kill. And wow, don't act like the Killer doesn't get undeserved points out of the farming act either.
---
If what I wrote before counts as an insult you must be insulted all day long by pretty much everything you see and hear.
---
And treating you like a child is absolutely the correct way to go, since you are selfish like one and use the same baby insults instead of communicating like an adult.
---
same, legion is my favourite killer but now i play more nurse than anybody else because nobody expects her on console :(
---
Also I never complained about the survivor using strong perks. Please quote where i specifically moaned or complained about the survivor using strong perks.
---
Using a system like perks u will always have meta builds. So please point me to where I complained about the survivor using perks.
---
Honestly idk anymore. I'll get like 3-5 stuns a game. I've had games where my squad gets like 20 or 30 in a game.
---
As a killer I give props to all 4 players regardless of the outcome as long as they are not toxic. Otherwise no one gets them. I can't be bothered to single out who was a dick and who wasn't so it's all or nothin
---
When I played my first game I got teabagged after sucking lmao
---
made it a little stronger
---
He‚Äôs getting a buff I‚Äôm pretty sure, devs said on the next hotfix they‚Äôre going to change the pallet breaking addon and make it a default thing
---
Looks pretty accurate to me
---
I have it, but have never read it.  Is it good?
---
There‚Äôs no way to nerf Nurse without making her a complete joke
---
*Nancy liked that.*
---
The crows ain't playing games anymore
---
I have 400 hours on the game and nearly every killer teachable minus 4, I also have half of the survivor teachables it really doesnt take that long to achieve greatness if you play the game with the intended objective of grinding. What you're saying is like going to the warframe devs and asking for all prime warframes for free just to catch up to the people who have invested tons of time into the game.
---
It would be incredible on demogorgon if it worked well.

Insidious basement demogorgon

But why is Claudette shining his junk?

sounds kinda complicated tho

of course it matters. i'm an artist and i'd be upset if anyone ever reposted my work without credit. if an artist does commissions, a huge way of gaining new clients is getting eyeballs on your work; when your work is reposted without attribution, you lose those views and those possible clients.

Mobility. Map coverage is a good Killer's strongest attribute. Billy is slightly weaker than Demogorgon, Nurse, and Spirit since you can't really mindgame his power as much, but he's *far* stronger than Bubba.
---
Yeah I know it's not actually him but wow that looks like Jake Peralta
---
Had my 1st game on the new map yesterday as survivor. I couldn't find a single generator unless someone else was working on it or it was already completed.
---
Got lost pretty much every time a went round a corner. Somehow kept finding myself back in the same room on more than one occasion.
---
Even after all the chaos that went on, I did have a lot of fun on the map

Fuck em. We all have to get bullied by survivors at some point

Honestly though lmao, I didn't know any safer term then straight up saying the two sexes. Is nothing sacred anymoreeee????

You're not alone in this *experience* üòÇ
---
i totally forgot that this was even a thing
---
What's the problem with Legion now? He's my second best killer probably, and one of the best BP farmers I have. Just requires juggling well, not saying it doesn't require skill and focus, but typically I get the 4K.
---
This, plus maybe it's just me, but it feels like most of the time the only way to beat a decent Spirit is 'Counter Perks' which as you said aren't even that effective if the Spirit is running Counter Perks to your Counter Perks.
---
Aww ... the same to you! UwU
---
Noed is bad game design. Change my mind
---
No, i do, it was worse. But doesn't the perk achieve the same effect? It offers a survivor another chance for not creating enough distance on unhook, and punishes the killer for killing. Same is true noed punishes survivors for doing gens too quickly. I've got no issue with noed or decisive, expect both and play around both. Just don't complain about one when you probably crutch off of the other.

You sir just won the game

highjacking the top comment to post [this](https://twitter.com/sexywm9996/status/994962749691121664?s=19) potential source, from the last time this got posted here.
---
carry on!
---
Instaheal is annoying as a killer, it isn't game-breaking.  Keys are pretty close to game-breaking, but only in fairly specific (and rare from my anecdotal experience) circumstances, but they are not an add-on.
---
Dude she's 16
---
I disagree with using Spine Chill with this build. The build is clearly centred more around boldness, looping the killer, etc. Spine Chill is a perk for stealth builds. It works great with Urban, Iron Will, etc.. but doesn‚Äôt make sense for this build. 
---
I would recommend Unbreakable or Borrowed Time.
---
Why thank you
---
The reveal on the missed skill check seems way too long. Seeing as it's a perk that primarily picks on new players, I'd significantly reduce it to say 3,4,5 seconds. 
---
Love the concept otherwise. I quite enjoy the crows on the map and have been pondering a way to further utilize them.
---
Gen rushing is where they have one person flash you while three get a bunch of gens to almost done and then pop 5 almost back to back to back
---
Body blocking is when I hit that one person three people swarmed me so either I couldn't hook her or I couldn't chase her and when I hit one of them one of the healthy boys would jump in front of me or used an instant heal med pack it was pure annoyance
---
:(
---
My third match on DBD I went against 4 P3 Claudette's on Macmillian estate who used purple mist and darkest moonlight and abused the infinite in the coal tower when found. No mercy for anyone, they'll either leave the game before they experience the imbalances of the game or they'll adapt and learn to deal with it.
---
Don't bully my elephant boy :(
---
I like this.
---
Tyde was wrong, as always, that guy doesn't know the first thing about balance in dbd. It's kinda crazy how far fetched from reality his opinions on this game are.
---
Pretty much the same as my first on lab too except it was the demogorgon.
---
Oh no I can't unhear this now
---
Sounds like it worked so "deserve" has nothing to do with it.
---
This would also be a silent buff to Diversion as it would make it the new spine chill (even if the killer is in stealth or using Monitor&amp;Abuse you'd see the perk time meter go up if they are nearby)
---
No I went into the basement after I did the generator in the school basement and he wasn‚Äôt in there
---
Imagine actually doing your main objective as a survivor. **geN rUshInG iS toXic**
---
I don't, but i could see it working for sure, especially vs a decent player.
---
My opinion probably doesn't matter but I love when survivors do this, with ds or not. It minimises the chase by potentially around 1min, BC they could have looped my during that time.
---
Only BS windows can stop spirits, but as well as any other killer. But unlike other killers, you can't tell if spirit vaulting or already phasing around to smack you.
---
Spoiler alert - we all got out in the end. Sorry for sandbagging you Nea &lt;/3
---
Lol ikr? I'm a survivor main and whenever they're like "Gen rushing is so OP" I just reply "yea you being able to kill us is OP to. So what?" üòÇüòÇ
---
I'm definitely waiting to see, I don't want to play against the same 5 people over and over again
---
Naw thats a lie most people dont even message you. Theres just babys that get upset sometimes and dc but besides that there is less than pc. Theres a small amount of people here that play ps4 so you only hear the vocal ones.
---
Spirit is better than Billy but has a higher skill ceiling. Billy can be looped, Spirit can't.
---
Same, my thought was wait until around Halloween then try and get it but if there was more interest then at least 4 people I'd get it
---
I‚Äôm assuming you mistyped, because to get adept you need to use the killers 3 original perks and nothing else, perkwise.
---
My suggestion is to look at what type of play style the killers perks encourage and pick a map off of that. And use top tier addons.
---
No, keep using it, survivors. It exists to be used, like NOED and Ruin.
---
Imagine this happening when you actually had somebody hooked in the basement, I would‚Äôve been scared out of my mind üòÇ
---
&gt; it really turned on King 
---
That's some hilarious ambiguity.
---
Even though you were downed, you could still run because it‚Äôs just a animation glitch.
---
For survivor, ds is now anti tunnelling, for killer, corrupted intervention is ok.
---
Basic colorblind options are borderline an industry standard at this point, and they are aware of the issue because they've acknowledged it before. Basic usability and comfort options not being in the game this late after launch is basically inexcusable.
---
It's not even like they don't have the tech to change aura colors, they've done it before for events like the Lunar New Year and Summer BBQ.
---
default.. he won't have trouble sneaking up on people if he can hit his primary power
---
New player, only played private matches with friends and it's hilarious. I'm guessing a tunneler is a killer who focuses the first person they see?
---
Is that bad? With my friends, if I see someone I go after them unless they just straight up lose me. Trying to learn some stuff to maybe try solo so lol
---
*2017 PTSD intensifies*
---
Literally class of 1996 dude. She is not 16. Go do some reading
---
Gen rushing usually refers to killers who are salty survivors are playing the objective.
---
Body blocking usually can refer to many things, all involving using your body to block someone. 
---
The killer can body blocking a survivor to prevent them from reaching a pallet or safe loop(usually invis killers like wraith or spirit). Body block to lock a survivor in a room meaning they can't play or do anything.
---
Survivors can body block by running in front of killer, usually while carrying a survivor, so that it takes long for you to reach a hook and they can wiggle free. Can also refer to taking a hit instead of your injured teammate so they can get away, that's usually only done post exit gates opened tho.
---
I just started with the release of the Demogorgon and I am absolutely terrible at it. Some survivors are so good at getting you in these long loops and distracting you
---
Y'all are all idiots lmao. Fucking metal gear solid ran at a consistent 60 fps. The graphics are way better than dbd. Plenty on games run at 60. It's not the console. It's the devs.
---
I tried running but it wouldn‚Äôt let me, the animation locked me in the weird shifting thing that you do to crawl when I went down
---
  
---
later on after someone got unhooked from the basement I went back and fell through again and the Meg who unhooked was just there in a corner, I don‚Äôt think she knew what was happening lol.
---
dunno why everyone dcing as demi alot
---
Trust him je is a deer
---
*nancy flooded her pants to that... and so did Dwight.*
---
Only buy dlcs you will use, you can get all perks from the shine of secrets. Buy cosmetics if that‚Äôs your thing. Just remember that you will pretty much just see your weapon as the killer.
---
Oh look it‚Äôs this funny joke again
---
Weird, idk.
---
And far as I know the date in the game is current present so that just suggests she's locked into a perpetual state of youth but she's definitely much older
---
Like I said in my post. If they cared about their players, they'd have introduced things like rank rewards already. We've been asking about that since RELEASE.
---
Yes, its inexcusable that they've done nothing about anything but I think it really boils down to; "There's not enough money in it for us to be worth it."
---
Oh I hate it as killer, especially if I'm not using Spirit Fury.
---
Imo despite the map being good for survivors (tons of safe pallets) it's still a pretty annoying map to run, since you are just hoping the next room has a pallet. It's pure rng, either you got a room with a pallet or you didn't.
---
Buy the dlc and get scoops ahoy Steve, the demogorgon is fun to play and play against. Up to you tho
---
Do you get x amount of irredescent shards per game when your bp is capped? Like if you were to earn say 25k bp in a match, but you're capped you would earn 500 irredescent shards or something to said effect? If not I think they should implement that. Whether it would be changed or not, I think if you are capped on bp you should earn 100 irredescent shard for every 5k bp you would have earned.
---
&gt;What you're saying is like going to the warframe devs and asking for all prime warframes for free
---
No, it's not. It's literally asking the DBD devs to make two non-licensed killers that have been out as DLC for a very long time to be part of the base game to reduce the grind and/or expense required for newer players. You don't need to make an analogy or a comparison with another game. The only reason you're doing this silly Warframe comparison is to make it sound like the request presented here is much, **much** more unreasonable than it actually is. This can go both ways. "It's like asking the World of Warcraft devs to make Draenei and Blood Elves available to new players."
---
Don't try to compare things when the comparison is wholly unnecessary to understand the conversation and you are knowingly using it just to overexaggerate your point.
---
I really don't think they play killer alot or they just play killers where ultra rares DO make a killer op. there's a few ultra rares that really don't really do that much(Fuming mix tape, rule set no.2, and tattoo's middle finger as example) Not all ultra rare add ons are game breaking like people seem to think. this really just seems more like one those add ons to me.
---
Boohoo.
---
Lol yea but it‚Äôs not as useful as ‚Äúnoed‚Äù or ‚Äúruin‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ you‚Äôre wasting more time using it rather than doing gens. You can keep using it but you lack efficiency if you do
---
Fr, like wtf do you want us to do? Walk up to the killer and just let them kill us? Lmao
---
A good place that you could camp the whole time and not get hit much is in Hawkins lab
---
On the top floor with the big hole in the ground, carefully walk to the corner. If they attack you they fall right through
---
It's different for streamers. Buying an expensive cosmetic is profit generating because you can do a video about it, attract attention to your stream, etc.
---
You mean as a survivor..?
---
Looking at your perks/build you seem right at home
---
There is also a bath in it therefore it cannot be classified as toilet.
---
Reee

I was playing survivor earlier and I get a message saying "You're Trash" when all I'm trying to do it have a good time and learn to play the game 
---
Just gimme some tips instead of being toxic üôÑüòï
---
Yea especially when at the exit gate
---
You‚Äôre distracting the killer in 4 people so they don‚Äôt catch you running from the map /s
---
This does change quite a bit. Primarily the fact that you no longer have those situations where a potato gets looped for the whole game and then downs the person they were chasing with NOED and camps.
---
If you were good enough to loop the Killer for the entire match your reward shouldn't be dying anyways.
---
You have maxed out perks,??
---
Apparently not lmao its sad tbh
---
I love these easily the best dbd concepts I‚Äôve seen in a while. Also could you make a concept for a vampire chapter?
---
Basically
---
yeah bubba's addons are next to useless, honestly.
---
Salt
---
Well for a start you need to run the Killers own 3 teachable perks to even qualify for the Achievement.
---
You traitor
---
You don't need to immediately disarm. 
---
Your timer is a resource. You now have five minutes to work with and a guaranteed disarm. If you feel like you will be able to end quickly, you can totally sit on a gen and let it tick down a bit.
---
Playing it safe and immediately disarming is appealing, but if you're feeling adventurous, escaping the trial with 30 seconds left means you used your time really effectively.
---
The framerate has been very good before this patch, they‚Äôre obviously gonna fix it..
---
The sound for some reason started at the end of the video... when they all scream... I have headphones on 100%... ouch.
---
This isn't what it looks like
---
Spirit is THE meta killer now, because she's only slightly weaker than Nurse and wayyy easier to play.
---
Ok and what rank were you again??? Thats right be queit baby killer
---
No one is going to believe a rank 1 has no idea that you need to run the 3 killer perks that come with the killer for the achievement.
---
Who is this guy exactly? I mean... what‚Äôs he do exactly in whatever fiction he‚Äôs from?
---
Maybe you shouldn't have let them get to the exit gate to begin with :) Haha, just kidding. Fair point.
---
Id reccomend getting leatherface and david king.
---
leatherface for amazing killer perks and david for one of the best survivor perks
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I figured
---
Yeah, I feel the same honestly, probably a product of just not being very into the character, really. And I wanted to try something a little different with this one, didn‚Äôt quiiiite pan out though. 
---
And, like I said, I struggle some with the licensed killers.
---
Thanks for the critique, I very much appreciate it.
---
Demogor*gone*
---
If you don't have ruin you must have literally just started because it was on the shrine 2-3 weeks ago as well as bbq and chili, if you want those killers you can get them with shards for free bbq can obviously be replaced with bitter murmur. Why complain about being given an objective that is meant to make you feel like you accomplished something? The only explanation is laziness.
---
You want a screenshot of my game to show you im rank 1
---
Agreed. Dont listen to TydeTyme. 
---
Nurse, Billy, Spirit top 3 killers
---
100%. Billy main and he‚Äôs trash on new map. Can‚Äôt chainsaw.
---
increasing killer instinct is not a good idea at all, most of the time they will ran away when they hear the terror radious and its gonna be more problematic if they are far away, also its kinda hard to tell how far they are, so it would make chain attacks more harder, i like the other stuff tho
---
I got that map prob 5 times in a row Tuesday and 4 times last night. It's basically an updated version of the game map.
---
Billy is above Spirit but ya, she is definitely #3 on the list
---
Wtf is this shit
---
I never bm by saying ez unless the survivors/killers are the ones instantly being toxic and harassing in the end game chat. Then i always pull out the "gg ez" and watch them get even more mad.
---
this is such a weird meme... like get out of the corner ya dumb wraith maybe they won‚Äôt flash u.
---
I was thinking the same but I sometimes rank up a bit and get my ass bullied. It is not extra hard, It just breaks the rules and jas its own
---
That is seriously weird but the progress doesn't lie, you got your double pip which at Rank 12 is a bit easier thank goodness. Good for you man! Demogorgon is hard as balls to play well imo.
---
True story lol of my survivor career
---
It audibly makes all breathing louder. Technically even the survivor hears the noises louder.
---
Literally just go into a KYF with Iron Will and Stridor, you will both hear the survivor still making noise while injured.
---
Sorry but you are factually incorrect, Stridor directly counters Iron Will and then some.
---
Also when you teabag or BM The killer in general you have increased chance on getting tunnelled or facecamped wich you ranted about so much.
---
Most of the killers do these things as revenge to salty survivors
---
But either side is just so entitled and toxic so no one should blame others and work on themselves
---
Sadly school prevents me from having that
---
I think it was when asked if there's any other game devs would like to see crossed over with DBD for chapter content, not_queen said she would like to see a crossover with FNAF.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d6fs5y/cant_play_with_friends/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I don't get it. You made a refund and they accept it so you got your money back? And then you buyed the clothing and the character isn't locked?
---
Because if you use a perk or an easier to use killer as a killer, you deserve to get insulted in chat amirite?
---
So long as nobody gets insulted for doing stuff the devs intended you to do, I don‚Äôt mind. Also he didn‚Äôt say face camp my boy, and he specified he knew they would dry hump the hook to rescue and not actually do  gens.
---
Those traits are as accurate as Instagram bios
---
Yeah As a killer I think props to the survivor for taking his time in a locker for a maybe stun.
---
Let's mix it up and make it both- 11 and 13 combined for ultimate terror!
---
I need this now.
---
They nerfed legion, added plague and Jane, added ash from ash vs evil dead, added the endgame collapse, added ghost face, fixed Freddy and bad ham got a rework, and added Steve, Nancy and the demagorgon from stranger things. I‚Äôll go more in depth
---
Legion can‚Äôt deplete the mend timer any more, and mend doesn‚Äôt go down while in terror radius. They also nerfed his movement speed while in frenzy and changed some add ons, but his normal speed is a normal killer speed
---
Plague is a new killer who weakens you by vomiting on you, just don‚Äôt cleanse against her unless your team is cleansing. You will remain broken but she will not be able to hurt you with her vomit. Jane is just a thicc survivor
---
Ash is just ash from ash vs evil dead.
---
The end game collapses. When a door is opened or the hatch is closed (killers can do that now) a timer begins. If your still in the game when it depletes, you die.
---
Ghost face is basically a mini Myers, every survivor has their own stalk meter, but it is filled more quickly. You can crouch and lean from corner to stalk more easily. The reason for the stealth and stalk is because if survivors stare at you for long enough, they cancel your ability. 
---
Freddy puts survivors passively to sleep. He can hit them when awake as they are in ‚Äúmicro sleep‚Äù and he can place Portola that slow survivors which with an add on, can be turned into dream pallets were pallets that aren‚Äôt they appear there when they are asleep. He can also teleport to generators. You have another way of waking up though, you can find an alarm clock which gives you another 30 seconds before going backing into micro sleep.
---
Steve and Nancy are just cool survivors. The demagorgon can place Portola and while standing on them, he can traverse the upside (teleport to another portal) he also has a pounce attack which lunges him fowerd. It can hurt survivors. 
---
Some perks have been changed
---
Left behind now shows the aura of the hatch when within 32 meters when you are the last survivor.
---
Dying light now gives a debuf to survivors depending on how many times OTHER survivors have been hooked.
---
Dark sense reveals the killers aura whenever anyone completes a gen.
---
 
---
That‚Äôs pretty much everything. Oh yeah bill is on console now.
---
Breathing and pain sounds are two different factors.
---
If that is the case now, they need to change the perks so that their descriptions are reflected accurately.
---
Makes me kinda sad too cause like, the idea is there, it just hasnt been executed as well as it could have been. Demi feels weak and easily predictable, he's one of the killers I'm intimidated the least by which sucks cause I was really excited for him to be added
---
I mean hes not the authority on anything. He is all allowed to belittle anyones bad choices.
---
I won‚Äôt buy the scoops hat though because screw company policy
---
Mechanically, the Demogorgon has the stronger power set. People are still learning to use it, but it will be a top-tier Killer. 
---
Demo does have more counterplay to its kit than Billy does - and it's certainly harder to use - so I don't know if it will eventually achieve higher kill rates than Billy, but its power *is* stronger.
---
I‚Äôm the person who‚Äôs saved all the other survives even if it cost me my life... ya welcome
---
Same situation but with Bubba as I don‚Äôt have the perks I need to farm good with anyone else, and Demogorgon isn‚Äôt that fun to play without perks unlike other killers.
---
I use BBQ, Ruin, Pop and Sloppy. Sometimes Nurse's.
---
The ones I don‚Äôt get are when as killer I get a 4K and someone types gg ez....
---
The second part of croak is silly, I think it should stack. The first time a survivor misses a skill check their aura is revealed to the killer for 4 seconds, add 2 seconds additional each extra time they do this. Some people will be up to 12 second reveals by end of game :P  
---
It would help with both hunting the weaker prey OR knowing the dweets and going easier on them depending on the killer's disposition at the time.
---
i am suffering from this for sure. i got this game about a month ago and i really enjoy playing killer but more often than not im put up against people who have thousands of hours of experience that completely destroy me every game.
---
You must be new here.
---
who hurt you?
---
I played with a baby Demo and Myers the other day. I offered to give them a free hook they both said no. The poor demo tried to leave the map through the exit gate and I just watched them. I think they gave up after a while because they refused to hit me but I waited long enough by the exit gate that a Nea camping the hatch got killed by the EGC, so that's good. Point is, be nice to baby killers, give hatch to baby survivors. (Except for the Meg who refused to open the exit gate after I took her there twice)
---
Hopefully I'll run into you =) (PS4) I never face The Nurse. I like her, HIGHLY respect a good Nurse. Very rare to come across since she's hard to master.
---
Ever since the Scream dlc, I can't track anybody. It seems like scratch marks go wherever they want. Ormond has always been a shity map too.
---
So don‚Äôt buy ash, bubba and all the dead by daylight dlcs, and sprinkling in some cosmetics. Got it üëç
---
I'm waiting for some youtubers to get it and show/tell me about the performance.
---
The game is already hardly optimized on PC and i've heard things about the console version.
---
TBH i expect this game to turn my switch into a burning tire, while i play with my 10FPS.
---
But we'll see.
---
You're thinking head on and when they have both, that move will cost you a gen :P
---
Noone. Just calling out shit content when i see it
---
*Morgan Freeman* narrates everything he does.
---
It‚Äôs like hag you get easily distracted with the amount of traps/portals you have except she knows when people go near hers so she finds survivors but it‚Äôs pot luck finding survivors by using the abyss ability to sense people close to portals. Once people know how to prioritise better with him and find good portal spots opinions will change.
---
I'm sorry I can't hear you over the sound of me one hit downing people with cross map chainsaws. Demo doesn't fit the criteria for a good killer. His 'pressure' tool has a cool down and zero use in a chase. Unless a killer can shave time off a chase or abuse human psychology with their power then they're always going to be weaker than the big three.
---
im also on ps4 :)
---
The hallowed blight?
---
Yawn.
---
Hmmm... ok then. Ill just instantly rush the locker or put traps on ones I expect them to use-and that‚Äôs a trapped survivor before I could finish my sentence.
---
It hurts my soul seeing red or purple ranks purposefully abused the rank system to bully new killers and then stooping so low to trash talk them after the match.
---
No, Iron Will does not affect volume. It's "Grunts of Pain are reduced by 50/75/100%". It's frequency,  not volume. How often you grunt, not how loud it is. With No Mither, it's frequency as well, not volume. That's why with No Mither you sometimes cry at normal volume, sometimes are silent. Not constant crying at half the volume.
---
Devs have said that all characters are 18+ when asked about ages.
---
Good to no it wasn't just me then I first thought maybe I came in at rank reset but after few games it just kept getting worse
---
To the two of you
---
You must be trolling! No way you are rank 1 and don‚Äôt understand how to get the adept achievement for killers. You can only use the 3 teachables for that killer.
---
Btw, if your asking for help on a thread, it‚Äôs best not to belittle or go after the people responding.
---
It is getting more common.  I even teamed up with a rando in mics and heard the process.  It‚Äôs mostly teenagers getting angry for getting hit early or hooked early.
---
You're right, but you need to remember that a large chunk of objective control is reliant on hooked survivors. Billy can be looped. While being looped, gens are being worked. Once you get a hook, you can definitely apply next generator pressure much more quickly.
---
Spirit can get a survivor hooked much more quickly than Billy (assuming that both players are playing at the full capability of each killer) and apply gen pressure much sooner.
---
With that being said, the lower the rank and the lower the killer's efficiency, the better Billy would be than Spirit.
---
138 comments and *not one* note block rendition of the theme music.

That makes sense.
---
Lol. My first 3 games as survivor I was failing every skill check and getting caught first only to die in the struggle animation. I constanly yelled at the screen "Im pressing the damn button! Why the feck doesnt it work?
---
I know. I think you responded to the wrong person.
---
Ayye
---
Only way youre doing that is if youre purposely doing it and definitely wasting time.
---
Banished to the fucking shadow realm
---
Lol
---
Same here. I don‚Äôt wanna go against people and have poo poo perks
---
His addons are so boring and bad I really struggle to choose any whenever I play him. I just go for more skillcheck regression and meme with lullaby which gets destroyed in 10 seconds.
---
I want an add on where you go through the pallet, breaking it and still chainsawing
---
SWF is Survive With Friends. It‚Äôs where you and up to 3 other friends can form a party and play against a random killer instead of your friend being the killer.
---
What if he's camping and he smacks me while I'm running over to save and the unhooked goes down immediately? He shouldn't be able to nullify one of the few anti camping perks.
---
Yeah i do that
---
Cant wait to see all 4 locker Dwight
---
We put on badham and 3 of us run head on and vigil and continuously set up in the upstairs and downstairs hall lockers while a no mither guy rushes the gens
---
Rank reset ftw lol
---
Huh, weird.
---
2nding the Kane Hodder thing, man is amazing, plz show him some love!!
---
For sure, those killers are absolutely screwed. The Demo in its current pre-hotfix is unplayable on that map, you absolutely need the pallet smash perk.
---
I don't quit matches but on my 3rd in a row I had a strong urge to.
---

If you‚Äôve got twitter go show this lil guy some love

Mine rn is BBQ, pop, ruin and 4th depends on situation. Usually I run enduring as the 4th but if I see 4 toolboxes I throw in Franklins.
---
I think he has a lot to manage which can feel very different from other killers. I think Freddy is the only other killer with that much to manage. You know like demo has to put down portals teleport to them at some point to activate them and then chase but oh no someone destroyed your portal let's go do it again and then teleport and Yada Yada. I noticed that he's easier to beat when you know he's trying to guard a gen and you just distract him by breaking that portal over and over again. Had a guy who I did that with in the double staircase Haddonfield house and eventually he kept checking lockers cuz he couldn't find me and I kept breaking it. It's a lot to manage and easy for survivors to go against. Granted I have played some really good demos but they lost most of their kills still and ended up face camping one in the end and I feel bad when I see a killer do that because most of the time they don't want to. Wow this was a rant sorry
---
You can't reveal ghosty if he's leaning and you can only see his head, the detection part works on his torso, so you have to look at his full body to reveal him ^^
---
Ok thanks for letting me know!
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people DC at this point. You screw your team over so badly. Had something similar happen and I hooked the survivor who had been taunting all game. He immediately DC‚Äôed (first hook, 4 survivors, 1 gen remaining). The crappy thing for his team was that was the only hook in between the gens if he died and broke it, I would‚Äôve been at a disadvantage for hook.
---
29/32 maps are outdoor, and you're still not satisfied?
---
I hate the new map
---
I don't really understand what you're trying to say, but from what I can tell, you're underestimating the survivors ability to loop.
---
Ormond is also extremely hard to see certain auras,  hate that map as both the killer and survivor tbh. They almost need a colourblind mode for that map to make things easier to see
---
Right now I‚Äôm using ruin, surge, thrilling tremors, and infectious fright. But I‚Äôm contemplating changing infectious fright for bbq but over all this build has been going well or I‚Äôm just getting low skill survivors haha
---
No problem!
---
How do you see out of Susies mask?

Her kit is fun, not her add-ons.

Every single one of these "I'm going to post a meme daily until X happens" always ends up petering out and being completely pointless.
---
No matter what it's for, it doesn't end up working. BHVR doesn't base their decisions based off of reddit. You're basically saying "I'm going to shit on my neighbors porch every day until the Grocery store brings back the potato chips I like"
---
See: Whispers.
---
Shred hit box feels so weird. Sometimes it hits survivors when it shouldn't and when it really should it doesn't. I just feel like something needs to be tweeked to make him easy to manage. I always wished he could teleport wherever to a place. I mean but that may be too good. Idk
---
Wouldn't it be "To waste time"?
---
I‚Äôve been playing the shit out of demo since he came out. I can‚Äôt be on all the time since school and work are a thing.
---
Yea, I get it.. But if I say "The first time I played soccer as a viewer I had a lot of fun.." And, in this case, you knew I meant as a soccer player, Youd be like.. "You mean as a soccer player?" Or would you just hear it, think it sounds dumb and move on.. Ill take the downvotes for trying to help people, its cool...
---
It was to make the game better for people with low FPS. It makes a big difference when you're playing on a crap top. As a former person who struggled with the FPS, Im fine with the change, even if people look a little worse. Most of the cosmetics still look decent on the highest graphics/resolution.
---
Thanks bro  I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed!
---
Eh, not really. If you use her terror radius, she can definitely get gen grabs without prayer beads. Everything else just enhances her gameplay which can be fun but nothing major.
---
You can check out some of the progress pictures on my Instagram

https://www.instagram.com/zeroherocosplay/
---
Such a cutie, hitting you over the head with a machete and gently putting a hook through your shoulders. Its just his way of saying "I *do* care".
---
I‚Äôm more of a killer main and still think ‚Äúgen rushing‚Äù being a term makes no sense. What do we expect survivors to do? I‚Äôm even on the fence about body blocking. It‚Äôs obnoxious when you have a 4 man swf coordinating it, but under normal conditions it‚Äôs a decent tactic is some situations.
---
Look how they massacred my girl!
---
How would he carry the survivors tho?
---
I would personally love it as he could be an amazing stealth killer.
---
He doesn't need ultra rares
---
how can u juke in console ive been trying more for the past few months and cant get it down.
---
You're going against people who don't know how to juke if you're downing them with your chainsaw. Billy is tremendously easy to juke, as long as you're half paying attention.
---
You obviously don't teleport with Demo to close distance fast, you use Shred.
---
framerate glitches on console
---
As a non-toxic Ghost Face main, I can appreciate this post :D
---
Fuck you, dumbfucking asshole
---
*Hahaha I do that*
---
lack of playerbase methinks
---
It‚Äôs not that deep
---
I always had trouble with chases and escaping, I had spine chill for most the part till I tried out Lightweight and I've avoided the killer way more than not since then.
---
I think Tuesday I had a run in with a baby demogorgan and this one Jane ran him around the entire game and they all left so I ran after him and left him sacrifice me. Then sent some tips and tricks for being killer and so now we play together whenever we‚Äôre on
---
People always complain about gen rushing when they're not applying pressure well enough.
---
Gen rushing exists, but it's not 3 gens being done when you're in your first chase, that's just an unfortunate reality of the current game design.
---
Gen rushing is when you have someone hooked while chasing another, and the two safe people finish 2 gens while letting the hooked person get into struggle state and die on first hook, the 'gens before friends' way of playing.
---
Can't forget the Spirits hair. It looks fucking horrendous and it just goes everywhere making it look even worse however for Clown and Plague they look much better with their new hair changes and maybe hillbilly(leatherface and Pigs actually look better too)
---
What in the *yes you are correct*
---
Might not be her jacket. Unless the legion gang just happens to be made of middle aged hobby murderers.
---
Just been playing it more, totem spot right by one of the exit gates and one at the top of that weird white tube you can jump down. There's another on the ground level that's really hard to describe, it's like between two of those big structures you can't see over in a small room.
---
Holy shit this games community is just the most toxic thing I‚Äôve ever seen
---
You got a snapchat? And what do you play dbd on? PS4?
---
Those sweet, sweet salty lips of Vigo.
---
if he's throwing to block a loop don't go for the loop. he slows down when he charges his throws so it gives you an opportunity to put space between you and him without using the loop
---
You don't have to be 18 to be a killer. The devs haven't confirmed their age for a reason. Its clear that at least one of them is below 18 if not both Julie and Susie. Susie is most likely 16 or 17 because sophomore year is for 15 and 16 year olds. Which means at the very most shes 17. But its very clear that they're above 15 at the very least. Once again the Lore is up to interpretation. If you believe no one in Legion is a minor. That's up to you, and there is nothing wrong with assuming so. Since there is evidence to support both claims.
---
He could drag them across the ground
---
I need a Gremlin as a killer
---
I play Killer on PS4 and have only played Demo like three times.
---
He's honestly really fun to play and his power is cool if used right (I pulled off two grabs and at least 4 jumpscares in one game using the teleports) it's probably just that every Killer without Ruin or a high mobility power gets genrushed to hell because it's the current meta. So people use their mains to combat it rather than some new Killer.
---
Personally I'm just trying to P3 Trapper, P2 Nurse, and get all perks on Legion so I'm playing them more than Demo.
---
Nope, because all the indoor maps we have are pretty fucking bad. This one isn't better.
---
I was spectating a match I finished. I had already opened amd exited the gate. The dwight was the last survivor left in there with freddy. He was in the dream state and for some reason when he crossed "the point of victory" through the exit gate he couldn't leave the match.Freddy ended up grabbing and hooking him. Is there a hex or perk that does this? It definitely wasn't remember me, as no one got hooked.
---
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm in in the minority but I think Billy is OP as is. He can 1 hit down, he‚Äôs one of the fastest killers on top of that. Plus for his 1 hit down it doesn‚Äôt take long to charge it.
---
Yeah. On the flip side I got my gf into the game and she‚Äôs constantly being tunneled and facecamped until she doesn‚Äôt want to play anymore. And since matchmaking is trash she‚Äôs rank 13 and the killers are red ranks. It got to the point where she just doesn‚Äôt like playing anymore. 
---
Yet when I play killer I avoid facecamping and tunneling and get demolished by survivors and teabagged constantly lol. I love killer but I suck at playing them.
---
I‚Äôm mostly a killer main, and disagree. Actual face camping and tunneling is bad because it completely ruins a players game. You wait 5-10min in a lobby to walk away with a w thousand BP. Killers can use other tactics that are effective, but survivors have to get gens done, typically the longer the game the greater the advantage to the killer. 
---
That being said there‚Äôs definitely some misconceptions about tunneling. If you get I hooked and run straight into me, I‚Äôm going after you, that‚Äôs not tunneling, that‚Äôs poor play as a survivor... believe me, I do it all the time as a survivor.
---
* Screenshots highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Yea the shred  hitboxes are really weird and they definitely need tweaking same for ghostfaces detection feature, for teleporting it's fine where it is because if you could teleport when you want that'd be insane for map pressure
---
That scene with Richie in Chapter 2 was epic
---
Why do survivors feel like they deserve a fighting chance it‚Äôs the end game your team already lost you had the chance to get the hatch and that enough
---
looks more like u got what was coming :/
---
Took a bit of time, just keep practicing. Wiggling your joystick also side to side super fast makes them second guess which way you might turn.
---
Yea I know luckily I grinded 1 million and a few dailies and with enough shards to buy a perk and managed to P1 him I'll probably p3 him by the middle of next week. Man it's gonna suck grinding but it'll be worth it because I'll main the demogorgon
---
Am I the only one who plays huntress? Seems like it when I go online. Her hatchets are so op and so fun to play with.
---
I'm sorry but Billy's have been dominating survivors since the dawn of dbd. Bad Billy's are easy to juke, good ones are not. He has only become stronger thanks to far less pallets and bbq. I think you're just playing bad Billy's. The quality of skilled killer mains in general has gone way down since I first started.
---
Yea but that tremendously increases how much evil within you have to gain, you ain‚Äôt getting it off until all the gens are done
---
Inb4 EA bad comments
---
but billy is stronger than huntress across the board in terms of map pressure so... i am &gt;:|
---
Buh she can Heul!
---
The match-making seems to have somehow become even more broken with the new patch.  It's like it's completely random and not even sort of based on rank anymore.
---
You'll get a lobby with 2 red rank survivors, two grey rank survivors, and a green rank killer.
---
You have no idea what lag switching is. The game is bugged, quit blaming other players for things you don't understand.
---
That‚Äôs great! I had to play a good amount of killer to get points faster since I can typically grind out ~100K per match whereas with survivor I‚Äôm lucky if I get 60K. I can‚Äôt wait to see P3 demogorgon.
---
Nah
---
Best ideas I have are use addons religiously, get exposing perks or STBFL, or just pretend that your them, ie doing little movements with your cursor that fits their personality.
---
Replace BBQ with Discordance or Overcharge
---
as a toxic nea i approve
---
Two points:
---
1) Billy is already high tier.
---
2) Without there being Ultra-rare addons, that means he gets more ebony moris.
---
It's kinda the same thing with the killer bp offerings. That's why I don't like using the more hook bp ones, they always make me play against 4 man sfw groups lmao
---
The second would need to be a hex perk like noed so it might be something like ‚Äúactive at the beginning but the effect takes hold once 5 generators have been completed.
---
Maybe the portal was too far away, but had you activated the portal by traveling to/from it first? You only get the killer instinct effect from portals that have been activated.
---
So Billy has trippy farts?
---
Was dying light changed at all? It seems like changes sometimes cause issues along with the new stuff.

Who knows how accurate it is but Amazon for it says "Dead by Daylight: definitive Edition Nintendo Switch content Overview - dead by Daylight (base game) - shattered bloodline (chapter) - curtain Call (chapter) - spark of madness (chapter) - of flesh and mud (chapter) - the 80S suitcase (cosmetics) - the Bloodstained sack (cosmetics) - headcase (cosmetics)"

You'll get cosmetics with unique abilities. The more pieces you wear, the higher the setbonus.

My claudette set has "increase your chance to get lobby dodged by 20/40/60%"
---
While the nea set has "increase your chance to get tunneled by 10/20/30%"

She may have got me, but she got the locker juke to flashlight click combo, you can‚Äôt recover from that, I broke her mind
---
I wish your progress could sync between platforms.
---
Dang, respect to him lol
---
Nice stun though, legit made me laugh out loud
---
I‚Äôve just been playing new killers plus i don‚Äôt have demo yet. If you see a wraith with just shadowborn on that‚Äôs me.
---
Edit: Just realized you‚Äôre PS4 while i‚Äôm Xbox.
---
Son, why do you have this?
---
Camping is not the best strategy, although when starting out as killer it surely will seem like it. When you first play killer, you'll find out that survivors will come to the hook regardless of you being there or not. When playing against more experienced survivors however, you may find that 3 gens pop during your little camping session and no survivors show up to safe the guy, when they do, they use borrowed time and at this point, 3 survivors are destined to escape
---
No joke, yesterday someone messaged me saying how I camped my hex. Now, if I lose you for 5 seconds, isn‚Äôt it reasonable that I assume you went to my ruin, since you know where it is??
---
&gt;"According to Susie's hoodie, which is definitely a graduation hoodie, she graduated Fairview high school in 1996. Canadians graduate high school when they're about 18 (17 if the student in question's birthday is after summer)."  
---
Just in case you missed that part.  
---
I would love to see some evidence pointing toward *anyone* in the Legion being a minor.
---
Yeah I dont think many people are considering how annoying this would be lol
---
Nope that's why many people farm up 1,000,000 BP before hitting the prestige button. That'll get you pretty close to lvl 30-40 depending on how you play the entity in the bloodwebs. Helps so you won't have to spend time playing a 1 perked character on either side.
---
What system? That may have been me on plague.
---
:)
---
We both got some
---
FUCK!
---
They were taken in the 90s, so they are still the same age as they were back then. Also in both of Susie's body cosmetics it says she took the hoodie from lost and found (go check for yourself) so it doesn't reflect her age.
---
And again, it's essentially confirmed that Susie is a sophomore based on the name of one of her cosmetic sets. It's called *Sophomore Jitters* and you can see it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a6vch8/for_all_of_you_18_people_better_watch_sexualizing/) She is 15-16 years old.
---
How original
---
They scream like a crow? What if I'm a bodyguard and I wanna fight like a crow?
---
I played against Tyde before. Dood is not good lol.
---
I appreciate you not throwing Piggy in the dumpster the way some ppl on this sub seem prone to.
---
Haven't noticed that. Where you running fixated? It should only buff walking speed but i wouldn't be surprised if it was bugged a little bit
---
Lmao were you that trash freddy on Haddonfield that was camping your Hex Ruin?
---
Well done! I‚Äôve my Nancy and Demogorgon at 50 and my Steve at 30. Once I get him to 50 i‚Äôm gonna Prestige Nancy.
---
Also I think i‚Äôve played with you before lol
---
Your rank 20 is showing
---
This perk is countered by survivors wiggling in a pattern, unless the fake aura copies the real aura exactly.
---
Dude where is the logic behind what you just said?
---
Lol yes
---
She can be very good or very bad in my experience so i didnt really bother bringing her in.
---
I believe you could be rank 1 but you still need the 3 killer teachables to get adept. Just being rank 1 doesn‚Äôt exempt you from that rule.
---
you get more huntress players the higher your rank
---
I hate to be that guy, but killers with very poor internet should be penalized. Its super unfunny playing against that. Hoping "dedicated" servers can remedy this a bit
---
No the only perks I was running were balanced landing, decisive, inner strength and another perk but I forgot
---
Okay

Deja vu finally vital?

Monitor &amp; Abuse, and nurses are a must have. Then the two other are your choice.
---
Really? I thought Billy had fallen out of favor.
---
I actually forgot to check Killers lol. I was going to though.
---
Yeah Spirit noticeably looks way worse. I haven't been able to play Killer much however due to my crappy internet.
---
Yeah, I was killer. Game hates me sometimes.
---
You should look up Otzdarva's trapper gameplay. He plays a real mean trapper.
---
Glad you thought so :D
---
I couldn't read all of that but starting with a bear trap sounds awesome
---
Lol imagine using head on not wanting to get as many as possible
---
Oh yeah generic r/gaming jokes. How funny
---
It sounds like a great perk and sounds like it would be a lot of fun, I‚Äôm curious if the survivor who is hooked can counter it by spamming attempt escape on first hook. Will the aura remain still or will it show them putting their arms up because of spam?
---
Ok cool, thanks for the tip. Stbfl is "save the best for last" right? Is that a universal perk I can via the bloodweb or a teachable from someone specific?
---
Edit: Just checked, it's a Myer's perk.
---
BHVR would just be flat stupid if they didn‚Äôt add any more. Lol. That‚Äôs a shit ton of revenue. They won‚Äôt not take advantage
---
Yeah that might throw people off on closend maps (lery,game,lab) but on open maps they'll be looking out for you once they hear the humming. Also after the first hit good survivors will notice it and play more paranoid
---
I will speak on Amanda‚Äôs behalf, she‚Äôs one of the only killers who‚Äôs power is based on chance, either you‚Äôll easy kill like 3 survivors before 2 gens get done or you‚Äôre bullied hard and let a 4K, imo NOED is almost necessary because of how unpredictable a game is going to. 
---
Tips; when in doubt and playing pig just be kind to survivors, the least you am do if you‚Äôre being shit on is be funny/entertaining and spread the word that pigs are survivors too.
---
Except doctors fuck doctors
---
\&gt;"[...]there is evidence to support both claims."  
---
\&gt;"My evidence also doesn't mean anything at all because lore is up to interpretation."  
---
Pick one, friend. If you claim there is evidence, you have to also provide it. If you don't, there's really no reason to take you seriously.  
---
The name of the outfit doesn't mean much. It's a reference to high school, because everyone in Legion is fresh out of high school.  
---
You don't look at the Trapper's strongman outfit and think, "Oh, he must have worked at the carnival for some time."
---
Loud as fuck too, always gets annoying
---
Ggwp
---
You should try him with play with your food, it's really scary.
---
Yeah yeah that's what I figured
---
Oh it gets worse, I got called trash for killing everyone without using my power! I was Micheal and I never used tier three and still one and that made me the bad one somehow?
---
Ow I knew I‚Äôd be downvoted for that. I‚Äôm not that good with her though
---
Well said
---
What if you power the exit gates by yourself if they‚Äôre slugging? It‚Äôs still almost impossible to get out in this scenario
---
Oh wow he deleted it all what a puss lol.  I hate when they do that.  It was pretty silly man.  Dude unprovoked got really butthurt about any discussion of NOED and he went on this long tirade about how the Hatch is the biggest crutch in the game and how there shouldn't be one at all and how NOED is fine and how it's the hatch that is the biggest crutch in the game...It was interesting attempting to connect the dots on that one.
---
I'm fine unless you face camp me, then I'll waste my time getting banned for 24 hours and it'd totally be worth it
---
There are several perks that get hosed by freddie's lullaby.
---
Borrowed Time doesn't work (found that out the hard way yesterday), stake out, diversion. basically anything that relies on being in the heartbeat to activate.   
---
I don't know if this is intentional or not, but I really think these perks need to work when in the lullaby just as they would with the heartbeat.
---
I‚Äôm learning the spirit atm after like 10 miserable games with nurse. Fuck that shit. I hear she‚Äôs super strong, but god I feel like she‚Äôs super hard to play.
---
Clown is good. Even if you are about to get blinded throw the bottle, they'll either move or their flashlight will be cancelled because direct hits cancel actions.
---
This is pretty much me when I let my roommates try to play killer.  
---
I spend the whole time basically going through these phases:
---
1.  "Ok, search the generators.  Yeah, that shit that's red, go toward it!"
---
2.  "Look, you found somebody!  Stop--wait--what the fuck are you doing?  Chase them!"
---
3.  "Follow the red marks!  No!  What the fuck?!  They ran away.  Why the fuck did you turn around?  Follow the goddamn red marks!!!"
---
4.  Ok, well, they're completely fucking gone now.  Next time, follow the red marks.  Now, go back to the red generators..."
---
One of my roommates actually managed to hook somebody once, and he camped them.  I was like, "uh...it kinda sucks what you're doing right now."
---
And he was like, "nobody ever thought of this strategy before!  This guy's gonna die."
---
honestly, sometimes I wish freddy hadn't gotten a complete rework of his power, I miss the old freddy, at least give me an add-on to play as old-freddy
---
I dislike that a big portion of the community is so toxic to new killers. I mean this is common with alot of gaming communities. But its nice to see some people can be nice on the game. I respect those people. You are wonderful people.
---
I would say Ghostface, the perks Ash comes with are pretty bad and Ghostface is really fun to play as and his perks are way better in my opinion.
---
Well they are buffing him so that he can break pallets without having to bring the ultra rare add on for his power, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for
---
To be honest, they probably didn't factor in any lore reasons when coding in oblivious. Doubt they gave it a second thought. Freddy's lullaby to them was probably something that they just thought made sense to stick regardless of whether awake or asleep. But maybe this is something they explained in a dev stream and I missed it, or they will explain in an upcoming one.
---
You bring up a fair point though that if one is oblivious how should they be able to tell that a killer is approaching them via a terror radius or a lullaby. They should have no clue when the killer is approaching them per oblivious' own description.
---
How much scarier and better of a killer would Freddy be if he had zero terror radius or lullaby when you fell asleep? That's one way to make sure that survivors will ALWAYS try to make sure they are awake, and it makes going into Dream World a living hell. Shiiit he might be better than Spirit if that was the case. Ya know, the more we talk about this the more I like the idea. They should change it so that you don't hear any lullaby or terror radius when you are asleep. Only thing asleep survivors should hear is the chase music once he first hits you.
---
They may play more paranoid, but it wont help them. Unless they get off the gen and waste time hiding, you'll be finding people constantly. The only reason I know is because i've been running ruin, chili, M&amp;B and Nurses ever since her change and i've almost never lost with it.
---
I said GG to someone and got yelled at for it
---
Any experience with the Hag?
---
My games keep booting me out, I swear I didn't dc it just happened to fuck up when you grab me..... -_-
---
I think ghost face is a lot of fun to play but he is a little weird to get used to. If you like playing Michael, you will probably like playing ghost face. If you don't like playing Michael, you may not like ghost face. 
---
I personally don't own Ash Vs Evil dead but his perks don't seem super OP to me to where they are going to dramatically change your gameplay if you have him or not.
---
Sounds like one of my friends
---
Yeah  i p3d her but i dont play her often. Its better to say nothing than to tell something i dont know stuff about anymore.
---
To be pedantic, they running train not exactly a gangbang
---
Awful killers absolutely do not 4k unless they're playing against awful survivors.  I could easily run an awful killer for all the gens myself while the randoms do gens.  I'm one person they still got to get the other 3.  Now throw NOED on said awful killer and BAM!  Haste, instadown, equals 1 hooked with zero effort lol.  NOED is typically relied on by those that run it.  They become completely dependent on it for their kills and it actually changes the way a lot of them play.  Complete lack if gen pressure attempts and overcommiting to long chases are the usual suspects there.
---
It is looked down upon to stick to the hook and wait for them to die. Its referred to as camping.
---
Not only does it create an unfun experience for the survivors but it also deducts points from you. The longer you stay near the hook the less points you will get. You also lose points from getting another chase and hook from them.
---
It's best to leave and patrol gens and if you dont find anyone in that time go back to the hook after the save and chase the new person. 
---
In the end though you play the game how you want to! If you think it's best for you to stay at the hook and secure the kill then go ahead. Keep in mind survivors have a couple perks to counter though. Borrowed Time gives the unhooked an extra hit and there's also Decisive Strike which when you pick up a survivor soon after their hook they can "stab" you and get off your shoulder.
---
Simple NOED debuff
---
NOED should be lit from the start of the game. What are your thoughts?
---
Dood it's not survivors fault killer mains resort to spirits and Billy's. When I first started playing and had no idea how to play I'd constantly go up against camping wraiths, face camping trap under hook trappers and noed Billy's. The amount of bullying towards rank 20s is what makes survivors so bitter toward killers. Killers only got bitter when they realized killer takes skill and they cant get away with that shit after rank 12. 
---
When I started maining Myers i had a healthier understanding of their own frustrations but I'll never forget the bullying as a new survivor. Killers resort to Billy and nurse bc it's easy and gaurentees bullying and winning every match. I mained Myers bc I wanted to prove mid tiers are viable. It's not easy but I got my consistent 2k and that's what the killer balance was supposed to be. I mained spirit to prove s tiers are totally boosted even without ruin or excessive camping. Sorry but killer gameplay has far more power and control over the game. I dont feel sorry for them. Every game as surv I get snarky head nods for doing nothing lol.
---
At level 40 there's 3 perks on the bloodweb and you have the chance at 2 aswell, definitely a nice change that'll help a lot.
---
What a silly statement.  When it activated everyone is scared of an instadown wrapped up in haste.
---
Locker gang
---
Thx for the tips guys
---
Matchmaking is rough right now and you‚Äôre likely to be put with/against people who have a ton of in-game hours. You‚Äôll probably die/get your butt kicked quite a bit at the start. Just know it is going to happen and don‚Äôt get discouraged! We‚Äôve all been there!

Its not deepness.. Its basic intelligence. I can see why we have fallen so far behind other countries.

Hey look, it's all of my games since rank reset.
---
I'm still around rank 16 and I keep getting purple/red ranks in my games. Funnily enough though, they're always the ones that DC. Even when they're bringing in shit like purple flashlights and instaheal medkits they still DC the moment they get downed.

Welcome to the fog!
---
Some people would say gaurding your hook is camping and that would be toxic for the hooked player, but it's a legit stratergy. The thing is, it hurts you as well. You shouldn't be doing that if you want points.
---
What you should be doing in these cases is looking for the new survivors, and try to down the rescuer. As a hillbilly main myself, I try to chainsaw to the hook and if my timing is correct, down the rescuer as soon as they unhook.
---
Also it's not wise these days to go after the unhooked person (what survivors call tunnelling) these days. Perks like decisive strike and borrowed time can cost you games.
---
Best to not camp at all, and try to get them off those gens. Even if they end up surviving, you will get a shit tonne of points for hooking everybody twice.
---
damn Jason is strong af
---
With matchmakjng being so busted rn I feel like every other game I have to directly get in the way to protect a baby Dwight
---
I actually read *Roadside Picnic*, and the games match the serious tone and themes perfectly. Additionally, the game focuses much more on the "second" Chernobyl incident, theorized within the lore to have been created by aliens. So they essentially are *not* a game based off of the real-life disaster, though the setting is the same. If BHVR somehow managed to create a STALKER DLC (which wouldn't match the tone of DBD), I wouldn't be at all against it.
---
There's also the tiniest bit of what I hesitate to call cultural appropriation at play. The book was written by Soviet-Russians (different from Ukrainians most definitely, but that's not a good argument to start), and the games were made by Ukrainian developers. I myself am of direct Russian and Ukranian descent. BHVR is Canadian. I'm not saying they should never touch anything that's not Canadian, but it is much, much easier to write about a natural disaster in a respectful way when your ancestors, or even your friends and family, went through it.
---
EDIT: I glanced through your account and you either understand Russian or are possibly Slavic yourself. You probably know how I feel, then, when Americans or others talk lightly of Chernobyl or try to hold it against us.
---
Not knowing the survivors abilities is key to their survival, of you knew you'd build against the stronger ones and then they would be at a major disadvantage.
---
As to camping the hook, if they try to book rush then by all means defend it, but otherwise you're doing yourself a disservice by not engaging in chases. Play as you want but remember every action earns points and you get penalised for hanging around hooks for too long. 
---
You're playing as killer everything you do is an arsehole move, play the way that wins you the game, but keep in mind the fairer you play the more points you'll get the quicker you level up the easier it is to play fair and earn more points.
---
Underrated comment
---
Really? I‚Äôve found the new map really good for both. Favourite indoor map for me. Theres some really good juke spots and loops as survivor, but balanced landing i guess is essential for many.
---
I play in Xbox and today alone, I‚Äôve had just as many Huntress matches as Demogorgon.

---
Not if you insidious camp a group of heroes and M2 to insta-down 2 or 3 at the hook lol
---
It‚Äôs a perk called Head On that comes with the survivor Jane Romero. You hop in a locker and after 3 seconds, if you rush exit the locker it stuns the killer if they‚Äôre in front of it. 
---
Can be useful, mostly just has a lot of meme potential haha.
---
Let me start over. Because either you edited or reddit didn‚Äôt show me the second half of that, and you bring up some good points. My evidence is that Susie‚Äôs outfit is called Sophomore Jitters. Your argument is that trappers clown outfit doesn‚Äôt mean he worked in a circus. While this is true, that outfit isn‚Äôt a separate character in the lore. Susie is. 
---
Because of ‚ÄúSophomore Jitters‚Äù it‚Äôs easy to come to the conclusion that she is 15 or 16. There isn‚Äôt much to try to guide the interpreter to another direction either because that ‚ÄúGraduation Jacket‚Äù is found from the lost and found.
---
Adrenaline lasts 5 seconds than it's gone lol.  NOED gamers get to keep their haste effect...Adrenaline doesn't do dick against NOED.  If they stay on you they will run you down and they will get that mindless instadown they earned for losing their objectives.

It's kinda the opposite of what I'm talking about lol
---
While Terror Radius and Lullubies are clearly similar, they are different things and I understand why aren't included in Oblivious. My problem is that since Lullubies are so similar to Terror Radiuses, there should be an explanation to why Terror Radiuses are constant and Lullubies are not.

Please make this happen!! Take my money already

My vote is Hag. Obviously because ruin but devour Hope is also really fun if it works.

Actually going against better players is the best and only way to get better at any videogame.  Learn what they do, how predict and trick them

Im not saying there's something wrong with it but saying I get 3-5 a game and my squad gets 20-30 isnt as impressive if thats all set up and what youre trying to do.

I'm a baby Killer (I got the game yesterday and did maybe 5 games, I knew I'd be shit but it seemed fun and I like Huntress' design too much not to lol) and yeah, I got bullied lmao
---
Such is life, it's hard not letting it get to me to get pointed at and bagged every game but I take managing to get even one survivor sacrificed by the end of the game as an achievement rn considering my dweeblord setup of 1 single perk
---
Monthly rank resets sound rough (pretty good job so far etc), I'll probably buy the game during this free week promotion tho because I want to get better at Huntress and I like the idea of being the big bad monster of the match lol
---
Years of Destiny have hardened me to "lol noob xd" so it's not the worst, it's really just getting dunked-on in-game rather than the chat that really hurts
---
I think he meant he was disabling hooks for points
---
What if y'all had a ban phase like Siege? Survivors get to ban a specific killer and the killer gets to ban a few things?
---
Well the demogorgon is completely different to hillbilly, 1, his map pressure avoids all walls and areas that would block chainsaw, 2, it can be used to defend the basement from far away which is great, 3, the lunge is meant for scenarios like window vaults, far away survivors and open areas. It isn't fit to compare the hillbilly and Demogorgon as they're two different things entirely
---
Gen rushing is when the killer tunnels a survivor that outplayed him the entire game instead of leaving the chase and going for weaker survivors, catching the better ones at dead zones and actually applying strategic pressure on the gens and map. 
---
Learn when to leave a chase and go back to gen patrolling. Learn what gens are worth patrolling and what gens are worth giving up on.
---
Not to be political, but looking at my own school, I‚Äôd rather my teachers not be armed.

That's crazy, do you act like this with money in real life?

Only one I‚Äôve ever used is report, because killers who know they‚Äôre about to lose disconnect.
---
It straight up hit that pallet head-first and fell into a hole. If it had a human mouth, you can be it would‚Äôve busted all of its teeth out.
---
Yeah I dont get how camping is toxic when you literally turn around and see all 3 survivors within like 25m of the hook. What am I meant to do go to the gen i clearly know you aren't on?
---
Tbh toxic killers aren't as bad as toxic survivors
---
could also be true
---
Well shiiiit I'll probably have my demogorgon p3 by that time but I do need all the teachables I can get so gimme them double BP
---
Yeah, I came back to the game after a few months and was down to level 17. So, I expected to get matched against new killers....what I didn‚Äôt expect was to get matched with a bunch of purple/red ranked survivors. Bunch of new killers trying to learn the game just getting bullied. I honestly wanted to send them messages of encouragement because I know how hard it can be to learn, especially against a group of people who already know all the in‚Äôs and out‚Äôs.

Description: As the Demogorgon, I've repeatedly had players get disconnected when grabbing a survivor on a generator, while still undetectable after exiting a portal. Most recently, it disconnected all four survivors when there were at least two survivors working on a generator.  
---
Screenshot / Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PjscOzJW-4  
---
Steps to reproduce: Teleport to another portal, while undetected, grab a survivor who is working on a generator, has occurred on Coldwind Farms and Macmillion Estate maps for sure  
---
Expected result: Causes the survivor to D/C, freezes the grab animation, the Demogorgon hand freezes in mid grab while the disconnection occurs  
---
Actual result: Survivor working on generator disconnects instantly during the demogorgon grab animation  
---
Reproduction rate: Three times yesterday, once today with at least two survivors on one generator
---
I had a game earlier where I was the last one alive, and I found the hatch but as soon as I saw it the killer shut it, so I just sat there like ‚Äúwell shit.‚Äù He downed me then carried me to a door and let me wiggle off and leave. I can usually tell if the killer is a nice person so this actually happens quite a lot, I even tell my friends not to wiggle and whatnot and they get hatch most of the time cause the killer is chill.
---
Not really. Survivors have one way to do their objective. Killer has multiple ways to do theirs.
---
Actually they are just a toxic SWF who found a kitchen knife in a basement box.
---
On Console though?  I don't see a crazy amount of Huntresses up there.  We get more Spirits than anything.
---
Ah perfect timing as we just had a teenager threaten to shoot up a highschool near by but he was caught. Also this meme is a little too offensive for this sub most likely

She has 2 skins with the same jacket in 2 colors so I like to think it's just her jacket :P

You don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the point of it- A soul for a soul as it were. By doing this, you remove a strong perk from play, and if it‚Äôs Ruin, you can make back that time easily. Also, if you have Inner Strength, the health loss is completely mitigated.
---
you have a galaxy brain
---
Ignore them and go on
---
Ghostface is fun the first dlc I bought was legion and now with inner strength iron maiden is much more useful than before but Discordance is one of my favorite perks on killers who can travel across the map quickly esp if you throw in Tinkerers and bitter murmurs 
---
On ps4 the huntress dlc is free through the ps store
---
Lmao. My bad, they ran a train on her in the sewers, not a gangbang.
---
All of the aura reading perks are good on huntress , here are her top tier perks
---
BITTER MURMUR 
---
BBQ &amp; CHILLI 
---
NURSE CALLING
---
IM ALL EARS
---
&gt;Save your BPS and Gruesome Gateaus folks!
---
Unless you are hoping to get farming games, there is no real difference from using your offerings today or during the event.
---
tbh I do agree that hatch is a pretty bad mechanic but now that it can be closed it's honestly fine
---
GET OFF MY GEN YA FUCKIN DONKEY!
---
Once I figured out killers can walk by lockers just to hear breathing and always figure out which one you're in, I stopped bothering with them at all. I guess the Nurse and Spirit don't bother at high ranks because they got better shit to murder :P
---
Its Raining Meg, Hallelujah!
---
i really thought you were gonna get hit right before the last gen was finished so adrenaline activated too
---
Memorising every perk in the game is normal, and being able to guess which perks a player might be using based on their character choice and how the game progresses is the sign of a more experienced player. These things take time, however, and nobody knows everything they should be looking for within 5 hours. In lower ranks especially, try to memorise the most obvious perks are and which characters have them (for example, if there's a Laurie Strode and they're not a madman using Object of Obsession, they probably have Decisive Strike. If the David King isn't a madman with No Mither they may have Dead Hard, if there's a Claudette Morel look out for Self Care, if there's an Adam Francis expect Deliverance, if there's a Bill Overbeck be cautious of Borrowed Time and Unbreakable, etc. etc. I could go on all day.).
---
The matchmaking is fucked, it is well known. Hope for new players you can easily beat up, and try to learn what the signs are before a match that suggest how good the survivors will be.
---
Camping the hook is a dick move, and depending on the skill level of the survivors they will either just finish every generator while you waste your time or get nothing done and themselves killed. The hook timer is slower and your points towards ranking up lower if you spend too much time right next to the hook. As The Hillbilly, you can move at exteme speeds using the chainsaw sprint. This includes returning to the hook. Try hooking someone in an open area, leaving, and sprinting back when the newer survivor tries an early save. If they try to run away the scratch marks they leave are visible for a good 7 seconds, so it will not be hard to persue them. It is fair enough that you might want to camp the hook when new survivors are swarming it like flies, but keep in mind that grabbing someone off of an unhook attempt, or instantly downing and rehooking a recently unhooked survivor, will do a lot more damage to the survivors than a simple staring contest will. Worst case scenario, you chase one survivor and you're unable to return in time when another unhooks, you'll still be in a chase with a survivor who may or may not be easy to down and hook, which is still a net profit. Think of it in terms of how much hook time each survivor has and how many survivors are actually out doing gens, and do what you think will positively affect those the most. There's more to it than that, of course, but you'll hopefully pick that up later.
---
I like the music, but I like it much more because it's not so DDDAAAAMMMNNN loud
---
Hate the normal chase music!
---
played 9 games last night 6 had iridescent moris. . . fun and exciting gameplay. maybe have a time cooldown on them after use? or something server side that keeps you from being the dinner item for gorgons all night?
---
&gt; I'm guessing nodding his head as if to say "no, you're not getting away" is the being a dick part.
---
You don't know that, She tbagged at the exit. I always say No to toxic survs when they are on the hook.
---
&gt; Lucky 4% yes, but also he was using NOED so, he's garbage. So fuck that guy, he deserved all that.
---
She has DS and Adrenaline and is playing claudette, If clutch perks make you garbage - Shes also wayyy up there.
---
Imo they are just perks and Noed/Adrenaline are both just passive shit that pops in endgame.
---
&gt; And one of those kills was a Mori.
---
So?
---
Nearly every killer is a worse version of billy if you put it this way lol.
---
RIP friend. I‚Äôll earn some BP in your honor.
---
Wait a damn second here.  You never said previously you trapped the shack, that's illegal.  So tryhard man.  I bet you use perks too maybe even addons as well?  So sweaty....REPORTED

Lol imagine if they give him a "pounce" attack like they gave the demogorgon, but instead of him jumping ahead, he does that weird fast-forward walk he does in the movie while showing his monstrous mouth and doing a roar to hit you.

I suck at it too.. I'm trying like half a year

---
i got p3 nancy lvl 35 ;)
---
Yep. Certain maps would be miserable for players. Thinking mainly Lerys because you could pretty much trap survivors in rooms if you wanted.
---
He doesn't need a buff you just need to learn how to play as him
---
New killer perk maybe? COUGH IT? COUGH
---
&gt;the strang thing was he did not even tunnle the guy who switched to a flashlight at the last second. He tunnled this dude as soon as we got into the match until he got him dead on the hook just as we finished the last gen.
---
Shoot, I'm an experienced killer and my first Demogorgon game was rough just not being used to the abilities. Even if a new person doesn't face a swf team like I did it's still going to be a very different experience getting used to what to do.
---
I hate that shiny look on feng min's hair now..
---
ROFL
---
Why would you run head on without trying to head on?
---
Exactly!  The old hatch was horseshit and completely survivor sided.  The new one though can and will be closed by the killer 80% of the time and makes securing 4K's slug free easier than it's ever been.  I pointed out the hatch was added by devs so the killer doesn't automatically get a 4k everytime you have 3 horrible teamates.  A lone survivor physically cannot repair gens to activate an exit gate unless the killer is playing his first game ever.  So they added the hatch as a chance for the 4th.  It's pretty killer sided now but it beats the way it used to be which was broken and feels a little more appropriate being killer sided compared to how survivor sided it was pre EGC.
---
Hag is nice but hex is rng, so I would suggest leatherface bbq and chill perfect to farm bp and show the survivors location. But that's if you are looking for a good perk if it is for the killer who ever you like the most
---
I really hope it comes out, it was the picture of Babysitter's icon.
---
Strid-him ?
---
Oh thank you, I completely forgot to mention that. I was just so excited to see 4 when I got my Nancy to level 50 lol
---
What's the top three on console? Considering nurse sucks on console.
---
Spirit, Billy, Freddie?
---
Lmao him saying ‚Äúparrot‚Äù as an insult to somebody repeating the same thing was a pretty good one tbh. Props to him for that, made me laugh
---
Do Insecticide chainsaw that look like that actually exist? Cause that thing is badass.
---
That's great dood you do you lol
---
You not husband
---
Well that sucks :/ Sorry!
---
Couldn't of alt f4 since I play on this game on PS4 so it was probably auto save. It's really dumb since I gotta play about 5 matches to get back up
---
I hate this map too playing both sides. I never see the scratchmarks! If he has iron will, I'm done
---
The portal was literally touching the gen
---
Also, what? I have to activate it, not just put ot down? The fuck? Thats.. kinda dumb
---
It‚Äôs the one upstairs, single man gen, not the portal gen
---
How do you rush exit? Hold the sprint buttons and exit??
---
That happened to me when I was playing on Tuesday on PC. They must have messed something up with the most recent update because we almost always got a killer right between our ranks before.
---
Put.. traps on them?
---
That's why I love Plague, flashlight or not you are getting vomit baby!
---
They really need to fix that jitter than happens when you unhook yourself. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass and has been this way since Deliverence was added.
---
Hmm, I would wait until a sale, then buy all the DLC and spent the rest on cosmetics. Or maybe you save the money for future DLC
---
There‚Äôs one dead zone but it‚Äôs still close to like 3 loops/Jungle gyms
---
I get that but they need to learn that playing killer is hard and takes practice and they're not gonna be good the instant they play
---
I am literally crying at the studio.

Hey, I didn't downvote you at all man, and too easy to start looping makes a killer not viable. Im not talking about looping itself, I'm talking about GETTING to loop spots is too easy with wraith... If you get hit, free loop chance. With good players it could go on forever, that's what I'm saying, and again, didn't downvote. BTW downvoting someone JUST because they would've downvoted you does nothing, it adds no good so why do it?
---
As a VERY casual player who has a decent grasp of the game mechanics (which perks work well and which ones don't for me personally), those players will learn very quickly when gens start popping in succession.  Whether they're a killer or the survivor on the hook.  I personally don't mind being face-camped if my team pops 2-3 gens while I die.  That's just me.  I personally don't subscribe to any of the hate for tunneling, gen rushing, face camping etc.  To me it's all trying to complete your objective in differing ways of different levels of effectiveness.    
---
but like I said, I'm very casual.  I play maybe a couple hours a week and my time is split somewhat evenly between private matches with friends and online with randoms.
---
This. They've stated themselves if they ever get an opportunity they'll go for it.
---
Did that change?  Last I knew the hatch didn't spawn until completed gens &gt; living survivors.  The hatch shouldn't spawn for 4 survivors until the gates are powered.  So the key breaking the game is only situations where you have the remaining survivors gen locked and they can all just take the hatch.  
---
I'll maintain instaheal is an annoyance, not a game breaker.  It consumes your med kit so you can't just do it again.  The infinite loops suck, if you have a decent looper, you just need to move on and hunt someone else.  
---
And SWF is absolutely game-breaking.  It's by far the most game-breaking mechanic in the game.  I'd be happy with them deleting that, too.
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote you.
---
I hope this becomes true. Behaviour where y‚Äôall at? My girl Nancy NEEDS that ponytail and jacket combo
---
Ah so no blood, only people screaming as they are thrown on sacrificial hooks. Cool.
---
Thank you u/JammyxWammy
---
This one is definitely the worst, but Lery's and even The Game aren't terribly unbalanced.
---
Its intestines...with glitter and confetti so its festive.
---
:D
---
Spirit's hair reminds me of Cynthia from Rugrats lmao
---
I honestly think you should just replace PWYF for Ruin. While I understand the purpose of PWYF, it's not going to help you as much as Ruin will. Using STBFL means you're running an M1 killer, which means you're already at a disadvantage. Not having Ruin on a M1 killer is pretty much a death sentence, especially if you're not running the Spirit Fury/Enduring combo.
---
Why are you booing him He‚Äôs right!

---
Makes an ass out of u and me
---
That sounds so cool!
---
We all do it lol.
---
Maybe don‚Äôt use the hatch as a crutch? I‚Äôve had plenty of games where survivors help me get to the exit gate and vice versa even when solo
---
[Nurse stuck on a meg] I dont think that this would be healthy for the game. Giving survivor a reliable way to create more defense options would heavily unbalance the game. This would be horrible for killers that rely on survivor mistakes and any of the low teir killers.
---
That‚Äôs why the player base is 99% toxic lol.
---
I'd like to think the color swap is the devs trying to make as much money as possible for as little work as possible. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I know, like at least with toxic killers they usually waste there own time and points, but toxic survivors just loop and bully killers while the others gen rush.
---
The only real way to outrun a demogorgon is to hide, if he decides to teleport from the gen you were on, immediately seal the portal, it's on cooldown so he'll need to walk back. Get back on the gen and if he comes back just rinse and repeat.
---
I play on console and its no as bad as people describe it, if you play her enough its the best killer.
---
Huh, yeah ur right.
---
alright ill try that ty
---
*pretty good job*
---
So I need to install reddit on my pc?
---
Mobile
---
With those perks and addons you shouldnt be at that rank
---
I've only played it once or twice but me and my friends had no problem all escaping. The map is so big, there's lots of corners, and there's lots of pallets.
---
The Upside Down.
---
a buff to a killer that facecamps 90% of the time? oof
---
I hate the new map so much. It's optimized poorly and I get frame drops constantly. It's the only map I can't run at 60fps. There are like 3 loops that are pretty much infinites and require bl 2 or 3 to get a hit. Also it's super tight and there are so many corridors and doors that lead to the same rooms. It's a mess. Also the noises make it harder to track survivor sounds. And playing as a survivor, don't even get me started. If I can even find where a gen is it's a miracle.
---
Already 40% off the older dlcs on steam last I looked .
---
Right now, just run Dying Light, it's "guarranteed" to get you a merciless every game.
---
If you‚Äôre good enough, you won‚Äôt be playing new killers.
---
A YouTuber made a video about it, and the big dogs of dead by daylight, you know, no0b3, damnnohtml, Demi (well, actually he just said ‚Äúochidoodoo. Goteem‚Äù but still), wobedy and monto (I cant find his exact comment but I remember it being their) were all saying that it needed to get out their more so more people WOULD know. no0b was good friends with him but started seeing his overly toxic behaviour and went on a different path, though he suspected something was up. Wobedy had some of his female audience admire ochido and they got into chats, ochido would ask for a pic, then nudes. It happend with over 7 people, apparently. He even tried it on damnnohtml‚Äôs gf full knowing that they were already dating. The scariest part about him is in his ‚Äòfunny montages‚Äô he uses the meme ‚ÄúIM GOING TO RAPE YOU!‚Äù A lot and even said it himself a couple times In random lobby‚Äôs. Which probably means he doesn‚Äôt think to much of it. Which means if presented with the option he might... ima just end this post here
---
No, hes saving that for his brother. /s
---
I find the color pallet awful on my eyes. Like Claudette‚Äôs and Survivors in dark clothes disappear inside the lodge. And the white outside seems to wash out greys like David‚Äôs default jacket.
---
Idrk why you‚Äôre complaining, clearly you belong higher based on those perks.
---
Came here to say this, among other things :D
---
Face a doc on The Game.
---
How TF did you get to prestige 3 in like 2 days?
---
You are just trying to insult me and ignore everything i said and just keep arguing random things that make no sense. You dont even want to argue, you just hate the perk because you dont even understand it, and try to avoid every counter it has. You can make whole paragraph of your thoughts about it that can be described like: noed op nerf it. Nothing more. 0 valid arguments.
---
Only 12 year old kids would care about it. Its just a game and normal adults would hang you and move on lol
---
I disagree, what should survivors do rather than repair generators? It‚Äôs survivors literally accomplishing their only objective. 
---
Actual Tunneling is an option a killer has to accomplish their goal, and it ruins the experience for a survivor. That particular survivor is likely to leave the game with less than 10k BP. 
---
Killers have options to mitigate gen completion, survivors only real option to mitigate tunneling is being a good looper.
---
I love locker perks
---
I like all the indoor maps. But I like stealth killers.
---
Unfortunately doing this strat would just lead to an easy 3 gen for the killer to patrol. The gens on the 2 ends of the map (Isolation room and Portal Greenhouse room whatever it is) should be saved for last as they're the furthest distance for the killer to patrol but people always go to and complete those first because they're the only guaranteed spawns.
---
I‚Äôve been doing this a lot now too actually. I try and pretend I don‚Äôt see them go in and go to the side then surprise them. 
---
The Head On bullies have taught me to fear the locker! Lol
---
Your terror radius and red again go away completely when you crouch after around 4 seconds, all they see is a crouching pig. They can hear your roars/ambush sounds. They can also hear you rustle grass as you walk if they listen carefully
---
ALOT of playtime. I also saved up 1m bloodpoints, 3 daily rituals that I could claim and 16k shards on release :D
---
They don‚Äôt stop playing
---
"The Hillbilly becomes Singed."
---
Your sixth point hits on a spiritual level my dude.
---
I‚Äôd do the basic BBQ, Ruin, Nurses, and choice perk
---
you¬¥re not wrong ;)
---
Wait a second how did that work? Second Wind says it deactivates if you‚Äôre put into the Dying State before you get healed... does getting grabbed from a locker not count as being put into the Dying State?
---
Any perks that cancel out stealth killer abilities will still show the killer aura/ give info even when crouched. However, you can still see her if close enough but there is no heartbeat/terror radius.  
---
  I'm trying to find some pig gameplay from the survivors POV but not really having any luck. If you play with friends it might be more helpful to run a KYF and play as survivor so you can test it out and see what it's like from that perspective?
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
I sort of agree with that. I‚Äôd say ‚Äúall 3 of their first hooks‚Äù is too specific. Definitely agree that it‚Äôs ignoring other survivors to go after another though.

I AM THE DOC ON THE GAME
---
Or a shitweasel.
---
Honestly, I wish I had more patience to get through the learning curve of this game. I love horror, the Ash Williams addition looked incredible and everything else. I put a few hours in but my god, I just don't have the time like I used to and it really didn't seem worth it. Very fun to see gameplay though for this game!
---
Ahhh that makes a difference. I thought 1 million only got you to level 35 though? I'm currently saving using my killer-main to level a couple killers to 35 for the teachable and I thought I'd need 2 million?
---
Face camping is a dumb killer strategy so it baffles me why survivors bitch about it.   But they will.  If killer is face camping, take advantage of it.  Yeah it sucks for the one survivor but the killer will learn when the other 3 escape.
---
Instead there's all this pressure on killers to play with kid gloves.
---
Personally I think is great I‚Äôm pretty new but having fun can take a bit of time to find a game sometimes but worth it
---
I wouldn't say he doesn't fit the criteria. He's not as good as Billy imo but his pounce alone makes him good and that paired with his map control puts him at 3rd or 4th best
---
Tbh, people might like one color more than the other so why not? especially if it doesnt make them stop making more skins for the character.
---
who can forget the classic smash hit:
---
BACK IN THE KILLER SHACK
---
yeah 1m gets you around lvl 35, but like I said I had 16k shards so i bought the perks from the shrine which gave me another 600k + the rituals gave me around another 100k.
---
I haven't seen this on PS4. I have only lost pips when there's a D/C involved somewhere. Maybe a new bug or something but hopefully not.
---
I just checked the [news via Twitter](https://deadbydaylight.com/en/news/dedicated-servers-status-update), and they're only live on the PTB.
---
Pushed back until Fall 2019, here's the post:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87216/status-update-dedicated-servers](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87216/status-update-dedicated-servers)
---
It seems too randomized. I don't like The Game and thats what it reminds me of. It takes me forever to find gens/survivors and theres so many weird dead ends
---
How are you supposed to know they are new. They might just suck. I‚Äôm not gonna let people beat me just to be nice
---
Wow. That dick cheese didn't even struggle. I would've let you atleast try. Makes it more exciting.
---
I gotcha‚Äô I feel like that‚Äôs my role as the survivor. I‚Äôll take the first 3 hooks for you all!
---
I feel like Pennywise‚Äôs mori would be him exposing you to the Deadlights and grinning as he watches the player float up towards the spider-entity. That or he materializes a gutter, jumps in it, and then pulls the survivor in.
---
Okay not too much power and not too much little, I'm starting to get it.
---
It‚Äôs definitely frustrating.
---
Exactly! I said it in another comment, when I was practising clown and couldn't get any hooks, I just switched my focus to mastering my bottle throws. Same with nurse, if I get a bully group I just switch focus to mastering my blinks. I've actually made huge improvements on killers I suck with thanks to bully groups lol.
---
That sounds about right. Started on wraith and loved him, but got bullied ao i got bbq and ruin and now im a vengeful spirit.
---
Yeah I guess base Myers is not too scary but I usually only play him when I have some good addons, and he has some of the most op in the game such as infinite T3 or tombstone piece. Imo when you factor in addons Myers is much better than hag (even just his greens and yellows are strong) but I could definitely see freddy above Myers.
---
 I main freddy atm and find him very strong but I only play survivor at green/purple ranks so idk what is actually harder to face.
---
Man cmon this is funny lol
---
They track RUNNING scratch marks. No scratch marks are left if you walk or crouch walk.
---
Thats me and my friend. Every time he gets in chase he manages to bring the killer straight to me.
---
Our joke is when I get the killer to stop chasing him "you got 30 seconds dude!"
---
Because i used to be garbage at leading the killer.
---
Baby(face) dweet.
---
Imagine if they screw with the fan base by adding that obsessed fat lady from Misery who moris you by slamming a wooden post between your legs with a sledgehammer.
---
I usually shake back and forth a no motion hoping they show mercy
---
I was insulted for simply being Michael. With no addons. I hope the matchmaking improves, it's awful for me too
---
Apparently people only lose one pip now, instead of two. So I assume since people learned that it has become more common.
---
Top floor pallets are the most pointless shit in the map - Windows are ok but you really have to win the mindgame of you die.
---
That being said, I love the way the map looks and the whole theme.
---
Why do I have a boner?
---
Would it actually make it across though?
---
Surprisingly that‚Äôs why i like the game. Wonder if i‚Äôll like the new map(haven‚Äôt gotten it yet) because of that.
---
It looks cool. But I hate it.
---
I love indoor maps
---
Nahh the Crimson king is wayyyyyy too powerful to be in this game
---
that has not been a thing in a very long time
---
Ur delusional
---
Ya i just say hag cause of her map pressure is good/better than myers. Myers has some good add-ons. I feel like huntress can be up there but shes so easy to juke hatchets and run around when she misses them all. Demo will be up there once we have more time with him and figure out which perks work the best for him.
---
Is this some type of porn that I'm not catching?
---
Not the sound he makes tho
---
Only because He's been around since launch and some of us are just tired of playing him.
---
Love it.
---
How so? It doesn't stack?
---
This is easily one of my favorite meme's.
---
Yeah they would have to make him a mobile killer to compensate for the fact that he's not in the slightest bit stealthy. But being a mobile killer doesn't really suit the character considering other than quick bursts of speed they're pretty slow in the original games. Not to mention that if you made his charge or something a mobility tool then you're getting into the territory of just making another (worse) Billy.
---
Non directional lullabies are obnoxiously difficult to play against. Monitor is actually good on Huntress because a great way to counter her is to create distance since shes slow. She catches you off guard and prevents you from creating distance with monitor
---
[yep](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-big-steam-library-update-is-now-available-to-everyone/)
---
I just thought about that but it might be too advanced for him, it would have to be a more primitive trap, maybe trip wires that survivors can‚Äôt see that show their aura to the Trapper for a few seconds or spike traps that when treaded on, while not trapping them, inflict survivors with multiple debuffs like blindness and exhaustion while screaming to notify the Trapper.
---
They nerfed survivors in all the wrong way. They shouldn't have destroyed chasing related things like exhaustion, pallets, window vaults, even flashlights, and instead of have created multiple objectives for the survivors or made gens take longer.
---
Instead they nerfed survivors and made them way more boring to play, hence why pretty much everyone plays killer now besides SWFs and the killer queus are so terrible
---
Keep unrelenting, unlike what the other posters are saying, or you'll curse yourself the next time you run into dead hard.
---
If you don't think the crows are useful, (are they? Please share thoughts) go iron grip.
---
Fun fact: the Trials I had was already a wee bit glitchy (me and our Feng started floating mid-unhook and the Nurse got stuck in a wall at one point) so when I got downed for the second time; I started wiggling erratically so the Nurse hesistated picking me up in case I was glitched
---
Yes please. What an interesting addon.
---
I've got 109 Gruesome Gateau's saved up from the event just for a Bloodhunt like this. It's really gonna help me Prestige and max out Demogorgon, and Nancy. I'm so relieved that this is happening, especially after the bloodweb changes that reduce the grind!
---
Im pretty sure i saw this after legion came out. Maybe another bug? Because they just can decrease animation Speed to avoid this.
---
It‚Äôs what we deserve
---
It is additive, not multiplicative. Everything doubles off the base score before any bonus Blood Points. 
---
So for example: 
---
You earn 20k in a match + 20k full BBQ stacks + 20k double blood point event + 20k 1 set bloody party streamers = 80k total
---
I gotta agree with you honestly. I remember back in the days when I felt more suspense playing killer, squeezing my ass cheeks trying to hit them and the emotional pain and anger I felt from toxic survivors. 
---
Now it's just too easy and I easily kill those pests with the recent killers.
---
I was always a survivor main, but I never felt any stress playing as survivor. I looked to killer to tense me up. Now I still dont feel pressure as a survivor, just anger at every killer having the same perks
---
A crazy old man in a robe throwing homing explosive shurikens is too powerful?
---
... wait, now that I say it out loud, I am starting to think he might be.
---
You can also add custom artwork on each ‚Äúcard preview‚Äù of your games in your library.
---
Play the match injured. When you cleanse you give the plague the ability to injure survivors at a distance which is worse then playing the match injured the entire time.
---
I end up doing this accidentally all the time. It's super fun on Plague. I bounce around all the healers though cuz I'm still new and haven't even gotten one to 30 yet
---
Hey I mean the new cosmetic are pretty good like scoops ahoy Steve and the chained demogorgon are sweet but yea this update is so damn buggy and can't forget the demogorgon can cause framedrops when using his ability on certain maps
---
OK so I actually feel a bit bad about the low effort response and came back because you deserve better. Honestly, it was pretty annoying because I went specifically out of my way to avoid speaking in absolutes and made a point to say that SOME killers may resort to maining certain characters because they've been bullied by SOME survivors. I'm not pointing the finger square at survivors and saying it's all their fault. I've been facecamped/tunneled on the hook plenty and that sucks, too. The only thing I'm trying to bitch about here is the extra salt that SOME survivors will pour on when you're already down. 
---
You yourself point out that camping is particularly common at low levels. Every time it's happened to me and I've talked to the killer afterwards, it's an 11 yr old playing their first couple of matches. I try to point them toward tutorials that will teach them how to actually play. But if you're saying it's justified to bully the people who are playing as killers from that point forward because back in your rank 20 days some of them were dopes that shot themselves in the foot at your expense, we're going to have to agree to disagree. If a killer facecamps you, I fully support bullying that player from that point forward, of course. 
---
The killer may have far more power and control over the game in many instances. But when it's a 3 or 4 man SWF, that power goes out the window. Those are primarily the people that are most responsible for the extremes of stuff that can really get you down. I understand you want me to know how you got good and now it's not an issue for you. That's truly great for you! I understand I should suck it up and Git Gud too, because that's what it sounds like you're trying to say with your point about how great you are at Myers now. I don't disagree. I'm only trying to say I wish I could do it with out feeling like I'm getting shit on by people that might have been playing this game for 3 years compared to my 3 months.  
---
It's like playing a game of tag with 4 of your friends, right? And I'm having a bad day and don't catch anyone. The other 4 players say, "Yeah, you're going to have to keep trying, but gg." I say "Ok, I will!" Or, the other 4 players spend the game pointing &amp; laughing at you and then at the end of it they throw sand in your hair and say "Get good stupid noob baby." Well, I just don't want to play with those people anymore.
---
Well, he *does* care! Care about The Entity... otherwise it'll torture him
---
You Do realize I‚Äôm siding with the camper here right?
---
Instantly left when I realized they were pallet jockeying and gen rushing, then got to this screen and absolutely bursted out in laughter lmao.
---
Yeah.
---
Naw just some mid-high tier cosplay, if the mask and helmet were handmade my hats off to The cosplayer because they both look like the retail versions.
---
most survivors complain about ebony mori's being unfair. So wouldn't that benefit survivors as well?
---
Oh, I should read her ability at least. Didn't know that
---
So the 90 degree turn is something we call ¬´curving¬ª.
---
 You can use that to go around the corner of the shack withouth getting visible first, you can use it in certain loops.
---
The mechanic behind it is that the first second after you started sprinting you can turn sharply, after that, not so sharp.
---
Never trust a downed Survivor in front of a locker. ALWAYS check the locker. Worst case you won't find anyone, best case scenario you just got yourself another downed Survivor!
---
\*whoms't
---
Same. My brother has the same experience. It's especially notable around lights.
---
Hopefully they didn't "Xbox one x enhance" the game.
---
I love the new map, both looks and gameplay wise. Even if your team is poor at chases and looping, there are a surplus of pallets (at the cost of them being quite unsafe). If the killer has spirit+enduring, I can definitely see how itd be an issue. Other than that, I like that there are pallets everywhere and not really good loops. The top floor is pretty bad, but I don't think it's meant to be a good place for survivors to go, I think the vaults are there mostly for things like lithe. Also it's important to note that they've wanted to try this type of map design before but really only talked about it (lots of pallets, not many loops), so this is their first time, they'll probably judge how well that works out by looking at escape/kill rates.
---
First of all, until you get better just use your chainsaw when you're up agaisnt the survivor's back, dont try to charge at then from a distance
---
Second of all, the first movement you make with the chainsaw can be a big turn, then it's minor adjustments. So if you're trying to get across map, once you start your sprint move the mouse slightly to get that big turn out of the way, readjust to the direction you want to go, and then it should be smooth sailing
---
I noticed when he's crouching he's superbly hard to reveal. I looked at him dead on for 3+ seconds, the entire time he was exposing me, no grass or anything around, and I got no progress on exposing him the last time I faced GF.
---
He‚Äôs powered by the infinite dimensional reactor and he‚Äôs very similar to the omnipotent Gan, so yeah he‚Äôs infinitely more powerful than the entity
---
You need to fully charge it to increase the lunge distance
---
wud fuq.
---
Use Fragrant Bog Laurel and DS, DH, Adrenaline, Iron Will
---
They want to tunnel you so bad? Fine. Just loop them for 5 gens with your hardcore loop build.
---
That‚Äôs this game for you, but what is pallet jockeying ?
---
It‚Äôs not their fault
---
Watch out body blocking as a killer is bannable, EGC was active so you might have a case but still watch out
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt let this shit get to me, it used to bother me but not anymore, not every game is shit
---
Focus on your game and laugh it off. Happiness is a choice
---
SPIIIIINNNN
---
What?
---
Overwatch does this with their reputation system and honestly I feel like it has the potential to change our community if we had a more transparent system like that.
---
Yeah she can drink the corrupted water at which you cleansed yourself and then her vomit will injure survivors. Its limited but if your not good at juking which in most cases alot of people aren't it becomes a problem. Also each cleanse gives her more of the corrupted vomit.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just not working right now
---
No the whole console turns off
---
Probably the Upside-down.
---
What's SWF? I've had some games where I've been severly outmatched (I'm rank 16 killer, entire enemy team was r8 or above) but I find ways to have fun regardless. Getting a hook when I'm being trolled feels so good
---
Ahhh I get it, thank you!
---
How does this interact with perks that are category specific like TOTH, distressing, or that survivor altruism one?
---
Me. Better than laying down doing nothing
---
u/Ps4_and_Ipad_Lover made a "How To" gif here: https://imgur.com/a/QNvwZVL

Sorry I am just taking a jab at him because I am still a bit salty about the conclusion of the Dark Tower. He was built up and hyped so much to end up looking pretty mundane.
---
I wonder if it would be better to have no collision at all or to have no stun after hitting a wall. Would look silly just running into the wall non stop, but it would also make for another pro in being able to use the chainsaw in a cluttered/indoor map without needing to stop. Just charge into every door frame or corner you want and keep going like the unstoppable madman Billy is suppose to be. And since BP gains from the sprint is based off of distance traveled, you couldn't just run into a wall for free bloodpoints.
---
As for how the animations would work when running into a Survivor. Play it like normal with you slowing to cut them down, then just instantly go back into full sprint. No re-revving needed, no cool down, just cut and run.
---
You would NEVER stop the chainsaw sprint unless you let go of M2. Or get stunned out of it from a pallet or something.
---
Yeah I just started playing and really enjoyed all the mechanics but the community has made me not want to open the game anymore.
---
Uhm rewarding toxicity with blood points? For one. Me and my bf ran a test, we went in and only did objectives &amp; altruism (totems, gens, unhooking and healing) &amp; got around 10-15k blood points. Next match we didn't touch objectives, we ran the killer, looping them, stunning them and losing them. We came out with 17-22k blood points. So they LITERALLY reward you more for being a bold toxic asshole than for doing the gens needed to escape. Maybe if they gave more points for objectives there'd be more gen rushers and fewer toxic, looping, flashlight welding a-holes. üíØ
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
I only know of one gen there and idk which way to it lol
---
Glad you got the escape but I wouldn't necessarily call intense considering the exit gate was literally in running distance after you got hit
---
&gt;Instantly left when I realized they were pallet jockeying and gen rushing, then got to this screen and absolutely bursted out in laughter lmao.
---
So they can't "pallet jockey" but they also can't do gens. What are survivors supposed to do? Just form a line in front of you and get hooked?
---
Yes he can, but that requires the item at first. Without the flashlight you cant really do anything but use pallets
---
You are the kind of person who plays 24/7 in a SWF group, then wonders why other survivors are having troubles. Git gud, and stop deflecting, nerd
---
I did that yesterday and the killer dropped me off at the hatch
---
lmao. I had a ton of shards and got the first 4 shrine perks before it reset, and then the other 4 after it reset, so i got another 1.2mil. I was able to prestige 2 on the first day. üòé and then I use a build with prove thyself and WGLF for maximum bp. I can get at least 25k bloodpoints per game and don't even have to escape.
---
I feel like it would be positive incentive,  rn the only reason to go in that menus is if someone pissed you off. If I had a reason to give more people props I'd be more likely to do it more often
---
Occasionally I give props to Survivors, Killers that were particularly nice, it makes me feel happy inside. I just wish that their report/prop system were more transparent like Overwatch or something like that, where if you report someone and action is taken you receive a notification about that.
---
I believe we all just /lost/ the game
---
The survivor one you're speaking of is We're Gonna Live Forever, which functions the same as BBQ. So if you get all 4 stacks (if it's a Tier 3 perk), you'll get 100% bonus off your base score. 
---
Distressing doesn't give you an end-game BP bonus, it just gives you increased score in the Deviousness category to help you max it out faster (8000 points.) This also goes for Prove Thyself on the survivor side with Objective points. 
---
TOTH is the same format as Distressing, I believe, just in the Hunting category.
---
Gimme that gamertaag
---
I'm kinda sick of getting this map. I get it all the time but there's so many fun maps. I love it though.
---
I‚Äôve been there. It was painful. I said ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be watching you till you get better‚Äù. He got better. Now i always ask him to stream for him or record when i‚Äôm away.
---
It's on both sides to be fair. If you camp a new guy just to secure a kill when they're so blatantly new that they hide behind a tree with half their body sticking out, that's a really good way to turn them off from the game forever too.
---
This has a double incentive too. If you're used to doing poorly for one reason or another, and usually resort to strategies relying less on skill and more on ruining the fun of the other players, then with the surge of new and inexperienced players, it's the perfect training ground to improve on applying pressure and chasing more
---
Sure it doesn't reward the payout in BP counting the additional 100% BP rewards from the event beforehand, but they do still add up. An extra 100% more BP rewarded from BPS, Gateau's, Puddings, and Cakes means you are getting 300% from your base earnings during a match instead of 200% more BP from the event alone. If you also add in WGLF/BBQ&amp;C, you can effectively earn 400% BP from the base amount. 
---
That's a 100% difference from just using the offerings + BBQ/WGLF alone, and it shows during the event when you're earning 100-125k BP per game instead of only 60-90k. 8-10 Matches = 1 mil BP on avg as opposed to  the 11-13 you can currently pull off using the perks and offerings. With matches lasting an Average of 10 mins, that's a 30-60 minutes of time saved for the same amount of BP. It may not seem like much of a difference, but is a more efficient use of your time playing.
---
It does, clearly represented by your UI image going into the dying state. OP was exploiting a bug and should face the repercussions.
---
These days, in the rare cases I go back to the game, it's only to play Nurse. That whole pallet focused-gameplay of every other Killer feels insulting.
---
I dont need that kind of answer also i dont know wtf are you talking about
---
I‚Äôm in class rn, but I‚Äôll come back to y‚Äôa once I‚Äôm home. If I remember.
---
Guarantee that'll get patched
---
1) Sometimes it is. I agree it is not 100% surefire way in every game, yet sometimes it is the only way to win, because as I already mentioned, putting pressure on 4 survivors is becoming more and more difficult while the gens are getting done. Tunneling the first survivor as fast as you can can greatly increase your winning chances. Same for camping in some cases. 
---
2) You confuse "bming" with "using camping as a strat". Surely those people got salty or just want to be dicks, like survivors prefer to teabag after dropping a pallet instead of moving to the next one. 
---
3) Same here, you confuse "necessary nerfs" with "nerfs for nerfs". Infinites, old exhaustion (or even old cooldowns), DS, Borrowed Time, Flashlights, Brand New Part, Sabotage, Pallets(amount and vacuum), old junglegyms and many (or not) more were broken and gave too much advantage. This was compensated by the lack of players' skill - there were A LOT of pallets, so noobs wouldn't fuck over their team if they just go and drop them, infinites existed so people could actually do something against a killer. Same for exhaustion, DS, BT, Flashlights. Some of this mechanics were just not expected to be abused like old Sabotage or Flashlights or infinites. But do you know why it all is gone? Because people learned how to use it and started abusing it. Every mechanic or part of the game I mentioned above was heavily abused, especially infinites and old jukes. 4 saboteurs or 4 flashlights turned killer's game into not just bulling simulator, but into "how to become a school shooter in just 5 minutes". Old DS (when EVERY survivor once picked up could've hit a skillcheck and escape killer's grasp) was broken so they nerfed it, sadly it took took long for it to become better and less toxic. What next? Borrowed time. If you remember, old BT applied its effect to both saviour and saved, but could be used once per match. Free escape ticket if the game has reached the moment where gates are opened and killer is camping hooked survivor. Nuff said. As for flashlights, just watch a video named like "dbd dev gets a taste of his own medicine". Flashlights were nerfed soon after. Old exhaustion perks had, if I not mistaken 20-&gt;40-&gt;80-&gt;infinite cooldown in the chase. Don't need to say anything else about this either. Quick heals were also a problem, when you could heal yourself in 5-7 seconds using selfcare, medkit and botany knowledge. Killers also had a history of nerfs, but not so big, since they were not that strong (if we do not count players personal skill). Facecamping was nerfed, so survivors could unhook from any direction. Nurse was nerfed later after since release (moving speed reduced from 4.4 to 3.8 if I'm not mistaken and amount of blinks reduced to 2). Noed was nefred a few times aswell - infinite duration -&gt; 120 sec duration -&gt; hex based. Mori was nerfed, so now you have to hook a survivor once. I can't remember all of them, but these are the most major once I recall.
---
Most of the survivors' nerfs were more like fixes, since most stuff they had was broken, while killers were usually buffed, because they were underpowered at first. 
---
You said game compensates killer's lack of skill aswell. You are almost completely wrong. Killers get punished for their mistakes much more than survivors. Missed hit during chase usually means you have to go on another circle and waste more time. One wrong decision (chasing a survivor for too long, defending wrong gens etc) will lead you to quick lose and if all gens are done, everything you can rely on is NoeD (if it doesn't get broken). You simply can't make mistakes, as you will lose too much time. Every killer's game is a fucking tryharding to get any kills or BP at least. You do not kill, you "apply pressure". You have to be extremely concentrated all the time, so you won't miss a survivor midchase (hello qaq and head on) or when he sits in the corner. You are the one trying to outsmart a survivor, while they just run have to run in circles and chill. 
---
4) bloodlust 3 takes a lot of time to build up, and then you just drop a pallet and keep running.
---
I mean he is right bro someone can't read it seems.
---
I'm pretty sure these 2 were confirmed already just not out til probably next Chapter 14 mid-chapter. This DLC + 3 skins was already expensive to get in one blow. Now imagine having 2 more skins thrown at you. It's not a smart business decision so I'm sure that's why they're waiting to release these.
---
I‚Äôm truly terrified... great cosplay. Scary af tho
---
We will stop when EA stops being a shit company.

Heatheeeeen

Pallet looping is toxic !!! All survivors must immediately run into the basement when the game starts and let the killer hook them.

* Perks are horribly balanced and even a 5 year old kid could find several perks that can easily be buffed.
---
* Killers are horrible balanced, and it would be fairly easy to bring them all to mid tier with a few smart changes.
---
* Killer/Survivor balance is horrible partly because of point 2. Killers like nurse are broken but the better designed ones like trapper are too weak at red ranks.
---
I don‚Äôt even own a television.
---
Goodness, this community is so toxic. Everyone's always butthurt about something. Kinda ruins the fun unless I'm playing with friends.
---
I support and will bump this shitpost until justice is hooked.
---
I need the source
---
I can see that.
---
It should be Back I'm The Lobby after dcing
---
His map should be an entire corn field
---
I love how when ghostface finds a survivor in a locker he does a little scream and then grabs them. And the survivors only sees it. Just salts the wounds more
---
Now this is a cause I can get behind
---
no thats just hitboxes
---
I have about 1000 hours in the game maybe or around there idk and I play both sides equally,ranks usually around purple or red.  on average I feel 2 survivors should be expected to escaped if every single survivor played decent. the right balance to perks and add-ons etc is kinda hard to answer.   I feel most killers are in a ok spot but not good either most lack chase potential or map presence or their abilities get flat out denied by survivors, they definitely need tweaking so they can preform better in matches like trapper has a big set up time meaning his map presence is weak at the start allowing the survivors to do generators.
---
I would perfer it to be killer sided sure it's annoying but that's what makes the game fun
---
What if Pennywise is willingly working with the entity, maybe even during his 27 year downtime? He feeds on fear and suffering so the trials would be mutually beneficial to him.
---
She's doin the worm don't bother her

Nice repost. Made with memeatic. 0/10
---
Have you tried Enduring/Spirit Fury combo? It sucks to sacrifice two perk slots to deal with one thing,  but man, as an m1 killer you feel just a little bit unstoppable.
---
How do you write to people in lobby before game starts?
---
Flex Seal
---
It feels so good when a team is so toxic and you end up killing two of them.
---
Hell yeah we're dressing up and having fun!
---
Distressing would just help you reach 8000 faster. So for example, your killer power always goes towards the Deviousness category. Say you're playing Hag and you get Phantasm Attack events from teleporting and landing a hit. You would need fewer of those attacks to reach 8000 if you're running Distressing. It just helps you increase your in-game Deviousness points to reach 8000 faster.
---
Screw that guy, not going to give him a view. He bubba facecamped the whole team in the basement and I ended up escaping through the gate and he called me trash even though I got more points than him *as survivor*
---
These are actually sick!
---
Well that doesn't exactly prove that reporting works, it just proves that they can pull up a record of your report. Of course I don't mean that it's literally a placebo box where what you type disappears into the ether. I just think their support is pretty understaffed in terms of what reports they can actually deal with in a timely fashion. Which is what leads to the common consensus of it not working.
---
Speaking of, the system other games have implemented where you're notified when your report is acted on would help a lot to reduce that consensus, whether it's warranted or not.
---
That REEEEEEE as he falls down makes this video.
---
My guy you have 2 perks
---
Playing for 3-4 months now, averaging low purple. A lot of things could be viewed as unbalance depending on your own skill level, and some people may think what you believe is unbalanced to be fair.
---
That being said, I personally think some killers def have some great perks and things like that, but I feel like majority of time it is not a problem to counter them. Survivors; alot of good perks that can sometimes end up getting the best of the killer, but at my skill rank it is not much of a problem for the killers to read the situation and counter some perks.
---
Lag switching killer
---
usually it's mid blink that I feel differences. Hand is much closer to the hip area
---
Good Billy‚Äôs can bait you to a mistake then curve you, if you try to dodge he can do a peeling curve which can catch the dodge and the wall hug.
---
Me neither. Usually after a killer is released I feel like 95% of my games are against the new killer. From what I've seen on streams he seems very complicated to play so that could have a factor
---
Freddy is very strong when you first start. After you master his powers and play the game. More hes low mid teir
---
i'm colorblind and i can't see the difference between red-yellow so perks like surveillance and "_____ makes aura glow a certain way" don't work for me :(
---
No, i just cant play the game. I cant play never had such a problem before its funny
---
It's really throwing me off lol. The frames might have something to do with it
---
It's on sale.
---
Yeah but if you force the survivor to sit there and do nothing for the whole endgame collapse or do it after 5 gens are completed and keep all 4 alive i would consider that taking the game hostage.
---
Honestly I just want iridescent engravings that have the effects of both engravings in one addon.
---
Sure, Ill take it. I do appeal to a lot of people who arent full blown stupid. And I went to a ton of parties in my day... Sorry to hurt the feels.

GODDAMN IT!

The one weekend I have to go out of state for a wedding.
---
Hell, I'm a Bioshock player and that would still scare the hell out of me. They did such a good job with Demogorgon's sounds that I'd love to see them nail the atmosphere on more killers and maps. I love the name "The Drowned" i feel like it fits him perfectly.
---
Built in Enduring and/ or Spirit Fury, just with less stun reduction since it's a passive would be pretty cool. A tradeoff could be significantly slower vaults so he's stronger vs pallet loops but weaker vs more creative ones. They could honestly make him a low skill floor, low ceiling entry level killer where he has a few passives but nothing too strong or creative with his ability. Alternatively they could do some crazy shit with Little Sister to make some super cool mechanics.
---

You were probably playing survivor. The bloodwebs for survivors had the Gateau's competing against the Fireworks in the RNG, but for Killers it was always 1-3 Gateau's per bloodweb. You could spend 10 Gateau's with Doctor or Legion (the highest BP earners) earning 1 mil BP and get a net gain of 10-20  for spending the 1 mil BP, which was insane. I have that 109 BP split up between 4 killers, Doc, and Legion have the majority, Spirit and Freddy have the rest. It was a great time to be a killer, and honestly I could have earned more if it weren't for this damn job taking up most of my time!
---
Yeah, the portal needs to be activated before you can see nearby survivors from it.  I think it's to allow a bit of counterplay from the survivors, since they can't cleanse the portal until it's activated.  I believe survivors can't even see the portals that haven't been activated yet, so you could get some sneaky stuff with that.
---
Really because I don't agree with that the game should cater to the killers being powerful I would perfer a constant 60/40 in favor of killers. When I play with friends I don't even care about escaping we just play to see who does better point wise there is no winning or losing on survivor side nor killer because of how fucked the ranking is. I personally want the game to reward you for avoiding the killer more because I feel making this game more about stealth for a survivor is way more fun and when you do get caught you most likely will be more afraid because you would have been caught off guard
---
Performance isn't bad now there are some drops but they are more tied to the fact the game is hosted by the killer and sometimes their connection goes down. There are two notable bugs right now that do effect the game but it is being worked and fixed right now. On PC if you use Dying light and get it to 5 stacks it will cause the game to crash. The other is sometimes when playing as survivor it is possible to run out of the gates and not escape. You basically are on the other side of the exit and all you can do is drop off the map reappear in the center of the map and then hope you can get it to trigger when you run back through the exit. BHVR is looking into both and they have added a bunch more tracking to figure out the first exit gate issue. I have heard some people say the issue with the gate is because of window of invincibility when you get hit not tripping the exit gate trigger

Seems more survivor sided. The only killer advantage seems like it is good for stealth killers and it's hard as hell to find gens so you'll have survivors wasting more time to even find their objective.

HELL YEAH

271 days ago? Who are you the fun police??
---
You're right, yeah. Survivor drop was atrocious. But that was where I was allocating my BP at the time more than killer. My fault though. I did end up with like 20 on Ghostface alone lol. I'm planning to play them all during the event then prestige him.
---
Technically it is not because the game will end after a certain amount of time if EGC has started. 
---
Thats like saying preventing survivors from doing gens is holding the game hostage.
---
Didn‚Äôt even give credit to the creator.
---
&gt; it doesn't actually run without Easy Anti-Cheat
---
So, you want BHVR to port 3rd party program to Linux?
---
Didn‚Äôt know it was a repost.
---
Damn you
---
Art design is the best in the game but functionality is terrible. Like you said it's extremely killer sides, *unless you have balanced landing* and then it's extremely survivor sided.
---
Both of these cases are bad.
---
I‚Äôm saying using Demo and having 2 portals at the gates but never killing anyone, just preventing the gates from opening is holding the game hostage. At that point the only way to escape is to get them to kill someone and open the hatch with a key.
---
Cancel the wedding, ez ;-)

Go on their name and tap x on it, it opens their profile

I agree with this

Sorry it doesn't please you m'lord. It was thrown together last minute for a group. If you don't like it, move on. No need to leave a negative opinion
---
Uh huh. Just happened to make the exact same image with same artifacts? Bad liar is a bad liar.
---
Absolutely amazing cosplay, I love it!!!!
---
No. I'm suggesting two options:
---
1. Port Dead by Daylight to Linux (should be fairly easy; EAC has a native Linux version)
---
2. Add a way to play the game without EAC, perhaps in different servers to everyone with EAC (so Linux users can run via SteamPlay/Proton)
---
Why don't you just comission someone to do it?
---
It's all good its happens
---
I saw it on Facebook lol. Jesus man there are worse things happening in the world.
---
While this comment made me laugh, no. There was a picture posted a while ago of us 2, Dwight on my shoulder.
---
No, like 'The time I got a car as a present'. You aren't the present, you received it. The fact that you're trying to correct him on something that is on all accounts actually correct isn't just a petty need to feel accomplished, it's also fucking wrong
---
All this talk of perks and here I am still levelling to unlock basic teachables. BBQ, and Ruin so far! Back to bubba‚Äôs bloodpoint basement I go.
---
Yes.
---
Domt care too much for it bc of all the pallets but i was still able to get a 4k on it as billy lmao
---
You're not getting the point here. It's got. Nothing to do with pressure or anything like that. It has yo do with the intrinsic weakness of killers like bubba or wraith. I'm saying I don't feel any desire to learn the weak killers because they're not worth learning for getting wins. They just can't do what the other killers like nurse, spirit, and billy can so there's no point. They aren't good. And it's irrefutable. I get that it wouldn't be as bad for getting wins when I played them, however being good at killers like bubba or wraith doesnt matter because they'll always be held back by the weakness of the character, whereas nurse, spirit, and billy, all have a rather high skill cap and you can be really strong with them if you know what you're doing, and can win a match no matter what's thrown at them. I would also add that as far as I am concerned a 4k is a win and a 3k is a narrow victory.
---
And the worst part is that if you give up and go stand in the corner, they'll just fuckin' taunt you until you close hatch or open the doors to force them out, instead of just letting you get out of the game and then you see it - WHY AM I IN A LOBBY WITH A RANK 2, 4, 5, AND 7 I AM RANK 18 FUCK OFF WITH THAT SHIT BHVR
---
Nope I've had perfect connection but I still either manage to go through survivors without hitting them or as stated get the most bullshit hits imaginable, the demogorgons shred is definitely wonky
---
Thats a shame, i like the way it works now
---

---
Saying 'I went to a ton of parties in my day' is confirming that you never went to any. People that know where they were, wouldn't need the approval of an internet stranger to feel better about themselves. Sorry, but for someone trying to act like they have a galaxy sized brain, it sure looks peanut-sized to us clearly "dumber" individuals
---
More like feetage

I personally think they should wait to penalize DC's until they fix their game crash issues. 
---
My game crashes and it DC's me loading into the match and now I've got a 10 minute cool down to play again? 
---
üëåüíØ
---
Dc against new legion?
---
R u serious?
---
Why don't you like Ruin because it definitely helps out there while it's up?  Doesn't last too long but at least buys you some valuable time early game. 
---
Ruin aside gen pressure perks in general help I love Pop Goes the Weasel.  That has helped me extend the life of 90% repaired gens countless times.  Comes in very clutch.  Discordance and Corrupt Intervention are also quite good.
---
I actually main killers known for shit map pressure so I can tell you with confidence that more than anything gen pressure is all about playstyle not killer selection.  At the start of the game head to a gen at the opposite side of the map (that's where they'll spawn).  Try and find your first survivor as quick as possible.  Those first 2 gens are the ones that usually fly so you need to be diligent in finding and downing your first survivor.
---
Next piece of advice and this is the most important one and something that a lot of players on this sub just don't get.  Leave the hook immediately!  Unless you know for a fact because they ran in front of you mid animation or you see the scratches or something, hook then leave immediately to go and pressure the gen you think they will most likely be on.  You goal is to chase your next survivor off the gen, begin the chase and end it to hook them as efficiently as you can.  The other guy will get saved but in doing so it required a 3rd or often a 4th person if they are all altruistic to leave their gens to make the save.  They'll probably spend time healing too again time off gens.  But you just hooked your next survivor so now you leave immediately to the gen of your choice to begin the cycle again.  If you can  keep this up aggressively they won't have time to commit to repairing the final 2 gens or so.  Gens pop immediately initially but then it's within your power as a killer to greatly slow down the final ones which are all that matters anyways.  End a game with 1 gen up or 5 gens up same difference no exit gate option for survivors and a decisive victory for you the killer.  
---
On top of this playstyle being highly effective against good survivors, it creates next to no salt and you're unlikely to receive BM postgame because you played a fun competitive clean game that even dead survivors should be satisfied with.  Obviously there are more specifics to go into when you talk about playing specific killers and addons and such but that's my advice in general.  Hope it helps.
---
This is horrible, why are they wasting flashlights when they should be taking turns to conserve them
---
Really? They emailed me when a player I reported got banned for throwing around a dozen racial slurs. But then again, I had to use their out-of-game report ticket. So yes, reporting works, if you follow up with an out-of-game report.
---
1) Can't comment on "fairly easy", but watching them struggling with servers and even base Windows version I'm kinda sceptical
---
2) It would be a cheater-fest with very small playerbase. Not worth it for BHVR.
---
What is the best legion build?
---
I‚Äôm not saying make it default I‚Äôm saying make it an add-on to give him a little more of an edge when it comes to chases since the shred attack isn‚Äôt nearly as strong as some of the other killers
---
I guess it just has "new map smell" to me. I still like it.
---
It can't be Pennywise. Because what the fuck are they gonna refer to him as? "The It"? "The Pennywise"? I suppose it could just be "The Dancing Clown" but they already have "The Clown" so it can't be that. 
---
Also, what the hell powers would Pennywise even have? Like... dude has fear-based powers. What would a Deadlights perk be? As nice as it would be to have him, I can't even begin to imagine what the hell his powers would be. Or his Mori. And how do you pick one or two members of the Losers Club to counter him?
---
Think about this. With Demogorgon's inclusion, all bets are kind of off. Pennywise is the obvious choice. But something else fits BHVR's naming convention better: **The Wendigo**.
---
He's not complicated. He's just more skillshot based. If you can thread the needle on certain spots, you can hit a survivor and they have literally no chance to avoid it. However, if you mess up, you lose a lot of time to recovery, and the survivors might make it to another loop
---
The reason people aren't playing him is because his portals require planning, and his ability requires precision. It's a lot easier to just play simpler killers like billy at that point
---
I like that idea. one i was thinking about was to remove the audio cue when the demo teleports.
---
That's me almost every time im downed
---
Yeah on Ps4 I had a match with purple rank survivors (I'm rank 16) and a rank 19 Hillbilly, poor guy was getting bullied by a rank 5 Nancy
---
lol who DCs against Franks mixtape still
---
I think he is just trying to reduce the people spamming everywhere. Matchmaking is currently weird probably because the discrepancies in player population (too many killers or too many survivors queueing).
---
Pug Face
---
Some killers need obvious buffs but this increase gen time shit is not a good idea. As a mainly solo q survivor the game is still skewered towards killers. Survivors who urban evade around to go down in a chase in 20 seconds are abundant no matter the rank, people who don‚Äôt know what the fuck is going on. Even more time on gens would be a nightmare, they don‚Äôt get shit done now. And it still wouldn‚Äôt solve problems that many have. Upgrading their base kits would be better. Nerfing SWF would kill the game. And solo q surv is a much worse experience than killer
---
Yea I heard, I think it would be a good addition to the demogorgon though considering that even with the buff his shred attack isn‚Äôt that powerful
---
* For non-text posts (images, videos, ...), referring to the game in the title is not sufficient. The main focus of the post itself must be on Dead by Daylight. The rule of thumb is: if you can post the exact same image/video to another, completely unrelated subreddit without changing a single thing in the image/video, it is considered offtopic.
---
If you think killers have an easy life you've never ever experienced any killer match above the rank of 10. Killers rely on survivors to make mistakes, optimal survivors are nearly unbeatable while there are only 3 (arguably 4) killers that actually can have a power role in red ranks. Killers are borderline weak, gens are too easy to repair and they fly too damn fast making ruin important just to have the game lasting longer than 5 minutes. Killers get more bloodpoints because survivor bloodpoint scoring events don't make sense (the survival category being broken). Queue times are still long sometimes but there's a new chapter so a lot of players are active rn.
---
That‚Äôd be cool, bc then you could hide your portals and sneak up on survivors
---
You get more out of a game for less overall effort.  Each game costs 5 efforts, if everyone is burning Gateus on the event you could play 3 games burning and 15 efforts while netting WAY more bloodpoints for the time spent.
---
Yh I think there's just an issue with my dudes ping or something because the hitboxes are actually pretty solid.
---
Crazy thing dude. You don't have to listen to community rules in game. Just play the game, have fun, and don't cheat and you'll be fine.
---
I really wanted the one were Steve had a bandanna so he‚Äôs like bandit steve
---
I don‚Äôt consider everyone idiots cause I use laughing emojisüòÇüòÇ you‚Äôre logic behind that is still... well it makes you sounds ridiculous
---
Not now, but before his rework his ability only really made it worse for him as he had to put a survivor to sleep before he could hit them
---
Yea yo. When it first starts it sounds like a fucking warning siren you hear in zombie movies waaayyy in the distance, but it gets worse. That chase music is üî•üî•
---
Freddy used to be considered weak because survivors had to be in the dream world to be hit and downed. Back then he could pull people into the dream world himself and it wasn't on a timer, after spotting someone and pressing the button to make them fall asleep, it took I think about 7 seconds for them to be able to be hit. Against really good survivors, this could be bad because the chase takes long enough already, and you add 7 seconds to an already long chase and its more than enough time for the others to find ruin/pop a couple gens/open gates or whatever objective is at the moment. Not to mention freddy didnt have dream pallets or his teleport ability.
---
What people are generally missing about old fred is that once in the dream world, survivors auras could be seen if they were out of your Terror Radius, and suffered action penalties to everything (something that can still be done, but fills up add on slots). The good thing (for killers) about old fred was once all the gens are done and if everyone was asleep, the only thing that could wake you up really was failing healing skills checks. Which freddy could easily screw around all game and then use Bloodwarden and NOED to just wipe an entire team in the last second.
---
not my fault him and the boys sabo'd all the hooks. keep spinning, Jeff.
---
I know, I just find it insane how these survivors thought it was how the game was ‚Äúsupposed to be played‚Äù
---
I just saw your name and I hate myself for falling for this bait
---
Nah you don't have to let anybody go.
---
Some people leave the the best survivor for last and let him go, other have favorite survivors, like baby dwights, and let those live.
---
Others don't care who it is, they just let one go because it's a horror/slasher trope. Somebody to tell the tale.
---
You do what is fun for you, as long as you are not being a dick on purpose and play just to grief others.
---
The only rule for both killers and survivors should be: don't be a dick
---
Yea it will be a good addition and since we got those webcaps that also increase the Undetectable effect it will make for a great combination for stealth demogorgon
---
Even Otz does useless things hmm...
---
Preach dude
---
No it‚Äôs not, you‚Äôre guaranteed to go down if the killer is any good. You want safe pallets but not enough that it‚Äôs shit for the killer experience. This map is shit for both
---
Could be really strong with the insta downs... But then again omega blink, five blink, insta down hatchets, prayer beads, so it would prob be okay. I think that having really strong add ons aren't that bad tho, makes them viable against top notch swf.
---
Good point but I wish I didnt so I could have everyone p3
---
Nurse on D. I'm laughing so hard right now.
---
this list is just incorrect :p
---
huntress can be hella good
---
Correct at time of posting.
---
For the pig mask I would just cut the crappy built in hair and try to find a higher quality wig, then stuff the snout with cotton to make it more stiff, re-paint with some mask-safe paint an bam.
---
Said it in my first comment?
---
No, he isn't concidered weak anymore, he recently got a full rework.
---
Things they added: 
---
-Survivors automatically fall asleep
---
-He can place dream snares (or fake pallets) to make the life of sleeping survivors harder
---
-He can teleport to unrepaired generators
---
-Freddy can attack survivors even when they aren't fully asleep
---
-You can wake up via an alarm clock
---
How it used to be:
---
-Freddy had to put you asleep manually and it took about 7 seconds to fall asleep
---
-Freddy could see the aura's of sleeping survivors outside his terror radius
---
-Sleeping survivors had a -50% work speed penalty
---
-Freddy could not attack awake survivors
---
-Awake survivors couldn't see freddy, but could hear his terror radius
---
Basically, freddy only had power when survivors were in the dream world, but it was very easy to escape the dream world. Almost everyone had self care, so you could just wake up mid chase and force freddy to put them to sleep again
---
When looking at his powers in a chase, he was the most base killer you could get. There was nothing to end the chase quickly and the transition from awake to sleeping gave the survivors enough time to get to a loop.
---
However, he was strong when you bounced from survivor to survivor. Making sure as many people are asleep at one time as possible
---
Flashlight time haha. It‚Äôs about to be flashlight time for my killer Wraith
---
He said personal experiences, didn't he?
---
I play on console which explains and I haven't went against a good nurse player yet.
---
All you need is a good set of headphones and prediction, after that you are playing the META.
---
I think the new lobby they made to remove SWF having to re-invite is having issues.
---
I was playing with my friends yesterday and some times when we got a killer, it would disconnect me immediately as if the killer dodged but my friends would remain in his lobby.
---
*happy oink* you should join us Mandy-mains over there sometime, we need more active posters, right now it‚Äôs only a handful of people posting.
---
 You and your teammates come to my lobbies. Please! (Totally not the killer)
---
tugging on the heart strings :'(
---
Not my duty. However, if you feel the need to call someone out for not crediting an image, takenot upon yourself because its really nobody's responsibility unless its profiting
---
given the console comment I retract my statement
---
I think it is killer sided as well. I've played as the hag on it and her traps are so op on that map.
---
Nurse at D means you are rank 20 console player? lol
---
üßÇüßÇüßÇüßÇüßÇüßÇüßÇüßÇüßÇüßÇ
---
Ever since the Spirit DLC with Yamaoka Estate (even though that map can be survivor sided), the devs haven't gotten close to achieving a good combination of art design and functionality in their maps.
---
The Temple of Purgation is just a reskin of the Red Forest with a giant temple in the middle. Ormond is a mess with auras and scratch marks. Hawkins Lab looks awesome but it is a nightmare for survivors with the abundance of unsafe pallets and the lack of vaults, OR it's a nightmare for killers when you face survivors with Balanced Landing.
---
Yamaoka Estate (though I hate it), the Game, even the new Badham maps: with some tweaks, these are the types of maps that the devs should be creating. They've lost the plot on this one.
---
So are keys though.
---
Do you play on PC? Cuz I just started playing a week ago on PS4 and have gotten nothing but nice helpful messages after my crappy killer performances. Seems like the PC crowd are the more toxic of the two.
---
Sure she can be good but like the titles based on personal experiences on said killers. I have very easy games going against Huntress has little to no map pressure and hatchet throws are weird on console.
---
You seem to have some sort of personality disorder. Consider seeing a therapist.
---
100% agreed
---
Oh, that explains a lot
---
Huntress takes the most playtime to learn imo, that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt see as many. I run BBQ/Ruin/Enduring/Nurses. Ruin and Enduring are replaceable but that‚Äôs what I like to run.
---
Bond can destroy it
---
I would go with empathy, borrowed time, self care, and balanced landing. Though I would recommend you be very conservative with how you use self care. Taking protection hits with empathy and then going for self care could easily end up being an overwhelming amount of time spent healing. If you play with your friends tho I would definitely take self care off and replace it with prove thyself.
---
It's desync. Not actual hitboxes. This has been said a million times.

Poor Greg :( , but in all honesty that was amazing lol. (Greg is the pet name my group of friends gave the killer)

Very nice!

Yeah if I played pc she would definitely be SS Tier
---
everyone give this man updoots
---
You are aware Daddy, and by extension Big Daddy isn‚Äôt exclusively sexual, right? Daddy is a term of endearment used by small children, especially little girls and even grown women sometimes. While Big Daddy is used as a nickname in various kinks, in this context it isn‚Äôt sexual. Have you ever played for heard of Bioshock? Also, why do you act like homosexuality is objectively bad?
---
Solid suggestions and some fairly advanced ones like taking a hit for a teammate that wouldn't be able to reach another pallet. Well done.
---
Lmk any feedback on the perks
---
You dont want it trust... I really love the map when it comes to aesthetic, sound , feel, but its just worse than the game to me when it comes to loops.
---
More like OP tier.
---
&lt;3 Cheers!

OH GOD WHY

&gt;with any kind of progression

Pip's aren't progression. Were you able yo earn bp and shards?

With third seal I once was trying to find out where my premate was hooked. He said next to a stone and a generator.. Grand! XD

Not. Yet.

Am also on console PS4, GT: NateNate555

&gt; Did these people turn in to psychopaths or something? Are they broken inside? Or is that the fun of playing killer?
---
Yikes.
---
Go play killer for abit and come back and tell me how survs are all sportsmanship.
---
Coz they aren't. They're toxic little shits too.
---
You: literally making a sarcastic joke.  
---
OP and Reddit: REEEEEE
---
Blood Warden is extremely easily countered by just 99%ing the gates and there's currently nothing the killer can do about that besides just hoping that he or she gets to the hook before the survivors open the gates (unlikely, since gates are so quick to open right now).
---
True I low-key want to go against a very good Nurse so I can practice if I ever come across God like Nurse players.
---
If you're messaging the killer asking why they camped, you're toxic. The killer doesn't need a reason to camp.
---
Acting like the killer has to justify his actions to you is toxic.
---
gotta love reddit where all these nerds are somehow internet psychologists. fuck off pedo
---
The worst thing is... it sounds like the most boring porn ever. Like someone sitting in some shitty studio, dubbing the most boring porn they've ever watched. He sounds more annoyed than anything. As if he's about to add "what the fuck am I doing with my life" after every hook scream.
---
The quality hurts me so much
---
I'm really hoping the devs will change Nurse so that she's viable on consoles. It's funny how an SSS tier killer is dog shit on consoles.
---
Are you sure the devs wouldnt think about it though?

probably has something to do with bhvr caring infinitely more about pc customers than they do about console customers, but don't quote me.
---
Something about that doesn't seem right to me. There's gotta be something wrong. I've got like 500 hours into the game and have only seen a killer leave the lobby like twice ever, even when I play 4 man swf. I'll still take a lobby dc over a match dc any day tho. Especially with how short survivor lobby wait times are where I live.

It counts as being put into the injured state I think

Survivors can scare Little Sister (or potentially even be presented with the Save / Harvest choice from the games, each having different effects) to stop her from collecting and limit his power regen but this would in turn alert and piss off Big Daddy.
---
I think we got a pretty good killer design here, when's the job offer come in the mail? Lol
---
no booli wraith &lt;3
---
I've played DBD for a few hours every day since the new chapter and I still haven't been to the new map.
---
Yeah, it varies but most red rank survivors are at least somewhat decent for me.
---
I figured in that case it would fail to confuse the one who is at the fake hook, but 2 other survivors elsewhere might be confused.   
---
I think the perk becomes really strong when paired with knock out, and I'm even thinking that adding 3 tokens of the knock out effect to the perk might be necessary, but I didn't think of the issue at the time when I made it.
---
Nah it's fine, just run it. You would've been "invisible".
---
I play on xbox so usually they just dont reply
---
I don't 360, I shake left then right
---
geeeeezzzz - i really should've saved it... i lucked out and got in early with the ohmwrecker shirts - but rarely play killer :/
---
Send them to hell along with the killers who bring instadowns and moris.
---
Meanwhile, I'm over here as a yellow rank killer (took a hiatus as killer for a few months) getting red, purple, and green ranked folks as survivors.
---
He did.
---
I got bullied as Legion for so long I finally had enough and picked up Spirit for a month on Xbox. I log in one day and BAM I can‚Äôt message people or join parties due to a high amount of reports against me. I looked at my message requests and wow I see tons of hate mail and complaining but didn‚Äôt even realize they were there because I had notifications off lol The price you pay for playing high tier killers against toxic survivors I guess üò§
---
I wish wraith was actually good. :(
---
wait. can you farm bloodpoints with tutorial?
---
I played her for the first time last night for a daily (the only time I play killer), and she is so slow that she doesn't have the basic moveset of most killers in terms of chases.  If you play Trapper, even if you ignore his traps he's still an ok killer you can put some pressure on.  With Nurse, I feel like her ability is obligatory, and it's hard to pull off correctly.  I don't like playing killer anyway, but when I go with someone like Billy I have a lot more fun and it seems like he's considered strong also.  
---
Really Bing Bong is my fav tho.
---
Sure, also while Spirit can initially hook faster (and also there‚Äôs variables like on some maps hillbilly is useless because there‚Äôs too many walls and debris for him to efficiently navigate around the map) I think Billy catches up once he gets rid of pallets around generator areas as it allows him to 1 hit survivors but again this depends pretty heavily on the map.
---
Generally my position would be open field/forest maps with little walls or debris = Hillbilly better. While indoor maps with tons of walls and debris = spirit better
---
But there already is an explanation for why the lullaby is only when you're sleeping: it's because you're asleep. That's literally it.
---
K.
---
The reason you're still leveling perks slowly is because you play Bubbas Basement lol!  That's the least efficient way of getting bloodpoints ever.  Play games normally you'll get at least twice the bloodpoints.
---
whenever a survivor unhooks someone in front of me, i try to follow the unhooker but if i only see the unhookee then ill down him and let him crawl around cause i feel bad he got screwed.
---
Makes sense, probably hard to type there
---
But you hear The Huntresses Luluby when you are wake.

Lol hook the no mother player instantly lol don‚Äôt let them play that shit. And a syringe stacked with a a purple bottle is a waste lol this isn‚Äôt that op. Once it‚Äôs used it can‚Äôt be used again.
---
me when I play killerüòÇ I like survivor more but then when I want to play killer I get bullied.
---
Some killers just are, I guess.
---
3 whole games, lol, what a great way to measure the killers power
---
That would make it viable! Its still a great idea im just not picking cause i would love to see this in the game
---
And she got nerfed this patch too lol
---
Competitive minded people use 1 killer and 4 perks. 1 dlc and under 10k shards! Sounds nice!

Alternately: just play Billy's chainsaw sound at random distances, quickly getting closer, or starting off damn close.
---
People will love getting a skillcheck on a generator while hearing that suddenly.
---
lol. Good for you for being cool about it
---
I was doctor. I could see the other guy. Should I just say "Got to hook and not secure the 4K" Also I am trying to rank. Any DC is terrible.
---
I've been pretty lucky on it. I'm definitely the type to love a complicated map though, so maybe I'm just biased. I think it's really tricky to juke around it as a survivor, but when you can, it's rewarding! Gorgeous design for jt, too.
---
Her idle animation is so fucking creepy, I hope they fix it.
---
That's kind of the thing, most of the killers I play against are toxic, is that just me being unlucky?
---
&gt;Behaviour practically encourages toxic behavior at this point.
---
You will literally get PERMANENTLY banned for holding the match hostage or body blocking another survivor into an inescapable area.
---
I get what you're trying to say, they make toxic perks, but you are absolutely wrong.
---
But if you hook a survivor then other survivors can unhook them with BT, and that gives them ANOTHER free hit, and makes it super hard to tunnel off hook. Why would I want that?
---
That just sounds like a new power instead of an ultra rare. While I like the concept, a more practical one would be to have the addon give them exhaustion for 90 or 120 seconds when hit. Clearly not worthy of ultra rare status but at least my concept doesn't feel like a whole new killer power
---
...was that me? lol HI
---
I totally agree. This is nothing but logic lol
---
Because killers learn early that alot of survivors are entitled. They dont expect just a gg, they expect you to spew shit at them about how bad they were, so the natural defense to that is to do it first

Try just not messaging at all.  PC sounds awful with the built in chat feature.  I'm happy I play this game free on Xbox Game Pass.  When someone takes the time to type out an insult in the Xbox messenger, it's just pathetic and funny.  More often, people message nice things like "wanted to give you hatch, couldn't find it" or "sorry, doing a daily, normally wouldn't camp," things like that.  The game honestly sounds a lot more enjoyable on console than PC.  Can you disable chat on PC (not hide it, but totally turn it off)?  Might be good for the soul.
---
The game is asymmetrical, a single survivor shouldn't have great chances in a 1v1.
---
Survivors failed to complete 5 gens to power gates.
---
The last Survivor then has a last ditch effort to escape easily via the hatch, if the Killer finds it first then that Survivor failed again.
---
the last Survivor THEN has a all or nothing final gamble with the gates, if the gates are far enough and the Killer checks the wrong one first then the Survivor has a chance of escaping, if not then they'll most likely die from either being Hooked/Mori'd or EGC.
---
If you made the other guy wait around on the floor for like 10 fucking years before he could requeue just because you wanted an extra 700 Bloodpoints and to feel good about 4king, Yes.
---
Dcs are terrible but why do you think you should be rewarded for it?
---
Camping gives a stupid amount of points, and doesn't take any away. Everytime another survivor goes in / out of chase you get points. It would be impossible to get this few points if you camped 
---
This is a perfect example of a pissy survivor making something up to be pissy about.

No such thing as a toxic build. The game was good because it was good.
---
Hence the "I".
---
It‚Äôs a joke, I only basement when I am near one and everyone‚Äôs altruistic.
---
I get 60k points a game minimum vs any other killer who I don‚Äôt have ruin and BBQ tier 3 on. I know Doc is better maybe even Hillbilly but I don‚Äôt enjoy Hillbilly, and don‚Äôt need Doc for his perks as badly as others so levelling him just for BP farming would be a bad choice if I didn‚Äôt get BBQ tier 3 within the first 40 levels as that‚Äôs needless levelling with few teachables available.
---
So you can see why Bubba is my blood point pig.
---
Ok so basically Legion was very bad, 4 Feral Frenzy stabs without counter okay but it took more time to down a survivor then M1 hitting them, and now he's just complete shit, instead of reworking his power or adjusting it, they just made everything 100% worse
---
Well I still sat and camped the first hook while invisible so that was toxic at least

Good job, now I do too

This is so true. I love this. Even I do this when I play Survivor.

This is a great response, I just don't know what to do against it i guess...
---
He's not going to wait before requeue because I am doctor. He screams on the ground. It's not just "700 bloodpoints" it's rank. When you hook survivors you get extra rank. And I only got A SAFETY PIP. I would have got 1 pip if he didn't leave.
---
I'm on Xbox. Lol.
---
I just want to understand why, if I'm playing completely fair and non toxic, why they feel the need to butt dance and light click. It's the reason people play toxic killer. They get tired if toxic survivors.
---
I do that or spin. If I see a survivor spinning on the ground though I'll spin too
---
Flip the list but move A Tier back up.
---
The orange color from the Endgame Phase doesn‚Äôt help much either. I‚Äôd much prefer Dark Red/White scratchmarks.
---
You‚Äôre really stretching here
---
The way the camera moves hides the swing and just makes it look like her legs exploded on impact
---
I never asked that. The point I was trying to make was that this issue is so bad, high rank survivors like me are getting the most boring games in the planet. And it's making the game really hard to enjoy.
---
Not necessarily agreeing with that guy. Yes your idea is certainly creative but in my opinion it just seems way too complicated for an addon. It essentially gives him a secondary killer power; an entirely new mechanic to his kit.
---
Again just my opinion but the best way to design Ultra Rare killer addons is to ask "what if we took the killer's power one step further?" 1 shot hatchets. Infinite T3 EW. Traps that set themselves. The Wailing Bell makes no sound. For billy, something like immunity to stuns while chainsaw dashing makes sense. It takes his power one step further making every pallet extremely unsafe.
---
I would put in thanataphobia but I don‚Äôt have it for demogorgon
---
"How dare you play o.ptimally in this competitive game. You should be ashamed"
---
Problem:  to give Solo survivors the same approximate level of information as a SWF, you‚Äôd have to completely remove or rework all information sharing perks, which is damn near half of them, and I‚Äôm not sure if there are enough mechanics in the game to make 18-25 new perks and never make more information sharing ones.
---
The sad part is... Even if he didn't pick her up she could've just crawled out before the DS time runs out... :/
---
Everything is toxic. Nothing is toxic. Everyone has their own made up garbage rules for what is and isnt toxic. Just do what you want, and ignore what others say, as long as you‚Äôre not literally breaking the rules of the game, you‚Äôre fine
---
Yeah I've noticed there is a huge amount of low ranked killers now, and they get paired with my team who are all red ranks :| half the time we feel bad and give them a couple of kills at the end hahaha
---
Honestly, if you‚Äôre BM‚Äôing at any point in this game, you‚Äôre probably just a fucking loser/nobody in real life.
---
I‚Äôm talking about the *hardcore* BM‚Äôers. The kind who purposefully don‚Äôt do Gens and spend the entire time teabagging/flashlight clicking/looping the whole game, and wait for the endgame chat to spew some awful, toxic shit like *‚ÄùLMAO kill yourself fucking trash Killer. Ez Loops uninstall idiot‚Äù* 
---
As a Killer, I can handle a few teabags, or a bit of cockiness. I can‚Äôt handle a SWF Squad using Decisive, Sabotage, Mettle Of Man, Dead Hard and ignoring the objective only to bully me for 15 minutes and die.
---
Don't you love it when Reddit downvote you for a joke or question? I sure do

Sigh you made this before I could.

---
Why would she fast vault into the damn locker. Lesson learned.
---
It really depends on your point of view. I don't think there is such thing as being toxic. Two sides with literally opposite goals, of course it's gonna create some anger and frustration, but you can't blame either side for doing everything they can to win.
---
Lol. So that wasn't toxic in anyway?
---
Well guess that's what makes the killers toxic for me I guess, I love looping
---
Welcome to Lobby Simulator 2019, enjoy your stay ü§†
---
Being toxic is using hateful, racial, or homophobic slurs in post game chat. Or cheating and I guess using exploits to gain an advantage in game. 
---
For this sub and others, the word is thrown around to mean anything I don't like you doing. However, in this game everything outside of what I said is either intended by the developer or due to really bad players playing badly and that includes camping.
---
Thanks man, the story of my huntress, turning into nurse.

I didn‚Äôt realize u can‚Äôt see the portals until he activated them so I was doing a gen and legit just popped out of the ground right next to me. 10/10 would scare again

Honest question, what color would be better? I assume a color better for the colorblind would be more visible for the not color blind players, higher contrast? If that were the case it could kind of be game breaking.

---
The guy on the floor literally has to sit there and wait for you to find the other guy before he can requeue.
---
&gt;It's not just "700 bloodpoints" it's rank. When you hook survivors you get extra rank. And I only got A SAFETY PIP. I would have got 1 pip if he didn't leave.
---
The thing is, The guy you left on the floor doesn't give a shit about your rank. You are wasting his time, so hes going to dc, especially if he has limited hours and just wants to play the game.

Nah, I was just having a crouch staring contest with the pig.

Sorry if I didn‚Äôt understand you correctly, even though English is my first and only language, I‚Äôm not very good at it XD
---
So basically they're jackassess?
---
I rather dislike being pitted against any killer that has invisibility such as the wraith or spirit or even ghost face as he minimizes his terror radius.
---
Advice for hag? Sure
---
The trick for her traps is to crouch. Crouching does not trigger her traps, so even if she trapped a hook, you can crouch over, unhook and then crouch away. Unless the hooked teammate tries to run off.... then you should run as well
---
Hillbilly, very little skill involved, no punishment for missing a saw, it recharges instantly, 
---
Survivor, blendette, especially on certain maps.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but what is BM?
---
Do people not realise they got postponed?
---
You seem intrigued by Dbd mysteries sooo
---
But on the other side, a survivor dcing encourages the killer to dc or play more toxic, as they are now missing an entire sacrifice.
---
By giving the killer full points for that survivor (by which I mean points for hooking that survivor 3 times, not a full emblem) it will encourage them to continue the game.
---
I also said survivors should get 1/4 of their altruism points because they csnt get them off of that survivor anymore. I feel like it's only fair to give survivors that much.
---
Its not the act of looping, its the amount of time that it wastes. I can admit i‚Äôve gotten seriously pissed as i watched an entire game go past in two survivor chases because autohaven offerings=pallet town
---
It would be even better if the fake aura imitated the actions of the real survivor too
---
Nah it‚Äôs the one where eleven was kept, you can see the wall perpendicular to it was smashed by a guys head and there‚Äôs another guy laying besides him
---
&gt; Camping cannot be toxic.
---
So face camping right off the start to secure a kill isn't toxic? even though I didn't get any chase? even though the survivor got 2k points because of the chase and their struggle points? well I'll be damned.
---
Yeah, you have different opinion and they call you names then you call them names back then everyone hates each other. DBD in a nutshell.
---
Nurse and wraith got their powers from the entity kind of like a welcome gift
---
He looks like A survivor, but not any specific survivor. My point was that Herobrine looks like Steve and it would be difficult to immediately tell the difference.
---
But with Legion you can hear their heartbeat, see their red light, or notice their knife and mask.
---
wait what..
---
Yes, but the problem with that is that you'd be taking detective's hunch
---
Am i a masochist for wanting to go against one? Lol
---
&gt; But on the other side, a survivor dcing encourages the killer to dc or play more toxic, as they are now missing an entire sacrifice.
---
The killer can still reach very high BP without that 4th person.
---
They have more room to not play toxic and farm, It's the survs who get fucked over by their DC.
---
Killers literally have no reason to disconnect from a 3v1. Not only would they lose 2 pips and get no bloodpoints but their game just became ridiculously easy to farm.
---
Survs on the other hand - Are fucked. 5 gens with 3 people is not easy.
---
It 100% is not. Dominating an opponent is never toxic. Imagine if your Survivor friends don't even get a gen done then. That happens multiple times every day.
---
Agreed, but I said nothing about slugging
---
Maybe but I saw it on my demogorgon who hasn't been prestiged yet
---
I like that your second try is Devotion 1 Rank 90, lol. The title makes it seem like you played for a few hours and quit but decided to give it a second chance.
---
I wanna go against one too man. Best i‚Äôve seen is a nurse that didnt use their power at all lmao
---
So even if I play like an asshole and not let people have fun by camping, I'm not being toxic?
---
If you're running Dying Light - or if the killer is - that is what is causing all the crashes I have run into. Usually on the fifth or sixth hook.
---
Bruh that should be doctor's base kit for madness level 3, Imagine random doctors running up from everywhere to hit you, that DEFINITIVELY hits the mark with doctor. Can't believe they even thought about putting stationary useless as shit illusions that don't even spawn correctly...
---
Hmm I guess I kinda expected that but it makes more sense to have a power that is related to their lore, like most killers do.
---
What was the build? I'd like to try it out it seems fun
---
Remove ebony moris, keys, adrenaline, and noed. Game would be 10x better imo
---
It's never the killers job to make sure survivors have fun üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Do you think items, add-ons, and offerings are meant to be fun?

A fucking ebony Mori isn't toxic at all, and it definitely isn't fun.

Okay, first off, don't come on my post and insult me. You sound like a fucking dick.

Second off, I have a GENUINE neurological disorder that makes it so I cannot work. I can't even get out of bed some days.

I was under the assumption that Second Wind was bad with Decisive, but I didn't realize Second Wind still works if you're grabbed out of a locker as opposed to hit down.
---
I might have to try this at some point :)
---
That looks sick
---
Yeah fair call, wasnt judging.
---
‚ÄúHaha, yeah buddy, welcome to hell.‚Äù
---
Its not about bp. Its incredibly hard to pip as a killer without 4 sacrifices. Believe it or not, some people do care about then.
---
People will rage quit because they are toxic. It's the same reason survivors do it. It's the same reason it happens in every game. All some people need is a mild inconvenience.
---
After the recent changes, its much easier to pip with a survivor than with a killer. I dont think giving the killer a small boost so that it's actually possible to pip on three survivors is a big deal.
---
Well I mean, I was literally hooking my final survivor and it crashed. 
---
Didnt even get my blood points even tho game technically ended...
---
;-;
---
It's been awful for PC matchmaking too. Exact same things you've described with wild rank mismatching.
---
Yeah its... how its allowed on reddit is beyond me
---
Even if there's no money involved? Like if someone were to post it on their Facebook or sumthin would that count too?
---
happened to me twice today. :)
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
Just pair it with moonshine and you can turn around everything.
---
there is literally no reason to camp unless you don't have an objective. If there are no gens left, then camp your heart out, but if you are camping every hook and playing like an asshole, you are being an asshole. in other words, camping without a valid reason is toxic.
---
What is a maurie?
---
I meant imagine wanting BBQ and Chilli, not Leatherface and just being able to pay 3 dollars or something and to have to at tier 3. Without putting in any work of getting bloodpoints and finding it in bloodwebs.
---
Yes it is indeed a meme and I don't even care about noed lol
---
I completely agree with a slight buff. She‚Äôs a good killer but still in a grey area for me tier wise.
---
I agree. Legion is not very fun since the power is somewhat ineffective without perks to back it up.
---
Franklins (they had keys, a map, and a toolbox), BBQ, Ruin, NOED
---
Then I used the addons that: one makes it so bell is silent and one makes it so you have no red stain (and terror radius i think?) for 6 seconds after uncloaking. Surprised the guy going to unhook the first person by grabbing him before he could unhook. Super toxic
---
Yeah sucks, sorry to hear that. it‚Äôs bad all around.
---
Their ability is bad imo. I don't like using it and always end up just using M1. I got my adept using only M1. +their lore is fucking annoying and that adds up.
---
Tbh I wasnt all that aware of what Dwight's pose was in the actual game when it happens so I just, kinda did what I could.
---
I see, what you mean, sorry!
---
survival is the hardest category to get points in. You get 5k from escape, 1.5k from kobe, upto 890 from struggling on the hook, then some small 100-500 points from healing yourself, waking up ect
---
damn.
---
also you right about being a baby gorgon
---
Yup, exactly my point. There's ways to obtain perks for free.
---
played against balanced with billy, was not fun
---
Yes! I love this kind of discussion. I feel as if they've drastically improved their design/lore for more recent killers, but their first few killers are shallow cliches. 
---
* Hillbilly is so cliche, he's just a knockoff Leatherface: We have two chainsaw wielding hillbillies. 
---
* The Wraith has this magical invisibility bell that is absolutely core to his identity, but there is no context given to it in his lore at all, or this "spirit world" he apparently interacts with. 
---
* Nurse is also lacking. Is she a ghost that can go through walls? Or something? Why is she screaming? Is she a banshee or a nurse? What are they going for here? Probably nothing.
---
I really think their thought process for their first few killers was "making it scary", not once was a "why" ever asked when they were designing anything. Why does she float? Why does the Trapper have bolts in his back? Why is the Wraith covered in bandages and all black? Why is the Hillbilly glowing? None of it makes any sense. I hope they flesh out their lore more in the future, or in some cases totally rewrite it. Judging by what they've done for Killlers like Huntress, or Spirit, they're definitely capable of crafting interesting backstories now. Back then, it must have not been a priority. 
---
And if the Entity gave them their power... why? What's the point? If it's Entity throwing people around for its own amusement, you'd think it would want to see what its subjects can do, not show them what **it** can do: It can't surprise or entertain itself, otherwise it wouldn't need to bring the Wraith/Nurse into its realm in the first place? It doesn't hold up. Which means it isn't compelling. And if your lore isn't compelling, it's pointless.
---
Ah crap, Mori*
---
No problem! :)
---
Movement speed is too op. 
---
Hidden 1 shot is op. 
---
But also just do totems people.
---
Ah Ding ding ding good job
---
Man imagine the ear rape you'd get from 20 hillbillys chainsawing from every direction
---
I get that tbf but I think the ability is stronger than most people give credit. Still he's a boring looking killer and boring lore.
---
Teal or Lavender, the point is there supposed to be visible to the killer to help them track survivors. Fact of the matter is people will always take any advantage they can but that's not an excuse to make game mechanics practically invisible to a minority of players based on something they can't control.
---
I agree the doctor's power makes complete sense with his lore but I don't see how taking people's breaths has anything to do with teleporting.
---
"Intense" escape against a rank 20 Demogorgon that has no idea how to play the game
---
Aww true yeah i get ya
---
But, also, microtransactions only speed up the game though. You can usually still get the (competitive) items microtransactions give you, you just have to grind for them.
---
Trust me OP, you aren‚Äôt missing out. Imagine all the vaults and LoS of Lery‚Äôs but more pallets and Balanced Landing works. Like once survivors get a hang of totem and gen spawns, I swear this is gonna be the worst map.
---
I do totems anyway cause who doesn't want 1k and now with inner strength and small game on my Nancy noed is off the table Bois
---
See being a wraith main when I started playing I didn't even lunge attack but now I'm getting 360ed by people
---
Tony Todd doing anything is just great.
---
Oh absolutely. Just the same 3 posts every day
---
Yes I'm a candle now
---
This is DBD. Always expect negativity, even when you think you we're just playing "fair and nice". Seems Survivors and Killers have different perceptions on certain behaviors and actions. 
---
Either way, people need to chill the fuck out and just accept that they're playing an imbalanced game with a tiered perk system that has had serious issues since launch. It's not the players, it's the game. Mostly.
---
Well done candle.
---
What have you been running on him ?
---
If you're going to make a perk allowing me to make a game a 3 v 1, you've just made a perk better than ruin. I'd happily accept that. You've already let down your team abd my my role easier if i'm playing killer. Not really a win.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that be good? Maybe not for 3$. But getting it without Bubba if u don‚Äôt want them is better?
---
Right like what's the point? Im on ps4 and these joysticks ain't cheap, im not gonna break them just to get downed again
---
Detective hunch with this perk is super good and you can get all the totems preventing no ed
---
The end game is the same closed hatch or unopened hatch once the gates are powered
---
Doesnt urban say 100% of walking speed?
---
The Eldritch Monster
---
I sometimes use it
---
That‚Äôs the same game condition though, either way the demogorgon wins by putting a portal at both gates
---
I guess not.
---
Let him be the actor too, yes papa.
---
Great points, I forgot about the physical appearance of the killers and you are right, the early killers don't really make sense in that regard either. For The Wraith, I think they used the bell since it makes an ominous sound and for balance purposes an auditory warning is required when he exists out of stealth, but of course that can literally be any sound.
---
5 map offerings, completed the gen 3 times, escaped once and it's the wrong gen üòÇ fml
---
If you get all the gens done then you‚Äôve won and should have the better chance of escaping but if your the last person left looking for the hatch you‚Äôve lost and that‚Äôs that
---
Yupppers.
---
I had to go up agaisnt an iri huntress playing with a bunch of my new friends, dick move.
---
I mean I 4k'ed 5 games with wraith today so he clearly needs a nerf
---
Sydney is so funny
---
i was leveling up my feng
---
Not if there multiple people as if there‚Äôs only one then welp that sucks just try and open the door or find the hatch
---
Hey! I on both sides! But fuck legion, from both sides.
---
Nice.
---
 But in this case the demogorgon doesn‚Äôt get punished for checking the wrong gate. They still win because they can use the portals twice in the time it takes to open a gate
---
That's pretty shit of him, but I have yet to see proof he actually fucked a child or molested a child to say he is a pedo (or received CP or shit like that)
---
You can have some of them on the shrine, but you can check that the more usefull perks like bbq or ruin barely appears on it, or make your choice for example, it hasn't been on the shrine yet this year. So most of people have to pay in order to get those perks. I have almost all dlc's and I dont care paying for them as I really put hours on the game, but I think this way.
---
But, they literally strawmanned. That's not meant as an insult, nor was it even directed at you so why are you even arguing over this? Let me be clear since tone is confusing over text: It wasn't insulting, I was just pointing out he wasn't actually addressing my points. He was addressing his made up strawman points. In a discussion it's totally fine to point out logical fallacies or strawman arguments, so things don't get off track. Speaking of...
---
Everyone‚Äôs got different definitions on here but if tunneling is to target the weaker person then I really don‚Äôt care cause it‚Äôs a smart play
---
If you think end game toxicity, spamming the N word, saying EZ baby killer, f bombs, and the like aren't "real" toxicity, then I guess you're part of the problem. These people are not just pathetic people, but are actually unhealthy for the game's success. People don't want to play a game when those people are running rampant without getting punished even slightly. I really can;t remember the last hour of gameplay that didn't have at least one absurdly toxic player.
---
To clarify, I said nothing about perks or play styles or just plain getting wrecked by the opposing players.
---
Wouldn't just adding VOIP to the game just fix most of these issues?
---
So Billy gets better hallucinations than Doctor does? 
---
*Darn*
---
My heart needed this.
---
Okay guess he was just salted then
---
That's extremely toxic, literally the word ''baby'' should be considered a crime for anyone doing rituals.
---
Indeed, my dude.
---
Good time was had by all
---
What I've noticed is the line between toxicity and skill with survivors is blurred in the eyes of killers, especially at low ranks. e.g if I run a killer around a loop for 3 gens without tbagging or doing anything toxic it will still frustrate the killer and they're more likely to nod in game or message me after saying EZ. Whereas if I down a survivor without being toxic there's nothing really to be frustrated about because its clear why they went down. On PS4 the thing I come across the most is camping and tunneling at all ranks because it still ranks you up if the team isn't swf because you are likely to get a 3/4k.
---
Been extremely powerful even since release. No one knew how to play her, which is why people complained. Then she got a bunch of unnecessary buffs to make her more ridiculous.
---
Epic
---
goddamnit.
---
When I do this with killers its always perfectly centred
---
Isn't that nerf just an addon rework? Besides unless they completely butcher her I don't see a nerf taking her off the top.
---
I'm not colourblind at all and Endgame collapse confuses me so must be awful for you
---
Having limited time to play isn‚Äôt an excuse to rob the killer of the points he earned because he‚Äôs trying to play optimally. DCers=Scum, that‚Äôs inarguable
---
while Nurse's ability isnt fully explained, her power is literally told to us.
---
Spencer is the name of the warden of the asylum, and all her powers are based on breath. something like 'that close to death, and she can be in the spirit realm' and she screams because her breath is also being held to use the power, so it hurts HER at the same time
---
Is he strapped to Kelly?
---
No spoilers plz. I only started season 2 after finishing s1 on netflix.
---
Aww, lookit the lil fella. He just wants a hug! Nice work, OP - you've more skill than you give yourself credit for!
---
I‚Äôm gonna be screaming
---
that gave me a good chuckle.
---
ace central, disconnect.
---
Well hopefully he‚Äôs in mk11
---
My game would crash when ever I hook a survivor, this happened to me around 10 times now and it's very annoying, my network connection would disconnect randomly while still having internet connection as well
---
that was amazing.
---
big brains.
---
Dude, thanks
---
I'm guess I'm pretty nitpicky about how some parts turned out, but I'm glad you liked him anyways!
---
\^
---
Oh yeah. Forgot about that \^\^;
---
Thanks guy üëå
---
What a nightmare that would be
---
That would be kinda op.
---
Nope.
---
Have you played siege recently? I feel the changes have really clamped down on toxicity whereas dbd punishes nothing but disconnecting.
---
Speeeen
---
Sure, but the devs already said they can‚Äôt and/or won‚Äôt do that in both old and very recent interviews, so until they change their stance on that I think balance is impossible.
---
Literally had a situation where the only gens done (I think one or 2 maybe) were ones I did and it was me and one other person left, it was annoying as Hell because the killer slugged the other survivor and it ended with me getting my first hook and dying on it.
---
You should do this for the other killers, I love this kind of discussion
---
**Killer - Nurse &amp; Trapper**
---
Nurse matches are won and lost based on how good the Nurses. Having 0 input isn't fun. Either the Nurse is stomped or she stomps, but both ways I might as well have not played.
---
Trapper's traps make me paranoid. I even search for traps while getting chased by other Killers because I fear that snap sound so much.
---
**Survivor - Anyone Who Kills Their Team For Me**
---
I'm personally partial to letting Neas and Dwights live, but otherwise I could care less what skin they have and unless they actively try to hurt their teammates, or they let everyone else die, I don't really mind playing against any type of Survivor. 
---
Yes, even the clickity-click people. Beating them is fun and losing is always a good way to reflect on any mistakes I made.
---
Uhh, I‚Äôm not really sure...
---
I remember imagining what a Stranger Things chapter would look like back in 2017 when Freddy was released, and this jacket is what I imagined her wearing. I‚Äôd be slightly disappointed if she never gets it.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt be able to loop anymore since you couldn‚Äôt see the killer. They‚Äôd have to find a new way to outrun the killers
---
It wouldn't be *kinda* op, it would be fkn broken lol
---
Because she has shit to do with being asleep. We're talking about Freddy's lullaby, not the Huntress merely humming, which anybody can do.
---
Doctor should be made free to help with bp gain. Hag we dont really need yet, maybe when we hit 20 killers they will add them for free
---
Can you link a recent interview? They most assuredly can, the technology has been around forever. I'd like to hear their stance on why they refuse to add such an important feature that would put all survivors on equal footing.
---
This dude knows what‚Äôs up. ^
---
I didn't claim to speak for weaker players. I was one once, so I can relate. We've all been there and it sucks. 
---
Instead of whining about it, I decided to get better and make it much harder for the killer to tunnel me. I'm certainly not batting a thousand, but I'm confident in my chances. 
---
I don't see penalizing someone for doing their objective as a viable solution either. This isn't camping, there is a counter. For once, I would like to play a game where the developers don't cater to the lowest common denominator and encourage players to get better at their game.
---
If there are 2 survivors, one is in the dying state and the other finishes the last gen, the demogorgon still gets both kills because they can endlessly teleport between the gates. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, the hatch is a non-factor, the portals are a free way to never have the gates open unless you‚Äôre terrible at the game
---
There‚Äôs no objective way to classify a good killer, it‚Äôs subjective for a lot of killer
---
I've found a lot of trouble getting Second Wind to proc. You have to physically heal a whole health state, using a medkit makes it not work. Is this intentional?
---
GiT gOoD
---
No both Freddy &amp; Huntress both have a Luluby. Think of it as a variation on Terror Radiuses.
---
My point is that Huntress's Luluby can be heard all the time but Freddy's you can only hear in the Dream World. There should be a technical explanation for that just like they did for Terror Radiuses.
---
But that‚Äôs the point, most killers (other than billy) can‚Äôt guard both gates at once that easily, but the demogorgon can camp both gates simultaneously using the portals
---
I wish i got 120 fps in this game
---
I would fucking love either of those, but the big sister would look amazing as hell
---
Nurse is fine how she is.
---
That's the issue that I'm trying to avoid. Right now the only option is to apply an NVidia filter over the game which changes the color of EVERYTHING, and it makes the game look horrendous. I just want to be able to see the auras without making the sky pink man.
---
Really all that needs changing is nurses addons. Base nurse is pretty balanced
---
Yo that soap is fantastic, have the same kind.
---
Yes, embrace it peasant
---
What's up with the perks in the corner, how do you get that
---
Trapper op
---
TL;DRKiers face an up hill battle in a broken system surround by a lack of empathy.  They adapt to this by becoming part of the problem. 
---
There is a path of the toxicity that isn‚Äôt hard to trace. 
---
Starting killers have no way to truly learn the game before encountering players that can often be much higher level or toxic. 
---
Killers are placed against 4 survivors every game which means they are more likely to come up again toxic survivor players. It only takes one to ruin game. This combined with a match making system that‚Äôs trying to shorten wait times by allowing dis balanced matches leads to a huge frustration for killers. 
---
If a killer responds to toxic behavior by chasing the worst offenders he loses the game by getting looped, plus gets labeled a tunneler.  Then is told to get better. 
---
If a killer responds to aggressive survivors by staying near a hook to chase other players they get labeled a camper. 
---
If they respond by playing more powerful characters or with better add on then they are OP and need to be nerfed. 
---
This leads to killers being abused, bullied, and told to suck it up and play better regardless of whether they are playing for fun or competition. It also leads to self fulfilling prophecy moments where killers give in saying ‚Äú that wasn‚Äôt camping/tunneling/etc. Here‚Äôs what that looks like.‚Äù
---
So in order to continue playing the game as a killer you are forced to conform to the hyper competitive and often toxic nature of top tier players. 
---
Alternatively in an effort to destress they might make a meme build or spend a game or two playing like a total ass because they‚Äôve been mistreated for the last however many games when all they wanted was to achievement hunt, do a daily, have some fun, be spooky, or just play against survivors that are on their level and after the same experience they are.  Then they do that more and more and it becomes their standard play because it‚Äôs less stressful than trying to play well or for fun and suffering for it. 
---
Additionally, some players are just assholes. That‚Äôs life and there‚Äôs little we can do but be better than them in our actions. 
---
One of the biggest annoyances that litters this subreddit is that players on both side feel like there is nothing they can do about other players playing badly and ruining the game. So they take it out on the NEXT players they come up against and the vicious cycle continues. 
---
Instead of telling each other to be better or just ignore toxicity we should be pushing for features that can help the game humanize players, encourage communication, and put players on the same level of expectation for their experience. 
---
If you wanna check out some ideas that I think would help if combined and refined check this out. 
---
[Increasing fun, reducing toxicity. ](https://reddit.app.link/NHOjzlfx7Z)
---
Thanks
---
I heard the devs are adding some new tracks to older killer, so perhaps we will be lucky
---
If you are downed, and a killer wants the 4K, your time does not take precedence over the integrity of the gameplay, it‚Äôs ridiculous that this is something that has to be stated. The devs can‚Äôt enforce bans until dedicated servers are out, but it‚Äôs well documented that players DCing is not accepted by the devs, and trying to argue that it‚Äôs anything other than a blatant abuse of a lack of punishment is foolish. DCing makes you scum under almost every circumstance
---
Its more like wanting to workout in a gym without the body builders harassing you and acting like jackasses.
---
You can 100% expect people to not act like assholes when dealing with other people.
---
And stopping tbagging while chasing is as easy as imposing exhausted if you crouch too many times In succession.
---
Stopping flashlight clicking is increasing usage on the battery if you click it excessively.
---
That is taking the argument from the entirely wrong direction, I was very clearly and specifically explaining how a competitive player wants new players to be able to catch up and have access to all the same tools with the logical implication that a competitively minded player wants to win through skill and not because he paid more to have access to the necessary tools. You are not addressing the correct point, you are addressing literally the opposite of that point, and you're even doing so poorly because a competitively minded player **would** want access to most if not all killers and perks to better adapt to different challenges and have hands-on experience with the things they're going to face.
---
You are not basing your argument on reality and I have to assume you're not dumb enough to be oblivious to that fact.
---
Yeah playing as a new killer is always hard, especially right after a rank reset. 
---
Are you on PS4? I‚Äôm sure a few friends and I can do a custom game so you can try out a killer.
---
Spirit can be hard to play, everyone has shit games occasionally. If you see multiple survivors load in at once, all with flashlights, medkits ect, don't feel like you need to play the game. Swf can be hard to counter if you are a new killer.
---
Clown kinda
---
If the cops ever search your place while you have 2 friends over their gonna have some real questions for all of you
---
Yesss and its actually a person i watch too
---
Yup basically thats me. Ik im gunna die so just fckn pick me up already. Especially after destroying ur ruin doing 3 gens and cleansing the rest (getting rid of noed) . While looping for the 2 other gens. But my team mates did literally 4000 points worth of work. So they die n im literally at the exit gate deserve to escape but u come out the cut thirsty for the 4k. Yes.  Yes indeed ima spin tf around out of aggression. Not cuz i h8 the killer but cuz my team mates are idiots. N before sum1 says "if ur goooood it dnt matter" well maybe i think i desevre an escape if i double pip even when i didnt escape *triggered intensifies*
---
firstly, I usually pop it at about 3 gens. it doesn't need that much evil.
---
second, Run it with the memorial and its about the same speed as normal. makes games an absolute joke
---
uh... Nurse?
---
Did you intentionally hide the demadong?
---
I just want the sunglasses for my scoops steve
---
She‚Äôs not, she breaks the fundamentals of the game. Survivors have 3 means to make distance from a killer:
---
1) pallets 
---
2) vaults 
---
3) exhaustion perks
---
The nurse‚Äôs very power completely renders two of these mechanisms useless. She fundamentally ignores what survivors use against every other killer - hence breaking the game.
---
Every blink turns into a mind game, however it doesn‚Äôt feel rewarding winning the mind game as the survivor as her blink has no cool down, so the survivor knows that another one is coming in about 2 seconds.
---
I have p3 nurse and am rank 1 killer btw - just letting u know I‚Äôm not a salty survivor main ;)
---
I appreciate the offer but I think I‚Äôll stop playing the game for a bit. Maybe I‚Äôll wait a few weeks and try again when the ranks are a bit more balanced
---
imo add ins make her worse. Messing with the range and charge speed screws me over.
---
I got a 4K and 3k with him my first two games. Thought he was super fun to play.
---
Nice timing as the Nintendo Switch release is next week.
---
They only said survivors must be 18+ but a killer doesn't matter. They even said if the killer was a baby it would still be fine but not as a survivors.
---
Well he‚Äôs probably in kp2 because joker took that spot last minute just because of his movie
---
She is fine as long as swf is in the game. She is the killer equivalent to swf.
---
Serious question here, wouldn‚Äôt this present the issue of non-colourblind players adjusting the colourblind settings to make scratch marks &amp; auras more discernible?
---
I either do this or just give up and crawl towards them
---
Which the last time I did, the Nurse kept blinking away as I chased her
---
Yare Yare, Daze...
---
Me trying to hide all the weapons and armor I've made over the years:
---
"Nothing to see here officer! See it's just foam!"
---
Throws a 3d printed shield at their head like the dumbass I am.
---
Nurse on console is hard, probably ghostface or plague
---
This is why they should have a practice mode to feel out new killers. Same thing happened to me when I tried nurse. I had no idea how to play her and got destroyed so bad by the survivors. I got nurse PTSD now and I'm afraid to try newer killers or killers I haven't played before. Thankfully the new killer doesn't seem too complicated. He seems like an m1 killer with a lunge. The only thing that would really suck is playing without perks. Hopefully you get to enjoy demo and good luck.
---
I had a game where I got a 3k, and some salty survivor wrote "you didn't win"
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Darn then your gonna have to wait for the entity to take your school then
---
You didn't even have to drop the pallet. His leap only gives him forwards momentum. He can't make it across to you. He can't even leap across the hole in Badham.
---
Well see Freddy's teleport has no counter play to it while demogorgons can get sealed fast denying a teleport  and he needs to stand on them to use em
---
Please don't run self-care, just use a medkit. ESPECIALLY if you weren't planning on taking an item anyways. Its faster and lets you save a perk slot for anything else.
---
second wind just has too many conditions that need to be met for it to activate, I think in terms of risk vs reward scale it is most similar to deliverance, and slightly lower than unbreakable
---
Exactly
---
Lol happens to the best of us, nothing worse than an team mate getting insta-downed, put in the basement and DC before one gen gets finished
---
Do they?
---
We always ignored them.
---
Yes.  Here is a response to a customer question in their official support thread, dated 11 days ago.  https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000444206-Is-voice-chat-available-in-game-
---
Yeah I killed them, but I ended up salty and stressed. You don't know how annoying 360s are with console lag.
---
He's just getting into a locker that's all
---
in the past 2 days alone killers DC'ing is a huge thing on the PS4. It has to be the new update, I mean half the trophies are not even unlocking on escape.
---
At least I got that.
---
Infectious imo. Some people like rancor but I don't personally
---
That's pretty vanilla... I mean, what's rule 34?
---
Until Shred destroys pallets like it should... then it would be interesting to see the end result there.
---
28k game and a 4k? You poor thing...
---
They should probably change that. It'd be a nice mini-buff, and strengthen the Aerogorgonsmith.
---
I'll look into it more then
---
Whichever one you want homie. Do you think you‚Äôll ever play spirit or plague? Cuz I‚Äôd go the opposite of whichever one appeals to you.
---
I am on console
---
I am guilty of smacking the shit out of my thumbstick on PS4 when wiggle out feature comes out. I also have a switch and had to replace both sticks after drift issues, the only games I have that req me to use the sticks are Skyrim and ff12 the rest are side scrollers I can use the bttns to move left and right.
---
This is coming from someone who has gone through 2 controllers on PS4 violently where you can hear me smacking it over a party chat lol. 
---
Just use a controller save yourself 60-80 for a new set of joycons or having to open the light on o replace the sticks
---
It‚Äôs a... what?
---
I ThInK wE Did A GOoD JoB So FAr
---
Cool, thanks for the response!
---
Luckily the kid was grand after, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to do that myself lol
---
I get called a camper so often because the other players make it extremely obvious they are right near the hook. Scratch marks all over the place, injured survivors making noise, straight up not hiding, and then running towards the hook when I chase them. And then IM the camper because they literally won't let me walk away from the hook.
---
Yesterday I had a game where I stuck a guy in the basement. The entire rest of the team were inside the kill shack before I could even make it back up the stairs. I downed one and the other two stepped on bear traps. At the end they all called me a camper even though they literally killed *themselves* in their mad rush to save the guy.
---
Were you the killer or survivor?
---
I just saw a video of someone using them effectively, however im considering saving up for a killer so that's why I'm asking.
---
Change out Bloodhound with Dying light and you have a build more cancerous than ruin.
---
Don‚Äôt know why, but switch it up and it‚Äôs the 5 stages of grief in dbd.
---
They're already supposed to be discernible, that's why they're highlighted with red
---
You make an excellent point, however, your chance of escaping as the last survivor through their disconnects equals to your chance of escaping when they died by being hooked and killed. Killers on the other hand are not allowed to escape.
---
Turn it and it‚Äôs the picture of Lois falling down the stairs.
---
another shit totem camper reveals itself\^ 
---
ghost that was such a shitty attempt to try insulting me, i take it even the xbox girls wont give you the time of day lol . go fuck yourself "m8" and learn not to be a shitty killer that camps his totem
---
Which killer ya gonna buy?
---
never had issues with any of the achievements since release, weired
---
Im a legion main. Just like every other video game u can be goat with any character if you have the skill. Not saying ur trash just saying dnt let him being the underdog n losses prevent u from actually getting better with him. I took legion in with no perks or add ons n played for 3 days like that. I do it with every killer i bring none or one perk. No one should rely on perks or the character. If u have good enough skill n mind games u can win regardless. Everyone tells me i shouldnt use legion but i pip with julie now. Try again.
---
Get rid of the hook on the stairs and just run up there.
---
Watch for Black incense too, no hiding with that
---
He doesn‚Äôt exactly need a buff lol
---
I didn't played since April and as a rank 17 without level 3 perks, accessories and offering being bullied the whole game as a low tier killer as Leatherface isn't very fun. I got to kill them because they thought they were smarter than me at the end of the game, but I ended up stressed and salty asf so yeah, poor thing.
---
With the shards? Maybe hag.
---
Only thing with flip flop is if its done like that it can almost be a second d strike if the killer starts slugging. Maybe up to 80% or 75% instead of half.
---
Yay another post-game salt chat post. My favorite thing about these is it just shows toxicity and what‚Äôs more we only know half the side of it.
---
and the fps drop
---
The game is ftp right now and it's also on sale, there will be alot of newcomers who don't know how to play, that's just the way it is.
---
same it just seems to be the new ones, well that and the wounded healer but they say they are looking into that one already.
---
Piggy's powers make a lot of sense relative to the films.
---
I saw that today as Ghostface...I considered it for a moment...then I hooked them üôÉ
---
People who disconnect intentionally don't deserve any points for it. Rage quitting gives your teammates a huge disadvantage especially if it's two or three people dcing.
---
Yah I would say wait until MM is fixed. They did tweet about MM pairing all ranks together in matches, and they are aware of the issue, so they‚Äôre working to resolve it. Hopefully by tomorrow.
---
Been seeing a lot people playing Steve and Nancey lately.
---
Interesting idea, I can imagine the dog would look pretty bizarre seeing what the entity did to the horse
---
I definitely agree. The quitters bonus should be larger.
---
Report this freak. Sorry this happened to you chief
---
Don't forget the bad players that blame "tunneling" on them doing something dumb.
---
I had a game where the person got unhooked and the entire team was there. Everyone else scattered and went towards windows, pallets, stairs, etc. Except the person who got unhooked. They ran right into the open with nothing to loop around. So obviously I went for them because they made themselves the easiest target. Post game chat was nothing but accusations of tunneling from them.
---
In another one they unhooked the guy and he just crouched in the corner by the hook as if I couldn't see him. Didn't move away at all. Again, I was "tunneling" because I didn't just ignore the guy who wasn't even running away.
---
Sometimes if you get taken out by the killer before everyone else its because everyone else is playing better than you and you are the weak link. That doesn't mean you got tunneled.
---
As a killer, if I get two or more dc's in a game, I just give the last few survivers an escape by opening the gates.
---
Hmmmmm I guess rancor since hag isn‚Äôt really a chase killer.
---
If you are already broken from something other than second wind then it will only heal you after you've removed the other broken effect. With no mither it will never activate.
---
It isn't a game-changing buff, just a quality of life improvement for BalancedLandingField
---
If I remember correctly she only briefly gave you the time of day, before you offended her with a remark about ‚Äúonly cheating on her if she deserved it‚Äù and she jumped to another guy right?
---
Vommy mommy
---
The thing is tunneling kinda isnt in the killers best interest since you can stall the game more by injuring everyone seperately, and survivors cant help how fast gens get done and there is no other OBJ. Case point being gens get done too quick anyway, survivors dont really have control over it.
---
No other real way to react to this that does it justice.
---
Its just lol worthy.
---
Well it‚Äôs not really the same. 
---
In order to purposely tunnel someone off the hook you sort of have to stay nearby so you can catch them after the unhook, which means you‚Äôre proxy camping, which means you‚Äôre not chasing someone else, which means you‚Äôre not pressuring gens, which means you get gen rushed.
---
If you‚Äôre slugging though, you kinda deserve it TBH
---
Glad to know we have the same erotic fan fics

I had an idea for one for Billy &amp;/or Bubba where after charging the chainsaw for above 45/50% total charge if you're hit with a pallet, it breaks &amp; you suffer no stun like how Freddy's dream pallets don't stun him. But the drawback for Billy would be a reduction to Sprint speed from 230% to 155% sprint speed. &amp; for Bubba it would be reducing how many times he swings by 2 or 3.
---
I havent seen anything like what you're describing personally. Plus prestige is in 3 tiers, so your first prestiged tier is just the bloody torso, then legs, then face. If I'm correct, its been a few months since I've prestiged someone.
---
Just play the game how you want there‚Äôs no rule book that says you cant tunnel
---
It looks exactly the same.
---
Looks like it's set to 50% or maybe 0% resolution, and then put on Medium settings.
---
Maybe you're referring to the gross graphics of the tutorial? On the PC version the graphics in the tutorial are vastly different (and disgusting) than compared to the in-game graphics. Check for yourself
---
I was maining Nancy in the PTB and didn't care about my build because I was mostly playing against new Demogorgons. Now, I have her at level 40 and only used her once because I can't get balanced landing in the bloodweb and that's a big part of my game right now. I won't bring her in until I have that.
---
I've noticed most killers are running the typical builds with Demo. BBQ and Ruin so it's possible they are waiting for their builds. Or they are waiting for payday on Friday.
---
For the entity.
---
Aka becoming toxic because someone likes picking a character.
---
No, getting somebody out of the game early slows it down more than injuring everyone can, unless literally everybody stops to heal every time.
---
Spirit. Fucking spirit.
---
You literally ignored everything I said. So I'm not replying to you lol.
---
Thanks man! ill look it up!

Press the activation button to start parkouring around the map, can climb walls, go faster on walls, and can jump from generators, until the bar depletes

Purring around

Your purring attract nearby survivors up to 20/35/40 meters if they stand still
---
Stray cat

Can summon air bubbles that can be used to make you or survivors bounce, is up to you how to use it, as a trap, or a speed boost
---
Dark tail
---
Allows you to hit a survivor 2 times in a row, every 20 seconds, this will give survivors the mendong effect
---
Now *this* is podracing!
---
&gt; your time does not take precedence over the integrity of the gameplay
---
Your time is as important as you want it to be - It's a fucking videogame at the end of the day.
---
&gt;but it‚Äôs well documented that players DCing is not accepted by the devs, and trying to argue
---
And? I never tried to dispute that once.
---
People DC if you waste their time by leaving them on the floor endlessly. I never said it was accepted or should go unpunished, I'm saying that's why people do it.
---
&gt;DCing makes you scum under almost every circumstance
---
Idk why you're so angry. Again - It's a fucking video game.
---
Yeah the wriggle is a sign of distrust in the killers sense of mercy, and when your fate %100 lies in the killers hands you have nothing but trust and mercy left.
---
As was my comment
---
It happens more often than you may think.
---
No problem. Run some gen protector perks to really maximize your effectiveness
---
We found the man who gets upset over losing, ladies and gents
---
Blendettes gotta go bro. Tunneling isnt toxic anyway. It's called a game mechanic. I honestly think the only thing that is toxic for a killer is face camping. Which I've never done. You wont understand cause you obviously are a survivor main
---
No one
---
No one at all 
---
Not even killer mains
---
People who literally only play killer n have not once touched survivor- BUFFF EVERYONEEEEEEEEE.
---
He's going so fast, his breeze is blowing up stuff on the fridge lol
---
That doesn't make you a tunneler, thats just teammates being dumb for not distracting so the injured one can get away. Although a tip to be better is that you shouldnt go back to the hook in the first place, because that gives other survivors more time to do gens , instead just continue to chase or check gens that arent near the hook, unless there are only 2 survivors left obviously.
---
I understand but I'm talking about full toolbox best perks and such, If people are gonna complain day and night about killer perks, why not survivor gen rush builds, why do they get the "just doing their jobs" protection. If a killer builds to win why are they called out for it?
---
That description is hilarious 10/10
---
üòîüëå
---
Thats it, if they concede defeat then their loss is ours to choose, if they dont want to kneel then they will hang.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d6ls49/a_bug_occured_and_he_was_staring_at_me/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I wasn‚Äôt expecting that
---
Isn‚Äôt there a day one patch the devs definitely wouldn‚Äôt leave a mega frame drop in there unless you worked on troll and I
---
Congrats, and dont let the toxicity some people give off give off bad vibes. If you got any questions if you're on PC Mr. Myers is my name
---
Let them whine and bitch. Unless your sitting on top of the hooked person don't worry. It's not your fault that the hooked person didn't hide very well
---
Unfortunately yeah.. It's just aggravating to play with such a ridiculous difference of rank.
---
You realize this change would just lead to more face camping, not less, right?
---
Up the Ante gives you a percent bonus per survivor (excluding yourself) that is still alive. Tier 1 is 1% Tier 2 is 2% and Tier 3 if 3%. Meaning if everyone is still alive it gives you a 9% bonus to unhooking for a total of 13%. This applies to the entire team. Luck offerings also add a small bonus to this bonus.
---
That's for Survivors. Also they said under 21, Frank is 19, Joey is 18, Julie is 17, and Susie is 16. If you need proof, both of Susie's skins are called "Sophomore Gitters"
---
 I do play siege but not as much as i used to. I feel like it's still way worse than anything else out there, based on my experience anyway. Maybe I just get really unlucky with the lobbies
---
Now use them together and you have the god tier Blendette build
---
Now that I reread it, I can't unsee your perspective lol. Fixed it
---
Honestly looks to me a little like Lara Croft especially in the body style
---
I get the same on ps4 with swf
---
&gt;This\^ also when you do hit them camp that little shit like you just bought a tent. Theyll hate message you for it, but your purpose has been fulfilled. Dont let the bitch live
---
"Save the best for Last" os a great perk for this if you get enough stacks, you will recover from your attacks fast enough to down them all. Just make sure that your obsession gets hit last. 
---
It is always great when they think they can bumrush the hook and bodyblock and 3 seconds later they are all lying on the floor.
---
Take my upvoteüòÇ
---
Devs said no one in the game is a minor. Easy. They're imaginary characters so if the ppl who created them decide they're not minors, then they're not.
---
Lol this is why i bring a map everytime a new map is released lol.
---
they shrine of secrets were also updated, so i bought extra perks for bloodpoints :P
---
Imo i dont think they should get protection from being called out, there are a lot of bullshit gen rushing builds and they are not fun to go against at all. From my experience i never got called out for anything other than tunneling because its just not fun to get tunneled. Maybe the occasional insult for using NOED but thats about it. Everything after that is just survivors salty that they lost.
---
Are the rest of the cast just staring at you?
---
This comment is a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
---
I mean rank means nothing in this game
---
Holy shit you fucking killed him.
---
I'm laughing so hard haha good job!
---
This is actually why i stopped playing. I started as huntress and it got to the point where one of the  survivors would actively track me down to gain my attention. I wasnt that great with the throwing axes and they would always be ganging up on me. At one point i felt awful because i felt like i had to camp a hook just to try and get 1 kill and they started typing awful stuff after the round ended
---
there is r/dbdLFG and there is the dbd discord server.
---
no idea why you got downvoted its true I have been saying it for ages. They do not care for us at all. 
---
Yet oh here comes a Switch and Mobile versions! can not wait for the shit they see.
---
That's because they fuck things up for existing players with ranking error, visual bugs, etc. How many existing players will recommend this game to their friends when they've got burned badly by the devs?
---
Or stop being a bitch and being toxic in a game?
---
No offense, but are you actually stupid?  
---
I have 2 comments on this post, saying I have played ALOT. I got 110 hours past 2 weeks :)
---
not to mention reinviting won‚Äôt often work :/ was trying to play with a friend last night and on my end she was in my lobby but i wasn‚Äôt in hers. had to restart the entire game to get it to work and then it only worked once before error/not showing up in each other‚Äôs lobbies kicked back in. wtf.
---
Invisible cunt is still one my favorite killers.
---
Matchmaking has sucked ever since they introduced the terrible new matchmaking system. Waiting in a menu to get into a lobby to wait is terrible and I hope they revert it.
---
Claud is pointing at his ass lol
---
Agreed
---
Honestly I know it‚Äôs easier said than done but you‚Äôve just gotta stick with whatever killer you choose to try out, you‚Äôll only get better if you play them. Yeah you‚Äôll have games where you get stomped on but that can happen with any killer so you‚Äôve gotta shrug it off and go into another game and keep improving
---
Good Luck üíïüíï
---
Definitely not on Xbox unless I‚Äôm playing killer
---
I honestly think they need to drastically up the time it takes to close a portal.
---
It cant be that when i get a notification that one player started closing one, he has closed it before i finished putting down one right under myself so i could teleport there.
---
This is just bs right now.
---
Yeah, thats the thing I'm talking about. When I go solo, I get match with and against people around my rank. When I do a 3 man SWF squad, I end up against rank 20's
---
So again, I think it's something caused by SWF
---
Ik im on it. Hence the "this is the only dbd communit ive joined that doesnt have lfg" actually this is literally the only gaming social media ive joined that doesnt have lfg as a rule? I like have tons of other games i follow on here. Im honestly surprised thats a rule.
---
Might wanna tell that to Xbox killers
---
Who?
---
still doubt it since I still see a lot of complaints from solo people but fair enough
---
we¬¥re gonna live forever.

Bbq and chili

Its because it is a super common post that doesn't invoke any discussion about dbd.
---
* Screenshots highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
&gt;It‚Äôs a game many people play competitively. 
---
It's also a game many people just play for fun.
---
&gt; Abusing the devs lack of ability to detect intentional DC‚Äôs interferes with competitive players trying to gain pips, it‚Äôs an issue that needs to be addressed
---
So your solution is to fuck over his team mates and give the killer free shit? No.
---
&gt; it‚Äôs an issue that needs to be addressed and justifying it with ‚ÄúJuSt HoOk ThEm‚Äù solves nothing.
---
OP didn't get points for his hook because he slugged a guy, which then Dcd. So ye, before we go fucking over survivors for no reason. It could have been solved by just hooking them.
---
&gt;it‚Äôs a video game, but it‚Äôs also a competitive game, and in competitive gaming environments, your time doesn‚Äôt take precedence over the integrity of the match
---
Idk why you keep saying this, People can value their time however the fuck they want.
---
They can face punishment for dcing but to say they cannot value their time over a video game is ignorant.
---
Or when I rejoin the lobby and my buddy can't see me. So we have to reopen the lobby.
---
I see killers complain about that all the time
---
Hahahah 
---
NO
---
You can just spin around your left stick in a circle to wiggle
---
Mine's definitely Otzdarva, the guy's just plain fun and great content. Lovely stream and personality to watch while providing great gameplay and commentary. 
---
I used to watch Tru3 a lot and was even primesubbed at some point, but the man has become somewhat insufferable imho. Like, i totally get that streamsnipers and whatever are super annoying but between the clickbaity titles on yt and him then more often than not complaining and shitting on not red rank teammates... na. Everything that isn't sucking his dick is "a hate boner" and when he's wondering why his chat is being unhappy with him shittalking mid tier ranks as "shit players" and "garbage" beware of saying "maybe you shouldn't shittalk ranks that 90% of the playerbase are in?" because you will get banned :D Idk, i liked to watch his content occasionally, but the man's malding hard with his echobubble. Sad to see, but happy i found Otz. &lt;3 
---
Might look into noob3 and the panda.
---
Fair point Blue.  It's just frustrating to see the rank 3 Claudette play like a rank 18 Claudette (nothing against rank 18's you guys are supposed to suck you're still learning, the 3 should know better though lol).
---
Yeah, if they flash light clicked and teabagged, then they are going on the hook. If they just played the game , I'll probably give them the hatch.
---
Not putting words in your mouth. Literally just summed up what you said in one word. Not making shit up. Telling the truth and you just don't like it. If you're getting so salty over someone telling you the truth, then may you should take a break from the sub and the internet as a whole.
---
They meant that for survivors, not Killers. They even said that a baby as a killer would be fine, as long as they weren't a survivor.
---
...its literally a discussion about playing the game. And questions are allowed on here. Is it not a question. Ik u didnt make the rules but thats just stupid. Who cares if its common. Its a freaking video game thats the point of a freaking video game. Glad this page thinks a shirtless picture of meyers is more of a video game discussion then ppl asking if others are on the same consule. Wtf did i join.
---
I'm not salty I'm actually fine. Just not trying to argue with someone who doesnt agree with my opinion. Its a waste of time
---
No I am not stupid, also 110 out of 336 hours is not a lot, and consider the DLC hit 2 days ago the math is still not adding up because now basing it off your 110 hours across two days even at the 7 1/2 hours per day it would not be enough.
---
As most average games with a low payout of 18k last 10 mins. with load times say 15 would still take you to around 508k blood points in that 7 1/2 hours time.
---
which would be another 1mil sure but even with high payout dailies for the two days you are missing at least another 700k - 900k.
---
Yeah its not adding up at all.
---
long press on an app then hit the pencil, then press on the icon. That should bring up a select theme menu where you can open ur gallery and find it from there
---
Pattern wouldn't really make much difference. On some maps, for me at least, the scratch marks colour and the ground colours are indistinguishable. So much of the game is based around the yellow/red (including brown) spectrum. We need something on the other end of the colour wheel to help, really.
---
So you don't mind people being gay, you just think we shouldn't do it in public. So you don't like gay people.
---
Okay paedophile
---
Yeah, by it‚Äôs very natural Flip-Flop is an anti-slugging perk. It‚Äôs just not a very effective anti-slugging perk.
---
Keep assuming you know everything. It makes you look intelligant buddy ;)
---
It was a sad day
---
Exactly what I was saying
---
No, he very much said he doesn't like it because it is gay. His words, not mine. Sorry you don't like one variety of post. Other people do. That's why it gets popular.
---
&gt; Its oversaturated and no one wants to point it out.
---
So you're either blind or illiterate.
---
Then they could adjust the power/duration/etc. of scratch marks as a whole, after the colour change.
---
ghostface. he gets me every fucking time peaking around a corner
---
I think this is more appropriate.
---
Tunneling &amp; Gen Rushing = Playing the Objective.
---
They can value their time all they want. The game won‚Äôt, and it shouldn‚Äôt, you can‚Äôt competitively balance a game around ‚Äúfun‚Äù. The point of this post is to discuss a fix to the DC issue, just shrugging it off isn‚Äôt a fix, and giving the killer a way to combat salty DCers doesn‚Äôt fuck over survivors, but survivors DCing, denying a killer not 1, but often 2 sacrifices, heavily fucks over killers, and it should be addressed
---
"My problem is with people who flaunt being gay like they always have a megaphone."
---
Ghostface for actually playing him. Bubba for bbq and Franklin's
---
Honestly, if it's not super obv and you don't add a /s you'll get downvoted to hell and back.
---
Well I mean I don‚Äôt really care when killers tunnel but like it‚Äôs worse the killer because your not jungleing the other three  survivors and gens will fly because of it
---
Depends on how you play him but in general he isn‚Äôt as good overall. A good nurse or billy will always outplay a good doctor. 
---
His ability is good for pressure in the early game but unless you‚Äôre playing a delay/pressure build he falls of rapidly.
---
I had this happen on Hawkins Lab. I let the last 2 just farm points because often I've been in their shoes. I'm not going to get many points, so no need to take that frustration out on the survivors. Let them get a W and better luck next game
---
Lol excuse my ignorance but what the heck does As /s mean?
---
Whatever you say incel
---
Hmm. Didn't know Tom Brady played Dead by Daylight.
---
Cool
---
Only thing scary about demogorgon is that vault animation
---
I meant add a /s, typo. When someone makes a comment that is meant as sarcasm, it can be hard to tell through text, so you put a /s at the end to tell people you're joking.
---
I'd rather still have my virginity than have lost it to a minor.
---
Just saying facts is all. Sorry.
---
Unfair advantages are only a bad thing when it doesn't suit you, eh?
---
Grow up.
---
Ah I see. Thank you. I'm such an idiot when It comes to that sort of thing XD
---
I'm not intending it to be real. I just thought it'd look cool.
---
I got matched with this guy twice and both games his teammate dc'd or killed themselves at the start, so i farmed them, let them get gens off without making it obvious i was letting them, and let them go at the end, everybody got decent bp.
---
Yes, I am aware I was posting an anecdote. I'm not sure why you're trying to clarify that while offering no additional insight or evidence of your own, anecdotal or not. Please see my followup reply to the original poster if you're still confused about the intent of me posting said anecdote. I even offer a solution for user feedback so people don't think reporting actually does nothing.
---
I... I hovered over the icon, 3rd from the right, to see what the perk was.
---
I'm *not* Big-Brain-Power right now.
---
Fuck your insidious facecamp! If I wanna exercise my arms while on the hook, you have to smell my arm pits while face camping me! 
---
Also I don‚Äôt put on deodorant! 
---
HEX: Bad Smell‚Äôs!

We are aware of an issue causing rank discrepancy in matchmaking, resulting in new players matching with experienced players. We know about this issue and have identified the source of the problem. We are working on a fix, thank you for your patience.
---
K
---
I really hope you reported them to save the rest of us the hassle
---
Ghostface wasn't that long ago
---
My top 3 right now are Pennywise (ik people don't like the idea but I personally think it would be cool), Pinhead, and Candyman
---
Haven‚Äôt played in awhile, dying light has tokens now?
---
You‚Äôve had a very different experience to me on console clearly lol
---
Can't wait to see the killer tap it twice with their foot and it explodes
---
Spirit and billy are better then gf and plague lol especially for chases
---
That was a sick play man
---
If it were me doing that I would have smacked my head or toes against the corner of the stove because I have shitty luck.
---
Killers can‚Äôt be fine ‚Äúas long as thier is a swf,‚Äù you can‚Äôt balance a game like that. Base nurse is high tier but her add ons make her overpowered.
---
laughs in Franklin's demise
---
Just from my own experience as a killer, I've seen more players who have prestiged dc more than non-prestige players when they fail to evade me. It's not that I target them first, I just go for whoever I see and if you dont leave me sights, I'll kill you. Lol
---
Just had this happen to me so I made a meme to vent my frustrations about it.
---
Hex: Devour Ass for the hag
---
They did not release this patch.
---
"Soon"
---
What rank? Did you get a chance to level him beforehand? Playing as him with limited perks left me pretty underwhelmed with his strength.
---
Stupid question but is your phone on silent
---
why would you put 2 insta heals on 1 medkit? also if i saw you in my game i would literally tunnel you first, by taking advantage of the greed of your teammates that will race each other to unhook you. hook, walk away just far enough, down again, hook again, repeat 1 more time.
---
It took me like 2 months to realize this game had blood trails.
---
It is free to play for a little bit and the game along with the dlc‚Äôs are on sale
---
It's pretty toxic if you ask me. I only teabag survivors to thank them for healing me or getting me off hook, but never tbag the killer.
---
Wow lol could you get more basic?
---
It‚Äôs a bug, it doesn‚Äôt happen often to me. It can either be really annoying or really hilarious tbh
---
If your phones on vibrate it won‚Äôt have sound, all you have to do is turn it to ‚Äúloud‚Äù mode üòä
---
What my perks? Lol
---
i hate when people waste my time at the gate teabagging waiting for me to run up and hit them.
---
Hah, You‚Äôre doing better than me, haven‚Äôt got any of the characters above level 20 yet.
---
Whispers is good. Surveillance/Discordance can be great on Spirit for added gen pressure and extra tracking. Pop goes the Weasel works well with her too and has added synergy with BBQ. You can never go wrong with Enduring + Spirit Fury and it practically ensures downs at certain loops. 
---
Once you get good enough at Spirit you won't need NOED, you'll kill Survivors most of the time before endgame is an issue. I only bother bringing Franklin's if I see 4 toolboxes and/or keys and even then sometimes it isn't needed.
---
Hi, Fedex here, got some kudos for ya, sign here please.
---
Seriously though, nice shot.
---
Ok explain what it does please
---
Ohhhhh yeah. I accidentally hit my crouch once and was tunneled for it.
---
They were implemented during the PTB but were to fucked to put in this patch
---
A good trick I found out with him is to place a portal right by someone you just hooked (something I wasn't aware of too is that the portals don't show to the survivors until you have actually used that teleporter. Theyre invisible until then.)
---
Next step is to go towards a gen and maybe damage it, but after the person has been hooked for 10-15 seconds, place a teleporter down and teleport to the guy you hooked. You'll always catch people by surprise. It's really fulfilling when you start your channel the exact second they start unhooking someone and you catch them by surprise.
---
I  don't  think I am even going to use the  prestige clothes  much, because  I have  bought  some custom stuff from store.
---
I started this game on Monday and chose Myers. Why? Halloween is the best. 
---
I was lucky that, out if my 5 runs that night, I had no hate. I did have one group where 3 would circle me clicking flashlights to protect the fourth, but I didn't know what flashlight spamming was at the time. That said, even that group was fine with me after because I told them I honestly thought they were a cohesive group. 
---
I know my time is coming.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ have my upvote
---
Ok good to know I‚Äôm not blind lol
---
I hate this as well.
---
Ouch... 
---
So basically just another day for BHVR. Got it.
---
Although if it was 100% accurate then the reverse bear traps would probably instantly activate or something. Amanda doesn‚Äôt like giving people a chance.
---
Fixed it. Thank you!
---
. I take it ima have to level alot of other killers to get those perks. I'm still kind of a noob at killer. Played mostly survivor. Franklin's seems to help me cause I always get SWF teams and I get wrecked without it. But I'm going to Google and look into those perks. Thank you!
---
If you dont want the chat close the game some people want to talk with the others
---
Come back on the 13th you'll have more fun.
