FINALLY, COSPLAYS THAT ARENT LEGION
---
---
---
No one:
---

---
Nobody:
---
Literally no one:
---
Absolutely no one:
---
Legitimately not a single person:
---
Not a soul in this entire universe:
---
Absolutely cock and ball torturously no one:
---
Literally not a touch from the ever flowing river of consciousness:
---
Not even a breath of wind, of which trails endlessly behind an ever moving civilization of thriving beings, their very movements displacing the molecules lurking in the air. And with the immense size also comes immense insignificance, as these beings dwarf atoms relative, proving that everything is a construct of our subjectivity:
---
Its blatant sarcasm
---
No it was on xbox my pc is too crap to run games xD
---
You see his yet find it hard to see mine. Hex-Baited.
---
Unfortunately no...the cost of human skin right now on the black market is so inflated right now that I can‚Äôt possibly buy it. Maybe later when the price comes down.
---
You have great teeth
---
We need more Frankü§§ Nice cosplay!
---
XD
---
I hear ya! STBFL is my favorite perk on a lot of killers. Trapper and Piggy especially.
---
Yours isnt a 15 year old video
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be three survivors since one of the survivors has to be hooked for it to activate?
---
Haha keep up the content. I‚Äôll check out your YouTube. Let me know if you ever want to SwF.
---
That would be considered child porn so I must refrain from posting.
---
Whenever that happens I just call if a swf and call it a day. Also, congrats on the 4k
---
I personally like to watch them as 1, 2, (maybe 4 and 5) then H20 but the eye plot hole thing i so hard to ignore xD
---
The devs are aware
---
I would say I‚Äôm a pretty good wraith with the right ADDONS at the right time my favourite addon build is all seeing wraith
---
One thing the game doesn't tell you, is when you're holding a Survivor you can press R (by default on the computer) to drop them.
---
This means they can't wiggle out of your grasp and you can now start smacking the others without having to worry about anything.
---
I know it's annoying they put the endgame in so people wouldn't hang around at the end and be toxic with the killer but they still do it with every chance they can it's so sad.
---
It's not really unfair, but it could be tweaked. Either reduce the stun or make it last 45 seconds. No cc should last longer than 3 seconds in this game.
---
No they fixed dead hard, it still doesn't give you more distance.
---
Did you bring instant heal?ü§£
---
Be free!
---
Perk Dead Hard, Lightweight, and Spine Chill. When Spine chill goes off run away and your track will be gone before they know your were there and Dead Hard is in case you need to reach that pallet and need a couple more steps to make it without getting downed. Self care so you don't depend on others. Vigil to refresh Dead Hard faster or Botany to heal faster.
---
r/okbuddrretard
---
Very original! I love it! Good job!
---
Ok cool.. I been trying to survive a little
---
Bahaha
---
Omg. Seriously.
---
‚ÄúYou are not a clown, you are the entire Michael.‚Äù
---
I had a feeling that if they escaped I bet they'd put 'Ez' xD
---
Every now and then, yeah. Sometimes I feel bad for the survivors or sometimes there might be nice offer stacking (like four gateaus or bloody party streamers) and we just do what we do. Most times no one complains.
---
True, true. It just gets a bit old
---
ok ok im diggin that one
---
Tbh I just turn around and walk backwards and it usually works
---
Now way you are this dumb. Yes dude it gives you more distance to loop. If you don‚Äôt think so you are using the perk wrong. And yes Ik ur not talking about the bug
---
I'm being sarcastic just keep taking the Hex-Bait lol. Matchmaking wait times have me bored af
---
Where my shirtless boi at
---
Yeah. There doesnt have to be a killer but it could be  a ps4 exclusive character
---
Yeah no. I've faced it and I've used it for distance before. You do gain distance where you wouldn't otherwise.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Instead of taking a negative from the situation why not use the feedback as motivation to branch out to cosplays that will put your skills to the test, for those interested in Cosplaying my friend Ryan Wells has a FB and is a professional commissioned cosplayer and was just recently commissioned to do a cosplay outfit for the new Dark Crystal. He travels for cons a lot and sometimes has his own Panel. I happened to meet him through Grindr before I knew he was a professional cosplayer  and it was pretty awesome seeing how someone with a studio apartment can fit their life‚Äôs work in such a small space. 
---
It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôre assholes, legion is just basic cosplay and not hard at all, anyone could do it  and it doesn‚Äôt require much work compared to building a actual COMMISSIONED cosplay for a show
---
Honestly when it comes to killers only Spirit is worth it imo. Clown and Plague are alright but spirit is the second strongest killer and has pretty good perks as teachables. I'd vote unlock spirit then snag perks that are must have from the shrine as they appear, it's rare when good perks hit the shrine so you may end up waiting awhile to even pick any up that are worth it.
---
So you think finding a player at the start of the game, hooking him, camping him, giving no opportunity to escape is toxic. Why do you rely on camping so much? The only explanation would be, that you're not confident of getting a 4k without tunneling or camping, while relying on OP perks like BBQ, and auras to death camp someone. You put every survivor at a disadvantage, granting the 1 player you couldn't find an opportunity to escape. It's always the OP perk killers that camp.... not necessarily, but happens often.
---
I like how theirs no sounds until the main screen allows you to press X.
---
But when the sound comes in
---
***YOU BETTER START RUNNING***
---
u never played against me... im the snekeast GF ever
---
Everyone disliked that
---
That‚Äôs what I was waiting for
---
Get back here Laurie!! ARROOOOO!!
---
Sorry but if you tell yourself this you are probably a bad killer
---
don't get your panties in such a twist
---
They definitely look grumpy haha
---
God damit
---
**10/10 mate!** but what I want to know is what is your second perk? It's hard to tell with the icon.
---
You always have great clips man
---
First game of the day I got farmed off the hook and then left behind to go fuck myself. The whole team would not heal me and kept leading the fuckface wraith to where I was working gens.
---
I have a normal Xbox and I can play it literally all day and it wins make a sound
---
And you don't get in on the selfie? smh
---
Shit, our cover's been blown. Abort mission!
---
Thanks for the kind words, means alot..
---
Bill: NANI?!?
---
I feel you, matchmaking seems like it takes forever.
---
Your gonna need some of this https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cokqf5/stock_up_here/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
No but it says removed
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be able to play 90% of my games with a controller
---
Okay this one is good
---
Thank.
---
Perfect. I guess profanity is frowned upon. I guess I'll go back to just not playing the game then. Not much else to do.
---
Yea I need my sensitivity high as hell
---
It was a p2 bill without unbreakable or borrowed time
---
It's not a choice in Dauntless.
---
Now instead of regular furries we have murderous ones
---
Nice cosplay!
---
Looks great!
---
Oof, I was only a pip away from 12 tho :,(
---
While people can do as they please, I'd like to see some originality in the cosplays. I've seen too many Huntress, Spirit, Legion, and Pig outfits to find anymore of them impressive.
---
Why were they yelling at a cat?
---
Haha that was awesome.
---
Evidently i need to check out billy. I've only really played him a few times,had no idea he could go running across the whole friggin map. Mine goes like 10 steps lol.
---
You have some fun clips.gonna give you a sub.
---
Starting with legion is fine but that‚Äôs not what this shitpost is about if we‚Äôre going to talk about newcomers ( assuming the people cosplaying are even new so that‚Äôs not a solid counter argument for you)
---
Lol.. Thanks! Try him with spike boots and Thompson's moonshine
---
I would say the only add ons are Judith‚Äôs tombstone and the infinite evil within 3 hair.  That‚Äôs the only way to get the
---
Trophy.
---
Are you trolling?
---
I would like to see this too, but wouldn't that make the shrine useless? which im down for but from bhvr's perspective it seems like a loss
---
Can't really tell either because of the low quality + coloring, but I'm 80% sure it's NOED.
---
Because bodyblocking the hook, which allows more time to wiggle, is not a toxic thing to do. It's obnoxious, as most things Survivors tend to do are, but it's still a small tactic that can work sometimes. On the flip side, camping and tunneling aren't toxic either. It's obnoxious to Survivors, but anything the Killer does can be seen as obnoxious. Toxicity is perceptive, especially when you're more bias against one side.
---
It just shows a huge lack of awareness.  If I think for a moment the Killer is going to catch me and down me and I'm around the basement house, I nope the fuck outta there.  If I'm sneaking in for a save and the Killer sees me too early, I run him directly away from the hooked survivor.  Most people are so worried about dying that they don't realize they are killing someone else by looping near the hook, or even worse, bringing the killer across the map to the hook while being chased.
---
The worst part is when that hooked survivor dies because of those shenanigans it just makes the person being chased less likely to fulfill the goals to win the game because they have one less person to help them.  
---
I jUsT wAnT tO LiVe FoR aNoThEr 30 SeCoNdS bRo
---
Besides the lack of dismemberment pretty good spirit cosplay and bing bong boy is even hotter in person (I watch a bit to much farmer John)
---
The shitpost is literally about discouraging people to try making more cosplays
---
I'm a killer main on ps4 and i support this message
---
Huntress is the queen of thiccness. She reigns supreme over the rest.
---
I didn't know the Wraith carried around mail in his waistband...interesting. And the naked of the arm with hair..lmao. Come on.
---
It‚Äôs not different on PC or Xbox either. I have them all and killers dodge. I don‚Äôt see it as much on Xbox as I do on PS4 though.
---
I think you just need a high end phone for it. I don‚Äôt think a 30$ phone will cut it.
---
Purple flashlight (preferably with rare add-ons) or nothing.
---
No it‚Äôs not...
---
But it‚Äôs not fine. I get what you‚Äôre saying and not trying to argue with *you* but how am I as the survivor supposed to know when I should use say Dead Hard in a chase and when the killer behind me is going to miss and is just baiting a waste of that perk?
---
In other words you're a salty console hag who got offended by a text. High quality content right here üëå
---
Same, most people wiggle though. Their loss ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Had a survivor do this to me as Spirit once while I was running Rancor. She thought she‚Äôd escape. 
---
Most satisfying mori of all time.
---
Missing Joey...
---
probably
---
Had something close to this with Myers before. I saw them waiting and they kept tea bagging so I walked around the corner and just waited and one of them came out to investigate so I hit tier 3, downed them and hooked them.
---
He‚Äôs low key lookin thiccüëÄ
---
One thing I've noticed as a killer main is a rampant victim complex. Killers have spent so much time being told by streamers and allegedly top tier players that they are victims of BHVRs pro Survivior bias and toxic Surviviors who bully them with anything from pallet stuns, to flashlights, to teabagging, even exhaustion perks are considered toxic in the killer community. 
---
To me, that's the issue. Killer mains run rampant with a victim complex so their default mindset when they see a medkit is "instaheal, dodge" or when they see a flashlight "must be purple. Dodge". Stuff like that. It's annoying bc BHVR has thrust all the responsibility for the match onto the killer so when the killer is an entitled crybaby who doesn't want Surviviors to have powerful tools, it gets frustrating as a Survivior to use these tools expecting a challenge, just for the killer to cop out.
---
Okay but Wraith is cute when you think about him but EVERY wraith I play against in game is toxic, evil, LOVES to kill, and S W E A T Y
---
wort
---
That's not the issue, it's the fact that if a survivor knows about a trap, they can confirm safety from danger while popping it even if the Hag teleports the moment the trap is triggered. I've tested this in KYF, it's consistent. My buddy was able to confirm his safety from my hit at every point. Only gets stronger with swf and OoO. In my opinion, the survivor popping the trap should not be rewarded for popping a Hag trap if the Hag teleports immediately. That's just cheesy.
---
i managed to get a 3k with a brutal killer result blocking my screen the whole match &amp; still got harassing messages from the only survivor
---
Running unbreakable with no mither just gave me a ungodly amount of chromsomes, regardless of it being slightly beneficial because you recover faster
---
We need to keep borrowed time over everything for David and his noble sacrifice
---
Yeah sorry to come in so hot. I know I know I can be an ass and not to shit on what you like but thank you for being nice back. I‚Äôm just really passionate because I love dbd and I honestly think a one of a kind game is better than a trending stamp but hey who am I to judge? If people want to play as a character from there then fuck it. Lol
---
You talk a lot for someone in stalking range
---
but can you really blame them for not wanting to play against that, even if its just a possibility they have any of that?
---
Video clip and report
---
*SwaggotMcFaggot has entered the chat*
---
Lol bro any map controlled killer like nurse and billy it doesn‚Äôt matter how far you go because you can just zoom right back to the hook. Also billy is a one shot killer like what??? Why are you slugging off the hook. Dawg. Lol
---
As of right now, Franklin‚Äôs Demise, Save the Best for Last, Hex: Ruin, and Barbecue and Chili (only because I need BPS for leveling up clown for Pop Goes the Weasel). 
---
Once I get more comfortable going against red ranks I‚Äôll probably swap out ruin for Monitor and Abuse and BBQ for Nurse‚Äôs Calling,
---
As for addons, pretty much just Teleport range + triggered trap time always. If i‚Äôm out of trapped time, I use the setting time addons. If i‚Äôm out of TP Range, ill just play someone else to farm BP for addons.
---
thank youuuuu
---
No.. words..
---
Tf is wrong with you
---
Proceeds to drop you in basement and wait for the entity to do its job
---
Because we shouldn't be able to just deny people a game if a killer DC's on menu you should be put back in a new trial instantly because this would fill a killer that's waiting for a lobby which is good cause god knows we wait long
---
Not a bug people, if you lost bp, they refund you the amount and it can exceed the cap.
---
When your friend says it‚Äôs legion and you get exposed...
---
I play both as well.  There are way more instant downs than instant heals, as there should be because it's 1v4, so it's balanced. :)
---
They did say in a recent devstream they weren‚Äôt looking to remove tiers but still lower grind. What I think may happen is having 4 perks show up and you pick 2.
---
Since when did fans start to overheat? I thought it was the components, namely the gpu and cpu, sometimes motherboard that overheated. Also, a pc will fix this problem. Trust me, it's so nice being able to go and take a glass of water ehilst waiting for dbd to boot, and not have to come back to a burning cpu/gpu.
---
People say you take the game hostage you‚Äôre not you simply know how to try and win
---
Y‚Äôall look awesome! Great job!
---
It‚Äôs time to gen rush... FOR. YOUR. LIIIIIIFE! Good luck, and don‚Äôt fuck the looping up!
---
Are you in an swf?
---
If so,that probably has a lot to do with.
---
SWF's are exceptionally bullshitty on the weekends.
---
They seem to pull out all of the stops to shit on the killers day. Insta heals,99'ing hooks so they can break them as the killer walks over,flashlights you can see shining from china,toolboxes that could repair the space station,coordinated perk/gear loadouts,etc.
---
Can't really blame killers for nope'ing out on that nonsense. They are human want to have fun too.
---
Getting shit on and then trash talked by a bunch of dudes who have an over inflated sense of skill because they can 4v1 a killer is not fun.
---
have you read all i wrote? please disagree, but what you said makes me think you only read the first few lines.
---
You gain a x2 bonus to your deviousness multiplier.
---
It's still really good
---
This feels personal
---
Matchmaking needs to change on every platform tho.
---
So, as a killer main I have no problem with flashlights or insta-heals... Not entirely. The flashlight honestly hurts my eyes a lot. But if the survivor does something like pallet stun and blind I just go "ok" and camp them.
---
If I'm having a bad day of survivors, I slap on an iri head and a military belt as Huntress.
---
I don't care about insta-heals, if anything maps annoy me more.
---
I want to unlock Franklin's at some point, but I'm being lazy.
---
I have no problem with the "toxicity" of survivors... Cause there's enough shit in there for me to be toxic back. The -only- thing I hate is if someone doesn't own their toxicity.
---
Depends on who they're playing as. If they're playing as low tier killers I can't fully blame them. But if they're playing as Billy, Nurse, or Spirit I don't really have much sympathy for them
---
0/10 he still has all of his organs
---
BING BONG
---
Standby for titanfall we got legion, ion, tone, ronin, scorch, monarch, and northstar.
---
U can‚Äôt crossplay consoles and pc buddy.
---
‚ÄúWhen did legion become so ta- oh shIT‚Äù
---
My thing is that I'm fine *being* toxic. I just want to know when my opponent's are gonna be toxic. Bc if they are, then I most certainly will be. If they aren't, then I'm not gonna be that guy.
---
Word
---
Implying almost all survivors wouldn't dodge if they could see they were playing an omega blink nurse or a payer beads spirit with an ebony mori, and they also weren't allowed to swf.
---
Idk much about the female clothing since I play as a male. But I managed to dress mine as Quentin. 
---
The denim jacket is good but get the blue JC Jacket in Leather Jackets.
---
For shoes,get the navy high tops
---
The pants are alright but I recommend using a pair of light skinny jeans.
---
A greyer/dark blue shirt is good but I like the usage of that DJ shirt!
---
Good job, I was so happy when I got it m, and then realized I played 20 games and still haven‚Äôt ranked up to 7
---
I don‚Äôt see any posts in your history, unless it‚Äôs past 2 years ago then I‚Äôm not looking that far into your archive lol, do you have a link?
---
*entities sake
---
ONLY IN THE SAW MOVIES THO BECAUSE IN DBD IT IS A REAL ROTTING PIG HEAD!
---
REVERSE CARD MOTHERFUCKER
---
Nope.
---
You're fine.
---
They made the mistake of trying to rush the only killer in the game that can instanly down multiple survivors.
---
Ignore the survivor salt,and the survivors rulebook for killers. Survivors are salty all the time because they evidently think they should always escape amd the KILLER should never actually kill anyone.
---
They are very cute, I agree.
---
I had a survivor try to use the DS locker move today. I placed a trap in front of the locker and left
---
No it's the power role because.....
---
When the killer has downed you, what happens to you is pretty much up to them. They could ruin your entire game which is why survivors are way more likely to complain than a killer.
---
Survivors are literally the killer's bitch
---
That's not way different, I think either your reading comprehension is abysmally bad or you're just back tracking now that you got exposed. Either way, I'm glad you finally admitted to only beating bad survivors because Wraith is garbage. :)
---
Enough!
---
8/10 I didn't see that man get cannibalized but good effort overall.
---
Aw man the last one was friendly, he didn‚Äôt stand much of a chance could have farmer with him so it wasn‚Äôt a complete loss for both of you
---
Not from BHVR
---
Authentic, can you get a gardening glove on and stab something then tell us how long it lasts before it breaks. I always figured something that was taped with compass needles would just break once it was used.
---
Are you from the future?
---
Didn‚Äôt get any BP for the game, lost my offering and lost my add ons
---
I know, I did, that's why I posted it
---
I played since launch but you just seem like the best player in the world if you can consistently run the killer every game to counter camping. Sometimes billy one hits you before you can even get to a loop, or anyone with a one hit ability. Unless you hug a loop spot until you‚Äôre found but in that case that cuts into time gens could be done. I have watch angrypug do leatherface in high ranks, like high ranks mean anything to a certain point, they don‚Äôt, nonstop camping and maybe 1/20 games he does it his LF camping doesn‚Äôt work. You are honestly so full of yourself and anyone who goes ‚ÄúI can 100% loop a killer every match‚Äù is either full of bullshit or you waste time and hug loops until the killer finds you. Lol trash
---
sort of. another commenter figured it out
---
Science is not an escape
---
You should definitely pay attention to the shrine, every week go on reddit and look for the comments on the shrine post. Sinse your new you'll know what to get when you look in the comments. Also if the shrines are never really good just save up until you can buy a character. Spirit is very good but if your looking to have fun I'd buy legion. Spirit is fun too but I find legion more fun.
---
dingdingdingdingdingdingdingdingdingdingdingdingdingdingding
---
That's the mentality of people who expect to always win and can't rise to the challenge, when the majority of times, the killer is running an OP build.
---
Depends on the SWF group. Some are a bunch of sweaty DBD players who have practiced their routine in and out. 
---
Others are maybe one good dedicated player and a few potatos.
---
If its the first then probably not as they are effectively going to be the toughest opponents that only nurses and spirits challenge. 
---
If its the other then yeah sure. Whatever will probably work if played well.
---
That's still stupid as hell and doesn't make sense. Theoretically you _should_ be right, but you're not at all. Survivors can be picked up off the ground, saved off the hook, they can crawl out the gate/hatch, etc.
---
If the killer camps the survivors can get gens done and leave. If it's not Leatherface the survivors can easily rescue their friend with a little coordination.
---
I ran into his posts too. About 3 times.
---
I will shit on it all day. Bothered you enough to voice your dumb opinion at me though. Haha :)
---
Just happened to me
---
Just wanted to move on to another match..  People dont care to watch me farm they just want blood lol
---
I‚Äôd say so, he‚Äôs good at manipulating his stain in chase. Insta downs are obviously useful. It depends on the perks! And how well you can apply map pressure:)
---
I think at this point removing tiers would just be overall more beneficial because you're rarely going to get games now where there isn't a huge perk disparity between newer/casual and longtime/veteran players.   At least then even if you get shitty perks while leveling up as a newbie you'll still be able to get the full oomph out of them.
---
Memes like this always have a hidden Myers face Boi it I can‚Äôt find him
---
I'd have to just lay down and cry thinking of all the good times
---
Lol your comment wasn‚Äôt positive at all it was filled with passive bs. Every and any idiot pulls that bs.
---
ü§°ü§°
---
I tried an Insidious Basement Build Legion once and I won almost immediately and I didn‚Äôt even use the Mori I brought. I got so much after game hate. I deserved it but how are you supposed to viably use insidious if not to trick survivors when you know they are coming for the friend and are right around the corner?
---
I made this last night, posted it but it got deleted cause I didn't flare it so I posted it again today
---
get out.
---
CmonBruh
---
Really depends on the time of the day you play. I get pretty fast lobbies as killer at rank 4 during the evening, but the time increases drastically during the night (which should be obvious).
---
Submit it to behavior right now
---
End game Freddy. I love Pig as well but I also feel your pain when it comes to the tea bags. Blood warden + NOED is just the most satisfying thing I've ever experienced in my entire time playing DBD.
---
I promise you 100% that was not my intention at all. Why would I be rude about what you think? I've already stated in previous comments I completely understand where you're coming from so why would I all of a sudden be rude to you? I'm sorry you saw it that way cos I can assure you that wasn't how it should of been portrayed.
---
Feng Min found the escape
---
That's just gonna confuse me the next time I watch Gladiator lol
---
They're not dodging me, I'm sure of that. I rarely escape and never BM etc. It may be my fellow survivors of course.
---
No, this is completely incorrect testing then. Let's take a look at 3 trap examples. 
---
1) Trapping randomly across the map, 6+ meters away from any given loop/window: When a survivor triggers this trap, and the hag immediately teleports, the hag will always get a hit. The hag simply has to walk in the proper direction, and combined with the lunge this will always hit. 
---
2) Trapping a loop right outside of pallet stun range. This could be the example you are talking about. In this scenario, the Hag needs to force the loop so her body is on one side of the pallet and trap is on the opposite side. This creates an RPS that is heavily in Hag's favor, as 2/3 of her options win against each of the 3 survivors options. This will always require the correct read from the survivor. 
---
3) Trapping a loop at the conjunction point: This is what I think you are mainly talking about. The problem with trapping at the connjunction point is if the loop is long, the survivor will always get hit, however, if the loop is short, the survivor will always get away. (If run optimally by both sides) 
---
If you would elaborate more, I think I could give a much more clear answer, however, with what you've stated, it is simply incorrect and unclear.
---
most sense i have heard all day.  This game is held captive by killers with no backbone and not realising its only a game
---
No.
---
Upvoted for the salt, I got called a camper too when grabbing a survivor who went for the save as I hooked his teammate
---
Sorry, when has a survivor ever stopped a killer from playing the game because they didn't like how the killer loaded into the lobby for instance?
---
PS4 matchmaking is awful, man. I just want to play some games and I can't because the killers dodge. I'm. A. Solo. Survivor. Not in a SWF. I wouldn't mind the dodging if matchmaking was quick enough to put me in another lobby, but as it is right now fuck that.
---
F
---
The thing about this is that the nurse will only fall for it 1 or 2 times and after position their blinks so that if you run into them they get a hit on you and you try to again and you die. If you are able to do that the whole game your playing against a trash nurse.
---
You‚Äôre a goddamn hero. That‚Äôs all there is to it
---
Entity unentertained
---
It's pretty funny when people who can't count to 5 try it and get pulled out of the locker.
---
THIS IS SO FUNNY
---
As long as it doesn't effect the quality of the six pack
---
So he calls you a camper again after you pointed out that it was his teams fault?
---
Error Logic Not Found
---
It's why I hate urban invasion. When I'm on the hook and the killer is off chasing somebody, with somebody a couple meters away from me. It takes them over 30 seconds to a minute to get me. By that time, the guy getting chased thinks no 1 is coming for me, brings the killer my way, or the guy nearby is way too slow and timid to move, and watches me die as he creeps to me. I hate that perk... it's cool. But wastes so much time on top of that.
---
It‚Äôs treason then..
---
But.....I don't see bing bong's bing bong.....*Hyperventilation intensifies*
---
Huntress mains: DOWNVOTE DOWNVOTE DOWNVOTE
---
I don‚Äôt think he knows but that‚Äôs okay
---
Prestige 3 times and sacrifice 100 virgins
---
Read the description on her outfits, skip turn, uno, reverse card, I win
---
So far she‚Äôs my favourite killer.  run ruin, corrupt intervention, thrilling tremors, and then whatever else you see fit. In my experience it‚Äôs worked well.

Basically end game Freddy is where you let survivors stomp all over you (metaphorically, you should still be playing normally just with more focus on survivors and less focus on generators) and at the very end of the game, gain stupid amounts of power and steal the win from them. This was Freddy's intended method of play, given his perks, his description, and the way the movies played out. His teachables are fantastic starters but you absolutely need to get NOED (Hex: No One Escapes Death) with Blood Warsen. There is no "special" strategy besides a. Hit your obsession and get remember me to 4 tokens and b. Make sure the exit gates are open before you hook a survivor in end game, since that's the only way it activates. Survivors tend to linger after the game is over and blood warden also outlines survivors at the exit gate so once you hook a survivor you will know if they are trying to leave. Personally I love this build because I really hate the feeling of getting no kills and I especially hate when survivors run me around for a whole game. The build pretty much is a direct counter to a gen rush and i don't think I've ever gotten anything other than 4k's using it. I love Freddy as a killer but if you don't want to use him you can absolutely put them on another killer. I've gotten 3 merciless' in a row with him and maybe that's not uncommon for most people but for me it was the first build that ever really clicked for me. If you're wondering the perks I run, they're Ruin, Remember Me, Blood Warden, and NOED. Ruin can be swapped out with any other anti-gen perk but I find it's perfect when only going for survivors.
---
according to gamepedia the teacher's files were added into the game but never used to fuel speculations
---
Indeed...
---
People dislike what they don't like, but it's more likely just saturation of purely Legion cosplay
---
Oh the killers being nice he doesn't want to tunn.. oh god no.
---
Finally an appropriate use for your vomit....*Do it again*
---
Anyone with a survivor cosplay would disconnect and vanish
---
Stop running self care. It is a crutch. It‚Äôs even more useless in Swf. If you‚Äôre worried, run Adrenaline and or Iron Will. At high ranks you see a lot of Spirits, and Iron Will is a HUGE counter for them. Self care in its current state is a time waster, and if you‚Äôre able to hold your own in a chase it‚Äôs not even needed. My current build is:
---
Adrenaline - Iron Will - Dead Hard - (Wildcard)
---
The wild card can be anything, and if you have issues with DH (because the devs are full of shit, it‚Äôs STILL broken) switch it for Balanced Landing. Remember, Balanced Landing will always have it‚Äôs passive that removes the ‚Äòstun‚Äô from landing. For my wild card I frequently switch between these: 
---
-Decisive Strike - Good for countering the tunnelers, helps insure your survival since you won‚Äôt be relying on self care. Teammates can‚Äôt always be trusted to heal you right after unhooking you, or there sometimes might not be time. For killers that like to tunnel, you can use it to prolong a chase and take aggro, and then hopefully your team can continue with Gens. That‚Äôs where adrenaline can also save your ass. 
---
-After Care - GREAT since you‚Äôre not relying on self care and just an overall great perk on pubs. This is fantastic to help coordinate with those you cannot communicate with. I‚Äôve had people tell me where hatch is with it, I‚Äôve known areas to avoid when looping so that I don‚Äôt accidentally sandbag someone. It‚Äôs honestly a great perk, and one of my favorites for pubs. It also can help warn you when a survivor in chase is coming your way. For that matter you can run Bond or Empathy too, but remember that AC has no range limit, and if you use it and at least tap heal everyone, you can then see where the entire survivor team is at all times. Aura reading is extremely beneficial.
---
- Distortion -  Also a good one at red ranks because a lot of people use BBQ and Nurses. It can also protect you from Rancor if you save a stack, help you at least at the start against a Ghostface and a Meyers. The moment you realize a Killer has BBQ, you can start saving your stacks for End Game by utilizing lockers or getting close enough for BBQ not to detect you. Can‚Äôt get to a locker or close enough? You get one more chance. But always try to save that last stack as long as possible, or at least for End Game. 
---
-Deliverance - I generally will only run this if I also have DS, and you can get screwed if you get found first a lot. But I‚Äôve pulled off great plays with this. 
---
-Quick and Quiet - Also great because the cooldown is fast and it‚Äôs not exhaustion based. Being able to fast vault a window when breaking line of sight can save your life. Not many killers run I‚Äôm All Ears, which is the only counter unless killer is a really good tracker. (And even red ranks can be bad trackers)
---
- Kindred - This is a team based one, but if you find yourself left to die on first hook a lot, this can organize the team to come save you, and let them know of a hardcore camping killer. It also can show them who to avoid when another survivor is in chase, therefor Waldo letting them know it‚Äôs safe to save you. I‚Äôll often use pointing to communicate with someone on where to go with Kindred like I do with After Care. 
---
-Borrowed Time and/or We‚Äôll Make it - these are great and can encourage teammates to help and trust you. Need to farm someone on hook because they will die if you don‚Äôt? At least give them a fighting chance. If you‚Äôre the type to heal the survivor you unhook right away, We‚Äôll Make it is a HUGE time saver. Both of these are great for Altruistic types.  
---
-Leader - Think about it. This boosts the action speed for all of your teammates that come within an 8 meter radius of you, and that effect lingers for I believe 20 seconds? That increases everything but Generator repair. So Healing is made faster for everyone but you, and that‚Äôs fine because if you‚Äôre not running self care make them heal YOU first because it‚Äôs faster. You then can afford to spend the time healing others. Faster Totem cleansing, this saves me from a killer guarding Devour and Ruin a lot. Unhooking is faster as well as opening Exit Gates. 
---
Leader may not affect you, but since it affects you team it gives them more incentive to keep you alive as long as possible. 
---
-Prove Thy Self - Like being the Generator Jocky? Run this. You get extra points when working with others (hell yeah more BP!), and this counters the coop repair debuff. Gens will get done faster and like Leader this gives your team more incentive to save you and keep you alive. 
---
That‚Äôs what I use the most right now.
---
As far as i'm aware, there's no video of Jane's voice. I've tried on youtube, and nothing comes up.
---
That terrified me oh my god
---
Engaging turbo thrusters in.. 3..2..1..FWOOOOOOOOOSH
---
You mean doctor, ghostface and the entity
---
Lol! Just go to North Korea or Russia they hook you up!
---
The little squeak at the start as she starts floating up, lmao.
---
New nurse cosmetic, you like?
---
Can I use the gun to kill myself when I get hen rushed? :0
---
There are no rules in this game, you do what you gotta to get them kills!
---
‚ÄúCLOAKING MODE ACTIVATE‚Äù
---
That's what it feels like sometimes
---
DS got changed from being a free escape attempt just for being downed to only being active for 60 seconds after being unhooked and being applied the moment you get picked up (Killer can't even move before you get a chance to do it). It's a strictly anti-tunneling perk now, and while it's useless if the Killer is playing fair..... that's a crapshoot.
---
It's still a top tier perk, it's just not as good as it used to be.
---
BBQ is still the same.
---
Adam:
---
- Deliverance is a strong, but risky perk. Being the first person hooked, or failing to get an unhook before you get hooked feels bad man.
---
- Diversion is a meme perk but can come in clutch if you use get lucky.
---
- Autodidact is great with Self-Care since you can charge it on yourself, but since it's reliant on Skill Checks you can go all game and only get one charge on it just due to randomness.
---
None are top tier, but all are pretty good.
---
Jeff:
---
- Aftercare is a worse Empathy and is completely skippable.
---
- Breakdown is pretty good for Sabotage builds, but there are other perks you should be running if you're doing that.
---
- Distortion is a great perk that can save your bacon and really confuse the Killer, as well as tell you what perks the Killer is running (Lose a token while healing in Heartbeat? That's Nurse's Calling). The fact that you only have 3 tokens, it doesn't stop perks like Surveillance, or Noise notification perks really holds it back though.
---
Distortion is great, the other two are meh.
---
Jane:
---
- Head-on is a meme perk. If it wasn't an Exhaustion perk it'd be pretty great, but it's nothing you run seriously.
---
- Solidarity is trash; if you can heal someone they can heal you, and the time you would have saved isn't worth the perk slot.
---
- Poised is pretty great for a stealth build (Lithe + Quick and Quiet + Dance with Me), but I think that you usually want Spine Chill over anything else in those builds.
---
Nothing too great, but Poised is decent enough since you don't have to complete the generators and Head-On is always hilarious.
---
Ash Williams:
---
- Mettle of Man was broken when it came out because you just needed to be hit three times, but since Protection hits are bugged to hell and back you can get 5 hits protecting someone and still not have this perk charged. Skip.
---
- Buckle Up is pretty decent at revealing the Killer, but honestly there are better perks for that and the aura intensity doesn't help that much.
---
- Flip-Flop. No, just no. If you can recover to full, you might as well have used No Mither or Unbreakable and just picked yourself up, and the odds that 50% less Wiggle Meter is going to be relevant isn't good since the odds of you being that far away from a hook, being slugged for a time, and then be picked up isn't that great.
---
Ash's perks suck.
---
Killers got a bunch of good perks though. Every single Killer that came out had at least one, usually two perks that are phenomenal at what they do.
---
I was on PC when this happend so the killer saw what they said and said if we ever encounter one another and they are on your team he'd let me leave. luckey for me I managed to get a game as killer and guess who was on the survivor team.
---
Omg guys there‚Äôs someone watching you
---
Oh yah! Koolaid man time!
---
Yes
---
Stop posting sounds you stole from u/niitoishere s posts
---
Cosplaying as baby meg. Just walk around until a killer walks up. Then you sprint burst and STILL get hurt
---
All i want to say is in my 2k hours i have never seen a Claudette give her life for me, i've seen other character do it but never the Claudia, i used to despise them but this man changed my life and perspective on Claudette players gave me hope that they are not chameleons anymore, if you're here somewhere BoycottBorderlands3, i will never forget you.
---
I went up against a huntress like this with a friend yesterday. I felt really bad for her, to be honest, but she managed a kill on my friend, who was yelling that i should have stayed in the match to help him. The thing is, I was injured as she was forcing everyone out. I didn't even feel bad either, because my friend body-blocked me earlier which resulted in me getting downed and hooked because he wanted a flashlight save due to WGLF (he didn't get it), then tried justifying that he was allowed to do that due to him saving me earlier with a firecracker.
---
Xbox_n_pc_h8_us is my user name feel free to to msg me if you like to play
---
Ok, I've been the killer in this scenario *once*, and I shall explain as to why I did what I did. Get comfy with your favorite drink and some snacc, because this is gonna be quite the story.
---
Game start, map is one of the coldwind maps, I forget which. I'm playing as piggy against a Meg, Nea, Kate, and Feng. Early game nothing special goes down, Nea being cocky, down her fast, down the Kate soon after, give her a helmet, a gen pops, usual as usual. They get another gen done,  and this is where the shit begins to go down. 
---
I down the Kate and hang her up, and she gone. Another gen pops and the Feng that was hooked was just unhooked, I mosy over cause I was close by to see if I can find anyone. I unfortunately find the feng, but I just decide to knock her down (taking countermeasure if she had DS) and look for whoever got her off. See scratches (owo wat dis?) and find the Nea, she is final hook as well so let's take her out as well. Give chase to the opposite end of the map, down her and hook her, and Nea's gone. I must mention, the Feng is still bleeding out, I go to her last location, can't find her. I give up looking for her so I go around gens. Kick one, one's still regressing from after I hooked the Nea, and the third one hasn't been touched. The gens were close but not too close so it took some time to check them all, and the Feng is *still on the ground*. And all this time, the Meg is nowhere to be found. 
---
I check gens again, none of them have been touched! The one I kicked was still sparking! I found hatch in the killer shack, I looked around it and in the lockers, nothing. I look around the gens and even crouch as I go by them, still untouched *and this Feng has only a portion of her timer left, she was at full bleedout when I found her after she was unhooked*. I give up on gens and focus on looking for this Feng because I was in disbelief at this Meg. I find the Feng in the main structure of the map, waste no time picking her up, dropping her til she wiggles off. She runs out the door to a pallet. Whatever, I let her drop it on me. We do this a couple times, and I motion at a box to get the trap off, and I go my own way to find this fucking Meg. A bit of time passesz Feng got the trap off, and I find her on a gen with the Meg. Meg takes off, not before I get a hit on her. I smack the gen and the Feng keeps on it and give chase to the Meg. I down her rather quickly, hook her and she promptly kills herself on hook. I lead the Feng to the hatch, and let her go. 
---
Endgame screen, feng says "thanks but why" I question where the Meg was, which was met with "idk, crouching around" from the Feng, and "reported, I recorded this, enjoy your ban" from the Meg *and the Kate*, who had ttv in front of her name, I just said "lol, nice bait" and left because that Meg's incompetence triggered me more than the Nea's name which was "Get Triggered" or something along those lines. 
---
And that is how I was threatened to be banned because of a selfish, useless survivor. If you made it this far, congrats, may RNG and cookies be granted in your future, have a good night :)
---
All in one, nice
---
Not me personally i talk about all killers.
---
FYI I was totally gonna stab you.
---
Where‚Äôs my bow trapper :(
---
Am I glad he's frozen in there and we're out here and that he's the sheriff and that we're frozen out here and we're in there and-- I just remembered-- we're out here. What I wanna know is where's the caveman?
---
That's what I said
---
Legit did this to myself earlier today, but the other way around.
---
Saw what I assumed was Ghostface out of the corner of my eye, suddenly another Survivor has deep wounds and Suzie is charging straight at me.
---
Someone that puts genuine effort into a cosplay nice one &lt;3
---
This taken in AZ?  Fantastic job
---
I only play Claud and I do this if they deserve it.

No but you posted stuff he had posted before.
---
She probably has a better gaming chair than you
---
and?
---
Well then he wants you dead do absolute shit and maybe I'll give you hatch
---
I suppose it does count. And I think it's safe to assume they are
---
I read the whole thing. I think terms like tunneling, camping, etc., are silly because in reality they apply to probably less than 1% of all games.
---
All PvP games on all platforms are toxic. Just how it is.
---
&gt;Ghostface
---
Son.
---
Why is that though? they sound like they'd have been a cool killer 
---
I hope in the future they try again.
---
I don't know-
---
You also get the killers saying stupid stuff like thanks for the daily, or gen rushers, even when you do all the totems so there NOED did not pop. Both sides are toxic, Play killer more? expect more toxic survivors. Play Survivor? Expect toxic killers in the end game chat. 
---
It is a sad state that it is like this but it is bound to happen with the type of game it is.
---
Yup
---
Thank you Marc. Yes the music is mine, that was what I started with. The video I found a template online and edited it to go with my music. Thank you again for your kind feedback.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Should learn about the post before being a dick straight up.
---
Bwahaha I am a survivor main. I have barely played killer and when I do play I do not camp. I do not even have BBQ unlocked. So there is that. But hey continue being salty.
---
 I  play PC/NA East and would love some friends that also share other games  with me. Built a gaming comp a couple years ago and have built a  community around people I share games with, and am looking to add to  that list.
---
I also play R6 Siege,  BO4 and some older CoD zombies  games, Elite Dangerous, Tabletop Sim,  GTA V, and a few other games over Discord.
---
DM me if interested, and I'm sure we'll get along.
---
Inappropriate it‚Äôs been a rule for awhile and I 100% stand behind the mods.
---
idk the gamepedia doesnt even say if they sure about that so maybe it didnt fit into the theme?
---
If i play against full team of teabaggers with flashlights, then i wouldn't care which one to kill, but there was only one that game. If it was about rank or points i wouldn't camp because hard facecamping throws the game. It was about justice.
---
Holy shit that needs to get fixed fast.
---
I do feel like it could be changed to where it
---
- Reset after both times you got hooked (potentially allowing you to DS twice in one game)
---
- Goes away when someone else gets hooked. You're not being tunneled if someone else got hooked.
---
But yeah, this post is right.
---
I always disconnect for a decent teammate if i find hatch Im suprised it was a claud who did it
---
For those of us who don't have a PS4, what does he do?
---
I disagree but it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt see as wide of a difference in tiers of perks anymore, which is great. It‚Äôs like we are at the halfway point between how the difference between one and three was insane and not having tiers but getting a level three variant of a perk always feels great for me and the feeling of having all T3 perks unlocked is even better but that‚Äôs all anecdotal. 
---
Removing the perk tiers cuts about 80 or so bloodwebs out which is insane tbh. I‚Äôm not saying I wouldn‚Äôt like it, lord knows I want lots more of my killers to have more items/offerings and addons but also that‚Äôs very heavy handed. 
---
Idk, I‚Äôm excited to see what they are cooking up.
---
whats the problem with that? did he created those sounds? NO.
---
We should somehow get a zombie killer in this game.
---
I thought that was proven to be a lie, or that the increase in quality is barely noticeable.
---
that's why it should be sniper instead of a gun imagine 360 a meghead with no fucking scop.
---
Assumptions. I didn't use bbq. I didn't camp or tunneled. I slaughtered every1, and still let them go....gave teams that were coordinating a hard time as well. Still showed them mercy, because I did that well.
---
I would've hit the spot their body was supposed to be in out of mild curiosity
---
Bruh, you are just straight up not going to have a good time.
---
*toxic comment*
---
Just a copy paste from the description describing what you're viewing.  
---
"  So, here's how the testing methodology works. I set a timer from the moment the Hag initializes her teleport (shown by the interaction gui on the bottom disappearing) to the moment the survivor goes into the downed state (icon).  With these tests, a survivor who know's the radius of the Hag's trap can barely trigger it and be able to run for 7-9 seconds depending on how accurate they were with their trigger. Since survivors run at 4 meters per second, that means that a survivor has the ability to run 28-36 meters to the nearest safe zone.   As you see in the third run, that chase time can be bumped drastically by perks like Dead Hard and by simple pallet throws. Hag has nothing but her traps to chase, so often she is not able to commit to a chase. A survivor is almost always guaranteed a safe getaway when knowing where the traps are located, especially if it's a swf or a player with OoO.  As for the timer, the right two digits indicate frames of a second. The video was recorded in 60fps, so there are 60 frames in a second. Divide the two digits by 60 and you get milliseconds. "
---
They played borrowed time
---
Naming and shaming is against the rules in almost every forum and everyone can have a bad day or you may be just taking some ironic words in a chat to seriously, just say gg and move on
---
Woah dude, that's not necessary and he apologized. Let's all take a chill pill here, and focus on the pain that OP's post brings us
---
So he's a DBD and a Death Garden killer. Two birds with one stone
---
That's because he's right behind you.
---
I was shocked
---
You don't need OP perks to be a killer. A good killer won't rely on good perks to win games. Most killer rely ultimately on OP builds or cheesy strats  to win, because they're not good to begin with. Now my idea is different then most people, because people like to win effortlessly.
---
Yeah, they've changed the ranking system since your break, so ranking up is harder. I would definitely just suggest running Small Game or something to learn totem spots, and run Technician to help you learn to hit great skill checks without as big of a penalty.
---
As much as I love the stealth playstyle, I have to agree with what the other person said. You really need to learn looping, as it's genuinely the best counter against killers, especially as it's the most reliable.
---
For Sprint Burst, as I don't know if you have any other Exhaustion perk, I suggest not being too frugal with it. Don't be afraid for the quick run in the beginning, and with Sprint Burst you can run around at 99 Exhaustion with practice, and then pause and run again for the speed boost. 
---
Just keep playing and watch top level players, and you'll get there.
---
Good luck!
---
Alright well, you where playing nurse, if you get better at her. You could just blink and down somone as they get off the hook, hit them off the hook, activate there borrowed time, blink then down again
---
Again, thanks for the detailed explanation!
---
His son upload to his account sometimes.... is it his son or is it Johnny?
---
I'd check but I dont want to ruin the magic of me knowing he plays Dead By Daylight
---
I want a despite to be in the game to go along with Ash
---
Wut
---
Even harder to swallow pills:
---
If it's meant to counter tunneling it should trigger only within TR since it's not the killer's fault that you run into him and got lucky there were still 3 seconds left on it
---
You're welcome, I liked the music, it sounded like it was made by netflix
---
At least they did something. I got two gens going saved someone got downed and hooked and no gens worked on during the whole time. 
---
My auras revealed everyone just kind of circling waiting to save me from a camping killer that I think I dropped one too many pallets on. 
---
Guys there is such a thing as being too altruistic.
---
Np, I'll do you a solid and do a Killer list tomorrow, but right now I need to go to bed for work in the morning.
---
There was an object of obsession, too. Moried first.
---
Heres a fun scenario I encountered today, It was end game and the gate was open. I hooked Player 1, they immediately got pulled off by Player 2, I went for P2 despite an easy down on P1 to give them a chance, I hook P2 and while I‚Äôm hooking P2,  P1 shows up and dehooks P2. I then down and pick up P1 and they DS me and they both flee to the gate, they then tea bagged and taunted me.
---
How'd you edit this? It's super good, keep up the great work
---
Lmao no to point A
---
Once the exit gates are open that's it for objectives.  No gens to patrol, no gate to interrupt a survivor at it's a wrap on patrolling.  Unfortunately this makes the hooked survivor the lone standing objective on the map as every remaining survivor will either be close enough to the exit gate to make it out OR near the hook attempting a save.  Camping literally becomes the logical move at that point.  99% of survivors myself included get this and accept it if it happens because aside from our personal feelings of entitlement what legitimate reason could I possibly provide a killer to leave my hook in that situation?  Only toxic memes of survivors complain about an end game camp.  You did absolutely nothing wrong.

I still find it weird that he has a terror-radius of 16 meters while the optical range in the game is around 40 meters. But this is what makes him creepy and I think its good
---
It is true but it‚Äôs been said it‚Äôs ‚Äúslightly‚Äù better so slight that it is very much unnoticeable so dont worry about prestiging unless you want the bloody skins
---
No stress, good night sleep tight man
---
The hook was near the opened exit and after my first hit on borrowed time she escaped.
---

I used sony vegas 14, recorded about 8 hours of gameplay, then I blacked out for 3 days and suddenly... vidbeo.

Yeah dude... it was a troll ._.
---
Maybe they could have be add ons that the killer can use during the match that stacks with their current add ons or have it so when opened they keep the ad ons to use in a later match.
---
They would take a while to open but they will always have something useful for the killer to use
---
He's not OP. He's just still new and the adjustment period to learning to play against him is gonna take time. 
---
I have no issue with him as a killer or Survivior player
---
One last thing. Does technician prevent an explosion if my teamates blew it up? Or does it only work for me
---
I play xbox and have a blast, I usually only run into a few toxic players now and then. I dont send people messages ever though unless I'm thanking them or applauding them for being a good sport or a fun adversary. It's not as bad as the mw2 days or other 360 era competitive games. Also if someone was angry enough at you  to send a message over xbox live which is annoying to type one simply because you're better than them, then you should take it as a compliment because you've earned it.
---
No he‚Äôs not
---
And now I see why you posted it twice. You done got punked good sir as this doesnt look like it was removed.
---
Steam offers a voice chat if I remember correctly. Discord is just more popular. And the party systems are built into the gaming consoles that DBD is on. 
---
Here's an idea: git gud
---
This happened to me, I walked off the edge and just appeared back in the world as well. It was the worst. Even went back to try and escape only to get sacrificed on the fog.
---
His name is Ghosty-goo
---
smh
---
i‚Äôve been seeing it all over reddit - something‚Äôs up
---
How bout don‚Äôt get killer after winning as survivor or as killer. As it‚Äôs just a game
---
Dream pallets can be annoying but he's not too hard to deal with
---
Its a new technique sir.
---
Slicing ham has nothing to do with this
---
Cool beans, I was pretty used to his old ability and thought that his new mechanics were a lot trickier to master
---
No man. Quit throwing terms like ‚ÄúOP‚Äùaround. He‚Äôs in a good spot.
---
brb cleansing thanataphobia
---
Good to hear, was just surprised to get a 3 man DC before I‚Äôd seen my first survivor. I don‚Äôt even get that when I play Toxic Doc haha
---
Thx. Don‚Äôt want the chests blocked for the whole game
---
Ive never won against him (or ghostface) but I think theyre both balanced. Honestly unless he brings dream pallets hes essentially an M1 killer.  Those are easy to counter too for the most part, just make sure you pay attention to what's safe.  
---
  
---
As killer, Freddy is fun to play. He feels strong but not OP.  I think they did a good job.
---
Thought a Feng was a baby Feng, protected her and didnt kill her the numerous times I found her.... turned out to be a level 8. Smh
---
A good Claudette? You must be lucky because seeing a rare forested altruist Claudette is quite a rare catch especially around this time of year.

---
nu uh! they're just being nice and making sure the internet stays bully free
---
You know what, I agree.
---
I play both survivor and killer, and I'm sick of each side telling each other they've got OP items, perks, whatever. There is ridiculous shit on both sides.
---
Killer mains endlessly whine on Steam discussions about insta heals and other survivor items, yet conveniently ignore their own insta down addons and ebony moris. Laughable.
---
If they get rid of insta heals, then best believe they should get rid of something from killer side as well.
---
I always search for keys first.

It gets my ass clapped.

IIRC Nea is free, if that is the case I would get Balanced Landing. If not self-care works wonders at most ranks solo

Ohh, so that's why it sounded official

That's what SWF is for.

For me, the challenge of not being able to communicate with other platers while still working together to escape is far more rewarding.

Nice editing
---
I've been having Solos with this matchmaking today.
---
I love playing a killer here and there. I remember getting  Myers' adept achievement by bringing in an ivory and tunnelling the obsession (pre DS rework) just so I could use dying light to guarantee victory. Felt really bad for the survivor because I know what it feels like vsing someone with inherently tunnelling perks. I'm normally a softy and let a survivor go at the end of the game. I just feel that these changes reflect balance an offering should have.
---
Why not just play dying light and let Behavior keep on making a good game with decent game in house killers.
---
Thank you  [u/Th3Beggining](https://www.reddit.com/user/Th3Beggining/)  for the clip :)
---
It looks great! You‚Äôd probably have to get all mathematical and use lots of reference images/measuring to get the shape right, because it is a weird flat-oval shape that probably wouldn‚Äôt realistically be comfortable to wear on a human face. 
---
Otherwise you nailed the ‚Äúface‚Äù And bloodstains/wear-and-tear perfectly
---
Yes I have BL
---
something like r/dbdcosplay? idk
---
i can't tell if you're serious or not..
---
The female's mask looks perfect.  How'd you make it?
---
Reeeee
---
Many thanks I've actually learned alot from the build and hopefully I can apply it to future projects.
---
That feel when a guy laying on his back can catch a woman standing up in 2 steps.  Real life.
---
Oh I didn't see that my b, iron will is also pretty good
---
Yeah it is  how come I had a game where the killers bbq didn't activate when I cleansed a hex and he didn't even hook us
---
The one thing about daddy Myers versus legion cosplay is you cant DIY micheal's mask. And nice ones cost a pretty penny
---
You should've named yourself "trash-entity" instead
---
Susie's Mask: http://aminoapps.com/p/aq5gq2
---
Imagine it without the body piece and only the mask
---
&gt;because I don‚Äôt see as wide of a difference in tiers of perks anymore, which is great.
---
Then what's the point of having them? If the differences are minor enough to not effect the use of most perks, then there's no point to keep the different tiers
---
I find myself in agreement with the idea for the ebony, but I think the ivory is fine as is imo
---
This is the content I like to see
---
what a good joke
---
Steam may offer a voice chat, but that doesn't mean this game was designed with voice comms in mind. Steam =/= BHVR.
---
People freak out over 5000 points lmfaoo
---
You‚Äôre going to jail.
---
Weird that they switched it
---
So why not keep it PC exclusive since party chats are built into PlayStations and Xboxes
---
Can't it be both?

Yes, from now on I will. I could have had already 3 or more clips by now if it wasnt so much effort to report this behaviour.

I was told the first one was taken down...so I posted without the swear words. Then I was told that I could flair it, so I did both. Then both are active. I dunno, I'm new at this reddit post creation malarkey. Apologies for being a reddit noob.

Can be another player's internet speed/distance from the killer as well.
---
You son of a bitch
---
The hatch has nothing to do with rewards. Escaping also has nothing to do with rewards!  
---
Cause escaping just gives you 5k bloodpoints and if you dont do other shit you still might not pip!
---
Can you be a bit more constructive with your response please?   
---
Thanks

---
The entire point of Reddit is to upvote content you want to see and downvote content you don't. If you don't like Legion cosplays, downvote them. If they keep getting to hot, plenty of people in this subreddit apparently do want to see them. 
---
I get that for some people seeing similar memes and circlejerks gets annoying. It annoys me too. But I would rather have that than a bunch of mods hyper-curating our content with arbitrary rules because one apparent minority of people who don't like to see certain things. I'm not sure why the rest of the subreddit should be required to conform to the preferences of a select group of people. 
---
Use the arrows and create the kind of content you want to see.
---
I'm a survivor main, so I can't deny I wouldn't mind being an immersed Claud with even more stealth potential
---
No he's not. In fact he's much easier to play against now that you can see him. I don't know how the community feels about the reboot, but I love it. 
---
He was my killer main, and I had no problems with him. Looking forward to playing him with his changes.
---
Pls make more so I can torture my friends
---
Don‚Äôt put any.
---
Icons have little to no chance of banning because both Behavior and EAC have said that it is not a bankable offence, but if for some reason EAC sees it as tampering with game files neither side will unban you.
---
For skins I have no clue, but it is probably not allowed
---
Omg, with Claud using that ability, it would be like using guerrilla warfare against the killer...
---
Now that ironic shitposting is a meme, we all just look stupid and everyone loses.

---
I like your name !
---
But then people won't send me messages wondering what kind of drugs i'm on :(
---
Truthfully don't get how people can set the bar so low
---
This is the part where the killer stands there watching for 60 seconds
---
BHVR needs to change few things.
---
1. Killers shouldn't see survivor names.
---
On PS4 in red ranks, I basically play against same 5-10 killers, so if you give them a hard time one match, they are either bringing Mori next match, or just dodging you again and again, because red rank killer wants easy matches...
---
2. Killers should see default clothes 
---
So many killers dodge, because they don't like your cosmetics. Seriously. On this same subreddit it was the answer I was given, cosmetics make people scared.
---
3. All 4 people should join at the same time, always
---
BHVR said they will do it, all 4 people joining together, but for some reason they abandoned this idea, dunno why?
---
4. Killers shouldn't see items we bring
---
It's the biggest reason most people dodge, items. Oh, someone brought a toolbox, how will the killer ever win, who plays as p3 spirit....
---
In general killer shouldn't have much info on survivors, as survivors don't about killer. Dunno why BHVR done this game this way, maybe it needed to be this way when the game was super survivors sided, now it's more killer sided, so they should at least get few "nerfs".
---
This person has
---
A S C E N D E D
---
prestige!
---
I‚Äôm still in the edge, I came here to figure out what it does before I Prestige.
---
Still waiting for balanced hitboxes
---
Right, But who would do objectives if you can just find the hatch before the last man stand, and leave the other player behind to finish what you couldn't do. 
---
Escaping shouldn't be facilitated, it should be a last resort, like it is. Also camping the hatch just let's the killer find it easier, he'll do everything to stop u.
---
I'd rather have multiple chases and chances for me to get more points... If I end up 4king everyone on 1 hook I get nothing from the game.
---
Then use you deliverance to jump-oh wait you still can‚Äôt use deliverance when you the last survivor
---
Can‚Äôt if your the last person
---
Well Dauntless is a strictly PVE game (right now) so it doesn't matter what platform you are on.
---
I don't, I own my toxicity when I do it.
---
But 9/10 times I can tell the difference between a player doing something and a player doing nothing - mostly because I run whispers and BBQ and Chili and pay attention to who I hook.
---
Also, the fact you think survivor isn't a team based game is hilarious to me... Considering there are categories dedicated to teamwork.

Pretty good JOB so far

If someone says something as idiotic as "that cosplay isnt as hard as a COMMISSIONED cosplay for a tv show that my friend did, anyone can make it" im 100% gonna post it in a subreddit about such idiocy, specially since its not even his work, its the work of his alleged friend.
---
And yeah, its easy to make a legion cosplay, who the fuck cares if its easier to make than a huntress cosplay, all Dwight cosplays deserve hate cause its glasses and a white shirt? 
---
Anyone can make that in actually 5 minutes, not weapon, not even a mask needed, but why would anyone complain? That's not the popular thing to shit on right now, it doesnt give free karma.
---
Does it?
---
This is cool, but as a mostly solo player I'll say that playing against hag usually means my teammates are my worst enemies.  
---
They never seem to understand that all you have to do is crouch and the Hag basically loses all her power.
---
I feel the same way.
---
Nah, I'm waiting for Feng one is SUPER CUTE AND COOL
---
Spine chill saved my life it‚Äôs a great counter to wraith because as soon as it lit on I hid in the locker it also saved me on the gate door one second later and the wraith would have picked me up.
---
I'm a killer main and I'm grateful for the new DS. Sometimes shit is hectic and I have no idea which survivor is the one that just got off the hook. Then I get D striked and I fuck off to look for the other one I wanted.
---
I agree. The backpack especially is really awesome. I'll be grabbing that skin too
---
So trueeee, can't wait
---
Money, most likely. They want money, and selling on more platforms allows them to make even more money than they would selling on just one.
---
And that's why they call you bloody meg &gt;_&lt;
---
So rather play 20 minute game and get 30000 points, than play 5 minute game and get 23000-25000 points. Sounds good to me.
---
I‚Äôd be funny if he was full blown caveman the whole time until the mori where he pulls out a gun. Lol
---
No one ever harassed me until I put on the mask...wait a minute
---
If you're game is going 20 minutes something's wrong.
---
But honestly - I'd rather have a fun match that runs long than a short boring match. BP doesn't matter to me over much.
---
My psn is croissantlord if ya wanna add me
---
Yeah, all that other stuff about the game really takes away from all the fantastic recycled memes that comprise the other 87% of the sub.

this hasnt been an issue before..... like it isnt hard to just follow people on most maps its just something with suffocation pit that is just a labyrinth and the distance between generstors seems so far away and the pallets just waste my time because they loop and then i essentially have to get stunned because they will just continue to loop until the pallet is down and they won't throw the pallet down if i respect it until and then when i hit them they get their stupid speed boost to just go to another pallet and do the same thing....like that process can take minutes and its not like any amount of skill can prevent that besides getting a lucky hit through a pallet, i don't have whatever perk lessens stun time maybe i should invest in that or some easy broken killers
---
It wasn't that serious.
---
PS4
---
Waiting for over an hour in the lobby with survive with friends after everyone had already pressed the ready button. We all restarted the game and the console amd still nothing worked everytime we went back to surviving with friends.It never found us a match. Is there a match making bug or something?. I really love this game. Would be nice to know why this happend.
---
If the killer and I had some funny moments together or if they really got their ass kicked, I leave them a present as a gesture of respect. If the killer isn't even at the gate, I like to give other survivors whatever I found. Except if I'm playing Quentin, then it comes with me to my treasure hoard.
---
Well you‚Äôre either a liar or you hug loops and waste time and are lying about that so either way you cut it.
---
Oh, okay! I figured it was that kind of thing, thank you!
---
No, the upvote and downvote are to promote relevant topics, while hiding irrelevant topics to that subreddit. I swear, nobody here knows what the role of upvotes and downvotes are anymore.
---
this is VERY epic
---
and even if im far from the pallet when they throw it I'll get stunned anyways
---
And yeah it‚Äôs the internet. A lot of people lie. You‚Äôre basically going ‚ÄúI play perfect and I don‚Äôt need swf to beat camping‚Äù lol flat out ridiculous.
---
Oh come on don't start strawmanning my words because they dont corelate with your opinion.  
---
Anyway I never said I think it's not a team based game it's was the DEVS said! Read carefully!  
---
Team based is also SWF.
---
In random matchmaking everything is possible.
---

---
No problem :)
---
Legend says he was 1 pip away from Rank 2
---
dream pallets are actually really stupid now that i think about it because they rarely ever help in a chase while the snares they barely have to graze to activate
---
It‚Äôs a once a game perk that can only be used if you get tunneled, plus it‚Äôs not guaranteed due to the skill check. It doesn‚Äôt need a nerf.

Fair doesnt equal balanced
---
Sometimes you have to as the hooks could already be used.
---
I know it's just a meme, but pipping in this game is dirt easy.
---
Jesus dude iif all you're going to do is accuse me of lying I'm done with you, waste of my time to continue if you have nothing of substance to offer.  I think the fact you are astonished at players that can loop is hilarious but sad at the same time given the playtime you claim to have in this game.  You'd think you would have picked up looping yourself during that time.  I guess not.  Anyways best of luck accusing everyone you disagree with on reddit of being liars.  You have a long day ahead of you I'm sure.  I'll let you get to it guy.
---
A selfless Blendette? No that can‚Äôt be true! That‚Äôs impossible!
---
Honestly, how many times do we need to see the same old posts about imbalanced matchmaking. We all already know about it. 
---
Besides sometimes it's SWF. And honestly I'd take it how it is over waiting forever to find people of the same rank as long as the games are starting fast.
---
Another funny (to killer only probably) meme build with wraith is fast disappear and bone clapper.
---
Never cloak but constantly 99% to ring the bell over and over. Clapper makes the bell heard at all distances IIRC ;)
---
I always think of it as a Cat leaving a dead bird on your porch (every time my cat manages to escape my house, she comes back with one,) I appreciate it because she thought of me, but I can't really do anything with it. It's a basically gift that you can't/won't touch.
---
Right i forgot it makes me move faster :( i'm sorry survivors will never use again :(
---
cosplay shaming is rood
---
Lol brilliant because they never heal i get it xD
---
I actually made a tutorial on how I made few of their masks. Definitely not a paper plate and can take some time. Not to mention that the way I made mine is just one out of several different variants I have seen cosplay make. Link to susie for reference http://aminoapps.com/p/aq5gq2
---
you better not! and while you're at it take off monstrous shrine that perk is busted. smh toxic killer mains
---
Right?  I do it all the time and honestly, I'd rather not. The only way I console myself after an awful game is that MAYBE I'll see that happy little -1.
---
I‚Äôve always thought this too. I get better evader scores when I 3 hook and don‚Äôt escape than I do when I don‚Äôt get hooked at all and escape. Instead of giving you points for **evading** you get points for running around with the killer. It‚Äôs dumb.
---
Something about someone else sacrificing themselves for Bill feels really incorrect.

The fan runs really loud when I play on my One X. Don‚Äôt have any issues though. I just find it strange.
---
I love using Legion in **MEND** by daylight to make survivors rage-quit. It's so funny, when they must mending for 6 minutes üòÇ
---
It is part of her power and is supposed to happen
---
I want to try balanced landing, quick and quiet, urban evasion and self care or the Jane locker perk. Build would be to sneak around the map as best as possible and be the gen jockey.
---
that is not the role of upvotes and downvotes, u/OnyxDarkKnight explained it well
---
Funny did laugh
---
Shirtless Myers should be Z class
---
Just gonna casually upvote this. As a console player this is basically true.
---
Let me inform you that on high ranks killer has his spirit fury already charged for 90% of the game without a chance to use it. There being more pallets to charge it changes jack shit
---
nah thats a pretty good strat
---
This brought a "tier" to your eyes.
---
Honestly Im suprised the wraith didnt hear you get in the locker.  That couldve been a lot uglier for everyone
---
Still feel bad
---
Ok thank you for the reply!
---
As a survivor main I'd be so stressed out and confused lol
---
Basically super zombie that can parlour and spit acid if needed
---
Honestly, just depip the shit out of me, put me back at rank 20. Ranking up is such a nightmare.
---
Yep have to agree, if I see ghostface or pig i know its gonna be over quick.
---
Why would you camp the hatch and let a teammate die? Go play a single player game if you don‚Äôt wanna play a team based game.
---
All the hate from my comments pushed this up lmao you are welcome. I said it wouldn't happen and the community took that Hex-Bait. Mission accomplished.
---
No problem :-)
---
I'm getting downvoted for speaking the facts. Keep it up, guys.
---
Spirit Fury Enduring is such a waste of perk slots on Legion...
---
Probably more expensive and harder to do accurately though. Hairless William Shatner mold, brown with tuft, fit overalls and work boots are not "Easy" or cheap cosplay materials. Legion has a LOT more Lee way given the source material and the fact that the most iconic part is the mask and not say the Spartan jacket with camo pants. 
---
Of course a Legion cosplay done right is hard but even Michael ain't easy despite how it looks. I would much rather do a Legion one as the only part you really have to make us the mask then throw on a grey hoodie, blue jeans and you are set for the most part.
---
Yeah the survivor scores of your bottom two are awful.  They basically tell us they either killed themselves on their first hooks OR they were tunneled off the map mercilessly possibly camped as well.  Which was it I'm curious?
---
BABA BA BAAAA
---
Shirtless Myers is a must.
---
In reality this seems like a good idea. I'm afraid and practice the player base is not big enough to allow this to happen üò•
---
I‚Äôm impressed with the Claudette giving hatch up, I just wanna know why she wants to boycott bl3.
---
yeah that's a good point.  Another thing that messes me up is when they get to stage 2 on first hook and accidentally kill them :/  
---
I couldnt imagine doing it without bbq though.  The double bp is too much for me to resist, haha.
---
Shirtless Myers and GF and legion these 3 holy breeds can fuck me anytime
---
That's Michael showing Chucky how to get them to a hook.
---
God this is too good. Sure better than anything that‚Äôll be official. I don‚Äôt see much topping this.
---
....Then they hooked me and camped me
---
That isn't what the post is about
---
I'm gay for this.
---
I use empathy, which at max ranges 126 or so meters so if someone gets whacked you‚Äôll know where they are. Self care because it‚Äôs useful and saves time. Spine chill so I know if the killer is coming for me and then Calm Spirit so you don‚Äôt scream and birds don‚Äôt go off when you pass by.
---
I didn't expect it to be real.
---
This game is proof that you can‚Äôt trust anyone but yourself. 
---
I don‚Äôt save people unless i can guarantee my own safety or wait after opening the gate anymore bc of this.
---
Can't wait for a Fortnite skin for the Legion kek
---
I agree there should be a BP bonus so there's less incentive to dodge. Toxicity I've dealt with has broke the camel's back and I've tended to start dodging if I see what looks like a bully squad. (Bright clothing, flashlights, 4-man, guy with .TV in their name. etc.) Maybe if there was a bonus people wouldn't dodge so much. 
---
Effectively another double bloodpoints for putting up with a 4-man would probably be enough.
---
Why does your comment only have 2 points?
---
Classic
---
This is a lie. You left out Nea
---
Yeah NOED would have ended me there.
---
Ah yea, the REAL gender
---
Nah you're good mate. SWF group was just salty they all died when they had the upper hand most of the game  
---
Ignore em, it's just toxicity you won't need
---
If you do prestige, wait until you have another character up to at least 25 I‚Äôd recommend so you‚Äôre not caught out at lower ranks with no viable builds...
---
Tier C for lemme C what that big boy is packing üí¶üí¶üí¶
---
That honestly sounds like a buff. 2 decisive strikes, 4 players = 8 stabs. It‚Äôd be pure cancer.
---
You provoked him, you may not be trash but you are a dick
---
Meanwhile I'm appreciating the boob jiggle animation of Jane.
---
What are you talking about?  I‚Äôve been maining this killer for damn near a year!
---
My friend is a self sacrificing Claudette, but only cause that‚Äôs who he has the most perks on. Otherwise he‚Äôd be a self sacrificing Ash
---
You're a dick for messaging someone to trash talk.
---
Their a fool for expecting the killer to not kill them.
---
ohm
---
Was messaging him needed?
---
Hag and spirit are already naked so...
---
I use Decisive Strike, Flip Flop, Tenacity and Unbreakable (got this build from zubatlel)
---
Or Quick and Quiet, Head on, Decisive Strike/WGLF, Adrenaline. 
---
Honestly I just play for fun so these two are my go to build to have a great time.
---
r/whoosh
---
Lol you message him and come here looking for is to back you up?
---
To combat trigen plays it would obviously have a CD for the object he locks such as a minute and a half before he can relock an object. I think honestly instead of 6 locks 4 locks would be better and more fair with add-ons adding to 6 possibly. Obviously if he can lock gates they would have to be able to be lockable before the they are powered. Not to mention they need decay and I mean NEED decay at least on gennys if locked trigens happen it would be very difficult.
---
Agree with some of the others the music was a bit overwhelming maybe lower the volume of that or get rid of entirely, but the memes were on point like when you had the bill nye ‚Äúbill,bill,bill‚Äù playing that got me good lmao
---
Gone against a four man with four full instaheals. Hooked only three people and they used all the medkit. Everyone escaped and I deranked. That's how stupid is swf. Also their timing on adrenaline was perfect so gg.
---
It's just silly. 90% of people just cosplay legion because it's a mask and a hoody. I never see other killers. Some variety would be nice that's all
---
I mean i like de mens so every guy APART FROM BUBBA can get it üòÇ
---
I do love the concept of the lock on the hooks though ;p
---
Happened as soon as the game ended
---
With the caveat that hooking another ends the DS tomer, by swapping puts it at zero stabs. Overall buff and It'd definitely flip tunnelling on its head. Would encourage slugging to a degree, but at least it'd expand counterplays a bit.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Calm down spirit
---
he dc'd at 1 one gen completed
---
don't feel bad lmao
---
Spine chills, balanced landing, decisive strike and adrenaline. Bring a medkit or play with a friend. If you're going solo/without medkit self care, bond, spine chills and balanced landing/dead hard.
---
Its the weekend the toxicity always ratchets up to another gear. My theory is its all the kiddies who technically aren't even old enough to buy the game come out to play. This would fit because they clearly just threw any old accusation at you. It used to be that a kiler could stand at the top of the basement stairs in the doorway so no survivors in the basement could escape but I believe they changed it so you can always slip past, plus the endgame has been added again so this can't happen as sometimes killers would take the game hostage for ages.   
---
SWF teams biggest weakness is their altruism. Its their own stupid fault for going into the basement when the gates are open and your a Bubba. Their is no reason your leaving that hook because everyone knows if you do they get the unhook and potentially your denied a kill and the fact is your Bubba the best killer to down everyone on a risky hook save.
---
I had a player named baby meg, had 4 different teachable perks. Sometime matchmaking messes up, but you cant rely on people not being terrible. ):
---
i'm crying in the club rn
---
Thank you so much for the constructive feedback, I‚Äôll definitely keep that in mind for my next project! (And when I go back and fix this one)
---
I‚Äôm glad you liked the memes, I was going to put more in but I was worried that would ruin the video. I‚Äôll have to add more now! I think they were a bit quiet though, or did you hear them ok?
---
If you start the conversation by being an asshole you can't complain about an asshole response
---
I‚Äôm honored :0! Thank you!!!
---
I don‚Äôt like being a red rank for this reason. It‚Äôs so humiliating to die first, even if you played as best as you could.
---
Shitty survivor1: "I think the killer has no ed"
---
FULLON-FRIENDSHIP: "NO HE DOESNT, WE ALREADY GOT 3 OF HIS 2 OF HIS HEX PERKS AND WE KNOW HES RUNNING THRILLING TREMOR AND BAMBOOZLE
---
Shitty survivor2: "lul bye"
---
Shitty survivor3: "Thanks for the free points nerd
---
I mean Micheal may be easy also but Ghostfaces coat isn't something you can just buy like the others(at least I think but the other coats for his cosmetics for sure aren't so my point still stands) so at least making one of the coats is difficult especially his unknown assailant coat or just the regular one.
---
thoughts?

The quitters were 18-20 üòÇ

How curious: I was literally reading some paragraphs about Ancient Rome some hours ago.
---
To the upside down

You can dump shards into the shrine for BP if you already have the teachable. So IMO Shards &gt; BP.

it is the only thing that I'm getting it for.

BBQ *promotes* an anti-camping playstyle by granting you vision outside the hook. It also promotes anti-tunnelling, because to get all four stacks, you need to switch targets. Furthermore, there are many counters to it - hide in a locker, run one way and then back, run Distortion, hide behind a gen, get within 40 metres. It has plenty of counterplay.
---
And yet, you still complain. This is the perk that most encourages a fun playstyle for survivors. Still, you want it nerfed.
---
Get good.
---
Entity disentertained...
---
I'll see my self out
---
In the movies Freddy can stretch out his arms really long, so the devs did a perfect recreation and it‚Äôs totally intentional design.
---
Bruh you can use DS multiple times per match
---
Nick didn‚Äôt actually play Him in the movie for more than one scene. Someone else did the stunts.
---
OoO is for doing gens and so get a general idea of where the killer is. Ds is only for tunnelers so kinda pointless if you go down. I would bring balanced landing (or if you don't like it dead hard), window of opportunity, adrenaline and bond. Yeah, I chose bond because running towards a teammate who's doing a gen isn't very clever.
---
Both are rotting corpses
---
And?
---
If it's SWF and one's running Object of Obsession, just DC on the spot.
---
the entire time i was thinking "just stop swinging"
---
anything that might deal damage
---
Promotes. Nah. People still camp/tunnel with bbq. Making the game unbalanced if you get caught slipping once. You're pretty much limited to perks, because most games have the same encounter. When the killer doesn't see the aura of 1 player, he immediately starts camping looking for that 1 guy. I've never used BBQ myself, and never needed a reason to do so. Audio Grant's a lot of detection + most players stick out. You don't need it, unless you're terrible at tracking. Why else use it?
---
Now I wonder so many things...
---
Oh man I would be in heaven if all my matches were like this
---
True. But I also love when someone complains after and I have like 10k more than the runner up. Yea sure, I did nothing.
---
Basically don‚Äôt deal damage with them. Yoinking them off stuff and hooking them should still be fine though that‚Äôs how save the best for last works.
---
sadly, people still run this shit everywhere
---
What‚Äôs your point?
---
You are all horrible. Thank you for posting.
---
For the stunts ofc but for the rest it was supposedly him
---
I say just remember them and keep a mental timer on them just in the back of your head
---
There‚Äôs a huge lack of pebble
---
Yea, it's only fair that Freddy, Michael and Leatherface get at least 2
---
They got 4k‚Äôd due to idiocy and were being salty bitches, not everyone is gonna be polite when losing, shrug it off yo
---
balance landing/dead hard, adrenaline, borrowed time and ds is the meta build so you're really close
---
**BULLYING DWIGHT IS ILLEGAL!!**  No, but in all seriousness, that's not ban worthy, you're fine.
---
At the end of the day people can do whatever they want. Other people don‚Äôt have to like it, but they may then push back and take this piss
---
Heaven ascended survivor
---
I would let Ghostface stalk and expose me anytime, if you catch my drift üòè
---
That is why dbdgonegay is superior. People don't downvoted stuff there.
---
I have seen so many gimme games thrown by us because of my dumbass random teamates self caring the entire second half of the match instead of repairing the last gen or two.  It's absurd the amount of Lightbringer emblem I have to be responsible for on top of my chases.
---
How was I supposed to know? The game just started haha.
---
I'd rather see 10 more Suzie cosplays than another noed or ruin-haunted grounds meme.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for my arm to rot off after I let plague finger my pussy
---
I run empathy, and within the first minute of a match, someone is already using it. After they finish healing, they get hit one more time, another minute goes by without completing a generator. Since you can tell whose doing what with empathy, it's easy to avoid the killer and be productive. I really just need iron will as a teachable now.
---
Was this on PS4?
---
Had a similar situation where I managed to run a Legion around for 4 gens and when I finally got hooked the other 3 left me to die
---
Forgot about that
---
Big F for this hero. There are less and less of these person.
---
No, I'm being sarcastic because there is no way to counter with prayer beads. That's a free hook for her with minimal effort and of course, there was nothing you could do and you couldn't have known. Even when you know she has prayer beads, it can be difficult to do gens because you have to be super paranoid about getting grabbed.
---
I remember when there was no-meme tuesdays and people made the mods out to be nazis for doing that, was...interesting to see and I guess that's the reason they have decided to be hands off.
---
\&gt;Claudette sacrifices herself instead of Bill.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Huh, that's new.
---
Just on PC, like literally 5 minutes ago. It just made me want to stop playing for the night.
---
Not when you're using Dwight.
---
sorry bout that, just a gut feeling you were going to tbag, so we decided to be Toxic first
---
What happened on r/tf2
---
The list should be based on wether they would kill you if you tried to fuck them.
---
Seriously man. All the good games I'm in, it's the last 1 or 2 gens, where more then 5minutes go by, and nothing gets done. DbD has some very low standards for so many players running self care, and not get called out on it. (Low standards) 
---
There's always that 1 guy getting chased, enough time for 1 player to do a gen, but nope, some 1 is in the corner healing, while I'm stuck at the gen myself, wounded, with the objective in mind.
---
Hard to swallow pills: Ds is balanced but is annoying when people farm but you can't get the person because you know they probly got ds
---
It would only slow down just a little bit :D I will relay the message
---
He is chosen one :D
---
&gt;Can you please get Ranked and Devotion rewards in order? I know many people ask for it and sadly you don't respond to those like you do on other matters. I know it's difficult to have Auric as rewards but Shards(and BP) are as much important since they are a big grind like BP's to get Characters, Perks from Shrine and Cosmetics. Also we need a motive to get higher in the ranks.
---
Im guessing this stuff will mostly hit all at the same time unless some of it gets pushed back. I assume we're getting dedicated servers in the next chapter (which will probably be a couple weeks into September.) The reason the friends list feature and automatic regrouping isn't a thing yet is because they need the dedicated servers for it so it makes sense that they would drop at the same time.
---
Yikes... Like... Just yikes
---
Cute
---
Ironic...
---
That slow-mo of her running off is the best thing I've seen lol
---
thank you friend :)
---
Lmfao What an idiot xD
---
Congratulations when trying to make a killer concept you made a clown skin instead
---
Haha I looked it up for myself. Ridley Scott was inspired by a painting that he misunderstood resulting in gladiator being inaccurate about the thumbs up, thumbs down scenes of the movie.
---
The Spirit can be pretty good at getting those assholes that wait in the exit gate square
---
i'm okay with that idea, but than solo survivors in random qeue should get more BP too. Survivor should get more BP anyways, especially when having the disadvantage of random qeue ^^
---
This happened to me earlier. Guy DC'd to deny my blood warden and was called garbage by some streamers who called trash and literally filled up 10 pages of the text box with insults, "LMAO IMAGINE FARMING AT 1K HOURS SUCH TRASH" etc.
---
THIS is the reason why I run Ebony Mori's, NOED, Insta-Saw, Doctor Worldwide with a jigsaw piece, etc. and show absolutely no goddamn remorse afterward. Survivors act entitled and all run instaheals, one guy with OoO teabagging me, teabagging me at the gate, GG EZ after one guy hid in a corner all match and got hatch with a key, etc.
---
I'm perfectly fucking allowed to run whatever goddamn shit I want, including 5 blink Nurse with NOED. Franklin's hag. Iri Head Ebony Huntress, etc. Maybe it broke the camel's back but I literally don't care about the survivor's experience anymore. 
---
&gt;Who hurt you, dude?
---
The survivors from the previous match did!
---
Anyways yes toxicity is definitely a two way street. I've had shit said to me I felt like garbage for a few days afterwards. 
---
Interestingly the same match I was especially upset on I was also pig. 
---
So yes eventually toxicity corrupts people. I used to care but now when a survivor disconnects mid-mori after I used mint-rag hag to teleport back right after they were unhooked I just laugh at the fact they forfeit all their bloodpoints and move on. It's a Survivor VS Killer world out there and I'm not gonna let some shitty rulebook decide how I play anymore.
---
Mother of god I‚Äôve done this one too many times and never gotten a simple Thank You from the person that I killed myself for but I‚Äôll keep doing it anyways god dammit
---
Any SWF team starts with Bond, Kindered and a Better version of in-game Alert. 
---
You are literally playing against a team equipped with 7 perks each. There should be some sort of reward for the killer to tolerate that.
---
You can only grab people like normal, lockers too, every swing consumes a token was it a miss or not
---
Yep, that sounds like a 8 years old kid survivor main try hard but gets destroyed when the killer is halfway good. Their win rate is so low that they must be toxic to feel at least a little bit strong, but you know? That's the community. Some people take this too seriously so don't worry about that and focus on improving your gameplay and fun in overall.
---
And Four Borrowed Times
---
Most games if I do decide to farm, mostly because someone DC'd/Suicided, most people seem pleased just to have the free Bloodpoints and stress-free game. This is literally the first time I've ever been insulted/shamed for "giving up" ?
---
I'm fairly new but even then I doubt that's a common behavior, right?... Right?
---
They're just whiners. You're fine it's a little messed up to camp but you did not deserve the response you got. Their decision to try a suicide mission.
---
You know for a second, I thought the brother WAS Amanda.
---
Hooks respawn now. They have for over a year...
---
When the killer panel doesn't flip but he still farms with you
---
I hate when I loop a killer for like 3 gens. Enough for all 5 honestly, but it's like my fellow survivors get too comfy and relax on the last 2. So I eventually get hit and hooked. They now gen rush and start going down on last gen. I save them repeatedly and pop last gen, get down again an they all get adrenaline and leave me, when killer is nowhere near. Standing at exit gate jumping up a down.
---
I like legion because it helps me spot the weirdos.
---
Why? Did you just copy everyone else so you can seem cool?
---
So you have a thing for the legion :wink: ?
---
They called you a Madman.
---
Just ignore the pallet they dropped and chase them down to the next loop. By the time you either give up or down them, you'll have plenty of pallets to break, and now half of the map is a deadzone for the survivors!
---
I honestly wish we had better options for reporting people. Reporting on Steam won't do anything, and the in-game Report I dont think even "works" like it's supposed to. 
---
I've had people say some seriously dark and nasty things to me when I play Killer. I understand most of their anger is probably reflection of their life, but it's still just enough to make me stop playing for the day/night.
---
Icons have like 0.0001% risk but skins I would assume do as someone I know got banned for adding exclusives to their account.
---
so true :D
---
Oh lmao so I was right hrrrmmm
---
what is the point of copying something that belongs to someone else? the source is always mentioned in these cases. if you did something that would be copied by another person without quoting you, wouldn't it annoy you?
---
Same
---
tunneling killer main joined the chat
---
Me too ;-;
---
I shall in his honor
---
Damn man I know how it feels, next time you see an SWF in a lobby bring an ebony mori.
---
That will teach those DS lovers to rush at a non camping killer after being rescued. Hook once, Mori and repeat. Also Franklin's Demise will take care of those instaheals.
---
Then don't blame it on the perk
---
Perkless
---
Why is this sub so toxic. People just dont like losing lol
---
I think so
---
Wow that's a super cool way to film a shot
---
Silent approach seems really op cos that's 2 gens with of 5 token huntress lullaby whith no terror radius or any sound queues
---
What kind of skins could they get though?   
---
They cant make up dumb ass costumes like for non-licensed killers and the ones Pig got appeared in the movies
---
You should work on that. It‚Äôs an extremely helpful tool in games. I usually get my mental timer going when I‚Äôm putting myself in the opponents shoes. It goes a bit further than that though you have to constantly think of how they‚Äôre adapting to how you‚Äôre playing. It‚Äôs kind of like playing chess with yourself.
---
100% accurate. That's what a crutch is. It facilitates everything for the player, because most players just want to win effortlessly, and become good effortlessly. If it doesn't happen, they rage quit hardcore.
---
I feel it would be better if he could ‚Äúlock‚Äù a *powered* gen and it wouldn‚Äôt count towards the gen count until the lock is removed. That way you either force them to do more gens(make it so addons for more locks don‚Äôt stack and only give him enough to make survivors forced to power all gens) and give him a decrease in points if he stays near a gen for too long as well as a decay, which could be called ‚Äúrusting‚Äù for that extra lock feel so he can‚Äôt camp one gen the whole match and just lock completed gens.
---
"Expect no mercy if you do your objective"
---
For me they both are really short now on PS4 by really short I mean like 5 - 10 mins
---
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying
---
Basically my experience with them
---
I got confused between auric cells and shards and just thought, woah 4000 seems a bit much
---
Freddy is my personal favourite. I would highly recommend him.
---
She reached a state of enlightenment, transcending the boundaries of being a survivor and becoming something...more!
---
It's a gift for being awesome!
---
Idk that bandaid sounds better than nothing. It could be a temp fix until BHRV gets their shit together and fixes the ranking system so there is a point in getting higher ranks and, therefore, more SWF groups.

As a Claudette main, im proud BoycottBorderlands3, F
---
Nah that's bullshit. If you play smart her ambush can be great, not even just for stealth hits but for crouching at loops so they can't see you is a fun mind game. Yeah her traps don't guarantee kills but it does happen sometimes and when people have traps on their head they aren't doing gens so it at least slows the game down. Too many people play pig wrong and tunnel people with traps on their heads when they should be going after people who are on gens instead.
---
You must be like.... If i had dead hard I won't be dead.. hard
---
Yes. I totally agree with the last part. If you wasted time, you should get penalized, and not be allowed to take the hatch regardless if you're last man standing. Maybe, something like a totem system, where you had to do a minimum of 2 gens, 1 unhook, and had to do at least a half gen within the last 5 minutes of the match. I think they should scrap the hatch. Forcing players to complete objectives, if they wish to win. With ranks implemented and paired with matchmaking, deadweights shouldn't move up in ranks via hatch escapes.

Fair enough, I thought Legion is still 24 Meters terror radius so I thought it could be cool having a second skiller with 24 Meters and 115% movementspeed. My bad!
---
Nice to see a claudette that isnt a particular claudette that was DoingGensYou?
---
The trouble for me is rank reset too. I've been to rank 1 as survivor, but I don't play as much so usually get to around purple ranks, reset hits and I'm back down with the chronic self care users and no matter how good I am at running the killer around teammates at those ranks always just crouch around the outside of the map too scared to do anything or, as you said, self care for the 5th time. Meanwhile they get a free hatch as long as the killer doesn't find it first . Playing super stealthy as survivor can be hard for any killer to find them, especially the Claudette's so it's such a cheap and easy way to play.
---
EZ pirate.
---
Just learn to ignore the toxicity. The one thing this community doesnt need is more toxicity. These people are looking for a reaction out of you, they feed off negativity, so just say something positive. Trust me itll kill their mood more than anything
---
I AGREE
---
I like the meme, but i dont like that serious killer ideas arent valued by this subreddit.
---
Common sense, right? I mean if I happen to come across the trapped person I'll hit them so they are injured or slug to force a teammate to come off a gen to get them but I won't seek them out or go after them over another survivor. So many do tunnel the trapped person and just get gen rushed lol

To those of you who showed up and said "happy birthday" thank you so much! It really has made my birthday much better! Thank you so much! For the rest of you I'm still streaming for a few hours if you wanna pop in!

Haha yeah. Gl and hf with whoever you decide to play

Seriously, I don't know what the developers were thinking when they made this game. Survivors should be able to see their perks among themselves to go for a strategic build that will give them a purpose to the team. Every high rank I see, is almost always running self care. The guy getting chased for 5 minutes, gets finally destroyed, and if he's lucky, 2 generators have been done.
---
Why though?
---
I don't see why nemesis couldn't be a killer, or Mr X. Slow but incredibly persistent and hard to slow down
---
that is actually megamind tho. leaving a trap buys even more times haah
---
Interacting with the Killer increases my chances of *not* surviving, which is the ultimate goal of playing Survivor. But hey, if no one is getting hurt or hooked, then you don't get Benevolence which is already affected by not getting hooked in the first place.
---

i have a huge doubt about both spirit and plague, i mean pretty sure all those hards of glass could chop ur dick off, also plague is pretty much a walking disease, u would die just by being near so yu couldnt porbably fuck her... just sayin, or u could try, at least once!!!
---
2 gens if they are really really lucky lol. Self care, urban evasion and sprint burst. The ultimate shitty survivor starter pack.
---
"you stay i go, no following"
---
Interesting to read story although the only toxic one here I see was you getting triggered because one survivor was playing stealthy and you couldn't find her.  
---
I play killer to rank1 every reset and I play this game since beta.  
---
If I read this I must think of OCD if you know what it is!?  
---
Like I couldn't care less if people hide from me. It's a natural instinct man. It's a horror game. People should be affraid and not tbag a killer.
---
I mean on the other side I see other killer complain that people are bodyblocking, tbagging and flashlightning because they dont even respect the killer anymore and then I hear stories were people get OCD outrages because someone outplayed them by just playing stealthy.  
---
If you side with one survivor to get the hands on another survivors you are breaking the rules hence he can report you. If a players is just bad or doesnt do much other than crouching he is not violating anything.  
---
I say people got a problem when their OCD meets vigilantism. Like I decided he did nothing now I do every evil possible toget back at him.  
---
I have more than 50 stories where I did the most in a match (I did most gens, most rescues and heals, most chases, totems, ect.) but when because I got the hatch or didnt rescue a potatoe both killer and the other potato sided against me. It's hilarious how emotions let people not see how out of order they react and believe actually they are in the right.

Leave Em Alone just sounds like Kindred but remove part of it and add a bit more. Night at the Pub is literally just Lithe but only works on pallets which imo sounds terrible
---
I don‚Äôt get all of the hate for Self Care lately. It‚Äôs not a crutch perk imo. You could say the same about Dead Hard, SB, Balanced, etc honestly.  I‚Äôm rank 1 on Xbox and usually find no issue completing 5 gens with my team, even if we‚Äôre all running self care. If you‚Äôre high rank and no gen progress is happening, I think the blame is on the killer whoopin ya asses or poor survivor strategy rather than self care.
---
I like that the legion is easy. Mask is all you need. It can be anything too! Just look at how Susie has a different style mask, and Joey has just a bandana.
---
It should have spawned a "Legion gang" thing, or just everyone being able to join in as legion, making it a big community.

But, we get toxic cunts putting it down. That's life.

I got invited to a party for ‚Äútunneling‚Äù when I had a lot of pressure I‚Äôd be able to hook someone right as one would get off hook, so my bbq would activate and I‚Äôd see them and get a easy knock down and then maybe slug or rehook because they were healing at the hook and the healthy one wouldn‚Äôt take a hit. That‚Äôs not my problem. I also said ‚Äúso I‚Äôm not aloud to chase the injured survivor?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúno that‚Äôs tunneling.‚Äù I laughed so hard in his face some people are just morons. I‚Äôm rank 4 on killer and 1 on survivor so I found that shit hilarious:
---
I tried doing this once, and what happened was probably my luckiest experience on the game. It was just me and a claudette, I was on last hook so naturally if one of us got hatch it should be her. I tell her to come with me to hatch, but I notice something on the ground (not sure if it was just on the ground randomly or by a hook from a dead person), and it happened to be a key. We both got out.
---
I love when people get my Star Wars references. Thank you :)
---
Self care is so bad it irritates me when people use it, never ever understood why they nerfed it. It was actually decent before the nerf like 10-11 months ago, now it's just complete ass.
---
Neither is noed.
---
It punishes you 4 not cleansing totems
---
Yeah Mr X could just tank through pallets
---
They got removed a few months back.
---
But I bet they were all running dead hard, adrenaline, borrowed time, DS etc.
---
BBQ and offerings are the devs answer, you‚Äôre welcome, your idea will never happen, bbq was literally made to incentivize playing killer and less camping, the entitlement in this post and privilege is disgusting.
---
He is Andrew character for all of us.
---
My point is, if you don't want to get hit by DS, don't go after the survivor that just got unhooked, it is assumable that they have DS and will hit you with it

Some dude looped the killer around both survivors that were hooked next to each other, so I kept doing gens because how the fuck am I gonna do that?
---
We all ended up dying, and I got yelled at by the other three.
---
The thing is, for other uses DS can be good, but for the anti-tunnel perk it should be considering the circumstances where the perk activates, it can be pretty useless considering the killer can just wait for the timer to go down, or the killer can chase you until the timer goes down
---
Pig looks so fabulous in the first picture
---
Ikr? Don't get me wrong, I ran those perks when I first started playing and when I ditched them it was such a relief and I actually got good at the game. I always tell people that being injured is okay and that getting better at loops is what wins games and you can't get good at that by being super immersed and prioritizing self caring in a corner over doing a gen or saving a teammate. Personally I make being injured work for me. Adrenaline, dead hard, iron will and resilience.

I managed to get a 3 man stalk the other day, felt nice.

You gotta switch to like the Finland store,have this link man[How to download DBD on mobile](https://youtu.be/vMWMeWTTkH8)
---
its hard for swf, when playin solo how its meant to be its pretty easy for killer to destroy everyone im already rank 7, gaining 2 pip per game its crazy
---
Survivor entitlement in a nutshell.
---
You should disable getting messages. You'll save yourself a lot of sanity.
---
"You just throw a pebble at me?"
---
I had a trapper camp me the whole game and message me after saying he‚Äôs sorry but he had to do it because we were being toxic by genrushing.
---
what the FUCK, in what world is doing the objective considered toxic.
---
You know how to switch stores man?
---
It sounds like they need to either hide better or strategize the chase better if you all are getting smacked within the first few minutes of the game.
---
Fuck yeah! The hardcore players of this community made me realize my mistakes by bashing self care. SB - was something I noticed by watching friends. Urban envasion- noticed with friends. I thought my team was capable of handling ruthless killers, but we get stomped with only 2 gens done or 0 gens over a 10-20 minute game self caring, making no progress, while our best player getting destroyed after 5 minutes, and losing hope.
---
Fair enough. Maybe they should change the wording tho too like bloodpoint max or something so it doesn't give off the illusion that all of them have been done? Idk just throwin out ideas.
---
Leave Em Alone would be a cool rework of kindred
---
Prison pocket. Also cave man hair is giant according to media that you could probably fit an extra caveman in the hair alone.
---
Thank you!! And no I don‚Äôt &gt;&lt; lol
---
Just pointing out that OP called it a crutch perk in his first paragraph.
---
I started running resilience over self care+ empathy to know who is getting chased, who is wasting time, and whose doing what.
---
Just check out the link and you‚Äôll be able to download it! Cheers man!
---
As I said, for stunts ofc they do it differently
---
The game isn't supposed to tell you if you cleansed all the totems or not. But how their wording can be confusing so I think they should at least put the two terms in different lines:
---
+1000
---
Cleansing
---
Thank you Haddix, that's very high praise. :)
---
Botany Knowledge and a simple no add-on yellow med-kit heals twice with 12 seconds each heal and you can heal teammates at that same speed. I rarely need more than 2 heals in a match. It's better than 2 heals taking 64 seconds compared to 24.
---
Cheers!  Thanks again.

lets go

If I'm running deliverance I at least run We'll make it and Borrowed time as well.

The crows on coldwind should be replaced with hens.
---
I mean sure, if you have the items &amp; perk slots for it. Which I normally don't.
---
Just had a game where I looped the Killer for a minimum of 3 minutes.... ONE generator got done. Then they didn't grab me off hook.
---
First of all, you haven't said anything about tunneling in that comment, but you do talk about camping a lot, so let me explain. I think camping is scummy. And no, it doesn't work, unless you let it. Someone has 2 minutes on a hook, one survivor doing a gen takes 80 seconds. 3 people working on separate gens can get all 5 done in 1 minute and 60 seconds not counting travel time and also not considering 2 people working on one of the 2 last gens. If you take the time the killer takes to find and hook the survivor they're camping and the time it takes for that survivor to die, the other survivors should be out. And standing near a hook, unless another survivor is nearby, actually takes points away from the killers sacrifice emblem, thus making it likely they'll lose. Once again I agree that camping is toxic, I just don't think it works.
---
Just turn off the in-game chat. It'll save you a lot of energy mentally, and you won't be feeding the trolls with your responses, be it in the shape of talking back in-game or making posts like this.  
---
Out of sight, out of mind.
---
Tell them to fuck off and move to the next game, if you see them again bring an ebony mori.
---
I partially agree that most games go well, 2 people escaping could more or less be considered a victory for survivors. Equally killing 2 people could be considered a win for the killer.
---
Aside from clean sweeps on either side, with all the team-work involved, it's really only the individual wins, it's really strange.
---
So that I can then chase the other person straight away without worry about the guy who was unhooked going and doing gens.
---
You can kill people before end game earlier in the trial tho.
---
Thanks, I've only come back to the game after ages of being away from it and couldn't remember if it was a thing
---
No problem and have fun coming back
---
is this a real perk?
---
The song is a cover? I‚Äôm sure- been a while since I‚Äôve heard the original. By who, if I may ask? I‚Äôm really diggin‚Äô it while watching Feng flying to the heavens tbh~
---
Note: Feng Min died on the way back to her home planet.
---
There's a lot of cool stuff that used to be in DBD but were later removed in order to streamline the gameplay aspect. This and the original vault pull animation come to mind
---
That last part is so understandable. With only 1 killer that it really pays off, it's not worth it. 
---
Every one is either walking, crouching across the map for an unhook/repair + selfcares= 20 minute games. More then half of that time is wasted on the last 2 gens, when multiple people do this. Get hooked once after distracting the killer for over 2 minutes, and no one will help u.
---
I try to be as productive as possible, if only my teamates could too.
---
Bro this game is supposed to be about surprise and mystery, why do you need a handicap to counter 1/4  POSSIBLE perks? 
---
Omg I can‚Äôt believe killers DC over bad totem placements with survivors like you existing , and it‚Äôs not even like they did a DRASTIC totem rework, the locations are the same, only a few maps have minor location changes and the rest is just them adding more boxes to slightly hide the totems better...
---
Your solo argument‚Äô is pretty much void because you have the option to use 3rd party social media tools to preform your OWN SWF groups and with the new friend matchmaking system coming with dedicated servers you will have more incentive to play preform groups.
---
Solo experience is ENTIRELY on the individual that CHOSE that gameplay experience. The last thing this game needs is more handicaps to help the casuals it takes away from the adrenaline rush when things are handed to me because I don‚Äôt like a certain gameplay mechanic.
---
EGS exclusivity is no reason to pirate.
---
Spirit:
---
Spirit is widely considered the second S rank Killer falling (way) behind Nurse but still being leagues above everyone else. Her power makes her move stupid fast but all Survivors are invisible during it, forcing you to rely on sound to track them.
---
- Spirit Fury is a top tier perk, but only at Tier 3. When combined with Enduring, Spirit Fury pretty much allows you to ignore every third pallet essentially giving you a free hit provided they drop the pallet on your head.
---
- Hex: Haunted Ground is a great perk if you're running Hex: Ruin or Hex: Devour Hope, as Survivors will see the lit totem, cleanse it, and then be Exposed. Another high tier perk.
---
- Rancor is a good perk that helps guarantee one kill at least, but it's not as good as say No One Escapes Death. It being an Obsession Perk and not a Totem Perk is a huge point in it's favor, though.
---
Spirit is easily one of the best buys in the game, and she comes with Adam so it's not a bad deal all around.
---
Legion:
---
Luckily, you missed Mixtape Legion, because they were a broken piece of shit and the only Killer I'd say DCing against was perfectly fine for. His power is being able to injure people, give them deep wounds at the same time, and then knowing where everyone is in his terror radius for the duration. Legion is currently low tier.
---
- Mad Grit is great for Basement Builds or just preventing body blocking in general. Not a top tier perk, but it solves a problem you might be having.
---
- Iron Maiden is good on Huntress so she can reload faster, but being able to run Iron Maiden plus BBQ is pretty good due to knowing where people are if they jump into a locker or not, the 15 seconds of Exposed is just gravy on top.
---
- Discordance is a good tracking perk that can't be countered by anything except the survivors not working on gens together. I prefer Surveillance, but Discordance is great for post-rework Freddy.
---
None of his perks are required for anything, but they're all pretty nice to have. I'd say he's pretty skippable, but he's not too bad.
---
The Plague:
---
She can infect objects around the map by vomiting on them, which after a duration inflicts Broken status on Survivors. Survivors can cleanse at healing stations, but if you drink from the used healing stations your vomit stops infecting and starts downing. I suck with her, but she's generally seen as mid-tier.
---
- Dark Devotion is a pretty bad perk. It's fun in theory, and it's hilarious on Doctor, but there are better things you could be doing with a perk slot than giving your Obsession your Terror Radius.
---
- Infectious Fright (Or Shit Your Pants as the Devs put it) is amazing with Distressing, but it's good in general since it allows you to know if someone is nearby who can make a pallet or flashlight save. It's one of those perks that's good, but not great.
---
- Corrupt Intervention is her best perk, and wow is it great. Shutting down three gens for two minutes at the start of the game really helps you with patrolling, and you can even use it to set up degenerate 3-gen situations. All in all, it's a good stand in to Ruin that can't be cleansed.
---
She's decent, but the only real reason to get her if you don't like her is Corrupt Intervention. Up to you.
---
Freddy:
---
He got a rework and while his perks are still the same, he is drastically different. He no longer has to put Survivors to sleep, they do that passively at the trade off that he no longer sees the aura of the sleeping survivors. He has the ability to channel for 5 seconds to teleport to any gen on the map, and he can cancel it at any time to just scare survivors off the gen. He can place down Dream Snares that come down quickly, but only affect people who are asleep. He has an add-on that allows him to place fake pallets instead, and it's pretty screwy.
---
Freddy went from being the worst killer hands down to standing head and shoulders next to the likes of Billy, Huntress, and Hag. The only Killers objectively better than him are Nurse and Spirit.
---
Ghostface:
---
Ghostface is stealth Killer with a lot of potential. The fact that he can move at 115% without a terror radius and he gets a notification if someone is looking at him makes him great at finding survivors, and the one hit down potential just generally makes him scary. I can honestly say that since I started playing Ghostface is the first killer I've loved who was added in, and he's on the fast track to being my favorite killer in the game.
---
- Furtive Chase is pretty bad. Hooking the Obsession for less Terror Radius is a really niche ability, and Ghostface can already kill his terror radius and stain while in a chase so it's kind of worthless on him. It's skippable.
---
- I'm All Ears is actually pretty good, since a Survivor will jump during a chase and you can see what mind game they're trying to pull. I think this hard counters the Houndini Build due to Quick and Quiet only cancelling the noise notification while this just cares about if it was a Rushed action or not. Not a top tier perk, but a nice one to have in your back pocket.
---
- Thrilling Tremors is great on two fronts. The first is that when you pick up a survivor, any Generator not being worked on gets blocked and turns white, preventing anyone from jumping on them. The second is that any generator being worked on stays red, so you know exactly where a Survivor is (and since most Gens aren't in view of each other, they have no idea you're coming either). It's really only usable at Tier 3, since 100 or 80 seconds is too long to wait for 16 seconds of gen downtime.
---
Ghostface is decidingly mid-tier, but I love him anyway. I recommend you pick him up but that's just me.
---
Oh goddammit I think I'm actually about to cry, what the fuck
---
Dont worry comrade, on the bright side you don‚Äôt have to worry about being stalked anymore!
---
Do you mean Legion, Myers, Ghost face or Leatherface?  
---
They're all easy, but that doesn't really matter.

This was actually the funniest and most relatable post I have ever seen on this sub

---
Self care is so bad. I really wish people would stop running it. That and urban evasion, good GOD the amount of people who run that shitty ass perk irritates me.
---
They pay the devs a sum to guarantee exclusivity for a year. That sum doesn't replace the cost of the game, you are hurting the industry.
---
If you were a game developper; you would 100% go for that EGS money, allowing you to pay all devs more. 
---
Pirating a EGS exclusive game is dumb, and gurts the industry.
---
Lose the killer build: lithe, quick and quiet, dance with me, lightweight (or another perk, lightweight isn‚Äôt very good) 
---
Useless team mates build: decisive strike, deliverance, self care, balanced landing or dead hard 
---
I want to be chased build: balanced, dead hard, adrenaline, self care or decisive strike (ds if you‚Äôre confident enough being injured sometimes) 
---
Ultimate survival build (minimal chases): spine chill, urban, self care, balanced/dead hard 
---
Best team mate build: empathy, borrowed time, botany knowledge or we‚Äôll make it, exhaustion perk
---
Item collecting: plunderers and ace in the hole, other two perks don‚Äôt really matter 
---
Meme build: head on, no mither, diversion, exhaustion perk
---
What I usually run: balanced or dead hard and any 3 of: spine chill, borrowed time, bond, decisive strike, adrenaline, unbreakable, we‚Äôll make it, empathy
---
Anything about the new killer, im reaching 9000 shards and i want to know if i should save them or get legion.

I would like to see him dancing to 'Dota'

If you want to trade potential sales for being a platform exclusive expect a loss in sales or just straight piracy.
---
Their loss. I'll enjoy the game since they've been paid already.
---
It seems the hardcore players of this community know what they're talking about. I'm not even that good, and even i understood the logic behind urban envasion &amp; sprint burst being bad. With a bit convincing from this community alone, I realized self care is bad. No one on ps4 has talked about self care being trash. I asked some of my friends, and they all think it's good along with urban envasion. The metas do lack on console =/ sadly.
---
Sneed
---
Oh yeah, it‚Äôs big brain time
---
I found that every time I put in a Killer idea, I get serious feedback and almost always end up in the positive for Karma. The sub is plenty kind to serious killer ideas. I mean, the Scarecrow, the Crusader, and to a much lesser extent my own Judge and Harry Warden concepts were all extremely well received.
---
It's just that the last couple of them I've seen posted have been one paragraph overviews with no thought put in, no perks, no add-ons, and no personality; "He's a zombie lord who summons unkillable zombies" isn't fun, it's not cool, and it doesn't have interesting gameplay simply because we don't have enough information about it.
---
What's more, a lot of the fun of new Killers is the new perks, so posting up something without perks means that we don't get to have fun saying "I want that on Clown" or anything of that nature.
---
People appreciate effort. I guarantee you that if someone made a concept that had an unique power, three perks, and 15+ add-ons for the power it would be judged on it's own merits and, provided the idea was good, would end up on the front page.
---
Nea main big brain
---
Liar, 6 minutes between the posts smh
---
Why would I settle down when you are literally doing what you‚Äôre trying to advise me and knee jerk asking for a totem counter because you don‚Äôt know how to handle 5 totems so you want a totem timer handout, it‚Äôs gross.
---
I‚Äôm really not even a hardcore player, Hell I only started playing back in May. But yeah I‚Äôm right there with you, it‚Äôs sad how many people on PS4 run SC/UE on every loadout and just crouch around the map and heal in corners instead of doing the damn generators. You‚Äôd think constant death would get them to change but I guess not.
---
Also: people need to learn that in most scenarios, escaping through the hatch is NOT victory, your team got shit on and you were lucky enough to find it. Self caring and urban evading around until you can get hatch does not mean you have a good loadout.
---
Infinites? Lol, this was fixed while ago. And what about big loops, just run and wait for bloodlust. Or trap window immidiately.
---
I changed the generator skill check button to X on the PS4 (that‚Äôs the bottom button out of the four shapes, I‚Äôm not sure what that is on Xbox sorry) having both skillcheck buttons be operated by one hand seemed to help me a lot and I get great skillchecks 8/10 times
---
Yeah, but i guess it would be a 1 time only right? So just fuck the others 1st?
---

I'm starting to understand why you have negative karma lol you this toxic in game too or just on reddit?
---
Fuck I really want to play DBD now. I can't wait for my laptop to get fixed
---
Gabe, I swear to god, if you don't run your fat ass away right now, I'm not gonna save you
---
Where did you got that from? Would like to read it up. The said they‚Äòd bring him back so I thought he‚Äòd be in the scenes that are no stunts.
---
You can close annoying loops as trapper at the start of the game. For pallets, learn to moonwalk.
---
In general, watch tru3talent YouTube channel, he might be salty killer, but he is good killer, watch him play clown, trapper or wraith to see how to play basic m1 killer.
---
Is this from the same clip where the guy kinda walked past you?
---
Why do people think 16% debuff is minor? It literally feels so slow

Noo don‚Äôt gooo
---
It's been confirmed in interviews, and in behind the scenes footage, the only time Castle is seen on set was for that scene, where he took a video with James Jude Courtney, both of them in costume.
---
A telltale sign is how the mask fits both of them. Castle tends to have the signature "Castle stretch", whereas JJC tends to have a more H2 looking fit on the mask.
---
Yes same. I was about to mention it we need to know more about that cat. I think he should post just about his cat. Who‚Äôs with me?
---
Christ I just had PTSD from playing the DBD beta on my shitty ass laptop and lowering the graphics so much that I couldn't see after two meters.
---
Yeah
---
Well my objective is to kill you so don't complain about camping or tunneling
---
Yeah but it's still cool, you don't have to be a dick because someone's enjoying themself or the character.
---
There is no actual effect on bloodwebs. You might get more yellows then browns, but its been proven there is no discernable increase in rare items.

Prestiging is just for the cosmetics and the, uhm, prestigue of it.

You know what? It‚Äôs ok, I do that too.
---
Never seen someone go from 0 to 100 this quickly, what are you even talking about lol
---
What's the name of the song ?
---
Why even run perks if you just want to depip?
---
If anything run BBQ, Distressing, Hex: TotH and Beasts of Prey and then just fuck around without trying.
---
hands down plague with black incense. you could do a real life run of plauge inc!
---
Not really, just kinda unfun when you get a gen done and he still gets there and tracks you down,
---
Also just thought it doesn't make sense since he's not supposed to be able to teleport to finished gens.
---
I'm not really annoyed by it that much though and its not problematic.
---
so it's not a garbage perk when you can pick yourself up for the whole game
---
^(then dont comment)
---
Give me a good reason why. It‚Äôs more fair for both sides, survivors get multiple uses to prevent tunnelers more than once, and as a killer the only way it would get you is if you‚Äôre tunneling.
---
Sounds like you just like to tunnel.
---
I couldn't care less about most cosplays in general (I think they're nerdy).
---
When I think of these killers however it goes like this:
---
Michael Myers = iconic
---
Ghostface = iconic
---
Legion = 4 random edgy teenagers with knifes that probably listen to Evanescence and think they're emo
---
I'm sorry, but Legion does nothing for me design wise. The only think he makes me think of is those lame ass terrible Purge films.
---
we've all been there XD
---
It's okay, I think what's most important is to be awake so you don't get caught in his dream powers. When you're awake, he's a m1 killer, very easy to loop.
---
I agree! :D 
---
I'm not very good at looping though, I know the basics and stuff thanks to a friend who helped me get better at the game but aside that I suck at looping and prefer to just hold m1.
---
Everything that can hurt a survivor. The only exceptions are Vile Purge, Doctor's treatment mode and Clown's bottles. You lose tokens even if you don't hit.
---
Very well-thought objective list. Insightful. Vunderbar, comrade.
---
Not pipping as killer is a bliss, much rather spend my few killer games in the ranks around 9 rather to go down to purple and red ranks. now you get mb 1-2 survs that's decent at looping so most often you get 3-4 kills a game and doesn't have to deal with people knowing where all the loops and pallets are.
---
Takes a minute or 2 to take the photo and upload üòÅüòÄ please forgive me
---
Oh. Fucking. God.
---
Alongside with pallet vacuum
---
The FAK corsage. Simple, beautiful, elegant.
---
Real talk though, you only had 1 gen left and you both were undetected, why not try to finish a gen?
---
People who are "mentally ill" don't default to acting like assholes, and definitely shouldn't be considered as non-human.
---
100% ignore the toxicity, but dehumanising people is the reason we have so much toxicity in the first place.
---
I like it. Give the man a job at Behaviour!

As a console player, I don't have to make the choice. I feel bad for the PC community, but we've been dealing with this "buy exclusivity" garbage with CoD for years too. It's a shame that this is what people have to do to get an audience for themselves but it's how it be right now. Good luck with it all guys.
---
Yes but the killer wouldnt be watching you unless it was myers or ghostface
---
out if all legion cosplays i respect susie the most because the mask looks difficult to make
---
Unless I'm better at looping than you are, in which case you might not even get one kill. All it takes is for you to try and tunnel the wrong person and your entire strategy falls apart. Your so-called guaranteed kills aren't as guaranteed anymore, are they?  
---
Just find another target while someone is on the hook, put out some actual map pressure. Survivors aren't that hard to find, especially not with good tracking perks.  
---
Giving up a chase to go get the person who got off the hook removes quite a bit of the map pressure you have, especially if that person is at all competent, which a good portion of players will be in the higher ranks.
---
you should have put jane getting injured
---
You're not wrong, OP. The game's community is cancer and attracts severely entitled shitlords that truly believe that nothing they do is ever wrong and killer players have to play by their made up rules.
---
This was really good, I enjoyed it
---
That‚Äôs pretty ass, but us beta boys remember two window one door shack with no window blockers and super slow window vaulting for killer
---
How to counter looping? Practice Nurse and never touch any other killer again.
---
immersed? i dont see how a meg sprint bursting away when hearing a heartbeat is immersive

Nice script

There was a thing called "crate depression". It was a bug with certain lootboxes in which you 100% got an unusual, which are worth quite a bit. The people that didn't want to abuse this wanted some sort of compensation (cheaters lament), since they didn't take part in destroying the economy. Literally the whole subreddit was spammed with memes about the "crybabies that slept through the glitch". Valve ended up making the 1st unusual you got tradeable and the rest untradable, with no compensation for the people that didn't glitch and no punishment for those that did glitch. Btw. this just shows that, if you see a bug in any valve game, abuse it, they won't punish you.

---
&gt;Isn't the whole point of that Emblem supposed to show your skill at evading the Killer? Yet if you manage to not be found the whole game or at least most of the game, you get low points for it if any at all.
---
**Evading** the killer and **Avoiding** the killer are different situations. Hiding from the killer the entire match is not that difficult and it also hurts your team more often than not, stealth should never be rewarded in DBD because if affects negatively both sides (boring for killers, harmful for possible teammates). 
---
In that sense, Evader emblem rewards you massively if you manage to completely evade the killer **during a chase**, even if just for a few seconds (letting go of your sprint button to cause the chase to end).
---
Oh man. Got goosebumps watching that. When she ran off, limping into the mist knowing she wasn‚Äôt going to make it out. So noble
---
The attempted teabag at the end was pretty immature
---
Same could be said for quite a few Killers, Freddy is another. Literally just a striped jumper, Fedora and black pants. 
---
High level cosplays I think would be Hag, Wraith, Spirit, Doctor and HillBilly since all of them are disfigured in some way. A lot of Killers are just people as intended; driven insane by their shitty pasts so a lot of them would be quite easy to cosplay because you literally just need to copy their clothes.

---
Yes and I also have it on nearly every character
---
Ah shit. Here we go again
---
Ok but what's the song I enjoy it
---
I think the problem is there is no way to differentiate and most of the time tea bagging is done in a toxic way and the killer might take that as a fuck you type of tea bag.
---
Should have showed their names
---
How are you using these tactics with one of the highest tier killers?
---
it's against this sub's policy
---
i understand, but in this case rather annoying. These people deserve every amount of hate that comes to them
---
Killer is easy in environments where the players are worse. The entry to killer is much lower. But when everyone is good, survivor is a.) much easier and b.) actually it's almost impossible to win on your own merits as anyone but Spirit and Nurse.
---
So, in all honesty, if you think killer is too easy or too strong, the chance is you're not very good at the game YET, and struggle with some basics, but once you got those down and you start ranking up, you should find games easier and easier. :)
---
fairly sure there‚Äôs a window in that building you were trapped in on the second floor, if anything the kate was blocking you
---
Haha silly lad, matchmaking has BEEN broken since launch! Just now it's for some reason super shit right now
---
I don't think that change anything... Think about a game where you can not escape with the trap on your head putted after all gen are finished, so there are 2 option:
---
1) Your team open the gates, the killer has no other objective and he just putted a trap on you so he knows where you are and he will not go for someone else waiting for you to untrap. He will just chase you untill end game collapse does his job, not matter if the timer is 1 min or 20 min, he has no pressure to chatch you fast. In the best situation you are playing with a good team so they understand they need to leave to give you the chance to find the hatch, but you are at the end of the match, when almost every pallet is used, you can't hold a good chase to find the hatch. Also you just got trapped so you are injured for sure e probably on the ground so chance you find the hatch are like 0.
---
2) your team doesn't open the exit gates, but again the killer has no other objective and probably the exit gates are one tap to get opened so he will not chase someone else, and again, you are at the end of the game, when almost every pallet has been used, you can't do much.
---
It's not a problem of timer, the problem is that the killer just need to walk near you and just wait for your death.
---
That mouth area is terribly done IMO
---
Thanos should have an rbt on
---
I always do this if there's just two of us left.
---
I agree with the part where you say ds should deactivate when someone else is hooked but it still should only be useable once per match.
---
In all honesty, DbD has the worst community I know. Most toxic (and I played pretty much every popular game except CSGO, and LoL, OW etc. all don't even come close to DbD), the most whiney (seriously, that entitled attitude of DCing vs. certain killers and such is unique, at least to this crazy extent), and the most ignorant, where a bunch of people always blame the other players rather than their own poor decisions.
---
Game's fun and addictive, community is a shitshow.
---
It just breaks my heart seeing plagues being bullied. We are good hard working killers
---
I think the games fine
---
ghost face is easy, sure. But "The Ghost Face", the DBD character has a super complex skin. "The Shape" at least requires a mask and coveralls. "The Legion" is any shitty sweatshirt and a poorly made mask...
---
Whys that? It‚Äôll only prevent tunneling further, as long as you hook someone else you‚Äôll be fine.
---
Yeah its houdini‚Äôs perk
---
Sounds to me like you just have a hard time putting out map pressure. You can tell me all you want about how you don't tunnel, but for you to defend it this hard just leads me to believe the opposite is true.  
---
Allow me to repeat myself:  
---
**Giving up a chase to go get the person who got off hook removes quite a bit of the map pressure you have.**  
---
Tunnelling isn't effective, because again, you're losing out on a ton of map pressure by only focusing on one survivor when you can be forcing 2+ survivors to be wasting time and not getting shit done.  
---
What I'm about to say isn't something I say often, but dude. Git gud.
---
maybe can lock all but 3 gens at every point. still stalls the game but still has to patrol
---
Weird . Except bbq you can buy every "pay2win" dlc with shards or you wait for the shrine. Oh and btw the licenses costs smth, so they kinda need the money for that. But wait there is more, you dont have to buy any cosmetics nor dlc. Perks are in the shrine from ALL dlcs , otherwise it would be p2w.
---
There isn‚Äôt, the only way down is by the stairs. Poor map design
---
They won‚Äôt be immune as long as you don‚Äôt tunnel lol.
---
And DS isn‚Äôt a crutch perk you dweeb, a crutch perk is something like adrenaline or urban evasion, Decisive strike directly counters tunneling, and it‚Äôs very possible to go matches without ever using it. The rework I suggested actually makes DS much weaker as long as you don‚Äôt tunnel, as you can effectively turn it off and get rid of their 60 seconds of invulnerability.
---
Do you even know what a crutch perk is?
---
People that lead the killer to you while you're working on the gen as 'there were no pallets near me' can also fuck right off.
---
upvoted for nickelback
---
Two problems with that:
---
1: you don't definitely know if they're SWF or not not unless they're obvious about it, you've played them before (and didn't change their names), or you checked their profiles. 
---
2: if you bring a mori to the fight half the time the pricks will just disconnect on the load screen or just give up in-game. With the later you at least get points but they still get their way by trolling you in a way.

Cleanse totems, search chests. Whatever you can do. Although it makes it hard because 3/4 Emblems require the killer (Unless Freddy where you can get Altruism by waking each other up) just try what you can to at least break even and not de-pip.
---
Thank you, but that might be an overstatement.
---
For you? Yes!

Survivors: "Lol just slug to counter DS what you crying about lol stop tunneling"

I feel like you're really overlooking the amount of things you can get with iridescent shards.

Not quite; 2K was willing to take the L, as these things happen even if not usually to such a degree, but when it turned out that the literally who Youtuber who blew up by dishing out an array of accurate BL3 leaks did so by exploiting a bug in the security of the mobile Twitch app to draw information from test streams (which as since been found and patched due to this), and furthermore was selling access to a private Discord channel wherein leaks dumped, a line had clearly been crossed; they therefore chose to send G men to tell him off and may be preparing for legal action.

&gt;Is there anything I can do to combat this pip loss scenario?
---
If the killer's character isn't facing a wall, you can trigger and immediately end chases in front of him, netting you a gold / iridescent evader if you do this enough times.
---
A chase starts when the killer is looking at you and you move (literally one step is enough) in front of him while holding the sprint button (shift on PC). Letting go of the sprint button causes the chase to end and you get a "escaped' score event, you don't even have to break line of sight. Get the "escaped" score event around 6 ~ 10 times and you should be fine.
---
Oh man what is this thread. Ruin aint shit you dont have to use it to play the damn game and it aint even p2w you can buy it on the shrine or just the hag with playtime and on console she is free. Ruin is a strong perk but you dont need it to play smh
---
That pause yall had lmao

mor√≠ counter isn‚Äôt that bad. waltz is horrible for baby killers useless for normal killers. now you see me is horribly op. would make lockers useless, would make it a pain in the ass for the killer. if invi was 5 seconds and maybe a huge downside like only walking and/or having your aura shown to killer for 100 seconds
---
would have to be single use too
---
Its to FORCE the killer to get DS'd because otherwise most killers will just slap you down and leave you there. Cuz that'd waste yours and another survivors time.
---
Yeah but they give items and BP, may as well escape with a little extra for wasted time.
---
I think for a guy like him his belly is too clean
---
Git gud, OP
---
With the spirit Iv been really lucky lately finding the hatch before the last survivor. If I see it mid game I always try to make a note of it. But.. I‚Äôm usually really high so I can‚Äôt remember where the hell it is lol. I just Spirit walk and listen for the wind.

I'm just trying to understand their logic, do they expect you to allow them to get an easy win?
---
Everyone can counter it with monitor
---
It just seems so... idk wrong for a company to send their OWN investigators, like a bunch of crooks or something. They should of just taken legal action instead.
---
Bro ruin is free for console players and the hag can be unlocked via playtime + you can buy it in the shrine. Ruin is a strong perk but you dont need it to win or to play the game. And how do you need ds there are more powerful perks out there that are free (adrenaline, selfcare..) ds isnt as good as it used to be and thats good cuz it was op af. All you really need to win is Nurse and its a gg Kappa
---
Why do you need to understand their logic? You‚Äôre ultimately going to play how you want so why even waste the energy caring what 4 turds did  or said that you‚Äôre less likely to run into back to back matches?
---
Yep that's a very good point. Look at Fifa for example. People are done with it. And PES is getting beter people say. So you can already see people moving on from Fifa to Pes
---
it's a dick move no matter which way you look at it, sure it's only crouching but the movement itself isnt the annoying part its what it's supposed to mean
---
Dat lag, dat escape.
---
Tbh if I ran into a Dying Light+Mori Myers with NOED I would probably Teabag too
---
thank you for this. you have opened my eyes that dead by daylight is not the same since the endgame collapse was added. and i was thinking about whenever a jigsaw box was used to free a survivor the trap and the box would become unusable. but then all the pig would have to do is wait for survivors to activate a trap, and just camp the last remaining box. and i wanted the trap to kill in the endgame collapse (no timer) only if they crossed the threshold of the exit gate, like how she used to be.
---
Nah I play both. Actually Killer is more fun to play since my friends doesn't play that much and I hate solo surv. So I'm only against tunneling.
---
But... Okay, I know somewhere on the internet is a chart that shows exactly how many times each and every perk has been on the shrine. It's not a very high pay wall if you can wait it out and buy if with in-game currency.
---
Also I forgot to say something earlier, but DS isn't even in the meta anymore, it's just an anti-tunnel perk. Which I also got with shards.
---
My name is giorno giovanna

I feel ya.. It was either that or coming through like a wrecking ball lol..

Mature. But okay, I'll explain why: You say that you stopped reading. Therefore you have no idea what is actually in this post, and that means that any opinion you have on it is invalid, since you haven't read it
---
1: With the new endgame it would make her too strong so I see this as fair.
---
2: I think they need to rework how the boxes work overall, and just like the Trapper nobody wants to traverse the map to collect their traps.
---
3: Do it
---
First of all I really don't tunnel. Why would I lie about it, I don't care about what a person on reddit thinks about me. Secondly, lmaooo git gud? What are you five? If you really think that the way the game design is rn is fine then you have either never touched killer or you are braindead. Literally everyone acknowledges that generators get done stupidly fast and the fact that the game is unplayable without ruin and 13 out of 16 killers get destroyed at higher ranks says a lot. But yeah I guess I should just git gud üôÉ
---
Fuck this is a quality meme
---
The last claudette in my game started healing me cause she say the killer before me to keep me in place so that I'd take the down instead of her.

## NOED ON MICHAEL

‚Ä¢
---
ok
---
Idk man it's not that serious, most of the time swf gets pooped on by their altruism. Play off of that, that is how I usually succeed against a good swf. If you start losing gens pretty quickly at the start just prepare to accept you aren't necessarily going to win that particular match, it happens. I personally don't care or pay attention in pregame whether or not I'm going against a swf or solos. But playing off their altruism is key. Double back to hooks right away when someone is saved and focus on the rescuer that way you can get some momentum, if you the the unhooked survivor too don't be afraid to slug forcing another survivor to get off a gen and come help.
---
&gt;Doin' gens, you?

You can't say a character is "pay to win" when you can unlock it for free.

Yeah there's probably not much point to it, just find the thinking of some people interesting üòÇ
---
This happened to me yesterday lol. It was a ghost face and he dropped me near the hatch, closed it, then proceeded to tbag me until the collapse took me lol
---
Good man? They are usually the most annoying
---
Happens my guy just block them and move on.
---
Yea basically what everybody else said. There are almost no(if any) unsafe pallets, making it hard for killer. Finding a staircase can be annoying sometimes and give survivors enough time to finish a gen.
---
On the other side, struggling to find stairs can screw the survivor in a chase. Two floors makes it impossible to tell where the terror radius center is. some gens are in very stupid spots(see the bathroom, where the killer gets a free hit if you‚Äôre there. Since the pallets are split more or less half on top and half on bottom, it‚Äôs easy to go through all the pallets on one floor and then the gens are harder to do on that floor. It‚Äôs also one of the few maps that have fair hex totem spawns, which survivors hate.
---
Sure you do lol.

Despite what others would say, camping is a tactic. It's just a very unfun and terrible one. Insidious was a perk created in simpler times where survivor retardation was even worse than it is now. The idea probably was to be able to camp in basement, or camp a generator. It's just a perk whose intention seemed fine on paper but in reality is just bad. Honestly suprised they havent changed the perk that much.
---
Dont tbag u dickhead
---
No that is not true. Let's as an example look at FIFA. People are complaining about it being pay to win, while you can just get a good team for free. You have to play a lot (aka earning iridesdent shards) and get a bit lucky (aka shrine of secrets). Yet the game is being boycotted, since all players find it pay to win.
---
Dbd is maybe not as bad as FIFA, but that doesn't take away the FACT that it is pay to win
---
Lucky for you I'm a dog lover
---
Oh, makes sense! üòÇ
---
rip the 4th
---
Don't go below rank 15, it's sad but you literally have to throw games to keep having fun because people in low ranks are just so toxic.
---
That's why you see killers afking attacking all the time, and why you see survivors dying in first hook, everyone is trying to de-pip.
---
while that‚Äôs true, there are people who make those threats in the first place and that‚Äôs the problem. If OP did lie for upvotes it‚Äôs scummy
---
I've never played FIFA, so that's not really a thing I can comment on.
---
But alright, I can admit that to some degree, it exists, but also I can't cry "Pay to win!" Because the meta perks are strong and help a lot, but they're not 100% necessary to win and be good at the game. 
---
And most of the really good perks come from original characters anyways. 
---
Cosmetics though? Some of that shit is highway robbery. 21000 shards or 10 dollars, for a skin. Fuck off with that lol
---
I definitely have no need or want to insult or troll you for this post, just thought it was worth a discussion.
---
As for the community, well they're gonna do what they want because *insert equivalent of "you don't pay my sub" here*
---
What's wrong with pausing EGC then? It is not hard to implement and it wouldn't be such a disaster for survivors, but ffs, pig was unfairly gutted.
---
WWEEEHHHH
---
Flashlights take 1.1 second to blind the killer. The pickup animation is 3 seconds, blinding th killer 2 seconds in shoukd get it. Or more preciseky when the shoulder tilts when putting them on their shoukder. Try it in kyf. Typing on shitty phone so my bad.
---
1. Maybe it's not meta, but atleast 75% of the matches I play I get to use my DS, so it's essential. That's still pay to win. You're wrong there.
---
2. Nope, please read again what I said.
---
3. Agreed, Freddy rework was indeed something good, which I can only cheer the devs to do more.
---
The dlc's are definetely not cheap. In Rocket League f.e. you can buy dlc cars for 2-4euros (also licensed). The other online dlc's I've boughy were not pay to win, so not comparable
---
And Survivors can wipe away their tears with their Dead Hard, DS, Adrenaline and borrowed time any time they get camped/tunelled.
---
Welcome to DBD.
---
I understand but my stature is more of the hag than clown. I'm 5'6" and weigh 100 lbs -.- lol
---
what
---
The nerve of that Claud afterwards lmao, this was aggravating.
---
I would love a Payday character in this game. Think your onto something here, OP.
---
What are these, scratch marks?
---
Great video, liked the editing and the music!
---
Congrats, bro!
---
We actually stood there for a solid 10 seconds, and then I just turned around and walked away slowly and she turned the other way and did the same LMAO
---
Judith's tombstone and fragrant tuft of hair. Ruin (to slow the game down) and play with your food (to speed you up) 
---
How I do it is patrol gens like normal get in a free smack or 2, maybe even a hook. The main goal is to just keep them busy and off gens while you are building that stalk meter. Once you hit tier 3... Thats when the match actually starts. Prepare for hate mail. Lol. Its important you don't lunge in tier 3.
---
Like i said to someone in this same post, yesterday we had: a pig, a dwight, a wraith, a spirit, and 2 legions on hot
---
Bbq&amp;chili is still one of the best perks. Besides, there will be future updates which may contain meta perks. Heck, even Mettle of Man was the best perk for a few months and it was locked behind pay walls
---
You're asking like two questions here but yeah I can be tough to use if they spot of right away. It's best to hide yourself as best as possible. If you do manage to get it at least half way at the beginning you should be good. If you get it all the way then yeah gg lol. And people complain about everything in the game when something doesn't go their way, these add ons are no exception lol
---
WEEEWOOO!!!!WEEEWOOO!!!!WEEEWOOO!!!!!
---
Gens are done, fyi
---
Totally agree, I had to use this for a challenge. I was gonna be relatively nice until I there was an object and moried them.
---
The switch's graphics aren't as bad as you think, and this image is also a rendered version of it.
---
Only use this stuff for challenges, it makes people not like this game lol
---
Lol only if it‚Äôs this version!!!

Poor playing doesn't justify taking the game hostage what are you smoking
---
Yet another one of those montages and stuff. The dialogue is in portuguese, but nothing really crucial is said - with the possible exception of ‚ÄúOh look, a fiery totem, Im gonna cleanse it‚Äù
---
Tell me what you think!
---
(Be gentle, lol)
---
Keep walking in front of and walking away from the killer
---
Do gens by yourself instead of with a group 
---
Miss skill checks to regress gens to make sure you get to get full objective points
---
Make sure you open an exit gates Find and use the hatch after your group leaves. 
---
Cleanse dull totems, open chests, sabotage hooks. 
---
You‚Äôll AT LEAST black pip.
---
I completely understand, I may come back to it by the next DLC. However I am enjoying Rainbow Six Siege, Minecraft and Cod Bo3 Zombies a lot rn.
---
wot
---
So people like cosplaying legion, the posts get upvoted and reach hot, and you all complain wanting the sub to stop them. Who is snowflake there
---
You act like decisive 100% only triggers when you‚Äôre getting tunneled lol. 60 seconds is a long time and there is a lot of variants.
---
Almost did, but there was an object lol
---
Never was crying considering I killed 2 of them
---
Oh, also neat to know. Mine was from a bug refund
---
I was finishing the last gen together with other two vs Nurse. So we're finishing the gen but Nurse grabs and hooks me. The other two just leave through the gates. I feel betrayed lol
---
In game 
---
Blood Dance does not register any of the healing I am doing on teammates, I've healed at least four full health bars and no progress made.
---
No i live in Australia
---
Disagree. Pink Moris are always unfun for survivors. It's an *insane* advantage.
---
Instead of needing, 3 chases and 3 hooks x4, they now need 2 chases and 1 hook x4. That's crazy. I love the kill animations, but damn are pink Moris broken asf.
---
ngl i laughed pretty fucking hard at this title
---
What region? I play in NA and have to wait 3 minutes max?
---
This game is on xbox?
---
Yeah at the low ranks killer is op, mainly because having just 1 sucky survivor can ruin it for the whole team.  But then it flip flops soo fast at like rank 10, I also wish it was less one sided
---
Survivor meta shifts constantly and is kind of a revolving door but as far as killers go, it's usually Nurse's Calling, BBQ, Ruin and NOED or honestly a bunch of other choices for that last slot.
---
But for the most part it's easy enough to replace the licensed perk with one that's free. 
---
In this instance take out BBQ, most killers will tell you that they only run it for the blood points. So you don't wanna spend money or wait for shrine? Try Distressing, or the less popular Beast of Prey, or Thrill of the Hunt to go with that NOED.
---
It's all about how you go about it.
---
Anyways, I hope to have given you some food for thought in all this. Take care, have fun, and I hope to see you in the fog. :)
---
I have a direct view from my toilet to the tv. So I can shit and teabag at the same time!
---
&gt;how could someone complain about add ons that may or may not even work during the game?
---
Because some people dont like dying and think they are entitled to survive no matter what
---
Thank you
---
But I want the achievements for reaching rank 1
---
I think he means in game.
---
To be fair to them, there isn't any built in voice chat in the game. I think that's what they mean. Personally I disagree with it being called cheating too, still it's undeniable that it provides an advantage.
---
Dbd ghostface is different
---
gogogogogogogogo
---
Frank is definitely one of my most wanted Survivors for DbD, let me know if you have any criticisms!
---
Thats my humor
---
I think it should be changed to you recover slower, but you can fully recover instead
---
billy is easier.... all you have to do is be clapped
---
Hoffman best
---
.... do you want a cookie? No jukes, no minds games, just a hatch escape. That‚Äôs like posting ‚ÄúI made it to rank 1‚Äù good for you.
---
I can never find the hatch, I was just pumped that I actually found it.
---
Wha-
---
Ok it does feel good to find the hatchi found it once and Freddy slammed it shut in my face once. Fair to say I died that time lol
---
Omg I‚Äôve done this in my kyf xD also stun her after with a pallet she was like omfg I hate you sm
---
Miss the graphics from back then, hate how the game looks now
---
Bet
---
Hey there are dozens of us non toxic Claudettes
---
Oh nooo :(  I would have been a bit salty.
---
It took me a while to realize that it made a noise.
---
Then equip head on uwu
---
Probably deserved it. I killed a player named toxicmia earlier and I wanted to laugh cause he/she was so terrible at everything.
---
fair point, i was speaking from the perspective of something along the lines of 'i just pallet stunned you and now im tbagging'
---
The thing is there isn't much skill in the game until literally rank 3-1. That's honestly the only thing remotely difficult in the game, so below that is often a dice roll. So killer IS really easy even at rank 5 or so, because most survivors will be fairly bad.
---
But when you play vs. good survivors (which is also difficult to be) you'll have to be good at mindgaming. The way you route your target, hiding red stain etc. There's a much high skill ceiling to killer than survivor, but killer is much easier to get into, for sure. :)
---
Oh my God like stop posting so much negativity
---
Hmm, Nea would now be an actual killer.
---
 Bro, cows are so cute
---
Yeah I think maybe they shouldn‚Äôt be put back into his inventory, but should take longer to unlock, and have more
---
I'm getting PTSD just by looking at that.
---
Takes me at least a minute in USA

---
Claudette: "Bill, why are you crying? Haven't you caught on to the fact that every time we die we just come back in another trial?"
---
I don't think anyone realizes that you were the killer
---
John Kramer used a prototype Pig costume to kidnap someone once. Actually, come to think about it, Kramer, Gordon, and Hoffman are all better fits as The Pig than Amanda. What with Amanda loving her inescapable traps.
---
**So, where do I begin? Let's begin with the fact, that dbd is a pay to win game.**
---
\- Everything is Cosmetic skills pay the bills, clothes are just optional.
---
**perks like DS are almost needed as a survivor to help you survive, and playing killer without Ruin is almost impossible at red ranks.**
---
\- D-strike and Ruin while good can easily be replaced with other perks. The fact that ruin is in every killers setup is because it's the only thing we got to slow down the game a little. Otherwise gen rushing would make games not even last 10-ish minutes.
---
**good killers being locked behind pay walls.**
---
\- That is all relative, not everyone plays good with what you consider good killers.
---
**But, you already bought the game, and these dlc's are extra's that you should be happy with?**
---
\- Would you like a subscription then? 10$ a month and you get all DLC free, they need to cover expenses somehow an an online game no matter if it's a PvP or MMORPG has a lot of maintenance. It's either payable DLC and cosmetics or subscriptions. They aren't your friedn they are a corporation trying to make money.
---
**Also, dedicated servers. My god we are waiting long for these. It's literally taking them about a year almost**
---
\- Freddy revamp took a long time but he seems happy with it... It'll come the fact that you rage about it doesn't make it come faster.
---
**Now let's talk about events. Let's have a look at last years halloween event (forgot the exact name so apolagies). They had some really cool cosmetics right? And you can get them exclusive!! Oh... wait... you can also just buy them. Now these cosmetics don't have any value anymore**
---
\- Did they ever have value in the first place, it's not because you trudge around in a cool skin your suddenly a better player...
---
**What about the dbd birthday 'event' a few weeks ago? Just some bloody party streams with an extra 3%, and fireworks (which are already in the game).**
---
\- Since when do they owe you anything for any reason at all? Entitlement much?
---
**But atleast we're getting a summer event right?! Nope, the devs wanna work on the game itself first. And normally I completely agree**
---
\- It seems all you do is disagree but please good sir, continue the rant.
---
**So, I personally find that the devs are being incredibly greedy lately. And I feel like if they continue the path they're taking, people will eventually get pissed at it. I honestly think they're quite lucky that that's not the case right now, since I know a lot of other games that people are boycotting because of some greedy devs. What are your guys opinions on this?**
---
\- The games being boycotted are unfinished heaps of trash that shouldn't have been released, or are instances where the devs and producers misuse their power (the T2 and 2K SupMatto debacle comes to mind). BHVR hasn't done any of that *(there are rumors of Ghostbans on the Official Forum though)*, and while there sometimes arises a bug or issue it gets fixed soon enough.
---
What rank?
---
Alright I appreciate the advice. Thank you for your quick response.
---
Not another one of these.  You're like the thousandth person on here to float this dumbass idea.  It would be a lobby dodging simulator.  Every killer unsure of their ability would dodge the labeled swf group everytime.  It's a horrible, horrible idea and would destroy queue times while chasing a massive amount of the playerbase out of the game.  Baaaaaaad idea.
---
Nah these SCUMBAG survivors did their objective and got all the gens done so of course according to killer mains on this subreddit that gives him the right to body block the stairs
---
Im sorry that happened man. Match making is messed up right now.
---
You don‚Äôt have to throw! Run Insidious + LF and defend the basement chest.
---
This whole sub is a killer circle jerk.
---
This is true thou
---
One of Freddy's main characteristics is the burnt face
---
I think its alright. Im just salty rn haha. I hope they fix matchmaking soon. I want my adept killers ._.
---
They nerfed it to make the games longer.
---
I mean, for Deliverance you'll have to run BT if you farm people, no safe unhooks otherwise :P
---
Idk what it is if your in America but you can get leatherface for ¬£3.99 I mean it's not like call of duty charging a pound for a red dot sight or 15.99 for what 4 5 new maps cmon it's ¬£3.99 and they still made it ya know and its not essential survivor pudding is basically the same thing

It‚Äôs so annoying to see the same unfunny meme posts all the time too. There‚Äôs so much oversaturated content. It‚Äôs also annoying to see people ask if they should use a certain perk they have in their inventory, instead of just trying it to see if they like it.
---
And people thought Tony Stark‚Äôs death was the ultimate sacrifice
---
Fabulous
---
Why do we have to do this on here I don't get it?  People get defensive when a toxicity post targets their side and goes oh yeah well the other side does it too..
---
Who cares?  It's still wrong to act like an asshat regardless of what side they're doing it on.  We should all agree on this not get in arms and have to try to spin it to the other side by default.

I love michael Myers but I‚Äôm so fucking sick of seeing shirtless Myers it‚Äôs never been funny but it just won‚Äôt die

Well, if survivor game is instant, means more killer players than survivor players are playing today.
---
If ya can't fork out the money for leatherface you can get it with shards something you wouldn't get with ubisoft ea or Activision
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say that but it‚Äôs really annoying that whenever someone posts a survivor teabagging at the exit and they get caught, everyone‚Äôs like ‚Äúhe deserved it bro, don‚Äôt t-bag!!‚Äù But whenever a killer is trying to BM and leave someone slugged while waiting for ECG to run out and the survivor uses unbreakable and gets out everyone comes and defends the killer. Just stop
---
And yet you did it. Lol.
---
I can't hear this song and not think about Danny singing it

Maybe they‚Äôre running them to practice.

oh god what wait i recognize that killer name, is this a dev build!?

I get lost and can't find the stairs all of the time XD especially as killer. I get lost on the bottom level.

Hers was actually the easiest for me to make. For frank I had to basically spray over it with white because I kept messing up the eye shapes and blood splatters.

Haha yeah, ik im not great at freddy. I did, however, just get Adept Nightmare trophy. I guess its just the people i go against. Then again, i just double pipped merciless against rank 7, 12, 15, and 16. Huh
---
This whole game is. 
---
Not all (key word lol) but most Killers still think Survivors are some powerhouse like its 2017 still. It's pathetic and sad the victimized behaviour from them as if they're still the powerless M1 jokes. Which, we all know, isn't the case anymore.
---
It has to be?
---
Didudu didudu didu didu
---
You chase a player for 5 minutes and finally down someone else who was just in the way, you hook him, that other player followed you to hook and you camp because you give up and just want one sacrifice. Friends of both players come, you have camped the person till he was one hook away from death, his friends unhook him while others make you stuck, you punch the guy that made you stuck and manage to hook him. Camping yet again you decide to patrol a lil bit and come back to hook, this person is now 1 hook away from death too. All of the friends show up once again, the make you stuck so they can save, the person gets saved and you can only punch one guy before he manages to Sprint burst away into the corn. You finally get another person has never been hooked, you chased him for 5 minutes again before getting him and you hook him, camping again because youre pissed, 2 minutes later he is one hook too, only 3 gens are left. All of the sudden all of his friends show up again, one tries to blind you, one tries to block you and the other one save, you hit the hooked guy and he has borrowed time, you manage to get him anyway, DECISIVE STRIKE and all of the sudden all gens turn on and everyone activates Adrenaline. With all of the sadness and rage you leave.
---
It is
---
Meh Micheal was worse with that build.
---
Im glad we were all able to come together and realize how much the devs really do care about this game through this post.
---
She is Perk-Reliant, and her ‚Äúbest‚Äù perk is a trap. Do not use the one that blocks Gens at game start. It‚Äôs a wasted slot.
---
As for add ons, use time reducing for her charge ups. Time added to infection is a waste.

Green spit allows you to get pips for Play With Your Food, But black spit will spend a pip.

Why isn‚Äôt he already in the game

Why did I make this.
---
Sounds like you need new thermal paste
---
Are u gonna do it tho?
---
If they‚Äôre infinite looping you around the map then you‚Äôre probably tunneling which is a sign of a bad killer. Infinites aren‚Äôt a thing anymore
---
Hero - Chad Kroeger
---
Frank would be feckin great
---
If you slug the person them that still counts as tunnelling.
---
*Doesn‚Äôt only punish tunnelers, it enables hook-rushers and fucks over people without it
---
Ah makes sense! I‚Äôve only just got back into the game so I wasn‚Äôt sure when rank reset was
---
This is good and very much accurate to the playerbase lol. The amount of times i want to try out new builds on both sides, just to be beaten easily by fully equipped opponents can make me want to do the same meta build all the time.
---
1. Smart Killers will always slug freshly-unhooked Survivors if there is an obsession.
---
2. Hiring more devs doesn't always speed things up. New coders have to be trained and brought up to speed with how the game works. This might actually slow things down.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't cars in Rocket League just skins? In DBD, chapters usually contain 2 characters and 6 perks. Bear in mind, each Killer has a unique ability.
---
Ahem. Whenever passing anything, gens or totems, infect them. And never try to break someone, always just vomit a little and just get in to a regular chase and if you don't have thrill of the hunt always vomit on hexs so you can get a warning. And when using corrupt purge, you only need one drop of vomit to damage so try and spray it, don't try to be deadly accurate with it. Another strat is consuming corrupt as little as possible to slow them down but I wouldn't recommend it. But your main goal is to slow them down, just.keep.vomiting
---
I always give them an offering as a token of my gratitude. Also, if the killer's beong cute or funny I always want to give them a present.
---
I don‚Äôt use self care as it‚Äôs a waste of a slot and just wastes so much time especially with sloppy butcher. But if you do see me healing myself, it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm smart enough to bring a medkit or use pharmacy so i can heal myself quickly without wasting my teams‚Äô time.
---
I have to be to see the mori
---
Because regardless of console, pc or mobile we all deserve the highest renders possible because we are all one giant community.
---
Pink mori's dont do jack if you don't get found or hooked.
---
13th of every month. 
---
Higher red ranks usually take at least five minutes and lower queues are long this far into the season. 
---
The devs keep messing with matchmaking so that‚Äôs probably why it‚Äôs super long.
---
Please, no killer is dumb enough to believe this baby Dwight shit.
---
I just threw up
---
As opposed to the insane advantages survivors always have...
---
If Myers stares at you he becomes more powerful. You have to break line of sight with him instead of staring back
---
Thanks mate. Top tip!
---
Often lol. Either I run to the bathroom or to make coffee. Then I hear all sorts of weird shit and have to Forrest Gump it back to the tv
---
Cool
---
Yeah there are definetely worse games
---
You're correct.
---
It is a bug, restart your game
---
You're playing on console (where Hag is FREE) and say the game is P2W, and use Ruin as an example. Now I know this is just a shitpost.
---
This sub is very killer sided so some will say yes but it‚Äôs really not. This Spirit choose to tunnel Jake the whole game. Unless Jake started teabagging Spirit for no reason then you guys are the toxic ones but if he played normally then fuck this Spirit
---
On mobile there is no cap to bloodpoints. I‚Äôm at like 2 million right now on mobile.
---
üòÇüòÇ that's genius
---
;(
---
there might not be fully infinites, but they might as well keep that name when you can make a huntress waste over 3 minutes in one place no matter what she does just to hit you once
---
oh i didnt know that thanks
---
Ya, this was an extremely good team in altruistic category but did gens at the same time so we was able to take hits for each other which is why none of us died. I was on hook two minutes before the video happened and she was straight up face camping but lucky my team all came in at once and got me off
---
Not necessarily. It lasts for a full minute after being unhooked, that's an eternity in this game. I've often found that that's enough time to run away, get healed, wait for someone else to get hooked, and then come back to unhook them with borrowed time, and use decisive to remove the risk to you, then both of you run out the door.
---
It's going to be hard to going up against a significantly better player and the crutch of SWF
---
Maybe stop running around like a chicken with your head cut off. I will never understand this mentality people have that stealth is bad in this game. 
---
Have had multiple matches against killers where they hooked maybe 2 people and we all got out - oh, they had iri mori. Sucks to be them! 
---
Yet you talk like the offering instantly breaks the game in favor of killers...
---
No? Body blocking is a totally viable and useful strategy, do it always lol
---
i see thanks
---
I'm talking about when you arent slugging but if I down someone and I see you trying to pallet save, flashlight save or just being around, am I supposed to ignore you?
---
thank you! Very cool
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
That is an absurdly high cap. What catagory would you propose gets doubled for killer to compensate?
---
other day i got targeted by a julie and no one even tried to help she wouldnt go after anyone else
---
Honestly, it means I get more points for hooking you a 4th time and you're not running a Haddonfield offering, do it.
---
Not only do you have my blessing to use that, you have my encouragement.
---
Ya that‚Äôs what I figure because if you look at the end of the video I get blood points for it
---
Im pretty sure the entity corrupts the place lore wise,by f.e. putting hooks everywhere,having mist on the map,and stuff like the images
---
specially me
---
i depipped twice bc a julie wouldnt go after anyone but m2 lmao caus3e i dipped
---
Unless you pull an Epstein and disconnect
---
Nah, youre good
---
The entity feeds on fear and despair. Why wouldn't it make the areas a bit extra spoopy?
---
I hate when that happens
---
why teabag tho

Every video game may have it, but only in DBD is there the one loner who can't teabag back. Name another game where one side can teabag and you can't.
---
is wraith easy?
---
The post has the game implying its toxic or op. Also at higher ranks you get at least 2 p3 claudettes. If they bring family residence offerings, then usually the whole team brings p3 claudettes. Being immersed dowsnt get shit done but when the killer has to walk into every bush to feel for collision instead of seeing you then even immersed players can get shit done. Even the top killers like billy and nurse have a tough time cause nurse relies on line of sight and loses that with the billion props on the map and there arent many lanes for billy to traverse the map with. Even with spirit I  have a tough time cause you can barely see scratch marks behind all the shrubs.
---
I, as a rank 1 Piggy enthusiast, feel like she only needs 2 changes. Make it where she only roars after filling the meter for ambush charge instead of having her roar as the meter fills. And make the Jigsaw boxes truly RNG. The way they work now is that a Jigsaw box is chosen for a survivor during the loading screen, and that one Jigsaw box will always have their key for the duration of the match. I feel like they should change it to where the game only randomly chooses a box once a RBT has been place on a survivor's head, and that if another RBT is placed on that survivor that the game will randomly choose a different box to have their key.
---
Besides that I think Pig is in a pretty good spot. I think she's one of the strongest M1 killers simply because she has so much utility built into her base kit. Her add-ons could probably use a little tweaking to be more beneficial or gameplay altering, but besides that there's not much wrong with her. 
---
I see a lot of people claim that Pig is weak or has been "nerfed into the ground" but that's a bunch of bullocks. She's definitely upper-mid tier at least. Them changing her traps so they don't arm during endgame was a necessary change. Otherwise Pig would be too strong. Even if you made it so the Collapse timer slowed while someone had a RBT on it'd still be too strong. Pig could just camp the Jigsaw boxes if she doesn't hook/kill the person or if they don't D/C. It wouldn't be fair or fun. You shouldn't be rewarded free and easy kills just because you still have RBTs at endgame. You're suppose to use the traps to slow the game down to prevent it from getting to endgame. 
---
But that's just my two cents
---
Brutality, maybe. Most of your points should come from whacking the survivors anyway, not sacrificing. At higher ranks sacrificing most of the survivors gets increasingly difficult
---
I just went up again this same mess, baby plague and all, it sucks man.
---
1. Okay..?
---
2. It needs to happen sometime considiring how big this game is.
---
Kinda. They're complete new cars, with different skins for it. They are still cheaper then skins in dbd
---
Yeah, maybe just an increase to 10-12k. But killer doesn‚Äôt need compensation. You guys literally already get 20k a game if you don‚Äôt play like morons. Survivors get 20k if they play their ass off. So no.
---
Really? That would be funny if you did, just had the motto that Killers just shake off all the hate and toxicity they get from toxic survivors and just keep having fun. So if you‚Äòd do that you‚Äòd be a legend for me
---
meh i dont think you should use DS off the start, considering if you dont the killer wont know you have it and if you get farmed again and have to get out you have it to thelp you still instead of just using it to gain a feww meters of distance
---
Jabaited
---
Don‚Äôt know actually
---
Far, far too many.
---
What was that nightstand he was standing next to at the beggining? I've never once seen that
---
Me
---
i had a ghostface get stuck and we helped him get unstuck then he just killed everyone so i teabagged him at the hatch cause come on
---
There doesn't exist a single loop strong enough to justify a 3 minute chase with no hits.  This would be the killer making a series of mistakes to extend said chase for 3 minutes.  Also 3 minutes of chasing the same person God damn....know when to break off a chase to pressure gens.  It would be way way before the 3 minute mark.

That's the whole point. I really love this game. That'a whg I am so pissed about certain desicions. If I didn't like the game I would've never made such a time consuming post
---
Who hurt you man, I know reddit is the place to project but this is the wrong sub.
---
I wish I'd known about this sub sooner. Thanks!
---
Kono, Giorno Giovanna, niwa yume ga aru
---
I definitely don‚Äôt agree with corrupt intervention being a wasted slot on her. Watch fungoose‚Äôs video on plague, he has 7k hours and mains plague
---
When this will be released?
---
my ps username is pixiechains, add me when you wanna play
---
An absolute madlad
---
That's a fair point, I went from the list of survivors on wiki, but it doesn't help I'm used to just Bill from the L4D days.
---
pixiechains
---
No, as soon as I heard the music I bought him too, and I used to play old Freddy but I don‚Äôt like the new one, so now he‚Äôs my main
---
Lol... Yes he is,and very fun also
---
It's weird.  When you're watching a survivor streamer it seems like their teammates are doing nothing.  When you watch a killer streamer it seems like gens are popping left and right.
---
Here's the full vido n yt btw lol  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYMvr2GuwmY&amp;t=19s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYMvr2GuwmY&amp;t=19s)
---
hmm...
---
ok fine, ill ship it.
---
Current Objective:
---
Survive
---
Great job on this
---
It's definitely not the worst map. That award goes to shelter woods.
---
I‚Äôve had him since his release on console, but never really played him all that much; methinks I need to rectify that.
---
It's ok to use the cosmetics once in a while, but P3 makes you dissapear
---
I don‚Äôt see a problem with Peppa to be honest. She‚Äôs 7 foot 1.
---
did she eventually come back?
---
Yea you should all just DC. This is one of those extremely rare circumstances I support it. Don‚Äôt let the dude get his jollies by doing that.
---
oof i just realized when i say "meant nfor twitter" i mean the preeview the full vid on yt lol
---
Only to hope you haven't been hooked yet
---
Body blocking = perfectly fine. 
---
Teabagging at the exit = you're a childish idiot.
---
Think that pretty much covers it.
---
What did you do to my boy?!
---
new survivor leaked: cameraman nelson
---
Yeah it happens often. He'd purposely block stairways even as the game starts.
---
Because licensing? Jason got his own entire game.
---
Videos like this are referred to as b-roll. It's basically behind the scenes footage. Specifically, youtube 'Halloween B-Roll' to see some more behind the scenes footage of this film. It's called Halloween (2018).
---
Jason's copyright situation is so mucked up, they can't even put Jason in the Friday the 13th game anymore. No way in hell is he going to make it to another game.
---
Can he double jump off walls like in l4d?
---
Well, unfortunately this guy goes unpunished if the others didn't bother to report in-game as well.
---
Even if you leave the game, you still have access to the scoreboard so I don't know how you couldn't report him. Reporting on Steam doesn't do anything I'm afraid.
---
I have seen that move in dragon ball z, bleach and so on and so on. 
---
She must have mastered it to make it look so clean though
---
I know all that, but those places DO exist 
---
Grim Pantry's big house on the Backwater Swamp is one of those. You wouldn't believe how strong this place can be. it has 3 strong window loops that can be chained together, with a few pallets that can be used if you happen to fuck up and when ran correctly, the killer can't mindgame you there all. also, when looping one window, the "3 vault limit" recharges on the others. Add balanced landing to that and you got yourself an infinite.
---
it isn't as easy as it used to be (running one window around, lol) but there STILL ARE infinites in the game
---
Nope. She disconnected later. RIP.
---
That camera could be really cool, it'd be a nice way to counteract stalking/stealth. It would definitely make playing with Ghostface more interesting.
---
Yessss he's always been on my shortlist for IP characters I want in the game. I'd imagine it would be very difficult for them to implement his lunch in a satisfying way, but it'd be so much fun!
---
‚ÄúWhere is she? I can‚Äôt see her...‚Äù
---
Idk the camera idea would fit, it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs any service in there, and maybe not a smoke machine, but like a smoke bomb would work
---
Go to his account and spam the follow/unfollow button for a minute. It will leave it popping off on his screen and phone for a half hour lmao. Just spam it for a minute.
---
Just played Huntress for the first time in forever. Popped a pudding and had a good game. With every pallet loop and immediate unhook I felt my aim return to me and I avoided the dumpster fire I thought I was going to be.
---
W h y i s y o u r u s e r redsquirrel
---
yeah wanted to report him in post game though but the nea that was outside didnt open the gates cause she was stupid so no post game report for me :/
---
This happens to me too when I get killer dailies, I chased a Jeff on Michael for half of the game to make sure I would get my points without even swinging and in post game he yelled at me for being shit and tunneling even after I was being playful and thanking him for the daily. Like... People have a vendetta against fun after so many hours I guess ?
---
It's the entity  coming to destroy  your game and take your soul. Run while you still can!
---
The actor for the Shape in this movie is James Jude Courtney. Nick Castle has a cameo in the film when he is shown in the mirror in one scene but that is it.
---
Thank you Gojemba!
---
Toxic is an overused term tbf
---
Yep, wish it wasn‚Äôt like that. I wish killers had more power against teams of good survivors, but sadly most of the time that‚Äôs not the case, just finished a game where against legion where every teammate refused to do anything unless they were healed, also I did 3/4 of the gens that were done solo cuz they didn‚Äôt know how to do ruin. Luckily I got hatch after they farmed each other and died.
---
That's a good one, maybe he could but it would increase the cooldown between lunges
---
I start off not camping and tunneling. Click a flashlight or excessively tbag at each pallet I will tunnel you. I won't camp cause that's what they want so I let their friends win. I will tunnel them tho and remove them as fast as I can so I can have a normal match with the rest. If I realize which one was the baby player I will give them hatch unless they are learning BM from their toxic boost ranked friend.
---
Overcharge is crap compared to pop. The skill check is so damn easy
---
This is a perfect example of the guy that texts "Reported" or "toxic" look how mad he got that he is stalking my acct. Keep going playboy. You just keep proving my point. Sorry I like to work on my days off and earn extra money lol. Better than sitting at home on my fat ass texting Toxic all day. Lol. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Wtf
---
Nah, if you do one thing the whole game, you get less bp, that‚Äôs how it works, I commonly max out my objectives category because I repair gens the whole game
---
No, no, no. Unless you pull an Epstein and your _mom_ disconnects you. C'mon now, we all know he didn't disconnect himself.
---
They should put splinters for all licensed AND give them all 3 of their perks rank 3 so everyone can get adept.
---
I generally don't tunnel because I want them to have fun. But if they clearly don't want to have fun and just want to be a douche bag to me and their teammates, I'm happy to oblige.
---
the horse will die both ways if he tried to capture the tower first(which is haunted grounds)
---
so hes fucked no matter what
---
I cherish the games where I either neutral out or depip. I despise fighting red rank survivors and their 4 man meta perk ‚ÄúI‚Äôve played the game for 1500 hours and know every pallet spawn on a first name basis.‚Äù Crap. Especially since so many seem to be swf with voice chat and I like playing killers like plague or legion rather than nurse or spirit all the time.
---
Now someone add the Wraith but it‚Äôs just two blank pictures.
---
someone explain plz
---
Piggybacking a bit here. I personally use Franklin's Demise, Pop Goes the Weasel, Monitor and Abuse, and BBQ when I play Plague, and I regularly 3/4K when I play her. You could feasibly swap out Franklin's Demise for something else if the survivors don't seem to be bringing in items.
---
As for add-ons, I have to disagree with you on infection times. It's especially effective in lower ranks (20-10) because newbie survivors won't often touch generators that are infected, and sometimes they'll just wait for it to disappear before working on it again. In higher rank games, it's more useful as a detection tool, because you'll know where brazen survivors are when they suddenly become infected, so long as you're keeping mental note of the generators you barf on.
---
I do agree that the time reduction for charging is one of her better add-ons, and I feel it's incredibly important to have it on her if you plan to play her seriously at all.
---
No, it's because a killer has to do about half the work. So much strawman. i love the mori animations. i just hate how easy it is to get it.
---
Just use batteries and you will be fine
---
Lmao you're the definition of a toxic whiner dude. I love how you just say dumb shit cause you cant even add to a conversation. Pretty sure you're the exact same as you described in your post.
---
Haha. Look at his face when he know he fkd up lol
---
I slaughtered a team of survive with friends and let the last one go, they added me and now I have more friends.
---
Yikes.
---
Honestly, killers always claim that survivors should ‚Äújust cleanse totems.‚Äù But solo survivors have no way of knowing how many totems are left.
---
I knew it was this before it loaded
---
If you think that's going on then sure, I don't want to interrupt your imaginations. And that's what reddit is for, or are you too new to understand that? And playgirl, but I can see you are neglected of that too. Proving your point of what? I'm curious friend because all I can see is someone having a wobbly on the internet and as funny as it is it's a little sad. And Amazon delivering packages isn't proper work my petal, and you say that, but that's literally what you've just done.
---
Since it's Sunday I'm going to assume you're just bored and want attention? And you choose the dbdl sub to do that? That's literally like the kid too scared to say anything who then goes home and punches a dry wall.
---
Don't be a Kyle man, I know your upset but it's okay.
---
i just spent 30 minutes making this
---
Tier 3 Boil Over.
---
You‚Äôve never seen a killer move the mori to the basement hook to kill in front of the 2nd stage survivor have you?
---
Fog machines would be a fun addition defiintely!
---
Which part specifically? Everything had it‚Äôs own dates.
---
The game always favors survivors. If you think otherwise, you're either ignorant or new to the game in general. 
---
Again - mori's do jack shit, if you aren't found (or if you are found, otherwise escape before getting downed). Stop running around like a chicken with its head cut off, and see how much better you do! If the Killer is "easily" getting mori's off, you're doing something wrong.
---
Or better yet, make a movie about the game itself and actually add some lore to it
---
That's a very good point. I started playing around the very end of the summer event, and at that point I legitimately thought they always had these Gruesome Gateaus year round so I took em for granted (I only played Survivor at this point). 
---
I dont know if I've seen much 2x BP events or whatever since then, but seeing as you have a lot more experience, I can see where you're coming from. My points weren't coming from a place of pure entitlement, but more from naivety and wanting to genuinely see what the community's thoughts were on it. Although you went about your point in a more colorful way than I would have hoped, I definitely understand your point and can see where I was wrong. 
---
Thanks for setting me straight, Bobbers! :D
---
I'm somewhat fascinated by OP. I thought people like this were myths
---
That‚Äôs when I just disconnect lol I‚Äôd rather keep my BPS
---
Another m1 killer.
---
Time well spent.
---
You tried, but no lol
---
I actually really started to feel bad for this guy, because you have to be a certain type of person to go off like this. He sent me 4 screenshots of his best killer games, I‚Äôm assuming.
---
Anyway, we should all be playing the game to have fun, not to stomp our nameless enemies‚Äô faces into the ground through a video game. I didn‚Äôt try to act like a cocky killer or anything, I actually pride myself that I play very fair and I actually usually let the last person escape if I know where the trap door is. I don‚Äôt play for points anymore, I just play for fun.
---
Yep, this is why I play killer more these days, and if I play survivor, I play swf and all people run burrowed time and ds because it just unplayable. Oh well, BHVR don't see a problem, they can see their game die slow death.
---
I‚Äôm genuinely surprised that there‚Äôs such a stereotype around Claudette‚Äôs because I prefer to main her. Just because she‚Äôs better for hiding. But I still play as I would any other character and often times will sacrifice myself in order to save my team. Cause it‚Äôs a team game.
---
There‚Äôs also a shit ton of posts about toxic survivors and most of all...SWF though. SWF complaints is the most popular topic in this sub.I would say it‚Äôs pretty split overall. By comparison to the official forums though, then sure this place would appear survivor sided. That place is insanely killer biased, so people who play survivor are more likely to post here. It‚Äôs really the only place to post, unless you are in the mood to get mocked and fight with people who think looping is toxic or that nurse is an example of balance.
---
Ok
---
Don't teach manners
---
That was really emotional
---
I think it's called the Glass Bead, an add-on that lets the user place a light beam visible for all survivors.
---
Be toxic to toxic people, nothing wrong with that.
---
I thought there weren‚Äôt any crowd on Coldwind? Or am I thinking of a different map.
---
Its just a marker addon for the map. If you have the add on you can place that beam anywhere on the map and everyone but the killer can see it.
---
I haven't played today.
---
Dodged another stressful toxic electronic interaction!
---
&gt; The game always favors survivors. If you think otherwise, you're either ignorant or new to the game in general.
---
lol, cant be arsed to actually back i up after we know survivors die more often than not.
---
&gt; if you aren't found (or if you are found,
---
"hide better"
---
You're a moron, im out. What a waste of time you are.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to be a twat, this Reddit is just over run with arrogance sometimes and i let it get to me. 
---
But the 2x events are annually and they usually happen on holidays, I don‚Äôt remember if there was a 2x for winter but there was definitely a event. Same with Halloween I think.
---
And yea I‚Äôve been playing since launch but I still play like a turd, it‚Äôs frustrating seeing hard work and passion go into free events and 2x points and THEN someone on Reddit is unhappy with 10$ cosmetic outfits so a COMPANY can profit and dish out more content ( I have at least 2-3 outfits on every female character and killer so I don‚Äôt mind paying and it fucking supports the devs!!!)
---
NOED in a Michael with dying light... Yeah he deserved that...
---
If the killer camped and tunnel me.. I‚Äôm t bagging them!
---
Matchmaking is all fucky rn. Keep getting teamed with rank 20-18 survivors while a rank 10 survivor.
---
Yea that is partially true but most have 32 meter range and monitor only changes that by 8 meters so it mostly only viable for Michael to counter it or others with small terror radius‚Äô
---
Exactly lol
---
that pallet perk is bonkers
---
Lmmfao. You are soooooo mad right now.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Just started playing this game. My name is Gabe...
---
I love the irony of you going with the full on strawman now yourself. 
---
You're...going to take the words of BHVR to heart. The same people who can't ever update their own game without breaking something. 
---
..........
---
I mean, that right there shows your own ignorance, quite frankly, lol.
---
What about survivors?
---
If you're complaining about the base cost of the game, you have some other issues. Hag and Ruin are INCLUDED in the base price of the game on console.
---
The game is free on xbox with Game Pass, and was recently free with PS+.
---
Annoying for the killer? Sure. Toxic? Not at all. In fact protection blood points are awarded for it and certain perks mesh with it. Devs fully endorse this kind of play. Just don‚Äôt get mad when killers start running NoED in response to it ha.
---
Lmfao you must be 12 with them emojis. You dont even know what mad is if you think I am. I know a stupid troll when I see one why do I care what you say? Anyway unlike you I have better things to do than troll. Peace out little man.
---
As a survivor main I hate/love them lol. I didn‚Äôt think they were in the game still until Freddy came out then I kept thinking everyone was bringing Moro‚Äôs with the new Freddy until I saw after the game was over.
---
Well.... I have a splinter for mike.... on mike.... and i bought the full dlc
---
I've been having this shit happen a lot on survivor side. Had a rank 13 killer but all of my teammates were like rank 5-7.
---
Have a great day little boy
---
I feel bad for the fresh new rank 20 learning how to play the game and gets thrown against a experienced killer. Poor baby being used for his rank üòï
---
Wish I had rank 20 friends
---
Stop
---
Well, aura reading, specially at that distance can be game changing.
---
I  remember this claudette (legacy costume nonetheless) I found in the killer shack, she jumped out of a window, when she saw that I moved from the window, she tought I was going to chase, so she tried to slow vault back, I downed her and she DC'ed. (first survivor found)
---
Once you reach rank 2/3/4 is there really a need to worry about pips anymore on killer side? Being in red puts you against reds/high purple anyway and being rank 2 vs 3 is no discernible difference. You‚Äôve already made it to the top of the food chain, you can just play normally at that point and just coast.
---
"Look! Look! Over there!"
---
Technically that‚Äôs correct - should have been a rank 7/8 to be perfect matchmaking. 
---
Still annoying tho.
---
Discordance never works for me, they rarely do gens together with Ruin
---
Will do. I'm not upset enough to post about whiners so I'd say my days going a lot better than yours. Thanks for the entertainment while I browsed reddit lmfao.
---
Anybody who does this are also the type of people who claim artists should do work for them for the "exposure". They can't be arsed to do something themselves, but they have absolutely no qualms about bashing or belitting other people for having the passion or desire to do it.
---
The Myers is a spy!
---
Ok, will do thanks
---
That hand...
---
Shit so I‚Äôve been playing the worst killer
---
I don‚Äôt find Legion likeable whatsoever, I just feel like there‚Äôs something lacking with him I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on.
---
you simply helped your team out, don't feelsbadman
---
Forgot which streamer but he did exactly that. Or at least something similar.
---
He just went creative mode it's all good.
---
thats a doctor addon, its meant to trick you into thinking hes right behind you but he most likely isnt
---
Fucking hate when im running meta killer perks and i get bullied anyway in red ranks and im told to get better perks :(
---
But the clown does have a white mask.
---
Killer probably had franklin's demise and we all know the flashlight warriors cannot livez without dey flashlightz!
---
3 2‚Äôs should never go up against a 10. Idc if the 20 was there to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù it out lol this shouldn‚Äôt be happening. Eh at least you got 2 kills
---
Forgot Zepp
---
You should cash app me $10 for making your day
---
Hag throws her nip at you.
---
I doubt this happened to you
---
Never  thought  that'd  work  in  a  million  years.
---
Always shocked me why there's no way to jump down from the top level.
---
Maybe that's my problem. I feel like I don't run but in my panic of seeing spine chill go off I probably sprint a little bit lol
---
Well, they have no control over what Nea does. It‚Äôs not their fault that Nea didn‚Äôt choose to open the exit gates. Also, if you have to capitalize toxicity into guaranteeing a 3k, then you take this game extremely seriously. Not a big brain move; just being an asshole.
---
For now. My cat may be plotting to kill me if he doesnt get dinner soon though.
---
Lol who wants to bet that this guy is a toxic killer main and has never tried to play a game for fun ever. "Body blocking and exploiting the games shitty mechanics is a justified tactic" lole
---
I hear what you mean about getting up to R1, but like I said, what‚Äôs the point after you get to red? Even if you safety in reds you don‚Äôt really gain anything anymore progressing forward. At that point, the 4K is all the reward you need cause of matchmaking. 
---
Also the 4k into blackpip is kinda odd because I know the games scoring system can be kinda wonky, you know? Like not every 4K was beyond a skill-showing game and without being able to see the individual matches it‚Äôs hard to rationalize how it happens.
---
Noed
---
If he got out the hatch the first game, that means he only got 2k points throughout the entire match lmao
---
Try to get directly behind survivors before you puke on them. With one/both of the vase add ons that speed up infection time you can break them instantly and get a hit on them if done correctly
---
That nea needs to be reported as well tbh.
---
While you are right, I meant this for the newbie spirits. If you're new to spirit, I would try to avoid phasing to a healthy survivor. You should try it sometimes when you're more experienced, but imo, if you're new, try avoiding it. I usually only mind game survivors if I phase to them while healthy, like at an infinite, I can trick them into vaulting into me.
---
I think every new player ever had this idea until they learned how strong some pallets are.
---
Theres to much bullshit on ps4 for the ranking system to be strict. The game itself is non consistent so the pips shouldn‚Äôt require consistency.
---
Me too..
---
Zepp wasn't an apprentice. He was a test subject.
---
That's just their current roadmap.  This game ain't going anywhere they own the market for this particular niche.  You'll see more survivors and killers for sure.
---
Pallets are strong, but I would love to have a new item in the the game. It‚Äôs just the only thing that doesn‚Äôt seem covered.
---
Well, it will happen again from what I hear.
---
 In my last 3 days playing killer. I haven't gotten any salty messages, except for some dude who rage quit, when I was planning to let them all escape. 
---
I always try to message the killer to ask them something, but most killers are super sensitive to messages, they block anyone from messaging them. I would simply just ignore the salty players.
---
mmu
---
ah yes, the ole "toxic perk" argument. 
---
A player using a perk you don't like definitely justifies BM.
---
i main wraith for the bing bongs
---
Interesting to think many of the pigs are likely in another ‚Äògame‚Äô, like what was shown in saw 3.
---
The plag, because I like her playstyle, an to be honest, without the corruption (which kinda gets covered in prestige outfits), she is Supermodel tier in looks.
---
Survivors: David, because he has a badass jacket and he is a badass.
---
Michael solely because of the music 
---
DNANANANANANANANANANANANANANANAN
---
Wow you use your killer ability?  Holy fuck your toxic.  This is worse than the Wraiths who cloak, or the Trappers who trap, or the Hags that Hag.  I bet you run perks and addons too.  Soooooooo tryhard man.  /s
---
In my own humble opinion of playing killer at red ranks for a time if someone DCs 1 minute into the game as you say then it nearly almost results in a black pip even if you 3k at that point. I think both sides suffer from this equally
---
Is that a motherfrickin warframe reference
---
I main hag because I like how they teleport.
---
I've always liked the game. I really hope they put more urban/warehouse/factory-esque maps in. I'm kind of tired of the same old field/bushes/wooden building map.
---
Hag because it makes me feel like a mastermind even tho I'm just a toxic scum
---
Yeah. I play solo too, I'm just a steady rank 14/15 so far cause I don't play much and to be fair I am not super good either, and the guys I get matched with are terrible. It's even worse when I play killer, I'm still a rank 16 (I used to be a survivor main) and frequently get SWF groups composed of rank 10 and above.
---
Fun fact: They start bitching and moaning in post-game if you manage to kill 50% of their group.
---
I mean if they tbag you, you can just kill them lol

---
Hoffman built them to.  (Pendulum trap, Water box trap was supposed to be unsolvable, etc.)
---
Not at the exit gates.
---
well that was deep
---
Don‚Äôt try to break someone? Could you explain that logic?
---
They can crawl out of the hate within 60 seconds.
---
Yeah but then two survivors are wasting time which makes the game easier for her.
---
Im depipping the hell out of my killer rank using pig, #FuckRedRank
---
I'm aware, but unless they gave express permission to completely make fun of it, people should respect it. It's just like that Meme that says making fun of Legion cosplays makes people not want to cosplay anymore
---
Hillbilly because of the insane mobility and one shot down potential, it‚Äôs also so satisfying when you across map chainsaw a survivor!
---
Except every time you try to slug them they just run into a locker. Maybe it shouldn't proc on grabs like BT.
---
Was it always like that?
---
Legion because I love all the different skin options and for a survivor I main Meg.
---
El tiene que ser un ni√±o rata que no sabe perder.
---
Holy fuck that White Ward though lol!  Good thing he protected that gem.  Wouldn't want to lose that God tier item setup.
---
&gt;there isn't a reason stop stick around, so it goes largely unnoticed
---
Seems like the same situation, just join a new game
---
Yeah, the matchmaking is pretty wonky, I‚Äôve never had it get this mismatched though unless running into swf groups. 
---
The game ended in roughly 5 minutes with one hook.
---
I think it's a bit redundant honestly, but like, fuck. People in this community have a horrible fucking tendency to blame the players for using shit they think is unbalanced. Complain at the devs, why the hell would you blame a killer or survivor for using perks they think are good or the best?
---
A perk that allows you to prop up pallets that have been slammed but not broken
---
and you can lose your offerings and items sometimes so that's fucking cool
---
Trouble is. When that surge of Legion cosplay mockers showed up... I didn't see any actual Legion cosplays before that was recent. So they were really just shitting on each other.
---
I think the BM was just like a ‚Äúhahaha I totally just did that!‚Äù But I‚Äôm just an innocent survivor that says gg every game no matter what and my tea bagging is done out of amazement. I cleanse full totems for BP and in case noed, so if survivors don‚Äôt want noed, just cleanse totems. Ez does it, noed no longer exists
---
Take discordance and monitor, focus on spreading disease to multiple people before downing them
---
the pallet one would be just broken
---
I play enough of both sides to understand the arguments of each, and honestly what they're complaining about half the time isn't even that bad.

On the survivor side, I see a lot of "NOED is for baby's, can't play without your ruin that's pathetic, wow overpowered add-ons what a surprise" sure those things can be annoying, but most of them have drawbacks. Cleanse totems, or know the weaknesses of the addons the killer may be using. Most high rarity add-ons (at least for the killers I play, this may not be universally true) have some kind of drawback. For example, leatherfaces award winning chili. Greatly increases chainsaw acceleration but makes it stun you longer when you hit shit. Try to get him to bump into an object when he's chasing you.
---
On the killer side it's a lot of the same stuff "adrenaline is a crutch, decisive strike exists REEEE, how dare you use dead hard to make it to that pallet and then feed it to me" adrenaline is a reward for survivors doing well. If they repair all the gens, they've earned it. Just like how your NOED is a reward for YOU doing bad and not stopping the gens. DS only works once, just eat it or slug and get on with your day. Don't lunge right when you get near a survivor until you know if they have dead hard or not.
---
Sorry for the kind of a long rant, I just get tired of this community arguing so much. Just play the game and have fun doing it. If you're feeling particularly nice, don't use things you know upsets the other side. If you do use them, just take all the delicious hatemail salt.
---
I think he's fun but he would be alot more fun if I could do the multiple stabbies like legion use to be.
---
The emblem system is for sure flawed but in situations like this I really want to know what happened in the game. Did you mori 3 people on their second hook? Did you face camp each kill individually and do nothing against gen progression? Did the survivor's DC or never save?
---
Because it seems like it would be pretty hard to depip if you found and chased 3 survivors to death, landed at around 15 hits assuming they never healed depending on exposure/yoinking assuming you never found or hit the guy who got out in order to sacrifice 3 people. And I am guessing you had to use your power a few times and damage a few gens/break a few pallets.Seems like a like of room to at least neutral out on the score screen with 3 kills.
---
Dammit! How 'bout vaults?
---
How is it toxic to block the exit of a room and use your m2 to gain points. Stop just... STAPH!!! he won they lost that's it 3 survivors  I  that house prolly not even a gen in there that's on them. And what house has one exit I've never seen that one
---
Yeah, but the problem is that it's impossible to distinguish that from bm, and people tend to assume the worst when they're losing a survivor. It's just not the best practice. Andi mostly agree with noed, there are other counterplays to it too, i just wish people who thought it was unbalanced would take it out on the devs, not the players. Same goes for survivors with flashlights or DS etc..
---
Real life situation it goes down just like it did 3 trapped and killed one escaped
---
Does brushing my teeth count? Trying to evade a chainsaw sprint my a toothbrush buzzing in my mouth makes it awfully hard to evade. Sooooo. Yeah. Hello hook.
---
The choice of terrible artist makes this a solid watch. 7/10
---
I guess when there's multiple survivors maybe? If there's only one then you should break em
---
Imagine being a adult and enjoying things.
---
Basically when you kick a gen and the sparks start flying out of it its regressing in progress. The last gen or two you kick with surveillance is given a white aura as long as its progressing. When a survivor touches the gen to stop the progression and start working on it again it turns yellow before returning to its normal red aura. (it also turns back red if it finishes its regression all the way back)
---
So you find a gen they have been working on, kick it, and you get a nice aura indicator on whether they are or have touched.
---
It is funny because with plague you don't even need perks to rank up.
---
i think you misunderstand the dinner table cat template
---
Look man, either someone hates it or they don't. But there's very little reason to tbag the opposing side. So please, stop defending it if you think it's so rude. Trying to get explain why being a dick is mean to you, a person who doesn't get that, isn't much fun.
---
You probably wouldn‚Äôt comprehend this, but it would‚Äôve been fine if he did this for a minute or so. And it surely wasn‚Äôt done for farming purposes. He would‚Äôve maxed out by then. The problem that elevates this to toxicity is that he proceeded to do as such for 30 minutes/40; which isn‚Äôt right.
---
I personally did not like that. He's fun now because you have to be more strategic with your stabs. Survivors too far away? Missed a hit? 
---
Risk is in the games name. Before the nerf you stabby stabbed all day long till survivors dc.
---
The Ghostface from dbd isn't connected to the Scream Ghostfaces. So it's only 1 in dbd.
---
ZA WARUDO!
---
On my way to prestiging the Pig, I literally got six splinters for Michael, two for Leatherface, and one for Freddy
---
What do you mean plague is perk reliant? She has a shit ton of map control because she just pukes everything and, as a survivor you either are broken or are facing a S tier killer.
---
Yup, there are annoying perks and addons for both sides, just some people like playing the ones you don‚Äôt and you just gotta deal with it lol I hate ruin, but I deal with it, and my great skill checks have improved drastically because of it! I hate noed and billy, but I learned to loop so much better because of them, I hate the spirit, but because of her my mind gaming has skyrocketed.. just gotta learn to adapt and overcome! :)
---
Got cancer thx
---
I remember my first match against myers. I thought they were friendly. This thought faded as he swung at me while playing the piano
---
Hm.. so.. a silent discordance.
---
Thanataphobia works amazing with Plague.
---
Don‚Äôt want to cleanse yourself from broken? Fine. Enjoy your heavy action-reduction.
---
tunnel vision is bad just allows the other 3 to do gens
---
My Xbox only goes critical when I‚Äôm launching it from another game. If I do it from the home screen it‚Äôs fine

---
I've been flamed for m1 survivors when they ran in an infinite instead of trying to chainsaw them through the window. They said something like "You only use your chainsaw to cut wood."
---
 Which number is that rule?
---
Needless to say, I got 4 or 5 chainsaw downs that game.
---
it also works if only one person touches the gen which is nice
---
your welcome fam.
---
I had a struggle game, one kill with exit gates powered. 
---
Ended up getting two more kills, and got to rank 11! My highest ever!
---
It‚Äôs randomly generated. In my time playing I‚Äôve never had that happen or if it did, I honestly don‚Äôt recall it ever happening,
---
Nurse
---
Hey quick question, when you realize nobody else was going for the guy on the hook why didn't you? Could have easily saved him
---
Thanks amigo any news if Uber Jason is last major update or if they plan on other things to be added?
---
So like I said that was far, but what else should he do while your free survivor sits around doing nothing when the gates can be opened? Like I said entity  be damned if I would have let yall out
---
No. NO. NOOOO!
---
Where's the pitchforks?
---
I mean he does play all killers but he says on stream that currently he‚Äôs a plague main, even though i see him use all of them but anyhow he is still pretty knowledgable on the topic :)
---
Oh yes, we‚Äôve all started there, Some learn quicker than others. I still see rank 1 survivors doing everything all of the above which is amazingly soul crushing.
---
I am also the totem breaker, but I have enough common sense to judge, most times, when the right time to break a Hex is lol
---
S- seven of them???
---
I remember Stu Macher, Billy Loomis, then the DBD version aka Jed Olsen, and if we're counting parodies also the Scary Movie Ghostface. Who are the other 4?
---
You do realize that Steam explicitly asks permission before doing their hardware survey &amp; before sending that info to Valve, while Epic does so without asking?
---
Epic also copies your Steam data (encrypted or not) without even asking the user.
---
She‚Äôs just not for you. I‚Äôve played against quite a few nurses who knew what they were doing at lower ranks. She‚Äôs hard for a reason.
---
"YAAAY IM SAVE-"
---
There‚Äôs 4 Scream movies.
---
Oh I have the common sense, I just like to piss em off lol. ‚ÄúOh hey here‚Äôs a totem‚Äù
---
Friend: ‚ÄúSALTY SONT BREAK THAT‚Äù
---
Me: *totem breaking sound*. *exposed* ‚Äúoops‚Äù
---
I do both but this is good to know, thanks!
---
I don't see how they could state that now, I mean they rewrote the entire premise of Ghostface and the only way to make it the same universe would be to retcon parts of the other movies.
---
Well that took a wholesome turn. Lol
---
Damn, I would like to see a toddler create a good cosplay.
---
...Oh. I know of like 2. Guess I gotta go back to watching some horror movies
---
how can you even sit there for 30+ minutes doing that lol
---
I'm still getting Borderlands 3.
---
I can feel this image

On console she is lol

They do have a knack for dressing up, most kids grow out of it by the time they turn 10.

I'm a Claudette main who plays altruistically, so I'm glad there are others changing the view people have of Claudette

---
So like I said, they can‚Äôt control what the Nea does. I don‚Äôt know what she was doing but the Doctor could‚Äôve attempted to kill those survivors. He did none of those things throughout the match.
---
Yeaw
---
legion, doctor and pre rework freddy
---
Would make sense. But I've seen rank 1 full team of survivors using no perks and add-ons and still wiping the floor.
---
I want that clown skin
---
I wonder what those killer mains thought when they saw ‚ÄúFriends List‚Äù
---
The series was always meant to be just the original trilogy. Sony (I think) produced the first film with a really low budget (which was all that the creators needed anyways) to see how well it would do, and it did great. They bankrolled the next two at a usual budget, and the films did so well that they just asked the creators to keep making more. If you‚Äôre like me and think the series lost its touch (and completely diverted from the original idea) after the first three films, that‚Äôs why
---
Relevant username.
---
Plot twist. Instead of closing the door it's tombstone Myers and he was just building tier
---
Lately I‚Äôve been taking the last survivor to hatch every single game as killer and i‚Äôve found it really gratifying. I‚Äôve been way happier than i am when I get 4 kills.
---
"Standard toxic survivors" for what playing smart? Killers are so entitled calling everything  toxic that doesnt favor them .
---
Jake's got the horses in the back.
---
Recently yeah. What about when I use the search function and I see 100+ legions?
---
you literally stole this it still has a water mark
---
I feel sad for you, but the devs said they were going to fix it
---
Gotta wait for the courts to decide a winner
---
Imagine having to put all that effort into mousing over and reading what perks the killer has???
---
I'm sorry not everyone can read as quickly as you, EiNStEiN
---
I'm a new player and was finally able to finish the ritual where you had to find an item in game &amp; survive with it that I got 1st day, meaning I survived my 1st match!
---
‚ÄúAll my game knowledge came from noob3‚Äù.
---
This is a parody account right?
---
Hahaha, gonna try that strategy, unfortunately I have gotten teams that do cleanse, and believe it or not, that caughts me off ward, that i spent some seconds confused thinking what to do next.
---
Perks look cool, I think I'm going to try them. BTW what do you think of Play with your food, right now it is my favourite perk on her, but maybe I'm just losing time with it,
---
As killer I always ready up last If I do it earlier people leave for some reason
---
Green battery and yellow low amp is the better combination, however it‚Äôs just barely better
---
Hi Gabe
---
Agreed. I don‚Äôt understand why the devs can‚Äôt see the broken logic behind pink Moris taking away half of the survivors life
---
And this why we need a default 'push option', available every two minutes and doesn't affect anything else
---
I like to run Play with your food on her. it gives you super NOED.
---
That is a good idea don't get me wrong, but having built a permanent pallet seems too much. 
---
I suggest having this item build one broken pallet and have it stay up for 10 seconds. Afterwards, the pallet is automatically broken. Add-ons should include:
---
how many pallets can be put up
---
HoW many seconds are added. 
---
Placed pallets are already standing up or already thrown down. (Doubt this would work but hey)
---
Must please Daddy Entity
---
I'm planning to do the same once I get OoO, I'm the worst looper in the red ranks ever, desperately need some practice.  Sucks to be in my team then :/
---
If that helps you sleep at night then go ahead
---
Dear lord.. what have you done.
---
Oopsy poopsy

I love not hearing the hatch when I'm behind a twig of a tree or when the chase music overhears everything else, thanks

I think every cosplay (and pretty much anything in general) is open to criticism. If you're showing something off to a community, you can't expect them to congratulate you if it's not well done or something is very off about it. The cosplayer themself has said it was bad (personally I find it kind of odd yet scary looking) and objectively speaking, it is noticeably different from the actual design.
---
Listen, its NEA's fault
---
Legion feels like he's in a good spot. 
---
Doctor does feel the need of a buff (rework perhaps )?
---
Also were you in that game?
---
A bit, sure, but it's not exactly bad on him.
---
Myers has an ass early game, so gens can just fly by.
---
He's stealthy in T2, so being able to pop around a corner and oneshot is strong.
---
He doesn't necessarily have time to stalk in the endgame, since that could very well give them time to use Lithe or BL and run out the gate.
---
If you *do* manage to stalk in the endgame, the extra speed works with your extended lunge to make it go even further.
---
that post is right above this one on my home page
---
Dude I have one for pig yooo
---
You thinking you have enough authority to label a hobby useless not only makes you a sad adult, but a pathetic one as well.
---
Godette
---
I was wondering why they would boycott, forgot all about the epic games bs
---
yeah definitely wasn't saying it's bad, gives you more exposed time. I don't play Myers so i'm really just talking out my ass here, i would think that since you already have plenty exposed time you might want to run other perks? but noed doesn't seem like a bad choice at all, just not one of the first things i would have thought to put on him
---
Most dbd players are cunts sadly
---
I'm sorry they said that to you
---
Also I'm sorry this game is unbalanced piece of shit 99% of the time
---
I really hope one day it'll be fair for everyone but highly doubt it
---
But you need your treatment. He's going to make you better again.
---
How? üòÇ
---
The wraith was coming this direction going for the unhook would have been suicide.
---
Yea, I‚Äôm typing this on my phone; autocorrected.
---
Red-Purple ranks be like ‚ÄúYou got 4 kills? Okay here‚Äôs your pip-WOAH WAIT A MINUTE DID YOU LET THEM HEAL 3 TIMES? WHAT THEY DID 4 GENS? Entity displeased try again you fucking loser‚Äù
---
Ummm, blame the killer as well. Whether I was in that game simply does not deny the fact that the Doctor was an asshole for doing what he did. He lost the game and decided to exploit in order to take the upper hand. I am not going to keep arguing about this lmfaooo. Serves no purpose
---
That is made with cheat engine, and it‚Äôs possible in vanilla game. You may unlock any cosmetic without buying it, and you may unlock cosmetics for other killers as well. Spiritbilliy that was posted a few weeks ago is made from abusing the same glitch.
---
I would absolutely love to see everyone you mentioned, especially Chris Walker. His mori would be brutal and he is the most iconic Outlast bad guy.
---
Its so killers get faster lobbies would you rather wait 20 minutes or 5?
---
‚ÄúStandard toxic survivor message‚Äù I said nothing about how they played, I‚Äôm referring to the messages i get sent after they escape.
---
That is by and far the kindest and least self centered thing I've ever seen a claudette do.
---
What? How does this sorcery even work? Please send a sc
---
I believe if the trap was on your head at the end of the trial it just activated and killed you.
---
Honestly never played enough with Pigs/  I was very prepared to get the trap off the second I was unhooked.
---
Unless I‚Äôm in a 4 man I will wait until the spirit is mid chase and already hurt the person they‚Äôre chasing then cleanse it. Unless potatoes run into her giving her free downs she‚Äôll only still get the one she was chasing and about to down anyways and now I don‚Äôt need to worry about my teammates thinking ‚ÄúOhhhhh shiny totem‚Äù when it‚Äôs a more demanding time like mid save or before someone‚Äôs been hit.
---
.... if they are already hooked twice im just gonna put their ass on another hook 9/10 it's faster than the kill animation
---
It's an ultra rare bro and making it only after 2 hooks it's like what is even the point 
---
Maybe make a pink mori only let you kill 2 survivors instead of 4?
---
So we all just gonna ignore that rank 12 running Lithe AND Balanced Landing?
---
As people ready up it should knock time off the clock.
---
I‚Äôm in Canada and so far it‚Äôs been a bit of nice an bad
---
Ok I was gonna say you didn‚Äôt deserve that DC but I would have if I was that last survivor because you were being cancer. Just hook the last guy like Jesus that‚Äôs just stupid. You clutched it, accept the win and move on
---
When I get an object I instantly know who to avoid before a few pallets are done.
---
Bruh I hate when that happens then I end up ranking down cause they fucked me over lol

He didn't lose he got a 2 k and a quitters bonus
---
Git gud and stop complaining
---
When you get into a lobby with the toxic survivors who destroyed you last game
---
Instead of him being able to replace a pallet for each one destroyed, I'd recommend it to where he gets a new pallets for every 2 pallets destroyed so that he can't keep replacing pallets constantly.
---
Just incase you didn't know these animations happen when a survivor's connection to the killer stalls out.
---
In other words she lagged the fuck out lol
---
His pp touched her too later virgins

Why is it that ‚ÄúEntity Displeased‚Äù feels so much worse than ‚ÄúDead‚Äù or ‚ÄúSacrificed.‚Äù I‚Äôd argue it feels worse than ‚ÄúYou Lose,‚Äù ‚ÄúDefeat,‚Äù or ‚ÄúFailure‚Äù would.
---
doctor is bad bcuz the slow i get when zapping makes it so that the survivors can just do an another loop. legion is a m1 killer with a 1st hit ability

I know u didnt say anything about the Playstyle but u wouldn't warn them that ur gonna start tunneling survivors If they played in ur favor . And there is Something called ignoring them lmao .

He has scratched mirror and realized the survivors spotted him is all!

Facts. I had one message me telling me I must be scared of him and no I just dont want to deal with flashlights at every pallet and looping for 4 gens.

Thank god its a shitpost I like to have at least a slim chance of escaping

That's called hacking, I just would like to have custom skins (for example transforming base trapper in a batman trapper or smth)

Plague, leatherface, Clown
---
The fact that the devs still haven‚Äôt added a place to jump off is appalling
---
That's what he wants though. Killers get a BP reward for DCs. It's not as much, but he's essentially just 'captured' his 4K.
---
You do you chief. Just try and see that there is more to this game than just outscoring survivors/killers and getting 4K‚Äôs /escaping every single game. You can have fun in this game, exploiting ain‚Äôt it.

sorry for the late reply, turns out i still haven't heard from the devs but my game seems to be working now. i honestly dont know how but its been working the last 3 or so days. i had gotten the initialization error since then but it was only once and i pressed A to sign in again and it let me play. i swear it's like this game has a mind of its own

The movies were practically done when Amanda died

Just set yourself on fire. Ez Freddy cosplay. ^^^/s

I plan on it bro

Will it go up if you play matches?
---
any luck mate? has your game started working? i still haven't gotten word from the devs but my game seems to be working now, its been about 3 days since i've been able to play
---
I just played a Myers with noed and ruin who tunneled pretty hard. That was fun.
---
Bruh, genrushing is toxic in it of itself. Having everyone run a green toolbox with brand new parts and having 3 gens pop in 45 seconds is really unfair for a killer and having ruin be your only chance of preventing a gen rush seems unreasonable.
---
Mind you I genrush myself and I know how frustrating it can be.
---
It‚Äôs not what he wants, he‚Äôs just being a prick. He wants to troll and make their game miserable.
---
You can get perks in shrine. All killers apart from Licensed ones, same with survivors. Skins are basically donations with a little price attached. Nurse and Hillbilly are 1 and 3 best killers in the game. Quit bitching. It has extremely fair DLC. All Licensed killers you can get with splinters ( Apart from GF).
---
Okay, good! Have fun and good luck in your future gamesüëã
---
No worries. Mine started working again too. Let's hope it doesn't do it again lol
---
Could be Devour Hope.
---
What was the date of this match? Need to know so it can be added as another sighting to the wiki.
---
Maybe but ts really sad that we have all the classics but Jason
---
Either way to each their own and take anyone's advice with a grain of salt. Red rank killer here who never used BBQ and ruin together. There's other ways to win
---
Haddonfield would like a word. It might make the house a BL infinite
---
4 swf with 4 pink instaheals and second chance perks.
---
There are dozens of us
---
identity v have 4 problems will cause to kill the game 
---
1-the game is unbalanced and devs don‚Äôt care they still buff survivors and nerf hunters until match making for survivors because no one play hunter any more devs just care about marketing for survivors they make and skins
---
2-bad ping 
---
i play dbd mobile and i got a 80 ping i was surprised on how good ping in early beta if i was playing identity v i will get 200 ping and higher
---
3-bad map design 
---
maps have like 9k pallets alot of pallets alot of infinite loops no entity block like dbd no bloodlust and what make it worst the stun survivors and survivor who have abilities to make hunters slow vault make the game more broken 
---
4-the worst purchase system ever
---
you got to open alot of essence to get season skins you may get them from first try you can purchase more that 50$ echoes package and you might don‚Äôt get nothing or decent thing at least 
---
to get a s tire skin that in store for few days you must purchase 50$ package 
---
am from egypt 50$ = 900 pound witch close to 1000 pound you can get another phone with that money 
---
in dbd mobile you can get 2 license characters 9.99$ and 3 characters for 11.98$ that‚Äôs cost 160 pounds witch much cheaper 
---
so yeah i think identity v will die and devs will kill this game because they don‚Äôt have experience like behaviour
---
I main claudette and i can tell you i am chaotic neutral. I just do what feels right in the moment. Is it sacrificing myself for the hatch play? Sandbagging a teammate? Idk. I'm like a dog chasing cars....

If that was Myers getting his tiers I'd cry
---
Camping is only as good as the survivors make it. If the other 3 can see you're camping via perks, and they're not stupid, they're just gonna pop dangerous center gens. Even if they don't they'll get more time from just working on random gens then you gain from exxing a survivor off the map.
---
But if survivors dedicate two players to an unhook, then you win as you wasted more time than they gain.
---
That said sometimes camping is the best option. (you have surveyor on the far gens if they touch them and they're hooked by the other 2/3 remaining  gens and have the ability to patrol and camp.)
---
Hillary‚Äôs Killer ability is that whenever you‚Äôre in a locker and outside her terror radius the entity kills you, the survivors don‚Äôt get a notification and you still appear alive, and it can be called ‚ÄúAssisted Suicide‚Äù.
---
Oh I understand. As a Michael main, it‚Äôs equally annoying when I‚Äôm constantly on the run with  a Michael following me the whole time and doing that slow, sideways walk that indicates they‚Äôre stalking lol
---
Not a good reason lol
---
That's the bit i couldn't help but notice. I wondered if they had 3 genned themselves
---
Every other building in the game that's two stories has a drop off or vault point somewhere. This sort of griefing could be easily solved, or at least somewhat circumvented, if they put a vault point or drop off on the other side of the stairs.
---
Oh it would've been a whole different  story lol

Totally understandable. It‚Äôs a rare occurrence, but when it happens it makes you tear your hair out.

Yeah I've been enjoying the build a lot

 As a killer?

 A SWF with insta heals all running DS and Borrowed Time

 As survivor?

 That's a hard one. Freddy is pretty annoying to go against but I almost ALWAYS die against a Billy.

whys deliverance up there

Not taking it seriously just another ramble post

Naah, this is just BTS stuff, B-Roll is any footage of scenery or close ups of objects in a scene that can be inter cut when there would otherwise be an error in a solid take.

This is the worst one I've seen in a while

"Have one on the house"
---
How I checked the app store and it‚Äôs not their?
---
Oh I know what you mean about Billy. There‚Äôs those Billies that refuse to M1 and just rev their chainsaw once it‚Äôs already touching your ass.
---
Considering it works on killers too it's is a way better version of fire up, so if you can capitalize on those properties like vault master Myers for example it becomes really strong

Fucktard? Cabbage head? That's quite a big mouth, for some anonymous person on the internet

nice going by avoiding my argument you mongol
---
It's my favorite map.
---
- Small
---
- Gens actually do something, opening up doors, which adds more strategy
---
- Few vaults/jungle gyms
---
- good totem spots
---
- unique generations, which actually differentiate parts of the map vs most where it's just walls shaped like Ls, Ts, etc thrown together.
---
- lots of cover for stealth
---
- fun chases with the floor holes, pallets by them, the vault from upstairs into the hole in the ground, exit gate Shen's
---
This. Some people just genuinely want to play with lower rank friends
---
The kind of changes suggested in higher comments would primarily stop the kind of deliberate bullying (And yes, it is incredibly shitty behaviour and unhealthy in general for the game) people do
---
Hook camping if it isn‚Äôt once the gates are open or if no ones nearby. That and other survivors who DC.
---
Where's your argument? All I see is a frustrated boy that gets mad because someone has an other opinion on the internetüòò
---
One time I used almost every pallet against a Billy because he refused to drop chase.
---
And then says they looped the killer for 5 minutes. No, you just vaulted one window then got hit again lmao.
---
No, neither his invisibility nor his lullaby is affected by M&amp;A, only his TR, which is only heard by awake survivors. There is absolutely no reason to run it on him any more.
---
##RUIN AND DS CAN BE FOUND ON SHRINE OF SECRETS

Crossprogress or linking Ps4 Survivors and PC would be great...
---
I want my Vigo Dwight shirtless David on PC
---
If a Survivor DC‚Äôs, everything you brought for the match is wasted and the whole team is screwed
---
I know. And I've said that myself... multiple times. Now go back to bed
---
I was absolute garbage when I started. 2 months later I‚Äôm red rank. Play both. Observe how killers move, how they act and what works for them. And same when you‚Äôre killer. See how the survivors move, where they tend to go, and what works for them.
---
Take your time. This game has a learning curve; don‚Äôt beat yourself up while you‚Äôre learning. The games matchmaking isn‚Äôt that great, so you‚Äôll play better players, that‚Äôs just how it appears it‚Äôs always gonna be. 
---
Don‚Äôt beat yourself up. Just learn the game. Who cares if you‚Äôre ‚Äúbad.‚Äù It‚Äôs a video game at the end of the day, just enjoy.
---
The floor should be all 3 of your teamates hiding behind a rock waiting to unhook you.

THE ULTIMATE KILLER
---
I don‚Äôt doubt it. I remember seeing a post here awhile ago where the gen light was the hook. Curious, was it one of the new smaller maps?
---
Look up what 2k did to SupMatto also. Not just the Epic Store BS...
---
It depends on what kind of game you're expecting, experienced survivors will make it rather difficult to pop EW3 on them (as they focus on breaking LOS during a chase).
---
Like Wraith can get looped so long that four generators pop, Myers trying to actually build up EW3 when the survivor team is either really immersive (Spine Chill into hiding) or good at breaking LOS is a nightmare.
---
Also EW3 has a limited number of times you can hit it, if you're using them all inside the match (you're rarely gonna stalk every single survivor to 100%, at least one or two are gonna be good enough to slip being stalked) then NOED can also be good for you.
---
I don't used NOED on Myers, by contrast, because I prefer chase perks on him, but eh.
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
I love playing against Myers, just seeing him off in the distance stalking never fails to make me laugh
---

As a Doctor main, this video makes me so happy

Balanced Landing passive bonus really helps on some maps

Didn't try, figured it wouldn't, I imagine it can only be edited that high by devs.

Any idea how you pulled it off? Its one of the steps to doing multiple killers in a match glitch
---
Yeah pretty sure it is

---
Tbf adrenaline is as expected as noed.
---
That is a good way to do it. You can use any killer and get them to rank 1 it is just that some are a lot harder than others and your more likely to encounter games you just have no chance in. I managed to do it with old Freddy but I am so happy he has been changed as the games are less stressful. The easiest ones are the likes of Spirit, Nurse, Billy and maybe Huntress but again you still need to get good with them just when you are they are very dominant.
---

These are the shitposts I want.
---
Honestly they should have just kept it as ‚ÄúThe Ghost‚Äù
---
Oh wow. I've never actually faced a killer who used it so I wouldn't have known that. Thanks.
---
132%
---
Just guessing here
---
If you wait to ready up, you might come off as cautious as to which items the survivors are bringing, or maybe you want to be sure that you're not going to be paired up with 4 OR Claudettes with usernames implying they're SWF -- this could give the impression you're not 100% confident in your own abilities and are not up for anything that is thrown at you.
---
If you ready up instantly, it may seem like you're dead set on a particular purpose, maybe you're going all-in with a Mori or you're pissed from your last match and have a set plan to tunnel/camp so nothing else matters.
---
Ale a masterpiece where the killers are in a 4 man squad dancing on downed survivors.
---
This is great. They‚Äôd be the best buddies
---
Imo Freddy was better before the rework if you knew how to use his wall hacks. But they took away his aura reading ability and gave him teleportation and hitting survivors who are awake so I will accept it but I am sad I don‚Äôt get to cheese with Freddy like I used to.
---
When?
---
I've legit gone into a locker so I could go take a poop.
---
1 crow = not too bad.
---
2 crows = was a bit of a rough ride.
---
3 crows = constipation and now I'm fucked.
---
Good reason
---
I wish they would disable jigsaw boxes until the traps were activated
---
I wanna see this format but involving five moves ahead for big brain time.
---
Couldn‚Äôt be Scream because of copyrights.
---
üòÜ
---
Plus his perks are okay I use aftercare and breakdown quite a bit
---
Yeah... I bet killer would love 3v1 matches all the time. No thanks.
---
I dont think you will like that but majority of players dont want to play 3 vs 1 and that why that change was introduced and will stay like that. Just because you dont like and will not change anything.
---
This is all information we have already known since last winter.

That and people with eac bypasses ;)

---
Myers next please.
---
Kk ill keep that in mind for the next time wraith or spirit sneaks back to hook as im about to unhook guess ill just dc or something
---
Yeah promote your crap somewhere else.
---
so you‚Äôre whole point of p2w is bullshit?
---
lol
---
cant complain about the 2k hour grind if you use your points like a dumbass
---
3v1 games suck and the match cancel was one of the better changes they've made. Stop bitching just because you want easy wins.
---
Fuckin' cryptid
---
Thats her special perk. Her ability is like the huntress, only instead of throwing axes she throws phones at you while calling you a useless cow
---
Jokes on you I find them both hot
---
I gotcha man good luck to you too.
---
Very nice üëå
---
k
---
That generator is in a corner, by the basement side, without a safe loop to do, without map view and the furthest point from a stair. Also, the door simply allows the killer to trap you
---
The only one here worth complaining about maybe is adrenaline
---
/u/PigMasterHedgehog
---
Pig charged attack also doesn't count as PWYF, so if you force your charged attack on your obscession, you basically can be always on 8 stack
---
Never thought to test it, so I'm not sure. Technically you're doing damage to the survivor, and Franklin's procs when you do damage to a survivor, so by that logic, Franklin's should proc on red spit.
---
Its not and anyone who thinks that teabagging is worse than camping/tunnelling for no good reason is wrong :)
---
Fantastic comeback. I live in the UK it is nothing to do with being liberal. Do you think your downvoted because people can't handle 'your genius' or maybe they are just being mean? No it is because all it takes is for someone with an iota of brainpower to work out you shouldn't treat people like that. It's called being a decent human being so grow up and stop thinking being a keyboard warrior makes you anything special. I reiterate try saying some of these things you think are ok on the internet to people's faces you deserve the outcome.

First time it has happened to me on this scale. Before it's only been like 1 or 2 low rank people and the rest equal or higher
---
Oh shit thanks dude, this looks awesome! You did my favorite proud, here's a reward
---
True the killer failed at tunneling. I unhooked one of the survivors and she fased walk to us found both of us (we ran the same direction) and then went for the survivor who just got off the hook. I was even trying to get her to come for me by running in front of her and blocking her in doorways but she wanted the survivor that just got off the hook. She eventually hit me and still chased the other guy and he must of gotten away because he didn‚Äôt get downed again
---
You know people can just buy Ghost Face masks right? It requires no effort really plus the masks are really offish sometimes, not bad just mishaped. Buy the mask, get a black cloak and a knife boom you're done.
---
Wow, it's almost like somebody has to put effort in to actually create the mask anyway. They don't just magically appear on Etsy. Just because they buy it elsewhere doesn't mean someone didn't make it.
---
I can buy a mask made specifically to accurately mimic Jacket's mask in Payday 2. It's still then a high quality mask, but I didn't make it. You don't have to be the one to make it for a cosplay.

Tru
---
that will be a tough one, but I do like a challenge, Freddy will be the next killer I draw, really good suggestion man
---
For a moment i was like: "What's wrong with you" because i thought you were saying the rework wasn't as good as pre freddy
---
you are right, fred could work well when used right, and in my honest opinion kinda fun, But for all the reads you could with the aura, the new freddy is more fair for both sides, by not constantly being able to be seen via aura, and not having to wait at the least 2-3 seconds for the transition.
---
I agree with you however I believe that she is personally a very fun killer to play. She is my secondary main behind Pig and I just love her play style. It ain‚Äôt for everyone thats for sure but we can all agree that she is at least more fun than clown.
---
I didn't start playing that far back :( only when pallet succ was still a thing
---
she's tall, smexy as phuck, and it's fun to use her power. nothing else in the game is like a machine gun. too bad she's bolemic :(
---
Michael Myers looks like he's on BBQ duty
---
I remember taking a shite and hearing chase music. Got back to open exit gates and survivors saying hello
---
It's because she isn't nurse, billy, or spirit. Killers that are well balanced and have fair counter-play are just not topics that this sub cares about.
---
Oh she‚Äôs fun to play but I mean like character wise I think more people would be inclined to buy Freddy or Micheal before her
---
The only time I really have an issue with t-bagging is when people do it while exploiting bugs. I had a Kate somehow get on top of a roof and teabag me the entire match and not help her teammates once. She just stayed on a roof and t-bagged. In a survivor match I played a Trapper got stuck in a pallet and these two survivors just t-bagged and pointed at him. The other survivor and I managed to get him out of the pallet by sliding across it and he grabbed us but it sucked that people felt they had to teabag someone who literally can‚Äôt do anything and then go do gens for free points. Like I get it to an extent but maybe try and help the guy out instead of being a dick? End game chat was insane on that game two, the other survivors were sooo mad we got the trapper out and complained because they got sacrificed after that and it wasn‚Äôt fair because it wasn‚Äôt their fault he got stuck. Perhaps it wasn‚Äôt their fault but t-bagging the poor guy was just toxic as hell.
---

I love Plague. I like staying sick and pulling everywhere. I laugh my ass off playing against and with her.

---
Aye I feel that. She was one of the later characters i bought, im p sure it was like 4th to last only ahead of Clown, Spirit, Ghosty and (old) Freddy. But yea like I most definitely bought Micael, Leatherface and Pig first lol
---
Survivor main.  I always hear that there's so much salt with the community, so I always try and say something nice after a match to say something nice to the killer, win or lose.  I'm sure they're used to hearing so much junk, I just wanna send something nice their way
---
Last night I was loading into the game and someone in the lobby disconnected, I looked at the killers items and he had an ebony mori, noed, ruin, ect. Felt nice to avoid that.
---
I would've used The Stalker.
---
\*laughs in literally only cleansing dull totems all day\*
---
As another doc main, I applaud this message
---
Thank you, that's awesome. I'm really pleased with the feedback I've had. I may look at making an extended version at some point and make it into a full track.
---
Yeah people tend to buy licensed characters first because they actually know them which is why you see more hillbilly and Freddy in the lower ranks online as of lately
---
how did you even do this?
---
Man i want to agree with you but it feels soooo cheap. It goes beyond some pressure, especially with maps having gates right by each other. Idk 
---
Interesting view though, i've never thought of noed giving some end game excitement
---
Totally agrees, any of my leather jacket a paper plate, broken ruler, cosplay done, time for doing it : 10 minutes, just the time to draw W/E meme you want on your paper plate.
---
Oh just had a few games like this it was a slug fest. You may be right.
---
There isn't one at the moment but I was thinking of making an extended version at some point for people to download.
---
Ima be real with you, the first few ranks suck but from rank 9-15 is where it gets really fun and a lot less people are toxic/ exploit certain things ie face camping. The community is toxic but not like Rainbow 6 or Overwatch bad ya feel?
---
Same it's my favourite
---
I dont know, i actually prefer depipping, why do i want longer queue times?
---
It's not an issue with the system of swf. Its the way people use it to pull cheap shit like that. Swf isn't inherently evil. I personally only play swf if I plan on doing low tier dumb shit or get drunk. Usually both .
---
It's not a matter of " x is bad and need to be removed " it has a lot more to do with it being poorly tuned. I'd be for just placing all swf teams against a higher rank killer to compensate for the bonus info they have as a group. 
---
IE : 3 rank 15's swf queued with the rank 11-8 pool instead of other ranks 15's, simply because they're queuing as a squad.
---
I think in the future they could add a counter to noed possibly like a new perk or add much better perks that noed isn‚Äôt needed as much
---
It‚Äôs normal ik some ppl just to believe it‚Äôs only survivors that are toxic but the game has a lot of toxic killers as well
---
I have the physical copy and a downloaded version when it was free with PS Plus.  Both make my PlayStation sound like my fat ass on a treadmill cranked to ten.   Heavy air circulation and begging for death.
---
4 people alive, exit gates powered, and at least 3 of them we know were in the same place?
---
Were you SWF? I know this is bannable, but if you were I can't blame him. He wanted to make your game as shitty as his was. 
---
If you weren't then he's toxic af.
---
Standing near you while hooked is called camping, and yes it‚Äôs annoying.

Avengers: Endgame
---
IT‚ÄôS TIME TO STOP!
---
I'm not a killer main, but I do play killer, and I know that camping and tunneling are at times viable given the situation, which means its more of a strategy than anything else, whereas teabagging is a gesture that in most people's eyes means "you suck" or "screw you",and obviously insults are not warranted if your trying to not look like a douchebag.
---
I PM'd you a few days ago. I posted a way I got it to work on the subreddit but it requires 2 accounts.
---
Windows of opportunity is still kinda of good since it tells you which pallets are still up so if you‚Äôre being chased you‚Äôll know where to go
---
Last night a huntress found me in the beginning of the match. I decided not to run and did the follow me motion even after she hit me. She then decided to follow me and I led her to my teammates and sold them out. This persisted throughout the match until they were all dead. It felt good to be on the killers side for once. She then let me escape having helped her to find my teamates.
---
Proud momma and happy son
---
I *don‚Äôt* see
---
True but T-bagging doesn‚Äôt cause the killer to pip down, while tunneling and camping does cause survivors to pip down
---
An Ebony mori is usually considered toxic because it fundamentally changes the game, and it can be extremely unfun for the survivors (and killer)
---
God I wish I could combine all this horrific shit together in normal games. Would fail skill checks just laughing at how silly some of this nightmare fuel would be
---
You are a kind soul, I try to as well. Even a little GG can brighten a day.
---
*say in a Scottish accent* 
---
Body blocking? no
---
Playing Claudette and t-bagging? yes
---
Is that... Freaking sniper from tf2?
---
I don‚Äôt like ebony Mori but it‚Äôs part of the game it‚Äôs not toxic if your using something that parts of of the game
---
‚ÄúYo why is his hand open? Is this a bug? OH SHIT OH SHIT‚Äù
---
DidNt YOu ReAD THe hAnDBoOk?
---
His chainsaw is his ability use it as you wish
---
Too groovy
---
Long as you weren't tunneling people directly off hook into Moris it isn't toxic.  Certainly a crutch but not toxic.  It's all about how you used it in game.  The act of bringing and ebony in and of itself is not toxic at all.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm rank 4 as if right now and I‚Äôm getting put with 15 and down while the killer is at rank 6. It doesn‚Äôt even average out anymore like it used to. Sucks but I guess it‚Äôs better than waiting an extra ten minutes I guess? Lol
---
You may be lunging at the survivors. Just get like within grab distance and u should be good. I hope this helps.
---
Yes 100% brown bag should be base kit.  That's literally all the man needs to become more viable.  He doesn't need much help.
---
The only perk that triggers me right now is Dead Hard, I don't know why it got so much popular but so many people run it. And everyone is just Dead Hard 'ing for distance in loops and it's so frustrating, there's nothing you can do and it doubles the chase time sometimes.
---
I've had this happen at the exact same loop and I was just stunned.
---
Actually if you look closer it looks like his hips are somewhat separated from her.
---
its barely op if you do totems
---
This happened to me a couple nights ago while I was playing a killer. Came back to realize three generators were done and all 4 of them were working on the one i spawned next two. Actually one was butt dancing right in front of me, so I hit him and the all run away. Killed three one got away.
---
Creating new killers and survivors and creating three perks each will only make those perks more situational, unoriginal and weak each dlc. Change my mind.
---
Just don't go next to the pawn lmao.
---
Noice
---
I bet your fun at parties :/
---
The biggest issue is let's say you hit a dude, do a quick spin to peep and see if anyone is nearby, nope, no one, and now you have no blood drops, scratch marks, or noises because all you hear is asthmatic ass Legion.
---
The ability does nearly nothing anymore, no one went down to it naturally before and no one goes down to it now at all. Legion is a cosplayable, sick skin and lore, but poor game play killer in my opinion.
---
I used to love them, now I despise them.
---
I‚Äôm new to the game, can someone explain why this is stupid?
---
You get them when you level up
---
What if he could phase through everything? would that make him OP?
---
real question.
---
Because it's just not necessary, doesn't even get you anything, tunneling/camping will most likely get you a kill whereas tbagging will just piss the killer off for no good reason
---
He is, just thought this shouldn't happen since the devs said he can't teleport to finished gens but he clearly can so it doesn't make any sense.
---
sounds great, 600 charges, 1 charge = 1 pallet awesome idea bro!
---
This is my favorite video to come out of this game.
---
I don't think it would tbh.
---
 He already has to cloak out of it anyways so it's not like survivors wont have a chance to run. Plus you know. You can still see him.
---
You have to level each character up to level 40 to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù their perks so they appear in all bloodwebs. Unless of course you buy them in the shrine... it‚Äôs like a roundabout way to get perks.
---
Would you maybe want to come over for dinner? Patiently awaiting your response...
---
DBD is one of the most toxic community's I've played in lol
---
I could see that being good, and a cool idea to make him more viable, but the problem with it I think is that he may end up playing a little to similarly to how spirit plays with mind gaming the pallets in such a way.
---
Thanks.
---
Ghostface is taking the picture I presume
---
Now I want a zombie killer that throws limbs, but he has to collect them after.
---
It takes me 10 seconds and no money to criticize people‚Äôs hobbies on the internet
---
Fine, then rebuff Enduring to affect ability stuns as well.
---
11 if you count Scary Movie 1. WAZZAAAAPPP?!
---
Spirit and hillbilly obviously
---
I‚Äôm really annoyed that I know exactly what scene this is from.
---
A cool thing to add to the pig would be a green and purple ambush add on to reduce cool down and ambush time.
---
I guess, but I'd rather see similarity to a popular Killer than similarity to Bubba.
---
Any tips on how to play her. I tried one match and really fucked it up since she was the first ranged killer I attempted and I just didn‚Äôt go too well

Nothing aggravates me more than seeing someone urban evasion from across the map to unhook me and then I die because they didn't reach me in time.  All while the other teammate is being actively chased away from me.
---
I dunno it seems to me like wraith was just a failed first attempt at what spirit is. It's kinda sad really. I hope they show him some love soon cuz he's the worst killer rn imo
---
If there was someone that wasn‚Äôt trapped up there it really isn‚Äôt reportable. You should be blaming the nea who didn‚Äôt open the gates.
---
I was going to make a joke of some of the more recent, useless perk additions, but I literally can't remember the name of any of Jane or Ash's perks except Mettle and Head-on.
---
Thanks lad!
---
You‚Äôre not supposed to be able to. I got down to SEVENTEEN the other day as killer though, not by dc‚Äôing but by constantly -1 depipping. Had no idea that was possible!
---
I'm trying to prestige my Wraith now. This hasn't happened yet, but is something I can totally see occurring in the future.
---
Bamboozle and Pop Goes The Weasel. Pretty awesome perks that were added with Clown release.

---
Secone one. For example, Autodidact could be a good perk if we'll make it didn't exist, or flip-flop Vs unbreakable.
---
Either bait or just a genuine idiot.
---
It's more like they're topics that don't need much discussion. If a Killer is blatantly more powerful than they should be or annoying to play as (pre-rework Freddy) or against (pre-rework Legion) then it's obvious there will be discussion about these topics. Killers like Plague or Myers who are quite balanced in terms of power and fun don't warrant very much discussion because there's not much to say. 
---
You could come up with a whole list of what's wrong with Nurse or Spirit, but Plague? Uh... sometimes you don't get to use your power because nobody cleanses? But that in itself is okay because you're a one-shot the entire trial. You can't discuss a topic that has nothing to talk about.
---
What Nea?
---
he constantly says random things dude thats just his shtick I guess. One day hes a clown main the other he‚Äôs a plague main and the next minute he has over 5000 hours as billy alone. Like what. Great killer and really fun to watch though.
---
Yeah you dont lose pips for dodging lobbies.
---
Stalky background boi, niiiice
---
Buckle Up and Solidarity are both pretty trash tier.
---
Flip-Flop and Poised are both situational, but amazing/hilarious when they work. 
---
But yeah, I think it's very unlikely that we get chapters with six unique/fun/interesting perks.
---
I legit stopped a gen at 99% to heal my friend who was also on the gen, the killer came and swung at my friend, I finished the gen real quick as he was wiping his weapon and booked it. Killer was pissed.
---
Bamboozle is only good if you don't know how to deal with loops. It can't buy you skill though.
---
Myers has "Stalk" ability so basically the more he looks at you the stronger and faster he gets.
---
Absolutely not. He's still miles better than bubba.
---
You know using what I said doesn't work on Ghostfaces mask right? Because 1 it is made by a company that pumps them out like hot cakes so they keep a decent consistency so it won't be offish and 2. I'm saying that compared to alot of the others DBD cosplays legion and Susie's are the ones that require the least bit of effort in the slightest because you can buy everything(and the susie masks are everywhere) fairly cheaply which just creates just a bunch of cosplays of one character which is just like oh hey another legion cosplay . you may say  "oh but Ghostface is just a mask and cloak that you can just buy" however Ghostfaces shroud needs to be made as I haven't found a single seller for one as it's a damn coat that needs plenty of different fabrics and materials and I'm not saying you have to make a mask but since the outfit is so easy to make and just being able to buy everything it just creates a bunch of cosplays that require little to no effort unlike Hillbilly,Plague,Pig,doctor etc
---
Gen rush so hard you fly away~*
---
It means you‚Äôre the killer‚Äôs obsession
---
You are the Object of Obsession.
---
I am gonna assume that by infinites you mean they are able to loop you for a long time. Here are some tips:
---
1- Don't respect pallets.
---
2- Run enduring and spirit fury.
---
3- on LT walls, chase them anti clockwise. 
---
4- on jungle gyms with windows, chase them in the direction that doesn't allow them to vault the window. 
---
5- Learn how to hide your red light and mind game in tiles with walls (no LOS). 
---
Or you can play spirit or nurse.
---
Downvote
---
First off, lots of killers find success without using Ruin on any killer.
---
Second off, have you played with the new Pop? Lots of killer mains are swapping Ruin off for it. Hell, some are using both.
---
Third of all, that's not the point being made. The point is that instead of adding Ruin back with the Hag patch, they should've just added a core game mechanic that slowed down generator speeds (while someone is on the hook, generator speed is reduced by 'x'% to give survivors incentive to work together to unhook). Or just slowed down generators all together. Or just made an official statement saying "get gud". 
---
But instead, BHVR decided Ruin didn't fix the problem, so what did they do? Added a bunch of pretty subpar gen-defense perks. So many in fact, that if they nerfed generator speed now in some way, you probably would not win very many games as survivor at all. If they nerfed generator speed by a flat 30% (very big, not even close to what they should ever nerf it by), even a sub-par killer could win with Ruin+Pop. 
---
BHVR is putting themselves in a corner with perks they design. Instead of them being additions to the game, an extra layer of complexity, they change the game entirely. Playing around the BT/DS/Unbreakable shuffle every game, seeing every killer run Ruin, etc.
---
Seriously, check this streamer out. I stayed in his stream after I was done playing and he is really funny.

The ‚Äòentity displeased‚Äô music can be the biggest punch in the gut sometimes

I have 7 hours played and I keep getting paired against killers with hundreds or thousands of hours.

*sad dwight noises*
---
What does that mean? Sorry I only just stared playing the game
---
They do. You can get up to 5 blinks. Fun thing is it used to be worse! You could get up to 8! And then 7! and now 5 :D

It means the killer gets some advantage from you. Take Dying Light for example (killer perk). You can heal others faster as the obsession but once you are killed all other survivors are working slower.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Obsession
---
But Billy gets to keep his collision during chainsaw? Wack.
---
/u/disloyalrelic
---
It‚Äôs fine, there are perks in the game that affect the person who is the Object of Obsession. There are killer perks like Dying light or Rancor and Survivor Perks like decisive strike or the perk named Object of obsession.
---
To me personally it dont mean much it all depend on what perk the killer is running.
---
Aww, how nice to see mother and son taking a selfie together.
---
here's all my status effect icons [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hrnofz01avhfm7e/AADcF5WcZo9ULQ7cb-D5O2Z0a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hrnofz01avhfm7e/AADcF5WcZo9ULQ7cb-D5O2Z0a?dl=0)
---
Makes it harder to spot Survivors. For some Killers, especially stealthy ones like Myers, Ghostface and Pig, it makes them very hard to notice amidst the mist when it's thick and they're not moving. (e.g. Ghostface's stalking)
---
I do agree though that for most killers this offering is simply useless at best.
---
Why wouldn't he? The only reason Myers doesn't is so that he can't block someone and finish all their stalk if he has tuft of hair.
---
its nit the action its the kid screaming in my ear just thought it was funny :D
---
It means that either you have a perk that makes you the obsession (i.e. decisive strike, object of obsession) or the killer has a perk that picks a random survivor to become their obsession (i.e. dying light, play with your food, save the best for last). These perks on the survivor side are really strong and indicate to the killer that you have those perks. These perks on the killers side make you either more or less valuable to kill based on the perk. Dyjng light makes you more valuable to kill because it doesnt activate until the obsession dies, while save the best for last makes you less valuable to kill becuase the killer gets buffs for not attacking you.
---
Generally if you are the object of obsession, it‚Äôs a bad thing.
---
I play on Xbox but surely it‚Äôs the same, l1 run l2 crouch r2 item r1 normal heal/repair
---
Happy scp 173 noises
---
thx
---
My build personally is Thanataphobia, Ruin, Infectious Fright and Monitor and Abuse. Usually with this build you can get people to want to cleanse which typically survivors without 3 braincells will not want to do. And once somebody cleanses you have an instant win button for a decent amount of time. If they dont cleanse they are always one shot. The only flaws with her are her getting looped somewhat easily, but if you have corrupt thats not a big issue. She also has an extremely great add on as Landophille said which allows her to see puking survivors for 5 seconds which is op as all hell and will essentially force people to cleanse or else they lose. Other than that id suggest play her similar to an M1 killer except for the fact that she can vomit and make the game a lot harder for survivors to play lol.

I use meta perks cause its meta, but usually I run Iron Will instead of DS and use BT instead of Deliverance. no instaheals though, its not fun to go against instaheals so I dont use them.
---
I see you‚Äôre still continuing the lordt‚Äôs work, brother.
---
I wish I could ditch BBQ but the bloodpoint gains are tpp great to leave even if I'd rather run something else :(
---
Yeah that's fine, you get 0 practice from DC'ing immediately though
---
Thats a very effective way to depip. The game forces you to interact with the killer if you want to rank up, and this build isnt for that.
---
Fazecumshot..
---
..nty
---
So, you mean nerfing DS again?
---
Dance with me only works with fast locker exits. If u Wanna truly be stealthy you gotta add quick as quiet.
---
My survivial rate is about -15%
---
He‚Äôs already OP in my opinion
---
#JusticeForClaptrap
---
Bamboozle is a perk that makes you delete a loop instead of you as a killer have to mind game it. No good killers need to run it because they can deal with looping without it.
---
I was annoyed because she helped the kid instead of just getting out. A true Laurie strode move imo.
---
You really thought you did something here hmm
---
Yes, DS should be nerfed, same as Ruin because both are annoying to the other side
---
They should make the Smileys from Manhunt
---
Stop this madness
---
Ok sweet. Thank you. I‚Äôm trying to get good at her but it‚Äôs really confusing. But I love plague based characters so she seemed up my ally. Also note I‚Äôm kinda low rank so I‚Äôm learning
---
And it's understandable that every cosplay is going to get criticism. I cosplay, I get criticism. But it feels entirely unfair to completely tear this person down, even if they've admitted that it was bad. I've seen op's post, I already know they said it themself. But after a while the criticism starts to get to you. I'm just trying to look out for somebody else, I don't see any wrong in that.
---
The entire time he was on the hook? Cuz there was quite a bit of time where you could have gotten him from what I can see
---
Okay lol I was really confused, because everything else was spelled like perfectly
---
The pre lobby screen tho ;)
---
As long as you mori on death hook only it's fine
---
It‚Äôs really not stupid. Steam bends over devs and sticks it way up their ass when it comes to how much money they take off each sale. 
---
Honestly don‚Äôt know how people trash epic but let it slide that steam takes a fucking massive chunk of the money games make. Epic is way more dev friendly people are just whiny about epic for dumb reasons.
---
balance is good atm. you don‚Äôt need to always remove stuff to balance

---
Ouch did that actually happen for you?
---
Until they add a totem counter in some way there‚Äôs no point in cleansing full totems unless you‚Äôre swf.
---
But what about running with a toolbox? /s
---
I don‚Äôt think the killer mains who make these know that ‚ÄúoH jUsT CleAnSe THe tOteMS‚Äù isn‚Äôt as easy as it sounds. You would really be surprised how inconvenient and extra it is running around looking for totems on a perk that you don‚Äôt even know the killer has.
---
Happy Oink Noise
---
Killers have powerfull addons, if you meet a team with good tools, use good addons, Moris are like Insta, both rewatd you from being bad, no need to make mind games, being efficient, no, you just pop that insta in the killer face then loop him for 10 minutes or use your ebony because 4 hooks to win are almost like 12 hooks to win, right? Moris should require 2 hooks to kill, because at that point, the survivor is dead anyway
---
Glad you enjoy puking on us lol, I've loved playing as and against plague since she came out. My best advice to play as her is to punish survivors for cleansing as often as possible. She is so powerful with corrupt purge that the high-rank survivor meta against her is to literally play the whole trial as one-shot until gates are powered, then cleanse, then gtfo. Good luck out there.
---
Oh yisus, nice one!
---
Getting deep wound x4 is so satisfying
---
You mean a shitty version of nurse?
---
Myers stalking one person hurts the whole team. Why punish the whole team for a blendette mistake of crouching in a corner. With billy it punishes the person who made the mistake, not everyone else
---
Getting hit with a surprise pallet that scares you and you flinch it's like bitch thats my fucken job
---
Getting messages from survivors who tell me to kill myself or say racist shit get reported without question. Don't even respond to those people because it isn't worth your time.
---
Hate when that happens
---
One survivor dies and that's a 75% action speed if everyone runs it. How can people be so braindead to downvote you?
---
just in case no one said it yet, probably don't kill your parents, those guys are giving bad advice.
---
He IS the one.
---
They just want a reaction. Survivors and killers expect a reaction of them getting mad or something to make them feel better about themselves when they say ‚Äútoxic‚Äù things like gg ez.
---
"while someone is on the hook, generator speed is reduced by 'x'% to give survivors incentive to work together to unhook" I feel like that would make camping even more of a thing.
---
If they nerfed gens themselves, they'd propably also nerf the current gen perks. Or rework them. I think one of the problems with ruin is that it's kinda based on RNG (finding totem is based in part on luck, skill checks appearing is RNG) so sometimes it can feel *really* unfair for survs. Hope they will change it at some point.
---
well that is the reason, they couldn't afford their likenesses, bruce campbell allowed his likeness for ash, tapp looks kinda like him but im sure danny glover's face was way too expensive
---
idk how purchasing people's likenesses are but black ops got 4 very popular horror actors to star in call of the dead as themselves, but i dont know if dbd has that kinda budget
---
Everyone likes the game until a doc with iridescent king and distressing joins.
---
If you're never seen, you're never hit, and will never heal yourself. Unless you're talking about healing a survivor who's injured, and running free after revealing them. In which case you don't need a medkit either, I guess.
---
Literally never seen a build like this before . First time.  I'd have a reward for you for such creativity.   You are like expanding your terror radius and making the skill checks smaller for survivors, so they have a harder time completing gens ? Bravo good sir. 
---
And then if they do you can kick them and give them almost impossible to hit skill checks? Bravo again
---
Multiple times on Nurse, especially before they tweaked the numbers a bit.
---
Bannable offense btw.
---
Play how you see fit homie i dont really care to argue here
---
Waltz: I agree with what others have said already about this one and baby killers. I could also see it confuse newer survivors who pick up the perk and don‚Äôt know there are different vault types.
---
NYSM: While an interesting concept, I don‚Äôt think you get how OP this really is. Time is very important to killers and allowing survivors to go invisible for 30 seconds every 40 seconds would make it very difficult for killers (especially newer ones) to locate survivors. Even insidious, which is I think the closest perk to this allows you to still see the killer. Bad perk idea all round. 
---
Not Today - Too situational. Not all killers use a Mori, meaning you could waste a perk slot if you bring this and they don‚Äôt have one. Also keep in mind even decisive had a lower stun time and that perk literally has the survivor stab the killer in the back. No way a kick causes a 10 second stun.
---
I got reported for using iridescent head on huntress. They called me a hacker.
---
That sounds really cool. I've only been playing for two months so I didn't know they were specifically released in October.
---
what's your killcount
---
Neither do I, bro, have a good time anyways.
---
The main issue is that most killer perks become easy to counter in high ranks, while most survivor perks either can‚Äôt be directly countered, or are counterplay.
---
They're running out of good licensed options, and the licensed ones limit them way too much in what they can do. I prefer their original killers. That said, Michael and Freddy are both fun as hell
---
Yeah because killers arent weak enough already
---
You're describing how upvotes and downvotes work in an ideal world. They were intended that way, but that's not how they work in actual practice. Unless you can force everyone to use upvotes and downvotes the way you're describing (you can't) then they will continue to be used strictly for 'I want to see this' and 'I don't want to see this.'

No I like the extra time to prepare sometimes, and it‚Äôs just a minute it‚Äôs not a big deal.  Plus as survivor you can talk to other survivors in the meantime!

It's absolutely not. "Camping" a pallet doesn't prevent anyone from playing. Camping a hook prevents the camped person from participating in gameplay whatsoever. I play both sides and that is apples and oranges.
---
It‚Äôs a flat cap :)
---
Infectious fright is SO GOOD on billy.  Ghostface dlc was almost utter trash with the perks, I‚Äôm all ears is only really good on nurse and (thrilling tremors I think?) is just bbq without a blood point bonus.
---
You could at least say what it does so I dont have to google it
---
Yes I agree fully. It just takes so damn long to wait for a lobby and then you have to wait for the others. Just can't win
---
I bring a Mori almost every game now.
---
I have hundreds of them, and I like to make people DC.

 You get emblem points for the Mori, and you get emblem points for them quitting. The easiest way to pip ok red ranks is with people quitting.

Replace overcharge with huntress lullaby &amp; put on the game offering &lt;3
---
Also take into perspective I‚Äôm a rank 17 killer
---
Na, middle tier or there abouts. She has a few issues.
---
Her power slows her down, she has to stop to vomit and when shes holding a charge she moves slower
---
her power is easy to line of sight so little things like trees become major obstacles to her. Same with high walls.
---
Players tend to not cleanse until its time to open the gate meaning corrupt purge is a rarity and you need to get add ons to even get to use it more than twice in a match
---
corrupt purge needs to be picked up at various fountains and carried to wherever she needs to bring it while it constantly loses time so survivors can cleanse in a far off corner then go to the other side of the match
---
without corrupt purge shes basically a big slow easy to spot M1 killer which is easy to loop even if you are exposed
---
Shes probably one of the rarest killers to face in my experience, right down there with clown. I almost never see her these days.

Figured it was but wanted to make it clear in case
---
That‚Äôs the point of the song though ‚Äî to embrace the stereotypes of the two opposite genres. Think of it as a modern day ‚Äúkung fu fighting‚Äù
---
If you like the bloody cosmetics, yes
---
If not, no
---
It's a useless grind for a stain of blood
---
No, Freddy was genuinely underpowered.
---
Do the crapper
---
Do
---
So I did good?
---
You ripped a screenshot directly from a video that was on the front page the same day. Yes to karma farming.

*reads caption* *doesn‚Äôt see full picture* ....What?

*presses to see full picture* Wha- OMFG!!!!
---
You're using Moris, BBQ, and Ruin agaisnt rank 20s with literally no perks. I don't blame em
---
Play late at night, usually you'll find all the mentally unstable/angry/depressed people who will vent shit out at you for no reason.
---
Most days I will simply get a "damn, gg!" or at least a "well played" from Survivors. I woke up one night at 3am and couldnt sleep, so I played Killer. Post-Game chat was full of "fucking kill yourself kid. you're so shit at this game you probably arent good at anything in your life!"
---
Don‚Äôt actively look for Ruin. Do the gens, and Ruin will be found naturally by either you or your teammates throughout the game. You have a much better chance if you‚Äôre running Small Game anyways.
---
Same! But when I solo queue as a survivor nobody tries to find the damn thing and just blow up gens alone instead of doubling up on one and getting it done. Hahahahaha
---
I wonder how crazy a 2 killer 8 survivor game would be
---
Whats wrong with the gen blocking perk? Never played Plague before.
---
Ewww sick that‚Äôs his mom
---
Hmm seems like a struggle but I'll try it out and see if things will come naturally. Instead of forcing it when theres still 5 gens.
---
How do I turn it off?
---
Yep waste 32 seconds and hope the killer doesn‚Äôt have nurses or bbq. SeemsGood
---
For me it's that godawful noise it plays on that screen more so than the text.
---
Like it's bad enough that i just had a terrible game, i don't need some "FAILURE!" siren in my ears to remind me.
---
He is great at deescalating toxic situations. Also, watching him deal with the people that keep harassing him is great because he just wrecks them.
---
Me: doing a gen minding my business 
---
Michel: I see you‚Äôre minding your business mind if I just, stalk?
---
Imma do this alot now
---
This better be a joke. If not this will make my day.
---
Bubbaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Entity displeased, take your black pip.
---
Fair enough
---
This comment? I like this one.
---
That apostrophe makes it better
---
Was wondering why it felt like no one was doing gens
---
It's called "Hex: Ruin everyone's mood". If you get camped as survivor you have a 76% higher chance of switching to killer and camping random survivors. These survivors will now have a 76% higher chance of doing the same too. Congratulations the game is a toxic fest now.
---
I havent seen one of those yet but that's pretty funny
---
Attaboy!  Now go out there and gen rush them Ghostfaces!
---
Ye exactly in the beginning i thought it would be cool to p3 every killer but I also got stuff to do so I think prestige kinda is a waste
---
The Huntress, and the fact that your camera gets inverter every time you get hit
---
Meg would catch me with sprint burst :(
---
If I ever perform really well as a killer 2-3 games in a row then I get rank 1/2
---
They say it takes too much time. Haha. 20 seconds is a killer.
---
I've been wanting that for soooooo long
---
Only cure to swf I've found is slugging every mother fucker as pig. You leave them bleeding out on the floor with a bucket helmet and let them cry in end game chat. Bc with most players like that, they either call you a complete waste of life who's easy to beat, or a camper. No in between. Just got to rank 13 and I have been destroyed, and completely smashed rank 4-7 SWF and they all talk shit no matter what. I'm either trash for being bad, or trash for slugging or camping. Lol.
---
Actually, a camped person needs to stay alive as long as possible while their team mates get gens done. Making the hooked person MVP. Camping killers get 1 or 2 kills a game.
---
No way, that was you?!
---
DEEP WOUND
---
"Tunneler."
---
Try to get a killer to be cashier
---
Sounds fun!
---
lol killer mains like to argue this is game is survivor sided and yet the statistics say otherwise. But I‚Äôm sure your anecdotal evidence trumps actual statistics üò∞
---
Stop trying to make fax happen. It's not going to happen.
