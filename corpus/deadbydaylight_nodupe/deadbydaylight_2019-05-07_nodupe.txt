The amount of screenshots I have of multiple people spawning 3 inches from a Hex totem is too high to count.
---
---
---
Yes
---
pls don't mori me
---
I wish they would fix the rank system instead of working on new shit. Give rewards to Rank 5 and higher and fix the 4K Derain BS.
---
VSauce out of context is a meme, he doesn't literally want to die *right now*.
---
That’s funny. Whenever I 4% I walk straight into the loving chainsaw of a Leatherface who still has that bitch revved and ready despite my depressingly low odds of unhooking.
---
Expectation: there will be more rank sparcity and ranks will actually mean something.
---

---
Reality: There are now 5 less ranks as Rank 5 is the new Rank 1 since it's literally impossible to get past Rank 5 without farming.
---
you're right but the Pip systems still shit.
---
repost.
---
Oooo someone’s a salty survivor
---
Yeah i might do that, problem was i'm a hot garbage billy i'd be better off just chasing and slugging the one farming with me then bothering with the other idiot.
---
*Laughs in No Mither*
---
Oh yeah. I wish the game could stay like that forever, actually. I'll never forget the sound I made the first time I panned the camera around right into a Michael charging his Evil Within.
---
"Slugging is not the intended way to play killer" apparently Deerstalker and Knock Out hurt him personally.
---
Quit match you get points. If they pull their plug you get no points. The game registers the dc different.
---
I didn't know that, that's dumb lol
---
This again....
---
Can someone explain what slugging is? I must be stupid but I really don’t know what it means.
---
Hopefully when dedicated servers are here they get punished for it
---
It doesn't make you stupid!
---
Basically, it's when you leave a downed survivor on the floor instead of hooking them
---
Yes that’s why it actually takes skill because if you don’t time it right u just look like the fool who ripped his pants because the killer just stands there and laughs at u. And it results in a fat smack on the cheeks.
---
Bless this Legion, because I think I encountered the same one.
---
My poor heart :-(
---
Just play Freddie and do your absolute best for a buncha games. That should de-rank you pretty quick
---
Yasss!!! You wont regret not relying on selfcare!!
---
I won’t be too mean like most people are going to be, 
---
Learn your lunge distance, you lunged early so many times it was getting cringy, and Jesus learn to aim your swings. 
---
Stop insta picking people up, you know they have flashlights look around before picking them up to stop being flash stunned, at the very least look at a wall so you want be blinded. 
---
Not gonna critique that Kate, she was damn amazing with her loops and jungle gym use,
---
Hey man, at least there's a reason to complain when NOED gets you killed. BBQ rewards you for hooks (playing well). NOED rewards you for playing bad (which is dumb).
---
This is me. I always down them and walk towards a hook and swiftly turn to the hatch.
---
On Xbox then lol I had a handful of cool killers on PS4
---
To be fair you played bad...😬
---
Really hope that’s a guy that’s underneath that stuff.
---
I don’t have a problem with it, it’s hilariously easy to counter, crouch behind an unfinished gen, or hop in a locker for a couple seconds and you’re good
---
It doesn’t bother me, it can be completely negated.
---
This is why I always let one escape, and try to go below rank 8. As a ps4 player anything lower than rank 5 is 20+ minute wait timers as a killer to wind up in a very well coordinated swf lobby so I'm forced to play Billy or spirit  or nurse. At rank 10-8 I can play whoever I want and level up my lower killers
---
If your entire team gets downed by a killer as weak as Leatherface, you deserve the loss.
---
Yikes... I mean that Kate was quite good and it seemed like the only reason she teabagged was because you were tunnelling her, nothing else they did, whilst frustrating, was toxic. You just played bad.
---
Not sure how this relates to what I said but ok
---
The detail in the mask is amazing! Did you make it or buy it?
---
Got the rank 1 killer steam achievement forever ago, so now I don't care about rank and would just prefer fun games where survivors aren't tryharding on discord with meta perks.
---
No ron
---
Exactly. They consciously load themselves up to stomp survivors as hard as possible just to be pricks.
---
Teabag, flashlight click, moonwalk and all that is toxic.
---
But looping is not. A survivor daring to survive is not toxic. I see lots of killers who get mad at being led on a slightly long chase and face camping as a result, when the survivor was not doing any bad manner stuff.
---
Yes I know I posted yesterday, but I'm addicted to bamboozling plags now.
---
This is my first blood hunt.... I'm glad I know what to expect lol
---
why does anyone play any game competitively? To call it vain is pedantic
---
Left is someone who has been playing the game for a while. They are jaded and no longer have any fun anymore, but for some reason can't stop playing.
---
The two on the right are new players, bright-eyed and hopeful that this game will endure as one of their best experiences ever.
---
Oh ok, good to know 
---
Thanks :)
---
&gt; just pointing out it's valid to criticize people who play like you are boring and kinda shitty, and its equally valid to criticize a surv who runs all the crutch-like perks in a sweaty quest to rush gens as fast as they can with no interaction with the killer are also boring and shitty. 
---
I think that's the part we disagree on (and what I agree with the other poster on). They are players playing the game to win, not to entertain their opponents. If players trying really hard to win isn't fun, that's a problem with the game not the players. I feel the players deserve 0% criticism in this regard unless they are actually exploiting.
---
Sometimes you'll get games where people aren't concerned with points and just want to destroy everyone. That's their prerogative, we can't be too upset over it. Everyone is playing the same game at the end of the day.
---
A survivor of your talents?
---
I guess I should clarify. I mean when they use it at certain moments. There's survivors who slam down pallets then do all that kinda stuff while waiting for killer to break it, including moon walking. Or they do it around a T piece, just as a way to constantly taunt.
---
But yeah you're right. God forbid we try to survive.
---
so you play on a new Account and someone plays Killer for the first time after being a long time Survivor Main?
---
Il sorry I really dont get this post
---
Who said it ever did reflect skill?
---
If your entire team got chainsawed by a Leatherface then I doubt any perk setup he used would’ve mattered given your apparent skill level. I used to get pissed and say that 1 hitting was op. Then I got good at the game. Once you play Killer at low ranks you’ll understand how annoying it can be trying to kill survivors with only basic attacks. Once you’re good at survivor you’ll realize how back basic killers and how easy you can loop/avoid them.
---
I do it with the Doctor when there are two survivors left. Finding the one on the ground is really easy with the screams and the illusions.
---
Sometimes I'll see birds fly away irl and go on high alert looking for survivors in that area that scared the crows away
---
I don't think it's broken, but what's the reasoning behind the *enormous* BP bonus it gives? It would probably be top-tier even without the bloodpoints. Was it just to make sure people were buying the "Billy but Shitty" DLC?
---
Ha rank 1? Can't relate, haven't been there since the change.
---
That's ignorant as hell. Everyone knows the totem spawns are a joke.
---
Use enduring and spirit fury. Other two are up to you
---
Had a guy being a dick to his teammates, so I focused on him entirely. I killed the other two but one kept evading me like a trooper and when I finally got him, I thought he deserved the hatch and gave it to him. Thanked me for it and the bad teammate was dissing while the other two defended me
---
Bought it actually :3 
---
This is the one: https://www.etsy.com/listing/668355324/dead-by-daylight-legion-susie-mask?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=susie+mask&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-1&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;frs=1
---
Hey man be happy you got the one! Lol atleast ya got the survivor you wanted. You tunneled the hell outta her bud. One tip tho while you spent your while time in kate everyone else was workin the gens...
---
Thanks for the idea
---
&gt;Taking the phrase to literally mean "pay to win the game" is ridiculous and was clearly never the intention of the definition in the first place.
---
Look. You’re confusing DLC and pay-to-win. You’ve clearly never played a mobile pay-to-win game, or other games that require you to pay in order to even be competitive. 
---
If you think buying DLC for any minute advantage is a pay-to-win system, you’re just wrong. You can have whatever definition you want. That’s your opinion. But objectively, you’re wrong.
---
And your comment just devolved into another incoherent babble like your original post. You’re just rambling on about how the game can’t be fixed and how every single little thing is wrong with it.
---
If you’re so done with this game, and it’s so far broken beyond saving, I don’t know what you’re doing on this sub. 
---
You just seem so miserable and insufferable.
---
I'm actually pretty good but got a bad team lol they all got killed within the first five mins. If someone gets hooked that fast then they're most likely not worth saving
---
~~when survivors post screenshots of the endgame leaderboard showing the killer dc'd~~
---
Now I'm just imagining a survivor asking if a killer would stop tunneling "for a BBQ stack?" And the killer just goes "Rarbecue Stack?"
---
If we're talking balanced perks? Balanced Landing is pretty balanced
---
That's the myers vacuform mask. You can buy them on ebay for like 13 dollars and they are great quality for anyone who's wondering.
---
Disappointment.
---
Realization.
---
*GIRLY SCREAMS*
---
Hitboxes working? Did hell freeze over or something?
---
Use BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury. This is better than bamboozle, pallets are more important to deal with than windows, there is anyways only 1 tile (shack) where Babmoozle could make sence. All the other tiles can be easily played without Bamboozle you just need to learn how to run them.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Dont respect pallets just walk through them if you get stunned who cares. Also if you are close enough to a survivor and he is about to reach a pallet, let him walk to the pallet and hit him right when hes on it, usually he drops the pallet and you get the hit anyways. This way you got rid of 1 pallet and  also the stun with enduring is shorter than your weapon swiping animation.
---
If you uncloak and lunge at the end of the uncloak animation the speedboosts of the lunge and uncloak stack, you can get some hits this way you would normaly not get.
---
When you sneak up on a guy on a generater and he doesnt notice you, depending on what spot on the generator he is, you can bodyblock him to get a free hit.
---
Thats all that came in to my mind for now.
---
What are it that your doing right now? Being toxic? Can only assume your bedtime is coming soon
---
I guessed your comment was related to the main topic of the thread.
---
&lt;3
---
I am going up to Day 100. Once I've finished that, then I'll put some focus on making animations, but spending time on them. Won't be any more daily memes from there, but maybe I'll make the front page again with an animation in the future?
---
Thank you I appreciate it! I did buy the mask. https://www.etsy.com/listing/668355324/dead-by-daylight-legion-susie-mask?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=susie+mask&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-1&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;frs=1
---
And I can see xD not very well but I can
---
Hopefully! Your animations will be great I assume you clearly know what you are doing and I do hope to see you on the front page.
---
Not even close to the same power. Most survivor builds can give you extra time or maybe let you tank an extra hit. 
---
Iri head huntress, insta saw billy, and op nurse builds just instadown you as soon as they find you. Iri head huntress with an ebony mori is basically equivalent to spawning in and having 2 gens to do
---
smh toxic survivors doing the objective 😡😡
---
A balanced game at any rank will have an average of 2 kills. having half the lobbies depip and the other half pip would prevent most upward mobility, also creates abuse as it encourages you to not save that last teammate or two so you can get hatch if the game is going bad.
---
Standing still to say "Hey guess what? You can't down me." is pretty assholy
---
I prob got about 2.5 mil over the course of the event. Im a consistently rank 2 pig main, ik rip, but i pulled out my old main from launch, wraith, and let myself depip. I kicked serious ass floating around rank 10, killed anyone who tbagged and such, and then made clear signs I was down to farm. 9/10 times they accepted, the other 1/10 they tried to betray a kind killer and got decimated. All in all, made some new friends, let a LOT of people escape in the name of being a nice guy, and got 60k bp a game consistently. Really hope they do more of these, it brought out the best of the community.
---
She has 1 fucking hatchet and has to have a purple for 3. You can find cover, iri huntresses are a meme to face if they don't have belt. If they do, just know they used a ton of bp and won't be getting much.
---
Nurse is strong at base so whatever. 
---
Billy is billy. 
---
Survivors at base are typically stronger than a lot of killers at base anyways.
---
However, in so doing, it also discourages build variety and 'fun' in a general sense.
---
It has it’s counters, it’s a good perk, but not overpowered
---
I barely play killer. Sorry I suck
---
Give this man an award.
---
No! The new Left Behind makes the completion of all gens and exit gates silent. It also grants you Deliverance, DS and Mettle of Man if the killer downs you
---
They work, but its effect is almost none. It makes you get to top speed faster, but it’s barely noticeable. Don’t run them
---
The Spirit is a good pick
---
Ah. Okay.  My bad
---
I've got over 1000 hours and as long as I play with friends and dont give a shit on how well it goes I enjoy it. But playing alone now is just not as fun as it used to be when I first bought it
---
My bad, they're multiplicative. 
---
I was doing the (incorrect) math for if you decrease the total time to do the thing by the bonus it provides, aka additive.
---
The CORRECT math, aka the multiplicative, aka the more difficult math, is for the actions being performed faster. I have no idea how I skipped that.
---
yes lmao
---
If you've already unhooked someone safely at least once, and they managed to get caught again, that's on them. Fuck them, ensure your own survival.
---
Number of times I've been bitched out by my team mates far exceeds when the killer does it. I love the times when there's only two survivors left. Exit gates get powered, and I run over to open one of them. During this time, the other survivor is caught and hooked.
---
I am just about to contemplate going to save them, when I see Myers approaching. He pops EW3 and comes at me.
---
According to that other butthurt survivor, I'm meant to run back across the map with that chasing me, all for the unlikely attempt to save them.
---
They need to go read the store page again. One of the dot points says: "Survive together or alone".
---
Well, everyone is entitled to their opinion. As well as speaking out on how they don’t agree with it. However, I thought maybe this guy makes valid points, but I just saw your past posts and all of them are negative towards any poster so, it’s inevitable to expect consistent toxicity from you 😊 have a good day!
---
Wait for the BP event to end.
---
I never understood the term “Genrush”. I guess it’s completely unfathomable that survivors do their job as quickly as possible.
---
Exactly. The full on sweat lords are the 20-somethings who play video games all day.
---
Gettin ready for summer. Radical
---
It ended earlier today.
---
Do you get a lot of use out of Nurse's?  I feel like there are better options there.
---
Is the mask comfortable at least even with low visibility?
---
Well, this proves killers whining about 4 man groups are full of crap.
---
only dick strike because killer mains  think that it strikes their dick with glass
---
That's not what they said. They said they didn't want to give action speed penalties to sick survivors, like how Freddy does. They don't want the most boring part of the game to be even more tedious. 
---
In terms of status effects, the devs seem to be moving away from the idea of exhaustion add-ons and will likely rework a lot them with the add-on reworks coming up.
---
Wait i remember ur name from the tenacity perk comment. Hello
---
Yep, accurate.
---
Most tunnel and face camp incidents are when a killer gets butthurt that a survivor dared to run away and loop for a bit. That's not toxic.
---
I understand when they camp the little shits who teabag and flashlight click to endlessly taunt killers during a chase.
---
But the majority are not toxic. They're simply playing.
---
Another thing I find that killers assume is toxic are cosmetics. Equip a bright hair cosmetic and you're magically toxic.
---
Wait wtf i found your comment again in another post. WTFF
---
We'll sit around the campfire and sing our campfire song.
---
Good to know for when i play miss gangrenous next
---
Okay, complete avoid my counter-argument and change the subject. 😂 Have fun with your pre 3:00 no, weekend DBD.
---
When you say your teammates likely aren't worth saving, then I'd say you've still got a lot to learn.
---
It's alright. It's kinda hard to breathe in it but it should hopefully be okay. I haven't worn it for a long period of time yet tho
---
Decides it wants to spawn literally next to a gen
---
Your Freddy-ing the Ruin then, Ruin is not that strong of a perk, its just the only perk that has a chance of slowing generators for a decent amount of time. A CHANCE mind you, having it have a run time will just make sure that in the rare chance its not found, its useless anyway, and once again, a massive fuck you to trapping killer who can protect totems.
---
Most good players worth their salt either find the ruin themselves or Power through it. Again your literally just freddy-ing Hex Ruin, nerfing it because Bad players don't know how to deal with it while at the same time making sure that its effectiveness in high ranks is 100% negated because even if the ruin is not found its deactivated.
---
Sure they can nerf Ruin, once they fix generator times, Ruin is a band aid fix (and a unreliable one at that) for the issue of survivors being able to power through generators faster then a killer can work if the survivors have half a brain between them.
---
Most of the time, if I see you found the hatch, I'm just walking away. Hatch standoffs are stupid and sad. I do love it though when I'm actively trying to get their attention so they can find it to end the game, and they think I'm camping it. Just pop out and say hey. If they keep camping it, just go do the gems. More points anyway.
---
This would make rank meaningless.

Or the ground floor of the smaller building.
---
Well, those last forever, but that’s not really the Doctor’s fault lol. Overcharge skillchecks aren’t the hardest and making sure you don’t do 3 gens right next to each other is easier. Freddy games are more consistently long for me. Although I’m not sure why people still use that Doc build. Even vs mediocre survivors they can usually slowly win.
---
If you're tired, have a nap /s
---
don't all us females
---
...wait
---
Ah yup no worries.
---
Some survivors are the weakest link and always get found then cry that they were tunnelled. So yup just saying I'm not completely insane, and know the difference between legit tunnelling and just finding the same lemming over and over again. :)
---
How could the bubba resist being near that handsome man
---
Lmao. What this guy is saying is basically the old pipping system. Which was horrid.
---
I know.  I rather have outright random matches or a party lobby.
---
Like, a lobby of 40 survivors and 8 killers. The survivors are randomly matched and the killer player is chosen at lottery. The rest are spectators for the match are ghosts ala bomberman.
---
They can make noise, block windows, slow interactions, speed up interactions , set bear traps and so on. Essentially, grief/ assist survivors and killers equally.
---
Death to the ranking system.  It doesn't do anything for anyone aside from making match making take longer.
---
Can't upvote cuz legion.
---
10/10 would camp too even tho i hate camping
---
Probably trying to fix what was left of his emblems.
---
Wtf are you even talking about
---
Probably wanted to see some more of that t-bag action
---
Killer main here.  I see the toxic ones all the time. Usually as SWF. I just ignore it. It's a game. I won't cry over a game.
---
Nope! I don’t throw the game and tunnel one particular survivor to death when I play killer, either.
---
R/translator
---
Rotflmfao!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I guess my viewpoint is a bit different because I play solo survivor, so I don't think I get paired with SWF that often. But yeah, when I play killer I always seem to run into the dick heads.
---
~~Chaos.~~Fun. Pure unadulterated ~~chaos~~ Fun
---
Ah that’s hot
---
Wait so the difference from a regular skull indicating death and that weird slashed skull indicating death is that a slashed one gives more BP?
---
All that’s missing is the DC symbols on the bottom left and it would be perfect.
---
Also being asleep has significant debuffs. Wraith only hits, Freddy stalls.
---
s h i r t l e s s  m y e r s  m o r i  m e p l e a s e
---
Go make one of those masks and show us all how little effort it takes, then
---
That is what it is damn
---
No it's not. A coordinated SWF group that's keeping tight communication *SHOULD* be stronger than a killer using normal add-ons.

What are you talking about? The mask is the only part I said was difficult
---
How dare you kill everyone, your literal job. Don't you know they are entitled to get a free hatch every time, and teabag you before they take it?
---
You're giving everyone who is watching deep wound and a severe case of toxic and DC
---
Did this to a wraith earlier today with a flashlight, some of the most fun I ever had.
---
Lmao David President

Yeah if someone gets that 4% you just gotta leave em alone, like they deserve that lol

20 minute que time are u serious , ım living central eurpo and got match for pc  4 minute.

EXACTLY

Private everything on PS4 profile pick leather face. Face camp insidious! They rage In silence
---
Bigger than a great skill check. If you can hit those you should be able to hit anything.
---
Forgot the part where the guys ping is at the very least 150
---
what is slugging ? haven't played in a while
---
*dc sound*
---
how do i put it on?
---
Had to style on em!
---
too funny lmfao
---
Didn't kick enough gens.
---
TBAG ME HARDER DADDY
---
I like the idea but no way in hell Disney would allow it.
---
What’s on the menu?
---
I was being an ass and got what i deserve. To be fair, I befriended him afterwards and gave advice on how to play a better leatherface.
---
I pipped while farming during the bloodhunt. I didn't kill a single soul and I got to rank 1 (from rank 9). Only one pip a match though!
---
I had a great time farming!  I maimed killers and got Hag and Trapper up to level 41, and Wraith up to level 20.  BBQ was amazing.  😁
---
Then again I did message every survivor I could in the lobby that I was friendly, farming, and running BBQ.  😅
---
I leveled up trapper during the event because he was the only killer I didn't have lvl50. I was actually surprised how fun he is to play.
---
If there are two people left, and enough gens done for the hatch to spawn, whoever gets found first is dead. That's my rule. If I get hooked, I'm dying for you, and I expect the same. 
---
It would take a miracle to pull off an 2v1 with three gens left. Hatch is there for a reason, and if I can't make it, I'm at least trying to help you get it. Blows my mind when I get rage messages from the other survivor who got hooked. 
---
"Why didn't you save me? Awful teammate." The fuck do you want me to do? Heal you and then we're back to square 1?
---
*I think we did a pretty good job intensifies*

PS4 sucks bro

Now that does put a smile on my face

Ah shit, here we go again
---
^^
---
This was me earlier. First decent ping. I brought brand new part and streamers. I never got to even touch a gen and had a hide in locker forever team. Sad days.
---
What's a 4k? I'm not familiar with the lingo
---
How about about providing some arguments to back up your points as opposed to just typing run-on sentences that only serve to be contrarian to what I'm saying?
---
Lmaooooo
---
Thank you! Gonna try that next time!
---
You can hook up your PS4 controller to your PC, take the charger and plug it i. Your PC, but you'll likely get destroyed, as I've made that same switch as well, and the skill cap for the controller is a lot lower than it is for keyboard. Honestly, I'd recommend playing more games on PC to get used to the keyboard and mouse stuff, it takes practice and stuff as well...
---
Dude understand my pain. Got the game and I got s daily ritual for sabotage hooks and it was glitched. If you pressed R2 it would start the animation but cancel immediately. Did it for everyone in the lobby too
---
:(

I never farm out of fear of them changing there mind mid farm and I end up rip.
---
BPS are stressful when I bring them, I think it makes people DC more because of the pressure
---
Doesn’t change the fact that nurse, insta saw billy, in iri/infantry huntress are all 0 counterplay free wins
---
Or better yet, you wait for 5+ plus minutes for a lobby just for the killer to DC as soon as u join
---
You can't whip the camera around as fast with as good of accuracy when you blink slightly too far with a controller, thus making you miss a lot more. You basically have to be flipping the camera around mid flight. Very hard to use her power for us. Not impossible, but you have to be really good to even fix a slight mistake.
---
I highly disagree here, unless you give an indicator as to who is SWF. Then I know when to bring my ebonies.
---
So... Legion?
---
Proof of rank 1 killer ?
---
For pressing M1? Ehh not to me.
---
did you smash yet
---
Nah the RNG and luck would be the reason I'd let them go
---
I like how this got a down vote
---
Shhh it just works
---
David President really sells it.
---
I... Had a feeling. For some reason I thought they might count as sacrifices, regardless, but..
---
I like to play the long game.
---
Well I mean you were sprayed with pepper
---
Jesusfuk my asshole prolapsed
---
If I bring them as a killer, I make it clear I want the points, and prove I'm not going to sacrifice them. Then we have a good time.
---
that too, once on my first brand new part i got both skillchecks and before the gen could get finished the killer dc'ed i was so sad about that all day long after
---
Go figure, right? X3
---
Lol yeah
---
after about 20-30 hours in the game he shouldnt bother you at all
---
Always gonna upvote Charlie Chaplin.
---
How are you doing?
---
Pretty good. Just watching Parks and Recreation. Hbu?
---
actually that nea: Urban Evasioning away
---
&gt;Killer bias
---
Were you even around when vacuum pallets or infinites were a thing?
---
I mean somewhat of a method they could do is just that all dull totems are revealed to the killer and either the killer stores the hex and must got to a totem to light it and give that totem the effect of the hex. So then at least a killer is able to control the spawn location, or hold onto a hex for some sneaky late game hex plays. 
---
OR a Totem is lit on the map as normal ,but a killer can extract the hex, deactivating it until the killer lights another totem, that way you can at least stop survivors if you managed to chase them off a hex.
---
oh really ? wow i've been doing that since i started playing (i would hook the downed survivor if i thought the other survivor wasn't near) usually i did it if i knew where the last guy was or their general direction.
---
Yup
---
ok
---
I'm building a Pathfinder character.
---
Why not just spell out plague?
---
Nice 👌🏻
---
Maybe not pipping is the reward
---
Or just have it be their is no Tiers on the bloodweb, you unlock the perk like a teachable, but then you can click on the perk and upgrade it through bloodpoints on a different menu. So you still have the ranks but once you find it on the bloodweb its not a diceroll to get its 2 upgrades.
---
Time to dc every game.
---
For killers, yeah. Survivors have the ones where they start the trial together or far from the killer. I wish there were more so it was actually a surprise.
---
As well as rewarding killers for playing poorly themselves.
---
What does this even mean? Are you purposely talking in fragments?
---
Deserved
---
Heck yeah
---
Haha what the fu-
---
Earlier today I DCed after I brought BPS and I don't DC, I felt so guilty, the killer had survivor pudding and destroyed us then slugged me
---
He just needs NoEd
---
It actually has nothing to do with the killer. There are even builds focused around endgame, so your "point" is just salt. NOED punishes survivors for not doing totems.
---
Yeah. I usually wait around 1-10 minutes. Averaging 7 minutes for the last month. Im a huge stat nerd lol.
---
I got a bot who sent a picture of that girl lol
---
Cause it's pronounced plag
---
Oh damn...
---
So we're gonna ignore the survivors posting their team making it out alive and being like "gg it was a baby killer, ez git gud lmao"
---
Because its a extremely basic method of audience retention. They have no major progression systems, no real incentive to rank or level up. So as a method to try and keep players they introduce a grind, so it forces to play the game 5 times more then normal just for you to get to things you enjoy, its why 90% of base killers are trash, its why every single 'solution' to frustrating game elements is ''''fixed''' through perks or addons, its why half the killer reworks are literally just changing a tiny amount of mechanics, then slapping a bunch of addons on so that with those you can be marginally less crap (Doctor,Wraith,Legion and ill bet my ass Freddy).
---
The game is frustrating with no major progression and most people are still playing just for that chance to squeeze that fun chase or close game out of it. So they have the grind aswell, so regardless of anything you still gotta keep slapping that bloodpoint generator so that you can maybe get that BBQ on your doctor or that Self Care on your David so that MAYBE, just maybe, you can have a enjoyable match.
---
I think so. They should probably make more offerings hidden, just to up the mystery. Usually you know a hidden is a mori, the only real mystery is which one, and obviously at high ranks it's probably ebony
---
This event has brought the worst behaviours from most of the killers I've played against. I wonder how they can even be having fun at this point.
---
My point isn't salt. I'm a killer main rank 1. I just find it hilarious people build noed because they know they are bad and are gonna need it.
---
Go watch a man named fungoose. He's only had the exit gates powered against him a handful of times this year. I can't even remember the last time I've seen a survivor escape out of the exit gates on his stream. 
---
Fact is if you are good at the video game, you can 3 or 4k every single round as killer without noed even against toxic survivors.
---
It makes me so mad sometimes that they really have the gall to complain about survivors doing anything. Most times I laugh though.

---
I tried some 4 man SWF earlier and the queues were absolutely abysmal. I’m solo queuing now, and the lobbies are near instantaneous.
---
This is an excellent idea! It would require a bit of fleshing out but i think this is definitely on the right track towards the right improves for totems perks
---
&gt; because they know they are bad and are gonna need it
---
Did you completely miss the part where I said there are literally builds based around endgame? 
---
And nobody said anything about not getting to endgame or not. Like I said, salt.
---
Nice, you even got the 180 pound weight going on too
---
Why would you build around end game if you can end the game before it even gets there? I don't get it.
---
It seems that your problem is finding survivors. I recommend using aura detecting perks. The one perk I always use is Whispers. BBQ and Chili, Iron Maiden, and that one perk that detects other survivors within 16 meters if you slug a survivor (I forgot what it is called), are strong perks as well.
---
What system do you play on? I'd gladly do Kill Your Friends mode to help you practice.
---
Had a killer today tunnel whoever the hooked survivor was, and the one unhooking got away. 
---
Down to the last two survivors, I’m one of them and the other gets hooked. Killer walks away, I unhook with BT and even take a hit mid chase. They still got tunneled. I was then reported because I crouched on the hatch instead of unhooking them again. 
---
Was I in the wrong or nah?
---
When was the last time a good Feng Min cosmetic came out. Oh wait
---
I’m not a huge fan of farming. The games take forever to end and get very boring. 
---
As for it being bannable? Don’t work with the killer to screw over an unwilling survivor.
---
Think about it dipshits, if you ruin the game for all the survivors that you play against then there’s going to be nothing to play. Also @harraakviking get your panties outta of a bunch and use your brain and think if you were on the other side. You pussies main killer because it’s the easiest way and you’re lazy fucks. I could go into rank 5 game and play as Michael,legion, or hillbilly without having any skill and get a 3-4 man. Now I go into a rank 5 game as survivor by myself with 3 randoms. It’s a try hard nurse with an ebony who gets angry about me looping her blinks and Moris me first. Say she didn’t have a mori? I get my shit facecamped. Go on a gen and let my teammates die? I might get hatch. Killers have op perks, op add ons, and an op add on along with some of them being op themselves. Killer mains are a bunch of wining ass babies who don’t get their way  so they cry to the devs and when that doesn’t work they take it out on the survivors who complain to this website like it’s their free fucking therapist
---
"This game is fun, you'll see"  
---
\*get camped by a fucking leatherface for three matches\*
---
… Or some people just want to have fun and like playing for endgame. 
---
For the third time, nothing but salt.
---
I consider it if the other survivors are on board when the match starts.
---
When I'm killer, I don't ask to farm. If 2+ streamers get played, I have a system:
---
I find the first survivor and do some weird shit. Like standing behind a tree and slowly twitching out from the side of it. 
---
If the survivor reciprocates with rubbernecking or enthusiastic teabagging, the farm begins. 
---
If the other survivors understand what's going on but clearly don't give a shit, it's back to a normal game and I might just give the original survivor a free pass for trying.
---
The last one remind me of h20 Delirious
---
Well yeah if you want to be toxic then noed is the perfect perk. If that's what you consider fun lmao
---
The problem is that survivors can fart the right way and get out of dream transition, pick a gen, self care on the spot, find a ally and bam your basically awake and freddy has nothing to show for it.
---
Plus the fact that his power does nothing in a chase, and still gives him little map pressure. People sorta want freddy to be more then a M1 killer with a 7 second to activate Dying light Debuff and yes whole you can be good at him, it requires like half the effort to be as effective with most other killers.
---
mathematically speaking, you get both for a lower price.
---
I'd say buy from the store.
---
You forgot a couple hindered zeros
---
And splinters
---
made with mematic
---
As long as you dont mind being called bitch
---
Yeah kates the best
---
Yeah, me too. My only beef with is when I get some good games and rank up. Longer loading and WAY more toxic survivors.
---
I mean technically toolbox and perks but that more of a formality.
---
I suppose alot of the Gen rushing issues just comes from the fact that its actually quite hard for some killer to apply map wide pressure especially when the survivors know how to handle a loop and you have the rest of the team magnetized to the closest gen.
---
no I drink gogo juice
---
Narrow vision perfect for tunneling. You are really committed to the character
---
The best was a Legion, surprising enough on Thursday night, we all maxed out are points even the survival, he had us wiggle free for those and one Dwight offered himself up for sacrifice so the Legion could hopefully pip and get extra points. We had 3 BPS and 1 bound envelope and he was running survivor pudding and he made it fun!
---

And here's the first one I did, "Remember Me" with Freddy and Meg! They're fairly similar, so I'll make sure the posing on the next one is very different. [https://i.imgur.com/oyItcMV.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/oyItcMV.jpg)
---
I see the trolls ran through here an downvoted all your comments lol
---
I like the ideas you have, very creative
---
I truly don’t understand how selective some people’s memories are on this sub. It has always bounced between both groups claiming the other side has it easier.
---
im hungry
---
The DS weapon was a very nice addition. Good job!
---
I mean, Internet can still fail you
---
I don’t play survivor often so I don’t think I’ve ever appreciated just how much easier it is to see in that corn from third person. That corn feels so much more claustrophobic from the Killer’s perspective, like you’re just wrapped in shucks.
---
Use Ruin to ease the gen rush. BBQ and Chilli will help with detection and you have to just keep pressure. Honestly once you get the hang of things "patrolling" gens isn't something you think about too much, you just check them to find people. Both Hag and Billy are excellent with map pressure. The key with Billy is always be pressuring. Hook someone, check your BBQ and Chilli procs and immediately chainsaw over there. Always prioritize chasing someone off a gen versus someone in the middle of nowhere doing fuck-all. With Hag don't chase. Make sure your traps are set at choke points all around the map, hit someone, chase them until either they run into your trap/you get a chance to hit them or until someone else runs into one then teleport. And don't do the thing where you trap the hook with more than one trap. 
---
I wouldnt worry about hook defending too much unless you know someone is in the area or you see someone running there, you lose pressure like this. With one person on the hook, that's one person not doing anything. At least one other person has to come get them so that's officially two people not doing anything. If you can find someone else you now have three people not doing anything. You can see how much it slows the objective down.
---
I had a person with Object Of Obsession and No Mither. They just t-bagged and pointed at hooks. When I hooked them, they immediately killed themselves. IDK why...
---
Myers with M&amp;A and that terror radius reduction add-on
---
You don’t look like a 40ish year old person who has been doing a variety of illegal drugs for the past ten years. 
---
Other than that, lookin good so far!
---
Unless it's double bloodpoints and the survivors ask I don't farm. If it is double bloodpoints and I see they put in streamers I just hook everyone twice and let them out at the end.
---
Do they have an account I can follow? This is really nice.
---
One, potential mori isnt really a counter
---
/weirdestboners
---
I frequent this subreddit.
---
i'm happy because i went from level 50 david to level 50 p2 david during the event :)
---
i'm also happy that i only got one sweaty nurse during the event and that most of the killers i ran into were either nice and let everybody live, played fair in general but still got kills, or just straight up farmed 
---
lots of good vibes!
---
Yo
---
monkaS. Addiction?
---
I don’t get it sometimes, but I like the warm, fuzzy feeling inside when I know I made up for it after being a complete dick with Barbeque and Billy
---
This is exactly what I think is wrong with the game lol, it’s either play with friends and get made fun of by the killer. Play without friends and get made fun of by the other survivors. Or play killer and always get made fun of by someone.
---
Actually I did that to combine both of my comments. I don't give a fuck about karma. I don't even know what it does.
---
I still need to get it. Nea right?
---
Well it's really all killers have left to complain about really after nerfs to pallets ,flashlight, and ds even though they still complain about all those things.
---
I love you for doing this

They're still around, but they only exist for the licensed killers (Myers, Leatherface, the like) and if you have them already they won't show up in the bloodweb. At least as far as I'm aware.

joji as the next survivor pls

I don’t- I play by ear/emotion and every time I play it, there’s variations in the chords I play left hand. Melody with the right hand is always the same though (with a lil mix of extra key-tapping or some such for flair)

Down for me on pc right now. Are mondays update night?
---
*him
---
Hmm, was thinking the same thing except on PC. My last game about 15 minutes ago worked fine. Now I'm searching for a game forever...
---
On PC, and every time I enter the game I get a message on the title screen saying, “EAC client cannot be instantiated.” I dont know what’s up.
---
I think it's a great perk. It gives BP bonuses which is nice, and it gives killers a good direction of where to go. The fact that it shows auras is super great because it incentives not camping hooks.
---
No idea honestly on when the update night is for PC. Usually its Thursday on ps4
---
Need someone that'll facecamp me irl :(
---
Completely dead killer lobbies are a sign that something is very wrong. That NEVER happens
---
Restart and it will say you can't connect to the servers
---
Hmm. Guess Im done playing DBD for the night
---
Did that and I’m happy to report I did get my stuff back
---
Ive restarted the game twice on PS4 and it still let me in, but its dead
---
Yeah, I can’t get in match as survivor or killer. It’s been over 30 minutes for me
---
Yes, I'm having problems connecting, too.
---
What if they have deliverance tho?
---
Im on ps4, cant get online. I was havin trouble finding lobbies, restarted the game and now I cant access servers, for like 10-15 min now.
---
seems like the servers are down. people closing the game can't get back in, lobbies aren't filling with people in queue etc.
---
Servers are down on their end
---
Suvvies genrush and then cry about NOED. Sooooo
---
Its happening cross platform, Im down on PS4
---
 seems like the servers are down. people closing the game can't get back in, lobbies aren't filling with people in queue etc.
---
It does usually take a while to find a game as killer; however, it seems that a lot of people are having issues connecting to the servers right now.
---
Im on ps4, its down for me as well.
---
The stats demonstrate that across the board the same perks are pretty much used regardless of level. This tells me that maybe they need to make some tweaks to the others.
---
Guess we're done for the night, haha
---
Nice mask! where did you get it or did you make it yourself?
---
Im down on Xbox
---
You said that Doctors running Ruin and Unnerving make the game last forever. Well, that's not true since Unnerving makes Ruin skillchecks easy since your only option is to hit great skill checks. Great skillchecks are easier to hit if the whole zone is a great skillcheck.
---
I hope that helps make everything easier to understand for you.
---
The best change is to remove speed buff so that only killers good enough to hot you in the first place get use out of it
---
When people play for rank, you'll be right.
---
Oh I gotcha, but I haven't bought a single thing lol
---
Well the huntress and the person that came with her (David king I think) but thats cuz it was free
---
If he does nothing else 4 people can win against a 3-gen.
---
I know! Especially because as soon as you move the LS in that motion, like turning and returning to straight in a chase, it cancels whatever you are doing, makes you stand still and "wiggle". Suuuuupeeeerr annoying
---
Dude stop, let me go!
---
Ok you're not getting it
---
Michael say his Window of Opportunity and took it.
---
Nea or Feng
---
Anyone’s basement is never safe(source: me)
---
Everything seems dead for now, even for PC, which is weird. No Tweets or any information yet from Devs.
---
Assuming it's something related to the game.
---
Farming is like sex, you should have the consent of all parties involved before proceeding. It's also pretty boring and takes forever.
---
Oof
---
I remember her hatchets had a clunk sound when she's hit people. Like if you smack one of the cars on an autohaven map.
---
Base killers meaning without perks? 
---
Because if you mean the non DLC characters the top 2 (billy/nurse) are base game.
---
No, cause it's worse on the other side as a solo player. I can always just play better/ramp up my cutthroatness as killer, can't make my teammates not be terrible or prevent a killer from camping/tunneling if they aren't completely garbage.
---
First time opening the game in months lol xD
---
Adding on to this, I wasn't getting any games, so I restarted, and now I get an 8014 error, saying I "Cannot connect to online services. Please try again later."
---
I hope this is a good sign, like the update is coming tomorrow, or something else important is happening.
---
Xbox is down. If you smash the A button until you get past the connection errors then you’ll sit in lobby hell. Can’t get a game as killer or survivor.
---
Instantiated is even a word?
---
This doesn't look like an update, or maintenance. This is odd
---
I tried using new ds for a week and I rarley got to use it because the killer would just slug me for a minute then hook me after time is up
---
Should have been an ultra rare trapper addon. Traps no longer lock survivors in place, they instead reduce movement speed by 50% and give a permanent injured state.
---
Feels bad man. Don't worry, they must be doing something about it
---
My usual response to Michael tbh
---
Maybe you should change how you play Instead of whining in Reddit
---
Yes, it is :(
---
The big broken gives it away.
---
EXACTLY, It kinda makes me laugh sometimes, cause it's funny to think that in a world where my character is trying to survive from some blood thirsty killer, they just feel the overwhelming need to wiggle all the time lol. No but seriously I can't count how many times I got killed just cause in the middle of a chase my character just stopped to wiggle!
---
This happened on my last game. I'm not sure who pop the gen first or if we both finished at the same time (it looks like it to me).
---
The thing is, there didn't seem to be notification for both. Just for one. Am I wrong? Didn't want to take chances either way and snuck myself out.
---
Also, Pig with Devour Hope was scary. Thankfully someone fixed that real quick.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again, gas canisters or something like it. Survivors pick them up from one of two spots, can only carry one at a time, and drop and spill it if they run. Extend the repair time and shorten it for each gas cannister (to a limit, obviously have to test for balancing) that has been added.
---
This lets the killer disrupt gens better without completely screwing up all other balance.
---
Two notifications. Exactly the same frequency as what Survivors normally experience.
---
IS THAT HITLERR??????????? :0 :0 :0 /s
---
Nice Charlie Chaplin meme.
---
I got accused of wall hacking for using Bloodhound. They were hiding in a locker next to the underground generator on Haddonfield. Couldn’t understand that he had a bright neon pool around him.
---
What the hell is up with that person’s eyebrow?
---
I don't get it.
---
I'm getting that too
---
I disagree fundamentally. The game is in a better place than it was but it's still pretty heavily Survivor sided.
---
ye eac errors for me. Can't even load into the lobby. Though it was an issue with the anti cheat so opened the anti cheat and repaired for DBD, nothing then re-installed still nothing. At least it's (hopefully) just a server issue.
---
My comment was a joke dude. 
---
While yeah I agree with you somewhat, she is an above average killer and given how many bad killers there are you’d have to put her above mid tier. Sure Nurse, Billy and Spirit are clearly above her. Who else would you rank higher? Hag or Plague?
---
Also lots of killers are map dependent. Billy won’t do as well on lery’s, Hag is crippled on rotten fields. Thats just the game
---
can I have a link to that tweet im on twitter right now but do not see it
---
Just to rule out a possible problem, I recommend checking your graphics card temperature when booting up DBD.
---
It was fine this morning on ps4, I got home from work and wait times seemed crazy long. Then I got booted and am getting an error code. I thought it was just me but it looks like there’s something going on :(
---
How is it survivor sided? The only thing I really see that could be considered survivor sided is mettle of man.
---
feels about right
---
i just now read all of it lol. i was like wtf I do not see it XD
---
Never got an error code myself. Just nothing happens for me. Constantly looking for a group. Quit, ill try again in a couple hours.
---
Upvoted for George
---
99% of the time that's the case. I guarantee it.
---
Oh yeah being random is so funny
---
Came here to ask the same. Been waiting 30 mins for a lobby. Got one and then the killer DC’d.
---
Talk about eye contact
---
According to who? You? K.
---
I've been getting an EAC error for a few minutes now and from the looks of it so have quite a few people as well.
---
no you don't
---
Wasn’t there just a meme about killers not wanting to be called babies and now here they are calling the survivors babies. I’ll never understand the hypocrisy of this sub
---
Aww
---
I still think they should change that, especially if you're running something like Deliverance. There's such a small chance that it'll work, but it's still a chance.
---
Oh yes
---
The entire game is basically inaccessible for all platforms. It's not just ps4.
---
Survivors have an advantage from the start
---
What perks? Ruin does jack shit against good survivors, they'll just power through it or cleanse the totem in the first 30 seconds. Corrupt can work, but its only really used to help Trapper and Hag control an area of 4 gens. Pop is only usable with high mobility killers, and Overcharge is garbage. Perks dont help that much against gen speeds.
---
As for maps, there really arent any killer sided maps, aside from MAYBE Pale Rose. There are much much more survivor sided maps, and around 7 where its literally impossible to win if the survivors have at least two braincells.
---
Second chance perks are super dumb. You mentioned MoM, which is the worst offender yeah, but so many others can let survivors escape for free. Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, DS, they all can let survivors get out for free, which I think is too powerful for simply a perk.
---
i cant even get on the game
---
I farm if i have killer daily's that i'm incompetent at i.e hot garbage billy that i am.  
---
The other exception if there is two/three man load in or double blood point weekend. I don't like to do it to much as i find it drags after numerous matches as a killer.
---
Oh, I feel kinda bad now
---
Rank 38? That's impressive.
---
That's a pretty funny glitch
---
haha aights. we both know it even if you dont want to admit it
---
Yeah I’ve only been in this subreddit for a few days but I already know what goes on around here
---
Good thing I got this free on ps+ and never bought any dlc.
---
Spare Ace's life from this monstrosity.
---
hmm... why do I never see actual good killers running noed unless they are being toxic then?
---
Tomorrow (Tuesday) or Thursday at latest.
---
Still broken on PS
---
I almost thought it was going to be daddy vsauce
---
i hate how relatable this is
---
Where do you think save data is stored and where matches are made?
---
Billy, Spirit and Huntress have very good yellow and green add-ons. Not every SWF team is a Depip Squad. Most of them can be defeated with an normal, but good build. But against a Depip Squad, nothing but Nurse and Spirit with their best add-ons can win.
---
still can't find games on xbox

Ash has some up his puppet

It make no sense and I haven't got an adept for a killer in forever as well since the bad rank system :/
---
Is that an offer or just a statement?
---
Seriously, I don't use NOED for a whole bunch of reasons, chiefly because I main Myers and it's a waste of a perk slot, but after that muddled diatribe I'm tempted to give it a go just to see how many survivors like you I can piss off.
---
Woah really? I expect DBD to suck, but Blizzard too?
---
I think its defnitely under Top 3. It's just really good to get twice the amount of bp. Imagine you used bbq from the start of playing killer so you pretty much got double the progress you wouldnt have without it. I really just use it for the bp. And its goten so far that i dont want to play any other killer that doesn't have bbq. Its high up there with ruin but i think in terms of that its the best perk to have
---
lol yes you become less salty, cause the objective kind of changes, at least to me.
---
Those are legitimate things to say, I make a note as killer to never go after the last person unhooked, it just feels like a moral priority, noed is a perk for noobs so I mean, if they complain they're kinda dumb
---
If gender could be slowed down than puberty might’ve been a less confusing time for me
---
You do have a point
---
As a killer main: yeah
---
As a solo survivor main: I am already dead inside
---
Get in your role. Like I get those threats too from salty survivors, it makes me smile since I'm the bad guy in the game and I did my job right. It's like you're watching a stereotypical action movie with a happy ending and you go "fuck that" and kill everybody, and the survivors, those action movie fans have to swallow it lol that's how I see it
---
r/ihadastroke
---
I am at rank 10 and i have to wait 30 min for my lobbies
---
Not sure what you are talking about in the title
---
Freddy is made to not tunnel and switch between prey.
---
oh waw lol
---
and he did a pretty good one
---
You have no choice if you want to level him up.
---
Is that really the right option? My other games are preforming just fine, so is it really a windows issue? If it is I will sure do it, but if thats not the answer, thats a whole lot for no gain. Thanks for the thought though.
---
Odd, I had amazing people on both sides this weekend, only got a mori once and it was a cypress and the survivors I was up against were pretty friendly all around.
---
Does give you an offering for the next event that uses them.
---
Bloody Steadfasts...
---
No idea if it’s the right option but whenever I have a problem I reinstall windows and it always fixes it. Takes time but it’s worth it for me. I usually reinstall windows every few months.
---
Practise.
---
When they kobe, clap em like shaq
---
Thats why i rotate killers and survivor. And am critical of both sides. The game is intended for you to play both sides.
---
Freddy is unplayable if you don't tunnel hard
---
Understandable
---
Sweet collectable! Heck yeah!
---
I dunno I still hit rank 1 3 days after reset, it's not really that hard. Red ranks are boring af tho, same people over and over and over.
---
Lunar Vessels here I come!
---
I just say the perk is too linear, not enough use, if the killer even likes to slug a little bit, the timer is gone, if the killer isn't tunneling it has no use, if you get in a chase, you sorta just have to go down for you to use the perk, I feel it's timer should pause while in a chase or on the ground and I might use it
---
Patches normally come out 2 weeks after the start of their PTBs.
---
As such, it'll be today (7th May) at about 16:30 BST.
---
I get why people wanna do Susie now.
---
Pressing X to doubt.
---
&gt;ravenous player base
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I never realised the lullaby changes. Does it reset when you leave the lullably radius?
---
Holy shit, this isn't a half bad idea and it provides a whole other objective. Yes, please.
---
I'd really love to see a video of a survivor playing well and contributing and only safe pipping, because I've had plenty of survivor games where I do absolutely nothing and pip.
---
There are splinters for any unowned dlc killers, not just licensed ones.
---
Just something I like to push people's buttons about. Most people I've run into that act like everyone is out to get them (for both survivor and killer) has their profiles on private. Additionally, some of the most toxic people I've run into also have their profile on private. It's a way to avoid accountability and I have very little respect for people who do this.
---
But not everyone who has their profile private is inherently a weenie. That's just the trend I've noticed while playing.
---
This is something i'll never understand. 
---
*"I got shat on so i'll ruin some other people's games next round, that'll teach em!"*
---
Ah, I see you want to be p3 Claudette when you grow up.
---
I mean if the killer was being a dick and tunneling me the whole game I'd die and give them the hatch if I see they found it.
---
I didn't know those icon moving indicates that obsession being Chased. 
---
Also what's wrong with being stealthy and do whatever necessarily to survive?
---
I mean it's one thing to be stealthy to the detriment of the mission or other player. It is quite another to be stealthy to lengthen your survival rate, thus you can help other as well.
---
I think it's stupid to be unnecessarily boisterous when doing the opposite accomplishes the mission better.
---
The bethesda maneuver
---
just facecamp as doc with treatment mode activated and smash that m1 button when someone tries to dive the hook, ontop of that use noed to bash the last two ppl :)
---
Yes because survivors can't tea bag, flick their flashlights, and send hatemail afterwards.
---
That's reaal fun for the killer. Then the killer goes full mori irredescent next game or some poor saps that didn't deserve it
---
Just take some crack and don’t sleep for a week and it’ll be perfect.
---
Not sure if they changed it, but the Huntress would get more aggravated the longer she went without seeing a survivor. Once you found someone, it'd go back to the sweet lullaby. I'm fairly sure they changed how that worked, but I could be wrong.
---
This video is gold :D Love it :D
---
Fuck you on about, its just ugly. u dum
---
I send them dick pics works a treat.
---
It’s a trap
---
I think so too. For me, legion's masks are the one thing you need to get right.
---
(Happy cake day)
---
Just run meme builds at laugh in face of dead survs. I laughed so hard when 1 man dc'd while i was playing heavy smoker nurse w/o perks.
---
Wait what if their into that?
---
This is the face i picture, when I make love to my boyfriend.
---
What would be the point? Killers would simply wait on hook to see if the last survivor kobes and smack them down.
---
I worry about your safety ma'am

---
Thot
---
How did my friends shitty cosplay get almost as many upvotes as this and a silver award? This is awesome, my friend and I just did a meme lol
---
LMAO look at the angry bois downvoting you. You're literally right
---
Yeah, honestly, with constantly getting connected to 400 ping south american players, having to wait 20 minutes to find a lobby, half the games starting with 3 or less people and the fact that the entire time this game has been out they've never really tried to balance it, they just change it to killer sided or survivor sided for that patch then switch it back.... I'd saying DC'ing shouldn't even be punishable at this point until the devs get the game up to snuff.
---
Who am I kidding though, the player base will die off way before that happens.
---
I have no source for a map layout but I can give you some advice (1000+ hour player here). Since the map layout is more or less random, it is easier to try to memorize the tiles. there isn't actually that much different ones (even though they tend to be a bit creative with the new maps).  
---
When not in a chase, try to look around when you are within a tile and memorize where windows and pallets usually spawn (That's usually your way out. Period). It may take some time but knowing where to find pallets and windows makes the difference between gg and bg.
---
whilst, yes, it sucks to be tunnelled. You obviously don't have to oblige to making others feel better. It's more of a personal thing, I don't tunnel because I play a lot of survivor too and know that it sucks to be on the recieving end. Unless they play scummy, then I'll just kill them and get it over with.
---
It's useually the people that don't give a shit that have a lot and the salty losers that do have below aversge karma that beg for karma.
---
What you say about BBQ isn’t all that accurate anymore, you’d be surprised how many people (me included) hop in a locker the moment someone’s downed.
---
drop and spill it if they run? no ty. maybe the amount of gas in it just slowly deteriorates whilst you sprint.
---
If a killer does thia, it's not about the survivors. It's about him... Not to get shit on twice in a row.
---
do their objective* if they waste time cleansing dull totems when they should be repairing, they don't make it to endgame in the first place.
---
well of course, this subreddit has always been killer biased because it's mostly killer mains. I've seen more survivors appearing though but it literally used to just be killer mains so
---
Some tips I feel would be useful: learn the timing for her blink. Learn how long it takes to charge, and how much you need to charge to show up right behind the Survivor. Practice this _without_ charge speed add-ons.
---
Don't swing unless you _know_ you're close enough for the hit, you get a much longer fatigue stun for swinging.
---
If you are stunned and still tracking a Survivor, try turning a little so you can see them or their scratch marks from the top left/top right of the screen.
---
Don't forget you can shorten your blink by aiming it downwards (just also don't forget this can cause you to blink to a lower level, if there is one like in Killer shack).
---
Most importantly, learn to predict where a Survivor will be when they see you charging. Most of the time they will try to break line of sight, and you need to figure out where they are without seeing them. Some Survivors just keep running in a straight line, expecting you to try looping them. Others double back to fake you out. Others will run straight towards you to get you to whiff with a long stun. It's hard to get a read on a good Survivor, but that's what makes her feel so good to get a down with.
---
you say one thing that sensitive killer mains don't like and you get mass downvoted. usually how it goes
---
Fuck yeah boi
---
Why do people not get what peoples issues are with NOED, people dont think its OP they think its bullshit and rewards bad players, there are a multittude of perks stronger than NOED but they feel fair.
---
I apply a ton of map pressure with huntress. 
---
Chucking hatchets at gens.
---
Sometimes even they get spooked and fail a skill check.
---
When killers using lag-switch for too much, the game forced them to DC
---
There’s a simple solution.
---
Enforced proximity chat.
---
Sweet
---
Thank you so much for clearing it up for me
---
I miss playing solo so much. Even playing in 2man swf isn’t as fun as 3 &amp; 4 man swf. I can’t rely on randoms at all, they make the worst possible decisions and you can’t counter extremely toxic killers all that well alone. Playing killer is more fun than solo survivor for me too now tho which is a fun change
---
No. Deja Vu is the most unbalanced perk so far. I couldn’t even camp 3 gens that close together and when those plebs run it, they’ll have ez win!
---
I want that too, but discord users would get around it. 
---
My suggestion would be ranked mode that would not be swf but solos and then yeah implement proximity chat. I'd like to see tournaments with this game happen.
---
That shit traumatic man I stik fear lego to this day, ever since my father got one stuck in his nostril and I nearly choked on one I stear clear man
---
#justiceforlegovictims
---
So this is what I've got to look forward to when I come and play this game on PC in August? Lovely.
---
I don't want to show off or say that I'm good, it's just funny that people actually bother to do this once they lost a game.
---
I would have just replied with “gross.”
---
Is there not a way to force proximity through third party chat? On Friday the 13th me and a bud were using party chat and it still enforced proxy.
---
Besides, I bet there’s some kind of agreement the devs could make with Discord to somehow prevent people from using it during gameplay. I’ve heard of it happening before.
---
(*Just don’t ask because it’s a vague memory tbh, I could be very wrong here.*)
---
Being stealthy, help others. These two don't go together. How you being in a locker instead of going to open the gates help the others? It helps YOU, not others. If you want to be selfish, it's fine, but don't pretend to be something else.
---
Speaking of which did they announce an official date yet for that?
---
someone doesn't quite understand what a Mary Sue is. what you are describing is a Jane doe
---
Id be fine with perma noed but you get a rancor like warning its coming and therefore, it incentivities you to cleanse totems, right now its pot luck if they have noed.
---
Dude link one post like that on this subreddit.
---
By all means, indulge me, what's the difference? Just saying there's a difference and not elaborating in the slightest isn't good enough.  
---
And before you pull the "the poses themselves are/look different" card, they are both reference poses. They both serve the same purpose. The stance itself doesn't matter.  
---
A rose by any other name.

---
I honestly don't know. Devs are a bit focused on the server issue right now. I could see it as a possibility.
---
tbh i don't mind flashlights being where they are, all i want changes to is pallets. they aren't safe at all anymore which just feels stupid, they might as well not be there if you get hit through it every single time,regardless of how early you drop it.
---
they don't need crazy vacuum again, just a hit denial or something if they've already dropped the pallet when hit.
---
kind of something you'd think would be obvious tbh.
---
hitboxes in general are atrocious too.
---
exhaustion perks also didn't need the nerfs, killer mains only asked for a nerf to sprint burst. the others were pretty alright.
---
But he didn’t survive.
---
I doubt that'd happen because he is a psychopath that murdered his wife and daughter.
---
They do not get out of dream without wasting time.
---
While Yes at the start you won’t do much but when 1-2 gens are done his power helps him stall so much that they so not get anything done.
---
Camping sucks, but that’s none of my business
---
Yeah but in his story it seemed he like he was manipulated by the entity
---
Im not here to argue you filthy peasant, im saying the art style is overused and ugly as fuck for a simple drawing
---
It is bullshit that you can last all match and not get hooked then you get hit with noed. I totally agree. At the same time not all killers are created equal and gens will go fast. The best thing you can do is have them pop 4 gens and have the last 3 close to each other. A killer can consistantly be messing up a team and one survivor can do detrimental amounts of work on the gens while the others are distracting him by getting chased and hooked. You can do everything right as killer and still lose. I been playing survivor more than I have killer as of late. I switched mains and it can be hard for killers. I've been in numerous matches where the killer hooks everyone a couple of times then gets no kills. You almost need to take out one member early and hope for bad teamwork.
---
You find two survivors on a gen, you dream both. They run in different directions, and you commit to one. If they're any good at all, by the time you've got a hit off the other one will have found another survivor or failed a skill check. There's just no way for Freddy to get multiple people at once
---
I once faced a trapper that put down traps after pallets that were pulled down instead of breaking them. 3 people, including myself, just slider over the pallet into the trap mid chase. A genius
---
I mean if you play against a perfect 4 man you will struggle its true but even then you should be able to get two of them at least. The game isnt balanced around a 4k and tbh it shouldnt be balanced around a super billy or super depip squad either.
---
That would be interesting, like a 100% obsession perk with Rin as a killer. But he doesn't deserve the chance to survive.
---
*cries in mori*
---
Myers is one of the more balanced killers hes absoltuley fine, the 99% stalking experience can be annoying but oh well if you stop him stalking in a chase hes dead.
---
I reread it and it seems like it's eithher theentity or some kind of mental illness triggered by the stress of losing his job while in debt. Either way it would more suit him asa killer because if he was manipulated by the entity, that was most likely why.
---
noed is fine if you don't have ruin, but a noob is a new player and only newer players won't have ruin, so by logic it's for noobs, if you can't get kills with ruin, you should practice your killer.
---
I was thinking stalk from a distance like the movies
---
I guess Spirits will tunnel him to satisfy her lore lolol
---
Movies/Lore whatever should have no influence on game balance
---
I learned a lot from these comments and I wanna move huntress,jeff and legion(susie) to the SMASH side. :\*
---
I usually slug if I see an opperatunity to down more than one person at a time, because when I pick one of them up I know that they will try to heal the other person. Also I slug when there are 2 people left and I want a 4k, so I don't want the hatch to open.
---
You're talking about the same inbred autists who have a book of made up rules they demand killers follow. Their opinions are invalid.
---
I want to derank as a survivor :( no one goofs off at high ranks D:
---
as in, when they get their actual mettle of man effect, not before
---
It's when you down a survivor and don't pick them up immediatly. You can use this to prevent the hatch from opening, or down more than one person at a time.
---
Sometimes I sacrifice myself for the other teammate to get the hatch but then they die almost immediately or don't find the hatch and then die ;_; so now I don't sacrifice myself anymore
---
\*killer exists\*  
---
Survivor mains:  
---
Is this camping?
---
For me if I'm playing survivor and a lot of matches are going good for me I avoid killer for the night. If I keep getting teamed up with bad survivors I'll switch to killer. I think the balance isnt anywhere. People make their own balance by playing good. If a good survivor team goes against a equally good killer the killer will lose.
---
As Freddy you should get a first hit so in that scenario one is wounded, you chase after the wounded one waste some pallets and when the other one wakes up you come for them get a first hit and go back to stop the other from compleatly healing and if he woke up using sc it is an easy first down
---
That is wat better than chasing after one and eating all the pallets while the other survivors are free to do gens
---
I have so many of the event offerings from blood moon that I never used.
---
Assuming they use a gen to wake up, that’s about 5 seconds wasted of gen progression with the regression. That’s not worth the 7 second delay before hitting someone
---
I’m frightened by the high number of South Americans with VAC bans.

Don’t get me wrong, I believe ruin should be changed but not because it’s super strong. As you said, it’s pretty boring on both the killer and survivor side. As a killer you can’t see ruin working most of the time and as survivor, it becomes boring when almost all killers use it. It especially irritates me when I get a nurse or billy who use use ruin. They’re basically admitting they are compensating for something.

lmao
---
&gt;  if they waste time cleansing dull totems when they should be repairing, they don't make it to endgame in the first place.
---
that's the point genius, to slow the game down so the killer has a chance so 3 or 4  gens don't fucking pop in the first 2 mins. If you're not going to spend time looking for or cleansing totems, don't fucking whine about NOED. 
---
NOED is a trash perk but it's funny you'll cry about wasting time cleansing dull totems in case of but if RUIN is on the map you'll spend 10 mins looking for that instead of learning to land your skill checks.
---
True but getting moried in normal games where party streamers are on is annoying anyway, and having the double bloodpoint event on is just extra salt in the wound if that happens
---
It also makes Kate bald
---
Probably the best reason for him being a survivor would be so Rin could get her revenge over and over again
---
I play killer, and I seriously cannot get one match where people just accept that you are a killer and can't let the survivors escape. I usually respect kobes, just because it's ebicc, but if I don't play well, could you all just stfu for a moment? Sometimes you have bad games, sometimes you have good games, but that doesn't mean you have to be an asshole.

Killer dc's in the beginning so we deserve to lose offering and depip
---
I’ve had many games in with I did a bunch of shit and missed a pip by one
---
Im not seeing what difference this makes to what I said, youve said your an inexperienced killer who struggles to apply pressure, you are not going to do well against good survivors. Bad killers need NOED ive said that, thats why its annoying to deal with
---
Yeah, this is the reason I hate playing billy. They advertise him as being easy to play yet I think Nurse is infinitely easier to play than billy. I just cant control the chainsaw.
---
If I'm down, others have to go and save me, risking their lives. If I open the door when the killer is not around the likelihood there'll be giant mess is lessened.
---
If I wanted to be selfish, I wouldn't run around saving my team. I'll permanently crouch.
---
Also have balls and post from your real account and not your alt.
---
More like "Suvivor Sided" and "EVEN MORE SUVIVOR SIDED" !
---
Probably, I notice they treat you differently depending on who you play as.
---
If I play as Kate I get tunnelled always. If Nea and I use the sideburns hair, I am not tunnelled much. But if I equip the green hair it becomes way more common.
---
Possibly because you are running into a broken totem. Makes for a stupid/funny thing to happen while playing billy/bubba. Go into kyf and see for yourself
---
Excellent

Micheal is the most balanced killer in game and his add-ons are also very balanced and fun to play. With the combination of the two pink add-ons he has to fully stalk 3 and half survivors, making it really hard. If you can't avoid him, it's your fault.
---
Almost

" I don’t know what games you’ve played, but clearly you have never played an actual pay-to-win game judging from your loose definition of what constitutes as one, and your overreactive criticism of this game as being one. "
---
You haven't been playing games for longer than 4-5 years to not have known that that's actually that the definition was until everyone got so lax about it. Giving out even the smallest of advantages for a price wasn't common practice long ago mate, don't settle.
---
" But for fuck’s sake, you’re a troll acting like you want to have a discussion and be persuaded. In this thread you have managed to (a) offer up a solution, (b) forgot that it was your solution when it was criticized, and (c) realized your solution was actually a bad idea. "
---
No, I settled that a part of the solution was bad and gave you that, I'm open to what you have to say. Meanwhile you're adverse to settle on anything I say and have just been attacking my character several times, you just want to disregard anything I say and are the worst kind of scum.
---
Look in a mirror.
---
Haven't tunneled once as Freddy over the course of the BP weekend (leveled him up and got a ton of Streamers and Puddings, so stayed with him for it), consistently got 3k/4k if I didn't let the survivors go.
---
- Green Dress (Yellow Add-on) makes skillchecks a lot harder to come by. It is by far his best add-on.
---
- If you find two survivors on a gen, sleep both of them, follow one, get the hit, and then start running towards the other. If he hits the skillcheck, sleep him again. If he finds another survivor, sleep both of them. Boom, 3 people in Dreamland rather than 2.
---
- Monitor and Abuse is Freddy's best perk since it makes tracking and ambushing people that much easier.
---
- You can't protect your hooks, but what you can do is immediately sleep both people again, so they can't wake eachother up and you get to track them down again.
---
- If you run up to someone on the generator, sleep them, and then hit the generator, *then* start the chase. If they blow up their generator, sleep them again and *then* kick the generator. I was consistently skunking survivors because they kept blowing up their generators after they ran out of medkit.
---
Does Freddy need help? Absolutely; not being able to punish hook saves or pull someone off the Hatch is stupid, as is how hard it is to see people in the dream world some times. But he's not a garbage tier killer who can't do anything.....
---
Now this is a cosmetic I’d pay for!

I think i had *heard* of Halloween but all i knew was that it was a horror, and I'm not a fan of horrors so i never looked into it.
---
Depends on your definiton of bad, but he is bad by any definition.
---
I mean being the worst killer in the game is definitely a good reason to call him bad.
---
one is annoying
---
one is really meta
---
one is broken
---
what is your point here?

While blood webs are far smaller than in the old days, there are so many required per character now that I feel like the current grind has possibly exceeded the old one.  I wasn't around for the original, though, so grain of salt and all.

Come the fuck down jesus ! I judge the game by its balance and being suvivor is the most braindead stupids thing ever ! This subreddit is the same way toxic as the game itself ! GUESS WHAT ! SUVIVORS ARE THE MAJORITY !
---
I was reported because the game got bugged or smth and that one Kate couldn't mend. She said that I cheat and got me reported. The fun thing is that I don't even know if it's possible to cheat on console...
---
I used to when I was a nice killer, a killer trying to be 'fair' to survivors. One more swf wave of insults was too much and I got tired of it to the point where I snapped. Sorrow was replaced to Hatred and I've been enjoying the salt ever since
---
The last salt comment I got was so stupid though. 'Thrash killer doesn't work'
---
But I got three kills of the four xD The survivors have no logic

---
The entire song changes multiple times and is pretty long. You can find it on YouTube. She Changes tone, laughs, and hums or Lalas depending on how long she’s not in a chase.
---
the update is coming out today, right? do we know when exactly or nah?
---
I enjoy the characters that allow me to have entertaining matches. Unfortunately you stop having fun at high ranks unless you play like a tryhard.
---
Most likely in 7/8 hours from now, but not certain.
---
.... I think I'm going to start having conversations with my computer rather than on my computer. It seems like it'd be far more worthwhile.
---
Not if they’re competent and have a pallet or window
---
Thank you so much for answering!
---
Remember when Survivors told us that "2 kill is supposed to be a good game, you should be satisfied with that"?
---
I remember when I could pip from 2 kills, these days when the survivors are rushing the gens I can get 3 and 4 kill games and never pip up. 
---
Good job devs, pretty good job so far.
---
Ok, we get it, devil.
---
Then fucking quit, wtf is wrong with you you unstable competly mental bofun !
---
Entirely depends on your killer, who are you thinking of trying the build with?
---
I once had this as well. All day only hate messages, I kinda like it when people go out of there way to show how salty they are. And then out of nowhere someone sent me a super wholesome message telling me I was a good killer and such. 
---
FYI: I usually give survivors hatch, I don't camp, if I see a survivor getting farmed I go after the guy that farmed instead of the injured guy, I do not use NOED (except on killers I'm uncomfortable with or don't have ruin on), I only 'tunnel' flashlight clickers and still I get so many salty messages. Yesterday a Spanish dude spammed me messages the remainder of the game after I killed him quite early just to give me those notifications. His friend told me to delete the game after. 
---
The DBD experience ladies and gentlemen
---
It's just a photo without a caption but you even have the imgflip.com.  Why?
---
Spine Chill doesn't work against Tier 1 Myers. Neither does Kindred.
---
So I use or don't rancor?
---
Playing Doctor.
---
If you’re using Save The Best for Last, I would say yes
---
well I'm pretty sure his point is "i play what i want, i don't care if they are annoying/meta/broken, I play what I want because it's what I want"
---
Nurse: Pray your mind game's stronger than hers ;)
---
How weird. I've pretty much only stuck to base perks on Quentin, never had any obsession perks in the past on really any of my characters.
---
Excuse me, have you seen the man? With those sultry, granny-esque looks, I don't think any killer could NOT be obsessed with him.
---
In all seriousness, though, as a part-time Quentin main I haven't experienced this. I think it's just bad luck.
---
Luckily you get some awesome rewards for hitting rank one! :D
---
... right?
---
There are rewards for ranking up in this game right?
---
Ranks have a meaning in this game right?
---
No he's in a good place, like Pig WAS, they fucked her over. I don't want the same fate for Myers
---
Surprised nobody else wants to live with Huntress but that’s fine. Me make good husband
---
So red is a toxic af streamer?
---
No let us please wait for 2 more weeks before you decide.
---
This is perfect
---
Becauze survivors would abuse it, dc when downed to keep their purple flashlight etc
---
If a survivor disconnects they should lose their stuff but if a killer disconnects then survivors shouldn’t lose anything at all
---
Tell me what's wrong about slugging now
---
So you always slug for a 4k or was there something special about these 8 games in a row that you must have a 4k so badly?
---
Does he play on the PC? Cause if he is, he should know, I tunnel Dwights.
---
I'd tell him to play without perks for a day and think about what would compliment his playstyle, what he needs, the he should read all perks of every character and see what suits him best
---
There are plenty of ways to reduce the grind.
---
You could;
---
* Reduce perk levels to only have 1 level per perk, basically any and all perks are maxed out from the get-go. This one won't help you level up faster but it'd let you get that build you wanted faster.
---
* Rework the Bloodpoint offerings to be useful. I actually made a thread about this on the DbD forums. [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/46827/a-rework-of-bloodpoint-offerings](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/46827/a-rework-of-bloodpoint-offerings)
---
* Increase score events and increase the maximum amount of Bloodpoints that can be earned in a trial.
---
* Let us sell add-ons or offerings for bloodpoints.
---
This game needs help.
---
Can you actually make the novel now?
---
Yes lets just immediately assume he camped and played like a dick because of a stupid meme he made.
---
JFC you guys are exatcly whats wrong with this community. Uninstall pls k thx
---
Look who angered the projecting baby
---
Worst: I was going to say 'Piggy nerf, never have I actually become frustrated with something the Devs fucked over until I read those notes.' the to me the absolute WORST is the lack of punishment for Ragequit Survivors.
---
Best: Cosmetics, I love em
---
I always thought it was the beanie, the beanie's pretty cute. 
---
But yeah, I get bullied a ton when playing him for some reason anyway, I think the game just decided I wanted a bullying simulator and went with that.
---
My guess is you are a god damn virgin who nobody ever loved so you gotta take your anger issues out on killer players on the Internet.
---
Garbage human being.
---
The update wont counter all scenarios. If the endgame collapse isn't triggered, the survivors can still kill themselves / DC to let their buddy escape. 
---
Yesterday, as killer, I had 2 survivors left to kill/sacrifice and 1 gen left to complete with 3 gens all in very close proximity of each other. The hatch had already spawned near a gen. The survivors were at a disadvantage here, so one ran to the other side of the map and kept darting in and out of a locker to get my attention. As soon as I approached them, they DC'd so that their SWF buddy immediately got the hatch.
---
I have about 300hrs and only 8 level 50s [maybe 3 with the perks I like] and 1 level 50 killer. Having all dlc characters with more to come is just daunting.
---
  I think a pricing reduction all around on offerings as well as say a 50% fulltime BP boost would have am amazing effect. I only suggest theae as they seem like the easiest course of action.
---
The system encourages artificially prolonging the game to make it feel like the game is meant to be that long, when really it has to be that way for you to pip. BR would rather do that than come in with an actual solution to the problems.
---
We are an infrequent but hardy breed. One by one, we enlighten our peers of the true strength of our sweater Boi, that they refuse to acknowledge.
---
While Gen-Rushing isn't a thing, we do have to admit that gens get done a little too fast. This is not the fault of the Survivors, but it's not really something anyone can deny when a vast majority of killers use Ruin.
---
They really need to put gens to 100 seconds, buff Technician to give 10%/20%/30% repair speed (90s, 80s, 70s), and then go from there. That gives Killers more time to do what they can, doesn't force the game to drag out too much longer, and gives the Survivors the option to actually have a perk build for Gen Jockeying.
---
The thing is, there no absolute merits to measure balance apart from statistics. Thia statistics tells us that many people think that Freddy is the worst killer, so he is bad for them. But somebody might be playing like an absolute beast with Freddy at high ranks - for that person, Freddy might be a good killer.
---
So he isn't bad by *any* definition really
---
You don't get that many BP, which sucks yeah. It's a double edged sword for me. When I have someone ragequit, I smile, feeling victorious. But it is quickly taken over by sadness for who ever is left in the trial with so many generators to do still. We need harsh punishment for these guys
---
Survivor&gt;dies&gt;Tell the KILLER why it's THEIR fault they DIED
---
This line keeps playing in my head whenever it happens, it's ridiculous. Like where are your braincells, survivor. You made a mistake, us killers take full advantage. That's all there is to it.
---
this
---
You should google what a fucking paragraph is you moron
---
first second of his sprint has much bigger turn-rate so you can do a 180 around a loop
---
you'll get used to it
---
Did you actually read through all of that? No punctuation/paragraphs at all, just one giant mess of word vomit written by a raging 3iq human being
---
This will sound crazy,  but I find it easier to control Billy with a controller versus keyboard and mouse.
---
For me winning as Survivor is surviving, I suppose
---
As killer it's doing what I want to do. If it takes the whole game to get that one of a kind skilled survivor, and kill that guy, but the rest escapes? I'm still going to feel victorious.
---
why do you p3 multiple survivors tho? I'd at least start with the killers, it's not like you're going to play with all those survivors anyway
---
I thought that was a new Hag skin for a moment,  lmao. I kind of want to see Myers with a mullet now. 😆
---
That’s just a dick move. Purposely ruining someone’s experience and then being so entitled to not accept any messages
---
You disagree so you gotta be the kind of player I am complaining about REEE. Nice overassuming you little bitch.
---
Now lets just do some over assuming ourselfes and think about the pathetic piece of human garbage you need to be in order to treat people like that.
---
 You sound like a god damn middle child who didn't get enough love from mommy. Cannot even play killer the nice way without going full virtue signaling and patting himself on the back on reddit every 5 minutes.
---
You wouldn't do that shit if you lived a healthy life in which people actually treat you with love and respect. Pathetc human being, I really hope you find it in yourself to become less garbage like
---
I'm really glad that was your experience. I'd prefer everyone have a great experience with this game.
---
I'm not a Myers main but I've played him often since his release and kept him all-perked. What rank are you on killer? Ruin is almost required in the upper, more experienced ranks where survivors move their camera around but can often be an unnecessary perk in the green/yellow ranks where survivors don't pay as much attention. 
---
What add-ons are you wanting to utilize? Rancor can be detrimental to you as a low terror radius Dead Rabbit Myers for example or if you swap in Monitor &amp; Abuse. STBFL is a decent perk for Myers with or without the Rancor combo benefits though. If you're say rank 10-15, consider dropping Ruin to combo Rancor &amp; STBFL in your build.
---
ANC and BBQ are both great perks for Myers. Sounds like a good build overall. You could even drop ANC if you wanted to keep Ruin/BBQ and use the Rancor/STBFL mori combo as well.
---
A couple other considerations would be Enduring and Spirit Fury to help make chases more efficient since you're still an M1 killer at heart. Enduring alone is fine, but SF without Enduring is a waste. Bamboozle can also be a fun cheeky perk from time to time since you already have increased vault speed, especially with a Lery's offering and a Scratched Mirror add-on.
---
What advantage?
---
I got reported for someone else getting kicked out of the game.
---
Let's call those SWF guys A and B
---
B disconnected a minute into the game
---
after the match A informed me that they were talking via discord and B "was sure killer disconnected" because that's how it looked like to him, so I'm reported for kicking his IP or some shit like that
---
Not if you know how use to use the blinking in and out of reality to your advantage.
---
Im pretty new but find this all kinda stupid, the aim of the game for the survivors is to escape? and the killer is to kill people? in that case it makes sense to get gens done quickly as possible and for the killer to focus someone thats injured to get them out of the game.
---
I don't speak caveman, what are you on about?
---
He may not be loved by all , but he's the best goddamn grammar police there is. Show some respect!
---
Answer the question please. Yes or no. Would you correct someone on either a grammar error or a spelling error even if you knew what they were talking about.
---
Play the Kaiserreich mod on HOI4
---
Sore losers or just ragers. 
---
Not taking defeat well. If you down him within half a minute or something, completely outplaying them, downing them like 1,2,3. They'll feel so disgusted they'll just DC like 'fuck this shit. I can't do anything'.
---
Some survivors DC just after looking at you because they don't want to go against the killer I picked.
---
Or a friend of mine for example. He sent me a clip of him trying to escape using balanced landing, but it didn't activate. He actually clipped it because he was so traumatized by how that even is possible. He sent it to me, and I was like 'yeah you didn't drop from high enough ground' and he was like 'oh' xD He sometimes does these reactions too during a chase and the lunge nails him. It's funny but also a bit annoying, stop being shocked and stop raging, you were in range, killer took advantage. That's all
---
I don’t get it
---
I have, it's confusing.
---
Ok thanks friend
---
I did answer you ffs. I would correct someone using the wrong "your" but if its a simple spelling mistake no. Just like i stated in my previous comment.
---
My measurement is myself, I am the "beast with Freddy" you are describing. As a rank 1 killer and survivor since the game was released I can instantly tell the difference between a good and a bad killer and its more noticable as I am actually a Freddy main.
---
Stop trying to twist words until you think they make sense, he is bad at chasing and has no particular upsides besides invisibility, he is bad. You might have an argument when you are taking into consideration different ranks but he is, compared to any other killer in the game, bad. He is not as horrible as people on reddit make him out to be but he is bad.
---
Same here
---

---
Ahh the benefits of PS4 no chat for that p3 claudette group to be dicks to me when all they did was hide in the grass the whole game, but one of them made it out.
---
If Michael and Freddy were like the movies, they'd kill every survivor in this game within five minutes.
---
Yesterday I spawned right next to a hex totem, able to see it while the screen was rotating to begin the trial. Other survivors were there too.
---
I honestly don't get why more people don't do this :( it would stop a lot of complaining/saltiness, too, I think
---
The idea was to combine it with another add-on where you had a longer lunge timer (not relevant since you couldn't lunge) in exchange for time after uncrouching where your TR remained 0, allowing you to pull people off stuff much easier.
---
If that is still bad, you could easily add a few more things to the add-on to make the trade-off worth it. That's not the issue really.
---
I mean, if that's still a bad idea, that's fine. But I'd rather have someone actually give me a proper counter point (like what you did) than "lol ur idiot dis bad".
---
Would you be interested in the idea of trading Ambush power in some form for better traps and vice versa, along with leaving the "Standard Pig" build where you could use both? The goal is more to make Pig more like Michael Myers where you have multiple build paths than straight buffing.
---
What if you lost Ambush for the ability to see the aura of survivors around boxes? With RBTs on their head, of course.
---
Farming is bannable
---
Nope. There was a Lord of the Rings game that enforced proximity chat (Actually made echo voices when you were in dome like rooms and caves kinda neat) But it was annoying because the codec sucked (Quality) and was forced activation rather than push to talk.  
---
The work around is literally plugging anything with a 3.5mm jack (You're not using this one it can literally be a cord that leads to nowhere) into another slot on your PC and switching the games mic to that empty cord.
---

---
Some of you are allright. Don't come to the campfire tomorrow!
---
If I don't get chased, you can't just think I'm sitting there with my thumb up my ass, I'm doing gens (and hopefully everyone else is when I'm getting chased.)
---
LEJUN
---
Don’t use my boy for your pro NOED propaganda
---
Luck of Ace! Helps me find the hatch too often.
---
rank 1 sounds better
---
It lets you track them if they spill it.
---
But I find winning fun :(
---
I approve
---
EnTiTy DiSpLeAsEd
---
if the lobby starts taking to long i just go play another game and leave my friend hanging lol.
---
Have you tried PLAYING Michael?
---
If you had to Stop and stand still and be far away to stalk, you'd NEVER level up your Evil Within.
---
Survivors can break line of sight and cancel your stalk EASILY if that happened.
---
You'd have no way to win chases and would waste SO much time trying to stalk and get gen rushed.
---
Michael is the most well balanced Killer in the game. He doesn't need any changes. You just need to learn how to deal with him.
---
I have limited time to play so if I want to play a new killer, I don't have it leveled up yet. I had one damn perk on huntress and all the survivors (green rank) spammed EZ in chat. 
---
I said: "look at my perks, I sure hope it would have been easy"
---
I remember when he was top tier at launch.
---
Heeey, thats pretty good! :)
---
Killer loses their add-ons and offerings when survivors DC too
---
to be fair if the killer is face camping, the survivor can just go AFK through Phase 1 to buy time, and waste killer’s time throughout phase 2.
---
Keep in mind, it takes 2 minutes to die on a hook and 80 seconds to complete a gen alone with no tools.  If the other 3 all work on gens together with Prove Thyself, toolboxes, or even no tools, you can get at least 3 gens done, maybe 4.  If your team wasn’t garbage and you didn’t get caught before the first gen pop, the killer gets 1 kill for the price of 3.  If you’re like me, more hopeful 3 of your teammates will survive, rather than you alone survive, that is a very fair trade off.  Now if your team is trying to unhook against a face camping leatherface, that’s their own fault
---
But you could go, you know, to the two others on the other side of the map, and stop them from getting gens done. It prolongs the game, making it easier to get everyone. If you just tunnel, everyone will ignore the person on the hook and do gens.
---
Photo?
---
My friend was like this. He deranked only to grief killers at rank 15 and be toxic to them. I stopped playing with him..
---
How does Freddy promote tunneling
---
You even said it yourself, it's a meme dude. Just in case you didn't know mate, I can upvote and laugh at this meme without playing like a dickhead next game.
---
It's what people call "having fun". Jeez, how fucking deep into the whole "killer vs survivor" mentality are you that you can't even laugh at a stupid Internet joke anymore?
---
Enjoy killing your own enjoyment for the game like that
---
There were two bps in one match I had against a slug nurse.... On the game.
---
I'd love to use these too! they're wonderful :)
---
Not leaving a hooked survivor as LF because all 3 other survivors were swarming it. They "video reported" me. I ended up slugging them and getting a 4k.
---
Yeah, huntress is pretty hard without perks. I once won without perks and they were all saying how huntress is op and shit. And when they win against me as a no perk huntress they say EZ. Double standards much?
---
Rank means nothing, survivors pipping in red ranks is more or less luck and a killer has to have adrawn out map where they do well. 
---
All rank gives you is long wait times and more often than not sweaty opponents
---
Lol at that last line. You've never seen much of the nightmare series, right? He spent like 3/4 of it as a clown.
---
You lucky boy.
---
I have his three base perks and Diversion. Often end up being hit with Dying Light, Rancor and Remember Me when it's the killers. I guess it's just rotten luck. :(
---
A Perks a Perk.
---
there are like 10 pallets left in each map and most of them are still mindgameable,  but i still see some people wanting to nerf them more lol
---
In the official discord server there are some people that think that flashlights are op and when you ask them if they look at walls or try to find nearby survivors they just avoid the question
---
No one knows it’s only a guess but it’s usually Tuesday’s or Thursday’s
---
I just call them "Kill Rusher"s.
---
So, now it's official. BHVR are sponsored by Firaxis Games.
---
“Freddy isnt bad you don’t know how to play him” = 10 downvotes
---
“I think MoM op” = 273 votes
---
Body blocked a killer. Also my friend got told he got reported by the killer cause the killer could never catch him lol
---
I’m here for the memes tbh
---
just assume everyone has noed on, makes it less of a surprise when you get domed out of nowhere and sacrificed after having not seen the killer once all game
---
Why do people not know that Bubbas rampage still one shots
---
Oh hey look a killer main that thinks that all survivors are entitled survivor mains
---
That's not what i'm talking about. Playing to win and simply being a dick (which is open to interpretation) are 2 different things.
---
I'm talking about stuff like facecamping people or slugging with no intentions to hook survivors.
---
lol
---
I still don't see why everyone thinks a killer is bad because they have NOED. I don't think a survivor is necessarily bad because they are built like a tank and have a god-tier health pack or tool box.
---
That would be the rough equivalent.
---
Doesn't apply to survivors since they all play the same. Although getting real sick of 4 man adrenaline, dead hard, DS and MOM.
---
Cute
---
Fair enough 😄
---
At least you slowed the game down just a little bit.
---
The technician thing affects speed not time, so it would be 91/83/76 seconds
---
I'm surprised that it has happened tbh. 
---
My brightness settings are not at maximum, It's not on Vivid mode, and it has the Screen Shift feature activated. Despite the long lobby wait times, the screen isn't static for hours like watching TV channels with permanent logos on screen.
---
A survivor (rightfully) used to get shit for runing DS, its exactly the same idea. A killer with NOED is so uncofident they need instadowns at endgame to get a pity kill
---
Seriously the dumbest thing in the world on this sub is the idea that any side is more toxic than the other. Can't wait to load up my next totally untoxic NOED, Ruin, Ebony Mori (50 stacked on every killer) Billies. Or the totally untoxic killers that hold survivors in basements. Totally untoxic Doctors that can just hold games hostage just by being there bonus points when they burn puzzle piece offerings.  
---
I guess the killers didn't always used to be this toxic.... Back then we just had trappers who would farm the last survivor by setting up 2 traps next to each other, stepping in 1 with the survivor on your back in a way that would drop them into the second trap, and pick them back out of it.  
---
Dumbest comment I've ever seen here. And this is /r/deadbydaylight that's an accomplishment.
---
Here's the [Hag and Plague](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/goz2goC)
---
A good boye
---
50% of my survivor choices are based on thiccness, rather than perks.
---
he clearly doesnt know what hes talking about. And there are so many instances where spine chill saved my life, i honeslty can't play without it now.
---
Honestly just OLED TVs are not that great honestly. Amazing Picture but so damn easy to get burns. Hopefully one day it can last like LCD
---
You mean like when you down a survivor rightfully so then a teammate instaheals them and the rest body block for a "pity escape"?
---
Don’t get too excited so you don’t get disappointed
---
I've been excited for like a year and I'm too naive to not be
---
See my reply to the same comment someone else made.
---
Instaheads are like oneshot hatchets, omega blink etc. They are dumb and unbalanced offerings/addons.
---
Oh trust me. You really don't xD. I get enough hate messages from survivors, and killers asking me if they were too toxic. This is around rank 8 btw.
---
I’ve heard some high rank killers say they think Spirit is high up there on the tier list, but whether she is or not she’s still best girl :D The mind games and predictions are sooo satisfying with her :)
---
That actually sounds beautifully disgusting
---
Then something close to it. 
---
Uh yea. If I see a full team of toolboxes on P3 characters or the like I already know how it's gonna go. 
---
Killer see the survivors remember? We can get a rough sense of it. 
---
Unless survivors suddenly start clicking through characters at the last 10 sec til they reach the loaded out character they set up prior. In which case why bother playing. They mind gamed before the match started.
---
For Hag? Best combo hands down is M&amp;A and Nurses calling. With M&amp;A (not in chase) having a 16m terror radius and Nurses Calling at rank 3 being 28m.  Once you hit a survivor and they begin healing within that radius you know they are there for 2 seconds before they know you are there.
---
Ruin is always good for slowing the game down.
---
For the Hag however BBQ and Chilli isn’t great if you are using it for Aura reading. The Hag is just too slow and can’t move from one place to another fast enough (unless survivors always run over traps once you hook someone consistently within teleport range: aka not gonna happen OR running mint rag.)
---
Looping? The Hag can force early pallet drops and survivors to vault into you arms by placing a trap on one side of the pallet and forcing them into it. This forces them to drop the pallet and guess where you are. If you stay still more often than not they will vault into you. For this I recommend running the trap duration addons.
---
For map control always use a distance addon.
---
Hope this helps!
---
&gt; here and there
---
It's not here and there. It's either there or it's not. You can't just say "I don't wanna go against the strong stuff all the time" based on your own personal convenience.
---
&gt;  there are 3vs1. There are people DCing. There are infinite loading screens
---
And these are problems with the game having issues and players being crybabies. 
---
&gt; "tryharding" killers
---
I'm sorry, but when did putting out effort become something to shame? Last I knew, people threw out the tryharding line primarily as a defense mechanism after they got beat to absolve themselves of their failure. You may want just a casual game of running around and goofing, you're entitled to that desire, but you can't switch back and start badmouthing someone who doesn't share your desire.
---
&gt; campers/tunnelers
---
I wonder when these labels will ever go away. Not for the fact that camper is a very ambiguous term, it shouldn't even be a shame tactic. Camping, in my opinion, *should* be defined as face camping; literally sitting on top of them as they die. Even with that definition, it's still a legitimate way to secure your kill, despite community outcry against it. Defending your hook through whatever option you end up choosing is yours to make, and moralizing about it is just lame. Sure, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but you don't get to control things after you're placed on the hook.
---
&gt; I just want this tryharding mentality to be over soon
---
Why? What's wrong with trying? What's wrong with doing your best? Those of us that have been around since launch probably aren't in our "tryhard" phases anymore because hitting rank 1 is boring, and we've switched gears to a run-around-chaos-fest style of game. We're entitled to change our priorities; however, we're *not* entitled to make someone else play in conformance with our wants.
---
*no homo*
---
Holy cow I need to try that one thx mate
---
bring a map with the black lock add on

Ok, this was hard to read. I just didn't understand it. But I'm saying that if you get a good fair round and the survivors are mad, are the same type of survivors to say EZ when they win. So even if you win you are still an asshole, and that's annoying. If you do the whole "3man NOED facecamp slug" thing, then you are an asshole. If you just play well and win, and they get mad, they are the assholes.
---
You could also:
---
* Increase BP given for Dailies.
---
* Increase the total number of Dailies you can store and refresh per day.
---
* Increase BP given for already owned Shrine perk purchases.
---
* Incorporate BP rewards into the Devotion system along with the awarded Shards.
---
There's so many things they could do to make the grind less grueling there's no excuse not to do something. I have all teachables for killers and survivors, things are getting out of hand - survivors have the entire first row of the 5th page of perks full now with killers right behind them with 4 full pages of perks.
---
“I showed you my knife pls respond.”
---
The truth has been spoken. Higher ranks are not even enjoyable anymore.
---
No, I mean when I play Ace the Hatch will frequently spawn close to wherever I was when the 3rd survivor was sacrificed.
---
Let me talk to the manager
---
Isnt it fun though to try and find more builds? I know that there will be probably this one or two builds that are fav, but finding more is fun in itself as you get new experience
---
Unbalanced against a coordinated team of survivors? I mean newbies yea, waaaaaaay ok and I'd consider that toxic play just because you're setting the expectation of new survivors that this is dark souls and they should be assholes every match.
---
The problem isn't even the with rate, it's the fact that it takes more than double the usual match length. You think people want to play against that when every game has a DC right at the beginning?
---
stereotypical claud and nea main here.  I don’t play claudette toxic, but to be someone noticeable to my teammates as a healer, I wear the colorful headscarf, salmon jacket, and pale jeans with her 3 teachables to heal others and myself, then Lithe.  Works pretty well for me.  I play Altruistic in that one, when I play Nea, it’s for a more aggresive or stealthy playstyle.
---
Where did you learn about 2.7.0 be released today?
---
r/TIHI
---
As a survivor main: good. They deserved it.
---
Well yeah they did their objectives and won the game and they don’t get rewarded but punished for it by a killer using noed, I would be salty too.
---
Not raging on chat though.
---
That's your opinion. When people are presented with the opportunity to get new builds but the trade-off is that they'd have to farm they might not want to do it. For some people, the trade-off for farming and getting what you want might not be positive. They'd rather just play and enjoy themselves, even if this was the most optimal time for them to achieve more.
---
Yeah, it always surprises me when it happens lol.
---
Darn, I like Claudette's invisibility
---
She's too tall to hit people crouching!
---
As a Killer Main: "Holy shit did I get that hatch grab? I... Didn't actually think they fell for it."
---
But I want to be homo. Bruh
---
Wait... new patch?
---
I'm fairly certain he's referring to the negative stigma that the survivors are somehow doing something wrong vs the literal meaning
---
Shhhhh🤫
---
i hope they will make another one after the fucking crash fix..me and my friends crashed so many times..it ruined the bloodhunt event for us :(
---
&gt; I bet you wonder why you have 2 DCs per game too bud
---
I don't ever really wonder why people DC, regardless of what killer I'm playing. Wraith has been my absolute favorite since launch, and I still play him the most. Regardless of what you're playing, the usual reason for someone dc'ing is because they're butthurt. Fine by me. I don't particularly care for someone else on the internet's feelings.
---
&gt; You aren't facing NPCs
---
Of course not, but how is that relevant? These are *other players* that I'm *supposed to kill*. Why are they suddenly treated like that moody girlfriend that you have to walk on eggshells around? Screw that. If you get mad because you get beat in a video game and throw temper tantrums, then you don't need to be playing that video game because you're a spoiled brat.
---
&gt; get literally no reward for ending games early
---
What reward do I get for extending the game? More blood points? A chance for different emblem scores? "Ensuring someone else has a good time"? I'll tell you the reward you get for ending a game, regardless of how long it took: a victory screen. The victory screen is there if you 4k before 6 minutes or after 15. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy the occasional chaotic game of running around being altruistic and getting saves, but I also have my games where I play optimally. That choice is mine to make, not yours, or anyone else's.
---
&gt; You are exactly what is wrong with this community
---
Fun catch phrase, but now defend it. What's "wrong" with this community, and how am *I* "exactly it"?
---
Jeff and Jane then?
---
I’m only curious to see how he’s going to be. I used to main Freddy, but now I’m more of a big boi (Myers) main
---
Yes more culture please
---
Honestly the Legion looks more creepy in cosplay than in game. Like if I saw you irl and didn't know this was a cosplay I would legit be worried.
---
Not taken as an insult, the reason is when I was prestiging him they were really the first perks to pop up so I thought to try them more as I hadn't outside of Pharmacy before. I solo a lot and I'm used to taking care of myself, I find Pharmacy is fine for me. I planned to go back to Empathy instead of Vigil but it hadn't reappeared in my Bloodweb yet so I've kind of left the perks as is. Was meant to be temporary!
---
I do like the pebble throw, though.
---
Im surprised your excited for the update considering amanda is getting beaten over the head with nerfs
---
WWWWWWWW DOUBLE U WWWWWWWW
---
They look like from Gravity Falls
---
"The skill check is harder, therefore, it's easier"
---
These prices are shocking and distressing! I spend my bloodpoints here all the time!
---
Tbh the original artist should have had Myers where Hag was.
---
And they were being cocky about it to boot! Bet that felt good for you. GG
---
This is why I want crossplay for consoles.
---
Lisa needs braces. That's why she's my favorite.
---
I was reported on ps4 because the killer liked me and the other survivor was a toxic pos. It was me and this other guy left. We were both looking for hatch. Billy finds me, I let him kill me, but he slugs me. Other survivor sends me a message saying "Haha, dumb b*tch. I'm getting hatch." So what do I do? I crawl in their direction and the Billy follows. They go into a locker (there were two there) and I start spinning in front of them. Billy chooses the wrong one and the survivor fast vaults out of the other. While they get away, Billy picks me up and drops me repeatedly so I could get back up. I thank the Billy by nodding my head and he goes off to find the survivor. It's been like 10mins. Both me and the other survivor found hatch, they keep sending me toxic messages. Eventually, I fast vault the window, Billy comes over, kills the other guy, hooks them and gives me hatch. I get messaged by the toxic survivor, 
---
"I'm reporting you for working with the killer toxic b*tch."
---
"I only led him to you because you sent me toxic messages."
---
"Don't care you're getting reported."
---
"What will that do? We're on ps4."
---
"You will lose your account and suffer "
---
"I won't tho..."
---
"We'll see :)"
---
It's been 3 months and i haven't gotten a warning or a ban.
---
Nea/feng Jane Kate
---
That's why i main Legion.
---
Well... I did, as soon as the patch comes to console i'm boned.
---
But what happens when I say that I frankly enjoy playing Legion? (mostly cause of Susie)
---
Shall I be crucified for playing “meta” even though I just like a killer?
---
Or am I forced to go back to playing my other main Micheal?
---
These are the struggles of trying to have fun when playing Dead By Daylight whilst also not seeming toxic.
---
The exact same thing was posted on the smash ultimate subreddit, coincidence? Eh, probably
---
&gt; You should probably re-read your comment then. I think it takes the award for that.
---
Coming from you this doesn't mean anything, and just glancing over your newest comment I have a feeling you're only gonna double down.
---
&gt; I've never said killers aren't toxic.
---
You just brought up survivors being toxic as if players in general aren't toxic. lol get real.
---
&gt; The game originally did not have SWF. So, and I'm assuming here because it makes sense, survivors and occasional survivors began uninstalling the game. In a panic, devs added it.
---
Took all of about 2 weeks yup. The survivors weren't just uninstalling they were refunding the game entirely and the player base was already on it's way to it's grave as the reviews filled up with this complaint.
---
&gt; This allowed plenty of teamwork for survivors to learn maps together.
---
The maps were much more random back then, totems weren't even a thing until the Hag came out (If I remember correctly she was the 6th killer to come out after Michael)
---
&gt; However, after playing both sides I've found survivor side to be more so.
---
I've also played both sides (More killer than survivor) and find killers much more toxic.
---
&gt; Killers, in response, become toxic themselves. 
---
Players, in response, become toxic themselves. It's the exact same type of people on the other side of the computer screen, this divide is only there to make people feel better about "their side"
---
It's a real easy cycle to understand and it doesn't matter 1 bit which side you're on. Person X does something person Y believes is toxic. Person Y starts doing toxic shit as well, X retaliates with more toxic shit, Y retaliates with more toxic shit. 
---
&gt; Especially when you have swf teams that will DERANK just to bull killers.
---
Just like killers will derank to smash survivors. Oh boy are you seeing the pattern.
---
&gt; I have experienced this plenty of times to the point that I know the swf teams when I see them.
---
I've had plenty of killers call me an SWF when I'm queing solo. I'm sure you're 100% accurate and everyone else is wrong though.
---
&gt; Until they get bored and leave the game or switch to just being a survivor because it is, without a doubt less stressful and more fun
---
Less stressful 100%. More fun is completely subjective and I am on the opposite side of you there. Holding m1 for 90 seconds at a time doing the most benign skill checks that are only made worse by ruin all day is what makes me leave the game.
---
&gt; and more fun since you can play along with friends who in turn grief killers
---
Or you can just que up as a killer and grief survivors whenever you want.
---
&gt; Try thinking a little, friend.
---
You wrote this entire comment and didn't think about what you were talking about once. Please lmao.
---
Love my Doc but there is a wall around rank 10 where his effectiveness lowers and it gets a bit tougher
---
Honestly it did feel a small bit cathartic. Most of the match it was the two Fei Ming (one escaped and this one) just kinda t-bagging and sandbagging their team mates. I smacked one in Gate And they crawled out but I could find the other until this scene.
---
Lots of times when I carry the survivor to the hatch or open gate they wiggle free on the way there and call me names in post :/ like dude I even signaled you!
---
Just Jane. I don't have Jeff.
---
for a guy with your flair you seem to be ignoring Discordance
---
Farming games are boring as fuck
---
You just made my whole day :)
---
Yes. That's exactly what i meant by using angles
---
I never knew I needed this until now.
---
I mean good luck with pronouncing No Mither.
---
&gt; What is: the emblem system to rank up.
---
Cute, but this doesn't govern anything, nor does it "ensure a fair fight". The emblem system dictates what's necessary to gain a rank pip, nothing else. The emblem system doesn't say "thou shalt not defend your hook. thou shalt not play Nurse. thou shalt not slug. thou shalt not do anything that would increase your chances of winning".
---
&gt;  I wonder why so many other people are in lockstep
---
Because there's a lot of butthurt children who play video games and they all seem to have the same general complaint about people not coddling them. This just in: vocal groups touting their nonsense are now automatically validated and cannot be scrutinized for their subjective bitching. More at 10.
---
&gt; Again, the emblem system to actually rank up?
---
Again, you're not pointing to anything other than ranking up. Your original comment was about it not being good control or a good experience. I asked for the rubric, and you keep going back to this pathetic emblem system response. The emblem system isn't there to ensure a good time for everyone involved, it's to guide you on what's necessary to rank up.
---
&gt; You get more points for maximizing 3 hooks off every survivor, that doesn't imply "crushing the survivors' every hope" lmao
---
Ok? And? You're still not answering why you think it's the killer's *job* to *allow* the survivors the *highest probability* of escaping. There isn't an objective answer to that. It may be in your best interest to allow a level of altruism from the survivors to serve yourself in bloodpoints or emblem points, but that has nothing to do with the fundamental basics of the game and the adversarial relationship between killer and survivor. You're just not man enough to come right out and admit you want the game catered to your taste.
---
&gt; Just from that line I'm wondering how seriously you take the killer's role in this game
---
I take it for what it is. The killer is there to kill, and the survivor to survive. Where's the gray area? This is hardly relevant to begin with.
---
&gt; you *really* love pretending to kill people in video games
---
This and
---
&gt; valid to criticize people who play like you are boring and kinda shitty
---
are lame insults that completely avoid the topic. I get it, you really wanna just *stick it to me* and get that "ohhhh burn!" moment in, but try staying on task here.
---
You're entitled to feel however you want about the way someone plays as being "fun" or "boring", but your subjectivity doesn't override objectivity, nor should your whining have any influence on the game structure going forward. The game doesn't revolve around you. Someone may not play the way you'd like them to, but they don't have to, and when you start moralizing and shaming people for playing the game in a way you don't find pleasurable, it just makes you look like a child.
---
&gt; You want this game to be a killer dunk fest
---
No. What *I* want is for this game to be an actual horror experience. You should be afraid of getting found out, and you should feel the thrill of chasing someone. It shouldn't be "/sigh he saw me guess we're gonna run this jungle gym for a few minutes". Survivors should be *avoiding* contact with the killer in fear of their mortality, not running up to him and teabagging trying to provoke them into a chase through a pallet circuit. As it stands, the only "fear* survivors have is the fear of whether or not they're going to get off the hook, and that fear is usually expressed through their butthurt and indignation.
---
&gt;  There has to be counterplay on both sides.
---
Of course, but the degree to which survivors hold power over killers is completely out of whack. It's not survivors trying to counter the killers, it's killers trying to counter the survivors. The unstoppable killing machine hunting you down is humbled by the window ledge, the pallet, and the insane RNG at which they spawn. The power role has been effectively neutered.
---
&gt; not the increasingly-frustrating norm
---
See? This is that subjectivity creeping in again. Competitive games always have some sort of meta associated with them. We get it, you're too cool for the meta and wanna be all edgy and hipster with your gameplay. Fair enough, but not everyone thinks like you.
---
&gt; but because games should be fun to keep people playing them
---
Of course they should be fun, but it's not the responsibility of the playerbase to ensure everyone else is having fun. Fun should be in the design of the game, not at the direction of the players. You may find this surprising, but playerbases in games are not monolithic, and there are quite a few different viewpoints on what's fun, what's best, and so on. I don't understand why you're trying to force conformity other than because it conveniences you the most.
---
&gt; dude didn't mention developers at all so idk how you're gleaning that point out of his 'crush players every hope' and 'this isnt a feel-good-everybody-get-along' message.
---
You didn't see that because you're too caught up in trying to malign me and draw conclusions to suit your argument because you don't like me. It shouldn't be hard to identify that game mechanics being used by the player isn't the fault of the player, and trying to force this lame ass "honor among thieves" set of unwritten rules because "it's what everyone wants" is the problem every competitive video game faces. Someone, somewhere, gets beat, they don't like it, and they want to start restricting the ability of others to play based on their own personal desire.
---
That sort of jaded bullshit is what kills games.
---
Like I said, the *be* gay.
---
Yeah- and I have Noad on this Plague Loadout so I already see hate coming. Problem is, the rest of the perks my Plague currently has are... Not in my play style and are slugging sided. So Noed is more a place holder.
---
I know; it's just something fun I say to have more fun with Ace. I usually run his luck perks and don't do as well evading the killer.
---
Yeah but her right thigh is closer to the camera because she is facing the other way.
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ SUMMON THE FREDDY REWORK ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
Just build the Roman Empire on EU4 while you wait on Paradox Interactive to actually flesh out Imperator: Rome. Come on, Johan!
---
What's the source of this clip? Seems funny.
---
Jeff Slows the game down... because of how thicc he is
---
Numbers
---
Yea the fact the term even exists makes me laugh. I'd never say to a killer they "kill rushed" us.
---
His add ons might get changed with the rework
---
\*pant\* \*pant\*
---
I absolutely love huntress. But because I'm playing on PS4, I've had a really rough time in the beginning. But now I'm actually rather good with her. Usually the survivors I verse underestimate me and won't even juke if they're like 20 meters away. Big mistake.
---
Still, I sometimes verse survivors which are so incredibly good at dodging that I just have to get lucky.
---
Monto does dbd build videos on the daily, he's got tons of Freddy builds too if you're interested ;)
---
Yes... i think we're trying to say the same thing here
---
Keep puking until they have the broken status then knock them. If you see a gen, damage it and puke on it so anyone who touches also gets sick. This also applies to hooked survivors, exit gates, pallets, window vaults  etc
---
The same can be said for Super Smash Bros
---
The idea is that it usually gives you more map pressure than simply hooking a survivor, especially if you have 2 survivors in a relatively defenseless area of the map. Other survivors have to come help the slug get off the ground unless they are running the correct perks (see above).
---
As soon as BL3 drops I’m ditching this trash
---
You’re 100% right, I’ve never understood the appeal of constantly wanting to be red ranks. It’s cool the first time you get there but it’s literally not worth it at all. Longer wait times against the sweatiest of sweats on both sides. 
---
Rank 10-5 has always been the best ranks imo. Competent enough players on both sides but without the sweaty play styles, variety of killers (not just nurse, billy, spirit), and far less toxic behaviour.
---
Hey, don’t let anyone make you feel bad for Noed, it’s a legit perk! People give the developers a hard time but fact of the matter is they spend a lot of time and effort on this game, more than any player with a gripe, and know what is wrong and right. Anyone giving you hate for utilising a legit game mechanic that the developers specifically designed and coded into the game to help killers is just salty.
---
we meet in our dreams UwU
---
It's standard procedure if you're sweating for that 4k.
---
I don’t speak Chinese
---
As far as I know, it resets when she enters a Chase
---
Luckily Spirit checks both boxes for me. But I do love Freddy and Leatherface.
---
Welcome to a BHVR game. Your wasting your breath asking for changes.
---
You have a 4% chance to unhook yourselve and if you succeed that's a Kobe.
---
I like it.
---
yes.
---
Fair enough, I've had fun using his open handed perk - I combo it with bond and plunderers to see chests from a ridonkulous 40m, neat little build
---
Yeah true then agai  I souldn't be surprised at the first place considering how expected it is at this point
---
Just curious if this was during the bloodpoint event or not?
---
That argument kind of worked before they found and fixed the bug in bloodweb generation that made higher rarity items more likely to spawn than intended. Now it's like I can't even get Part Streamers on the reg since they patched that so the economy has damn near crashed for me.
---
As a rank 1 freddy only, i like this post v much
---
Keywords: Just a little bit
---
I'm rank 2 with my piggy and i always fall on super toxic swf teams who never fail at giving me a boring match
---
Trapper main, can confirm. You give me a good game where you play it smart, I like you plenty already. Just don't be an ass and you won't get it back.
---
I'm a rank 5 killer and rank 8 solo survivor. All I know is pain.
---
Hopefully they don't go through with the pig changes but I wouldn't be surprised if they do.
---
Nea is thicc.
---
But what if the character I like is cancer?
---
A fun change yeah but the way things are going, killer wait times are going to get longer and longer because there just aren't enough people willing to play survivor on their own (and for good reason) :/
---
So you’re saying once you get into a high rank on any game you’re not supposed to have fun? That’s not how a game should be
---
This is stolen from Smash bros ultimate
---
Oink!
---
I think they're fixing this. In the event that a game fails to load with 5 players next Patch you won't lose your offerings I think
---
I am also a bing bong boi :]

Zappy? Why not Sparky?

Laurie the Scream Queen.

You’re not bad dirty dan, I bet you’re an amazing killer

How do you know he didnt use deliverance? or slippery meat?
---
...Ok let's go over everything real quick, both currencies mentioned straight from the Dead by Daylight wiki.
---
In [Iridescent Shards](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Iridescent_Shards) :
---
" **Iridescent Shards** *(IS)* are one of **4** in-game currencies in [*Dead by Daylight*](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight) *📷*. 
---
 Introduced with [Patch 1.2.0](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.2.0) the Shards play an integral role in being able to purchase [Teachable Perks](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Teachable_Perks) from the [Shrine of Secrets](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shrine_of_Secrets) 📷 as an alternative to levelling a Character to the necessary [Level](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Level). "
---
This is the currency used for purchasing perks in the shrine, there are 4 perks in the shrine every week and you gain these shards from leveling up your player level.
---
In [Bloodpoints](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints) :
---
 "**Bloodpoints** *(BP)* are one of **4** in-game currencies featured in [*Dead by Daylight*](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight) *📷*. 
---
 **Bloodpoints** are a Player's Character Progression Currency. They are used to upgrade the Characters by purchasing [Unlockables](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Unlockables) from the [Bloodweb](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodweb) 📷. "
---
As far as I have known, these are NOT used for purchasing perks in the shrine, but you can gain bloodpoints from buying perks in the shrine you already owned.
---
In fact, the wiki states this in [Shrine of Secrets](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shrine_of_Secrets) :
---
" The Teachable Perks from the Shrine can not be bought with [Bloodpoints](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints) 📷 (BP). They are bought with [Iridescent Shards](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Iridescent_Shards) 📷 (IS). "
---
This is the only way to acquire perks without paying for DLC packs and as established, Meta perks like BBQ and Chili take an unreasonable amount of time to return to this shrine.
---
My suggestion is as followed: Make all perks obtainable through the store using the same currency as you would with the shrine, with either the shrine now just giving a sale on these perks when it's on there or doing away with the shrine entirely. This is what I meant and I apologize if I have confused you with broad terms like "paying" and "buying" without specification.
---
Something that was already possible on PC can be considered by many a method of cheating for messing with the game's graphical fidelity by use of third party software, making it easier to spot things than when you didn't use any method. Just like how using voicechat programs like Discord to talk with your survivor friends is/was not how the game was meant to be played either. I wanted a solution from specifically them so as to have a clear understanding to what is acceptable or not.
---
I have found that they have approved Nvidia's solution to this problem so whatever you can do with that must be acceptable until they deem it not to be. I found this out after I made the thread so great, now to wait on their approved method for consoles and approved solutions for people with harder hearing.
---
Still got to hook up.
---
No ragrets.
---
His add-ons are very good. Heck, they boost his power to arguably on the lower side of high (5th-6th). 
---
Blocks reduce the dream transition. Best with a surprise Freddy or an aggressive Freddy. Also works with endgame Freddy.
---
Wool Sweater and Dresses reduce skill check chances. It improves his stall tenfold, as they spend longer doing things with a 50% speed penalty.
---
Drawings improve his power range. These allow you to snipe people with the dream transition and freak them out. 
---
Claws and Paint Thinner increase his speed after putting someone into the dream transition. Decent enough, can be zoom Freddy, but not his best.
---
Ropes decrease action speeds of sleeping survivors more. Also decent, but dresses are better. Chains apply more stall but they have to be put to sleep at least twice. Similar rating to ropes.
---
Pill Bottle makes him invisible during dream transition. He can mindgame survivors without it, but this makes the hit guaranteed because you react to what they do without counter.
---
Class Photo extends the dream transition, but for the duration of it all survivors have their auras revealed. His best add-on IMO, as you sleep one, and you sleep another, and another, and the final one for all 4 in the dream world. It's downside benefits the upside. Anti-synergy with Blocks or an ultra rare however.
---
Red Paint Brush slows him down to 112.5%, but reduces your terror radius by 16 meters and the transition time by two seconds. The reduced terror radius can lead to jumpscare Freddy, who sees all sleeping survivors who are further than 8 meters. Combine with Z Block for another 2 second reduction, and they sleep in three seconds. Don't use this with Class Photo, but literally anything else works.
---
Black Box makes you obsess over a survivor, and they start asleep. It is very nice as it starts you off well, but it only affects the early game. One of his worst, but still not horrible.
---
Tip: He is played differently than any other killer. Trying to play him like another killer will fail you. He is about mindgames and killing them over time. He's not mechanically difficult to learn outside of learning when he is visible during the transition, but you need to mentally adjust to him. He's legit mid tier low-balling him (8th - 9th). He works with many perks, even Overcharge for a free 11% gen regression upon wake up. Though this usually needs Blocks so they sleep faster.
---
yeah i like playing legion
---
Fun is subjective. Some people have fun while doing as best as they can, but I understand if you don’t
---
After a 1k Freddy match, I was messaged by one of the survivors who escaped. He was beyond furious that I had noed as a perk, even though A) it never got used because I couldn’t find anyone and B) I was playing endgame Freddy.
---
This guy was a grade A asshole in every sense, and to top it off, he couldn’t spell either. He called me trash several times despite the entire team being hooked twice by the weakest killer, and the only person capable of putting up a good chase was the one who died. I was pretty dismissive and passive-aggressive to him the entire time.
---
Then he sent me a message that word for word said: “Get good kid or better yet but your game game way cuz ur no good”. I asked him if he had a fucking stroke, he reported me and Xbox game me a communication ban because I said fuck.
---
Yeah I didn't quite understand the reaction to these comments... bit unfair. I play because I enjoy the gameplay. You never said, 'therefore there is no reason to ever be upset'.
---
They both accused each other and re-enacted the killer v survivor war on reddit...
---
Don't Know if your joking or not but I might actually do that
---
"she got tapped"
---
I was rank 16.
---
I think its a mental thing, you either get a 4k or you failed/lose
---
I feel like you might not know what thicc means... Nea's skinny as heck.
---
Yeah lemme just inflict myself with some of that ***gay***
---
F
---
Hag main victory scream!
---

Survivor feels bad at low ranks because you need good teammates to have a good match.  Middle purple ranks are the sweet spot. I always try to hover around 6-7.

I just want to sell all those green keys and map addons, thank you very much :I
---
Also stop giving me Cypress Moris and this many map offerings, they're boring...
---
If I could sell my unused things for like 50% of their original value, even just 25%, I could probably P3 a character off of that entirely.
---
10/10 would DC.
---
Nice, glad to hear that they pushed it back again :)
---
Yeah but he could just cloak and stay right where he is and finish his ciggy in peace
---
Got reported for playing Freddy. He just said he was going to report me in very broken English and left.
---
Freddy required an entire remake and not a rework, so they needed more time. He will probably play nothing like he currently plays like.
---
I get they needed time, but it's been more than a year. That is way more than enough time

I was playing Huntress and scored 4k VS 3 of them + 1 random player. They apperently didn't like it..

I even have a screenshot of post game screen that I shared with a friend.

I actually can't find any source verifying the origin as "no skin off my back", could you link me one? As far as I am aware the original phrase is "no skin off my nose", and stems from 20th century boxing
---
I agree, they are SUPER boring, but bloodhunts are short and I suck it up and grind it out and farm as much as I can because having more killers with more perks and more items and addons makes the other 99% of the time I play more fun.  
---
Now some people have all they want/need or just don't care and still don't want to farm and that's fine.  I don't hold it against them.  I hate it too.  I take it when I can get it during a bloodhunt tho.
---
That is the point. :)
---
Kate is thicccc Jane is just fat
---
I got this game when it was free on psn and I instantly loved it. Out of the probably 15 friends that got it only I play it regularly and 3 other friends of mine play it for a week every few months. I quit for awhile because I thought the game was really hard and toxic but I got back into it and I’m happy for that
---
Trap snaps are too satisfying to give up... and padded jaws add to the confusion
---
:) thanks
---
yes! pimp daddy ace is where it's at mate! I absolutely love using my kobe build to YEET myself off the hook more often that not. ace mains unite!
---
Both nurse and billy have counterplay options (even though nurse has considerabely less). Whats « fun » to you ?
---
Freddy main checking in

This wont fix the troll killers who quit a game a few seconds into it. RIP all those BPS.....

Guess that's all the time you have then?

You must not run maps, and map add-on's often.

Oink
---
&gt;Cute, but this doesn't govern anything...The emblem system dictates what's necessary to gain a rank pip     
---
You contradict yourself. You ask for the rubric for the "competition", which in this game is pips to rank up, and it is dictated by the emblem system. It's the ONLY objectively competitive system in this game that measures how you performed. How can you argue against this? Your whole argument of competition in this game is built on the function of the pip and emblem system. You get better emblems for more potential to pip by completing more behaviors in game, chases, more hooks, more gens kicked. That is your metric. It's not my subjective opinion that a well performing killer lets these things play out in order to maintain control over the tempo of the game. You're just being arguing for the sake of argument if you continue to deny this.
---
&gt; are lame insults that completely avoid the topic. I get it, you really wanna just stick it to me and get that "ohhhh burn!" moment in, but try staying on task here.    
---
Funny, that's how I've felt about every single one of your posts.
---
&gt;but your subjectivity doesn't override objectivity, nor should your whining have any influence on the game structure going forward.    
---
Not what I've stated, and not my position.
---
&gt;Survivors should be avoiding contact with the killer in fear of their mortality, not running up to him and teabagging trying to provoke them into a chase through a pallet circuit. As it stands, the only "fear* survivors have is the fear of whether or not they're going to get off the hook, and that fear is usually expressed through their butthurt and indignation.    
---
I agree with you on this part. I would like that, the issue is exactly the competitiveness you are also vying for. With that ranking and pipping, at high ranks, the game will be less thematically or narratively exciting and just become a simple abusable meta where survivors aren't afraid and just troll with the best mechanics possible. 
---
I also agree with you that this is up to the devs to balance, but I'm skeptical it could really be done at top ranks how we would really like. Killers like you will be salty (and ironically also complain like you've done but blame others for doing) and survivors will be salty and complain about the current status of the game (like I've done).
---
&gt;  I don't understand why you're trying to force conformity other than because it conveniences you the most.
---
I'm not? I think you may be misinterpreting something.
---
&gt;You didn't see that because you're too caught up in trying to malign me and draw conclusions to suit your argument because you don't like me.
---
Yeah, I don't really care for you. You've been condescending and lacking any self awareness that all your insults and complaints are the almost the same thing you are insulting and complaining about. Just as you opened the whole thing up with "blah blah this line of thinking is problematic" YOU are also part of the problem. Please take a moment of reflection to realize this. And don't worry, I'll do the same.
---
The only difference in play style is you don't constantly enter Frenzy. You will still enjoy them I'm sure of it.

I'll tell u what is not fun and I'm pretty sure you heard this before, waiting 10 mins just to get in a lobby for a 5 min massacre.
---
What i mean is that people like these are idk dumb or sth because they cant do simple math. You would rather play one game that is like 5 minutes longer to get equivalent of 4-5 games with max points or play it normally and get literally 30k at max with bloodhunt on? Thats the whole point of it, it saves so much time especially if someone thinks that playing normally will eventually give them what they need. Yeah sure but in like 4 times longer?

This is why I need to hide the post game chat when it gets like this.

Myers:

Then youre frustrated about hitting a wall and feeling like you cant do anything. Right ? Learning how to juke a nurse is essential in countering her. Try to play her if you dont understand what im talking about and notice how people play against her. Also using a more stealthy playstyle helps a ton, as this killer is designed for chases
---
Source for the comic?
---
I still HATE that part. But didn't they refert the changes? Or some big ones? Also I will still complain about it wekly don't worry.
---
My last game as spirit i was shamed by 3 survivors for using rancor, and on top of that i had the nerve to kill my obsession with it.
---
Fun fact though, as bubba i get the least amount of salt. I haven't touched insidious since i started playing but it is tempting.

I was reported for using Hex: Devour Hope by someone who had a gamertag that was a play on that perk.
---
Ok
---
Dammit you’re so right 😞
---
Didn't they say they're going to be reverting the terror radius nerf?
---
Yes but that still leaves 2 BS changes.
---
Ah yes.
---
Now I can die in real life by my waifus hand like true degenerate scum.
---
Seriously tho how strong would Suzie have to be to be able to drag a knife straight down through the sternum. (Legion mori)
---
ok thank you just sick playing console want to start playing pc.
---
Legion. With a click of his fingers, half the survivors DC from the match
---
Your GPU should be at least minimum but the CPU is not. Maybe on the lowest settings? I'd buy it on Steam and see if you can run it so you can return it if it doesn't work out.
---
Not confirmed, but following the schedule and past events, I'd say  there is a 99,99999999% of it dropping today.
---
What happened
---
Don't know, currently his add-ons are decent and mostly shorten dream transition time, but it's all subject to change due to the rework the the developers keep talking about.
---
Nope
---
You copied that from r/SmashBrosUltimate
---
Why are all the good perks red on PC? I never understood that because on console the only time you see a red perk is the icon you buy to unlock the teachable
---
It is. Gotta have some thick skin and brush that toxic shit off unfortunately.
---
It sucks,  I love the game but I just cant understand why people are being so toxic
---
What i learned from monto is mapping turn left and right to Q and E. Makes chainsaw surfin a lot easier.
---
I dont understand either but i think a big part of it are the people like angrypug or ochido who are extremely toxic and think its fun so their fan base follows their footsteps
---
I play pig because I like all the ambushes I can do, second behind her is trapper because I just like messing around with traps, the games way more enjoyable when you don't main someone because they are "top tier"
---
Also play Quentin Tapp and Jake despite them all being tall and easier to spot
---
It's a couple different factors. She's a base game character so she's available to everyone, she has good teachable perks so it's a good choice for new players (self care is the most popular survivor perk overall), she's small which makes her good for hiding, and her clothes are typically darker and harder to see.
---
Was the mask home made?
---
The only changes I know of were the terror radius nerf and end game trap nerf for after you trap someone after all gens are powered. If they havw a trap on their head before the 5th gen pops and it does end up popping, the trap still activates as normal. So if you still want to do end game pig builds then put those traps on when it says 1 gen left. I don't really see it as a nerf. I don't run end game builds and it never gets that far for survivors for me. She's been the only killer I use exclusively for the past year now.
---
What's the 3rd change? You said there were 2 more bs nerfs and last I read in the patch notes and heard from the devs those were the only 2. Am I missing one?
---
Yeah I'll start letting people who hit that rng live when survivors who could walk out the exit gate stand there and let me hook them instead.
---
Yeah :D. That would be cool :D
---
I am playing Dead by Daylight since it got released it 2016. I have 3k hours, playing mostly survivor, but was able to hit rank 1 with killer a number of times. So it has nothing to do with me being a crybaby and wanting the game to be easier or whatever.
---
"Tryharding" isn't a term for "doing your best" in this game (even if i can except it as such) but for players bringing the best add-ons, which is basically not even tryharding at all but going easy mode. I'm not talking about trials where the killer has constant map pressure and I' just runnig around the map, getting unhooks, trying to do gens, getting chased, maybe dying before a gen gets done, basically an interesting game. I, and many others, talk about bleeding out on the goddamn ground for 3 minutes or hanging around on a hook for the same time, because the killer is nearby. It's not a craving for LESS interaction, but for MORE.
---
How can there be more interaction with the killer, if i'm on the ground all the time? How can there be interaction, when the killer is (face)camping and all i can do is going suicide for a save or doing a gen? This is NOT what this game is supposed to be.
---
Sure, it's not forbidden to camp or tunnel. I have no problem with calling it "tactics" and "valid", but it is NOT what this game is about and I can give you plenty of reasons why: You can hang multiple times, you have an unhook-interaction, you have a lot of perks for chasing/saving/whateverinteraction, you get more points doing stuff while people are on hook than just staying there doing nothing and take a look at how the emblem system works. 
---
&gt; We're entitled to change our priorities; however, we're not entitled to make someone else play in conformance with our wants.
---
OF COURSE NOT. But especially when you play killer, you DO decide over their faith, once they are on the hook. It has also something to do with respect. Treat others how you want to be treated.
---
Something that helped me with Nurse was using Shadowborn on her.  It makes the lack of vision after blinks less annoying.  Something like Shadowborn / BBQ / Ruin / A Nurse's calling.
---
Why do you feel that teabagging stops you from having a fun time with the game?
---
Well you could add rewards for playing the non solo mode as killer, more BPs, a somewhat rare chance of shards, maybe exclusive killer cosmetics like the prestige ones for doing good in that mode.
---
Also there are a lot of people here claiming to prefer to play against SWF, so i'm sure you could make 2 modes work.
---
BHVR design team...just saying, I'm available
---
I mean, he was probably talking about the Emblem system but I’m glad y’all are having fun
---
Actually someone added it up, still over 70% of the cosmetics can be bought with shards currently, it's just that a lot of auric cell exclusive cosmetics have been released lately
---
&gt; Well you could add rewards for playing the non solo mode as killer, more BPs, a somewhat rare chance of shards, maybe exclusive killer cosmetics like the prestige ones for doing good in that mode.|
---
The games already balanced around SWF being in the game you're already getting SWF level Blood points
---
All this would do is split the community of an already small game with que problems.
---
Too many cons
---
And the only pro is killers get either easier games or free cosmetics lol
---
Huntress my first and only main
---
I run that build for fun whenever I get a considerably increases luck offering
---
Now I understand why it is called "Bloodweb"
---
Haha, killer use perk I no like. Bad, trash. Teabag xddddd.
---
10000/10 would totally let you stab me
---
Sashay away!
---
Enjoy playing it through Epic Store, buddy. ;)
---
^(spyware)
---
Being stealthy doesn't work when she uses atleast 3 detection perks, and she can afford to spend a while looking because she can end the chase instantly unlike most Killers.
---
Juking around corners would be useful if she didn't have another blink. Most good Nurses use the first to close distance and the next to actually hit you based off your movement.
---
Being unpredictable could work for the first few of her blinks, but she should catch on rather quickly. There's only so many "unpredictable" plays you can do in a game as linear as DbD.
---
Well I play solo survivor and play killer, what am I?
---
Agree, but thats all we can do. If a nurse is that good then doesn’t she deserve the win ?
---
This actually makes me wonder if any of the killers at all could take anything more than a knife to the gut and live to tell the tale if they weren't in the entities realm.

Sunday night I played against a Nurse that was so good and precise with her blinks; it truly humbled me. I'm a great survivor and I died first. Had to stay until the game ended so I could congratulate her and complement her skill
---
Dwight is my baby.
---
I completely empathize with people who complain about noed and play solo survivor, it's really frustrating to go against. But if you play swf and complain about noed, you really have no one to blame but yourself
---
Age Of Empires HD is where it's at.
---
There is something magical on Myers. Nobody is afraid of a Billy, or a Nurse, but we all fear the Stalky boy
---
not anymore, to be fair
---
Respecting KOBE is good old tradition.
---
How is the game balanced for SWF? It sure doesn't feel that way to me.
---
If you want survivor pros as well then give the same benefits to survivors that solo que. At other posts people are already discussing that the grind is too much and more BP income is needed. These new modes would help with that as well.
---
Also this game is not small at all and could easily do with 2 seperate modes, at least on PC, don't have the numbers for console.
---
Oooh havent seen this clip in a while
---
Personally I think that teachable should be available as soon as you get the character. I just switched to pc and have to unlock al the perks again on killers I won’t use after I do. It just adds an unnecessary
---
Embarrassing

Rancor, free Mori
---
Deliverance inflicts the broken status effect. You see the little icon next to their name.
---
Well, we have it already, it is called micro led, just need time to get the cost down.
---
Actually, a little while ago someone made a post about a chart of killers and survivors, survivors were about 52-54%, but that's none of my business
---
I like to think of bad comments as gym badges
---
&gt; How is the game balanced for SWF? It sure doesn't feel that way to me.
---
Because it's been in the game for years. I'm pretty sure the devs are aware of it. They just suck at balancing the game.

&gt; If you want survivor pros as well then give the same benefits to survivors that solo que. At other posts people are already discussing that the grind is too much and more BP income is needed. These new modes would help with that as well.

You mean further split the community on top of the split that you're asking for.
---
&gt; Also this game is not small at all
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA https://steamcharts.com/app/381210

You must be new here. Consistently half hour long que times have come and gone for killers and survivors throughout the life of this game.

---
For me, it's because it's unfriendly and used to insult/make fun of the killer and it's not fun for me to play games with these people (as killer or fellow survivor). I don't see the appeal of making others feel bad. Often you know when you made mistakes or got outplayed and the following teabag/flashlight clicking is just adding insult to injury and unnecessarily toxic. It just doesn't feel good to get treated that way and hence makes the game less fun.
---
I will always love clown
---
Ah right, I forgot about its after effect.
---
The meta is boring to me. I don’t want to play nurse with Ruin, BBQ, Nurse’s Calling, and Shadowborne every single game. I also find hillbilly boring to play as, but I know some people who enjoy playing him so it’s just personal preference. I find low tier killers so fun to play as because I don’t expect to win anyways so I can mess around and do whatever I want. Don’t have to try hard at all.
---
Wraithcars :-D
---
You might be right with the sea of average players there!
---
Rank 2 killer here. This is accurate. End me
---
A masochist.
---
Of course its a freddy with block add ons.
---
"Ugh, fuck survivor, I just get matchmade with paint drinkers and against wallhacks. That's it, I'm playing killer!"
---
"Ugh, fuck killer, I just get matchmade against neon loopers and flashlight Claudettes. That's it, I'm playing sur- oh..." /s
---
I mean, she's probably the easiest character to play once you figure out the muscle memory which takes only a handful of games, so I don't think they "deserve" to win when her power revolves around having absolutely zero counterplay. She would deserve the win if she outskilled the Survivors by beating their counterplay to her, but there is none.
---
Oof I see what you mean. I have the Jacket for his urban style look but I’m still waiting for the shirt it’s gonna take a while to get
---
Because as soon as you unhook someone, even if you're running We'll Make it or a styptic kit, they will run from the hook like Usain Bolt going for the gold. Can't blame them because 90% of killers run BACK to the hook just as fast instead of pushing people off gens.
---
legion main here please dont bully me
---
I think what you were trying to say is someone who wants to commit not alive
---
Ok, then those survivors are entitled children.  I can understand during 2x bloodpoints event, but just doing that randomly is stupid af
---
Wraith is better than people give him credit for, to be honest. The speedboost allows you to get so many free hits in, it's unreal.
---
Aren't omega and multiple blinks the same thing?
---
Ah I never heard of that lol
---
Lol nah I think having to grind for the teachables is fair. Everyone wants the game to be easy...
---
Aw shit, here we go again.
---
Ouch.
---
I love playing Freddy cuz his attack animation is so satisfying... Unfortunately when I get to red ranks I lose a lot
---
Well, Michael seems pretty unkillable. He gets shot six times in the heart and fall of from the second floor off a house and gets back up only a few moments later. Among other things.
---
Also, I don't think Freddy can truly die either.
---
They aren’t always good though. I’m garbage with Nurse. I can 4K, but if you guys can be sneaky and hide, you’ll stomp me.
---
The time has come and so have I
---
And this comment makes me believe you are a kid. Mat is a great guy. If you really think that then you are really immature.

Suzy when she sees the nerfs
---
There have been plenty of points in my games where I've had Deliverance and something like Dead Hard, Mettle of Man, or Decisive Strike. Sometimes the hatch is close to where you're hooked, and a few seconds is really all you need.
---
I play _almost_ exclusively Freddy and Bubba at high ranks and still have a lot of fun, because fun is what you make it.
---
I love the fact, that Legion is the most hated but also the most cosplayed character ever hahaha.
---
But it looks really good! \*thumps up\*
---
Because there are hardly any logical and reasonable people in the Dbd community. I'm not saying I'm better, I actually pretty much suck as an individual, but this community really is quite odd.
---
Trappy boi baby
---
Omega is 5 and multiple is just more than 1 😂
---
Are you sure that's not correlation? My profile's private because I just want it to be between me and my friends. If I have everything open, I risk toxicity if I dare to put a down thumb review on a dogmatic playerbase indie game.
---
Players on PS4 and I assume Xbone complain about toxic messages from toxic players after matches. I have no idea if they can make their communication private only but it sounds like it's defaulted to open. I don't know if steam users had toxic comments on their steam profiles from DBD ever.
---
Only after the EGC starts.
---
Well, i'm lucky i'm on ps4 so  i don't really hear this, cause people are to lazy to send you a private message XD
---
Something seems very wrong here.  A Ranger Med-kit (purple) has 32 charges while a Emergency Med-kit (green) has 24 charges.  So it makes sense that you would get more heals from a ranger when just using the med-kit.  But why does using the exact same add-ons then allow the Emergency Med-kit to heal more than the Ranger Med-kit.  This makes no sense... add-ons should effect them in the exact same manner...
---
 H A W T
---
The PLAG dude ...
---
Wraith and Doctor were the first killers I played when I bought the game and even though I play survivor 99.9% of the time, I still occasionally love playing as my bing bong and shocky lads.
---
yes!!! thank you so much!
---
Jeff Johansen actually has a perk that highlights the auras of anyone you have unhooked, or has healed you or you healed them, cant remember what it’s called but you can easily stack that ritual in a match or 2 using it.
---
Jane's just fat, that's a difference. Nea stands for entity while Kate stands for thickness
---
My thing is is I've played with a full SWF group and been stomped even with comms because at the end of the day a good killer is a good killer.  So its kind of a weenie excuse either way
---
Bing bong! :D
---
When a Leatherface using Rancor said he was reporting me for hacking because.... he couldn't Rancor me *before any gens were done.*
---
That’s not true. Omega blink is a 2 blink nurse with add-ons that make you go extremely far with a trade off of accuracy, which isn’t even a noticeable downside when you can go that far.
---
I like using Doctor, and Wraith as long as I have certain add-ons for him. I really should buy Myers already, I quite like using him through offerings and all.
---
Truly fascinating. Thanks for sharing.
---
Dude that's pretty damn good well done!
---
The dc’s have been pretty crazy recently. I’ve been in luck on my survivor games and my teammates usually stay. But when I play killer, if I catch anyone before the 2minute mark it’s usually a guaranteed DC.
---
Ability: Nuke
---
Kills all survivors at the beginning of the game
---
&gt; The game is balanced around the idea that SWF is in the game by now.
---
Ahahaha, how? SWF still trump killer stealth abilities, know where a hex is as soon as one of them sees it, makes null and void several killer perks while simultaneously making obsolete several survivor ones, etc. etc. The game has a long way to go before it's balanced for SWF.
---
Lego is more funny
---
* Screenshot highlighting that everyone disconnected.
---
or doctor, since he basically has the reality stone?
---
Key to killer... Embrace the salt and toxicity. That’s your fuel. Or be petty like me and make a sandbag  and mori list. Those are for the “special” members of my fellow survivors and a few jerk killers.
---
I've actually seen a few videos where it's happened. You get to put the trap on, but as soon as the animation is over, the person is standing and can sprint off.
---
Lol guess we’ll see
---
Forgot the difference, omegablink and multi blinks are the most broken things in the game
---
Lmao you are the epitome of this subbreddit. There's a reason game developers don't listen to the masses of people.
---
#trappermaingang
---
this happened to me when I was searching around for the hatch as the last person and it was absolutely terrifying just hearing that in the distance behind me
---
Or you're just so thickheaded you don't want to see the truth.
---
Nah...
---
Now we need one where it's reversed and instead the other chat bubble just say \*Works on generator\*
---
This might be my favorite post I’ve seen on this sub
---
&gt;Juking is essential when playing against her, thats most of the counterplay.
---
Juking the one Killer you literally can't juke. If you do "juke" her, 1.) she's probably not very good and 2.) she can use however much time she needs to find you because chases aren't a thing to her. She doesn't have to find you and *then* chase, she simply has to find you. And tracking isn't very hard.
---
&gt;Try to play her, muscle memory is only the very basics.
---
I've played her extensively, from 2016 to now. I've never gotten less than a 3k with her, and that's just using my knowledge of Survivor. I have like 3 perks on her (I don't care to level her), now imagine I had BBQ, Ruin, Shadowborn and Infectious Fright? You'd have to try harder to lose than you would to win.
---
&gt;The game established its own rules
---
Which Nurse bypasses every single one of those rules.
---
clean your room frank!

"These survivors used 2 bloody party streamers? Well I better camp hooks with a crouched pig."
---
When me and my buddy played during 2X bloodpoints weekend.
---
Yet your steam name literally states you will dc on a certain map. 
---
I’m not saying they should have DCed in this case, but if you honestly dc every time you get Haddonfield, you probably don’t have much room to talk.
---
All you have to do is re-read your comments for thickheadedness.  
---
We have a long history of what works and what doesn't work across multiple platforms and genres. But sure you know better lol
---
According to who? You? K, lol.
---
And maybe if lots of people are saying the same thing in regards to SWF, including the devs, it's true....
---
that colour glitch always happens to me on the asylum half of the times it's pure blue  for me
---
The ptb started two weeks ago today. It hasn’t been “weeks” lol.
---
It's a bot.
---
They never said this. They said we would hear more news about his rework this month. That’s it.
---
Woo!    
---
So manh bug fixes! Is Technician still messed up? It doesn't muffle the working on a gen sound.
---
Stay close to walls and make sharp turns, he will hit the wall and have a mental breakdown for a couple of seconds.
---
Good for Ash that the Doctor wasn’t there lol. He is buff af
---
Generator: *KA-BOOSH*
---
it's 5.4 gigs wtf
---
holy shit finally no more infinite mending legions holy shit you were a bitch if you did that
---
they are additive, but they increase the progress you're making each second, not reduce the time needed to complete
---
When does the end game update hit ps4?
---
But at that point i might as well just switch to one of the other m1 killers. I played Legion mainly because pre-nerf he is hands down 100% the best bp farming killer.
---
You can easily get 3 categories maxed with another half way, every match. Combined with BBQ and an offering and you can easily make upwards of 150k-200k bp an hour with legion.
---
Now with the nerf you'd be lucky to make half that.
---
It just decreases the range it can be heard unless it got buffed
---
I dont understand how the rubber band works if the rubber band is holding down the button when you have to press the button to attack not hold.
---
Myers is one of the most flexible killers out there.
---
If you are looking for a chase-focused build go for Enduring - Spirit's fury so you don't waste too much time on pallets.
---
If you like sneaking around i highly suggest Monitor &amp; Abuse, since it reduces your heartbeat to 0 on tier 1, and tier 2 is still hard to tell if you are close.
---
Ruin is a must since Myers needs to walk from gen to gen. Buy some time
---
It all depends on your playstyle.
---
\#PigIsStillFineAndYouAreOverreactingBigTime :)
---
They got hot fixed out like 2 weeks ago.
---
Yes true
---
Is Bloodhunt still active? and for how long.
---
Improved controller stuff huh? Wonder how much better it will feel.
---
\#IKnowButIAmJustKeepingPeopleIntrestedInAmanda :)
---
I see, but insults are just insults. They are empty. They don't mean anything. You are a human being who doesn't need to feel bad about themself for anything like a mistake in a video game. Especially when someone is trying to make you feel bad. "Oh, that survivor outplayed me then teabags. They are trying to tell me I'm bad. Is this true? Am I bad? No!" This mindset can help I think. I used to be nervous too in my early killer games but that feeling faded away. Now I love playing killer matches even when they are taunting me. Hope this helps a little.
---
I'm not saying the world wouldn't be a better place if there were no insults to each other. But it's kind of unrealistic to hope that all insulting players will become a friendliest beings ever so it's useful to learn to deal with those and you won't feel bad anymore for no reason.
---
Yeah.  I first started playing killer WAY after spamming survivor and killing low level unskilled players was/is not fun.  I would much rather the game actually be a challenge and enjoyable.
---
It is not. Ended yesterday.
---
What if you like characters that happen to be meta? FeelsBadMan
---
What you don't seem to understand is that these people don't even care all that much about getting more bloodpoints in a shorter time.
---
\#HappyOinkOink :)
---
&gt; Tentatively fixed an issue that sometimes caused the Entity window blockers not to block windows.
---
Tentatively? The hell?
---
Meanwhile Laurie mains get the short end of the stick with a character that sticks out like a sore thumb on most maps and usually gets tunneled :' ^ )
---
\#IFeelLikeWeUseHashtagToMuch :)
---
Miss Anne Aesthetic, your presence in the maxi challenge was overwhelming, but your entity couture failed to shock the judges. I'm sorry my dear but you are up for elimination.
---
Except "just hide lol" -matches net about as much bloodpoints as just getting shitstomped, so you dont have a point here.
---
PS4 patch is out now
---
From his profile
---
I use Laurie because when I saw the first Halloween movie when I was about 10 she was kinda my first crush (When she was young not when she was older)
---
Use Pig and tebagge surviver on the hook it is better than facecamp
---
Its out for PS4 now
---
You are correct!
---
Some people just want to play like normal and don't care about getting multiple perks or whatever, they should be allowed to do that.
---
Have you ever played a multiplayer game before? Don't think of them as people and get over it or play a different game.
---
&gt;&gt;Just because it is in the game for a long time doesn't mean the game is balanced around it.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;This is purely moronic.
---
It would be moronic to assume that something is balanced just because it is around for some time.
---
I don't know what you are doing to get 30min que times on PC. That simply never happens for me unless it's a bugged lobby and from reading this sub only PS4 has such load times. 
---
18k players is plenty, it is #23 of games played on the link you provided, what do you want?
---
And ofc not every one plays 4 man SWF that's why you have a matchmaking system (which already is in the game).
---
You simply decide to click on 'play as survivor' and get matched with only solos, or press 'survive with friends' group up with your friends and then get matched with other people that chose this mode
---
Pls refer to "pig" as Amanda Young, but I agree, remember me still shit and I suggested a great Left Behind change but the devs chose to keep it terrible.
---
Mines only 1.1 gig?
---
i got my progress all deleted , all characters level 1 , surely this has to be  fixed SOON?!
---
it's often the survs just having fun and not actively trying to make you feel bad, if I see someone tbag I just nod my head at them.
---
Rip pig
---
And no Freddy change still?
---
Window blocking was implemented as a counter to infinite’s that.... no longer really exist. I can see them testing it out.
---
wait is this real?
---
nah we are near 2.7
---
Any Ingame info like a lore or something?
---
Yeah, sadly. :P
---
Is this a shit post or is there evidence?
---
Someone has already posted a HD version
---
Its ghostface. He already got his hero power and one perk. Not good for them to leak shit like this.
---
It was clearly planned, they didn't refert most of the things we complained about in the PTB so it is a distraction.
---
I wish my Photoshop skills were that on point
---
Never forget AUS and NZ players when this goes live :(
---
Nope ain't joking on that
---
You know what I mean. Your context made it sound like it has been multiple weeks.
---
Haha, that would be great, but I think I'm gonna be drawing DBD stuff for the rest of the year. xD
---
Oh, just wait... &gt;_&gt;
---
If they change it to the analog button for example.
---
Could have sworn we were around 3.1 or something.
---
He looks kinda lame. Why doesnt he have a big, fully black gown like in the movies? I already imagined it looking really cool that way with the black gown floating majestically behind Ghostface as he runs through the map.
---
Got the booga sound from an old childhood show
---
I just saw on twitch stream. It is 100% true.
---
I hit a David off a hill and he went flying into my random trap and it was so funny. stuff like that is why I started gaining him.
---
well maybe
---
Yeah I already know this after a huntress waited on the hatch for a good hour
---
&gt; I personally don't think he needs reworked 
---
No offence man but this killed any chance of me thinking you know enough about the game to take this idea seriously but I'll try
---
&gt; The dream transition is 10 seconds 
---
So in other words just for him to be able to hit let alone down all 4 survivors it takes him a guaranteed minimum of 40+ seconds and 10+ for just 1. This is literally worse than his current state of requiring 7 seconds to hit a survivor.
---
&gt; Window vaulting, pallet vaulting, locker entering, and locker exiting speeds of the survivors are reduced by 20%. 
---
So a fast vault takes 0.1 second longer to do, makes 0 difference.
---
&gt; My goal was to make Freddy remain a stall and tracking killer, but give him a bit of extra help mid chase 
---
But this is not what Freddy is, Against good Survivors his ability doesn't actually stall the game, it does the exact opposite it gives survivors guaranteed extra time to get things done. And on top of that survivors can easily counter the effects of his abilities giving them even more free time.
---
Aww, thank you! I'm really glad you like it. I will definitely do Trapper sometime, just not sure when! I think Pig is next on the docket!
---
I hope
---
Yes, they're hot fixing it now. Even all of his add-ons were showing up.
---
AMAZING! &lt;3
---
I really hope so. I'd be so excited to play the game.
---
LOL I love how the placeholder icon is Michael's face...because Ghostface's power is just fucking like Michael's but with leaning and crouching.
---
Huh. His power image is Myers mask.
---
Aww, thank you! I appreciate it!
---
oh shit u right
---
removing this :D
---
Is that twitter guy gonna be pissed? Lol
---
If you have proof that your characters were a certain level, create a up port ticket ASAP
---
It's in the game for everyone right now
---
With how often shit gets leaked it's gotta be intentional.
---
there is no way this was on accdeint, either they chose to do it on purpose or someone is intentionally messing with it.
---
Aw, thank you so much! I don't know what message you're talking about--send me a PM? Reddit mail is definitely not easy to parse through!
---
Yes Dwight jr
---
Jane: [orgasmic sounds](https://youtu.be/5HHaac_aicw?t=4)
---
Actually, I have his character model (cosmetics), ability, and 1 perk. I'll share soon.
---
The "conversation" I posted wasn't the whole conversation, but let's just say it wasn't family friendly. Plus, I ain't someone to boost another's ego when they could be put in their place.
---
Yeah, I agree with you. I didn't mean to say that it's necessarily that big of a deal, just that it makes it less fun for me. I try to shrug it off the same way, but the success varies depending on my mood. Thanks for your comment, you have a healthy attitude.
---
This is the end of an era
---
PM me who it is
---
And then how would they have the analog button constantly pressing? 
---
Sorry about all these questions im just really curious how there doing it and i wanna call them out on it 😂
---
New perk “spoiler” 
---
Reset two weeks of progress 
---
Adding a leak of new character on your profile 
---
Bans you for two days after the effect ends.
---
“I can say that we did a pretty good job so far”-(Mathew Scott )
---
yea ge has kinda the same power go on twith to find out more
---
It'll remain only in my memory now 🙏🏻
---
I'd wager opening exit gates is easier than this one.
---
Welp, GhostFace is leaked I guess.
---
Aye... I love running Feng with orange dress and tree frog hair... but I just get my nuts tunneled off. So I started playing ash P3. I think it actually scares killers into not chasing me. 
---
I feel bad for loving ash more than my ling mingers.
---
HOW... do you fucking not notice it and push it live? xD
---
before anyone asks I saw 3 other streamers with "The Ghost"
---
apparently DBD done goofed up again
---
What did the post say?
---
Yeah, I tend to take things a bit too personally sometimes, even when it doesn't really make sense. Thanks for your comment. I'll try to remember it when I play again. :)
---
I’m still all for a game mode where Ash hunts down the killers
---
That requires 2 things:
---
1. Teammate to sit still and let you heal them.
---
2. Killer to not be Legion/Plague or tunnel directly off unhook.
---
Which things?
---
I'm not sure if this plays into it,  but doesn't the emergency medkit use less charges?
---
a 20% debuff to 99% of the actions in this game makes 0 difference, this is why his Fire Up perk is so bad a 0.1 second increase is gonna make 0 difference, along with the amount of time it would take for him to even get a survivor just downed, the other 3 survivors can do a 1 gen each
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bls44o/guys/
---
That shit was still happening in the last few days.
---
&gt;They got hot fixed out like 2 weeks ago
---
What? No they didnt, they just put a post threatening to ban anyone who used the addons
---
Shame they've done nothing about the audio problems.
---
Watched one of my vids from a year ago, and the difference is NIGHT AND DAY.
---
Love that you can see that its Michael myers
---
Currently not. And I think Morf denied that too, that there is no ghostface survivor.
---
What’s your point? Just to complain? You think you are guaranteed a 30k match because you throw down a BPS?
---
I’m not even defending Nurse. I’m saying, I suck with her and if you hide, you’ll probably beat me. Your alternative is running around loops and letting me see you easily.
---
Is the Ghost the new killer?? Can anyone elaborate on the leak please?
---
I guess something went wrong with xbox because I didnt get the update 😟
---
&gt;Reworked the character collision in the basement stairs to prevent hostage situations.
---
What does this mean?
---
At least a month of waiting until PTB/release though 😭
---
RIP basement builds
---
Good like killing the spirit. She's a fucking ghost. Now if Ash was a ghostbuster,  maybe you'd have something there.
---
please tell me as well
---
It would be super fucking cool if it happened. Considering he snapped and tried to kill his family, maybe his perks could center around unpredictability (stemming from the mental instability) or even betrayal of other survivors (though this would go against the idea of altruism that's so heavily encouraged).
---
He looks a bit off
---
... *curb your enthusiasm theme starts playing over the agonizing screams of survivors*
---
I like David because he’s a cutie. And Laurie/Michael because I love the Halloween movies.
---
So the obsession changes every time someone gets hooked? That token system also kind of acts like BBQ.
---
Yeah cause they uploaded the dev build as a patch not the real build for us
---
WHAAAAAADSSSUUUUUUUUUUP!

---
A German streamer just started the game after the patch and was able to see the new DLC Killer.
---
nope encountered like 4 yesterday
---
His default skin is all black. This was a blue recolor.
---
2 weeks is multiple weeks, as its more than 1. I dont get why you are so desperate to be notpicky about this. Your wrong. I meant exactly what I meant
---
To be fair the Halloween series has like different 6 timelines so it’s hard to gauge what has killed him/ actually hurt him. Hell in one of the movies he has green blood when bashed with a pipe and in another one he survives a swat team lighting him up. 
---
Also Freddy can die, but only under very plot convenient circumstances.
---
That explains it hope it's real
---
sounds like shit
---
Remember me being shit, Left Behind still shit, some people disagree with Legion and or Pig.
---
I just try to think that they're having a really bad day and if that makes them feel better, to be a little bit of a troll for 20 minutes, then so be it, I hope it helps.
---
Of course, they might just be assholes in real life who kick puppies, but it helps me to think they're just having a bad day.
---
Ash swings broomstick over his shoulder, “Just as I planned!”
---
Doesn't correlation mean trend?
---
To be fair he is unfinished
---
Emotes, possibly?
---
Yeah a mix of pig and myers i guess.
---
***COUGH*** nurse ***COUGH***
---
That dude was milking it so damn hard too
---
Any changes to ps4 matchmaking? I thought that was supposed to be addressed
---
Yeah i guess that answers it. Still dumb that if they know the game will be the farming one, they sometimes stay, do gens, leave. You dont even pip that way cause we have great ranking system
---
when it's4v1 but you still think killer is supposed to be the easy role
---
No one has mentioned the Coldwind Farm changes, no more see through walls on the jungle gyms. I need to see for myself still but its in the patch notes. Nice QoL for killers on those maps.
---
(https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Inc-WEKJPX4) [1:43]
---
They did an Oopsi
---
Well we got the new Killer Perk &amp; Power LEL
---
It’s funny because Morf knew about the killer before this too and said everyone would love it lol
---
I’ve only edited the files to take off the FPS cap
---
It never was and never will be, unless the Pig uses NOED and slugs everyone down, there is no reason for more than one survivor to die from it/hook.
---
Blood warden would seem kind of scary now with EGC
---
No, it's actually doable with normal play now.
---
What is the current patch going on PS4? Is it the Endgame Collapse update?
---
Is it comming to xbox today
---
So another stealth killer SWFs can completely negate the stealth of. Ok, devs.
---
Can someone transcribe the perk? I can’t read all of it.
---
Yeah pretty much. Really the only people who are still upset are the legion mains who only tunneled
---
they could use it, given out rough chasing through the cornfields can be
---
[deleted]
---
Literally everything ghost face has been posted in the last 5 minutes.
---
How could he NOT notice?
---
Leaked Claudette cosmetic
---
Wait I'm confused. If you can only hook someone 3 times and on the third time you hook the obsession you lose all your tokens and they are sacrificed how can you get up to 4 tokens?
---
RBT gate kills is one of the main selling points for the Pig though. You only get a limited amount of RBTs and so are given options in how to use them. ASAP to stall early/mid game, or save them to be an end game powerhouse. It was one of the few things that made the Pig more than a basic M1 Killer.
---
But now it's gone. Saving a RBT only hurts you in the end. It removes skill and strategy from an otherwise weak Killer, making Pig that much worse. It also drives more people into playing nothing but Billy or Nurse as each Killer that has (or had) a unique trait gets kicked in the balls.
---
I think you should clean up a bit. (supposed to be funny)
---
Keep these saved. The devs are damage controlling on the steam discussions (removing posts talking about the leaks).
---
They *have* to be doing this on purpose
---
Wait with this perk you can put it on Spirit with M&amp;A and be a 0m spirit. Nurse down to 8m. Oh my god.
---
Yes. It’s also on the front page.
---
Ooof
---
Did the same pose in the movie too.
---
I'm a baby Spirit main. The only time I got major salt was a streamer who won the hatch faceoff. Toxicity is hard because I'm too worried about, y'know, winning the game. In fact, I'd argue Spirit is a major detoxer -- whenever someone starts pallet looping or shit like that, you phase-shift and fuck their shit up.
---
Any idea if the controller thing applies to console? I assume it does but can't find any verification.
---
Courage the cowardly dog?? Haha
---
is that her preferred pronoun?
---
Hm, yes, I guess I don't know English then. I think I've lost my point so I'll leave it here. Have a nice day!
---
Try r/tipofmytongue
---
Luck is such an outdated mechanic. They really need to rework anything revolving luck.
---
What do you mean? People have been asking for this for a long time.
---
Interesting power, I’d piss myself to see some guy leaning around a corner
---
Covers his eyes and mashes the 'post button'
---
even the pics he posted were from another reddit post lol
---
He seems like a stronger Myers. If his ability doesn't have a sound cue for the survivors to let them know they're exposed, he can stalk them, get them exposed, and sneak up on them and one hit down them without them knowing. He's going to be trash on some autohaven without spirit fury enduring just because being stealthy isn't really possible, but I think he'll play REALLY well and be extremely fun on maps like Macmillan, The Game, basically any map with tall cover and a lot of random objects to hide behind.
---
that's kinda lame
---
These devs are so dumb jeez lol. Anyway he looks cool i guess
---
Pro-Tip: if you buy each part of the outfit individually it can be bought with shards for some of the ac outfits.
---
You should spoiler-tag this. As a rule of thumb, leaked information should always be spoiler-tagged on this sub.  
---
I'm sure there will be another PSA talking about it within the next 48 hours, as there was with the previous leaks regarding Ash.
---
The green blood was when the dude injected him with acid.
---
Just ignore Freddy (it’s what the devs have done) and he’ll go.
---
Or you could snog him, bury his body, turn him into a foetus, push him in an oven or show him his reflection.
---
Someone's getting fired.
---
No TR Leatherfaces just giving you the Myers stare.
---
I'm a massive Scream fan &amp; have been since 1996, and I never wanted Ghostface for this game because for me, the allure was always in the mystery &amp; this game cannot have mystery. Ghostface wasn't like Michael or Freddy or Jason or Leatherface where it was just Always Them, it was - not counting the TV show - 7 different people.
---
That said, this power seems interesting, I like that the perk references Scream 1.... but those cosmetics are fucking painful.
---
You didn’t go to school today Frank, give me a reason &gt;:(
---
Each time you hook a person you gain a token, each token decreases your terror radius by 4 meters while in a chase for a total of 16 I think? I can’t read all of it either but I know that’s what the perk does roughly
---
Tight.
---
And gay?
---
I think Michael will still hold firm, I am more concerned for Pig because of the crouch aspect. Michael still has a considerably smaller terror radius. I just wish they came up with something more unique for killer abilities, instead of just combining two abilities together to make them into one. 
---
Guess we won't know until he's live.
---
I restarted steam and it’s 850mbs now, which I had earlier cause I wasted 30 mind downloading half of the 5 gigs.
---
No ti wouldn't, just cleanse it before and you'll never face it.
---
He doesn’t get the lunge bonus tho
---
Its real
---
If you respect her, yes. Don't know why I am getting downvoted tho.
---
I imagine it's just a placeholder for now. Seeing as this isn't meant to be released for like 6 weeks.
---
I thought the same thing so I figured I'd just throw myself into the ring lol
---
Its so dumb though I mean new news is nearly always got via this
---
Fyi, these are custom perk sets, I modified the game files to get them.
---
Back in the day, there we’re ultra rare perks for some of them, such as adrenaline, decisive, self-care, etc. the devs later changed it because the RNG of getting the ultra rare was bad, so it’s capped at very rare.
---
No chase ability, so he probs be bad yup :(
---
It is not really about protecting NOED, it is more about making survivors hunt for it before it is lit.
---
So like a creepier Myers
---
Things get leaked frequently so at this point it's gotta be intentional. They can't be this bad, right?
---
It's like the devs don't learn.
---
If you get a RBT on your head after the gates are powered you wont escape in 90% of the cases anyways. Unless the Pig lets you.

---
So it's just the Shape, but with a more limited one shot for the trade of a controllable 0 terror radius?
---
If you can read between the PR bullshit, they say the same thing on nearly all of the live streams.    Just ask about Season rewards to make achieving higher ranks matter...
---
But also kinda pointless.
---
I need a clip...
---
I give them props for these leaks!
---
They are unstoppable lmaooo
---
its fixed now, turns out they released the 3.0.0 patch for minutes by mistake. thank you
---
If she's underpowered now, she should receive other buffs to compensate. She shouldn't keep mechanics that aren't fun or trick new players because that's their only hope of killing.
---
Morf said no
---
Just got Spirit, what are some tips and tricks for her? What perks and add-ons to use? And any youtuber to watch for Spirit gameplay?
---
That's weird lol, I'll tell my friends to do that if they see that issue.
---
Yup just got the patch!
---
Yes, it's pretty much just to prevent NOED from appearing.
---
The idea is not to protect perks, is to make survivors waste time doing other objectives, not just gens.
---
How do you know though?
---
I made this for you: https://www.plot-generator.org.uk/xg3hy6j/tall-kate.html
---
Laughs in nurse
---
That’s a fat oof
---
What platform is this? I see some grammatical errors as well...
---
The game is killer sided for 95% of the playerbase. 
---
At the very top levels, it is overwhelmingly survivor sided due to the proliferation of SWF and comms usage. Elite survivors will dumpster elite killers almost every time. If you don't believe me, go watch the depip squad absolutely body 5 blink ebony Mori nurses at rank 1 with no perks or items.
---
It is not about protecting NOED, it's about giving an incentive for survivors to look for totems.
---
No to all of the above.
---
He was removed very quickly after being leaked, the build was a dev build so he was auto unlocked for that build but he is gone now only people who downloaded right away got it.
---
Just use empathy
---
Basically a Myers Pig hybrid that can lean around corners and control his terror radius.
---
M1 as fuck but i'm maining him/her/it regardless.
---
Yeah definitely then I’m chilling at around 11–12... well... I guess I’ve got everything you mentioned to look forward to when I rank up... wooo.
---
I don't know what this is, but I'm excited.
---
This is so dumb, I want it now.
---
I feel this is a pog and myers combo. Its not bad but being a myers main i dont see the reason to play him.
---
Well, that's step one done. Now we can skip for the reveal that he's a 110% speed killer with a stealth/disguise mechanic that doesn't help in chase.
---
They accidentally uploaded the dev build with this update.
---
Im talking to a dumbass who cant read apparently. I told you clearly that i would correct them so they would know in the future, not to be a dick. YOU get a grip.
---
I'd prefer it if his ability did more in chase, otherwise he is going to be compeatly crippled by sprint burst. Atleast michale has his faster vault and longer lunge.
---
They said the Xbox update will be ready in a couple days.
---
It says dev build up the top left corner, but it appears that the devs just pushed the wrong version to Steam.
---
Quenden pls
---
Mirror myers is the pinacle of Dbd. Perfectly balanced and easily countered if you just pay attention, but also adds a tremendous amount of fun and fear.
---
Apparently xbox won't get it "for a few days", according to a tweet sent out by BHVR. 
---
That sucks, I'm on xbox and this was the first mid-chapter patch that I've been actually excited for in a long time. Oh well.
---
Yeah then definitely, I’m chilling at around 11-12 at the moment... I guess I’ve got that to look forward to when I rank up I guess...
---
Yeah they said it may be a few days for Xbox
---
I told ya, ghostface is the licensed killer with more cosmetics available from the funworld costumes. I hope they get the scarecrow one, I wanted to have one of those in real life.
---
Now you can play as insidious Leatherface without having to stand still. What a world.
---
The outfit completely ruins if it for me. This looks like what Ghostface would be wearing if he appeared on Game of Thrones or something. Wtf.
---
Hahaha, oh noooo. I’m starting to think they might be doing this on purpose.
---
Which stream? BHVR Official? I assume there is a VOD. I saw the perk and power and I would like to know the source.
---
I mean to be Frank, it looks like you had to do it to ‘en
---
Ah gotcha. I see this all pretty much just happened, so I was skeptical at first haha
---
Yeah but you said he saw it because he’s a fog whisperer when it was just a wrong patch version.
---
Bill is the best survivor 
---
because Left 4 Dead was dope
---
Ghostface, but I haven't seen any proof of this so.... :/
---
This was stolen from r/SmashBrosUltimate
---
I'm about a week and a half into the game (even though I purchased it after release, just haven't gotten around to playing much). Is there any good Youtube channel or online guide with good tips on how to play both Killer and Survivor? Are there any really important basics that I should know?
---
I mean its great for tracking, but it does not help freddy in a chase, the survivors can still make him run around the map for a few generators.
---
ghostface skin was made by BHVR, it seems that they didint got the rights 100%
---
Hmm both perks were never that good tho unfortunely. Maybe they fix that in the future.
---
Legion pretty much seserved the changes. I just dislike what they did to pig and that you can walk out of the exit with this fucking trap =_=
---
I know it's not bannable, just shocked me how blatant some people can be to justify toxicity when they are bad at the game.
---
to bad we never got to see the map lol
---
Same way you signal entire Hawaii islands missiles are coming and you need to hide. Tho at this point I think these leaks are not really accidental, they just let the hype build.
---
Ghostface.
---
Someone in the main thread said it went live on PS4.
---
Its your lie in april uso to honto. Great anime as well. It will make you cry.
---
We get The Ghost next, he’s just mikey with the pigs crouch and corner cover...
---
the power seems really OP
---
So both Amanda and Legion are unusable. Great.
---
Waht the fuck?
---
The clown i understand because he was packaged with a major rework with them adding the store. But why the fuck does a mid chapter patch take a few days?
---
This is really not fucking ok.
---

Is this real, cause im hooked
---
the blue, red and main one I don't recognize, the other is this:

https://reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bls8ab/the_ghost_all_current_cosmetics_ability_perk/
---
Why did they give him an original outfit? Why not the outfit from the movie? The charm of the movie outfit was that it looked like a generic Halloween costume that anyone could buy, that's specifically why it was chosen. This medieval looking outfit misses the point, and is less cool
---
It’s been off a couple of years or so, but it’s being ‘rebooted’ for season 3 with new characters and a new story, with the aforementioned rumor above.  I found about this while I was digging into the leaks about ghostface possibly coming to this game a couple of weeks ago.
---
Holy shit, for real?
---
FOR REAL!!
---
Are those outfits from MTV Scream because I definitely do not recognize them from any of the 4 movies? Anyone watched that series to confirm or deny? 
---
If it’s MTV Scream that means we’re gonna get a random MTV survivor as opposed to a legend like Sydney. That would kinda suck.
---
Looks like Freddy what the fuck
---
very good point, i hadn't thought of that. solid job by them getting ahead of that
---
Well thats an odd combo.
---
Lmfao what the fuck is this
---
Is it a good show? I'm a fan of the movies and been considering the show.
---
Original Characters:
---
* Hag died in the real world before returning to life and single-handedly slaughtering a community of vicious cannibals. Sure, she made a bargain with the Entity's to do so, but even before that she survives having most of her flesh stripped off, numerous and very serious infections of said wounds, repeated torture, and not being fed for several weeks. She could take a knife to the gut.
---
* Spirit has already been sliced into literal pieces. I could be wrong, but I don't a knife to the gut would *phase* her.
---
* Clown's gut is so huge I don't think any amount of stabs there would something vital.
---
* Huntress killed multiple platoons of German soldiers, the toughest beasts nature could throw at her, and entire towns single-handedly. She's either so good at killing that she was able to do all of that without getting seriously injured or she's tough enough that she shrugged off any serious injuries she sustained during those conflicts. In either case, I think she's at least tough enough that she could take a knife to the gut and live to tell the tale.
---
Licensed Characters:
---
* Depending on the version, Michael ranges from extremely tough to literally immortal (in Halloween 6 he's powered by supernatural forces and has to kill people to avert the apocalypse... or something). He probably wouldn't even notice being stabbed in the gut.
---
* The remake Freddy is literally unkillable. He's had his throat sliced almost in half and returned just as strong as he had been before. According to his DBD lore, trapping him in the realm of the Entity was literally the only way for Quentin to 'defeat' him and save Nancy.
---
Nope, the perk only works when in a chase. So if you run it with Monitor and Abuse, it is counter productive.
---
Ash got leaked a few days before he got actually released!
---
Despite everything, I think Cote is fucking hilarious and i like that he does his best to make a bad situation funny. What a guy.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/YiT1vhc leather piggy
---
ooohhhh alright, thanks!
---
The majority of killers are their own creations though.
---
I guess this is BHVR's spin on Ghostface's design but I really hope they release Ghostface's Scream 1-4 costume maybe even the tv show version of the mask, and obviously the Scary Movie 1 Wazzup mask.
---
No gameplay.
---
I think they are overworked and it's showing.
---
His power doesn’t let him one shot survivors. There will likely be an ultra-rare addon that allows this though.
---
Can you interrupt hatch escape if the collapse hasn’t started?
---
As I understood, the ghostface will give only the stalked survivor the exposed effect, reverse to Myers.
---
its not the dedicated servers launch yet, you can still play!
---
had to remove someone beat ya to it sadly
---
I still main Trapper
---
Licensed killers getting cosmetics?? DBD is getting some awesome stuff it looks like.
---
The last guy did end up getting the hatch, but I didn't mind too much.
---
Now I wanna use Dead Hard + Lithe + Balanced Landing + Head On
---
With no good reason? Is "itd be too strong" not a "not good reason"?
---
Is it honestly just that hard to adapt?
---
Oof, I misread that. This perk now sounds a lot worse to me.
---
finally 😩😩😩 leaked killers are cool n all but Ive been waiting for licensed outfits 5ever so
---
woooooooooaaaaaaaaah whaaaaaaT!?
---
seems like a dev build was pushed out instead of the actual update for a little while.  He's not done but you can see what he looks like, and his power. Here's a [screenshot](https://twitter.com/The_Real_TMOTAH/status/1125795800494350343?s=09)
---
Legion can still vault windows and pallets though. And delay games with his passive.
---
If I had to guess I would say his stalking probably only makes the individual survivor you are stalking exposed whereas Myers can yeet anyone in EW3. Seems like that would be the trade for being slightly harder to spot (tall vs average height) and having slightly better chase/ stalk mechanics.
---
I was really hoping the Remember Me nerfs wouldn't go through... RIP.
---
Glad Coldwind is fixed now though.
---
Dude we cant use OP builds like that killers will dc!
---
Lol why NSFW the post but put the content in the title
---
Finished or not, they're clearly not going for the movie look. That's all anyone wanted. Anyone who's a fan of the movie at least. Not this weird Assassin's creed looking outfit.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/CaringBloodyBunnyTebowing
---
Because they get destroyed with anything else
---
I'm surprised that you found one of my works on Google Images, but yeah, the Jane drawing was done by me as you stated. Ever since Jane was released as a new survivor and watched some of her gameplay vids from Youtubers. It was nice to see a thick survivor into the game which made me draw her in the first place. People were surprised by the new character due to her butt was big, haha.
---
So yea, much appreciated and I'm glad that you like my stuff. That means a lot!
---
Finally another killer that can scare you
---
Exactly. That includes in the end game.
---
Any other Killer has real problems dealing with end game. Once the gates are open ANY hook rescue often ends in everyone walking out. Borrowed Time isn't like by Killers for this reason. But the Pig had a way to deal with that. One of the only Killers that could play around the end game and had some control over gameplay when the gates are open just got that taken away.
---
For what, that new version of end game? The thing that doesn't do crap but limits Survivor end game BM to 2 minutes instead of for how ever long they could get away with. Not worth it ion my opinion. It neuters the Pig for no reason at all when RBTs could have been changed to just not tick down in end game instead of just not working at all.
---
Leather Momma Pig &lt;3
---
This is why I play Legion. Definitely not because they're the only one I own.
---
"what do we say to the god of death?"  
---
"WAZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
---
I usually play claudette or kate and still seem to get obsession 80% of the time despite never running any obsession perks myself. My steam name starts with a b, I thought maybe I just get a slightly higher chance of becoming obsession because of that. Idk tho
---
Ok yes, i'm salty. 
---
But what in the flying fuck?
---
I understand an update being delayed like the clown release because it was packaged in with a major overhaul and the cosmetic store.
---
But how in the mother of flying fucking hell does a *mid chapter* update get delayed that long?
---
Like seriously what the hell, i'd prefer it if BHVR just openly admitted they hate us at this point.
---
Stridor, Predator and Bloodhound are good for her, in order to track the survs down wile you’re spirit walking.
---
Monto or No0b3 I would recommend for Spirit play.
---
Prayer Beads is a great addon
---
Imagine doing gens and you see a fella looking around the corner... DBD Will get scary again soon
---
The devil one is like those cheap Halloween masks that are variations on ghost face. Probably the same price too. Maybe we’ll get gold and silver, and one with a hand pump and tune to make blood flow on the mask.
---
I was really hoping for the freddy rework.
---
I forgot his twitter name but if you watch [this](https://youtu.be/FPM4uwPx0ow) you’ll find out more about that person.
---
We know
---
He is a ghostbeater!
---
An awful lotta killer nerfs this patch...
---
I’m not saying that some aren’t justified, but it feels like in exchange for having a limited way to fight back against survivors that take the game hostage the killers had to give up a decent amount of utility.
---
Why should I stalk with Myers during EW 3? Why there is an add-on that prevents me from doing that?
---
Yeah I love playing as Jane purely because of how big she is.  Wasn't a fan of any of the female characters in the game until Kate, but Jane immediately took her place for me!
---
I googled "Jane Romero fan art" and this piece was literally the second image that came up!
---
Much appreciated
---
Damn, legion got buffed straight into a new franchise
---
Yeah it’s sad that they made legion useless, he needed a rework, not this bullshit
---
It should say "Join Group" on the right hand side if you aren't already in it
---
Great - goodbye my moneyyy
---
So is face-camping, I guess
---
I think the Devs in general don't want any killer wearing straight black, so the survivors can see them coming. Especially this killer, who is stalk / stealth based. If he was wearing all black he could easily crouch beside a gen in the corner, and people might not even see him
---
Not defending it though, I still think he should wear all black. This is probably the reason they're going to give though
---
The point of freddy is not to chase, its to sleep people and then ambush them when they are in a bad position, what this does is give him the mindgame potential that paint brush gives him without the slowdown.
---
Microsoft has a different way of publishing updates for games, this is out of control for BHVR.
---
I was of the impression that unless you use a specific add-on, blood pools don't show while phasing?
---
Same here, I saw it happen yesterday. Glad it's, potentially, been fixed.
---
Makes me wonder the devs are behind all these leaks to increase hype.
---
What happened?
---
OP is about 30 minutes late
---
big oop.
---
Wondering if people would notice the Shaggy look alike hahaha
---
Wait so Myers bled green because he was injected with acid? I’ll be honest I try not to remember that movie, since it was so horrible.
---
Also, I don't use ruin, but I think it's perfectly reasonable.
---
Myers is more general use. When he hits T3, everyone is an instant down. He also doesn't have to toggle his stealth. Obviously we don't know Ghost's add-ons, but I doubt they'll be on the same level as Myers as well.
---
Honestly, if anything I feel like Ghost will be weak. If a survivor is in danger, they'll know it since they're Exposed. If he can't end the chase quickly (especially if the survivor pops SB as soon as they get exposed), it's back to square one with him when Exposed wears off. In addition, because he builds up for Exposed, breaking off a chase is not necessarily a good idea when it otherwise would be.
---
We don't know if the progress per survivor decays, drains if he stalks another survivor, etc, so there is that. Maybe he can get everyone to near max, then just one tap everyone similar to popping T3 with Myers, but even then he's just a worse Myers because he has to do it for each person individually.
---
Literally just sort by new and you will see 50 of them.
---
who is she
---
"maybe so, maybe not, oh hey look new cosmetics!"
---
Nahh, MTV scream doesn't even have the rights to use the mask, they made they're own mask, and I think that version of ghostface just wears a black hooded poncho
---
i just hope we get the classic costume as well.
---
only when you hook the obsession you get tokens!
---
Raging
---
You forgot to mark this as spoiler.
---
Oh did they? Nice!
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
Yep. Everyone says killer is the harder role, but solo survivor is hardest.
---
It's too bad she still got nerfed into the ground. No compensation whatsoever for making her traps unusable during EGC.
---
At least play them before you are proven wrong.
---
Then he will not be in a chase and his terror radius will be normal sized
---
This seems really fake he is basically a better myers i dont think the devs would do that
---
Sure, but you know what, i'm TIRED of being the one who has to be patient. This was a mid chapter release not a major content update, it wouldn't of killed them to wait a few extra days for the xbox one to go through and then release it on other platforms.
---
And no oneshotting.
---
That sucks. 😐
---
Ghostface in DBD: *I sleep*
---
Piggy cosmetics: ***REAL SHIT***
---
Was it though? If they don't push the wrong update then everyone has it today.
---
Myers 2.0
---
Well look on the bright side, at least there is going to be an abundance of Frank's Mixtape in the Xbox two day forecast.  Oh wait.  FML.
---
Nah, i'm tired of having to be patient because Devs can't bug check and make sure their work is competent enough to pass a verification system.
---
Time to get spine chill!
---
I’m not impressed with the Design and the only aspect of the power I like is peeking from behind cover to stalk. I’m not so impressed, but I’m hoping that the end product is good at least.
---
Takes a few seconds for chase to drop, you can mix in monitor for a constant 8m smaller terror radius.
---
Ummno clearly BHVR is just trying to kill off their console playerbase for no reason you dum dum, uninstall 
---
/s
---
they confirmed it on their twitter.
---
According to morf\_uk (a fog whisperer), there is no Survivor coming with this chapter.
---
Yep, i'm quite pissed off and as i predicted to myself all the pc and ps4 players are replying with "just be patient"
---
Real nibbas play halo reach and go through the deaths like a man
---
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD I THINK I MIGHT ACTUALLY FAINT
---
Game stinks on Xbox so I'm not surprised.
---
Still finding it funny that the game looks like a potato but the frame rate on Xbox allows things like Ruin to be more powerful than on PC.
---
Since the bug was incredibly random and unpredictable, we were not able to reproduce it internally. We can't quite "fix" it until we are able to reproduce it. We've added some extra checks to make sure it doesn't happen in the first place and we're going to be keeping an eye out just in case.
---
I just saw everyone talking about Ghostface then this glorious sight came into view
---
That would be a solid reason if he didn't have a super white face (and also survivors can wear all black). It does sound like it may be the case, though.
---
WHOOPSIE
---
I already knew this would be in here haha. Nice try tho
---
And his name is [John Cena!](https://youtu.be/Uufq_PFXbpA)
---
While looking for the meme I found this, where he fights Ghostface. https://youtu.be/HWN3XxHnu6U
---
I'm really digging the red devil ghostface.
---
Yeah, the outfit doesn't really match the mask and head... I would've rather preferred something more spooky tbh
---
It's up to them, really. I'd take a huge QoL update, even if it takes months, over a brand new chapter each three months.
---
As for the overwork, I don't know. For a serious company, a leak can only happen once. Not twice. And not only two months apart!
---
Oh ok I see, that’s good to hear. I guess those cosmetics are just original then because I really don’t remember them being from any of the movies. Fingers crossed for Sydney now, I’d be OK with Gale but Sydney is a horror legend.
---
Thank you!
---
I'm not really mad that they didn't make other people wait. What makes me mad is that this was preventable. BHVR screwed up by releasing the wrong build of the game.
---
Isn't the ghostface mask and character owned by different companies? 
---
It's possible they're making an OC killer with the Ghostface mask, which may also explain why there isn't a new survivor found yet.
---
Is this legit? Did they really fuck up like this again? Surely not... right?
---
Well, I know one Pig main here who would be filled with joy.
---
I'm having trouble reading his power, can someone help?
---
True, but the thing is he is wearing all black, not the darkest shade of black, but his default outfit is black, or dark grey I guess. If that's the issue, they didn't have to change his outfit. It could have been the movie outfit with that lighter shade of black
---
I’m always busy on weekends so I don’t really get much out of bloodhunts.
---
Spirit is a mind game killer, you need to out play survivors, to be in their heads all the time. As Spirit, you should never be predictable, not just phasing straight at them and not just do the still standing mind game. Alternate these 2 things, so you will confusing the crap out of survivors. Teacking is very important with her, out side of scratch marks, you can track survivors by sounds, grass, crows and collision. You still have collision with survivors while phasing, use that to determine where survivors are. Also, survivors can't see you while you are vaulting a window, use that for out playing them at the shavk and window loops. Once mastered, you will never get looped with her.
---
Many perks work with her, like tracking perks ( BBQ, A Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker, Rancor, Surveillance and Discordance ), stall perks ( Hex:Ruin, Sloppy Butcher ) and instant down perks ( Hex:Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice ). You should avoid anti loop perks like Enduring, Spirit Fury or Bamboozle, because you should never get looped with her in the first place.
---
As add-ons, charge time + speed makes your power better in chases, while cooldown + speed makes your power better for map pressure. Duration add-ons are useless in my opinion, you should avoid them. Most of the time you should use just brown or yellow add-ons on her, so you don't become dependent on her green or purple add-ons.
---
Some add-ons combo I like : 
---
Zori + Muddy Sports Day Cap 
---
Gifted Bamboo Comb + White Hair Ribbon 
---
Muddy Sports Day Cap + White Hair Ribbon 
---
Bloody Hair Brooch + Dirty Uwabaki 
---
Yakuyoke Amulet + Rusty Flute 
---
Bloody Hair Brooch + Wakizashi Saya 
---
Mother Daughter Ring + Bloody Hair Brooch 
---
Mother Daughter Ring + Yakuyoke Amulet.
---
And please don't use Prayer Beads, that add-on is broken, you will get hate for it 😁.
---
Just sort by new and you will find a lot of post of the new killer/abilities/customization options.
---
Oh trust me I know, but still though
---
The first 2 seasons of the MTV show did not have the rights to use the Ghostface name or mask. Instead they created their own design. 
---
The upcoming season 3 which will be a soft reboot has the rights for the mask and name this time.
---
Is this real?
---
I'm with you, considering the poor state of the game atm. They're heading in the right direction but god, I'd very much prefer a focus on the numerous bugs and broken hitboxes than a brand new chapter every three months.
---
Give me any reason why this change was better than making the EGC timer go slower when an RBT was on?
---
I really hope they do this some day though.
---
At this point it has to be on purpose.
---
I get why pig had to be changed, her power as it stands right now wasn't really compatible with the new endgame, but even so I would have liked it if they somehow maintained endgame pig as an option. Without that, the traps are pretty low threat. Unless you use some high rarity addons getting a head pop is super rare and without preventing people from leaving through the gate the utility of them has been halved. Understandable change, but I still don't like it.
---
You can. Originally when the PTB launched, you could not, but this was later reverted.
---
Sore loser and a-hole is how I'd describe it.
---
He was already weak when I started playing last year....and nothing has changed ever since.
---
Hello darkness my old friend..
---
Yes pleasse. Pretty Lady mask and costume and we need the remake mask and costume too. Plssss.
---
Poor guy just accepted fate there.
---
honestly, i feel like his power basically makes pig irrelevant. with RBT's being nerfed, why play her when you can get one shot downs while crouching with ghostface?
---
Just buy a PS4/PC 4Head
---
Dedicated servers are not out. The test we had on the PTB was just to test infrastructure. There's still a long way to go before they go to the live build.
---
I would bet on Deputy Dewey
---
Yeah probably just the rights to the mask
---
For as for I know they are called the Shape, The Cannibal and the Nightmare, so either give them all there real name or just fuck off and get your facts straight.
---
Ghostface is the copy-cat horror killer, so I guess it kinda makes sense he would watch a few movies and take a few notes?  
---
Tbh I'm disappointed too, but it does kinda make sense in my mind.
---
honestly i like it. Beats most peoples Fan Concepts that always includes giving survivors cell phones
---
Again, the Freddy rework is nothing *like* the Legion rework. So forming an opinion on something that isn't out yet, based on something that isn't anything like it, makes it very hard for me to take you seriously.
---
So why would BHVR call this a peak at the next chapter and not the next paragraph?
---
Would definately buy this for my Piggy.
---
I hope this means other licensed characters will be getting cosmetics too. 
---
Please give my Quentin new stuff. Pleeeaaassseeee.
---
You seem to want to pursue this, so please for the love of god make a point, what facts have I said that are incorrect?
---
2019 the year of the leaks
---
Actually I saw in a different thread he has an add on or perk that causes exposed effect from stalking
---
I would love a speedo Quentin
---
Sure more baseless accusations without any context. Your mother though.
---
his power doesn't help in chases, meh
---
Ok, I get what you're saying but how am I supposed to play with my buddy i just convinced to buy the game or my friend that gets on once in awhile. Am I supposed to say sorry im rank 4 can't play with you you're not good enough? There's no casual mode. So leaving it unrestricted is IMO the only way to go about it rn. Will there be ways to abuse the system? Of course, but restricting my ability to play with my friends who suck at the game is not the way to do it.
---
Except that isn’t a chapter- that’s a paragraph, just like Left Behind and Leathface. This is the devs straight up saying Ghostface is gonna be a chapter.
---
Correct, he hasn't. Other than the leather jacket from the opening scene of Scream 2, he's never worn anything this form-fitting, it was always the sparkly robe.
---
One of the perks was a token system on unhooks for an obsession.
---
Each token, up to 4 tokens, reduces your terror radius by 4 while in a chase. 
---
Once the obsession dies, you lose all tokens. 
---
Called like "The Simplest Method" or something.
---
Legit rewatched this video last night. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ma8FDWXHIsM
---
OINK?!
---
Mc of microsoft
---
Not a chapter.
---
Ash Vs Evil Dead is not considered a chapter.
---
Please tell me this is real... this can't be that immensely edited?
---
The obsession changes to whoever unhooked the current obsession.
---
WutFace, he got leaked like a couple of weeks prior to his release
---
If you’re playing survivor it’s going to take double the time. I play killer and get 40,000 points to 60,000 it’s quicker
---
Gale weathers in the game would hint that MONICA GELLER IS IN THE GAME OMG MY NEW MAIN BYE KATE
---
I mean, yeah. It's an awful tactic and you could lose up to 3 gens, but it is a tactic.
---
The person who rescues the obsession becomes the new obsession.
---
It is infamous for being completed, they just don't know how to split it into 3 parts, but considering its been so long and it hasn't come out it could have never been completed.
---
aww wraith and myers finally had their baby. so happy for them :)
---
Wow this is crazy how they get it thought it was licensed???
---
&gt; Sure more baseless accusations without any context. 
---
This thread is the context. Keep reaching
---
Because the rescuer becomes the obsession, so now you'll need to hook someone else.
---
For the Pig, the change was unnecessary. The Pig works best when she's not chasing someone with a trap in the first place. As a result, what usually ended up happening was that your traps paused whenever you happened to brush by someone in a different chase. Ultimately you could crouch to hide your terror radius as well and complete negate the change. The only real upside here was that you could use this as a built in Whispers of sorts to find nearby Survivors, but it's not worth the downsides.
---
For the Legion, on the other hand, this change prevents you from moonwalking after someone and abusing the chase mechanics to get an easy down. It's a very necessary change for the Legion and there's no way for you to hide your terror radius. Now, you need to actually work for the kill.
---
She's fat
---
Now that's what Im talking about! Licensed killers finally getting some love! 
---
Let's hope for shirtless Myers next lol
---
It's unfinished.
---
Is the survivor going to be Syndey? Will she have a phone as a perk?
---
**WAZZZAAAAAP!**
---
What’s her full list of new cosmetics? I hope she gets something to turn her into Jigsaw himself.
---
I just need the original costume he wears.
---
FREAKING OINK MATE
---
Correct. If the Survivor gets there first, they can jump in. If the Killer gets there first, they can close the hatch. Whoever gets their first wins that scenario.
---
You know controllers have buttons that can be tied down with rubber bands. Also, they probably weren't AFK in the first place. Just wants BPs
---
When you fuck up again while acknowledging the first fuck up.
---
Probably BHVR’s deal with Lionsgate
---
oh god noo. downvote this to hell. wtf is that photo. i feel very distressed
---
GALE WEATHERS
---
I kinda want drag queen leatherface from the 4th movie. RuPaul is shaking.
---
You said I was wrong for calling Amanda Young bye her name instead of the in game name Pig, but everyother killer is spoken about in game by their real name instead of their in game name. So why can I not do it for Amanda?
---
[I'm glad I nabbed all the delicious details before they disconnected everyone.](https://i.imgur.com/8Ek6SR4.png)
---
Yes that could have been this, but it could have also been Ash, we don't know anything and it was an internal dev build we weren't meant to see so I'll still temper my expectations. The Ghost power could also just be one of several iterations and that one is just the one we happened to see.

HELL YEAH BOY.
---
They coulda just said ‘upcoming content’ and left it ambiguous. But no lol
---
u right, it's not
---
Not necessarily, if you're the last survivor then the hatch spawns as normal, so as long as the doors remain closed the EGC doesn't start. If the killer opens the doors, they can't then grab you off the hatch, but if you and the killer are in a standoff and the doors are closed, then you can still be grabbed.
---
It's to encourage someone actually attempting to escape, or initiate the endgame instead of just standing around waiting to see who blinks first.
---
I can't wait to play after work, well done on the patch.
---
Bit late
---
You might be thinking of Dewey, because Randy was killed in the second movie.
---
I’ve seen some of it- clothing inspired by her first appearance in Saw Chapter 1. Anything that turns her into Jigsaw himself? That’d be badass.
---
And this had better open the door to Michael getting stuff.
---
I actually really like rancor+stbfl, they work really well together and they are more fun than the meta perks imo. Stbfl is a great perk but rancor although good, not on the same level as the others, but still pretty fun.
---
Pig could abuse the chase mechanics as well. Deep Wounds were never an 'easy down' lmao. You gave no real justification for making Legion's power essentially useless, especially since his terror radius is now bigger and mending is extremely fast. He's a shitty M1 killer now, full stop.
---
yeah idg, the point is that they wear a cheap Halloween costume. Is it related to the TV show version or something?
---
I won’t lie, I just started playing this game about 4 months ago and I was eager to be in the red ranks. Not even worth it lol have had better team mates at level 13 and so
---
Ghost Face, Pig and Myers are tied to the same license company and if they got the rights to GF it’s not hard to believe they got the rights for new killer cosmetics too.
---
They do now, the upcoming (shitty reboot) third season is using the mask and voice if it ever comes out
---
Guessing the changes will get reverted in either the next patch or the next mid-chapter patch. BHVR adores ignoring both feedback and PTB testing then turning around and pretending there's no way they possibly could have known their idea was bad before reverting it.
---
Lately the main focus of each patch has been picking up the pieces of the previous one.
---
Okay.
---
Just imagine if they pull an operation health (rainbow 6 siege) thing on this game, people would go crazy without a new survivor/killer/map for a whole 4-6 months.
---
True thank you
---
Oof 2 whole seconds
---
[Her outfit from the RBT scene in Saw 1.](http://images2.fanpop.com/image/polls/395000/395711_1268378340055_full.jpg)
---
Eh. Behavior is pretty inconsistent with their wording, I wouldn't bet on anything they write. At the same time, it is very possible that they just didn't have the survivor ready at the time they showed the killer to the fog whisperers, sooo yeah, expecting one or the other is just a coinflip right now
---
the pack was made for personal use. if you have no patience, you don't deserve to use my work that i spent time on when i already have a bunch of stuff to do.
---
Medieval Ghostface? DEUS VULT MEMES INTENSIFIES!
---
Frame rate is fine for me on Xbox one X
---
Removed as someone already posted this
---
I hope so. This at least shows that Ash’s cosmetics sold well enough for them to do it again, so hopefully they’ll talk with Universal (since they own H2018 and that’s probably what most people want).
---
I mean this is another perk to encourage going for others. Keep in mind whoever unhooks the obsession becomes the new obsession, that with any possible DS's in the match will move the obsession around a lot then. Would be easy to get all the tokens, keep in mind the values could be bigger too in the final level 3 version.
---
We don't know what Ghostface's default terror radius will be but it can help on other small TR killers such as Michael, sounds like it will compliment scratched mirror myers well to retain his 0m TR even while in chase with Monitor. Can't underestimate Hag or stealth doc either among a few others.
---
What about ps4?
---
where did you get that picture?
---
And after I just fucking P3-ed her for her bloody skin because I thought licensed killers were never getting cosmetics.  Fuck me and fuck the bullshit prestige system making me waste all of those goddamn bloodpoints.
---
And we’ve only seen one killer perk. There’s plenty we haven’t seen yet.
---
DUUUUUDE I’M NEVER PLAYING ANOTHER KILLER AGAIN, BEEN TAKING A BREAK FROM THE GAME AFTER BEING SALTY ABOUT LEGION CHANGES BUT I CAN’T BELIEVE GHOSTFACE IS FINALLY COMING
---
How are they tieing down the buttons if the attack button has to be pressed not held to attack?
---
it'll work most times, because survivors these days are god awful
---
agree so much. wtf have they done??? it's a scandal.
---
It's all over reddit, theirs another one too along with Ghost Face
---
You can't play in the dev build anyway. So you would have just crashed or frozen.
---
Oh wow that’s cool. I honestly thought this was fake and fanmade lol
---
Dude it last just a game go out for a walk and live life dame
---
Shrouded Hunt and Stalk
---
The Ghost can move stealthily, crouch, lean around corners and stalk survivors.
---
His primary power is Shrouded Hunt during which The Ghost has no terror radius.
---
His secondary power is Stalk: The Ghost can stalk individual survivors to give exposed status for a limited time.
---
The Ghost also has the ability to crouch freely and lean around corners while stalking.
---
Oh my god yesss
---
I'm actually crying rn I haven't been this happy in such a long time
---
Really really hope so!
---
We need Old Man Michael. Desperately.
---
Michael Myers is an Iconic name known by his real name, same with freddy and jason. Amanda isn't as Iconic. The real thing I disagree with is you telling people what they have to call her, you can call her whatever you want but it just seems strange to demand people call her amanda.
---
And also when someone unhooks, the rescuer becomes the new obsession. If the obsession dies you lose all tokens.
---
*sad eh*
---
Well.. i did, so.
---
It's an alt cosmetic. He has an all black one.
---
No problem, mate.
---
Agreed or maybe... shirtless Myers
---
Yup. What’s that got to do with killer bias? That shit was broken and needed to be fixed. No bias there, just balance.
---
I have evolved! The moment I smell the killer I DC
---
BUBBA'S FREAKIN' OUT, MAN
---
My dick is now rock hard. Sloppy of them to leak ash and ghostface but this is fucking exciting.
---
thank you my fellow pig
---
Just cheap marketing
---
Michael Myers but a baby.
---
Pig Cosmetics
---
How are you level one but rank thirteen at the same time ?
---
There's a few people in this thread asking about the outfit &amp; I'm wondering whether BHVR got the same deal as Fright Rags. 
---
When FR released their Ghostface collection they issued a blog post with this disclaimer at the bottom:
---
"*While featured in the film Scream, GhostFace is under separate ownership than the film franchise. We have licensed the rights to the property Ghost Face which these are not called Scream shirts.*"
---
[Source](https://www.fright-rags.com/blogs/news/ghostface-t-shirt-collection)
---
So maybe no Sidney &amp; no Woodsboro? :(
---
KEEP IT TOGETHER CHILI BOY
---
yes, they can announce it as many times as they want, but bugs that came with the CLOWN update still exist, so go ahead announce that theyre fixing it, but actually do it aswell so people will stop screaming :)
---
\*Happy Oink\*
---
Makes sense since we just got Ash. I know it's two separate DLCs and two separate franchises. Was kind of hoping a scream queen like Kirby would appear.
---
I can't really blame M1 killers for running noed since MoM was released.
---
Member when everyone said that they wouldn't add Ghostface cuz we have Legion? I member.
---
was that leaked/confirmed too? Otherwise that could literally just be a placeholder as those are the default values of standard TR and standard MS. Just like how his Power picture is just Michael's.
---
that hair is a serve tbh
---
What is the meta right now? I don’t follow guidelines or anything I just play the pig lady cause I liked the saw movies
---
So wait, Ghost Face isn't even a part of it?
---
I know for the first paragraph.
---
The "fixes under way" is always the golden excuse for them, it seems. Also, wasn't the Freddy rework supposed to come with this patch?
---
Do you have a source?
---
I'd like to see these if you can put them in a video.
---
Devs are pretty inconsistent with the wording I guess. But we are in prime time for a new chapter, especially with anniversary around the corner. I’m willing to bet we’re getting a full chapter.
---
Nah man, you shouldn't use them except to stop or punish generator progress near the end. If you use them early in the game, you effectively neuter yourself.
---
Wait, really? I thought "Franchise killers" and survivors don't really get cosmetics.
---
Knives bend against the Huntress' rock hard abs
---
To avoid assholes from tunnelling a guy at the end. He'd have no way to get the trap off then die
---
My prediction is the community is gonna despise ghostface. Only having one person exposed encourages tunneling that person, which I know how much the community hates tunneling. 
---
However, he hasn’t even been announced officially so I’m going to hold my judgement. Simply reading the power’s description isn’t enough to form a full opinion, so yeah I’m going to hold off judgement. Hyped as shit though.
---
Survivor.  
---
If a (really) good SWF group plays sweaty, only Nurse has a chance of beating them.
---
Monto has good build videos
---
max decrease in chase with simple formula is 16m, monitor increase in chase is 8m = 8m smaller terror in chase.
---
Monitor decrease out of chase is 8m.
---
Overall this perk gives a constant -8m terror radius.
---
Doesn't seem that bad to me. Time will tell though.
---
I don't think BHVR are smart enough to make this kind of marketing stunt. Particulary when you see how the game is working these days.
---
That is blatantly false
---
Both is favourable, for example, killers have abilities that help them with their job, and survivors have strength in numbers and voice coms etc
---
Idk I played Legion &amp; got a 4k on my first match after the changes.
---
Not during the first 2 seasons. But, as someone else said, they’re rebooting the series with a new cast and apparently they plan on using the ghost face mask with the reboot so whenever that finally airs I guess it’ll happen
---
Why put a spoiler tag if you litterally put the spoiler in the title? 😂
---
Because in current patch now, it would be a problem to play against. Before. You could get the hatch and escape. Now the pig can close hatch and chase you around, meaning you would either die to her, the trap, or the egc. There would be no chance for escape. What dont you get about that?
---
Because you've made YOUR problem everyone elses. Sure its fine I don't care what you prefer to call her, but do the same for everyone else.
---
Exactly, if I play freddy at rank 3 I'm getting shit on.
---
That's very selfish of you to want other people to suffer because Xbox has to wait a couple more days. You clearly deserve all the bad karma coming to you.
---
So annoying when this happens on the Pig Tree
---
My theory is it was intentional. Think about it. With Ash the fucking publicity and hype there was for him was insane. So maybe Ash wasn't leaked intentionally and Ghostface was. I just think it could be really clever marketing. Maybe even both leaks were intentional.
---

---
Maybe a way to tell other survivors in lobby what perks you're running?
---
For some reason I feel you haven't watched the movies very closely.
---
I’m convinced that BHVR is run by a bunch of sentient soggy grapes at this point.
---
I think he is more to "scary" than "strongy" if you know what I mean, imagine seeing someone peeking into you from a corner.
---
Ugh yes Pretty Lady Bubba is 100% mandatory, probably the only cosmetic I'd ever buy (although this pig one is tempting...)
---
Based on what his power says, he looks like a direct upgrade of Michael.
---
*Current Objective:* ***Survive***
---
Two very different teams, dude. It may be hard to track the bugs too without a proper reporting system and dedicated servers.
---
To be fair I edited it right after I posted [that comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bls0sz/looks_like_devs_accidentally_leaked_ghostface_for/emr11jy/).
---
Interesting? Sure. Probably wouldn't be much fun though.
---
At this point, the playerbase has shown the Devs the style of play that they fall into in this game. Introducing mechanics that punish them for that playstyle won't be received well.
---
The one with the red crop top is what Amanda wears in the first film when she’s one of the victims.
---
He can lean around corners...welcome to the land of Peekaboo Ghost memes
---
Yep, this is just a way for people to get hyped.
---
I mean do we know what a 0 TR does in chase because as of now it is physically impossible to get 0 TR during a chase. Even T1 Myers has 6m by default and 8m during a chase with M&amp;A. The closest things to it would be Tinkerer and Dark devotion and they do trip up survivors all the time.
---
My guess is it would help in sneaking up on other people who you run by while chasing another. I'm not claiming it to be part of the new meta, but I can see some utility happen.
---
Blame Microsoft dude. Getting mad at BHVR for this is totally not even in their jurisdiction.
---
Is there anything for Detective Tapp?
---
me
---
Link please?
---
I feel like killer does but not from like a power perspective but like choice. All survivors can really do is react. The killer can choose to play "normally" or camp, tunnel, whatever. So if you're the survivor and the killer decides to tunnel you well too bad if you wanted to do any other objective. You better hope you're good at running away cause that's all you'll be doing.
---
If you're being camped on the hook you have 0 choice but to sit and do nothing. 
---
The killer though can do whatever.
---
Yes, but they should add his original clothes first.
---
Behavior said it’s a chapter and not a paragraph, so I’m sure the survivor wasn’t in the leak.
---
#OwO
---
Dbd twitter said people got a view of the upcoming CHAPTER so I think it's safe to assume theres a map and survivor too
---
Swoon.
---
I’m not sure, this isn’t my picture. But if a Tapp cosmetic pops up I will post it as soon as possible!
---
BHVR I will pay you very big dollars for Quentin outfits
---
Survivors should also have hatch open on map forever so they can jump out anytime if lucky enough to find it
---
When I realized it was actually leaked I LMAOed so much.
---
Well in that case maybe I'll wait. From how you describe it it sounds like the first 2 seasons are related in name only which doesn't do it for me.
---
couldn't find it before but ive found it now
---
Where my Trap Lovers at? 
---
Wait...
---
It’s not a chapter if there’s no survivor
---
Pretty much
---
That's why I loved him, too. But why do you feel like that is gone with him coming to the game? I don't feel like that could ever be taken away.
---
And that's so awesome that you met him! I wouldn't be able to speak. I've met Matthew Lillard and Skeet Ulrich, that sure applied with them. Matthew embraced me and after talked to me for a good 25 minutes about how I shouldn't be afraid about being judged by other people and to do the things I want to in life. It was surreal. In a way though, it kind of ruined Ghostface for me..haha. Well, not ruined but I can't think of a better word atm. I hope one day I get to meet Roger too, though. You lucky son of a gun.
---
Suffer? No one even knew for sure the update was being released today. If they had waited and saw "oh the xbox update got rejected, let's hold of on releasing it elsewhere until we know why" then no one at all would be complaining because no one would know.
---
It's perfectly find for it to be delayed for one but whenever the possibility of it being delayed for all comes up it's suddenly so unfair.
---
Based on the boobs it's still Amanda herself but it's possible she's wearing Hoffman's clothes?
---
I would assume that the stairs are not wider because the note specifically indicates that the character collision has been changed.
---
if you look on r/leaksbydaylight you'll see an icon that looks like a grad hat, could be an offering for a school map.
---
What
---
Alright cool. Thanks for the info!
---
we better get the town, warehouse or something from one of the movies as the map. I hope they really make a cool ass map for this killer... So many possibilities lets see if they can capitalize .
---
Oh hell yes
---
Don't you mean amanda?
---
It's so spot on
---
No idea. Just going by the power description.
---
That would honestly be super useless. Unless said locker killer had some kind of way of knowing when a survivor was near a locker (like hag traps). Since most survivors besides rank 20s don't bother with lockers
---
Who isnt a fan of the classics?
---
No, it was not supposed to come with this patch. 
---
That was rumors from certain streamers, Youtubers and a few people here on Reddit.
---
But no where did BHVR actually say that Freddy rework would come for this patch.
---
This patch was End Game Collapse and Legion nerf there was the focus.
---
If the Endgame Collapse triggers, NOED will activate regardless of any other factors.  I look forward seeing how players utilize this new functionality.
---
Source: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/58159/dead-by-daylight-endgame-collapse
---
WILL PERKS LIKE NO ONE ESCAPES DEATH STILL ACTIVATE IF THE END GAME COLLAPSE IS TRIGGERED EARLY?
---
Yes, these perks will still activate regardless of when the End Game Collapse is triggered.
---

---
Yeah, somewhere on the front page I believe there's atleast one of them
---
&gt;brang
---
since he's a copycat killer instead of giving him the same abilities has other killers he could copycat a Random Survivor Ability that he's stalking and he gets that perk for like A Minute or something
---
New F words that's who
---
Ya know. Chillin....killin....
---
It was Ru!!! RuPaul!!!
---
Nope cant hear him at all either.. how do we let them know its messed up?
---
Anyone that has the Killer DC bug where people will randomly drop out of your games for no reason know if its fixed or not?
---
I can't play killer anymore cause of this and I'm hoping its fixed.
---
#OINK
---
I kNoW iTs bRuNg
---
Unless the leak was intentional. It's not exactly new for developers to intentionally leak shit for hype.
---
Super scared of the lean though. It's gonna be like that meme of Docky Shocky popping his head out of the basement, but so much worse
---
Sad oink.
---
I'm okay with it because the timer went from 3 minutes to 2 minutes for egc, but I would like if the timer went back to 3 minutes and egc started when the last gen popped
---
Damn thanks for informing me!
---
Yeah it should be good in practice. Myers always has to be standing in plain view, but it looks like Ghostface can lean and crouch to expose survivors giving him a better chance.
---
Its good that they made it harder
---
if u was rank 1 at last system and now ur stuck at purple ranks that means something
---
OINK!
---
He still have the right outfit on all the shirts.
---
That’s on periodt 💅🏼
---
We have always gotten a survivor with a killer for the Chapters. Only paragraphs get just one character. The survivor wasnt in the build they pushed out.
---
Your family is a bunch of horny tentacles, literally. Lol
---
What are the killer perks I need to avoid because they suck?
---
How can he confirm that? The chapter isnt out and what was in the oops update wasnt even complete. A new survivor is guaranteed
---
Maybe you should learn how to play freddy instead if complainning about killers being too hard.
---
Yassss
---
Zappy Boi is my waifu
---
Yep!
---
Legion my main. He will be now.
---
I don't know why everyone keeps saying it was for head shots. Wasn't it just a KYF bug or some shit?
---
Yes, I even tho he will be a low tier killer (probably like bubba) I will buy him Just to scare people
---
To be fair, imagine faking people into thinking you've left by just turning around so they can't see the red stain, and then just...you know...waiting. Some survivors are gonna get a false sense of security, like Mirror Myers, and that's another free hit. Combine that with Monitor and Abuse on Myers, and no matter what, Myers will have like...no terror radius.
---
Literally an upgraded Myers
---
@TheWorldOfRSB 
---
This is his Twitter
---
So... do we know the other perks?
---
Yesss I love scream!
---
seconding OhTofu's review videos; he can get a little *too* in-depth sometimes, but he's a really cool dude and obviously cares a lot about mechanics and such. he also streams on Twitch and i've picked up a couple of things just by lurking! he's really good at explaining survivor chase mechanics to me, my chase abilities have gotten much better since i started actually paying attention.
---
Already live. Enjoy the camping :)
---
Just Googled it and that is truly terrifying.
---
Anyone else just see Feng Min?
---
Looks like an Assassins Creed costume... That devil costume gives me hope though
---
The Huntress headshot wasn't a thing.  
---
It was a glitch due to dedicated servers, I believe. You could've downed anyone with a single hit to their feet and it would still have the same effect.
---
Wait, so is endgame collapse out now?
---
imagine actually being triggered over sarcasm in 2019
---
But no Survivor was revealed so saying no is doing damage control on their behalf.
---
He Will be a really scary low tier killer
---
It’s fine. Just didn’t show up for me. Maybe it’s a mobile thing.
---
I said the same thing. I’m hoping this outfit is a placeholder.
---
That is probably gonna change with time, since the ability does have the Myers face and seems very basic, but still super awesome.
---
Funny story about Ru Paul's Drag Race: whenever Sharon Needles was on that show I was on the phone with my friend in front of my mom saying "yeah Sharon Needles is the best. I love Sharon Needles." And my mom was looking at me like "what the fuck?" And I, somehow not grasping the obvious name at that time, was like "..what?"
---
Is no mither used only for the meme or does it do something with healing oters?
---
Bedsheet Ghost Myers would be an insta-buy for me.
---
yeah, it genuinely feels like it either takes one try to escape a trap or, like, 20. it's kind of ridiculous. idk what would be a fair way to balance that, though - maybe keep it slightly luck based, with it taking between 1 and *x* number of tries to escape, with trap add-ons increasing that number?
---
This pleases the nut.
---
Thank *GOD* there are no cellphones! That was one is the dumbest ideas the community has come up with
---
It does.
---
"His secondary power is Stalk"
---
So, apparently the rights to the mask are owned by an actual costume supplier, and not the film rights holders.  To license the ‘Scream’ character license you would have to go through the film rights holders, and to license the actual ghostface mask, you would need to go through the mask making supplier.  Two separate deals to get both properties.
---
Doesn't have to be singleplayer.. You could play other multiplayer games!
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Play some games and you'll find out real quick by yourself.
---
But even all black it still sucks. Why wouldn’t he just wear what he does in the movie? It doesn’t even feel like Ghostface to me wearing this. It’s like if they gave Myers a suit of armor or something dumb like that, it wouldn’t be the same.
---
Does the strike through not show up on mobile? I crossed out the old stuff and put in the new stuff, sorry for the confusion.
---
They literally tweeted about it and alerted more people to the leak lmao they’re definitely building hype
---
Jokes aside, it's nice to know that although they are working for bugs, fixes, mid chapter updates and servers they also multi tasking by designing the next chapter this early. Means there is a good amount of time of planning ahead and room for improvements and tests.
---
*Michael Jackson music starts playing*
---
I was enjoying playing Plague all the way up until rank 8, then I started getting tryhard survivors and realized how unfun it is so I decided to switch to something that might work and be fun for me and not the survivors, so now that I have ranked up my Doctor and have a build that is super annoying to play against but I find pretty fun, Impossible Skill checks plus making my power a sniping annoyance from 30+ meters is so fun for me, now Im at rank 5 and its doing well so far, its slows the game down
---
*JUST A LIL BIT*
---
Just means that he can't be healed at all.
---
Nah totally normal.
---
yeah i feel like all killers should get maybe a 5% extra movement speed to help them or something
---
Am i the only one seeing that stalk still gives you heartbeat? I don't know why everyone is calling him better Myers. Sounds like he has to stalk with a regular terror radius + it only exposes an individual survivor. Imagine stalking with 32m TR? Hard but not impossible especially given the crouch and lean factor i suppose. 
---
Either way finally another scary killer that sounds fun and at keast somewhat strong.
---
Now hear me out but what about...speedo Freddy?1
---
How about you just tell me or send me evidence?
---
They both have a stalk ability, but they are used to do completely different things. Myers just stalks to tier up, and once he does he loses his stealth. Ghost Face seems to be able to apply Evil Within 3 to single survivors while remaining in stealth. He's like an enhanced version of the Pigs sneaking capabilities that goes harder on the stealth, but doesn't have access to bear traps. I think he has the potential to be more interesting than the discription makes it sound
---
Theb try to read it and actually respond to the things i said instead of plugging your ears and singing 'lalala you are wrong'
---
The official twitter said it a chapter tho? That would be yet another paragraph. Then again they got the word pass and patch confused for months too
---
What kind of cosmetics did the Pig get?
---
yes, Calm Spirit should counter Infectious Fright. and as far as your Legion question, i believe the way it works is if they hit someone while they're in Feral Frenzy, they'll see your heartbeat if you're within terror radius, regardless of whether or not you're completely still.
---
Just guarding the gen what a wholesome doggo
---
This used to be a thing, but they changed it. You could hold up to 5 pips at rank 1, but no longer.
---
They might have said chapter on twitter, but they also called Ash vs Evil Dead a chapter on twitter, so I wouldn't put my hopes on that, esp since a fog whisperer said there would not be a survivor. However, there is a leaked icon for a school/university map, so there is that.
---
So just meme okay. Still funny though.
---
Quite the other way around. You seem to be intentionally misreading all of my comments.
---
Ugh same. Loved the movies tho. Gonna love him in the game even more. Definitely gonna main this ghosty boi.
---
They are fixing it, that's why they're announcing it..
---
It’s Myers mixed with Pig, and with a free meme included. You know how many laughs we’re going to get with people leaning around corners?
---
I've seen you post so many pig stufF.
---
Just P2 my piggy.
---
CELEBRATE WITH ME GLEN0CK

---
No it only showed up after I sent that last reply. Like I posted and then randomly went back to read something after a bit and saw that you’d crossed over it so i just thought you did it after my reply
---
TL;DR: I think NOED will get run just as much as it always has.
---
That's a good question.  There is nothing stopping a survivor from doing generators while they're the last one standing, and the "Left Behind" perk is getting a huge buff (which is long overdue, and even with the buff I bet most people won't take it still).
---
But here's what I think for NOED, and why I brought the above up.  If the killer sits on the hatch and (theoretically) doesn't close it, trying to bait the last survivor, they can close it whenever they want, so if they see the survivor, they can close it, then NOED activates, which pretty much makes that last sacrifice free.
---
So if the last survivor thinks killer found the hatch first, what do they do?  Well if they can work on a gen near an exit gate, that might be the move.  They are already at a gate in case it suddenly gates powered, giving them a pretty reasonable chance of escaping, and if it isn't, they can at least get a generator repair in.
---
Thing is, it's not explainable. They're just fucked up. As for the evidence, I suggest noob3's videos.
---
Did he also confirm that Ghostface has only one unique perk? Given the lack of two other unique perks and proper icons, I can only assume this dev build simply lacks the survivor. They don't name paragraphs after countries, either, AFAIK.
---
I'm sad we'll probably never get Jason because I feel like he'd be one of the more fun ones to go against and play as, but we can't have everything I guess haha
---
nobady is more scary than myers

My bad then!
---
/r/dadbydaylight
---
I guess we will have to see how it plays.
---
Now that I remembered something, i think they had to get the rights from both places. They have to get Funworld's to use the mask, and Miramax's for the movie, concept and all that.
---
If the copyright war with him were over, maybe there'd be a chance. But I think it's still going on, as far as I know.
---
Even low tier licensed characters deserve to kill in style. Freddy, Leather cosmetics when?
---
And dont think for a minute I'll forget myers.
---
Make your choice.
---
Considerably increases one of your actions after performing another action
---
I need a thumbs up, so I can use it when someone fails a skillcheck !
---
Killer turns you all into slugs !
---
I picture Neve Campbell's body with Quentin's face. They don't exactly have a great track record with licensed survivors
---
Does that mean BHVR got both then?
---
Happy cake day!
---
3 days won't kill you. Ps4 players waited almost 3 weeks for the Clown.
---
no low tier, i really think he has potentia to be really powerful if they didnt put him a lot of downsides
---
Then you should’ve used quotation marks to show that you were quoting and not asking it again yourself
---
Y E S 
---
But would you consider, waaazup Ghost face for a minute?
---
yes
---
Is this design from the TV show? I don't remember him having that blue line on him.
---
one stab
---
The killer is who the survivors play against in each match, unless you meant "who".
---
We'll make it.
---
Sole survivor?
---
Im not dead yet i can make it!
---
That seems to be the only place it happens to me.
---
A card game within dbd? the survivors can hide in the basment and play poker while the end game collapse is happening!
---
Well at least me and my friends won't have to dc when one of us gets dropped in loading screen.
---
I dont give care at all to be totally honest with you. We see it different ways, end of discussion.
---
He is a weaker Myers, so won't pass the middle tier.
---
But if the game isn't fun then why bother playing?
---
Sprint burst

Power up powers death

I  WILL ADERPYMUFFIN123. I WILL.

bro I like ghostface so I hope they make him a good killer
---
What a wild dance!
---
I think the F13 video game put a nail in that coffin unfortunately.
---
I'd love Texas Chainsaw 2 suit Bubba.
---
You play console. I thought I was good at 360s too before I moved to PC, where killer have frames and faster sensitivity.
---
Oopsie Doopsie
---
Agree, a game is made to have fun. So if youre not having fun no point in playing unless you find another point
---
I just play who ever I have the best perks with
---
Possibly. The survivor wasn't revealed with the leaks. But given how much this comunity has told them Sidney would be the best fit I doubt they'd fuck it up. Even Samnation joked about Sidney being the fitting shoe.
---
its not a big deal, dont see why you felt the need to say that
---
Yep, a personal favorite
---
Nope Make your choice.
---
I guess either tenacity or Unbreakable or deliverance. I go for Unbreakable.
---
Thas some cool art
---
It would pair excellently with Make Your Choice, and while it might not be super strong, it sounds like it would be particularly strong on killers like Myers or Freddy.
---
nope that means ur not good enought to be rank 1
---
The pig cosmetics make me feel like Ms. Piggy went through multiple emo phases. Ghostface is what we really want.
---
He beats you over the head with those big ass 90s phones
---
They're using a Turbo controller and tying it down so that they repeatedly attack. They just want to farm BP's and I think that's reportable but at the same time, you can farm too so I don't know why you would.
---
Now this is epic.
---
Even if it was on purpose, a leak doesn't get me excited for an update.
---
 it makes me dread it due to how incompetent some developers can be
---
https://i.redd.it/shxg41at3tw21.png
---
it was also for public
---
We're still doing these?
---
Nah actually dead hard.
---
That does make sense...
---
I’m still upset that he doesn’t have this or a chainsaw. 
---
I don’t care if they don’t work! How is having a puppet any more efficient than a chainsaw?
---
Eh, he can remain in stealth against solo survivors maybe. Stealth just doesn't work against swf or players who communicate, unless he can actually be invisible for some time the power might as well read as free monitor and abuse.
---
More like “use them for daily challenges” 😂
---
For future reference. Your sentence just looked like you were asking that is all.
---
Nope Piggy&gt;Ghostface&gt;shirtless Myers&gt;shirtless Nea.
---
Meh. First killer im not interested in at all. Dont like the leaks and never liked the killer to begin with.
---
Candyman someday ;_;
---
Wait so it's an actual leak ? Damn I'm excited
---
I would also enjoy that, yes. &gt;:)
---
yea i realise that
---
i give you another one.
---
Fuck you slugging, no blink nurse.
---
Hell I'll take the ["WHAZZUUUUUUUUUP!!"](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81i8Q1F0odL._SY679_.jpg) one while we're at it.
---
nope it recently turned out that David Arquette was the one who wanted that hairstyle for Courteney l
---
Or that you don't have enough time in a season to get that high cuz you have a life but itd be piss easy if you didn't have a job.
---
Is there a source for the map icon?
---
The license-holder only owns the license for the mask, not the entire outfit, so I'm guessing this is BHVR's way around that, like the Laurie horse face.
---
I hope it's stabbing someone through the heart from the back like he does to someone in the movie. That'd be Rad.
---
My mind went to Wu-tang.
---
also should say for perk tokens max out at 2/3/4. So Up to 16 Meters
---
Damn close.
---
Run it with play with your food and you can proxy followed up with tunneling the unhooked survivor after losing the unhooker.
---
I think it's intended. It's the second time.
---
A '' fail '' and aaaaall player's are talking about it!
---
More ad! ;)
---
I'm thinking it will be based off the MTV show and not the movies, similar to how we got Ash from vs. Evil Dead.
---
I'm guessing the survivor will be from the show and not Sydney but i hope im wrong.
---
People think I play Huntress because of meta, nah
---
Just like saying YEET whenever I throw a hatchet
---
I hope he calls them with a phone they puck up and then he stabs them in the other ear.
---
A friend of mine literally just tried it as Billy on Thompson House &amp; he still had collision, is this a timed thing?
---
GOTTA LET IT OUT
---
I’ve prepared for this by buying enough alcohol to get a Viking hammered.
---
oh my ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffucking GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!
---
I was kinda hoping Legion would be there knock off Ghost Face..
---
Tbh Piggy and Myers is the only licensed killers that I 100% support in this game. I think Freddy looks and was executed horribly as well as LeatherFace being designed horribly. But I think I'll end up liking ghost face.
---
Nah that shouldn’t have hit
---
It takes two to tango
---
*And Claudettes LOVE to tango*
---
That feeeling when you're purposefully playing terrible with no add on Freddy and everyone wants to see the new entity kill so you keep getting 3 and 4ks...
---
That looks like feng with this outfit lmao
---
I do see your point. Well..I know that when I play as him I'm going to have a story going on in my head. He definitely won't be just an avatar to me. And I hope one day I get to meet him and everyone else. I won't know what to do with myself once I do.
---
When do the new cosmetics (neon Legion, Nea etc.) come out? Thought it would be with mid-chapter so now I'm confused.
---
inb4 everyone here thinks the game is killer-favored and this becomes a thread I can link whenever someone says that killers dominate the subreddit
---
True, it does have that synergy at least.
---
NOED
---
The less you kick, the faster you break
---
Creating Killers and Survivors does not mean bugs and exploits aren't being fixed. It's two entirely different branches of the game development team.
---
The people who create the characters have nothing to do with bug fixing past a certain point, and that's only for the characters they're creating currently. 
---
I hate how people don't realize this.
---

It's nice of BHVR to give licensed killers their own cosmetics from their respective movies :)

---
Not only does he look lame as fuck but if we really aren't getting a survivor with this chapter, I won't be buying it. I really don't see how the devs could butcher this any more than it already is 😂
---
 A slow walk around you and then a stab
---
I definitely can't speak high enough of Roger L. Jackson. His behind-the-scenes tidbits were great and he was such a nice, fun person who knew how to please his fans. I hope more than anything you get to talk to him one day.
---
Pfft, More like DC. I had like 3 games with multiple bps crash, f'in lame.
---
Too easy bloodhood.
---
I'm pretty sure that thee "shrouded hunt" ability is the ability to crouch and lean, and "stalk" is putting singular survivors into an exposed state.
---
Holy Jesus

I have one of those fucking bloody masks, the peak of human ingenuity.

I guess you are right about that. I will play it because I like how Myers plays and so far it looks like something similar but I was hoping for something out of the box.
---
Im sorry master.
---
Wtf are those wing looking things?
---
Another alternative is Dying light+Make your choice with the new perk. But that’s a lot of slots to take up
---
There's a difference between making (and owning) mistakes and being incompetent. Seems clear at this point that it's very easy to mix up their builds right now. They may need to look into their naming conventions or the process they go through to trial the builds but there's nothing wrong with being fallible, as long as you aren't nothing *but* fallible.
---
It's not actually that person they just took the picture from the internet
---
Would clown count
---
It’S bRoUgHt
---
Its empathy
---
IM GONNA CRY ITS SO PRETTY. APOLOGY ACCEPTED FOR HER CHANGES 😍
---
The red one is the best but it should be all black. Why does he look like he should be in Assassin's Creed?
---
I think it's too early to make that assumption. Depending on the more specific details regarding his functionality in game, he has the potential to be a very strong killer.
---
I completely agree. I was just saying why I think it was on purpose. A lot of people have temporarily stopped playing, or at least play way less than they used to because of the current state of the game, such as myself. It's really annoying seeing new DLC after new DLC when all I want is for the game to be more stable.
---
Pleas be a high tier killer :(
---
I feel like he'll pull you up on your feet and then stab you a bunch of times in the gut until you crumple down in front of him.
---
Fuck yeah!
---
michael 4 lyfe
---
Trapper is literally Jason
---
&gt; Reworked the character collision in the basement stairs to prevent hostage situations. 
---
Sounds like they just didn't want killers trapping people in the basement. I'm hoping this just let's survivors walk to the side of the killer when they're standing in the middle of the stairs rather than remove collision entirely.
---
Yeah, I say that by what I read, we have to know How fast he recovery the TR and stuff...
---
Imagine being alive (inside).
---
I am not 100% sure but, I believe you can only download past builds that are public. 
---
BHVR probably already made today's build private again.
---
Don't people already kinda feel this way about Myers and Pig?
---
If you weren’t bad at the entire premise of the game you wouldn’t need a killer that excels in chases.
---
Yeah, there were also a few new pig cosmetics with this leak
---
That anime broke me
---
Ooh, Weird since that’s Amanda’s model? Guess they can only do her character. I’m not comparing, she’s my fav ❤️
---
Maybe it's the female cosmetic for muslim regions.
---
What kind of logic is this? The whole point of playing a video game is having fun or at least being entertained.
---
Me too...
---
I hope you slug
---
It's still Amanda in the costume though, right? I'd love it to be Hoffman, but it still looks like a feminine body shape.
---
It sounds an awful lot like you care.
---
man I always thought that this killer would be nice for this game. Nailed it.
---
Chucky would be awesome too
---
A garage door will appear out of nowhere, the survivor will try and escape through the cat flap and get stuck then ghostface will just raise the survivor to get crushed by the entity
---
Exactly, some people can have fun in there. Not everyonz
---
Half the people? Its closer to 90% on console at least lmao. All the people upset about this change are the ones who wanted to chase a survivor with a trap on their head while EGC is active so they can inevitably die to the trap no matter how well they played. 
---
This is still possible if they trap them before the last generator is active though. These guys 100% wanted to just get a down from NOED, trap that guy and stand on top of him and force him to die from EGC/the trap lmao. Boo hoo they cant do that anymore :(, what will they ever do.
---
I’m always watching your progress children
---
I've seen the rock and the tree ones in YouTube videos before. I'm sure you could find them if you did some research. I may make a video detailing the other ones.
---
Lmao you care
---
THere WILL BE CONSEQUENCES
---
John Cena for survivor?
---
Scott Jund's "How To Run Generic Tiles" is a great place to start for killer (it's a meme that bad killers who happen to run tiles correctly probably watched his vid).
---
Or Dewey!
---
I was called out for camping as Hag as well when I trapped the basement :)) in the post game chat they were literally yelling at me and saying that they didn't want to crouch through the whole map and they didn't have flashlights to destroy the traps.. yes, and that's my fault how?
---
FINALLY being able to keep offerings and items when the game is wasted on an unfair 2 person game or anything akin to it. This is the main reason i stopped bringing items and offerings. 
---
also, at least 1 of the many unnecessary pig nerfs was undone.

Nope grown ass man probably more mature than you are because I can see the problem within this game, he told people if you’re not happy go play something else instead of fixing shit in the game, a guy who can’t even play his own game and was clearly irritated at the toxic behavior the Korean players were dishing out to him but nothing will ever be done, I can see that his comments to his community about genuine concerns are as toxic as the survivors he caters to when ever they cry about shit being op... don’t know why I even bother this is reddit maybe a total of 1 brain worth of brain cells in this cesspool of a community.

I'm not good at overcomplicating stuff

---
Putting my point across mate, but I am a bit of a hypocrite for posting I guess.
---
YES!
---
No please.
---
Split myself in two!
---
Their argument is that there are plenty of DLC and skins available to pay the devs, and to devote the teams that are working on upcoming updates to bug fixing, that way, we get a relatively bug free game and a team that has an understanding of what’s broken and how not to break it further with the next patch
---
Available with iri?
---
Like? Could you point to the comment that you mean? I have no idea what you think doesn't fit here.
---
This is an excellent starting place to get some idea on what perks are bad (they are at the bottom).  Keep in mind that even lower ranked ones can still very much be useful depending on your play style and build.  For example I do run Play With Your Food, but it is ranked very lowly here: https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/killer/
---
My personal opinion on perks to avoid as a killer main:
---
*Any perks involving the basement are a waste of space.  They don't do enough and it's possible you won't even down a survivor near the basement in a trial.
---
*Overwhelming Presence: Half the time survivors are going to abandon item usage when they're in your terror radius anyway, and even if you wanted to penalize survivors in your terror radius, there are better ways to do it than this.
---
Honestly aside from these I think all the perks can work in niche builds at the very least.  There are perks that are extremely powerful, but lots of the so-called bad perks are at least mildly viable.  It's about finding what you need, and seeing what perks you want to go together.  For example, you could tell me that Brutal Strength is so-so, or that Surveillance is so-so, but together?  Let's get these generators regressing hell yeah!
---
I care about the game at least lol
---
Lucky.. mine put me down and closed hatch and made me wait 3 minutes for entity to claim me.
---
I hope it's how he kills Casey tbh. Or maybe Kenny.
---
WE WANT CHUCKIE
---
It makes sense with the concept of the obsession though. Attack them a few times but save them for last.
---
Preach on brother. You're right as a survivor im gonna do what i need to do to survive and as a killer im gonna do what i need to do to get the kills.

i hope you can buy her with shards because i never bought anything for dbd and im saving shards for a fun killer (im at 6k right now)

He just yells WAZAAAAAAA in the survivors ear until they commit suicide
---
The fandoms favorite killers in one package? No way, I don't think they could handle it
---
I mean, it wouldn't be breaking any rules if they were to just give him an all-black cloak. Doesn't have to be the one from the movie, but this one is really weird looking. The mix of greys make it look like an assassins creed outfit or something
---
I tend to switch up my playstyle every match as killer.  If I'm completely stomping a crew then after I've hooked everybody twice I'll just run down to the basement and have a doctor/Michael dance party
---
With a bit of luck I might get off
---
Does his ribbons always float like that? I’m starting to think this is going to be an original chapter and they only got the mask license.
---
*crouch-walking intensifies*
---
Peanits from BHVR said that they'd come out some time after the mid-season patch, so they'll probably be gradually released between now and the next chapter (likely June, based on the 6 week half season estimate)

Damn, they were so close.

apparently he just had said “Reported” to my other friend cause he escaped in the hatch before he could get to him lol
---
Thanks mate, really appreciate that you understand my point of view here lol
---
If Michael wasn’t easy to spot in the open already, a walking bedsheet will certainly do the trick.
---
Lmao what an absolute unit
---
I'm talking about how much fun it's going to be to rip your insides out..now open the fucking door Christine!
---
How many times does this need to happen before they hire an actual QA team. 
---
Like for real, what is the QA lead doing? How have they not lost their job at this point?
---
Survivors find anything to complain about. Finished a game as Pig about 30 mins ago were they're complaining I was "camping" my Ruin totem, yet all go there to destroy it. Should I just run away from it then? Fucking braindeads lmao.
---
If they can get the license for the gf character, they can get the license for sidney easily
---
Awfully specific. The no blinking part plus the slugging makes it seem like it could be Tenacity, just to annoy the Nurse more.
---
Some killers will look for any bs excuse to camp. Or they're just prone to anger issues and getting bratty when things aren't easy for them/when they don't get what they want.
---
And that stalky boi can T-Bag!!

plot-twist: The survivor was not in the build because she was not from Scream but from Scary Movie.

What's the deal with his outfit? Why are there three stripes on his head? I know this is an alt colour but the outfit looks nothing like the movie version.

Many of the updates recently are utter dogshit.   To expect the company to not release a steaming pile after such results is just stupid.   They can't even control the quality of their releases and keep leaking things.  Their communication and actions speak to a team in shambles.   I think the demise of Deathgarden hit their pocketbook a little too hard.
---
For the ones that have ribbons, they float up and down.
---
Ive seen the MTV show and that isnt what the tv show costume looks like. its not even a ghost face costume in the show. 
---
id only approve of a show character being a survivor if it was brooke
---
i loved brooke. she was the fan favorite

---
Consider this; a big dump of licensed cosmetics on top of Ghostface and Pig, including original Freddy, Pretty Lady Leatherface and Forty Years Later Myers.
---
Paranormal-ish
---
Mirror Myers is pretty weak versus sprint burst, lithe, and other meta perks. 105% movement speed is trash, and it only “kinda” works on the map lery’s, and to a lesser extent, the game. Unless you get some lucky gen pulls, it’s really bad.
---
nice
---
Bois......... I have a good feeling about this.
---
Entity.... I'm trying to sneak around...
---
But I'm dummy t h i c c , 
---
and the clap of my asscheeks keeps alerting the killer.
---
It's Amanda's outfit from when she fights Detective Matthews in either Saw 3 or Saw 4? I forget
---
The default black skin still looks nothing like the outfit he wears in the movie.
---
Which killer are you playing? Killer perks can sometimes be heavily dependent on the killer themselves.
---
This is what I'm most excited about...
---
Oh yeah absolutely.  I always respond to hate on DBD by saying, "Thank you for the game friend, I had a great time.  You have a wonderful day.  Good luck in your next game!". I've gotten quite a few apologies afterwards which I then screenshot in a File of Honor.  Some people have bad games and need to take their frustration out, I don't mind if it's on me.
---
You should definitely throw this idea to BHVR. What a concept, GENIUS!
---
Standing at the stairs when you have a survivor hooked at the basement isn't really a "basement build".
---
Saw 3 Amanda oh fuck yes
---
It fits well.
---
From everything I know about him, he does seem like that kind of guy. It's nice to know this is validated by someone who has first hand experience. I'm happy you met him. And thank you for hoping that. If/when I do, I'll message you.
---
Myers and Pig are my favorites. I used to be a Nurse main, but that got old after a while. I'm looking forward to ghostface. Besides the Halloween chapter, this will be the only chapter I've ever bought for myself
---
She is 10x more terrifying in this form lol
---
We Germans have a problem now if Ghostface is called The Ghost in game.
---
In German The Wraith is called „Der Geist“ which translates to The Ghost. 
---
Now The Spirit is called „Das Gespenst“ which is another word for Ghost.
---
But I have no idea what could come for Ghostface because there are no synonyms left. Maybe they‘ll come up with something else
---
Leak does not mean its actually going to happen. It's in infancy so they could change the perks all together.
---
Wait what the fuck
---
Yo is that a mod or
---
I can't even tell anymore
---
Every perk has a place on certain builds but in general: Monstrous Shrine, Huntress Teachables, &amp; Overwhelming Presence are not great. Early on I would focus on a character you want to play and look up meta perks because the more killers/perks you unlock, the longer it will take for ones you want to appear in bloodweb.
---
How would Chucky even carry/hook survivors?
---
Pig+Myers=Ghost
---
It's not up to the game
---
*shrieks*
---
It looks like one of Feng's tops
---
I'm glad people enjoy this image.
---
This is so awesome! There is no way for me to be happier about a DLC
---
I'm not the guy who got upset about it. I was just saying, editing comments is a thing in case you didn't know. But fuck me for trying to let you know I guess.
---
So it says they re-added the theme music for DLC characters. Does that mean I can play the Clown music on the main menu again? It was the music that was playing when I first started DBD and I miss it. How would I change the music?
---
This dead ass just happened to me, and he spams me telling me im trash
---
BHRV
---
I don't know if I need this or definitely did not need this but I know it's one or the other and nowhere in between...and I made it..
---
DUDE this made me laugh so hard. I had never seen this before.
---
Although I remember when someone did a mock build of the ghost and a perk where everyone had phones and if he called you it would ring/find your location.. so I guess that is  pretty similar to this parody.
---
He had a perk that also made him into a survivor for a limited time lol.
---
&gt;My bans are due to a phishing scam (i'm a scum)
---
&gt;If you DC or suicide on hook you are a scum
---
Pick one
---
Shit is *fetch*
---
As a killer main, I don't understand why Killers get so salty just because survivors are good at the game
---
Ghostface: Not anymore, hehe
---
I love to play against her. It's challenging and you cannot loop her like others. We can appreciate how skillful she is. Please continue :)
---
I thought about this, but if that’s the case no one knows any of the characters of the new season of the tv show so who would be the survivor?
---
From this its all too apparent you do care, play like a dick if you want but just accept it.
---
I'm out of loop here, leak what info?
---
Blindness is nice since it's like a lesser version of The Third Seal and the mangled effect is largely ineffective since they'll be mending for a sixth of that anyway, but where it really shines is when you can make them be Broken for 60 seconds. This is pretty nice because that means they're stuck like that for a while. So applying Thano with Sloppy, they're now permanently contributing to that for 60 seconds - they can't instaheal if they're broken - and only after 60 seconds can they even consider healing.
---
Seems his powers are kind of pig-based, too
---
So are we not getting a survivor sydney/Dewey's? No map, woodboro high?
---
It looks like based on the design they went for the rights of the mask solely and not the movie version which means nothing more than just a character. 
---
Disappointing.
---
Also why haven't they got Jason yet? That game is dead and done and we know now officially who "owns" adult version of Jason.
---
officer Doofy confirmed
---
Nurse Players are immune to phishing scams? She can do it all!
---
Pizza dwight is always the meta in my heart
---
For real the same guy?! Lmfaoooo omgggg
---
Are the masks new models or just retextures of the default mask?
---
Pretty sure it's based on[this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/331201359565160463/575386124432834576/SAW3_DAY2_102-1.png) look. I think it's Saw 3 or 4. Sorry for quality, I'll flip through the movie and get a screencap later.
---
Finally! YES!
---
Welcome to dbd
---
anyone peep his add ons?
---
Gotta go fast but slow
---
I really hope they do!
---
I use characters that suck so if I lose and people say I suck I can just blame it on the character
---
We have a winner!
---
I FUCKING LOVE PUPPIES
---
Are you on Xbox? It isn't on Xbone yet.
---
Be gentle Behavior, I just got paid...
---
Some serious Hotline Miami vibe
---
I just prestiged her during the bloodhunt, LOVE her bloody clothes...and now this...I can't breathe....too much excitement...help me....:)
---
No someone else but still
---
Or they have a rat or they just dont learn from mistakes. How did bhvr get so amateur like these last months
---
I’m hoping for Kirby
---
Thanks boss
---
Let’s consider that Michael is from the 1978 movie and the 1978 movie alone- no curses, no retirement home Myers, just Michael aged 21 out to get Laurie in Haddonfield on Halloween night. So he’s pretty damn unstoppable.
---
We're Gonna Live Forever: Each time you perform a **Safe Hook Rescue** or take a hit to protect a Survivor, gain 25% stackable bonus to all Bloodpoint gains up to a maximum of 50/75/100%
---
Not sure if I'm happy about getting farmed less, or upset that running borrowed time and WGLF to make stacks safer to get won't matter now
---
I know this is a joke but... I want it now.
---
i tried to see if she wore that outfit in the movies and i couldnt find it 
---
it looks like a combination between the outfit she died in and the outfit she wore when she was in the reverse beartrap herself 
---
but minor differences in both outfits
---
Don’t get your hopes up people
---
How is it being a dick if I'm just doing MY objective? to Kill as a Killer.
---
and then it's okay for Survivors to suddenly just rat out other survivors and be a dick themselves?
---
Read the Context, I'm playing how the game is intended.
---
I'm worried about not getting a survivor with him to be honest.
---
The rights to Scream are confusing. The movies hold the rights to the characters and premise.  The mask is owned by a Halloween mask company because Wes just found it while location scouting. 
---
So hopefully they didn't just go to the mask company and get the look and nothing else.
---
I'm not blaming your screenshot, I'm blaming imgur's shitty display pixalating everything beyond comprehension.
---
I believe people tried but couldn't get into any matches
---
Technically we have shaman Wraith
---
I let him kill me to let another survivor escape too, but he was being a dumbass and tried to save me
---
I think it’s gonna be a school
---
Epic bad bhvr good?
---
Yeah it’s stupid killers sometimes are just asshats
---
I'm pretty sure BHVR cut off the dev build servers ASAP.
---
That's cool, what about voodoo witch doctor hag?
---
Sounds about right, they said they were trying to get licensed killers new cosmetics and Lionsgate owns the Saw Franchise as well as the Ash vs Evil Dead franchise
---
Oh Ghostface got leaked on accident by the Devs.
---
And a week or so ago this guy on Twitter said he was going to get to announce something Scream and video game related later this month but he’d “leak some info” if he got enough followers.
---
So it was probably this.
---
BRENDA! WHERE?!
---
Yes, while we must take the stats as “anecdotal” too, I for one am still more likely to believe someone purporting something based on gathering data, rather than some rando saying “This isn”t how it seems like for me, so it must be totally false”
---
When you select a killer, Clown and after, it will play their version of the menu soundtrack. So the Clown will have the circus theme, for example.
---
This makes me happy :D I've been wanting him in the game for so long
---
Also what movie is that from? I always remember Ghosty Boi in plain black robes?
---
[There are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqbw00IjcOk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3015) already [2 different](https://i.imgur.com/R390EId.jpg) masks we can wear as meyers revealed!
---
Play how you want but if you tunnel/camp etc your being a dick
---
It's about whether you get the point or not though.
---
Survivors complain about all these things for a Killer and Killers are just trying to play how they want
---
Sprint Burst?
---
It would work since the entity doesn’t need to scale things properly
---
the red outfit looks decent but overall I don't like costume design.
---
He's just as iconic, but he wouldn't be my first choice...although i think we aren't getting any licensed survivors...it looks like they only got the rights to the mask because the outfit isn't correct.
---
It has to be on purpose lol. It's a good idea tbh, it drums up hype really well for no cost to them
---
...why not both? Myers is both the Shape and Michael. You don’t see it much, but calling him the Shape is probably accepted- mainly because the original film credited him as The Shape. So why pick him up on what names are used for a killer who clearly has two aliases?
---
I don't think he'll play anything like Michael.
---
Yes the only way not to be seen by the legion heartbeat is if you've already been hit by frenzy
---
On Xbox one sometimes when I play killer I get the lag spike when I get bloodlust.
---
Don’t you dare insult my son like that again
---
Does everyone already know about charms? There are no posts about it
---
This was probably on purpose tbh
---
Can someone explain the readded DLC killer music to me. Does it just read it to the menu?
---
Meg's face is the poor man's "pretty woman" cosmetic
---
niche meme i know. but whoopi ***claud***berg is excited
---
Already done, Ghostface.
---
does it say camp anywhere? I didn't realize it did.
---
bruh im not reading that, you fucking IDIOT
---
That's what ghost faces power will be, stalking to get rid of terror radius
---
Most times players are actually there, surprisingly. They’ll either be waiting for NOED or even just afk farm but they’ll be there. I went against a Trapper once who was spamming his trap, I stepped on it and then sabotaged it, he came back and chased me out.
---
Legions I’ve come against today are still tunneling shit bags it’s just not quite as annoying with the deep wounds.
---
kirby survived the events of scream 4. the planned "she's got a pulse" scene was cut from the final cut but she lived
---
But why would I apply broken to them, when I can instead down them (since they're already wounded), and it's not like I can tag them with debuffs and go chase someone else, since it cancels the power and the stun is even longer than it used to.
---
Oh that's crazy, thanks for the reply.
---
So no one told you life was gonna be this way &lt;stabstabstabstab&gt;
---
Your spine is broke, you're choked
---
The random's D.O.A.!
---
Yeah bro; Behariov.
---
I haven't tested it out yet but I'm pretty sure they fixed it too.
---
You swang too early, lad.
---
Hmmm interesting. Shirtless Myers when
---
ALRIGHT I AM SORRY I AM DUMB
---
I AM HAPPY THAT YOU'RE BEING POSITIVE.
---
While unlikely it could be that they intentionally do this to build up anticipation and hype for the release of the next chapter
---
I like to think BHVR leaked Ghostface just in spite of this guy.
---
That's the joke
---
If you want, I mean if she just dc's i dunno why it would matter
---
As a long time Scream fan. Holy shit I'm hyped
---
And then all those people got replies that explained that they had already done it with Hillbilly/Bubba.
---
Hex: Ruin
---
Wow. Can't even read a paragraph. Very impressive.
---
TL;DR, you're a fool who can't think for yourself, and can only resort to grade-school insults instead of making any actual points.
---
That succinct enough for you, junior?
---
People complained from PTB, was a nightmare in there. Videos on YT of this happening. I'm just curious how this works, can you just walk around the Killer?
---
🥰😘🥵
---
At this point I have no idea if people are joking about hoping shirtless Myers will be a thing. It won’t. Something like that just wouldn’t be allowed by the holders. H2018 Myers is almost a definite if he does get cosmetics however.
---
It’s all about the surprise hits which is why Lery’s is the map to use. You want to hit them then try to cut them off by surprising them through another doorway or when they round the corner. If you try to chase as mirror Myers you’ve already lost.
---
That's insane.
---
I really can't see why you would think that. There's more to a map like that than being set inside a building.
---
It's gonna be the school anyhow. There's a leaked icon for the offering, being a graduation cap.
---
Made me chuckle lmao. lmao means Laughing my ass off. ???????
---
I’ll keep this on mind, thanks
---
I'm pretty sure the black robes are the default. This is an alternate cosmetic if so.
---
More like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXatquVqAc)
---
Lol no they didn't.
---
Third. Pig and her power were leaked.
---
Shirtless Myers was never a thing in any of the movies right? Which means no. It still has to be accurate to the character.
---
Like?
---
Change Legion and Pig but leave Nurse and Billy alone. Quality.
---
---[The joke]---&gt;
---
.
---
You
---
Great job! Did you make the mask yourself? How’s the visibility?
---
Got it
---
I would approve of this for the memes
---
I don’t get it, what does this twitter guy have to do with anything and who is he?
---
So she **didn't** dc this time (since according to your post you actually got to face camp her) and you decided to do it anyway for "revenge" ? Yes, very childish.
---
That’ll be cool. I think I’m in the minority when I say I prefer indoor maps- hence why I love Lery’s.
---
You’d think that, but, nah.
---
Imagine it with make your choice though
---
Looks awesome! Love the mask especially. :)
---
i'm going to be disappointed if there isn't sidney prescott
---
How does it defend shitty behavior?
---
You're obviously taking this out of context if you're like "Oh He supports Camping and Tunneling"
---
When I didn't say a single bloody thing about it.
---
How about this; READ.
---
Does it say anywhere that Camping is okay? Nope. I don't believe it does.
---
Do I think camping is okay? I think it's dumb for the Killer to do that because it's a waste of objective to secure 1 kill.
---
I play as Survivor a lot, if i get camped I don't care, but I do care that if I let go immediately my teammates get screwed, so what do I do? I hold on even if i'm getting camped.
---
Tunneling I support tunneling to a certain degree.
---
I support that if it's an unsafe unhook, I'm downing to Deny Altruism points and to make my job 10x easier.
---
I don't support ignoring objective just to kill the one survivor that you decided gave you a bad look.
---
Does that help? or are you going to be more of a dick?
---
Now we just need speedo Quentin
---
Microsoft has to approve all updates if they come from a 3rd party some something like that, it’s not BHVR’s fault
---
[This is the endgame collapse, click this comment for a video explaining it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGzYaiiMlY)
---
That's not true, we'll in a chase they get used for jukes
---
Yeah good point but they do have an agreement with Lionsgate Films.   His outfit looks different to me but I haven't seen the movies in years. Doesn't he wear a full black cover?
---
*Happy oink noises*
---
Ghostface might be a standalone dlc without a survivor though. There hasn't been a leak about Sidney or anyone else, and there seems to be some kind of licensing troubles concerning the characters and Scream franchise overall.
---
At least that's what I've heard, correct me if I'm wrong. Shit, I hope I'm wrong, since I'd like to see Woodsboro map with Sidney as a survivor.
---
Yep hehe
---
Because the player base is 4 survivors to 1 killer. So survivors are where the money is, so killers can get fucked.
---
Source: Killer main
---
Tis how a Quentin player is seen...
---
Stalky Sr. and Stalky Jr.
---
dead meme
---
Everyone pretend to be surprised when the announce it
---
I make Saboteur even worst.
---
All we need now is a real punishment for people who dc in game
---
Making him miss his only attack, forcing him to chase without his power,

He doesn't ignore every mechanic the survivor has like pallets and windows, and he gets punished for missing a swing and can't just swing eight times before his power runs out.
---
I'm not 100% sure, I've not played the EGC yet. As far as I was aware, it was only during the EGC that the hatch grab was nullified, so I don't think so but don't quote me on that 😂
---
I’m staring to think these leaks are intentional to create hype and measure the community reaction to licenses content as it costs them more money to make than original content.  This is just me speculating but hmmmm.
---
Still think we should’ve given ghostface the legion’s power
---
That is true
---
This is so stupid.
---
I fucking love it.
---
I think they’re remodels. If you compare the two screenshots, they’re definitely different, so at least one of them is a remodel (I can’t remember the specifics of Pig’s default mask by memory).
---
What was the phone idea?
---
Yeah I know that... but bhvr should realize that if all killers or most of them stop playing the game, the survivors won’t be able to play too. So it would be nice to add something in favour of killers once in a while
---
The point of changing him was to stop him from being able to tunnel the same person and hit them repeatedly until he knocked them down while almost completely ignoring loops. Now there is little to zero point in using his power on the same survivor that you just hit. If you think this sprinting maniac who is a first hit killer is annoying I can't imagine how op you think freddy is.
---
No, that's still a ways off.
---
This is a new mechanic called the end game collapse, you can read the patch notes for the specifics but basically once a gate is open you have 2 minutes to leave or the entity kills you
---
She died in saw 3 so probably 3
---
To me it just looks like they don't want to continue the match..
---
"You have failed me for the last time."
---
Looks like Joey with a scream mask
---
Thank you :)
---
I'm curious to try this and how the basement blocking stuff works! Thanks.
---
***NONSENSE!***
---
lmaoooooooooooooo
---
If you’re gonna mark this as a spoiler you should probably not put said spoiler directly in the title.
---
Oh thank God. It would be cool but that's what is stopping nurse from being a nightmare on console like she is on PC.
---
I picked up the game last night and played nearly all morning starting off as Dwight....so many quick ending games for me.
---
I've since gotten a bit better and now prefer Jake.
---
So he is basically a mix between the Pig and Myers... interesting.
---
All players would have been talking about it during official announcement though, especially on places that don't normally talk about the game (like general gaming forums). This leak only really impacts dedicated fans in the know. 
---
If this was actually intentional, they need to fire the marketing intern ASAP for this lame rollout TWICE. I know some people who were excited over Ash but completely forgot by the time he actually hit live servers and just never installed the game again.
---
I unfortunately haven’t watched the vid, as I’m at work, but if McLean says it, then I believe him. My original argument was trying to be more about why his (the other poster’s) evidence would be any more correct than say if I literally got it 50% every time.
---
Once Jason and Pinhead are in, we are set. We’ll have the classic icons (Freddy, Michael, Jason, Leatherface and Pinhead), everyone’s favourite chainsaw wielding badass (Ash), a modern icon (Ghostface) and a representative of one of the most infamous horror franchises in recent memory (Pig).
---
Yeah we need that outfit ASAP
---
When are they coming??????
---
wouldnt call it totally wasted. I now know where at least 2 people are
---
If you're new to the game there's this slight chance that you won't hook me
---
Thought that was Michael Jackson at first glance on the left.
---
Nah because trappers traps/ hillbilly’s chainsaw always stay the same no matter what.
---
What about hooks? Just yeet the survivor on up?
---
It’s real- seems to be based on Hoffman.
---
Is there somewhere with the killer in action?  I'm a bit curious about this "lean" part...

---
Why do I doubt this
---
OLD MAN MYERS PLEASE
---
I really hope this is just some type of placeholder body, it looks nothing like the movie ghostface
---
From what I seen, he has the same power as Myers. I mean, can someone tell me the difference between Scream's power and Michael's power ? I think this will be another killer which doesn't have map pressure and which will get pallet looped to death.
---
Na, na na na na na. You don't get to decide. I do. And I'm telling YOU you're wrong. Don't be a douche bag. If you know what someone is talking about, don't go stroking your dick and correcting someone. Believe me. Nobody cares. Don't be that guy.
---
How are people this stupid? Like, seriously. 
---
When you launch the game after downloading today's patch, it literally pops in your face the news about the new mechanic (EGC). 
---
Holy shit, it blows my mind.
---
I guess it could be. I kinda hope not though. I appreciate that he's in since Scream is my favourite film ever made, but damn I really wanted his standard cheap halloween costume to be in the game. Maybe it will be though, we'll have to wait and see
---
3.0.0 probably won't come until Summer, along with dedicated servers, just like 2.0.0 had the huge new addition of the Store and didn't come until summer. Ghostface will almost certainly come out before dedicated servers, so there's no reason to believe the Ghostface update will be 3.0.0.
---
I’ve had better ideas
---
If you watched the video it should be explained to you. He’s just a random horror fanboy who had a chance to make an announcement of Ghost Face coming to DBD and he’s been milking it for a while now. Always teasing shit on twitter and telling everyone to follow him him on instagram etc
---
So that means we can't stop people from building up mettle of men stacks anymore?
---
I'm a firm believer in the idea that companies leak things on purpose in order to generate hype and yeah, first Ash now this? Its starting to get suspicious.
---
Nah just some loser with tiny fragile glasses who cracks his fingers everytime he turns on his computer, and gets angry really easily whenever something doesn’t go his way.
---
Also he uses old meme lingo and still misses filthyfrank videos
---
“Hey Todd?”
---
“Yeah Bill?”
---
“You notice how much hype was built up and money we made when the Ash update was leaked?”
---
“Yeah?”
---
“And did you see how much money we made off of that licensed release?”
---
“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”
---
*releases dev build* [“Oopsies!”](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXatquVqAc)
---
Isn't the leaked Ghost face just an alternate skin?
---
And you thought not being able to see Claudette was OP
---
Yup, like a deserter debuff. For a given amount of time you're no longer able to join matches.
---
“I find your lack of competence... disturbing.”
---
she really can
---
Honestly they need to punish DCs a lot more
---
Better be Dewey
---
This could happen before. The solution was for the other survivors to leave so he can get the hatch.
---
I thought they could only use the license for the game? Must've done some finagling to use movie outfits.
---
It’s intentional
---
I mean it’s still Amanda. Hoffman doesn’t have boobs (as far as I know).
---
Even if you are a "grown ass man" you don't sound like one.
---
1. Yes he said that, he screwed up and got lynched for it. 
---
2. His character has nothing to do with with his marketing skills.
---
3. No developer can play their own game since they need to focus on actually creating and developing that very game and have no time to play since they have jobs they need to be doing and that job doesn't involve playing it, unless you are QA or bug-fixing, which Mat is neither of. 
---
4. The game has been consistently getting fixes and has drastically improved since they got publishing rights.
---
5. Toxicity is not really there in my experience unless you instigate the other team. And even if there is unprovoked toxicity then that does not occur that often to be concerned about and is certainly not out of ordinary from any other community anywhere.
---
6. There might be just 1 brain worth of brain-cells on this sub but none of them are certainly yours.
---
First Ash and now this? They have so many leaks that the proverbial pipeline is just missing a pipe entirely!
---
Its the fact that now with him having 115% MS it's easier for him to close distance on you after using his power. That and the old strategy of not healing Vs Legion doesn't really work now that he doesn't have a broken leg 50% of the time.
---
Sony have to do that too...

damn man no credit at all smh
---
we played a drinking game with my friend. we were playing killer
---
let's say our rules weren't great. 350ml of vodka per match is quite excessive
---
whoa
---
Let’s check in with BHVR to see what they think about this right after releasing Bruce Campbell and now about to release Ghostface. [BHVR, your thoughts?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXatquVqAc)
---
Because anyone can just throw 10 dollars into a cosmetic for a game.
---
and you will until they balance the game around SWFs and not the original concept of 4 random people being matched together with no ability to communicate.
---
The FAQ that I linked to is a little vague on that.  Nowhere does it say that NOED doesn't still trigger when the final generator is powered in normal play, but in the FAQ it says that the perk activates regardless of when Endgame Collapse is triggered, which suggests that it only triggers when Endgame Collapse is triggered.  In normal play that would not be when the final generator is powered.
---
In other words, I don't have a concrete answer given the material out there.  In the official patch notes it doesn't say NOED's functionality has otherwise changed, so I would believe that you are correct and that NOED still triggers when the last generator is powered, and that the only change is that it also triggers if the killer closes the hatch.
---
But I don't know 100% for sure.  Good call on bringing this note up.
---
No shit!
---
As an xbox player, I’m okay with this. Maybe bc I also have MK11 to keep me busy but yeah, still hype.
---
What is this
---
PS4 didn't get 2.0.0 for weeks and they got nothing. What makes you think you deserve something. You deserve nothing, and you'll get nothing.
---
I reveal hookers to the entire survivor team.
---
Sadly.
---
Again, I don't think BHVR is that smart.
---
He does. It also looks cheaper and more generic Halloween costume because that's what it's suppose to be. The perk name is also a part of a Randy line ''THERE'S A SIMPLE FORMULA!"
---
So who knows? I could also see them not giving us Sidney because she doesn't fit lore? Everyone in the Entity's realm? Save Laurie (who is somehow immune to lore of her universe and DbD lore).  They've died.
---
Sid never died. 
---
So maybe Randy is coming? He and Casey are the biggest ''Well, we died." in the franchise.
---
\*straight up just reuploads my meme with no credit\* aight chief thats how it be i guess
---
If the pig is off closing the hatch, you can run around and remove the RBT. If the pig is chasing you, you can go find the hatch.
---
Yes, you would call it tunneling.
---
i like the doctor and i exclusively use him
---
BrUnGt
---
Haha wow.
---
I'm planning on drinking Jager, one friend rum and the other whisky.
---
HOLY SHIT IM LITERALLY SHAKING RN
---
Hangman's trick
---
Dedicated servers have always been on the roadmap under Summer.
---
&gt; I'd take a huge QoL update, even if it takes months, over a brand new chapter each three months.
---
I've been saying that for like a year. I'd wish they'd just focus on balance and fixing bugs instead of pumping out new chapters every 3 months that just breaks more shit and creates more imba
---
Agreed. His face might not be decent, but they can still make it up to to us with this.
---
People are forgetting that the Pig leaked too. LQ versions of her model and power description leaked a week or so before her release. The devs have been doing this for quite some time, yet people are still foolish enough to believe it's an accident lmao
---
Unrelenting
---
That is a good thing. It means we Legion can close gaps and M1 the survivor. Much more effiicent.
---
if it's 21k shards your Better off just buying them with actual money
---
I'm not expecting that at all, if you can't afford it of course you shouldn't, which is why Iri shards is the right move for that person. But for the people that can, it truly is a smart move for the whole community to do it. Them seeing the licensed cosmetics getting bought for Auri cells really will open their eyes and push for even more Licensed cosmetics for the rest of the survivors and killers because they know they will make a profit no matter how much they have to spend to acquire those rights.
---
If you had 30 to buy it, and 60 to buy any new game that you want, why not? You're not buying the cosmetic, it's essentially your reward for showing support.
---
It's a design flaw in the game, can't blame the survivors for it. That doesn't mean genrushing isn't a thing though, even if it just means playing survivor as effectively as possible.
---
stfu
---
get discordance and BECOME ruin
---
You cared enough to write and post a 236-word diatribe.
---
Probably an intentional leak. But... about the killer... why go for that outfit and not the badass black robe he uses in the movies? Licensing issue? It would be 100x more scary being chased by a ghostface with black robe instead of this medieval/executioner look, in my opinion.
---
I know that is probably not the final look but damn, Legion looks a lot better.
---
Actually they’re crawling so not yet
---
Yes people view it the wrong way. If you don't show support for your game, it won't change. Pure and simple
---
Every update, dlc, etc. has to go through MS's certification process.  
---
It's been this way since the early days.
---
Let me remind anyone who says this would be out of place that this isn't simply asking for [X] char in a skimpy outfit.
---
It's literaly an outfit he wears in the film for a lengthly scene and gets pulled into the Dream World in.
---
It's actually one of his most iconic looks/scenes in the film in fact.
---
When the plague update came out they made the graphics look like sh*t to make the FPS better. Thats what Bhaviour calls "console optimisation".
---
They should start by giving him the long, majestic black gown he has in the original movies. He looks ridiculous in the leaks in my opinion, I really do hope they give him his classic look.
---
Are there no default black robes then?
---
If we're just going on your argument alone, yes, I would have agreed with you as personal feelings play a small part and words alone don't carry much weight. It's just that this part is an exception because /u/GlenOck is claiming the wrong thing (that Pig traps are at a natural disadvantage to the killer) when the truth is that there's no advantage at all.
---
No, you are too lonely for that
---
I think Dead by Daylight should punish dc'ing the same way League of Legends does. I have a lot of complains about League but I can't deny that their disconnect punish system works incredibly well. Basically they won't punish you for dc'ing one time, however they will start to place you in "low priority" queues when you start dc'ing a lot, giving you from 1-30 minutes for wait time before you get to enter an actual queue game. This usually lasts for about 5-10 games, if the player disconnects during one of those games they start receiving more severe bans, like 3 days or 2 week bans, it works out pretty well, I can see this working in Dead by Daylight aswell.
---
Peanits isnt a direct game dev
---
Makes sense to me. 
---
I doubt they had to pay more for the right to make the costume probably just get approval from the holder since they already have the rights for the character.
---
Preeeeeetttty sure I saw his conception on /r/dbdgonewild
---
is there something for killers too???
---
Boil Over?
---
&gt;I don't play on Xbox
---
&gt;What makes you think you deserve something?
---
Bruh, sorry that PS4 didn't get anything, but don't act like an ass because BHVR didn't give you shit.
---
No, it’s real. Two new Pig skins were leaked around the same time as the new killer. I’m excited for licensed skins.
---
Considering they accidentally talked about Plague in their intro video to Legion it’s clear they do work on characters far in advance. Heck, for the licensed ones especially, they probably already have it all worked out ahead of time and delay release for not just the 3 month chapter wait but also when the license holder wants to release it for maximum marketing exposure.
---
Instadown headshots were never a thing.  
---
It was a bug caused by dedicated servers, I believe.
---
Fire Up
---
lost me at “forget shirtless Myers”
---
I love the scream movies someone I’d actually play
---
YES. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!!!
---
.......I honestly don't know what to say to that. Like, dafuq?
---
Im hyped for that tho
---
No matter what he looks like, is Ghostface *really* Ghostface if he doesn't eat dirt after tripping on an eyelash? Where's that EMOTE, BHVR?
---
Just give her infinite traps at this point lel
---
You aren't able to put on 12 in a match anyway unless you slug multiple times
---
Roblox
---
Oh thanks been awhile since I’ve played.
---
Forgot about him too! He would be a good choice but I'm hoping we get Dewey.
---
I get legion has a lot of hate but she’s my number three killer behind myers and huntress
---
I’ve played with that dude a couple of times and also seen him on the steam discussions. He’s the epitome of “reee i hate survivors and go on the steam discussions to complain about them because im not actually good at the game but id rather make other people miserable than improve” killer mains
---
Not that well but I can
---
Think we did a pretty good job so far
---
isnt the temporary perk image and the fact that this one perk had info about all 3 levels enough for you to notice that it's a Work In Progress?
---
I'm not an expert by all mean but I think they're doing pretty fine with the exclusive Ash, now the Scream DLC. I definitely buy with aurics when I can (shirtless David FTW) but if I can use shards then even better.
---
Agreed, many people find prayer beads (no phase sound) to be pretty broken but compared to other killer’s addon’s it’s rather tame.  There are so many things you can do with spirit that I find awesome lol
---
Does the killer get notified when you break a dull totem? Like when you break a hex one
---
Im 95% sure no0b3 and puppers did this already.
---
Oh I wasn’t really arguing one way or another on that, just contributing what my understanding at the time was to the discussion. My beef was more with /u/ToanGreenlow and their whole “That’s not my experience, so it’s wrong” and not providing any evidence to the contrary.
---
Barbecue and chili? Never heard of it
---
Yes please
---
So now that we're getting movie inspired killer cosmetics, what are the chances of game specific ones? Because I'm just saying, a pig outfit where the entity has taken hold onto her more and started to change her, resulting in the pig head either being alive or becoming her actual head would be super cool/fucked.
---
Omg shirtless Myers.
---
&gt;and her clothes are typically darker and harder to see.
---
just say she's black, Peanits.
---
I hope he does the rap from scary movie in a close up and the survivor is just dead when the screen pans out with Shorty yelling "That was the illest rhyme I ever seen son!!!"
---
Every time.
---
I got the best 4k against a double odd bulb pallet blinding duo. Felt so good to chase them down
---
Bunny Feng please and thank you
---
What do you mean? They don't have a fix bugs button on their desk that they refuse to hit?
---
Oh this is 100% not an original idea haha 
---
Could still be a good laugh though.
---
Oh lawd he comin’.
---
Why would he be low tier?
---
It probably works so well in that game because the player base is big enough to be feasible. DBD doesn't have such a player base especially when you think it's platform specific. 
---
But I do think a timeout will work just fine, same way it's in World of Warcraft. You exit a dungeon/pvp, you get a 15 min wait time before joining again.
---
Lol I know someone else responded saying you made this. Someone sent it to my in my dms on Twitter sometime ago, I’ve been using the bit for awhile. Am I able to tag you in the post on Reddit (I’m fairy new to Reddit)
---
I would wait till they are actually released
---
https://twitter.com/Morf_UK/status/1125784144125026305?s=19 link to the leak
---
For sure. I bet they did it just to get feedback on the cosmetic (assuming they arent doing the classic black robe) and the power before the reveal.
---
Gonna have to start buying this stuff so the devs will start adding more stuff
---
I would drop Claudette in a heartbeat for some Brenda Meeks.
---
calm down sweetie he’s actually in good condition
---
That sucks, you're right it looks like a knight or squire
---
I think he activates Shrouded Hunt, and while hunting can activate Shrouded Stalk.
---
Lmao you sound like such an absolute tryhard that you unironacally think this is a competitive game where your 4k is important. Keep on sweating bro can't relax for a second or they'll slip away.
---
This will sound mean. I feel someone either got fired or suspended for this.
---
I struggle to imagine this was a mistake. After last time, the update passed through at least twelve hands.
---
&gt; contains-ghostface-do-not-push-to-live-or-ur-fired-finalversion3-v2-copy.XLSX
---
Hellz yeah. This is dope. I’m also keeping my fingers crossed for Jason eventually, as ridiculous as that sounds I think it will be possible soon. The old dude who was causing all the copyright trouble is meeting with execs either today or tomorrow to hopefully come to an agreement without going back to court. If that’s successful, BHVR could probably pay a license fee to get Jason into the game.
---
Nina West looks great!!
---
Freddy Main
---
On PS4 I don't have to worry about this because I have the extra excuse of atrocious frame drops and generally shitty host internet.
---
And unless all of them were in a chat it wouldn't happen
---
it's not a real Legion cosplay if you don't constantly run into obstacles i guess.
---
I hope they wont have any legal problems because they leaked licensed staff.
---
I too do not read patch notes.
---
I play on PC, I don't care about PS4 or Xbox, I'm just saying you don't deserve anything from the devs.

I was expecting ricardo milos im kinda dissapointed
---
Why am I not getting any bloodpoints for completing a generator in one sitting? New bug brought on by the patch?
---
Another falsehood. That's even less of a reason to nerf the Pig's RBTs will be off by the time the timer hasn't even reached 1 minute.  I must have been playing a different game where escaping through an open door takes multiple minutes, cause in my experience it takes around 15 seconds to get to a door and escape.
---
AHHHHHH!!!!!!!
---
it spawns no matter how many gens are done when there are only 1 person alive
---
Wife &lt;3
---
"i cant abuse his many bugs anymore so he's useless"
---
Dude, that idea was genius xD
---
Most times, she can find and close the hatch faster than I could get a rbt off.
---
Anyone know what the new requirement for the Deranged Pursuit Trophy is?
---
it was obviously a bug since there was nothing about it in patch notes
---
You were not running the whole time right? Maybe killer used some exhaustion addon and it took longer to recover?
---
How you take a question is not up to me bud. Any inference or connotation put in to it is on you. I was merely asking why you cared.

But the vaults are more accurate. Not jerky like before.
---
Now Pig will just facecamp. Problem solved?
---
Dunno. The mtv series didn’t use the Ghostface mask. (At least in seasons 1 and 2, I hear season 3 will use it because it’s gonna reboot the series.)
---
That's a damn shame. I was actually thinking of getting some cosmetics soon. Should I just wait?
---
Having Drew or Rose would be amazing but Drew would be similar to Kate I will like, I would rather have another male Survivor at this point or Rose ( another Nea type character would be fresh)
---
I have gotten merciless five times out of the eight matches I’ve played today. You’re just one of those old legion mains that used franks mix tape every chance you got. Just get good at looping and legion becomes easy b tier.
---
Chucky is capable of many things
---
It was leaked on twitch by a non dev lol.
---
Yet another killer with a better stealth power than  Wraith.
---
*Sad bongs*
---
Where can I find good builds? I'm main survivor and I just use some random perks cuz I have no idea what work together and what not
---
whats Freddy's
---
No
---
I would just like his Party City robes instead of what he's wearing in the leak
---
oh sorry, the dude I replied to is doing exactly what I did here, got into a long argument and its been made clear that they have no valid point. I'm just messing with him.
---
Fuck the 3D beartrap, I want the venus flytrap and the bucket heads
---
Stay out of my basement
---
just normal killer music
---
I-UM CAN exPLAIN
---
Oh yeah I actually really love fathers glasses + mother daughter ring as well. Makes you have to play a lot differently
---
it spawns when 1 person is left no matter how many gens are done. but the killer can close it if they find it first
---
which triggers the end game giving the survivor only 3 minutes left before they die automatically 
---
closing the hatch does power the exit gates though giving the last survivor an alternative way to escape
---
Low tier? You mean broken. He was broken af and i bet you wouldnt like to get Tunneled down either by a killer that abuses game mechanics and broken add-ons
---
I assume it will work like Michael but drastically different such as not just being look at people, fill up bar, kill while bar is full, I expect it to have its reason for being it's own power.
---
I actually don't mind the changes after all, but I don't see why they had to make it so you can no longer see scratches OR blood trails in Frenzy. Confused by that, but meh
---
Legion is still good, albeit he may need some slight changes. The reason he was changed was from how he was expected to be played (apply pressure to survivors and force them to separate) versus how he was actually played (tunnel and have little to no counterplay). Take this from me, a killer main.
---
Omg I might have to actually play pig now despite her trap nerf
---
Wouldn't be a new Killer if he didn't come with atleast one garbage perk.
---
Who gave Jane a chainsaw wtf
---
Legion can't Frenzy their way out of this one.
---
Thats up to you ofcourse. If i was you i wouldn't buy much cosmetics like i did. Just something for a character you really like.
---
Please
---
Not necessarily, if you run between Jigsaw Boxes, she will easily find you since she knows your destination. And that's assuming you aren't that far from the Exit Gate and won't get chased down between attempts or on the way to the Exit. Anyway, none of this really matters anyway since you will get the RBT off with 60 seconds to spare and escape right? So who cares!
---
Typically a graphical bug. If you close the game and reopen it you’ll see your rank didn’t change.
---
And dedicated servers aren't a magic fix to everything  
---
Especially not as they were in the PTB
---
Even killer fogwisperer getting laughed at and ignored ! So sad -.-,
---
Roll on dedicated servers is all I’d say. I don’t think theres an issue with lack of players tbh.
---
No I standed still and exhaustion was permanent and it didnt count down just like permanent. There wasnt that white line which normally would go shorter.
---
[The BHVR twitter said that users saw glimpses of the new chapter.](https://i.imgur.com/kE2a8Ll.jpg) This implies that this will be a full chapter and not a paragraph like with Bill, LF or Ash.
---
so far
---
Idea: The leak is not the final product so it can change? Or the sky is falling
---
I wish I was, it'd give me a lot more free time
---
For everyone who thinks all killer get it, it's only for plague,legion,spirit, and clown.
---
Ok i guess another game breaking bug then.
---
Yes they do.
---
I didn't know there was a perk for erectile dysfunction.
---
I was too. I hooked her and stood in front of her for about ten seconds and then she dc'ed. I wonder if she would've dc'ed even if I hadn't stayed
---
Please, stop talking about dedicated servers. 
---
We all got a glimpse of how bad they are for DBD. I am not looking forward to see them implemented.
---
If we're getting the Saw 3 outfits for Amanda, there'd hope they'll pursue rights for Ghostface's robes and *m a y b e, just maybe* Michael's 2018 mask &amp; coveralls
---
Omg, A person that actually has a life?
---
Is this for real or a really good edit?
---
think I'm just being petty, but it is genuinenly annoying that she has to ruin some of my games, you know?
---
It's in the patch notes
---
Coldwind finally got reworked, yes.
---
killers lose a lot in this patch, and gained nothing really. the timer isn't even fighting back against survivors that take it hostage; they just have a limited time to teabag at the end now. in exchange, a mid tier killer has her power basically removed at the end (Pig's traps), remember me is now shit tier whereas before it worked well with just a few builds, and Legion is basically deleted rather than had an exploit fixed.
---
If you were trapped in the endgame, then you were downed, which means you probably were going to die. Now you get carried to a hook and she sniffs your neck for a while. It's not optimal play but it does get that one kill, and it's a choice most Pig players will make in that situation.
---
If everyone was already wearing hats and the players pushed gens anyway, then they _deserve_ to have a rough endgame.
---
I genuinely don't think anything's been fixed. She's just been invited into the boring gameplay that every other killer already had.
---
Then we will need scarecrow from wizard of oz. Hes one scary mother fycker.
---
????
---
Where did you get this info from?
---
Yeah but its never going to get fixed because its survivors bug.
---
She doesn't get camped in the games I've played with her. She simply dc's the second she gets downed or hooked.
---
They could just make pipping easier. Like if you did one gen and got chased the rest of the time give them a pip. If you never got spotted but you did objectives give them a double pip. A pip for me a pip for you a EVERYBODY PIPS. Idk how many matches we do gens super efficiently and avoid hooks and just safety pip. I'm pretty sure if pipping wasnt so hard I'd be a higher rank.
---
Same thing with bloodpoints. If killer leaves during match you don't receive bp. Commence the dcing from killers till they fix it.

and that, kids, is how i became a 50/50 main. not /s
---
Got ya. I'll take a look and see if they look decent. If not I can wait until they announce a graphical update.
---
Yes the leak means it is one billion percent Set in stone.
---
Unless they have "Thrill of the Hunt" they are not notified of you breaking a dull totem.
---
It is just you friend
---
More like ripoff porky myers.
---
he cannot be viable at all. He needs to be mediocre at best /s
---
For sure it will be faster, question is how much. Fast for bhvr is still counted in months.
---
I had this choice once. I was actually being streamed on twitch by someone spectating me play.
---
Me and 1 other survivor left. 2 gens to go and the other survivor has a head trap on. I stumble across the hatch and I'm sat there debating whether to wait out the hook struggle and then go for the hatch. The hooked survivor was halfway across the map and as it was the pig I wouldn't necessarily know where she was if she was crouched so very risky. 
---
I waited out the struggle. 
---
I'm normally someone that will come back for the last save but the odds were not in our favour there.
---
People on my friends list were on and in matches. I on the other hand couldnt find anything unless I qued as killer.
---
Not a standoff?
---
/u/glenock
---
"He's: Thrill of the Hunt" does. It notified the killer of any totem being touched.
---
I’m at the point where I pipped after every game and it was making me sad cause I play with my friends who aren’t very good (SWF) and we keep getting high level killers cause I’m rank 1 and my friends are all around 11-13... they don’t really enjoy playing with me a whole lot for that reason, and it hurts! I want to kill my rank, but then I’m hurting other survivors’ experience and idk it just sucks sometimes
---
In addition it was a test, you know to see what works.
---
Ha
---
Its not. Thats the whole point.
---
wish this was r/photoshopbattles right now. Would be sick with a more realistic dbd edit cool idea though
---
ofc there playing nurse
---
I did see it and I did have a full body orgasim
---
That's probably true tbh, cheaper for them too!
---
Which is why they were so bad.
---
Bingo
---
Yep.
---
Why not add Charles lee ray who can transfer himself in and out the doll
---
The last line of ToTH says you get a notification of the survivors working on Hex/Lit Totems.
---
Oops I was gonna use that later, not at the beginning of the round.
---
finally they are a thing of the past
---
don't worry ill unhook you and you can take a hit
---
They needed a lot of work.
---
Is this legit or am I dumb?
---
His mask seems small - make it bigger.
---
That's why I said I really, hesitated to tell him to go for it immediately, but at potato ranks no one every heals each other or they spend so long running that self care would have been faster
---
Chess by daylight?
---
When I get one of you I see all of you
---
Ghostface ... how do people not know who ghostface is
---
My bad, I missed the /s
---
I've had it activate on dull totems.
---
Oh really?  I really haven’t even tried
---
Stop vaulting
---
they already had the obvious solution, and that's slowing the EGC timer when a trap is on, just like with hooks and being downed. yet they said screw that, and instead nullified the power of a mid tier paid DLC killer. so good luck getting me to buy "The Ghost" now, BHVR.
---
Well, that's why they made pipping harder. I got into rank 1 first season playing DBD ever. You legit just needed to keep playing enough games and you'd eventually reach it. I'm glad it's harder now. High ranks are not fun and I'm not playing much anymore, green ranks are good fun :)
---
So when are we getting a Scary Movie DLC?
---
why did you go in a locker
---
And he's gonna just be a shitty fusion of the Pig without traps and Micheal without all survivor instadown and enahnced vault speed. Yayyyyy
---
You think so? They put up a developer build, that means the console and their commands were available, also who knows all the datamining stuff that could have been posible.
---
In the right hands we couldve gotten much more info about the game thats not supposed to be known.
---
r/nothingeverhappens
---
That's the plan haha
---
whoever found it first should win, that's how it should've always been
---
Any build strats/add ons that are better than they sound for doctor
---
It took 4 flipping hits to down someone without Frank's. You call that good? Better using M&amp;A and hit with M1. Ffs some killer mains just want braindead things.
---
good teamwork, now i know where you are
---
im tired of shurtless myers, i never laught at it as a meme, it is cringey tbh.
---
The power makes sense because ghostface is a copycat killer
---
Hag will forever be my baby girl. First killer I played and she’s me best one to this day. I don’t care if I get a 4K or 0K, I just want to enjoy a math with my girl.
---
Ah I see.
---
I don't have a incentive to get to red ranks though. I havent heard anything good. I've been told to not go past purple if I want to have fun.
---
apparently, whent hey decided to create EGC, they decided that the existing Freddy rework plans would need further reworking because of it, so it's taking even longer. but they've had a million excuses for their many problems.
---
Now for thr better question, what does he do?
---
yeah he gets thinner near right angles
---
The chapter is roughly 90 days away... Do you truly believe what we saw is his completed mechanic? He didn't even have all 3 perks.
---
So, you'd rather make obviously biased articles that nobody will like?
---
As well as be a terrible journalist?
---
Thanks
---
But Doofy was the killer
---
The Pig is getting cosmetics as well
---
?? when did I call that good? I said Legion's bad and was bad before.
---
Naw it’s braung.

Lol you're good. I could have put lol at the end of it or some such thingy.

I don’t think it will matter, you can still see where everyone is and that’s not going anywhere. Still annoying to go up against.

\^\^Great video on what makes an excellent survivor build
---
Impossible to say. I hope it's Sidney though.
---
That was glorious
---
**GENIUS!!!**
---
Agreed, I’m finding that I’m at a huge disadvantage during end game collapse because literally anything survivors do slows the timer to a crawl. I feel that this toxicity would lessen if survivors couldn’t crawl out of the gate anymore, because every game ends with at least one teabagging survivor getting downed right at the gate then crawling out.
---
Its sad to see the resolution get worse on this art as it gets reused over and over
---
How long does it normally take to fix a loss of progression after posting a support request and giving them the required info?
---
oh my god... shirtless meyers confirmed???  
---
But seriously, long haired meyers in coveralls was so cool in the movie, Id love to see us get that as a cosmetic as a nod to that

2017: the Freddy nerf was good because now you can mind game with the dream transition
---
-survivors who want to make the nerfs seem like a buff 
---
2019: Don’t worry legion is good now because of the +5% speed now. 
---
-Survivors who want to make the nerfs seem like a buff 
---
Some things never change sadly. The only thing to do is not play legion and hope that after 2 years bhvr will reconsider buffing him again.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this was an orginal chapter. Technically at least. I doubt it was easy to get both licenses so I don't think they did. The guy doesn't even look like a person in any of the movies. My guess is that they got the mask rights and are going to rip off the scream movie with the lore. Which I don't mind.
---
Nurses Calling or Discordance?
---
Looks like another gutter trash killer! Get allot like this on PS4 and will have profiles written out similar to shit like this!
---
Territorial Imperative
---
I don't find it disgusting, its just funny to me. When I saw that, my first thot, I mean thought was, "that leg shot wasn't necessary, this chick just wants the attention and she's gonna get it".
---
Blood would just help with tracking, they're not using frenzy to see blood specifically, they're wondering why it was removed because it doesn't really matter now

---
BBQ
---
Why he look like that
---
My animation cut off twice, you can see when my medkit disappears, which I think possibly means the killer animation prevents it.
---
I'd like to see if, you have &lt;20 ping and the killer on voice chat to count you down, that you have enough time to jump in, since the leap animation is about the same length as the closing one.
---
Exactly and uninstall the game so we don’t have to deal with morons like this guy!
---
RP anyone? 🤤
---
bingo
---
She still appears during flashbacks in some other movies. Also, I'm pretty sure her hair was long in the third movie.
---
Just put a stepladder next to the hooks
---
Played a bit and, while footsteps are still mostly gone, I can hear hurt Survivors again!
---
It's not like they can hide this, might as well play into it.
---
Elaborate ?
---
technically both but it's more discordance
---
Yes, but the programmers work on the new gameplay elements AND the bugfixes. New DLC doesn't just consistent of new cosmetics. That is why I *specifically* said "new DLC" and not "new cosmetics". Adding new gameplay elements simply only delays bugfixes.
---
Speculated release was may 28 for PBE NOT FINAL RELEASE. So yeah they really fucked up big.
---
Honestly? No idea. Making him be able to inflict dying in feral frenzy would just be back to the old cancer. Giving him the vault speed in frenzy back would be... a start but he'd still be terrible. Making him faster than 115 is unprecedented, scary territory. BHVR designed a killer who is hard to make both good and fun. Right now he's really neither, he's not good and it's still not fun to spend a good chunk of the match mending.
---
Thanks for pointing out you have no balls and are a major dipshit.
---
taadaa
---
Yes that’d be great, the mask in 2 is really awesome. I also would love Chop-Top to be a survivor or something but that would never happen lmao.
---
I think I’ll look around for a bit first. I’ll keep in touch if I can’t find anything
---
Great! I and many people I know have being asking for and waiting for ghost face. So, does he call the survivors and ask them what their scary movie is?
---
Can't wait to be working a gen or moving around the map and seeing that face lean around a corner looking at me.
---
When?
---
I don’t think anyone actually finds it funny and the only reason they post it/mention it is to make karma.
---
It’s not about saving them for endgame. It’s about clutch potential if you can’t use them before then. If the survivors gen rush and you still have a trap or two it forces them to stay in the match and deal with it. For a Killer that has poor chase potential and little map pressure, the Pig *needs* that endgame clutch potential. This makes her easily one of the worst Killers in the game, arguably on par with the Wraith and *quite* arguably worse.
---
Why did you try to run up to her knowing nurse could close it anyway....?
---
The only cosmetic the character ACTUALLY needs
---
Where classic Freddy at tho
---
ghostface is so boring. they'd better not.
---
I agree heavily! We need and deserve ghost sheet Myers, and original Freddy would be so cool.
---
#WAZZZZZZAAAAAAPPPP
---
As a meg main I'm offended
---
OMG YASSSS
---
It says in the description that it changes the obsession to whoever unhooks the survivor.
---
I'll send you a copy!
---
because it doesn't actually contribute anything, this ain't facebook
---
Just write "Cat eating fries" on Google lol.
---
This is what red rank survivors on PS4 look like huh
---
spooky
---
*BAM*
---
Here I am bitch!!
---
That’s the numbers I wanna see? How many people actually are on and playing, 7 days worth and showing how many each day, split into categories for PC, PS4 and then Xbox and show a months worth of data. Don’t wanna see a bullshit stat about players liking the opera who cares!
---
Just binge all four :D
---
It's a comment section.
---
dont be toying with me boy.
---
On the bright side, you can still play frank's mix tape legion and have people dc.
---
it didnt ruin my game tho?
---
If they could get one Campbell’s likeness, I’m holding out they can get another’s
---
😂
---
Wait, you don't like mending but are you okay with just sitting at a gen for 80 seconds? Imo the problem isn't the killer but the Lack of things to do.
---
Jupp. Humans want to reproduce.    "Pretty" people will always get more attention.
---
No, the green was the acid. He wasn’t bleeding (yet) as he was too busy shedding his skin. It’s an unfortunate side effect of being pumped full of acid.
---
you're right. I'm actually very partial to Scream 4 :P
---
lol you made me look! So 2 points in your favor.
---
I've been waiting for Sidney Prescott since I got this game, guess I'm skipping this DLC lol
---
This game is hell for killers at low ranks (survivor main). You get at least 1 hate mail regardless of how you play. Like literally. I had a game where I played no perk Wraith and some guy called me a try hard because I kept banging the bell lol
---
It's a leak from a devs build of the game
---
Okay. When I was in frenzy I never paid attention. Blood after I ended frenzy was easier for me to see.
---
I'm sorry, but he looks like shit. I think it works have been better if it was just the OG all black cloak.
---
Seems to me it's just hype to overshadow the reaction to patch updates. These leaks have definitely been planned.
---
But I'm bad and too lazy to give my absolute best, that's why sometimes tryhard survivors or killers trigger me. They play it so competitively and I'm just trying to have a good time.
---
Because they haven't buffed borrowed time enough yet. The basement isn't even dangerous anymore.
---
Randy Meeks. Jesus Christ people.
---
Yea I would've just walked away and done gens until the killer left the hatch or I had them done
---
Nurse is immune to scams because she is the true nigerian prince
---
Randy.
---
That'd be my guess.
---
He was in the “bending down to remove his leg from the trap” animation, he probably didn’t even notice
---
It’s been a while since I’ve seen Saw but didn’t Amanda wear that kind of outfit so it’s not that crazy to get actual licensed outfits that they’ve worn
---
Darn.
---
Wonder what his ability would be
---
It's not needed. Sure I guess it sucjs the one in one thousand games someone tries to hold hostage, but did BT need another buff?
---
I mean id be bored out of my mind facecamping someone but if you enjoy it cool id rather just play another match
---
I might be being dumb but, is there any kind of thing to prove this is real. As much as I would like to believe this its kinda hard with noticing things like rank 13 but devotion level 1, or how hes level 1 but has Iridescent shards and I know shards were out before the leveling system but my original point still stands.
---
Myers is still scarier because Spine Chill chuckles at this.
---
okay thanks ill delete and reupload later
---
Yeah, I think the look with the leather jacket is based off the picture I posted. Main post is definitely based off her Saw 3 look, with some weird sleeves added to conceal her knife.
---
I didn't say I would rather nothing. But I think it would make the community happier if a new release included both new killer and a survivor
---
BT has no bearing on this. And I love bringing survivors to the basement. It's a huge boost. Seriously you're upset you can't block people in the basement with your body any longer. That's not ok.
---
&gt; and one with a hand pump and tube to make blood flow on the mask.
---
I had one of those :D The pump was a heart
---
Ohp, tea
---
But stabby boi 🔪
---
I suppose so. I think its the stripy design on his hood that gets me. Just looks kinda weird. Although I also think its weird that Freddy has a black and red sweater rather than a green and red one, so maybe I'm just nitpicky lol. Either way I'm just glad ghostface is in. I've wanted him for ages
---
This might be from one of the franchise's copious flashbacks.
---
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Ah the Entity found pigions.
---
This is an English subreddit. But I guess I hope someone can reply back to you in your language lol.
---
Gotta say, not a fan of his outfit I’ll be honest. his black robes would’ve been better.
---
Pax was so lit
---
They said the same with ash
---
This is pretty spot on. They just feel... clunky to play. Especially those vault speeds. The changes are all small but together they straight up ruin the power. If they could revert the vault speed I would be happy.
---
hatch used to be a test of patience(unless the killer finds the survivor before they find the hatch or the survivor fucks up)
---
now it's just an "on" switch for noed, rancor, cypress moris, remember me, etc.
---
I have literally no idea what you're talking about here. 10-40 seconds don't really matter when all you have to do to pause it is be in the general vicinity of the killer and takes like 5 seconds to heal after. The pig's still got a bit of RNG to it, and can't just be mended anywhere. 
---
/u/Peanits I don't mean to tag and pester you, but I'm genuinely confused as to how Deep Wound is supposed to be beneficial now. I also don't understand the decision to hide the timer, considering he's the only killer with a timer-tied ability that doesn't get to see the timer. How is he *supposed* to be played now, then? And not just 'work for the kill'
---
Best girl.
---
I like the idea of a lovecraftian killer that you can't look at, otherwise it will obscure your vision and give away your position to the killer. The Dimensional Shambler from Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game would make an excellent edition to the DbD family, but its' model might not be human enough for the devs to do.
---
Fuck
---
Yeah but that’s if they use the flashlight. They can just not use it and be fine. With Franklin’s, not even white wards can help you keep your flashlight
---
Other than trading in your snowball potential, since his terror radius disappears when he crouches he's probably gonna have the normal terror radius versus Mikey's 16m in T2. He'll also probably move slower while crouched.
---
So you're trading late game potential to smooth out your early game, and an unclear effect on the mid-game. Probably depends on how fast the crouch walk is and how fast the stalk builds up. And if you can build your stalk normally or if you have to crouch for it.
---
If you can't block to wait out borrowed time it does have bearing. In over a thousand hours I have never seen anyone block people in the basement and hold then hostage. I'm sure it happens, but the fix doesn't have to hurt normal gameplay.
---
No, but I’m hoping (more so wishful thinking) that it’ll encourage BHVR to focus more on actually making a deal than they were before.
---
This isn't about fun. DbD is srs Business dammit. 4k or nothing! Get out as survivor in 4 minutes or less or nothing!
---

---
Again !!
---
...Do you want to give people alcohol poisoning? Because this is how you do it.
---
I guess it's not BP event anymore so the douchebags should be within normal bounds.
---
I am not sure if this are new
---
Found this 2 in the offerings folder
---
Why does he look like Mortal Kombat DLC
---
Yeah, because the killer's supposed to close it, because you can't grab anymore.
---
It's pretty weird game design for the killer to just AFK body block.
---
HA, I crack my finger before turning on my xbox!
---
None of my survivors are prestiged and I don't have Mettle of Man. I generally play Bill with DS/Dead Hard/BT/Unbreakable. I don't try super hard, I never bring items in. Take all that as you will.
---
If I had to guess, probably for balance reasons. Some people already find it difficult to spot Michael, now imagine trying to spot Michael but he is all black
---
Shut up and take my money, BHVR! I want this!
---
I don’t do it often, but when I do it’s because the killer was a camper or tunneler and overall a dick. If it’s a good match, I try and be respectful
---
AFAIK it wasn't "headshots" but it was dedicated server code or whatever accidentally ending up making your hatchet hits count twice (one for the client thing, one for the server) and thus instadown.
---
You right! DbD is a hardcore eSports!!!  
---
We should go full sweat 120% of the time!
---
This is what im looking at,  1 picture was a streamer the other my ps4 upload to youtube. https://imgflip.com/gif/30e57f   The one is so much brighter and clearer.
---
damn man it aint that serious.... unless youre that dude on twitter who was milking how he gets to make the announcment
---
I have so much fun playing doc but I’m absolutely awful with him.
---
because they are massive assholes and possibly douches as well
---
How big of a deal would it even be if a killer was hard to see?
---
i'm getting destroyed as Spirit too if i don't play like an asshole. she doesn't have enough mobility on red ranks to lay off and play chill.
---
Pretty sure the first is just the in-game image of a crow, but I am not 100%.
---
Standing there for 45 minutes waiting for the other player to press a button is a very fun and engaging experience
---
Yeah but now the killer could literally force survivors to be sacrificed this way due to the end game. It had to be necessary to prevent that.
---
😩
---
Wait is there actually leaks for cosmetics if so are there pics someone can link?
---
'...people'? 
---
This is for my friends and I haha
---
If you're last survivor good luck escaping through gates when killer closes hatch.
---
I absolutely love this, but I wish that the main outfit was a bit more black than grey.
---
Using your power as wraith = tryhard noob 
---
But yeah I'm just as much survivor as killer but I've given up trying to figure out what survivors actually want from me. I don't camp or tunnel, I only use ruin on a few killers and noed on one (freddy) but win or lose they're pissed off.
---
It's simpler as survivor, generally the killer just wants me dead and that's more or less it
---
I'd be happy if they just reverted the vaulting change.
---
&gt; I switched psn messages back on 
---
Literally just rent time with a dominatrix. You can ask for the specific kind of punishment you want.
---
Love,
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Someone who also tried that for a few days.
---
not really, but i find satisfaction in knowing that im more patient than the other player. it's one of those experience that actually is about the reward rather than the journey
---
its a bad/ cringey and normie meme, its worst than a instagram meme if im being honest
---
Probably just a placeholder
---
Doctor. Just remove his power altogether. Thanks.
---
straight to hell
---
WAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAPPPPPPP
---
why does bhvr force us into high ranks?
---
Or just turn off collision if the killer doesn't move a certain distance after 30 seconds or so. Like survivors with crows, but with reduced time.
---
DC gets punished with de-rank. tbh, it also punishes those who get sacrificed first.
---
He as a costume similar to S1 Slasher's killer.
---
WASAAAAAAAAAAP
---
And ruthless nurse mains breed toxic survivors. Endless circle.
---
Glad he's being reworked because his aura reading is bs for people that like to actually juke instead of pallet looping.
---
that's nea !!
---
I don't like his outfit that much too. It's too close from the legion but at least we will get to play him.
---
Ugh...
---
legion ist still dumb and now is even worse to play against cause he just hits once in frenzy and then tunnels you until he downs you
---
If I catch you on a generator, I will camp you, scum.
---
but heres a problem, some people dont constantly want to be in red ranks, they just end up there no matter what they do, and they would have to throw games to not get there.
---
I’m also interested to know. At first I interpreted it as a widening of the basement staircase so that survs could just walk around, but I misread. I imagine it would be something similar to whatever happens when a killer is body blocking but then uses an attack?
---
We will live, They will die
---
The change to the Deranged Pursit achievement is pretty major, wow
---
*0.9 meters.
---
P.S. I can't believe you STILL don't use metric. What if every country was as "special" as America and used its own measurements
---
Plot twist: this is just so the pig mains don’t get mad about the EGC nerfs
---
Ahhh, I forgot!
---
I played against 4 legions in a row and got out each time. I actuslly like his playstyle now though its more fun to go against. Every legion i went against wasnt just trying to spam feral frenzy and moonwalking etc.
---
That would be terrifying especially in places like the game map
---
im really looking forward to another stealthy killer
---
Nah.
---
2018 Myers (with matching music?) could happen, though!
---
That's still more than enough time to force survivors to die in the end game.
---
no worries ! regardless it looks awesome
---
And I get scared when I turn around and see a whole ass Michael staring at me. Seeing this ghost will scare me more if I don't notice right away
---
Have to disagree there, they are better than they've ever been before.
---
Its actually 2 minutes not 2 seconds
---
The new killer seems really underwhelming, nothing too new.  
---
Incredibly similar to Michael and has some Pig-like stealth mechanics.
---
Omg your name has RAT in it.  Not even a little surprised.

YES

I run it seriously with say DH and both the "Faster" perks. You can pop gens real fast with all those greats.

The sleeves were on her shirt in Saw 1 when she was in the RBT. So its like a mesh of saw 1 &amp; 3 outfits
---
I think he might be a higher tier
---
I love getting good scares as a killer. You always know when you do and it's a wonderful feeling
---
Coxcombed Clapper + the beast on Lery’s is an awesome stealth combo for wraith. Basically a much faster scratched mirror myer’s with no wall hacks.
---
Yeah cause facecamping people who are talking to each other is a good strategy, only randoms are dumb enough to try to unhook while killer is camping.
---
What are you doing on your high horse?
---
*laughing in Infectious Fright Nurse*
---
Outside of accounting on BHVR's part and of course personal and commercial licensing issues, there is no reason to not have cosmetics for killers. 
---
The same folks that licensed Halloween (Compass/Trancas) also control the rights to Halloween 4 and 5 and could authorize those masks for Myers to use. The other titles are controlled by Miramax, Lantern Capital Partners and the latest film by Universal (they also have exclusive to Halloween II - 1981) so deals could be worked out to include them all. Those would sell well.
---
End Game Collapse is a new game mechanic. It's here to stay. It's not an event.
---
Shouldn't?
---
Please BHVR, give us an option in the cosmetic store to mix and mash different clothing pieces (esentially allowing us to look at a combination of clothing items on our character, so we can decide better if we want to buy it or not), it's annoying not being able to see how some cosmetic items will look combined with others. 
---
This was just an example of a P3 head of Jane on her lovely upcoming outfit. Just let us do this in the store so we don't have to do this funny craftwork in Photoshop.
---
Yup 😂
---
Agreed, like create an outfit then chose if you wanna buy it.
---

Sorry

---
You're right, extremely good Billys are a really tough opponent.  
---
But if you look into an extremely good Billy against a good SWF that's actually trying(even though they extremely rare, so is the Billy we're talking about), the Billy will get looped for a really long time by each person he'll be chasing, unless found in a complete dead-zone.  
---
Billy's chainsaw and mindgames can be "countered" in a sense, by predicting what he's going to do after seeing his playstyle for a little bit.
---
*Toxic nurse main.
---
Well, unless she actually hit them. Hit them with the hatchet, they get the little boost and you switch direction and they run straight into you if the keep looping or they run away from the loop entirely allowing you to aim another hatchet
---
Exploiting = looping
---
Bruh, BRUH
---
Mind game them or Move on to the next person if you can't them
---
Wasting time is your own fault, you can catch them another time
---
Or run better perks
---
Or JUST

PLAY

Dead by Daylight community: "Now that we have Legion, a Killer that wears a hood and a mask who runs fast and stabs people, there's no way we could get Ghostface, a Killer that wears a hood and a mask who runs fast and stabs people."
---
Behavior 6 months later: "Here's Ghostface, a Killer who wears a hood and a mask and *doesn't* run fast and stab people."
---
I have a friend who thinks Legion and Ghostface should have their powers swapped and I honestly agree with them. Legion being a bunch of delinquent teenagers it makes a lot more sense for them to be a lot more careful with their actions as they don't want to get caught sneaking out of class and breaking into places to steal shit. Ghostface, meanwhile... have you seen the first Scream movie?
---
Exactly, it would esentially just be a virtual "changing room" where you can just try all the pieces and make cool combinations.
---
My man
---
I'm on xbox so the experience could be different. But toxic survivors ratios compared toxic killers I would say is about 100:1, if that.
---
This is it! This is what I was waiting for.  
---
Now I can finally put my 20 years of competitive chess practice to use!
---
So on a bullshit level would you rate him acceptable? Or do you think people will still DC against him.
---
Rbt at exit gate change is rubbish, only serves to force people to play a certain way, and is completely against her character.
---
No, this is Patrick
---
...  So...  The match is unfair...  If the killer gets a single kill?
---
I was about to ask the same thing. Just got out of a game where I got gold lightbringer but only just over 2K points for objectives. If it’s intentional it’s a garbage change, so I hope it’s a bug.
---
i'm really liking this game lol
---
No u
---
Probably gonna stab you a few times.

The beginning was me apologizing for saying mean things about the Spirit because I was tilted lol
---
I'd rate him more than acceptable.  
---
People will DC against him as much as they DC against any killer, though.
---
Borrowed time
---
I may get downvoted but I really don't see the point in adding him (mostly bc of his power). Just could've made a new character with a new power, not 2 old powers in one. And I know that the community keeps drilling them about Ghostface so there's that too.
---
Yeah it’s pretty unfair for someone to load onto a game just to get camped and killer without really getting to play
---
Ace mains would like to know your location
---
I bring Myers scratched with franklins, knockout, ruin, and moniter all to the game. Its beautiful.
---
I seriously hope its Brenda tbh...
---
First of all she made the scary movies funny asf.
---
Second She is funny asf
---
3rd One of her perks could be where you push your own teammate to survive or you slap the killer😂💀💀
---
I’m not seeing anything....
---
Devs said it would be a few days
---
Blood warden (?)
---
Ok but apparently Claudette can’t blend her eyeshadow sooooo
---
Ha! You think your bodyblocking can stop me?
---
RIP remember me  
---
ill remember you...
---
By the looks of it there won't be a survivor with him, but then again it's not a finished dlc so maybe they didn't even make one yet for all we know
---
Report for sandbagging, you mean?  
---
I believe you need a video proof(not sure though).
---
#BrutalKiller
---
I'm downloading it power cycle your Xbox
---
I'd rather run the ghost so they dont even have a clue you're coming, Perfect for yoinks.
---
MAKE HIM ABLE TO USE THE LOCKERS! HIDE INSIDE OR TELEPORT FROM ONE TO ANOTHER  xD
---
Imagine Dwights entering a locker with Ghostface inside :D Insta mori
---
That seems rather odd. The license holder himself tweeted he was very excited.
---
And why would BHVR get the rights to the mask but not to the full black gown? That doesn't seem like logical thinking at all.
---
May be an unpopular opinion, but there really isn’t anything to scary about ghost face.
---
No other killer has that so no I don’t think that. Plus that’s what track markers are for. Hunting ain’t easy
---
No u^2
---
Ya darn right.
---
Honestly he probably keeps doing it because people are stupid and keep trying to unhooked camped survivors.
---
When I get camped and am playing with friends, I literally just say go finish the gens I'll be chillin here for the mext 2 minutes.
---
Done and done I get camped and everyone else leaves
---
Pretty much. I really wanted this update to just expedite games that are already decided because it sucks to hang around, win or lose, on both sides of the game.
---
My friends already DC enough as it is just to get into the next match. :/
---
How how are they supposed to bounce off survivors then? That’s the point of their power
---
Please god let this be real this is all I’ve ever wanted I’m so hype
---
Wow its almost like... *That's the joke*
---
im basically a survivor main who likes to run behind the killer, ao if he was crpuching arounf and junk id probably be right behind him XD
---
I really don't think Ghostface reduces Michael's strengths at all. Michael is not to be messed with, and Tier 3 lunge and vault speed is terrifying. And yeah, Tier 1 Myers is still the stealthiest killer in the game.
---
The ghostface mask and name are different from the Scream licensing.
---
they can already track that though
---
Further context: I was just enjoying a match when the Endgame Collapse started. Checked the first gate which was being camped by A Legion, so I go to the other gate and find the three survivors sitting there at the entrance in a line. They blocked me just until they could get out but just before I could.
---
Updated, got tunneled, slugged, booted up another game.
---
Wow guess you and three other people missed the 
---
/s huh?
---
Mad grit, for the basement builds.
---
I'd love a pre-film non-sleepy Quentin too but main focus is Speedo Quentin.
---
I like all of them, but I think most likely it will be either Sidney or Gale Weathers.
---
Been a Quentin main myself since he released. Quentin is best boy.
---
Good job dude.
---
With these consistent leaks I’m not entirely convinced it’s not just marketing to stew up hype.
---
Just make it tick slower the closer you are, if they're face camping it'll move but it'll be slow and if they're a decent distance then it'll go about normal
---
Here, have another ticket to Downvote Town.
---
\*bringeth
---
You uneducated swines.
---
I honestly did not know that! Thanks for the heads up:)
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Exactly. Hence why I’m so surprised it isn’t in the game as it is one of his main outfits in the movie.
---
That neck tho.  Wear a sweater or something Ace, your stitches are shoeing.
---
How are they, I main legion on console and I'm a little worried that they might be bad
---
Unless you like Legion, then everyone hates you :(
---
I've also seen someone on the subreddit state that a "fog whisperer (won't mention name) confirmed there would only be a killer added". I don't know if they were supposed to give that info, but I also don't know how accurate it may be.
---
I see people complaining to complain. I wasn't aware that the central point of the basement builds was to stand in the basement stairs. I was under the impression if you have a couple of survivors there you smack one down, the other runs through you and you down the other eventually. Now you smack them as they run through you anyway.
---
This disturbs me more than any horror movie has...
---
PC I guess, OP mentioned Steam
---
The top is a combination of both movie outfits.
---
It basically looks like her red t-shirt with the large neckline from Saw 3, with the separated sleeves from her outfit in the original Saw.
---
Make it be terror radius out of chase and lose it in chase.  Easy fix to make the perk actually useful.
---
https://www.deviantart.com/muhut/art/Sexy-Roadhog-615244938 
---
this as killer pls
---
I'd probably guess more so on a high school or Woodsboro map
---
Incorrect. 
---
This outfit is from the first SAW where Amanda is in a reverse bear trap.
---
I love it so much.
---
&gt;Reply
---
I hope they dont gut any of his stealth abilities, bhvr has a habit of making stealth killers but going "well what if we made them like, half stealthy"
---
My diet consists on eating inmense amounts of wood planks
---
No one actually likes The Game, okay?  
---
This Billy had gone through a rough day.
---
That would actualy be a buff.
---
It's just a little insurance to protect killers being held hostage by survivors refusing to open Gates and prolong the trial to their hearts content. This hardly happened but it's just a quick fix to save headache so here it is
---
While I feel like camping should be punished more and moving away from the hook should be rewarded more - I don't think this is the right way to go about the issue.
---
Yay! Thanks Behavior. 😊
---
Honestly I'll probably get jumped by this guy too, sometimes I'll beindingy business and just turn and see Michael half way behind a tree staring and it gets me sooo
---
Twitch Streamer BTW
---
I've been playing the last hour or so and haven't had any issue getting into a lobby as survivor. Max wait has been 2-3 minutes maybe? Hopefully you'll be able to play soon.
---
That’s adorable
---
That sounds like a fun mini game in a open source game creator kind of way. Would be trash if it was the main game though.
---
Ghost is probably the one I’m thinking of
---
why does he look like hes from an assassins creed game? I dont remember ghost face looking like that lol
---
do you guys think rj knows yet?
---
1 guy dced on the basement camp and my friend died first hook FeelsSadMan
---
Thank you for the response. Hopefully if everyone hates it, they will listen and make adjustments or change it back.
---
I know the normal one is on 2 minutes, but in this case they made a slight mistake :D
---
This is something that has bugged me ever since they added the store. Why can't we combine cosmetic pieces in the store before we buy them?
---
When are we getting shirtless leatherface and shirtless myers
---
Because the mask is licensed to funworld and the ghostface costume (classic) by Lantern Entertainment. 2 different owners. Thats why
---
If they're afk on hatch go do gens
---
They aren't done to be fair, it might play a little different than it seems as well once there's game play
---
I’m so uncomfortable
---
Imo, once it starts just wait for them to leave unless you started it.
---
Yeah, I like his current kit much more. I'd still like to see him able to hide in lockers and peek out to stalk people.
---
Oh wow, I feel like an idiot now.
---
Its still 2 minutes even though it says 2 seconds
---
Thank you
---
No, I don't think she's that powerful, but something definitely had to change there. Slowing down the timer immensely with a trap on would have helped, or keep the terror radius trap thing.
---
Tbh the new standoff would be to go to the gates and wait. Killer finds hatch. He closes it, you're right there to leave the gates. Killer leaves hatch to go look for you, you can go rush it and jump in. 
---
I still like the change though. ANYTHING is better than sitting on the hatch and "Whoever clicks first, loses" (Killer hits first, you jump in. You jump in first, killer grabs.)
---
This art is actually amazing
---
FeelsBadMan

I don't know why there's been so many non-confident Billies lately.

Judging by [leaks from a long time ago](https://imgur.com/a/kZfs6nj) the Survivor will probably be Sidney, seeing as the (test?) name for the new map is "Sidney's House."
---
Accidentally OMEGALUL
---
All these artworks look phenomenal, I honestly can't wait for the jane outfit.
---
Luck also affects your luck with removing reverse bear traps and with the Trappers traps.
---
Welp Doctor will Ace this.
---
Great, new ways for people to be toxic... just what the DBD community needs.
---
bro its just an empty killer slot I don't see anyone there
---
I really hope they update the model, I thought it was fanmade at first tbh.

---
Theres only 2 Killers with a timer as part of their ability
---
3 if you count the Plague's infection
---
and her and The Pig cannot see the timer/meter
---
Legion was the exception and now they match the other 2
---
I honestly thought that Legion was more based on character from The Purge movies, but I see now that it really could be a case of "A little from column A and a little from column B".
---
I kinda figured it would be xD
---
You're right, we haven't seen gameplay yet.  
---
I hope it'll turn out better than how it seems now.
---
He also has the ability to lean around corners. Imagine that... you're working on a gen at Gideon meat plant and you look down the hall and you see nothing but Ghostface's face peeking at you from around the corner. 2spooky
---
Myers already has more waifu power than Amanda. How many times you seen someone ask for shirtless Pig compared to shirtless Myers.
---
just a little tip, try to keep moving when you have some distance from the killer instead of waiting for him to come to the pallet and throwing it, that way your chases are gonna be way longer and you can make better use of pallets. :)
---
I see spirit and her had a girls night out
---
u/not_Queen_bhvr
---
Well. Some killers being within the radius helps the survivor like with Pig rbt. So no terror radius means no help with the meter on rbt anymore.
---
Probably not all though.
---
Good point
---
wasnt the entire outfit just a generic black robe though? I dont think anyone owns that
---
Yes pls
---
Enduring.
---
How dare you make me eat immense amounts of wood planks!
---
Calling blocking any survivor movement as a "tool" is laughable.
---
Just try power begone! Watch! The 9 second battery life died in 3 seconds! Available now at Walmart!
---
Honestly Anne Aesthetic may be a better drag name for nurse than doctor but they both work. Maybe Anne Aesthetic and Steph O'Scope
---
Think about how he would look if he was shirtless, you'll have problems not getting horny after that one
---
but hes supposed to be a stealth killer
---
Is that the case? I could've sworn I've seen the timer as them before. Perhaps I've been mistaken, then. My b. My confusion about what Deep Wound is good for now still stands.
---
Brutal strength
---
Because you're a bitch
---
Lmfao! Ahahaha!
---
But you want something as goofy as shirtless Myers.
---
And how would that work out with End Game Collapse active now? There's no hatch standoffs anymore.
---
Daddy quinton-San
---
Your mom
---
I will be a pig main forever. I just love playing her, no matter how low she is in the meta
---
Depends on how long it takes to get exposed on your target, tbh
---
Correct. They contain fiber, to make you strong and catch up those sneaky survivors.
---
Found the toxic tbagger
---
Where are all my Mirage die-hards that know we are one of the weakest legends yet we continue to play what we love? One day, my brethren, we will rise!
---
I dunno if there's much reward. After 5 minutes I let them get the hatch because fuck waiting at that point. I've seen HOURS long standoffs and fuck that shit. The bloodpoints gained by sacrificing the last guy is less than letting them get hatch, queuing up a new match, and playing that. I still participated in standoffs as doctor (who used to be god tier at grabbing in shock mode) but after a certain length of time waiting just wasn't worth it.
---
Well, yeah. If the killer has managed to destroy your entire team, AND finds the hatch first, he kind of deserves the win.
---
If Dead Hard activates, and exhausts, but doesn't stop a killer slash, do I get refunded the exhaustion or should I be dead harding early to avoid this?
---
I stunned Leatherface with a pallet, and got the associated bloodpoints for Killer Stunned, but I didn't hear the cry of pain and only saw him chainsaw it. Is that because he already started swinging wildly, and so stuns aren't great against Bubba?
---
dunno, there are some dirty loops on which it takes ages to get the survivor... imo those are boring as survivor and killer.
---
but obviously it would be stupid to just run away in a straight line.
---
This just punishes the killer when all 3 survivors camp the hook themselves.
---
If everyone is hiding next to the hook, there is ZERO reason for the killer to leave the hook.
---
This forces him to leave to stare at a wall and give a feee uncontested hook or just forces a hook standoff where both parties hold the game hostage much like the hatch.
---
How you deal with campers is by gen rushing them. You punish them for doing it.
---
If a killer is killing multiple survivors by camping them all, the survivors are to blame for feeling entitled to unhooking their friend and not doing gens. This rewards the killer for camping and encourages him to keep doing it as opposed to punishing him for it.
---
If every killer only got 1k for face camping each round because they got gen rushed during the camp time, they'd stop doing it in mass.
---
But when survivors bitch about a 'camper' and focus on saving their friend and get themselves downed too in the process, they reward the killer for camping and help justify his camping as a good tactic to get free kills on dumb survivors.
---
Damn, you're right. At least there's one gown that kinda looks like the original.
---
I think it's partly intentional?
---
HAAAA
---
 Not sure if it’s on YouTube it was from a developer stream back in October.
---
Can someone explain to me how exactly they died what killed them and why did the entity do that when he was just standing there?
---
I love this post and the comments. Fcking hillarious 😂
---
i literally send a love letter to all good Nurses on PS4. Suck their dick dry because that takes patience and skill
---
There was a leak a while back that showed Sidney’s name w the survivors so now we know this is true, I’ll try to find it
---
Devs addressed that saying something in the lines of "We whish it was that easy" because it can't just be random, it needs to be on specific places in the texture with specific sizes that makes it look good
---
"leaks"
---
Yeah, I agree with all of what you said above, those are great points. He’s definitely strong if you know how to play him correctly. And his add-ons can completely change his play style and are fun to experiment with. 
---
However, I would say that’s true about most of the killer’s powers and their add-ons. An example would be Trapper and his add-ons. If you use the ultra-rare add-on iridescent stone. He no longer really has to care about laying traps and can focus on just chasing after survivors. He also can then change his perks to more of a chase style build (brutal strength, save the best for last, enduring, spirit fury). 
---
I would also say that it is true that a good Myers knows when to activate his tier 3. Would you say that it’s any different than a good hillbilly knowing when to chainsaw and when to bait? I would say it’s about the same level of skill and timing involved. 
---
If I could compare it to anything, it would be a skilled Plague knowing when to activate Corrupted Vile
---
The difference is that one requires the usual M1 hit and relies on the basic M1 killer tactics, while the other can’t down, which there is some skill required to aim and hit with the ranged attack.
---
Again, I still think Myers is a good, powerful killer, no doubt. I think he just is easier to master/become good at compared to some of the other killers, which is why I recommend OP start with him or Clown.
---
Not wrong maybe its like 20 secs or lower.
---
Not a single person uses this.
---
Not so sure it was "accidental" or deliberate to keep us playing this bug, no wait "game" 😂
---
Would love Halloween 2018's grimy mask, but also the battered [hobo mask](https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Halloween-2-2009.jpg?w=1122&amp;ssl=1) from Zombie's H2, or any of the awful ones from the late sequels like [Ressurection](https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Halloween-Resurrection.jpg?w=1480&amp;ssl=1). Bonus points if they include the hilariously bad [CGI Mask](https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Halloween-H20-cgi-2.jpg?w=612&amp;ssl=1) from H20, or for fun the [joke](https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Halloween-5-brute.jpg?w=649&amp;ssl=1) mask from H5, the [prison breakout](https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutterstock_5884701n.jpg) outfit from RZ1, or the [bandages](http://content7.flixster.com/photo/10/92/24/10922429_gal.jpg) from H4.

Shhhhh survivor mains and their entitlement are going to be here soon.

Quintin is a twink, not a daddy XD

Dbd just got scary again
---
Emotes? Voicelines?   
---
P3 being able to overlay over an cosmetic????????????
---
no a killer wouldnt have only 1 perk, they just didnt make any new perks yet
---
I've had this happen as Spirit, I think it's just her passive phasing animation, as the game zooms into her pov, her head is tilted for a split second. It's weird. As for the bumping into stuff, things can have really odd hitboxes sometimes....
---
Which guy? I'm totally unaware of this...

He’s speaking the language of gods
---
Maybe people are screaming because it needs to be fixed? They still havent gotten the sound and lighting near the quality it was before the engine update, let alone fix loading screen crashes for the most part.
---
It would encourage ppl to cleanse totems that are not ruin or NOED
---
You know what's crazy this happened to me as Myers a few days ago . Tilted screen
---
Wait a minute... That means the legion changes are here.... I'm not ready
---
Saving this picture
---
Was it on this map?
---
they do, you cant play unranked, and personally no matter how I play killer I always end up in red ranks, unless I intentionally throw games, which I don't want to do, because that's not even playing the game at that point
---
There is still what, 2-3 months to go until we are suppose to get the new chapter right? It could be that the build they accidentally pushed to live which included the new killer and pig cosmetics just didn't include the new survivor. We will just have to wait and see who it will be.
---
I love the game as Billy. 4k every time. People dont know how to use him if they cant sprint cross map
---
Oh yeah. T1 Myers is probably the only killer that Spine Chill does not work against. At all. He's the only killer I get scared of.
---
Terror radius changes has no effect on me otherwise for other killers/perks because spine chill can see through all that.
---
Survs tbagging at the exit gate then the killer NOEDs them.
---
People cant take a fucking joke smh...
---
Your mom sucks dicks
---
A* not the
---
My guess for your description is Make Your Choice?
---
Well it says Ghostface can only apply the exposed effect to one survivor at a time by stalking; sounds like Michael is still better because the smaller terror radius and his tier 3 effects the entire team. The crouching will definitely make for some good jump scares though! Who knows for sure though, hopefully we have more solid info soon
---
*nods in killer*
---
This. The only killers I don't like playing as and against are Freddy and Trapper and I ended up narrowing down exactly why. It's fucking RNG. I've always hated RNG in games. Both sides. When I get a cheesy win that I didn't deserve. That's boring. When I get absolutely stomped on because I tried a hundred and fifty million times and my opponent tried once and got it, that's frustrating. I hate Fire Emblem, but love Advance Wars. Same reasoning. 
---
RNG is shitty.       
---
Pig is RNG too, but I place an exception on her because it feels less like RNG and more like actually looking for a key. It's still chance, but not as dumb as your character being physically incapable of performing an action unless you roll a 20
---
It's an obvious PR stunt that's working on waaaaaay to many people.
---
Considering it literally kills you after 2 minutes, hard to see scratch marks are pretty fair.
---
Well, too bad pug sucks now. 🤷‍♂️
---
Looks like PS4 got massive improvements after all. Resolution back to 1080p, controls are awesome now, frame rate is a lot better, kudos devs, surprised they don't brag about it in patch notes.
---
For the "missing ends frenzy" thing I agree it's annoying with Dead Hard but on the other hand they can't Dead Hard from a healthy state and I thought "New Legion" is supposed to encourage applying deep wound to healthy survivors to both put them in injured and trigger deep wound.
---
I hate The Game because it's both RNG-Land and almost every pallet is a complete safe pallet.  
---
There's almost no mindgames, just run from one potential pallet spawn to the next until the survivor gets unlucky.
---
Aw, nothing with phones?
---
The first thing you possibly see when you come to this subreddit is the leak all over. You posting this in new does nothing
---
How does it work, they release them all separately in random order?
---
If you don’t loop wtf are you allowed to do when escaping the killer???
---
+1 for Lefty. Found him pretty recently and I am loving the rp.
---
Looped a doc on the upper level on lerys and got tunnelled the rest of the game.
---
Agreed. Especially with new legion being so much less cancer
---
Correct.
---
Followed, I'll check his stream as soon as I can
---
Not BHVR’s fault for once. Blame the shitty update pipeline for Xbox and consoles in general.
---
Sometimes, when i see that they will last second switch, i just go in with no addons and offering. When there is a white ward i go for the Survivor with the flashlight, get him with franklin and press exit. So he lose his item and he can not get it back
---
Imagine him shirtless
---
Cheers :)
---
This explanation makes me think they are running out of ideas for killer abilities, so many new killers are similar to 1 or more older killers now ☹
---
Just a quick poke to let you know, we just heard back and we were able to push it live today after all. It's now live on all platforms.
---
I agree with you there. Current Legion is just a "First Hit Killer" like Wraith and Freddy. They essentially have no power after you injure em
---
That'd be an exercise plan involving kicking immense amounts of wood planks, but fair attempt lol.
---
If (s)he makes girly noises like in the movie I’m down
---
that would be really cool!
---
Survivors hiding and stalling or messing with the killer for a ridiculously long time.  
---
It happens to some, while not often, it's still a problem.
---
All they have to do is add the condition of the killer is in a chase it still goes down, if the exit gates are powered it still goes down
---
Overwhelming presence
---
*diehard Quentin main* 
---
Little basement troll is best boi
---
Well now we know why Jane is a talk show host and not an artist. I'm also digging how bhvr is catering to our oversexualization of David 👏🏼
---
Damn, they added Wu-Tang to tbd?
---
So what you don’t like is you can’t hit two or three people and go back to the first one... sorry?
---
*ding ding*
---
where's his regular black hood?
---
Of course there will be. The dev build they accidentally pushed to live just happened to not have the new survivor in it. There is still months to go until the Chapter actually comes out.
---
I've had plenty of messages accusing me and other sruvivors bejng friends, communicating and that we'd have lost if we weren't SWF.
---
The messages usually go like this:
---
Killer: SALT SALT SALT SWF SALT
---
Me: I don't even know these people, check my friendslist. You're so bad you can't even beat 4 solo survivors, no wonder you can't beat a SWF group.
---
Killer: ** Has left the chat **
---
There are so many great looks from the movies alone that it's a crime that nothing has been made for my dear Bubba.
---
god I love bloodwarden
---
I'm pretty sure it was confirmed actually that there won't be a survivor
---
WAAAAAZZZZAAAAAAAAAAP
---
cosmetics usually drop in Wednesdays, soo hopefully tomorrow.
---
I posted the picture in the order that I found in the files soo hopefully it follows this order
---
Umm few things. With dirt und Joey's you have 14 seconds of frenzy. That is pretty damn good for chases or getting to a survivor a distance away. Imo the vault feels a lot better because I wont over shoot. Pre patch Legion landed just far enough to get juked more often.
---
Still good to see a reasonable disagreement.
---
That’s not really tunneling though, is it? Besides, it’s not really different than the Pig’s present endgame except now she can close the hatch. Survivors can still get lucky and get the trap off on their first box (not even that lucky if you look at statistics). All they’ve done is take away a minor advantage from a mediocre Killer and created an advantage for the survivors playing against her.
---
At the time, idk if it is like that atm, but the game had no way if telling who DCed. So it had to assume the survivor did, because it was being abused.
---
I hate the RBT / endgame changes but she will always be #1 in my heart.  Oink.
---
It does:
---
&gt;We're Gonna Live Forever: Each time you perform a Safe Hook Rescue or take a hit to protect a Survivor, gain 25% stackable bonus to all Bloodpoint gains up to a maximum of 50/75/100%.
---
Cant make this right now but can someone swap the killer and survivor flags? I think both versions would be fitting tbh
---
Oink.
---
*stares warily as a Quentin main, but drops a respectful nod for the "same dlc" club*
---
I was never a huge legion player in the first place, but the 115% buff makes him incredibly more competent. IMO he went from bottom tier to mid tier just now.
---
Except you already have a counter to BT. Don't camp the hooks.
---
Yes it is intentional so you OCD people have something to complain about
---
\*Laughs in Shock therapy\*

Why doesn't this have more upvotes

Fair enough. Thanks for the opinion !

what if you weren't a loser
---
One time the gates were open and the survivors stood there teabagging, I decided to leave and shower and make a sandwhich when I came back 25min later they were still there. This is why we need it.
---
His power better have some drawbacks or we just saw Myers and Pig go obsolete. I was already worried about Pig even still being a viable pick.
---
you can at least enjoy a dominatrix, I cant think of anyone who gets their rocks off to ps4 hate messages
---
Dear god they are breeding faster than rabbits.
---
I want my money back for Legion now
---
No Temple map
---
Doofy Gilmore please.
---
I'd be happy if they just added some facial animations... I think the faces are of the same quality, they just look 'crappy' cause their faces don't emote/move.
---
They have them for newer survivors but the older ones look eternally constipated
---
You go to the forum and read the rules for reporting.
---
What kind of sammich?
---
not true tinkerer can make your terror radius zero mid chase if it procs. Also the plagues perk (name escapes me atm) if you hit your obsession then chase someone else
---
Are we going to get a new level with him? I hope so. Maybe a highschool?
---
One more reason for them to not disconnect
---
free weekend
---
Because currently it is possible for a game to literraly never end if the survivors feel like it
---
At most she'd be a spirit variant ala Billy/Leatherface.
---
I just think it's really interesting that a full, 4 man SWF is only 10% more likely to survive than a solo player is (according to the recent stats BHVR put out). According to literally everyone, every SWF is on comms, and yet... it doesn't seem to help that much when you look at the numbers.
---
One thing I noticed with Trapper is when he picks up a trap he picks it up, goes to standing upright, then does this weird snap down like he's about to put a trap down.
---
I think a big difference is that Ghost makes one survivor exposed while Myers makes all survivors exposed at once. A well timed Evil Within 3 can insta down multiple survivors with ease and really snowball.
---
Just looks like me and my group of 3 ppl struggle with getting a lobby at these times, still struggle xD
---
You’re right you’re supposed to be encouraged to apply deep wound to as many survivors as possible to stall the game. However to go into Killer Instinct to track other survivors you have to hit someone. For example if you hit a healthy survivor and track the next one, you can’t tell they’re the injured survivor until you track them. You have to land the hit to refresh, and when they Dead Hard you’re just sitting there like a clown.
---
those are some crazy cosmetics man, real halloween store shit
---
If it helps, it tends to happen when survivors slow vault during chases, as if those vaults reset the counter, or don't count at all towards the block limit.
---
My dad kept this book after one year in the boy scouts, I think these mushrooms are poisonous.
---
Just don't follow the last survivor you see running to the hook. There are a dozen ways that proc bt without camping.
---
I though the devs called this a chapter not a paragraph, and wouldn’t it be released next month?
---
Yeah shes not needed at all the games still super fun, but the idea of having killers from everyone's favorite horror movies is what attracts new people to the game :3
---
Well I mean I used to always go to Red rank to but I stopped when I realized how little fun the game is there. I play the game way too much to not end up at rank 1 every season tho
---
People sleep on hope, but it is such a fun perk to run! Add in no one left behind, and you're an endgame master!
---
Spirit got hers let’s GOOO
---
Big brains
---
Yea I just finished the movie, it’s not even scary in the slightests, it’s more entertaining
---
Maybe they should make NOED last like 90 seconds or something.
---
Yeah I get what you're saying
---
So like 4 times?
---
That fucking Clown holy shit!
---
You can’t stop me.
---
I dunno we did get *just* Ash. They did Bill them Leatherface before. Might be similar to balance out the killer/survivor ratio. 
---
Hope that’s not the case though.
---
God damn that David art is flooding my basement
---
Ive had a dwight jump through a blocked window over and over as a trapper chasing him. I hope it's actually fixed
---
In that logic, it still does notify the killer. Nevertheless, it's been established in other comments that it doesn't notify when being worked on. I currently don't know how any of the recent perks work as my PC is down.

---
It’s hard to explain, but it might’ve been the map. It kept feeling like I was bumping into survivors who weren’t there.
---
Fanatic Purifiers REPRESENT!
---
They'd just need to make it so any jigsaw box has a 100% chance of removing a trap after endgame collapse begins.
---
The top one seems to be modelled after Amanda’s appearance in Saw 3 during the main plot line of the movie.
---
The bottom outfit looks like the one where she went to visit the Detective she’s locked in the bathroom and got into a fight with him where they both brutalised each other.
---
Really like both of them
---
Daddy.

BHVR: [“I’m sorry, I can’t hear you over the 4 people vs your 1 who bought Ash. What was that?”](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXatquVqAc)
---
Urgh no thanks. This series can f' off.
---
Thanks god we have the original mask, bad enough that the costume seems to be from the next season of that show.
---
I feel like a couple of dirty loops are fair, because at any point you can just abort the chase if you feel it's taking too much time. Chases are really the main way to keep a killer busy aside from not being found in the first place.
---
To all the hag mains that stuck through 2017 with her.
---
Hex: Haunted grounds
---
Nothin', just chillin'.
---
Killin'.
---
Fuck that, we dont need another plain Jane survivor give us DEWEY
---
You haven't been able to backup your save since they moved to BHVR servers.
---
I haven't seen any confirmed cases of progress loss since that change.
---
Looks like they combined her first movie and third movie outfits for that one then as the top looks like a mix of 1 and 3 and the bottom half is definitely what she wore in 3
---
Wasn’t this photoshopped? (Just watched a PaulyEsther video where he talked about a fake leak from some time ago).
---
Reminds me if the art that traps the red head on Beetlejuice.
---
wow she looks cool
---
Legion after 2.7.0, it even says in the meme
---
Now I only need the lady outfit for leatherface that is shown in his movie
---
judging from what we've gather this looks to be a paragraph chapter.  ala leatherface/Bill and Ash. But who knows since there's still 1.5 month to go the survivor could just not be in the build yet.
---
Its 6 weeks away
---
The chain shatters and the guide bar snaps in half...
---
...probably.
---
branged
---
It’s just too satisfying trapping survivors tbh. That shit is my crack.
---
Nope :)
---
all my experience playing stealth games with leaning is gonna finally pay off
---
You think the Hawaii missiles was not accidental and was just to build hype?
---
dude i maxed them out and got all the cosmetics D: i want my time and money back
---
This. A lot of people don't understand that intentional, strategic leaks are a thing, usually to get feedback before the official release.
---
The developers of Overwatch did a similar thing with Sombra before the character was officially revealed during Blizzcon, character artwork was "leaked" before the event and people online complained about the reveal being ruined, when it was obviously done on purpose as a reward for that ridiculous ARG. A Blizzard employee doing an interview during Blizzcon all but admitted that the leak was staged, talking about it as if it was a joke to the developers.
---
Just cleanse dulls 4Head
---
If we can believe the devs stats and what I see Billy is one of the most played killers - top 2 on pc with 66% while the 4man SWF's are around 5% only. I really can't compare both and I havent played in a group anyway
---
No Mither. Buff it, please
---
aaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
That’s on the killer for not pushing them out if they were still at the gate for a whole 25 minutes. It’s more about hiding and holding the game hostage, not tea bagging at the gate.
---
Thanks! This helped a lot :D
---
So you’re saying you can’t hit two or three people and go back to the first one. Sorry?
---
Oh boy, Haddonfield!
---
Well if a killer has destroyed an entire survivors team &amp; finds the hatch before the survivor dies, the game has basically ended in the killer's favour. Unless the survivor has a key or perks like wake up, its is very unlikely that they will be able to open a door without the killer finding them.
---
Running NOED doesnt really change anything other than being able to end the chase faster. The survivor was never going to escape in the first place if they engaged in a chase with the killer if they did not open a exit gate &amp; the killer had to sacrifice a perk slot to equip it. 
---
NOED is still the same as it always has been. A powerful tool for the end-game and removing the hatch standoff has not changed this. No one is going to run NOED for finishing off the last survivor that's overkill.
---
Male Legionnaires: OWO
---
they have so many options and they went the generic route
---
I feel like hes a stealthier myers, with the trade off of having a weaker one shot ability, you can down multiple survivors with myers thing but not with him.
---
If you need to physically block surivors from leaving the basement to counter BT, you're going to have a much harder time when you're out of the brown ranks.
---
And it's getting fixed, but things doesn't happen over night.
---
If you ask "Can you fix this" and they answer "Yes, we're on it, please be patient" then what more do you want?
---
Because i can guarantee that asking "Can you fix this" again, won't make it go any faster. All it will do is make them stop listening to the community, like so many other dev teams  for other games have been forced to do, after countless of people have been flooding their forums yelling the same shit over and over and over. 
---
The game won't get fixed by you saying "Fix it" on Reddit, but it will get fixed faster with proper feedback in the proper location. 
---
The proper location is NOT on Instagram were they are posting a picture with "So the bloodhunt just started, enjoy!". It's NOT in the dev stream where they are trying to give people feedback on certain topics, not answering any messages. It's not responding to a personal tweet on one of the devs personal twitter. It's by posting actual information there can help them on their official forum, where they read it. Take a peak at any of their social media, to take a look yourself how little the comments have to do about what they are asking or posting about.
---
Yeah, the original Freddy would be cool, but they don’t have the rights for Nightmare on Elm Street, they only have the rights for the remake and his shitty Freddy
---
Fair point. I just don't know what her power or weapon would be
---
It does now. Did you not read patch notes or
---
Brenda&gt;&gt;&gt;Sidney
---
Thread//
---
Hi hello, I should not have to adapt or learn aspects of the game or learn how to play tiles. I would like to hold W and win please. Thank you. /s
---
Sidney is the final girl! It’s gotta be her. But I’d be happy with Gale.
---
It's also a rumor that this will be the outfit in the next season of that show, plus the mask will also finally arrive. 
---
Sucks to get the second fiddle again like with Freddy but at least it's the right mask.
---
He added a whole new mechanic to the game hacker
---
Thanks for the tip. :)
---
I'm gonna have to quote this next time someone bitches at me for killing them
---
It's supposed to be a chapter, so it should also come with a survivor and map. If not, I'm gonna be pretty disappointed.
---
I will continue to play her! I almost have her P2 but I'm scared of the risk/reward stats considering my perk setup is amazing (in my opinion.)
---
Too bad it wasn't Ghostface Killah.
---
but you gotta be in a chase, so uh, I cant really think of many uses for this?
---
Pig: *t-bags threateningly*
---
By an actual DBD killer do you mean extremely bullyable?
---
“Tonight, developer doesn’t believe their system is bugged despite significant statistical evidence showing that it is. News at eleven.”
---
Laughed more about that one than I should.
---
Chika memes? Upvote
---
I use the term "notify" in this game strictly speaking something that reveals position. But yes, the perk reveals totem count and you get a sound effect when that number ticks down so yes you are right.
---
One of us! One of us! One of us!
---
Wait isn’t then just the ghost (ghostface) ability’s as he can crouch lose his terror radius and stalk
---
How exactly do I drop the folders on Windows 10? I'm kinda stuck
---
When does Ghostface ever stalk besides calling their victims??? Ghostface just YOLOs and runs for their victims, the stalk ability seems really out of place... I always saw Ghostface as more of a Legion type of killer. Also those cosmetics are pretty horrible. I've wanted this killer for ages, I hope the rest of the perks and cosmetics make up for it...
---
GALE OR RIOT
---
I like this
---
Disagreed. I hate going against Billys.
---
I just played a game and tested it out. Stomp the hatch= gates buzz and Noed activates.
---
The school sounds like a really good idea imo, imagine there can be a lot of closed classrooms and a bunch of scattered desks to run around to escape killers. Long Hall's filled with lockers (it'd be cool if we can enter them too)
---
I'm sad we won't get New Nightmare Freddy
---
Well, I'll at least give them props for not trying to play it off like it never happened.
---
Not at all. I mean a killer that's not in the wrong game.  
---
They now have ways to counter.
---
Yes, it was on pc for a little bit before they fixed it. Ghost face and pig cosmetics.
---
wow some people are really toxic...I hate those, I got killed By myers thanks to that also, i gave them time by letting Myers run after me, when i got to the door i saw 2 survivors stand and do nothing, i got downed, then they open the gate in 1 second legit, they didnt fully 100% open it to let me get killed. That's what u call sad man..
---
Why is that?  
---
I find them incredibly fun to loop.
---
Yep, it’s legit. It was caught on multiple live streams as farm as I’m aware, and BHVR even said that some people got a peak because they accidentally pushed it out with the patch.
---
I think you’re talking about the Mural Sketch and Stolen Sketch and you’re right they would give you 14 seconds of Feral together. Might give you enough time to get around and apply it to more people. But you can still get screwed over by some of the other mechanics. Like the extended recovery time or the 20 second cooldown on his power since you wouldn’t have other add-ons 
---
Like I said in the Tl;dr I don’t think new Legion is bad but it wasn’t a step in the right direction imo.
---
It’s not that I don’t do it but if it’s one of those ignorant survivors that are like “I put in a party streamer man why can’t we just farm”, i’m not in the mood to do that
---
I want to play as how the game is intended
---
Sure sometimes i’ll be like okay i’ll be nice to these guys but majority of the time if you’re a suvivor that’s going to complain about Not having it your way
---
Let me play don’t be a dick and screw over your random teammates. That’s not fun for them, not fun for me to be like “Killer can only kill with a Survivor Sandbagging”
---
You’re taking what i’m saying and flipping to where the Killer is the Bad Guy here. But it’s the fact Survivors feel like they Deserve to do whatever they want.
---
I rather dictate the game as a Killer and do what I want. If i don’t want to farm I don’t want to farm so in other words “I don’t care you put a streamer”
---
If you get a 4% “I don’t care I’m not going to just go and waste more time trying to find hatch”
---
Do you get it?
---
I can’t stand the fact that these stupid made up rules ruin MOST of my experience and then it gets complained that i don’t follow them? Most of them are so Survivor sided anyway that it makes it not fun for Killers so we break them and what do we get? Trash talked, bashed, and then have you guys complain more and more. I said GG, I said good luck in your future games, but you’re going to be a dick and complain that “I am obligated to have hatch because I 4% the hook”
---
Or “I put a party streamer”
---
What sense does that make?
---
I’m not saying these are wrong things to do just for the love of fucking god don’t tell me the way I play is wrong and that I’m trash for playing it like that because you as a survivor died to it. So screw you if you’re trying to dictate How I want to play. If the Killer decides to do it that way then don’t be a dick about it.
---
And also I personally think Farming is a waste of time, what point is there to farm when you could probably complete more games in the allotted time you actually just stay there? More action and a lot more fun.
---
*"aye kid, you want some blades?"*
---
I do too! I'm on ps4 and I played nurse til I had all her perks unlocked and it was sometimes fun but mostly draining. I also get the nurse daily almost daily and wish they'd double the bloodpoints or stop offering me it
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1125795620634099713
---
Lol
---
Figured as much for the position being revealed, but originally my comment was that survivor's position was exposed, I've been since corrected.
---
Kind of like just a better Myers.
---
[Looks that way, at least for piggy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/blspy5/new_pig_cosmetics/)
---
&gt;Which one?
---
I rather not say who it was. I am pretty sure they aren't supposed to say this even if the new killer got leaked. This person got caught up in the moment that everyone was hyped about the leaked stuff, thought it wouldn't be a big deal and decided to spit out something they (every fog whisperer who visited BHVR) knew for months now.
---
I still loose a nights worth of game times progress from time to time. Just gotta submit a support ticket and they'll fix it
---
Probably no map
---
Pretty much lmao
---
If we're going licensed cosmetics, I want The Pig to have one where instead of Amanda its Detective Hoffman or Dr Gordon.
---
*COUGH*
---
Even without deranking, the skill gap between people in the same rank can be huge itself.
---
I didn't think the developers would accidentally leak another thing. I thought this was going to be a troll but guessing from the comments I think not.
---
You do know you can cancel the power correct? Like you can mix and match stuff. Anyway play Billy
---
Why do you think keeping the killer busy is a desirable or valid strategy that should be encouraged?
---
Balanced Landing, fml.
---
In a shmoyoho song on Mark's channel, he said that phrase. Thought it was him. Thanks for clearing that up though
---
Bhvr confirmed its real too
---
What were the pig cosmetics?
---
Because they can zoom zoom across the map in like a second and insta-down your dumbass teammates who aren't trying to counterplay BBQ &amp; Chili and can't loop for shit, and then the entire game just snowballs into oblivion.
---
But...Ghostface is a scream killer not scary movie 🤔
---
Scary Movie does not equal Scream.
---
when the shape wakes up in bed with the pig and see the news he knows exactly what happened
---
That's how it's been for a while. The rank 15 wall was meant to protect newer players, but there are still people who get around that. Unless they make a wall for rank 10, 5, and 1...then it will just keep happening.
---
I cannot upvote this enough.
---
Omg Scream is one of, if not literally, my favorite movie. Ghostface is the one killer I've been praying for.
---
Is it your first time getting devotion?  
---
If so, the level goes back to level 1 and you restart the whole leveling thing until 99, then devotion 2 and repeat.  
---
If not, try restarting the game because that's the first time I've heard of something like this.
---
Because there is no emote that says “Suck it! Suck it you shit!!”
---
I feel like the text box is incomplete, it looks like they haven't written everything down, what if shrouded hunt had a time limit? I really hope it doesn't.
---
Are you saying that shirtless Myers doesen’t fit the character?
---
This is nice but, can you summon Amanda ?
---
Unless they pull an Ash and release him standalone in a couple weeks?...
---
So you hate playing with bad teammates, like everyone.  
---
As survivor, I don't care whether I escape or not. I care if I get good chases.
---
Yes...But It's Brenda😂
---
I bet many people would be more hyped to see Brenda than Sidney, not? Ahh man, i lost my hope...😑
---
They need to do this, *pronto*.
---
I hope they do. That random guy on Twitter was supposed to be the first person to let the community know, and they robbed him of that. &gt;:C
---
Wait till 25% of the timer, then hook. RIP everyone in the game unless they have a key for hatch.
---
That'sthejoke.jpg
---
Yes, 60 by default. I unlocked mine and now it's at 130-140 fps on a GTX 1060.
---
"Samara possesses the power of Nensha (thoughtography), capable of burning images onto surfaces and into the minds of others. Using these powers, Samara makes the cursed videotape with her ​​own thoughts, and imbues it with the power to kill the viewer within seven days. She also has other abilities such as possession, water manipulation, and the power to climb out of electrical screens, like television sets." 
---
She would be similar to doctor in a sense? But I'm sure devs could contribute some creative license to make her more individualized.
---
As much as I love the idea of people shitting bricks when they see me leaning around a corner, I'm worried about his viability based on the power, although this could obviously change.
---
God I wish there was a "Slaughter the bots" mode.
---
They said "fine you don't like the piggy changes but hold this instead"
---
Daddy David hypeeeeeeee
---
You'll scream it a lot more in the 2018 sequel.
---
We already have Tapp...and Sidney is the most iconic character from the series.
---
So.... heal against him? That tactic was stupid, anyway, and made it easier for the people who actually play him the way he was intended to just roll up and hit you at any point during the match.
---
yes pls
---
Doing the Entity's Work
---
Omg yes please, I forgive all your mistakes game
---
What if he stabs you in the head, then he drops the survivor, they try to get up and fight back, then topple over and die, just like that cop from scream 2 (i think thats the one)
---
I hope so
---
Need a  lozenge?
---
Rage quitting, as far as I'm aware.  
---
I know that at one point you didn't lose pips for DC'ing, but I don't know if it's been fixed.
---
It's been 5 months, look at any before/after comparison of the engine update. I cant find the one I'm thinking of with a direct location comparison, but there are threads on the official forums with less direct comparisons.

"A perks a perk"  
---
*I would be inclined to agree but look at how people acted about old DS.*
---
So, like any other killer? Got it.
---
dude i feel you on the Nurse thing! Luckily im now competent enough to get 4 lethal blinks
---
Only because people dont take her seriously until the second time they been hit after they treat me like a threat i just get bullied
---
I'm seriously worried for the people on this subreddit. The first thing you possibly see when you enter the reddit is tons of leaks showing in-game images of Scream, perks and cosmetics. Do you people not check the frontpage like everyone else?
---
I smell pennies!!
---
Yeah survivors are being asked to consider planning ahead now. It’s crazy
---
Makes Legion look like a scary killer.
---
Yeah dude, I'm sure they totally pulled a blatantly intentional PR stunt without clearing it with the license holders.
---
wait... halloween has branching timelines... guys... what if michael... is a time traveler? it makes sense, its his power, that's why he is ridiculously stealthy, he just does things over and over again until he gets it right
---
Ah, yes, thank you! all this *Scream*ing has gotten my throat all sore.
---
*noice mori*
---
Yeah, IDK. I think insta-downs are kind of absurd, too. I also think insta-heals are BS.
---
Aside from aging effects, there isnt much difference between OG Myers and 2018 Myers
---
You keep them
---
Ah so a hallowed blight cosmetic like some of the original killers got for the Halloween event last year? That'd be so sweet
---
That's a recolor, the default is black.
---
they noticed. it's just an attempt to get people excited about the next DLC to gloss over the fact that this update nerfs 2 paid DLC characters.
---
an interesting dilemma https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/58319/killer-perks-and-endgame-collapse

Wasn’t a fix for the ILS bug also included?

CHEEKY BREEKY NERF FREDDY
---
Nice "spoiler" tag there, btw....
---
There’s no benefit to rage quitting ever unless you just started a trial. Even then, you’ll screw everyone else over.
---
People DC because they are rage quitting. DC= ragequit. If you just spent 10 minutes in a match and racked up 30k total bloodpoints, you lose all of it. Literally hurting only yourself and your team by DCing
---
Brenda isn't from scream...like I love Brenda but wrong franchise.
---
Yeah, it was for me...my name kinda asks for it :))
---
new update is out for ps4? too lazy to check! sorry :P
---
GILF MYERS NOW
---
Then people are downvoting you because your sarcasm is stupid. You don’t sarcastically not get a joke, that’s just weird
---
This makes me want to watch the movies now
---
Billy can only insta-down you when you're in an unsafe area(unless he's got instasaw), or he's a skilled Billy and mindgamed you around a loop.  
---
I don't think Billy is too strong, but the only complaint I have about him is that the chainsaw hitbox is too big.  
---
The hitbox was changed as a "fix" to false chainsaws, which didn't help.
---
how dare u 😤
---
One of his Ultra Rares is called "Ghostface caught on camera." which does the following:  
---
\*\*Considerably\*\* increases stalking speed while peeking.  
---
\*\*Considerably\*\* decreases stalking speed while not peeking
---
There is absolutely nothing at all proving that. Pretty much 99% of the times we get a new chapter it includes a Killer, a survivor and a map. And no they never called Ash a chapter, not sure where you got that from. That was literally just something extra they did for us right after coming out with the Plague, the actual chapter.
---
I could have believed Ash's leak was an accident, since it was only in the KYF menu, which is rarely looked at and it's no secret they neglect that mode. but this, there's no way it was an accident, it's literally in the main menu.
---
I sincerely doubt that's the case.
---
She is as fake as press on nails
---
Yes - they're only going to be late pushing it to Xbox a day or two.
---
This was implemented in the PTB and I can say through firsthand experience on said PTB, that the only thing you lose is the time you spent waiting for that game to load.
---
tysm!!
---
In average gameplay, Killers don't have time for fancy stealth and sneaking around. So Ghost will probably be lack luster on large maps, but great on smaller maps. 
---
Assuming Ruin is in a good place.
---
wasnt really a standoff tho
---
Haha with those insults you must be 12.
---
Nice good man.
---
From a canon perspective the newest one is the one true sequel just FYI.
---
Let’s hope. Really hate losing my BP multipliers. Haven’t run into any DCs yet, fingers crossed.
---
We don't know. Sorry, worked retail and having to be careful of street date got me thinking.
---
WAZUUUUUUP
---
It's bullshit that a killer can close the hatch after 4 gens were repaired, and there's only 1 survivor left.
---
Especially with nurse and entity murmur perk it's impossible to escape through gates.
---
The water manip would be tight tbh
---
Ash was a chapter to bhvr...
---
Also a fog whisperer supposedly confirmed its just ghostface.

wait is this legit?? i thought this is all a meme?? somebody please is this REAL NEWS?
---
Killer has easy advantage of finding it first though.
---
What if they made it lower the timer but not end it instaly and brought back able to hit someone more then once for like a redecuded stun timer?
---
If it's a nurse, she will be within gates long before you get to 25% of progress bar to open the gates.
---
Na dude then your punishing people that don’t camp if they are within a 20 yard range of you. This is a bad solution.
---
What happens to your points if the killer DC?
---
Seriously, though.  Was anyone actually surprised by this?

---
Personally I think its fine. Hilarious even.
---
Maybe one day we’ll get Jason. I doubt it, but it’d be cool.
---
So no one is gonna talk about how hot Rin looks?
---
One of them is a mixture of her top from Saw 1 and her trousers from Saw 3, plus a new pig head. The other is somewhat Hoffman inspired leather garb.
---
is the leaked ghost killer Legit or its all a meme.. please im in huge confusion.
---
Everyone says camping needs to be “fixed” like it’s a real problem. 
---
Camping doesn’t need to be fixed. Camping is moronic 9 times out of 10. If he’s camping go do gens. Each other survivor has time to do 1.5 gens during a full hook. 4.5 gens for one survivor sucks for that one guy, but the killer depips and you 3 get out.
---
He went to BHVR headquarters a few months ago with some other fog whisperers and was shown some upcoming stuff according to another comment I saw
---
My main issue with legion is just they feel clunky and slow now. The vaulting anamtion in frenzy looks woonky as hell.
---
I have a really old PS4 (like, I bought it around the time the PS4 first came out) and my frame rate is actually really nice with this patch - “I could keep up with survivors 360ing me” levels of nice. 
---
Sorry, I know that’s not much help. Maybe it’s just Ormond? Or maybe your particular PS4?
---
Not gonna argue past this with someone who is clearly a dev apologist in the post history.  And with a blanket statement of dismissal of "I just don't like em" can be an ultimate defense for almost any complaints anyone has against the game.
---
In short:
---
1. Heavy handed nerfs over nuanced changes over time.
---
2. Prioritization of what gets pushed.  
---
3. Introducing more problems with each patch.
---
4. Constant lying/backtracking in communications.
---
5. Ignoring Community Feedback or twisting à la a monkey's paw.
---
Quite frankly, the quality of each release they push seems to be getting lower and lower.  Coming from a medical programming background, I would have been ashamed to release something in that state.
---
CINDY, THIS BITCH IS MESSIN’ UP MA FLOOR!
---
Am I the only one that thinks Janes ass looks like a bag of potatoes?
---
Ok, thanks for the explanation.
---
Good man
---
Shrek is love
---
Do you have some k8nd of imgur leak of these?
---
He looks like a stretchy-boi toy version of Ghostface lol.
---
I want the home girl Sidney
---
Trapper is my fav
---
The last one is true tbh
---
i mean sure... but what about... billy huntress? you wined up and throw chainsaws at helpless survivors C:
---
I, too, like to live dangerously.
---
We are missing the original final girl, my girl Sally. We need to riot.
---
Indeed, but that's not a bug, or anything alike.
---
They changed the lighting, making alot of the maps look much darker and made everything look more faded (In ultra at least) because people were requesting that they wanted everything darker so they could hide more.
---
All character models looks amazing now compared to before, the grass and terrain is much better now and the fog works and looks better than ever.
---
But the lighting is terrible, i will agree.
---
But it's not caused by them not fixing stuff which were this conversations standpoint. But rather them trying to please everyone.
---
They used to have diffrent lighting for diffrent offerings, until people complained enough over the Darkest moonlight offerings and then that was gone. Then people complained that everything were too bright, so they made it darker, and now here we are with people complaining that the lighting isn't right anymore and the game doesn't look as good.
---
What would skill based matchmaking mean? Hours played?
---
Good, he was being obnoxious
---
I'm confused. what?
---
Very much legit :)
---
Because sure killers have it soooooooo easy all the time..... /s
---
Not if she already closed it and is chasing you during the EGC.
---
It is fun. Happened during my first game as Bing Bong Boi. Someone messaged me I legit scared them.
---
That wasnt a standoff, that was a dumb salty one running in the face of the killer ! -,.-
---
stop trolling plz ! answer my question
---
At that point, you are screwed, but it requires a series of multiple major misplays before then.
---
nobody asks how's the killer
---
You mean ghostface?
---
Hey, if you can do it, do it man.
---
Just saying I do wish you a bunch of solid, normal, non-douchey matches for the sake of your liver. XD
---
Guess your mom likes preteen dick
---
Yes please! As a huge fan of both the movies and the show, this would make a great addition!
---
I’m not trolling. The smile was genuine happiness for ghostface
---
Why is there a cosmetic on him? Isn’t he licensed? Is that what they’re gonna look like?
---
FINALLY WOOHOO! \*Happy Oink\*
---
It happening once is expected, twice in 2 months seems suspicious. These “leaks” would generate more hype and intrigue if they were more spaced out and conveniently lacked some information.
---
That actually sounds decent, I'd be up for that
---
Probably the biggest criticism is that she could just fly over pallets &amp; jungle gyms which would be very unusual for both survivors and killers. Unlike nurse whos biggest weakness is LOS blocking, a flying killer literally gets a bird's eye view of the survivor. 
---
The devs would have a field day trying to balance her or design a killer that could effectively fly through the map. 
---
Imagine flying a killer through Lery's institute. The amount of clipping would be hilarious. It would be very funny to watch the devs prototype such a killer &amp; would rekindle some fun into dbd to have a killer that plays very abnormally.
---
I think they mentioned in a dev stream they had tested a flying killer in the early stages of the game, but they found it incredibly difficult to balance a killer that swoops onti survivors from the air. Not ti mention how crippled they'd be on maps like The Game and Lerys
---
"I think we did a pretty good job so far"
---
Well there are not only imcompetent in balance, that field reached a new time high ! BHVR constantly improving...negativly !
---
You should never be completely screwed. The devs never want a survivor to feel like they *must* die.
---
Nurse mains don’t breed toxic survivors. Facecamping bubbas do.
---
oh... well... i’m actually hyped!!
---
Haha cheers.
---
It's been updated. So instead of a shot, it'll just be a drink haha
---
Joke answers aside, Artifact is quality of items that some of the content creator's items have.
---
The ash leak? I can believe that was accidental. Things happen. This one??? nope. they saw what came from the accidental one and are trying to recreate that. To me at least.
---
Yeah it was delayed for us, just like the last patch was late for pa4.
---
THIS. Getting a trap in the endgame has always been nearly certain death against the Pig. You always had to either get the trap off or find the hatch before the Pig found you. Now you just have two minutes to do that (four if we compromise) and the Pig can close the hatch if she finds it first. If “Endgame Pig” could be a thing it already would be a thing.
---
Not a big fan of this. The distinguishing part about the Ghostface perps, to me, is that they always worked in pairs (except Roman, but fuck Roman tbh). I think a more Hag or Spirit-inspired power would be 100% more fitting, and I'm only partly saying that because my fanboi concept for Billy &amp; Stu had just that... &gt;.&gt;
---
How about survivors on hooks when there’s only two of them left and quite a few gens left? They’re pretty much SOL too.
---
When you enter /r/deadbydaylight the first thing you possibly see is a big wall of posts right? That page is called frontpage. Thats where all the most upvoted posts in the last 24 hours appear. Scream was leaked around 5-6 hours ago and there is around 6-7+ posts showing in-game footage of Scream and you somehow missed it and you are not the only one and it confuses me so much that how can you possibly miss it. Do you completely ignore everything on that page?
---
Why is he blue
---
Daddy Myers + Amanda's Waifu power and cute noises when stunned would be far too powerful.
---
Long-Running Playerbase Complaints Addressed in The Past Year:

---
* Comically Underpowered Perks
---
* 3-man games

* *Looks at Freddy* **"One more to go..."**

True.
---
It is definitely done on purpose and it’s genius. Look at the frenzy that happened in this sub when people found Ghosty.
---
brung've'd
---
I’ve been thinking the same thing they did it in Mortal Kombat why not  in DBD?
---
Its just ormond, played 4 other maps today no other issues
---
Oh shit bois
---
And saying WAZZAAAAAPPP! whenever he lunges at the survivors. That would be awesome.
---
Where tf is this from? I MUST KNOW!!
---
two words:  
---
boomstick  
---
ok it's one word but you get the point
---
Or it’s intentional
---
This *is* the fix.
---
I see it now! I wonder why they said a few days...
---
I've not played her in a while but I get that with freddy when people are cocky from the start because he's the joke killer and then 4k rip
---
Oh my main point was on lighting, the only big bug that should have been fixed is the loading screen crashing. They added more diagnostics to help diagnose it in the plague PTB iirc, but the issue is it's not consistent. Sometimes you will crash over and over and other times not have any problems. The game not starting without everyone really mitigates the issue though, so it's not going to be as much a problem as before.
---
My first thought on seeing this. It's going to make ambushes very interesting...
---
Has the community gotten to the point where we complain about killers before they even come out? That’s like next level bitching
---
Mess up or make better ?
---
Holy Jesus,.. I ship Jake X David from now.
---
how?
---
I have the OG PS4 and this update has made the game feel really nice. Surprising too- since EGC was just added
---
pebble
---
I saw an article and just made this post cuz I had a question. Even if it bothers you that doesn't mean u need to rant about it. Plus, you found this post too.
---
That’s actually pretty funny
---
I ship David and Jake from now
---
What’s your set up like? I heard nurse’s and bbq are really strong on her. I played her yesterday and I had a lot of fun. I also have that issue for prestiging with my myers and my hag.. I’ll probably use all their offerings and meme builds (like scratch mirror myers and body block hag) before doing it once I have around 1M bp
---
FYI it’s live on Xbox now... these devs man....
---
Because you can't unhook someone if you facecamp on leather
---
You guaranteed get them with the saw even if borrowed time you get the unhooker
---
Yeah. I’m not that crazy about the new movie Michael. It was interesting but also kinda disappointing.    
---
What’s wrong with shirtless Mike? There are some goofy costumes in the game. Clown’s Santa costume, pumpkin head nurse, kitty cat granny huntress. I like the variety.
---
Oh I agree nothing beats the OG mask. I just also enjoy this one too! :)
---
Sick
---
Which he wouldve had to sign a non disclosure for
---
The average high rank match is either Billy or Nurse. That's what we're trying to fix here.
---
There's no way this is not intentional.
---
Sometimes I tbag if I just barely made a vault or got a pallet down it's just my way of saying that was a close one I guess
---
They reduced the ground lighting for the killer because of the difficulty of seeing scratch marks during the end-game. Many killers complained about it and the devs decided to reduce the lighting as a quality of life change.
---
Then run No Mother if you're having that issue smh
---
Don;t think it's tommorow, remember how long we were waiting for the gold &amp; silk collection. I guess Spirit is coming first. Or Nea/Joe.
---
It would make sense to do so because it would even out killers and survivors. R6 did that with defenders and attackers.
---
Lol so they make this very successful game with this sub devoted to it that you presumably have enjoyed playing and because of a couple of accidental leaks of content they don’t strike you as competent?  What the fuck?
---
Oh fair enough, didn't get that part.
---
And i will agree 100% that the loading screen crashes are terrible.
---
It will become the end of the game if they don't get it fixed, tho the new system they just implemented today have helped alot.
---
It's still not perfect, but we'll hopefully see improvements soon.
---
Agreed.
---
She is hot as fuck, but David and Jake are breaking the game more than Nurse.
---
[Wait.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/029/433/holdup.jpg)
---
I already mentioned if we had the xenomorph dlc it could climb walls and ceilings. I like a flying idea though. Someone else with good speed to move across the map besides Billy would be great.
---
That's truly depressing. I can't see the stupid marks anyway due to a partial colorblindness, so I can't even enjoy it. Oh well, guess I'll leave to bust out the good ol Quentin to see it! Thanks for replying!
---
Fourth, Nightmare had all of his sound files leaked
---
Gosh what a pleasant person :\ Stuff like this just bums me out 'cause like... are these people even having any fun or enjoying themselves, wallowing in rudeness and negativity? It can't be very pleasant. Whatever the case, what a drag!
---
Bug report or nothing.
---
It's a ghost and it has a face. All boxes checked.
---
This is a cosmetic which is really cool to know because we never get cosmetics on dlc killers. There’s also a robe leak.
---
I wish matchmaking could be done by perk loadout. You can be rank 20 if you've thrown games or not played in a while, and still have level 3 Mettle of Man, Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, BBQ, Nurse's Calling, etc. It's been said plenty before, but rank in this game is beyond meaningless and it sucks that it determines matchmaking.
---
Ok so the Demise Of The Faithful DLC released March 19th, and along with it Ash was leaked. Ash vs Evil Dead DLC was released April 2nd, so yeah, a couple of weeks.
---
Did you play the game before the patch was finished finished ?
---
When you select him it plays the Halloween theme it normally does, followed by the normal DBD theme, since his chapter didn’t release with any theme music.
---
Chances are the first person is still mending so you won’t even see them with Killer Instinct. You can’t see blood or scratch marks while in Frenzy so you need Killer Instinct to find survivors while using the power otherwise it’s completely useless.
---
bbq
---
You guess?
---
Anyways, you honestly must be stuck in 2012 if you still throw around Mom insults. Grow up child.
---
my guess is you didn't read my whole comment, those are only for a set amount of time and affect you both in and out of chase, not to mention with Dark Devotion there IS still a TR it's just on the obsession.
---
Special perk for trolls in which with every successful hit, he says "Whazzzzuuuuuuuuuuuup!".
---
I am excited to get to play the game later today, after the bullshit that was the blood hunt. Between dc and literal killers shutting down every game it was absolutely horrible. I hope they add DC penalty soon after dedicated servers and dont wait a long time to finally add them because the game really needs it.
---
Your level would be a good option. Just because someone's rank 15 doesnt mean they aren't level 84 devotion 2
---
I've had good killers unable to beat my 4 man swfs when we don't use comm because we just genrush
---
This is great lol
---
What exactly is wrong with it? It fits Clown perfectly.
---
this will be a must buy for all those pig mains who want to look good while chasing survivors with bear traps on their heads out the exit gate
---
Excuse me you mean twunk
---
I had it happen to me against a big streamer. Checked his side afterwards and on his screen it broke chase for half a second and let him keep vaulting.
---
I get 0K 😂 but they are cocky enough to complete the Nurse Daily and get 4 stacks of BBQ
---
Different teams for different things...
---
Leaks are meant to generate hype and interest in the game. Idk what the guy before is saying about firing people
---
Oh God, No... **NOT THE CIRCUS THEME**
---
‘Hey guys I’ll leak this info I wasn’t supposed to leak because I’m really desperate for them twitter followers guys’
---
Should've left.
---
I used to be good but now im shit to "give the last survivor a fair chance at survival" what am I?
---
I love you too, baby
---
"THROW HATCHET"
---
why do you approve is it because its true
---
He'd be breaking NDA if he revealed that, so either he's wrong or he's an idiot
---
Did anyone get to play him or was he behind the pay wall and unplayable?
---
Subzero\ ghostface
---
As must I! 
---
Is it just the Killer tutorial? Is it something else? What does Trapper look like when he throws a Hatchet?
---
So many questions!
---
"I will always know where the basement is."
---
Lol ok twunk
---
Yes. Old Man Myers is perfect and we need it ASAP.
---
Did you not read the last paragraph?
---
It was terrible yeah, i hope for DC penalty. But in a game where one side can take you hostage, it's very very hard to implement.
---
If they added something where if the survivor stood up against the killer for 10 seconds where after that time the killer would lose collision.. Maybe they could implement DC penalty, otherwise they can't really do so i'm afraid.
---
The walls helped survivor far more than Killer. Survivors don't have a bright red light coming out of their face.
---
Sidney Prescott thank you next beach!
---
I have no reason to get to red ranks. The only point is there is no point.
---
it really doesnt go both ways, killers dont act toxic if they wreck a team
---
Moniter and abuse
---
Squee!
---
If it makes you feel better these images are heavily edited.  I know this because of the multiple photoshops of the cat-smug-at-knife that were made too.
---
Damn, can't believe you're playing JazzyBirdz dirty like this.
---
Squeee!
---
That's pretty awesome. To be that dumb is a real wonder.
---
It was the theme that was playing when I started playing this game. Its personally one of my favorite theme mixes
---
The legion change just makes unskilled players really bad on him. It's a good change
---
BHVR big dumb
---
What do they do?
---
It was a good sandwhich tho.
---
Yeah but then people hate me for playing Legion. I'm sorry they're disliked but I love my edgy children.
---
It’s faster to end the game in my opinion, just don’t waste my time and yours
---
I used to ask the same question... But almost every game today have a crouching mechanic. Therefore tea-bagging will always be a thing. Just pay no attention when it happens. It won't change your game unless you let it. Lets be honest here, it's like giving someone the finger. It's not gonna do shit in reality but fuel them.
---
Why is the killer?
---
These have been in the game before the Nurse even, like 3 years old now. 
---
There is a graduation cap offering in there too... which was in the game for a while before being removed, until it reappeared a few weeks ago.
---
Most likely because of the Scream chapter.
---
Legion isn't worthless, he got buffs in feral frenzy and movement speed.
---
He's Pig and Shape compined. He's... The Pimp
---
Fully immersed in the cornfields
---
I adore All Hallows’ Eve 2017, my first theme. I love it so much and I was really disappointed when they didn’t bring it back in Hallowed Blight.
---
Bubba... bubba never changes.
---
WE WANT FIXES. STOP ADDING MORE AND START FIXING THE GAME
---
Did Legion get straight nerfs? Him and Freddy are the only two I don't have. I hear legion is terribly designed while actually being quite bad at getting 4ks.
---
* Every game has a sub devoted to it.  
---
* Games can be very successful but still be absolute garbage
---
* It's a game that has mechanics that inherently make people angry and turn against one another, which fosters a toxic community.  
---
* Riddled with bugs, crashes and balance issues.  
---
I started playing about 3 months ago, and during that time it took me on average 10-30 minutes to find a proper game that wasn't hit with one of 4 things :  
---
1) Red Ping  
---
2) Dodging killers  
---
3) Loading screen crash  
---
4) People ragequitting  
---
* Has a playerbase full of DC'ers that get no punishments whatsoever.  
---
* Has leaked licensed characters twice in 2 months.   
---
  
---
And I'm sure many more experienced players can add plenty to that list.  
---
Yeah, they don't strike me as very competent devs, and it's up to them to prove me wrong.
---
yeah, i think they were tryna make everyone hyped for the new hawaii island
---
Good work and nice points you got there.
---
well, you did lose three teammates before doing the gens though.  
---
The killer should have the advantage at this point.
---
The hatch was never meant to be a free escape to the survivor, just a second chance. It's working as intended now.
---
And it always spawns when there's one survivor left now, even with 0-1 gens done.
---
Just want to make sure, the Hatch grabbing is only removed when the EGC has started, right? You can still pull them out if the collapse has not started?
---
He got a rework that makes him both more fun to play and less awful to go against. The only people who complain about it were people who abused how horribly unfun he was. Now that he has a normal movement speed he can actually get kills without cheese.
---
Not at all... let's not call things OP before they come out, poor Freddy is a prime example of it
---
20 seconds seems way too long
---
Look at the map. It looks like meat plant. Billy is effectively a killer without a ability there. A

Please unhook your worthless teammates
---
There's a pretty good write up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/blvzqw/new_legion_impressions_as_a_p3_legion/). Seems like you're not far off
---
It makes me wonder if people would watch a movie that starred DBD original killers. Hmm....
---
You are funny to think that developers have no time to play their own games. That’s the problem all pc ports to console happen because they are looking for last attempt at a cash grab which is why none of the pay for killers of the last year or so have any potential to being consistent in high rank games. Sounds like you are either a major fanboy/girl of the survivor favorable decisions he makes, or you are one of the whine ass survivor mains that have been complaining because you suck at looping and get caught before the pallet. Also FYI no developer deals with marketing smart ass lol that’s why they have marketing teams their marketing isn’t the problems, it’s their lack of intelligence that makes it too hard for them to comprehend balance gameplay.
---
To cover their ass in case it took a few days
---
Ghost bob myres for the kill count fans out there
---
They literally made them harder a while back.
---
Amanda needs some maternity mumus to wear while she's carrying Mike's kid.
---
Proxy camping would actually be a huge mistake. If people just don't go for the save you run the risk of not having a perk slot unless you want to intentionally invoke DS, and then at least one if not all of the other 3 survivors have been doing gens while you secure a single kill.
---
You want to utilize BBQ and move away from the hook to free them up for a save, then get around to finding the obsession later. Since the max is 4 tokens anyway, you're not really in a rush to max that out. If you combo this with MYC (as /u/Operation0919 suggested) you would prefer to fake a chase until someone gets the save, then go after the new obsession; otherwise just play normally without proxy camping to get the best out of the perk on its own.
---
Bro what the ***H#CK*** 2 times in a row?? Dude I'm amazed at how it happened again.
---
Still am happy though.
---
That looks really neat and I am excite :)
---
These devs man....
---
Nah we love bubba's, we hate omegablink nurses.
---
*THICC*
---
Oink indeed.
---
What was andrenaline cucking?
---
A brain in this swamp, thank you
---
FASHION!
---
Excuse me. You mean noob trash noed baby killer garbage? Reported. /s
---
I love bubbas but 1/5 I go against tend to facecamp because their killer is so bad and it took them 3 gens to get a down.
---
MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE!
---
Good
---
o-oink?!?
---
&gt;So I don’t understand the point of this post. 
---
I think it's just how obscenely low their merit for a justified facecamp is.           Like, Looping and Destroying Totems especially are just as much the Survivor's job as it is for Killers to hook survivors.            And considering this is all coming from a guy (apparently) involved in a phishing scheme?           He's not exactly the poster child of upstanding citizen, wouldn't you say?              Furthermore, something can not be against the rules and still suck to go up against.
---
I'm not implying anything but Entity allowed him to bring a horse to a realm
---
nice try McCote, I know that's you
---
You got your Karma already, don't you?
---
Btw. it would stop noone to just crop your icons, as there is no watermark and it's high-res.
---
Have a good one.
---
when those loops are in the center of a smaller map (or close to the last remaining gens) and it takes less than 10 seconds to get there it can be pretty problematic. had games where survivors always ran to those loops as soon as i saw them. when that happens you dont have any options.. aborting the chase to chase another survivor in the same loop makes no sense.
---
 I honestly love his power and it’s going to be fucking terrifying
---
Tinkerer Billy can get 0
---
Now thats a Ghostface Killa
---
the point is deal with it
---
The clown music brings back so many memories from when I was new omg...
---
Oh really? I might actually pick him up now. His concept seemed cool with trying to hit everyone once in a panic.
---
I RECOGNIZE THIS GUY.  It was a game where me and one other player spawned in, a 2v1. I tried to signal maybe a lil farmy farm with him but he wasn't having it, he wanted a 'real game'. So I ran from him. He raged at me post-game chat for 'exploiting windows'. He ran shack so unbelievably badly that the entity blocker came up and went away and I was still running him there. One of the dumbest players I've encountered. This profile is etched into my memory forever.
---
Bruh calm down, legion was shit but benefit from playing like a total skill-less PoS. It was a push in the right direction to change him.
---
I’m not saying it’s not going to be scary as shit, just want it to be something we haven’t seen before :/
---
How about you just get good and stop being a baby
---
If there is no survivor/Sidney Prescott, I will seriously be angry
---
Dead ass stupid devs, what’s next? Leak that Hentai update
---
Is blood warden good on a shape build? Never ran it
---
But he’s not on PS4
---
Well i need to see its base speed and stealth factors. I mean we could have a new top tier killer or we vould have another legion.
---
Honestly my one pet peeve about this game is the designers insistence on humanoid killers. It would be so much more interesting if we could get some monsters or demons.
---
quentwink
---
They fixed basement blocking :D
---
i just didnt really like it
---
slugging is usually a last ditch effort by the killer to apply as much pressure as possible when the exit gates are almost powered, but sometimes in general it can be used to just apply more pressure if you down someone and you see another survivor right in front of you.
---
His power seems awesome. It's also threatening because it actually encourages tunneling a bit. Only being able to apply exposed to one person at a time. So if you see him you know you'll be in for a lengthy chase.
---
How'd you get this?
---
I agree it looks less like the movies but the movies use a party city quality costume as part of the plot and it looks like just that. This actually looks really cool. 
---
They should def add a spirit haloween skin that is all shit quality like the movies I couldn't resist using it.
---
Past few days ive been playing legion by using feral frenzy to hit one survivor multiple times and it was so fun playing as a fast paced rush-down killer with extended chase time and free brutality points, the thought of having to only use the power once and then just normal m1 chase after them sounds so boring. Literally whats the point of deep wounds anyways might as well play wraith
---
Tinkerer
---
Played a few games as Legion and I am liking the changes to them. I wasn't a big fan of them when they 1st came out, but after playing a few games as them, I can see why the changes were made. They do feel fairer to play as now and more fun to
---
Most of the nurses ive come across are real bad, theres at most 4 nurses ive played against that has completely destroyed my team
---
I hope they get the costume from the original movie. Seems weird that it’s not the default.
---
Oh shit you just got me more excited to play tonight than anything in the patch notes lol
---
[comments on my profile be like](https://i.imgur.com/9FFWKFy.png)
---
I’ve been waiting for this since I first played the game. I’m super excited he’s finally gonna be in the game
---
Watched a rerun stream where they managed to get into KYF as the killer. I paused and wrote down all the addons apart from 2 Common addons.
---
Maybe I'll start just doing the nurse dailies again. I have some good memories with her, like aiming a blink towards a gen + overshooting and accidentally snatching a feng off a chest who then instantly disconnected. Good times
---
Plus Make Your Choice and you have yourself a wild build.
---
The first of which is never get involved in a land war in Asia
---
I’m the absolute best perk in the game. I make you more time efficient and broadcast your awesomeness to everyone right at the start of the trial.
---
I would...that would be an amazing idea!
---
Territorial or Plunderer's
---
Who's stream?
---
He now can down a survivor quicker thanks to increased base movement speed - 4.6 m/s, and increased duration of feral frenzy, and the fact that he can't be looped/vaulted.
---
👌
---
Found one !
---
I lold harder than I should have
---
Got their gamertags? If I come across them I'll report them
---
Red light means stop, no light means...
---
Pinhead would be pretty cool to have in game, with his cosmetics being the different cenobites similar to how Legion is.
---
Not included in the video is the time I spent waiting at the gate for the hatch to close and running around the map to find the killer on the hatch wasting time.
---
This so much. Now if only the rest of the world would show the same sort of respect.
---
I lost enough streamers during the Blood Hunt to put Twitch out of business.
---
But you got ps4 or xbox or pc??
---
but a generic black robe isnt owned by anyone, bhvr can for sure do something like that.
---
A twitch streamer called Yoonz
---
Would make the face camping so much more bearable.
---
Ahhh ok
---
I would if it was complete CGI tbh
---
That’s my point, I don’t feel bad. Your power to Injure a group is powerful as is. Pick some one. Greedy legion players.
---
how did they leak it?
---
Well if you wanna join, tell me
---
I think he meant he got phished, but he's still a moron.
---
Nurse... The meta stomper, destroyer of game mechanics
---
If they managed to play it *I need to see this or I will die*
---
MYC
---
Oh yoonz huh...not a bad source.
---
Killer: ice_dragon265
---
Toxic survivor: ELWOOD94HEIDE
---
PS4
---
Damn good luck, must be hard
---
Got it 👍
---
Is it all the time? Or only in that one side of the power? It sounds like one side gives him 0 terror radius and the other one gives him a heartbeat and lets him stalk. Not both at the ssme time. Am I wrong? It's two different stancez?
---
Scottie P man
---
Wanna join?? We are 3 ppl in swf??

i recommend the golden rule: would you want to be perma-banned? if not, don't report others
---
WGLF
---
So I just found a glitch that causes Legion's Feral Frenzy to end early with no exhaustion when flashlight blinded.
---
Here's a video, I've tested it in KYF with some friends.

If the last gen was popped while you were on the killers shoulder you didn't get Adrenaline.
---
Mortal kombat ghost face? Yes please!

Eh I don’t really like to dc. Would rather deal with a bit of tea bagging and get points then give them a massive ego boost.
---
No, no. He's supossed to go to the door to receive the tea-bags and let him being unhooked.
---
I'll give you center-map loops, those are annoying as all kinds of hell and I also hate them.
---
*Don’t* report the *cheaters*
---
Thanks for your advice
---
basically you have to escape before the bar at the top depletes
---
This looks like a Warioware mini game
---
You report them and that's it. As much as it sucks that these people cheat it'd be much worse if 1 person could outright ban another. Think of the chaos that would ensue
---
should have just rushed the legion
---
You only win because of OP perks! You are what garbage is made of trashy material. I'm handing out reports you want one too?
---
Oh I was worried that it was between 30-60 cap lol. I can only play at 60 maximum without having to turn down my display resolution so that's why I never noticed the cap
---
They feel so bad to play. I hate DSing myself repeatedly and all the additional nerfs on top are just ridiculous.
---
It's just not a good perk when there are so many good options now.
---
No problem! Good luck with your build!
---
Ain't nobody longer than long dick Johnson, he had a long fuckin' dick, thus the name.
---
I won’t lie, I don’t care for playing killer, but when I do I try to spook ppl with EW1 Myers ;p
---
Ghostface seems spooky to play and to play against. 
---
Super excited!
---
I have no idea, but theres only one way to find out, go out and use it on him
---
I like her red top outfit because that is how I imagined her in this game in the first place if I am not wrong that is what she is wearing in one of the movies and slightly different variation in another one. I'm not convinced on her leather look though, but after release, we shall see.
---
You and me both, I wish they rolled this out for DBP, but that would make too much sense.
---
Saw it on Yoon'z stream. Can confirm it is legit. 
---
I am really curious what these "spotters" thing are. Maybe you only power up if survivors don't see you when you're stalking? Maybe spotters are some kind of object similar to Jigsaw Boxes and Plague Fountains the new killer has to stay away from?
---
Can anyone explain why licensed characters normally don't get cosmetics at all? There's so much in the movies you could use and stay true to the character and both the creator and the game developer would make money.
---
Agreed. Hes definitely a lot more counterable now that he runs slower and vaults slower, but in the few games I played with him he was so much more fun. Just gotta m2 on the first attack and m1 to down a surv.
---
Instead of a pig mask for her "Amanda" outfit. She should be either unmasked completely or have an RBT on her head
---
Dude. Learn to use reddit or stfu. Nobody has any idea wtf you’re on about.
---
His fucking face is bright as hell, like Michael
---
Add me on ps4 i will show you my totem spawn next to a gen every game, they made it harder my ass.
---
You better ok
---
All they had to do was just change the in your terror radius thing. I was cool with that. Even change the mix tapes to be durations and buttons or pins to be movement...now I dont even know how I'm supposed to get the deranged pursuit achievement now with these changes.
---
If your internet makes you DC at times then only play when it's not as bad.
---
I think spotters will refer to the actual survivors themselves.
---
I think that when stalking, the power guage will deplete fairly slowly but as soon as you are spotted by a survivor it significantly increases it's depletion rate.
---
Everyone tells me this perk sucks but I love missing and not missing a beat
---
Of course you would you fuckin weeb. 
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Wtf i thought it was shirtless Myers... Iam disappointed
---
\_\_\_\_ IS TOXIC!!!1!1!!!11!!
---
Probably emotes
---
Button 1 is point
---
Button 2 is follow
---
And button 3,4,5 are whatever the survicors wants in the store
---
Curious how it will work on console
---
It does build hype but I prefer them making the short teasers once in a while. It makes everyone think/theorize more than just leaking the entire chapter.
---
Correct!
---
Yeah but ghostface is in scary movie so it works out.
---
Just had the best game of my life againt a legion, he isn't as annoying as he was but he sure ain't weak or useless, the guy did so great i gave him a kill by waiting for the 3 min timer to end
---
A lot of smaller killers’ lunges are longer than they seem. Good play with holding the exhaustion for sprint burst though
---
u/JazzyBirdz ain’t this yours??
---
Yeah, just not a fan of the way it looks.
---
What is his power, I cant read that.
---
The Game sucks in general.
---
It's expensive to receive an additional licence to add cosmetics
---
Ah, that makes sense. That map has issues on top of issues.
---
Pfffff Oh the fun of just fucking about and poking your head just to scare them and nothing else.
---
Der Geistgeshect?
---
When you cant see the floor.
---
What the fuck literally unplayable
---
Is the for real
---
Sounds like that huge left behind buff will at least be fun
---
75% repair speed ? I'm 100% bout to try it
---
thanks dude
---
So pig michael
---
Maybe you should look at their twitter
---
Have you read her character backstory? Pretty sure they hint at her general age if you really pay attention to the details
---
Really? I've seen that happen a few days ago. Supposedly it was "tentatively fixed" (They couldn't figure out what was causing it but added more checks to hopefully stop it from happening) with the mid-chapter update.
---
It's actually a big deal if it's still happening.
---
Most of the time it's a SWF group. If not, it's just how matchmaking is. The game's not going to play itself.
---
Why does everyone say this? To have blood warden you have to trigger it right and we all know that never happens. That's why nobody ever uses it. Further, to trigger it means slowing the collapse timer. There's soooo much time for it to expire, if it even happens.
---
Meh
---
I respect it
---
The devs once said something about not adding extra terrestrial beeings for some weird reason but that never stopped them
---
Looking at you clown
---
"We won't add clowns to the game since there are people that are terrified of clowns and that would be more of a physcologic game than a skill game"
---
Ugh, seems boring. Get a home brewed original or Chucky.
---
there's different lighting for different maps
---
Mind helping me with a link I can’t find the person on twitch lol
---
Definitely. Most of the time it barely gets any use compared to other perks. Yeah in some situations it can come in clutch, but usually you don't get to use it much
---
You could have probably done several generators in that time span.
---
Feel like ass to play. Just sluggish and clunky.
---
Welcome! Probably won’t see him until June or so. Update just went live for Xbox One about an hour ago with end game collapse.
---
can someone link me to his reaction to this?
---
Yet still i never find them. Fucking never. Your luck is just bad.
---
He’s a lot more fair now. Now if he swings and misses during feral frenzy he’ll lose it instead of being able to swing 5 times. It works as intended, easy to injure then just chase them down and m1 them with 110 ms
---
Yep in r1 for the past couple months its forced me to play yet again more nurse or be forced to run bamboozle.
---
Its lame because i dont see it happen to nearly as many streamers or youtubers but most of them arent even red ranks Anymore.
---
It was in the mainline update that got pushed into the game, then they realized it happened so they patched it back out again.
---
Lmao how about you stfu grow a pair and get off cotes dick him and his whole team are just using you brain dead survivor mains as a way to line his pockets with cash from a failed game.
---
That’s my point. Your greedy. Hunt me. Your power allows you to injure a group. No other killer can without a group of potato’s pick someone and knock them.
---
Yeah but he still needs to Bing Bong for 3 seconds to uncloak, and he's really easy to see while stealthed.
---
The Ghost isn't that good by itself. You need a clapper to really make use of it.
---
I agree. Basement blocking to troll is not a realistic issue. I can't even recall it happening. I got trapped by the killer one on a totem in a corner. Better fix that huge exploit too!
---
24 probably
---
Plunderer's :)  it's basically what I use it for.
---
Third party self heal
---
I don’t see how it’s people being “stupid.” Facecamping is a cruddy thing to do. It limits all the bloodpoints that both survivors &amp; the killer can acquire. The point is to find, chase &amp; hunt the survivors. That’s what gives the killers BPs as well as survivors. If not, why doesn’t every killer just facecamp the first survivor downed? It’s counterproductive, unfun, &amp; cheap. 
---
Also, 1/4 of survivors perks are based on altruism which includes hook saves. In summary, I don’t believe that the people trying to show teamwork &amp; save their teammates are being “stupid.”
---
You need to get a grip.
---
I'm gonna guess, that's not what it is.
---
He does it because he exists to annoy people is all. It's either he face camps and absolutely ruins the game for 1 person each match, or people try to stop it and he ruins it for multiple people each match.
---
Despite her looks she seems pretty young in her lore.
---
I'm already anticipating being in the basement on Haddonfield and see Ghostface corner watching me through one of the doors and me shitting myself.
---
Trapper traps can get darker tho so maybe!
---
\*cries in gts 450\* why cant i get those frames ;(
---
We already have a spidercrab parent.  Why cant we play as entity-sama?
---
They're noted as average height in the game.
---
That “guy” is Robert bean and he owns the rights to the ghostface mask and he was probably just doing it to be a tease so calm down
---
If it sucks in general then it's a nightmare for Billy. Almost no room to run.
---
Morf_UK is a fog whisperer and went to Montreal to visit the studio a month or two ago.  He's known about this killer since his visit.
---
He said on his stream there is no survivor that goes with this killer.  But maybe there just wasn't at the time of the visit to the studio. 
---
Take that how you will.
---
All characters are over 18. If she's young, she's 18.
---
Mr.Krabs sure looks different
---
Yeah the achievement is a lot harder to get but just use a con with 4 friends and set it to Africa. Nobody plays there so NO and the achievement
---
At least the worst change got removed
---
Mr. Krabs next killer
---
&gt; Also he uses old meme lingo and still misses filthyfrank videos
---
Oh God that might be me-
---
Your LoS jukes will not work against me
---
This actually started like 2 years ago.. The dude asked a license holder of ghostface to add it, they said they'd consider it, so twitter guy said "Ey can I release it when it happens" and license holder was like "sure". Then a few weeks ago license holder said "Something's happening with ghostface" on twitter, which basically confirmed the chapter, and only then the milking by twitter dude started
---
I saw someone on this Subreddit mention that Tiffany the doll can be sitting on all the hooks and when Chucky puts someone on the hook she helps pull them up
---
https://m.twitch.tv/Yoonz here
---
the leak is real
---
By the looks of it he is a mix between the pig and Myers
---
Thank ye kindly
---
Wish I could. But I'm on xbox. Unless there even is a way to change it. Other that it's a dead achievement for me now.
---
Hey can I ask how your Trapper Chuckles mask is darker like that? Mine is \[much lighter\]([https://i.imgur.com/QrPBaOq.png](https://i.imgur.com/QrPBaOq.png))
---
Even in the current game, I think it’s safe to say Myers is better than Piggy, so I don’t know how that works.
---
You don't lose rank if you just alt+f4. When you come back your rank is the same. At least that's how it has been until this patch - maybe they've fixed it.
---
I noticed the same. I guess it'll take some time to get used to, but I definitely did a lot worse as a killer as the input feels a lot different.
---
I am totally cool with that as long as we can remove/change it so I don’t need point if I don’t want it. 
---
Given that we can do it with cosmetics and they’re showing us the buttons tells me we should be able to and no need to worry but who knows for sure. 
---
That said, think they’ll let us buy more slots? Lol.
---
Not the Dweet
---
Eh I’ve always thought of the Legion as a group of edgy 16 y/o’s
---
where ky Jake brothers at? prestige 3 jake is almost as camoflaged as a P3 claudette and i can have a sabo build whenever i want
---
If nothing, I'd love some new faces for the original survivors that got released after him
---
oh its because my mask is chuckles, which is an ultra rare cosmetic. you have iron chuckles, which is in the base game
---
THE BEST THEME BY FAR YOU COWARD
---
And every time ghostface gets out of his stealth mode he should scream WAAAZZZZUUUUUUUP!!!
---
Freddy has been out for what, 2 almost 3 years now? This is just getting downright ridiculous, they prioritized pushing out more dlc again and again which I understand, a company has to make money but there's a limit. Whether you like it or not, DBD isn't that complex of a game to have it take them this long to fix a killer.
---
They should've had dying light too just to see how fast it can really get
---
Oh I feel your pain. I had the Dell 14r for almost two years with a GT750M and would get like 30-35 fps max on DbD. I remember the first time I opened the game in the new computer. Coldwind Farm vs a trapper, it was glorious. *I can see that the ground is supposed to be covered in leaves, instead of a indistinguishable block of pixels!!*
---
I'd be fine with both, to be honest.
---
You assume I use it ?
---
Ooo fingers crossed for bedsheet/ghost Myers cosmetic in future
---
You jest but honestly, yea.  And I’m the guy teabagging at the exit gates too.
---
&gt;"Not gonna argue past this with someone who is clearly a dev apologist in the post history. And with a blanket statement of dismissal of "I just don't like em" can be an ultimate defense for almost any complaints anyone has against the game."  
---
Toppest of keks, pal. I'm glad I was right in not taking you seriously. Thank you for proving that, and for proving my point. We're done now, buh-bye.
---
We've had it playing since clown release until release of spirit and if im not mistaken after spirit it came back to clown music until legion released
---
I made a giant post like 8 months ago before I stopped playing because of how IMBA it already was in the killers favor.  
---
Every now and then friends link me stuff like this and it really looks like there's really no downside to having quit the game. This is probably going to sound pretty bad, but Death Garden flopped immediately because of just how unbalanced things could be. Why isn't anybody learning from this?
---
*excited oinks*
---
Yes totally only you
---
The reason Nurse and Billy are high tier is because they have map pressure.
---
Without it, we're looking at an A at most, most likely another middle of the road killer since his power doesn't help during chases.
---
That looks very odd. Why would the top be so bloody but the arms are perfectly clean? They should revert this.
---
mess with the masky and you get the stabby
---
OOOOH LORD IMA HAVE A HEART ATTACK. THIS IS SUM SCURRY SHIT
---
Fuck yeah! It would be hilarious and informative.
---
 Umm... I kinda wanna fuck her now?
---
where is the link to the leaked licensed cosmetics?
---
That is still a lot of time to lose, especially when you have 20-30 queue times...
---
Source: https://arizonaranger.tumblr.com/post/183824808326/ash-in-dead-by-daylight-wooooah
---
They're in the early to mid stages of it. Of course it wont be perfect, theyre still working on iy.
---
That just happened to me not even 45 seconds ago
---
Imagine unhooking and repairing generators as a killer
---
I was being needlessly facetious. Morf_UK has "confirmed" that there's no new survivor, but there's also two perks missing for Ghostface, so with the lack of a source beyond "it wasn't in there" what I think is actually happening is that, along with those two perks, the survivor was just not in that dev build.
---
NO MY HIDDEN ASSHOLE ON CORNFIELD
---
I don't think they meant to do that?? But if they did that's stupid because I don't think any other survivors had it happen
---
Yeah spirit is actually about 14-16.
---
Run bamboozle... what's the big deal?
---
That’s the Saw VI bear trap from at the zoo not 3D, they used an older looking model in Saw 3D to kill Jill
---
I agree with all of these! I can't stress enough how Quentin, a 17 year old looks 40, would love Hoffman and I think that's what one of the Pigs cosmetics is, I don't think they'll do John Kramer (Jigsaw) as his morals technically don't make him a killer/murderer and dbd  like to have the licenced killers accurate to the movies, as much as I want Jigsaw :(
---
Oh, ha! I couldn’t remember if they used ghost face or not. Thanks for clarifying!
---
Passive effect: Permanent T1 and the knofe is replaced with a cane
---
“Eh? Are you kids doin’ gens again?Just wait ‘till old man Myers catches up to you..”
---
5 gens completed. Kills and hooks guy with noed. Finds me. Other 2 leave. So destroying not so much. Just lame gameplay if you ask me. I shouldnt have been found I guess?
---
I believe in her lore it hints at around 15-16. I haven't read the backstory though in a bit.
---
Quentin twink vibe
---
My comment had a sarcastic tag. Stop trying to argue with someone who's joking.
---
Here, here!
---
\*notices your twitter\* OwO
---
Billy can play like a normal M1 killer there. Nothing fun about that, though.
---
As someone who disconnects occasionally, this would suck for me if it was implemented
---
NOT WHEN WE HAD TO LISTEN TO IT FOR THE 3 MONTHS
---
I thought so too, but the leather jacket is actually based on Amanda during one of the flashbacks in Saw 3. And I suppose that is fair, Jigsaw was never the direct kind of person, so Hoffman would really be the only one who makes sense.
---
GET THE FUCK DOWN FROM THERE, JUMP , FUCKING JUMP!
---
How come there's only 1 perk?
---
Spirit’s in college though.
---
Haven’t had any super long wait times on the PS4 in a few weeks. Maybe it’s your location? Are you playing with anyone that’s at a lower rank? Maybe have them create the lobby, I’ve read it tried to find a match based on the person who created the lobby. Don’t know how true it is though.
---
Territorial imperative?
---
Make an actual report on him via ticket system. If his account gets checked (it will if you report him via ticket) he is instantly gone. If he has those hacked that is.
---
"exploiting"
---
I see the leaves they just look like these weird ass pixels. Sometimes i'm lucky and get 60 fps, but other than that it's 15 - 30. Other days it jumps from 1 to 60 every time it can. My mom has a gtx 950 and she plays card games and other games that only need like 1 fps it hurts
---
OH GOD 
---
[YES! YES!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuBQkdsajVE)
---
Agreed! I played him alot today, got a shit ton of BP, even if I killed nobody. I think his base-power could be a little bit better. Less couldown, higher frenzy duration. But it's fine with yellow add-ons for me.
---
Yeah you're obviously one of the people who abuse it.
---
Leaked rework of Huntress' Iridescent Head
---
If you breathe I already reserved the right to camp you.
---
Lots of Nea things got oddly messed with. Her pixie haircut looks VERY poofy (bad imo) I think the socks on the skater shorts are a bit higher and both the oversized shirts and her tanks now clip through the skirts
---
This idea has been floated around for about 2 years.  It will never work because of swf comms.  Also logistically  the devs would never but all those transitional animations into the game.  You'd be asking way too much from their design team.
---
I know that but I thought it was 2 minutes. I didn't even have time to run to a gate and open it.
---
I play him mostly as m1. I only use the saw to get around the map and maybe try to snipe some people.
---
ASHY SLASHY
---
"accidentally"
---
i still stand by my thought that instead of simply tweaking legion rework his power into a mimic power, he channels for a bit then takes off the mask turning into a copy of a random survivor in his lobby, he then walks at survivor speed and can crouch at crouch speed and get all movement actions of survivors but must put the mask back on to start attacking regaining his killer stats and losing pallet vaulting abilities, with the mask off he has no terror radius if the survivor hes copying is injured he will be injured as well making the pained groans of that survivor, that would be awesome to play against because you wouldnt know who to trust because unless you hear a heartbeat anyone could be your enemy and you need to be paranoid to survive the power
---
Lol why do you play it if you hate it so much?  Gaming has the weirdest community of people attached to it... loads of people saying a game is a ruined disaster and then they’ve spent like 100 hours on it and they spend another 200 hours on it after calling it a disaster.  
---
Maybe, just maybe, they’re competent but not perfect so they make mistakes, and then the rest of your complaints are mostly just tied to the nature of team games.
---
I usually got 50-58 FPS on medium but it’s staying at 60 now. PC here too.
---
I find your lack of a pretty good job disturbing
---
First, because it’s a minor advantage at best with niche utility. Even if I’m wrong and this is just super OP, the Pig is a mediocre Killer. You can’t honestly tell me this change would make her on par or better than the Nurse. Or even on the level of Hillbilly. She might go from lower mid tier to upper mid tier. And if you still think I’m wrong, awesome: prove it. Oh wait, you can’t because the Pig was never actually tested for the endgame collapse with her normal mechanics. The devs just made a gut reaction change that they decided was logical. 
---
Second, because this isn’t balance. They are removing an advantage from a Killer to create an advantage against survivors going against her. There have been numerous compromises suggested that would have left the Pig competitive without making her broken. Instead, the devs went with the single laziest nerf possible. Even leaving her unchanged would have required them to monitor her performance. Because, at the end of the day, they just don’t care if a Killer is viable. They’ve said as much. So they aren’t going to change her and they aren’t going to reconsider. Why would anyone who paid money for that character not be upset?
---
The OP one is based on the first scene she appears in in the first film:

---
Oh thank god. I was a bit disappointed with the outfit in the pic. I want the classic all black robe.
---
No it isn't.
---
If it's a killer you don't plan on playing ever, just wait for it in the store.
---
Your dad
---
David’s kinda making me a little sweaty hoo boy
---
I was really hoping for something related to calling survivors.
---
I wosh dbd didnt have such polar oppisite personalities in the community. I play surv mostly and this was my experience for the weekend.
---
Beast of Prey
---
Nobody knows
---
When I was new I faced about 3 nurses total. One was rank 2. Those bubbas on the other hand happen a few times a week.
---
Nope. They said “within a few days”
---
I never thought I'd say this: but it's honestly too bad they're reworking Freddy.
---
In his current state that perk could be AMAZING on him. Combine full stacks of it with both M&amp;A and Red Paintbrush and you could have permanent and infinite wallhacks as well as having absolutely no TR or Red Stain to let them know where you are.
---
woooowwww. so probably next week🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
---
Drips just a really obvious zero effort troll.  He's been clowning his way around this sub for a while.  Pay him no mind.  He's not even good at it.
---
I had a game where bubba kept appearing and disappearing at a gen and kicking it over and over, and then occasionally he'd start attacking us when we got to close to the gen, any idea what was going on?
---
Just played lvl 1 legion. 
---
Killed them all. 
---
Thoughts: way funner then I expected. 
---
Deep wounds seem useless though. I chased a rank 1 for a fucking long time and ended up just m1ing him before the bleed did anything. Must be perk/addon dependent. 
---
Everyone healed from deep wounds if not chased seemingly quickly but legion's map pressure is top tier. 
---
There is no reason to cut a guy in frensy mode who already has deep wounds right? You should just exit frenzy and slap em?
---
Reddit and forming opinions on something before it comes out, the best duo
---
Im a degenerate furry so absolutely C:
---
I think he’ll be one of the scarier killers because he’ll watch people more, and can actually peak around corners. Myers kind of does this, but only to get ready for a massive terror radius.
---
Imgur’s fault. The OP uploaded them at 1440p.
---
!!
---
They said that but its already out on Xbox.
---
Seagulls more likely.
---
And about the survivors?
---
I noticed this too. Also the game looks duller for some reason, much laggier, and out of the 4 games I've had, I've had 2 killer disconnects mid game and one disconnect in loading in
---
Oh whoops. I haven’t gone on my Xbox yet, but that’s good to hear.
---
i dont care if its intentional or not were GETTIN' GHOST FACE BOIS!
---
i can finally relive all of my scary movie favourite moments!
---
"Hello Drew! C:"
---
I want Doofy as Survivor.
---
so it is out? im afraid to get on and my mom catches me cause im supposed to be home sick 🤣🤦🏻‍♀️
---
They did refer to it as "chapter" content, so we will likely get a Survivor. I figure it would be Sidney, or possibly Randy.
---
It's from when she escapes the bear trap on 1
---
I would love for it to be Gale, she was becoming more likable as the series went by, but with someone like Jane Romero having a similar background story to Gale, it might be unlikely since Jane was just released. But I could be wrong!
---
Legion isn’t unplayable but he is useless now.
---
Based on the Public Test Build, we knew for weeks that this would be a Legion-centric patch and that Freddy was getting an overhaul later on.
---
Well this is a buy
---
more like someone just got a pay raise considering they're milking this "Oops! here I go leaking again!"
---
Yeah it’s out. I just turned on my Xbox and got hit with a 9.42 GB update
---
Meh, the "no terror radius" aspect seems just like Pig's crouch, what really depends is if it slows you down substantially or not. The "Stalk" thing seems real annoying to play against; if it's easy and quick to activate, I can see it being busted. If it takes several seconds of "stalking" (like Myers), it'll likely be trash, since people can just hide (and there's a fair amount of survival perks in the game now)
---
kind of wish it was a bit more unique rather than treading on Pig and Michael
---
You dare fuse my mains and grant me the power of a demi-god
---
Ghostface is their child. New ship
---
The Clown looks massive.
---
Everyone’s being weird in the comments who’s the say THEY didn’t leak it themselves? some companies do that to generate hype Ubisoft did it
---
I know, i was just hoping for news. They did say it should be out this month.
---
awesome, and thats not to bad, i got 500 GBs with only this Rb6 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider installed, i got plenty of room.
---
Lots of chairs being thrown around the office I bet.
---
That makes 10 originals and what, 5 official?
---
Yeah....sure.
---
Okay so, using the new killer logic. Games typically take anywhere from 2 to 4 years to design and develop, BHVR releases a new killer every 3 months, by that logic, Freddy should have only taken 3 months to redesign. I'd even give them the benefit of the doubt and say 6 months if they were already working on a new killer. When one killer rework takes nearly the length of a full game development cycle, there is something wrong.
---
Although i agree i think they've done a pretty good job  so far.
---
Being an xbox player is sad because we can't play until the patch is outTTTTTTTtttTT
---
Hag has a possibility of being younger
---
I didn't hear about this month, but when they were discussing this PTB with dedicated servers and Legion updates, they admitted that Freddy was getting an almost complete rework due to the circumstances and that it would be taking a bit longer unfortunately.
---
I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen during the summer.
---
What bugs are they? Hitboxes?
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this is how Ghostface is going to look in season 3 of the Scream TV series. The outfit looks stupid and only the mask is the same.
---
Just because r/dankmemes used the spoiler tag doesnt mean every one has to for no reason too.
---
Last time mcote hit that he deleted their servers.
---
yoinks
---
How did this happen?
---
Its not any puppet
---
The other 2 add-ons are:
---
**Olsen's Journal**
---
    -Slightly increased movement speed while stalking.
---
**Walleyes Matchbook**
---
    -Slightly increases shrouded hunt recharge rate

Unless you’ve been living under a rock today, you’ve most likely seen that Ghostface is coming to the smash hit video game series Dead by Daylight. For fans of Ghostface, this is a huge deal as the iconic slasher is joining the ranks of fellow horror icons Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, etc.. Jason Voorhees, sadly, is seemingly trapped forever in video game hell. I was set to make this announcement on May 28th, but the information has leaked. Somehow... I’ll find a way to go on with my life. lol This has been an interesting journey for me to say the least. A lot of people have wondered why I was chosen to make the announcement in the first place. It most likely has to do with the fact that my mom suffered various health issues over the last year - as have I - and both of us have almost lost our home numerous times. RJ Torbert is a very generous man and most likely wanted to bestow this honor onto me out of the kindness of his heart. FunWorld is a fantastic company and it’s run superbly by a man who is a class act in every sense of the word - a man I’m lucky to call a friend. If today’s news is disappointing to some or some detail isn’t to your liking or whatever - please know that a lot of love and hard work went into making this happen. My only request in all of this is that we start practicing kindness and gratitude and showing it to each other more often. If you would’ve told me in the 90s that one day I’d be playing a video game with Ghostface in it, I would have freaked the F out. This is awesome and exciting news, and after an eternity of speculation and conversation within the Dead by Daylight community, I think the only thing left to say now is thank you
---
I actually feel pretty bad that he didn’t get to announce it. Fuckin BHVR...
---
The End Game Collapse. Much needed.
---
No, what I'm saying is play when it doesn't go off as much
---
Fingers crossed!!
---
I hate having to run WGLF. It feels necessary or else I just feel like I’m wasting my time playing a 15-20 minute games for a couple blood points. I’d like to use my 4th perk slot for other more fun perks.
---
I thought legion was kicking through her stomach at first
---
Yeah, I'm personally not a fan of them just mashing two killer abilities together.  That's kind of their thing, ya know?
---
definitely not, most of the best perks are base game, but if there is one you really enjoy, either save up and buy it with shards, or wait for it in the store. Killers at least have different gameplay, but survivors are just kinda re-skins.
---
Why is this not a game mode? I'd love to brutalize NPCs after a rough day.
---
I had a match earlier where every hook someone had been hooked on, was still making the squishy Entity sound of the spider legs growing, even after they had been unhooked

---
I mean hey, Lionsgate owns both Saw and Leatherface so it might be possible
---
"Theres no way this can happen" isnt either
---
Yeah, but unlike Legion, I want to play Ghostface and actually get kills
---
I’m not saying that. You still have killer instinct just can’t hit people twice
---
If you're just not going to believe anyone when we tell you, why ask it.
---
They released the wrong version of the game to steam, and ghostface was in the list of killers, you can find a clip of it online, or you can keep saying "welllllllllllllllllllllll, idk man".
---
Also said this a little earlier:
---
&gt; I thought people would be excited about the DBD hype, and a lot of people were, but a lot of people were also very mean. I tried to share teases and make it fun without giving anything away, and I got harassed endlessly. People on Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter have been so cruel.
---
YESSS!! I was thinking about this. And they should only be matched with people who DC alot
---
Yes it's being stupid just like wasting your time chasing someone just because you're , and op look that 3 gens are done and you're still chasing the same person. Facecamping someone screws over the killer, except in situations where 2-3 people have stopped fixing gens to try to rescue the person from a camper. Well guess what, now there's 3-4 people doing nothing, killer's doing his job now halting the game state successfully because survivors have decides to be idiots that game.
---
Well first it's boring to camp, except trying to camp the 1 person and the end when everyone is still alive and the doors are open. That's excilerating but stressful. (Ends in a loss most times but sometimes you get em and maybe 1 more)
---
Second oh ya you betcha, like I said earlier. If I hook someone and 2+ people are nearby looking to save him at the same time. Hell yeah I'm camping the area, no one's fixing gens so I got no reason to get movin, I'm defending my kill.
---
Teamwork works yes that's how you rescue someone from a camper
---
In the right circumstances, be sneaky, make him think it's just 1 person trying to go for a rescue.
---
tldr
---
Altruism is easily exploited by the killer, don't be dumb, pick your battles
---
Well, why didn't you leave with the other two? That's just how the game works if you ask me.
---
It's a nurse, if you do a gen she'll show up in 2 seconds and then you're found, there was no downside to the nurse just standing there
---
Because that dude finds it impossible to tap out a 100 character sentence, ill do it.
---
They dont like freddies lunge, they dont like being hit after vaulting a window.
---
So unwarranted, the complaints worth any attention about hitboxes arent hitboxes its lag, getting hit through a pallet etc. The people who mix up lag with poor coding are the same that think mcote himself spins his chair from the design station over to the bug fixing station, they cant comprehend theres more going on.
---
Yeah ok? I wasn’t saying that’s an issue, you said on the original comment that legion seeing everyone in your TR was an issue
---
"The ability to speak does not make you intelligent"
---
Why are killers main so excited about cosmetics if they cant even see the damn thing
---
Im trying to forget, you should  too. 
---
Let the dead die.
---
Lol if they add this shit i quit
---
Ye it's obnoxious to lose all progress in a chase because a survivor vaulted a blatantly blocked window.
---
The achievement had always been worded poorly.  Originally you had to FF Survivor A, wait until their bleed out timer was low, FF Survivor B, then before your FF ended, you had to somehow find Survivor A again and down them. It was nearly impossible to do outside of farming. Now all you need to do is down someone while they're bleeding out. Pretty simple.
---
"Loops?  This is a video game, not Six Flags - keep your loops, I don't need them"
---
I want randy
---
*Where* is the killer?
---
Oh, wait.
---
&gt;WAAAAAZZZZAAAAAAAAAAP
---
McMurray is a peace of shit!
---
They were overworked from the beginning IMO lol, this game took off like a rocket for some unknown reason and they had to put on their brand new shoes and learn how to run in the space of a week or two.
---
True
---
Then you hide while she’s wheezing. It’s not an easy win situation but it’s much more productive than standing around waiting, and it’s leading to an inevitable conclusion to the match much faster.
---
Coming back from a near-guaranteed loss is hard, yes, that is how it should be.
---
Killer is ridiculously easy. It's been that way for over a year already, I don't even enjoy playing it because I don't really think it's fair for the survivors of I decide to go full tryhard and half assing it so they have a chance gets boring.
---
With that said, I still see comments on this subreddit about how hard killers have it etc and the devs just keep listening to them and have slowly ruined the game. Like, if I personally as a casual player find killer too easy, and statistical straight from the devs show that killers are "winning" more than survivors, wtf is everybody else doing wrong that they complain about how underpowered they are? I don't understand.
---
Quentin needs his crack addict face fixed first. Everytime i look at it i laugh my fucking ass off.
---
Can one acquire the Ultra Rare one nowadays?
---
Damn, thats like Michael and Pig combined
---
Yea thank god for people like you to call the developers incompetent... gosh without people like you they would probably never do anything! What a miracle.
---
People always jump straight to the SWF counterpoint when anyone can have the common sense to avoid Survivors.
---
In which way?
---
It could be a delicate balance, they might already be losing customers and games getting content updates bring more in and keep whos there, it kight be suicide to take s big content break.
---
I wish they did too i agree with you, but thats a decision that puts bread on the table.
---
?
---
Huntress's power was found in game files and toyed around with before her launch. 
---
less of a "leak" and more of people hacking and finding it IIRC tho
---
Russian got Trapper translated as Hunter. And then Huntress got released. :)
---
Not entirely the same, but still.
---
We all know men cant love other men
---
Any of the other supporting cast would be better then another generic survivor girl
---
This idea has been pitched many times and it's simply far too weak. A Killer like this without a doubt needs something else too because all you need to do to counter this power is avoid Survivors.
---
BHVR is definitely that, i want to be like them when im a designer, communicate with my customers, be transparent, no lies or tricks.
---
this gives killer mains a bad fucking rep...
---
There wont be a survivor, its been confirmed, it will be a standalone killer like Bubba
---
Wait is this real?
---
Its legit power perk are too
---
20+2+4+7=33 
---
33/4 =8.25
---
Killer rank 9 ~ 8.25
---
:P
---
Im not familiar with the scream franchise but shouldn't he/she be wearing the traditional black robe etc?
---
Yes! I’ve been wanting this since I saw the movie
---
can you grab the one that jumps in with the key though?
---
There wont be a survivor, same as Leatherface. Its confirmed
---
They said it was mostly done but his rework was based around endgame. They most definitely said that there would atleast be some news this patch.
---
Apparently what Happened was the devs "Accidentally" sent the wrong update to some people giving them the devs build of the game and Ghost face was in it.
---
Not 100% sure on this though
---
All this aside, they are looking to push some answers to FAQs about the patch in the next little bit.  Maybe there'll be info there to clear things up a bit.
---
Can't say i've ever come across this issue.. maybe just uninstall your game completely and re-install it and hopefully that will help.
---
We need Brenda
---
I think that's actually the neon legion cosmetic that's coming out
---
Although I don’t own Legion, I find that Bamboozle is a must. Most of the time the only way to avoid Legion is a good ol’ window juke and bamboozle eliminates that
---
Hopefully, ive been waiting two years, im starting to get impatient.
---
But that could have been part of the fun!
---
Doesn't make them any less awful to play. DSing yourself every time you use your power is stupid as hell. And then like 4 other nerfs stacked on for no reason.
---
I didn't think they would add him.
---
Mainly because his franchise is more of a parody of horror films than an actual horror film, also because they are not really that good or memorable movies.
---
I think mike can go on a stabbing spree after tiering up, sounds like this is specific to an individual.
---
A rushed thought of mine is ghost will easily get gen rushed IMO, also we dont know his speed.
---
I said, do not tunnel
---
Thats what one of GFs abilities I want is for them to be able to copy one of the survivors for a short period of time so you dont know who is who. The only problem with this would be SWF of course, but it would still be an interesting idea.
---
This might be met with negativity, but I truly think Legion was just butchered with this update. They are more counterable, and that was the main gripe people had with them, but they also made a lot of changes that are just plain awful. Let me compare Legion to Wraith.
---
Wraith is a 115% movement speed killer with a power that allows him to get close to survivors unoticed and then try to snag a hit. Wraith's power has a small channel to start it, and a longer channel to end it. Wraith has a lot of addons that exponentially buff his power, giving him different playstyles and utility. Even with all of this, Wraith is still at the bottom of the food-chain when it comes to killer Strenght.
---
Legion now just feels like a weaker Wraith, and I don't think that's a good thing. You usually used to play Legion one of two ways: you either kept using Frenzy to down people, or you cancelled Frenzy and tried to go for a normal down. While the first playstyle was easy and almost braindead, the second one required quite a bit of finesse, especially if you didn't have cooldown reducing addons; but you also could reap great rewards: they could effectively block vaults, pallets, cheese certain jungle gyms, etc. Now there is only one playstyle, and that would be to drop frenzy and start a chase. I'm pleased with this, because that's what I would have liked to see in the first place with this changes. My problem with it is that, compared to the old Legion version, he is basically almost worse in every aspect in this. He takes a longer stun, his stun reducing addons got nerfed, his speed in feral frenzy got nerfed and they no longer have frenzy movement speed addons, so you can no longer block vaults reliably, everything just feels sluggish and slow while playing them. The 115% movement speed buff is irrelevant compared to the old version if you increase the stun and nerf the stun reducing addons and it doesn't matter at all if you compleately gimp their ability to play around jungle gyms with their power.
---
Well, why did I make the comparasion with Wraith? Well, on a theoretical level, both of their powers aid them in getting the first hit on survivors: the difference between the two is that Legion has to commit so much for their power and it has too much risk for too little reward. Even if you manage to hit someone on Frenzy they now get a speed boost from getting hit, you have to wait a four second stun to start to chase them like any other killer would do. You know who else can do that? Wraith! And he doesn't even need to wait 4 seconds before starting the chase again. And he doesn't even have to wait 20 seconds to use his power again if he gets stunned or misses an attack. Sure, he doesn't apply Deep Wounds, but at this point with all the nerfs it got, it's just an extra 10 seconds you have to waste, at best an annoyance; and yes, they will stack up in a game, but that also depends on whenever or not hitting a survivor with Feral Frenzy more than 4 times in a game is even worth it, remember, for every 10 seconds survivors waste, Legion has wasted 20 waiting for the power to recharge, and an additional 20 for each missed attack or stun recieved. And they have to commit so much just to let you waste 10 seconds. They need to wait 20 seconds for the power to come up,  run around with it and hit you. It's so pathetically weak that I seriously think Wraith is now a straight upgrade compared to them. People can rave all about that 115% movement speed all they want, but all the bottom tier killer also have 115% and it's almost like the important part of a killer is to have a power that is usable by them in a chase; and guess what Feral Frenzy does: at best, wastes you 10 seconds and keeps you Injured (which is a good upside on Legion's part, not gonna lie), at worse it literally hinders you, by not showing blood pools, scratch marks and stunning you for an eternity and a half.
---
I seriously am not joking when I call them worse than Leatherface. He has a bigger upside and more use out of his power than Legion has with top-tier addons.
---
Lol. What can she do with a phone?
---
Cursed image
---
Evan and Amanda make a cute pair.
---
Imagine downing a survivor, hooking them, then pretending to be a survivor and farming them just to hook them again.
---
If this mean that this killer can not stealth forever then congratulations BHVR you did another low tier killer again
---
These kinds of cheese strats shouldn't even be a thing to begin with.
---
They've changes the locations.. sometimes people spawn in by them. Sometimes it will be up the whole match it is what it is.
---
I'm prepared for all of the "I'm sorry little one" memes about having to leave the obsession on the hook to die.
---
Yeah that or devour hope. Both are correct answers
---
No sir, these changes were needed for a long time.
---
DAY ONE BUY
---
That just sounds like your bad honestly.
---
i appreciate that people are still marking endgame spoilers thank you op
---
Simple formula might need a minimum range slapped on or someone like Leatherface or MM can camp and get ridiculously overpowered by waiting for the obsession to be unhooked, imagine perma tier 3 MM with 0 terror radius in chase.
---
Yeah the timelines are essentially just when new directors wanted to go their own way with the story without wanting to worry at all about continuity. 
---
Here is a rough outline from memory:
---
1) Halloween (one and done)
---
2) H1–&gt; Halloween 2 (done for real this time)
---
3) H1–&gt;H4–&gt;H5–&gt; H6 (psychic niece and cult)
---
4) H1–&gt; H20–&gt; Halloween Resurrection (Trilogy fails in the third act)
---
5) Rob Zombie’s H1&amp;2 (different)
---
6) H1–&gt; Newest Halloween—&gt; ?
---
First they removed the neck blood now they removed the arm blood smh
---
This is so awesome to read.
---
Because if the killer isn't literally terrible, breaking chase and hiding is not an option. Good killers do not lose survivors. So, avoiding going down as long as possible is the best case scenario here. Why would that not be desirable or valid? Breaking chase is not valid.
---
any one happen to back up the build and would wanna share my discord is GonnaEatYoAss#9557 if u can share with my i will give you booth my friday the 13th the game dev builds
---
I absolutely agree, I am 100% paying for my main to finally look fab
---
the killer killed 3 fuckin people i'll be damned if BVHR doesnt give that killer the advantage because as far as im concerned they earned it damn good, besides the killer has the finding advantage but once the survivor gets within earshot and in healthy state they win instantly. working as intended and balanced as far as im concerned
---
I have a feeling they only have the rights to the mask and not the movie rights. It would explain why the outfit is so different but the mask is the same. (also the photo here is a different attire, the default one is all black [no blue]) but still not like the actual movie outfit.
---
Nah, it'll be another community map like haddonfield. That way you can always have him chasing you up the stairs.
---
These are the kinda "everyone hates Legion" memes I like.
---
They changed it to 2 mins btw
---
The mid chapter patch, launched today, has included the new end game collapse. When you're watching the video, there's a timery thingy on the top, counting down. Basically, if youre not out before that timer is up, the entity impales and kills you. In this case, the LF kinda held them until there was no way they could escape before the timer getting to 0, so they got killed. The patch notes will have more info.
---
I just downloaded the update for PS4, and saw nothing in the patch notes about dedicated servers. Are console players still waiting like PC players did in the PTB?
---
Why is his outfit different from the movies?
---
I'm not going lie... I'm totally feeling this whole "everyone hates Legion" vibe we got going in this community.
---
Serious companies aren't less and less popular, it's that all the big names won't quit their bullshit despite being called out on it time after time.
---
I would gladly play another CoD game with my brother.... if CoD wasn't busy trying to nickle and dime us for every tiny thing (A red dot sight? A FUCKING RED DOT SIGHT?!?) or chasing trends (Remember when CoD was the trend setter?).
---
I'd gladly go back to playing every AAA game that got released if they were more consumer friendly and less sweat-shoppy.
---
Wait there are others?
---
Trap power couple.
---
Can’t, practically all licensed killers have their own maps (except for bubba)
---
Yes it worked both ways, but denying killers the ability to mindgame their direction with their red light only benefitted survivors. It only really helped killers if the survivors were too bad to use the see through walls to their advantage.
---
Killers are definitely in development for longer than 3 months. They don't just work on one killer for 3 months and then move onto the next. That would be quite the tight schedule for a lot of things to design, test and balance.  
---
I can almost guarantee that when Legion was first released, the Plague was already well on her way through development and testing. There's a lot of things that happen behind the scenes in most game studios, and BHVR is certainly no different.  
---
It's extremely rare that game studios tell their playerbase everything that's going on with development. It would be too much information, and some information could potentially be risky or detrimental to talk about. Thus, it's best to stick to the essential information.  
---
The essential information regarding Freddy is that it's proving to be very complicated, especially compared to other killers' more simple reworks, and that they really don't wanna rush it and screw it up.
---
Oh cool, thanks!
---
So you just leave your fellow survivor on hook?
---
you'd be surprised what people are capable of
---
Were you feng?
---
Not sure yet, but I’ve been playing with Sloppy and/or Thanatophobia, as his new movement speed makes him dangerous if you don’t heal.
---
I can already see certain killer builds taking full advantage of the EGC and hatches now. The slowed time is still too fast to viably do any sort of effective late game save and the killer has a much bigger advantage for the hatch plays than the survivor does, only counter being a key really.
---
I just think the time should move even slower if someone is hooked or downed and that the killer shouldn't get sacrifice points(at least as much) for survivors stuck in the trial when the timer expires, rewarding slugs or or stalling with just an entire sacrifice doesn't seem fair.
---
If they did what they did in the comments he made. yes.
---
I just keep thinking of the first house from the original movie lol. One giant ass mansion, exit gates are the front and back door, with a grand staircase.
---
HOW DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING
---
Yes! All the survivors rage quit
---
Uh, no. The balancing would take forever to get correct. If you want an OP killer then yeah sure.
---
Wait seriously? I haven’t played in a while due to the frames make it unbearable as killer but how do I check the frames?
---
Legion = DC
---
A buff to Wake Up would be neat for this.
---
Plus rainbow six siege lean.
---
He promised some random guy on Twitter that he could make the announcement at the right time. He then proceeded to beg for followers in exchange for him to "accidentally" leak information.
---
Idk why people seem to have a problem realizing that the nurse was waiting for him to show up at the hatch. She wasn't going activate the collapse until she had full view of him.
---
She had NOED, closing that hatch meant it would activate since there were no gens left to do and it would basically secure the win. The problem of the standoff is more or less there still, because it can force one side into a waiting game if they want to abuse it.
---
they cannot figure out the cause for the Infinite Loading Screen so this is their temporary solution.
---
Good one bro, finish strong, make #100 the best one ever, i believe in you.
---
Is this public test still?
---
Insidious. Being looped? Stand still for a bit and get the survivor to mend. Later on at a jungle jym all you need to do is stand still for 2 seconds and the surv will drop. I need to do more testing tho.
---
Yeah honestly you just get punished by longer matchmaking for getting to red.
---
Yes please, I NEED OLD MYERS. I loved the 2018 Halloween movie and his look
---
I dont blame you. If youre looking for someone in the future feel free to add me
---
That was awesome, the music, the timer, the floor changing, the chainsaw sounds. Good they changed EGC to 2 minutes. Solo Queue is going to be epic.
---
I think it would be cool if this was used when survivors dc instead of the 2 plugs we have now. And the 2 plugs could go to someone if they lose internet or something
---
Babe youre #1 in my heart too ♥️ trapper daddy reporting in, i get fucked every game but its fun.
---
It's not a chapter but a paragraph then. Do you have a source ?
---
If we're going into OG characters then Hag and Ace were leaked because people were getting dalies for them despite the fact that they weren't in the game yet.  
---
Kate was either leaked alongside Nightmare or before Leatherface came out(Not sure about that one)
---
Which would also be the trophy, power the main generator and live to tell the tale
---
LMAO. I've given up waiting for it to come out and already was a bit weirded out that they had new main characters and all that. They can't just delete Emma, Brooke and Noah :(
---
I'm not saying the changes will be bad, don't put words in my mouth. I'm saying that when a killer rework takes nearly as long as an entire game, there is something wrong going on behind the scenes. It's completely obvious that Freddy is/has been low on their priority list for a long time now, to the point that what, 5 and now 6 six killers have been released since Freddy's initial release. That's also why I gave the benefit of the doubt and said 6 months versus 3, in case of them working on a new killer. This is also the devs not utilizing the PTB to it's full potential, they could update it more frequently and work with the community to have Freddy/other changes done MUCH faster.
---
Isn’t that actually bad? It’s pretty map reliant and relies on you getting the drop on someone while also in a good position. Meanwhile, it punishes you for finding someone out in the open or trying to top off a survivor who’s running from you
---
Get gud lol
---
Plague birds or Vultures of Horror!
---
Flying monkeys*
---
I would LOVE this, the new movie has a wonderful soundtrack.
---
Now canon
---
I had someone tell me I was on their camp list. Only loaded in with one other person and looped them for longer than he could handle after he killed the one other person. Had a bio pretty similar to this.
---
I would pay a hundred dollars for this cosmetic.
---
Meg mains 4 life
---
the one on the far left is about to give birth
---
I'm honestly not convinced this isn't a legion costume.... But i want to be!
---
No, new update came out today. it's ingame now :D
---
It clearly show iri shards as well. Could just be something they have on their Dev patch though we wouldn't know. https://i.imgur.com/cc8cfxJ.jpg
---
I'm definitely gonna start using blood warden a lot more now. If you can somehow get it to activate at 1 minute or less it's gg.
---
Yeah. Sarcasm is not your strong suit.
---
That was the joke
---
The entity would’ve killed me for sure, but I just barely escaped by the skin of my teeth. Never had this much adrenaline since Alien Isolation :D
---
That's the best Hatxh Standoff I've ever seen in my entire life.
---
Imagine the chaos in the office they might have actually done it to keep people playing
---
I'm hoping for insane asylum ash.
---
Awesome... but he looks too medieval. I want the full flowy get up
---
Isn’t that actually bad? It basically forces you to get the drop on survivors while in a good position. Also pretty map reliant. Meanwhile it punishes you for finding a survivor on the move or trying to top off a survivor that is running away from you. An add-on that buffs a specific scenario while equally nerfing a general scenario is bad in general, yet alone as an ultra rare
---
Sadly, she isn't an endgame killer anymore
---
Was the 'wrong' update sent solely to streamers and/or Fog Whisperers
---
Live or die... make your choice
---
I can't even play because It says I have to install a patch but I haven't been prompted to update the game in any way...
---
Well now it has 69
---
(Nice)
---
He literally says “ you don’t deserve to get out if you weren’t going to recover” he wasn’t going to save them to begin with
---
No I said it's a dumb idea to keep chasing someone through every t-wall and pallete imaginable. If I'm chasing a survivor and he knows what he's doing, runs straight for that double t wall, goes for the drop in the game, or runs for Thompson house loops, maybe I'll stick around to break one of those pallets and then I'm moving onto the next survivor. I'm not going to get looped for a full gen chasing someone I'm not going to beat.
---
Pick your battles
---
Yes that's exactly what it is, if someone is getting camped, you have to make a decision, do I help this person stop working on a gen and slow down the game state, or stay finish the gens and yeet my booty outta there. Better yet, survivors that realize they're getting camped and decide to kill themselves on hook. Well now you've just cost your team those 2 minutes you could have given them, you've handed an advantage to the killer. 
---
Be smart, you're a team.
---
Oh fuck yeah dude lol, exploiting takes 0 skill, doesn't mean it doesn't work. If I hook someone and someone gets close and starts running for a pallet. I gotta think, what will be more beneficiary, wasting 6-10 seconds chasing this person around this loop, or going back to patrolling.
---
Sure enough I go back to the hook and someone else is trying to unhook them.
---
Okay so now I know there's 2 people trying to go for a rescue. That's 2 less people working on a gen.
---
4 mins later everyone's on the hook and there are 4 gens left. Exploiting survivor's stupidity is the only way to win. You sit there and let them loop you, you lose.
---
**tldr**
---
Pick your battles, don't let the killer exploit your mistakes
---
I did a semi basement build on ptb. Very fun.
---
10/10 exceptional photoshop skills.
---
They've updated it
---
What happened with that announcement of Licensed outfits like a year ago? Did they scratch that or what?
---
More like assassin's scream amirite.
---
If only the vault activated it
---
Im on PC but i gave terrible frame rates
---
Oh. My bad lol
---
Nah, it's just a badly designed Ghostface costume.  The MTV Scream wears a sort of hooded poncho type thing.  This is like a cheap IRL Ghostface costume you'd find at Wal-Mart. 
---
I know you could spin it as, "but that's the point."  But it doesn't look right.  I want the real Ghostface costume as seen in the movies.
---
Me no likey that outfit.
---
I already mistake her for a survivor when she crouches too much, at the same time tho...
---
I &lt;3 my Breakfast Club
---
I pride myself in my nonexistent skills.
---
That's a pretty good looking design. The next DBD animation will be interesting though since Frank already ditched that outfit.
---
If you're referring to Bitter Murmur, it does not activate on Hatch Closure;(Same with Dark Sense) they specifically use the verbage of "When the **last generator is repaired**" as opposed to NOED's/Adrenaline's/Hope's "As soon as **the exit gates are powered**." I tested this in the PTB to be 100% sure; when you close the hatch, the generators are not spontaneously repaired, they are instead blocked when the exit gates are powered.
---
If you're referring to Whispers, it's certainly not healthy for the current way this is handled (given the killer can simply wait until whispers activates, and then close the hatch) but I wouldn't call it damning for this situation.
---
This just keeps getting wilder and wilder the more I look at it.
---
Lightborn
---
The leaked perk and ability are pushing for this kind of playstyle it seems. I'm excited.
---
BBQ is just a generally useful perk.
---
M&amp;A is very good on Legion.
---
Bloodhound no longer works while in frenzy and is just as useless as it is on any other killer when not using frenzy.
---
Ruin is just a generally useful perk.
---
Blood warden and iron maiden are meh.
---
Sidney isn't 'generic'...she literally broke boundaries and was a first for a lot of slashers, and I'd still rather her or Tatum be the character. I don't want another cop character. Also the last survivor was a guy.
---
the thing is, yeah it sucks, and i wouldnt invoke it on my worst non-balla claudette, but there are ways to counter it.  Borrowed time, DS, or what I just said combined with Adrenaline or use Mettle of Man.
---
It looks like they live and sleep together. 
---
They really are sailing this ship and I want to be on it!
---
Lol yeah.  This looks like Ghostface joined the Dark Brotherhood or some shit.  He's gonna sacrifice your ass to Sithis.
---
Exactly.
---
It’s a perfect amalgamation of her looks.
---
The sleeves and color are iconic.
---
Easily, you're playing dead by daylight. Welcome to killer based matchmaking, where they literally have the power to waste your time, rank, and offerings.
---
Morf, who was under NDA said that there is no survivor incoming. The license they bought isn't the franchise, it's just the outfit for Ghostface. 
---
Here's the [VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/421601840?t=02h10m56s) for anyone interested.
---
It’s not even when doing anything specific, just walking becomes lagging around a bit and when chasing it’s a nightmare, getting 360’d or dodged means I’m just losing you completely
---
*Miss a single hit*
---

---
They could let him mimic one survivor 1:1 at the beginning of the trial and he would lose his disguise after his first hit. Imagine not knowing who the killer is and then Nea pops up stabbing you from behind.
---
All good. If it did work oh man
---
That's basically what survivors are supposed to do to win
---
*Laughs in Ghostface*
---
Thats the thing you play as killer not survivor. Its different.,
---
Nah, there was point between Spirit and Legion where the normal themes came back. Can't remember if it was before or after the Hallowed Blight theme, though.
---
PS4 as well mate. Might be platform specific?
---
Bruh dude dressed like he straight outta r/absolver
---
Lol people a few months back were talking about wanting Jeepers Creepers in the game, even though his creator's a pedo
---
Good Being tunneled by pig just for pallet loping
---
Love it.
---
Because it would ruin the creepy factor of Michael and the horror feel of the game. Which is exactly why the license holders will (thankfully) never agree to it.
---
When does Ghostface release approximately?
---
Yeah I don't lose a pip or gain a pip or get any emblems at all, but I keep my stuff (except offering ofc)
---
“Blades are for skatin’, ya dingus!”
---
*attempts to leave*
---
“It’s a little snowy.”
---
Huh, interesting? Mine starts with c... maybe there's a pattern with that? You could be onto something.
---
Haha yeah no kiddng. Its actually pretty intense now compared to the pbt
---
I like this one and the one from the remake :o
---
I mean he can use voodoo spells to telekenisis carry us to hooks. Why not? Just think of it like you're watching Freddy carry someone while you're awake
---
The Miner from my blood valentine. Even though we got the Miner outfit for trapper  it could work out as he wears a jumpsuit and wears a Miner helmet, Plus he's highly requested from what I've seen.
---
If they use one of those sound effects from the leak when he like lunges from behind a gen or something I will definitely be unnerved. Unexpected Pig lunges are bad enough because the sound always gets me.
---
Actually it was a double-edged razor. It worked like a free whispers before. So in a sense it was actually a buff
---
I really dig the assassins creed robe. The other robe was cheap looking.
---
I just unlocked Object of Obsession. If I'm against a Michael in level 1 will he still see my aura when I look in his direction, even though I can't see his since in level 1 he's immune to detection?
---
I play her all the time, she's my new main and I absolutely love her!  She's really fun to play with but she has a learning curve to her since her mechanics are so different. Once you get the hang of how to play her viably she's a solid killer.
---
You do know what closing the hatch does right? It's not just cutting off an escape, it enables the survivors to escape immediately
---
"Watchu doin son?" 
---
"Nothing, just chillin....killin"
---
I like how all your killers are at "nice" levels.
---
 "Oh no I can't have this at 44, I'll take a break at 45 and work on someone else"
---
I do the same thing.
---
^^on ^^runescape
---
Closing the hatch opens both exit gates.
---
Correction
---
Piggy&gt;Jane&gt;Shirtless Ghostface&gt;Shirtless Nea&gt;Shirtless Myers
---
Damn BHVR, that David + Jake banner is hot!
---
No it powers them. They still have to open it.
---
Onk
---
I mean there are definitely original characters who are implied to have died as well.
---
Jane's scenario is a sketchy one where she crashed her car into a body of water for example.
---
when you click on the link and don't know what it is
---
trapper comes rolling in at 115% move speed, throws open trap at baby dwight "where is your entity now, survivors?"
---
Can’t upvote, so have my comment instead!
---
2 back 2 back games and 2 or more people disconnected, great. Still a trash system at rank 7.
---
Can never go wrong with persona music
---
How do you know one of the other survivors didn’t connect? If not all 5 players load, the match is cancelled.
---
Yeah but before closing the hatch meant the last survivor had to do a gen to open it back up, which made it nearly impossible in some scenarios. The reason you are being downvoted is probably because you seem hopeful that these changes will be removed. Instead of saying "hopefully they will continue to listen to feedback" you said "hopefully they will delete it if everyone hates it"
---
Because I'm midway through the game every time
---
Literal Pay2Win but seriously are you sure it's the outfit causing it?
---
They do move in herds...
---
That would be pretty sweet, imagine everyone just running away from each other at the start of each game
---
Will this be able to determine the difference between purposeful DCs and just poor connection issues? It’s not uncommon that I’ll join a match, it triggers infinite loading, and I’m forced to force quit my game to play.
---
Yes to that David + Jake skins.
---
Nope. No survivor
---
Maggy most likely does not refer to anyone. There is a Maggie in the TV show, however (spoilers for the show)&gt;!, that is not her real name. Her real name, which is what the show focuses on a lot, is Daisy.!&lt;
---
remake Jason were made by the same guys who made nightmare on elm street remake, wich is the freddy we have, so its posible that we get remake Jason, i love that jason, so brutal.
---
Morf\_UK answered a few of the questions (fog whisperer)
---
First off, this is an accidental leak (you don't purposefully leak dev builds). Ghostface isn't supposed to drop for over a month from now.
---
There is no new survivor.
---
You can only see  one of the perks which is called Simple Formula
---
"You become obsessed with one Survivor. When your Obsession is hooked, the Perk receives a Token. Each token decreases your terror radius while in a chase by 4 meters up to a total of 2/3/4 tokens. When a survivor rescues another Survivor from a hook, the rescuer becomes the Obsession. You lose all of your tokens if the Obsession is sacrificed or killed."
---
More than likely not free. It's a licensed killer. I also doubt there will be a new map (it'll basically be the Leatherface DLC).
---
The problem is the Warrens were real people. It might in bad taste to throw a fictional version of woman who just passed away in real life into a nightmare world where she's consistently chased by horror villains.
---
its confirmed by the devs it is a chapter, so yea, new survivor and new map
---
No. If they have thrill of the hunt they will be alerted that someone broke a dull totem but location will still be hidden.
---
WhOeVeR gEtS tHeRe FiRsT wInS!!
---
It’s so fucking smart and funny. If a killer did that to me I would die...literally hooked.
---
It was playing the legions.
---
When I was a little kid I had this ghost mask from Scream there was a pump attached between a heart and a mask and when you press the heart the mask would be covered with fake blood. Kinda wish his costume was closer to the original and less of an assassins creed member. At least make it all black Bhvr please!
---
'The' in The Saw Chapter isn't capitalized either I'm filing a lawsuit.
---
Lmfao!! Yes 95% sure - I’ve only seen it happen with Claudette’s - and only Claudette’s in these outfit pieces (the white one with the hair in this video). It kept happening and I thought maybe the trap radius was a bit bugged. 
---
I saw it on Space Coconut’s video with the same outfit but he thought she just wasn’t close enough. Then this happened today and it’s clearly something needing to be fixed. :(
---
Then find it before the killer does, it shouldn't be easy for the last of 4 survivors to escape
---
As much as I love Brenda, we need Sidney. Laurie needs a final girl counterpart
---
This is spot on. I agree completely
---
Literally unplayable...
---
I feel like Harry Warden from My Bloody Valentine has a chance of showing up now, as the movie seemed to be pretty popular during this year's Valentine.
---
That being said, out of the 4 suggested I hope for Hellraiser the most. Getting Pinhead (hopefully voiced by Dough Bradley if we get lucky) would be an absolute delight, bonus points for the slim chance of getting Cenobite skins for some of the other killers.
---
but the devs said it would be a chpter, so yea, new survivor and new map aswell
---
Players: So are we gonna get these hitboxes fixed? How’s the Freddy rework going? When are the dedicated servers coming?
---
BHVR: [BRUCE CAMPBELL! MORE COSMETICS! GHOSTFACE! MORE LICENSED KILLERS! LICENSED KILLER COSMETICS! SANTA CLAUS IS REAL AND HE’S HANDING OUT HANDJOBS IN OUR NEXT CHAPTER! FUCK YOU, WE DID A GOOD JOB SO FAR, PAY ME!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXatquVqAc)
---
oops
---
It’s not a cheese strat though. It’s easily punishable by doing generators. They either abandon the strat and chase you or lose the game.
---
I have no idea, maybe using two exhaustion perks at once disables exhaustion? Probably a bug tho.
---
This could easily be fixed by making the hatch jump range longer so killer can't bodyblock it
---
Smart killers wait for dead hard and swing after the animation and no, it does not refund exhaustion. You mainly want to use it to close distance to a pallet or window, since using it for swings doesnt work against good killers as I pointed out.
---
If you time the pallet right, you can still stun LF even after he revved the saw. He might also had Spirit Fury which breaks the pallet after stun, but why you didnt hear the stun sound I actually have no idea.
---
How relevant is Legion now? I remember the hate at the beginning saying he was broken and all, did anything change?
---
The RZA, The GZA, Ghostface Killa, U-God, Raekwon, Old Dirty Bastard, and of course, Method Man
---
Playing survivor solo is challenging because you cant tell what other survivors are up to or how skilled they are. 
---
If all solo survivors played optimally for a solo standard then it would be common to see all survivors escape. 
---
I died five times today while playing solo and survived twice. The point is, you just dont know what other knobheads are up to and it's up to us to be prepared to either rely on others or do our best to be last standing and try to escape.
---
I can see y’all
---
but can they blink?
---
As long as Huntress gets made as one of the first ones, I'm down.
---
I thinks an alternating 3-month cycle would be a better use of everyone's time. Release a new chapter, and then spend the next 3 months working on bug fixes and balances and QoL changes, with the new chapter worked on in the background, and then release that bugfix update, and spend the 3 months after *that* working on the new chapter, with only minor patches and hotfixes in that second 3 months. That way there is still a frequent update cycle, but we're not spending years waiting for fixes while focus is solely on new chapters.
---
yea and a new survivor too, it could be invented, but it will include a new survivor
---
Please think of AUS and NZ players when this happens, we like to join in also
---
The Mask owner Is RJ Torbert. 
---
The Scream Franchise owner Is Dimension Film
---
The Scream Series TV owner Is MTV. 
---
So, at the Moment we have only the Mask and not the dress original.. so we have the rights only of RJ Torbert and not of Scream Franchise..
---
I really couldn't care less about ghostface if we don't get Sidney.
---
Moron
---
so sad, but it will include a survivor, trust me
---
3 emotes?
---
We've got point, come here, and what else?
---
There's people who scrounge around in the game files for cosmetic models, so BHVR know that anything that can be found, will be found. If they had made it any more obvious, they'd just be saying "Oops, we dropped our overpowered perks that we'll use for our sexy new survivor."
---
It’s kind of made it less exciting knowing it’s gonna be the rip off tv show instead of the movie version, I’ll still buy it ofc but still, wanted me some Sydney Prescott
---
yes its entretaining!
---
Yeah, but would they need a licence to literally recolour the current base outfit to full black?
---
I'm on PS4 and it's 19.94GB. It practically re-downloaded the entire game.
---
The developers actually did the unusual step of literally saying they won’t do the Creeper though. 
---
The reason why is because the rights owner is a convicted pedophile and they simply don’t want to give him money. 
---
If he loses the rights to someone else then the Creeper would be a fantastic addition, but out of any and all possible licensed killers, I see him being far and away the least likely sadly :(
---
Was considering returning to this game and this gif just reminded me how un-rewarding it can be as survivor so yeah no thanks
---
She can be best waifu, Next to daddy myers
---
Weird I'm on xbox and I'm actually getting 60 fps....its like they finally followed through on performance promise
---
I would love for the Nun to be a character, but I agree with the other person who says using real life people wouldn’t be in good taste. 
---
That said either the priest, the training nun, or the countryman from The Nun movie would be good choices too.
---
I know :( I’ve reported it as a bug on the DBD forums so hopefully they can replicate it. For now I’ll be dodging queues with that outfit in! :D
---
Lol mass downvoted...It's good to know this sub is still infested with babyraging killer mains
---
Have you tried verifying the files, uninstalling/reinstalling, restarting your PC?
---
It's not guaranteed.
---
The Ghost doesn't stop them from hearing the bell, so they can just get off their generator a second early to get to safety. If they have Sprint Burst you basically can't surprise them like that.
---
If you have a Coxcombed Clapper too, you can do it fairly reliably.
---
they changed her short hair also
---
and added a mustache to Dwight Halloween skin
---
Wasn't there a devil mask in the leaks tho? Looking real quick...
---
Yeah,[ right here](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/188LphajkTOMA62XaV8_5rLXQmqmZxcbPtdkOe9OJ_8/https/media.discordapp.net/attachments/341271245708460033/575346957418233896/chrome_iiWGQmHDY7.png?width=601&amp;height=342)
---
They could just get two licenses. That would drive up dlc prices though
---
But not the people whose favourite characters happen to be meta, cause those people don't exist (apparently)
---
As much as I would love chucky (especially if he can use psychic powers to hook survivors) I’m just not sure how viable he’d be due to size. And if they made that his power I fear it’d either be too weak to be usable or too strong if they over compensate. 
---
I’d love to hear a good concept that could work for him though.
---
I’m a pig main and this puts a smile on my face
---
On xbox1x I get 60 fps on killer I can actually fucking aim with huntress and plague
---
This is glorious.
---
Pig is best girl.
---
O O F
---
it was confirmed by a fog whisper that we would only get a new killer
---
Yea! Drink!!
---
Sam &amp; Dean Winchester as survivors when?! D:
---
Well it seems like a networking bug anyway. 
---
Earlier I also was in a game as killer - farming bc someone dcd - and suddenly all 3 survivors left at once. They were swf and added me on steam, telling me that the game just ended for them, same bug. 
---
I have restarted since the update though.
---
It's hard to not be disappointed when you love Scream and you know Sidney should be coming with Ghostface.
---
are you serious? like did you just forget the /s? the survivors on this game now are complete ASS. they used to be god tier with loops now they just urban evade around and die instantly in chases.
---
you've been incredibly lucky (or unlucky) if you consistently find survivors that aren't completely braindead, because the community of players is now 80% rank 21s that are somehow at red ranks.
---
MM new cosmetics!
---
I am very happy they went back on there changes with Pig. But I still feel iffy on that when they are not active they can now leave via the exit gate. I just feel like that made her useless end game.  I also really don't understand why they just can't fix or find the damn problem on why we have 2 or 3 person games half of the time. I can just imagine being rank 1-7 some people might abuse just dcing the loading screen because someone brings a mori or a certain map offering. But hey I mean, atleast they kind of did something and finally acknowledged it, even though it only took them about a year or hell maybe longer I don't know I only saw it happening since Aug of 2018. Can't wait to try EGC though and see the new legion. I am just gonna hate when I need to level Pig for her perks, which is gonna be soon lol
---
I love the devil outfit, so cute
---
That one second to get off, turn and run isn’t enough to get away from that first hit unless you have sprint burst (As you said) or the Wraith is bad 
---
Believe me Wraith is really good at ambushing gens, it’s a pity so many people use him for camping when he also has mobility too
---
WAAAAAZZZZZUUUUUP
---
no we dont
---
Then again, they also referred to the Ash vs. Evil Dead DLC as a Chapter.
---
I agree that given the separate Mask license, the noticably different and notably non-canon costume(s), the also non-canon sound effects as found in the game files beforehand, and the apparent lack of any hints at a survivor character in the game files, this could very well be a Ghostface-only "Chapter" - maybe not even called "Scream", but literally "Ghostface", given the separate licensing. If Morf outright said there won't be a survivor included with this content, I think it's pretty safe to say that's the case - not only is he a Fog Whisperer, but he appears more-closely involved with BHVR otherwise as well, for one thing having provided the voice work for a Chapter spotlight. People did discover a graduation cap offering icon in the game files prior, which could still reasonably be for a Woodsboro(-like) map, however.
---
one thing i do as killer is imagine if the survivors i was facing were my survivor teammates, its possible to get pissed off at survivors for doing nothing while playing killer, im a master of the art
---
i was literally just sharing them because it's fun to do so, chill mate. if someone wants to steal them feel free lol i couldn't care less, i just made them for myself and decided to share. not a big deal
---
I love this new update finally hatch standoffs are over, the other egc changes.....and some how the mad lads got me 60 fps on xbox1x as killer
---
They really missed an opportunity to add a new Survivior. Kinda reminds me of Leatherface. They could have added Sally, but they just added no one :(
---
PLEASE keep this!

I think matchmaking is bad, perk balance is still horrid with must haves, some killers are better than others, and some perks need to be turned into mid-match bonuses given if the killer/survivors are steamrolling because it's not fun to stomp or be stomped and who needs NOED on the last survivor or Ruin on rank 15s who aren't doing gens anyway?

Yeah I agree

You're right, it might be in bad taste. The Nun in training is a splendid idea! I didn't know how much I wanted a Nun survivor. Lol

I bet youre dead right, calls people "normies, autists, thots, beta, soy boy" etc, like, when people unironically use "beta" make me laugh and mourn the human race simultaneously

Okay but this was fixed today. No longer shall you suffer. Unless you mean DC in game in which I agree, a punishment for intentional DC needs to be implemented.

That's true, like the other fellow said, maybe one of the other fictional characters from the movie may be a better pick.

Its not too late
