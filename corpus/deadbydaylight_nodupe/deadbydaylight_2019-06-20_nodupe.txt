You're character has to be looking at him as well as your camera being centered on him. He's also extremely hard to spot when leaning so just run for cover when you see him doing so. Once you start to get use to him, he's not too bad to spot
---
---
---
OP cosplay, please nerf.
---
I assure you, every time he downed us, he kept crouching-standing up next to us. Plus, i wasn't really trying to be rude, it just was the first time i could insta-heal someone (okay maybe that was rude)
---
Did somebody say CURRENT YEAR?!
---
Thanks for the follow! Glad my manly warscreams brought you joy!
---

---
I swear, I'm usually more manly, in my matches. Q _ Q
---
I know thats the main reason why they did that. but it didn't help the pig much.  and considering it seems like a good endgame device, it should at least be activated when an exit gate is opened.
---
You can't trace a line directly from the survivor to the totem, so clearly it's hidden.
---
Yeah, my nose always gets an itch
---
Damn, you guys are lucky. I usually have only one or two people using one.
---
I’ll bring in a flashlight when I’ve got no other items and try to do this and I still can never get a blind with it lol
---
Honestly, the entire thing got me. The "Nope...nope... Fuck this shit I'm out" was great too.
---
BT isn't bad just a bit situational. If the killer is going to tunnel, it doesn't actually buy that much time in the long run, and if the killer isn't going to tunnel it's an empty perk slot
---
A couple of Friends of mine were messing around in KYF and Claudette player switched from Ashe to Claudette but kept Ashe's height and idle animation. Thus the birth of Strechdette.
---
Seems to take a good 5 minutes for me to find a match
---
He’s Not OP But I Find He Inconsistent .Sometimes He’s Easy To Spot Other Times I Literally  Point At Him And Still Get Exposed
---
As a killer?
---
He’s the same speed as Trapper.
---
Nervous singing, it's a solid tactic!
---
Not me especially if it’s a toxic killer, I play on PS4 where the worst of the worst scumbag killers reside at...
---
Yes. As a survivor I’m usually in a match within a minute or two
---
When bae says he’s breaking up with you
---
I have been facing directly towards him and he still got me exposed. One time he even was spotted and red light/terror radius came on but he still exposed me afterwards. There is definitely a bug.
---
I don't know what rank you're playing but if you try to be a shy boi and play sneaky you just get dunked on because survivors just power through gens by the time you find one there's only 2 gens left.. bringing shit like Ruin is pointless especially since most of the time it just spawns in the middle of the fuck map in the open to be broken about 10 secs into the game. 
---
he's fun.. breaking him out of his power is a bit wonly but anytime I try to play him as a peaky\stalking\shy boi it's just a bad time. I spend more time waiting for lobby then I do playing the game at that time.. If I play him more like pig\Meyers.. I do a lot better with the ambush style with the whole stalk thing as more of an after thought.
---
How?
---
I just wish they didn't nerve Claudette
---
Ghostface is getting nerfed in the hotfix so you might want to wait before getting him in case it actually makes him bad which I doubt but we don't know and I would recommend Pig as she has alot of variety in her add-ons while Ghostface doesn't really have anything unique besides his ultra rare security camera that shows auras of people that spotted you. What I'm saying might want to wait on Ghostface and Pig has alot of variety in her add-ons unlike Ghostface.
---
The thing with putting it in the patch notes is that, if you made it official and then removed it, people would complain that one of the few buff the Huntress has ever received was reverted, if you sneak it in and people think it's "a bug"
---
(A very specific one since it was instadown on HEADSHOTS)
---
You can easily "fix it" without making anyone mad about it and having people making thousands of threads about how survivors are whiny babies
---
The one on Wake up does seems like a bug but it also makes me wonder how does a perk that hasn't even received any changes recently except for it's text being changed from "unlimited" to "128 meters" even gets bugged
---
Does anyone have a collection of all of them, going back to when they started doing these? I'd really love to look at/save them
---
He can stalk multiple people.
---
Maybe aggressive stalker is how I do it? I don’t know. I’m pretty shite at the game. I’m only rank 17 killer so don’t listen to the pleb hahah
---
Yes, Totally.
---
Probably because everyone and their dog wants to play Ghosty Boi right now so the killer queues will probably be quite long for a few days.
---
When I get tunneled i lead them to killer shack and then use urban evasion to get them stuck inside the pallet.
---
Probably. But this started happening a night BEFORE ghost face so that’s weird
---
Not  OP but damn 8/10 games I had the killer just hook someone and then camps like hell, at least myers CD helps this guy is fuckin' boring.
---
Using a exploit to get a major advantage is bannable for cheating and once it’s known as a issue to the devs it will become an actual offense until fixed
---
I only have it on ps4 ☹otherwise I'd totally be down!
---
Oh!
---
Xbox player here, just game to say “Looking for Match” as Miller.. Well...
---
I WANT TO DIEEEE
---
THIS NEEDS TO WIN I'M SCREAMING.
---
Only if they are in his fov.
---
I had a similar experience with dark devotion, i was suppose to have 0 terror radius but when i got close to someone their aura still faded.
---
Well, yeah, you can't stalk someone behind you lol.
---
That sounds up ban worthy tbh
---
I mean is using ghostface bannable? He has known issues. If it was a hack or something I'd understand but that's on the devs end. In fact I'm gonna start explicitly using it. And when I don't get banned I'll come back and say I told you so.
---
That is pretty strange, I imagine the queues will go back to normal-ish around tomorrow
---
Pig basically has instant stealth (Ghost Face's is on cooldown), so she's got that over him. Make Your Choice and Surveillance are good perks, too.
---
What do you mean by mach 8? His speed is the standard 115%, is it not?
---
I'm not too upset. I can always get more Auric Cells.
---
&gt;Holy shit wow you went out of your way to get these threads lmfao
---
I have this weird dream that pointing out how stupid the amount of threads are, mods will start doing something. 
---
I am sitting at killer queues myself so I have nothing better to do and it took me less than a minute to get these. Probably less time than it took you to ask this question rather than using the search tool.
---
Im not surprised this is still a thing. On that note, this has been the buggiest patch for me. Just had a game where I couldn't deadhead, couldn't wiggle, and couldn't recover on the ground. Straight up annoying as fuck.
---
Not to be rude, but that explains a lot.
---
Not to say that you're bad, but rank 15 isn't the most effective measuring tool. Anyone who knows how to loop can easily beat a Cannibal. 
---
His only really pro is having a one hit down ability, but most other killers do too, with less issuss
---
Doubtful since it’s technically “not allowed” they just don’t ban you for it, but hopefully!
---
I use shards and cells for cosmetics, and I ain't buyin the Legion DLC to get him.
---
ouch. careful bro, i almost cut myself on that edge
---
Look at it again buddy...
---
Man every Ghostface I've encountered have DC'd after getting looped or face camp.
---
Everything is ok mate, ty. I'm enjoying myself on the bloodweb with the new icons :)
---
Unbreakable was used heavily by SWF for 99% on the ground, it was considered a Top 5 perk a year ago.
---
Survivors like to downplay their perks because they don't know how to use them. Iron Will is considered borderline broken by good survivors but most of you will call it mediocre. Just because most of the good perks don't hit you in the face with how absolutely OP they are doesn't mean they are not good.
---
Umm sure! Add me: THE GHOST FACECAMPER
---
Ah, I see.
---
Pretty easy choice for me
---
Probably a bad time but I probably won't be able to play for 45-60 mins.
---
Encountered a UI bug on PS4
---
No player icons, skill checks or anything was visible for the entire match save for the map name in the bottom left of the screen that appeared at the beginning of the match
---
Messaged the other players to see if they had the same problem, one person had some weird stuff going on with their perks but overall nothing like what happened on my end. One player said their sister had the same bug once. Killer said it might be their own connection but I'm not sure.
---
Might never encounter this problem again just can't find it here anywhere so figured I'd raise it
---
Attached some salty snapchats I took mid game to show what it looked like on my end
---

---
I'm digging it.
---
Pro Tip: Whispers goes off even with people on the ground or on the hook.
---
I am allergic to most nuts including pistachios. I appreciate you decreasing the pistachio population.
---
Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, WGLF is still a really solid build,  
---
I don't think I ever got a chance to use MOM before it got nerfed.
---
That's good to know; Thanks!
---
Yeah I get that,that's why I'm very wary of buying him because like I said many times before I dont wanna buy a killer just for perks but for how fun they are,but I might still buy him since everyone's like "yeah BBQ is worth it man dont worry" I originally wanted pig but meh
---
You are the hero we don't deserve but definitely need
---
Thank you! I was serious wondering if there was any more to it than that
---
Killer main here.... I cant even get into a lobby to wait for survivors. Their servers are jacked up.
---
Same tbh
---
Yes ^
---
It's like OP never played a pokemon game, I mean The Dragon looking fire lizard isn't even a real dragon lol, so Ghostface would be normal dark obviously!
---
He does have detection range reduction perks, to be fair
---
He's not bad, and if you enjoyed playing as him, you should get him.
---
The issue is that at high ranks, he relies heavily on survivors making mistakes. Unless you catch survivors out in the open, he's unlikely to get an insta down.
---
If you had fun with him, may as well buy him. BBQ alone is worth the price of admission
---
Not that hard in my eyes
---
Idk
---
BBQC 100%
---
&gt; hey can ban you but they won't.
---
You literally don't know that.
---
This isn’t the first game it’s shown up either. The first time I caught it at the corner of my eye. Then it did it again when I was looking for someone. Popped right by the bushes as I was looking around. Scared the shit out of me I swung at it and it disappeared
---
It is
---
Yeah. Instead of doing the remaining three to five generators while the person on the hook buys time. People just seem to throw themselves at the hook and dive bomb it
---
Moments like those are what we live for
---
Yep.
---
Yes, it's still played
---
You don't have to remember their names. Just look under their name and it will say "blocked". If you see that, then dodge.
---
Those addons suck btw, they dont do anything
---
Fna burger king
---
So we're gonna imagine things now, and call for nerfs to things that don't exist? That's great.
---
The last game where the killer brought me to the hatch, they dropped me like 10 feet away and proceeded to Mori me in front of the hatch
---
Maybe but I doubt that would find totally clean outfits with hair dye and shit like that. Just kind of as goofy as the superhuman abilities some survivors are getting with perks like mettle of man giving you a moment of immortality and a speed boost or adrenaline healing all wounds. Just a bit Goofy and non lore friendly but mixes up the gameplay
---
Very active since Ghost Face just came out, and usually  there are around 20,000 players at a time so a good amount.
---
His power comes back
---
make it common to find, still 6000 BP?
---
looking through old posts, and honestly i wanna kill me too
---
It was 16th most played on steam Tuesday so yeah. The killer side is a bit overpopulated so queues there are longer but survivor it's almost always instant. Matchmaking is kinda shit, but it doesnt matter as there are godly rank 15s and there are garbage rank 1s.
---
Plenty of cultural interpretations of the plague can be good additions to the game. This one is dope. Maybe they should do different interpretations before this so it doesnt look like they immediately got it from this reddit
---
Pretty sure it happened around chapter 3 or 4 but I could be mistaken. The game was broken when they added Ace Visconti though. Ever since then Killers have been doomed
---
And then when the killer leaves to find an actual game you become sad
---
Got that one once. I waited for it to reach 0 and see how far up it counts... Turns out it start again at - 10.000.000
---
*"Shhh, the devs will hear you!"*
---
The truth is out there
---
Ever get in a teabag staredown with a survivor? I have.
---
-Ghostface
---
For some reason I keep getting put against killers that are my rank with survivors that seem to be playing their first game ever and have no idea what they're doing. It could be a garbage killer but the matches already over because half the team disconnects or dies immediately.
---
I tried and it worked once, but we all still got owned. Something feels really broken. Played against at least 20 of them today and we all lose every time.
---
How uncharacteristically wholesome for the subreddit. Keep it up.
---
Who the fuck is doing that??
---
There's a short cooldown on spotting him. You cant just avidly flail your camera on him. Also the exposed status doesnt go away when you spot him. You get marked, you must outlive the 40 seconds. Its working as intended
---
Bruh, I play on a ps4 and you expect me to own an Xbox elite controller?
---
I think it was about the Pig nerfs when everyone was up in arms about that. The whole forum rioted for like two weeks and BBQ just happened to appear on the shrine.
---
My best explanation for the cosmetics is literally the Entity having a sense of "humor".
---
Sure, why not. Throw a "Christmas" party for all the survivors and they get to wear cute little sweaters! Really they're all just shuddering at how morbid it is, but hey!
---
BBQ all day every day
---
SFW?
---
The people who make the bad shitposts are making posts about killer queue times
---
Meant SWF haha
---
I’ve had zero fun playing the game today. Everyone is playing that ghost killer and we keep getting destroyed. Haven’t escaped a single match out of like 15 or 20 today.
---
No way leader gives your teammates repair speed also. Is it bugged as well ?
---
Hex: crop
---
Or the fact that darkrai is a floating specter which invades dreams and can phase through objects isnt a ghost type
---
That night a crime was committed...
---
agreed. I personally find it superior to the original Scary Movie.
---
I almost feel this should be a group pack with other killers inspired from Egyption history
---
Just had this happen with 3/4. And the last survivor hid in a corner for three minutes! I never would have found her had I not been using doc.
---
But I appreciated she hadn't dc'd so I upvoted her and reported the others. I still somehow got 50,000 bp.
---
Oh for f sake
---
This post makes me want to go back and watch Scary Movie 1 again. Know what? Fuck it, throwing it on while I play. See y'all in the lobbies.
---
Yep, this. You are not actually learning anything, in fact you are just making yourself dependent on that little mark which is bad.
---
All good nurses suffered during the learning curve, but are now enjoying the fruits.
---
Think of it like learning to play music on an instrument watching YouTube videos, rather than learning to read and play sheet music.
---
You’ll be much better, independent and dynamic - if you choose the tougher way that actually makes you learn something.
---
\*confused boner\*
---
So much sweat
---
I don't know why but the stretched out leatherface face made me laugh
---
Same,  i find him very fun to play until ppl started using OoO. Now he's just Sad Face instead.
---
[removed]
---
No mori? I’m jealous
---
Yeah, a year ago when people would slug all the time, so at least one person running Unbreakable was mandatory. 
---
Who still calls Iron Will mediocre?
---
Except we are not talking about "most of the good perks", we are talking about how more of the survivor perks on average are **garbage**.
---
They aren’t that rare. I have 37 of them now
---
So what's the counter to Lithe, Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, etc? Imo it's hard to argue that MoM was doing substantially more to benefit survivors than any of the perks I just named as you're essentially just getting a free speed boost off the hit. It didn't do anything to extend the majority of chases beyond an extra 10-20 seconds. Even if all four survivors run it, you're still only looking at 40-80 seconds of extra chase time. Sure, that's extra time for the others to work on gens but I think that's sort of the point.
---
Not every perk requires a direct counter as it would be counter-intuitive to the way the majority of survivor perks are supposed to function.
---
The killer would 4k virtually every game if there was a direct counter to every survivor perk. Perks are literally the only things keeping survivors alive during a trial.
---
He’s a really fun killer when his ability works, butttt sometimes you can’t take him out of it no matter how long you stare straight at him
---
I highly recommend not playing killer right now. With Ghost Face out and Killers being way better at farming bp, there's not a lot of survivors playing right now, so your queue times will be long and unbalanced.

I think it should be 40/50/60 or 50/60/70. 90 at tier 3 seems a bit strong
---
They only released a killer so everyone who would usually play as a survivor tries the new killer instead. There are not enough survivors playing for the game to find survivors for each killer.
---
"This lobby doesn't have a God pallet! Enjoy your deathtrap, ladies!"

Yo add me! Psn frijolitodorito0
---
Nice. A lot have said they have gotten less than 5 even with a million bloodpoints
---
I feel selfish putting anything but a   gruesome gateau during this event but sometimes I just don’t have one. Dont judge me okay!
---
Yeah me too , I thought they were just mad or something but it’s consistent
---
wow, my first time seeing his mori and it’s hands down the best one.
---
the fact that he performed it on a MegHead in this video was the icing on the cake.
---
Like the same guy got banned for showing how to swap weapons as killer or get a killer in your survivor lobby... Oh they never banned him..  rooWut
---
A **fog whisperer**
---
I love the design but unfortunately behavior said that they didn’t want to connect any specific ancient religion to plague. Hopefully they’ll change their minds like they did with clowns in the game because I really love this design.
---
Maybe they could add an animation of his exposed neck flesh searing from the flashlight beam. There's so much cool stuff they could do animation wise
---
What do you think of pig?
---
Okay that helps. But why do you have a work account for this game
---
Freddy is super fun if you know how to play him.
---
The Miner would be a cool killer.
---
I'll be honest, she's gone down a lot since her nerf. She's still better than Leatherface because her traps provide SOME pressure. She can also still be a nightmare with the right perks
---
DiD sOmEoNe SaY fNaF!?!?
---
Not sure man. Whenever these events roll around I see them handed out like candy
---
Chicken Soup for the Soul.
---
Remember when the game had chase music, instead of a muffled murmur in the background?
---
`dear diary I learnt something today, don't start at the gen or the masked man will kill you`
---
Camping should not be a strategy at this point, it should be more punishing for the killer (no patrolling and defending your hook isnt camping).

When i get home from work! Hopefully i remember.
---
you don't need to do that , i break him out of stealth while he is chasing me and I'm looking back
---
Board man gets paid
---
Honestly who would you recommend on the long run,if I choose leatherface mostly for the perk,if pig,for the fun and maybe perks
---
I've seen this too. I actually got jump scared by one appearing in front of me after I closed the hatch lol
---
He was about 5 meters away lol
---
In the long run, probably Pig. Leatherface is heavily unlikely to be worth it in the long run besides BBQ. Pig is fun.
---
This has been happening to me even before Ghostface though. It's actually why I started maining survivor.
---
well at least she had chicken
---
How do I lean with Ghostface?
---
Abreviation for no one escapes death
---
Survive Fith Wends, duh
---
You know what I'll take your advice but also wait to get the shard for pig and use it
---
You could’ve at least sped this up a little bit. Lol
---
Dwight lookin like a snack 😩
---
This is some weird math. Even then, as if all 4 survivors are gonna be looking his direction the whole game...?
---
Explain them please
---
Would main if she had this.
---
I do and i do just fine on both sides (though I mostly play killer)

Yea I know but you'll get used to it.

Cool story
---
New killer, event, killers are easier to get bp with, bam there's the reason
---
Ben 10.
---
It's still incredibly absurd that the tutorial addon is a very rare addon. Like bhvr, what were you thinking?
---
Should’ve used David, Ace, Ash, and Dwight
---
Pug is a douche
---
There is a new killer -&gt; Everyone plays killer -&gt; There are less survivors than usual -&gt; Killers have to wait to share small amount of survivors, Survivors get into games fast because there are so many killers
---
Pug isn’t a fog whisperer.
---
So basically it's because everyone is filling in as killer to play as Ghost face or to get maximum gain from bloodhunt?
---
Bullshit, visualizing where you will go after the amount of charge you have helps immensely don't give this "I suffered so others must too" bullshit
---
Haha no
---
Surveillance is an alright perk for pressuring gens and Make your Choice is really good on Nurse and Spirit who have great ways to move around the map fast and don't really get looped.

Funny you say that, just walked out of a game with 4 survivors running Wake Up. 
---
It goes both way my dude.
---
Thank you. I was honestly confused as heck. I'm relatively new to the game with only 90 hours and I'm still learning a lot.
---
Feeling is just thinking subconsciously
---
Killers running insta down add-ons and pink Mori’s  that tunnel and camp almost exclusively
---
Make you choice: unhooker gets exposed for a small bit
---
Surveillance: kicked gens will tell you when someone gets back on
---
Hangman’s: will tell you when someone sabos a hook and sacrificed hooks will respawn
---
Solid.
---
clearly you weren't playing during the hollow blight event, now that was the least enjoyable.
---
I usually mark that if one survivor DCs as soon as I look but the remaining three survivors give me a good challenge (without being toxic). I had fun but that one guy kinda ruined it.
---
I had a fun interaction with a Ghostface on one of the swamp maps where I kept trying to break his stealth while he tried to stalk me around a bunch of crates. We kept crouching out of each others sight and also occasionally peeking while going around the props in a circle. 
---
I haven't been able to play as him yet but I do find him fun to play against.
---
This is usually how the first few days of a new chapter go, also with the bloodhunt going on it almost doubles down. If you play survivor you will also see a majority of the new killer for a few days as well. You'll learn the pattern as each new chapter comes out
---
Ayyyy, we lit.
---
That's adorable!
---
Yea as someone that started out againest these people it was painful but as I played more and more it got better. Good luck I guess.
---
Dude both survivors and killers are being toxic.
---
I’m sick of people trying to divide the community.
---
This meme was made for DS, but ironically, ds is still a useful meta survivor perk
---
Keyboard doesn't work for everyone. My hands are too small for it, and nerve damage makes it harder to move my fingers consistently on a flat surface  (typing, writing) some people just prefer controllers.
---
I think my favorite thing is when the killer just carries the AFK person around all game. It's pretty funny to watch and is what I do when I see someone is AFK.
---
Was Wake Up changed? Why am I suddenly seeing a lot of people talking about it?
---
Surveillance is a good monitoring perk because you’ll know if they start working on a gen again. Depending on what killer you play you could easily sneak up on them again. With make your choice if you find the rescuer it’s a one shot, and even if you don’t it makes the rescuer less productive because they’re scared because they’re exposed.
---
Leatherfaces perks are amazing too and either killer is fine but I just think that saying pigs perks are useless is a bit of an overstatement.
---
Which one was the Wraith?
---
Thanks I thought so too.   Sad when a group of people take the fun out of gaming for others.
---
Yea it’s easy to stalk. But it’s also easy to sit there and hold M1 on a gen. What’s your point?
---
well yeah but they didn’t complete all the gens
---
I like playing as him because I can t bag with the survivors (not in an aggressive or toxic way) and I feel like we're actually having fun together. Also pretending to do gens like with pig. Very fun
---
That was me. :)
---
Helllllll ya
---
Please dont
---
So a perk is only good if it's meta?
---
Also, this is just a lack of counterplay you're suggesting.
---
It isn't, which is why a survivor getting uppity and hitting you with that "reported for farming" is so funny
---
What was in the end scene was a small, drowned kid. Not a massive, machete wielding man with a hockey mask which everyone knows Jason as
---
Thank fucking god no one owns or wants quentin perks, so I'll be able to play killer on the final day of the bloodhunt
---
This ought to be higher up.  Surprised so few players are noticing this.
---
You can no longer tell if the killer is coming closer to you or further away.  If he is on the other side of the wall to you, you have no clue whether you are running into him or away from him.
---
It's very broken.
---
I've been queuing as Huntress for this exact reason. 
---
People seem to appreciate it until that realize I'm trying to burn through my backlog of Iridescent Heads before I prestige.
---
Reverse bear traps don’t activate on hatch close.  It’s stupid as hell but that’s the way it works.
---
Also easy to play Mike and get tier 3 evil within and 1 shot the whole team instead of 1 guy like gf. Wanna nerd him too while you're at it lol?
---
having basically an innate light-born would be an interesting passive secondary ability to have base on a killer
---
Curly Bill#4131
---
It’s not about that lmao. It’s about the fact that your muscle memory actually plays the nurse and not your eyes.
---
Do as you do but I’m just telling you it isn’t good
---
thanks man, it's been one hella of a grind, i'm thinking of buying ghostface and level him up as my next killer
---
It’s random
---
thx man :)
---
thank you :)
---
Exactly. Miller is a big hoe
---
Michael has different tiers this guy just fucks in a matter of 5 seconds. Michael is fairly balanced besides the exposed affect in my opinion.
---
It takes around 5-10 minutes for me, Am I the only one that doesn’t have problems?
---
Do they deactivate? Because it was activated before
---
Oh gr8, that bug its back...
---
Bro, that suuuucks. The only time I think I've ever done something like that is if the first survivor is super toxic. Ex. I had a game recently with a Jane constantly teabagging me, and though I didn't hard tunnel her I didn't shy away from chasing her whenever I saw her. Wound up killing her first and felt so good about it I let the rest live. But there's no need to go picking favorites and treating survivors with preference, that's where I agree it gets shitty.
---
You get like a 4% chance to get better stuff. It's not worth it at all!
---
Console Dbd actually doesn’t support M&amp;K lol you have to use an adapter which is typically around 90 dollars anyways lmao
---
bUt YoU hAvE tO hIt SkIlChEcKs AnD tHaT’s HaRd!
---
As someone who plays both sides, I think there's a fun challenge and playstyle to running a pure hex build. I wouldn't want that taken away exactly. I think there should be other ways to make totem breaking difficult. Make it take longer and add hard skillchecks frequently. Failing skillchecks would cause a massive penalty to progression but wouldn't alert killer, for instance.
---
Jeffs rise up
---
Yeah Matchmaking is kinda sketchy these days.
---
As soon as you notice a survivor way outplaying just look for a weaker link. 
---
If no weaker link is to be found, well shit, try getting used to the way the killer can play i guess. Like getting a feel for how long frenzy lasts.
---
Keep at it Mate.
---
Little thing i learned the other day: 
---
Survivors Pulse/Aura shown by Frenzy when you stab someone also affects people hiding in Lockers. So if you ever see a pulse not moving at a location that seems to be a locker, free grab for you.
---
It’s been proven that there is no proof in better item drops. I only prestige after I use up all the add ons and offerings I care for.
---
Lol that’s not how it works
---
Sounds like they should give the survivors some counter ability like being able to stare back and cancel out his stalking ability! *...Wait. *
---
Oh my lord
---
Only killer I prestiged was clown, at p3 level 50 and it's not really noticable from a regular level 50 bloodweb
---
Quality bait right here boys grab your fishing poles
---
Ever get stunned and end up on top of a pallet and everyone starts tbagging together? Great times
---
Are you on console? I hear frame rates drop drastically when playing her on console. I wouldn't be surprised if people stopped using her.
---
no, make it so it appears often, is still purple rarity
---
I’m playing on PS4 and I have no trouble with “revealing” so far. Seems kinda easy tbh.
---
happy cake day
---
Yes. He gets an outfit variant with a white striped cloak and hood.
---
Idk if they changed it since I was heavy into the game but aim more at their chest/neck area than their face.
---
When will killers learn to never try to down the unhooked survivor
---
Since it’s double bp a lot of people will be trying to play as killer since you can get a heck of a lot more blood points.
---
People would say it isn’t worth, with having the cosmetic store being added way back. If you don’t play this game as much or don’t have time, don’t prestige. If you play a lot, go for P3 50 because why not. Just how I think of it
---
Oh thank you I didn't even realise until you said haha :)
---
Matchmaking is sure as hell wild nowadays.
---
How do you throw someone off your shoulder?
---
why do you have sole survivor on if you’re not running any aura-reading perks??
---
This tbh. Found it better to just play the game and develop a feeling on where she'll blink. I've gotten 3ks and 4ks with her, and I've seen people on console clearly have no issues wiping out a whole squad within minutes. Just takes a lot of practice.
---
Pig isn't Steel and Nurse isn't Ghost/Psychic?
---
Only prestige if you care about the cosmetics honestly. Though I actually think the bloody wraith clothes are pretty intimidating.
---
He made a Reddit to embarrass himself by saying lounge. That’s tough.
---
Yes on ps4. Is she too good?
---
Yo the wake up bug is getting out of hand. Please devs do something about this :L
---
Homie earned 400 points... that's pretty brutal lol
---
That's literally the point. Ghostface was designed to be the first *true* stealth killer.
---
Wake Up is broken, somehow. It's giving the 15% "Gate opening speed bonus" to seemingly ALL ACTIONS like repairs, healing, etc. 
---
Basically it's similar to Legion running blade addons when they were causing infinite mending.
---
Pictures you can hear
---
Where is this from? I don't recognize it
---
He should be wearing the face of James A Janisse
---
And when you call them out they pretend they dont know its bugged .. come on now
---
Freddy is Psychic.
---
Being burnt doesn't make you Fire type. It's actually a pretty good point why you would not be a Fire type...
---
What did Double Blade do
---
ok?
---
Every fucking game, its like and instant snap to a different direction and it fucks up my chases.
---
yeah it's happening
---
What's up with wake up
---
This is lazy
---
&gt;What did Double Blade do
---
I'm sure you can easily find youtube videos about it. Basically it caused a single Mending to last several MINUTES.
---
James deserves a DBD cosmetic like that.
---
What if there was a perk, that randomly gave you two perks when you load into a map, you'd have 5 perks, but two of them are completely random
---
They also didn’t know how to rescue because like only one person was unhooked the whole game
---
Wait, are you saying that Myers would only be balanced if they took away his exposed effect? You know, the mechanic that his entire kit is based around?
---
Oh you meant the infinite mending
---
This is a fucking joke right, maybe instead of killers being oVeRpOwEreD you should get bEtTEr.
---
Me too. I have killed so many rocks
---
Especially since every lunge is the same speed and distance
---
To me. Its not worth it.
---
kind of like 'Oh no he shined a light in my eyes and now my feet are stuck to the ground'
---
This need more upvotes
---
See a totem, destroy a totem
---
If you're gonna cry, at least don't create a pussy fake account and use your own. Lol.
---
I often wonder how they're so successful at everything in those masks. I put a halloween mask on and can't breathe or see shit xD
---
Yes
---
Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3
---
I understand that, I have a fair amount of hours in this game and I’m still getting destroyed by survivors
---
Was happening to me earlier. Just tried again and took about 5 mins this time
---
apple dwight jeans
---
&gt;Oh you meant the infinite mending
---
It was an unintended effect and people started to abuse left and right. Players that never played Legion suddenly were and using Double Blades while at it.
---
Since it was insanely easy to spot this based on that player's gameplay history, BHVR started straight up banning whoever was caught blatantly exploit that build.
---
Oh thank you I only watched the original and the remake
---
what else is dwight 😏
---
Honestly he isnt, you can hear his robes wavering around when he is stealthed pretty loudy, just need a headset
---
100%
---
I’m back to trying. Going on 15 minutes now
---
okay I did some research because I had some trouble placing exactly when it happened
---
[it happened in 1.5 which  was on the 27th of april and was closest to bill and the doctor](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch_Notes_1.5.0)
---
The third one actually isn't that bad. I've seen all but the second one.
---
oink
---
Apple bottom jeans?
---
and change his chase music to that one clown/carnival music
---
cuz that boye is a BOTTOM
---
The way I see it, your the toxic one here.
---
Those add ons make it so you have to be 8m near him to spot him
---
It's not a detriment to survivor play so you know they won't.
---
Every killer that i prestiged only got worse. Lol. I recommend planning your loadout perks, and once you get them, stop haha.
---
I'm having a look at pics now why is his chainsaw so fancy haha seems weird and corny but I love weird and corny so I would most likely enjoy it
---
It wasn't just double blade. Even just the green blade (But more noticeable with purple) caused longer mending times each time you got hit with Deep Wound. 
---
Running double blade made the bug extremely apparent though to the point of being downright gamebreaking.
---
Literal word from the people who enforce the rules versus your weak attempt at rhetoric. I've been a pastafarian longer than you've been alive you dimwitted numbnut. You are legitimately retarded.
---
Where's Meg? Oh, there's Meg. Wait.
---
I know him. Didn’t lag switch, it was poor host connection. Just watch the vod.
---
Everyone that cant cleanse totems. Its not even that hard to do.
---
This is a bug affecting a bunch of people including me currently, not intended. I think many people commenting on this post may be suffering form the same bug.
---
wtf are you talking about?
---
those things are basically common raritty....
---
Never have I ever seen a McDonald’s burger look that great irl
---
Because black metal
---
Gruesome.
---
It happens with Julie as well. A lot of the sounds are way bugged with this update. Devs aren’t good devs lol
---
Copying and pasting the same response over and over again really doesn't help your case you know. And again, even if it was lag switching, you're breaking community rules!
---
Same with Julies
---
Wait i just re-read this and it's really stupid to think that 32% gen regression equals 8% increase of ghostface's detection radius
---
Ghostface definitely suffers if the survivors have object of obsession and the survivors don't get him out of stealth. I've looped him when I was able to see him right through the walls and he can't do anything about his cloak to get a terror radius.
---
fair enough :-)
---
I played almost this same game. Ghostface made two moris in the first two minutes. A player who had a cake was down in the first ten seconds. I had a laugh attack thinking about that poor fella who got a cake in order to get a lot of BP and end up with 448 bp
---
Because you’re interacting with the host, who has poor connection. Players wait for host’s machine = spikey lag. Again, just watch the vod.
---
Wait, so its not being extremely common for others? In both prestiges with ghostface, ive gotten ultra rares like rares, every other bloodweb has at least an ebony mori or ultra rare addon. i thought it was bugged.
---
What a stupid idea lmao
---
Alright maybe I shouldn’t of messaged him but it’s like every single game someone quits for the dumbest reason. This guys reason is legit I don’t like that killer so I’m going to quit. I can’t even imagine how many games this guy has dced since he came out.
---
it was a needed change so devs don't have to think about enduring when doing balance changes
---
How does BHVR manage to mess up a perk that much... Jfc
---
We can't expect people to not be assholes and consciously go out of their way to abuse bugs (double blade, pinky finger and now wake up) but what we should expect, is BHVR handling this situation with severity. 
---
They didn't seem to have trouble tracking people abusing Double Blades.
---
You’re forgetting the bleeding one.
---
No me :)
---
This has to be a joke...
---
I would agree but I don't think the devs think about anything while working on this game
---
Baby dweet
---
I didn’t know they were newbies as the first one no one saved him and the second one killed himself but I didn’t see anyone else so I was confused and thought they were being abandoned by 2 SWF
---
Is it a bug?
---
I mean, who sits there and checks who's the killer Everytime? Usually survivors just go on to the next match instead of blocking.
---
Lots of things cause ping spikes. But tbh even if this person were lag switching (which that’s not what it looks like) you’re breaking rule 3 of the sub.
---
Awesome
---
I mean, I do really well with him.
---
Enduring was buffed overall. As for DS, don't pick them up.
---
they forgot to add in the patch notes that self-care, unbreakable, and boil over are now useless sense half of the playerbase can't do those actions
---
easier said than done when you’re solo
---
Yeah I think the DS one was fine, I don't like the MoM one though.
---
Yeah. If the map had literally no obstacles, and if % actually meant meters youd be right. The 8% just means he's more likely to be broken out of stealth when he's literally on your screen and you can see him at point blank range. He's not "32% more likely to be revealed", it's for consistency.
---
I only play solo
---
You need multiple people to cleanse a totem?
---
Yes. Leveling survivors I will get 1 maybe 2 gateaus in three bloodwebs. As killer I will get 1-3 on a single bloodweb. Wish they would appear more often for survivors.
---
Basically fancy bloody clothing and a but better chance at better add-ons and items but I takes away all perks and add-ons(offering and items too but you keep the 3 perks you get) you got from the last prestige or pre prestige. Basically restarting your character for fancy bloody clothing
---
Get rid of your current perks, gives you blood parts of the character original outfit, pats you on the back and says good luck.
---
Yeahh i never prestige no point it’s fun though
---
The one ghostface I played against killed all my teammates, put me in the dying state, and then let me crawl to the nearby hatch before slamming it in my face and moried me.
---
Yeah this is basically my opinion on the matter.
---
He should have some kind of horse charge with the whinny and everything
---
Shyyyyyyt what level are you?
---
A piece of blood clothing, head or weapon. With a slight increase in rare items in generated bloodwebs. 
---
Is it worth it ??
---
Well that's up to you. I would say prestige licensed killers and with the original killers if you get a bad 50 levels of bloodwebs use your items and prestige. If you get a good bloodwebs going for the first 50 levels keep it. The rng is so weird in this game with perks.
---
Yeah because it didnt take them weeks to fix the legion bug. Do you seriously thing they cater to survivors? Survivors have had two overpowered perks basically completely gutted in the last 6 months. Decisive strike is kinda still viable but still
---
What's going on with Wake Up! ?
---
Omgshecanbesansundertale
---
You don’t need manners when killing people.
---
I only got one extra rare before this Moro
---
Ranks don't mean shit.  I suck ass at running the killer around; most chases end within ~10 seconds, yet I got to red ranks last season...
---
it’s just really risky
---
\*LAUGHS IN DOCTOR\*
---
Well i had two disconnects straight away after i downed them so bit of waste of time tbh
---
Lmao. I was confused till I read the username
---
How the hell you Mori in the first 2 minutes? Was it ebony?
---
Bit of an unpopular opinion on a forum where I imagine a lot of people condone school shootings
---
Only for killers unfortunately. Would love to have 4-5 cakes every match.
---
Yes he can. Just swinging his weapon will break stealth.
---
Youre right they need to give survivivors something to counter him with like maybe make it ao they can break him out of his stealth if they look at him
---
If youre playing killer, don't face camp.  If you're playing survivor, don't tea bag.  That's all you need.
---
*What kind of fool do you take me for? He’s this ghostface, you’re this ghostface, is there any other ghostfaces I should know about?* lmao

Honestly there is no rules really. There is alot of made up rules and stuff for decency but alot of people are pricks even if you play nice. For tips I recommend not playing as of now as it's impossible to get a match as a new dlc came out and everyone is playing the new character. Ok actual tips would be starting as Survivor as it's easier and gets you in the game smoother. there is also tutorials in the help menu for free points to level up your character of choice, spend wisely as it's hard to get alot of points also
---
If you get salty its ok to camp a hooked survivor, but you will VERY quickly learn it gets you barely any points
---
idk people like tore into me no idea.
---
I think a lot of people are survivors and don't like when killers gripe about perk changes. It was just for the meme.
---
Forgive them oh lord for they know not what they do.
---
Why wouldn't they be? I still have firecrackers to use lol
---
Thanks for the advice friends! I only bought him cause I like the movies and not viability. So when everyone is screaming about the red ranks and I'm rank 16,I'm confused
---
I missed your art. Give more chonky clown
---
Unbreakable is a really clutch perk. This has fucked more killers than probably any other perk. You don’t know how often killers are saying in their head, “I hope he doesn’t have unbreakable”. It’s an exceptional perk, if you don’t want to run it then you can’t really complain if a killer slugs.
---
All those examples involve strategy and patience, luckly I have both. I dont care enough want to dc. I find beating those odds amazing and fun. People who feel i hate this i want to dc shouldnt play this fame because one senario you want to dc in turns into multiple things that will make you DC. Players who DC should just stop playingthey ruin the community and ruin games for others. Also the fact that you cant believe that people dont dc over that kinda shows a few things
---
So does DS but that doesn’t stop it from being a meta perk.
---
My friend made this meme to raise awareness to how fast vaulting is unnecessarily difficult now, and how it’s a lot more difficult to play survivors
---
“Why that’s the most diabolical krabby patty ever spawned.”
---
I SAW THAT TOO ONE TIME!!
---
I break him out just fine though, and I play on controller. Just have him in the center of your screen and a sound will start playing. Keep your camera on him until the sound ends and a MoM effect appears and he's broken out.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I figured something was up with the meta, double BP and new killer might have some influence of the game.
---
100% yes to everything in this
---
There’s an embarrassing number of glitches that came out with this patch. The almost nonexistent music/heartbeat/killer sounds such as the chainsaw, the wake up glitch, the BBQ glitch, getting reduced gen speed for no reason, survivors getting stuck on top of objects, people getting their profiles reset. They must have rushed it out for the anniversary but still how does this even happen
---
I mean he didn't insult the killer or say he shouldn't be doing that
---
Saaaaame lol
---
hours for level 25?
---
Can someone... explain the bug? Bc I can't find what it is
---
The fck does a school shooting have to do with the post.
---
then die on the ground like the others :D
---
Man that glitch made me nuts looken for my last stack
---
What feature? S
---
Everytime I do a skill check the chance of me getting a wide decreases by 103%
---
A totem counter? Small game... I do not understand the people who speak before even knowing the basics, small game is a basic perk

Ha! Try playing killer...
---
I wont DC, but Trapper sucks. I've been playing for months and still for the life of me cant avoid his traps
---
Hell, make that a feature. And while you're at it, make the killer get catapulted into the skybox at mach 3 when they whiff
---
I never said that i don't believe people who say they never DC, i said i don't believe people who say they have never even WANTED to DC. 
---
There's a big difference there.
---
the bug makes it so that you get the 15% speed bonus on ALL actions, rather than just door opening (as it should be).
---
I don't ever dc.  
---
With that said Doctor just irks the hell out of me.  He always owns the survivors whenever I play against him.  I think I've only escaped once against him.
---
Spirit wrecked me so hard my ass hurt.
---
A totem counter, AKA how many totems are left in the game 🙄
---
My queue times are fine, but that’s because matchmaking gave up on putting me against people in yellow ranks.
---
Que
---
115% or the average killer speed like trapper and wraith
---
Why would i want to DC? What benefit does dcing bring? What reason justifies DCing?
---
Yes. Once the event is over they're gone forever.
---
I'm like, 90% sure I made the first post, but I'd love to see which fog whisperer is out there promoting this bug
---
It's one thing to notice something like this and have a laugh a couple of games, but to be in a position like that and sharing/promoting how to? 
---
Tsk tsk
---
Now that’s something I didn’t know....
---
You hear the air flow?
---
You are prompted when the killer shuts the hatch right?
---
The icon disappears from your screen and will show only the generators ?
---
That's weird
---
This is new for you? Been happening to me for the past year and a half I’ve been playing
---
There are already Bug reports about it on the Forum as well as multiple posts about it on here.
---
People are thankfully not being quiet about this.
---
Not the point
---
Big coc doc
---
It's been super common for me. I'm level 29 and have 8 of them. Got my first one on level 9
---
DS stops tunnelling killers, which is far more useful than being the only one who gets up after getting slugged by a killer.

Very few times I have got a wholesome message lol feel free to add me at StrawberryJake on ps4, my wife plays aswell!
---
Autolock?? Theres auto lock??
---
Wraith and Nurse is the best part🌚👍
---
I mean, his P3 mask is already that pretty much
---
MoM just got nerfed with this patch. Decisive is almost non existent if you don't tunnel or if you do, don't immediately rehook that person. Dead Hard is easy to play around unless you are versing really smart survivors who use it to cut distance to pallets / window rather than getting iFrames (but these players rare).
---
SWF is not the worse thing in DBD, you just need to think differently. I guess you must have played SWF to understand how they work. 
---
While you are chasing someone, you can't just hold W and don't think about anything else. As soon as you have someone hooked and starts chasing a second member of their team, you need to try and read what they are thinking / saying. "He is chasing me, go for a save" and then you cut them off.
---
Thanks for the tip.

I mean, they could try to give the effect. There are several skins with a drip effect already, and it would be cool to see.
---
Imagine the mindgames with the missed skillcheck ragdoll!
---
&gt;Killer nearby
---
&gt;Commit to gen
---
&gt;Killer whips around corner with lunge attack
---
&gt;Incoming skillcheck
---
&gt;Mash space to intentionally miss
---
&gt;Rocket jet all the way into killer shack to safety of god pallet
---
&gt;Killer whiffed the attack and has now catapulted in the same direction
---
&gt;Killer appears directly behind you
---
&gt;Nothing personal kid
---
Same as Trapper.
---
That’s why you bind your action key to a thumb mouse button
---
Yes, it’s like a whooshing sound when the hatch is open. The louder it is the closer.  If the killer shuts the hatch it lets you know.
---
I wanna run self care balanced adreniline and something else...
---
The hatch gives off a distinct audio cue that indicates it is near. If the killer shuts it, the endgame collapse triggers and the timer pops up
---
Yes bc killers don't have a swath of powerful and bullshit perks that hand them free downs. 
---
Remember how long it took to fix the legion bug? This is a simple fix that they just haven't gotten to.
---
i think it is because of the add-ons they use maybe that's why people are confused including me
---
They won't bc this isn't on the same scale
---
Yup
---
Stalky boi
---
Is he immune to blinds?
---
I think you broke your rule with the \^\^s
---
I think he's at a perfect spot where he is at currently. There is no need for nerfs, There is plenty of counterplay even in non swf matches. Some people just gotta learn to get better at the game instead of complaining about something new
---
Would monstrous shrine cancel this in basement
---
Or next year
---
Hillbilly, all of them are toxic
---
It also rewards terrible survivor gameplay. But I mean they each have their uses is what I’m getting at.
---
Adorable
---
Lol thanks heheh
---
I think they focus too much at balancing for low ranks, they need to fix the 3min genrush with ruin at rank 1 and do something to players in swf...
---
FIX THE 3 STACK LOBBIES WHERE A SOLO NEVER JOINS. IT'S WASTING MY LIFE.
---
and your forced to do the remaining generators?
---
Or hope that the killer opens the gate?
---
Wym its flawless lmao
---
Ah snap, looks like I’m gonna be a Ghostface main. Got almost 40 of those suckers now on him
---
DS punishes toxic killer gameplay more than it does *anything* else.
---
I never thought I'd hear a reference to covalent bonds on this subreddit.
---
Take an upvote for surprising me.
---
When the EGC triggers, the exit gates become available to open.
---
Meg!
---
I can understand NoED being a crutch perk, but how is BBQ? It literally has the easiest counter/s in this game, just hide in a locker, or be within range. Or, have distortion. Tbh, I really doubt anybody would really use it, outside of Huntress mains, if it didn't give the double bloodpoints anyways.
---
No no no we don’t need more op nurse mains
---
Hey if Surviviors aren't allowed to play stealthy bc killers don't find it fun, then Surviviors should have a way to shut down a stealthy killer.
---
My point is Unbreakable isn’t a terrible perk for a survivor to carry under their sleeve.
---
I see by your flair you're not too fond of ghosty boi
---
Every Ghostface I've gone against always use the more rare add ons that make him stalk us to exposure too quickly to do anything. It's either a 4k or one of us is lucky enough to find hatch. I haven't opened an exit gate in forever, do the exit tunnels still look the same??
---
It’s not because we like you- it’s a professional courtesy
---
some of us do have education, though it is not always evident. truly the only metaphor worthy of expressing my passion
---
Some people wait 20+ minutes for a game, like in AUS, it’s the usual there, so of course they’re entitled to not want to farm, they want to actually play. Not everyone is so privileged to be able to find a game in a couple minutes
---
Recovering from being slugged isn't as powerful as stunning a tunnelling killer off of you
---
no, this is a mating ritual
---
I said some people, not myself.
---
And it would still be great on billy/nurse regardless of the bloodpoints. Other characters, maybe, maybe not.
---
Its def poor connection he streams so
---
Any new patches/hotfixes to the audio? Survivor is unplayable for me, I can't hear the terror radius.
---
They cant hug the wall and fast vault from what iv heard
---
Fast vaulting just isn’t possible for a lot of windows. This may seem like a “haha survivors bad, they can’t fast vault now” but this is a huge nerf
---
So we should all have DS and never run Unbreakable is what your saying? Only use meta builds?
---
When im playing myers and not pig i just stay still with stalking on and i always 98% my t3 and wait to see if someone falls, they almost always get near and teabag so i just take it and t3 their arses to the hook
---
this is how the exorcist started man spooky
---
Run whatever you wanna run idrc. I'm only saying that unbreakable isn't as powerful as DS bc stunning off of the killers shoulder is better than recovering from a slug.
---
Yea sum time ago now
---
OOF this one is good. Like really good. Also plausible. I’ve been seeing a lot of cool ideas but most of them don’t feel like they could actually happen, but I have hope for this one.
---
As someone who plays both sides as close to 50/50 as I can (killer queue times are garbage atm): I agree that swf is a little busted given the right circumstances. SWF doesn’t make bad survivors magically good. It just makes strong survivors even stronger. I’ve played against both types and the former type is way more common and you probably don’t even notice that they’re swf.
---
The solution isn’t to nerf survivors. Solo survivors will have it even worse then. They need to first try to make the solo experience as close as it can be to the swf experience and that is by providing information to the player. Number of totems cleansed, who the killer is chasing (Not just the obsession), gen progress, and more stuff like that. After they do that they need to buff killer accordingly to balance it out. To be honest, I don’t see them doing this but this is the best scenario for all sides.
---
Also about the crutch perks, I get complaining about MoM but dead hard and dstrike? Really? Dead hard just wait a second before hitting to bait it out and for dstrike just don’t tunnel and if you do tunnel just slug for a while. Dstrike is hardly a problem for me as killer as I just don’t tunnel unless I absolutely need to.
---
Can we chill?
---
Holy shit, this is dope as hell. Good job!
---
Traps only activate if a gen pops after the trap has been set on the survivor's head. If they don't complete gens after traps have been placed, the traps will never go off.
---
Like what ones?
---
_Happiness oinks_
---
I was not prepared to laugh so hard. 
---
And now my stomach hurts bc of it. 
---
Take my upvote. You made my night
---
Oh no I love Ghostface I'm maining him and got him P2 I just think he is actually broken just not in the OP sense just broken. I really want him fixed but if they fix him he'll probably lose alot of his bullshit strategies that make him good. He is just too buggy and able to get away with alot of bullshit like canceling people breaking him out of stalk by crouching. Ill prefer a Fun and difficult killer to play then a buggy mess that's Ghostface he's like Legion 2.0 but way less annoying and just bullshit.
---
You can escape via the hatch wearing a RBT, even if it’s active.
---
Dud amandas is so cuteee
---
Say it with me kids.
---
*Exploiting, in most games is bannable.*
---
she may have hid, but she helped climb those bps slightly!
---
It's just this sub lmao, they like the memey Scary Movie antics instead of Scream's dark undertone. Not that it's a bad thing
---
Haven't seen Ghostface today at all on xbox, and I didn't get to play yesterday so still haven't played against him, x(
---
They made it easier for survivors to reveal him, and I think they reduced some of his add ons or something. I came out in some patch notes 3.0.0
---
This is so true
---
When introducing my friends to the game, after the first few matches an they start grasping what's happening, they start asking for route plans and making strategies in the lobby an then they ask me what I think about all their plans.
---
"Let's wing it an see what happens"
---
Yes you keep them.
---
BBQ+Chili and 3 Gateau's during the 2x bloodhunt
---
Lmao same player who then jumps on every platform available to Bitch about how mori is OP
---
imagine a floating set of trucker's clothes coming for you at 30 mph
---
First day it was really fun, now every other game someone has OOO and just follows me around messing up my stalking...
---
Not cool at all.
---
Holy shit that was so intense lol good ol ace
---
Made complimentary add-on's (new link posted above)
---
Hex because BBQ is already so high ranked you should get Hex Ruin
---
Perhaps the best cosmetic idea I've seen yet.
---
Ok? Lol
---
ahh darnit, let me see if I can change it
---
Killer mains are rejoicing everywhere on the planet.
---
finally some justice
---
Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 it 8/8
---
That’s the best part about fighting him he’s one of the only scary killer in a list of Spirit, Hag, and GhostFace
---
I've noticed this doesn't happen as often when playing ghostface, like if the killer can do it then it's no longer special and all they do is point instead of t-bag.
---
You’re kidding me right? So people should be able to disconnect without any consequences?
---
[killers be like](http://imgur.com/Y1u8wa7)
---
It can’t be changed, and if it was, dur to having a changing background you can’t just slap one of them on it and call it a day. It also annoys me
---
Me (rank 7) my friend (rank 9) and another (rank 17 new player). Got matched with a rank 20 doctor with two perks.  I was hosting as well.  The 4th survivor random was rank 10.

It isn't as good considering a lot of the cosmetics are Auric Cells only.

yeah you need to be within their terror radius
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
wraith can pseudo-counter borrowed time as well
---
They changed the system
---
Whats the issue with wake up?
---
I mean...
---
It’s giving a 15% speed bonus on all actions (healing, repairing gens, searching chests, cleansing totems, etc) instead of only increasing door opening speed. Another example of something that wasn’t a part of any changes for the update that they somehow managed to fuck up lol
---
i finally played after over a week. got in a few hrs of 2x bp, niice! lmao, YESH
---
I'm just skipping this event honestly.
---
To play killer you have to wait an hour for queue times
---
To  play survivor you gotta endure getting camped and tunneled off hook. Really killed my motivation to even boot the game.
---
When they know that perk is broken so much, yes. That would still be bug exploiting for which they banned in the past
---
Oh shit thats crazy lol, sounds tempting to use but i'd rather not haha
---
Gotcha. That makes sense due to the fact that it's the only item in the web that is dynamic rather than static. Thank you for letting me know, and keep up the great work. I'll be sharing it with my gaming mates. : )
---
Yes.
---
Wow, no one has ever suggested this ever.
---
Yeah, I used to use wake up all the time (one of my fav perks) but when I saw that I stopped using it because I didn’t want to get in trouble lol but not as many people are talking about it (probably because it wasn’t a popular perk anyway) so not many people know. I don’t recommend using it. Even if the devs haven’t said anything about it yet doesn’t mean they won’t ban or punish for doing so
---
Excellent, thanks :)
---
You can keep your addons they said similar to the Wraith rework.
---
I know. It wasn't sarcasm lol
---
Yeah, I've noticed a handful of "that def should've hit" whiffs, seems the game can't handle certain snap strikes, where you juke and bait people or they try to juke you and somehow I hit the tree/wall instead.  It is what it is I guess, thankfully doesn't happen all the time for me.
---
I would rather disagree considering that using that bug was terrible, and using this bug is a FLAT 15% SPEED INCRASE. THATS INSANE. If you know that this perk is doing that, and you're using it, you should totally be banned.
---
His height is the issue lol.
---
Or
---
Me as killer: *brings bloody party streamers*
---
Survivors: *escape cakes*
---
Much appreciated &lt;3
---
It’s good for those who would wanna buy unlicensed killers and survivors though
---
Survivor standing literally right next to me, clearly looking behind them as I chase them: "Where is he?"
---
Survivor on a hook on the other side of the map blocked by like five walls: *pulls out telescope*
---
Oh Ho! Then come as close as you like.
---
I mean it is her job, she's the killer after all
---
Go ahead and name a "swath of powerful and bullshit perks that hand them free downs" OTHER then NOED, because yes, that ones bullshit. No, Moris dont count, and no, anything "on nurse" doesn't count either, because nurse is just busted in general.
---
I agree. I'm willing to bet that the people who defended Legions blade bugs suddenly changed tune when the bug helped Surviviors tho
---
20th post about it I see. There is a search option
---
I haven’t had any issues aiming my camera to break him out of his stalk. Sometimes, they can uncenter themselves, but you can usually fix it on your end before he can mark you anyway. You also should remember that he can take cover behind something and lean to prevent you from breaking him out. It’s not impossible, it’s just a skill that has to be learned. He literally just came out, of course no one can play perfectly against him immediately
---
Gonna be hard to use a flashlight on em.
---
21st post about it I see. It’s a visual bug
---
Hypocrites
---
That’s good if killers can’t hear my loud ass breathing then, thanks.
---
Haunted ground. Make your choice. Tuft/Tuftstone Myers.
---
Basically, there has to be a heartbeat to activate borrowed time. Night Shroud removes his heartbeat, therefore there is no heartbeat to activate borrowed time.
---
Yare yare. We don’t talk about that here
---
Solo Queue Survivor.
---
It sucks because as you said there are so many shite players but I do still enjoy it. I got the game to play it that way, so I do still enjoy it.
---
Sometimes as a killer I play normally and then one survivor gets so frusrated they kill themselves or DC, and then I'll farm with the others to try and make it up to them
---
Maybe. But not everyone. Bugs like this should be a bannable offense. a SWF, three of them running wake up? Thats completely illogical. It obviously wasn't by accident.
---
does spamming the drop button still work too???
---
Lmao, Ghost Face Op.....I swear people are just uninformed and lazy, defaulting to screaming OP. You do realize there's a specific way you have to go about breaking his stealth AND there are add-ons Ghost Face can use to reduce the distance you can break his stealth from...not to say the least about the faster stalk
---
I hate this fucking line, but git gud....the devs balancing Killers around misinformation and lower ranks is getting ridiculous
---
Exploiting, in most games is bannable
---
As it should be
---
I'd love to see entering madness 3 spawn them, as a second iridescent add on for doctor. Don't despair until you fail a skill check on them of complete it.
---
You seem shocked that an update fucked up the game.

One more thing I noticed. Do you know how to fix the end game emblem issue?
---
https://imgur.com/aLariMe

Sorry, I haven't seen the other posts. Nor did I get to see it in the patch notes. :|
---
Camping is fucking toxic and I’m a nea it’s also an easy way to get gen rushed at higher ranks
---
Rules unclear, RBT now give survivors a an extra health state when the timer runs out
---
I came on here to post the same thing. Same there here mate.
---
It’s fine by me actually, because quite a few ghostface don’t have hex ruin yet, which is a welcome change of pace
---
So wraith can actually not be shit now?
---
He's just shit.
---
For the emperor
---
Good for you. For some of us, it is. It isn't hurting you though, so...
---
And sometimes a survivor farts in my general direction from behind a wall while downed, and night shroud machine breaks
---
You probably made a mistake of deleting something while installing the skin pack. Go to your steam library, right click on dbd, properties, files, verify files. Once you’re done downloading base files, install my skin pack again. Don’t delete anything, just put the skin pack on top of already existing files
---
It’s not hard to learn the path of the blink after a few hours.
---
Why? The killer wastes their time to camp. Not to mention sometimes it's viable to camp and is a mechaic. Why do you keep making up these rules
---
Because that perk would either be useless or overpowered
---
It should grant it as if you had 4 stacks; but visually it's bugged to only show 3 stacks
---
Suviviors want killers to follow their made up bullshit rules
---
Q
---
His speed is not slowed.
---
24th post about it. It’s a visual bug listed in the patch notes
---
Again, for you. There's a lot of factors that go into it, some directly mechanic related, some match related, and some playstyle related. Not everyone has the same rate of learning, and some pick up on certain skills a lot quicker or easier than other skills. 
---
And again, it may not help YOU, but it causes you no detriment so what's your point?
---
How would it be overpowered if we have to use a perk slot for the advantage? 
---
Killers already go in game with Iron and Agitation and we can’t do anything about it but Just wait for hook.
---
Yep same thing happened to me because I didn't want to farm at all and just killed them. Oh boy do I love bloodhunts
---
They changed it last year and admitted that it was a bug or bad hit boxes.
---
25th post about it. It’s a visual bug listed in the patch notes. I think I’ll stop replying to this questions. There is a search option
---
Also, something to add, the add ons that let you stay in tier 1 are good for jumpscares and allow you to see where survivors are but make chases difficult (Myers is slower in t1 and also has a shorter lunge attack making it so you have to be really close to the survivor to land a hit, you can’t hold the button down to stretch it) which is why it’s a more difficult build
---
You need to keep him in the center of your screen. You will get a sound effect when it starts working and it builds until you reveal him.    
---
  
---
If you can't get it done fast, you have to hide and make sure he can't stalk you. Then you can play a little game with him, can you reveal him, or will he stalk you? It's fun.  
---
Remember, if you can't exactly reveal him because he's constantly hiding, you're still stalling him and wastin his precious time. So keep at it, it's not the end of the world if you can't reveal him.
---
Camping is a mechaic just like going after the weak suvivior especially when you see other suviviors near by.
---
ez report
---
Haunted grounds just grants the killer a 60 second insta down. Its raelly not that amazing, I can assure you. Its not uncommon for it not to be useful at all. and the arguement of "to prevent NOED" Thats why I was saying that NOED is busted. You're right, its stupid that thats the case. But to be fair, it hardly applies to this case. If you're worried about NOED its only dull totems it can go to. Also... um... its not that much slowdown Again just like... be scarce. You can work on a gen and still be sneaky. And no, theres not an issue. Yes, getting camped sucks. But its bad. Idoesn't work. It causes you to de-pip. Its just a terrible playstyle because its literally garenteed to fail and cause you to lose, as long as the survivors play intelligently and recognize its just camping. Ontop of that, yes it sucks to get camped, but it IS a stratagy for later on in the match, especially for stealth killers. Much as you don't like it, if your're a few feet away from a door, im not letting you go just like that. You're complaint of "Hands them a kill" Is not in either of these perks. It takes work and actual playing to get these perks to come into effect. You need to track down the make your choice person, which can be hard. Haunted grounds requires convient timeing to "hand you a kill" And more often then not ends up useless as it pops while they're at a good loop. Its not the perks "Giving the killer a free kill and therefore bull" Because a kill doesn't mean crap. A survivor can still pip off a kill. A killer can still pip off a three man escape.

Did you read my comment. Some people don’t know about the search option. Learn to not be a dick when someone asks a simple and quick question. Take notes from the others.
---
I don’t even have plague and this would make me buy her
---
well I mean it’ll bring way too many nurse players, as someone who plays both killer and survivor I know how much of a pain in the ass nurse is, and I don’t wanna have to face one every match or whenever I do face one I don’t want them to be able to tell where their blink is always gonna go without any skill and just by looking at it.
---
Because you already can find spots you can’t be carried to any hook from
---
usually their fixes aren’t actually fixes
---
Spirit. Don’t let anyone convince you otherwise. 
---
Seriously
---
Devs tested this in a ptb early in the first year of the game and it went awful. They made first stage of hook infinite and all that it was awful
---
It's definitely a poorly designed perk and the devs mentioned they wanted to change this perk in a stream a few months back. It encourages a very frustrating playstyle and like old ds, it's overall not a healthy for the game. Despite that, it's kinda shit now anyway. A rework is best case scenario for this perk.
---
lmao i love that pic
---
I would get spirit first. She's more viable imo and can work with a lot of different playstyles. Legion can be fun but isn't who I personally go for. I would watch gameplay and really look into their abilities, and decide based on which seems most fun and workable for you moreso than my or others opinions. Look at leisure play vs competitive play as well! Those are important when deciding on killers
---
&gt; Killers already go in game with Iron and Agitation 
---
LOL
---
Maybe at rank 20. 
---
At red ranks there is no space for terrible perks like these.
---
I've seen the temple like twice this week. I've seen autohaven and rotten fields countless times.
---
but this time they changed the flip phone :&lt;
---
You’re calling me a dick for telling people there is an option they might be interested in. Gotcha.
---
This was actually my friends first ever escape. I was on first hook right next to gate and Kobe'd, would you let me go?
---
I hope it gets fixed soon cause I always forget to check where the doors are after that last gen pops and the quicker opening saves me countless times.
---
You seriously reported a killer for not letting you survive? Yikes
---
im so on edge when i do gens, i just anticipate getting the urge to itch
---
Devs: let's nerf ALL the survivor perks!
---
Before this session I took it off to try out Urban Evasion too, Feels bad
---
NO, RESPECT MY HOOK
---
I am literally the opposite, I’m seeing everyone BUT him and I’m legit changing my steam name begging people to play him cause he’s fun to go up against even when you aren’t running direct counters like SOME people.
---
leatherface is licensed he ain't gonna get anything else.
---
If you like GOW I've heard they're wanting to do Egyptian mythology next. Off topic but still
---
I don’t think turning the camera would be enough to make it work since that would be kinda broken since you could hide behind a tree and point the camera in his direction... most likely it’s your body has to be pointing in his direction
---
That’s a leatherface exclusive
---
Or they could just implement in a system that tries to push people away from disconnecting by maybe having a cool down time or something. After looking back at this I do realize that I came at it with the wrong attitude. I don’t normally private message people who dc but I was just so tired of it happening every single game. I’ve deleted this as well so it’s not a big deal.
---
Bc he's a licensed killer and thats kinda his whole thing you can prestige for bloody cosmetics for free though
---
I think your a bit bias to survivors here. All that talk about the elites being pissed here can be said the same about the survivors which you should of acknowledged while adding to the argrument. The game has been survivor sided for years yet the devs wont do proper balance because they fear there own community that plays DBD, hence why the game seems to go back and fourth
---
It comes down to the DBD communtiy as a whole to stop tearing each other apart. However the devs don't take enough risks to even anything because of the fragile toxic state of DBD. 
---
One-sided people like you don't make the game better at all you make it worse you need to think both sides here not just you. If you want the game to get better don't be so selfish then.
---
Nah that’s too much, plus it sounds like you’re petty cause I shut down your suggestion. Thanks for the help, but I think the post is pretty obvious that I want a perk that speeds up the wiggle.
---
This actually made me laugh out loud
---
You're more of a cunt than a dick
---
Haha - I'm a Killer main. If he had been the last survivor, I'd have let him mouse away.

Imma just say if ya put up a cake and we all do too, we all stand to benefit here ya know? Let’s not leave a good 180k on the table. Not everyone is maxed out, have a heart. I’m trying to share D:
---
Messages like these always make the 4K more enjoyable for me. 
---
The only reason I keep messages enabled
---
Thank you very much.
---
Uh...there is a [Scream 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_3)...
---
I would suggest tunneling, camping, and using NOED to go from a 0k to 4K. good luck.
---
Doesn’t boil over speed the bar up too? Or does it only make the side to side movement of struggling more intense?
---
I give hatch or let them kobe if I notice a player doing all the work and the rest of the team screws up. Probably because I know what it feels like.
---
No of course not. But if they are next to each other, say a unhook, I'm going after the weaker one.
---
So licensed killers cosmetics are free
---
Cool
---
Yeah, maybe that's my problem. I don't tunnel or camp as the Doctor. I actually purposefully go after new hooks (for my BBQ) and drag out the match till there's usually 1 gen left.
---
Perhaps I should go to Basement Insidious Bubba?
---
Killers that farm are just getting bloodpoints n I like that, but killers that go into a match serious and *decide* to be nice are the true angels and deserve the world.
---
I set my skill check button to mouse5 so I can do one-handed skill checks
---
As killer I’m the only one using a grotesque cake 90% of the time. Don’t y’all survivors wanna share. Any salt I get I shove it in their face I gave them 2x 😂
---
No I wish! That’s what I thought it did when it first came out. All it does is it makes the swaying more intense for the killer, and hook auras aren’t shown within 14 meters. If they bumped the hook meters to 20 or something it would be better .
---
I've had a game before where had 1 hooked, 2 down and downed the last guy across the map after a chase and  the hooked guy Kobe'd, revived them and completed the last gen with 3 adrenaline escapes. Feelsbad.
---
Nope, reported him for not playing fair. Lolz
---
Yes, although he is the only licensed with cosmetics besides prestige cosmetics (minus ghostface)
---
I understand the need for bp (trust me, i wanna p3 ghostface and ash) but i just find farming unenjoyable most of the time.
---
Same
---
I’ve only had one game with a killer who wanted to farm this blood hunt. He consistently let everyone he downed wiggle out. Confused me at first, but I caught on.
---
Dude do you not understand why Nurse has no weakness? What are the good stealth perks that Surviviors have? And what are the good anti stealth perks that killers have? Look at that dichotomy and then fucking tell me that stealth isn't a dogshit strategy. 
---
It's a load of shit. If stealth gets to be dogshit for the side of the power dynamic that should be more inclined to do it, then it should be able to be turned useless for the side that isn't supposed to have an overabundance on it without clear weakness.
---
~~and it just got buffed anyway lol~~
---
That's situational. I made a build with flip flop tenacity and unbreakable and it worked better. Killers dont except you to crawl off that fast and when they pick you up you get like 40% of wha6 you jad
---
Yep. If it's been a long, hard fought match, and I know I broke 30k, I'll let one go usually, but not via the hatch - I want them to *submit*.
---
If I want a 4k, I'll knock the 3rd after the first two are dead and bait the 4th in, denying any hatch opportunity.
---
Oh wow if that's true I'll definitely grab that instantly. Love God of War as is but Egyptian GoW... Yespls
---
I don’t know about the center of the screen, I had Ghostface in direct line of sight in the middle of the screen and still got the exposed status effect. :,| watched him activate night shroud and everything in front of me. 
---
The only time I’ve been able to knock him out is on hook or the time a GF decided to farm with the group.
---
Always a classic option. I suggest Agitation, iron grasp, NOED, and insidious 
---
Once I did this and in attempt to message his teammates he made a group chat with me included telling them not to go to the basement because of insidious. I followed up by saying “no I’m not” and somebody actually came down to check.
---
Alright slow down there slick thats a lotta big mumbo jumbo terms that i don't like
---
“Doing gens, you?”
---
*Cut to P3 Blendette Urban Immersion-ing in the only pile of grass on the map*
---
I started playing killer 2 weeks ago -_-
---
Lmfao!! Good job, guy. Smh
---
Some people really do amuse me.
---
Thanks.
---
:,,,| I have yet to win a single game against him and at this point it’s becoming rather unfun.
---
Spirit for sure.
---
I think you made him upset
---
So true. It made the grind to P3 just that much longer lol
---
Hmmmm, maybe a little bit.
---
And survivors are exploiting a bugged perk. Stop trying to be divisive. Everyone is shitty. Go sit down somewhere.
---
Ahhh yeah I guess infinite would be bad i
---
Cause the killer could hold him hostage. But at the same time the other survivors could finish the game and potentially save that hostage survivor.
---
Decisive strike
---
Id argue that Lightweight is good already, but that’s not a dramatic change so I like it
---
Already. Can’t say I’m surprised though. I knew someone would have it by now.
---
Welcome to the New Sorting club.
---
We had pamphlets printed, but it really just talked about the same subject over and over again with a few meme's in between, so we just stopped printing them out.
---
Thanks!
---
\&gt;   Killers already go in game with Iron and Agitation and we can’t do anything about it but Just wait for hook. 
---
Proven Rank 20
---
I'm having a blast both playing as him and versing him!
---
23rd post about it. Yes. There is a search option
---
No one gives a shit.
---
What platform?
---
Oh sorry...
---
Hmm, and yet you're here.
---
Makes you think.
---
Contact Dead By Daylight Support Team
---
I enjoy playing against him but yeah. I'm entirely bored of playing against the same killer every time.
---
100% true and accurate.
---
u/stevencri ^^ this guy needs basement bubba.
---
This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen. 
---
"Lol I get my kicks pissing people off purposefully" 
---
Like, really? That's your amusement? Pathetic lol.
---
Where?
---
Only advice I can really give is to take Spine Chill. I’ve been using it since before he came out so it’s not me trying to really counter him. Granted I’m immersed green rank trash so my advice isn’t very good most likely.
---
I love this cosmetic, but I'd rather have a mummy killer!
---
Actually, if you thought about it, my lack of shitty messages means I play the game in an honorable manner and no one feels compelled to talk shit to me every match.
---
Thinking's not your strong suit, sure, but that must make some kinda sense, yeah?
---
Ebony Morris are really annoying, especially when the killer camps and tunnels.
---
ah ok.
---
So basically a pre-made.
---
I guess it would be a bit easier as a pre-made
---
Especially due to it being in the Public Domain and BHVR doesn't have to pay anyone.
---
They could make it so the Flashlight reveals his ghost-face
---
&gt; Yep. If it's been a long, hard fought match, and I know I broke 30k, I'll let one go usually, but not via the hatch - I want them to submit.
---
You're fucking creepy and obviously get some sorta turn on having power over people. Seriously, you're *weird*
---
https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us
---
They only got the license for the mask not the character/costume. They are different
---
adding you now, you on?
---
This is why my favorite killers are the ones who get deviousness from just spamming their ability. Set hag traps, run around in Frenzy, set and pick up Trapper traps, much better use of those last two minutes when I have a bad game.
---
Idk about xbox or PC but on ps4 you can hold down the PS button and the quick menu starts up. Select the game you are playing and the. Currently playing with. Should be able to select all for message or party. I usually send a message and then a party invite to them to let them know while waiting in lobby
---
Ew, noed. Downvoted.
---
Says the guy who's name is "Dildo Swaggin". Pot, please meet kettle.
---
Swag away, my dildoie friend. Swag away.
---
Also, thanks for telling me I'm creepy in a horror genre game. That's the nicest thing anyone has said to me today! You're a swell guy, Swaggie Dildo.
---
I would have missed too. wp.
---
I'm amazed at how much detail was put into this, the Egyptian aesthetic is simply so good. Great work!
---
Lmao salty ass bitch mad cause I suggested a perk
---
&gt;Talk about one of the worst bugs Ive seen in recent times for this game.....group all using Wake Up, Prove Thy Self and all using Toolboxes. Had a group abise SWF and the Perk alongside Toolboxes and bully lower Ranked Killers.
---
If you consider just the match length, this isn't much different than a squad bringing 4 toolboxes equipped with Brand New Parts. Still hate to see it, BNPs were nerfed for a reason.
---
Yess! So good and cute !
---
I'm on vacation right now and can't play dead by daylight, what is that cake?
---
Literally every Bloodhunt tho
---
I'm on the opposite end, where I feel like the only one who likes the long flowing fabric pieces.
---
added you, you playing rn?
---
yea 15 sorry
---
Ghostface in-game looks more like a Grim Reaper knockoff than Ghostface, in my opinion. Plus, the floating, ripped pieces of cloth make him look supernatural when he's not. Andhe three stripes on the top of his head look weird as hell.
---
I thought ghostface wasn’t supposed to have the red stain. Or was there just an audio glitch with the terror radius
---
An event item that gives all the players a 103% boost to all bp categories and it's more common than bloody party streamers and costs less.
---
Very interesting. Too bad I won't be able to use it, as I won't be home for a month and a half.
---
literally rank 6
---
yea but they are really rare
---
for my 100+h playthrough i only got 7 ebony moris
---
I really hope so.
---
His stalk for each player builds up. It could be that he stalked you earlier, and was very close to exposing you, and you just didn't have enough time.
---
Well shit...
---
I think it’s due to licensing. DBD got the license of the mask and name but not the rights to the movie character. Hence being a guy in a trench coat and not the kinda messy robe style thing.
---
They got the license for the mask, not the character
---
I admit I've been giving hatch less these days, it's just too much fun closing it.
---
There are two licenses. The Scream Movie one and the mask one. They couldn’t get the movie one, so they took the mask and made their own character
---
They got the rights to the mask. The Person itself was not meant to be from a movie so they could have their own character.
---
Atleast thats how i understood it.
---
I leveled both nea and Claudette up to 40 today to get those damn useful perks
---
Cringe.
---
You didn’t lose much. It’s rare, but it happens
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
100% true story there.
---
No need to be rude. Just a simple question
---
I honestly think Jed Olsen (Danny Johnson) is cooler then Billy and Stu  because he isn't wearing some cloak and wearing a very spooky robe but anyways it's mainly because they only got the mask licensing and they wanted to create their own Ghostface
---
Aha. Hence the Scream TV shows mask, gotcha.
---
Ruin+Thrill of the hunt so you know if they’re doing a totem
---
What?
---
&gt;Yeah because it didnt take them weeks to fix the legion bug
---
It might've taken them a while to fix the bug but it didn't take long to make that a bannable action. 
---
After the announcement, I even enjoyed playing against people abusing the Blades knowing they would get banned.
---
You can see it if a certain number of gens are done
---
lol your first sentence proves you so t know how it works
---
I believe the formula is:
---
Generators remaining + Survivors remaining = 5 or lower, and the hatch will appear.
---
Why’s it okay for survivors to have adrenaline but killers not to have Noed ;) besides I’m working towards BBQ to replace it
---
He is saying that's probably why the TV version of scream didn't get the Ghostface mask.
---
Reminds me of the vault boy meme when he looks like this
---
"The Horsemen" YESSS add. now. devs
---
the meme clearly states this man is getting some food, he aint telekinetic
---
Pallet rescue requires a perfect timing or you get push back
---
number of finished gens must be higher than living survivors. If there is only one survivor, the hatch opens fully visible regardless of gen count..
---
Oh yeah lol, I actually really like the Brandon James mask/getup
---
Stupid idea....what if SWF you had to do more gens? Like maybe 3 more or all of them?
---
&gt;no likes u
---
legion is dark normal, fight me
---
That's mainly because the game didn't save what you did because I believe if you just close it at certain points it goes back to the closest save they have. So you might want to wait until you see a circle on the too or wait a period of time before closing the game.
---
This
---
I was on the PTB, most of the matches were against Ghostface (obviously) - until one guy decided to play as the Doctor to farm some bloodpoints. Instant DCs. Now that I think about it, I should probably have invited him to farm instead of trying to play normally.
---
Oh is it really? Thought it had a really big hit area. The more you know
---
Same here
---
who will use I'm all ears tho, except for the adapt
---
Can we earn gg cosmetics?
---
Mine sounds pretty bad that I think it's over heating
---
I could see the head being held by the left arm, and interactions like holding/hooking survivors being done by a spectral horse that partially appears from the void, a la stands from Stardust Crusaders. 
---
I believe someone has made a post on this sub before with perk/power ideas for a horseman already. Without looking for that post, I’m doing some brainstorming right now. I’ll make a comment on this soonish with whatever I come up with!
---
I wish there was a search bar
---
No.... you're breathtaking???
---
I don’t mind being a dick sometimes. I don’t want this question to reach “killer lobbies long” level (59 posts since ghost face’s release)
---
Dwight: HIGH FIVE...c'mon man don't leave me hanging.
---
Ghost: *That's the plan, dweeb*
---
 [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/39443](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/39443) 
---
This is all the validation I need.
---
No, like legit, he's *"breath taking".*
---
Being a killer main, I wouldn't even kill the survivor if they stopped to look at me like that lol. Imagine if Ghostface waved XD.
---
Blame the devs then, make noed a 1 time use only if you’ve sacrificed 2 people or something. Like I said working towards BBQ to replace it, atleast at rank 10 seems abit wasted on hag
---
So this shit was intentional? Wow, just wow.
---
I can't even play, you wouldn't think the absence of chase music would be so game breaking but it is. I can't fucking do anything, I don't know what's going on.
---
Because both my menu and chase music are basically a whisper now, even if I turn music volume to 100% and sound effects to 10%. Fuck this game and fuck these devs.
---
4 or lower
---
Do what with what?
---
Number of Gens Completed &gt; # of Survivors alive = visible hatch
---
Inquisition hotline I'd like to report Slaanesh-Nurgle worship.
---
Best one so far! Gives the Wraith competition
---
Pathetic to be honest. What's the point of PTB if they aren't going to fix known bugs?
---
Thank you! I played a few games against him. It’s a bit iffy but every now and then I get a reveal.
---
Yep, happened to.me earlier today. I was sure I got caught, and just got pushed back. And I was playing Doctor's huge ass and almost in the middle of the pallet.
---
To be honest, if I saw this in the killer's perspective, I'd just take the last survivor to the hatch.
---
Ghostface is the kind of killer I've always wanted since Micheal was introduced. 
---
There are few more things I could ask for other than a killer that can hide in lockers.
---
Save the best for Last, Sloppy,BBQ,Ruin. Working as a charm for some reason but it's a pretty good build for a M1 Killer base.
---
Usually you want to run 1 detection perk, 1 stall perk, and the other 2 can be to slow down the game further or have a small advantage in chases.
---
Fuck off with that furry shit
---
I normally don’t condone teabagging but that was 100% deserved
---
I figured it had to be something like that, thanks. So weird, I knew the backstory change had to be because they couldn't use the movie stuff, but I feel like the mask is the only interesting part about the movie's costume. Changing it almost feels unnecessary when it's so generic.
---
No, but you can pray for it.
---
Yeah, imma respect that.
---
Until you either hard camp people (I get it, killing is the objective and all, trust me, I mained killer up until this event but you can do that and still let people get down at least once) or pull out the tryhard insta Billy omega blink Nurse iri Huntress ninja Spirit setups. At which point I will probably be questioning if the ceiling can support my weight.
---
I've been getting a bunch of really good Ruin spawns + bad Ruin finders during this event apparently.
---
I had a few games where they never found it and had to push through to get a few gens done before I got the 4k.
---
To each their own!
---
Had a glitched hatch spawn on swamp so I just let the guy finish the gens lmao
---
I agree, not a fan of the ghostly looking floaty bits.
---
Omg, I'd be Walken all over that....
---
Yep! They're doing Nordic right now, they were talking about Egyptian next c:
---
#inamatchwithyourightnow
---
I don't think so. I mean there's 9 gens and only 5 need to be done, there's already a high chance it doesn't even get touched.
---
Meanwhile my ruins feel like a free real state agency for survivors. I will admit there are ruin spots that are like really hidden then there are ones that are ok it's kinda hidden but it can be found. Then there are these ruins....Out in the open.
---
Right now I'm running a very good meme build called Corner creeper Ghostface which involves Iron grasp, agitation, thrilling tremors and BBQ. Basically try to drag someone to shack Basement or basement in general then camp in the corner of the shack and wait until someone goes for the save then grab them off then hook them(very douchey I know but it's fun).     my actual serious build  has Thrilling tremors and BBQ for tracking survivors and stopping generator progression, Infectious fright for finding a new Target and Monitor and Abuse for a smaller terror radius to sneak up if I don't have my ability ready.
---
Good job, man! I highly recommend taking a gander at Ghostface, Pig and the Hag. Great perks, fun killers.
---
Oh fucking hell that needs to be changed ASAP.
---
I think his addons have something to do with it I'm getting really good rng on the ones that make you have to get closer to break my power. So you just kinda get free range on people who don't break line of sight like Myers
---
Billy &amp; Stu would gut this pretender like a fish.
---
Someone please make this, only its the Piper Perri blacked meme
---
Eh, that's what the visuals are for. Plus, no one runs that perk expecting the Doctor by chance.
---
And they should also make it stop working when it shouldn't. Survivors shouldn't be able to reveal you from behind cover or through corn. If I can't stalk you, you shouldn't be able to reveal me.
---
Scream was a solid show, season 2 was a bit lame but still
---
Monitor and Abuse, Ruin, Surveillance, bbq or Nurse's, you'll be stalking all day my friend ^_^
---
My favs are in Lery's, MacMillan up top, and The Game. They're always hard to find.
---
/u/ARedHarlequin /u/Sapperkid /u/VanillaTaco02
---
As far as I know there isn’t a link yet, they’ll probably post it on the forums tomorrow morning
---
Rly, so now do you aim at the face?
---
Hopefully people won’t do that
---
Leatherface could not be farther from mid tier. He's probably the worst killer in the game.
---
His power does basically nothing, and I hope he gets reworked or buffed somehow.
---
True true
---
Leatherface is definitely one of the weaker killers on the game. I'd put him in the bottom three personally.
---
I’m actually having a hard time getting those cakes. D: I keep getting firecrackers. Get outta here with that garbage!
---
I feel Jed would actually win considering he is more calculated and cunning then Stu and Billy plus can we just mention Jed probably killed a armed police man because his drop leg add-on says he stole it from a officer and he didn't let any victim get away. Just my thoughts though also nice reference
---
\*Guiltly raises hand\*
---
Now, I've played legit as Bubba and he can be okay, but definitely not mid tier. He takes work. But it's not impossible.
---
Basement Insidious Bubba's ruin it though.
---
There is a special place in hell for those who face camp and make the rest of us killers that patrol a bad name.
---
Doing a more in-depth evaluation, his Chili addons are rather worthless as they only increase the rate at which he REACHES his top speed, not the actual speed. The various scratch addons are powerful with the cost of saw charge up, the startup and cooldown addons are amazing. He has the ability to hit multiple survivors with his saw but the stun time when you hit a wall is awful when you stack it with the stupid hitboxes some of those walls have. All in all he’s decent, but he’s not top tier due to the lack of mobility or range that the top tier killers have (Huntress, Spirit, Nurse and Billy)
---
Ghostface is technically more camoflauged with his Prestiged cosmetics making him basically hard to spot kinda like Claudette. I think that's what you were asking but I'm unsure
---
And another xould be the tattered version he resurrected with
---
Did you not read the title? I said I let her go
---
The second killer surprised the hell outa me but made so much sense as well the first killer gave him/her self away too easy talking about their parents
---
Haha, nice.
---
Personally, I wouldn't waste a perk spot on a single killer, but use 4 that play to my strengths and weaknesses.
---
But hey, no shame in your game if that's how you roll.
---
Nice! I'm at prestige 2 level 50 but waiting to get another mill to prestige him again. Will have it done tonight tho.
---
Quite the "risk" considering he is then an M1 killer with no power for chases - pretty much a free win if its not a good map for stealth (Game/Lery's).
---
Dont worry, camping is extremely boring to me, and billy is too.
---
Gr8 b8 m8 I rate 8
---
Oh, I wanna know the answer as well, cause I've been confused by this too.
---
Only problem with the basement thing is now half the time for some reason all I can find is groups of survive with friends who can communicate.
---
Well that's a turn down for me for buying him *-*
---
If endgame has already triggered, mew cant do it. Otherwise it's a glitch
---
Damn these comments are real turn offs for buying him smh
---
I think it's pretty obvious that you didn't think about the existing perk before I mentioned it.  Also, being called petty because I pointed it out to you seems a bit backwards to me since it was the exactly the answer to your question.  "Shutting down suggestions" and name calling, instead having discussions that might have an actual impact on your original concern, seems to me to be the petty attitude.
---
Someone just played against a toxic squadette
---
Maybe will plac for "Bond" once I get it in my bloodweb, but I also like to not trigger the crows, and since I'm a Feng main, I use it to disable the moaning she does while hooked. It gets awkward when your parents think you are watching porn...
---
Imagine this guy playing any EA game
---
Lmao, yep. I bet it does.
---
But how can I not be camping if I exist on the same map as the survivors?
---
I geniunely wonder what this video was originally about.
---
I wonder if it was when those dumbasses were convinced they could charge their iphone in a microwave.
---
Doctors is common too although he is no where near as hard the switch from very rare to close Monday would happen
---
Same happened to me as I was completing my Plague daily
---
I don't understand the point of running STBFL on a killer who is based around one-shotting survivors. I'd rather have either a locational perk like Nurse's, Surveillance, or Whispers, or a chase perk like Enduring, Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength, or Bamboozle.
---
I play on PS4 and it seems to be working fine for me. I’ve been playing killer a lot and it’s hard for me to find lobbies sometimes but i think that’s partly because of added traffic of people wanting to play Ghost Face or just farm more blood points on killer thanks to double blood points.
---
Given his backstory he would probably the type of person to start to enjoy the madness. I always figured dwight was just one bad day from being completely unhinged.
---
For fuck sakes, it's only a nerf in the literal technical sense of the terms.
---
Here we go again;
---
1. Being able to stalk someone to increase the exposed timer (that they can't see) is stupid as it basically gives them an infinite exposed status, meaning that as long as you can see them they will never escape.
---
2. GF First iteration was too easy to break out of stealth, now it's too hard, i can literally sprint at survivors and they can't break me out faster than i can stalk them.
---
3. His addons are literally broken and op, two detection range decreasing addons make it so you can stand in the open and stalk and they have to walk towards you and stand 5ft away to break you out.
---
ResidentSleeper
---
Why would you run M&amp;A on a killer who can suppress his Terror Radius at will?
---
Exactly, hence I emphasised it should be far, far from obstructing your view.
---
&gt; We have a killer that blinks an infinate amount of times with no recovery period
---
&gt;other than her 2 second fatigue time
---
You need to stop talking.
---
“What do you got there” **12 ebony moris ** “a smoothie”
---
Just faster to sheath your hits so you can just keep on chasing. Since when you stalk you can just 1 shot the Obsession but sometimes your not going to stalk all the time and when he has 0 terror radius and no red stains it means a more mind game oriented where the other chase perks doesn't really make any difference for me to end chases. I don't know STBFL can vary between people.
---
How are you upvoted for this?
---
The only way for myers to use his tier 3 infinitely is through the use of an UR addon, GF can do it without any addons and can do it faster than myers.
---
I can’t get the characters to rotate (xbox)...
---
To add to this, he only shows up in people's dreams/nightmares, he isnt even a physical or metaphysical being, He's literally in your head.
---
Fire/Psychic maybe.
---
Had a moment yesterday where a ruin spawned literally on the outside side of the killer shack. No walls blocking it from view, wide open space. Disgusting. And I was a survivor
---
Then there was the adept Laurie game where I spawned on top of a rank 19 baby Ghostface’s ruin. And I had a flashlight. Broke the totem and ran him around for four of the five gens, several blinds... I felt AWFUL.
---
Learning to keep a cool head and not whine in end game chat will make you a better person
---
Killers already get a disconnect bonus. Survivors should get more tho cause they get affected worse by it.
---
Damn....
---
I'm going to guess he wiped to a basement Bubba.  Noone has seen IG or Agi in the wild more than once in the last year outside of that, probably not even in r20.
---
For fuck's sake.

Well I at least your honest but everyone's opinions vary so yea.

I have a self sustaining cake farm on my nurse. It seems like every other bloodweb I get one and I usually level up 2 or 3 times per game, so I can always bring a cake in and my supply will just keep growing
---
To the people who are getting excited and saying stuff like "abuse it before it's fixed." DON'T do that!! BHVR will ban any accounts caught using cheats or exploits. Bugs or buggy mechanics fall under abusing cheats according to BHVR guidelines. Do NOT abuse or use Wake Up as it may result in your account getting banned.
---
Leatherface is still fun, just inconsistant. Some of the most memorable moments in the game for me have been lawnmowering through multiple survivors with one chainsaw. I personally like playing him better than Billy. The biggest thing about him though are his perks, or more specifically, his perk. BBQ&amp;Chilli. Next to Ruin, this is probably the best perk in the game. Not only is a really decent perk on its own, it also doubles your BP gain at level 3, so it makes grinding significantly less tedious.
---
506%?  Those are rookie numbers.
---
Forgot to tag this as Shitpost. Ib4 &lt;deleted&gt;
---
I knew about Flip Flop, except it’s doesn’t speed up your wiggle bar, that’s why I didn’t mention it. You asked me to rephrase a question that’s pretty straight forward. I want a perk that speeds up wiggle.
---
Can you provide video evidence?
---
Not B8 you reddit f4gs you guys come up with any excuse to deny the inevitable This Game is Trash !!!!!!
---
Yeah you can
---
See that's the thing,I want to get him for his perk but so many people say he isnt a good killer
---
THIS BITCH EMPTY      YEEET.
---
Cuz he can’t be knocked out of his stealth
---
... what part of ASYMMETRICAL GAME do you not understand? And survivors aren’t op
---
Well shit, this explains how the last few matches got done so fast( and no I’m not that bad at the game ............ I think)
---
She doesnt. Survivor are just Skins for wach other.
---
Play With Your Food, Thrilling Tremors, BBQ &amp; Pop Goes the Weasel. I have not gotten Ruin yet but this perk combo is pretty damn good, especially with Night Shroud recovery speed or double crouch speed add-ons.
---
Well, it just overheated again so I couldn’t check. 
---
Rip to me :(
---
I haven’t seen that yet but that would be amazing, I wouldn’t even hook them, as soon as they come back I would just drop them and watch them run off into the mist.
---
There's nothing more that I want than this.
---
I think that's just flavour text or referring to sprint burst.
---
Every time I play a game and am supposed to rank up, I get this error which takes me to the main screen, and does not let me rank up. I've tried everything short of reinstalling. I have been queueing with a friend of higher rank (7), and even when i don't play with him I still get the same error.
---
Playing against him is so fun. Breaking him out of stealth feels so rewarding. I haven't played as him because I don't have the DLC yet, but I can't wait to!
---
I main spirit and after hours and hours of gameplay, I’ve found her to be one of the most fun and rewarding killers to learn. She really helped me push my ability to mindgame, track, and predict survivors while also letting me punish really toxic survivors who very rudely teabag. Plus, those cheeks
---
You obviously have your head so far up your pooper that you can’t speak reasonably
---
Breathing seems a lot more noticeable. When I was playing clown earlier I found a Claudette (fully healed) twice just because of her breathing while she was trying to hide
---
Fartnite bad
---
Ty
---
All gens have to be fixed AND The EGC has to not be started yet
---
oh that was it
---
its awalys been endgame by closing hatch
---
thx
---
Also worth mentioning, Legion’s mend addons slow down every action in the game, sort of like a built in Thanatophobia.
---
Do these new 103% offerings become locked and retired when this "event" is over?
---
I respect your opinion, but I feel like pretty much all the killers would be in "They'd kick his ass" tier.   
---
The only maybe is Legion, Wraith and Pig. But even then, Joey is prob just as strong as David, and Frank is a fucking psycho. I'd be surprised if David could take on Frank for more than a few minutes before he goes all Mad Grit.   
---
Pig? All I can say is oink. With the knife? Maybe. Without? David wins.   
---
Wraith? Never a fighter. Let him use his axe, however...   
---
But characters like Freddy? David wouldn't stand a chance in hell
---
No pawblem
---
I’m pretty sure your internet shat on itself and took a year and a half for this to upload.
---
The game shouldn’t be asymmetrical. The killer should be more powerful by default, otherwise why the hell are there 4 survivors and only 1 killer. It makes sense that if there Is only 1 killer, he should be more powerful than the survivors.
---
Except Michael who he said was worse than ghostface. Lol.
---
I mean don't baiters usually say it isn't bait to bait people?
---
But I like going against Ghostface.
---
Try Nurse!
---
"Shouldn't be asymmetrical" "The only killer should.."
---
I think you need to open a dictionary.
---
By the sound of it I'm assuming that he only plays survivor. Assuming you two know each other in real life you should get to red ranks and and next time you get the chance have him play killer on your game. Then let him decide which role is harder.
---
I honestly think it should just be a default thing for the nurse - but I've been told that's a controversial opinion
---
Doctor is the best by far to keep track on people. I always find them cause of the illusions and screams
---
Late to the party but I wanna swing.   
---
Ghostface (in DBD) is more calculated, but from what we have seen he has taken down entire families without much a fight. He may not by as big as others, but he clearly knows what he is doing.   
---
And, in the films alike, he is having playful fun with it. He would totally use something random to win, guaranteed.
---
Survivors aren't OP, it depends on the situations, killers, addons, offerings, etc. All of that falls in place to build a match. If you get a lobby with Survivors who clearly know what they're doing, then yeah, you can get shit on, but that's why it's important to learn how to put pressure on with each individual killer. 
---
Gen rush is also a huge problem in higher ranks, but that's why there's tons of talks on the forums about adding a secondary objective.
---
Also, yeah fuck hatchet hitboxes. 
---
PS: I still love the game despite it's flaws and will probably continue and put an additional 2k hrs into it. /shrug
---
Read his username
---
Look up a video where they show what Lightweight does and you will see it is garbage
---
Yep it's a bug they know about. They are going to address it in the next hotfix iirc.
---
Still p good
---
That's disgusting.
---
Yeah but still DBDs GhostFace only got those kills because of stealth
---
Just like how Survivors used to get a free extra health point for no other reason than just equipping a perk!
---
I try turning up the volume to hear them but when I turn it up everything else gets super loud and I can't stand it. So does that mean it might be my headset? I can hear everything else just fine but I can't hear a survivor till I'm basically up their ass.
---
It was? That’s good it was pretty annoying having ppl abuse that
---
You can look down and just follow scratch marks as well. Annoying but works when you are playing as legion or following someone that has a borrowed time proc on them.
---
I was not aware of this, rip
---
It used to be a major loss for killers but I think some people didnt get the memo.
---
fun
---
It’s changed awhile back now you aim right for the face
---
That could’ve been a perk maybe.
---
I have him.  He’s SO fun!
---
18th post about it since the last patch
---
I saw it. It’s still good
---
Euh, I hope they never go back. It was way too obnoxiously loud.
---
Thanks so that means it’s still happening
---
Ik that Ghostface is oriented to use his stalk to end chases faster but I usually enjoy just not always exposing them as much otherwise it's going to be not as fun for the survivors even if it means ending it faster.
---
Is that skull a sans reference?
---
R/whoosh
---
You...I like the cut of you jib.
---
Yeah, if these past few days have taught me anything, it's that I'm a saint compared to some of these killers.
---
Leave it to the dbd community to finally get a fast crouching killer for 1 day and already use it to be toxic as hell. 
---
Be the positivity you want to see, lead by example, revenge will get you nowhere.
---
I feel that regardless, the survivors and the killer standalone are default equal, but what really upsets the game and throws the balance is SWF. Regardless of any add on or skill, a seasoned killer can and will always be obliterated by a calculated SWF and that ruins the entire game experience. I guess I wouldn’t say the game is necessarily terrible either, it’s fun and I’ve sunk quite a bit of hours into it, I would rather say that the devs and community for the game could go rot in a sewer.
---
I'm sure it wasn't lag switching, probably just her connection. I didn't see her the rest of the match after that though, \[and thankfully so, because NOED show'd it's face. &gt;.&gt;\] so who knows. But it does show that hopefully the dedicated servers should stop a lot of this, since the killer still hosts the game at the moment, and everyone and their damn mama knows that shouldn't have hit lmao.
---
After you die in the perks list after you go though the points you earned. If you click their name it will take you to their profile
---
dude too true. They should rename DBD to Dead By Devs
---
I don't think he belongs in Mid-tier. I'd personally place him in the lower-tier, mainly because LF's biggest weakness is pallets, as you move up through the ranks, you'll find it increasingly harder to get any kills-- which don't get me wrong , it should be harder the higher you climb the food chain. BUT, as you being to interact with Survivors in high purple, and red ranks, you encounter people with thousands of hours put into DBD, and those people know every loop, vault, potential pallet spawn spots, and maps like the back of their hands. 
---
What I'm trying to say is, Survivors who are higher rank, and have countless hours on their DBD record, know how to loop, and with pallets being LF's biggest weakness, good luck keeping up in the "competitive DBD" game. That's the main reason I would place him in the lower tier. When I see a LF in game, I don't go "Oh fuck, here comes LF, FUCK FUCK FUK!". I actually always love facing off against a LF, because I know I will hardly ever lose a chase to him, and my friend group feels the same.
---
Just really a personal opinion though, you're allowed to place him where ever you think is fit.
---
That's Ash.
---
For the first time since the release this game has reached balanced state
---
I'm sick of standing in his face facing towards him 2 feet away and still not breaking him out of his ability.
---
Simply beautiful
---
A more balanced state*
---
MEGALOVANIA starts playing as the chase begins
---
That hasn't been my experience at all. He seems ridiculously strong at his base level, even before perks, I don't understand why people are giving him so much praise unless they're just hammering away game after game as him, he's really not fun to play against. His base movement speed is nuts and his exposed timer lasts a short lifetime.
---
Hmm, in my head the horse would sort of hold them with its mouth or something. But the animation would need to be compact enough to not change gameplay too much.
---
And yeah, the obsession changing that way could be bad with other obsession perks! Maybe a different way to change obsession, or no change built into the perk at all. Good points!
---
Been quite a few times where i get host unreachable. Takes too much time.
---
This is adorable and I need it
---
What’s really extra annoying is when they sit there and hit you.
---
If nurse was first made this year, she would likely have some 20 second recovery period, like Spirit, Legion, and Ghost Face, before she can use her power again.
---
You know damn well what I mean.
---
It's glitched so people are abusing it.
---
He's a better Myers too
---
I have never seen this add-on and my nurse is level 40+.
---
I teabag whenever the killer see me. Make the game more fun for us all.
---
I've had a lot of success with the two add-ons that increase blink range at the expense of blink accuracy. It really helped me get my Adept Nurse achievement.
---
i get it
---
Oh RIGHT!!
---
I mean you can flashlight Freddy who's literally not even there, so I don't think this would be so bad, lol
---
No one??? It's John Cena!!
---
Now THAT, should be a killer.
---
Same thing happened to me my first couple games. I wanted to hurry and get it while people were still spooked by him because I'm not an amazing killer but no luck so far
---
It's been three weeks since you made your totally justified response to my comment, and since I didn't want to seem like I was defending pedophilia I just left it alone, but somethings been bugging me ever since, so if you'll humor me a moment...
---
One of my closest friends is a little person. If it weren't for the fact that she dresses like the grown-ass woman she is, it would be super easy to mistake her for a child. Especially when she's walking down the sidewalk with her husband, who is often mistaken for her father from what I understand. So for all intents and purposes, even in her own words, it's like shes an adult in a child's body.
---
Does that make her husband a creep? I certainly don't think so. At least I didn't until I couldn't get this out of my head. I mean, at the end of the day its all semantics, right? I mean... right...?
---
Fucking hell man indeed. Sorry for making it weird, uh, -er than it already was.
---
I'm not sure about that. He also makes a loud whooshing noise when he gets close so gen grabs are hard to pull off.
---
It is like that because of a bug, I wouldn't recommend using it since it may or may not result in bans (like the infinite mending ban wave for example)
---
using it is an exploit and in a few days it will either be fixed or listed as a bannable exploit
---
Looks like the timing was slightly off. You have to hit them with the pallet when the killer is able to move.
---
I've been doing it for the past 13 hours
---
Thanks u/Tattoomyvagina , very cool!
---
The HUB bug happens to killers as well
---
What power would he have?
---
Spectral Ride?
---
Once Power bar is full, calls his horse and rides it forward increasing his movement speed.
---
the horse can go through windows and pallets, but doing so reduces the power meter.
---
If he hits a target the power meter reduces by a certain percent and he doesn't need to clean his weapon. However he is unable to dismount unless he hits a wall or runs out of power.
---
Basically just a character that mows down people and runs around but unable to hook until he finishes his rampage. Idunno. Sounds broken
---
He was moving did u see the entire video I pause it to show you?
---
You are incorrect, it's Calm Spirit that negates Doctors power.
---
Source: Me, I run Calm Spirt to counter Doctors during bloodpoint events.
---
They made it quieter so it isn’t earrape anymore but I liked it the old way. Cause I could 100% know when the killer is coming
---
And for your information, he did break me out of it from behind cover. He was hiding in the upper level of the institute and decided break me out of the ability. I knew this because it showed a big marker where he was and then I proceeded to chase him and hook him. He must've been new to the game because all the gens were done and I hadn't closed the trapdoor but he choose to hide instead of race me to either of the exits.
---
What about he can run through stuff but can't stop? But running through stuff takes away power meter.
---
Congrats dude I’m trying to do this will all killers and survivors and let me tell you, it’s a nightmare. Props to ya
---
It happened to me as killed but I could still use my basic attack
---
I am using my stealth to play as a generic killer that just jump scares killers. You don't have to do all this to just have fun for both sides that's the main point. Stalking is cool but doing it over and over again on survivors is going to make them sick of it. The main point of Ghostface is to bring back that thrill of what DBD was suppose to be, as a horror oriented theme where you scare the survivors and make a run for it not kill them so fast to ruin the experience.
---
Just by design, the game will never be balanced. The survivor’s skill controls the outcome, the killer’s decisions control the fun. Really no way out of it sadly
---
This is so stupidly silly I just had to giggle. And that double post though, attention must be needed.
---
Ez lery’s ofc
---
As a killer main who sucks butt when I play survivor I laughed out loud. Upvote Sir!
---
you need to watch tru3talent, he easily destroys 4 man swf all the time, sounds like you need to git gud
---
Looks way awesome! Id love to see the uneditted version of this too, i feel like it would look better without any changes to the original imo.
---
Honestly the game getting better but it does have a very long way to go before it ever compensates for the 3 or 4 man comm squad playing like a trained swat team. If you’re gonna have teamwork on that level then there’s no reason for extended loops, right?
---
The problem with balancing is 100% SWF, solo queueing as a survivor feels far more fair.  If you couldn’t just queue up with a group you were on discord with it’d be fine, but that wrench in the works is what keeps the game from ever hitting true balance. If we make killers strong enough to deal with coordinated teams solo queue players are screwed and if we balance in favor of solo queue killers are completely screwed. An argument could be made for the former and adding comms to the survivor team but then tons of survivor aura reading perks would need reworked and I doubt BHVR is gonna take the time to do that.
---
What the other person said. Just hold down the ps4 button when you queue into a lobby.
---
I count it as one because there is almost no counter to it
---
They let me refund plague
---
I don't have music in the lobby or in-game. Devs fucked up.
---
I do see what your saying, and it could easily lead to this. 
---
I’m not an Albert Einstein at developing game ideas, and was just hoping to think of a way to ease grinding new characters and saving up bloodpoints. When your at rank 10 and under and your trying to grind a character to be at level 50/prestige it can be truly awful sometimes with SWF’s with no useful perks. 
---
I also don’t have the mentality of buying the game as I got it when it was free on PS plus, so I do see your point there.
---
I like this theory cause it means at least one version of Trapper and Jane are somehow getting along
---
Woo! I'm in the process of trying to get a few survivors to thirty.. Not that good but ya give me hope that its doable. (Have a hard time during and knowing where to go.. tis a process)
---
wait, do hag and doc cost money?
---
To be fair, once you get it, it trivializes a lot of grinding for it in the first place.
---
Same! Even when getting exposed, it's like something right out of Death Note. The pulse before you realize what's about to happen.
---
Pretty much this.
---
The animation didnt end. Yes he moved but that wasn't him doing it. that happens when the killer is still in a pick up animation and you stun him.
---
I hate it because I cant enjoy it in the game... Why are you hurting me like this?!
---
Beans
---
Killer main here. I've basically quit playing because the queue times are hilariously long now. I have no idea why, but I shouldn't be waiting 10+ minutes after rank resets or during huge events like this.
---
I using it too right now, but it's not a perk that I will choose when I have choice.
---
"FUCKING RUN! DON'T STAY THERE, YOUR KITCHEN KNIFE WILL DO JACK SHIT AGAINST MY DEAR JASON!"
---
I hate it and I want it to burn in the deepest, darkest pits of Hades for all eternity. They’d best be giving us more cosmetics for free if they’re gonna add some pay to win crap like that
---
:o? What about you?
---
Teabagging isn't some bar that charges up as other players engage in vulgarity, with a full bar allowing retaliation in kind. It doesn't suddenly become a good or deserving thing because someone else did it.
---
1% in proximity to the hook? You camping bastard. GGez.

LEGION 
---
and now ghostface because he’s the new killer etc
---
If you're on pc yes but the game came out on console after those killers were released.
---
Was Ghostface delivering the special GO generator?
---
I really enjoy him and is probably my favorite killer atm but I've been hearing talk of a nerf coming so unless you just like ghostface as a character may be best to wait and see where he stands if he does actually get nerfed
---
Jesus christ what the fuck happened.
---
Crashes with Plague
---
Audio completely fucked, even the menu music is bugging out. Certain sounds are louder like injured survivors (Which I'm not complaining about) while others are way too quiet. Might be my hearing but it's like I have cotton jammed inside my ears when I'm playing. 
---
Wakeup and Legion blade broken
---
Scratch marks are faint again for some reason.
---
Play With Your Food gives you a stack back after downing the obsession.
---
He DOES have the best perk in the game for bloodpoint stacking though.
---
The very bottom part killed me😂😂😂
---
Daaaamn
---
flashlight saves didn't need any timing at the time. blinding the killer at any time when picking someone up was causing you to drop the guy the moment you picked him up.
---
yes
---
1) I’m still grinding for a single cosmetic with shards.....kill me
---
2)Like I said in the other response, I know this is far from perfect, but the idea is to make grinding addons and perks less awful for the player. 
---
Believe me I hate P2W crap, I’ve had multiple games I’ve like turn in to that and it’s made me quit them, especially when you try to not spend money that you’ve already put in to buying the game itself.
---
List of what killers have:
---
- "Hitboxes". I've seen this on both sides, and very typically I see it more on the surv side when I play surv side, when I should have gotten hit when I shouldn't have. It just comes down to connectivity issues, for me at least.
---
- "Unique abilities". Really?
---
- "Faster than survs". Well, yeah. Depending on their ability, they should be faster than survs, otherwise those killers would pretty much just get 2k's, unless lucky or bad survs.
---
- "Camping and tunneling". I agree that killers shouldn't do this, regardless of the reason, but what can BHVR really do about it? And its not really something they "have", just more something that they can do. Besides, any good surv would know to just do gens if thats the case.
---
- "Moris". Eh, honestly they're not that bad mainly because, in my experience, pretty much no killer runs them, and even then, if aurvs know there is a mori being ran most survs D/C as soon as the game starts.
---
- "Host of the match". I believe dedis will fix this, yes?
---
- Former "good" perks that were nerfed for a reason, like MoM, and DS.
---
- "Bugs". I ran into this maybe once or twice in the past little bit, not that much though.
---
"Necessary".
---
there is one. the rest has to genrush
---
What's the anime called?
---
NOED punishes people who don’t cleanse totems. Also it’s a 1 vs 4 man game. There’s gotta be stuff to even out the game like this and this is coming from a survivor main.
---
Back then when this game came out, the grind was even worst compared to now. If the older BP gain and Bloodweb was the same back then your going to hate it more.
---
Play surv, just wait or dont complain on reddit :)
---
slippery meat should apply to wiggling you know slippery is in the perk name
---
Still edgy nonsense to me, but good to hear it was all just talk for that one round.
---
Charlotte. Same people who made Angel Beats.
---
Noed punishes people who complete gens
---
The devs did a pretty good job. So far.
---
But yeah, I’m still unsure if the audio is a bug. I noticed there are some audio cues added to cleansing lit totems.
---
):
---
The killer was still in pickup animation so the stun didn't go off. It was too early. A second later and it would've worked.
---
Happens every time....
---
*Saw theme starts*
---
This waa your final test...
---
I think doctor, I love it quiet and that guy makes you scream and yell and everyone around you, makes me nervous/scared/stressed. I won't DC, but still I can't leave that trial too soon
---
haha damn son 35 of them
---
*cries tears of joy as killer*
---
We all love it. It is why she is most loved by the Oinkers_
---
I’m at 42 now lol
---
It was NEVER worth it. I just played this game enough to be able to prestige without 'struggling' to level the character up again
---
I think it's still pretty decent, especially as a solo survivor. The duration is long enough that even if you aren't being tunnelled it can get you out of a pickle.
---
Honestly not sure what else they can do sadly. I also don’t understand why perks are such a grind, especially from paid DLCs like the licensed killers and survivors. It’s just weird really, especially when you realize how much more fun the game is when you have a variety of perks at your disposal.
---
Ouch.
---
Having fun yet Mr.Krabs?
---
Welcome, don't play Dwight. Kill them all.

---
Yeah I would have let you go. Even during blood hunt.
---
Event ends July 2nd.
---
The answer is: Ignore em and just kill em
---
What I really was trying to say was killers aren’t weak every killer is good (Except Freddy) and with the Unique Abilities part I was trying to say every killer has an ability you can get used to like Nurse’s Blink or Spirit’s Phase Walk. There really is no swearing involved in it unless you’re going against good survs
---
You almost certainly won't get banned for running it right now, but there's a chance it will be bannable shortly following an announcement - they did the same thing for blade stacking Legion players not too long ago. I wouldn't recommend ruining people's games to prove the point either.
---
Yep they'll always be usable they'll just stop spawning after the event ends.
---
but- he's out?
---
Yeah, so far all of my Ghostface games have been 3 or 4ks except for one. In that game, despite having Ruin, 3 generators were completed in the first 2 to 2.5 minutes despite me applying pretty good pressure. They were swf, but even then I’d expect them to have been slowed down a little bit by Ruin, especially at the ranks they were at. Maybe they just hit every skill check perfectly, I don’t know.
---
There’s no arguing the best addons are the green battery and filament. The timing is the same and you get so much usage out of it.
---
Alright, thank you for your input at least. I just like to add ideas to improve the game, even if they aren’t so amazing. 
---
I’ve already grinded most of the characters I’ll be playing (Wraith, Myers, Doctor, Spirit, Pig), so this doesn’t affect me as much, but I know when I first started playing it was painful going up against SWF groups who had perks that could put a huge edge for them over me (while I had lame ducks like Level three monstrous shrine).
---
Wait is this good feels hours?
---
Doctor madness now has a "WHUMP" noise added to it which is kinda funny. (When the doctor face appears on your screen and jumpscares you) 
---
Susie now has Frank's voice when stunned as Legion. 
---
Like I said the audio balance is super fucked up. I'm a bit hard of hearing and it honestly sounds like I got cotton in my ears. IDK if a few nights of Billy with my volume up damaged my hearing more but it feels like since the patch came out, NOTHING sounds "right". Be it heartbeats, menu music, sound effects, even stuff like Myer's Tiering Up sounds quiet. Injured survivors sound way closer than they normally are, etc. 
---
Audio just feels incredibly fucked up. 
---
I'm shocked how everything got so messed up with this patch. I understand maybe stuff that was changed might suffer bugs, but how did Wake Up and Legion's Blade get screwed up? It wasn't even in the patch notes, like they didn't touch either of them and they spontaneously broke.
---
I played peekaboo while in a crouching with 2 survivors teabagging in the exit. I hope they laughed.
---
I rarely get facecamped, maybe it's because I'm too weak and easy to catch again anyway, makes me feel fortunate but also makes me feel like shit
---
Alright, thank you for your input at least. I just like to add ideas to improve the game, even if they aren’t so amazing.
---
I’m so mad that Wake Up! is bugged. It was part of my regular build, and now I can’t use it without taking advantage of an exploit.
---
I just want to open gates faster, damn it!
---
Too be honest these are the type of things that feel so satisfying to do if you're in a SWF group of purely saving your own homies from being camped and risking yourself. Then there is Bubba.........Might as well bail out.

---
Tfw Ive already prestiged a killer that came out two days ago and got him back up to lvl 50...
---
Sorry that i upset you so much, really i mean it, i browse and comment for fun and i dont really take anything said seriously, i hope i can provide closure as i know that to this day some unresolved arguements follow me for no reason and distract me from my life haha.  
---
We just have different views on it all in all, no problem at all.
---
Thank you♥️
---
So I have Ghostface at prestige 1 and most of the time I have to resort to M1ing everyone because somehow the Claudette 30 lightyears away spots me. If I get lucky I’ll be able to mark 1-4 times a match.
---
You sick Monster!!!
---
You can only refund it if you've played the base game for less than two hours. Why did you buy him in the first place?
---
Thank you!
---
I was killer when this happened and its kind of bs
---
I learned the hard way with Legion, I'm really getting triggered by the slow vault action, I want the old one back. I was addicted to Legion when they came out, and waited for a BP event to finally get perks back on them....Then I played Legion, experienced the nerfs and yeah....I leveled Wraith instead &lt;/3 I miss em though
---
Imagine a 4-man SWF all running Wake Up, Resilience, No Mither, and Prove Thyself with a Toolbox. Gen-Rush super duper fast.
---
Interesting fact. Gene Kelly was reslly sick &amp; had a tempereature of 104 shooting that scene.
---
Yeah, I love this anime too
---
Man, you’ve gotta report a bug like that. Lobbies aren’t supposed to be empty for long since they made it so people load in before it pops for the killer!
---
I think on this game, community wise, Survivors are the baddies lol
---
Yes please
---
It could just be a typo in the coding and they call similar lines in the code. Remember literally one extra letter in the Aliens: Colonial Marines code broke the entire AI. Coding is a very finicky business.

YES!
---
Man screw ghost face. Maybe I just suck with him, have played with him a bunch now and my killer rank has gone down from 9 to 14...not gonna lie I'm pissed off.
---
Meanwhile as a survivor only time I've ever lost against ghost face is when they camp... And after playing as him a bit I can't blame them...
---
Oh well waste of money guess I'll just keep playing as Mikey.
---
Haven't used that one yet, but yeah sounds useful ish
---
Oh dope, I've watched angle beats before and I really liked it so niw I gotta watch this one lol. Thanks man
---
I know it’s hard for them to make it a balanced game for everyone (a lot of people would argue it isn’t balanced as it is). 
---
As far as the perks, while I do agree it is good to have a wide variety of perks available to the player (to make the game more interesting), there are perks that do Inherently present a very big edge for either the survivor or killer (Ruin, BBQ and Chili, NOED, etc), and are desired more because of this.
---
For example, a perk that can be very helpful for Myers is BBQ and Chili. I still haven’t gotten it through 70ish bloodwebs, but you can bet that I’ve gotten some really useless perks like Monstrous Shrine!
---
If you get rotten fields GhostFace will loose no doubt...
---
I thought he was going to be fun and i didnt got the chance to test him on the ptb because i had to wait 30 mins. When i got to test him on live servers he wasnt what i expected and i really dont like playing him. I thought i just had some bad matches and kept trying, but he really isnt what i wanted. Steam wont refund me the dlc so i wanted to ask if there is any way to contact the devs so i can refund him.
---
Seems like a personal problem
---
I know it’s hard for them to make it a balanced game for everyone (a lot of people would argue it isn’t balanced as it is).
---
Idk but it was god feel hours for me
---
Too bad they giving him a nerf tho
---
No you can't.
---
Legion? Alright, tell me how you find Legion o-O This current Legion
---
I usually constantly switch killer when playing killer, but when Legion came out, it was just Legion, 24/7, but since the rework ....meh D: convince me, explain to me why you enjoy the current Legion
---
Thats what i thought
---
So tbagging as Ghostface is okay but tbagging as survivor is bm? Hm
---
Nice man! Could only imagine the grind ahah..

Whenever Kate gets hooked it makes me feel like it's the screaming mountain man's sequel.
---
Well, for starters. MONEH
---
The same thing happened to me! I was so spooped by it because it was waiting for me at the top of the basement stairs.
---
about the first point. you're just doing it wrong.
---
What's this from? Looks super familiar to me.
---
And the game starts with only 3 survivors
---
[Same energy](https://i.imgur.com/pCJ7HvM.png)
---
Or don’t have balls- cut em off
---
Thats part of the reason why end game collapse was introduced. Survivors more often than killers take the game hostage.
---
24th time this question has been asked since the event started
---
nah insta saw is where it's at
---
Hope you said gg ez
---
"The add-on is already in the game" I know? The creator of the post wants it to become basic power, making easier to play nurse. Learn to read
---
Read shit
---
Can't wait to see it in the shrine next week! ;D
---
ah vagineer
---
Cool idea but not balanced. It would make totems too weak especially hex totems.
---
Lmao of course you’re a “blood nurse,” and I do. What 4% lmao...

I love it. Counters tunneling and as a bonus it is a free escape in the end game.
---
Movie in question is Atlantis:The lost Empire.
---
I’m shocked you didn’t mention ruin but then I remembered its lifespan is shorter than me when I play against a decent killer
---
It's for Source Filmmaker, a software to make animations with the source engine \^\^
---
It's hopefully gonna be fixed in the upcoming hotfix.
---
The maps are randomized to an extent so its hard to load in with a plan. Making a plan on the fly is also a bitch cuz shit happens that you don't expect so good luck making a plan. Plans do work out sometimes just dont go expecting it to work all the time.
---
I wanted to do it with GH but idk why I didn't lmao
---
Conspiracy theory they purposefully made long waits so you could get to work on your Y3 Cosmetic contest entry during wait times
---
And lorewise, perhaps the survivors are being punished for their evil nature and the entity is feeding off of their pain.
---
am i the only one to think it's disgusting? 
---
well made but disgusting looking and shouldn't exist
---
Worst killer by far.
---
Nice bait.
---
Wow really? I was playing it pooped up I was about to hit it cause I thought it was a survivor 😂
---
But how else will you know you got hit by a pallet again and again and again?
---
Bind skillchecks to a side mouse button, helps out a lot
---
They split their playerbase into two groups, made them fight eachother and gave them bullshit mechanics to bully others with. what do you expect?
---
Maybe it could apply only to dull totems.
---
on top of that, all player, even when playing both sides, are more biased toward one side in every discussion
---
Just seems like he takes the game a bit too seriously.
---
I wouldn't mind that if there weren't game breaking addons, offerings and items. I would love to be able to get to perks faster and I don't think it would be that big of a deal, but allowing people to buy loads of keys, moris, instant heals, etc would just ruin the game.
---
5$ ain't much tho, even when you're living in other countries
---
Meanwhile I sit on my level 3 BBQ on Myers. The RNG in perks just makes them worse honestly. What’d work better is a slightly more expensive direct purchase of the unlocked perks you have. Addons as well. And when you purchase things you level up that killer slowly. But then again the bloodweb has some lore significance...
---
The one and only time I have ever messaged someone was to ask someone not to camp around hooks as Nurse, it not only prevent's them from playing the game but it also makes them look like a poor sport, They took it really well and we both went on with our days, I get that people DCing is not fun, but do you yourself want to push yourself through really un-enjoyable thing's in your down time ? I know I wouldn't. Good on you for recognizing your mistakes with the situation, improve yourself and move on. good luck !
---
Fun story of last night, I played Trapper and had a totem pop up in a tiny alcove that could be perfectly blocked by a trap.
---
I'd rather not give them points for wasting my time. I'll just go break pallets or check Reddit for 2 minutes.
---
Because everyone thinks they deserve to win. Survivors and Killers are both crybabies over a specific perk/add-on. Survivors want an instant escape but also getting as most points as possible. Killers want an instant 4K with as most as possible. But with perks like Adrenaline, Self-Care, NOED, Insidious, Decisive Strike, etc. It becomes a battle ground where if you use a specific perk to help you achieve your goal you're considered "Trash" or "Garbage" because you rely on "Crutch Perks" to get a win. This community is filled with Salt Mines. No matter what you do you'll get hated for it. Survivors complain when a certain perk gets changed because "Killers cry about it" take Mettle Of Man for example. It wasn't as bad of a reaction as Decisive Strike but it still got a reaction. But at the same time Killers get perks changed like NOED has been beaten and abused so many times, Enduring has been through so many changes back and forth, Tinkerer isn't even the same perk anymore and is hardly used. If Survivors fully ran the game, Killers wouldn't stand a chance and would be forced to do nothing. And the same thing is said about Killers if they had full control. Best option? Change your messaging ability to "Friends Only" (Depending on what you play on will determine how you do it) It'll reduced all the toxic comments you hear by 100% while in-game. Outside the game like in groups and posts, that's another story.
---
Pretty Good Job So Far
---
Who cares
---
I completely agree with this; I would much rather spend 15,000 BP for a desired perk then grind through 40-60 bloodwebs to get a perk for 3-5,000 BP. 
---
I personally have no interest to the lore, but I know others do, so I respect that aspect of it.
---
Also; Myers main, I see your a man of culture as well.
---
What happened to just playing to have fun?
---
Some add ons he uses require you to be pretty damn close to him to take him out of it. Perhaps you’re just too far away? I’ve been playing him and whenever I use those add ons I don’t seem to have any trouble marking survivors even when they’re looking at me from a normal distance.
---
I didn’t play a lot, recently: when you take him out of Night shroud, can he still put you into exposed?
---
You’ve missedat least two more:
---
- Wake Up perk bonus and Legion’s Filthy Blade penalty both are applying to all actions, not just their intended targets
---
- Plague crashes

---
lol yeah, seriously though. I used to be a nice killer trying to make it fun for everyone, but you'll always do wrong and be bad in the eyes of the toxic, so once I finally made that obvious realization, my mindset changed and I've been addicted to the game ever since.
---
It’s 1 v 4 in a game with voice comms. It just fosters bullying. It doesn’t help that the games meta is extremely sweaty.
---
I meant attitude wise though xD like lots of killers will just say gg or leave without a word. Most swearing I've seen came from Survivors
---
You do have a great point here; if everyone has purple flashlights with purple/red addons I would probably throw my PS4 out from hatred.
---
wake up bug is infinite mending 2.0
---
This has been a long problem. This game attracts toxic people. Popular streamers are nearly 100% toxic themselves. You play as a survivor and t-bag and everyone thinks it's funny. BM as a killer though, and suddenly you're Satan himself. It's toxic and it's one-sided.
---
Mute the chat and enjoy the chases. If you pip, you won. Don't give a fuck about the dummies on the other side or if they escape. Even playing as a survivor your teammates are usually little shits. These guys don't have two braincells connect together, let alone realize how their actions affect anyone else but them. 
---
Most importantly just have fun and learn. Playing the killer can be stressful. Playing a survivor can be done even when your watching a movie on another screen. Give a "gg" and move on.
---
If you get good enough to get to red ranks that shit does tend to stop. That said, survivors there are a fuck ton harder to deal with.
---
I already put the wake up perk but in the post lol
---
look at him, but you have to be VERY precise with your camera
---
As soon as Competitive Online Multiplayer was introduced, it died. Only way to have fun and not get mad at anyone but yourself anymore with games is to play offline
---
Hurr hurr, definitely not gonna waste the time with you on this. You really got me with the “you need DS” one, instant classic.
---
Same with BBQ, but apparently it's only visual, you still get 4 stacks. Or so they say.
---
It’s not unlike unbreakable now in that it’s situational but when the situation occurs it can be pretty useful. You’ll get more use out of it than unbreakable tho.
---
I guess everyone who Plays wake Up now will get Banned lmao. They did a mistake - they punish us. No Problem guys; enjoy the Next three months without Ballance changes and new content except cosmetics you can pay for so they can keep doing their pretty Good Job so far.
---
It was in the Shrine not too long ago. Probably won't be anytime soon.
---
Object of obsession
---
It's actually better to just look straight down as opposed to up.
---
KiLlERs CaN hIt OvEr WiNdOwS mAn
---
Seriously, I don't understand why this sub thinks it is okay that if you are actively leaving the window vault after landing, you should still be in hit range. Mid vault I am okay with, but if the vault has sailed seconds ago, I shouldn't be in range.
---
Didn’t know being toxic mad a game fun for everyone. I must be new here.
---
I'm not the Jane, but I feel so thankful that you played fair and didn't take advantage of that glitch.
---
Definitely take a rest, play another game or just go a day without playing anything at all. It’s really awful to get into the cycle.
---
I guess they wont fix it but ban all the players who are using it like last time with those "exploits"
---
Oh okay then. Are they making that instinct last longer? Also just a question, when you activate your power, your terror radius and red stain are gone when crouching and walking? Is there a speed decrease for being in the power? Just wondering.
---
No just you
---
Also every time I go to survivor from the beginning, I hear ash’s voice and He’s not even the survivor that I’m playing.
---
You can I'm just not sure how you do it
---
Yeah, it is really inconsistent. I think it is pretty dumb that I can be standing right in front of him and he can stalk me to exposed before I even have the chance to reveal him.
---
Take noed off. Just stalk them and make them exposed
---
Have you seen the age of the meme he’s posting. He’s slacking behind a bit
---
Honestly...its the mere fact we dont have a actual set of rules beside dont hack the game. Some many things are considered toxic or bad manners when its not actually wrong. The biggest fuels to this fire IMO is streamers and the devs. I blame some streamers not all, but good amount have players that listen to every word they say and say its law. I blame the devs for never actually settlimg debates and giving reasons for their decisions. There were points were the game was unplayable for both sides. It gets worse everyday we're in a DCing epidemic as of currently, the community honestly is a bad place. When you play just have fun and even if youre mad just say GG and go.
---
It really is the add-ons that reduce the distance needed to break night shroud, and they aren't even rare addons either.  So the chances of someone running them all the time is actually pretty high.  
---
Both of them stacked together and you have to be really close.  I know having an indicator for when you are breaking nightshroud would kinda defeat the buff they gave him where you have to look much more closely at him and can't just spin your camera but I dunno, if it at least gave you a little something to know hey you are breaking nightshroud then maybe it would fix this issue.
---
because this bug makes him much stronger. fixing it means he'll be weaker, so it's a nerf
---
Do we know if the feng and wraith cosmetics will be able to be bought with shards?
---
you, sadly, get used to it
---
What if they are a new play and they legitimately don’t know? Or never used the perk? Because I just got Quintin yesterday and I didn’t even realize it was messed up.
---
Putting some numbers on it to bring it into a sort of balanced state:
---
Bold (Rare *X* Perk): Totem cleansing speed increased by 3/6/9%
---
Any progress you make toward cleansing totems is preserved by 20/30/40% if the action is stopped or interrupted.
---
You dont. I think once all the hype of a new killer dies down ghostface will take the title of most unfun killer to play against.
---
Noed Nurse is gross though
---
If your complaining about seeing the new killer being spammed the same week he was released than just don't play the game for a week or so.
---
Smoltress :3
---
I mean,as long as they are not camping/tunneling you shouldn't care that much about what killer you go against.
---
And I've seen a lot of Doctors too, but I think that it's because he gives a shitload of bp's
---
Good job mate
---
I took a long break and when came back felt the same way I did before I stopped. Not saying it wont work for you but it didnt work for me
---
Lobbies are instant after new killers have been around for awhile. So after the first week, they will be instant again. Where as the first week it’s instant lobbies for survivors which only happens from new killers/events.
---
And let the old players destroy everything. Nice job mate
---
If it'll be bannable, they'll say so in a note when you open the main menu. It's only after then that you can be banned for it
---
Your radius and stain are gone while in your power, and your speed is the same as far as I’m aware. I haven’t bought him yet, only faced him in tons of games last night. My review is he’s very fun to play against and pretty powerful, though he lacks the mobility necessary to push him into the best.
---
Honestly dont play the game. You'll save yourself from genuine suicidal thoughts, from t-bagging survivors, to swf being ridiculously overpowered, any somewhat decent perk for killers being nerfed. A killer being destroyed mechanically wise because of a killer being "too overpowered". Since the KILLERS obcjective is to KILL and the survivors to SURVIVE the game will never be balanced. No matter the scenafio 4 brains vs 1 will always better and can be abusive towards killers. Apart from inside the game itself, you would be amazed that a bunch of autistic people in a group is somehow called developers. They bend over for people who bitch. Just take your disc and dig a 6 foot grave for it. If it's downloaded, throw your device in fire. Best solution tbh.
---
This is what happens when the Entity takes the wrong killer!
---
the fuq you can still dodge shit lol
---
Ah. Thought you meant it was provided by your work
---
Pro tip: if youre on console, change your skill check button to square/X. This is the best decision ive ever made in this game.
---
Oh god that poor wraith.
---
The fact that you even have to feel that way, shows that this has apparently been an issue for a while now. Devs must not care about the long term state of the game and its community.
---
Cant wait for that and Fire Emblem
---
There's a 10° angle in the centre of the screen in which you can spot him. It's just taking a while to get him in there, while GF can stalk within a much larger angle.
---
Oh that's pretty good. Thank you. I have him and hrs fun as hell.
---
How to called toxic and get facecamped into oblivion...
---
you wish she were that thick
---
Bullshit, as someone who broke out One Punch Freddy with STBFL, PWYF, M&amp;A, and Rancor for P3 Ash's with that medkit which I always suspect is an insta-heal I miss the post-game salt because they get Mori'd after one hit via the "No Mither of Killers"
---
There's 7 and 5 need to be done
---
Definitely Nurses calling for NOED. Nurses is so good when paired with Ghost Face’s sneak. You have zero terror radius as well as no stain. Also, you already are able to achieve one hit downs, NOED, while still strong, can be redundant.
---
Must be nice.  I stopped trying to run the event since every single survivor game is a mori... or pudding if I'm extremely lucky.

---
woah :o careful there
---
Thank you bro. Idk why some people can't admit things they know are true. People want to have the victim card ready so.
---
I think they will never nerf him to freddy level but currently, its near impossible to cancel his stalk if hes chasing you while doing so, which is a garanteed exposed
---
Honestly what would u have done in that situation
---
Poor guy tried to ensure his kill
---
I do not support camping but I do not support teabaging either
---
So your neck won't become like that villager's
---
You just gave me an idea. What if there was a killer who could DISGUISE themselves as a survivor?
---
Oh there’s nothing wrong with the angle, in chase it’s more difficult but I even have trouble breaking him out just normally. I always have him dead center in the middle, which works but like I said not as quickly as it should. I literally picture a small red dot in the middle of my screen and try to keep him in that area. It’ll make it clear I’m detecting him most times but still at best it takes like 3 or 4 seconds to reveal him. But I guess we shall see if it is just the detection area once they add in those little changes.
---
No map pressure. Some maps I feel like you'd be better off with windstorm wraith honestly.

Took me awhile to notice but honestly what the hell spooky

1. Have you not existed for the past 2 years.

---
Yea i hope they fix the stalk problem but dont over do it
---
No, but you have to use shards at least.

Make claudette the new Micheal Jackson.

---
That would require enough brain cells to start a coherent conversation, you're asking for too much.
---
It's not true I played ghost face only for a while day alot of people broke me out from behind a wall on the other side of the map
---
hm.. the patch notes only say that they introduced new maze tiles for the Yamaoka Estate theme but nothing about haddonfield.
---
I like them asethetically but I can't help but feel they've revealed my position
---
Survivors were hand held for the first 2 1/2 years of the game, they have maximum entitlement.
---
Dont listen to survivor shit. I once got told to kill myself because two idiots kept unhooking each other before i even turned around, causing a loop of just downing these two morons back to back until they were dead on hook.
---
Another time i was told off for facecamping because i stopped to take a drink of water after hooking someone. I must have stared them in the face for maybe three seconds lol
---
Just turn off endgame chat if theyre hurting your feeling. The only rules you should be following is -as killer- dont facecamp -as surv- dont teabag.
---
I'd spend gold on this if I could
---
We are the same person
---
Oink ^^
---
Indeed😂
---
This is amazing! It would make a lot of sense for Dwight to have done this, but to have been too nervous to go to a campaign with his new outfit so he threw it away.
---
Part of this I feel comes from the fact that all online matches are ranked, instead of a casual/competitive model that most games use. I chalk it up to the player base being too small, but yeah, not all of us have 3 or 4 friends for KYF.
---
Yeah that's what I thought as well, but it was completely different. Tbh a welcome change, felt like a new map which was exciting.
---
Also they added more ambient sounds to the map like crickets which is awesome
---
Fair enough, the stickied thread was replaced (or not stickied at all, I can't remember).
---
I'm more referring to the fact that so many people are jumping the gun and complaining about the Ghostface nerfs without even discussing what the nerfs actually are. People just read "OMG THEY'RE NERFING GF THEY DON'T EVEN LISTEN OMEGALUL" and then get the wrong idea.
---
I mean on rhe one hand I get it, BHVR have a history of nerfing things into the ground without a second thought, but c'mon...the nerfs aren't that bad on paper and they make sense.
---
I mean yeah they would rather delete the thread rather than answer.
---
Dont forget tall grass patches!
---
Nice! Keep it up!
---
Oh he probobaly will but he's not op, it's kinda like Freddy at first people didn't know how to play against him so he gets nerfed to the ground
---
If there's a T-wall and double pallets, anything is possible.
---
It's normal and pretty common in majority of  competitive  games and DBD is one of them depending on the person but, I try to have fun as much as possible even for survivors to play it generic but a lot of survivors like to idolize a lot of professional DBD streamers to kinda be like them and of course some if lead to some toxicity incidents within the community but in some ways it's going to be competitive either way.
---
I’ve had it happen to a survivor I was against once in a swf. Anytime someone DC’s on me when I’m Killer, I throw the rest of the game and let the remaining survivors leave. (As long as they weren’t super toxic, previously.) I pulled a message up to the remaining 3 and told them they could leave since their teammate seemingly rage quit, and they all actually showed me that he was still connected. Just kind of froze him up for a second and then kicked him out into End Game stats after a black screen with 3 dots. He could spectate the whole rest of the match, and had not actually quit. The hit was really laggy from my perspective too, so I had assumed they just quit because of the bullshit hit. But they hadn’t even hit the ground yet and were already kicked.
---
Yeah as others have said. Just play something else for a while or alongside DBD. I have been playing a few other games as well as dbd and it breaks the monotony of it.
---
He gets a red stain when you stare at him and break his stalk power
---
Yeah they do. They're only bugs. I thought they'd do something to speed or the terror radius. Also yeah I got you.
---
So uhh... was it just me that heard the moans of Meg and Dwight in rhythm.
---
Sorry didn’t know, I scrolled for a little bit and didn’t see anyone asking so I asked
---
I think killers don't teabag because we know how much of a asshole thing it is to do
---
Oh don't worry, I have been asserting my dominance on survivors by the power of "Tea bagging" on top of them to know that I own them when they escape the exit gate. So they know that they are mine forever.
---
Yea when I pay survivor I don't get as much Ghostface's that Teabag as much for fun kinda odd.
---
I mean it's fine to be competitive, it's a game, people can play it how they want. I just don't get people who act like everyone needs to be a top tier player/constantly criticize people for making the same mistakes they do.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Seriously. I just started playing this game again after playing for a bit a while ago, and I don't recall the wait for lobbies being anywhere near this long previously. 
---
What changed? Is it just the fact that a new killer is out so there are more people than usual trying to play killer?
---
Thanks :D
---
Yeah that’s definitely the one that comes with the chapter
---
Or just mori them on their 3rd hook, if you can see there is a hook nearby anyway.
---
Since when people started complaining about MYC wtf
---
Fair enough. You've got facts here. I know I have the power in the game but disconnecting is what mainly gets me especially after they acted good and tbagged. Also, I see more complaints on this sub about killers.
---
What does the wake up bud to
---
That’s phenomenal! Congratulations!
---
OOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAUUUUUOOOOAAAUUAAAAHHHHHAAAAHHHAAAAAHHHH

High ranks on Xbox u either see the same exact ppl everytime or u see no one at all
---
isnt it like 4 bucks?
---
I just played and went to go do the gen in myers house and i was like... wtf???
---
What’s the dream build?
---
Honestly if they leave especially during the double BP event fuck ‘em. They get absolutely nothing but wasted time for that match, and you get a bonus for making them quit on top of any points you already got from them. The only thing about DCs for me is it usually guilt trips me into farming if more than one person DCs or kills themselves on hook
---
I’m sorry but, how is that a problem?
---
Hands down the best skin concept I've seen so far. I hope this gets added because you did a pretty good job so far.

Whoever you are you managed to just nail the voice in my head.
---
How to do it is probably just a little unpredictable
---
These new survivor perks getting outta control
---
Well I can see that it did remove a skill gap it was something that was unintentional in the game.
---
This remove the punishment for making mistakes or being forced to go the specific direction due to The Killers knowledge
---
In the same way that Amanda's traps got enough that it got instead of a different one  like slowing down the timer because of the double timer and that was not their intended purpose.
---
does anyone have the raw format for me?
---
I played survivor and got 30k with 3 or 4 cakes but as killer I get at least 100k with 1 cake
---
A good nurse already knows the perfect range mate, literally the only people this would effect are new players learning nurse
---
Gives a 15% bonus to everything, doing gens,breaking totems,healing,sabo etc
---
True that. It ruins the survivors game cause they are at a major disadvantage and the killer cause you end up feeling bad but have to do it anyway.
---
yeah exactly
---
That’s like pre nerf brand new part but u need 4 players now
---
Its worse for killer because each killer plays differently, whereas you can just level your favorite survivor and get perks via shrine and be fine.
---
I think p1-p3 should give you instant rank 3 perks instead of having to level each perk over again, then the grind wont feel as bad.
---
With over 700 hours I can say I only have 1 killer with all perks unlocked and it takes me at least a week of grinding (while having a job mind you) to unlock all teachables when a new killer is released. I have other games I play but I want my strategy to be viable.
---
You never know when a patch is going to render your killer useless or your main perks not worth the slot. Survivors also suffer this one.
---
Overall though, I would say survivors are more addon intensive, so prestiging for better addons would be nice, if it actually worked.
---
When I try the ghost faces only tbags after they down me
---
This is all perspective, I would say 1000 hours is a lot of time to sink into a game that has only been around for 3 years.
---
I’m getting only 30k no for killers with the cakes after 4ks and I don’t know why

But what about when 200 year anniversary happens

Imagine having a blood hunt, but constantly.

I'd say discordance, ive been running it with GF and its good
---
I teabag those who loop me like a dog, and Claudettes/Ashes in general, but otherwise no.
---
I'm wondering if they will ban people for this like they did with the double blades legion exploit.
---
Thats an hotfix worth but yeah... nevermind lets nerf GF

Damn, that’s so trash. Can’t express your creative freedom

My favorite is when you’re chilling minding your own business and bam, that creepy head peeps on you
---
I'm thinking of BBQ/Ruin/Nurse Call/Sloppy, since walking up on people is so easy.
---
But have to try out these builds as well:
---
* M1 typical killer build: BBQ+Ruin+Enduring+Sprit Fury
---
* BBQ+Ruin or Overcharge+Pop goes the Weasel+Surveillance
---
* Just for the memes: Mad Grit/Iron Grasps/Agitation/Save the best for last
---
Thrilling Tremors kinda gives me a headache, cuz I can't kick gens sometimes... but it's telling me where survivors are, isn't bad either... gotta test it a lil bit more.
---
Oof! That’s far worse!
---
No, thanks, We don't need more nurses.
---
Whake the f up *slaps you in the face*
---
From my experience playing him and against him, defiantly run spine chill and just high tail it when it procs. I’m personally running spins chill, premonition and shit like kindred and dark sense to kinda keep a good idea as to where he is. Gen rushing also helps if you have a decent team (and/or SWF)
---
Lol ace holes
---
Yeah, poor dude got no points at all
---
May he bless us with blue gradients for games to come
---
I’ve only managed to knock him out of stealth on accident. I had a game where I honestly didn’t even know I was looking at him (because he was about 40 meters away chasing someone around a loop), and then suddenly BOOM, sound queue. It’s bizarre.
---
Oink !
---
Definitely was thrown a little early.  Messed up the timing.
---
Don’t let hate cause you to decide who you want to play. Legion wasn’t insanely strong before and with the nerfs is even worse, but anyone playing this game enough has nothing against legion. I know at least when I go against a legion I actually enjoy it because the loop mechanics and gameplay style against legion is quite different from other killers. Legion is super cool cosmetically as well and I think they’re one of the most original and fun killers in that regard. The only reason I don’t personally play legion more is because I find it hard to get great amounts of success using different builds. There are only a few perks/builds you can find lots of success on legion with. Other than that just remember, it’s a game and it’s about having fun and playing how you want to play :)
---
It's hard to express an emotion using *only* oink so I gotta allow myself the faces ^ ^
---
Im killer main and still I disagree with you. Those clothes can really help them in stealth gameplay and we shouldn't nerf their stealth ability to oblivion
---
Nothing can replace Mr. Bing Bong; he’s a treasure.
---
i kinda wanna know what the bug is (i wont abuse it, i dont play surv, and i dont play quentin, since i only have it for him) and because im a killer main, idk how badly it'll effect the game
---
Rule even in real life, everyone is different. No one is going to have the same ideals or perspectives as the last person you have met that does the same occupation. Even for Killer mains myself I try to enjoy it with the survivors but everyone perspectives on what the survivor/killer do changes everyone's attitude.  The killers job is to kill the survivors that's it. No other rules apply to them other than that. They can do whatever. For survivors you survive. If you get caught you got caught. If you get face camped, well you got caught. That's the majority of the things people need to know even though it sounds unfair it's a game.
---
"by myself" 🤔
---
Ghostface is a lot of fun, one of my favorite killers, hope you enjoy him too!
---
&gt;Also, I see more complaints on this sub about killers.
---
4x the players.
---
I wanted to start playing just because of legion so got the game and bought legion really fun but also don't be afraid to use other killer now and again so it doesn't get old
---
*happy screaming noises*
---
Is Monitor any good on her?

Livin the oink life -

It's a hard one, but worth it.

Yes he is broken and needs a nerf to where you can hear his heartbeat from 60 centimeters and out
---
was this on ps4? i encountered the same thing but all of them had level 1 ace in the hole
---
No xbox. That's funny tho. Did you do them as dirty as I did?
---
When you will become good in thonking - you will run, loop, or do whatever you do - you will do it authomatically. So you will actually will have time to remember pallets, jyms, or map in general.
---
If on pc
---
Stuff like NOED isn’t really op. I don’t hate going against it. But it isn’t really great to have a perk that killers can just lean on to let them get a second chance for letting all the gens get done. It’s the equivalent to the old DS in that way. It’s got counters, but it shouldn’t exist cause it’s bad for the health of the game. But I guess a perk being balanced means that it’s good according to the community? 🤷‍♂️

God I felt this comment and I don't have a fleshy neck stump

Oh hi there!

Ok

63rd post like this since ghostface's release

double bloodpoints + new killer = more people want to play killer = less survivors to play with
---
(I don’t think they did it on purpose)

Its a bug with one of legions addons that increases mending speed or smth likw this. It decreases every action you do. Same with wake up - 15% action speed fpr survivor on everything
---
So sick!
---
🤔
---
:,,,,,) philip and sally are so cute.
---
This is some advanced humor
---
I hate it when new killers come out,
---
Firstly, 100xs over I would recommend buying Bubba. BBQ is such a solid perk that not only helps with tracking but reduces so many hours of grind. Anyway,
---
Perks: (Anything I think would be very solid for you to use specifically on legion or just in general)
---
Monitor and Abuse
---
Ruin
---
Nurses Calling
---
Bloodhound
---
Thanatophobia 
---
Devour Hope (maybe?)
---
Sloppy Butcher
---
Agitation
---
For builds most people just run meta perk builds on legion, the traditional stuff, but you can come up with that on your own. However here is a bit of a synergy build that I think would work well that you also have access to 
---
Anti Heal: 
---
Survivors tends to get injured lots due to the nature of FF, so this is a build to gain benefit from that 
---
Nurses calling
---
Sloppy Butcher 
---
Bloodhound/BBQ
---
It's not just that, people play killer more when there is a 2x Bloodpoint event because they get more BP per match.
---
imagine your playing an fps game and you have a crosshair in the middle of your screen. thats where you have to look at ghostface.
---
CowsIAm lmao
---
no, they were all too cute so we all farmed.
---
I’m not hating necessarily I’ve just never been so bent over in one night lmao I had to vent on here to calm myself. Everyone is entitled to play their own way, no matter what you “main” hell even different games completely, people will do “toxic” or OP things to win. As long as it’s allowed, nothing wrong with it. I just needed to vent this one.
---
I def spend some time checking my surroundings and making escape plans while doing gens and stuff.. I also like to run the Houdini build, which relies on being able to break LOS and then use the gimmick
---
I posted a concept on this not to long ago :)
---
And best of luck to you with games! Thanks.
---
I wish I would have known lmao 😂 they didn't put any offerings so I really should have.
---
Everything survivors do is toxic nowadays
---
This would not make it meta, and has enough counterplay.
---
I think the only thing holding them back from making swf nerfs is that it would fuck over solo survivors. The best way to fix this is to add more emotes and an ingame chat for survivors. Then they can go all out with the nerfs as if solo survivors weren’t even a thing anymore.
---
been searchin for days .. thanks , very epic
---
OH NO SANS
---
Personally I don't know how it works exactly,but if it literally makes the nurse super easy to play then there is a problem.
---
You may find this interesting - https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/60j6se/hi_im_a_dead_by_daylight_player_and_psychologist/
---
Did someone complain?
---
No one has to follow anything besides officially enstablished rules. Being dont cheat, don't grief and don't exploit.
---
And yes there is a double standard in the community, a survivor can hug the Ironworks or Rancid main window until entity blocker but if a killer dares stay near the hook they're human trash. But that's never changing, so just ignore them.
---
You mean running around a pallet in circles over and over? 
---
If you would take two seconds to play killer, you'd realize how absolutely mind-numbingly stupid you sound right now.
---
I don't get it: these people ready to wait a 20 minutes queue to play a 5 minutes game with a fucking mori? Is it worth it? Survivors will find a new and better game instantly, but this guy will have to wait another 20 minutes.
---
gg ez noob camper.
---
I just played against him and he never hooked us, just kept downing us all till we bled out one by one....it was sad really
---
Nope
---
Feng? i mean the hair was most expensive thing, but that doesn't really say much compared to the reskins which i (think) i bought with shards.
---

---

---
I’m ashamed to say I’ve used 3 ebonies as ghostface this bloodhuny
---
He stuck in the pallet because he is trash
---
We are bound by fate.
---
Can you shut up, I was bored to play against a hillbilly and nurse every fucking game before he came out and now you complain about him ?
---
If you can tell hes proxy camping and tunneling dont go for the save make him waste his mori
---
Nope! For the most part it’s actually a terrible addon. Does nothing to help blink at all but rather the player, a player who already knows how to use blink properly gets 0 use out of it. I think the idea of it is to make it easier to learn nurse and get to the point where you can master blink
---
Get this man an upvote.
---
Unbreakable is very situational. Not many people slug like this, and when they slug the 2nd last person so the last doesn’t get hatch, that’s still like a 1 in 4 chance it’ll be you. And on top of that, the killer usually keeps a close tab on their location. There’s just not enough opportunities where it would be viable enough to justify running it in your main build.
---
how many BPs do you get with a full stack??
---
I'm a simple rank 14.
---
I see the killer
---
 I run
---
Good find, I recommend every player reads it.
---
You need to have him in the middle of your screen to break his stalk. It seems like the devs are going to do a quick update soon to balance that out though.
---
Unfortunately I won't be submitting anything, but I do have some designs saved up for the future :)
---
Doubt they will because this is a perk not a addon and I remember they did nothing with the tinker 2 bug that was being abused
---
Nurses calling, Whispers, Thrilling Tremors and Ruin is working quite well for me for now.
---
If that’s the case then it’s probably just glitching, I’m saying it’s intended way of working is probably line of sight with the body to prevent mechanics like you described.
---
Ok so first off he has standard movement speed but anyway 1. Spine chill is really nice to counter him, break him out of stealth if hes backpedalling, also a good thing to know is that if you have started breaking him out his movement speed is reduced  till you look away or break him out
---
They will give a warning before they ban for it
---
I just bought the game. Rank reset has people flaming me to hell and back hahaah
---
First of all thanks &lt;3
---
So I just spend all the bloodpoints I have right now and hope that they give me as many as possible?
---
Wow this would really suck :( Still better than nothing.
---
Fuck toxic survivor man
---
I play both, so simmer down buddy. I prefer playing survivor though, it is more relaxed and takes more skill. 
---
Running around a pallet in circles over and over is literally all the killer has to do. If this was a strategy to lose the killer then yes, it would be easy. This is a strategy for wasting time, but if you are a good killer it won't take you too long to catch them.
---
Out-manoeuvring refers to yano, actually losing the killer. Breaking the line of sight. Playing stealthy. Dodging hits, Juping, stunning, flashlighting. All of these things require more skill than almost every killer. The killer skill gap is 'just getting used to the abilities'. Everything is set up to make the killers lives easier because it is technically 4vs1. But if you actually look at the skill required for a survivor to evade a killer, it is way more. 
---
I mean when you down and hook a survivor, do you really feel accomplished? No, because it is fucking easy. The challenge for killers is maintaining map control, and that is less to do with skill gap and more to do with general strategy.
---
So yeah, stop bitching.
---
Oh no how dare they use flashlight addons
---
Mike &gt; ghost face (unpopular opinion) am I a bad person because I have a rep 30 mike
---
Did we read the same paragraph? Did you see the part where they would click their flashlight at me whenever I missed a hit or got pallet stunned?
---
Had a ghosty running bbq. He'd hook someone and then his face would pop up near in a matter of seconds. It feels like working a gen against bbq ghostface is impossibllllllle
---
You used a known exploit with your SWF and you call that "fun"?
---
Why are you like this?
---
Lmao how is it toxic to use addons on your flashlight and be good in chases?
---
Well that's because of the public indecency! /s
---
Distressing doesnt give bonus bp
---
Oh no!!! Not the flashlight clicks!! So toxic! How did you survive?
---
Read what I said to yesiamblackk, same comment
---
Super unlucky
---
only use it when the killer has no control over their camera. Vaulting, Kicking pallets, being stunned, picking someone up (this one needs a right timing to save someone, find a guide on that)
---
I did and replied. Also you didn't explain why it was toxic of them to be good in chases?
---
Why Alert?
---
It doesn't have to be direct complaining.
---
"A friend of mine", ofc. Its always "a friend".
---
;)
---
I never said they actually WERE good at the chases, I just left them alone the entire time whenever they wanted me to chase them; they were just trying to draw the aggro in typical "I just saw a Noob3 video" fashion.
---
Why? I guess all the tombstones, iri heads, camping and mori’s during double bp and the event took its toll. 
---
Survivor redemption.
---
The problem is that its not really only during the event. I have this problem for like 3 months or more
---
Ohh my bad
---
Summer betraying my balls once again
---
I'm actually in the ER due to the crippling wounds this left me with. It's been really tough recovering from it, but I'm getting there.
---
Call 911 :(((
---
Idk if it’s just a console thing but people who pick him ALWAYS without fail camp the hook!! They always wait by the hook to try to expose whoever wants to rescue, and if that doesn’t work they just tunnel whoever is fresh from the hook and try again.
---
It wouldn’t be so bad if I wasn’t stuck in rank 16 cause I always derank from the killer doing this shit, and then my teammates all just crouch around doing nothing while watching me slowly die. 
---
//vent over
---
I still don't see why that would be toxic? They we're trying to be the distraction. And like noob3 isn't exactly toxic? They're just playing the game. And as survivor you either should be doing the objective or distracting the killer so your team can do gens.
---
Well his speed was recently changed from 110% to 115% and if you haven't faced him in a while then it may feel off. As for the red bar I got no idea
---
Stuff youre complaining about are things meant to be in his kit 1. The noise while stealthed: in the patch notes they literally said this noise was an intentional thing but they reduced it to 8 meters away i do think it hurts ghostface and maybe they should make it so he cant hear it but still fully intentional. Also hooked and down survivors are still survivors so why wouldnt they be able to break you out of your power
---
I don't care about MUH SKILLCAP, it was a shitty exploit and you are all trash people for using it.
---
I haven't found one yet
---
They could ban over it? I've had it in my main build for months... guess I'll switch just in case.
---
It gives the Nurse 4 blinks at the cost of a slight decrease to max blink range.
---
Nice attitude to have to “still better than nothing” but something that is 3 years old it shouldn’t be happening there’s too many bugs in this game this issue happens to me lots luckily it’s only a level or 2 lost
---
Nah I like Noob3, but they wasted more time on trying to get my aggro than actually doing any of the objectives.
---
well If you have the perks unlocked for said killers then go with
---
Hex Ruin, Nurse Calling, Discordance (legion perk), 4th you can go whatever you like maybe NOED
---
for addons:  the ones that decreases the cooldown of feral frenzy (will reduce the stun so you can chase them faster after ferzal frenzy ends) 
---
PS: Discordance Is a very good perk might be worth getting legion just for that perk highlights a gen in yellow If It's being worked on by more than 1 person
---
Iri head and mori isn't exploit. You complain about OP addons and offering yet u seem like a kind of p3 claudette who uses balanced landing and Haddonfield offering. Exploiting bug is cheating.
---
Well then they're just being a bad player. Still not toxic though.
---
People who hate on Claudette always do so because immersed players tend to pick her. I feel like this is unfair to Claudette :(
---
Hopefully by making her cosmetics lighter immersed babies no longer pick her instantly
---
The increase on it is 50% right now, instead of 25%.  You can use the extra 25% to get to Ruin faster.
---
First of all, those perks don't extent the chase as much if the killer doesn't swing and whiffs because of it. There is an extent of counterplay. Secondly, those perks don't straight up deny hooks because your potentially looking at six bodyblock tanks by three people with MoM. And lastly, you don't get the core argument: MoM was actively punishing you for doing your objective. Imagine you'd get hooked for completing a generator. That's what MoM was if it had been a killer perk.
---
To position myself whenever I see him so I know which way he could possibly come out to tilt my camera. It even helps with looping if you vault and you're lucky enough for him to break shit since he tries to be all funny with no stain and that ear perk thingy.
---
But I'm only rank 14 so that's it too, lol.
---
Ussylis made a tutorial including everything you need to know about them. You can check it out here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pshlJLOeX7k  . He also has many more tutorials that I recommend watching if you are a somewhat new player
---
How dare you.
---
 I main Ace.
---
It makes it much faster for the scratch marks to become faint/almost invisible on some terrain.
---
I had a match like this where me and 3 other people brought one in....then the match didn't load and i had to force close the game and i lost my last offering anyway
---
hell yes, i love sleepy hollow and all that stuff but the original legends are the coolest for me
---
He's kinda like tombstone Myers.....he's bullshit and OP, but my god is he so fun to play against!
---
I remember a very long time ago suggesting a clown with laughing gas, a time keeper that could slow down an area and one that could disguise as a survivor.
---
Still waiting to see how many of my wishes come true.
---
It was very unlikely at the time but my top requested licensed killers were freddy, leprechaun and chucky.

---
I’m glad at least someone is having fun with him!
---
No, with cells! I think on Xbox you can buy all of the survivors with either shards or cells, apart from Ash
---
Stake out users be like:
---
I've mori'd you on Myers once, was one of the funniest mori's ever
---
You're mistaken, that is a Claudette. She was last seen in a bush. This is an imposter
---
What mm thickness of foam did you use, if you remember? I'm making a mask similar to these, and want to know what thickness would be best. Thank you in advance!
---
That's what I would do. Like the person above said it's unlikely you'll get back what you need so, you should maximise it as best you can.
---
Sorry about all that progress you lost also.
---
Fuck em. Just do what makes you win the game.
---
Yata
---
At least flip flop is kinda fun with a crawl build.
---
I definitely any vision is good, I just wasn't sure of the reasoning. I like the sound of it in this context though. Breakdown could be nice too.
---
Co op action!
---
I had a fear of him as a kid and apparently it hasn't gone away. I'm always far across the map if I know where he is and first out the gate. :(
---
Hoping I get over it.
---
I am aware you can buy separately with in game currency. But I said I use those for cosmetics and the only other option is buying the DLC which I'm gonna pass on.
---
You can't play "wrong". Just do whatever is fun and works for you. If you get hate comments it's just because they're salty.
---
Of course that one always gets out. Lol
---
They are just salty... i play more or less the same way and am still constantly accused by them for camping tunneling and so on
---
Just ignore them
---
I had a fun game against one last night. Looped him well enough on bedham at the exit phase to earn myself a camping, which I was proud of in a way cause I suck at looping. As a last ditch effort to make him even more salty as my struggle meter was about to go out I exposed him trying to mark a teammate trying in vain to save me and mr crab legs skewered me. My surviving teammates survived and I was satisfied
---
I got adept ghostface my second game trying for it
---
The only notable buff we got was Dwight's gen rushing perk, everything else hasn't been meta relevant at all. Not every perk needs to be OP, but I want every perk to feel like it has an actual impact, even if it's something gimmicky.
---
Cool pic but if the Claudette sandbagged her team that’s pretty messed up you didn’t kill her instead.
---
You’ll love the opening song !
---
lol survivor gang rolled up on this post
---
Love being moried by Myers he's moried he most out of all the killers 😂 you'll know it's me because I always use the "thank you daddy" line at the end. Sometimes I get replies that are the best like "you're welcome my child" it's awesome 😂
---
How the hell is he bullshit and op.
---
Anyone if you have bloodhound and sloppy butcher
---
Situational as tho
---
Ahh the leather sounds are the best
---
But who even reads that? I know I don’t ever read the in game news unless there’s a new event like lunar new year.
---
The gates were powered and he was right next to the gate. What should he be doing instead of camping lmao
---
I get that. All of those things suck, especially when they seem to add up, but at least they're technically fair. You can always play killer and balance out the experience. Abusing exploits that break the intent of the game, is really out of balance, imo.
---
As another dude said in another comment. Flashlights could sear the flesh on his neck like Wraith.
---
Myers can instantly kill you without hooking once, so that's OP obviously. Ghostface has the ability to 1 hit, but it's very buggy right now because you can't always stop him from stalking by just looking at him. I'm not saying he's ad bad as tombstone Myers, but while he is OP, it is genuinely suspenseful to go up against him, which is fun. That is why I compared the two killers.
---
What’s the difference between using it and exploiting it? Wouldn’t using it be exploiting it?
---
how to counter noed:
---
1. cleanse all dull totems
---
2. ...
---
3. Profit!
---
Nah. Nurse has essentially no counter, it all depends on her skill. Players should have to deal with the frustrations of playing nurse and must learn by their own experience to get good at her because once they do, the reward will be great.
---
You make us ace mains look like scumbags.
---
And when you cannot see them, they are clicky clicky spamming like if they were the best players in the world
---
if you stay near the hooked person, you apply no pressure to the rest, letting them just fix the remaining gens and escape. leaving the hook will get the person unhooked but will apply pressure and once you practice, you'll be able to get more than one kill with your own skill, not them being stupid and bombing the hook
---
&gt; I prefer playing survivor though, it is more relaxed and takes more skill.
---
You are absolutely delusional. You have zero idea how to play killer, I guarantee you're trash at the game entirely. Anyone who says as much dumb crap as you do obviously has no clue about the game. 
---
Survivor takes almost zero skill compared to killer. _This is coming from someone who won the $5,000 official DBD tournament. I'm telling you you're dumb as shit. I don't care if you believe me or not. You are absolutely clueless and delusional in every single way it's hilarious.
---
If you enjoy playing as you do then carry on. Like the others said, “they’re salty” and it’s just a game :)
---
Leather face is low tier as hes literally a no brain killer you dont have to aim and dont have to think just hold down the chainsaw button and hope in your wild swinging you hit someone and as you go up in the ranks survivors know how to counter that
---
Yeah, fuck Claudette
---
*hosta age?
---
More like -hostage Ace
---
When removing an exploit that I didn’t even know about until recently fucks with fast vaulting for every window in the game, that’s when it’s an issue.
---
The horse walk next to gens on the map and you can see tru his eyes
---
someone picking it once or not realizing what's happening and playing normally
---
vs
---
someone taking it with the best toolbox, prove thyself and using it to genrush the fuck out of the game
---
To be fair, you can't always outplay the killer. Sometimes you actually have to wait for them to break the pallet to get to another area.
---
yeah, and then expect to get tunneled and face camped for it
---
Again, NOED isn’t op by any means. It’s worse for the killer than it is for the survivors cause the killer will never learn and get better at protecting gens if they just think “well I have noed it’s ok if they get the gens”. It rewards bad gameplay in the same way old DS did.
---
Killer main here, Let’s see their POV, the survivor you choose has just no chance to do anything in the game, and it isn’t very fun for them. It probably is more efficient until rank 7-8 to go looking for another survivor (BBQ helps a lot for that) once you hooked someone, because you keep more survivors off the gens (one you chose, one on the hook, and one rescuer. However, after rank 6-7 and with a low tier killer such as wraith, it will be hard to win without tunneling, so it becomes more acceptable imo.
---
You're entitled to your opinion. If you can do better, do it yourself
---
Golden rule is: you have to play without addons and get wrecked as her at least 10 times to get familiar with blinks at least a bit. After that it will come easier with each time
---
Anyone having an issue with the dead hard button not being available?
---
Question: if ghostface exposes me will I then get canceled after?
---
The traps are not active in the endgame.
---
I'm giving him tips on how to actually get the killer blinded with it, as any other way isn't viable vs killer that knows anything. I'm not responsible for what happens next
---
Man you clearly have no clue what op means. Firstly, myers has to stalk a shit ton to get his tombstone working. You can complete all the gens before he gets into tier 3 and escape if you are not feeding him and even if he gets kills he will still lose a pip. Secondly, the only thing op in this game is omega blink nurse and maybe insta chainsaw billy. Ghost face is mid tier, next to myers. Good survivors can keep him easily out of Night Shroud, making him an m1 killer with no powers. This is not a stealth meta. The only thing that works right now are the recovery addons. You go into the survivors' faces and stalk them up to 80% then you wait 10 seconds to go back into night shroud and expose them right behind them. If you think hes op then you clearly havent versed him enough or you dont know how to play  against him.
---
Me every time
---
I have no tuning guides or bulbs left.. I'm a poor Bubba
---
i use noed as backup perk nearly 75% of my games dont feature noed when im playing with bad survivors
---
and when i get good ones it really dosent change anything for them
---
i only got 3 games when noed turned the tide for me that from no kills i got 4k
---
Its a bug, when he uses his blade addons that slow mend time it incorrectly slows all actions you take in game including vaulting, repairing gens, healing ,cleansing totms, etc...
---
You: unhook survivor in the endgame
---
Also you: get hooked instead
---
Unhooked survivor: leaves through the exit gates immediately
---
Shut up, other killer mains don't know that. They just see the purple rarity and think "oh ye that's OP" or in Bubba's case "Bubba is L I T T E R L Y da wurst killr in da gaym". I've burned through all of my good charge addons and I am only left with grease and the brown one, they both only slightly decrease charge time.
---
Yes, you ARE proxy camping &amp; tunnelling. However nothing is inherently wrong with doing that. Yes, that one survivor that you tunnel will have less time playing game. I will say that going after one survivor till they're dead isn't the best way to play. If you go after anyone you can find and spread out damage survivors will not work on gens as much. By only focusing on one survivor will let the other 3 go unhindered, getting the game done MUCH faster. Getting one kill is good, but you shouldn't make this your default play-style as it WILL hurt you in the long run. To clarify, you're not playing "wrong", if this is how you enjoy playing the game, nothing is wrong, if its how you want to play, nothing is wrong. Survivors just don't like getting tunnelled as it DOES hurt their game.
---
I'd trade all of my addons on Bubba for a handful of charge addons if I could.
---
And both games I played as killer throughout this whole event didn't even earn many bp bc nobody apparently uses the gateau offering. As survivor I at least get 2 bc the killer nearly always burns a gateau
---
If it doesn’t usually come into play, why not run a perk you know you’ll use? What is your usual build?
---
I specifically bound skill check to another button on my mouse so I could eat crackers
---
I had this happen to a Nea last night lol
---
Proxy camping is camping the hook by staying so close to the hook and patroling it that no survivors can do anything beneficial about it and tunneling is targeting one survivor till theyre dead. Trust me as a killer main it is better for you to have hooked everyone twice and have them escape than it is to hook 1 person 3 times or until they die
---
I'd bet money that you complain about getting face camped after it too.
---
I love that tiny Mikey at 0:13 :)
---
Didnt know about that mask. My first encounter with him in game was with that mask. Dropped down right on me and scared the shot out of me lol
---
Bless you, you little cretin, all you can do is be rude and make assumptions based on nothing. It is a shame a 'team leader' is such an immature child, your team must really respect you. 
---
It is you who is delusional. You have no leg to stand on. You know what i'm saying is true, that it is map control and not skill gaps. I couldn't care less how many 'prizes' you use to justify your opinion, which is backed up by nothing more than "YoU aRE TrasSH". The bottom line is you are trying to defend your 'killer main' ego and using anything to justify it. But you haven't actually made any solid points apart from trying to detract my point to 'skill checks' and 'pallet looping'.  It is not a case of believing. You haven't provided anything to believe. So I suggest you grow the fuck up and learn to have a discussion or refrain from commenting.
---
You've shown your true colours into what type of person you are. I suggest you work on your shitty personality before streaming. It may come back to bite you.
---
Oh you clearly didnt go against 4 p3 clauds
---
Game literally is almost always lost for them as they play the really bad way (immersed is one of the worst gamestyle) but they also made the match last twice as much almost and its annoying
---
Dude could summon his head and float it around to see in 3rd person for a short time.
---
I literally just spent 4 hours playing with my friend against 80% ghostfaces. If you don't understand how absurd it is for him to be able stalk you for 3 to 4 seconds while you're looking directly at him, then clearly YOU have no clue what OP means.
---
Also, any further debate about this ended the moment you even attempted to suggest that Tombstone is fair and/or balanced. Not even gonna attempt to explain why it is.
---
"wtf, this should be brown"
---
\-the first thing I said when I saw this addon
---
I know on Billy his heartbeat and chase music keeps going on and off.. like i'm looping him, I go around a wall.. heatbeat and music stops, as soon as I can see him again game says "here, let me turn that up to 11 for ya"
---
also, I've cleansed totems or seen totems cleansed and never got the sound notifications.
---
There is no conduct play like you want to!
---
Ha, pretty much my own list tbh.
---
my usual build is:
---
Nurse's (duh)
---
BBQ
---
Thatanophobia (gonna change it to ruin when i unlock it)
---
NOED
---
oof ps4 or xbone? 
---
I've thankfully only ran into a handful of GFs on xbone who were camping pretty hard, most actually left the entire area thankfully after hooking a survivor.
---
Been there man, it hurts.
---
Unbreakable was already strong and used widely, WoO is still bad, guess it's good for new players.
---
How? Ô.o
---
can people actually abuse this?
---
Given BHVR his power will be M1 killer.
---
I killed him...he disrespected Piggy.
---
My favorite is having a bunch of anti sneak perks and you go against a pro tier doc
---
True...true...
---
top 3 are free from start top 4 can be earned with game time and top 5 also free.
---
Fruit Dwight pants
---
Yeah I may now leave hooks further alone and focus more on gens
---
Visual bug, dont worry :D
---
Why do you think buffing useless survivor perks prohibits the devs to buff useless killer perks?
---
How dare they use a item
---
this happened to me today. my game was barely starting up and i hear Ash say “groovy”. I hope the devs fix all these issues
---
Literally was playing squadette and then it was me and someone else left. I got hooked and died on purpose so she could find the hatch and I still got flamed! "At least the Claudette who deserved to escape got the hatch" survivors will complain/flame anything. Sorry I did 2 and a half gens, guess I was supposed to die earlier than them
---
don’t forget the bug where you can barely hear the music. it’s especially difficult to hear when myers tiers up
---
You like playing Legion? Well, seeing all those dcs must be fun, not gonna lie
---
Yeah, I see how it could be frustrating, I'm still only rank 16 and plan to move to the scream or the pig once I get to higher(or lower?) Ranks. I just like stealth killers the best
---
I feel your pain man, took me fuckin forever to do that adept and I still need to do the plague's. It's shitty that all Survivors need to do is escape for their trophies and killers need to be amazing to get their trophies.
---
Maybe you could try something that helps out more in the chase like enduring or bamboozle. That new Thrilling Tremors perk is very good as well cause it has so many uses! And it also sounds like you get through stuff pretty fast so you could also try corrupt intervention to keep them even further away from stuff. Usually, NOED is pretty risky if there’s multiple survivors left cause the End Game doesn’t force them in the same way that something that slows the game down does.
---
It's your camera you just have to physically be in line of sight as well.
---
People enjoy Legion?
---
Did the devs mention tweaking him?
---
I'm assuming your trying to use the exact same strategy playing Myer's while playing Ghosty?
---
If all the gens are done, you can open the gate though you don't really want to do that unless you just want to force the survivors out. 
---
If you kill 3 of them, then the hatch spawns, if they find it they can escape if you find it, you can close it but then the doors are powered but you can't open them. Survivors have to, you basically have to hope RNG put them close so their easy to patrol. 
---
Check out https://www.twitch.tv/fungoose he mostly plays killer, but does play a bit of survivor when lobbies are slow. He comes at it from an Educational point of view, does call outs, why he made a certian play or run perks etc.. has a lot of VODs.
---
dear lord take a shot for each insult and you likely wouldent live..
---
I don't be around for that shit.
---
So has anyone figured out how to counter him and inform me? I assume object doesnt work anymore?
---
You play killer wrong when you let people go who you could have killed if you really wanted to. You're a KILLer. The clue is in the name. You're supposed to be the bad guy, to ruin their day lol. So whenever they get angry, roleplay as the bad guy and go 'mwhuhaha' or something.
---
what's funny is i see a lotta people make these nice designs for the killers either thematically or just for cool cosmetics, this one is nice as it's simple.   
---
and here i can't unsee him being a Milk Man with the curly mustache and rancid milk at his side.
---
Technically survivors are getting teabagged now.
---
How ironic
---
i should point out that im playing nurse so enduring is not helpful by the way what is pallet? xd
---
same with bamboozle can just teleport trough
---
and i dont have ghostface dlc
---
i could wait for it to appear in shrine of secrets but it would take a while
---
im gonna take a few screen shots of my perks as nurse just wait a while
---
You want to talk about something that’s not fair to play against? Let’s start with Prayer Beads. 
---
He’s fine, leave him alone.
---
You do that all by yourself sir.
---
I have only gotten one farming lobby as survivor and one as killer
---
You are the only one thinking that tombstone is op. Ghostface might be bugged atm thats why you cant get him out of night shroud but even so, hes around mid tier. Hes not even close to nurse billy, spirit and huntress. I already told you what is op in this game and thats preety much it. Oh yes and iri shards are op too. Also look at my tag man, im a killer main since the release of the game. I have all killers to p3 lv50 and i know whats unbalanced and whats not and ghost face is not one of those things. Good at rank 8+, starts to lack in power under rank 8. I agree that tombstone is broken too, myers should also get a pip if he gets to kill survivors :)
---
PS4, I’m glad your experience is better than mine but on average I get 7k bp per game
---
Well the dev’s don’t think he’s fine, since they’re hotfix nerfing him
---
Events with increased bloodpoints or items that increase bloodpoints tend to come with long queues. This is because more people are playing killer than usual. You'll noticed that survivor queues are insanely quick, even with SWF.
---
I usually laugh at people using the term "genrush" but I'll make an exception in this case. This team is literally made to smoke gens before you can say "noed is balanced".
---
Yeah, too bad the ending is kinda shit
---
He's fine to play against, hell. I have a mate that only got the game yesterday and he destroyed a ghostface by looping him. He's got the stalk, but he's seemingly not that fast. I haven't died to one yet either. The only thing I can see that might need to be removed is revealing the aura of a survivor that pulls you out of stalk. That's stupid and unnecessary.
---
Really cool! I’d buy this in a heartbeat. Although I feel like it looks more like a Kate skin, perhaps cause of the thighs
---
Yea. I have premonition equiped like...always. So premonition goes off, nice, I see Ghostboi, nice, I stare at him like a madman, nothing. He charges at me.
---
Do you play on ps4? I've played for a very long time and would love to share what I've learned but there's too much to put into a comment. If you're interested and on ps4, DM me.
---
Because rank 20s are complaining. They're literally going to freddy him.
---
Ohhh with Nurse, NOED is not needed at all cause of her fast hit recovery! You could try running something like STBFL to make that recovery even faster! MYC also works realllllly well on her!
---
Well I’m at rank 2, where killers are more competent than at your friend’s rank
---
The blade add on bug is back?
---
I’m not rank 20
---
There is music that crescendos as you break him out. When you do you get points labeled "Reveal" and he flashes white.
---
I've been hovering around there as a survivor and   he's still easy to get away from. There's no issues with him.
---
Veri smoll
---
I never said you were. I'm just stating a fact. There's alot of rank 20s complaining.
---
Send me a message and Ill send the unedited one :)
---
Hahaha thanks!:)
---
You say he’s ‘seemingly not that fast’ even though he’s 115% movement speed like normal killers. He can just 99 you, sneak up on you and expose you without much you can do about it
---
Thank you!!
---
Wait, are you the oink guy?
---
revel him, take the hit and the stalk is gone.. scurry off and get healed.. .now he's gotta find you and stalk you again.. 
---
You should try playing him. Meyers stalk is worse then this Shy bois.
---
Frodo handing out all the hexes. Who needs Gandalf.
---
Lol yes the YEET 😂😂😂
---
True.  What's the point of rushing the game for your 4k when you can actually do things in a killer game and get way more bp's.  Gotta savor the game not just rush everyone down.
---

---
Because it only works with Claudette.
---
Ikr 😂
---
They are literally not changing anything you just mentioned. They are making balance changes that should have been implemented on his release.
---
I miss pink gradient guy
---
Lmao still better than me. I'm rank 18 killer. I like playing killers but I'm shit at it. I'm trying to get better but it's sort of a chore when the survivors just make fun of me
---
Lmao, when you reveal him, the amount he stalked you doesn’t go away, so whilst you’re stood revealing him he’s stalking you, and the next time he finds you he only has to stalk a little bit
---
Oooo Sloppy Butcher can be really nice paired with nurses!
---
Because it has been Double Bloodpoints a lot of groups have played survivor and offered escape cakes etc to maximise bloodpoints. They can also farm hook rescues if they are a group.
---
Normally I play on PS4 and find it really hard to get into games as a survivor as I solo queue but this weekend it's been the opposite.
---
Hand for a Hand, Eye for an Eye?
---
OK, and that's his power. That's just what he does. Stalks and kills. If you look at him, he can't do that
---
&gt;be me
---
&gt;get matched with legacy nea
---
&gt;feelsgood.jpeg
---
&gt;she starts hopping in and out of lockers
---
&gt;gets downed after two seconds
---
&gt;waits on the hook to dc until Im right beside her
---
Man legacy players are truly skilled. No chance I could have pulled that off
---
Jokes on you, *I'VE BEEN BRINGING THE MORIS! HAHAHAHA BOW BEFORE MY ENORMOUS EGO AND DISREGARD FOR OTHER PLAYERS* /s
---
He can 99 you whilst you’re stood revealing him, which doesn’t get reset after revealing him, so yes he can do that, just a little bit later
---
Its also stupid how that was medium vault. Idk why the devs changed it to make fast vaults harder to do.
---
When the killer hooks them then comes straight back at you:
---
*"I am inevitable"*
---
It’s a visual bug. You’re still getting 4 stacks despite it being at 3.
---
I’m doing the same but to 40 so I get all the teachables, then I’ll probably try get them to 50. The double bloodpoints have helped a lot!
---
Relateble
---
"So no head?"
---
You mean what Myers with Monitor can do? Literally jump out on you and pop his 99% Tier 2 to Tier 3 and insta down you with the biggest lunge in the game? K
---
I'm on ps4 and I've had trouble getting killer games but no problems with survivor game. Just seems like everyone is playing killer.
---
Ohhhhhhhhh right. I saw something about that lol. (Sry new player trash here)
---
Tier 2 Myers has a heartbeat even with monitor, so no, not like that at all, ‘k’
---
you just need to know how the normal structures look like (like t-walls and l-walls and cars and stuff like that) and then you can pretty much loop from there.
---
Visual bug had it all day yesterday
---
I say no, since they changed them. I loved them when they came out, but now their ability is sad  to see, the vault is slow :( ....not worth anymore
---
just run in the direction of a pallet
---
I would agree atm as I tried for 20-30 mins to get into a game as a killer before I gave up, but normally I find games as the killer waaay faster than survivor games.
---
Can we get Keanu Reeves to be the next survivor ??
---
would be epic tbh
---
If you can't loop someone for 45 seconds, then that's kinda on you. While I agree that maybe the timer should be tampered with a little bit for the amount of time you're marked, since it's just one person, someone at rank 2 should be able to run around long enough to stop it. I haven't died to a ghostface as of yet, and all I've had to do is run in circles for a few seconds. It's very easy. He's actually balanced. And there's no need to nerf him. He actually makes the game interesting
---
Its called lagswitch and its fart
---
*Projectile vomits at anything in reach*
---
Man, lagswitchers are truly professionals
---
As a new killer main I hate going against SWF. Yesterday I waited 30 min for a killer que and 4 people with russian names instantly joined and they had flashlights and toolboxes. I just closed the game and watched youtube after that.
---
Spine Chill users be like:
---
Don't talk to my bubba like that
---
Decapitation isn't allowed cause it would mean they have to change their rating and its not allowed in some countries. :( was said in a live stream when the spirit was being released
---
Just play survivor and enjoy all the bloodpoints and the amazing queue times for once. I love these events because killer queues are still bearable and I don’t have to wait 5 mins for a solo queue survivor game
---
you don't even need double pallets. You just need jungle gyms, and simple, normal loops.
---
Is TFW = The Fuck When?
---
So the Hag tearing a survivors stomach open and eating their organs is fine, but beheadings are not?
---
so i have my build for now
---
Nurses
---
thatanatophobia
---
sloppy butcher
---
and BBQ
---
nurses sees healing aura sloppy means you have more chance to detect and thatanatophobia encourages healing
---
so survivors must choose
---
have high risk of detection + wasting time on healing or being injured so chases last shorter + slower action speeds
---
and sloppy + thatanophobia stack 
---
Briliant! thank you
---
Yes. Prayer beads suck. Fuck prayer beads, we actually have a decently balanced killer now, who's fun to play as and against, and because people are scared of a minor challenge they want him to be turned into a fucking tree stump.
---
When new killers come out I play survivor throw on wglf adrenaline bl/dh and spine chill or premonition and hope for the best. You'll get more points playing survivor games even of you are first dead every game opposed to waiting 1 to 10 years in the killer que. Just my 2 cents though
---
This made me laugh, it's like there's this wedding going on, and some drunk hillbilly crashes the party
---
1. Many people are playing Killer because of the Bloodhunt, Anniversary Event and Ghostface.
---
2. The devs have updated matchmaking, in preparation for dedicated servers.
---
pallets are still pallets you know
---
They changed it some patches ago. Now you should always aim for the eyes.
---
His base movement speed is the same as Wratih, Trapper, Pig, Hillbilly, Leatherface, Freddy, Plague, Doctor, Michael (tier 2+), Clown, and Legion. His timer lasts 45 seconds. Which is a long time but if you know your loops, it's not that bad. He's an M1 killer 70% of the time. I've played several games as and against Ghost Face and the complaints I've been seeing are seemingly from either a lack of skill or a lack of experience. A good survivor will spot me and drag me around a loop before I can either a) mark them or b) hit them.
---
I know he lagswitched and it's bad, but why is the dumbass nodding instead of tbagging, heez he's dumb
---
Me: Hey I really want to play killer
---
*30 mins later
---
Me: I guess I don’t
---
So I went from hating Legion’s guts to loving them after the rework. New Legion has to rely heavily on the typical 115% speed m1 chase, but has the potential to get the entire survivor team injured in a very short period of time given the right circumstances. Here are a number of general tips and rules of thumb I’ve figured out while playing them.
---
- Enduring is a necessity. The cooldown on dropping your power is really poor, making pallets almost your friend in a sense. Landing a frenzy hit and then being stunned out of your power is actually a good thing because of this. Spirit fury alongside enduring is also a great option. 
---
- Drop your power at pallets against survivors you’ve hit with frenzy. If they don’t drop it on you, at the very least it will place you in a good position to begin the chase/loop.
---
- Learn when to and not to use your power. There are many instances in which you should just m1. Rarely should you ever bother frenzying an already injured survivor. Frenzy hitting an already deep wounded survivor accomplishes nothing but giving you some extra points.
---
- Be patient with your power. Don’t play too risky with the distance at which you activate it from a survivor and try to be cautious on when you swing in frenzy. Keep in mind the field of view changes as well. Sometimes you’ll end up hitting lunges that didn’t look possible because of that.
---
- Discordance is a great option. Knowing at least two survivors are on a generator will often allow you to utilize your power to the fullest. Without grouped up survivors, your power loses a ton of its purpose. 
---
- Unless you have iridescent button or haven’t hit the survivor with frenzy yet, never vault pallets. A smart survivor will continue to vault it back and forth knowing that you’ll be unable to down them until you drop your power. You just end up wasting time. This ties back in to trying your best to eat pallet stuns no matter what when in frenzy against an injured survivor as well.
---
That’s the gist of it. Lemme know if you’ve got any questions. New Legion isn’t too strong, but he’s not at all useless and fun as fuck imo.
---
Get to a pallet in time when a killer with no terror radius and normal movement speed has you 99’d and is very close by, I’d love to see it
---
Ghostface has a very audible sound he makes when he’s close and in Night Shroud, not to mention you can hear his tassel things flapping about.
---
As soon as I saw the change I haven't even tried to use it, since you pretty much have to be a bodyguard and punching bag and the fact that I've tried stacking WGLF by taking hits but the protection hit mechanics are so broken that it registers one out of 2 or 3 times. 90% of games you will be sacrificed before it can activate, basically a waste of a perk slot
---
Birdbox? You mean those *invisible yet visible demonic creatures?*
---
Which is hard to hear from the stupidly loud generator sounds as of last patch?
---
I wasted about 20 dollers on Dead by daylight for Ghostface and his cosmetics, what would be a good build?
---
Definitely a rank thing. Any rank below fifteen is full of camping, unfortunately. They don't know any better and are rewarded because the survivors don't know any better either. And they stay in that rank because any game that involves players with more experience ends with the killer getting beaten big time.
---
Best scary movie meme so far. Fucking laughed my ass off.
---
Break line of sight and try to get behind/to the side of him. If he breaks a pallet or vaults a window, you can easily break him out.
---
You've got to remember, this is all he has. He has no map pressure, in-built gen-defence or enhanced mobility.
---
Do you play with the volume maxed?
---
I tend to have headphones but most of the time have trouble hearing clearly. Could be because I lose focus a lot, but I also play with the ingame volume at like 20 because everything in the game is just so loud.
---
And they all spawned together and moved as a group with tool boxes. When I chased one they all went to another generator
---
Claudette getting moried by Gosthface because fuck Claudette
---
Wrong.
---
Some add-ons are being nerfed, some buffed ahd the spotting angle is increasing by a whopping 8%.
---
It's a minor nerf.
---
Yes, oddly. Same way skulls and the number four is a bit fucky for Asian audiences, culturally more significant. It's specific acts of violence that are over the line, not so much the level of violence.
---
Maybe enjoy as killer not against
---
I didn't mean with the hotfix. I know about that, but the rate at which people are complaining is going to make a drastic change. I'm still holding out hope that what happens to freddy will never happen again
---
Literally me everytime I play killer I just get queued with a toxic swf that genrushes breaks all hooks have flashlights and abuse infinites.
---
I just want a normal game dbd pls.
---
I used to not camp or tunnel and try to be nice, but survivors were never happy, would always insult me even when given a free victory. I changed now, I do it all now, you survivors made me into what I am today &gt;:O
---
these post are gonna be the reason ghostface will become freddy hes fine. OMG a newly released killer who is fun to play as and against this killer JUST came out and you want it to be nerfed already this is the exact reason freddy is how he is today because survivors who want it easy want to nerf a killer that they seem will require a challenge to go against
---
welcome to post 31 about it since the last update.
---
Monitor + Dead Rabbit = No T2 terror radius.
---
Also, Ghostface makes a noise when stealthed within 8m of you.
---
If you have one down and you know the others have opened the gate this is the only reasonable time to camp
---
&gt;You could try running something like STBFL to make that recovery even faster! MYC also works realllllly well on her!
---
STBFL reduces fatique time?
---
Welcome to post number 64 about it since ghostface's release
---
If he hits you, the stalk resets.
---
then I'll wait I guess. Atm it is so hard to find a match as killer tbh. Also, I'd understand it if they nerf him lol he has a lot of strenghts
---
I see Five Nights at Freddy's is looking good
---
It has been there since the dawn of time o-O but ignore it....Just enjoy yourself. If they salty about how they died....it means that you're doing a good job.
---
Imagine yourself like a darksouls character, beating their hero down sending the red words 'you died' on their screen. Feel good!
---
Doesn’t look like it
---
With Freddy being reworked, i think the devs have learned their lesson.
---
If you're having troubles with him managing to sneak up on you, spine chill will do wonders for you
---
You ask yourself what you want most and act
---
It also regresses the gens. It's a great tracking perk, but more importantly the regression is what the perk is good for. Survivors also can't touch gens for 16(?) seconds, so it would more or less force them to get off it or just wait there.
---
Bbq is a better tracking perk tho.
---
Nah Franklin's demise is better imo.
---
So used to r1 but il have to try that x or a different button for skill check
---
p3 isn't but some other dark cosmetics did
---
What did they change about Iron Will? I took a few months long break a while ago and genuinely didn't notice.
---
or not?
---
You were both toxic. No-one is in the right, here.
---
This made me laugh so hard, you must be like the one Ace who doesnt smile. He's got those 'lucky' perks too and lucky vibe, which makes it better!
---
Welcome to not everyone reads this subreddit religiously and so there's bound to be multiple people asking the same thing since we don't all spend our entire lives watching this sub for each individual update since we don't want to be useless lil shits who comment insignificant bullshit on every post they can just to get attention.
---
Fuck off. You didn't answer my post, others did. All you did was complain about how many other posts have been about the same thing. That doesn't contribute. That just shows you're a prick.
---
Bruh just play her a lot. And if you play on console, do yourself a favor and play someone else...
---
This makes sense.
---
or keep 60 second timer but all gens blocked off regress for the 16 seconds they are blocked off
---
What a fucking ancient meme oh my
---
Nice
---
Definitely will enjoy him in more games when he is played less (or if they do v minor changes to him, I can’t tell if I’m annoyed by him or the number of times I go against him) but doing a chan and just talking to my swf group then seeing his head pop out from a corner right next to me is wicked funny and a good jump scare that the game really benefits from. Or when I look somewhere, hear the fucking revealing sound and go “shit he’a here, and if he didn’t know I was here he def does now”
---
I've gotta hope so
---
Thats not rare tho, just grind to 1 mill then spend it all lol
---
*insert groaning elephant noises from wraith*
---
I gotta admit, this is the one true comment on this post
---
Huntress has had enough of your shit
---
1. there is a search option
---
2. if you have problems, most likely, everyone else does too
---
3. is it so hard to guess why killer queue times are long when it's a 2xBP event AND a new killer has just been released?
---
So what, she blinks at you, but can't close it before the exhaustion... easy
---
that just tends to happen with coding, every little change can fuck things over. No dev in the world can produce a bugfree code on its first launch.... this is of course made worse if youre bad at coding (yes you BHVR) and bugs will be much more apperant
---
Absolutely get that perk. ALWAYS good to have bloodpoints and see where people are! 
---
Personally, I’m not a fan playing as him but it’s all up to you to decide. But still, get bbq!!
---
Yeah, but I've got a decent amount of  friends that play this game and no one can be arsed to grind the whole 1 mill. So its never really happened
---
yes she has.
---
Some of the sounds (like survivor breathing and pain noises) have been amplified to an obnoxious degree, most likely higher than they intended. Chase music and heartbeats aren’t always activating, and if they do, many times they’re very quiet, sometimes too quiet to hear. Certain noise notifications are not occurring (sometimes skill checks, a lot of perks that give audio notifications). Certain status noises are not occurring (Michael’s evil within tier up sounds are not occurring, wraiths bell is not occurring). Some maps are having more audio balance issues than others (for example, lerys audio was much more hushed than coldwind farm, but there were still all these errors for both). I’m sure there are more that I myself have not experienced. This update has been one of the buggiest yet. The devs never do anything as it was intended because they aren’t very adept developers.
---
I also usually answer the post at the same time as posting how many times something was asked, but I saw an answer already posted so I didn't want to be one of those people who post an answer to already answered question
---
I saw some of these Packs now more often. Is it allowed to change the look of the perks? I dont want to have the risk to get banned.
---
Yeah it says this at the bottom of the patch notes, that's it's just a visual bug.
---
Do yourself a favor an read the patch notes when they come out, it usually answers alot of questions lol
---
So sick of this. Killers getting hits like these because they're host. 
---
Bring on the dedi servers, at least then we'll both see how ridiculous the hit was.
---
keep up the brilliant work my guy!
---
You can do that as any character. I generally always lunge attack, unless I’m playing hillbilly (just use the chainsaw)
---
Okay haha I keep seeing everyone say it's so good so I think I will definitely buy him
---
with equals, it is a symbol of respect and even adoration.
---
I didn't think to search cause i didn't realize I'd get a douchebag commenting some snarky bs on my post when i was just asking a simple question.
---
Its easy to GUESS. I wanted to KNOW. I wasnt sure if it was a new matchmaking thing or everyone playing killer. So i asked. You can fuck right off with your smartassery. Be helpful or don't comment on posts with the Question flair, dick.
---
If you want to play multiple killers, you need BBQ. There're so many perks that a build you want for a single killer may cost you multiple millions of BPs.
---
I wouldn't say he's fun to play. At mid and high ranks you rarely will see a lot of usage for his power.
---
I know, thanks.  I was just ticked off.
---
And a cook, and especially a teacher.
---
Hahaha yes! I wanted to reply but the game started too quickly &gt;&lt;
---
I want to see video evidence of this because it's easy as fuck for me every single time.
---
Hell yeah, a Blumpkin head would be so cool
---
Y'ARR
---
SHIRE. Hobbit survivors and sauron killer confirmed.
---
Sorry you don’t enjoy life or fun : (
---
I’m just suggesting this I don’t suck or anything I just find this addon pointless at the rarity it is lmao
---
See the thing is that doesn't help anything. Telling somebody "# people already asked" doesn't answer anything other than "it's been asked a lot."
---
Idk why people do that. At all. It doesn't contribute. It doesn't help. And it certainly doesn't answer anything. What's the appeal other than being a useless annoyance?
---
When a kill let's us farm, I let them kill me anyway.
---
Cook is a pretty good idea actually.
---
Those of us with more than 100 hours and a functioning brain stem knew MoM wouldn't last, I'm just amazed it lasted as long as it did.
---
Gotta get dat DLC MONEY
---
BHVR told us they won't hunt us, but won't be able to unban us if EAC catches us.
---
they asked EAC about it and they said they don't care as long as it doesn't give unfair advantage
---
Yep had this issue as well, I sent a report on the forums for it so fingers crossed it will get fixed in the hotfix.
---
The sounds seem to return to normal for the rest of a trial once you get stunned by a pallet.
---
Good to know, I’m planning on starting my survivor main grind tomorrow and I was unsure on how to actually get good. So thanks!
---
Entity, as he starts handing out 9mm's to his killers:
---
"lol"
---
Who is this?
---
Go to bed lol
---
I sadly can't provide it
---
Something I’ve been doing with KYF with some friends is screenshotting every single Ghostface mori and sending it to them. Part of me wants to do the same in public lobbies and DM the victims their pictures. We’ll see. ;)
---
Well, Enduring and Spirit Fury is always a good combo because he's still vulnerable to pallets. BBQ, too, of course.
---
funny thing that you're asking "What's the appeal other than being a useless annoyance?" when I can ask "What's the appeal of posting the same question for the 64th time other than being a useless annoyance?"

teacher was made before Nurse, but got scrapped
---
All it’s missing is a brazzers logo lol
---
I think I just generally don’t enjoy playing against survivor-sized Killers beyond Pig. I like the intimidating factor of the big ones that hulk or float above you a little bit - having one survivor sized one is a fun feature, while having multiple isn’t as fun to me. Totally makes sense as a gameplay mechanic, but I prefer running away from Trapper/Clown/Doctor/Nurse/etc. 
---
That said, I cackled the first few times that I was crouched peering around a bush and a Ghostface  poked his head back around and looked at me. I think it’ll be more fun when he’s just played by Ghosty-mains rather than everyone and their mom. Who knows - maybe he’ll be as charming as Pig?
---
Tl;dr: he feels like just one more small killer, which I don’t really enjoy as a killer type, and not terribly unique, but I think he could go the way of Pig and have fun people who main him!
---
Well, you did state the page number, so that's really your fault, you knew what you were doing, and you had it coming, clearly.
---
Me and my friend's names are "Mori her, Daddy", and "Mori Me, Please" respectively. Doesn't work as often as you'd like.
---
I don’t browse by new constantly
---
That's the point
---
Oh okay makes sense. Thank you
---
watch youtube to learn the basics, then just try to execute that. you can also ask a friend for a kyf game where he'd first play as a hatchetless huntress (to make it easier for you) and later a trapless trapper, and later they can start using their power and you can get much better at it like that
---
Link doesn't work
---
Oh shit they buffed Huntress? :O
---
I didn't know about that . I was taking a break from dbd for a while and returned after ghost face was announced.
---
Oh shit, yeah forgot gifv. Thanks for telling me
---
When "looking at a killer renders their power useless" is too much to handle for a survivor main.
---
/facepalm x9000
---
Shit, you're right. They already said they're sending the Council of Dwights after me. I'm in some DEEP shit, dude. Do you know how many lockers there are in a map?!
---
It doesn’t render it useless since the stalk isn’t reset after you reveal him. Also, I main Spirit :)
---
yup
---
What would good for the 4th perk?
---
Thank you.
---
I am a prestige 3 level 50 and I swear I have gone through 20 webs and only found 3 cakes. I am checking in mystery boxes too but I only seem to get green or pink mystery boxes. I have been using a few BPS though.
---
Samwise Gamgee isn't so wise
---
Go immersive at the start of the game, as soon as you know the killer is chasing someone, find a loop to practice on. It sounds stupid, and you're kinda screwing your team, but the practice will make you a much more valuable teammate in the future. I did this until I was comfortable with how it worked, not ashamed.
---
ok we get it
---
Though I’ve never used the perk myself because I was experienced when it came out, Windows of Opportunity is my number one recommended perk for newcomers to learn the structure of loops and buildings, especially on the fly.
---
Im sitting on 40 cakes on my main.
---
Basement builds on trapper/bubba far too funny.
---
Pretty much the best strategy is to stay immersed and don’t let them find you
---
I felt the same. Me and my friends could not get this man out of his ability, many sads were accumulated. I found a farmer ghostface and practiced on him from different ranges... hopefully tomorrow is better.
---
You were being toxic if anything. So a survivor can't use an item? You're the salty one, mate.
---
Cook is an amazing idea
---
I got 200000 bps as a killer twice in a row I’m okay with that
---
Bro, I just found it on Google, I can try to find it again tho
---
The thing is I think GF is glitched I kept looking at him the same way for a couple matches sometimes it would break him and sometimes it wouldn't so I really don't know what is and isn't intended
---
BBQ and Franklin's are some of the best killer perks, I would definetly recommend waiting for the steam summer sale in a few days and buying him.
---
The thing is it takes about 1.5 seconds of constantly looking at him to break his ability, but he can 99% your stalk meter and leave it there, it doesn't regress over time. Then, when he wants to pop it on you, he just has to stalk for a split second, which doesn't give you enough time to counter it. 
---
Also, the killer gets an audio notification when someone is about to reveal him, so he can have time to react and duck behind something to reset that 1.5 second timer.
---
plag hours
---
Run Whispers and the last survivor alive will never open the gate again.
---
trapper is actuallly really fun and feels awarding
---
I've was running legion a lot but started trying out other killers recently and actually enjoy most of them so definitely am gonna be using multiple
---
If you even get a chance to play. I tried playing a few matches of survivor and just got sandbagged or no one did anything. When I tried to play killer, the survivors had so little brain cells they couldn’t even play (Laurie with OoO using it to see me and I can see her and she gets directly into a locker as if I won’t know and then dc when I grab her). Bloodhunt sucks
---
Does anybody know if ghost face has a splinter offering and if so what its called?
---
Oh I'm on ps4 and I was gonna wait until a sale but idk when that would be
---
Oof
---
Always struggle.  Struggle so much it ticks off the killer.
---
Mash that A button (xbone)!
---
The good old Shire
---
My name chef
---
And Adam Francis sometimes but no one who usually plays him is altruistic
---
Hmmm. It depends on what you'd like to have. Tracking: I'd say Whispers is always nice. Stridor, too. Nurse's is always a great choice.
---
Gen Control: Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel, Corrupt Intervention
---
Risk taker: Haunted Grounds, Devour Hope, STBFL, maybe?
---
Play how you want. Survivors have a 1200 page rulebook they expect killers to abide by. Tell them to cry some more.
---
OhTofu and Damnnohtml have some pretty good guides on YouTube that explain the different tile spawns and how you should loop them both as survivor and killer so you can get the most out of your chases.
---
Amazing, absolutely amazing!
---
That takes commitment
---
Was at first. Now I'm not, but still can't figure out what exactly to do. It's hard to find anyone even with disordnece
---
If only he wouldn't have DC'd that would have been a decent play.
---
That obvious enduring tho, might not have been as helpful as it looked lol
---
Don’t take it to heart man, i play both and I’m equally “toxic” on both sides, its funny.
---
After it all though its a simple “gg” i find the hate mail a step to far.

I prefer to look down.Sometimes they don't notice you are countering their flashlight and they keep using it,wasting it
---
Thx man, you're a champ
---
Reminds me of the wendigo
---
It literally says "unlock" with auric cells
---
I mean, if they want my money they'll add one lol
---
There are a vaste amount of things you didn't mention that are OP, I'm detecting a killer main bias if there are actually only 2 things you think are overpowered. Ghostface isnt AS OP as those things, but 1 hit downs that can be achieved in 4 seconds or less will absolutely be powerful. The only rational I can possibly see is that you are comparing everything to full cordinated SWF w/all meta perks, which is rare, in which case outside of a few additional things you'd have an argument. I do not consider this the standard for what is/isn't OP, because it's extremely far from the average level of play.

Run Iron Maiden and you'll be fine. They'll try to throw page 587 paragraph 2 at you, but they'll be too busy hanging from hooks.

THE HORSE CAN BE MAURICE FROM FATHER CAMPBELL’S CHURCH MAP!!!

I’m crying
---
I found it, it looks like it's from a game called Reset
---
With obstacles around gens, sure. Good luck sneaking up on anybody working on a gen in the open.
---
He is fun to play because he has no downsides... playing against him is a broken shitfest of exposes
---
Either this or find your first gen, wait until he's either chasing someone or hide near the gen before you start working on it.  If he patrols it and it hasn't been touched, it's unlikely he will do much searching around it.  Once he leaves, start it up.  Once you feel more confident, then you can start pressing chases.

Implying survivors arent being tryhardy or toxic either.

1. Blood hunt

2. New killer

It's the banner art for the cosmetic set Boondocks Bounty Collection

"Shit why don't you guys take a few grenades as well"
---
You are my nightmare when I play killer lol. 
---
The lag switch was bs.
---
Run towards them, they don't expect that most of the time. Spirit will think you're running away and nurse will overblink every time.
---
Pretty much you get 100% more blood points if you hook every survivor at least once and you can see where they are on the map after you hook someone.
---
PS4
---
No prob! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. :)
---
2xbp event + a new killer = people wanting to play the killer = no survivors to play with
---
also, this question has been asked 65 times on this sub already since ghostface's release
---
Killer didn't run a mori but there was 3/4 cakes ran on my last match of the night
---
Camping Leatherface. . .
---
Come on man
---
as survivor ive done 10 bloodwebs and got 0 gateau. i have 20 on ghostface and i just prestiged him :/ giving up on bloodwebs for my surv bc its a waste at this point.
---
Like me, except 1 half farming, 5 mori ghost face, and the rest face camping....I hate this community so much.
---
I feel like yakamoas estate is huge maybe its just me then
---
WAAAAAZZZAAAAAAAAA-
---
I did a friendly teabag to some survivors because two of them had the gruesome gateau cake to offer especially me then you know what happened? Those greedy arab cunts (username checks out for them) didn't spare me some of those bps, fuck them. Although, I had one match where there were people who had way more anniversary cakes to offer before this arab shit show match happened. (No offense to Arab peeps but so far I've encountered many of your kind that are assholes.)
---
He wouldn't have saved that guy anyway if he didn't DC since the timing was wayy off
---
sometimes it just be liek that;-;
---
to "E"
---
shes free?
---
I'll give that a shot thanks man.
---
Could be unscrapped, considering the huntress was originally scrapped.
---
would definitely mod this look
---
Ohh you're right...woa
---
Are you sure? I thought the it didnt award points unless the stun actually happened, which it doesn't if you slam during the animation.
---
Made by my friend u/JaniHepo
---
My only issue with him, which I assume is just bugged on my end, is that it doesn't matter how fucking long I stare at him, he still insta downs me.  There's nothing fun about that shit.  I literally stared one in the face at a pallet last night and he broke the pallet, rounded the corner, with me looking back at him the entire time, and I was still one shot.
---
Am I missing something?  Like how the hell are you supposed to break that shit?
---
I switch to Bubba with lightborn when I see more than 2 flashlights in the lobby.
---
Altruistic survivors are really easy to take out with him, even without camping. Get 3-4k quite often at ranks &lt;10.
---
With the blood hunt going on my Meg has distortion on since everyone is running BBQ. So I can work in peace
---
We also don't have a Vampire, Werewolf, Ninja and other generic types of potential good Killers. 
---
Would love to have a Ghostly Pirate though.
---
I dont have problems finding people to play with. I don't understand why it takes so long for a lobby to be created
---
OOO
---
I have it on V. some have it on their scroll wheel
---
The stun happens because the survivor had DC'd, and the pallet hit afterwards. The pallet save would have failed if the survivor hadn't DC'd.
---
Al Snow is disappointed
---
It's still there, survivors just have to earn it now. I guarantee you it'll be more infuriating than ever now, because now the really good players are going to be using it instead of the terrible ones who get caught right away. The ones that know how to save/take a hit for a teammate and run you for 1-3 gens.
---
It's always the claudettes for some reason
---
literally any competitive game is toxic, get over it, we all have. inbe4 downvotes
---
This is actually sick, would buy
---
Ahh alright, it happens a little to quick for my old eyes to catch, couldn't tell if the DC happened before of after
---
Usually I just see 5 BPS and tryhard Billy on bloodhunts
---
I really want to play more killer with the new offering and double bp (I got 193,000 in a single game as doc last night) but now survivors have figured out about the Wake Up! Bug so now killer is really hard to actually win as.
---
it doesn't create a lobby until it has people to play with.
---
I didnt got it with shards but i wasted my shards
---
Would be scummy if I didn't :)
---
Hes just a step below myers.
---
His downside is that you can stop his stalking as survivor but the upside is that his stealth is togglable which is something myers has little control over.
---
Myers stalks at tier 1 being silent, then goes to tier 2 where he is like a normal hitting killer but then after a while he can start getting tier 3 where he can instadown.
---
Ghostface can constantly go into stealth but his instadown is targeted.
---
his stealth is a lot more flexible than myers but myers instadown is more flexible than ghostfaces.
---
So Ghostface and Myers are basically 2 versions of the same concept.
---
Ghostface = more stealthy 
---
Myers = more power
---
Thank you very much for the help :)
---
Never used it though.You just make assumptions.
---
This is why I'm currently running Object. It makes facing him so absurdely easy as you always know where he'll approach from and dragging him out of the Night Cloak is also much easier.
---
it takes the same amount of time that it would if the lobby was made instantly
---
So, you wasted your shards on a perk you thought would get nerfed, and now are upset it got nerfed?
---
In this case his opinion is wrong.Any unbiased guy can say that the perk was Op and now it is absolute garbage.
---
Whenever really. Mostly evenings and early morning though. I stay up pretty late so I’m always around then
---
The perk used to be overpowered. Now it is not. People buy dlca for the character not for a perk.
---
Thanks for all the advice I think scroll wheel is probably the move with left click being a close 2nd
---
Especially after being tunneled. Well. Might as well get something out of this.
---
They really did a great job this time. I'm so happy for them and for us!
---
Something tells me all this guy does is rant and throw fits like a spoiled brat. I'm willing to bet money if you look at his post/comment history, it's just him whining, bitching, crying and moaning.
---
Alright I will add you up when I can
---
Heart beat being weird is likely due to the killers perks whether it be distressing monitor and abuse or furtive xhase
---
mousewheel up and mousewheel down
---
Ghost face is like Myers but worse honestly.
---
I think the best way to buff him is to have his peak around corners make him undetectable around that specific corner since his movement is already restricted at that point and he should get a minor speed boost when moving towards an exposed target.
---
The Clown?
---
It's like quadruple points. Double points, and double the games.
---
no by weird i mean inconsistent, like it should beep pause for one second and beep agian. but instead what it does it has no pattern and seems to loop 2 heartbeat tracks on to of eachother
---
If its just for the perk i would say wait for it in the shrine and buy a good killer youd play as instead unless youre planning on buying them all
---
It's like a comedy necromancy. I love it.
---
So the only going up to 3 stacks is just a visual glitch and not actually affecting my BP
---
unless the bloodweb bones you liek me;-;
---
I've had experiences with survivors who had more than 500h (I'm rank 15 btw) and tryhard the shit outta every single game. So probably the fear thst survs are gonna bring escape cake and items anyway, so why bother farming?
---
Kinda off topic but which movie was our myers from anyway? The original Halloween?
---
It would explain why he didn't get nerfed but Freddy did, no respect for the remake.
---
It’s dumb you can get three golds and a red and get it but one silver fucks you
---
I have decided to get him right away but probably wait for a sale for the rest
---
So long as what I’ve heard is 100% accurate, yes.
---
This kind of model would only work if the game was free in the first place. The game is already pushing it as is with how many DLC there are, but being able to pay for double bloodpoints would just be too P2W in my opinion. It would make lower ranks a lot more difficult, as the non-P2W new players won't have that many perks while the P2W new players will have literally twice as much progress.
---
Spirit cant see you while shes phasing she can only see scratch marks sk if you run backwards or start walking then shell probably lose you
---
hol up
---
I feel seen.
---
Ok good it's only 25% but that 25% helps
---
If you're gonna spend £5 for a competitive advantage, you've got problems.
---
Personally, I bought the DLC because of Bruce BLOODY Campbell!
---
bubba's basically the cook killer. he just needs a chef hat cosmetic
---
Considering a lot of people seem to be having problems exposing survivors, this might be his best attribute. He might be more useful at finding survivors than hiding from them.
---
Wait isn't Adam a teacher?
---
It's the shoulder touch man, Dwight's blowing it though.
---
To be honest, the cosmetics aren't worth it if you already own it with Auric cells. They're just lame white patches on the costume and knife. They should really fix this though; if the DLC costs the same as the character in Auric Cells, you should get your 500 Auric Cells back if you buy the DLC afterwards.
---
sure
---
Yes, if you say op, im talking about what even the most coordinated swf teams cannot handle usually. Of course casuals will find Ghostface op because omg he has a one shot xD. Even myers is op for average survivors. The same way wraith is op for new players. With time and practice, you'll realise that those things were not in fact overpowered but you just did not understand the mechanics completely. Right now, ghost face is bugged, thats why you cant sometimes take him out of night shroud... and about tombstone... im sorry to burst your bubble but you can literally finish all the gens and escape before he gets into tier 3, he is also way slower when he uses tombstone, you can pallet loop him easily and also jump into a locker before he grabs and kills you. You can also see that he has the tombstone addon equipped even when hes in tier 2. His hand is not clenched into a fist and he walks with his back hunched a little. 
---
Things like insta chainsaw billy, 5 blink nurse or omega blink nurse and iri hatchets are op because even the most experienced survivors have trouble countering them and should be nerfed, together with the insta heals of course. 
---
So yes, if you are gonna say that something is op, i really hope you are a top tier player, cause if not, everyone will think you are just trolling. Im not trying to be rude. Love you brother, stay safe.
---
What he is saying is that people that school, use word for word to explain happy feel
---
This is very simplistic and I love that. Some of the other entries are a bit overkill imo.
---
Just blood spilling from the neck
---
I don’t know what counts as a protection hit. Sometimes I feel like I’m part-phasing through my teammates when getting hit and I still don’t get protection stacks.
---
Jesus Christ OP was right. Survivor gang rolled up and are refusing to listen to the other half of the player base. What a surprise.
---
aight im boutta head out
---
It actually depends on where you are in the ranks,  deeper in purple and red you need all four reds, one gold will prevent it. Males adept trophies a real pain in the ass outside of rank reset
---
Me like your words better!
---
Remember this Time last year when survivor mains were just telling killer mains to "get good"
---
We've/they've kinda brought it on them/ourselves
---
(side note: I don't really main either cause I play with friends mostly, but when alone I play killer sometimes)
---
Does anyone have any pictures to compare the change cause they don't look different too me.
---
You can go back to single player to avoid people, tools/equipment that help facilitate blacklists usually don’t help wait times or player population, this lesson goes as far back as Runescape/WoW where server blacklists were a thing in communities 
---
Hence the introduction of auto matchmaking finder which brought the incentive to be as  anonymous as you want to be ( which now 2019 is referred to as ‘toxic’ behavior)
---
They are not cakes, they are gatous
---
I tried this a few days ago but was too early as killer was still in pick up animation so they got stuck in the pallet for a couple seconds then popped out and left.
---
 Street Wise and Windows of Opportunity got BUFFED. learn to read.
---
4chan hours i guess
---
This year actually sucked for them they single handedly detroyed hitboxes and even somehow screwed up vaulting to the point where you can get hit through a window ur not even near. They ruined the pip system to the worst state its ever been (they potentially fixed it already) and they had the bright idea of making it so people wouldnt derank on dc so rank 1 was mostly people who were bad but would dc if they were gonna depip.
---
Way better way to call out the typo than i had in mind 😂
---
It sums up the "Salt/Rant" part of this subreddit pretty well. People yelling their opinions at eachother and refusing to listen to the other sides' argument.
---
You keep complaining about him 99ing you but if you see that youre 99 and hes out of stealth go up to him and make him hit you to reset the stalk
---
I remember when we were talking the same shit about devs not playing as killers at all.
---
oh no, our always survivor sided game is no longer as survivor sided, gotta cry on reddit
---
1- protection hits are randomly recognised by the game so almost no one cares anymore about MoM
---
2- getting 3 protection hit in a single game means that you have to spend 40/50% of the game chasing the chased survivor and healing. This mean that a killer takes at least 2 survivor busy with a chase, so you just waste a lot of time considering you are not doing gens while another survivor is chased by the killer.
---
3- if there were also the safe rescue from hooks counting as tokens it would be much better but with only the protection hits, at the moment, MoM is just garbage. It's only used by toxic survivors always running around the killer and doing nothing else for the entire game.
---
As a both side player I would say MoM needed obviously to change, but not like this. At the moment I see almost nobody using it and like I said before, with both protection hits and safe rescue it would be pretty balanced. If this is its final form I would say that MoM will become another useless and unused perk like 90% of survivors perks
---
New ghost face buff looking insane.
---
You have no way of knowing how much he’s stalked you
---
its their fault tho is it not?
---
I haven't played survivor yet what does escape cake do?
---
Wth are you talking about. The cooldown is longer for wimdows of opportunity. And streetwise has a lower percentages
---
As a survivor main (who plays killer occasionally) i wouldnt say your playing wrong, there is no way to play wrong, theres just certain playstyles that most people will find annoying. I would suggest you dont stay around hooked survivors always move and try to find them, but i main survivor and im rank 13 so i wouldnt say my advise is the best.
---
Enduring got nerfed
---
Oh cool. Didn't know that :D I've never played her. Thought she could still see.
---
Hey buddy get ur gay ass outta my face w that. I’m not gonna spend the time getting a homie with a weapon to red rank.
---
Gives 100% bp to yourself
---
Yep. Its a lot more relaxing, if you will.
---
From 10/12/15% to 15/20/25% is "lower percentages". ok?
---
form 60/50/40 seconds to  30/25/20 is "longer". ok?
---
Nope. The stun time is lessend. Down to 1.14 secs instead of 2 seconds
---
Haha and everyone else was being nice :)
---
“It’s like they don’t even want to play killers , in their own game...”
---
they have to be injured
---
gateau means cake lol
---
Play surv and don't get camped...bc you sabo'd all the hooks. 😎
---
Yay finally survivors aren't overpowered!

So uh...

Bruh aren't they made out of potatoes?
---
thanks
---
Super cool idea, BHVR could use a net or a harpoon for the power
---
I think we can all agree that this anniversary event has been a huge let down so far. It feels so underwhelming and bland. 
---
And sad.
---
If you cant tell that hes stalked you for a while and then just suddenly stopped for no reason then youre just a bad survivor lol its like knowing when michaels at 99 or legion is about to frenzy
---
beybe dweet hours;-;
---
whats the wake up! bug?
---
What did it cost?
---
Seriously, what the hell is up with that? I even set a survivor to prestige. Still no or not as many gateaus as in the killer blood webs. 
---
Also, kinda related, do we know if we can keep using the gateaus after the anniversary event? If not, when does the anniversary celebration end?
---
At least yours don't taste like human flesh
---
I’m literally just pointing out that you can’t tell how much he’s stalked because the guy above said look at how much
---
Our Myers is the most recent movie. He’s like... 50 or 60.
---
their
---
Definitely, top tier for me such a god killer
---
What kinda bug is it?
---
I said if you see that youre 99ed
---
I heard this comment way too vividly
---
Yeah you don’t ‘see’ shit, you assume
---
Anime called Charlotte (It's pretty bad I don't recommend watching it)
---
Enduring actually got buffed. it used to "increase recovery speed" by 75%, now it "reduces stun duration" by 50%
---
it went from 75% to 100% "recovery speed"
---
You see with your eyes that hes stalking you dipshit
---
"Unlocks potential in one's human-clubbing ability"
---
myers is hands down better because of SM addon
---
 Have a quote from the patchnotes
---
* Streetwise: Increased efficiency values to 15%/20%/25% up from 10%/12%/15%.
---
* Windows of Opportunity: Reduced cooldown values to 30/25/20 seconds down from 60/50/40.
---
Read that

SLOWLY

North of the wall?
---
He has to be in the CENTER of your screen

But ghostface was fun
---
Aaaaand now the fucker is walking through walls while wielding a 10 meter scythe. Fuck.
---
This video hurts me
---
Or a knight/suit of armour
---
His mori sends you to davy jones' locker
---
run wakeup ecks dee
---
Tbagging is an emote. Camping and hard tunneling is a play style. The two arent comparable. A better comparison would be the killer hitting a survivor while they are on hook. Its BM. If tbagging triggers you, its working and you should get thicker skin. 
---
Hard Camping is a suboptimal playstyle, so survivors see it as the killer going out of their way to bully a specific survivor. Survivors have to be coordianted/SWF to bully a killer. Killers can be toxic whenever the fuck they want. 
---
Also, you run into more 'toxic' survivors as you rank up because they are on average better. Killers move up in rank and then wonder why the game gets harder. Its a mystery.
---
Funny thing, our dear ace main has the best connection lol
---
;-;
---
SNEAKKKKKIIIIIIIIII BOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEE
---
Wait, they still scream while in lockers now?
---
Well shit, I won't be able to balance out my inability to run the killer. Time to make myself even more useless as a teammate.
---
That feeling when
---
^ligma
---
"Fuck it have some rocket launchers too"
---
It's not even when you get hit. If someone gets hit near you the thud and all happens. It's so....weird. 
---
Such a weird choice.
---
And this is why no one brings GPS
---
This would be so freaking cool!
---
winter's coming *humming in the distance*
---
How are survivors complaining about an M1 killer? He's like slightly above mid tier at best when you get past rank 10
---
real plag hours
---
As a survivor I have high respect, as a killer I despise you
---
If you really want them gains to hot maximum leveling try getting beast of prey, distressing and BBQ on wraith, 50-60k every game.
---
Its so sudden, and the sound it makes gets my heart pumping
---
Where's the hag?
---
I got 56 spending 2 millions on p3 spirit, one cake for level guaranteed for me
---
Because well
---
you know most viable killers could handle MoM without a problem
---
unviable killers had a really hard time against it
---
The solution to this would have been buffing the killers that have been bad  for years (wraith leatherface etc) so they could handle MoM normally
---
But instead, they decided to nerf it
---
I’m not saying how to do it but it affects every action in the game. As in it speeds up every action you do by 15% including generators, cleansing totems, healing. The gates don’t even need to be powered
---
Yeah, you were way too early.
---
Didnt have to explain it THAT hard
---
I use c
---
If she sits on top of it you can't jump in either.
---
BHVR said they know of that issue with looping heartbeats. They are working on a quick fix patch and I think they said should be out soon. They also are hoping to fix some other issues with this patch as well like the Wake Up one as well
---
It’s an exploit that will speed up every action (repairing, healing etc) by 15%. The generators don’t need to be powered for it to be activated
---
Is it from the double points event? I didn’t know this was included. Assuming its gone now?
---
So i make about 100k to 150k oer game as Killer in the Blood Hunt.  
---
And about 30k to 40k (if the killer doesnt have a Mori and/or my teammates are dying like flies)...  
---
So no i still make more as Killer
---
thank. that shit messes with me
---
I been getting facecamped/tunneled/teabagged by 3/4 of the ghostfaces ive played against lol. Probably bc i piss them off when i reveal them and loop them the qhole duration of being exposed
---
my one true fear will always be hag but I have had a few jump-scares with GF popping up suddenly when I run by
---
Read this as “girlfriend”. Got stuck for a moment.
---
Yeah. I'm a survivor main, but, objectively, the gates were already open at this stage - there was really no point for him to go after anyone else. It's shitty - but it's understandable.

You smartasses better not bring up the old no blink nurse combination or so help me

Those all just sound like complaints about the frequency of rank reset, not bloodhunt
---
Wow.... people in this community suck!
---
Oh sort of like legion? Shut the fuck up
---
Damn, just started playing the game again and had totally forgotten about the existence of the shrine. Gonna have to check it out tonight!
---
You know he had to do it to them
---
There are no dedicated servers yet although with this issue I often wondered about dedicated lobbies and then the killer hosted the game
---
I've been running small game on most of my survivors because of the resurgence of NOED meta (especially during the bloodhunt) and I still manage to run right over every hex trap and scare myself when she pops up. 
---
And yeah I was on auto haven and running into the bus just ... for funsies I guess he and popped up suddenly near the pallet from a crouch and I nearly threw my controller from how much it startled me.
---
&gt;Nothing you do, for better or worse, will change their infantile attitude.
---
You might want to take a look in the mirror bucko.
---
good, I hate survivors who hide around the map all the time, be impressed but not useless since 99% of them are.

This video needs more epilepsy warnings than a PS4 game loadingscreen

*Silent chanting of no blink nurse*

No, it's for the 3rd year Anniversary event. Just started a couple days ago.

Let me guess...Jendinese
---
You could have recorded it and taken a screenshot of the recorded video
---
the gateaus are usable after the event but not in the bloodweb after it. [Here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/69629/gruesome-gateau-offerings) is the confirmation. no clue when it ends, probably with the bloodhunt unless they have something planned.

......i don't get forced character shipping and i never will. How would any of these characters (Other than Wraith and Nurse) even fit together? They don't have similiar personalities, old hobbies or interests. Their stories and motives don't align so i don't fucking get it.
---
What perks do you use?
---
Unlockables have chances to appear in terms of their rarity. Hence the attribute 'rarity'.
---
this also happens when people code a little differently from each other and all have to work on the same project. crap happens, hopefully the hotfix comes out soon.
---
I understand why he facecamped. No killz when gates are open? Kinda sad tbh but yea.
---
I say just delete the nurse lmao
---
I have been playing ghost face and i have 3 ebonis and one green one, and I will not use it during double bp, I would just feel bad
---

YOU HUSBAND NOW
---
There isn't just top tier meta players and casuals, there are also a large amount of in between players. Time/practice/experience has nothing to do with it. 
---
Take me and my friend as an example. We both have played this game for over a year, so obviously we have a ton of playtime and access to all the perks we need. We are extremely knowledgeable about the game as well. However, we don't really strive to take every game incredibly seriously, and often times we love to play gimmicky builds. We also don't like to try to get to high ranks intentionally, as we have both been rank 1 multiple times and don't see a real reason to go for it. What does that makes us? We are absolutely far from causals, but we don't take this game as seriously as many high rank players. We tend to stick around ranks 7 to 5. We also only usually play 2 man SWF.
---
I can usually get to tier 3 at least twice before all the gens pop without any slowdown perks, and that's even against SWF. You usually pair tombstone with a perk to help get it faster. Yea, the add-on has some downsides, but the insta mori kinda makes up for them and more.
---
Well bug or not, I included that in my original comment. I would definitely call a bug like that OP.
---
Anything that makes the game extremely unfair for any 1 player or more should be nerfed in my opinion. You can't just say only things that constantly effect the highest level of play should be considered, because then the normal level or causal level gets ignored, and that's leads to a shit game. I play a few different trading card games, and it's the exact same premise. Just because something is counterable, doesn't make it actually healthy for a game. 
---
You can counter NOED, but free kills/downs for failing is laughably unfair. I would go as fair to even say that's not an opinion, but a fact.
---
You can counter RUIN by just having 4 good players who can just play through it, but on a casual level it holds up the game and gives killers free wins. It even screws players like me because I actually have to go find it even though I can do ruin skillchecks, because my teammates usually can't.
---
I'm honestly struggling to find a survivor example that's not full SWF, a nerfed perk from the past, or instaheals, so I guess I'll just skip one for now.
---
In conclusion, the suggestion that anything besides top tier problems shouldn't be considered real problems needs to die. 
---
Luv u 2 brotha. &lt;3
---
As a Spirit main, I don’t recommend doing this. Although she is invisible, you will still collide with her &amp; she’ll get a free hit. If you’re injured, she will hear you, making it even easier for her.  TBH, other than Iron Will, there really isn’t a drastic counter to a good Spirit.
---
You know we had to do it to em
---
and here I am, a dickhead that tells everyone how many times the question they asked was already posted since the last update
---
G-g-g-ghost pirates!!
---
A ghostly suit of armour that relies mainly on hearing them clinks and clanks? 
---
That would be scary but loads of perks that interacts with terror radius would be useless.
---
Like diversion or stakeout or monitor and abuse?
---
my favorite thing to do right now with ghostface is double crouching add ons. you zoom right up to them on a gen and yoink them off, it's a blast
---
NO YOU’RE BREATHTAKING!
---
Considering it took the killer almost a minute to get the guy I find it hard to call his sudden movement changes "smart"
---
A vampire? Draining blood or a blood sensing perk.
---
I think loads of "tunnel potential" if it works like that.
---
Boohoo the killer isn’t following your made up rules
---
I guess actually playing DBD at work would be a bit too obvious though.
---
Skill: Goodbye!
---
Plushies are everywhere and you can teleport to them and strike out of this phase dealing 0.5 damage and causes double the exhaustion . 
---
Players can interact with these plushies to make them not interactable
---
He can double strike causing double exhaustion and 1.5 worth of damage. Can only be used every 1 minute
---
Causing more than 2 hits of damage causes recovery / wiggle time to get longer by 50 percent
---
Death is cute but inevitable
---
Hahaha no they aren't, I got 33 ebony moris on one killer during the winter event it's actually annoying me to use them all still today
---
If you have to work harder and have trouble in a chase youre a low tier killer
---
Well lucky you I play pig
---
I would say doctor
---
Yeah but spirit and possibly even ghostface now outrank her in skill needed, needing a high amount of skill to play doesn't justify poor game design.
---
Who else wants ya boi Captain Feathersword as the next Killer?
---
What's wrong with that logic? The kid have every opportunity to man up and fight.
---
Really hope they would add a mascot costume killer. Like one of those you see in amusement parks
---
Sure\*\* lmao
---
SUPPPPPPPERRRRRR SNEEEEEEAAAAKKKKKKYYYYYYY BBBBOOOOIIIIIIIIIEEEEE
---
:( guess I'll keep panicking when i see her then.
---
INB4 King Crimson skips time till you're playing again.
---
I'm not expecting him to follow any rules. It happens every game though and you just have no fun being a survivor. I don't mind the different playstyle if it was not just every damn game.
---
**Art takes time.**
---
**do not request free art**

**[say hi to for_exposure for me!](https://twitter.com/forexposure_txt)
---
Honesty he's pretty fun to play, and all three of his perks are useful. Probably the first killer I'd buy if I had to start over.
---
ZOINKS!
---
I'll give it a look. Thanks :D
---
its just survivors who dont know how to counter him yet
---
last night i got 220k in one game as ghostface. crazy points. only played a few games and ended up with around 700k.
---
That's what I'm saying, yeah. Maybe I misunderstood what you meant when you said he's a no brain killer? Was it just that his power doesn't allow for any creativity or mindgames?
---
I was getting 150-200k per match playing killer and was waiting maybe 10mins. 10-15 mins a match. Playing survivor I was getting 30-40k max most games was getting 15-20k, if I was lucky because all the killer camped, tunneled, or were so bloody thirsty the match was over in 2 mins and also potato players just standing around.
---
That's some advanced use of lagswitch right there holy shit
---
Yeah I have to agree with the running vaults, that is some BS.  
---
Playing survivor has never been less fun, on the flip side.  Playing as killer has never been easier.  I mean hell, if i spot a survivor.  They are going down and fast, no matter how good they are.
---
haha probs
---
HELLLO children
---
Literally me lol Playing with/against Ghostface the past couple of days is the most fun I've had with this game for a long time. Before that, I played when the plague came out, but she's not really that great, so I stopped after about a week or two.
---
This is only fun when you're not currently 5 feet from GF on a hook :( Stop flirting and lead him away Jake, you fool
---
He would be a lot more fun if gens didn't go so quick.  
---
Don't really have much time to run around stalking, and then he just becomes an M1 killer.
---
"Totems are now nuclear missile silos."
---
well trying playing survivor for a couple matches, you will want to go back to playing killer even with long lobby wait times.
---
If you're using BBQ you shouldn't waste any offers since you'll probably get bloody party streamers and to my understanding they don't stack(?)
---
It's because everyone wants to play killer due to the Ghostface release, and the bonus XP.
---
It ends June 2nd
---
No, there are still a lot of people lag switching and I get it almost every game. Hit registration still sucks due to this. Plus fast vaulting is still pretty shit and hardly actually works.
---
I’m hoping this becomes an actual meme that transcends the DS fandom!
---
too bad it's just an event offering :(
---
this has been posted for the 67th time since ghostface's release \\\[T\]/
---
double bloodpoints + a new killer = everyone wants to play killer = no survivors to play with
---
All I look for is the closest and second closest jungle gum or pallet. That way I have 2 directions to get fucked in
---
it's not an add-on, it's an offering
---
they don't expire, you can use them
---
this question has been asked 29 times already since the event started
---
Remember to get all the mystery boxes, they seem to have heightened cake droprate.
---
But yes, survivors gets less cake because their drops are split with the firecrackers..
---
layout remains the same, totems and pallets don't.
---
Change legion with myers, then its ok.
---
YASSS ITS WORTH IT ?!?!? is that even a question?!?!?!    if youre good ,  youll basically be getting double blood points all the time while also seeing where survivors are? like there is no question to get BBQ
---
Where is Wake Up
---
Yeah, don’t run noed
---
It's not the best I've watched but it was definitely worth a watch
---
Have you been checking brown mystery boxes?
---
I got 4 in 7 levels (level 1-7 no prestige) 😅
---
 Wraith, then Hillbilly
---
I mean you could just learn how to counter him since its only been two days
---
Run spine chill, prem, alert, and ue, and  never run into the killer.
---
You dont see a disemboweled body, she just pulls out an organ and eats it. Beheading is much more gory than that
---
You clearly never played nurse much. Nurse is all about mind games, predicting survs next move etc..Are they going to stop? Go forward? Left? Right? Maybe run back? shit like that while with spirit i simply listen and ocassionally bump Spirit was amazing at mind games also but before nerf
---
I almost had this lat night. One fucking person used an escape cake. Such disappoint
---
“Slightly” increases detection. Hardly call that a nerf. Bad survivors will still be bad and cry about how OP he is.
---
The one thing that will probably hurt him is the pallet stun knocking him out of stealth. A little unfortunate, but it’s still not the end of the world since you can still mindgame like crazy.
---
I've wasted time on you. You're not even worth talking to.
---
I’ve never had one come out like that, but honest to god (and I’m not a big fast food guy) Burger King makes kickass burgers that come out looking way good
---
If you can't prove that Mins were colluding with the killer, then no one will be banned. And from your description it's not obvious that they were working together
---
If you didn't want to farm, the other players tried to force you and ended up killing you on purpose, yes it is bannable.
---
You must have reported them in-game otherwise your footage is worthless.
---
Guy who died in one of those old metal diver suits.
---
I seriously built up 1 mill blood points sut to get BBQ , i tried playing im a few times, i dont like playing as him but i mean my ghost face has tier 3 BBQ and it is HELLA AMAZING
---
Pitch's Davy Jhons!!
---
I've been playing since release and I've had my fair share of experience with everyone, I stopped playing nurse after they buffed her even further. If they stop, blink onto them and left click, If they run back, look down and left click, if they move, keep blinking. With spirit the audio is the only thing that assists you, nurse has no counter
---
Poor thing
---
Again you have to tell me that? So embarrassing. 
---
You could have just not replied but no. That would be the nonchalant chill thing to do and as we have established that ain't you. 
---
Take youre fedora off, take a deep breath and delete the post. Its just sad now.
---
My friend is way better than me, I always chalk it up to me sucking but he's been getting fucked all night and claims it's lag. I'd disagree normally but I've had a few weird encounters with the killer and they just walked the other way probably because of the lag as well.
---
ty for bringing me a laugh :D
---

---
I already said who it was and it wasnt Jen lol.
---
Lots of people be tbagging as killer like 'IN YOUR FACE YOU MOFO' lol
---
Ok, but tbf that is something Jen would do
---
There is incentive to be rank 1 tho it makes for better games with better teammates and not a bunch of ppl who have no idea how to play, go down, and immediately dc
---
Bruh lol I know why it gets harder. I think mostly what I'm talking about are these people who tbag at every pallet, get downed, and then disconnect like what? Did they expect me to not down them?
---
:D
---
Step 1) Run to nearest pallet when discovered by the killer
---
Step 2) Make your way to the most OP loop on the map i.e ironworks window
---
And at some point, if you have balanced or lithe try to find a drop or window where tou can activate it
---
Also if its a trapper or hag then dont bother. They’ve probably already trapped it.
---
Looking up does nothing if timed right.
---
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I SACRIFICED?!
---
I had a game against Hag where she two hooked everyone and no one even tried to unhook. To be fair, the Hag did have the mint rag

---
Both sides are as AIDS as eachother. Killer complaining about “gen rushing” and a survivor using his single brain cell to say “ez”
---
I literally name all of my accounts after this game, but if you check my posting history I just don’t play it anymore. I don’t think I have a problem with the game, but I think it’s just after 1250 hours repairing the same 5 generators and buying a new dlc every other month just doesn’t feel the same
---
Man I noticed this and was so annoyed. I can never win chases so my only hope is stealthing away, which is now way harder to do. Guess I'll just be even more of an annoying teammate.
---
I would totally love to see him here. 
---
he would NEED to be riding his horse, however it could just have a limited sprint function (IK its not how horses work, but this aint some normal realm and/or the horse got injured and died too.
---
It's garbage and doesn't do shit. Just remove it
---
yeah, but ive only gotten a couple across my webs. theyre just as rare it seems XD

MADE WITH MEMATIC
---
She doesn't go below greens and usually hovers purples/reds at the end of season, even when she didnt' derank and played in red ranks most killers got shat on. I have to admit I get a bit uncomfortable when she starts hard-insulting players who are legitimately low ranked but it's not like that most of the time.
---
Clink clank, drag the chains.
---
But also noisy yet meme worthy if they make the noise hilariously janky.
---
First killer without headcosmetics or prestige 3. Less points to spend, i love it
---
It could actually be the terror radius, just with a different sound.
---
I know, even luckier, the 4th one was from a common mystery box(they’re in the loot pool for them). Make sure to get them mystery boxes! Already gotten a fair few from them :)
---
When all 3 or more survivors are working on the same gen and it pops, they all get a boost for 3 seconds. Its called “SNATCH AND RUN Y’ALL”
---
Iron grasp is a shit perk and agitation is for people with no better perks/dedicated Leatherface mains. A wiggle perk would either be busted or too useless to run.
---
I dont even know why they bother saying  ez. I had a game where i got sandbagged then that person afkd and died first. Waited in lobby to say ez like wtf
---
When i get called a camper when im carring the survivor to the hook and see a meg coming in for an immediate save so i insta down the saved person
---
I tried teabagging with the survivors and the just ran away :'(
---
Please say /s because right now you look like a moron
---
I tried teabagging with the survivors and they just ran away :'(
---
So one time I was in a match and I met a Jeff who was being playful and I was in a good mood so I decided to farm with him a bit. Well I can't just farm with one person so we'd go and find other survivors. At first they seemed to get it, but then I downed the Jeff and left him to be healed like he had before. Well those assholes just left him to bleed out and I couldnt even find his body to pick him back up to stop it. I felt so betrayed that they did my boy dirty like that so I decided to just calmly follow and wait until they popped the last gen and NOED activated. No one even got to a door
---
H'ARR
---
At least it will still be usable after the event is over. Peanits confirmed it [in this thread](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/69629/gruesome-gateau-offerings).
---
Yea but if the terror radius is clonking noises then it removes or covers over the actual clanky armour noises.
---
Because if you're not moving then you shouldn't have sounds of metal but terror radius would have to exist.
---
He would be a neat killer tho
---
Hag in C
---
Choices
---
Well if playing survivor gave BP equal to killer and playing survivor was more fun and rewarding, it really wouldn't be an issue.  But if you get camped, slugged or tunneled.  Why would you not switch to playing killer?  I did and it was the best decision i ever did, only downside, I clearly am not the only one who did so.  Lobby times for killers have been bad for 4-5 months now.
---
After the swf messaged me and asked me why I did that. My only reply was 'Ask Jeff'
---
It's because of the bloodhunt. Should go back to normal after today.
---
When he first came out is what I mean, happy cake day btw!
---
Technically, probably none of the survivors actually know how to fix generators. They just fiddle around with parts and the entity grants them gen progression to give them hope.
---
Thank you:)
---
Well, if I search on Google it says that it is made of potatoes what the Frick google 🥔
---
Monitor and abuse let’s u get a little closer to generators before the survivors run away
---
Bom, bom, bom-bom.
---
I've always wanted a killer with a hook on a chain. They'd "whip" you with it for a basic attack, and their Mori would be them tossing the hook at a running survivor and it landing in their neck, then reeling them in with the chain, the hook pulling through their skin. Their power could be latching onto survivors and pulling them towards you/injuring them. Alternatively, I think it'd be cool if they could pull down small spaces and entrances with their hook, collapsing windows, pallets, and entrances.
---
Y u ruin it
---
F stands for Freddy
---
*hears heart beat* “wtf is that”
---
It should be LeChuck from Monkey Island, maybe even get Guybrush in as a 'survivor', but i'm unsure of the way that'd go with telltale gone under.
---
It could still exist in a fit of game logic. It would get louder and more chaotic when moving, and like static shifting and clanking when still
---
Oh so a potential old Greek aged elder who acts as a guiding light and still clings on to hope would still work eh.
---
Cause he would just fiddle around... Then again it could make him the best survivor due to learning how to live in the entity's world over and over again.
---
BBQ isn’t that good for him unless you want no
---
Oof, revenge is a dish best served cold.

Followup question: if Ghostface exposes himself, who wins?
---
meg ~ meg meg meg meg meg meg
---
Yeah doubling back has some uses if you do it sparingly, and only at places with high walls. Doesn’t work here because survivor can see you turning around so you should really just chase through and break the pallet
---
I see, thanks
---
Then I don’t really understand why you pointed that out but ok.
---
Put Plague and Doctor in C. Put Hag in B. can raise pig to the bottom of C tier to keep the amount of slots in each tier

Iirc they said they didn't want to do folklore killers that are common in pop culture

---

That is the BEST I've seen anytime! Good job!

That would be amazing!
---
All these camping ghostfaces are giving the rest of us a bad name :/
---
Iv'e just got the Huntress and David King so I discovered We're Gonna Live Forever, combine that with the double EXP event, the gatous and I'm golden.
---
Same, I still continue to farm with the willing ones, but it is amazing how much some survivors epeen grows when they loop you for a bit.
---
They just want to end this game as quickly as possible and find a real one.
---
true, but I suspect more and more people are switching to killer.  I dont think the play base have decreased, if anything, it has increased a lot in the past 6 months.
---
Premonition isn’t a teachable
---
I do like the focus of killers being more hunters than chase you and eat pallets for dinner till you run out of pallets.
---
Having a slower speed but still... Pulling a survivor towards you feels weird cause they are supposed to get a speed boost upon being hit.
---
I mean with BBQ, Whispers, Doctor's mere existance, Infectious fright and other tracking tools killers have, stealth approach is pretty dead already.
---
Let them have their blending.
---
I'd be willing to settle for Candyman and his hook hand
---
You can't crush their spirits if they don't have a foothold.
---
Being able to separate fantasy from reality is an important life skill everyone should exercise. People play pretend in a lot of games like Hitman, Mortal Kombat and many otherwise gruesome seeming franchises. As a person who really enjoyed Doom and I was upset when it was used as yet another scapegoat on why "todays youth is becoming corrupted".  Many of us gamers who remember columbine take these accusations very seriously and if you had any amount of respect you wouldn't make the comparison.
---
Dude you were both toxic, hitting someone on the hook is just at much of a bm as flashlight clicking after you miss a hit, no entitlement, just jerko plays
---
Yep. During events I have the choice between playing solo survivor where I’m camped or farmed every match and get 4K bp for my time, or playing killer where I have the chance to have fun and get 100k+ bp. It isn’t a difficult choice.
---
It's worth it imo, plus he's not AS bad as people make him out to be, unless you're only aiming Red Ranks which he can get bullied more often there...but elsewhere he's pretty fun imo.
---
Gotta love piggy! Shame about the recent end game nerf :(
---
We can all go to the basement and circle the hooks and teabag until the night ends
---
So the only thing in your post that was actually "toxic" was the flashlight clicking. 
---
Bringing a flashlight isnt toxic. 
---
Using addons isnt toxic. 
---
Looping isnt toxic.
---
Flashlight saves aren't toxic. 
---
Pallets aren't toxic. 
---
So essentially you allowed yourself to get tilted, became exactly the toxic player you're here to complain about, and you have enough if a victim complex to say "the survivor gang rolled up to this post."
---
Are you sure it's the survivors that are entitled?
---
It sounds like you also have a rule book for survivors though, how is that any different?
---
It’s what we deserve
---
I think I drew a meme Legion at some point. I’ll see if I can find it.
---
Yea it’s super boring under normal circumstances. I normally never farm, but damn when it’s double BP and there’s 5x cakes, I’ll farm. That’s an assload of BP everyone walks out with. Everyone wins.
---
Still, doesn't justify rudeness.
---
Just do all the gens and leave immediately - but don't farm points with me (pallet stuns, boldness) without giving anything back (hits, hooks, letting me use my power) or insult me afterwards just because I was trying to be friendly.
---
Know instead of throwing a hatchet all over map you can shoot through all map
---
Nope. What did you really do ?
---
Irrelevant. I didn't think I had it.
---
I’m not even a bad rank lmao I’ve been playing with purple rank killers (even red rank) it’s just survivors have potato for brains
---
I hope it will go back to normal after the event.
---
Not sure what the ability or idea of is in general but his perks could be more survivor influenced...
---
A perk that messes with exhaustion,
---
Another perk that messes with gen repairs and then due to being a survivor himself he knows how to hunt them and how they hide from killers.
---
Idunno just throwing up ideas.
---
Yeah, right? Same here, just farming because of the cakes and as the event is about to end - win-win situation and still people complain!
---
I don't get it sometimes.
---
This feels like a personal attack
---
This happened so many times to me. I've decided that I will play seriously until the survivor shows me that they want to farm. I make sure to get a few hooks before farming (normally just hook everyone at least twice)
---
Loop this you filthy casual
---
it's also weird that you had Dark Sense and the killer wasn't revealed to you
---
That’s why I’m not a huge fan of double BP events or killer release weeks. But, that’s just the way it is man. Do what the rest of us do and browse Reddit or play a web game while you wait.
---
This is perfection
---
so i am extremely unlucky
---
On the plus side, Hag is really fucking fun to play. She has the same trapper big brain plays but with actual map control.
---
Because survivors will use salt during bloodevents (like your post) and BPS during normal seasons. Maybe you misread my comment? I was just stating a strategy for offerings.
---
Thanks for the heads up, Huntress
---
*insert Nurse's extreme smoker breath louder than her terror radius*
---
Considering this is an exploit much like the Legion one, they should put out the same kind of warning and ban players who abuse it just like they did with Legion.
---
He wouldn't? We're basically in hell so he would be fine lol
---
Yeah, not sure I get what you're saying though. I've never had this issue, my internet is fine, and the first 3 slots filled up, but it seemed like the fourth just can't? People would leave and new survivors would spawn in within seconds, but I could only ever get up to 3.
---
Agreed, this is where a good killer will just chase and not mind game. This is such a strong loop that requires bloodlust 3 against a skilled survivor without breaking the pallet.
---
I feel like there should have been an S tier with Billy and Spirit, but keep Huntress in A
---
And Billy, Myers, Plague and Leatherface are OK? All of whom have more out of the their power, and no 30 sec cool down
---
But why would people want to play killer when it's accepted that they wait ages?
---
As frustrating as it could be for a survivor. If they can get more frequent matches (let's face it not EVERY survivor match will feature a camping killer) then I'd wager their BPs gained will exceed a killer's on average.
---
Fairgraves from Path Of Exile would be dope tbh. He has a history of coming back from the dead and has a pretty solid serial killer story already. And he "died" again in the story but it would be easy as hell to work it that the entity took him. Have him collect souls for his all flame as he desperately tries to get back into the world of PoE.

I feel that wouldn’t make it too strong per say, but rather that making this perk have an actual effect is a change that adds a new perk to the game as a buff and is unnecessary. Given WGLF doesn’t directly effect gameplay, (people behave differently, but that’s not the perks fault), if we were to give it a real effect, my as well just straight up slap a neutral survivor perk onto it.
---
That’s exactly why the entity would never let one of its killers be at a disadvantage while actually being a killer
---
I haven’t seen a single red forest map ;(
---
I find this happens to me sometimes too on Xbox. But it’s been ok this morning.
---
Happens when you have up to ten traps to play with at any given time. At least OP didn't level up Leatherface for BBQ lol
---
I messed up with hag but trapper deserves his tier if he is played properly. Most bad killers use him though as he his the default killer and that definitely lowers his reputation
---
And? Myers does that. Billy van too. Or plague.
---
Yeah, someone should warn the killers that maybe it would a good idea to use their time farming with survivors during double bp weekend, instead of facecamping or using their mori...
---
It's never happened to me before, I mostly felt bad for the one dude who stuck through 20+ minutes waiting with me :(
---
Audio is completely fucked with the new update, they're fixing it soon.
---
because killer gets more points as a reward for being so stressful
---
If the problem becomes as public as the Legion one then I'm sure they'll be a hotfix sent out, I didn't even know about this until reading the comments in this post
---
What specifically though. If you mean hag I agree I messed up. Plague and hag should be the other way round
---
I can hear it fine. Plus If you don't look around on Gens your bad
---
Exactly, this meme doesn't make sense.
---
I main freddy, legion, and wraith.
---
Everyone does
---
I'm a rank 8 survivor right now and it seems the only lobbies i get into are with other rank 15-20s and a rank 18 killer. Just when i thought MM couldn't get any worse...
---
well he is after all just a worse Hag
---
Yeah I can’t wait until lobby times improve in a few days. It’s a little ridiculous atm
---
That would be an advantage for the clown because the survivors would stop playing to LOL
---
Nah doctors a solid b tier. I agree with hag but if a doctor is played well than definitely b tier
---
 Never used it tbf, quite new to the game
---
What anime is this?
---
I feel like that's a good spot for The Doctor. For the right player, The Doctor completely controls the map and disrupts everything and can be very difficult to go against (I'm a Doctor main).
---
not having a terror radius mid-chase can be good for mind games i think. still not worth it because stacking takes ages and one person deciding to kill themselves ends your chain and makes perk useless until you get DSed to be able to get a stack again
---
Omg this is exactly what I was thinking.. yall wanted to nerf MoM to the ground surprise motherfucker here comes op wake up.
---
I'll make sure I don't equip it until it's fixed, I used it sometimes for the endgame collapse but haven't for a week
---
Personally as killer I've kept away from the shittier perks and been half ass letting the game run long. I always bring streamers or a gateu as well. So far the only other time I've seen a cake was a 10 minute game where they all brought brand new part and gen rushed me. Only reason it took ten minutes was because I ended up getting a cross map chainsaw on one of them and they refused to leave so we played musical hooks until they got out.
---
A perk that makes you blind to scratch marks, but pools of blood become more vibrant and can be seen for a few seconds longer than they normally would be?
---
I got 25 of them after spending 800k bp on my lvl 50 huntress
---
vs shitty survivors*
---
&gt; His base movement speed is nuts and his exposed timer lasts a short lifetime.
---
Yeah, that exposed timer man!
---
He’s very different from hag. I agree hag is better and deserves a higher tier but put some respect on the trappers name.
---
Just run wakeup and punish their ass...Haha
---
Sure. I'm not gonna argue with you. My opinion is what it is.
---
All the mystery boxes have a chance to drop them afaik. I've gotten a lot from brown boxes. Which is just the best.
---
When I try to farm I get abuse, when I play normally I get abuse.  
---
No way to win with these people.
---
You're really in a place to call others bad at this game when, in another comment, you said Leatherface gets more use out of his power than Ghostface sksksksk
---
Yeah. Not really fair towards the killer though. Since most survivors doesn't seem to understand that farming is a two way thing. The killer needs to hook a few people, hit a few people and down a few people. Most of those that farm believe that just letting me kick the gen repeatedly and breaking pallets is good enough when it really isn't. The killer will just get very little points and a derank because of it
---
True, mate, true.
---
Whatever you do as a killer, it's wrong.
---
I used to main Freddy and wraith (before his rework) and although they were really fun to play as at yellow/green ranks you just get bullied at purple/red . With that said at rank reset I do love to return Freddy. He’s just fun
---
yeahh, I’ve been seeing that a lot too. It’s really unfortunate too :( 
---
plus like... not for nothing but you get way more BP by chasing after survivors/kicking gens than you do just skulking around. (at least what I’ve seen in BP at the end of my survivor games vs my killer games)
---
Uh who doesnt cleanse totems when farming? That's points homie..
---
How about a plague doctor that controls rats? But the plague theme is a little too simular to the actual plague killer.
---
well, I guess it’s a good thing no one asked you.
---
I just got reported for helping a killer I don't know and didn't help.  Not sure why he didn't kill me, I gave up since it was gf and he had me dead to rights.  But he just stopped and ran away.
---
No idea if it will lead to suspension though.  Being verbally toxic should be able to be confirmed though, especially if it's via in game messaging or certainly via xbox messaging.
---
On Ps4 the terror radius has become very very soft in comparison to survivors screaming and stuff. Was it part of the update? Am I missing patch notes?
---
I admittedly find it hilarious when a campy ghostface gets confused and spins around trying to find out who revealed him and it was me on the hook
---
No im saying they just nerfed two perks that needed nerfs. In MoMs case they gutted it to be completely useless IMO but regardless they aren't catering to the survivors the devs aren't choosing one side over the other like the original guy was suggesting
---
True! I don't know though if it's just a lack of knowledge or straight up ignorance.
---
In this case, it was probably the latter.
---
Legend says their Megs still grow to this day....
---
&gt; Seriously though how many more years does this need to happen before we see an improvement in this?
---
What do you want from devs? It's the players who switch to killer. Somehow, outside of BP events they're ok with shitty BP gains on survivors, but the moment there's an event they switch. And, because they're not a good killers, they camp and tunnel...
---
He's barely getting nerfed nor will anyone even notice it.
---
Not to mention some of it are just big fixes a change meant for the ptb, and a buff.
---
People are over reacting
---
It’s still players using bugged perks to exploit the game. It’s been a thing for a day and a half because Ghostface has only been out for a day and a half. 
---
If BHVR is ok with banning Legion players then it’s time to start banning survivors as well.
---
I don’t care if my account gets banned though lmao
---
He does. Leatherface has no cool down, Ghostface has a 30 second cooldown.
---
So yes, fundamentally he will.
---
Realsticly is different
---
Oh, do tell. Hehe
---
Really? I haven't seen the game played at all honestly. What's it like? Is there a "killer" like this?
---
This is so factually in correct it's not even funny.
---
You wrote the same shit in all the post like this, but I must say you are more annoying than any repeated post
---
they have stats for each perk and they also get info on your every match (what perks and items everyone uses) when someone reports someone after the match
---
I agree with you on that point, most killers only shine on certain maps. Killers such as clown are very straight forward, his ability doesn't rely on certain things to work well before his ability can do its thing.
---
Yup it is
---
People arguing that 
---
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BUG OH MY GOD AAAAHAHAHA
---
*oh, you don't say*
---
Plus the grind is a bit too much for me and even when I started playing I played only on weekends.
---
Reports say a woman body was found in a bush, her face peeled off
---
 We will let you know when we know more, back to you in the studio
---
I bet the huntress is hot af under all that garb
---
I love stuff that gives speed ups and usually slap on stuff that adds charges bc it's efficient in a lotta ways
---
Anybody else here a P3 L50 Ace?
---
Yeah because cooldown = how much use you get out of a power ??? Leatherface past a certain rank will never get chainsaws off versus competent survivors, making him one of the worst killers in the game.
---
If you have spirit fury + enduring then yeah just eat pallets all day. For anyone else you're probably better of just going through one or two pallets and giving up.
---
also a Robot would be nice (recently saw “I am mother”, something like it would be so cool)
---
yea, I knew someone would notice me. you're welcome
---
I'm posting that on every:
---
Killer lobbies long
---
will i keep offering after event?
---
sound bad
---
bbq/wglf broken
---
wake up broken
---
Okay thank you! I didn't knew his power sucks so much, because it most of the time hits you and you have to mend. How do you counter him best now? I know he is going to brag about legion, so I hope I can beat him in kill your friends 😂
---
Which technically ends a potential loop with the small cost of losing a bit of time in a chase. And he can slow down the game by getting survivors to tier 4 madness. But my favourite part about him is his tracking. From the illusions to the failing skill checks to the screams. He can keep constant pressure on the survivors. That is why he is b tier
---
And they will. But again some legion players exploited it for weeks before BHVR said they were banning people for it. So you need to relax and BHVR will get to it. All we can do is bring attention to it which we are. Surely theyre aware of it by now.
---
Oooh wraith mains are always nice to see!
---
How do you play him in decent ranks sensei?
---
You need about 7 posts on BBQ not working, and Nerf everyone posts, but yeah, accurate.
---
Ha! Lol no it’s my shoulder
---
Nice!
---
“The Strangler”. Either has some kind of hook on a chain. Or just a chain. That he throws at one of the survivors to grab them at long range,   To of course.  Strangle them. Of course the other survivors can use their various abilities to help them.          It’s some PC Discord game that got a  bit of hype back when it was being announced      Set in a school, I think it’s a 1v5 with revival and more objectives than DBD and you could fight and talk with the killer like Friday.  You can even respawn as a different killer each time one is killed.  But the choices of limited killers and survivors compared to DBD was what kept people with dbd.  But servers are still going with people still playing and uploading.  So I guess people still enjoy it.
---
It’s one of my all time favorite games, right behind Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil
---
You literally have zero point. You've never played killer. You will never understand map control, you will never understand corraling, you will never understand map pressure or zoning. Killers need to make _a ton_ of decisions every second of the match continuously. Do I chase this survivor at the C-Wall jungle gym or do I guard that gen over there? Do I vault this window, double vault, moonwalk the wall, or just bloodlust at this particular window? Should I touch and leave to slow the game down or do I actually need hooks for pressure? 
---
Survivor is _simple_. Get on this gen, hold RB, skill check. Killer chases you, just loop pallets and windows. That's it. If you fail to find a pallet or window, you're dead. You _react_ to what the killer does. The only complicated things about survivor is mind games, but even that is simple and _still_ reactionary to what the killer is doing.
---
I actually was thinking about this the other day.
---
That makes sense, as the one's that they used for special generator/ hook offerings were only for that specific event. However, I wish they'd make it a purple or red offering instead of only having them for a lilmted time. :/
---
on some loops they can just go around the other side, making you just waste time trying to block them from dropping a pallet, when in fact, you'd be better off just forcing them to drop it. tracking isn't as valuable either when everyone just straight up shows themselves to the killer these days anyway.
---
I’m aware, it’s the “I don’t understand survivors” part that bothers me. My post had near to nothing to do with survivors wasting bps so I was confused as to why you pointed that out.
---
Also to anyone who downvoted his comment, (s)he’s not wrong I was just asking why (s)he pointed that out so there is no reason to downvote.
---
I’ve asked survivors to farm. They all 4 agreed. We all get max points. After the game I get messages like “gg ez. Get a life. You suck. Git Gud loser. Learn how to play”
---
I’m like “I literally let you all go?! We farmed in peace and we you’re spitting in my face?” I could’ve killed them.
---
15 minutes is a very long time to wait for somebody who works 8 hours a day and has limited free-time.
---
I’m not defending the DC, but teabagging her is a dick move.
---
Now this, this is fantastic!
---
Toxic
---
This is satysfying
---
The quick and easy meta perks at the moment seem to be BBQ, Ruin, Spirit Fury, and Enduring.  
---
So you get an aura read with BP gains, a game stall, a pallet remover, and a stun reduction to keep up in chases.  
---
You could stick this build on any killer and make some kind of use out of it, though it's rather unnecessary for some killers like Nurse or Huntress who can play around dropped pallets easily.
---
Other nice perks though: Monitor and Abuse, Whispers (only at tier 3), Nurse's Calling, Make Your Choice (for killers with fast travel abilities), Haunted Ground (usually run alongside Ruin or Devour Hope) , Devour Hope (all hexes are a gamble though and you could end up losing it before you get any use from it)
---
Sounds like typical survivors to me.
---
Please tell me this is a joke, thus why you said upper
---
Whenever I play against him as a killer I make sure I get him first &lt;3 I've been blessed to do this twice.

called a guy a 'fucking whiny bitch' for messaging me saying he would report me. mustve been all the evidence they needed

Thats what a no brain killer is its one where all they do isswing and swing these include legion freddy rn leatherface and some others
---
Lmao I usually don't mind an easy game once in a while but these guys...yeesh. I had 3 of them on hook in the first 2 minutes, ignored the last guy (bbq) so he could save, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I wound up letting the last two live because the Jane was actually compentent and the rank 20 Jake...that poor bastard.

~~Laughs in the entire 3 people who played Plague when she was released because she's buggy trash.~~
---
that's because killers only get gateaus while survivors also get the firecrackers. Every time I see a firecracker in my bloodweb I think "you little useless piece of shit took the place of a gateau".
---
A beach map would be dope
---
Honestly, with how much the game crashes for me and my friends, this tattoo is our loading screen personified.

Yeah I agree

I‘d say The Pig because I personally think she‘s more fun. :)
---
😂😂😂 loading is not an escape
---
You know what’s as bad? Going through a window and the survivor decides to rubber band back and having a killer grab you even though their stain wasn’t near you. Gotta love it.

This is how I am with the Borderlands games

Amazing design. Something I would be more than happy to be spending my money on. Good Luck!

Check her bio. She started hanging out at skateparks so I would guess its skateboarding haha
---
With double bloodpoints and streamers / gateaus every game, survivors are incentivized to stay even if they get downed early. Just the struggle points can add up to a nice chunk with these bonuses and it's worth staying to see if you do get unhooked to gather up even more points.
---
I can't speak for regular disconnecters but I have felt the urge to disconnect mid-match before and every time, it was when I felt that the match was no longer worth my time: no longer enjoyable and terrible bp/time spent.
---
Got a bill from level 1 to level 50.
---
In that entire time I got 5 of the gateau, so it sounds like BHVR having some bad balancing issues with getting the offerings to survivors to more than people being greedy
---
While it sounds good, it would utterly fuck matches. So no
---
having power that sometimes work vs people that don't know how it works is not B tier worthy. if that's B, then hag should be S tier. we all know she should not
---
They did say that with the implementation of dedicated servers they will have the tools to look at hit registration, so I am hoping they will have a closer look at protection hits?
---
I am running WGLF currently because of the Bloodhunt and I have had several protection hits that did not count (or the occasional protection hit that I didn't expect to get).
---
I'm still waiting in dedicated servers... I'd rather the game work.properly before more content is added.
---
Better just to run
---
Well it's not like anyone is doing gens or anything while this chase is happening so if the killer wants to fuck around and draw it out that's his prerogative.
---
A lower terror radius for Spirit, especially in a chase, would be a bad thing for her, because her wooosh sound is related to her terror radius.
---
\*oinks in pleasure\*

Yeah sometimes I have 2 in one bloodweb and sometimes I have to wait 10 bloodwebs to get one.

Not true, 15 min lobby simulator + 6 minute game give me avarage 120 000 point.

Meanwhile as survivor I will play around 4 game, avarage 9 000 point.

That 36 000 vs 120 000 in same time.

---
I tried to sneak away from the hook, and immediately got revealed which made me think there was someone else nearby. Only after a bit of searching did I realize it was probably just the guy on the hook
---
I was terrified of him as a kid as well, my father chased me around with the mask on and my cousin scared me with the bloody version. I more so admire ghostface nowadays than fear him.
---
&gt;You've never played killer.
---
Erm, wrong. But keep doing you.
---
&gt;You will never understand map control, you will never understand corraling, you will never understand map pressure or zoning.
---
This is literally what I'm talking about. This is the challenges of the killer. It is more about knowledge and pressure and zoning, than skill caps. It is like comparing "knowing to check that geny you haven't checked" with a flawless nurse blink hit across the map.
---
&gt;Killers need to make a ton of decisions every second of the match continuously
---
Sure. Never denied this. For instance it is more beneficial to go zone the rest of the map than continue to be looped by that one annoying survivor.
---
Literally everything you are describing now is my point....
---
&gt;Survivor is simple. Get on this gen, hold RB, skill check. Killer chases you, just loop pallets and windows.
---
No this is a massive oversimplification and if you are a survivor main you know this. You know you are doing this to try to push through your point.
---
My point is that the intricacies in juping, and avoiding killers, the actual 'skill gaps' for survivors. The things that a newbie has no chance of doing. Are way more difficult and take more time to master, than the opposite. "Killer chasing and hitting, extended to knowing and using their ability, which sometimes has a skillgap".
---
This is something all beginner killers can do. But being a beginner killer *is* still hard. But its not because the killer is difficult to control. it is because of all of the things you have just listed. The map pressure, zoning, decisions, mind games etc. This takes knowledge and time rather than skill in knowing how to break a line of sight, use your sprint perks, jupe the killer, avoid hits and sneak away.
---
I'm not saying killers take no skill. And it is foolish of you to suggest survivors take 0 skill.
---
&gt;If you fail to find a pallet or window, you're dead.
---
I find it so hard to believe you think like this after 'winning' a tournament. (I don't know anything about these tournaments tbf). But you damn well know that survivor skill levels have nothing to do with RB skill checks and finding pallets.
---
&gt;You react to what the killer does. 
---
Well, yeah this is correct. Mind games comes with both. And reactions come with both. But there is no point playing mind games with the killer if you don't know how to avoid a hit or break a line of sight, or form a temporary loop to break away from.
---
Sorry I'm just not convinced. Maybe there is an issue in our definitions of 'skillgap'. Because I don't consider general tactics and knowledge to fall into this, even though the reasons you state are the difference between good and bad killers. I don't think this takes the same developed skill.
---
Who would you say suggest? captain Jack Sparrow?
---
The ones with the add-on names are the ones that messed me up, was really hoping to enter the raffle too.
---
MARKED OUTTA NOWHERE!
---
No, it doesn’t feel the same because I used to get such a rush doing gens actually feeling like I was repairing the generator but now it feels like “hold left click for 80 seconds”
---
Unless you use his power to approach people from the corn for free hits rather than using it purely for stealing. His power is actually more versatile than people are giving it credit for.
---
It does i did it with darkness among us.
---
I was allowed to get the trap door by a Doctor that had totally owned a rando grouo I was with.
---
It made me think I should do the same for survivors from time to time.  That survivor that essentially carries the team?  Don't face camp him, congratulate him for doing well and being a pain in your side the whole game.  Let him go.
---
How about you read my comment again because you clearly didn't.
---
I said fundamentally he does, and I said Realsticly it's different and not Lilley as much
---
Ah, there was a bit of promise there when you entered into a reasonable discussion. You couldn't be more wrong about me. But I don't feel insecure enough to start digging out history and proof of it.

I downvoted because you didn’t t-bag at the end.
---
Since it’s a BP offering it won’t expire. But there are other events like the Lunar New Year, Summer BBQ, and Hallowed Blight that had offerings that could only be used during the events. They increased the amount of objectives for each one.
---
Yes so u dont like how nothing has changed ie the game is the same...
---
Ugh, I'm at work so I can't get my player ID!
---
You mean you didn't buy the game to play Lobby Simulator 2019?
---
That has been very unreliable for me in the past as well. I think it was on PTB (when they tested Ghostface), I had forgotten to take out WGLF and found that a lot of things that would give you stacks stopped giving you stacks and protection hits were still buggy.
---
Right now during Bloodhunt I only get stacks from safe unhooks, with the occasional protection hit that the entity grants me. That being said I haven't had the chance to untrap someone yet (I have pallet stunned the killer and freed the survivor but I cannot remember if I ran WGLF and if I got a stack for that).

Your not toxic enough dawg you gotta be a lil tooooooxic!

---
This happened to me a few times on PS4.  Also had the same issue with healing.  Then the skill check popup got stuck on my screen for the rest of the match and into the next match lol
---
Imagine using such wild concepts as code encapsulation and scope control to limit the amount of times this happens. I know, it's really high level stuff, not putting literally everything into global vars. 
---
Bugs like this are a joke.
---
This is an unlikely scenario, but could be that very minimal people are playing as killer. Otherwise, could just be the time of day not a lot of players are on.
---
I would buy and main plague if this was an actual thing, Amazing work
---
nah im just sick of the fuckers making killer unfun for the past day
---
Upvoting for the effort
---
I keep track of too many repeating posts to save links. you're doing god's work. it's been posted 69 times already since The Ghost Face was released
---
Just use the search bar bruh you’ll probably find the answer quicker
---
Yeah, it doesn't do anything stealth wise but it would make it so that you'd know at least 1 of their perks based on the character they were playing. And only Ace mains would really be at a disadvantage.

I get them all the time, but if they’re getting angry at a game they’re deflecting something and it’s not my problem they’re having it rough. 
---
I usually respond with “I’m sorry you’re having a hard time” or “thanks for the game :)” and leave the message group.
---
I personally get pretty mad at DCs too, but you have to take it into account that you're so good they didn't want to play against you. And if you feel bad for other survivors, give the last one the hatch, it may not get you the (2,500?) bloodpoints for "Nobody escaped" but it makes you and the end game chat less toxic, which may want to make people start doing nicer things for other people, or at least less toxic...
---
t-bagging is like saying "HEY FUCKER", its either to piss them off to no end, or saying hi

exactly
---
Pig just isn’t that great. She’s kinda at that point where she needs some buffs. It’s very hard to get deviousness with her because he crouch mechanic just isn’t that great.
---
Ghostface is just completely superior. At this point playing Pig is a sentimental thing or really just super personal preference. There’s not even a comparison, GF is leagues better.

---
I just see the crapper
---
I leave the weak people who run OoO last, because they will be very easy to pick off in the end and it also allows them to get more points before there demise. Then after the match I’m normally right and it looks like they just started playing her with that perk.
---
Go with Ghostface since you can by Piggy with shards.
---
 Sorry i'm not that active on the forum so i didn't know ahahaha
---
Ranking up is over-rated anyway. Every time I get to purple/red ranks I face killers that love to camp and tunnel.
---
Are you playing on Ultra? Are your frames uncapped? Are the clocks also maxed out?
---
&gt;We also don't have a Vampire, Werewolf
---
I want dis
---
Ouch, that’s painful.
---
If you don't have Make Your Choice unlocked from the shrine, I'd go with Pig.  It's an excellent teachable at almost any killer.
---
Lol thanks :p
---
Sadly agreed. But the point needed to be stated.
---
I will see your 1911 .45 ACP and raise you a DE .50 cal
---
There’s literally nothing there
---
I agree. I absolutely love this perk. So useful
---
that's what I got aswell lol, good luck to us!
---
Cheers xD
---
captain hook!
---
No, mori is he summons the kracken out of yo ass
---
It’s fine, being consistent is good I just don’t enjoy it as much as I used to because I’ve done it so many I wanted to do something else. Yes however it’s the exact same as it was back in June 2016 and that’s good because it makes it so you know what the experience is before you even start a match
---
Maybe it was but it was early in the game
---
Fine. Keep your secrets!
---
i did it with freddy in about 2.5 mio bp
---
Dead Rising Vibes 😂
---
96... didn’t get the David or Nurse cosmetic questions right.
---
This is legit one of the best ideas I've seen, you should make more!
---
Golem would be a creepy killer way shorter than the other killers crawlin around nobody sees him coming lmao.
---
Why tunnel when you can just slug?
---
I have no idea how to contact them but I really am curious to hear what this question is
---
Done with the infinite loops in Lerrys Memorial
---
Well that makes sense now that I think about it haha
---
This is absolutely not true lol
---
What’s your question? For them. Maybe someone here can answer
---
oops
---
You shouldn't really be chasing with hag anyway.  You do a lot better placing traps mid loop to force them to either break the loop to find a safe spot, or continue looping and get smacked.
---
Myers only has a smaller terror radius for tier one and you want to get out of that as fast as possible.
---
It could be useful on freddy, but they are reworking him soon anyway and taking away the wall hacks based on your terror radius.
---
it COULD be useful on huntress, but there are just so many better choices for her.
---
It was weird when I saw it too in the main screen, but if  you check it in any other menu there's nothing on his finger.
---
They either throw themselves at the hook, crouch behind a wall and wait for the killer to leave (which won't happen because they're camping), or hide in a locker on the other side of the map because of "bbq"
---
I- what was he even doing in the first place? No wonder he lag switches
---
Some stats
---
"killer lobbies long" - 70 times
---
"BBQ/WGLF BROKEN" - 32 times
---
"Music not working so good/survivor screams seem louder" - 19 times
---
"will I keep the offering after the event" - 24 times
---
"wake up broken" -16 times
---
counting since the last patch
---
4 seconds to stalk by default.  
---
1.5 seconds to reveal him with a small buffer (which means if he ducks to cover to late you can still reveal him)  
---
Not sure about this one, but it feels close to 30 seconds. Possibly the longest power recovery in the game
---
Played a rank 20 game yesterday on PS4 I was a 16 lumped in with another 15 and then 2 20’s on my work account and this dude kept trying to peep on the Claudette working away on a gen and he kept getting broken out of his stalk and just kept trying to peep, little did he realize that me and another survivor were standing behind him eating popcorn and watching him lol!
---
Nope killer queue at 10 mins rn
---
wisest option really. but that doesnt stop them reporting your account. do the reports not count for anything then unless there is evidence?
---
Support ticket is your best way to I'd say.
---
you can tweet that at  [**@MCote\_BHVR**](https://twitter.com/MCote_BHVR)
---
Hammurabi's Code? I'd like to think we have philosophically come a long way in the four thousand years since that idea was developed.
---
Seance
---
this happened to me yesterday too but i was the one that took the escape cake because i havent gotten a single gateau from any bloodweb yet so far. it didn’t end up mattering because the killer was the sweatiest tunneling hag and i think i only ended up getting 40k blood points from the match total.
---
The masterbating fisherman
---
if you're having problems in EVERY game, then it probably is your internet connection
---
Takes me like 30 seconds to find a survivor lobby, but about 5-10 minutes as killer
---
It’s their own fault for going into a game with this bug, when you launch the game there can be a blue square instead of the camp fire in the main menu and if you go into a game when the blue square is there this bug will happen , obviously devs need to fix it but come on just restart your game.
---
You may end up needing to buy bubba because bbq has only ever been on the shrine twice.
---
I got into 2 survivor games like 2 hours ago fine, but now i am still waiting as we speak.
---
Interesting. Must not be a lot of players online
---
It is definitely not true.
---
I mean once I got in it filled fast , then a 300 ping player lagged out during loading so here I am back in queue
---
Currently with a friend on Survivor, can't get a game in.
---
You need to have him in the centre of your screen to consistently reveal him. Even in the corn it works
---
Tbh Jason is like THE slasher-killer. He would either be overpowerd af or really dissapointing.
---
Can’t wait for those dedicated servers.
---
Don't blame the killers, blame BHVR for being a blatantly incompetent company.
---
Free points and a liability against their own team that will ultimately lead to a shorter game?
---
sign me right up.
---
Though with freddy it's probably a joke.
---
Are u okay dude?
---
I would buy this in a heartbeat, I love it!!
---
Balanced landing gave you a very long run my friend, it was a fun chase!
---
You call this survivor Mike the Magician? You should look up Magic Mike.
---
Ive had tapps less than 5 meters away looking at me and not be able to pull me out of it, Ghost face is jank
---
It’s not every game, it was just this game. It’s been like 50 games since it last happened, was just curious if there was any way to play these games because I haven’t dc’d ever but I may start instead of wasting my time in a game like that
---
seriously how fucking rude?
---
Nah it's just taking advantage of opportunities..  just like the filthy blade users, the clown exploit.. and so on..
---
Looks like we're getting a survivor with the Ghostface chapter afterall 😎
---
Look at your emblems after every game.... you can get a 4K but because you camped you’ll just keep your current pip and rank. If you let survivors heal you’ll lose progression, etc etc
---
I love rewarding good plays, but my weakness is the goofballs. That Jake I mentioned kept jumping into lockers right around the corner (think he was too new to know rushed actions make noise) and not checking his surroundings. Can't feel good murdering that 😥
---
It happened again. Same kid. Whata joke dog haha
---
Read my first sentence. Not only is it hardly an incentive because of my own anecdotal experience, my point is that BOTH of our experiences are anecdotal and thus aren't incentives. No need to get insulting.
---
I don't get why would u DC against legion but not Doc, Plague, Pig. Legion is worse than Freddy. His power is nerfed to the ground, add-ons don't work, can be looped, as long as u have 2 windows he is never gonna catch u with frenzy and has 4 sec stun on frenzy.
---
Had to watch twice didn't see him the first time lol
---
&gt;I don't think merging Flip-Flop and Buckle Up makes sense since the effects are so different
---
Yeah but they're both related to slugging, except one helps you when you get slugged, the other is for helping others
---
Anything to give them a buff really
---
98 :)
---
OP already mentioned ruin so didn't think it was required to say it again.
---
True
---
Just DC. Lol on to the next
---
so like the disconnects, it can take up half a year? fuck this gammmeee sometimes.
---
Absolutely correct, you need evidence for them to take the report seriously and in the report log it’s a gruelling process to do on Playstation as it takes you to the browser app and you have to type in usernames and it asks you to give video links and photos etc and I believe (possibly incorrectly) BHVR can request to see chat logs. 
---
Downvoting the match and upvoting/reporting the game for the likes of unsportsmanlike etc I don’t believe does anything unless it’s on a HUGE report scale. I could be wrong there, I just made a big assumption.
---
I get so frustrated by the survivors who don't seem to get that you're trying to farm.  I end up just killing the whole lobby while yelling at them "I was just trying to be nice!" lol
---
Good idea, could be very annoying
---
One name: BLUEBEARD
---
Im partially new to dbd so if anyone has tips, throw em at me
---
hag is the next killer i plan on buying, dont have enough shards for her atm
---
I'm confused, have we met in game or is this a r/whoosh for me
---
Yup same, but sometime i play in private game with my friends....
---
I genuinely enjoy this idea, but I would actually let the entity block the gen and have the survivors play a little "stumble back" animation to get a lil jumpscare
---
You should try it out, friend 👀
---
Rank 11 Survivor and 13 killer
---
Yep i konw, but it didn't work for me. Even sometimes when he's leaning around a corner i can't reveal him while he is in the center of my screen.
---
I know. I hoped there would be memes about it.
---
Playing on Ultra. How to cap frame rate? I not found anything related in Options.
---
Same for R14 Survivors.  We're getting R6 killers or higher.
---
how did they get that many points then? if you don't interact with the killer you will not go over 20k points.
---
Yeah, I was thinking if the lit totem affecting the blocked generator isn't found in 90 seconds by those that worked on it, the aura of the totem would be revealed but I'm not sure if that would be too gimmicky. Depends on the map really
---
you can either DC before the game starts, go and let them kill you quickly or try to play it out
---
Yeah, it’s so sad when it happens
---
Haha, killing them with kindness xD
---
Literally!
---
I go through those phases with DBD, sometimes I just take a break for a bit.
---
I'd definitely rather just watch Tru3 suffer playing killer than suffering myself. If I start to get really toxic in my games I'll just watch some Hybridpanda to remind myself it's possible to play this game without being an asshole.
---
It's the only way you can use the flashlight most of the time
---
Flashlight saves only work against less experienced killers unless you have the timing of a god
---
They've changed the timings so many times too that most of the people who could do that every time have had to re learn
---
The perfect example of annoying and toxic member of this community, see yaa
---
Magician would be AMAZING
---
Pig=upvote
---
Let’s say
---
except not at every game? and they jsut had a public test ffs, to test for bugs, what the hell are they doing?
---
I spent the entire blood hunt trying to get Hex Ruin for ghostface :(
---
Pig=upvote.
---
Fuck this sub lol we're both at zero now lol
---
What's this from?
---
there's a problem with that design. killers will be able to hold the game hostage. there are many (actually most of them) totem spots that can be bodyblocked by the killer. killer could just do that at the start of the game and survivors won't be able to finish the objective at all, forcing them to either DC or wait for the killer to end this madness
---
"Flashlights are toxic and OP"
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
This isn't your average everyday humor, this is... advanced humor.
---
Bruh welcome to the dbd community
---
98%
---
I don't know luck offerings :|
---
Tbh his main one is is the 1 shot. If survivors know how to look or gen rush he can get rekt pretty hard. I do think he needs his detection range fixed s little though. I feel like I've seen people look at my from 3 feet and not break me out
---
Entitlement at it's finest.
---
Like ace would allow you to!
---
39 with my bubba
---
Umm there are loads - all of Kate's are not dirty at all. I see what you mean with the recolours of say, Jane's main skin, but other than that...
---
I was half asleep one game didn’t even kill a single survivor and still got 47 thousand lmao
---
It gets harder to rank up consistently because as you get higher the requirements for pipping go up too.  As killer part of it is extending the game length for the gate keeper emblem.
---
I think this is a bit much. It's just going to be this and Ruin that are gonna make it a bit one sided. At that point, you're requiring survivors to clear ALL totems on a map just to progress. It's even worse when you want it to lock on 90, not even closing the gen so that a survivor nor killer can touch it once they get off.. How much Killer do you play VS Survivor to not notice that's way too much pressure and exposure to the survivor versus  the level of brain dead work required by the killer to just run a bunch of Hex perks and freely chase for most of the game with no worries about gen progress.
---
Devs: Let's call him The Ghost
---
Fun World: RRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Devs: .....The Ghost Face?
---
Fun World: yes
---
Maybe you should wait the hotfix chenges
---
You need to know what area you can and can't make it to, you also have to know what the best way to run a jungle gym is. You have to know if there's a pallet there or not, you have to watch the killer to make sure you don't get mind gamed.
---
Just because it looks easy doesn't mean it is
---
It’s stupid Af I just want my double blood points
---
I dont have any good perks for him tbh, i have all the standard stuff since he was the first killer i played and leveled up twice in a row, so i have only his perks and the default ones, but i can tell you what i run, so i go with Unrelenting since if if i miss any attacks i can actually be able to recover faster and keep chasing since he's mostly a m1 killer, then i use noed, yes i know but on a m1 killer chasing someone good it's really hard so i get gen rushed and yeah, as my third perk i use shadowborn to see much easier, it's not really a necessary perk but i like it, and as my last perk i use bitter murmur aka budget bbq and chilli but i wouldn't recommend using this build if you have all the killers and all the perks unlocked since there are wait better perks for him. If i were to have all the perks on him i would use bbq and chilli, enduring, spirit fury, and noed.
---
Copyright most likely.
---
Absolutely. I didn't even think about the literal brokenness of that beyond mechanics.
---
Bless thy entity
---
They don't bring GPS because the other survivors bring escape cakes? Do they not want to find their way through the fog?
---
I’m loving all these dbd/always sunny memes I keep seeing in this subreddit. ❤️
---
Imagine the pirate having a blunderbuss with a 25% chance of stunning yourself with the malfunction
---
This MFer camped me on the pale rose basement at swamp, and jumped out from around the corner of the basement at the top of the stairs. When he got me I actually screamed
---
I see where your coming from with this especially if you're playing against Nurse and Billy all the time. Cleansing dull totems ain't that much of a time loss though. Maybe lower the activation to a much lower value like 50% so you can activate it and move to a different gen. The inconsistency of totem placements can be a problem.
---
To be fair we dont have a ninja killer either.
---
If you're on PC you can use MLGA to mark those killers and avoid them afterwards.
---
When you’re in a chase with the killer for more than 15 seconds you get a 7% speed boost for the duration of that chase, called “Jus Chillin N’ Killin’.”
---
90! Not sure if I can get the cells since I'm PS4 though
---
Ohhhhkay, that's what causes it.
---
Thanks; I was kinda worried that DBD would just randomly block the screen midgame.
---
If you walk right through a pallet, without getting stunned, and the pallet breaks would be broken. Yes, there is a limit to how many pallets you need to break, but spirit fury is still the same thing you said, just with a stun which is balanced. This perk would be unbalanced because its a spirit fury 2.0, survivors will complain then it will be changed like when Killer mains complained about MoM and it getting changed. If you have enduring, who cares if you get stunned, it's literally a 1 or .5 seconds of stun, that's perfectly fine LMFAO
---
&lt;3
---
Lorewise I imagine the answer would probably be the first 3
---
Indeed, it's not rocket science! lol
---
Im basically always the only one that uses this cake as an offering. I just always see thr escape cakes
---
My boy dwight's sounds of pain sound like he's yelling to the killer to put him down
---
Makes me miss her old voice it was like an angel. Anyways here's my upvote
---
To be fair though you really should go out of your way to break all of the dull totems as a survivor in case the killer is running NOED.
---
Haha seeing him right on the side of the screen before the down is scary as fuck lol.
---
Ok what am I missing? You missplayed, thats all lol
---
Spinechill is probably the best counter perk to him.
---
Alright thanks
---
You'd have to block three totems in order to do this. The other gens aren't affected.
---
Petition to make Captain Hook the nextt killer
---
I feel your pain....
---
Yes when it starts then you lose your stuff
---
Haha, yea ... being kind to total goofballs might keep them coming back to continue playing.
---
As large a community as possible is what's best for the game.
---
I was watching Panda's video when I saw a YT commenter talking about that. Now I realize lots of my games with multiple toolboxes and "wake ups" were so fast because of that. Luckily, after the first one I started to bring Franklin's Demise just to make them lose their items.
---
This is kinda worrying tho, people are straight up abusing it
---
Case-in-point: Friday the 13th the Game.
---
The super cakes stack?
---
For some reason, I get Zoidberg vibes from this. 
---
I like this. This is some wholesome vibes that’s usually much needed in this sub.
---
Its hard to detect him now, a hotfix is coming tho
---
I can see where you're coming from, it one of my favourites too, but i myself wouldn't tattoo it XD
---
When you join the lobby they show you the killer ping in the bottom right.  If it's just solid red, or flickering between red and yellow you should just drop the lobby before everyone readies up and try again.  If you mouse over it, it tells you the exact ping in that moment.
---
.ecneics dnoyeb si sihT
---
It makes your story pretty irrelevant.
---
I'll send them anyway
---
 
---
Thanks for this XD
---
Both are soooo good!  Wanna wreck?  Ghostface.  Want to scare some suckas.  The Pig!!!!
---
Go five more levels and get Hex: Devour Hobbits.
---
Looks sick bro!!
---
? It accidentally posted twice, whatchu gonna do? Sue me?
---
Very interesting. The mask especially seems awesome. Splendid work, dude!
---
Err a pirate would not fit in this game...
---
What horror films do you know that have a fucking pirate as the killer?
---
oh ok, gotcha. I forgot there are 7 gens on the map. good point.
---
To each their own then
---
This is the first I’ve heard of a survivor queue time being long killer obviously it’s a huge spam for BP and ghostface but if it’s both that’s more likely your connection at fault what’s your ping at usually when you do connect?
---
I got a 92 but no auric cells
---
Because it doesn't fit in the game theme..
---
Please, no more game slowing perk. Games are already far too boring for survivors with every killer bringing Ruin + Sloppy Butcher in all games. 
---
Don't you see that this hurts the game more than it helps? Soon playing survivor will become far too boring to enjoy and people will just slowly quit playing.
---
Impressive, worth your time and killing survivors.
---
I bought bubba for bbq 2 days before bbq came out in the shrine. That was when i wanted to die. Of course bbq pops up when i spend money on bubba. Fml.
---
When you b o t t o m  t e x t
---
A yes, I met a friendly Ghostface the other day I mean yeah he killed all my friends but he would always teabag back and let me escape
---
I'm relatively new to the game but I've been watching vids from a guy called ohmwrecker, his lighthearted commentary while playin is entertaining. 
---
I know truetalent from back when he was more fighting  game orientated he seems to be doin pretty well from this game.
---
*Laughs in hag*
---
Looks dope
---
No, maybe the totem is deactivated after 30 seconds, and the killer gets a visual notification goes off on the gen that at 90%
---
? Why is this even on reddit? Its just bbq n chili with a survivor pudding, lol
---
*Wraith quietly crying in Bloodhound*
---
I heard that the ghost translate to the spirit in other countries. IDK if that had an effect on it in the US/UK.
---
How do you work this one out? Dying half way through every match?
---
Yeah, its still a great tattoo though
---
Aye, even the grey ones have a pretty high chance to spawn a cake.
---
This is one of the funniest dbd memes I've seen so far.
---
I'd be down for Thresh or Nautilus too
---
Yeet
---
Bbq in a level 3 blood web? This is front page worthy stuff.
---
*Laughs in Farm*. I'm glad you are considerate of the feedback. If the totems were a bit more trackable, I'm sure it wouldn't be as bad.
---
Because it’s lucky
---
A Flying Dutchman would make a great killer I think :p
---
I'm kinda new but have noticed the matchmaking while playing killer takes considerably longer. Is this a common thing?
---
While I agree her addon is useless she does have about 4 other good ones. And do you think it would help new players because I tried using the flannel when I started learning and it seems to thrown off my release timing so I just practiced regular muscle memory and distance. Sounds harder but for some reason it’s easier for me.
---
No, you cant buy Pig with shards
---
You start with it if u go to customize you can change
---
P3 is pretty shiney though, it's not just a black piece of clothing
---
Thresh!
---
EDT?
---
I've tried with David on his original outfit and it works. Sometimes. Depends on lighting haha
---
me after a couple bad games.
---
Ah, I’m bloody David so that might help.
---
If that’s true then MoM shouldn’t require 3 hits. Most killers will just go after the player who blocked a hit
---
I kinda like it, I'm using since my billy isn't level 30 yet
---
All I'm saying is it wouldn't hurt to search for other people having a similar problem first would it not?
---
I see your point; I didn’t take this into account when I created this, because I got the game for free (PS Plus game of the month). It would give an edge to older players, as they would have all the perks much quicker.
---
If you would play survivor you would actually know we barely get any cakes
---
Yea I know they are very different just pointing out the difficulty in those types of weapons being put into the game even for a large team working on it
---
I'm having just about the exact same experience. Last night i went through at least 7 bloodwebs and only got 1 fucking gruesome gateau, and that was from a mystery box. 
---
however, i am getting one of those celebratory fireworks in every bloodweb, in the exact same fucking spot. and i've got 7 of those. one for every bloodweb i went through last night.
---
True, true, and mind games
---
Why stress when you can spectate instead?
---
And what exactly about every other Killer we have in the game current is the theme?
---
I’ve unlocked multiple gateaux on various killers and literally zero on any of my survivors, just those stupid firecrackers. Can’t use an offering I don’t have.
---
Well most of my ghostface games have been going my way but once it got latter in the day I started seeing a lot of people run Wake up almost everyone I’ve seen have been running it
---
Big THONK
---
I’ve only gotten one cake every three to four bloodwebs.
---
But if everyone plays survivor, who will play killer?
---
Yeah that's fair. I can't see a hook being easy to implement in any game engine tbf
---
No problem

What is the default range that a survivor can break your stalk?
---
It's probably because the killer (who controls the situation) was dissatisfied with your cooperation. Matches like these, you either DC or farm, but if you don't immediately come to suck the killer's dick when it's apparent it's a farm match, you will be hunted down and the game will not continue until you are dead, they won't complete gens or help you. 
---
"When I try to join in and the killer stops farming and tunnels me" that means you weren't joining in, if the killer has to run and chase you, he's going to stop playing nice. 
---
I know this.... because.... because I do this as a killer.

Yea, if these add ons reduce distance to 0. We not complaining we can't expose him from the other side of the map, we can't expose him when he is right in our face.
---
Did this with Dance With Me &amp; Monitor...
---
I don’t want it to turn into a Pay to win scenario, but after reading some of the comments and their thoughts it would probably turn into that. 
---
I disagree completely with lootboxes and pay to win games, and actively hope that DBD never becomes that. I just wish for some of the starting grinding was eased somehow for newer players.
---
Five Nights at Freddys crossover?
---
I just want Jason
---
Lunch Lady from Hack/Slash?
---
Obviously. Its a 1v4 4 times as many people need to be a survivor than a killer to start a game.
---
Bubba always wanted a shrimp business.
---
Love if you were more specific
---
The furthest ive been exposed from is from the cornfield gen, to the haddon field house, so id guess around 32 meters
---
DEUS VULT
---
You are indeed a dick. A game where the grind has never been grinder and people are just doing some honest work to get by, and feed their family. And you report them for something that could be consider illegitimate gains, but really, come on. People gotta live, man.
---
I meant to say the chase music it's way too low

---
Lmfao on god
---
Well trapper is very simple and helps you learn maps, billy takes a few games to get used to and has a learning curve but he is probably the easiest of the a tier killers to learn.
---
if that's the case then yeah okay justifiable. I didn't watch his stream for long because I can't stand him so I could be wrong.
---
It does really seem like it has to be already planned and started before a release or they put anything new into the game. Can’t imagine having to try place something pretty technical into a rather delicate set up without breaking anything else
---
I fully approve of this for Ardi
---
Cause you're gonna max out boldness anyway without it
---
Ah that's a bug because the audio breaks every patch
---
Which mask is that?
---
¿ʎsɐʇuɐɟ ɐ pɐǝʇsuᴉ ʇnq 'ǝɟᴉl lɐǝɹ ʇ,usᴉ sᴉɥʇ uɐǝɯ ʇɐɥʇ sǝop
---
It's definitely a bug and I believe they'll probably ban people for it sooner or later
---
Okay, thanks! Do you have any tips for playing as either of them?
---
Also ghost face has that leatherly sound effect that makes it extra special.
---
Had a GF do a whole leather symphony infront of my hook at the end of the match... not Bm just because he loves the sound.
---
how much is it for you?
---
No those are animatronics. I meant a living human being in a dumb but scary costume. Think of someone like Slappy from Dead Rising or Billy from Silent Hill.
---
Truth! I've been betrayed so many times! I go in there and offer my unhooks, followed by some friendly teabagging and added with a We'll Make It quality healing to a Claudette, only to feel not worthy to be saved.
---
I have played like 20 games against Ghostface and I couldn't say I find him tough to play against but I'm also quite good at this game, but when I've played against REALLY good killers it was freaking hard because you don't know where he could be due to the crouching and he can down you in one hit if you are not careful
---
Depends on what killer you play
---
I thought the entity just took rage filled people or just plain nasty evil folks.
---
Still don't see how wraith fits the killers though.
---
Or priestess, didn't she just want to help people. How did she end up spitting stuff at people.
---
A Greek warrior that was once glorified and then captured and tortured could have a reason to want to relive their glory days.
---
Something like a desperation or plea to a god that fell on death ears but the entity answered instead.
---
So a mix of Spirit and Plague's back stories.
---
Maybe he slaughtered the captors. Idunno. Tons to go off from.
---
Oh thank god... I hope they fix it soon because it's just not enjoyable imo
---
Just do all the normal antiBBQ stuff. Distortion, lockers, and hiding behind gens.
---
But Discordance is a whole nother story. That is great perk to run on this guy
---
I was in a game where a Kate kept running away while the killer and the rest of us were in the "slash, down, hook, unhook, heal, repeat" phase of the farm; she was eventually bloodlusted &amp; sacrificed at the end...I totally get being cheesed by that.
---
The Scary Movie clips are the best part about Ghostface being added
---
Hell I’d watch Halloween 100 times.
---
Breaking through walls/windows could be his thing, it would leave a permanent hole for loops to end.
---
Survey link
---
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/dbd_exam
---
Leatherface, totally worth his price and it's the lowest for a DLC.
---
He's great against other newbies, and he starts with the best killer perk in the game, BBQ and chili.  In dead by daylight the goal of leveling up isn't just to customize your killers and survivors, it also unlocks 3 unique teachable perks that after unlocking at level 30, 35 and 40, can now appear in other killers/survivor's blood webs as you level them up.
---
You want to get bbq and chili unlocked as early as possible because after you hook each survivor once you get 100% more blood points for the round, so basically double experience for every killer game if you hook each survivor once.
---
This game has a killer (hah) grind, but BBQ and chili makes it a little more tolerable.
---
It's not underrated. It's garbage. It can be good only on Nurse.
---
#FBI OPEN UP!!!!
---
Ya someone in chat told him about the bug so he jumped right on a gen and could see it was indeed a bug so he went to shack and vaulted the window 4 or 5 times and verified it worked on vaulting then took a hit to see if bandaging worked, etc, etc.. then let the killer kill him to he could test wiggle timer, kobe timer, etc. He then tried a few other perks to see if they were bugged too like Resilience. 
---
He didnt use it for personal gain even once.
---
Myers
---
I play brown Claudette on PS4 but I'm immersive only when killer is near. I found out that I do gens quickest when I'm not being chased
---
You need ruin on or else ghost face is the easiest gen rush ever. Maybe it’s just against green ranks but that’s what I’ve noticed.
---
You need to censor the name.
---
Besides,  this guy is pretty tame from what I see. you need to grow a thicker skin if you want to play this game. We all have been told far worse stuff. Just to mention a kinda similar case, I was called a trash killer for using NOED, eventough I killed that guy before the hatch was open.
---
Definitely buy a house
---
I would like a character who is both survivor and killer. A good example i think I think could have been was Amanda Young as she was both Jigsaws apprentice but also had to survive the killing game twice.
---
I loved this show
---
I would mainly be stoked about a vampire character if you were able to fly and swoop down on people.
---
Yeah, there's a scumbag out there, and it appears to be you. We all know that NOED and Ruin are the strongest killer perks. We get it. We don't need you to act like an internet tough guy. He didn't throw salt, he didn't take your bait, just leave the guy alone.
---
Do they have to be good builds?  Or does just fun count?
---
Flip Flop, Unbreakable, Tenacity and Boil Over.  Make the trip to the hook as obnoxious as possible.
---
If you don’t want to receive any salty messages, then change your settings. Stop trying to send out a witch hunt &amp; grow up.
---
A small chucky would give this game more variety.
---
that's exactly what I was thinking
---
I love it but Trappy boi has so many good cosmetics I hope another killer gets some
---
how do i know what i got . it got through an error and when i got back it said you already took the survey
---
The support person claimed i had "altered game files" but what file or how i "supposedly" did it or how it affected the game i couldn't get out of him. Belive me when i say i'm too stupid to hack xD and besides i have 1200 hours in the game and bought every dlc have a look if you want. Thanks for replying  [https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156564657/](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156564657/)
---
Possibly, doesn't he meantion lots of potatoes in his vids (hence this guys name).
---
A survivor from the past would be super cool.
---
I don't agree with using Wake Up exploit, but iri head and moried are too OP, basically Easy Mode: On for killer. So I don't agree with that guy's rhetoric, bot those are still bullshit.
---
I guess. It's just that billy or wraith and while wraith is fun and easy hes just not good.  Trapper can be very good depending on the map. Also we are not going to talk about giving nurse or huntress to a noob. God I almost quit when I tried to learn huntress. I finally got good with her though and she is the most fun imho. I was just trying not to recommend anyone that is a flat out bad killer once he gets good like freddy or doc who are both easy and good against noobs but dont make it out of rank 15
---
Thank you. I appreciate it. You as well. I try to be what I'd want to go against in these situations. I'm only toxic if someone is being a dickhead. Someone tbagged before all their downs on my first game as bubba so I was trash. I was nice at first but like fuck off. I camped proxy camped my ass off and ended up killing the second to last person too. I messaged him apologizing and told him she tbagged and the guy was like yeah it's alright fuck tbagging. It was cool shit so I think being a dick after they are a dick is okay.
---
Have to balance after all the complaining I hear about mom.
---
Not at all or could work for the killer in see no evil
---
Also may I ask console or pc?
---
you could go ruin instead of enduring that work very well too, or take out noed and have surveillence and ruin
---
Killers tunneling in the double bp event after waiting for 30 minutes be like
---
I feel he is only unfun because of how buggy it is and how much stupid stuff he can get away with like just popping in and out of cover to keep his ability. I really hope the hotfix fixes him even though people say it's a nerf I see it as a fix to his ability and this is coming from someone that's been playing Ghostface all day
---
Haha you were quick to retract your shit once everyone didn’t jump on your band wagon, huh? Gotta love followers and sheep.
---
The Demonic Locker Goblin.
---
Gotta be dwight though for lore reasons.
---
Head On, Quick and Quiet, Dance With me, Adrenaline/SelfCare/Bone/whatever.
---
Break line of sight to hop into a locker mid chase, it's silent with quick and quiet, wait until the killer gets close and burst out with a fresh pizza and a stun.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
I knew it! Thank you so much man for taking your time\~!
---
I'll be waiting. For now, I'll just stop playing for a bit cuz I was grinding a lot these days\~
---
Again, thank you, good games for ya!
---
xampx602 throw me an add bro.
---
I know. And it's like this is the most babies in a community I've seen. I'm relatively new to this game but I've never had this much bs and hating on opposing sides. Even fortnite and call of duty don't complain as much for zero reason.
---
I’m on PS4
---
I remember when I was a baby myers and was like "hey free stalk" when I saw the survivors milking those bulbs. I stalked but than though that I should leave them because they were trying to get their cosmetics and I wouldn't want to be treated in that sort of way.
---
Ye most of my friends that play this game are lgbtq, but idk. The cosmetics would be cool though.
---
Do you have custom Icons?
---
you might be disappointed that I'm not a bro, but a dudette lol
---
he is OP
---
Legion has vague ties to Scream.
---
I’m still disappointed we don’t have Shorty as a surgivor
---
Ya I haven't played survivor against him yet so I can't say myself if I think it's hard to knock him out or not just been what I'm hearing. I will say though I just got out of a game where these survivors had 0 issue so maybe most people aren't keeping him in the center and are trying to just glance in his direction
---
I had the exact same mask when I was a little kid. God I remember I scared so many people when I pressed the heart and blood just poured down the mask haha.
---
If his map was a huge Galleon floating in the middle of the ocean with multiple decks, then yes. I dont want to get chased through the swamp or Junker's by a silly pirate captain, however.
---
If you end games quickly this will be true, but if you are in a strong position during a game, it's easier to get near the 32,000 on killer. Even the good games rarely see survivors go over 25,000. If everyone is doing their job, there won't be enough objectives/altruism points for everyone to score high. If the game go south, you also won't score high.  
---
Between the higher base score, BBQ, and an increased number of Gateaus (since killers can't roll firecrackers in the bloodweb), I would say killers are doing all right at the moment.
---
It is terrible but gives bloodpoints so everyone overhypes it.
---
Just in case you didn't know, you can look behind you while working on a generator.
---
i didn't have one but my brother did
---
94. Got a Myers question wrong and he's my main. How embarrassing. :(
---
You like?
---
It's the age groups I think.  I'm over 30 so I was taught to play fair and not expect everyone to hand me everything.
---
yh i know i was just in the zone i think
---
Just grabbed ghost face and tried to actually play the game after a long break, only to sit in a lobby for 30 minutes with it filling to 3 people and then just rotating those survivors out constantly till no one wanted to stay...     
---
Yea, think i'll continue that break from the game.
---
Huntress rework be like
---
Ladies and gentleman, get around
---
someone thinks he is being funny for the 71st time on the internet \\\[T\]/
---
Im not talking about the long queue times to find survivors, im talking about the long queue time to even get into the queue to find survivors
---
Mine was being asleep or trying to be.
---
Fuck night shift.
---
in game store doesn't give you that skin
---
Watch Ardetha, he's probably the best nurse in DBD.
---
The entity is generous with me i guess, lol
---
They are made of "gatos".
---
This is art
---
Entity: Yoink.
---
I haven't seen anyone getting banned for it. you should be able to ask EAC for an unban if that happens
---
But the devs should be able to see that i got them legit, you can check my profile and see my achievments for prestige and when i bought the game.
---
Someone has said that to scare you, if you were genuinely not helping I wouldn’t worry. :)
---
Get used to meat hooks ,bad blood webs, &amp; heartbeats
---
So true ffs
---
p
---
Lag switching in the middle of doubling back seems unlikely to me. This guy probably has bad internet, and as a result thinks that mind-gaming will always eventually work, even when the survivor can see him.
---
The Hag is already kind of a take on a Wendigo with her appearance and all of the cannibalism in her lore.
---
actually, not funny, helpful. use the fucking search option. Also, it's not the 71st time, it's the 172nd time, because here are stats I gathered 
---
"killer lobbies long" - 71 times
---
Dead by Daylight ended up doing a Free Play Days only a couple of months later in September. I spent the whole weekend playing it and immediately bought it when time was up. Haven’t looked back since.
---
and it would take the same amount of time if the lobby was made right away. why? because it doesn't make a lobby until it finds people to play with.
---
It's just awful search times
---
Yes. I agree whole heartily
---
Try running Huntress Lullaby with it and unnerving. Ik this has nothing to do with ur post but try the impossible skill check build. Unnerving, Distressing, Huntress Lullaby and Overcharge. Some ppl say ruin but if u do that then they will hunt for ur totem. As for lullaby they will ignore it at the start and usually not try to find it til about 2-3 hooks. Even then tho u can patrol it every so often
---
Try using the add on combination I suggested, and if you have them, the perks too.
---
I do feel like the range extenders are a must have, even the brown one adds a lot of range for a negligible amount of extra wind up.
---
But I’ve waited over an hour before
---
I mean I'm going to blame both BHVR and the killers. It's not hard to take advantage and abuse a bug as killer but that doesn't mean you should.
---
That's just how they are there awful
---
thats everyone these past days 
---
bloodhunt + new killer has everyone playin killer
---
It's all really guess work at this point, but I'd assume just from experience and how BHVR normally makes things work that it's somewhere between ~32-48 meters by default.
---
That's because you're straight
---
This subreddit has a fetish for calling everything a lagswitch. This was a bug. If it were a lagswitch, Claudette's position would not have been consistent while it was activated, and she would have teleported to wherever she was on the Killer's screen when disabled.
---
You can also see the Ghostface's model physically stutter back to the real position, again, something that wouldn't happen with a lagswitch.
---

---
An idea for a killer I did ages ago, feel free to check it out.
---
Meg has a rainbow jacket in the charity cosmetic DLC IIRC
---
Maybe his shift key was broken.
---
Honestly...the devs will ban for dumb things like people saying they hacked and they didnt. People get banned for lag switching and numerous others. I would try them again and ask for explanation again.
---
One addition, you can double or tripple back on very short loops too. Usually survivors try to use those to stun you and run to a safer loop, so they usually play those loops very bold, knowing they get hit if they screw it up. Knowing this, if you can play it right, you can get a hit here before they throw the pallet, either keeping it for you later for more mindgames, or hitting you with the pallet after you did hit them (which either "only" wastes the pallet or you have enduring and it resets your attack animation, allowing you to potentially continue the mindgame o catch up)
---
That's actually what I saved this file as; yatadbd.jpeg
---
FYI there is a known bug in the lobby where you get stuck at only 3 survivors. You just have to leave and reset the lobby. I don't blame you for walking away from the game though.
---
This is what happens when you give a guy an insta-down + built-in insidious.
---
Best bet probably 99 last gen and wait for the other person to die
---
ok... why did you reply to me and not to the post instead?
---
Are you looking at the flair?
---
killer has to not kick the hatch down
---
what? thats a dumb Statement.
---
Like I said, I know many gay, etc. People in those other 2 games, just never encountered any in dbd
---
Lmao never thought I’d hear someone call BBQ terrible. Why do you think it is?
---
i put this under salt/rant because CHANGE THEM BACK TO BLACK!!!! THEY LOOKED WAY BETTER!!!!! REEEEEEEEE!!!!!

Is this from an actual anime or something
---
 Ladies and gentleman, get around
---
someone has posted this for the 72st time since the last patch \\\[T\]/
---
​
---
double bloodpoints + new killer = everyone wants to play as killer = no survivors to play with = long queue times
---
also, people don't want to play during the event cuz the match quality is terrible.
---
the game starts a lobby once it finds people for you to play with, so if you made a lobby straight away it would take just as long to find people to play with
---
Oh.... Oops...
---
I honestly prefer the leaked version.

Auric cells, I didn’t think that would make a difference, though
---
I haven't bought him and I tend to get at least one 'thank you for not playing ghostface' messages per trial
---
Everyone disliked that.
---
Doctor can also end chases super fast since his shock can stop survivors from vaulting.
---
No
---
Farming sucks.
---
Every time I succeed in creating a lobby its empty so I doubt that being true.

do you keep these lists on your notes and wait for the right time to spill
---
someone has posted this for the 73st time since the last patch \\\[T\]/

Nah bud that teabag was just you being toxic. Hes camping cus its endgame. He has 1 objective and that's kill you guys. End game is the only acceptable time to camp. Before that sure he is a cunt for face camping but cmon what the fuck is he supposed to do here?
---
Shortest game of my life, all gens gone 3 minutes... I waited 15 mins for this stupid lobby...
---
After reading your comments the only thing I can think of is 
---
OOFFF, probably will take ages to get it now :'D
---
Thank you for the quick responses
---
Thanks
---
cuz they are joining it.
---
Why would we want to kill pirates?
---
I've seen one run around, slash at nothing and check all the lockers while teammates were on the other side of the map. It's me you dummy
---
Legion does have map control and molbity though? They have tracking from the killer insinct, their power can get them a good ways around the map quickly, Deep Wounds forcers survivors to waste a little bit a time, and to heal since it injuries them. 
---
Sure its not amzaing, but they do have it.
---
I tried this and got teabagged at the exit gate. Directions were unclear and/or did not work as described, I demand a refund.
---
damn good timing
---
Me and the gf were just talking about this the other day! 
---
We thought of a killer in a deep diver suit who has a slow movement speed but can use a harpoon gun to pull survivors close a la scorpion from Mortal Kombat
---
If you have to crutch on a bug you're boosted trash, plain and simple.
---
It's abuse of a bug, unfortunate but we need to wait for the fix.
---
I do not understand why you are being so worked up about this. this doesn't add anything helpful to my situation
---
I mean it isnt shitty though. At this point the survivor should have plenty of points from other activities. Just because you personally died doesnt mean the killer wins. 1k is a bad game. Especially if you only got it right at the end.
---
Buying? She's free on ps4, i didn't realise you have to buy her on pc. Is it the same case with Ace?
---
&gt;Imagine if they just decided to put a standard warrior in there or a standard pirate. You just have a knight in armour running around slashing at people as if it is For Honour. Or a 'traditional' pirate that is usually comically drawn up (peg leg and a hook) going round. it doesn't have the same vibe.
---
The idea isn't of a traditional warrior that's good or doing it for honour. It's the gladiator ideology that festers and turns one from an entertainment killer to a murderer.
---
If a child grew up only knowing bloodshed, they could break and mindless enough for the entity to get them... Otherwise its the broken man psychology
---
Where he who only kills winds up killing those he didn't mean due to a broken psychosis and wants escape could also fall into the entity's arms.
---
Plus visually, the entity can transform them however it wants. Nurse was a loving mother and nurse which snapped and now is this floating faceless ghost.
---
Spirit was a schoolgirl that now is torn to pieces and crackles around...
---
Wraith's face got twisted into... That mourning executioner look...
---
Entity has a very good wardrobe selection.
---
Well fi you already plan on that, try obtaining the perk "Window of opportunity" from Kate, is a good training wheels perk that will let you see the auras of pallets and windows so you cans tart mapping them in your head after using it for a while.
---
I should try alert but yes on the spine chill, I feel so blind in a match without it and it's been a big help for when I know he's stalking me
---
Once tried with shirtless david. Legitimately got tunneled cuz i had a easier to see skin. He said he thought i was the best cuz my skin. I barely play survivor too lol. Sad times.
---
I don't get chase music over half the time
---
probably because of the "changed darker cosmetics to lighter ones" thing they did
---
Can't wait to see it in the shrine several weeks ago...?
---
If you buy the dlc, you wont get the splinter for that killer. Buying the killers individually will still reward a splinter for them very very rarely. It's not that big of a deal.
---
What dont you understand about it took the devs weeks to react to the legion its gonna take more than 36 hours for them to react to this?  It might be another week it might be another day but they will eventually react in a similar manner because its basically the same offense. either way shut the fuck up and be patient just like the survivor mains had to put up with the bullshit for multiple weeks killer mains might have to put up with this for more than a day and a half.   Idk how you dont think thats the same thing. Legion had been out for longer but its not like the devs jumped up and started banning right away.
---
I’d say legion is similar level to Leatherface. Legion touches upon multiple elements of the game sure but none very well. Slows game down sure, but not that significantly. Good mobility, but if your going to use his power for mobility it won’t be there for the chase. Good tracking sure but nothing groundbreaking. He’s an okay all round killer but brings nothing special to the game.
---
Ghostface. They both kinda have the same instadown properties, but since survivors dont clense plague gets nothing else. 
---
Ghostface meanwhile has the stealth and some minor tracking to his power. 
---
Plague has the instadown and sightly better tracking. 
---
Clensing survivors though, plague is better. Getting a better huntress power, game slow down, and bettter tracking.
---
ghostface because It's not the plag
---
Just down them again and bite the stun if they want to use it that way or slug them both and bite the stun off of one and down them again.
---
It's annoying but not that big of a deal.

Here are some potential mechanics from when I suggested this 9 months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9gpvzv/suggestion_the_captain_killer_idea/
---
they take 15min to join me? :O
---
yes, thats right, the real waiting begins when im actually in the lobby.
---
Plus after the lobby is created I also come up on [https://dbd.onteh.net.au/](https://dbd.onteh.net.au/) . Not when I, searching for a match
---
I was so pumped for this game when it was in Beta for PC. I’d watch streams/YouTube plays of it getting excited about its release, only to realize it wouldn’t come to console. Despite being dejected, I’d occasionally watch gameplay after release and wish I could play.  However, I didn’t really follow it after that though. 
---
Enter Friday the 13th on all platforms. I shifted focus to that and got really excited. It seemed like similar enough gameplay featuring an absolute (~~)unit(~~) iconic boogeyman.  I was thrilled when it came out. Bought it for a friend and myself, and was ready to sink a ton of hours into it.  Then it didn’t work at launch. The devs went on vacation and left it fester for a week. I was so disappointed. When I finally got to play... oh boy. What an absolute mess of a game. Bugs galore in addition to broken matchmaking and all around stale gameplay. I tried to power through. I really did. 
---
Once I decided I had enough, I noticed something on my Xbox. Dead by Daylight was coming in two day. I freaked the fuck out and preordered as quickly as I saw the notice.  I couldn’t believe I hadn’t even heard about it being ported.  I did something I hadn’t done in a long time on release day. Played the whole day. I think I ate a snack, once. I was hooked. 
---
Two years later, I’m still logging on. Sometimes an hour at a time. Sometimes 10. I’ll go a month without playing, but I’m always drawn back in. Even though you hear a lot of negativity (and I’m not saying it’s not always warranted), overall, this game including the devs and community, have been an overwhelming joy. I can’t wait to see where the game goes from here.
---
Shirtless David is awesome, but it’s like throwing a spotlight on yourself in a dark room

Man this Enduring nerf is too much
---
GF
---
I've never even seen anyone play Plague.   I've seen all the other killers, never even once have I seen Plague.
---
Since no one plays her I take that as a hint that she's just not fun to play as.
---
Even once the GF rush is over I expect people to keep playing him as he seems genuinely fun to play. 
---
Plague?  I wouldn't know.
---
You momster
---
Yeah that too. Terror radius and chase audio is very low but all other audio is at normal volume.
---
Is this what you do when you don't get your way? You come crying to reddit?
---
Beautiful
---
I guess I should stop playing for a while... :) just to keep my sanity

Fuck, dude, that lean teabag got me so good lmao
---
Very stressful.VERY VERY VERY
---
I wanna get that skin with the cool mustache cuz it looks too good with his pecs out in all glory lol.
---
Nah, play as survivor instead.
---
Just don't abuse the same bug.

but he has a huge bright red parachute bag, it doesn't make sense for dwight's cosmetic
---
ye ofc, I called u out. if u get annoyed by me just ignore the post instead of leaving a passive aggressive comment.
---
the only one I noticed is that I can hear the huntress wind up her hatchets across the map and it's not good for my mental health
---
Plague. She’s either a better Huntress or has Noed for the entire game.
---
Playing the game is sometimes just a fucking nuisance/frustrating mess.
---
I’d love to go play Survivor, but I don’t want to be tilted/salty when we all get hooked twice with no Gens done.
---
I’d love to go play Killer, but I don’t want to be teabagged/Looped/Firecracker’d for an eternity and be insulted in PostGame chat.
---
1. game looks for people to play with
---
2. game creates a lobby
---
3. game gives you people it found
---
4. game looks for more people if someone disconnected
---
that's how it works
---
He flipped his monitor and then started typing
---
I actually think I have that same mask up in my attic
---
Yup, I dont have a need to play this game on speed hacks :D
---
Hag is A tier.Way better than all B killers.
---
Literally half the killers I’ve played against brought ebony moris this week
---
Literally the same thing happened to me with a extremely toxic survivor with 4 offerings on the line. I can easily get 32k points as a killer right now, farming is a opportunity for the survivors to make more points, not for me as a killer. If you don't want to farm, I can run you around a bit so that you can have fun, but please don't teabag every single safe pallet, esp with 3 Jungle Gyms around the killer shack. And please don't be toxic in the end game chat, esp if 2 other survivors did take the offer of farming.
---
More people have been asking for Sidney, this is the first time I've seen someone ask for Brenda from Scary Movie.
---
That's toxic &gt;:(
---
nah
---
The Flying Dutchman
---
source?
---
&gt;It's like they wouldn't dare make a perk that actually impacts the killer
---
\&gt; Loop pallet/window 3 times for a free gen
---
\&gt; Decisive Strike when caught
---
\&gt; Dead Hard for another free series of loops
---
\&gt; Get hooked or downed, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, etc
---
Yeah just no perks for survivors really, that's why everyone runs the same hugely impactful ones every game!
---
No problemo
---
I thought they didn't stack... Did they forget to add the unstackable downside? Some of his addons have it...
---
Xbox is the same

So we're screwed for the raffle since entrance is only for the first hour, right?

stop plugging

Insta-heals and wake up abuse

I’m so sorry for what you had to go through
---
And Leather-face has none of that? He has NO map mobility, 0 game slowdown, 0 tracking, 0 chase potential, 0 stealth. 
---
Legion has, Map molbity, some slowdown, some tracking, some chase. 
---
Legion has elements that make them at least better then leatherface in every way.

as a survivor you don't even have to think about what you're doing. as a killer you are constantly getting punished for your mistakes with wasted time on your 3 minute clock to end the game

---
I know right. Had a couple of those during the weekend. Went to the other survivors, indicated that if they wanted to farm since there were still 5 gens left it would be ok. If they wanted to we farmed and id they didnt i killed them.
---
Its sucks even more to the killer tho since we need to wait for ages.
---
Legion and Ghostface are the two "suburban gothic" killers. Seeming normal by day but are actually psychopaths.
---
Ah well it wasn't me then friend, I play PC only, oof
---
I won't look for it cuz you don't want to believe me even tho you see it in action all the time

Whats the bug

Yup. I'm also having this weird glitch where I can't wiggle in killers grasp

Ah yes.Survivor easy and Op.Killer hard and underpowered.

I'm not calling survivors op. I'm just telling that as a killer you are on your own, with a 3rd person camera, being chased by a timer. as a survivor you see everything, have time to fool around and 3 other people that can get the job done for you

if you spam the mori option as killer

The survivor point of view makes it look like ghostface is mounting you

the survivor even makes a gasp noise makes it hell arousing
---
Pocket hex
---
I'm not angry at all, but I think exploiting a major bug and encouraging others to do so ruins the game experience for the killer.  
---
Was it fun playing against double knife infinite legion?  Was the Franks Mixtape moonwalk shuffle cool?
---
Because there will always be shallow people who like to act like assholes which they are. Toxicity isnt going to go away. A shame but it is what it is.
---
 Fist of all Noed has counterplay, im assuming you just don't break the totems. If you're have trouble finding them, use small game.
---
Secondly i was correcting the misinformation you were saying about the game being "killer sided". Look on how the gameplay was in the past versions of DBD and tell me that aint survivor sided.  Based on your past comment you are very one sided, you might play both sides but that doesn't mean you understand both sides well enough. 
---
You're only half right about MoM, some killers can use there power to bypass the perk but all M1 killers are basically punished by MoM for just doing thier objective thats why its getting reworked for good reason not just that your crying about the pc majority crying about it.
---
The only "asshole" here is you.
---
my job is rewriting stuff from documents to pc files
---
60 seconds, in my opinion, is too long for decisive for to be considered an anti-tunneling perk. It's in a good place now don't get me wrong, but I feel as if the timer should be reduced. There have been plenty of times that I down an unhook halfway across the map AND hook their rescuer only to get ds'd right to the face by the unhook lol
---
uploaded video footage of it, got deleted in seconds. NICE JOB BHVR
---
Yes but he is a specialist at ending chases fast and knocking down multiple survivors instantly. Legion isn’t a specialist in anything. Legion is an all round killer whilst Leatherface specialises in a certain aspect of the game. I don’t like either killers that’s why there d tier. Playable but you tend to get bullied using them at higher ranks. (Leather face doesn’t have chase potential? What? He can Insta down you and destroy pallets fast)
---
&gt;I found out that I do gens quickest when I'm not being chased
---
Lmao this got to me more than it should have.
---
Is that why I keep getting snuck up on????
---
I’m using Premonition and it’ll trigger with no heartbeat, so I think I’m fine, until suddenly it gets intense at the last second and suddenly I’m smacked off a Gen by a fucking Trapper.

Good thing I've haven't had to go through this yet but Everytime I see a Quentin I bring a Mori just for them

Imo he would be fine if the reveal mechanic wasn’t so iffy about when it actually works

someone has posted this for the 20th time since the last patch \\\[T\]/
---
People were complaining that chase music makes them unable to hear important sounds so instead of giving us an option to adjust it, devs fucked it all up
---
It’s meant to give a 15% bonus to opening exit gates. However at the moment it gives a 15% bonus to pretty much everything, healing, cleansing, unhooking, and yes even repairing generators. It’s like having a permanent toolbox.
---
I can’t keep up with all these new Pokémon anymore..
---
some people prefer to watch other people play games.
---
yeah i dont have the game either, i just been watching dbd content for like 2 years now. i really want to play it. maybe i will be able to play it on mobile, who knows
---
Lol take it as you will, did i have fun playing against legion bug's?  
---
yes, it was
---
Me too unless it's single-player, I always wanna explore everything on my own
---
that can also happen, but you don't interact with them directly in most matches. they are running around doing their own business. the only real interactions are healing and waking up, which most people do on their own anyway
---
Could be tinkerer, but yeah, the audio currently seems extremely bugged. Played another game and it was fine. It seems to be completely random if you get butchered or good sounds
---
The answer is obviously play a killer not equipped for it.
---
At least he had the courtesy to not take you to the basement
---
That's what it says so I assume so yeah.
---
Leatherface can also just get stunned by a wall for SIX seconds. Hes also slower while chaging the chain saw and be kited. 
---
Leatherface is only good at camping, because its too easy to avoid  his chainsaw. 
---
Being a jack of all trades is being better then being rather bad. 
---
sure he can instadown you and break pallets...if he can hit you.
---
I think OP is a britbong
---
That has a 3 second charge up, makes him move at about 330% movespeed, and has 0 cooldown if he does miss.
---
:D yeah, they for sure deserved the cake (which I ran out of :D)
---
Interesting of true. Wonder if being headless is considered decapitation.
---
pro player talking here boys n girls
---
Ok that weapon is horrifyingly disgusting and for whatever sick reason I love it. Makes me remember how I wish the killers were a little more, (ok I lot) more monstrous. Best of luck if you submitted it for the contest!!
---
I'm not home so I can't get my player cloud ID :(
---
Devs fix bugs and balance shit every patch.  I'm not a fan of every decision but they do try.   I dont understand these memes.
---
I never played with a mori yet, maybe I should!
---
another one? I mean, wasn't GF "fixed" already?
---
While the timer might be a tad long, it’s what makes it a strong perk.  As someone who tends to lean towards killer, I feel it allows survivors to have strategy and use it in a way that can help their team. I’m happy with how it is. It’s an anti-tunneling perk that allows for some skillful quick thinking in the right situation.
---
I'm just kidding, I fully understand that. i just think you should check out my work before making that decision. But that's up to you, have a nice day :)
---
exactly, as a casual player you are forced to play the same character all the time because of this and even then you likely will never manage to get all perks in the game on just 1 character. Leveling a new killer/survivor up to get the teachables already takes more than a million bloodpoints, then you have 3 new perks to get to level 3, so 9 more level 50 bloodweb on your main account. as a casual player especially without events you might not even finish that until the next release, let alone getting all teachables of the other killers.
---
What if as a casual player you already had all teachables and you really like the new killer, like ghost face right now. Suddenly you have to level 180+ levels to get all perks on that new killer, no way any casual player will get that done before a new killer comes out.
---
The current system ensures that casual players will never catch up and forces them to play the same character all the time. Making the game boring and in the end making the player quit.
---
That's a "gateau de patate" which translates to "potato cake"
---
I’m really sad the old Kate voice actor was changed. Minus her old ear-destroying screams, she did really well with the grunts/pain noises and really seemed like she put a lot of effort and genuinely understood her voice acting.
---
No,but they're a smaller studio that takes on way more projects than they seem to be able to take on.  Approximately 500 employees isn't bad, but they've got constant DbD stuff on their plate, constant Deathgarden stuff, assisting with Star Citizen, and whatever they're going to going to be working on for Netflix (some overeager people are thinking it's Stranger Things licensed stuff for DbD, but considering it's Behaviour, and considering we already know the Epic partnership with Netflix has to do with Stranger Things in Fortnite, I'd be more willing to bet they're working on a mobile game or something for some completely different Netflix title)
---
They stole code for Fallout Shelter that they didn't own just to make the Westworld game, and I never thought it was with malicious intent: I just think BHVR is frequently taking on more than they can actually afford to take on to make extra profit
---
Not quite a slasher but I really want pyramid head
---
He slows as he charges allowing you to position yourself to a loop or window.  He then loses manouverability and has to land it.  It is different.
---
I try not to tunnel, but when I have to tunnel I do it. Someone rescues 3 seconds after I hooked a survivor without BT? I'm sorry, ur getting at least slugged bro. Also: A healthy rescuer runs to a jungle gym, an unhooked guy runs into nothingness. Who should I chase, let's wonder...  
---
If they complain about tunneling I say: you tunneled the gens.
---
It's pretty common with online games that get constant updates.
---
Well my thinking is that if I'm near the hooks (not on top of them obviously) like 30-50m away then when they get them off I get two people for one hooked. I do see how it could be annoying
---
Same.
---
Swf is wildly not fun to play against.
---
OoO is wildly not fun to play against.

MoM is wildly not fun to play against.

4 flashlights is wildly not fun to play against.
---
Stop whining when a new killer comes out, you ruin the game because you want easy mode.
---
Devs finally make a good scary killer, but it seems people are too dumb to play against him. Everything you can is to cry about something being OP when it is just a bit stronger then average. You disgust me.
---
While I agree, I mean which in game killer would you be interested seeing adapted to a feature length film
---
A killer doing their job of killing? O H N O
---
Lolol so you had fun in the matches where it would take over a minute or two minutes to mend yourself, just to have to do it again a minute or two later?
---
Bruh
---
...yes.. a second. i dont get how seeing a video of lagswitching one day means that its common and not rare
---
This is sick!! Finally a skin that's actually scary!
---
Too many cosmetics are just for eye candy, this is both scary and bad ass!
---
Oh you definitely should. makes matches way easier plus they are plentiful for me. Makes hard matches into easy matches instead of having to hook people multiple times you can just end them right then and there.

I have had so many Oink names haha:

OH my bad. Spirit or hag

Basically you cant handle the truth. Its not about him being OP, its about a mechanic not working as intended.

He also has the instasaw addons, can snipe you from acorss the map, and can be everywhere at once.

There are also the others i mentioned

Ghostface. Plague is literally m1 Simulator while Ghostface is somewhat decent

I was really hoping you'd point after the first one and just like that you made my day.
---
I agree with the intention of the vault change for windows like cow tree and ironworks that should not be fast vaulted both ways, but the current solution ruins other windows  by forcing you to commit to the vault earlier.
---
Site?
---
What are these splinters of which you speak?
---
Entity, switching spirit and ghost faces weapons:
---
“hehehe pranked”
---
Burn them to let you play as the killer they’re assigned to, smoking splinter is freddy and black splinter is micheal

I got BBQ 1 at P3 lvl40....damn bloodweb rng
---
What is good about this perk if you have scratches? It may only work if a survivor has Lithe + dance with me + Quick and quiet. It's super niche and I don't remember the last time I lost a survivor after he/she vaulted a window.
---
How hot though?  100% GPU utilization is normal and if you are getting much below 100% you aren't getting the most out of your GPU.  Low GPU usage is usually indicating you need to upgrade your CPU.
---
Removed  for party thread please post /r/dbdLFG
---
Lmao that's exactly who came to my mind.
---
Okay?
---
I only heard of this game because of xbone gamepass.   I'm really happy it made its way to the gamepass and I could give it a go.
---
I'll probably buy it once it rotates off.
---
I'd like to see something out in the woods with huntress
---
I've been getting so many as killer I get more then I can use. I'm prestiging my Ghostface though so when he is maxed out I'll have the cakes right there as a special thing in my inventory
---
Ohhh ... gotcha.  Thanks.
---
I don't know if that'll work sadly
---
I have same issue don’t really care tho I try to ignore them
---
These fking plague community skins are always soo freaking good
---
are you telling me you didn't run fast enough to outplay him 
---
tsk tsk
---
that's the best part my slightly agitated friend
---
I made another tier list, this time I improved it and listened to feedback. Feel like I nailed it this time
---
Thanks man! I didn't report because I was still in doubt cause I saw only few people talking here but if I see this team again I'll certainly going to do this. Thanks a lot!
---
just a few minutes ago I got to P3 lvl 25 and got barbecue and ruin right after each other but still haven’t seen tier 2 yet
---
What are we supposed to do? Find weapons? Lol
---
Same with plague. No bbq but max was 220k.
---
P - pipeline
---
This is by far my favorite cosmetic for vommy mommy! I need this for my main gal!!!!
---
-and then there’s me, who keeps being the last one downed, and then teabagged for my **entire duration of bleedout timer** because they feel like being salty.
---
2.5K and I'm just burnt from it, I even ghost Ghostface, but it still felt meh
---
Ik what you mean. My main has over 6 splinters for Myers when he's prestige 3 and it's clogging my bw.
---
I've seen a lot of people use Lithe, Dance with me, and quick and quite and they just vanish after vaulting a window
---
I really don't understand the purpose of being so toxic when there's literally no provocation at all! Why can't people just move on, let others have fun or just be satisfied if they escaped the game? Why do they have to be insulting and mock others skills or motives?
---
Sorry you had to deal with a person like that! :(
---
What, lettuce hag doesnt scare you? Doesnt take you back to when your mom tried to shove those greens into the back of your throat?
---
No way in hell am I gonna prestige GF, love him, but I’m not gonna lose on 100 cakes bc I want a bloody outfit that I’m never gonna use lmao
---
Fanfic is kinda 2015 though
---
To be fair I agree but a lot of ppl did cry about MoM so it got nerfed pretty damm hard. Not that I’m saying ghost face needs a nerf I love him but you can’t reallu use Mom as a example really anymore
---
Do you even play PS4 solo survivor?
---
That's cheap af and sad. This event has been so good to everybody get some points, I am using a lot of these Gateaus then, there are these type of ppl...
---
Well, I'll wait them to fix that and start to bring Moris if I see something weird like that or the same ppl. Thank you, man!
---
Me failing my 360
---
He’s a base M1 killer with zero map pressure that can occasionally give off the willies. His power takes too long to come to fruition for him to reliably do well. If this was an annoyance chart, he’d definitely be in the S tier.
---
pretty sure the match I saw him have it was in lery's...
---
Anyways, if what you said is in fact true then I wont hold it against him, but I remember him hard-abusing the R-exploit to dodge flashlight saves a few months back so Im kind of skeptical, but whatever, if bhvr doesnt see it fit to suspend him or take the title away then it's not my place to condemn him.
---
Ghostface. Plague is too easy to counter her main power by simply not cleansing, which basically takes her power away and makes her a glorified M1 killer.
---
Iridescent F
---
Get rid of thrilling tremors and use either ruin or enduring/brutal force
---
Eh doctors a very subjective one because he has very different play styles but personally I think he’s ok
---
Pretty good reasoning

I want an evil chef with clowns bod and a meat cleaver but we can’t all have what we want CAN WE.

I would argue it’s due to the lighting but Dwight’s shirt is completely different.

The title is incorrect. If I had said "What began as a hopeful morning for farmers." It would be correct. If I had said "What had begun as a hopeful morning for farmers." It would be correct. Begun is incorrect to use if you do not support it with "had/have"

---
I hope you've learned something today, as have I.
---
Even though the change is to prevent fast vaults both ways for certain windows the current solution isn’t perfect.
---
Since the change applies to every window instead of the problem windows it forces you to commit to a window vault early to avoid meduim vaulting.
---
This means that if a killer doubles back early you are already forced to commit to the window.
---
Object of Depression is the best name for that perk. I don't love seeing it when I decide to play Nurse. The disconnect tastes like a cupcake every time.
---
Insta heals are balanced...  
---
Btw first time I saw it I thought that the green medkit addon is babushka and I was rather confusion
---
damn thats so much since you have him on P3, I already have all perks on him though so I'm not gonna risk losing it all haha
---
Gf is better than Myers, in all, real stealth, instadowns in 4 seconds, and better than evil within 3, you can left the exposed effect to 1 click for the injured survivors and come later when they heal
---
Shocking bhvr still hasn't figured out audio yet... 3 years later.
---
Man do you even play this game
---
Yes thats why I said near impossible, I've played several matches against him and have always done that while running away and it hasn't worked yet
---
also, people don't want to play during the event cuz the match quality is terrible, which makes survivor lobbies take long too
---
for the killers that ask "why making a lobby takes so long when people join right away", the game starts a lobby once it finds people for you to play with, so if you made a lobby straight away it would take just as long to find people to play with
---
But did you die?
---
I'd like to see her out in the woods too ...
---
But pc is the place with no aim assist for those games. You got that reverse bud.
---
Ghost is loud compared to the heavy breathing of Myers. Certain builds make Myers heartbeat almost nonexistent. His one can be charged on all survivors and bit more versatile. Plus you can one shot all survivors compared to stalking individual survivors. Which gets a lot harder the better the survivors get.
---
oh no I've heard the devs have said that you can use them after the event, if not ill be pissed cause 100 of them is useless
---
How about a license for the pirates of the Caribbean?
---
Jack sparrow as survivor and davy jones as killer
---
I feel like his stealth is what gives him he’s tier. Although I understand the argument that he is B tier I feel like his great stealth as well as his ability makes him a good threat. I feel he has a better stalk mechanic than Myers because (from my experience) it’s pretty easy to expose a survivor one at a time and that ends chases fast
---
I love it!
---
It looked like Claude was diving at first glance and all I could think was 
---
“MR PRESIDENT GET DOWN! WE’VE GOT A HUNTRESS, ILL TAKE THE HATCHET!”
---
the devs have said yes.
---
And then you can't catch them because haddonfield :(
---
By that point the add on ment for new nurses is useless
---
fuck that's old as shit
---
Yeh
---
Not what I meant but I like the way you think lol
---
Dats da joke
---
or the smoker from l4d
---
I literally throw my headset every time I get hooked because it's SOOO loud.
---
I still have no idea why that perk works on him. It turns him from a good killer to an absolutely useless one in two seconds
---
All thoughts of sanity fall in the face of that subreddit
---
\^\_\^  
---
Its ok 
---
not everyone 
---
makes it
---
Kappa
---
Yep, that's why he's top tier /s
---
Literally meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Oh, I was talking about the Doctor, haha. As for GF, I think he’ll eventually reside where he is, possibly a smidge lower with the adjustments being made and players getting more used to him.
---
The lean works that way purposefully. Unless you're basically behind him while he's leaning you're better off hiding.
---
Big agree
---
Farming on the PTB? May I ask why?
---
Move Billy down a tier and I agree. I've always seen Billy on tier with huntress and occasionally lower than her. But no one besides nurse really competes with spirit.
---
I hear you. And I agree. I didn't see a Leyrs game but like I said he was testing a bunch of perks to see if they were also bugged. The wake up game was in the swamp
---
People who use it crawl around the map and generally never do the objective or get chased, and are the ones most likely to find hatch. The reason people call it urban immersion is simply because it sounds similar and matches the description of most who use it
---
He is a sneaky boy, much like Michael, you have to keep your eyes out for him and be sneakier.
---
His stealth is better than Myers. In Night Shroud there is not heart beat and GF can crouch/lean. And Myers is significantly bigger. And personally I prefer being able to stalk individuals. I like getting all the survivors a one tap with stalk. Not to mention GF has better chase potential than Myers
---
You forgot to "whos that pokemon" the unreleased ones :(
---
I was deciding if Max should of been a Normal or Fighting Type, and debated adding Psychic to Lisa.
---
Removed Fire from Freddy and replaced it with Psychic, since it fits his character more. Ghostface is Dark instead of Psychic. Also Changed Legion to Normal, I feel like Dark type is more fitting to stealthy "in the shadows" killers. 
---
Added Steel to Amanda. As well as added Plague.
---
His ability makes his terror radius nothing you can use perks like spine chill that alerts you that he is looking at you directly give you time to run or dark sense that shows where he is when you complete a generator for 5 seconds.
---
He doesn't deserve to be nerfed, just like mettle of man didn't deserve to be nerfed (sad face)
---
Thing is he has nothing to help him in a chase against a good survivor, that's why I put him B.
---
Just because he drinks copious amounts of Monster doesn’t mean he can’t be gay
---
Not surprised that matchmaking/SWF had Red Ranks VS Green Ranks...that shit grinds my gears, esp when these type of players will 100% abuse bugs and unintentional shit......Its foolish to wish BHVR actually holds these players accountable, but I hope they get punished
---
^(its his power, you can take him out of stealth by looking directly at him for a short duration. You can use perks like premonition, spinechill, and OoO to counter him and know when he's close by. Even though i don't recommend OoO because it's a dick move and strongly counters his power.)
---
Perks to consider : Spine Chill and Premonition. Spine chill has no cooldown, but you don't know what direction the killer is coming from. Premonition let's you know what (general) direction the killer is coming from, but has a cooldown before you can be notified again.
---
You must not be looking very hard. A lot of the cosmetics look extremely clean. Like too clean to be worn by someone who just got stabbed 32 times.
---
Lol, you think this was merely about Insta Heals?
---
Ok but what about the cotton candy monster from scooby doo 2?/s
---
No. Just no
---
 hoes are scary too!
---
for me worsk perfectly, i still get detected and i detect GF very easly, its u guys that ur not precise
---
My friend drew this, hell yeah!
---
Claudette def grass type
---
Object of Obsession has a limited range in which it works, and it also exposes the survivor as well. 
---
Anytime i've ever encountered Object of Obsession, i just make a beeline right to the survivor and kill them. i've not had any real issues hunting them down, and i'm not even a good killer.
---
No. Let them learn from the Hook as I did.
---
And...every killer couldnt Mind Game the red stain before? Spirit couldnt just avoid it? Nurse teleports though it. Huntress and hit you over it. Hag can trap it and teleport past it. Pig could do the same thing with her crouch but with a dash attack.
---
NOED is used mainly as a crutch perk and for most builds, won’t help a killer pip/get better. There are some builds/killers it works well with, but I hardly see that being the case. 
---
I play a majority of my games as killer and would rather have a build that gives me the power to dictate the pace and maximize my score/ability to kill during the trial. 95% of the time, if NOED’s procced, you’ve already lost.
---
*gets tunneled, camped and Mori'd*
---
Yup totally got tons more BP as a survivor.
---
Is this the Hash Slinging Slasher?
---
r/comedynecromancy
---
Honestly, +1 blink should be ultra rare, as should the considerable range increase, and no other increased blinks should exist. They're insanely broken
---
Last person alive
---
Killer can’t find hatch
---
Finish last gen 
---
Open gate
---
Only way I could think of doing it
---
Tfw I can never get any PC good enough to run DBD
---
Ruin is balanced. NOED either needs a notification once the last generator is completed or a totem counter for solo queue survivors. Or get rid of the speed boost. It's already crutch as is.
---
Ruin is a cruch perk for bad game desgin and NoED has the same problems as both Mom and old DS. A free second change perk with no gameplay, little counters, and its just boring.
---
yea, but let's put it like this.
---
no one can find a lobby now, so for rank 20s it's only amplified
---
I think i may have come across you, honestly, i get it.  I hope life is less of a bitch today (:
---
you can really go to stealth since when you do, they can see you even when you’re 5m away, this counters any mindgames you try to do with your ability. So obviously it’s hard to get an expose effect on them as well if they’re smart and stay behind walls the whole time and loop you.
---
Marry it.
---
My brother used to put this on and grab the plastic butcher knife and scare the shit out of me when I was younger.  My mom put it on the top shelf in my closet and I bet it's still there.
---
5 blink nurse sucks tho. it really is a terrible build.
---
Unpopular opinion
---
Ruin is bad and really overrated
---
Survivors are what make Noed seem like a top tier perk, when it should be like B tier at most
---
It would be dumb not to. It would make people even more unhappy if didnt fit the character of ghostface
---
But you have seen them

---
Lololol Ruin is balanced and easy to work around without having to bust the totem and I'm hoping it'll be slightly less mandatory with the Pop Goes the Weasel buff that went live with the last patch.
---
U could prolly replace overcharge with pop goes the Weasel I'm guessing but rather than small skill checks u would just have extra gen regression
---
Freddy 👏 isn't 👏 F 👏 tier
---
I think shes fun its just..shes not really..intresring. Her power doesnt stand out much, it relies on survivors to do things, and its just..i dunno.
---
Luckily I'm a terrible nurse so it balances out
---
Good game budget, high value loops. Doing gens, you?
---
Huh? I don't think you understand what I'm saying. I know there are killers that can deal with them easily. I'm saying for all the m1 killers ghost face is the only one that is Impossible to loop at them. Pigs dash is trash outside of small loops.
---
you can't really go to stealth since when you do, they can see you even when you’re 5m away, this counters any mindgames you try to do with your ability. So obviously it’s hard to get an expose effect on them as well if they’re smart and stay behind walls the whole time and loop you.
---
I meant Billy haha claudette dark type duh
---
i run  BBQ, Ruin, not shamefully NOED(if im doing a build, then i will not use NOED) and infectious fright or discordance- I can get a 4k 3gen game with both but when it comes to TOXIC AF SWF it is much harder to get more than a 1k or 2k with plague from my experience
---
They are both M1 killers with instadowns. Plauge has a ranged attack while GF has stealth.
---
You have ample time to get it of and it doesn't start till a gen is done. The one complain players have about pig is how useless her traps feel, they are not too strong.
---
Ur braindead i cant help you im sorry. My example for incentive is not anecdotal by any means. I have 1700 hours and have been rank 1 killer and survivor since before ranks reset and i can say games have a much higher quality at rank 1 period theres no opinion there
---
the RNG is definitely fucked. in my experience, it's only ever the first one, or the last one that lets me remove the RBT (Reverse Bear Trap).
---
F tier is named after Freddy
---
BIG IRON ON HIS HIP
---
Self promoting?
---
He didn't want to mori you because he already had 3 pictures with you.
---
Downvoted?  If you can't work around ruin you should just uninstall the game.
---
It's as easy as getting a regular skill check, waiting for the animation of smoke and sparks to finish, and then resuming work.  Even if you were to continue working on the generator during that animation, you make no progress and great skill checks don't give you any extra progress either.
---
Pigs dash can still go around them, Wraith can partly mindgame at it too. 
---
And so..Ghostface is strong at one type of loop. You still have jungle gyms and other loops hes not.
---
Yeah, that's true ( Doctor shock range is a joke tho ). I still place her in B tier in general ( in general because her ranking is related to maps very much, she's A tier in Blood Lodge and she's D tier in Fractured Cowshed for example ).
---
STBFL RUIN BBQ and finally RANCOR to get rid of those filthy OoO users at the endgame.
---
Doctor shock is just hard to see the range because it has a charge up THEN a travel time which is kinda stupid. 
---
And yea, she is defetinly map depednt, but most killerrs are
---
youre probably not going to be happy with this but honestly---- that is so awesome
---
That might be but I feel region plays a big part in this.
---
Being from Norway it's easy getting survivor lobbies in most ranks because of the insane amount of russian killers. Can't even remember the last time I had any queue time issues.
---
Roadhog lmao
---
Any killer can moonwalk though.
---
Love it
---
1 thing I am curious about. Will the Gruesome Gateau's be useable after the event is over? I understand its an Event offering but they don't effect gameplay outside of more BP.
---
after going back and re-reading the perk, you're right. i misunderstood the scope of the power. 
---
Still, i wouldn't recommend Object of Obsession to survivors who weren't confident in their ability to juke/evade the killer.
---
cheers!
---
I offered you mercy and you spat in my face?
---
*Breaks out Iri head+infantry belt huntress with lery's offering*
---
Because the glitched perk Wake up is Quentin's teachable and since many people are using and I gurantee many don't have it for all their characters they might use Quentin so I just use a mori to counter it
---
The length of time doesn’t matter. BHVR has already decided that using bugged perks or addons that exploit game mechanics is ban worthy. Survivors are using a bugged perk that exploits the games mechanics to gain an unfair advantage. That’s ban worthy. Once again nice and slow for you here: the length of time doesn’t matter. BHVR has already decided that it violates their policies. 
---
&gt;survivor mains had to put up with the bullshit for multiple weeks 
---
There’s the real issue! You’re a salty survivor main who doesn’t like it when someone suggest that survivors start getting the same ban hammer that killers got. 
---
&gt;Legion had been out for longer but its not like the devs jumped up and started banning right away.
---
Actually yes, BHVR was very quick to issue out bans when the bug was brought to their attention and even encouraged survivors to report Legion players who were using the exploit so they would be banned. 
---
Once again, BHVR has already decided that using bugs to exploit the game is ban worthy. Now it’s the survivors doing it and suddenly we got to stop and sit on our hands and wait for BHVR to think about what they wanna do? Lmao get out of here salty survivor.
---
Depends. If it's, let's say, Hex: Ruin, then you would have to cleanse the one that's lit up with a fire which then cancels that specific perk.
---
If the killer has NOED then yeah you would have to cleanse all the totems in order to cancel that out.
---
Well I think Spirit's red add-on makes blood pools visible, she can't see them at all without it. Though it might be decent combined with it.
---
Also isn't spirit already top tier?
---
I agree with ur opinion.
---
Thank you for this informative announcement.
---
It breaks him out of is power. Not the exposed effect.
---
No it removes their stealth not the exposed
---
You have to cleanse a "hex totem"(lit up totems) in order to disable a hex perk.  
---
For NOED, either cleanse the hex totem once the gates have been powered or cleanse all dull totems.
---
wait 45 seconds to remove it
---
looking at him stops him from stalking further
---
*Step step fingerpaint. Step step fingerpaint.*
---
It's getting about 80 degrees, even in lobby. I don't know why the utilization need to be this high in lobby. I enabled vsync through configuration files and it seems to be good now.
---
Spirit with the sound fix is pretty nasty, i think she now surpasses Billy.
---
* **Rule 8** - Oversaturated Content. Oversatured posts are common &amp; uninteresting posts that do not add anything of value to the subreddit.
---
* Screenshot highlighting a salty chatlog.
---
You look at him to take him out of the stalk to stop him from exposing you looking at him doesn't take it away you just need to run for 45 seconds to not get instadowned
---
Right now, it will only go away once the 45 seconds end. Eventally he cant restalk you once the hot fixes go out
---
Even if it is, it makes sense. The Macmillan, Coldwind, and Autowrecker maps were the originals. Also, i dont see how its rigged for survivors.
---
True, but there are a lot of perks on survivor that are crutch perks so the killer should get some.
---
The leak might not have been the final version. Or it could be because really high details like the leaks just looks jarring compared to the rest of the game
---
So uncivilized
---
&gt; If the killer has NOED then yeah you would have to cleanse all the totems in order to cancel that out.
---
to add on to this, NOED (No One Escapes Death) doesn't become active (hex) until the gates become powered (all generators complete). 
---
but, as /u/VolterTube stated, if you destroy all 5 totems are destroyed, the killer will be denied NOED.
---
I mean I’m pretty sure it’s random but Idk
---
me: reads title
---
me: Yes, yes she does.
---
me: realises OP means nerfs
---
me: AH HELL NAW SHE DOESN'T!!!!
---
There's 5 of each of them but only 1/2 variants of other maps so it makes sense they appear quite often. :)
---
I'm sure there are some of those people out there, but why would he do that ? Is not like I wanted him to get stuck in the pallet, and I did everything to help him get out (I signaled my teammates to come get me up so I can put him in another animation to get out).
---
You don't lose the exposed effect by looking at Ghostface, you break him out of his power (the ability to stalk and removed terror radius/red stain). If he already fully stalked you while he still had his power active, you're still exposed. You lose the exposed effect after a while automatically. I don't know how long exactly right now, but it should be about 30-40 seconds, I think.
---
Survivors have so many crutch perks bruh. This is like the only killer one.
---
There are more non-DLC maps, which is why you get them more often.  
---
I don't know how MacMil and Autohaven are survivor sided; I usually find those maps the most fun for both sides.
---
totem spawns all have fixed locations, the more you play the more youll recognize were they are, there also a perk called small game that helps find totems and traps.
---
I just hate how he can hear someone exposing him. When I’m trying to evade his LOS while he’s looking around the gen I was working on and I’m watching him walk away, it’ll reveal him/ give him the sound he’s being revealed and he’ll come back. That’s ass backwards, I’m being punished for revealing him. Should change so he’s actually punished for being in the open by taking away the sound he gets while being revealed
---
It could be because there are multiple variations of those specific maps because they have been on the game longer than most other maps. That would explain why you have a higher chance of going to these maps.
---
Coldwin, MacMillan &amp; Autohaven all have 5 maps based on those realms whereas Ormond only has a single map in that realm. As a result its just a higher probability that those maps are the ones that are used. 
---
It could also be that the anniversary event is increasing the odds of these maps being used as they are some of the oldest maps in the game so it would be fitting for them to be played often during the anniversary of dbd. It's unlikely this is the case but when the Plague was released, an increase in frequency for her own personal map could be observed.
---
&gt; If the killer has NOED then yeah you would have to cleanse all the totems in order to cancel that out. 
---
Or cleanse the lighten up totem when all genes are done or if the killer closes the hatch
---
It takes awhile, but you eventually learn the general totem placement spots on each map. They also tend to be situated near gens or jungle gyms, so get in the habit of doing a lap around the area before starting a gen and you’ll probably find one.
---
I get them to. I believe they still spawn if you bought the killer with auric cella.
---
I like to imagine the survivors don't know how generators work but neither does the entity, so it just sees them fiddling and figures that's how it's supposed to be repaired.
---
Honestly, I run BBQ, Ruin, NOED, and then the last one depends on killer. I think its a very solid build. Survivor Mains say its shitty crutch perking but they go on running, Adrenaline, MoM,  DS, and either sprint burst or balanced landing --if killer mains were to bitch as often you would hear nothing but WOW ALL SURVIVORS ARE CRUTCH PERKERS(insert sarcasm here).  its literally the nature of the game
---
Okay but survivors have a lot of crutch perks so killers should get some. I'm mostly putting this cause I know low level survivors will get salty.
---
BT's true power is the fact that it allows you to save people who are being face camped in the end game, which happens constantly. No other perk allows you to rescue someone in that situation.
---
And let's be real, plenty of killers are gonna tunnel. Enough to make this perk worth it.
---
&gt; I have 1700 hours and have been rank 1 killer and survivor since before ranks reset and i can say 
---
...so the very definition of what anecdotal means? Okay.
---
Stop playing dumb. You know exactly what people mean when they say they want incentives for reaching higher ranks. There needs to be a reason to climb ranks. Not just anecdotes.
---
I felt this, why would you want to nerf piggy and her traps at that?
---
Whats NOED
---
You remembering you have Blood Warden and NOED and then.....?
---
I wanna see how it ends.
---
&gt; perk called small game
---
Small game is a great perk, in my opinion. It also detects Trapper and Hag traps.
---
*No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip*
---
Yeah. But it is a bunch better than before. There was no limit. It isn’t run as much anymore as it is nowhere near as strong. 
---
Keep in mind that chasing someone right off the hook with borrowed time can take up 40 seconds. It happened to me where I was tunneled and only had the tier 1 perk at 40. Wasn’t able to get a DS off.
---
Oh that helps thx

Well I had a trapper who I got stuck in a pallet and freed in the same manner but he hooked me and when I asked him wtf he said it was for 'getting me stuck in the first place' lol
---
You're right, literally zero risk. No M1 killer has ever sacrificed a survivor. I stand corrected.
---
Oh nice, the fact that they have a fixed spot makes it more reasonable
---
Suddenly wraith uncloaks in front of him
---
That’s not what this post is about. Also, doesn’t make certain perks balanced having a tit for tat broken/crutch status.  Also, out of curiosity, which perks do you deem crutch for survivors?

---
Plague: Pukey girl. 
---
Ghostface: ghosty boi
---
Facts. But they do have a lot of crutch perks and also have 4 people to have a combo of those perks and some that also can transfer the perks power to other survivors. But then killers should run no perks and let all survivors heal and not hit them and do gens for them and beg on their knees to be looped.
---
You must be rank 20
---
I can work with ghosty boi.
---
Duh? Lol. I'm not complaining. I was just making an observation.
---
I can tell you for a fact I started at him center of my screen for ten years and he still wouldn’t get revealed
---
The Pig update was needed. I upvoted you for this.
---
Lmao rank 4 killer rank one survivor. Thank you next.
---
Dude why so hostile?
---
Maybe for your rank 20 ass
---
You have to prioritize your route to the boxes to make it as short and efficient as possible.  If it's activated when you get off the hook, or get off the ground you have to get it off, you have no time to self care or get healed by an ally.
---
Some pigs like to tunnel and that's a sad fact, but it's no different than any other killer doing the same thing.
---
#missedconnections
---
except the game is heavily killer sided
---
I agree on 85% that is 85% more than most of the other lists.
---
Kids in my elementary school got into so much trouble for wearing these lmao
---
Where's Candyman?!?!?!
---
Guy already has a hook for a hand, his power is bees! and his setting is realistically creepy! C'mon BHVR! 
---
Also 'helen's theme' is pretty memorable too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnKGFxs1MMI
---
After finishing my 143rd Bloodweb for Legion this happened; I couldn't spend any bloodpoints or access any of the invisible nodes.
---
I was able to fix it, but I thought it was weird enough to warrant sharing.
---
Still dont see how this is anecdotal it makes no sense to call it that when its something that just is, its not an example it just IS
---
“I think you’ll find it does” 😂 nice
---
This is so sad can we get a legion buff
---
His stalk is too op can’t even break it before he exposes you
---
He actually did break it, he was just injured and dc’d
---
Every time I see a stealth killer like ghost face and I'm with another survivor who doesn't see that I scream that.
---
In terms of killers it’s 1. A good nurse 2. A good billy 3. Myers 4. Spirit 5. Trapper. Considering there’s 16 killers now I’d say yes, he’s top tier thanks for agreeing.
---
Isn’t she just back to where she was, sound wise?
---
Pt.2 and more coming up
---
Eh, certain variations can be rough for the killer.  
---
For autohaven, the wretched shop building loop is pretty survivor sided, especially if you get two or more pallets.  
---
McMil has the factory with two levels and that's another spot you can loop the killer for a few generators.
---
I'd say the small farm, rotten field, and the wrecking yard maps are both more in favor of the killer because if you get downed anywhere that's not on the outer edges there's a good chance you're going into the basement.
---
Rank one survivor rank four killer thank you next.
---
I know it shouldnt be tit for tat but alot of killer perks are wack. Eh, adrenawin, decisive a little bit, self care by definition pretty much, most exhaustion perks, mettle of man definitely, borrowed time but I know sometimes it's a necessity, and there are more I'm just working rn. These are perks that in most situations will increase your chances of winning during endgame, which is what noed is.
---
Sorry let me add to the instructions. 1. Trap pallets and killer shack 2. Don’t suck
---
On Xbox mate
---
Notice I did not include Coldwind maps there.  
---
The Wretched Shop is simple - don't loop the main building.  
---
The Ironworks - don't loop the ironworks window.
---
I did it and can't get even 1 up vote lol.
---
you already have an evil chef with Leatherface ;)
---
...After you got drunk and abandoned by your coworkers? Dwight?
---
What the actual fuck :)) Kind of stupid to do that, considering you're not trapping him on purpose and  you also freed him.
---
We can only hope.. But its probably gonna take some time
---
It was the whole package! :D
---
Well, if each game take around 20 minutes to find or create only to get matched with loading screen quitters and lag switchers, then of course I wouldn’t be so encouraged to play it.
---
You are not supposed to hear survivors in lockers.
---
So what, give up the chase every time the survivor goes to the buildings?
---
It’s Been taking me like 10 mins to find a match as killer too, I think it’s because they’re trying to set up dedicated servers
---
Yep I had to run right into his face just to detect him but basically gives him a free hit and now I'm injured.. not the best counterplay.
---
do you mean the hash-slinging slasher?
---
Happened to me too on another map!
---
When you attempt a Adept achievement.
---

For survivor it’s almost instant, but killer... boy

You get Games?
---
Third seal and Devour are good too (If they don’t get fucked in the first minute)
---
The lag switch, and the way he nods his head like he did something... Players like this will flop once dedicated servers come in.
---
Because that's his name? Hes known as the ghostface. That's the character.
---
So reddit won’t let me post the rest here so I’ll just be posting them on my own page u/FreezingFinest
---
I’m in Red ranks because I always play against whoever I see. I get better at this game by learning to play against different play styles, you on the other hand only play against a specific group that you deem “EASY” but then you’ll play against an actual group that gives you a challenge and will basically cause you to struggle and try your best to kill them.

This makes me think of Wraith’s lore. He was unwittingly crushing people for his boss, so he snapped and ripped out the spine of said boss then disappeared... so why is he killing survivors now unless he either enjoys killing now or is sick of the dark side of human nature and wants to cleanse the world... or both.
---
to clarify, there are 5 totems at the start of the match, but there are x number of potential spots that they could be hidden. i'm not sure how many spots (x) there are allocated, but eventually you'll get the hang of where they all are.  and i cannot recommend Small Game enough.
---
The disguise as survivor will never happen because any group of SWF will completely remove their ability, making them useless
---
I'd much rather they merge Flip-Flop and Tenacity tbh. 🤷‍♂️
---
I've done it down a long hallway on lerry's although I had to really center it
---
Just strong perks that can occupy one slice of a build. Also, MoM is garbo now; read the patch notes.  Also, strong, meta perks ~~=~~ crutch.
---
I would've totally let you go unscathed after those shenanigans for sure.
---
I upvoted it, so someone down voted it.
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
---
Ruin isn’t overrated. It’s just popular and people want to act like it isn’t good. It is very very good against competent survivors who do gens in 0.2 seconds 
---
Noed on the other hand isn’t as great since it’s a catch-up mechanic if you’ve lost, and can do nothing as it’s a hex perk
---
Weird way of advertising your shitty video
---
OINK
---
Yep yep, i applied it the moment u mentioned it, didnt read it all , i read traps and said to myself well thats useless 😅
---
No one is using the gateau offering because everyone is putting all their points into ghostface, and no one's playing ghostface because killer ques are too long! It's a real shame
---
Yeah, that one, and the ones about the Clowns back story and some specific add on text got me as I haven't read all the lore yet.
---
Wouldn’t Tommy boy technically be a cook of sorts?
---
*That poor sweet child*
---
i got stuck on a tree on one map, and i couldn't fucking get out of it until the killer came by, downed me, and then picked me up. even downed, i couldn't move away.
---
Because for every one of your experiences in which you get high ranked teammates who can actually play, I get braindead idiots who DC after they get downed.
---
Never said they didn't. Although after the MoM nerf, I can't think of a survivor perk, or any perk for that matter, that is as crutch as NOED. Like speaking from personal experience, NOED almost single-handedly carried me to my first time as rank 1 killer when I had almost no killer experience whatsoever and this was back when DS was still OP.
---
I know I saw the patch notes but I actually don't mind it much. I think it makes it more legit that you have to earn it then just be hit and get a free hit for nothing idk. I get why people say it's garbo now but idk. Also, I was afraid to include meta perks as crutch but I guess that's correct.
---
yes you have to buy hag with shard/real money it depends, but i dont wanna spend real money on killers that i can buy by grinding and getiing shards, i prefer spending real money on licensed killers since there is no other way to buy those
---
Thats funny because I get the game and lerys almost every other game
---
Omg that frame drop jesus christ
---
Black Beard would  be cool
---
Depends on how fast you die as a Survivor though.  Events tend to bring out the sweatiest Killers who ensure no one can have fun but them.
---
This happened to someone else as well as they were playing survivor, and they went across the pallet to get the killer free.
---
I agree, or maybe an island with the fence on the outskirts, a beached shipwreck, the killer is a captain that was killed during a mutiny and the survivor that orchestrated the actual mutiny.
---
Trust me, you’ll never see it actually proc in game. It’s nerfed to the ground. If it does proc, more power to them. I don’t know how they survived up to that point.
---
I want to say unexpected thanks but don't want to be basic. Good shit.
---
tbh double blood points is the only time i truly have fun with levelling and feel like it's a grind, but not an unholy amount of grinding. i heard they're looking into making the grind for the game less... terrible, and honestly the only way i could see is bumping up bp earn to 2x or 1.5x at least.
---
Play survivor?
---
You don't get as much per round but you can get so many more games in.
---
Oh dang it's actually sub. Nice.
---
Does it get stacks from hook saves or only protective hits?
---
You either give up the chase or lose gens.  
---
Just look for survivors away from those areas, you can 3-gen pretty easily that way.
---
To the three people who saw this post, myself included, I asked if he had anything he wanted to say to you guys, unfortunately, no dice.
---
Protective hits. Hook saves would have been too easy, so they eliminated that idea.
---
If we're going nautical, they should do the merman from Cabin in the Woods.
---
Eh no worries.
---
Ahhhh, that’d be awesome! Reminds me of [Vagary from DOOM 3](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Vagary)
---
I haven't even gotten much on the Killer side.  I've either had shit luck or BHVR really put some weird variance on the odds of it showing up.  So far from leveling Legion up from 1-16 or so (didn't open his bloodweb up until the start of this event) I've only got like 2 or 3 of them, and they've been from the gift boxes instead of on their own.  
---
It just seems to be stupidly random.
---
the clown lore in game only says the mother died during childbirth, so the option the clown murdered his mother is  there to fool you into selecting it, but the right answer is  dys·to·ci·a  meaning difficult childbirth
---
Everyone wants to play their new killer in general, and you consistently make a shit ton more points as killer and its x2 blood points right now.
---
Survivor que times are near instant
---
I actually agree! When I was still working on it I saw the news about the Ram skull head coming out soon and was like, damn. I don't think I'll win because of the unfortunate similarities, but due to the contest deadline coming up and time constraints on my end, I was unable to flesh out the design as much as I would have liked to. Thank you, though! I'm glad that people seem to enjoy my artwork, regardless of this contest!

except when you want to prestige him then theyre all gone\^\^

Bro I was slugging
---
Dows ghostfaces addons stack btw?
---
I mean the folklore not in the game
---
I don't know what survivors u were against but it isn't that easy anymore. Most of the time I use it, it doesn't even activate cause people farm the totems. Also when it does activate, I got cucked by mettle of man usually lol. It's not as strong as people think especially for a perk that can never even activate sometimes.
---
Lol
---
It's the new Corrupt Intervention buff. The Entity blocks the view of the three farthest survivors for 80/100/120 seconds.
---
I agree there, it was really strong against killers with no insta downs. Hopefully it receives a small buff in the future.
---
I get autohaven and macmillan a ton, coldwind seems to depend on the day.  One day I got autohaven 8 times in a row.
---
Oh wait, that's right - I answered that one correctly (total guess). So it was the others and now I remember the "Not_Queen" Dev thing as well is what I got wrong.
---
Happy Oink
---
Looks like an Apothicon Keeper
---
No, it doesn't make sense.  There are no dedicated server's, right? So why are we waiting to be put into empty lobbies. 
---
Imagine if this were any source game with a lobby/server browser and you can't add a your own game to it? It's like there can only be so many current active games or something
---
kinda reminds me of the Tower from shadow of mordor
---
very cool idea, love it
---
Catching a survivor who thinks they're a pro evader with that never gets old, especially if it downs them.
---
Fun to watch, not to play. For me, at least
---
.
---
Impossible skillcheck doc in the game map. Enough said.
---
i mean we have the 103% cakes now until 2nd of july and if you rush through bloodwebs now and stockpile them you can use them after the event for even longer bp boost
---
Spine Chill/ Object of Obsession 
---
Breaking line of sight
---
Pallet looping
---
Right!! 
---
The world must know!
---
I'm not upset about the downvotes, I'm just surprised something like this, showing an issue with the game, is getting them lol. Looking back at ti though from last night, it does look annoying, heh. I agree with your points though, 100%. I can't keep a chase or improve my skills at looping and whatever when I'm getting his 5 feet away from the window I've just vaulted.
---
Eh it was a really low rank game, there's a lot of unnecessary salt
---
Ruin isn’t overrated. It either slows gen progression or forces survivors to get off gens to go and find it. It allows you to get some early momentum even if it only stays up for a minute. Plus is pretty much necessary if you want to get a decent gatekeeper emblem now.
---
What am I looking at here?
---
So you don't consider something that automatically makes you give up the chase to find someone else survivor sided?
---
Okalie Dokalie
---
If the other 2 survivors get exhaustion then it would be horrible
---
He probably means that Myers has better snowballing
---
Teabagging is literally the only way to communicate, half the time it *does* mean thanks.
---
I honestly keep thinking that Ruin might be better off as a universal game mechanic.  It feels 100% necessary in higher rank builds. 
---
Breaking it out as a default mechanic and giving killers a free perk slot seems like a healthy change.

---
Boom Boom faster than axe! Me like!
---
What do you want us to do about it?
---
Ehm, why would we want a pirate killer? Is this something the sub wants now?
---
But the speed of breaking him out has nothing to do with distance?
---
Nosferatu!
---
Omg yes
---
My main characters don't need bloodweb anymore since i have all the perk or even prestiged them to III.
---
I use my BP on other characters but i don't play them, so the cakes i got will stay in their inventory maybe for ever...
---
Events always bring out the asshole Killers in droves, not sure why.  Probably doesn't help that Ghostface just came out and he's basically played by the same folks who would spam Legion.
---
Moonwalking AND t-bagging. 
---
No one man should have this much power..
---
Queen's was dev stream 45
---
How do you not hear the loud ass wind noises he makes?
---
You're thinking of the Kool-Aid man.
---
Okay, so I just thought of this very thing. I’m watching Parks n Rec, playing other games, and surfing this sub... instead of actually playing the game on my one day off for the week...
---
*meh*
---
landing greats isn't that hard and neither of those perks affect those
---
You can still play the loop until the window closes and then b-line it to the next pallet.
---
Plus you can still see him moving around the T walls that are made of slats.  Just look for the giant black shape moving around.
---
I just said there is an easy way of dealing with it.
---
That's why I like to slug them all first.
---
Establish dominance and *then* show mercy. 
---
That way no goober will message "lol u bb killer culdnt even kill any1 wit a DC" afterwards.
---
I’ve been playing for a few hours every day during the event and not one killer has wanted to farm. Just a bunch of camping.
---
Forgot about these. when are they coming out?
---
I always bring a cake to the party but survivors rarely do ;(
---
That wasn’t a thx-bag. Trust me.
---
We have like 3 ghosts though
---
because before it made a lobby and got the people that were first into it. now it TRIES to make a more balanced match by putting killers and survivors into a pool first and then fishing out the best possible matches. it fails tho, because there aren't many survivors around
---
decisive is not a crutch, it's anti-tunnel and if survivors run into you right after getting unhooked you should know they have the perk. 
---
Self care? You for real? What is crutch about healing for 32 seconds and not doing any objectives? 
---
Borrowed time is a hard anti-tunnel, if you camp someone then go for the unhooker, neither DS nor BT will be a problem for you. 
---
MoM was recently changed and is no longer broken. If you do manage to make it work you deserve the additional hit. 
---
NOED on the other hand, activates right after a last gen pop, gives survivor no information that it is active, and gives an extra 4% speed boost when there are much fewer pallets available to defend yourself. 'Just cleanse totems' - yeah, and what if the killer is not running NOED? What if the perk appears once per five games or so? Wouldn't that make it broken even when not in play? Why should I shit myself every game looking for totems and praying to god my randoms cleansed a totem.
---
Damn I mean it would be. Idk. I get my were gonna live forever stacks mostly from protective hits.
---
And as a survivor main mostly, for me it's getting more and more frustrating, as bhvr trying to make every killer insta down killer and almost remove healing. Legion, plag and now ghostface all have ability to quickly negate 1 health state on multiple survivors if they dare to be together. Last m1 killer was spirit almost a year ago, but her ability makes her second/third best killer in a game overall. So it's frustrating in another way. I haven't really had much fun since legion come out, played it only because I invested so much in a game, but now with ghostface being kinda broken too, with people who abused legion now abusing him for LOL's first time made me uninstall the game from frustration, and I don't think I want to install it again.
---
I wasn’t fond of any of the free killers and I was excited when I saw ghostface gameplay, so my boyfriend actually bought him for me because it’s rare I play any game, much less online. People yelling at me over being terrible makes me so sad and anxious, I love being able to play with just a text chat that I can easily ignore lmao
---
Lmfao hello
---
Well now you're contradicting yourself. In your other comment you claimed to get a 4k every single match with Trapper. That would undoubtedly make him #1
---
That too, yes!
---
He literally has default base movement speed.
---
Ghostface isn't strong, survivors just need to learn how to AIM and look at ghostface
---
I choose to play against groups that I think will be fun/ fair to play against. I don’t find immersed gen rushing flashlight spamming voice coms users fun/ fair to play against so I don’t. You can dislike my preferences all you want, but I’m not changing them until the game gets balanced around SWF teams.
---
I think a projectile hemorrhage + slow would work. Like a barbed fishing net.
---
The easy easy way of dealing with it is to do a 3 gen strategy eventually and to immediately lose the chase when they begin to do the shop loop.
---
Giving up should not be the easy way of dealing with something balanced.
---
Agreed that stalk is insane
---
Unlike myers, he can crouch, so he can still be stealthy in the corn
---
Yeah I think DbD Ghostface is better than the original Ghostface and one of their best written killers
---
I’m a rank twenty and was thrown in a lobby with ranks 17-10 survivors! I was wondering why the gens were actually getting done lol
---
That would work if they removed his stupid wind sounds
---
that is pretty bad, i would suggest getting the dlc and playing him to try and let go of that serious stress.  i mean i know it sounds dumb but i think it may be helpful for you
---
That was a bullshit move... BUT!
---
Can you imagine how fucking cool that would be as an actual Killer? The ability to send out a fake and go invisible? Kinda like Spirit, but you see the fake moving... Wasn't there a character that can do that in Apex Legends?
---
It's not rigged. Notice how the realms which are most common are also the realms which have the most maps to their name. It chooses maps, not realms. So you're more likely to play in a realm which has more maps
---
You can’t outrun the frenzy stun
---
LMAO
---
OP you gotta do a better job than that if you want to self-promote without us noticing.
---
Two wrongs don't make a right.
---
I did play it during a few free weekends. 
---
I absolutely love the concept of the game and the community is pretty great, but I probably wouldn't play it a lot if I bought it.
---
If we can get a Scream-style "whodunnit" story with Legion, definitely them. I really loved their trailer. Something like that. *Plus I really want to see Joey and Susie outfits irl they're so good design-wise*
---
If we're just talking straight up teenage slasher ala Halloween or Friday the 13th, then probably Doctor? I feel like he's definitely the most interesting, with his mind-affecting stuff. And also his look and setting, feels much more SAW than the traditional "trapped in the woods" setting so many slashers have.
---
I have 49 of them on ghostface
---
I get stressy and nervy AF. but i also think, -----well i want the 4k but i guess we both win if i get a 2k.---
---
BUT IF I KNOW IM GOING AGAINST SOME TOXIC ASS SWF I GET NERVY AF AND BRING BBQ, RUIN, NOED , AND THRILL OF THE HUNT.  because they make it seem like a chore to play killer
---
Wot in tarnation
---
I think you didn't get his joke or you got it and thought yours would be funny but it ruined it.
---
I know better, I don't ever trust the killer.
---
The grudge isn't that mainstream 🥴
---
I would have gotten 86/100 if I didn't just full on dumb when I answered two questions. Got 82/100 too. Failed a question on legion, clown and the rest were MTX questsions
---
How and how but with a question mark?
---
Nocturne?
---
Congrats !!!
---
And what would you do, pig is already in a bad place and trasp are barely a threat as it is. It cant explode while your serching a box anyway
---
Wait is their a survey rn?
---
Now THIS is a skin I can get behind!
---
or franklins because i dont need toxic swf carring around 4 loaded toolboxes and insta heal med kits
---
Not all tbags are disrespectful. Against ghostface I do it alot just to talk with them lol.
---
Now you tell me.
---
You actually were in the early days of this game, maybe they reverted back?
---
Party pooper.
---
You only need a few seconds.
---
I think as long as it has something else to lean on as a backup I think the concept could be explored.
---
Lobby
---
What's up with that? I noticed Ghostface working with one survivor this one game and it pissed me off because he let this damn Claudette farm while camping everyone else.
---
Against ghost face is a different story I often t back when playing ghostboi
---
You are free to watch or not watch whomever you want. But you sound like a whiny millennial. lol
---
gj
---
In the discord yes
---
it's a test, you can't earn the rewards anymore. you can find it on their twitter
---
The most dishonest of memes I have ever seen
---
Naw. It's like as soon as someone sees a survivor, they ask everyone 'Is that you coming to the generator?' 'Naw', 'Okay, got the killer on me' - Just like that, you become an M1 killer
---
Im sensing Dagon vibes
---
Huh I thought it was pharmacy because I run wake up and it on my Quentin.
---
A lot of killers are pretty toxic
---
Did it register their death though? That would suck otherwise.
---
This happened in a match I was in but I was ghostface, I exposed 3 survivors at once and they were all looking at the opposite of were I was, meg ran right into my loving arms to get insta downed
---
Killer offered escape cake?!
---
This. You were able to hear the very faint breathing from a survivor in a locker from back in the days and if injured, a whimper
---
I revealed him from a hook the other day. he was over 30 meters away easily, trying to stalk others doing a distraction chase. he turned and looked at me when it happened, so It was definitely me. 
---
later I found that he was running driver's license and another add on that increases distance to reveal. I was unimpressed upon my easy escape.
---
Fuck.  
---
Now I really wish I hadn't wasted 1 million BP on Ghostface hours before they started appearing...
---
Well...they end up back at the campfire with or without a GPS.
---
I agree been playing against him all night and his stalk goes way too fast they just gotta fix the revealing shits iffy
---
Also with the new hatch closing mechanic its better to have wake up and sit at a door for the hatch to close. Killer wont be able to get over and stop you in time.
---
Nah , just dislike douche bags . You sound like someone that hasn’t touched vagina except when you slid out of one :)
---
There’s a hotfix coming soon that will make him a bit easier to reveal. 
---
Other than that, I love Ghostface.
---
Just open the gate for them and Blair witch against a corner. If they want to leave so badly then they can get the fuck out
---
     He is my second favorite killer lore-wise, I still really love legion's. It's just so real and stuff like that can actually happen, they HAVE happened. Apart from everyone going missing to serve the entity eternally.But legion's concept you can make a movie out of. Especially from the legion's perspective. 
---
    Ghostface does seem like one of the more real killers though, and it holds some valuable information on the whole story of this game. With the fact Ghostface's room was getting abnormally hot, it could show the entity rules over some secondary dimension of hell that you musst pass through to get there. It also shows the killers tend to know what exactly what they were summoned for even without being directly told.
---
hes far from OP
---
I know, I don't mean to be rude but we already established it.
---
Spooky pale Japanese ghost girl with long hair is very much a mainstream thing in Japan.
---
Hillbilly, I can see it now as teenagers fuck around in his barn
---
They hear a distant chainsaw and the dumb 'What's that noise' as it gets closet you just see Hillbilly chainsaw through the barn door through one of them and do his killer animation when clicking on him and they just scatter.
---
Im not a survivor main if anything I play more killer.
---
The point is it took weeks to get to bhvrs attention. Why are you saying bhvr is siding with survivors when its only been a day. Bhvr will issue their statement and it absolutely should be the exact same as the legion thing anyone using it should be banned. But shit takes time. For all we know theyre working on a hotfix right now. Either way, when survivors were bitching and DCing over legion it still took weeks before BHVR did anything. Same thing applies. Bug is found, people are abusing it, now you wait until BHVR does something. As I said all that can be done is to make sure they are aware. As far as suggesting tthat BHVR is on the survivors side and saying its bannable for killers and okay for survivors youre a fucking idiot. Plain and simple.
---
That sums up the PS4 experience
---
I tend to have the best luck as survivor on MacMillan Estate and Red Forest. 
---
As Killer probably Red Forest but not any cornfield map. I can't track in the cornfield to save my life.
---
I also hate The Game and Lerys as killer unless I'm doing jumpscare Myers and then I'm just ridiculously OP.
---
Some call this guy a waaahbulance.
---
Stop bitching
---
Surprise, Sydney...
---
I'd love to see a TV show about all the original killers. Have them match up with their survivors after backstory stuff in hour-long episodes or something. Doc would be freaking awesome
---
Oh! Ok! I didn't need to see that!
---
Im playing him and againts him. Trust me hes more than fine. Survivors also breaking my stealth a lot of time behind cover so the whole mechanic is kinda buggy
---
I don’t think he’s too fast. I’ve been able to easily loop him as survivor.
---
Worst map. Shelter woods.
---
I wouldn't say it's great, but it's not garbage. It's useful in chases and if someone is running near you. Sure scratches are helpful, but this allows you to pinpoint exactly where they're at.
---
I agree, same situations would happen to me. Thankful for that hotfix coming soon
---
Who the hell criticized you but didn't tell you Nurse should be Psychic?! She literally has psychic pokemon moves, Teleport and Psychic.
---
"Did... Did you just photobomb my kill?"
---
Come on man I was eating, I didn’t need to see this.
---
The newest one was fantastic.
---
He feels insanely slow when I play him and I have no clue why probably because the way he holds the knife and the way he moves feels fast because trapper just seems like he is fast walking because he got the wrong order from McDonalds.
---
A Danny Phantom meme? A man of culture I see
---
Ring Wraith as a killer would be bad ass
---
Try easing headset, his wooshing is omega loud and directional. When GFs try to use their ability on me in jungle gyms etc I stop looking behind because I know exactly where they are anyway.
---
Woah He’s got that shaggy trim
---
Shit now I need to check somethig
---
I feel for you. He's annoying garbage.
---
Ok, We'll just ignore that at basically every rank Killers have a 50% or Above Kill Rate.
---
Those are the strongest killers but stats indicate all Killers are viable at high levels. However, many Killers consider getting "Only" 2 Kills to not be good enough which is the true problem.  2 Kills is a perfectly fine result for a Killer
---
Oh for sure. Not as good as the original, but still very good- honestly, it’s competing with Infinity War and Hereditary for my favourite movie of 2018.
---
They released the survey they mentioned in the Anniversary Stream earlier today and if you scored more than 90% and completed it in the first hour you got entered into a raffle to win.
---
If you look close it says Pig Mains over the guy getting shot. It's hard to see and this meme is overly complicated for what it's trying to say
---
You make 0 sense whatsoever, but ok, enjoy nurse, billy, spirit every match.
---
Ranking system in a nutshell - You have to stomp to rank up, or you don't get enough points and they all escape, but if you stomp, you also don't get enough points
---
Still haven't seen either of those. I heard hereditary will ruin your night and I'm waiting to get the correct type of weed for that.
---
Seems really shitty do it on the last hour of the double BP when people are still grinding the game.
---
 i hear fractured cowshed is a real nightmare
---
Dude come on this is scarier than the game itself.
---
NSFW tag that shit
---
It’s you who’s out... out of the trial!
---
Uhm, compare the sounds before the update and tell me if this is normal.
---
But you have no benefit from that anyway, imo this perk is pointless. it may be good for newer players maybe?(a lot of question marks).
---
As a killer I tend to be paired with higher rank survivors even though I’m rank 20. The match making can really use some work but going up against better players is only going to make me better too 🤷‍♀️
---
The fact that you list leather face as a killer you hate even more tells me that you're not very skilled at dead by daylight.

Thompson house is the only one halfway decent. Torment creek would be ok were it not for one of the most broken loops in the game. Abbatoir again another extremely broken loop. cowshed is dull and rotten fields is the worst map in the game.

all rewards have been sent already. if you didn't get an email, you sadly didn't get it
---
I don't get it, a flashlight blinds him, but a camera flash (much brighter than a flashlight in my opinion) doesn't phase him?
---
It's even better on console because they have to message you directly in order to talk to you, but you can always turn that off, so that you'll only have to listen to your own self-destructive criticism :)
---
he looks like he's sprinting, trapper looks like he's walking, yet the speed is the same. here's your answer
---
LOL! I love that you called me "dingus." That makes my day!
---
Fuck.
---
I had my hopes up all day.
---
You win some and you lose some I guess.
---
It's actually the opposite and here's why:
---
Trapper walks at 115% mvspeed
---
GF runs at 115% mvspeed.
---
Darker skins for a killer like huntress wouldn't do anything? She still has a big terror radius and she's an absolute unit.
---
Right well funny thing about statistics they're only as good as the data sources they draw off from. You know the data where swf and solos fucking around constantly widely skews them? Kills aren't the point of this post and its funny you mention that 2 kills a match are "Fine" the fucking in-game emblem system will DOWNRANK YOU if you JUST get 2 kills. So obviously 2 fine isn't "perfectly fine".
---
Regardless thats a different topic for another day, what I am talking about is map differences something you can fucking measure, the fact some people are actually arguing this is appalling.
---
Horror movies don’t tend to get me- I like them, hell the original Halloween is one of my favourites movies of all time. But they don’t tend to scare me. But Hereditary... damn. Not a single jumpscare but the finale had me pacing my room to try and keep myself occupied as it was getting unbearable how tense shit got. I’d recommend it for sure. Some great characters and performances, and some really shocking and surprising twists in the story. It’s a damn good movie.
---
Yea recently but before the past year rank 1 was only good players
---
A killer to pallet stun survivors... a weapon to surpass metal gear!
---
Being able to pinpoint a survivor and where they're facing let's you know where they will run to, and where you should approach them from. And it definitely is a better perk for lower ranks, since survivors aren't going to track the killer as well, and the killer can use help knowing where the survivor is. If that's all true it's by definition not pointless.
---
DS is fine. I hope this sub doesn’t turn into the official forums where killers are going on a mission now to get DS nerfed again. It’s ridiculous
---
lmao, this ability is so weird
---
You have to get hooked, unhooked and then downed again within a 40/50/60 seconds of being unhooked for the skill check prompt when you get picked up within that time frame.
---
It got reworked a few patches ago into an anti tunneling perk.
---
I see the community still overrates doctor and underrates wraith.
---
[deleted]
---
I mean technically yes that would happen, the question is whether or not to do it and the obvious answer is fucking yes. Being forced to play 1 of 3 killers out a roster 16 if you want to even have a chance at being competitive is unacceptable. Stagnation KILLS games, everyone complains about the top 3 killers being all they face but they adamantly refuse to accept the changes that will fix the root cause. 
---
Being able to play any of the 16 character and having a chance to win would make the game massively more diverse as killers would play them even if they weren't completely optimal. The difference between now and then is that now if you pick any of them besides the listed 3 your just going to have a no win game. Being able to play all of the killers will increase game diversity its simply a mathematical answer.
---
I figured that but it feels like it and I have no clue but I think that's because they updated the lunge animation to make hits seem more less bullshitty.
---
read what it does
---
Yeah, I mean when they're downed, he animation is them getting up an starting to get away. You throw the hook, it lodges in them, and pulls them to the ground. Boom.
---
They bought the rights to ghostface you swamp muffin.
---
Dear god this is beautifully done great job dude
---
lol this is good but i feel like the way dbd is now, depipping survivors actually makes them happier.
---
Another game called Hide orDie has a fisherman killer with those skills so they might not be able to do that
---
Bit that's exactly what you're suggesting though is making it a pay to win just to get though the grind. Which is part of the game though.
---
That s fair,  don t have any experience on postgamechat because of ps4.
---
That’s true, high ranks suck ass
---
I was really hoping for a tomb raider type survivor with plague. Instead we got  M I S S  T H I C C U M S
---
Iridescent Glock lookin pretty OP if you ask me.
---
someone has posted this for the 75th time since the last patch \\\[T\]/
---
For context I main ghostface. I got 3 iridescent medals this game (his sacrifice would have been 4). I never recorded the game because I'm stupid but I lost 0 points for camping. I always let the last guy escape I'm not a monster.  I had to down him 7 times before I could get him to the hatch.
---
Came here to say this. GIMME THE CANDY BOI
---
Another game already has that killer with all the same ideas. Look up hide or Die if you don’t already know about it.
---
My heart: stops cause of camp and tunnel
---
And cornfields
---
Idk I’d be way more hyped for a warden killer with an indoor/outdoor prison map
---
That's what I said swamp dick
---
Or Shelob from LOTR
---
Jesus
---
Wanted share
---
He has his own game
---
And the survivor is Nosferatu
---
gimme the horseman pls
---
Hey, I agree with ya.
---
"Still" I've never heard of people suggesting it.
---
Well I used to enjoy blood WARDEN and remember me. But no behavior gave me a fat nerf
---
Freddy should be ghost fire
---
Ghostface is what happened when Myers and the Pig had a baby :D
---
I dunno about you but I got 5 million bloodpoints this hunt. Something about 412% SWF groups that makes killers wanna farm.
---
I never told that survivors are always acting out of stupidity and greed
---
I respect your dedication to pig. Have an upvote.
---
I am a simple man, I see a ace i upvote
---
Lifts pant leg, you like?
---
if he doesn't want the hatch, fuck it, kill him.
---
It's fine. But aim assist on pc would kinda be broken if you think about it long enough
---
You can find it on their Instagram my story!
---
At normal hours I just wait 7 min ( average ) on PC.
---
Everytime I get exposed by him my screen freeze for a second...
---
You know I'm fine with people thinking Legion is bad. That's your opinion.
---
But Legion is nowhere NEAR leatherface tier.
---
Atleast Legion has a power. Im going to argue this to the grave, Leatherface is the worst killer in the game.
---
His power is only useful for camping, which is already a terrible strategy.
---
Legion atleast has the ability to get easy first hits, some stall, and good tracking.
---
Leatherface basically has no power. Even Freddy is better than ~~Leatherfuck~~ Leatherface.
---
Yeah I got nurse to 43 and still have nurses calling 1 on her
---
Just stop
---
No one does...
---
nah, havent played nurse in a few days
---
I like your dedication
---
Holy shit that brings back memories
---
Gf can 99% the stalk, so maybe you took longer to expose him than him to expose you due that, every shingle match I get revealed in no time
---
No lies were detected 🤣
---
Ig his ability worked as intended it would be a bit easier. Other than that I've had no pawblem looping him
---
Then I get put against SFW groups.
---
Honestly I would just not unhook during endgame since pretty much everyone has NOED. It’s almost guaranteed you just switch places or even worse the killer gets you both
---
Just Dodge, I do that to keep my sanity
---
COMMENT, SALT.
---
People said there was no counterplay to Legion. That's why they hated him, because he hits them twice in frenzy: DC.  
---
I played against a ghostface, he had these two addons, and honestly, wasn't that hard. Once he builds up the meter, big rip.  
---
By how you're complaining, you must have a biggggg problem with Myers, since he can stalk and get to Tier III, meaning you are exposed. He can down you all with his Tier 3, especially if he has the addon that gives it infinite time.
---
Because it’s trying to find legit newbs to play with
---
It definitely isn’t he’s just being a bit hypocritical
---
Only 24 more to go until 100 let's go boys
---
Just a killer version of open handed?
---
It's pretty weak my dude, giving up a perk slot to buff Nurse's Calling or Deer Stalker seems kinda bad.
---
You animal be ashamed
---
That stab was a goddamned jumpscare
---
14 after the season reset. I'm trying to rank up but every team I'm on only gets two gens done. Once again I'm gonna sound salty and bad af.
---
Do you have any idea how fast am? I’m fast as fuck boiiii
---
Love this, i want to see the artist do an eldritch theme for each killer
---
Every time? If it was a mistake you would’ve learned from it
---
fisherman sounds ok but fuck a pirate that's sounds terrible
---
Its 2019 girls can be named Kyle now
---
I mean, that word describes my parents best.
---
This is so lovely!
---
I got 80% feelsbad
---
Then make your own survive with friends group, with hookers, and blackjack.
---
I got 100, completed it within the first 20 minutes, and didn't get anything. Smh my luck.
---
I guess, but at the beginning it gives you a 20m buff to all perks, with barbecue that would be 60m, 48m for nurses, 68 for I'm all ears, maybe if the numbers were a bug bigger.
---
Dream Eater is a psychic move so good call on making Freddy psychic.
---
Then do what you can for gens and saves and try for the hatch.  It's not that hard to pip at rank 14 my dude.
---
You can go into a match with an afk and just run around for a while
---
It’s barely a nerf my dude. I hate to burst your bubble, but if you hate him this much now, it won’t be much better for you post adjustment.
---
Play swf then if you don't got friends to play with get some.
---
I really dislike survivors who do this on purpose. I’ve seen several running Bond just for this
---
That would actually make bbq worse if it extended the range Lolololol
---
I love this
---
I kinda doubt that bc theyre fine as they are rn but if they do change them that'd be pretty nice
---
Yeah I can see that, same goes for my parents too.
---
Yea just realized that
---
I'll take a pirate survivor, too THANK YOU!!
---
Alright, give me some advice actually, and I'll try another game.
---
I did it
---
No homo tho
---
Ok then.Old ds and mom are fair because killers also had noed.That fair you dumb fuck?
---
You just got bamboozled
---
Yeah but in dbd he's called The Ghost Face
---
Lmao... Fucking stressful ass game
---
Schutzstaffel
---
His model actually runs unlike any other killer that power walks. He seems so fast lol.
---
*Pin-Head wants to know your location*
---
This gives me some serious Cenobite vibes, I NEED IT.
---
I don't know it's good but it's a little slow
---
Well, it's a gradual increase in blindness. An instant flash isn't much more effective than clicking your flashlight at the killer
---
Myers is better till Ghostface does the big jank then Myers is scared for his life
---
If you think he's OP boi you're gonna love Nurse, Spirit, Hag, Billy and Huntress.
---
Meanwhile I've seen two in ten Level 50 survivor bloodweebs

---
Just look at him
---
I mean I threw out the idea of a character who would blend in with survivors but in the process, he would make a random survivor look like him. So if you are just walking with a friend and they suddenly become the killer it might be a bit harder to trust if that's them or not. You give that survivor the red stain/terror radius and suddenly things get confusing.
---
Oh that's lame I want to get more points  :(
---
Thanks for the help
---
Holy shit lol another one of these.
---
This map ain't big enough fer the five of us
---
What about pennywise
---
why does swight's face look so damn wierd?
---
That wouldn't work if you're on mic with the rest of your lobby and you just simply ask, is that you "pizzaboy420yeetyeet" by the cow tree? he says "no" and you sprint burst away.
---
I've had this same issue. I play on Xbox and the average time to find a match is about 8 to 10 minutes. It's a bummer, but it let's me take a small break while I'm queued so it's somewhat nice haha.
---
Welcome to online gaming.
---
Lol, you probably can hit them with 1fps too because you are a skill check master and fps does not matter, right?
---
Hey! I never leave a friend behind!
---
Does anyone know if reinstalling the Game helps?  My connection is pretty wonky and I don't know if committing to downloading it again is worth it.
---
I dont care to get into that argument either, because its not an easy one to have. Completely removing SWF gets rid of some of the playerbase who only wants to play that way, so the people who want it gone aren't thinking about it from a developer standpoint. 
---
However, if they implemented my idea for a change, your argument would be invalid, because typically you'd want to develop your characters for the competitive side of the playerbase, i.e. the people who play ranked, and if you cant SWF in ranked, then theres no reason they couldnt make a killer that would be countered by SWF.
---
Gawd that’s so hawt
---
Same Problem here.
---
I'd love a water themed killer whose Mori has them conjuring up a small bubble of water in the air and drowning the survivor in it.
---
Wraith was most likely tortured by the entity until he was willing to kill again. Plague either started worshipping the entity because her gods abandoned her or the entity tortured her too.
---
I was saying that *most* of the non-DLC maps are good for both sides.  
---
Besides that, the only map that has a really broken main building imo is Asylum, as you can get there from any point in the map.
---
If I’m in a game and everyone threw in cakes, I’ll happily sacrifice myself at the end of the match if I see that the Killer is getting stomped into the ground. 
---
Gotta share the riches.
---
Play with your food could be the only reason other then a placebo effect
---
I gotta agree that people who have trouble with Ghostface in general must have lots with Myers because the counterplay is the same for both pretty much. Look around you can listen for footsteps or grass not that hard guys
---
There is a casual non ranked mode, Kill Your Friends.
---
I have 3000+ hours in this game and I dare say I went against ANY kinds of survivors. My point stands.
---
Nice vid
---
Get spirit fury if you haven’t already
---
Add some salty comments and dcs
---
You say it like bringing NOED or any of the listed perks is a bad or toxic thing... which is not.
---
Ah, yes, the game mode that doesnt have matchmaking, you have all the perks and items unlocked and unlimited, and you cant earn anything.
---
Clearly you understand what I am saying. /s
---
We need a Bigfoot or a Yeti
---
They stopped saying that a while ago. It's best to assume all stack unless stated otherwise
---
but then you get SWF every game and because you don't have ruin on your main you get gen rushed and destroyed every game no matter how many hooks and downs you get. Also because you used to main survivor you don't wanna camp or tunnel so you play fairly making you get 0 kills in the end and only getting harassed for not being able to counter Survivors holding M1 for about 30 seconds for every gen.
---
not really. I was able to hit them on my old pc which couldn't run on 20 fps tho
---
Might as well share it since I found out I'm not eligible for the contest *only after* I drawed it.
---
Can we get a chad meme picture for this, imagine the green zone as chad glasses
---
Ability: Hook downed survivors on his hand.
---
That'd be broken lmao
---
Survivors do not have a single perk at this point post Decisive and MoM rework that remotely compares to the crutch factor of NOED.  You literally gameplan for failure everytime you bring it in game.  It rewards you for playing terribly.  Terrible design just like Decisive and MoM USED to be before they were reworked.  
---
I agree 100% Ruin is perfectly fine and balanced but NOED is simply a safety net for inexperienced killers to cover up the deep flaws in their chasing and gen pressure (or complete lack of) game.
---
Theres counter play, you're just bad
---
Or you are a lazy survivor and refuse to learn new mechanics
---
Nice!!
---
Sharp Rock
---
All of these sets look fantastic! Have you considered making a green set? a Neon green would look amazing on the perks ! :D
---
Lol, I love your parents
---
Like I said, idea. Survive with friends is something Killers don't get a counter for since we can't just bring multiple killers into a match unless through a glitch. It's why so many of us want a 2v8 freddy vs jason style mode. I think a mimic character in that mode would be hilarious when you trick your fellow killer and yell at them for saying "Boy you messed up my ambush!"
---
Power: Capn’ Crunch
---
Mows through the entire map in a giant ass boat, causing immeasurable property damage.
---
You should just kill everyone forget that shit
---
BIG IRON ON HIS HIP!
---
Agreed. I've had a situation where a Claudette made a very dumb move in front of me (continuing to work on a gen while I was charging her), I grabbed her off of it to hook her on a hook a few feet away, and she DS' me. It allows recently unhooked survivors to be too cocky because they know they have a get out of jail free card, and punishes killers who try to punish them for those mistakes.
---
Especially if it's him from "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer," where the hook was his hand.
---
When you do, run Save the Best for Last. 
---
Sooooo satisfying to stack up those quick post-hit wipes.
---
That's my favorite outfit of hers, I can't slaughter survivors if I don't feel pretty.
---
this is a terrible idea.
---
All three confirmed.
---
\*Teleports behind you\*
---
Nothing personnel, kid!
---
I laughed so hard at 3-4 business days &lt;3
---
Not sure if you’re aware of this but career streamers generally aren’t the most mature people, hence why they play videogames for a living
---
HAHAH this is so true, it's so fun though. My first match against him I was lucky to have equipped spine chill that very match to switch things up and it was so scary because spine chill wouldn't turn off and I was looking around and couldn't see anyone. Thought it was ghostface hiding somewhere so I moved behind a rock and a second later it goes off again, I look around again and see this face staring at me lmao, then bam! exposed effect
---
Quick question. Does the ghost face mori actually take a screenshot?
---
Chicken legs yeah, but have you seen those arms? He can break you like a pen haha
---
Those sweaty killers running good perks. What a bunch of tryhards.
---
Ok, but Devour is definitely worth it as well dude. XD 
---
Side Note: Hag is fun as hell to play.
---
Angry pug is a scumbag. I’m not surprise about the perk. He also derank as a killer so he can use he’s basement build against rank 12-14 survivors. Him having thousands of hours so yeah idk how people like him. He’s a cock of a person
---
This is true
---
Yeah he's all upper body. He needs a better workout routine I think.
---
What is your argument fuckface. Someone just disconnect from a match after bring first downed?
---
Monto would like a word about those Moris
---
I’m scared to ask what P3 means
---
just play myers. he's easy
---
I got one killer (freddy) who wanted to farm when I was soloing. The other three survivors were a swf and wanted me dead so i got practically no objective points and barely even single pipped. I got a good bit of BP because there was 3 gateaus and 2 bps but not nearly as much as I should have. Luckily killer was nice and didn't want to kill me.
---
Fuck that swf though, I was trying to be nice to them and i used my bloody party streamers on them and as thanks they try to get me killed. Toxic.
---
No I’ve met some really nice streamers in this community, but him, he’s just something else. Every time I go on his stream his either bitching about the killer, or bullying another minor again.
---
if there was ever one, probably be related to flies and maggots.
---
Lol don’t be afraid. It means prestige 3, just meaning they have all three of the bloody cosmetics (Claudette’s used to be like camo)
---
&gt;any of you guys experienced this?
---
Please fully read the post before commenting 👍
---
&gt;new killer in September 
---
&gt;borderlands 3: *no*
---
Do you like fanfics? Check out r/dbdgonewild
---
He is not wrong. Any streamer would ban you from their channels. 
---
Why would you go to someone's channel and tell them what to do? Especially if you never said anything before. Kids these days.
---
Not satisfied with what happened and instead of moving on, you decided to waste even more time making this pathetic thread. 
---
Good job. 
---
Maybe you should look at one of those twitch etiquette guide before making yourself look like a fool again.
---
A road roller.
---
yeah he is, I’m surprised that anyone even watches his streams anymore, he has a bad vibe, has no life, thinks he’s the shit when he’s a nobody, and is just utterly mean to people and feels free to call them names. He’s also a fucking hypocrite, when people call him an adult that plays video games he responds “oh yeah adults video games *cuss* plus I don’t play dbd that much, I’m not playing video games all the time, when in reality he’s a devotion 13...
---
What gen pressure do you get against a swf while running wraith? Zero. He's the only one I use noed on. What does wraith have for a chase. Try killer at high ranks and talk to me later.
---
Legion is good, change my mind
---
What the fuck are you saying shithead?Learn proper English before actually starting arguments.
---
Balanced, as all things should be
---
I haven't tried distortion. I'll give it a try.
---
So *I* can have my Killer that looks like a Survivor? I dont care about a Killer that can blend in. 
---
I just wanted to hear other peoples ideas for them, because as you said, its suggest often, and you came in here with no ideas, just a qualm about how SWF breaks the concept, to which I countered there would be a good fix for that, regardless of whether or not its viable, its still a very easy way to give the people that dont want SWF their non-SWF lobbies. 
---
Realistically, if you wanted to complain that another separate game queue would split the community too much, why not give killers the ability to filter players that join them to not including a SWF of a certain size and larger. I.e: I pick Wraith, select that I am fine with SWF's of only two players, and SWF's that are three or four players cant join my lobby. 
---
I mean, back to the idea of the split queues, from what I've seen, no one even cares about their rank anyway, so the casual mode would be perfect for a good majority of the community, while the crybabies that hate SWF lobbies can go complain about something else. 
---
This is just a discussion thread. I'm not suggesting the overused idea of the killer that blends in with survivors. I probably wouldnt even play him if they ever made one, I'd rather do Wraith, or Hag. I was just interested in hearing some people pitch their ideas, since its not like I scan this thread every single day and read every suggestion thats already come up.
---
I mean i have the game and can play it anytime...but i just dont wanna
---
This is the huntress after they kept adding shit maps for her and she has had enough
---
Why shouldn't the killer be dominant? Survivors were dominant for 2 years and they have zero weapons. It's time for killers to take their place at the top even if it hurts survivors ego and pride.
---
She turned into raspberry jam!
---
Also "Tunnel = UR GAY" and he disconnected. I love survivors like this when I play killer.
---
Meanwhile I get insta-heal SWF who won't burn the damn thing on my first run as ghostface with two perks.
---
Due to the new killer DLC it creating longer wait times for Killers. Yes everything you are seeing is normal.
---
If they did this obviously bbq would not be affected as the range is backwards (as in it doesn't function when they are too close)
---
Spirit was a freebie
---
Making assumptions when you lose an argument nice.What can I expect from a dumb fuck like you.
---
Np! Enjoy!
---
I dont understand why people watch him the first place...he's on his way to being Ochido.
---
They also said they werent gonna add talking characters, yet here we are with Ash and Plague
---
Yes, I’m pretty sure it defaults to F12 or something.
---
Idiot-person-whos-making-himself-look-like-an-idiot Rage.
---
&gt;I Know What You Did Last Summer killer
---
This supposed to be a reference to the scream TV show?
---
My brother put this on and trapped me in the bathroom. I still cry when I see this :^(
---
Yep you can check the forums. Basically making some of his add-ons weaker and spotting him I believe 8% easier. May not seem like alot but it could be.
---
He’s worse, and if he doesn’t contain himself, I can see him ending up in jail.
---
Ii is bot the must fun thing for survivors. But a smart survivor will counter it and at least it is not tunneling.
---
Might as well be me right there, although it's not me.
---
With Pig and GF, we found the solution to end toxicity. Just give all Killesr the power to teabag.
---
Yeah, he's easily the worst of the streamers. I don't like the "adult man acting like 12 year old child" style personality. At the end of the day, just shrug it off, don't let an idiot like that get to you. There's a great deal of wholesome streamers out there, and most times it's definitely better to go without than to watch AP.
---
Too bad one of the questions doesn’t actually answer right. The one where It asks “which perk is Jeff’s teachable?” And even if you answer discordance, it counts it as a no. I still passed but it was a little annoying.
---
Nah..Ochido asked for underage pics from girls he's worse.
---
being 17 means you know what you are doing, and mentioning it makes it look like you're just trying to put him in some sort of legal trouble tbh.
---
Doctor is super strong on small maps. Try going against a Dr. Worldwide with a Jigsaw Piece.
---
Discordance is a Legion perk?
---
Weenie hut jrs are recruiting check them out bro !
---
1. I don't want to wait 10 millions years for a killer game. 
---
2. I would rather good killers be rewarded than bad killers who play poorly all game but manage to snowball off an instadown because of a crutch perk.
---
before you showed the lagswitch or bug i thought i was tripping when ghostface was suddenly on the other side because i blinked and didn't see him pull a hoodini
---
Yea you right. I’m retarded though so I’m still annoyed
---
I’m not, I’m just saying that bc he’s a grown ass man in his 40s that’s making fun of teenagers and making himself look like an idiot in the process. I just need to know what kind of person would watch his streams.
---
Unfortunately for the time being I've had to stop making perks, I can't afford Photoshop for at least a little while, but there are some nice creators on r/PerkByDaylight that you might like. :)
---
Honestly leatherface is a pretty good dlc especially for newer players. He's pretty easy to play and BBQ and C is a fantastic perk. Not to mention it's nice and cheap
---
&gt;Most people ik just close the news tab when it pops up.
---
Well, whose fault is that? Certainly not BHVR. People should always at least take a quick look at those news.
---
Is not like you have to go out of your way to read them, they literally pop in your face.
---
Wdym
---
Holy fuck, are you serious. I didn’t know that, I don’t keep up with the ochido drama, heard his voice once, never wanna hear it again...
---
Hehe
---
Perhaps forcing the next actions to be slowed, the hindered or exhausted effect being put on them even.
---
It's cool, your "friend" got to play the best killer!
---
If it’s broken whenever you use it, what use it it to keep them available for use?
---
Not to mention, it’s an unnecessary detail on top of an already unnecessary post. 
---
Not to defend Pug or anything, but I doubt he can magically know OP is 17.
---
Yeah...man we all shun him.
---
The new Halloween was the best possible sequel that could have been.
---
You didn't even make an argument you absolutely brain dead retard. You said a statement and that's it. I bet you're stuck in rank 15 cause you keep losing pips to disconnects.
---
That's a joke, you put a smaller version of a person next to a person and put the caption "don't talk to me or my son ever again" it's a meme
---
what do u need to get an A again? i only got 84 cause i rushed it
---
He's just so sick of the Shack loop he starts bingbonging in frustration.

Thank you but is this during normal time or bloodhunt time?

ILl Be tOxIc wITh My flAshliGHt
---
The way you act makes you look like a child. Act how you want to be treated.
---
Its fine to use the perk up until the point you realize its bugged and giving a huge advantage then continue to use it. I dont see how that can be argued. Nobody can use an exploit knowingly without being guilty.
---
Best dbd meme I’ve seen
---
*too bad I don't have anyone to play with*
---
I also have split feelings about SWF because on one hand as a survivor it helps a lot if the killer is a toxic camper and tunneler, but on the other hand it's super annoying as a killer to get looped and genrushed by people in rank 8 better (I'm rank 13 as killer) I played 2 rounds of Doctor for the first time and both rounds I got full squad swf who'd constantly run up in my face to distract me, flashlight in my face and body block. Super annoying until I slugged and got 4k on the first and 2k on the second game.
---
Nurse is B tier, put the rest in F
---
Haha that's funny
---
SWF bringing in cakes because they know their chance of success is huge, because they're abusing a broken bug, as well as bringing in insta-medkits. The fact that he didn't use cake was luck, not greed, if anything
---
That's true but good survivors vs a good killer will always win and that's the problem. As a killer you have to wait for a mistake or a brain dead survivor. At high ranks it's stopping bring skill and becoming just a hope to get an anti vaxxer in the game so you have an easier time.
---
Even if most killers are map dependent, Huntress is literally the only killer which isn't allowed to play on certain maps.
---
Huh, I leveled my doctor from 1 to 19 during the last 2 hours and I got 10 of them
---
If by strong, you mean super tedious to play against, then yes. He is "strong".
---
Okay at current time of writing this comment the upvotes are at 666 and this is a good meme but i dont want to upvote. What do I do?
---
Update: Replaced plumber's instinct with adrenaline and the other one with alert, the perk from the Chinese girl which I find really useful.
---
Pugs always been an asshole. Almost all of the big DBD streamers are garbo human beings. Just block them on twitch, and MLGA block them ingame. Never need to see them again.
---
Doesn't matter if the killer gets minimal points because survivors are abusing everything they can. It's not earned, it's not deserved, and it shouldn't be treated with any form of courtesy
---
Do unto others as you wish others to do unto you. These guys were dicks, why are you trying to say they deserve more?
---
most of them are bug fixes and the two nerfs arent nerfs at all, . get ghostface he is not over powered he is very fun and an actual viable killer
---
A good killer will just hide the stain anyway. It's not much different.
---
Clown was underated a bit, and I know this is controversial but, I think freddys b tier
---
Playing videogames for a living makes you immature, huh?
---
Could say the same about footballers...
---
[I cut it off intentionally to make a joke though](https://i.imgur.com/CtQfqhQ.png)
---
Survivors: wah stop camping
---
Also survivors: pallet looping the killer in the same exact circle for 10 minutes is a fair and legitimate strategy.
---
I want to see Plague puking in somebody.
---
This hurts me OKAY?! Stop making me cry!
---
Hook hand as his weapon or a cutlass. Power having something to do with cursing generators or even a cursed status effect after a special attack. Undead pirate captain right now.
---
I've been a rank 1 killer like 12 times and I don't run NOED on anyone.  I love the assumption that just because I don't support running a crutch that only serves to stunt a killers development of better play.  Play killer without it and it will force you to make better decisions midgame.
---
This is also what happens when you're stuck in low rank hell with shitty campers and potato teammates.
---
What about steam?
---
"Only" as if 10 percent isn't incredibly significant.
---
I’m shit at chases and I had a Spirit lagswitch to catch me at the pallet near the cowshed. I just shook my head because if she couldn’t catch ME then she’s never gonna improve.
---
Its a fair point, but I didnt claim that my idea solves all issues past, present and future.
---
It does, however, remove SWF without removing it completely. And people wouldnt "DC to not lose their rank" because if they have a rank, they are playing ranked, and DCing would still make them lose their rank
---
Shoulda been legion :(
---
This is why I want his interaction with object changed. It neuters him and everyone is running it because people are trying to learn how to play him. I will, without fail, tunnel anyone directly into hell if they're running object. I won't face camp you but I will ignore literally everything else until you're dead so I can get back to having fun.
---
Yeah, it's terrible
---
He’s technically licensed.
---
Right now he is because he is very new but I can see later on people not enjoying him at all. People always say this when new stuff gets released then after awhile they say he's boring and unfun. I prefer waiting until a week or two after release then see what happens
---
Doctor still isn't Electric Psychic?
---
Thank you for not running Object of Depression. People run that annoying ass perk and then bitch at me in post game chat when I dunk them immediately with an ivory mori.
---
Hag is S tier. Billy's a tier. A good hag doesn't get looped.
---
Ghost face is glorified mycle Myers thAt can crouch
---
That's exactly what I got :)
---
He's not versatile. He has no enhanced mobility, does not against pallets and doesn't have any better defensive capability than anyone else.
---
Given his extremely lack of map pressure, "gen rushing" happens in every game anyways.
---
LOL, wish I had more farming lobbies. I had maybe 3 farming games all together (I was killer of 1 of those matches). The rest were all mories and try hards....like you don't have to farm but there's no reason to sweat and try hard on a double bp event. If you REALLY wanna play like an asshole fucking wait till after the event.
---
I feel like they're gonna vault them after the event lol
---
You monster
---
It’s funny because I’ve fucked up so many pallet drops this weekend, and every time the killer has just been like “...alright let’s farm, you’re no threat to me”
---
OH-O, then come as close as you would like
---
Must be John Cena under that mask
---
That’s true we don’t what would be his ability?
---
He's a journalist. He probably has a darkroom.
---
Yeah... no. He's OG Myers. You need to watch the new movie again.
---
This is a good meme 😂
---
Already had someone else tell me to stfu ingame and reference my reddit lol 
---
I wonder what about Oinking makes them so mad...?
---
Unrelated but what’s your keyboard it looks sick
---
Maybe it’s human Charles lee Ray instead of the doll! And he could have a little chucky figurine on his belt loop or something
---
*oink* Who knows? ;-;
---
Killed me straight after because I couldn’t stop laughing
---
Oh i didn't know. Is David?
---
What a sick move!
---
Am I the only one that actually thinks they should make a mask for ghostface that pours blood as the terror radius gets louder for the survivor? I think that it would be cool in general but has an added in-game effect.
---
I have so many toxic chats in xbox, I probably should start a collection
---
they have to pay a % of sales to the license owners
---
Very rarely do I have a red rank game where I felt like I couldn't win. I can almost always reflect back on mistakes that could've swung it in my favor. Bad red stain handling. Incorrect jungle gym paths. Not remembering which pallets were used. 
---
Good survivors win if they play perfectly but that never happens. Even the best survivors make a lot of mistakes and I'm constantly having to recognize it.
---
He's a low rank pubstomper with a new mechanic. When Freddy was added to the game people had your attitude. Now he's a joke. Despite my love for him, GF is going to end up the same. Survivors have already adjusted to him (above rank 15 anyways) and it's only going to get worse. If you dont know how to loop or haven't figured out the spotting mechanic, then I can see why he'd be giving you issues. But that has less to do with the killer (bugs notwithstanding) or more to do with your own ability.
---
Darn, I thought you were the guy who also made Doc with a Glock for a second
---
When was this ever asked for
---
Also, survivors need a wave emote for friendly killers
---
Too bad he sounds like a stupid ass wind tunnel when he gets within striking range.
---
It's a shame they don't like us having our fun, I guess being toxic is theirs
---
I prefer ours :p
---
Basically 15% boost to everything instead of just gates
---
okay, thats definitely fair.  counter point: his play style is a combination of other fun killers  while still having his own interesting gameplay nd with the viability he has against survivors- i truly think that people will  have alot of fun  with him with all the different play styles he has
---
Your Father knows what’s up. Except Huntress &gt; Spirit.

Its a bug, right?

Yep Jane just sounds like she just had the biggest orgasm of her life and Jeff sounds like a fucking school fire alarm with how loud he sounds.
---
Only non-Licensed killers can be bought with shards - Plague, Legion, etc. 
---
Licensed cannot Myers, Freddy, Ghost Face, Etc.
---
How to avoid X killer: play the killer hole. That side you can dictate who is the killer
---
Wake Up and Prove Thyself is a dangerous combo. Wake Up affects all survivors actions including vaulting.
---
Definitely because I don't think they want 10 second generators
---
Slick.
---
Its blood party but better. This cake give you 103% bp 
---
Myers far outstrips Ghost face. Not a remotely unpopular opinion. GF just has a more active playstyle with more versatility imo, so I prefer him.
---
I barely play killer but I’m not even going to try the achievements until the dedicated servers and disconnect punishments roll out
---
You wouldn't be wrong.   Popularity + Money  usually equals cunt personality.
---
I would assume no, as it doesn't say it stacks
---
I had a game exactly like that a few days ago😂
---
Pug is a adult person trying to look badass to his chile specs, pathetic
---
Now that is really epic :D
---
We got seige over here
---
Idk, I kinda want that head FOR the hair😅
---
I definitely think he will be fun since he is a combination of Micheal and the pig kinda but to me he doesn't have alot of variety besides fast stalks, fast recovery, and fast crouch speed. For perks I don't see him have alot either because he can't really vault pallets or just deny them like nurse and clown.
---
Nice design but she looks like a completely different killer.
---
Keep in mind that most streamers are fucking losers that can’t handle the real world and are too stupid to finish high school, so they turn to games and spend 5 years of their early 20s trying to become “Twitch famous” while still living with their parents.
---
Career streamers are scum in general. Just look at Ochido, Pewdie, and Dr. Disrepect.
---
I love that you have so much free time that you waste on kids complaining, what a fully mature adult you are, huh?
---
100% me right now...I haven't even played the game in weeks
---
I'm a killer main, but recently started playing more survivor with my friends. Now I know why "toxic" survivors act the way they do. So many killers trapping survivors in the game and just generally being mean.
---
I'm always worried about wasting the perk slot. The survivors I deal with tend to scatter and work on gens alone.
---
Oh, okay yeah... that sounds fun...
---
On the official forums they said you can still use them.
---
People are abusing that too... woohoo! I love our community!
---
Its boring af yet what you expect them to do, drop every pallet instantly? But then they shouldnt cry out of their lungs if the killer camps a survivor so he can at least secure a kill. Also some big houses like on haddonfield next to the basement stairs are just giant fucking loops and shouldnt exist. You literally cant do anything besides vaulting the window 3x for the survivor to go somewhere else. These are hot garbage and i dont think they should be in the game
---
someone has posted this for the 21st time since the last patch \\\[T\]/
---
Oink&gt;everything else.
---
This idea seems seamless for what's already in the game.
---
99 the doors and look for the totem if you're so concerned. Just cause you aren't running BT and don't know how to take a hit doesn't mean that's the case for the other survivors left.
---
Like watching dbd stream but not from the killer perspective. That's boring as hell 'cause you don't feel any tension since you can't get killed.
---
Watching survivor is cool tho.
---
3% tastier then a escape cake
---
Guess I’m wrong, I’m just going off what others have told me.
---
Ya damn right imma wear thi claudette dress with pride.
---
what do you want them to do?
---
1. There's a addon (too opn IMO) that you need to be licking his leather boots to spot him.
---
2. He needs to be focused, so if he downs, you have to down your camera too
---
3. GF resets "spot time" if you him off the center, so he can crouch a lot while stalk, iff you aren't fast enough, the time will keep reseting and he will expose you
---
I played as GF alot by now, and even in low ranks (I'm 12) and I just can't keep my steatlh in open sight chase (only in T walls and stuff)
---
With the red trail and blood lust losing the killer as the lone survivor is hard and juking does work constantly. Wish it did tho. And I cant be too patient or the collapse will get me eventually.
---
Git Gud.
---
Clown should be higher, his power is based around ending chases faster.
---
If this isn't chosen, there is no justice in the world. I might actually main huntress if this happens lol
---
Had to double check and make sure I wasnt in the For honor subreddit
---
Way better if your used to kbm.
---
So you need specific perks, add-ons and a map offering to make Doctor viable ? Witn these, even Freddy is viable ...
---
I was getting a more Total Drama Island vibe.
---
Shortly after, he saw black mist and amber.
---
Only after a Vampire killer &gt;:(
---
More than likely
---
Depens on if you're used to k&amp;m. If you play games on pc, not so hard. If you've never played on pc, probably a bit harder.
---
This game is so trash, but instead of fixing, devs are busy buffing killers lol, how pathetic is that.
---
Hey buddy, I might have this broken perk. You need to do this sequence of time consuming pieces to counter it, and hope your team of strangers contribute towards that goal, but hey, there's also a chance I don't have that perk. I guess you won't find out until it's too late. Don't forget to do this sequence every game just to be safe!
---
Not bitch about 1 shitty way of play while doing another? Not that hard. Killer camps=easy escape for 3/4
---
I haven't played on pc for about 2 years
---
This is really bad for two reasons. First, you camera has to change position significantly when you are in close quarters, often moving closer to the character model. This means that obstructed portion of the view is not consistent during a match, and essentially outside player control. Second, if this is based on the characters visual model, then it won't be consistent across characters either. David King's upper body is a lot wider than Claudette's.
---
Yep, you can now do generators in 20 seconds with brand new part and prove thyself I believe
---
I think maybe they should remove the whole survivors breaking his stalk by looking at him and change it to where he can only stalk on survivors while not in chase? I think that would make it easier to stalk on survivors but there’s still a counter too it.
---
I just cannot for the life of me see how those 2 things are that comparable unless the exits are powered of course. but that is my opinion
---
Exactly that. If you are going to whine about a shitty way to play, dont turn around and do another shitty way to play.
---
Yeah... how are you going to prove they did it intentionally though? This game totally doesn't have a replay system and it's far too easy to just say 'I didn't know.' This isn't like the infinite mending glitch where you have to do a specific set of conditions, this is literally using one perk.
---
There's no way anyone's getting banned from this, they'll have to push out a patch as quickly as possible.
---
I want these so bad.
---
Yeah but like what do you expect to gain from people saying they have
---
who honestly knows how the devs think honestly. this event has just been very disappointing at least for me
---
Legion is completely bearable nowadays. Don't know what you are talking about.

to easy to counter now and not much benefit its shit now lol
---
Literally same. Survivors dont help us out.
---
I would love to have a Lovecraftian/Eldritch-inspired killer, one that, in the lore, truly is the most terrifying thing that you could face
---
They have in the past
---
I personally can't think of a perk to take it's slot, (my GF is Spirit Fury, Enduring, Ruin, Discordance) since he already has stealth, a one hit, and decent tracking built in. Maybe Surveillance since you're trying to sneak up on survivors?
---
But I do have games where survivors don't work together, GF can handle that though. When you have 1 hooked if you use stealth and start going to another gen you'll see scratch marks of survivors running towards the hook. Usually they notice you if you start chasing but sometimes they don't and you can get another marked hit.
---
Try Identity V, it has porno movie like sounds
---
I don't know if it's because he's wack or new but no matter how long or where I share at him from he still gets the stalk off
---
Good idea...get rested. You'll need it. ;)
---
Makes even more sense considering that the mask has a big grin on it.

Why censor out perks in general lol..

* Decisive will last 60 seconds unless killer has hooked someone else while not in dying state
---
I thought he was 13-15 crying for something so stupid lmao.
---
Yeah it’s broken. It sucks too because I actually loved using Wake Up but i had to take it off cause of the bug.  I’ve had plenty of games where I only escaped because of the faster opening time or my teammates only escaped because they saw my aura. But you’re a scumbag if you abuse the glitch lol
---
Actually, no. you need to enter your player ID, which is supposedly at the bottom-left part of your screen.
---
So killers arent allowed to play the kilelr they want to?
---
ah shit I did it wrong
---
These bullies don't know the difference in spelling between your name and "Aryan". What imbeciles lol!
---
I just put my gamertag
---
It's mainly for consistency, as most of my posts I have them covered. Although on this video they (my perks) are pretty standard, most of my other videos have pretty weird/bad builds that distract from the initial post.
---
I really want Brenda added. She'd forever be the only survivor I play. Especially if she gets voice lines from scary movie.
---
What was the og post?
---
Once you get used to KBM again, it’ll be so much better for you. Accuracy of a mouse is great.
---
Ok fair enough
---
It's cool as fuck, but it looks like she's dead.
---
Good one?
---
More of this plz. I love how much BHVR love dbd.
---
Possible dumb question but does Pewdie=Pewdiepie?
---
Now this is Hela cool.
---
Trapper: Fuck yes, I didn't get bugged this time!
---
No. I’m not. They’re ranked in terms of how easy it is to kill the survivors. You should join your high school debate team because you’re fucking awful at this.
---
Oh look a Quentin. I wonder what perks you’re running 🙄
---
I thought that'd be a cool idea for a Smoker killer
---
I would start playing plague for this skin...
---
Youtuber who does glitches
---
Over 1200 hours and I still play with controller on PC. Makes it harder as killer but I enjoy it more so it is what it is.
---
I missed the last two days because of homework and exams.
---
Ruin is least effective at higher ranks lol. Survivors can hit the skill checks or know the totem spawns. Lower ranks will struggle with the checks or spend forever running around the map and they already struggle more against killers.
---
Obviously, I filled all 4 of my Perk Slots with "Wake up"
---
Honestly why i gave up playing as a killer
---
I’ve noticed while playing him that if you turn really quickly towards the direction you’re being looked at from it often times breaks them taking you out of stealth
---
&gt;Maybe you should look at one of those twitch etiquette guide before making yourself look like a fool again.
---
Stop with the nonsense. AngryPug overreacted here. If he disliked it, he could say "please don't say things like that or else you'll get banned". My issue with Pug's actions here(excluding the stated harassment) is that there was no warning.
---
I bet they accused you of camping
---
I think it make be a berderuku refaransu!?!
---
Like noob3, or hybridpanda?
---
Make demon survivor too lol
---
But like half the pirate is the dialogue and DbD killers cant speak
---
Legion had no counter, just run foward, GF have a really easy one, those survivors will have to force that salt throat down

\-Get to close as 0 bloodpoints possible.
---
\-Use the 103% cakes and count how many games it takes you to get to 1mil bp (max). 
---
\-See how many cakes it will take you to prestige.
---
\-Every time you spend your bp just spend them on characters other than ghostface.

\-Save enough 103% cakes that will let you get your ghostface to max prestige and level.

Enjoy the free level ups on your other characters that needed it. And  you got max ghostface!

Don’t tunnel me off hook/facecamp/slug me. Then double BP doesn’t matter, because I’m not gonna get any anyways.
---
&gt;  Just a bunch of camping. 
---
Camping is a shit strategy, though, so you should be doing well in those matches, no?
---
If you’re lookin for somebody to watch that isn’t complete garbage, I’d recommend Farmer John or No0b3, they’re both really nice guys and their streams are really nice to listen to (minus the times on No0b3s when his chat sends spam messages that the bot has to read out for a million years lmao)
---
Exactly. Also very good now since with the pallet changes from a while back, not all pallets are guaranteed, so knowing where some didn't spawn (esp on maps like Corn) can be huge.
---
OH HELL YES!
---
Shout out to Third Seal for carrying me when I didn't have good perks on Legion
---
The point is that you can see auras through walls while in a chase. It isn't made to find survivors, it is made to mindgame them where they can't see you.
---
The perk shows a maximum of three tokens, even if you hook all four survivors.
---
yeah, like nurse
---
Nice thanks
---
Did they say this in the live stream or was it in the patch notes?
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/70679/dead-by-daylight-is-officially-coming-to-mobile-this-2019
---
I was so tempted to flair this as "Gameplay"
---
It's completely useless, why would I want to get a splinter to killer, which I already own? It always pisses me off, I hope that BHVR will fix that. Splinters are only ok if you aren't sure if you want to buy a new killer but you can test it thanks to splinters, in other cases for me, its useless
---
That's not what I said of course, but if you have trouble with an M1 killer it's absolutely on you. There is a reason killers reliant on foot chase -&gt; 2x basic attack are pretty much universally considered low tier.
---
Trailer could use more Oinks...
---
Perfection :D
---
Can't stop won't stop
---
As a red rank killer who plays quite a bit of Freddy, he is not more effective than bubba and legion. First off Leatherface can down multiple survivors at once and can be quite a threat. Granted it can be countered by running round a corner but at least he can end chases before they begin (unlike Freddy) 
---
And legion is a decent all round killer if played well. Legion can slow the game down, track fairly well, decent map mobility and good chase potential. He’s not a great killer but he isn’t that bad.
---
Freddy can’t counter loops. If you play a killer that can’t counter loops or don’t have a built in insta down at high ranks then be prepared for a high number of multi-gen chases. Freddy’s only saving grace is his tracking but even that isn’t that insanely good, and tracking doesn’t mean much considering most survivors run object. Plus if you run bbq and chilli you can get freddys built in ability anyway for a few seconds.
---
So true
---
She literally deny every aspect in this game,loops, pallets, mind game, even if nurse had no perk it would be fine yet
---
I switched from console to pc and tried kbm, but IMO it was too difficult for me. (I’ve been playing console all my life) so I just decided to play controller. Helps me tbh.
---
Stop it. Don't make me depressed. I'm already like 43 level on him, and still didn't see even BBQ on 1st level. Thank god I already have ruin on 3rd level cause I would literally have to make prestige on him
---
*-squishy entity noises-*
---
Oh, I did not see that
---
Don’t you mean killer mrs trunchbull
---
All I want is that ballerina outfit for feng min to come now
---
Apparently wake up is bugged to effect everything, and not just exit gate opening speed. Also the average survivor rank here is 4.5 vs a rank 10 killer, so there's that too.
---
Mind explaining the Wake Up bug? Haven’t played this game in a few weeks. 
---
Oh, and Pug can be very whiny and immature, I wouldn’t let it bother you. At least you see him for what he is
---
I hope that they do something about it too.  It totally spoils the game.  Sometimes, as killer, I feel bad for the other survivors and feel that I can't play properly or want to give them extra points.  
---
What do other killers do?  Should I just get over it and play normally?!  At least I'd get to the next game sooner, probably the survivors are thinking that too?
---
Anyone who says he says he's op hasn't played him enough. get him man.
---
My country (Italy) for some reason is excluded from the contest.
---
Now I hope they will add 3x Bloodpoints or just Holidays' event
---
K
---
He's low-tier because his chainsaw doesn't do much; you can't pull off any big plays consistently; he's got no consistent snowballing potential, nor does he have a good power to help him in chases.  
---
The best perks on Leatherface are BBQ&amp;Chili, Enduring, Ruin, Spirit Fury/Utility perk.  
---
Franklin's Demise is *not* a good perk, as it doesn't do anything that helps you with either tracking or chases; it just makes survivors drop their item, which isn't that useful.
---
I had deep phobia with clowns, my luck is that clown is really shitty and people don't play him, but when they do, my hands shake and I get really stressed, usually I just quit the match
---
The first time I hit Rank 1 was with Bubba and some Freddy. You should use charge addons on Bubba and anti-looping perks (Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring) for maximum success.
---
You've just entered Backrooms in Dead By Daylight. Congratulations!
---
shit
---
The timer isn’t long enough for this in most cases
---
If the killer has whispers 3 then RIP. Otherwise not a bad strat at all.
---
Yeah, i can barely tell if I am getting chased at all besides the heartbeat.
---
I’d pay a lot for this. Maybe then would people fear the vommy mommy
---
I can't even tell what happened
---
I think you should stop taking drugs, it's getting worse.
---
Meme makes no sense. It’s the person who does 4 totems who gets hit with NOED. The ones that did nothing get away.

Lmao, I had this happen to my team last night. I get one gen done and suddenly everyone is hooked in the basement. I didn’t even feel bad about leaving them to die down there. Like, how dumb can you guys be?

Trapper can be powerful if you know your loops and get the right maps, he deserves at the very very least a c tier
---
doc and nurse should habe psychic
---
Thank you for this. Great advice. If I had gold I give you one.
---
Holy shit imagine being and to reduce the vision of all survivors for a certain amount of time after stalking them for a while like Mike Myers
---
Nice nice
---
Rofl look at the fucking Wake Up police on this subreddit right now
---
I spent days on this between assessments and work but it's finally done. I hope I have made fellow Jeff mains happy!
---
Or you could fuck a living girl, who just so happens to wear a pig head.
---
Thank you
---
It gives a bonus (5/10/15%) to EVERYTHING; not just opening exit gates as it is intended
---
Gay
---
I have tried looking for the totem but there’s always a survivor who starts endgame before I find it. I’m good at dodging hits but it’s a bit difficult to do when the killer is camping to atleast get 1 kill. I used to play super altruistic though, but I noticed others don’t really return the favor now I’m in higher ranks
---
Find the hatch first and leave as soon as it opens. (Killer cannot grab you out of it anymore)
---
Bring a key and open the hatch back up.
---
Pray the gates spawned far enough from each other, 24% the gate and hide when the Killer checks then leaves, then open it.
---
Bring Wake Up to open the gates faster.
---
Get it over with and give up so you can move on to the next match.
---
If you failed to complete 5 generators and then failed to find the hatch first then it shouldn't be a consistent nor easy way to escape via opening a gate during EGC.
---
it wasn’t me
---
I kinda want ghost faces outfit but 15 bucks for one outfit is a bit much
---
That's a save
---
High rank killer main, so I’m never good. Too many pallets and gen rushers messes with your mind.
---
It's still useful but you have to work for it
---
I never thought so. The ending was satisfying for me.
---
For all the killer knows, he hit them and they're just stupid/unlucky enough with the timing to not be able to heal before the killer finds them again. A killer can have a lot to deal with and juggle in a match to keep track of one person's health status.
---
This is incredible.
---
I disagree. You wouldn’t want new nurses to learn to depend on the add-on.
---
Yeah, I waited for like 15 and still didn’t get into a match.

I want a sea map if we get a pirate killer.
---
Only change I can think of is Freddy: Fire/Ghost
---
It's kinda what I get for covering my perks up. Also because I'm running a P3 Quentin with no Bloody cosmetics, so he looks like a FNG.
---
I'm not sure, but someone said using wake up might be a bannable offense.
---
Wake up speeds everything up by 15 percent instead of just exit gate opening, so it can be used to gen rush and shit
---
Meanwhile every change they do to make depip squad less broken pushes solo survivor further in to "im going to fucking yeet my computer out the window if i get one more team that does fuck all while i run the killer for 6 straight minutes. swear to god i want a block list so i can remove these selfcare/urban evasion bot teammates from my life" territory
---
thnx lil maggot
---
I had a game as killer once where one person was AFK, another DCed on first down, and another was running no mither, though she did seen to have some brain cells other than that. I killed two of them, closed the hatch around the time the AFK dude finally came around, and then he thought I would let him go after he basically helped make that match a 2-man.
---
Killer queue times
---
Oh yeah, there's a few guys who are "toxic" wich probably just mean that they want to play the game and not farn so it's ok for EVERYONE to have to experience shitty queue times
---
What did pewd do lol besides dropping the n bomb once then apologizing
---
That is dumb. On the positive side, the art is lovely.
---
There are no secret rules, so just play to have fun. Also, Welcome friend &lt;3
---
Yo who is BVHR?
---
People should be know better than telling streamers what to do, Pug or anyone else.
---
1) don’t go running in for unhooks before the killer can walk away 
---
2) don’t crouch around the perimeter of the map doing nothing until end game 
---
3) be aware of what other players are doing and try to strategise around it 
---
4) don’t BM the killer (e.g no tea-bagging and sitting around in the exit gate to taunt the killer)
---
Do those and you should be sweet 👌🏻
---
I played 4 matches. In queue time I was able to finish 1 exam (finals season, gotta study)
---
It's working for me
---
It wouldn't be overpowered, that's the entire points. Not being able to heal is a massive price to pay, for a perk that just counters slugging.
---
You won't even get to use it 9/10 games.
---
I'm sure some people don't see what you see. Some killers/survivors are just that clueless, I doubt he had something personal with you. 
---
Countless times I encountered killers that were hooking me even when I was farmed and when I talked to them they were genuinely oblivious of that fact. Some might pretend but a lot don't pay attention to details. And then, there are those unicorn killers that will make justice, I had my fair share of those and I always thanked them for their nice gesture of killing mercilessly those that farmed or sandbagged me :)
---
yayA!!!
---
get out
---
Yes, and if you had a brain and actually did your research you'd realize it's a visual only bug and you still get the 4th stack.
---
why would you ask for a build for a specific survivor? they are all the same
---
also, don't use wake up now. it's bugged so much they might issue bans for using it soon
---
I hope Susie has enough munz for coleg
---
Hi, I'm on PS4 too! I've been playing a few months, its definitely a learn as you go game. Choose a survivor that looks like would fit your game play, like immersive or quick get aways. I played Meg and shes definitely good when keeping an eye on the killer or running away perk wise. Most important thing is to remain patient and have fun. Its so easy to get frustrated, but you just have to push through it and take the heat, you learn from your mistakes with killers. Also play some killer matches to get familiar with the other side!
---
sabo, bodyblocking, perks that help
---
I never thought I'd see the day when Quentin becomes the toxic Quen-rusher. We kept calling the poor man ugly and now he seeks vengeance.
---
I kinda like his mask tho
---
Major Xenomorph vibes from the head piece, really love the art style overall too
---
That’s what GF power should have been, the ability to create doppelgängers
---
I want one really bad!!!
---
I feel like that's something companies do when they run out of ideas. Pirates are so general and almost every single game has a pirate character. 
---
But I mean we DO have a clown killer so honestly a pirate can't be that bad.
---
*Teabags furiously*
---
"...you are fired."
---
Had a case where all 4 of them were around a single gen with like 2 left. I downed them all and lost the last one, he wasn’t coming up with BBQ either so I just went found hatch and closed it hoping he’d have adrenaline, he didn’t so he just had to bleed out on the ground
---
Half the perks are completely fucked this patch
---
the hatch keeps spawning the main building on every map when im killer today thats what it means
---
Prolly cold tho
---
Yeah, it would be rough at low ranks, but that’s kinda the place they’re in.  They can’t balance for the low ranks, or they’d just have to nerf every killer into the floor.
---
Oh so you always get 4K with Nurse, Billy, Myers, Sprit, AND Trapper? Haha you're delusional man
---
I guess my point is that adding Ruin as a default mechanic isn’t as healthy as just simply slowing generators down.
---
Whispers best perk in the game gg ez 
---
/s
---
srs though, whispers is a good perk.
---
And that's why premonition is awesome!
---
Just remember to report anyone using wake up now, they may get a suspension for some time
---
[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/dbd_exam](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/dbd_exam)
---
Yes, getting 2x the bp is bonus bloodpoints, even if it’s capped. Do you have any evidence that it *is* capped?
---
Rancor and Haunted Grounds aren't great; I'd use Sloppy Butcher and A Nurse's Calling instead, as they fit Spirit's power much better.  
---
You should get BBQ as your fourth perk, but if you don't have it, any utility perk should make it(Agitation, Shadowborn, Make Your Choice, Discordance...)
---
Prestige. Bloody clothes are great and all, but that's all you get. They could also add in something that refunds you some of your bloodpoints from any leftover bloodpoint offerings, and that would be fine for me. In general, something to give me a reason to prestige me characters.
---
Yeah, it’s a bug that’s been around for as long as I can remember.
---
new to dbd. what does tunneling even mean.
---
100% Confirmed, 32 seconds = 80 seconds
---
gotta rewrite the laws of the universe now
---
The OP username says it all
---
Ghostface is an incredible killer, and fun to play. Easy choice.
---
You know, when many, many, many posts are asking for severe buffs to him it's a sign of something, no? he has no map pressure, his traps are disamred, he needs to walk to get them, he has no power without traps, the Hag can literally just draw hers, his power can be destroyed for about half the length of an average game... yeah lol no idk who you're playing against but he's not good. And before you insult me like you have everyone else in such a juvenile way think about why most people think he is low tier. You're not right he is a bad killer, close to the worst in the game.
---
On the very left should be the menu and chase music 😒
---
Fucking Bisharp
---
Daddy Myers B tier, is this like a personal attack or something
---
RIP Identity V
---
Sounds very familiar.  I had a game where a surv was working with the killer.  She was using her flashlight to point survivors out to the killer and was actively looking for us.  I was the last survivor and she blocked the exit gate while the killer looked for me at the other.  I got hooked and she was pretending to unhook me in front of the killer.  I actually managed to unhook, only to get downed again.  Killer gave her the hatch after.  
---
Here's a snippet of the sadistic action!  https://youtu.be/iGM3NrffSBw

How about an Undertaker? His weapon is a shovel, no idea about the power, maybe a bug swarm?

I don't think so you can while he's leaning
---
I don't remember playing much when freddy came out so I can't really comment. I actually do fairly well with freddy when I happen to play him, I find him fun, though he takes some getting used to. My issue isn't looping or somehow being inept, sometimes the ability just doesn't dispel the way it should. I get exposed no matter what I do, it seems random. I still get exposed when I'm looking directly at him and I plainly know where he is.
---
Ask literally anyone also since you obviously dont understand we're gonna live forever and bbq and chili give a maximum of 100% BONUS bloodpoints that are given to you at the end of the game and distressing gives 100% MORE more means you earn it faster but it is still at the maximum of all the other categorys whereas wglf and bbq will give a multiplier to your ending bp running distressing will give you 20k bp games wglf and bbq will give you 40-50k (not affected by bloodhunt
---
It happens when events are going on.
---
It happens; we have 60+ of the things.
---
I mean 8% may not seem like alot but it could make a big difference plus I'm fine with the add on nerfs they don't bother me.
---
When did he get mad?
---
Personally I think these are needed because before he was (I don’t wanna say OP) pretty powerful. Now I understand killers need to be strong but they don’t need to be exposed status for 45 seconds every 2 minutes strong

If survivors aren't potatoes, no, he doesn't. He wastes so much time collecting and setting his traps, his traps are still incredibly easy to counter and his traps are still RNG based.
---
GeN RuSh dOeSnT eXiSt YoU jUst NeEd MoRe MaP PrEsSuRe GeT gOoD BaBy KiLlEr

I’m honestly still not even sure how his power works. No matter how long I look at him, I get the exposed effect.
---
I have this problem with basically every game. Theorycrafting is more fun than playing :(
---
Killer wait times are incredibly long due to the new killer coming out happens every time a new solo character
---
Here comes the Trapper! You better watch out for his traps!  _less played killer noises_
---
Firecracker do instantly blind the killer (and anyone else near it, including you if you don't move) if timed right. I like to use them like a smoke bomb.
---
It's the one game where I just sit there in the lobby, eventually play. Have fun or either get demolished, sit afk 3 more hours after another match or 2, then turn it off
---
Only if they DC during the loading screen.
---
I feel like “Pockets-useful” should be the description for the pants
---
Devs said Nurse, Doctor and Cannibal are high priority for them right now, so I guess no soon ?
---
Not fair to say they rushed, they had the PTB and changed a lpt before he released.
---
God I remember that gimmicky stuff.
---
lmao, sorry boss. 
---
Is this ok ya cringy maggot
---
Nurse teleports around and crearly displays telepathic abilties while "kicking" gens and grabbing survivors, so it should def be Psychic/Ghost imo.
---
Ruin, Haunted, Spirit Fury, Enduring
---
I would love to be face camped by one of those.
---
Thats really well designed
---
Everything about what they did to that hair upsets me
---
Thanks very much 😊👍
---
As a killer, I'd like to be able to enjoy all the killers at rank 1. 
---
Totems to be completely 100% random, cause once a survivors knows all the spawn points it's just a matter of checking.
---
I'd also like to see solo survivor a better choice over swf (not because I hate swf or w/e) either a 25%+ boost in BP for solo ques or something to entice people into it. 
---
Bug fixing a lot faster, reworks ect to be done in a manageable time frame (half way through a rank reset, we dont need new killers we need fixes) 
---
Lastly reporting that actually works, if they can see who's modding ect it shouldn't be the player bases job to send in "proof" of all the crap
---
I don't really know if the servers are shitty now, because I keep getting kicked from active matches.
---
"Gen rushers" ah yes the only objective they can do in the game
---
Just literally had a match with swf with 4 wakes up and prove thyself.  
---
They were acting so innocently about it. I just reported them and pray to the old gods and the new that devs should at least ban the people who uses this exploit :/
---
This would obviously replace the terror radius music.
---
Ah yes, the survivor main who never plays killer. Fun fact: the game isn’t suppose too end in 3 minutes.
---
Fuck off.
---
What compels someone to think that the hatch is cheating.
---
Or maybe some people just suck.
---
Would you call HybridPanda immature?
---
Have to make yourself happy somehow! Oink oink!
---
Find the hatch before them. 
---
If not, you lost the race. Get over it.
---
LOL! My best jukes come outta desperation and shitting my pants when the killers on me.....what plan?
---
Cool Story.
---
10/10 Bait.
---
7/5 Salt.
---
We'll Make it is amazing. If every survivor ran Kindred and We'll Make It when playing random groups, I guarantee killers winrates would go way down. They are not as useful in SWF though.
---
How is Ghostface not Ghost?
---
My advice is that you get and read The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fu*k by Mark Manson, just watch some yt videos for beginners, enjoy the game and ignore oxygen breathing tumors that we call mankind,
---
Damn ok. he’s fun to play just useless lol
---
Just add "promises to play again only to never actually play it" and you got me
---
Why
---
Farm those green kits, like a Quentin would.
---
Item: Emergency Kit with Abdominal Dressing then Gel Dressings in that order.
---
Perks: Pharmacy, Botany Knowledge, We'll Make It, Borrowed Time.
---
With that green kit with add-ons and Botany, you get 3 heals out of the kit. You can heal yourself in 10.12 seconds or if you want to use it on teammates 8.29 seconds. Those values increase to 12.14 seconds and 9.95 seconds if you Mangled is in effect.
---
Botany and We'll Make It heals alone are 6.3 seconds or 7.56 seconds with Mangled.
---
I use Pharmacy to give teammates the kit so they can heal themselve's faster. If they have Self-Care, Botany, or Streetwise they can heal twice, regardless of their level. They can also hit a few great skill checks to get 2 heals too and save the kit.
---
Borrowed Time for obvious saves against killers close to hook.
---
The build is meant to increase you and your team's healing efficency and speed. You heal yourself and teammates in a pinch and that Pharmacy Kit will give them some independence from healing. 
---
However this build becomes very bad against Plague as BT will really only be the usable part against her or if you just happen to run into a bunch of No Mither teammates.
---
32 seconds takes 80 seconds guys! Half a minute is almost a minute after all, and there are 80 seconds in a minute!
---
I can see their point of view.  I feel like especially since endgame it's been a lot easier for the last survivor to get out for free
---
He’s a punk and you’re a child for taking it so hard. Go to the gym and talk to a girl, you’ll get over it. It’s just the internet and people don’t like you, real life is more important. I’m going to be disliked for this post, but it’s true.
---
But they still released him in a broken state. Broken state = rushed. If he was discovered to be broken after the fact then it would've been fair but the fact that they had a hotfix and ignored it for the sake of rushing him out is disgusting.
---
Would this go into salt/rant?
---
Long known bug that they won’t fix

This reminded me of the one time ***I*** got stuck in a locker, as a Survivor. My camera was in it, and I could move it around; I was just standing in there. I could emote like usual, but not leave, neither normal nor rushed. I was just keysmashing away at some point and it didn't do anything.
---
Killer found me and tried to open the locker ... but couldn't. It was hilarious. I kept pointing at him through the locker, but really at that point me &amp; my (dead and spectating) SWF team were in tears laughing. This was before EGC, mind you, so there was no way to end the game.
---
After we'd had our fun on the voice chat, I disconnected to let the poor Killer get his points.
---
His response?
---
Insulting me and accusing me of cheating. lol

You still get 4 it's only visual

Edit: I didn't happen when I played the Wraith for some reason. Other 3 games has been played as the Plague.
---
There is literally no way you’re telling me trapper is worse than Freddy, Wraith, Pig, Legion, AND Leatherface? I’ll just go ahead and answer that as a no for you. So at the least he’s already mid tier so I’ve already shit on the argument that he’s bottom tier and with decent addons like pink or purple stones and a sack he’s literally the same as a clown or a spirit.
---
If on PC, steams default button to screenshot is F12

I would queue with someone that only says oink.

Isn’t that the point

Hi I know this post is old, but how did you make the icons? Did you draw the art yourself?
---
People think that noob is toxic, but honestly he’s such a nice guy and he respects his viewers. Unlike some others. And I also watch hybridpanda and puppers as well, they’re really chill guys and you feel very welcome there as a viewer.
---
Thanks for the heads up..... I wish they would make it so that progress would be linked to your main account so you don't have to farm two different accounts, but oh well. Let's see what they end up doing.
---
yeah, who is she? I don’t know her.
---
Well he is new, I played him during 2x so I can get him to P3. I think he is a fun killer but tome to play a little bit of survivor side until queues get a bit shorter on the killer side lol.
---
Yeah I’ve been struggling with him as well. I see all the posts about people loving him. Feels bad man lol
---
There's a reason why high ranks players (the only ones who really counts)
---
Uses adrenaline and never use noed (OhDarn excluded)
---
Idk how many times its been said on other posts, but  the long killer wait times are due to The Ghost Face's release and eveyone playing. But idk what youre talking about with the server disconnect.
---
That actually made me laugh, I need a clip of that!!! Like who the fuck even watches this guy
---
Left Behind: Sounds kinda useless
---
What teir is your bbq?
---
It’s cause the communtiy’s sweet but the game’s kinda broke
---
Just a visual glitch as far as i know. You should still be getting 4 stacks like normal.
---
haven’t watched farmer john, but I’m a big fan of noob’s content. I enjoy watching his videos and his gameplay is perhaps one of the best from the dbd community. And yeah those spam bots kinda get annoying at times, he should have a mod that controls them or smth.
---
It's a known bug you still get the stacks they just don't show visually it gets stuck at 3
---
Dude, I love it and I’ve been playing as survivor almost exclusively since the patch. I’m so glad the music isn’t e tier anymore and if they change it back that’ll probably be the day I stop playing.
---
I kinda find it annoying surv on hook can reveal him.
---
My point is that it sounds very realistic
---
Well, it IS for new players. Maps are randomized but their tile sets aren‘t (e.g the garage on gas haven will always be the same except for changing windows/ the back entranxe). 
---
There are tiles you can simply learn.
---
Yeah it goes both ways I just see the bad situation far more often. Once ran a Huntress around for around 10 minutes in a 2v1 situation with 1 generator left. Teammate was MIA the entire time. Eventually found her crouched near the hatch. Aggro'd the killer again and brought her to my teammate. The killer instantly caught on to what was going on and downed and hooked my teammate. She stood next to the hook (and hatch) nodding her head and let me take hatch. Told me in post game she absolutely despises people that camp hatch like that.
---
Is it rank 3?
---
Wheres trappy boi
---
One of the ones I consider that I play primarily to save it from death
---
ooo trust me mate its not underrated right now with its shitty bug

Try to be mindful of the  music that plays as you get closer to being knocked out of your power, when you hear it try to take quick cover by crouching, you have to be creative with that (at the preschool i managed to stay hidden by using the grass at the back of the school, so it definitely has some really weird tactics you gotta figure out). Also, just try to stalk often, even when you might not be seeing anyone, if you get slower then that means you managed to stalk someone at the direction (even if it didnt appear so to you) you are looking at, head that way in sneaky fashion. Another good strategy is to stalk from a distance, then get up in their face to finish the stalk and get a quick down.Avoid marking from a relly long distance unless you only plan to make that survivor paranoid and go into hiding XD. Try to lean if you can while stalking, builds stalk hell of a lot faster and can mark the more cheeky survivors that approach you before they can dissable your power. Also be creative with the locations you stalk at, you may find some cheeky locations that allow you to stalk through small cracks (dont have a great example since i am also still learning).

Clown, because he is really disturbing, fun to play and his character just feels pleasing (laughing junkie). Least favorite right now would be legion, because he is underwhelming and underpowered. Besides that obvious pick, ghostface casue I suck playing him right now. I main killers btw

2 months ago.
---
I don't know if gens would even be a part of it. I'm thinking mostly just chases and some hiding. Possibly smaller maps with respawning pallets.
---
Dang it, I missed my opportunity.
---
Why? Boobs have physics too. :(
---
I respect your respect for another person's respect. Have an updoot.
---
Sometimes there are teammates that make that sacrifice worth it. Sometimes you feel better off living forever in their memory than living with the guilt of letting them die so you could save yourself.

Like that guy I gave my green medkit to after they pulled me out of the basement while I was on my second hook. They got hooked right before the exits opened, camped, and I just made the decision that they would get out. Just pulling them off the hook with borrowed time, going “WITNESS ME!”
---
Increase 8% of his detection circle (HUGE change I know /s) His add-ons literally get changes in milliseconds and not in actual any noticable way, two of his add-ons are getting buffed btw, so no it won't kill him, it's a fix not a nerf, people are going crazy over anything that sounds like a nerf so relax, it's fine
---
Thank you! His stalking/stealth mode has me a little bit bamboozled on utilizing because I don't understand the difference of the two? I have a hard time being able to stalk the survivors and immediately being knocked out of it too.
---
Bill could 100% be fighting. Took at least 3 fucking Tanks to kill me.
---
Haha of course the dude is a legend
---
I’d purchase emotes on killers honestly. I’m hoping the “battle pass” has something like that similar to how BR games have them.
---
Rank 1? And he couldn't get the Adept Achievement without scamming? Something tells me he does that quite often and the reason he's rank 1.
---
Broken ass game for killer too. Can't even damage people as they unhook others. Massive trolling/griefing/insulting in endgame/chat.
---
I wish there was a way to disable chat, fucking cancerous piece of shit.
---
How do you blind him? Or would he be immune lol
---
Don't worry, they'll just ban the killers doing it while ignoring the survivors abusing Wake Up.
---
I failed to comprehend basic maths and went to sleep thinking i could sneak a few more hours when i woke up sorely diasappointed x.x
---
And this is why I hate when people call identity v a rip off. If the original developers approve, IT'S NOT A RIP OFF! Sorry, I just had to say it.
---
Yeah its a common bug, personally i think its because of the slight slant.
---
Left Behind is already useless as is, my thoughts here was that they new end game for the last survivor is to find the hatch so I thought that would be a decent way to do it without making the survivor win guaranteed
---
Caulrophobia doesnt give you more bloodpoints and its not percentage based like distressing, so no not quite the same
---
Territorial: Could change it to be closer, or if you played someone like nurse or spirit you could utilize it
---
Vigil: Only if they break a chase and wait for the 20 seconds, running doesn't let exhaustion come back. If a survivor breaks chase, they usually will do so for long enough for exhaustion to come back already, so I don't think this will actually be as OP as you might think
---
Furtive Chase: Yes, but you have to hook people for it, so its better because it takes a lot more to activate, fire up is brutal strength but better after all
---
Stridor: Not so, if you are that close to a survivor for that long, chances are you're in a chase or you are looking for them and will find them anyway, it just lets you do so a little more consistently
---
That would be awesome 👏✊👍
---
You have to really play stealthy if you wanna expose people often. You don't have to be crouched all the time but you really gotta take advantage of it so people won't break you out. I've had a lot of fun with him but since I've been getting in the higher ranks Ghostface seems to get more toxic survivors literally just going out of the way to break him out.
---
It‘s just a visual bug with the counter, goes for all stacking perks.
---
You still get the full effect, no worries.
---
I hate the Wake Up bug, I've been using it basically since endgame came out since that 15% has saved my ass on a door countless times an now I'm supposed to stop using it because the devs fucked it.
---
Torn between using it anyway since Hotfix is incoming an wanting to be a fair boy lol
---
Imagine seeing one of the rare people who think looping is toxic even tho it's the only thing that survivors can do to escape. What's wrong, didnt you catch your survivor in like 20 sec 😂
---
Right her my man
---
The screams are weird when they get hooked, it sounds like they’re screaming into a fan.
---
Oh hey if killers hadthis their Ruin wouldn't break ten seconds into the game!
---
It's rare to double pip with GF as his ability to down survivors in one hit makes it difficult to score high on Chaser, usually earning him a Silver or Gold. Since he doesn't have much map pressure either he usually loses points on Gatekeeper too. I imagine after trying for this long to get the achievement he was willing to do anything for it.
---
Well said, couldn’t have said it better. This is EXACTLY what I felt, I was instantly banned after that one small statement and got harassed for 10 mins straight. Having no way to defend myself. It made me feel weak and kinda depressed, I know I shouldn’t give a single fuck about it but when something like that is made public it makes you feel really upset.
---
There is visual bug since anniversary, both WGLF and BBQ&amp;Chili can’t show more than 3 tokens, even though you actually get the 4 stacks
---
They did WAHT?!?
---
I agree, I would even say certain perks could be buffed more than you said but most these are on point.
---
The music in general is sooo quiet now it sucks. I can't hear my favorite themes in game anymore :(
---
Get better internet then
