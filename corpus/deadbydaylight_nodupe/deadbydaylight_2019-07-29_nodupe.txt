I quite like lightweight, it’s one of those perks which is alright, but it’s kinda overshadowed by the top tier stuff. I run it from time to time.
---
---
---
Just joking bro, it’s just a game lol
---
Laughs in Night Shroud
---
I always use it. If killer is soft camping me then chances are they will see the saviors tracks and not mine. Spirit can't track me especially when paired with Iron Will
---
May you be rewarded many times over for your service and for all the other Xbox randoms  who do the objective , safe unhook, body block. May your names go down in the books of gaming legends.
---
When you didnt even cleanse once but you're the 1st victim of the corrupt purge.
---
Dude, same!
---
I pip so easily, even when I try not to. Literally doing nothing will give you stealth points, and you can touch gens for very brief intervals and get lightbringer to silver so easily.
---
I honestly just thought that it was because it's so hot where I live right now but the game is probably pretty poorly optimized as well
---
Lower the settings and give it higher priority for cores, and limit the amount of other bullshit you have running alongside it. Worse case scenario it sounds like you still need to update some guts in your PC because DBD is an unoptimized mess. Some people run this on virtual potatoe batteries with no issues, it just may be you don't have the right drivers, gcard, etc.
---
Something to keep new players from putting the game down and never trying again. Nobody on my Ps4 friends list plays Dead by Daylight
---
which also isn’t perfect, jesus BHVR needs to expand their bug fixing team. half the posts here are bug complaints
---
So perks used so rarely that you never see them except from new players are good at base ? You can create a pool of viable perks without trying to make them meta. Look at Alert from example it used to be garbage, they changed it and now it's viable. All of these need this kind of improvement in my opinion.
---
Oh yea, it’s small brain time
---
Your coochie privileges, hand em over
---
I find it's similar with killers. I've done a match of me being friendly and got a pip.
---
And insidious leather daddy
---
Sorry but how is Socialize "F" tier?
---
Been playing Michael today, staying at tier one and just giving people jump scares all game. Only killing people if they make it really easy. Being told about how players literally jumped out of their seats in post game puts a smile on my face, and it's a fun break from the BP grind.
---
Ikr. Man clearly has no respect.
---
Yes I live in Arizona so it's like 110 outside lmao but we keep it at 75F inside w A/C so it shouldn't be a problem
---
That could work.
---
oh! don’t forget their marvellous and balanced perk ideas: 
---

---
“shooty bang bang gun”
---
Grants once every match a 99.93783839999999999% chance to kill the killer for the duration of the trial
---
Honestly why they they even need to do that nerf? Literally no one asked for it and if someone did they are probably rank 15 or lower
---
My friend also got perma banned recently seemingly for no reason. 
---
Does your friend family share on steam with anyone who MIGHT have hacked or exploited? Because we are pretty sure that’s why my mate got banned as apparently if anyone you share with cheats you get an auto perma ban.
---
Unfortunately it’s unlikely you’ll get any response from BHVR, they don’t give a shit about their player base and actually communicating with bans. That’s the harsh truth :/
---
I dont know what you mean by rarely. I use them in concert with other perks. They dont need to update the perks some on here could use a buff but its a small few. Most are fine.
---
yeah but you dont have to work on gens to get it to pop. you can not do the objective and adrenaline will still pop
---
Good= doing the objective
---
Bad= not doing the objective
---
Survivors have to do gens and escape.
---
Killers have to kill and prevent gens from being done.
---
It's incredible, but I feel like the break in the music would cause some confusion towards the middle of a chase, where it suddenly gets quiet.
---
don’t forget that hitting someone more than once with your ability gives you a stroke
---
Black Incense is so strong LOL. Also, you forgot to add an Apple, so you get your power anyway.
---
You should try it for yourself and see if it benefits your playstyle, rather than asking everyone else lol it works better for some people than other people. It completely depends on how you want to play.
---
I got really pissed once when I was injured and the killer was right behind me. Adrenaline popped a nanosecond before he hit me and I was instantly downed.
---
SCP 215
---
I'm still unsure of whether the Power should be just straight up reduced in duration and remove the Glass Pane idea, or if it is better to have her start strong with survivors slowly reducing it over the course of the game.
---
"easily" *laughs in solo survivor*
---
This is the nurse
---
Dude i play both and I'm pretty good with both(red ranks). I can tell you that noed is way more annoying than adrenaline. To properly use adrenaline you need to be good at running around the killer, to properly use noed you only need to have 1 finger able to push m1
---
Also having the problem for the past 2 - 3 days
---
not to forget ghostfaces power recycling
---
Because they’ve seen shitty teammates use it poorly so now the perks suck. Notice how everyone who shits on it (including the OP of this thread) always brings up “because people just go to the corner of the map to heal”. Sure if your team does that than it’s bad. But that’s like saying DS is F tier because my teammates miss the skill check all the time. Self care is a good perk if you use it correctly.
---
I literally cant remember where totems are after I found them lol
---
giant chucky would kick goofy as fuck though, his head would be the size of a piñata
---
I only depip and lose everything when the game loads in but right after you get DCd because someone dcd during loading. Every other time I keep everything
---
Fake Scientists....
---
She just got buffed with the lullaby not being directional anymore she doesn't need to be more powerful
---
i don’t know but if it’s another licensed killer...
---
Shirtless Dwight, imo. And hairy chest, please.
---
Playing Claudette is now reportable.
---
With dedicated servers coming, there's honestly no reason they can't do this. All player data will (allegedly) be stored in a centralized location that is platform-independent.
---
I dont play her, whats it do?
---
Then you're literally making her too strong on any other map. Just buffing her because she's bad on a few maps would make her too strong on the older maps. Huntress is honestly pretty strong still
---
Tbh the emblem system sucks for both sides. Killer has double pips (and adept achievements) very hard because of the various requirements. I've 4K'd as billy slugging everyone 2 minutes into the match, 3 sacrifice one bleedout (and maybe one DC, if so 2 sacrifices) and only BARELY safety pipped. Gatekeeper (Stalling game) was changed and now only counts for the first 9 minutes meaning you  NEED ruin if you want a good gatekeeper score, even if you're playing Hostage/3-gen Doc and drag the game out on the last gen for an hour. Silver in gatekeeper.
---
Malicious and Chaser also have problems. You get points for HITTING the survivor which means instadowns (Myers, Chainsaws, etc.) don't give you as much points as two M1 hits, and an insta-down followed by the slugged survivor being healed twice means you flat out lose a point in Malicious. I'm pretty sure if you tombstone someone with Myers the game acts as if you lost the chase since you never technically hit them and the chase ends during the mori animation. 
---
Survivor especially at high ranks also is very reliant on the killer. I tested a few things and a cloaked AFK Wraith (Or killer facing a wall) can make EVERYONE (Or maybe only survivors who didn't do much) depip because nobody got chased, healed, unhooked, etc.
---
its just my editing, the devs could fix it, filmora can't
---
A second chance if you get picked up 60 seconds after getting hooked in which almost every case is because you were tunneled off hook.
---
No where even near the levels of NOED so why are you even attempting to make such a ridiculous comparison
---
Because we have someone almost like him already in the game
---
no, its just the lawsuit, which jason is involve
---
How am I useless if I need to heal ?
---
That has to be a bad huntress then. Whenever I play her I'm able to end loops really quickly with a simple mind game or two. Though I will say that I feel her hatchets do need a little more consistency. I've watched as hatches have phased through people
---
Then gets mad because you killed them in a game where you're supposed to kill people.
---
do i need to repeat myself
---
Noed has coutners
---
you could only counter MoM by playing the right killer or running noed
---
[removed]
---
Badham just got a rework. It now consist of 5 maps total. More than any other realm or whatever. That being the case badham in general should have a higher spawn chance. Plus since its new I suspect I wasnt the only one who saved a bunch of offerings for that map. This is all my opinion.
---
My past 20 maps have been 
---
85% Pre-school
---
10% Haddonfield 
---
5%   others
---
GJOSTFACE!
---
Lightweight is good for getting to gens quickly and having a lower chance to be found (you can sprint freely and your scratch marks go away faster) and it’s good for losing the killer.
---
i mean, i love the remake version, he is a human there, so he would have a hunting power and a brutal.  my idea was use bells traps which when a survivor steps x times, jason will get new weapons and powers. that would be fantastic!
---
Ain’t nobody got time for that lmao
---
It is because bad players could simply avoid ruin or skillchecks by hopping off every time it appeared
---
How?
---
and we have Billy adn leatherface soo... whats ur point?
---
Shit you right
---
Yes plz make her hatchets more you hittable then I think she will be fine
---
Yeah yeah yeah just woooosh me already what's it from
---
Didn't have enduring see.
---
That makes a lot of sense. Thank you.
---
I have a lot of offerings for that map, but never used. I don’t have to use them since it’s so frequent.
---
No u
---
I actually recall someone making a post about this when Kate came out. It was obviously a goof post, but it got some good talk about how cool it would be to have GhostFace in the game.
---
That no one wants Jason in dead by daylight

Why are you assuming we'll get Jason?
---
I’m quite sure it tells you if it’s a BHVR or EAC ban when you try to log into the game.
---
“what would you like today”
---
“hmmm, i think i’ll have billy and spirit in a and b tier” 
---
“how original”
---
“oh! and i’ll have nurse as an s tier”
---
“daring aren’t we?”
---
In this part in the comic he's in the dream world
---
It's clearly not that binary or straightforward. In fact, that contradicts your own logic, noed clearly rewards killers for hitting survivors and adrenaline activates whether you do gens or not.
---
In the patch notes it says you will get BADHAM PRESCHOOL more often until the 6th of august.
---
Nice
---
myers d tier HAHAHAHGAGAGS
---
Ive played about 10 coldwinds today and 5 haddonfields bc of offerings
---
Lol. Its apparently your fault the survivors died trying to rescue their friend. This is what happens when you don't play the way the survivors want you too.
---
You realize it requires you to heal x2 the normal time? That's 32 seconds and 40 if they have sloppy butcher
---
Wilhelm scream? You'll have heard it before. YouTube it.
---
NOED is dumber because its the only perk that rewards doing unlit totems
---
I dont. Nit after black mirror
---
I didn’t read the patch notes. I’m tired of that map.
---
Self-centered much? Just because you don't want him doesn't mean a ton of people also don't want him. I would love for Jason to be in dbd.
---
alright if you think not doing gens and just being immeresed is "Doing the objective" because your teammates are carrying you ok sure.
---
hopefully not more than .99¢
---
S P I N E C H I L L
---
Same. That's why I'm not playing lmao
---
Ok I'll pass you some Bill on console if I get that on PC
---
I play on Xbox one, rank 5. People from what I’ve noticed in my games don’t put map offerings. It’s mostly randomised.
---
There is no reason to add Jason into dead by daylight? What’s his power going to be?
---
i wish they’d release the devil cape, but make the red triangles black
---
&gt; don’t be a tunnelling bitch
---
See... This is the whole thing right here... This is the point being made about not dictating how to play. You're moralizing the issue and making character attacks for gameplay styles. Killers are supposed to chase survivors and kill them. It doesn't say "chase only certain survivors and only if you haven't chased them within the last 30 seconds". 
---
Let's rewrite your comment, but from the other side, and you can tell me how ridiculous it sounds.
---
&gt; It makes me laugh when ~~killer~~ survivor still cry about ~~ds~~ camping, how about don’t be a ~~tunnelling~~ looping bitch and it’s literally not a problem. If ~~tunnelling~~ looping is ok, so is me ~~using ds on~~ camping your trash ass.
---
"What else are survivors supposed to do but loop. It's literally how they survive. Why can't they just do what's necessary to survive"
---
Ok
---
"What else are killers supposed to do but chase survivors. It's literally how they kill. Why can't they just do what's necessary to kill"
---
Double standards.
---
First off, it was relevant to the comment that *I was replying to*.
---
Second off, survivors *had* a perk that rewarded losing. It was called Mettle of Man. And I seem to recall a whole fuckton of people abusing it and when killers complained, they got downvoted. So yeah, I do agree that survivors shouldn't get perks or items that reward losing.
---
For killer, it's a bit different. You either pick a killer that can apply pressure or you don't. If you pick the latter, stuff like Ruin is there to assist you. If you either don't have, or don't like Ruin, NOED helps you apply pressure.
---
The issue with NOED is that you intentionally handicap yourself until the end of the game and run the risk of losing it before getting to even use it. The endgame is by far the easiest part of the game *for survivors*. If you get any kills using NOED, then congratulations, the survivors got cocky and tried to contest you for zero reason. 
---
It takes 20 seconds to open an exit gate. If the killer checks the one opposite of you, you have a guaranteed escape through the other one. If you think he might check yours first, wait before opening it. You can open it for about 4 seconds before one of the red lights turns on, giving you away. Open it for 4 seconds, hide a little ways off, and when the killer checks it, you are home free. If by some miracle, you get caught by the killer during the endgame when not in a chase, *you* are the issue. Not any perk.
---
ur face es uglie.
---
You could be doing gens, rescuing teammates or cleasing ruin. Instead of that you are wasting a perk slot for something you could be doing with a medkit in half the time. 
---
Try it out, I also used to put self-heal on all my builds back when I started, then I realized the mistake and quickly forced myself to use better perks.
---
Ps4 is fucking crazy. The last time there wasnt 5 offerings was like two weeks ago
---
yes thats what I said, thank you.
---
Wait, when in haunting mode do you see locker opening/closing animation?
---
Ok thanks
---
Stealth when killers have like a hundred tracking perk? OMEGALUL
---
my idea was to: he can place bell traps that if the survivor steps on them, their location will be revealed, and when surviuvors steps x number on those bell traps, jason unlocks new weapons with diferent powers, sounds great right?
---
Entity has her own rules
---
Yep but tbag makes this situation different. 
---
Flash lighting isn’t toxic in general it’s just annoying. 
---
But clickity click click could be considered toxic.
---
What do you mean dead hard is working as it is intended :/
---
literally any horror fan will love jason.
---
The first part of power is literally the trapper lmao
---
What the fuck.
---
because its a matter of time, probably gonna take more than a year, but it will happen
---
Yep 2/3 times it fails. I've switched to Lithe for now until it gets fixed.
---
I'm not sure either.
---
That’s crazy lmao. A lot of survivors love the cold wind map because for some killers, it’s hard to see through the crops which can lead to losing the survivor easily.
---
Happened to me yesterday, except they had an instaheal plus adrenaline
---
Its good but not meta good. I used it for a long time with SB. Now I run dance with me with Lithe. This post is making me rethink that choice at least for lightweight.

alright thanks hope you do great in your rank 20 game :)
---
how is that an attack on NOED. Thats a pretty good description of why NOED is in the game and why it has such an obnoxious effect. Without it there would be no secondsry objective.
---
Double blood points would be a fine comprise if you ask me. Good on them for prioritizing the right things!
---
LMAO I had a good chuckle when I saw this. You guys spoil me too much &lt;3
---
Summer is in your blood. You can not deny it.
---
What? Teabagging sure. But meta perks are meta because of all the weak garbage perks in the game, and flashlights are just useful. 
---
4 man sfw also doesn’t immediately mean sweaty tryhards, people just wanna play with their friends man. Not the fault of the player or the devs.
---
People are going to use what’s useful, and it’s up to the devs to shift that meta or tune stuff that’s too strong or weak.
---
So if the devs don’t nerf the perks that are beyond other perks in terms of strength, the survivor is the bad guy for using them? What kinda logic is that? I’m saying this as an off meta player too.
---
I’m a killer main but even I can see you’re right and this just seems like a shitpost from somebody who thinks a toxic person acts like this
---
You describe it as a crutch perk.
---
So if you only find the unhooked survivor you're just gonna leave them alone to heal while you go search for other survivors???
---
Winter is my favorite.
---
Kinda op ??
---
Finding someone to heal you can take a whole lot longer than simply self caring.
---
Botany Knowledge + Self Care makes it quicker.
---
I can see the argument for not using it in SWF but you bet I’m taking it in Solo queue, some people simply don’t heal teammates.
---
Yeah I finally read Huntress' lore last night and it was so chilling and sad. Absolutely love it.
---
Very good job. Do you mind if I ask how you did the horns?
---
He just tryna fucc
---
Link to post pls
---
I’m an experiencer player and I usually use it because having options never hurts, sometimes you need to heal to make a save and no one can heal you.
---
litterally the complete oppisite as killer. hook people like 5 times but they all escape? no devout. playing as a killer with an instant down attack? there goes the chaser emblem. Ruin immediately destroyed because coldwind spawns are broke? gatekeeper gone.
---
Imagine having too many if an item
---
Get rescued by teammates. Unless its a leatherface
---
Is this really a toxic thing to do? I feel like there is so much unspoken etiquette and unwritten rules to follow lol.
---
Yes, taking a picture of your screen with a phone is some BS
---
Clown broken too sexy
---
I’m sorry, but that’s actually funny as fuck lol how did u get in that spot?
---
Very BS
---
Being toxic is having bad manners and sportsmanship, not breaking rules???
---
With survivors you could do all 5 gens and escape without a single pip, or you could do none and die and still pip.
---
With killers you could kill all four without a single gen done without a single pip, or you could be friendly and still pip.
---
It's broken on both sides and emblems are there to blame.
---
First step is figure out how to loop. 
---
I’ll tell ya it’s not waiting by the pallet to drop it and stun the killer.
---
I've just always found that sort of stuff interesting
---
Same except im claud
---
Read the thing idiot
---
That's just a flat out lie.
---
Right, I understand that but there's a chance. Without it it seems like 0% chance. If you're looping well it can be done. I was just in a game watching someone fruitlessly loop this guy for almost the full duration of the end game.
---
Iridescent for a reason lol
---
That was due in part to both there being an event tied to said plants going on, and that survivors did not care about escaping due to said event. Like I said, if there were more objectives that took longer that were mandatory for survivors to do to escape, the game would slow way down. Survivors need to learn that winning isn't about escaping, but rather about the maximum amount of bloodpoints they can potentially get per match.
---
Don't use any pls
---
Everyone look at the fucking screenshot instead going on about how I took it on a phone
---
Well, the angel is literally breathing the drug, so i dont think that survivors in close proximity of her can even think clearly
---
Exactly
---
Congrats!
---
This is the best copypasta in dbd history. Not that ive ever seen a dbd copypasta before this one
---
They have, and that definitely adds to it, but I also learned how to counter them due to their prevalence and my constant white screen.  It only makes it that much easier to counter.
---
Had a killer add my friend on steam to say he‘s going to get him banned
---
lol can confirm.
---
I saw a youtuber that has it on mouse wheel down. I have it on mouse wheel up though, feels easier for me.
---
Thank you. :)
---
Yeah there kinda is though.
---
The thing I hate most about Evader is that it actually DEPENDS on you hearing the heartbeat, not just being within X radius of the killer.
---
For 0 terror radius killers, this means you can potentially be actively next to the killer and get 0 evader points.   I mean, if I'm moving around a gen practically sniffing a M&amp;A Myer's/Cloaked Wraith's ass while avoiding his sight, I'd think that is pretty dang stealthy.
---
Its a joke you fucking dumbass.
---
Heaven forbid there be a way to counter a killer's precious ruin without wasting 10 minutes looking for a totem they are undoubtedly guarding.
---
Btw I'm a killer main inb4 "salty survivor" responses. I don't even use ruin. Also, the skillcheck is failed if you get off when its already up, you can't "avoid" skill checks.
---
Eh,i've come to find that survivors talk shit regardless.
---
They lose - they bitch about camping,tunneling,perks etc.
---
They win - they talk shit about ggez,you suck,gitgud and so on.
---
It's pretty ridiculous.
---
Just for the sake of debating, MoM had counters too. Killers with insta downs, Noed, haunted grounds, rancor, devour hope, addons like iridescent head and pinky finger.
---
Did you read the context? He said you used to be able to get off gens when skillchecks appeared.
---
It also happens when I take a drink of my water
---
Have you ever had someone run up to unhook VS a hag with a flashlight in hand and they still get yoinked off you, then you find out they also had urban evasion?
---
Stonks
---
Am pig main, can confirm.
---

---
Uhhhh
---
That DC button looking pretty sexy rn
---
Not really. You play your own way, nobody is forcing you to follow an imaginary rulebook. If you get hate mail just ignore it and continue doing you.
---
[bruh moment ](https://imgur.com/a/MlL6Edr)
---
I never played when that happened. That's just bad design. But there's still shit that meeds to be fixed on this game so, not surprised.
---
Don't do gens too quickly. That's unfair for the killer.
---
that actually hurts lmao
---
It's because with the right playstyle and build the match can get dragged out for an extremely long time. A 3-genning Dr. Worldwide with a good 3 or even 4-gen can effectively stall forever, resulting in a 3K at the least.
---
I hate Europeans on ps4the ones I know are fucking assholes
---
Nah, wraith needs a rework more, he is easily the worst killer in the game
---
I mean... I guess, it's just sort of wrong as they get no reward for their work, especially considering that salty noobs can only get away for so long.
---
I didn't ignore anything. *You* are ignoring *my* pont. You're trying to make the hatch something it isn't meant to be.
---
Killers with noed dont only have 3 perks.
---
If survivors do 5 totems, they wasted more time than on ruin and if not, youre guaranteed a free kill at endgame for failing your objective. Its a win/win perk.
---
So stalling time does nothing for the killer? How does that make sense? It gives the killer more time to kill survivors. Something very important to the killer, otherwise no killer would use it.
---
Also if the gates are close to each other, noed becomes a very big deal.
---
Cleansing totems in red ranks as solo is a very shit experience. I dont want to do 5 totems (time of around 2-3 gens) to counter 1 perk that the killer gets for failing.
---
I had been rereading the patch notes since the changes were put on the ptb and could not understand what changed until I read your comment. Thank you.
---
Ive managed to score hits while blinded with surprising consistency. Denying me of sight will not stop this bath of blood.
---
Yeah, I have heard that actually, so that's a fair point. Though \*\*\*\*\*\*\*maybe\*\*\*\*\*\*\* fixing this system \*\*\*\*\*\*\*might\*\*\*\*\*\*\* help the longer wait times?
---
What rank was he
---
No
---
Im not a noob ur a noob. YEET get wrecked
---
Yes
---
Most likely never going to happen, but my dream chapter is a silent hill 2 chapter.

Pyramid Head would be fucking awesome and James would be my new main to replace Ace.

*slow clap*
---
I enjoy the Trapper's backstory. It's rather open ended but I like the lore of this man adoring his father so much he would go as far as the mass murder of hundreds. I also like the idea that the Entity tortured him into becoming the monster he is in the game.
---
Maybe
---
Even then it’s not a guarantee that it won’t pop
---
Use up all your addons and items first then prestige so nothing gets wasted
---
The main issue I have about NOED compared to Adrenaline is that Adrenaline rewards survivors for completing their objective while NOED rewards the killer for failing its objective. So while they are still end phase perks, the conditions surrounding them are opposite.
---
Use all your good BP offerings first so you can tank through some early blood web levels
---
DINKLEBURG
---
I just wish people would use perks they think would be interesting to use, rather than just using the perks everyone else does because it's easier.
---
Me playing with my 3 completely new to the game friends.

Killers - Mori, NOED, facecamp, tunnel, slug camp, using best addons, end lobby chat killer - GGEZ NOOBS..me just trying to teach the game, but can't because my friends just get bullied by killers lol, they dont know pallets, maps, fail skillchecks, dont have perks, the killer players are exactly the same toxic people as are survivors, there's no difference between two. Some people just come to play the game and have fun with friends, no tryharding, we mostly play premade kyf mode if we have full party, since queues are just terrible and they don't learn anything. 
---
And I can hardly blame killer players, since I know in a day they probably meet a bunch of teabagging, flashlight clicking SWFS. There should be casual modes and ranked modes in a game, so that people who just want simple games could be matched with same minded people
---
With that much BP nope.
---
My biggest gripe is the  “coop” aspect of the game yet there is no voice chat, you’re easily punished for working together, and the only means of communication are teabag/point/follow. I play both killer and survivor (been rank 3 in both) and the bottom line is this game is ridiculously unbalanced on both sides. 
---
That being said, the setting in which it all takes place is fitting for why it wouldn’t be balanced but I personally believe the game would be a whole lot better if it was stripped down and completely reworked.
---
no use that character to get all the teachables first
---
Poor killer dude.
---
Can someone tell me what tunnelling is? Been on this game for a few days now, and I see people talking about it all the time and I've been accused of it once or twice, still got no idea what it means tho.
---
 It should t the best players be able to jump through these weird hoops if they are good enough? What’s so bad about making rank one hard to obtain? As far as I recall people hated being in rank 1.
---
Ya mean dull totems
---
Save up to a million and then do it
---
Congrats.
---
Thank you! I couldn’t believe it
---
Your use of gradient shading is wonderful!  Great job!
---
It can create an opportunity to hide or juke the killer. For instance: blind at the killers shack pallet, then choose between a slow vault at the window, walking through the door, hiding in the basement, quick and quiet into a locker, or crouching next to the pallet-side door and sneaking behind the killer as they pass through
---
Fuck me up that's delicious 😍😍😍
---
I already got all the teachables for Meg
---
You use noed, you are scum, and this from a killer main
---
Skill checks are client side.
---
On other characters
---
So many people get butthurt about people using certain perks but just learn how to counter them and dont be a toxic asshole.
---
Are they spamming f’s in the chat?
---
Depends what you've got. For survivor there's no real reason to prestige until you collect teachables you want. It's good to save up a lot of BP first to get a start on the character unless you have someone else to play in the meantime.
---
It's also Meg. It's very vanilla.
---
I'm new to this game..  can someone explain why that wall appeared?
---
When you prestige other characters can still get that respective characters teachables
---
I have around 30 green keys on my Feng. I would say that's too many.
---
No just because you said "Oinks in approval"
---
How about instead just rework insidious to do something else entirely. It is currently a trash perk which is only useful for camping (and keeps showing up in my bloodwebs). It isn't op at all, it's just bad design and unfun.
---
I see a lot of people saying noed rewards bad play, but in all honesty its not a reward for anything, it's just a really good perk. Same with adrenaline. Its not a reward for good play, just a really good perk
---
I like placing traps around the killer shack because I know people always loop there but only check the window or God pallet. 
---
I'm enjoying Ruin and Hunted Grounds combo, chances are HG gets broken first. Gives me a few easy downs and then I can trap the Ruin. 
---
I never run NOED but people seem to think I will and do the totems. Buys me some time, I like that.
---
I like keeping two traps at hand if I feel the last gen will pop any second to quickly trap the exit power gates. Most won't step in it but their triggering it alerts me of their presence by that gate. 
---
He's quickly becoming my favourite killer and I don't understand his bad reputation. You just need to know when to give up on a chase to manage your time.
---
I've been working in Jake and Claudette when I'm not playing as Meg.
---
Stfu
---
Personally, I think that if you are never chased, it should be an automatic iridescent.
---
thats not his main power, ready more. and, we have 2 killers with chanisaws, 2 killers with stalk, and 3 killers that can throw stuff... anything to say? we can talk in priv and disscus about that
---
Yeah I know get another characters teachables
---
Same man. Especially weird since I hadnt played DBD in a while and didnt immediately recognize the clown, I just was super confused at the title until I saw which sub it was from.

---

---
Can't imagine being mad at people for playing with friends. Yikes
---
You probably have less than 100 hours in the game if you think that way
---
Apologies lad. I’m clearly blind
---
It's like aversion therapy lol
---
I mean, most of the time its a good thing to take the aggro
---
*oinks in disapproval?*
---
What I'm saying here is that people unknowingly do things in this game that they do not know are toxic. You guys seemed to have missed the point.
---
No ed, what a crutch perk, good players don't need things like that \*decisive strikes out of grasp, and dead hards away\*
---
Shrek.  His chase music is all star.
---
Late reply but while the Afflictions don't stack the passive benefit does. Combining Calm Class 2 or whatever with Carter's Notes Calm makes your TR even larger by a tiny bit. IDK how worth it it is, but I run that just to flex on Gideon Meat Plant with a nearly mapwide TR.
---
Yeah but a lot of times when you use it on lockers the killer will see the scratch marks stopping there and find you in the locker
---
That's the best, should be worth double points when they die like that in the exit gate
---
It's futanari.
---
A tear dropped from my eye
---
Btw this isn’t swf, im not upset my friends didn’t make it out lol. Seeing teammates getting camped playing solo annoys me just as much as seeing survivors intentionally bm their teammates when im playing as killer
---
That is blood warden in action. It basically closes gates for a limited amount of time if a survivor has been hokeed after the exit gates are powered.
---
The killer the streamer is playing, Freddy, has a perk called blood warden that stops all survivors from escaping for sixty seconds if he hooks one of them.
---
And this shows you're just a kid. No arguments whatsoever, and yet still whining.
---
It's a sin is what it is.
---
BAD
---
It's one of Freddy's perks, Blood Warden. The gates are blocked for survivors for 30 seconds after someone is hooked
---
NOED also had a timer back then.
---
Don't make fun of my fetish
---
So, its a killer toxic grind? That sound pretty rad!
---
I'm not that good but here's what I've learned so far:
---
Always start off using your power. That way you can sneak up on survivors really early off in the game and get some momentum.
---
Whenever not in a chase, use your power. The game tells you whenever a survivor is syching you out and from where. This helps you locate survivors. You can also let them fully sych you out for a more definitive location.
---
Dont waste your power on injured survivors for obvious reasons.
---
If you see somebody try to lean and stalk from a distance so that it's harder for them to see you and such them out.
---
Dont fully stalk them until you are really close to them. Fully stalking them tells them that you know where they are and you're about to chase them. Just 99% them and use your power for a second to expose them so you can get that easy down.
---
Also, if you're running thrilling tremors, make sure to look at all the generators, because it shows you all the gens that are being worked, basically working as an early bbq and chili.
---
Ohhh I can see that
---
I can't handle these memes I'm overstimulated
---
Feck
---
I switched DH. I now use either Lithe or BL
---
I’m misunderstanding the point behind this post.
---
Agreed
---
S T E A L   M E M E
---
Ranked and causal wouldn’t really make a difference because all the tryhards think they are smart and would go try to bully people in causal. 
---
Ever play rainbow six siege? Causal has much much more tryhards than ranked does in that game.
---
My name is Humpty
---
Only for a short time.
---
Are you the guy in the pic?
---
The only beef I have is that I wish we would get more keys in our bloodwebs so that we would have more options to bring one to re-open to hatch. But otherwise I just take the L
---
Yeah. Usually used to stop survivors from using the hatch
---
Something like that makes alot of sense, should also heavily reduced points in devout category. Killers shouldn’t be gaining points towards their emblem if they camp out the sacrifice. Heavy agree that it shouldn’t be a difficult thing to fix.
---
they tried it but apparently survivors "abused" it by looping around the killer.  It's absolutely ridiculous that the devs won't add any features to stop this behavior.  Even if they introduce a feature that is slightly survivor sided it wouldn't hurt the balance as they've heavily nerfed survivors for the past year.  Killer mains will complain that they can't  camp someone in the endgame and get a kill despite getting outplayed the whole match.  The thing was, if you did bad as a killer you could guarantee a kill by camping and if a survivor team did bad they could find the hatch.  Now that the hatch changes are killer sided, they should heavily nerf camping as it is shit game design at its finest.
---
What is this? I don’t see whatever it is you are happy about.
---
Man this Is awesome. you should do all killers and survivors. I could do the boring part and place all icons in the right folders and adjust resolution to make an icon pack. I would obviously credit you.
---
Was the unfortunate one in the locker. I don't know why i thought it would work.
---
No, sometimes you dont dash forward and just stay in place.
---
Really? I thought it always showed. I rarely play killer anymore so IDK.
---
yeah but its much easier to pip as survivor then killer imo
---
Even if you think it is, its still bugged and needs to be fixed.
---
Others have already said this but I’ll explain what happened before this 4-kill incident. So Freddy has a perk called Blood Warden which activates after a gate has been opened. When Freddy hooks one of the survivors while a gate is opened, the Entity blocks the exits for 30-60 seconds (like in the video). This guy basically waited it out until the last moment to hook one survivor, some other guy came to save the hooked survivor, they all ran to the exit and boom they all died. The streamer said “I applaud your empathy” right at the end when they all got brutally impaled lmao
---
yes
---
you really think dead hard and decisive are comparable to NOED? lmao.  Try using Dead hard for once and see how consistent it is.  Not to mention if killers stopped tunneling no one would run ds
---
probably your connections isnt very good, i dont think its the country either, i live in panama and i play with U.S people fine, with 120ms
---
Campers can't rank up easily IIRC. I recall facecamping everyone as LF to see what it's like, got a 3K and depipped. If his "Go to strategy" is facecamping everyone on first down there's no way he's red ranks unless he plays normally otherwise.
---
Here’s something I have to say every once in a while: Survivors are privileged but are actually destined to lose. Don’t expect to win a lot, especially if you are the last one alive.
---
Only while you are entering it.
---
Calling my take on Adrenaline poor is more a matter of opinion than anything. There is actually a higher chance that Adrenaline rewards subpar players than NOED does given that you can do literally nothing, as in be afk and Adrenaline can proc. Besides, killers don't have to be bad at the game to activate NOED. Most if not all killer perks are reliant on survivors interacting with them to even matter. If a killer is playing on a bad map or facing coordinated survivors, chances are, the gens will all get completed except in cases vs Nurse or Spirit.
---
As for having a poor memory in regards to MoM, you are one lucky ass redditor if you never once saw MoM supporters on this sub reeeing whenever someone complained about it. "Just instadown 5head"  or "It's easy to proc early, just tunnel" everytime someone brought up MoM. But hey, since you can guarantee that everyone hated MoM, why don't you show me all the memes on the sub about it?
---
Killers apply pressure by winning chases? That's equivalent to saying "Just down survivors 4head." Depending on the killer and map, I can't *just* win chases to pressure them. Killers like Trapper and Hag need to pick an area and set up before even getting to chase. Wraith has one of the worst chase potentials in the game seeing as his power is "move slightly faster and be invisible". Any killer not named Nurse, Spirit, or Billy automatically starts the game wildly behind in applied pressure. If you don't have it, you don't just get pressure. That's where perks come in to shore up weaknesses.
---
As for imaginary scenarios where the killer chases a survivor and downs them with NOED, why not imagine if the survivor had Adrenaline like every competent player does and got away?
---
And setting oneself up for failure by using an endgame perk, I can safely say, it doesn't seem to bother survivors when they run Adrenaline. The point of these types of perks is to risk an early loss at the hopes of activating a powerful effect.
---
The gate scenario is still ridiculously favorable towards survivors as long as they continue to use their time efficiently. 2 survivors can still open gates while the killer is distracted by a 3rd or 4th survivor. If the killer camps one gate, they can't effectively camp the other. The only times watching both gates is even relevant is if they get there before all of the survivors and are waiting for them to try and open one, or when it's one survivor left without hatch.
---
Nice job on getting to rank one! I’m fairly new, do you have any tips for either side?
---
Devour Hope, Haunted Ground, Pop Goes the Weasel, NOED/ Make Your Choice. Use on pig. May work with other killers, further testing is required.
---
People who like being able to crawl while recovering. Or people with flip flop.
---
r/unexpectedminecraft
---
Tunneling is when a killer will go out of their way to attack someone they know is injured and close to dead on hook. It's kind of a fluid term and gets thrown around a lot but the best example I can think of is a healthy survivor is standing directly in front of the killer but they will purposely move past them and hit the injured person when they had a perfect shot at another survivor
---
Absolutely.  Adrenaline is more comparable to devour hope.  It rewards you for doing your job.   Especially with bloodlust and EGC NOED is ridiculous.   You can literally bloodlust one pallet, hit someone with NOED, and camp them until the timer runs out.
---
WORKING AS INTENDED
---
Being survivor and escaping its toxic
---
F
---
Looks like a Scooby Doo chase scene lol
---
You know hatch can spawn when theres still 5 gens left right?
---
To be fair it’s kind of hard to open the exit gates if you’re the last survivor especially if they’re close, so it could be their only chance
---
When axes rain from the heavens to silence the screams of men, the black spider will feast and death will be the only escape.
---
I got a full spirit loadout with prwstige,but Im still around rank 12 because I suck at killer. Im a survivor main,but I spend a lot of BP on my killers,so its not a miracle to see ppl like this.
---
Mouse wheel, far easier to keep rolling than smashing.
---
I only teabag if the killer camps or tunnels me all game.  If someone teabags a killer that plays fairly I call them out in the chat even if I'm a survivor.
---
I tried to stop it in time for you to see the locker grab, but not my anguished screaming, "NOOO! NOOOOOOO!"
---
I wanted to give the killer a Hungarian birthday present.
---
I'm sure I can make that happen for you.
---
Just always assume the worst. A killer always has thrill, NOED, BBQ etc and survivors have dead hard, deliverance, DS, adrenaline etc.
---
I think this is also why I can't have nice things.
---
right... but rank 16-20 is reserved for complete newbies
---
those who can not hunt shall not be in the tribe

Add a lower sound gate in obs settings.
---

---
I think Dream Master is when all survivors are in the dream world at the same time. Since hooking survivors wake them, or they may try to use alarm clocks, this can actually be kind of hard and I get it once, maybe twice per game.
---
Don’t the chili add ons do literally nothing?
---
I don't use DH, but I have experienced the wiggle and recover bug, alongside not being able to mend or heal myself or others
---
You do still get the points, it just doesn't show in the end screen. A good way to test is by writing down your score, bring in a point offering, then do some addition at the end to check
---
That's good, but you're still going to progress more by levelling most survivors. Prestige is cool, but all you're doing is resetting Meg. If you only have 3-6 other teachables you aren't going to gain anything by levelling her up again. It's better to leave her at 50 so you still have decent perk builds and items to play with to gain points for other survivors or killers.
---
Personally I used to level a character to get their teachables, then play them to level the next character, then swap to that character after unlocking perk slots and continue the process to unlock all of the perks.
---

---
I was sold on the belly visual effect even tho its not quite the same size as the original
---
its not toxic but nor is killers tunnling either
---
I mean i could post it. Don't think it would help your case any.
---
You could also say that Adrenaline holds a risk that NOED doesn't- you're choosing not to heal
---
If they sit in the locker all game, why do they need adrenaline in the first place?
---
This is only true when both sides take them. Should both sides always take them?
---
What does noed do? I’ve heard about it but never seen what it does
---
30 seconds? Even if all the survivors happened to do a totem at the same time, it wouldnt be 30 seconds because there are 5 of them.
---
Doing totems as a singleplayer is a pain in the ass and its them who get hit by noed the most often. Its not fair to make us destroy 5 totems or see the 5 broken totems just to make sure. Even with small game, broken totems dont get notified.
---
Killers who use noed can be good but most i play against, manage to get around 1 kill until endgame phase, even with killers who are considered to be top tier like spirit, billy and nurse.
---
The only thing that annoys me about noed is that the killer has to do nothing to get it. You see there is devour hope. Do 5 hooks and be OP and then there is no noed. Do nothing and pray to god that nobody did totems. The killer can do 0 hooks with billy with the best add ons for the whole game and still get a free kill at the end.
---
Honestly I love this game. sucks so much how we have so many asswipes in the community
---
Thank you so much!
---
Based on the other comment thread here, I can only assume he toggled hacks. It could be a really odd glitch, but IMO, he got salty and didn't want to let you get your BP, so he turned on god mode, and left to do something else, just to force you to leave.
---
Maybe play Civ 5? Mcote recommends it
---
That. . . Was beautiful
---
Ok there is no excuse for this
---
It's incredible. I hope you keep sharing your art!
---
It's just so annoying that the game is decided according to your totem spawn, you have a shit one or they spawn on it, you most likely lost, great job !
---
I think the subtitles say “Friends, I said it’s blocked!” But I’ve never seen 잼든 before so I’m not sure. Just in case anyone was curious!
---
yeah: borrowed time got nerfed, d-strike got nerfed and now only works if the killer is a tunneler, and adrenalin needs the team to finish all the gens. Meanwhile: ruin got buffed (they try to hide the totems better and even ruin 1 is affecting everybody), BBQ is meta since it's in the game only got a slight nerf (WAGLF only gives bloodpoints and just fucking got nerfed for nothing!), and Noed just rewards you if you play badly, and if they get all 5 totems then they wasted a lot of time so it still worked.  
---
  
---
I'm just saying it's not the same. With the BT and DS nerf Noed should have been touched also (not even taking away the power, just putting in a counter like the gens have, because in solo games noed is a bitch). I don't really mind BBQ and even Ruin, if there is like 4-5 matches in a row with ruin i just play another game that night instead.
---
tbh i use vile instead of corrupt more due to when they get broken insta down
---
That is not Godsmack.
---
Red rank survivor I think
---
You are wasting 32 seconds of time which is a lot
---
When the last generator is completed, the killer's basic attack puts you in the dying state even when you are healthy. I don't how it interacts with everything though.
---
the same survivors that cry about tunnelling when unhooks happen right in front of the killers face.
---
Tunneling it Depends. If it's like right in the killers face or you're running an obsession build then no its not toxic. But if that's not the case and you still go for them ur just being a dick and not getting the points you could be getting if u didn't go for them.
---
Yea it really sucks, but sometimes I just laugh it off as them being them because they can't take defeat
---
I’m only upvoting because it’s a pewdiepie meme
---
On which killer?
---
How does adrenaline reward good gameplay?
---
Hes gonna be sad
---
Theres no toes in minecraft
---
Oh wow that sound pretty helpful
---
Noeds for noobs
---
unfortunately it'll never happen. friday the 13th was a game that was a heavy competitor against dbd. i doubt they'll get a license because he already has his own game
---
to survivors mains if your on the same map your tunnling
---
Thanks man, ive been tryin to write a childrens story lately and your video really inspired me to buckle down.
---
Have heard of my friend having this issue on PS4. Same with invites not going through, not being able to re-invite to lobbies, unable to heal or be healed, list goes on.
---
NOED = literally given to you for free EVERY game unless you kill everyone before endgame
---
Adrenalin = actually have to do 5 gens before you get a 5 sec speedboost and 1 free health state
---
Oh shit nice. Can I use that skin?
---
It was actually pretty nice lol, glad I can be of inspiration
---
This just gave me a reason to get Jane  OTHER than thiccness
---
Yeah that’s basically what he says. 잼든 is more of a slang created by the korean dead by daylight community which is a combination of 재미 + 워든 (Fun + Warden) = 잼든 (Jamden), I’m pretty sure it was created to poke fun at the semi-useless perk Blood Warden but i’m not too sure because I’m also a noob myself haha
---
You are way better than a new player but you still put up with them. Wow!
---
And to killer mains if you're in a swf you're toxic. We could go back and forth all day lmao
---
Calm 3 isn't even a thing... funny meme tho
---
Jesus what the hell is Wendy’s Eating Show
---
I agree. There are good people, but they don't outweigh the shitty people.
---
If you're facing Nurses, Billies, and Spirits who manage to get one kill before NOED, you're low rank. If you can beat these players and get to a better rank where killers and survivors are smarter, you won't see NOED on the top 3 killers. But since you do see these players, you're obviously still low rank. So your opinion doesn't matter.
---
If NOED annoys you, maybe try to actually cleamse the totems. And yes, if every player did one totem, than it would take 15 seconds to remove 4 totems. With one totem left, it takes 15 seconds to cleanse the last one. 15 + 15 = 30. So yes, if every survivor helped to cleanse, it would take 30 seconds.
---
More than that it gives you bonus movement speed. But it's a hex totem (it can be destroyed) that appears when all the gens are completed, so if you do all the dull totems before that happen, the perk won't even work at all.
---
It’s decent, if it showed you the killers aura whenever anybody completes a gen it’d probably be a really good perk, if a little bit strong
---
I haven't been playing super long, so I don't know enough to have an opinion on what's fair or not but there are drawbacks to NOED: it's a hex perk that only activates when the last gen is done, so survivors can destroy all totems and NOED won't be a problem. 
---
There's also my personal experience with games as killer where survivors, for some reason, are super altruistic. What usually happens is that I hook someone and the last gen is done and, instead of running to the exits and cutting their losses, the rest of the survivors tend to try and save that other person.
---
But the thing is he was in development it shows in the files that he was a ready model and the Jason Figurine Company could still make the ones that were already in progress so they could’ve easily made Jason x into the game but they didn’t
---
While NOED users risk a 5-totem-cleanse or just simply not hitting anyone before all survivors escape. The two perks are so on-tier with each other it’s crazy that some people so vehemently insist that only one is balanced/OP
---
Oh
---
Great survivor, but we cannot have survivors that can kill all the killers, lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
well, ash is in there...but hes funny.
---
Not really, Pop goes the weasel is very good, Barbecue and Ruin too of course, Thrilling Tremors is pretty nice, as well as discordance.
---
Yes and that should heavily favor the killer. But its better for the survivor than when only 2 gens are left
---
I also would like to know this answer.
---
I swear pop goes the weasel does not get talked about enough. I adore that perk.
---
Stop taking messages like this so serious
---
I didn’t make this I’m new too dead by daylight. My friend made this and said to put it here so I did thinking I would get a lot of karma.
---
Snares are better than dream pallets
---
It should now since you don't need to put people to sleep to hear the heartbeat. I don't know about the lullaby though.
---
Adrenaline is also good for rushing the last gen injured instead of healing first. Such a good perk. It’s not an easy win though like noed is.
---
It's ok on him, but there are much better perks to use on Freddy. The Surveillance and Discordance combo is godlike on him. BBQ+C and PGTW are both good to use in the other two slots.
---
No I completely agree.  A very simple fix IMO is just to do a flat increase to each hook stage time.  Like make it 3 Minutes to get to struggle and 3 minutes to Die.  That way if a killer camps he is near guaranteeing a loss and it gives the other 3 time to find out that the person is being camped (as it takes time to run to the hook), find totems (campers love NOED), do the gens, and open the gates.  With the current time to die on hook the killer can easily get a 3k just by camping and using NOED.  If it takes longer for survivors to die on hook, the killer would leave because he knows he could get him to the next state faster by rehooking them as opposed to just waiting by them for 3 minutes.  Another problem with current times is that good killers can predict when survivors are going for saves as the window is very small for a safe save.  Not to mention if the killer returns to the hook with 20 seconds left for example, he will probably just wait by it for those 20 seconds as he knows someone is nearby or coming and it would be more efficient than hooking them again.  If they increase the hook times,  less people will die on hooks and get camped (buff to solos),  and it encourages survivors to go for saves as they would want another person on gens.  They should also change Leatherface's power to be actually useful for something other than camping and remove it's ability to hit multiple survivors.   Insidious also IMO is a very unhealthy perk for this game is it basically encourages camping.
---
The thing is that no good killer uses noed except maybe 3% of all noed users from my experience, so you wont see a lot of noed on those 3 killers on high rank anyway but there are always those boosted killers from time to time. Especially in green ranks its a very common thing for killers to have noed. Everyone knows that.
---
Also you cant use math to say that total totem removal only takes 30 seconds in every map. Its not like they are lined up next to each other and always easy to find. Tell me the one instance where your team has cleansed all totems in exactly 30 seconds. Obviously because youre a rank 1 GOD you must have done it dozens of times right? Its literally impossible to cleanse all totems in 30 seconds. Because you have to first find them and then make sure, youre not getting caught. Totem removal does take 2-3 gens unless you have a tryhard sweaty team who has played around 2k hours each and made the effort to remember each totem spawn on every map by heart.
---
I was rank 2 survivor as solo last season btw.
---
You saying that totem removal takes 30 seconds makes me think that your opinion doesnt matter lmao.
---
People might not talk about it a lot but I swear every killer in the purple and red ranks has it equipped. (PS4)
---
Exactly, this guy is an idiot killer main.
---
Well for how long OP has to chase survivors, I'm guessing it's not wrong. Although I've never seen any daily that gives that much in like a year or two, so I really don't know.
---
I'm pretty sure that's how those lockers are suppose to be used, would be interesting to see it more
---
Lol that seems ridiculously petty and actually hurt the killer’s decision making.
---
Your first ever meme is brilliant
---
He is an M1 Killer, but if you use the good add-ons and perks, he can put out some hurt.
---
Do it only if you want the bloody cosmetics. There isn't much of a difference of getting rare items in the bloodweb the higher the prestige you are.
---
Possible? Yes. Any time soon? No.
---
Not only does the Billy look great in this but it’s got a cool spooky atmosphere. I would hang this up for Halloween.
---
It's funny, I'm considering prestiging a 2nd time with Pig, not for the cosmetics (i think her bloody blade looks a little ridiculous tbh) but because I've gotten a couple perks from other killers and the gigantic bloodwebs past 40 make it less likely I'll get the stuff I want. On the other hand I've already had to waste a ton of BP to get to this point with a build I like (including wasting BP on perks I don't want just so they'll stop showing up in the bloodweb).
---
guys, we found a badass over here
---
I think in higher up play they are in lower play they rank about the same depends on your play style
---
That wasn’t always the case, maybe it’s been a really long time for them.
---

---
Got a 4k and pipped lol
---
I personally think that emblems should just be removed and there's only 1 way to pip, which is achieving your goal.
---
For Killer :
---
* 0-1 Kills, depip. You failed miserably.
---
* 2 Kills, black pip. You did 50% of your job.
---
* 3 Kills, 1 Pip. You did almost everything you had to.
---
* 4 Kills, 2 Pip. You did your job.
---
For Survivors : 
---
* Dying, depip. Doesn't matter what you did, you ultimately failed to escape
---
* Survive via hatch, black pip. Desperate measures, granted for the last person alive. Shouldn't be rewarded, but also not punished.
---
* Escape as one of the last (3rd, 4th) via exit gates, 1 pip. When the chance to escape was there, you where somewhere off, risking your life again and possibly end up dying.
---
* Escape as one of the first (1st, 2nd) via exit gates, 2 pip. You did it, you escaped and you seized your opportunity to do so.
---
You don't really need Surveillance/Discordance. BBQ by itself gets the job done and allows you to teleport to the nearest gen if you see an aura. Thrilling Tremors is also very good on him.
---

What exactly am I supposed to be getting from this post?
---
I know that there will always be THE BEST PERKS, it's almost impossible to make all perks equally valuable.. 
---
But I think the game has more shitty perks than useful one.
---
The point was that people on insta were stealing the meme from this sub you fucking dried kelp
---
Rank 1 both sides. :)
---
Ha, well played. A lot of survivors do not seem to understand that killer gets priority in closing hatch since they are host. Worse thing you can do is stand there waiting on the hatch.
---
Tbh, if your entire team get's hooked when the gates are powered, I wouldn't escape out of fear of getting hooked myself. I would leave them to die for being stupid.
---
I’m fine with it being hard to obtain but there are issues. 
---
Say i’m extremely good at gens to the point i can hit great skill checks every dingle time even with perks working against me but i can’t loop a killer to save my life. I’m never gonna make it to rank 1 cause i might be a gen god but the second the killer is on me i’m practically dead with no chase points. 
---
Or i’m a super good looper but i’m not good at staying alive after a hook and never get a good emblem in survival, i might not be able to crawl my way up to rank 1 because i’m dying early.
---
well shit. idk how to respond to that
---
r/rareinsults
---
I mean obviously you cant facecamp in 100% of situations, but its still too easy to sit on players and be guarantee 1-2 early kills while the rest of the team works their way to an escape. A survivor or two will almost always escape, but some survivors (myself included) like to play for the team and will risk escaping to try and save a teammate. Facecampers see that and their mouths water lol.
---
my guy was playing trapper. You are braindead for calling out the noed
---
Sorry, could you elaborate? I don’t really understand what you mean.
---
Just thought it was funny he said that
---
You dont need noed to be a good trapper
---
Not in my experience. Once you get to the higher ranks, for the sake of argument let's say rank 10 and beyond, as a killer main it's extremely rare to bump into survivors that don't behave poorly. If it's not post-game chat abuse and rage invites it's always, the fucking, tea-bagging and taunting. 
---
Like, whooptedo sir, you found a safe pallet. Better tea-bag, right? There's literally nothing impressive about running around level geometry and dropping a safe pallet. But the assholes keep doing it. Probably out of monkey see monkey do because a majority of the streamers behave badly and act like shitlords. I have to stop myself but it's extremely obnoxious and overdone.
---
What do you mean, I run sloppy, nuts
---
Nurses calling, coulrophobia on plague. And bring Franklin's to counter medkits
---
nah then thats poor players if you see a facecamper do as many gens as possible and try to escape one death=escape 90% of times like in ranks 13 and down its legit a waste to facecamp the killer will lose
---
Yea it sucks that you rarely get to see it for yourself
---
Hey man, im a 1400 hour player that plays almost exclusively stealthy, and I love UE. 
---
But I also do gens every moment I can.
---
He acts like they're bad because the killer was a five year old. But the only reason they lost was the connection issues. In fact I bet he didn't let anyone play, it was him being a sweatlord the entire time, and wanting to rub it in, so that's why he made up this lie.

---
Don't cry about your tiny dick here, we don't care.
---
Well I find killer definitely harder than survivor. So a few tips for killer is to definitely grind out the good perks like ruin, bbq and chili, etc. Don't worry if you lose a lot because with experience you get better. Definitely learn how to mind game as you can catch survivors by surprise if they aren't paying attention to their loops, but don't try it a lot as they will catch on. For survivor, I think it's very easy to pip up. Just do a bit of everything such as gens, saving, and looping. If you have friends and can play swf with them then ranking up is a lot easier due to communication. And definitely grind out the good survivor perks. :) Other than that, enjoy the game and have fun.
---
Y  E  S
---
Well because most killers don't have high mobility, so they can't use Pop as effectively as another killer. If they go towards a generator that is getting worked on, they might find another survivor and begin a chase, making Pop useless. Freddy has the advantage that he can use it instantly when his power is up.

This sounds interesting, what would his base perks be like? I’m guessing they would have to deal with gens because of the censor effect
---
I genuinely like this concept

I actually didn’t know this

No five year old can play dead by daylight

Watching a fat woman stuff her face isn't an experience, it's a horror movie.

---
Adrenaline and noed are completely different
---
Noed rewards killers for not doing their objective
---
Adrenaline rewards survivors for actually doing their objective
---
Thank you for this guide, I am going to be hopping back on to dbd tomorrow. Haven't touched the game since the addition of the legion and I am only waiting to go down to get a xbox live card.
---
hush survivor main
---
Just remember who got unhooked then slug him
---
It amazes me when people get mad at a Trapper for using NOED
---
noed punished survivors for not cleansing totems . just bc all the gens get done doesnt mean the killer wasnt trying to kill the survivors. ppl have bad matches it happens. both NOED and Adrenaline are endgame crutches that i tend to try and avoid
---
Yea, I play about 70% Killer and I think NOED is absolutely cheap and I don't see how anyone has a problem with Adrenaline and I was one of the people who had a problem with the old DS.
---
Literally the only perk I have a problem with now is NOED. Fuck NOED and fuck old DS, glad they changed it, please change NOED now.
---
I think the plague had very interesting lore
---
I like run one that reduces gen teleporting cooldown for each sleeping survivor and one for slowing down action speed in the dream world. his best combo is probably red paint brush + swing chains, but those are pretty rare add ons.
---
Then you get yelled at for being a slugging P.O.S by a surv after the match
---
I’d go into that match like “One second has passed, two seconds have passed, three seconds have passed...”
---
Me playing a Hex build : "Hehe they won't know what hit'em"
---
**Thrill of the Hunt triggers everywhere on the map**
---
Me : **confused screaming**
---
That didn’t explain why they got brutally murdered like that
---
Ideas for addons and his perks? I like the idea of a "Conspiracy" themed killer although his actual ability doesn't seem very conspiracy-ish. (I read his visual description and imagined him as a Doctor "Clone" with Paranoia instead of Madness, and maybe an ability to disguise as a survivor)
---
Don't go there unless you want to see Huntress dick... in use.
---
The ultimate mind game
---
Should've blinded too like Scott tried in his last stream
---
Stall? Mending takes like 7ish seconds at best and by the time you run to hit someone else the other guy is nearly finished
---
Map pressure? I can agree there
---
Free first hit? He is now a basic M1 killer the rest of the game while leatherface can actually instadown and prevent extra loops, the stun and speed boost the survivor gets really hurts legion in a chase
---
Chase? he is a basic M1 killer most of the match, at least LF can down someone. i think they're equally bad
---
The new Feral Frenzy buff looks OP.
---
Ik... probably 2020
---
There is no such thing as bad matches, its being a bad killer, if they choose to chase someone who know s how to loop great and never gets touched then that is their fault
---
I play to 2 hook everyone only with 0 perks on random killers, and I don't really care about teabagging but what I will not stand for and will absolutely destroy you for is flashlights. I don't mind flashlight saves but flashlights at every fucking pallet. 
---
This is the only time I will tunnel and camp, I will not let you use that flashlight on any killer ever again.
---
I like how killer mains act like that all the time but for most killer mains and plays both sides equally (Rank 1 Survivor, Rank 4 killer) I see toxicity 1% of the time. And if someones gonna get mad over someone crouching on a pallet while there is a lot of fucked up shit online and in the real world then pick your poison. Because someone who likes to play with friends and use flashlights to save them is very toxic and should be sent to death row. OP is continuing something very annoying and should be stopped but alright then.
---
There is a timer of like 60 seconds (I think way more) of when the gate is open to when you can and so after the time runs out everyone gets killed if they didn’t escape
---
To me it's the killers who slug and leave you for the entire end game timer. I also had a killer yesterday let my teammate live just to make sure he killed me I assume because I was the only one that ran him for longer than 20 seconds but I just disconnected then cause what's the point of even trying against a killer and survivor working together.
---
The theming and fear is that he's a government black ops, deniable asset, 'Those men obviously committed suicide by shooting themselves twice in the head your honor, and we suggest you stop asking questions.'
---
Rather than paranoia, he represents the ability of scary totalitarian governments to 'disappear' things they find difficult. Those reporters? They don't exist anymore. Those whistleblowers? Stop asking questions. They're on a farm in upstate new york.
---
Thanks, u/serialmurderer420
---
Were you facing a spirit?
---
Hahaha.
---
What does swf mean?
---
Great job 👍
---
ikr that’s why when the game starts I find the nearest hook and stand under it to wait for the killer
---
I was playing nice killer one game and I was letting gens get done cause all I was doing was a daily. until a Meg Tea Bagged me flashlight taunts emote taunts and everything. So I tunneled her in endgame and let the EGC take her away.
---
You’re like that kid in school that when you try to talk to people, you’re just met with complete silence, despite knowing that they understood what you said clearly
---
I love it.
---
They got brutally murdered due to a somewhat newer feature known as “endgame collapse” where the survivors will be instantly sacrificed after 3 minutes have passed once the exit gate opens or hatch is closed. 
---
The time ran out so they died
---
Fuck noed
---
Once a gate is opened there is a countdown timer that basically kills anyone still on the field when it reaches zero. So when the wall goes up for 30-60 seconds but the timer has 29 seconds left they end up trapped inside when it hits zero and they all get killed by the entity
---
Lol. Normally if I have my preferred add-ons I don’t use noed. My thinking with this set up in order to have a chance especially at higher ranks was 1. I’m getting time to set up so I’m ok with them having time to cleanse all totems so no noed or 2. They power through the gens regardless of ruin and corrupt ignoring the totems which leaves me with a backup. Has been working out
---
Facecamping isnt always a viable strategy but it changes the game, especially if your only objective isn’t escaping. If a killer is playing a team who forgoes leaving the gates to try and save their teammate, facecamping can guarantee 1 or 2 kills the killer wouldn’t get otherwise, which can be difference between +1 and breaking even. Don’t mean to imply strictly facecamping will work every game to get you to high ranks
---
A killer can only bring noed and the survivors can either take it down before or after it pops whereas adrenaline will activate as long as the last gen pops and if even 3 survivors bring it that's 6 hits and 3 hooks before they can open an exit gate and leave if they don't use borrowed time or instaheals. The only way a killer can counter this is by protecting dull totems while using noed or bringing the whole endgame build  which would waste their entire perk build just cause toxic instaheal survivors bring every second chance perk they can find while 1 or 2 guys are gen jockey. But it's ok for survivors to bring perks that give them more hits to take like ds MoM adrenaline and borrowed time with instaheal
---
Its really not a nerf
---
who cares what internet people think about you, just ignore them.
---
Reported for having a shit opinion.
---
yeah ik scratch marks lead to the closest I thought ghostface was closer and if I fast vault he would try swinging and would miss 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
exactly and most of them feel like we have ti folliw their rules like we killers dont offer no rules for them why should should they
---
“No such thing as a bad match”? Are you kidding? I’m usually a red rank killer, but every once in a while I get annihilated by rank 12-15’s. Not consistently, but every once in a while I’ll have a bad match.
---
The ranking system is pretty ass. I love the game but like it seems like when I do good I get deranked and when I get destroyed I rank up lol
---
My brother had to quit the game because of that, The killer literally took two steps and hit him followed by Taunting him. Totally reported him for griefing but i was super vague and with the Ambassador badge, I’m sure he was shook.
---
This was happening to me a yesterday, I hopped on today and it wasn't a problem anymore. Thought I was the only one
---
I know that Urban sucks, but I'd rather get mori'd before the first hook than being a slug when crouching. When I startet playing DbD the first survivor I played was Nea, and everytime I tried to play another survivor crouching was so cancer.
---
Ah I see, happy to say that the accusations were false then. As I just attack the nearest survivor atm haha no matter who it is.
---
If you allow your facecamped teammate to die and escape without trying then yea, one death and 3 escapes aren’t hard to get. But in alot of my red rank games, survivors try to be good team players and risk letting 2 deaths happen to try and get 4 escapes, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. I consistently play killers who know they arent getting all 4 and 1-2 is like a W to them.
---
Back when blinding the killer caused their retinas to be seared IRL I could see a point to this, but anybody saying it now... c'mon.
---
Well there’s many reasons, but one of the reasons would be because being able to one hit people when they’re going to one of two locations is pretty powerful especially when it is completely passive and the only one way to lose it is a concerted effort from the survivors.
---
Staying near a hook if you hear someone with whispers, or an injured survivor is different. Or if you have barbeque and chili and see that all the survivors are in a 40 meter range you know to search the area. But straightup face camping is unnecessary and doesn’t reflect any level of skill by the killer.
---
But he would of just pulled you out of the locker? I mean it’s a lose-lose situation, If you tried to loop baby Dwight could’ve probably pulled his first safe unhook
---
Eh. Im just going against Freddies 24/7 so it’s kind of useful for spotting fake pallets. And it’s getting to the point where I memorize totem spots my a lot and tbh, you dont even need to cleanse them. You can leave them all alone and if there is a NOED then you can just check all the spots and see which one is lit
---
Tbh Red Moris probably never should have been put in the game. I can't see how it's entertaining for either side tbh, for survivors it obviously sucks to be killed after one hook and in a drawn out way but for killers I think it diminishes the coolness of seeing your killer's special move when you see it 3 times in a game. 
---
If I were put in charge of making mori offerings I would keep everything except for red moris, I'd make it so that killers could theoretically mori everyone but you could only do it after the person had been pushed to stage 2 (meaning they've struggled at least a little on the hook).
---
To be honest many of Freddy's addons are pretty shit compared to Old Freddy. Blocks? Useless. Dresses are ok but they don't increase the penalty any more than slightly. Pallet addons are great but the effectiveness of the aura reading the better ones have from a pallet dropped in front of you is debatable. (Although Freddy's scratch marks are dim so it helps a bit)
---
Drawing addons (reduced teleport cooldown) are pretty good. Pill bottle is mainly a for fun addon. Red Paint Brush (RIP old Red Paint Brush, you will be missed) is fun especially combo'd with swing chains but the reduced action speed addons are pretty pathetic. 
---
Jump Rope is only a 9% slow compared to the 60% slow it used to have. Outdoor rope is 6% slow. I understand crippling slowdown you get over time even if Freddy hits you would be too strong but currently it's not strong enough. No idea how slow Swing Chains are but I have heard they're worse than level 1 thanatophobia. 
---
Class Photo is sort of fun as you can scare survivors off all gens when you TP, and if they disrespect, you just immediately appear out of nowhere and can hit them. I dislike it because in my experience survivors disrespecting can sometimes finish a gen I wanted to hit with pop goes the weasel. 
---
Black Box is WAAAY better than the old one (Obsession can NEVER WAKE UP) but I struggle to think of any decent uses for it besides the classic "Dying Light + Black Box" combo although it might be funny to run it with Jump Rope and Dying Light, so if the obsession overestimates the slow thinking "Oh my god I'm gonna be slow the entire match?!" and ragequits Dying Light procs on the other 3. 
---
And that's about it for Freddy's addons. They're just a bit mediocre. Like the fake pallets are good but why do we have three different addons with the only difference being how long the aura is shown, and same with the dresses? At least make the better dresses increase the failed skillcheck penalty more or something.
---
I usually use a pallet addon combined with something else. Maybe a rope or pill bottle. If I'm using snares I like to use reduced TP cooldown or a dress. The blocks suck. (60 seconds hemorrhage for a very rare?)
---
In the end Freddy's addons got sort of messed up with his rework. His formerly worst addons (Black Box, Garden Rake, Prototype Claw, Paint Thinner) are now some of his best, (Black Box keeps obsession asleep, and the other 3 are fake pallets) and some of his formerly good addons (Red Paint Brush, the ropes/swing chains, the blocks, Class Photo) are either crap or debatably useful.
---
My biggest issue is there's so many repeated addons or underwhelming addons. Since they repeat the ones you want (Fake pallets, TP cooldown, etc.) are in good supply but it makes me wish he had more unique ones.
---
Smal Game works with fake pallets? Whattttttt
---
So awesome.can't wait to see more.
---
Exactly. Loop the killer to death.
---
Stop right there... how is boil over a pain in the ass when you slug? Isn't the point of slugging to not pick them up, so boil over is completely useless?
---
Somewhat. But I dont plan on using it forever though. Just till it gets to the point I can memorize totem spots
---
So you failed to power the generators, you failed to find the hatch before the killer, and you failed to open the exit gates before the killer found you, and you *still* think that you should get a free win?
---
Bach's Prelude and Fugue in C minor, BWV 546, should play during the endgame collapse as well.
---
(Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SopaCsjEKPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SopaCsjEKPM))
---
you know what else is completely passive and is also "pretty powerful" and also doesnt have a counter?
---
Using noed pfffft trash
---
Sorry what’s the problem ( new player ) ?
---
I mean if you know you’re timing you could pull it off I’ve done it multiple times
---
Maybe he could get Edward Scissor fingers as a skin to convince the kid in my they are the same and that was his origin story
---
Hahaha ha
---
I play both and nah it’s not toxic, when playing killer I like it when they do that because it means they’re wasting the time it takes me to break the pallet (and battery). I can just listen to find where they are afterwards. I agree teabagging is kinda shitty though, just because it gives off a very ‘sore winner/loser’ vibe (unless the killer has been facecamping all game).
---
I didnt use a red mori I used Tombstone.
---
Things i can think of could be the new nightmare (green hat, trenchcoat, and bone claw) the syringe claw from Dream warriors, and the ripped shirt with the demon babies
---
look at the chat

[What Killer should you get?](https://youtu.be/C49wygOeZ5I)

I play huntress on console. I need to step up my game. I'm good but I'm not godly like you mate. ^^
---
Well you’re incredibly non-empathetic then. Sure you don’t have to give survivor’s a free escape but don’t be so tryhard to the point where no one has fun playing. Your survivor emblem system makes me think you don’t actually play survivor a lot. It is WAY easier getting one or two kills than it is escaping. If a survivor got camped they’d be punished because they couldn’t do anything, resulting in a depip. If that was the system everyone would be at rank 15. Also the entity is feeding off of the survivor’s hope, so if they get away the entity is like mmm yummy come back again. Escaping is what keeps survivors going and killing is what keeps the killers going. The entity just wants to eat, it doesn’t care about who lives or dies
---
Try never.
---
10 seconds isnt that strong i could see if they had any add on's that made him have more time or decrese the cooldown but his base power is good
---
There are 7 generators.
---
Uggh point taken

I kinda want to seem F.J.S.J.

---
At least these provide a miniscule amount of entertainment as opposed to the countless "MaTcHmAkInG sUcKs" posts that flood the subreddit with no redeeming value. They're both annoying.
---
Awww, that’s too sweet ❤️. I have basically been playing Huntress since I got the game a year ago, and basically only played her for about 1 month. Most unenjoyable experience in my DBD career. But after I started playing other killers I understood more of the basics of killer, and I did a little better with her from then on! It’s def something that requires effort and patience
---
I personally love playing Pig but a lot of people don’t like her playstyle so, out of the two you named, Michael is better while Freddy is more fun while still being pretty good.
---
You have a 15 minute cool down on your power and if you break that rule you must immediately let every pallet be dropped on you then let everyone escape if you wait those 15 minutes you have a penalty for thinking you can use your power again so you must dc on spot. Lmao
---
Noted, thanks. Now I can play properly :)
---
How is this toxic? Did he do it in retaliation for something or was it just how he played. To me it just seems like someone with an inefficient play style
---
It’s so easy to pip as killer as well. I’ve never gotten all iridescent on survivor and i’ve gotten all iridescent on killer without even trying. Just break pallets, kick gens, chase, and hook. Use your power a lot too
---
That's Jane's injured sounds, you're welcome and thanks &lt;3
---
tunneling isnt that toxic its like survivors throwing down a pallet and using flash light or flash light saving you had a chance to make the game quicker for you so take it thats like giving the killer a rule to obey when its a good strategy in the game perks like borrowed time counter it too
---
Good but remember you can only play pre rework Freddy because all other killers are too over powered and you must wait for their nerfs lol
---
XD
---
Got it
---
What are the similarities with lf and Billy besides a chainsaw?
---
Just how he played. It’s frustrating bc it stopped anyone from getting off the hook and all my teammates just went and either walked close to the hook (killer wouldn’t swing unless they were unhooking) or actually trying to save and getting downed.
---
She’s just eating a hotdog???
---
this is a beautiful design but $50 total seems whack, ngl.
---
Only if you really want the bloody clothing.
---
Also they make loud noises when completed and light up so I recommend getting used to that and planning 3 gens to try and save because they are good gen locations for your specific killer (never do the killer shack it’s a bad idea because it has a incredibly strong loop that only a few killers can stop)
---
Agreed. Friday the 13th (The game) released within a few months of DbD - on PS4 at least - and even though that games long dead I doubt BHVR could get the rights to Jason.
---
Fully agree. This subreddit would benefit from more moderation
---
I can get why they’re salty, noed+ebony isn’t a fun combo
---
Endgame time is 2 minutes. It was 3 minutes originally but changed after the PTB.
---
just today i had a survivor bitch at me because i was using CRUTCH perks such as barbecue to rank up and win
---
Well said.
---
No, I don't think I will
---
YES
---
"why would the killer use noed?"
---
Elaborate on that please. How are flashlights anti fun? They only last a little while compared to some worse over powered killer addons like iri head and pre rework frank’s mixtape

Yea,it's to bad really.i'd love to have that trenchcoat freddy.
---
Thank you for your consolation.
---
&gt; Dying, depip. Doesn't matter what you did, you ultimately failed to escape.
---
okay, yeah, single-digit red rank survivors total (if any), that would work really well
---
Maybe. I mean, look what happened to pre-rework Freddy. Lots of hype with him, but he was terrible. Let’s hope, if he is added, he will be good.
---
Why would blinding someone while they kick a pallet be toxic? By the time the pallet is broken and the animation is over you can see again.
---
All iridescent on killer is easier then survivor but I still think survivor is much easier because there’s 4 of you and the killer can’t have his attention on all of you. Also you pretty much actively gain points as survivor from unbroken and the evader emblem as well as lightbringer. So I’m gonna say I disagree. Also those last 2 sentences were really dumb.
---
You know what else only activated when you do five generators?
---
lol they should have Legacy Skins for Console too, considering all the shit we’ve been through with Frame rate drop and other issues.
---
Woman *
---
here I was thinking that it was effective
---
I'm so sorry. *Woman* clearly has no respect.
---
Of course. Not now, though. Soon.
---
&gt; So if I'm a survivor, I want to escape, I couldn't give less cares about the other poor souls who are also trapped in here. Following that it's only naturally for me to assume escaping should be the only criteria that matters.
---
you're literally on a team as survivor lol.  if you do poorly, you hinder other people, and vice versa, and the same thing if you do well.  teamwork and coordination should definitely be something that factors into pipping as well for survivor, which I guess would leave you rank 20.
---
Players like you describe who are only good at one facet of the game don’t really deserve to be in Rank 1 or even in red ranks, imo. And that’s nothing bad about that, both sets of those skills (efficient gen progress and focus as well as chasing/evading) are valuable but being good at only half of your objective means you are still needing to learn more of the game. 
---
Just like with Killer, you have to juggle so much more because the game demands you occupy the time of multiple players. A killer who’s good at getting hits but bad at getting downs will never succeed or a killer who can’t break a chase but still squeeze a 3 gen strat is going to have difficult games as well. 
---
Rank 1 should be the zone where people play at their best and do it constantly, unless you are so good you can play goof off builds and still pip, no one should be in R1/Red except for the highly optimized players.
---
Same here at R11-12. I decided to just have fun from now on and I at least get safeties now. It’s not worth getting twisted over.
---
He very Stronk now
---
I felt like this a few times today. Ruin got destroyed within seconds. Gens started popping. Gotta take the bad with the good sometimes.
---
This too. Don't focus on rank if you're fairly new to the game. Focus on getting the fundamentals of either side down first. If in the future you want to aim for rank 1, then go for it. But don't let yourself stress over it too much. When I went for rank 1, I didn't focus too much on the rank. I let myself enjoy the experience and if I piped up on either side then that was just a bonus. As killer, especially as you rank up fast, you are going to face a lot of swf teams that are optimal, so if you lose don't let it get you down.
---
What? You literally have to escape WITHOUT getting downed to get iridescent Unbroken. Also if you play immersed it’s very difficult to get iridescent Boldness and if you get hit you lose points. Survivor is more laid back to play but you still have to work hard to get a perfect game.
---
"...and worst of all, he could be *any* one of us! He could be in this very room! He could be you, he could be me, he could even be-!"
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
There is still a slew of survivors at red ranks that do not belong there though.
---
I play as survivor and I really enjoy playing against it. It’s a very different experience. I feel like games can go either way and it doesn’t feel unbalanced to me
---
This is amazing.
---
i dont really play dbd what am i looking at here
---
This is too accurate, I just wanted to fix my glasses and messed up 2 in a row then got wraith in my face
---
I think you misread my comment. I said killer is easier then survivor.
---
Which emblem are you referring to?
---
Using each other takes the same amount of time to heal, just split between 2 people. You'd be better off staying on a gen and letting the other person self care.
---
Medkits are obviously going to be superior, but we're assuming no items here, otherwise let's just berate people for not carrying around instas all the time because that takes no time at all. 
---
A plague match is played that way because a plague doesn't have map pressure, she has a tool that ends chases quickly that survivors can disable by not healing. Not healing vs. A plague and not healing versus a freddy are two VERY different things.
---
I just feel it should be more diverse. I don’t mean the extremes that i used as an example as you do need some skill in all areas but with the current emblem system, if the killer decides not to chase you you have to just deal with either a safety pip or one pip. At that rate it would take forever to climb just to get longer queue times and the same killers over and over again.
---
Forgot to mention that he makes his own "set of rules" telling you what you can and cant bring or do"
---
What do you mean unwritten rules? 
---
It seems someone hasn’t read the Survivor’s Rule Book for Killers
---
Correction: YOU can't 360.
---
I’m not trying to say those extreme examples should be rank 1 but, say, a killer decided not to chase you the whole match the best you can get is a one pip, probably only a safety if you play against the wrong killer(Legion, Nurse, Billy) where Altruism is less important for healing or far more difficult.
---
No it wasnt. There is one animation for jumping into the hatch and it can only be interrupted by a grab. 
---
There is no startup to it which can be cutoff if you shut the hatch. Its all one motion. 
---
Man forgot you could shut the hatch I guess
---
No problem. I’m actually considering getting Freddy too but want to use my free test to see if i enjoy him, at least without perks, addons, or offerings.
---
You're not seeing how she's weak? Then you don't have enough experience in the game.
---
Right in the middle of mid tier
---
Yeah they should change him and neas faces. Rainbow did it to make valk not look like a man
---
Ranking can punish actual good players and reward immersed players
---
You’re a hero. Fuck all survivors on ps4, even the dumbasses on your team.
---
- Camping, staring straight at you on the hook. 
---
- Tunneling. Rare, but it can be very unfun to play against.
---
- Taking off the hook with killer nearby, not taking a tank and letting you die
---
- Hiding and leaving you on hook to escape via hatch (Pre-end timer this one was).
---
- Worst case a survivor getting a killers attention, crouch spamming near me, then running so killer gets them. Just did this during the game. Not sure why but instantly killed that March's fun for me.
---
I understand all of you trying to argue with me how you're supposed to help your team and that it's a 4v1, not a 1+1+1+1v1 and I agree with all of you that that's the intetion **gameplaywise** . And here's where your view of the game and mine take different paths.
---
When I play DbD and queue up for survivor, the moment the camera does it's intro-scene, I'm no longer "The dude who plays dbd", I'm (for example) Dwight Fairfield. And in this scenario, I'm stuck in an unknown realm together with 3 other guys and a monster trying to kill us. So yes, I do work with my team, saving them and healing them, repairing gens, all of that to **boost MY chances of escaping** . I will save you, heal you and assist you .. until the exit gates are powered. Then it's everyone for themselves, I'm getting the fck outta here. I'm not risking my life to maybe safe yours, where most likely we're both just end up dying. Again, this is not me (As in me IRL) not wanting to waste the escape points and possibly depip or whatever. This is Dwight Fairfield trying to survive this mess.
---
Again, I agree with all of you, I just play very RP-ish.
---
You said you disagree and think that survivor is easier to get pips with. I understand that but it’s way easier to get iridescent everything on killer than survivor.
---
I love how calm she is when she's humming while on the hunt. But when she gets hit by a pallet of throws a hatchet her tone changes instantly to a woman with a cold dark hunger.
---
It's always nice when playing as Huntress when you come across survivors who try to bait you into pallets and teabag near them only to get a hatchet for their efforts
---
The only reason to do so is for cosmetics that are meh imo
---
Just friends
---
Lmfao
---
Oink
---
Yeah, the o oh drawback for me playing as her is my controller, if I had a mouse and keyboard I would play her 10x more often, such a wonderful character design and fun gameplay

I like this response
---
I love happy endings
---
Why?
---
I like the clock mechanic
---
i was disagreeing with the idea altogether... I was saying there would be no red rank survivors if that was the pipping rule
---
It's seven. I double checked.
---
Those types usuall dc as soon as you down them.
---
This sounds cool, but I think a better name would be The Conspiracy, or The Covert
---
NOED gives possibility for M1 killers to give pressure when gates are powered up.
---
Have you ever played against mediocre 4-man-SWF with non-meta killers? There is a little chance that you will give them enough pressure pre-powering.
---
Cool
---
Good.
---
Yeah sorry I thought you wrote it
---
I recommend you play a base Killer to get better at the game but if you want a good Killer DLC Killer to play. Ghost Face, Micheal, or Freddy are all good picks.
---
As long as you’re not abusing a bug or are hacking, there are no rules. The killer controls the game, and nobody is entitled to stopping you, me, or any other killer from doing whatever the hell we want (unless we’re hacking or abusing glitches). Don’t be shy to use toxic strategies, but be sure to show them that you aren’t a toxic person and simply want to dick around or have fun.
---
Does this only work for pc
---
I’m pretty sure they’re meant to spawn near gens to give survivors an idea on where to look. At least in my experience, if there is a gen, there’s usually a totem nearby. But they don’t always follow that rule and sometimes you get s totem no where near a gen and hiding in the corner. 
---
Still, my point of being a high risk, high reward still stands.
---
In English plz for us old asses still playing on Super Nintendo and 64
---
Great explanation! Where can I find more of this for the other killers? I cant seem to follow the lore
---
Survive With Friends. You can load up with a pre-made lobby and fully optimize all actions. Basically killers can't win against a fully optimal team.
---
yes and no there should still be good spots for it to hide as well as bad places I think we can all agree some totem spots should be bad as that is the risk but not all of them
---
You've done it. You've wasted 666 hours of your life playing a broken game! Impressive
---
Well now I just don't know anymore
---
I feel this with huntress on any map bigger than my terror radius. No matter how fast i can finish chases gens will pop across the map and there’s nothing i can do about it.
---
The problem is that Ruin is basically mandatory against survivors that have a pulse if you're not playing one of the top 3-4 killers in the game.  
---
Adjust gen completion time or add another REQUIRED objective to slow the game down a bit and change Ruin to something else.  I'd be elated to not HAVE to run Ruin constantly.
---
Facts.
---
You're right, I was counting the last gen as the 8th one
---
I’ve played the game since console(PS4) release and have gotten hatemail from a killer probably once, but from survivors? Boatloads, especially from SWF groups.
---
“X bad” jokes good
---
Dead end job, wears a tie and slacks, and they’re leaders when shit hits the fan. I could be talking about either one lol
---
I’m shit at killer and get genrushed all the time by non-SWF teams. Sometimes you’re just shit, or they were lucky, or they were legitimately better. It swings both ways with survivors. We can’t blame everything wrong with the game on guys with comms. I’m sure legitimately good killers can take in SWF teams with little to no issue. We’re not all going to be gods and fucking pro streamers and it’s time we all started trying to have fun and not complaining about the “other”.
---
Using noed = trash
---
They have a program (emulator) on their pc that runs the mobile game. Then they play on a keyboard + mouse for a huge advantage.
---
for me I get more hate mail from killer so I guess it depends
---
If it gonna steal a meme, at least wait until it's not in hot anymore...
---
Don't forget - NOED still takes a whole slot for an entire game. One could've used other perks to win chases more reliably or to apply pressure.
---
Lol, I did that when I was originally typing the comment (why I double checked).
---
And honestly if the killer is running Sloppy Butcher then just don't bother.
---
Still lol, me and a random were just walking around him in a circle and my friend was going "OH FUCK I HAVE A HEARTBEAT DUDE HE'S ON ME"
---
Why not.. Easier to identify cunts that I want to dodge.
---
Yeah I guess though Shawn's job plays little role in the film, and Dwight's job is a pizza delivery boy and gets picked on by the other workers compared to Shawn who is one of the managers, and just no one respects him as they're really young. I get there are a lot of similarities but the only thing that really makes those similarities obvious is the clothing being similar, besides that no one would notice it.
---
Id love to see the trapper. Your artwork is awesome
---
The plastic makes it look like the ghost face  mask back in the day that would ooze blood.  Is this one of those, or is the material just a really cheap plastic?
---
I agree with the message of your post though, I play both killer and survivor but unfortunately there’s a vocal segment of survivors who are toxic and BM and trash talk and send hatemail no matter what and cry on the forums every time a new killer is released and get them nerfed.
---
why?
---
Get this guy a load.
---
Sounds like a good idea...
---
You might try contacting a forge to have one custom made. I think smokey mountain knife works does custom stuff, but it probably wouldn't be cheap.
---
ok...?
---
Honestly hope they do a silent hill one kinda like Freddy when you get hit everything starts rusting and you hear that alarm so cool
---
Even if a blind a killer they always read me like a book and follow me while blind.
---
Actually that’s wrong. You can be taken forcefully out of the hatch jump due to lag. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WlFDgYQy40M
---
[MENACING]
---
If you prestige there is no guarentee you'll get the perks you want it is random. You could lose your good build end up with trash and then have to spend more BP at level 50 grinding for the perks you want.
---
The problem isn't that ruin is op. It's that the game is way too fast without it. If they just nerfed ruin the game would be too easy for survivors. Almost all killers would just run PGTW if ruin got nerfed and have to alter their playstyle for it.
---
Just my late night thoughts about it
---
Hard to swallow pill: a game mechanic that takes advantage of a person being disabled while performing a long animation is bullshit and shouldn’t exist.
---
My dream chapter is a Silent Hill 2 chapter. 
---
Pyramid head would be a tricky killer to make, but I'd main him and replace Ace with James.
---
Thanks for participating!
---
Her singing does change as the match progresses too. She does start sounding annoyed or laughing.
---
Don't ask about the stick. I didn't want to use a knife.
---
The crop button is a simple button xD
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
So body blocking a survivor on a gen and Grabbing survivors while unhooking someone shouldn't exist?
---
You know what perk let’s you be immersed all game and still activate even though you weren’t doing the objective for your team?
---
There is, but you shouldn't follow most of it. Only rules i think people should generally follow is
---
don't face camp
---
don't T-bag to BM
---
don't spam click flash light to BM
---
don't go out of your way to tunnel (punishing bad hiding or unsafe unhooks is fine)
---
the two the killers do generally hurt their chances of winning anyways, and the survivors can just not BM. The rest of the etiquette (like gen rushing, using certain perks on either, using flashlights at all, slugging, using certain addons on either, or using infinite loops) are all just mechanics and you should complain to the devs if you really think they're unbalanced
---
Send a usable version please!
---
Every time I play swf we aren’t even coordinated 😂 we usually try to get each other caught by the killer and sandbag at pallets
---
I mean don’t complain, originally you weren’t going to get him at all

I voted and just out of curiosity will you put up the results? Because I am also curious as to which licensed chapter people want!
---
&gt; Almost all killers would just run PGTW if ruin got nerfed and have to alter their playstyle for it.
---
I'd be the more sadistic person who'd combo Dying Light with a mori every game if Ruin got nerfed.
---
Survive with friends. 
---
It's a favorite of salty killers to call any team that shows teamwork "a swf".
---
These are great! I love simplicity in portraits like these, and this works perfectly!
---
Way more fun to play as and against
---
Then get better. You know, by playing against better players.
---
Ruin is pretty easy to work through unless you get really unlucky with the skill checks popping up constantly, even then you could just tap it. The biggest factor in it slowing the game is whether or not everyone starts hunting the totem
---
I'll leave the survey up for about 24 hours, then release the results.
---
If you think hex:ruin can be nerfed without first changing the core mechanics of the game, you don't know what you're talking about.
---
How i her cucked over 24/7 by randos
---
Always someone else's fault. Then be like the rest of the scrubs in this game and get 3 other friends to play with you. All red rank SWF are really just rank 10s anyway.
---
pffffft who cares
---
YOU ARE A BOLD ONE!
---
You have to leave through that gate before the timer runs out, or else you die like that. The killer used a perk that makes it so that you can't leave under certain circumstances. In this case, all four survivors were on the inside, so they all died at once in a symphony.
---
Look up things about the lawsuit and Larry zerner on Twitter. He played Shelly in part 3 and is a character in the game
---
Wraith or meyers. Trapper is a pretty simple killer but he's really annoying to go against especially if you're new and don't know common trap spots. Legion is also pretty annoying to go against when you're new because noobs usually heal against him
---
At the same time tho you might want to play them to teach them how to play against them. Honestly anything but nurse/billy/spirit will probably be ok
---
My dream chapter is the Collector with Arkin as the survivor!
---
With that loadout you got no room to complain man.
---
Community displeased
---
That’s the problem being put up against higher ranks when I’m no match
---
Gen rushing isn't toxic it's doing the objective but I guess some would consider it toxic if you 4 man swf and all bring brand new parts
---
I think it might be a bug as it happened to me while playing survivor
---
Again that’s not killer’s fault. If he waited til last second to hook them that means gates were open and they had plenty of time to escape. Trying to be altruistic and save everyone cost them all the game.
---
I see so start with myers or wraith and let them learn from experience from there. I was kind of thinking the same, should I tell them how to counter the killers as I play them?
---
Its a visual bug, you need to chase them for 7 minutes in order to get this.  Also for those that may be confused as to chase time and BP count this looks to be an old daily (when they took longer but got you more points).  He has two dailies.  I'm pretty sure even when it's your first time launching the game it will still just give you a single daily.  What likely happened is at some point he downloaded the game (likely when it was free), launched it, never played it, then returned to it.  If it's not that, spaghetti code.
---
Ya but not anymore
---
Surveillance actually kept giving me 4K’s like god it’s so good for ghostface
---
pretty normal
---
That's what back then means.
---
That's my point, it's not toxic it's just playing the game. It's not unfair to be well organized and skilled enough to do it.
---
Nah. It should be like unbroken. If you're never downed, yada yada. You get silver if never in a chase. Like altruism has a starting value. You can potentially rank without ever seeing another survivor if the killer does poorly.
---
Well if you think about it, getting healed by a teammate takes up their time and your time, whereas healing yourself only takes your time. Its the same amount of time wasted if you consider that.
---
And also I didn’t mean immersed as just sit in a locker.
---
APPLAUD MY SUPREME POWER!

Happened to me with 2 other mates alive. They carried me towards the hatch, one sacrificed himself for me to get out (face camping Noed killer)
---
Entity displease? But that was awesome
---
It’s a console thing, her hatchets are much more difficult to aim with a controller than a mouse. Us console players don’t get special treatment

Lightborn reduces the effects of flashlights

---
“YOU’RE ALL TERRIBLE PEOPLE!!1!1!!”
---
What Shirtless David uses UE to hide? Use all the manliest sounding perks: Dead Hard, Mettle of Man, Unbreakabill, Iron Will. The killer better hope he's got a perk that reduced the smell of fear by 100%.
---
Appreciate it
---
Using a teammate to heal takes twice the man power, so overall, its not at all more efficient.
---
They don't have to be humans just humanoid killers. So basically walks on two legs and has human proportions it's fine. Like spirit isn't technically a human she is a spirit but she looks like a human
---
Lightborn and franklins demise are the 2 perks people use when they’re sick of flashlights
---
So basically there’s no perk to prevent people using flashlight against you while carrying someone?
---
I'm pretty sure they said they wanted Humanoid(humanoid is a very broad term) killers and a examples of humanoid I think is the spirit because she is technically a well spirit, Hag is sort of a windigo  mixed with human bits and Freddy is a literal nightmare so I think they are going to more of a mythical route(or more pushing the limits of what people are ok with as killers).   there is rumors we are getting a demogorgon from stranger things since Netflix partnered with BHVR so to say they are only interested in humans is iffy at best.
---
BBQ+C only works after a hook. I like to keep tabs on gens at anytime, so I'm probably going to be running all three perks once I get Discordance unlocked.
---
I believe they said it is always supposed to be the farthest clock from you when you fall asleep
---
Hey, I don’t mean this as rude, but I can help with improving image quality if you want me to explain it for you. The process has direct downloading of the image that you can edit on your phone from the xbox app after taking a screen shot from the xbox itself. (Sorry for the long comment)
---
Sometimes it be like that but did your team do gens at least
---
The solution to unbalanced killer kits aren’t “run X perk” we only get 4 perk slots. And OP is pretty clearly trying to retain the advantage spirit gets from her power while making it SOMEWHAT balanced. Right now spirit has no counterplay, a survivor can only make a guess and hope the killer messes up. It’s not really balanced if the only “counterplay” is to run a specific perk
---
As a Shirtless David I do not acknowledge the existence of stealth. Crouching is only for saying hello to other survivors, rescuing from hag, dodging Huntress hatchets, and trying to piss off the killer if he is tunneling your buddy.
---
None that completely prevent it. I just remembered ghostface has a perk that makes people in your terror radius scream when you pick someone up. So that prevents people from flash lighting you while picking someone up but not while your carrying them to the hook.
---
How’d you make the mouth look longer?
---
Well lightborn makes blinding way harder and Franklin's make flashlights or other items drop when you hit them but the best way to deal with flashlights is just be more aware and pick survivors up near walls and it's relatively easy considering the pick up range is huge.
---
you guys are so funny hahahahaha fucking kill yourself nigger

Based on some messages online, you've deemed him a shit human? Okay buddy.

Yea we got three done immediately and then they tried to get me off but gave up after one got downed.

Use a perk specifically to counter 1/16 of all killers, seems like a brilliant plan! (/s in case it’s needed) and crouching doesn’t do anything for grass moving, or a survivor’s breathing (iron will doesn’t remove the sound of breathing either)

First was decisive strike, now adrenaline? Oh my god.

Except it would be more delayed than scratch marks, which would leave mindgames as an option while making it so that a survivor has a small chance of outplaying the killer

---
Ah makes sense now
---
Your insults mean nothing you simple peon
---
Like a cackling laugh kinda haha not like that anyone over there laughs like that
---
LUL. Dead hard doesn’t fucking work 90% of the time, and if you’re complaining about DS, stop tunneling like a little bitch.
---
Toxic survivor= teabagging and clicking the flashlight over and over.
---
 Toxic Killer= face camping and tunneling when you have a choice. If you show up to the unhook and are lead to the injured party only, it sucks and is fine to hook them. But if you have a choice go for the one that didn't just get pulled off the hook.
---
Killer: WHAT!?!? Oh course there are rules, they are right here in black and whi- oh you’re not gonna read them… okay then *proceeds to throw out the Survivor’s Manual for Killer’s*

---
w/w isn’t straight shit, that is the problem. Another problem is that the playerbase also isn’t... Just... Men? Have you ever thought about that?
---
What?
---
How many times we have going to go through this. Adrenaline reward you for doing generators aka you deserve it. meanwhile, No One Escape Skill reward you for falling to protect them + End Game collapse.
---
Don’t go out of your way to message people “GG” on console. It’s just weird.
---
Honestly, for killer side at least, I'd say "basic playability".  Without a Bluetooth controller, you can't either lunge straight and attack or stop dead and turn while attacking, but you need extra thumbs to turn while moving and attack.
---
Yea I know but she has Wendigo type features like deformed face and limbs(mostly her hand)
---
I know it’s true but fuck you
---
She’s not as thick as she is supposed to be though
---
My bloodwebs were shit for survivor so I just leveled Ghostface up. I grabbed every random box and most of then had one in it.
---
Since when is using your fucking power against the rules?
---
Every time a killer dodges on my 4 stack my buddy pipes up like "lmao little do they know, we're fuckin' trash."
---
My mistake, forgot that it activates when looking at a trap too.
---
It kinda sounds like a perk not an ability.
---
But like, why would you stalk as Micheal?
---
that's girl bub
---
Rn my survivor bloodwebs are cursed by the entity I’m pretty sure, I bought deliverance from the shrine last week and have went through over 50 of them I haven’t even gotten deliverance 1.
---
There is no such thing as gen rushing. Every fucking killer runs ruin so yeah.
---
Bbq Chili is the same way for every killer
---
Patch notes.
---
Read them.
---
What? How? It literally uses his specific weapon, and has different options and effects with how you use it. 
---
What would you suggest instead?
---
What video game are you playing? I've literally gotten two Freddy out of like 30 games I've played since the new Freddy came out. It's actually absurd.
---
The one game I did have against him was fun though(was playing my Grand Meme Tapp build with Tenacity, Unbreakable, BT, and Dead Hard), I Unbreakabled into a pallet slam when he was coming to pick me up after slugging me to chase a guy off a gen and ran him through Autohaven's bus loop(which coincidentally had the alarm clock for me by it), stunned him with the pallet to dodge a hit and used him breaking the pallet as an opportunity to wake myself up and keep looping.
---
The second, unfortunately, was a hard tunneling Ebony Mori Freddy who tunneled down the people that were unhooked(even though they usually had BT on them and I was injured too) so he could mori them.
---
Still like the rework, just wish I played against him more.
---
im an idiot
---
no clue
---
You should be ashamed
---
First time it happens to me in my 2k hours xD
---
Not sure how he was in the first half, but after the gates are open all camping is fair game.
---
That said, lots of leathers like to insidious camp
---
youre right, I'll do better next time :(
---
As I read their comment I said the same thing lol
---
its basically the same as the doctors pallets, pretty easy to play around as soon as you get used to them. And you’re really gonna pretend that none of those are downsides? Come on man, use your head a little. If only 10 of the pallets on the map can be dream pallets then they’re either rarely scattered across the whole map or concentrated in one area, if you see way too many pallets in one spot then go somewhere else. Pretty easy to wake yourself up too, can even be done mid-chase if you have a medkit or self care. As for “salty X mains” you’re literally named “ochidodidnothingwrong” that screams “I’m a survivor main who lacks a fully functioning brain” like nothing else. I hope this has helped you see that you’re being ridiculous but I don’t have high hopes that you’ll put your few remaining brain cells to use
---
That flashlight click triggered my fight or flight response
---
Guess your just lucky. Im usually seeing them every 2 or 3 games. And in between that is just Hags, Hillbillies, and at least a few spirits. Im in green ranks as survivor
---
While yes urban evasion is good agianst her crouching around the map is faster now but remember running is always the fastest option but then you risk stepping in a trap. But when you getting someone who is hooked then holy if urban doesnt become god tier for that situation
---
You had terrible teammates
---
I'd spin it a different way.
---
Adrenaline isn't a reward for completing all five generators.
---
Adrenaline is a freebie for all five generators only taking just under two minutes to pop (without toolboxes) or only 79.03 seconds (Resilience+Toolboxes) to pop in actual repair time.
---
When the survivor objective only takes 80 seconds of actual effort if they purposefully let you hit them and then don't heal up (even if they get hooked and rescued), even with Ruin (because these 80 seconds assume they hit "good" skillchecks without Ruin, or "great" with Ruin, they don't care about the bonus progression), **is Adrenaline really a reward?**
---
*Popping Adrenaline is not difficult, it is not a challenge, it is the best (longest duration for the speed boost) sprint perk in the game even without a full heal.*
---
**Conversely this means NOED is not particularly a crutch - generators get repaired too fast, it's just a symptom of game mechanics; any survivor can loop 15-20 seconds until the gates open without NOED, so you almost have to bring it to get downs, even Killers like Spirit suffer from how fast generators pop, since despite being able to close distance she still relies on her M1.**
---
but isn't that what is does?
---
Ahh, I remember this. Triple H breaking into Randy's house. Good ol WWE days
---
Nice! I live in Maui
---
Going against brain dead survivors who use dead hard poorly in the open, yeah it's really easy to predict. But a good survivor who can use it well can make it a lose lose scenario for the killer (if they can work around pallets, they can use the dead hard boost to get to the other side of the pallet, to where if you lunge you get stunned but if you don't lunge they still get the pallet down). 
---
Ghost face doesn't only have one hit downs: his terror radius and red stain are non existent while he is in his ability. This can make many loops (especially ones with big walls like a lot in trappers realm) very unsafe, as it makes it very hard to predict where the killer is heading.
---
Michael also again doesn't only have exposed: his vault speed is increased for both tier 2 and 3, his terror radius is decreased while he is weaker and is back to normal when he is at his strongest, and his lunge is increased in tier 3. Notice how both abilities come with benefits other than making it take one less hit. Also with the dead hard: if they're exposed and not injured they can't use dead hard, which is different compared to them being injured 24 7.
---
Although this guy is being an ass, DS is not currently comparable to NOES.
---
I know that but she has some resemblance of  wendigos, I've read in depth of all the characters lores I'm just saying she hears no resemblance of a regular human making her a humanoid answering your question.
---
100,000%, I need this in my life.
---
I know for a fact it doesn't depend on hearing the heartbeat. Because I was in a game where a wraith held the game hostage by body blocking me in a corner, he eventually DC'd and I pipped with 307% steathly evader points
---
I know. I just wanted to justify it to him because he was being an ass
---
Fair enough. See you in the fog!
---
ed
---
Too big of an impact is an overstatement. While it was harder for m1 killers to counter it, it's effects were not that bad, and technically speaking they did have a way to counter it (pulling survivors off of vaults/pallets), and again, the aura reading could help the killer a lot. It had a draw back and a decent ability. It was just a good perk, not really an op one.
---
Yeah for real. I'm not trying to be a tryhard or deal with tryhards. And I hate when I get toxic teammates or a toxic killer
---
The drawing is really good, but, the head looks small and the neck looks long (It might be only me) other than that, very good, keep drawing :)
---
What fanfic lol?
---
It's simple.
---
Tunneling is inappropriate unless they (the specific survivor you're tunneling) teabagged.
---
Teabagging is inappropriate unless they tunneled (unless the tunneling was because of teabagging).
---
Camping is never appropriate because it makes the Killer lose, unless the gate is open, in which case it's pretty logical.
---
and? NOED used to have a timer not any more so there was never a need to bring it up I just do not understand what point you tried to make at all
---
Agreed x1000. I fuckin hate when people do this I think it’s really weird and annoying.
---
His reaction once he realized!!
---
MIRROR MYERS, ENGAGE!
---
she was a human before she was tortured and killed she is a deformed version of a witch, her early name was gonna be "witch" but they changed it 
---
&gt;I just looked at her lore in the wiki, and it said that her work in progress name was the witch. But, her being African American and from what is probably the south, Louisiana. I think she is a voodoo practitioner, which is very didferent from witchcraft.
---
And maybe they wanted to be able to use witch at a later date on a more fitting killer.
---

I like to go back and look at my games to see what small things i miss...i catch myself doing this far to often when i lose a player...i also have learned...i don’t follow crows as much as i should 😂
---
Thx. Ths is new or ? I heard they wanna rewrk freddy and that yu can close the hatches but this......
---
.........nah.
---
You can also see it in game if you look at their hand as well since they have an animation for holding it. If you have trouble with items I recommend a perk called “Franklin’s Demise” which is a Leatherface teachable that makes survivors drop items when hit.
---
A 5 totem cleanse is a win in itself because it slows survivors down more than Ruin would most of the time. The only way you can really lose with NOED is if it gets cleansed right after it pops because a survivor happened to be next to the chosen totem.
---
With Adrenaline you can get instadowned while wasting the perk if it pops right before a killer hits you with an instadown ability or perk. You also have to risk getting downed early for not healing and - if the killer is next to you when it picks you up from the ground he'll easily down you again.
---
Therefore Adrenaline has a greater risk for no better reward
---
&gt; Devout: This is possibly the only balanced killer emblem as it rewards hooking all survivors multiple times and punishes you for tunneling certain survivors too much/ignoring others. As well as minimum guarantees Gold I believe for just sacrificing everyone.
---
I wouldn't say it's balanced, since it requires survivors rescuing people from the hooks. If people decide to rush gens or kill themselves on the first hook killer is fucked no matter what he does. 
---
It's my entire gripe with the current emblem system. Killer emblems require survivors playing at the very least decently to pip. 
---
Pips shouldn't be a reward/punishment imo. They should be a tool for matchmaking. As it is right now if the killer is so much better than survivors he's up against he manages to end the game super fast he will depip. And what does depiping does? It puts him up against even worse survivors. Why? So he can finish the next game even faster and Depip once again?
---
The significance of 4 man swf and the level of coordination is blown out of proportion. Hard to swallow pills for this sub I know.
---
It's something they carry and you can tell by if the hand is opened or closed besides that they're hard to see and for who the best is out of the default killers(assuming you aren't playing on console as they get hag and doctor for free) hillbilly is the easiest as his chainsaw makes for great mobility and downing Survivors plus enduring is a great teachable. For best perks Hag(PC dlc) has Hex ruin which is basically needed considering it slows the game down and Leatherface(dlc) has BBQ that shows what people are doing(more points also and Franklin's demise makes survivors drop their items.
---
Dying Light is a fun game, would definitely recommend. Did BHVR make a promotion with whoever made Dying Light or... Is that Steam's work?
---
Always do generators. I would expect it of the other three survivors if I were getting camped.
---
I will leave them die, I would expect them to leave me to die, no hard feelings; everyone gets unlucky against a facecamper sometimes.
---
Ones the gates are open or hatch is closed the timer starts, 60 second I believe, and if you don't make it out you die. It's pretty cool actually.
---
I will try dying light ty
---
Then you suffer a que cool down like any other game, the logic should apply for both kills &amp; survivors.
---
Low effort bait
---
Nah, we weren't trying to pip or escape or anything. Just give a birthday boy his birthday present.
---
I'll check that out, thank you!
---
Oh great. Well i made it like that eith the hatch : camp there. There was a gen right next to it. Survivor made it. I waited for it. Had noed. And then : si hitted her, she ran away, i made me invisible and waited, i saw her, mad eme visible and grabbed her in her animation and broughr her in th basement.
---
If that’s your intentions maybe you should play a different game, some of us actually want to play the game rather than sit in que waiting for matches.
---
I had a game against a Myers who carried me around the map for 7 minutes looking for the hatch then let me go! (and I got to spend 7 minutes staring at Myer’s booty so even better)
---
Oof
---
I mean you have 3 other people they could save you with borrowed time
---
Play how you want to play. Do whatever it takes to survive or kill everyone with whatever methods work best
---
Why though. That would just make getting to matches even harder to do and wasn't your point that it's too hard to get a match because of killers cancelling the lobby?
---
I got the same
---
You would find a match faster because killers wouldn’t want to wait themselves for disconnecting from lobbies. Works in other games &amp; would in dbd. You are failing to see the bigger picture. You would rather have the ability to dodge survivors.
---
*laughs in them likely not having it or the fact billy would literally grab them off or instantly down them before they can finish a rescue*
---
Time to teebag some zombie lol
---
Atleast i let her do her last gen and was nice to her but creeped her sometimes XD
---
She was he only one not toxic. The other 3 t bagged me. And died first ..
---
The other 2 teammates just there
---
What are you even talking about? Neither of those perks are remotely close to a clutch perk. DS punishes tunneling and that's it, that's not clutch. Dead Hard requires timing and is often easily countered by killers aware that you have it.
---
Even as a rank 1 killer I can still have some sympathy for some of the bs scenarios NOED has created for me both as the killer and survivor.
---
When you see a Sweat With Friends squad pop into your lobby, pick Wraith and put on Lightborn. Then stealth over to a gate, wait for them to blow up all 5 gens (3mins maybe) then open the gate.
---
They all escape, everyone depips.
---
If there are trolls, you work on your reporting system. If experienced players end up in the same game with new players, you work on your matchmaking system. The current matchmaking is garbage. Those issues you mentioned occur at every competitive team based game. But the well designed games don't create and arbitrary point based system to solve those issues. They reward winning instead.
---
For example, in League of Legends, you don't gain LP for a game you lost but finished because you had good KDA. You gain LP only when you win. This is how it should be. The focus should be surviving. The aim should be surviving. Not some arbitrary things you do along the way. Those should be done to ensure survival. Not the other way around.
---
Lol!  Yeah obviously OP was a piece of shit standing at a  campfire in a lobby....do you even listen to the things that you type man?
---
I think theyre on the right track with it since the last update. But i do feel like they need to rework the system instead of it being a 1-4 in each category, aka just bronze, silver, gold and iridescent. It needs to actually get harder to acquire those emblems the higher you go up along with making it harder to black pip, 1 pip and 2
---
GET OFF MY LAWN!
---
Why go for saves against a facecamping Bubba?
---
I don't like the idea of the bullet being easy to get, simply because it's a free down on a survivor if they're already injured, or he hits them and then shoots them.
---
I feel like it needs to cost at least 3 charges, if only because it means he has to choose between stalling the game with Black Bagging gens, or injuring survivors with his shot. He can trade his stalling potential for more damage events, and vice versa.
---
That way, the charges are somewhat difficult to acquire, and there's a real choice in how you use them.
---
Maybe he can passively Black Bag non generator items, and can spend his charges to Black Bag a hook with a survivor. While it's bagged, entity timer won't progress, but the survivor cannot be saved.
---
In my experience it happens a lot less than a survivor teammate dc'ing. I'd rather be dodged than play a 3v1 because some little bitch can't handle being smacked once.
---
I hate gen rush because it gives NOBODY POINTS
---
P eB b L e M e T a .
---
Thats up to Samuel Bayer and Wes Craven. Mostly Wes Craven because he directed the originals and new nightmare. But Samuel Bayer holds rights to the nightmare BHVR uses
---
It's just a waste of time.
---
Yo sick hacks dude
---
Update: played 3 games with GF tonight. First one I had a follower who killed my stalking, second game I got Lery’s, third game I got gen rushed to hell and back before I could gain momentum. It’s one of those nights but the fact that my motivation is not gone is good.
---
Leatherface. His power is simple to understand, he's easy to loop.
---
Trust me it pisses me off that people even talk about this, I’ve got like 17 p3’s and it seems like a kick in the balls for new players to eat their way just because they don’t want to grind, I’m saying I’m wouldn’t be too fussed assuming we get a new skin for our efforts, that’s why legacy skins became a thing to begin with, because they made it easier to grind, and I’m talking about a part 2 to the concept, I don’t want a skin that’s almost identical to legacy, console btw, we didn’t even have the chance to get legacy
---
They could definitely get him cosmetics the same way they got cosmetics for Tapp and Pig. It just has to be cosmetics that would make sense and are realistic for the characters. Not necessarily something that was seen on screen.
---
Both are equally frustrating lol
---
Tunneling is not toxic, it only shows how much of a tryhard you are.
---
Always start with Hag, Hex Ruin is life
---
Wrong. The risk Hexes bring is that they can be destroyed. Shitty totem spawns are being eliminated over time because the free ride for survivors is over.
---
&gt;The focus should be surviving. The aim should be surviving. Not some arbitrary things you do along the way
---
I have to extremely disagree with everything you're saying. You want the game to be bare bones with ranking up. Ranking up ONLY when you survive? or is it ranking up depending on how many survivors live based on your previous suggestion? 
---
There'd be absolutely no reason to do anything else in the game other than generators, that's one of the big problems the game has had since launch. Gen rushing would come back bigger than ever because that would be the only way to rank up. The game is healthier right now than what you're suggesting because it forces players out of their comfort zone and prolongs games for the killer.
---
Also your league comparison REALLY falls flat because literally the only similarity between them is you have allies, but even then it's so different I'd barely even say that's capable of being similar. And what you determine as a 'win' in DbD is just wrong, you don't win when you survive you win if you pip, meaning you have to do multiple things in the match, making it harder than just do some gens and escape.
---
He’s definitely not op your friends need to learn how to play against him.
---
except that flushing the toilets does not take 12s-15s
---
Noed has a counter. The counter to MoM was the face camp everyone and not let them take 3 hits. Only time I take Noed is on killers that can't defend ruin because people will just fly through gens with or without ruin so if I can't go protect it straight away since it's almost guaranteed that someone will spawn next to it, it's not worth having. And noed won't always spawn, it won't always make a difference sometimes the game ends early or the survivors do all the totems first. If you didn't get pre nerf MoM to work then you're doing something wrong or the killer was terrible and it didn't make a difference.
---
BNP, Exhaustion(both of which were extremely broken), Self-care, MoM, DS all got nerfed/QoL changes and they're still complaining. After bitching about Adrenaline, next up will be borrowed time, balanced landing/lithe, all the way down to Open Handed and Déjà Vu. 
---
See where this is going yet?
---
I made a survivor list of perks that should be changed, and most of yours are on there. What do you think? https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ca7352/potential_survivor_perk_overhaul/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Rank is pointless but yeah that’s good

True. A lot of people want the trench coat which i dont see happening by those rules :(
---
This man speaks truth!
---
"no t-bagging or flashlight clicking" how sad do you have to be to get mad at people t bagging lol
---
No I just don’t want my 20 or so months of grind to go unrewarded just because losers who just bought the game don’t want to grind, I have like 17 p3’s across survivor and killer, wouldn’t mind getting a free skin for all of them. (besides licensed obv) tbh I’d rather the grind be the same but I would be broken if the devs said they were going to change the system with no reward, I only made this because apparently this is an actual discussion and a change people actually want 😒
---
I never watched saw
---
What is this ?
---
For killers the best teachable I can think of are ruin, nurses calling,  bbq and chilli, save the best for last, monitor and abuse, surveillance, discordance, agitation, infectious fright and brutal strength.  Sadly a lot of them require paid killers or hoping for the shrine to give you something good. But it wont it will just keep giving you blood warden and the third seal
---
Noed ja just a shitty perk. So delete it and adrenaline and we are fine
---
Mmhmm 100%.
---
Yeah I’ve gotten hate mail but I find it funny. As for teabagging, it feels really bad. I’ve only had it happen to me once though. I’m trying to main legion so I’ll try to get bbq and ruin first I think. Thank you for your response.
---
In what way is it comparable to noed? DH rewards gameplay same as adrenaline. Downside for dh is that it gets cleansed. Downside to adrenaline is that 70% of the time the killer isnt even around you
---
Nope that's not the purpose of Reddits downvote
---
Add Unnerving Presence and you have the trifecta
---
I wish my dad was a badass
---
It's good for billy cause more often than not chainsaw is just a mobility tool. He's going to m1 a lot. But he can just choose to down the obsession with no consequence once he finds them while he still benefits a lot from the perk.
---
If the risk is that hexs can be destroyed after some time, just not in early game, thats not high risk. If it takes 5-10 minutes to destroy the hex because all totem spawns are well hidden, the killer has gotten 5-10 minutes of slow gen progress or one-tapped survivors with devour. That's not high risk, because the killer will be able to get value out of the perk without the risk of it being destroyed quickly. Ruin and Devour are balanced because of the weaker spawn totems.
---
I do think they could use a bit a rework so the really bad spawns are removed, but I do believe that the easier to find, average and well-hidden totems should stay. By taking a high-value perk like ruin or devour, its a risk that you might lose it before you can get any true value out of it or you might get a 4k with it. Thats what a high-risk, high reward perk should look like.
---
&gt;Using each other takes the same amount of time to heal, just split between 2 people. You'd be better off staying on a gen and letting the other person self care.
---
You’d be even better off both working on the generator and getting it done while you arent being chased.
---
In a properly functioning ranking system, if you assigned every player a random position and monitored the number of pips that were awarded, the mean would be zero. Exactly as many -1s as the total of +1s and +2s. Over enough games, everyone would move to their correct rank, by whatever criteria you're using to determine performance, however absurd those criteria may be at the moment, and then mostly safety. This is the absolute minimum required for rank to be meaningful at all.
---
Does anyone believe that's how the existing system functions? Well obviously not because rank reset exists, but putting that aside what would actually happen is all the high-skilled players placed in the bottom ranks would rocket straight back up to red, while even the very worst players placed at the top would very slowly regress to about mid-purple and stay there forever.
---
The devs seem to me to be pandering to, in my view, a rather bizarre expectation among many players that they should pip in any game where they do well. No. +1 *should* mean, "that game was a little easy for you, let's make the next ones a bit harder." What it actually means is, "meh, you did okay." +2 means you did okay and the game went on for a long time. Likewise, -1 should mean, "that game was too tough for you, the next ones will be easier." What it actually means is, "you died on your first hook."
---
I was rank 4 survivor within a week of buying the game. With no idea how to loop, without knowing what most perks do, with no idea how to counter most killers powers, much less their add-ons. What was I doing there? I'd get the occasional blessed -1, sure, but then the next game I'd be hooked twice in the first couple of minutes then the killer would be merciful, leave me alone, and I'd pip. Then I'd get a teammate who actually belonged in the red ranks looping the killer for three gens at the start of the game and I'd pip. Then someone would dc, the killer would farm and I'd pip.
---
Rank needs to be not based on how many games you've played this month, or how long those games happened to last. Not on how many gens you do, I'm always doing gens when I'm not on a hook after a ten second chase; not on whether you live longer than nine minutes, that's scarcely in the control of most survivors; not on how many unhooks/heals you get, if I'm getting a bunch of unhooks it's because my team is being destroyed, not because I'm doing well. Doing something *useful* should be rewarded with blood points; rank should be related to *skill*.
---
The simplest band-aid fix for the current rank system is: 
---
1. Fiddle with the thresholds for pipping until the average award approaches zero. (It may actually need to be slightly positive for a couple of obscure reasons, but in an idealised laboratory setting, zero is correct.)
---
2. Weight the chaser/evader emblem much more heavily than the others since it most closely maps to actual player skill.
---
3. Once that's shown to be working, and after a few more specific tweaks (one-shot killers getting screwed out of chaser, for example) put an end to rank reset, or do one final big reset to rank ten for everyone. (For the sake of people returning after a long absence, replace it with a slow regression that doesn't affect active players.)
---
Further down my wishlist would be getting the same number of people in each rank (or ranks 15-1 if you want to maintain a gated newbie community), increasing the effective rank of SWFs for matchmaking purposes, and having items/add-ons/offerings/perks/character level affect the requirements for pipping in a given match.
---
Just do gens and make sure to unhook everyone, When a person is hooked everyone will lose a bunch of points for that player, Unhooking him will restore those points and that happens for their for their first 2 hooks. It would probably be the main reason you de-pip
---
Ok then explain to me what the purpose of a dislike button is.
---
You're welcome ang good look in the fog!
---
Dead hard is broken on all platforms
---
Do da David
---
I highly suggest you get both. Especially at the higher ranks.
---
Maybe something like you have to get other points in order to get the bonus for not being found/stealthing. 
---
Like if you didnt do gens or help anyone. 
---
Cause I get both sides. You dont want to reward people for hiding the whole match but you want to be rewarded for actually stealthing and avoiding the killer.
---
Hacks are not needed for royalty peasant (to be honest, I just logged, on played one game and the level went wack)
---
Not everyone is trying to play for rank every match. The lack of a non ranked system meens that not everyone is trying to rank up. If people find doing that fun then that's up to them, just because they're playing in a way you don't enjoy doesn't mean they're doing it with malice. That's ultimately what toxic is. Not what the person is doing but rather what the intetions are behind what there doing. Everyone's just trying to enjoy the game, it's not fair to dictate what others can do based off our own experience.
---
Wraith is a cutie
---
Lol I was just kidding but nice
---
Well i guess its time to level up doctor and hag :D
---
*laughs in insidious*
---
Later into the night it can be pretty slow finding a game. It's not dead its more the matchmaking is slow and kinda unreliable. Generally you can find a game in under 3 minutes I would say although that's only recently it's been that quick as it can be way longer, I've waited 20 minutes or so before lol.
---
Good man! Do you have Ghost Face leveled up as well as you'll need his perk too?
---
I never thought of the entire team I thought of rank 20 megs who leave without helping the team when somebody gets hooked even though there is no noed and the Killer doesn't camp.
---
I find a surv lobby in less than 2 minutes. I guess only bad luck.
---
It's good, usually get a game in 2-3 minutes. Maybe some event was happening, or you played at night. Night time you won't find games.
---
You're bad at the game and going in tirades to justify it. I'm sorry that the degenerate strategy of 4 people hiding in lockers by the exit waiting for someone else to do the gens so they rush out the door isn't encouraged, it sure sounds like a great way to play!
---
I've been playing since Spirit's launch (september 2018) and I've always managed to find matches just fine regardless of time of day. Yesterday for example. How's your internet? The game doesn't do well with bad connections I'm afraid :/
---
Did he have any of the following?  Self Care, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, or Spine Chill?  If so, Uno reverse card that fool, since those are the crutchiest survivor perks imo.
---
Note, I don't have a problem with em, but if people wanna bitch about Killer perks then I feel turnaround is fair play.
---
I had some fellow survivors mock me for being terrible because I had like 6k at the end. But I did 1 full generator by myself and almost a second one. Then got found (someone then finished that gen) and then tunneled/camped after being saved. They didnt believe I had done almost 2 full gens because my points were low. 
---
Is there more to "objectives" than the main objective?
---
The ammo spawning in a random location, forcing him to break chase, would make sense and work with his ability to Black Bag a generator.
---
He can slow the game down, get a hit, and then go find a bullet. Maybe hitting with a bullet actually gives him charges, making it easier to charge up his black bag and executions.
---
Oh i didn't know it works with his saw now.  Ive been trying really hard to get it on myers so I can run a dead rabbit monitor and abuse infectious fright build.
---
being a piece of shit meaning loading into the lobby. classic toxic survivor move...smh
---
I would love craine as a survivor
---
Then turn your messages to friends only?
---
Definitely going to try that out today. Although 9/10 games are Freddy at red ranks on XBL atm.
---
The most I’ve gotten is 40k
---
Buy all dlc then you can play lil bitch
---
&gt; Ranking up ONLY when you survive? or is it ranking up depending on how many survivors live based on your previous suggestion?
---
I mean surviving as a team, not individual.
---
&gt; Gen rushing would come back bigger than ever because that would be the only way to rank up.
---
If gen rushing is too easy, you can balance it. Make it more time consuming to finish a generator or add some killer perks that will counter that strat or something. It doesn't make any sense to solve that issue with this stupid system. *I can easily finish the gens and escape, but I'll instead go find the killer and be chased for a while so I can collect some points.* Making players think this way is a very stupid. It is a way of covering the game design issues instead of solving them.
---
I gave League of Legends as an example because it is a successful, well respected competitive team based game with a multi-million e-sports structure, but I could've picked anything for my point. It doesn't have to be the same genre. My point is every successful game has a clear goal. For League of Legends, it is destroying the enemy Nexus. For Formula 1, it is finishing the race first. For soccer, it is scoring a goal. For basketball, it is shooting the ball through the hoop. What is the goal of this game? It should be to kill/escape. But instead you aim to do some gens, get chased for a while, destroy some totems, etc to collect enough points to until you get to a threshold.
---
That's not how you design a successful competitive game which is why Dead by Daylight is not a successful competitive game. It is a fun casual game, but it will never be competitive until the designers solve the underlying design problems instead of covering them.
---
OP probably had the audacity to prestige their survivor character or buy a cosmetic for them. As a reddit killer I deserve my right to 4k baby dwights all day long to feel better about myself. 
---
They were probably teabagging at the campfire anyways.
---
Why though, Freddy can just mindless spam 10 of them again within seconds.
---
Funny that i got both games, so i got both coupons lul
---
I would never join a party chat from a random while solo queuing. I bet most people wouldnt either
---
All messages come through on Xbox
---
I’ve been bouncing around a lot to unlock perks. But yeah I’ve lost some pips because I don’t know how to play this killer or that killer isn’t viable or what not. I don’t mind much though I’m not looking to get into red ranks anyway. That shit sounds toxic as fuck.
---
Prayer Beads for Spirit, Iri hatchets fo Huntress, Omega blink(catatonic boy's treasure + ataxic respiration) for Nurse and... Mint Rag for Hag. If you catch someone as Mint Rag Hag, this is usually gg, especially if you put them in the basement.
---
The number of generators completed must exceed the number of people alive for the hatch to spawn, but it will always spawn with one survivor left.
---
You say by cleansing you save time that otherwise would have been wasted healing? You literally can’t heal when broken. This couldn’t be further from the truth. The reason why you don’t cleanse is so that you turn her into an easily loopable m1 killer with no extra abilities. The problem is your whole team has to be on board. If one person isn’t they fuck the whole team and the fort is wasted.
---
&gt; A whole minute is practically nothing honestly 
---
Wtf you clearly have no idea of the worth of time in DBD. Just dont cleanse and genrush her. Its not only open spots and its not like Iri Huntress. Its easier to use and it can also be used on multiple survivors even at L-T Walls.
---
yeah man i hate when survivors have the audacity to wear cosmetics that they earned or bought when they load in my lobby. so toxic.
---
Did you deinstall your old gpu drivers and install your new ones properly?
---
Two is good. Three is a crowd!
---
I already did to someone else
---
Are you a troll?
---
”SoDamnToxic” and Franklin's Demise saying that, yeah sure we believe you.
---
The PSN messaging system is so obnoxious. It sends you a notification to say “zxpus$yslayoR9000” has added you to a group” and then sends another notification when the actual message is sent.
---
Well I want you to explain it to me since I don’t see it
---
Awesome game if you have friends to play with
---
Like the other guys have said, ABSOLUTELY MUST level hag for ruin
---
Your submission to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots. 
---
Well yea, not trying to sound like an asshat but you didn’t really prove your skill by holding m1.
---
Because leaving them up hurts your team.
---
Rank means literally nothing, play the game because it’s fun not for artificial skill labels that only get you into less fun matches
---
Wrong post, buddy
---
Back in the day when we thought it was still real. 😁
---
You need a rework.
---
Oh I saw dead and thought he was talking about dead hard lol my b 😂
---
I was referring to matches against other killers that require you to heal not against Plague. Going down in one hit isn’t no where near as easy to loop as two states. Going down in two hits with the amount of broken loops in the game currently with a competent team can do some real damage. If going down in one hit was only a minor inconvenience nobody would play Myers and Ghostface.
---
I would agree if ruin wasn’t mandatory on all builds.
---
lol this^
---
Why on earth would you eat burger while also playing? Or eat anything at all that leaves your fingers dirty.
---
Qait I’m confused did the killer close hatch? Because it doesnt say the hatch is open
---
You dont' T-bag to catch the killers attention away from your wookie teammates?
---
Sometimes I miss the rhythm of spacebar-pressing
---
Rank doesn’t matter, just have fun
---
Beaming ray of sunshine, aren’t ya?
---
Awesome throws, I can imagine the reactions on their faces!
---
Ghostface never wore the devil suit on film but here we are, they can just make some
---
Sorry can’t read stupid.
---
Frist off , how can I enter the vanilla experiment lmao
---
Spirit Needs a rework /s there I fixed it for you
---
Thanatophobia is shown if it’s being used so you don’t have to worry about it unless you see it even then the actual affects are very minimal in the overall game sense. The worrying about black incense in my opinion is very hit or miss I’d only worry about it if someone did cleanse because then the plague can use it along side corrupt purge to get a super easy slugfest going. You waste time by not doing the objectives if you go to cleanse, as well as if you cleanse you can very easily get infected again just by 1 hit of her vile registering on you or hitting an infected interactable. While it may not trigger a health state if you always cleanse no matter the level of vile it results in a corrupted pool and it takes time out of doing the gennys. If nobody cleanses that in turn makes her a M1 killer and M1 killers are for the most part the weakest killers in the game so cleansing basically gives her a buff it doesn’t help you in any facet aside from you not being heard. Also even if you don’t get hit by her corrupt purge doesn’t mean your teammates won’t and if you lose enough teammates you normally end up losing the match all together.
---
So nice. People hated this perk before, now its getting love!
---
Wrong, Nea is the entity,
---
The wraith in reality is The spirit, and the spirit the nurse.
---
&gt;Same with unhooking. You take a risk unhooking someone while the killer is near and can get hit for it. 
---
Can't this be applied to pallet blinding? You took a risk of kicking a pallet with a survivor with a flashlight right there.
---
Perfect
---
wow
---
Guess you don’t know oh well downvote = dislike
---
It doesn't have to be, it just has to be fun and for tge most part it is
---
The corrupt purge is not loopable. That's it.
---
In that sense, every perk is a crutch perk.  
---
Adrenaline - you should have been dead on your last hook, but you suddenly get up and live 
---
Unbreakable - you should be dead on the ground, but then you get up
---
Borrowed Time - you should be dead, when you were getting unhooked
---
Ds - get on the ground, when I hit you
---
From a killer perspective, they are just the same as noed. 
---
What is the definition of a crutch perk?  
---
I can’t find one, because all perks work in the same way.  
---
Some are stronger, some are weaker.
---
Nope that's incorrect
---
No I do know
---
Looks like you don’t
---
Damn you must've had a easy time in clown school with the way you're acting
---
Looks like I do lmao
---
YOU FOOL, YOU FELL VICTIM TO ONE OF THE CLASSIC BLUNDERS!
---
Useless anecdotal rant incoming 
---
Not saying you deserved it in the slightest but when I see people with your skin I get horrible flashbacks to being newer to this game: getting looped to hell and t bagged vigorously, along with flashlight spams and then when I finally down them they dc. 
---
Tunneling is never okay but if I had a choice of 2 survivors in a equal situation I'd probably chase you first simply cause I know you're gonna get shit done lol. Also from a straight winning perspective might as well get that dcer to dc asap even though it screws over everybody else unfortunately.
---
Lol you are part of the community, what you doin at recess? I got a bag of green sticky icky
---
Really looks like you don’t lmao
---
"I got my team mate killed because I have no situational awareness, but don't worry, I really stuck it to them at the end!"
---
Really looks like I do
---
Nope
---
This is so sad. I hope one day you learn how to read.
---
But you get the job done in 15 secs and can start cranking a gen together
---
I don't think he needs a total rework as much as just fine tuning some of his stat values.  Maybe like a 30% reduction to their salt meter and a 25% decrease on balance suggestions based our of ignorance.  This OP cube would make them much more viable at high ranks.
---
Oh no he's retarded. I'll leave you alone
---
And don't forget about Kate (please)
---
How about the ability to mark your own hex at the start of the game? Instead of it being random you would approach a hex and interact with it to place it.
---
I'm no professor but he seems to have replied to you in English so mission accomplished?
---
Awesome
---
Honestly I’ve found a strategy that works for me from time to time but you have to be quick. So if someone does cleanse their vile you immediately cleanse then get vile from a genny cleanse get vile from a genny then cleanse. Your attempting to make all the fountains reset to being pure so that the killer doesn’t have a chance to use the corruption. This really works very well if you have another friend in game to do it with but can work pretty well if other survivors start cleansing themselves. Since all fountains revert to pure if all are corrupt it removes the plagues chance of picking up a corrupt vile.
---
The fucking Dwight running across what was a tense moment is what killed me.
---
Didn´t know that. Just thought i could give this Coupon to someone who doesn´t have dbd yet, because why not :) Thanks tho!
---
Try dead rabbit with m&amp;a. You literally have no terror radius in EW2
---
I blind killers all day long. They put flashlights in the gane so you could use them.
---
You would have known they were behind you if you did what you are expected to do on a chase and rotate your camera.  You should never toss a pallet blind.  You didn't even know if the killer would be there to justify the toss let alone if there was a survivor for you to sandbag.
---
The problem about Leatherface is that his power is incredibly powerful and incredibly easy to use so to balance it you have to make a lot of adjustments which technically makes his power completely useless. Any changes to the adjusments they made may make his power completely broken so his entire power shoud be reworked.  
---
And lets be honest, his power is super boring.
---
The matchmaking is hot garbage. 20k players on PC and I have to wait 5-10 minutes for a match as killer and only wait 5 seconds for a survivor game.
---
On ps4 I have to wait 40 minutes sometimes. On laptop less than one minute.
---
Two injured teammates, they both self care taking up a total of 64 seconds.
---
Two injured teammates, one has Empathy, they run to the other taking x amount of time.  They heal each other taking 32 seconds, and the other has an extra perk slot.
---
oh my god, that was pretty good.
---
“dyINg lIghT DlC?!?!”
---
I feel like NOED is a cheap perk. I always try to make sure to cleanse any totems i come across but I cant keep getting them all game after game. Yesterday, for example, i was playing david and this really bad wraith got me with that perk. I feel like it carries people that doesnt deserve to be carried
---
I should add that i really didnt see the wraith coming and he had addons to make his appeareance faster but mAn
---
Lmao wtf
---
How do you play the mobile game?
---
I agree, this is most likely what's going on. Also I think it should be pretty easy to fix, they could lower the % amount of GF's body that has to be in the survivor's invisible circle, or just have a distance check between you and GF
---
Don't give me ideas. I might write it down for a potential meme. :P
---
Eh.. it's a shitty situation
---
I hit rank 1 every reset and I love it/hate it
---
It sucks getting mostly Nurse/Spirit games but teammates are much better. At purple/green ranks you get dumb teammates, more killer variety, but also more camping/NOED.
---
Insidious is a dumb perk, but rip that trapper i guess
---
How many items from their outfits you have
---
Number of cosmetics pieces you own / in the shop
---
The amount of cosmetic items for that killer
---
Thanks
---
Bro same
---
Dumbest comment of the week award goes to /u/kingcocomango
---
He put himself in time out. He knows what he did.
---
He is a cutie tho
---
As I said, I watch a lot of youtubers playing, I know what a lot of the tile running strats are, and iv'e gotten pretty good results from moonwalking and stuff like that, but on any loop(s) where the survivor can clearly see me over/through the loop, there isn't much Wraith can do about it besides keep chasing till entity blocker. With a purple, maybe a green Windstorm, you can push them out of the loop or bodyblock the vault, but that's add-on reliant. He also of course has next to no map presence without Windstorm. I could just break the chase whenever it's going unfavorably for me, but without things like Hex Ruin to slow down progression, I don't know if that will really work out at all.
---
Imagine roleplaying in DBD, that's like roleplaying in League of Legends lmao
---
*Top 10 anime plot twist*
---
I got it at the same time as you and I've been playing since then, matchmaking was definitely best right when they made it free for a month, since then it's gone up and down and right now it's in an alright state. Getting on late usually means way longer que times tbh, especially for killer. If you're on PS4 though you can join the dbd community and usually find a group to play SWF (Survive with friends) with relatively fast or a KYF (Kill your friends) private match that way you can use all the perks as well if you wanted. If matchmaking is taking too long for me I usually go there to help out.
---
When the parents walking in while you watch anime and it suddenly morph into a weird shit hentai
---
Well it's not against the rules so...
---
Tbh I keep having killers who camp. It's so annoying. And I went to rank 15 finally I got so happy. Only for the next match to be camped by a killer and de-rank to 16 again ffs.
---
You knowing how to run tiles would also mean that you know what buildings/rooms to avoid. Not all maps have pallet loops that you can see over. There is nothing you can do on a loop where they can see you. You’re not gonna get autohaven every time. 
---
And yes, breaking a chase in a strong area of the map against someone who knows how to play is a lot better than letting them run their broken loops, especially without ruin. Your job as a killer is to gain momentum through the worse players, so wasting all your time on the best one is stupid. 
---
You need to play games to get points and perks. You have noed already, which can easily win you games. Sloppy isn’t terrible. Bitter is decent information. You make it sound like all players are insanely good at this game when they aren’t.
---
I wonder if anyone could win a match as killer while following all these rules
---
I tried messaging them sorry but they had there messages turn off unfortunately.
---
The survivors broke rule#1 of the killer's rulebook for survivors: A survivor is NEVER allowed to work on generators and must alert the killer where they are and let the killer hook them.
---
nothing is more scary than a huntress who knows how to snipe you behind a rock
---
You can cleanse all totems and deny noed, can't deny adrenaline.
---
I mean I get the mentality kinda if you play swf cause you can communicate to your team to not cleanse as well and tell each other where the killer is at as a heads up because everyone is one shot. I play by myself a lot so 1. Most people cleanse themselves anyways and 2. If I don't cleanse myself, I can't loop the killer as efficiently because I don't have an extra hit to play around with, I'm gonna need to drop pallets way faster, aka hurting the team more than cleansing would most of the time.
---
😂 funny
---
Can I get some dial up with that Jesus Blendette please.
---
in your case that kate deserve to die
---
It’s lunch break, and I was in a shitty mood, but seeing this made my Monday instantly better. Have an upvote my friend
---
Wraith had a add-on pass time ago
---
Her add-ons are shit as fuck. I stopped playing her because of her boring add-ons so I want her to be reworked
---
I fully *hate* nurse mains who choose to teleport. ^Trash ^players
---
But for hooks the killer brings them to the entity. In this case the entity just killed them meaning the killer didn’t do his job
---
Not toxic, just very annoying.
---
Yeah you're right 😂
---
Basically some sort of private testing where everyone is running perkless and add-onless
---
My post got stolen aswell don’t worry
---
I started playing the game again about 2 months ago and had the same problem. I playing survivor a lot then moved to killer because of how important perks are on killer. A survivor without the meta perks is ok, but a killer without them will struggle imo. I’d just get we’re going to live forever on survivor from David King and play a lot of survivor
---
Ah, I thought there was a way to block em, carry on then.
---
Could to do cool Dwight?
---
I have seen this 2 times already.... wonder why?
---
congrats, your the reason why the dbd community is bad :D
---
Add-on buffs arent a rework, his power needs to be changed to be more useful
---
Change it to mouse wheel down and never accidentally die again. It's insane how much of a difference this made for me and everyone else I've seen give this tip.
---
The best thing is when a 4 man joins with medkits and i pick omegablink nurse to find out when in the game they brought instaheals, a haddonfield offering and 2 are using object of obsession. Knowing that i get to shit on them while new killers they were hoping to find don’t experience their bullshit playing wraith or trapper
---
LOL 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
---
The different body shots sound interesting, but this is basically a huntress reskin no? Just a few changes?
---
And Dwight is a locker.
---
You're speaking on perfect scenario. If the hatch is closed and you're actively being chased then it doesn't work. 
---
Im talking about the hatch being closed and you're actively being chased.
---
&gt;"I'm not saying you're toxic, I'm just saying your outfit is toxic."  
---
FTFY  
---
Also holy shit you're actually serious, aren't you?
---
Eh, I like that he has an instant down attack. Its decently accurate to the movie as well so I don't mind it
---
I dont get that very often and most of the time you can just look up
---
It’s like 5 button presses. It’s not really out of the way.
---
Fast and accurate personally I'd hate that drop a pallet dead, vault a wall dead, loop na it's annoying enough facing the huntress with purple axe heads and you'd get hooked and the killer would just reload the gun as you were swinging there. Plus the add ons would have to be extra ammo capacity quicker reload times, Least with the huntress there's a level of skill that goes along with it. If the killer was using any visability perks they could down people a cross the map off a sound notification with a single trigger pull or mouse click think it would just be completley busted.
---
You are literally why facecamping is a strategy that works. Congratulations.
---
Why would anyone go down there when they know its a bubba
---
That's what i wonder but they do it anyway
---
The end game chat should have banners that show if people are swf or solo
---
&gt; you want to be rewarded for actually stealthing and avoiding the killer.
---
The problem with this is if you get four survivors in a game with this mindset. Not only does it end up being a game of hide and seek, instead of a real game of DBD, but the killer then has to handicap themselves to make sure they aren't tunneling the one person who isn't as good at hiding as the rest.
---
I use it mainly to bm them as they try to blind me, and it makes it where the few times they would've perfectly blinded you impossible to get.
---
Thank you for explaining and the advice!
---
No problem lol this is mostly from rank one experience with the spirit :)
---
Damn.. this explains why sometimes I go down with only one hit. I never knew that. Thank you!
---
If you think iron will and spine chill are only good versus spirit, then I know exactly why you think spirit is uncounterable. Also, if it's that good of a spirit, use pallets and window vaults.
---
Damn very nice!
---
There would still be a visual indicator, this means no fake husk plays, no pallets slaps, and no misdirection to a different survivor against SWF
---
'cuz we was too busy looking at dat ***A S S***.
---
Why shouldn't you be able to distract and piss off somebody doing everything they can to *kill* you and your teamates? This community is hilarious.
---
The only reason this becomes 'bad' is if the killer gets really offended by it - which is due to them losing - which means they are being a sore loser. Stop getting so angry, chill out, congratulate the survivors and move on.
---
Killers legit will get pissed off if you do none of this but have them in a chase / loop for a long time. Or hit them with multiple pallets. "stop looping". "Then stop chasing me you degenerate, i'm not trying to loop i'm trying to get away."
---
The only reason people get pissed off in this game is because it didn't go their way. And it is easy to portion that to 'toxicity' when the other side is working as a team or celebrating. Or if its a killer, 'not giving survivors enough of a chance' or celebrating.
---
If you have a really fun game and get teabagged at the end, then you are not going to be upset.

#*VOLARE VIA*
---
I find games in seconds, so definitely not dead
---
Other than perks, bloodweb are for add ons and items so saying to neglect over a perk when it’s RANDOM isn’t logical. 
---
There more perks, the less chance of getting it in your bloodweb. Stop bypassing unrelenting everytime and buy it. Keep grinding... its the point
---
There is no rightfully in this game.  
---
Only from your biased survivor perspective.  
---
The game lasts until the last survivor is dead or has left.  
---
Up until then, it's an open playing field.  
---
What about the games, when you had all 4 survivors down at least 2 times.  
---
But they all got up again, due to Unbreakable.  
---
And it doesn't even end there, everyone gets up a third time with Adrenaline.  
---
What about the games, when you had hooked everyone twice.  
---
But you can't get that last kill, because everyone is running Borrowed Time and DS and the chases are endless.  
---
You can contrive examples of games, when it is "unfair" for the killer to win all day long, but the very same can be done for killer games.  
---
When you played so well the whole game, but end up with no kill, due crutch survivor perks.  
---
Most of those perks are one time use, but you have to consider that they are spread out on 4 survivors.  
---
So you can get each one of them 4 times.  
---
That's just a problem of numbers in a 1 vs 4 game.
---
&gt; NOED is a counter to losing
---
Of course it is, just like all the other survivor perks I just listed.  
---
They are a counter to losing as well.
---
But the survivor rule book specifically says you can’t use noed lol jk
---
No Mither &gt; Self Care
---
Spirit has counterplay, prayer beads spirit not so much, but that's another story. Also, plenty of killers in this game have perks that counter their kit. Run an exhaustion perk and 3 perks for killer you suck against, easy. Most of the time, that perk will have use against the other killers. For example, small game counters freddy and lets you see hexes better. Iron will helps escape chases against legion and spirit or other hit and run killers, spine chill is a stealth killers nightmare. Namely micheal myers and ghostface. You have 4 perks, if there's a counter, and you simply refuse to run it, then it's not the game's fault.
---
No problem. 
---
Feel free to tag or pm me if you have more questions in the future.
---
Dude holy shit I was in this game haha, DWIGHT YOU LEGEND!!!!!!
---
No. You pretending the community is bad is the reason you think the dbd community is bad.
---
If you didn't have this secret rulebook then you wouldn't bat an eyelid. You are a minority of redditers / steamers who visit a community bubble that does not represent the whole playerbase. And you think every player should just know? Completely disregard having fun and follow your rules? never gonna happen
---
If it is in the game, it is legit. Don't complain about players, complain to the devs. (But then you realise how ridiculous you sound). 
---
It is even more laughable claiming that people like this guy, talking common sense, are the reason the community is 'bad'. Like if he hadn't have commented, or hadn't 'not given a fuck' about a bit of playful teabagging, then suddenly the 75+% of players (random guess) who don't visit this subreddit would play by your rules. Lmao.
---
He's not on PS4? That's odd. He's on Xbox, so I just assumed he was on there as well
---
any m1, i like it on spirit, wraith, trapper, etc
---
If you lower the % that makes him infinitly more breakable from all distances giving him no chance to hide. The distance thing could work but would need a lot of testing to make sure it plays well with whatever system they already use to calculate it.
---
Electric man that can fuck up generators? 
---
Sorry doc you don’t count even though you’d did that. 
---
“I bet the only time we’ll see a gun” wait stop we have billy has one.
---
Wait, are they removing him and the perks? I just thought PlayStation didn’t get him, but this comment confused me
---
only when you finish gen
---
so what? i mean that he stalks like michael, and can delete his TR like pig. The stalking is super slightly changed. and that’s it.
---
not to the same extent. noed is a last chance for killer to get kills. they have to have the exit open. they are almost out. you could complete the first gen and get one hit. its not to the same extent. different levels
---
Your best bet is to start with Killers who are easy to play without good perks or add-ons.
---
Among the free Killers, included in the base game:
---
- Trapper is fairly strong at low ranks, and only really *needs* his yellow bag add-on.
---
- Hillbilly is one of the 3 strongest Killers in the game. Great mobility and he can one-shot.
---
If you want to grind iridescent shards (although, they can be bought):
---
- Hag is a stronger Trapper, doesn't need any add-ons and gives you the utterly essential Ruin perk.
---
- Spirit is hard to learn, but very strong against pallets.
---
If you want to pay:
---
- Michael Myers/Ghostface: Two very similar Killers. Myers is easier to play, but Ghostface is better against loops.
---
- Pig is great at slowing games down and is only reliant on her VHS tape add-on.
---
- Freddy Krueger is highly versatile, with great mobility, but is quite complicated to learn.
---
How tf you see that survivor blending in the environment!?
---
You think? So you aren't sure what the rules are?
---
Sorry this doesn’t technically answer your questions but look at my tag and that’s exactly me to the point.
---
I'm stuck at green ranks because rank update error.
---
GET IN THE FUCKING LOCKER DWIGHTJI!
---
For close range/in chase hits it helps to hold on to the Hatchet. 
---
Not only does charging the Hatchet increase it's speed when it is thrown making it harder for Survivors to avoid, Survivors will usually look behind them and try to dodge, so it's usually a good idea to wait until they dodge and then throw at them.
---
It's a lot harder than it sounds, because you basically have to try and predict where the Survivor will be while also not making it obvious that you're predicting them. If you make it too obvious good Survivors will be able to tell where you're going to throw and avoid the Hatchet.
---
Amother thing with close range hits is to pay attention to the environment.
---
Always look out for dropped pallets and windows, if you think a Survivor will use one you can usually get a free hit since they can't dodge while vaulting. Don't throw prematurely though, some Survivors will run at but then avoid the vault, attempting to bait you into throwing.
---
There are also a number of spots on low wall loops where you can hit Survivors with your Hatchets by throwing through or over the obstructions. Getting these hits takes experience, since you have to know what you can throw through or over and what you can't. You'll also have to anticipate the Survivor; since some will crouch to try and avoid the Hatchet.
---
Just like Nurse, a lot of it is practice and experience; especially on PS4 because of potential frame rate dips and how hard it can be to aim with the joysticks. (If you are continually struggling with aiming, it might help to go into DBD's in-game settings and lower the Killer sensitivity slider. I haven't tried this personally, but it might make it easier to control where you're aiming your hatchet.)
---
For longe range/out of chase hits it just comes down to luck and getting a feel for how to arc Hatchets over obstructions and onto your target.
---
If you're really after snipes I recommend using the perks Bitter Murmur and/or BBQ and Chili and the Very Rare add-on Glowing Concotion so you can see the Survivors' auras.
---
Glowing Concotion is largely useless most of the time, but when you land a cross map hit it will tell where the Survivor goes after getting hit, giving you a chance to go for a second hit and down them.
---
Sorry about the novel; hope it was of help in some way and I hope you have fun playing Huntress. :p
---
If you have any questions just ask.
---
Truthfully if people cared about being and staying in R1, game where one person gets chased for 2+ gens should never ever happen. But how time crunched this game is, beyond one whole generator of chasing means you’re going to either get tilted and lose or just continue chasing and lose. The survivors in that game will mash out gens and even the person in the chase gets Residual Lightbringer for totems and gens done while they’re getting chased now, they get bonus Evader for pallet stuns and while they’re benevolent will suffer by never going past baseline, even if that one survivor was the only one who got hooked and killed that whole game, the other three survivors would all safety pip at worst and the killer depips for being bad at all four categories. 
---
This is where the inclusive rules of the game start to fall apart because the people playing killer will naturally want to use the most efficient killer they can to end their chases as fast as possible and keep their lightbringer as high as possible, so naturally it’ll be harder for a survivor to double pip at that rank but between you and me I could care less about the struggles of R1 players. In my eyes, they done need an easier time because effectively all they need to do is Safety Pip every game and they’ll stay R1 until reset; the single/double pip for them is utterly worthless.
---
I like being blinded at pallets. They royally screw themselves over every time, headphones op.
---
Self-care is almost neccessary for a solo survivor, just saying.
---
D E A D H A R D
---
Enduring
---
It is. You ruin the game for other people.
---
Me: pulls 3 people off hook
---
Also me: dies but still pips
---
It’s all about that altruism guys.
---
Slippery meat
---
Lingering potion would be more on point
---
Thanks :)
---
Try playing killer and sweating your ass off and getting the same result. Ranking up as a survivor is a fuckin joke
---
They might be new and don't know that they are doing a wrong thing, they just think "hey I can secure my kill so easily like this" and don't actually know that camping gives them penalties, teabagging will just make them more frustrated and they will probably quit the game after a while, seriously if you are a baby killer or struggle at playing you get fucking traumatized (basically me days ago), let's think about it, who's the killer that has a minimum knowledge of the game think that camping is a legit strat (tunneling is ok sometimes if you have to recover from a bad start, or you have to activate the worst perk dying light)
---
A pissed off killer makes mistakes.
---
Why *wouldn't* the survivors try and do everything in their power to cause the killer to make the game easier for the team as a whole?
---
Someone called me bad because i didn't tunnel and camp people as killer.
---
RIP.I.P
---
why would you ever do that hahaha
---
Bro where the fuck you see her being obese, tahts pure thiccnes
---
It's permanent.
---
try using better bait
---
His game is dead, and the game doesnt have the license for freddy va jason and the remake version
---
A Volatile would be really cool in DBD! What would be the power?
---
Why would they remove endgame collapse? It prevents hatch standoffs and ends the game in 2-4 minutes
---
Make me stop
---
That's fine, I don't kink shame. Fatties need love too, I suppose.
---
When the lawsuit is over, probably they release Jason, i never said the next killer
---
Gens regress at 1/4 repair speed, base ability regresses double for 30 seconds, so he can regress gens 15 seconds or almost 20%. The concept of tv static is cooler than BHVR’s mask men, but you need to rework his power. The funnest part about this game is chases and the bullets ruin that, maybe try and exposing the survs with them instead of hitting them because being downed uncontrollably sucks, but being exposed uncontrollably is already part of the game. Plus he would still have to chase after he lands the bullet so the player feels skilled instead of just, pressing m2
---
you spelt “play for succulent blood points” weirdly
---
Coordination brotha, coordination.
---
Yknow what you got me there, my bad
---
Hey! He's trying his best!
---
I never said now, when te lawsuit is over, they will add him 100%
---
Why would they
---
Ah, he uses bond just in case if a second killer joins the match
---
Buddy I play both sides pretty equally, you’re clearly a killer main. NOED is the most OP perk in the game and nothing approaches it, it has a huge effect even in games where the killer doesn’t have it because it forced survivors to try to cleanse totems. 
---
All of your examples are pretty irrelevant, none of them compare to a killer who got dominated still getting kills just because of 1 perk after they’ve lost the main part of the game handily. Survivor perks like DS and borrowed time only really counter killers who play like complete assholes and camp or tunnel all game.
---
I’m only gonna be able to think of iggy when I see tarot card: the fool
---
Lmao
---
Sorry, I'm just more scared than you :(
---
But Freddy has been deemed too op by a lot of “survivor mains” as well so just don’t play the game at all
---
_"Hmmm hmm... hm hm... hmmm hmm.."_
---
I play whatever I want unless the devs removes it otherwise.
---
Don’t downvote because you don’t agree, downvote because of shitty argumentation.
---
Bitter Murmur.
---
Just watch monto videos on YouTube. You are welcome.
---
Epic gamer moment
---
you shouldnt stalk at all. that makes people feel uncomfortable! feels by daylight might not be the game for you
---
I'd like a different colour legacy (a more reddish?) skins for all killers and survivors awarded from Devotion levels, like 1 piece per 5/10/whatever Devotions or something.
---
As long as it couldn't me mistaken for OG legacy.
---
Without the “grind”, this game would be dead. The grind could be easier, but that’s not the point. 
---
Having everything unlocked would become incredibly boring. You’re playing without a purpose at that point.
---
I love michael, hag, spirit. myers and hag aren’t really meta, but still super fun
---
No you don't. You can do it in console settings.
---
I like the grind too, I play on xbox and I'm quite happy that they add new goals to go for there's allways something to be working towards.
---
Perks, 
---
Achivements, 
---
Or even just knowing every match is account level progress and Iridesant shards I've managed to unlock Legion, Jeff and Adam with just playing if I had all the perks I wanted on every character I wouldn't be exited about unlocking anything new :D plus the additional goals encourage an adaptable play style.
---
Will be even more interesting when they release the Archive.
---
From the way this person talks I think you won because at least one of them was a noobie. Though it doesn't mean you wouldn't win against some good survivors too :)
---
Yeah they did this change some time ago, works all the time with Billy.
---
especially since there’s no reward for rank
---
It's a coin-flip, half the time it means playing with friends; the other half of the time - it means at least one of the people don't want to play against a killer of similar rank.
---
noed on LF. hahahah
---
ZA WARUDOOOOO
---
holy shit back rooms as map
---
Iron Will is a very good perk. Better than Self Care.
---
I didn’t know god played dbd
---
Then two survivors are operating at 50% health _and_ together. If i'm a slugging killer, that's a perfect gift wrapped package.
---
Everything is situational. If you've got 5 gens left, staying injured and working on a gen together is incredibly stupid. If you've only got 1 or 2 and you're making adrenaline plays, that's different.
---
Username checks out :)
---
I think we should have a totem icon like the generators to indicate how many still need to be cleansed, as a solo survivor I cleanse whenever possible but when it gets to the last gen I never know if I'm going to get slapped with noed. Personally I play both survivor and killer and I think it's totally fair both sides.
---
If you're sliding across the pallet and the chainsaw goes through the pallet at the same time it fully makes sense to take damage, I don't see how anyone could think otherwise.
---
Just like when someone drops a pallet at the same time you're hit, it's literally possible if the killers wing and the pallet drop align correctly.
---
nice
---
Would be good if you got a sum of blood points or something based off rank each month would hopefully discourage people from Afking and Dcing as much as they do now.
---
I said same speed as survivor, didn't I?
---
I've never thought that devs will consider this almost non-existant situation and program it in mind.
---
And here i am, denied entry twice, just wanting to participate in vanilla gameplay while people want rewards for doing it :/
---
Lmao yeah I think too highly of them sometimes so that makes sense😂.
---
Ideally it would make sense to happen but them programming it in like you said is something else entirely xD
---
Well the things is, you somewhat dont really need to cleanse totems, you just need to remember where they are, if a killer does have NOED at the end just go around and see if any of the totems are lit
---
This is almost exactly how the old system worked,  and it was terrible
---
Because its rude? If you have to use every dirty trick possible to win then you're not a very good survivor
---
dream pallets are so fun tho
---
they provide a more consistent help
---
‘You only killed me because you used your power’
---
What I love the most is playing killer and absolutely destroying the survivors because they played terribly and barely getting a black pip for my trouble.
---
I got flamed because, while in the process of trying to pick up Freddy, during endgame, I decided that come hell or high water, I was getting a kill, and camped a dude to death while the other 3 escaped. I'm a rank 19 killer and I don't tend to do well in first person, but I've been doing Freddy games cause he's my favorite slasher, and I'm usually able to get 3 kills now, survivors are just rude af so now I just gg and move on
---
what IS lag switching exactly. i mean i know it’s when you do something so the game lags the fuck out. but what is that something
---
Nice! Couldn't he have shocked you, or does it not affect hatch?
---
it’s a joke buddy
---
T H E  D A M  C R I N G E!!!
---
&gt;Buddy I play both sides pretty equally, you’re clearly a killer main.
---
Cool that makes two of us, but I probably play a bit more survivor than killer.  
---
&gt;it has a huge effect even in games where the killer doesn’t have it because it forced survivors to try to cleanse totems.
---
Just like Borrowed Time, Self Heal, Decisive Strike and Adrenaline have a huge effect on the game.  
---
As a killer you have play around those perks as well, just because there is a chance they might have them.  Same for noed.  
---
&gt;Survivor perks like DS and borrowed time only really counter killers who play like complete assholes and camp or tunnel all game.
---
Besides nothing being wrong with tunneling or camping, too many survivors escape the trial, because they get unhooked next to the gate with BT and DS.  
---
And as a killer you can do absolutely nothing against it.  
---
Certain kills get ripped out of your hands, "unrightfully".  
---
&gt;All of your examples are pretty irrelevant, none of them compare to a killer who got dominated still getting kills just because of 1 perk after they’ve lost the main part of the game handily. 
---
Again, the same applies to survivors as well, who got dominated the whole game.  
---
You get cheated out of sacrifices because of perks.  
---
Or maybe you have hooked 8 people, with none dead. Wouldn't it be great to finally get a kill with noed?  
---
And again, remember you can't apply the same logic for domination between survivors and killers. It's 1 vs 4.  
---
The strength is split up into 4 pieces vs one piece.
---
...
---
Dude how could you use the only thing you can use as Myers?? You're obviously just supposed to stay in tier 1 and slug everyone. Rookie mistake.
---
Just run No Mither. I Always run it and always escape, it's sooo good! /s
---
If you think cleansing is good then you really do not play Dead By Daylight.
---
If you're in a chase with her while broken and she doesn't have Corrupt Purge you can loop her for longer than you would if you were fully healed and she had Corrupt Purge. Hiding in the high ranks is not a solution.
---
1 minute is around 10% of a game in the high ranks. This is why they're in the high ranks, they know what the fuck to do, they do it very fast, and to not cleanse against The Plague, it's very simple.
---
Thanatophobia is literally another maybe, 12/13 seconds on a generator, and that's it, you don't need to heal against The Plague so healing is irrelevant which cuts Thana's overall power.
---
Listen, don't say you do "Just fine" cleaning, if you are against a good Plague, it's not "Just Fine" maybe you'll face one one day and know what people are actually talking about.
---
It’s not but definitely feels like it. 20 minute waits for lobbies sometimes😒
---
Yeah... Because it used to be the worst killer perk in the game
---
Happy cake day!
---
My only issue with the grind is that prestiging characters isn't very rewarding. If you were to receive extra BP on prestiged characters, or if prestiged characters received Bloodweb discounts, it wouldn't be as bad, and players would have more incentive to prestige their favourite characters.  
---
There are players out there who ignore the prestige feature entirely, and that's not a good thing. While it is an entirely optional mechanic, there should still be an adequate incentive to partake in it. As it is right now, it simply isn't worth it, which means it has failed as a mechanic, and that is something that absolutely must be properly addressed.
---
Swimsuit Clown
---
She was letting you boop her snoot
---
It was a change they did a while back to counter  a glitch before if one of the chainsaw boys hit a pallet wall someone was vaulting it would sometimes treat the pallet like an immovable object.
---
Meaning instead of breaking the breaking the pallet or hitting the survivor it would cause you to do your chainsaw stun animation. So to stop this from happening they basically made it so if that would never occur you would just hit both the survivor and the pallet
---
That's a tricky one. Maybe the ability to trigger a short duration where he can climb over walls? Could be countered by a flashlight with a UV add on or something. Idk, just spitballing
---
It was a heroic way to die and I lived in the end so he didn't die in vain
---
Can we please get Stacy as a survivor and have like delta as the killer please bhvr give us gays something
---
Gotcha so it’s correct.
---
The glocktor
---
Replying to deleted comment:
---
*No, the community is bad. Almost all games I have I go up against rank 7-1 at rank 10 and most of the time they are all swf that genrushes, tbags, flashlight flicks, and all that. It is bad and it is SOOO toxic. Especially for killer mains. Killer isn't fun anymore due to SWF, because most SWF are toxic, flashlight clicking, tbagging before flashlight save, everything.EDIT: Also, you wanna say this guy was "Playfully" saying stuff? No, he wasn't.
---
how sad do you have to be to get mad at people t bagging and clicking lol. I hate how sensitive everyone is in this community.*
---
Lets break that down a sec...
---
Genrush?.. Lets leave that one out shall we. If you don't want them to do gens then patrol.
---
Flashlight flicks? If this is getting on your nerves then it is working. It doesn't do anything for them apart from distract you. which is a legit tactic and something they may need to do.
---
Teabagging? Again. Just fragile ego. All it does is waste their time. If you don't want to chase them, don;t chase them.
---
You have no points apart from you apparently are losing games to a lot of high ranked SWF players? Either get better at the game, or complain to the devs that they shouldn’t be able to flashlight click. ....Instead of claiming it is a terrible community for playing the game. Same goes for survivors.
---
&gt;Also, you wanna say this guy was "Playfully" saying stuff? No, he wasn't.
---
I didn't claim that. But I see this whinging so much about teabagging, from fragile killers who have clearly just been outplayed. I had to support this guy because it is laughable how sensitive this online DBD reddit bubble is sometimes. It brings a whole neww meaning to the term PC gaming. "Nobody should be allowed to offend me".- dude you are literally trying to PVP kill them.
---
Yes it sounds very hard at SWF rank 5 or whatever, but you can't blame players who are just having fun amongst themselves.
---
Are you American?
---
don’t you get rarer items tho?
---
Brutal kills.
---
&gt;because the free ride for survivors is over.
---
God your fucking pathetic. Why do you even play this game?
---
It does help them win though. If the killer gets more pissed off and obsessed with a certain survivor then it plays in your favour. Similarly sometimes you want to distract the killer.
---
What you should be saying is. If they do something that isn't helping them win: Don't be a little bitch about it.
---
Enduring.
---
The survivor main.
---
Even with the nerfs I feel Pig is underrated. Surveillance is one of the best perks in the game as it and discordance are the only ones that notify you that a survivor is on a gen (and tho I don't own legion it seems to me that surveillance comes in handy more frequently). 
---
Her best builds bring in perks from other killers (enduring, spirit fury, bamboozle, etc.) to help end chases but the crouch ability is so damn good for sneaking up on survivors on gens and even just cutting out the music so you can listen for injured survivors.
---
It's also pretty ineffective. You could be running away from the pallet and gaining distance instead just standing there for a few seconds to blind someone who can just hear where you're going anyways. There's a few situations where I can see it as an advantage, but you really shouldn't do it EVEY single time
---
Lol (you should get that game though it's pretty good)
---
He needs better map pressure or the ability to slow down survivors. Going off the movies, I think something that slows down survivors is what he needs. I don’t know how well it could be implemented, but I think if he had the ability to permanently close off a limited number of loops he’d more dangerous.
---
To expand: All windows and pallet loops start with a sliding metal shutter. Bubba has the option to close up to 5 at any given time during the match to permanently close off the loop. If he maxes out the 5 shutters the next one he closes undoes the last one. It takes 1.5 seconds to close a shutter.
---
Here’s where it gets tricky. I like the idea of survivors being able to open them, but perhaps only if they use sabotage and the normal timeframe to sabotage a trap or hook applies to them. Either that, or a survivor can open a shutter, (let’s say as long as it takes to open a chest) but I’m doing so a random shutter will close elsewhere. 
---
Bubba can open and close shutters at the same speed at his discretion.
---
Np I pretty much only play pig so feel free to ask anything
---
I love how you’re concerned by the three ruin perks
---
But bond is okay
---
This is art
---
Where is no mither?
---
&gt; My only issue with the grind is that prestiging characters isn't very rewarding
---
I dont know when the idea that prestiging should be heavily rewarded started. Friendly reminder that in CoD, the series that started this prestiging stuff, the only thing you got was a cooler badge.
---
And thank god the rarity increase per bloodweb isnt real, veteran players shouldnt get better addons/better items constantly (not like they already have 200 ebonies and 200 syringes hoarded in their inventory)
---
Discounts on items, extra BP.. yeah lets give veteran players a way to have purple addons and purple items every match, that would be very healthy for the game.
---
Depends which platform you're playing on. I've often read that on PC killer queues take a while and survivor is a lot faster, but on PS4 my killer queues are faster than survivor. It also depends on your rank and your region. If you're in Australia for example it might take longer to find matches than in Europe. 8 minutes is pretty long, I sometimes have to wait a few minutes as survivor but killer only takes about 30 seconds max usually. I think this has more to do with player count, region and ranks than the new lobby search.
---
When you own a Killer you wont get any more bloodwebs with splinters for that Killer.
---
In softcountered. You can counter it with Stridor
---
But what about sale + coupon?
---
It’s big brain time
---
We finally get the Freddy we deserve and everyone is saying he is too op now. Come on people
---
you have to buy the dlc. i still get the offerings
---
Ruin
---
Yea.
---
why did you disagree with me at first then? if you knew this
---
I dont think those stacks. Also coupon will probably run out before any sale.
---
It's still your choice if you allow that. You can do your job and play fair as well, lol.
---
Yeah It doesn’t make sense. But I guess I didn’t complete my objective because I’m using it🤷🏾‍♂️
---
And No Mither, manliest perk possible
---
This. Things were getting better but now it's back to shit show city.
---
Impossible.
---
Are you sure youre not a Hag in disguise?
---
If you think there’s nothing wrong with camping and tunneling, I’m sorry but you’re an asshole... done with this conversation
---
I agree but don’t be rude please as this is a civil argument :)
---
No Mither makes your grunts of pain 50% lower. Stridor makes grunts of pain 50% higher. They stack so at the end you will have normal volume.
---
Absolutely deny them their safe unhook if you can. The only way you'll find out if they have borrowed time is by smacking them upside the head. There's also nothing saying you can't just slug them and go for the rescuer. Usually, you'll be pulling three people off of gens by doing this, unless they have unbreakable/ decisive strike, and then you're just wasting precious time.
---
It's a good source of information updates while something like old surveillance would probably definitely work with high mobility Killers.
---
Because new surveillance simply indicates that someone is working on a previously kick gen it could pretty much work of anybody. Especially stealth killers as they could get to the gen undetected
---
Sometimes stating the truth or a fact is looked upon as rude.
---
All killers now have no power and have only 100% movespeed to make chases more fair
---
Um but why use that version of Crash as a profile pic.
---
It is.
---
the only rules are the one's the dev's make. As long as you're not cheating, you're good
---
Even BHVR knows Nea is a killer
---
Most other casual players have moved on to other games too so it's made it much more likely that you'll be matched against some doucher with a mouse.
---
The Lord decided to have mercy upon you, mortal. Now pray to the God of Universe, Gabenus Infinitus
---
I agree mate 100%
---
I did this in a cannibal match and was shocked lol. Poor bill. I let him live
---
It's probably an easter egg
---
I like response this
---
Its a joke...
---
 *play with your food* 😉
---
You can change name but it costs
---
I can never nail the loop around. Gg though!
---
Ain't that the fake blood one?
---
I mean, Thrilling Thremors is good too imo
---
For the worst man ever, your comment was pretty nice.
---
I would buy one. This is amazing
---
#REPOST
---
There are a lot of survivors on this subreddit who unironically say that.
---
thats not even close of what hes saying. i can die/lose and still have fun. i do my best to think about other people gamings experience when playing DbD, i play both roles so i know what  i wouldnt like done to me, thats the rule i follow.  sometimes you win sometimes you lose, its all good. after all, this isnt a competitive game by any means, you don't actually win a thing other than rank which literally means nothing, in fact, the higher you go the games are shitier and unfun (rank 1 every month). i escape/4k a lot of times, i die/everyone escapes a lot of times, thats part of the game. but i RARELY have a actual good fun time on red ranks. a fun game it's a win in my books :)
---
What an easy cop out for you.  
---
Just run away from an argument, because you don't share the same opinion.  
---
What a nice strawman.
---
the grind is sort of ok, but I spend 50% of the time waiting for lobbies(killer side).  Not the kind of grind I want or need
---
IVE BEEN INTO THIS PLACE BEFORE
---
never said anything about it. what sort of idiot likes sitting in queues for more than a minute
---
especially if it spawns inside a locker....
---
I dont  know why youre taking it so seriously lol but your point is dumb, none of those survivor perks give them a free win like NOED can
---
I hate you for that ever more
---
If your face camping to get one kill you already going to get a heavy reduction in devout points.
---
Even if you somehow manage to get a 4K by camping people on hook.
---
If you didn't get 8 hooks you won't get in there a distant and if you don't get a 4K you won't get a gold.
---
Im all ears is really good, can end chases almost immediately. Only buff of change it might need is timing.
---
That's more like it!
---
Friday 13th...
---
what if they added some kind of token system to small game?
---
I would assume it's a pride thing. Like a subtle way of saying "haha those damn hitboxes got me downed when I otherwise would have totally juked those hits haha" without explicitly attacking anyone directly.
---
I've disabled the ability for anyone but friends to send me messages, and no one can send me friend requests. Its certainly more enjoyable to play killer now.
---
gg ez gaim lmao
---
So if you know where killer is camping leave.
---
If you try to go back and save the person then end up giving the killer more kills that's your fault
---
Yeah I'm seeing that, some survivor mains seem really salty on this subreddit. I don't play often but my wife does, and the amount of messages she gets from salty survivors is amazing, and she mains survivor!
---
Update: it is 7 minutes of chasing lol not only is the daily glitched it’s also visually wrong
---
Hmmm OPs name is eleven, eleven is from stranger things, the coding thinks that eleven is a killer (gasp) that means stranger things is the next chapter!
---
thing is then its your teammates fault for not also helping with dull totems since you already cleansed 4
---
&gt;too many survivors escape the trial, because they get unhooked next to the gate with BT and DS.
---
And as a killer you can do absolutely nothing against it.
---
Certain kills get ripped out of your hands, "unrightfully".
---
This was my last reply to your argument.  
---
It happens all the time that survivors get a free win, when rescued from the hook during end game.
---
The only time I'm fine with face camping is if the exit gates are already powered and the killer has no other option
---
I always have a queue time longer than a minute for both killer and survivor....fuck me right
---
welcome to dbd dude
---
FacePalm
---
well fyi if you play against actually good survivors and camp, no one will come to the save and pop 3/4 gens while someone goes from 1st hook till death. camping doesn't work against optimal survivors. might work against less experienced survivors as they will try to be overly altruistic, heck even myself tell to my friends 'he's hard camping  just let me here and work those gens'. if the killer is prioritizing camping over gen pressure, he will pay for it against good survivors.
---
They said the same when he was released.
---
You know what happened right after that.
---
I know right.
---
I already own dbd but I'll gladly take that coupon since I'm trying to get my friend to play the game
---
In addition to what eqo22 said, if you're ever confused by one of this games ten billion acronyms, (if you're on desktop) the sidebar on the far right of the subreddit has a "Glossary of common terms" that has just about every one of them.
---
Hopefully they don't hurt him cause he is perfectly fine. People just need to learn how to play against him.
---
Shit shit u got me, gotta delete it now
---
Pig is the best of basic 'M1' killers.
---
*rrrrrRRRIIAAAA!*
---
That neck also makes her look absolutely terrifying
---
more like goodbye to dbd,  I had a good run with almost 3k hours though.  Lobbies killed me and still sitting on 200 ebony moris and 300+ irid heads on Huntress.   There they will rest bunny momma haha
---
Funny thing about it being a sense of pride (which I agree, that makes sense) is that it just reinforces how dumb the people who say it are. While the actual mechanics are wonky (did you know your hitbox is considered almost standing up when doing a gen?), the survivor hitbox is consistent on the killer side.
---
I'm on ps4, and only have had two matches with Freddy. One was on Yamoaka, where two people literally fed themselves to him and I ended up getting the hatch, and the other one I played him myself. I expected to be playing against so many Freddy's, but I guess nobody owns him because of his reputation
---
No tunnelling. No camping. If you hook someone, immediately exile yourself to the other side of the map, and if you see any survivors on the way nod at them accept their teabags. Moris are technically bugs and aren't allowed at all. You can use perks but only to inform you of where you SHOULD be: Discordance showing two people working on a gen? Good for them! Leave them be. When the Entity is gurgling in Whispers, run in the opposite direction until the gurgling stops. If survivors choose to DC that's their prerogative and you immediately have to farm with all remaining survivors. Hatches are for survivors - don't you dare touch it. No using powers except the Clown's bottles and maybe chainsaws but only if you're bad at them and aim for the trees instead of the survivors. Using basement hooks is unfair, the basement is too spoopy for survivors. If the last gen gets done you have to let survivors take the gate or the hatch because they've earned it. GG EZ baby killer.
---
ok lmao
---
He was my favorite out of all the ghost and he would be so bad ass to see running around! I would pay $30 for a killer like him!
---
MORE
---
I don't know what to be more upset about more the fact she got the trap off in the first box as a pig main it's always burns me up even if I had full intentions of letting the survivor live or the fact that she clearly doesn't know that she doesn't have to take off a reverse bear trap if it's placed on in endgame
---
Okay buddy to you, saying the goal is to do five gens. Can you stop doing anything after all five gens from here on out and tell me how often the game says you won?
---
Ive had a guy send 5 messages like that because he used a survivor pudding and got rekted by solo queued survivors haha some people just can't admit they messed up probably doesn't help the killer matchmaking usually takes a few minutes so they have to sit in their defeat waiting for their next match. I'm usually on a gen in my next match when I get messaged by the previous killer.
---
You realize they have been claiming to focus on game health for over a year now right? The lack of spring event is not for game health. It’s to focus on the next DLC and archives. We were supposed to have dedicated servers over a year ago, and they are still only on PTB and absolute garbage. There are extremely fucked up bugs from YEAR ONE still present that they won’t even acknowledge exists, let alone fix. Every single even tiny update release another swamp of game breaking and game ruining bugs, a lot of PS4 users can literally BARELY play the game at this point. The list goes on and on and on. The consistently over complicate literally every task they have and downright ignore the community unless it’s to shamelessly brag how great they have done so far, and literally have told people to stop playing their game and go play something else just. (From a marketing standpoint that is a fucking nightmare to see ANY company do. Literally who in their right mind tells people who stop using their product and go somewhere else?! How delusional and full of yourself do you have to be to think that’s not a HORRIBLE idea?)
---
The Devs are full of shit, and DO NOT CARE about the players. They have shown it time and time again how incapable, incompetent, lazy, and uncaring they are. I have literally never seen a game so riddled with issues that have gone unfixed and even I acknowledged. They are blinded by greed, Ive seen it happen so many times on several games. But this might actually be the worst.
---
This is the problem.
---
They said he was too strong and too weak even befote playing against/with him. Some people dont want to take their time to learn and play the game, or are so much entitled and think they deserve anything from the devs. Hopefully they'll not give attention to people like this.
---
 The comunity needs a rework above all else.
---
Not the hero we deserved.
---
I don't even use NOED, but when I see 4 people pop adrenaline at once then I get it
---
I play all killers pretty much some days I feel like pig some days I feels like spirit
---
welp, lets wait until the lawsuit is over, someday its gonna be over
---
I tend to get annoyed at those kind of survivors. That is why I run Bitter Murmur since the gens in this map are extremely close to other survivors.
---
Nice staw man bro
---
Every killer from tiers C-F, I think. Of course they're not on a Nurse level, but "don't even bother playing them in red ranks" is just laziness coupled with "4k every game" mantra
---
Logically, you shouldn't, because between DS and BT you're probably going to spend less time chasing the unhooker.
---
You have failed two attempts at escaping.
---
You didn't complete all the generators.
---
You didn't access Hatch ( which by the way opens no matter how many generators are completed so even if you do get completely steamrolled and don't complete one you can still get Hatch. Before endgame collapse if you didn't complete two generators no hatch for you until you did)
---
The last resort of an exit gate should be incredibly difficult considering you've failed twice you should not have a bonus chance on top of that.
---
dude sadly, but honestly, dead by daylight will be dead by the time the lawsuit is over.
---
At least it wasn't dead hard.
---
Yeah DH is actually broken right now. Sucks because Balanced Landing is still too, has been for months but no one believes me. Does basically the same thing and straight up won’t work sometimes but will exhaust you almost every time anyways. Sometimes it doesn’t even give you the passive bonus. 
---
So honestly, stick with Lithe for now. At least until that’s broken too. (Oh wait windows that teleport you back when you vault them! Crap!)
---
*Laughs in Claudetteface*
---
Hey if the survivors want to take a risk and only play with 3 perks and hope that Adrenaline will heal them and help them escape, I’m going to take a risk and only play with three perks as well and hope that NOED will Down them and help them die. 
---
It’s equality.

---
Tbh I don’t understand why people complain about all 3 of these perks. No ed is a waist of a perk slot most of the time as it only works during the endgame. Decisive does counter tunneling, but usually if you get unhooked bear the killer and the killer goes for the injured one, that’s not considered tunneling. Dead hard is really only useful once or not at all. Once you get more experience as killer, you can predict a dead hard before they even use it.
---
Yeah i honestly think they need to rework the traps because theres always that chance survivors get them off in the first box.
---
i mean, probably the lawsuit is over for next year, people are saying that the final resukts are next year...
---
Probably Hag. 
---
Hag is one of the strongest killers in the game yet you have people like TydeTyme rating Hag D tier.
---
Her traps grant her amazing map pressure and allow her to lock-down areas and cancel loops by simply placing traps down. 
---
She is also amazing at using the basement to her advantage as a trap forces survivors to crouch their way into unhooking which wastes time and provides Hag some reaction time to survivors being saved in the basement.
---
Uh... I'm guessing you're playing ranks 10 and up because extending the chase IS what you want to do. Escaping a very good killer is well, almost next to impossible most of the time since scratch marks, blood grunts etc. and just attempting it is not worth it with the risk reward it intakes, making extending the chase and looping THE RIGHT CHOICE if you want to be useful for your team. So if you find the way this game is most optimally played is something that means you have to tunnel for, you aren't going to have a good time unless you're playing with newbies.
---
LUL. half the time DS users throw themselves at the killer on purpose and other times they do a shitty job on  hiding or running
---
There was a recent parody with a "Survivors rulebook for killers" which points at the ridicolous rules lots of survivors make up for killers.  
---
After that I've seen some comments on the video aswell as this subreddit being like: "But killers do the same for suvivors!"  
---
No they don't.  
---
There are killers which are as toxic as survivors, not trying to argue, but that whole 'Rulebook-Meme' is a survivor thing.  
---
I've never seen a killer try to implement rules like: "You have to wait 3 minutes until you are allowed to cleanse ruin! Or else you're toxic! Fact!"  
---
It's a survivor only thing and \~survivors\~ people on this subreddit dont like to admit that.  
---
The original comment was a joke. But people responding to it and trying to make it a killer thing are probably not joking.
---
For sure. I do agree with that. It basically punishes stealth/1 hit killers too
---
you can counter WGLF... just hit the unhooked person before the safe hook rescue trigger
---
Could completely counter Sole Survivor by not killing any survivors.
---
Lmao the way he walks has me in stitches
---
Deliverance can be countered by being the first hook, or just not getting a safe rescue before you’re hooked.
---
Is it because you can’t get kills aside from basement camping? Or did you evolve to camping with a different character? I mean you act like an absolute buffoon so it’s pretty easy to assume you play like one. And sweetie, my feelings are perfectly fine. It’s your choice of words I have a problem with.
---
OMG he deleted hahahah
---
He said "STFU"
---
I do and I normally get camped for it while they escape. But it’s what I asked for so fuck it lmao
---
You can't derank from rank 15 unless you rage quit
---
I think nurse can be overpowered if you equip the right addons and have 1000s of hours playtime. So be it, they earned it. With spirit it's not that hard to get good with her if you have a couple 100 hours in the game I think you're good to go to rank 1 with her, any addon thats green or higher makes her power spam-able and prayer beads could make any rank 20 beat a rank 1 SWF. 
---
Besides all that she's boring to play against, very easy to camp with, very easy to tunnel with, she also has dozens of small little bonuses that other killers don't get that she does get, (occasional invisiblity, no vaulting animation, ridiculous lunge range because ridiculously fast killers also need ridiculously long lunges I guess?) she's too strong and helps babykillers destroy good survivors.
---
Now assuming I camp oh geez thanks very much. But even with his regular rev speed he would still be an excellent camper so why am I saying his rev speed should be 2 seconds faster?
---
Also you said he should keep his normal play style aka camping. 
---
Also I told another guy that not everyone plays him to camp or get his perks. 
---
Go figure you would say some absolute dumb shit to call me out as a camper. When someone else in this comment I disagreed that everyone plays him to camp. 
---
Oh honey please do yourself a favor and speak factually like me calling you a retard.
---
Billy is just happy he gets to run around with his new friends
---
the other day i depipped with 23k points and then double pipped with 24k on the same killer lmfao
---
It would be one thing if the blood webs were consistent. Like for certain character I just cannot seem to get certain perks or add ons. But for others (Ghostface is my best example) I’ll be getting stuff like BBQ, ebony Mori’s, and purple and red power add ons before he’s even level 10! I’ve been trying to get Lithe on my Nea for over a month now and I’m about to give up and just P3 her, but she has so many ads ons and point boosters at this point that I don’t want to waste them.
---
Okay sure, I'll just make sure to simply run around, and not use pallets or windows because they could constitute as equally dirty tricks.
---
After all, a killer might get tilted when you stun them. Or they might get tilted when they just miss you because you hopped through a window.
---
I don't teabag, I'm just saying that I also wouldn't get affected by survivors teabagging. Because in the end, them teabagging is just slowing them down since they aren't spending that time running.
---
That’s not even close to the same thing. They still have to do all the gens and open a gate to have that happen. A killer literally has to lose the game for NOED to activate
---
Its not black and white. The point is not to *prioritize* cleansing. Also focus gens first. If theres a pool off by itself with no objectives nearby, then sure you can cleanse. If the pool is right near an exit gate? Maybe hold off on that one.
---
The problem is survivors will cleanse, and then go run off and unhook a sick survivor, or hop on an infected gen and just immediately make themselves sick again. 
---
Its not 'Never Cleanse.' Just be smart about it.
---
This right here, beautiful, top performance, beatiful pro gamer move.
---
Ye you right, adrenaline rewards you even if you do fuck all while your teammates do every gen. Good play though!
---
yeah but you'r ejust an asshole
---
Almost all of your posts are about Jason if you make a discussion you only have 1 sentence in it you literally just spam this sub with either Jason Freddy being op or not  and random discussions
---
Honey I’m not gonna read the ranting of a fool like you. You lost me at “retard.” With your completely uncalled for rudeness. 
---
Maybe don’t be an absolute asshat right off that bat and you won’t get insulted back. 
---
Bye bye sweet pea. Enjoy yelling to no one because no one cares.
---
I made the mouth itself a bit thinner and made the chin a bit bigger for stability. + i added more black color to the mouth. I guess thats why it looks a bit bigger.
---
If your gonna make a discussion with one sentence clap your hands
---
get pig
---
Cunt* I prefer cunt, thank you.
---
Oh, but shes doing it every day and filming it. I don’t get these girls that just film themselves eating.
---
Did they just change it? Because that sounds like a bug.
---
Yeah, they are so fucking disgusting
---
HAM-BUR-GER
---
As a now FORMER Freddy Main (RIP Freddy 2019) I assure you he’s not. This is no different that Ghostface being Op at first. It partially has to do with the fact that the game itself is messed up. 
---
He’s very very inconsistent. Not OP. 
---
I miss my wall hacks Freddy. The mind games were so fun. :(
---
Who watches these 🤮
---
I refuse to believe you’re subtly complaining about Mikey. 😂
---
NOBODY has ever said that
---
Thats exactly the one. But i guess it was a cheap rip-off. The blood was leaking through the mask and the mask itself looked... Well. Not that good
---
You aren't on Twitter apparently
---
Someone told me the Huntress looks like she's in a different style, does anyone think the same?
---
Yelling wow I’m flattered again. Someone speaking factually is yelling, i though all caps was yelling? Hmm. 
---
Maybe don’t be a retard and I won’t say it next time. We all know truths and facts hurt. 
---
Fool? Hmm. Says the one that thinks Leatherface should play the camping way. The one that tries pinning me as a camper? 
---
Yeah I think evidence is stacked against you on this one sweetie.
---
I don't go through Twitter much actually your right lemme check
---
Found it on Amazon. And thanks for the link, ill never buy masks from Amazon again
---
I enjoy the variety of bouncing around many killers, but have some favorites that make up the core rotation.  I think there are things to be learned from all of them that help with other killers or as survivor and having at least a decent understanding of each of their intricacies is useful.  It's fun to try new things or play killers I'm not as good with/don't have ideal builds on and just experiment and learn without feeling pressured like I have to do well. Plus I generally do better the less invested I am in trying to win anyway, but really it's just about having fun.
---
I would probably recommend leveling them up for specific teachables in order of priority, idealy ending with the ones you intend to play the most.
---
I mean if you get facecamped immediately you aren't even able to play the game at all much less have fun.
---
Rushing gens and being immersed without getting chase points why u depip lol
---
Out of that list I would suggest either freddy or plague. Legion is controversial, their power comes with a lot of downsides to counteract the upsides like not being able to down a survivor in frenzy, not seeing scratch marks so you lose survivors if you break visual with them, getting stunned when coming out of frenzy. 
---
Plague is fun to play but good survivors can and will bully the hell out of her, those who know what they are doing will break line of sight with you as often as possible and loop you like crazy when you have vile because they know she is just an M1 killer without corrupt.
---
Freddy has good map pressure, an interesting ability, and can mind game the hell out of people with his dream traps.
---
Pig is generally considered one of if not the worst killers right now, right down there with leatherface, clown isn't much better. His ability kind of sucks compared to other killers.
---
Nothing weird about that. Sounds super useful.
---
Thanks. :)
---
I definitely hope you’re right. I don’t necessarily mind unwinnable DC, it’s still obnoxious but I get it. We keep getting early game DCs though and it makes the game so hard to enjoy especially for a new player.
---
I completely agree with all of the people getting downvoted: you shouldn’t have thrown down the pallet. They’re right, and you know that, that’s why you said it was a mistake and you normally look around with your camera. So why are they getting downvoted? And I would have been just as salty as Kate... wanna know why? How is she supposed to know that you didn’t try to screw her on purpose? I have seen so many trolls play this game just for that purpose so how was she supposed to know? She is as innocent as you. I think it’s great that you ended up getting the hatch but you’re just as bad as her for being glad she died in the end. I’ll take my downvotes with pride.
---
They may just think you’re killing them on purpose.
---
a woman of few words, but many wisdoms
---
Tom and Jerry chapter confirmed boys
---
Why would you use traps as a Hag?
---
No problem. Sorry for my lack of english though
---
Ya well not my fault if dude is afk while hooked and gets downed again right away.
---
Nurse, Spirit and Billy. 
---
Map pressure 
---
Nurse= Fuck rules (she’s harder to play on consoles) 
---
Spirit= Can mindgame loops 
---
Billy= Has instadown and Map pressure. But can be looped to hell.
---
Ngl ur a dick for insta saving
---
Make hag a png of a tree
---
I don’t see proof of that I’m just calling it how it looks from the view you gave me.
---
I wouldn’t consider myself a toxic player and I didn’t dc because I was with a friend and I don’t leave games even if I die first, I get how my skin would look like I do but I promise I don’t t-bag or flashlight spam.
---
Momma Meg like Daddy Dwight
---
Just going to block you so I never have to see any of your bullshit when clearly nothing from me gets through to your head
---
I completely agree
---
I just like having a lower rank to flex on my friends honestly 😂
---
Scratchmarks, Mori, Survivors
---
Outstanding! Can't wait for more
---
You kinda know the spiritmains/killermains are triggered when "salty survivor main" gets the most upvotes. Sorry that the truth hurts, you're probably not supposed to be at rank 1 if you got there using spirit.
---
A bunch of buffs to weak perks to bring them into use. 
---
Bug fixes and sync issues that causes strange latency issues. 
---
From what I am aware hitboxes are still strange but they are working on improving them. I think improvements have been made but I am not too sure. 
---
Devs are now experimenting with map changes to pallets to make more pallets but make them more unsafe. Bedlam now has multiple variations with more unsafe pallets.
---
Plague &amp; Ghostface are the new killers in the game. Plague being an anti-heal killer that gets stronger if survivors try to heal themselves. Ghostface being like an alternative Myers with stalking survivors individually and better stealth capabilies at the expense of more counterplay. 
---
2 New survivors added. Jane &amp; Ash (Evil Dead) were added.
---
Servers have been tested on PTB and they were horrible. More lag and funny glitches like Huntress hatchets causing double hits making survivors get insta-downed with normal hatchets. They are working on improving dedicated servers. 
---
Freddy rework came out and its actually really good. He has two variations of powers that can be changed by a common add-on. Works really well and seems decently strong. 
---
Legion rework came out to turn him into a basic M1 killer with a weaker Feral Frenzy. He is no longer exploitative. His add-ons took massive nerfs.
---
Yeah but none of them are as cute as Bubba so who's really winning?
---
Nurse and spirit* billy has way more counter play!
---
It was showcased in the PTB about a year ago to solve hatch standoffs, survivors didn't like how it was in the killer's favor as it was previously in theirs, so they complained and nothing was done about it. Then BHVR decided to rework the whole ending of the game and now it's perfectly fair whoever gets to the hatch first sets the end of the game.
---
yea, because waiting 60 seconds when the game is open is a 100% possible thing to do
---
Bowser understands
---
You just sound like someone that got destroyed by a spirit and trying to take it out on Reddit hoping another survivor mains will hype you up. Take the L dude it's not that deep
---
Wraith and Pig can easily hardcounter BT. Ghostface? kinda
---
Even Insidious hardcounters BT, but thats just memey
---
Also as someone else said, you can just ignore the unhooked person or wait 15 seconds. And if youre on the endgame and you dont play pig, wraith or GF, you can just hit the unhooker because theres enough time to hit him 2 times and get a fresh hook.
---
i play on SE ( an iphone 6s in terms of specs) and the performance is smooth as killer, but when i play survivor it goes off the deep end. whenever i’m in a chase i’ll get tiny freezes, and during skill checks my performance will dip.
---
Yep, got the same coupon today
---
thanks a lot stranger
---
Gotta go to the Doc for me.
---
No real reason, I just always have better luck with him.
---
Plus I think he's faster?
---
You just sound like someone that got destroyed by a spirit and trying to take it out on Reddit hoping other survivor mains will hype you up. Take the L dude it's not that deep
---
Literally every perk can be nullified by killing the survivor. You’re being downvoted because your logic is flawed.
---
Don't forget Ketchup Kate!
---
Yeah the doc is one of the worst killers.
---
freddy is great god dammit
---
*rrrr*OAHA
---
it’s always nice to get a good message after that though! my adrenaline levels surge whenever i get the “added to group” notification
---
I’ve seen plenty of inconsistencies. Ghostface’s only advantage is that he’s still broken. 
---
The snares are not always helpful. The pallets are the only helpful ones but only if people stay asleep. And even then it’s mostly just up to rng.
---
I feel the only thing they should remove from spirit is the collision against survivors, that shit is dumb af, rest is fine.
---
I don’t even need to click the link to know that sub is cursed
---
Rofl okay buddy if you say so.
---
Leatherface for BBQ &amp; Chilli
---
Hag for Hex Ruin
---
Spirit for Spirit Fury
---
Hillbilly for Enduring
---
thats a good build for m1 killers, if you're gonna main legion level nurse for tanatophobia
---
Cause it's a video game dude, why does any one have to prove anything to someone who cries on Reddit? 
---
On the real she's not the easiest killer to escape but she also isn't the hardest, just equip a ghost build and try to afford her I guess
---
No the rest isn't fine and this would not nerf her it would make her better in some aspects and worse in others.
---
it's a crutch for my lack of skill, I know REAL hags only use traps for the setting animation as a pseudo-teabag
---
He looks adorable af when he’s running around looking for people but can’t find anything
---
I’ve never been so conflicted on whether to upvote or downvote something in my life. On one hand, it’s fairly quality. On the other hand, it’s cursed as fuck.
---
Let me ask, what time machine are you using to make that work?
---
Lower rank games are also more fun, in my opinion. You can rely on your teammates playing good most of the time. And the killer usually doesn’t camp.
---
It's random, so you can't say it's always low chance.
---
It's like skill checks.
---
Sometimes I finish 2 gens before I find out the rest of the team is struggling with ruin, due to no SCs. Other times it's 1 every 2 seconds.
---
My Freddy got tons of pink add ons as I built him up, and my leather face only has chili add ons and brown spark plugs.
---
What do you mean?
---
I hate to see the day that people realized swf doesn't really do much. What will they blame then hacks?
---
tbh it looks more like the cannibal good job tho
---
The people that play this game on console and take the time to send post-game messages are so annoyingly stupid with their logic. I don’t even look at the messages anymore.
---
Ruin might of gotten a buff but getting Ruin to last longer then 30 seconds in a match is like finding a unicorn in the game. Anytime I've run Ruin its gone in under a minute. The totems aren't being hidden that well when the majority of the time they're right out in the open. Hell I've had games as a survivor where I've spawned right next to their totem. 
---
NOED isn't much better, as I've yet to get a game where it even triggers. Im at the point where if im playing killer i don't use perks that require totems, just because survivors blow through those instantly. You might think playing NOED rewards you for being bad at the game but the exact same can be said for BT and DS. All NOED is good for is to counter SWF gen rush teams, but even then you're lucky to get it to work. You can't point to a killer perk that survivors can take away from the killer during the game and claim it to be unfair, while defending survivor perks that can't be taken away by the killer, and offer the survivors get out of jail free cards over and over.
---
That actually would have potential
---
Could you explain the flair
---
Just got Bubba to level 35 and got BBQ, I've played 1 game with him and that was enough.
---
Closing 5 windows would make 1/4 of a map like Lery's an inescapable deathtrap.
---
Pretty! :D
---
Honour means nothing, huh?
---
Franklins does wonders my dear Hex
---
It’s less about counterplay and more about the power of the killer. With proper addons Billy takes a lot of counterplay and throws it in the trash.
---
And this is coming from experience, not salt. I take full cooldown or instasaw and it doesn’t matter how many windows or corners you’ve got, you’re going down quickly.
---
Tyde is just a joke
---
i bounce around LF, trapper and legion... if im against a swf ill use spirit
---
I don't care. You are just wasting your flashlight.
---
Sure he can down all 4 survivors in 1 chainsaw strike but that is rarely ever gonna happen unless they all in the basement. I don't even play a basement build like a "Normal" Bubba, I play Bubba like all normal M1 killers and actively go out and try to mind game them but sadly I'm a bit rusty as I've play too much survivor as of late (Red rank killer and survivor). I do play billy but I don't like playing Billy as I just don't like billy as much as other killers.  
---
Me and everyone else thinking he needs a buff isn't insane I'm pretty sure 95-100% of the community says that he is so weak that he needs buffs (a small rework can work too). speaking of buff on Bubba he did get a small buff which doesn't do much, all they did was made both successful and unsuccessful cooldowns the exact same recovery speed.  
---
Then again its your opinion on how you feel about him but why delete Bubba?
---
And kill people ^^
---
Some Killer told my friend its disrespectful to bodyblock at the hook
---
Because sometimes you end up making a great play, all 4 escape, and bubba leaves the game super salty lmao. Might get killed sometimes, but the risk is worth it when you pull it off
---
Bond probably made it so that he could see survivors
---
God of the basement
---
Given that hex perks are common anyways, AND it fucks with killers belongings, small game is never a waste
---
Yet I did. Sadly.
---
rrrrII
---
It isnt toxic but it gets hella annoying when they blind you at *every single pallet on the entire map*
---
I would say yeah that’s what it was but no they would die the second they hit struggle. Like they didn’t even attempt hitting space bar
---
They announced something over Twitter, and someone was like ‘your game is shit’, and they responded: ‘yet you are still here’. u/SlumberBalu is just chatting shit.
---
When you see a guy working on a gen in the open
---
Let’s put it this way. I’d much rather play Billy’s all day instead of spirit/nurse. You say “with proper add ons” that’s just it...spirit and nurse don’t need add ons lol.
---
Following you around doing salty things? You just said she was being toxic so I assumed it was harmless teabagging not that she was greatly affecting the game. Recently a Feng Min very obviously sandbagged me and I was pissed af so I wouldn’t save her or heal her. But I worked on the gens the whole time and everyone made it out. It’s stupid to punish the entire team instead of just the person who screwed you so I take back what I said about her being innocent. Still I don’t think all of those people should be downvoted for having very valid opinions.
---
Because it’s some persons fetish and she makes money off it
---
Insidious is one of the best meme perks this game has, leave it alone
---
Shirtless Myers = updoot every time
---
Agree, there are situations its the killers only/best play. But a minute into the game with 4 alive is just unnecessary lol
---
Had a face camping Bubba today, so a relevant meme.
---
Exhaustion perks go on the 4th perk slot and adrenaline should be the 3rd, prove Thyself 2nd and you got self care correct :D there’s a system to this
---
AUGYHGH
---
“You blow out the candles cut the I’ll cake”
---
The Spirit passively disappears and "phases" while walking around. You can't see that from your perspective while playing her, but it can confuse survivors because they can't see what you're doing during the phase. Here's a video comparison of how it looks like with and without add-ons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-HLfNwIg4Q
---
No the opposite. They are adding Bill, so if you haven't unlocked his perks, they will not be in bloodwebs until you level him up and get his teachables. But if you get the perks now, you'll keep them for the characters.
---
At the end of the day its just a video game.  I've never understood why people let it get them this mad.  I didn’t see any intentional hate from the guy, he was just seeing it as farming. Also if posting salt for staying inside the parameters of the chat and the other survivors are not threatening or using expletives or racism in any way, perhaps, maybe you should seek some professional help....because this game right here ain't it jack.
---
Do you even play DBD?
---
So what about us red ranks that face nurses?  We can still get gens done but rarely do we escape chase. 
---
Or what about getting sniped by a billy from across the map first thing in the game?   I should de-pip for being unlucky?
---
What if 4 gens are done and I’ve done 3, I escaped two chases, I haven’t been hooked and I’m the last survivor?  That’s de-pip gameplay by your standards.
---
This was in SWF
---
He’s just a gamer
---
As someone who mostly plays killer, I fully encourage you to do this every time. 
---
You waste battery, achieve absolutely nothing because I still have ears and it usually wears of before I can actually move again, and instead of getting away from me you stay next to the pallet.. You're really just helping me
---
OP? No. But 3 gen Freddy is nasty.
---
Anyone know if you can gift the discounts? I also have both games and would love to give someone the 60% off
---
They exist at the same coin. Adrenaline can do an absolute fuck ton of shit with what/when it heals including ignore exhaustion 
---
NOED is great for that pressure in endgame, and great for countering adrenaline and endgame builds.
---
 Neither should get touched as long as the other exists tbh
---
Unlocks the 3rd perk slot, so I can equip all three character perks to do the adept. Otherwise I would never get the achievement.
---
Yes, please do more killers if you have the time to spare! This is fantastic! You could probably make decent money from commissions with a style like that! Heck, I'd commission you if I could
---
Is he thicc?
---
My friend had the same glitch. Told us it looked like he was in a kyf lobby, on our end he was there and ready'd up. Obviously the match got cancelled bc he wasnt actually there
---
*Myers. *it's not that hard, folks*
---
Blinding is really useless if you don't have urban, of you are injured I'll find you faster since instead of running you just stood there, of you are not I'll patrol the area, I like blinding the same way I like tbaging, both just make the survivor waste their time
---
i would give my left testicle to see the end game chat
---
Freddy isn't the strongest B-tier Killer, Myers belongs in B-Tier, Legion isnt stonger than Myers, and so much more is wromg with this list. Ok you need explantions so we understand you reasoning?
---
Freddy's potentially A tier to me.
---
This is a whole new level of mindgaming!
---
thanks bro =)
---
As a killer main, I find it pretty easy to detect other killer mains. You're definitely a salty one. Keep defending camping and NOED.
---
I don't think reporting actually accomplishes anything on console.
---
My favorite thing is when I compliment them on being a coordinated SWF, but they deny being a SWF like 4/5 times even though I check their profiles before the game starts. Like, Yeah I guess I'm meant to believe you 4 are all friends with each other and JUST HAPPENED TO END UP IN THE SAME GAME. TAKE THE COMPLIMENT GOD DAMNIT!
---
&gt; Clown is definitely batter than both pig and legion.
---
I don't think a lot of people will agree with you that clown pips more easily than legion.
---
The spirit phases while she walks normally, disapearing and apearing without any cost
---
Heres a comparison video of juniper bonsai + dried cherry blossom
---
https://youtu.be/Y-HLfNwIg4Q
---
And the Katana Tsuba, increases the move speed and its duration when you stop using the power.
---
Ss the spirit moves around normal she has passive phasing where she goes invisible briefly as she moves.   
---
When the spirit uses her power she gets a slight speed boost as she reappears and has a brief animation. The add on changes those effects.
---
Where/when did they say that?
---
I really hope they work on him next, he's needed love for so long now. His chili add-ons don't even work! Not to mention, they literally were inspired by his franchise for the game, so how is he not at least "B" tier?
---
Lol, dunno man. I just thought “... reverse lightweight”
---
Maybe run Iron will and don't sprint everywhere? Easy as that.
---
Do you know when it drops? I was on  Xbox yesterday and the content had already rolled out but not for PS4
---
😂😂☠☠
---
yes bc that's why everyone t bags. Give me a break lol
---
Why cant we just leave the perks alone. Theyre fine as is. P.S. the only reason people want to update wake up is because of the exploit, the perk is made to combat remember me and thats it.
---
I had a Freddy who thought we were SWF because we "woke up too quickly". In a game where there were three people running bond.
---
No I don’t know. It may just be on Sony.
---
I mean....isnt that the point? Heck even if I'm super salty about losing against a scratched mirror Myers it's still a legitimate part of his kit and the killer is just doing what he's supposed to.
---
A killers most precious resource is time. The longer the trials last the more survivor resources (items and add ons, single use perks, pallets) will be exhausted.
---
Rank is generally but not necessarily associated with skill. If you are a good killer player you may not need more time to get your 4k but you have more pressure to perform at the top of your game and make as few mistakes as possible. If the survivors are as good as you or even better you might find yourself played for the majority of the match as generators pop one by one. 
---
It’s not necessary to run a game slowdown perk...but it does stack the game against you. If you in addition to not doing anything to slow gen progression run a good but not top tier killer like Plague, it stacks the deck even further against you. 
---
Do you need a gen stall? No. You can still get your 4K but it just becomes much harder and rarer.
---
I have friends exactly like this
---
I stopped playing with them
---
They literally can not comprehend a killer outplaying then and using their powers, add ons, and perks
---
yep. If this game would have voice chat or something like that this sub would cry so much, it's sad
---
Comment section here seems to be users from r/shitpostcrusaders and r/dankmemesfromsite19
---
*Dbd needs a special subredit dedicated for shitposts*
---
MTF stands for mobile taskforce, but I like your style
---
On the note of gladiator/ancient killers, I’d say it’d be difficult to pick as a lot could be considered “legal” killers as they were either forced to kill by a king/emporer/some other leader and such, and granted a lot of killers are from the past but the three that feel the oldest are Huntress, Plague, and Nurse while a lot of the others I could easily see being modern
---
Whats her power? Only played three matches against her and I dont own the dlc
---
It used to only last for 16 seconds on only up to 3 generators, whether or not they were still regressing. It's getting love because it got super buffed.
---
I had a nea DC on my because I body blocked her at a pallet.
---
**DID YOU THROW A FUCKING PEBBLE?**
---
Yeah but you know some Gladiators kill because that’s what they like doing. 
---
Or they where forced into the shit and adapted with it and started loving it. 
---
Kind of like some soldiers.
---
Buncha Cuties
---
Dont forget Spirit. That damn killer made me scream away my masculinity more than once
---
I feel you are looking to much into competitive games like League, 
---
The system you describe doesn't work simply due to the fact that this isn't a directly competitive game in it's mindset, it's an Assymetrical multiplayer game so you can't  resonably look it at with the mindset of a game like Siege, LoL or OW let's say.
---
Look at another once big Assymetrical, Evolve (one of my fave games ever it deserved a better life than one it got, but I digress) in Evolve the Monster got points and XP based on length of survival, how much damage they dealt, how many kills they got, how many things they ate, whether or not they destroyed the Power Plant, how early in the game did they win?
---
And ability related bonuses, etc
---
Hunters scored on: reviving teammates, tracking the monster and staying on it's ass, trapping the monster, damaging and killing the monster, protecting the power Plant, ability related bonuses and on how quickly they could end the match
---
The monsters goal is to survive/evolve/kill and or Destroy
---
Hunters goal is kill the monster
---
Those are fairly simple over arching goals
---
But there's a ton that go into that and by scoring based on those smaller things you allow a person the max opportunity to score based on playstyle
---
Is DBD system perfect no
---
But is it a good base yes
---
Imagine if say Siege didn't take your KDA at all into your rank and ElO or how close the match was in terms of rounds one,
---
The rank system would so out of wack
---
You'd get kids who had just a lucky streak or with friends who are super good yeeting them to diamond
---
But the game does account for all these minor personal based things
---
And if you did get carried up by friends if you solo queue you'll get slammed back where you do belong pretty quick
---
DBD needs tweaks and work but what your suggesting would just exacerbate and reintroduce issues that had already been allieviated such as Gen rushing
---
People still do it
---
But it isn't as often or as bad as before.
---
I see Shirtless Myers; I updoot. ❦
---
Yeah, "let's all rush the hook and get the rescue, he can't down all of us." ZZZZNNNG! "SQUEAL!" "ARGH!" "ARGH!" "ARGH!" "*sigh* Idiots."
---
Beautiful
---
This is most definitely a SWF. Notice how one of them runs around the corner trying to distract bubba while another goes for the save? They 100% knew he was there, and co-ordinated a save attempt. At least these 3 were definitely together
---
So you went from camping and NOED is bad to no ur bad oink oink, so you're in it to win and  no amount of fun is going to stop you. I'll be sure to go elsewhere for tips about having fun 
---
Because it's a lot of fun to watch the killer panic as the non facecamped survivors get away.
---
I don't know what you hope to do by winning arguments on the internet but it's going to make you more toxic than macho ma'am at Chernobyl.
---
So if you didn't catch on, you've won this conflict enjoy your pip or two.
---
I'll see you in the trials
---
Tbh I think DC should be heavily punishable and struggle should be automatic. In Identity V players can't even try to escape the chair, they just wait to be saved or for the timer to be depleted
---
no u
---
*Leatherface autism noises intensifies*
---
True I just feel trying to add a soldier killer (aside from like a medieval soldier) would be a bit controversial to some people as some people would obviously take it too seriously
---
Gosh darn it, you know thats against the rule #539 in the survivor rule book. You must always allow them to get your totems right ofd the bat
---
Oh I’m not saying add one I’m just giving you an example lol. 
---
I’m more interested in Medieval then soldiers with guns.
---
Thanks for the correction
---
immediately\*
---
Hey new player here. I just started dbd and i am at level 50 with my William Overbeck. I was wondering is it a good idea to lose my progress and prestige or do i keep him level 50? And if i do prestige, what are the benefits?
---
No its just pointless...
---
Got mine in the mail and it's fantastic!!!  :D. I can't thank you enough for the postcard art!!!! Your work continues to be amazing
---
They do. The Hag has an add-on that causes it. It just happens to be the only place we see it, I think
---
How I be lookin in minecraft 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
Honestly Meg is such a cutie though
---
Aww, that's so sweet of you to say that. I'm really glad you got it and that you like it. Please make sure to grab a postcard from my next giveaway! &lt;3

Nicely done! Just gotten Freddy and really enjoying him, console nurse main aiming for rank 1
---
Dead Hard ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
op what’s your location i just wanna talk
---
You'd make helluva good basement ASMR
---
Why did the survivors die?
---
isnt his name leatherface?
---
Alright, so which survivor should i level up next? I was think some1 like David King or Feng Min.
---
Meg sprint bursting away from the gen after fucking up a skill check
---
I can't argue with that logic, in fact i'm make a plunderer's meme
---
I was being sarcastic because I love Amanda lol. I agree, she really does get way too much shit. And yeah Hoffman was a pretty boring character imo, John and Amanda completely outshine him in terms of antagonists.
---
what is deafness
---
You dont want me to say what will make this better.
---
I find this... So satisfying. Like, you know how some people watch slime videos, or cake-slicing, and the videos are called things like "TEN MINUTES OF SATISFACTION"? Well, this should be one of them.
---
Please do Myers or Piggy!
---
If I'm not running spine chill, I ensure I have good line of sight and keep doing what I'm doing. Otherwise, I let Spine Chill decide.
---
Yikes who hurt you?
---
I dunno, have you seen a deranking Myers try to hide in a basement, then turn around and slowly stare at you while you accidentally fast vault into a locker, screaming?
---
I've seen some people criticizing emblems in other posts. What are some of the more in depth reasons that people think they are flawed?
---
Will do! :D. I just love how creative each one is!  This one being a Harlequin Romance Novel was especially awesome xD (do people nowadays even know about those? xD?)  You're very creative Rory, never let anyone say otherwise!
---
If that’s “delete the post” then you’re probably right.
---
Freddy Rework: Am I a joke to you?
---
I really liked them, especially this one and the one with the demon and the priest
---
No it wouldnt be that.
---
If you haven’t done Claudette, get her self care teachable (the orange one at level 40 I think, not just the one you get for free.) She’s pretty good in the stealth department due to her small size and dark clothing in tall grass. Self care is considered one of the strongest perks in the game and getting it on bloodwebs of your other characters is a good plan. Feng has lithe which is also one of the better perks so it’s up to you. David King is a cool survivor but none of his perks are exactly strong, Dead Hard is ran often but pretty awful honestly. Bill is a good survivor not only because borrowed time is an incredible perk but also because he’s badass and probably has one of the coolest prestige outfits in the game.
---
I should add this
---
But I thought death is not an escape!
---
Why does your bf sound like he's speaking through an intercom? lmao
---
But it has a watermark
---
I still can't believe a game about hunting down Survivors &amp; escaping from a Killer/supernatural being has a reference to a kid's cartoon right in the lore.
---
Megheads running everywhere and attracting the killer to an innocent gen repairer.
---
Yeah, that add-on also doubles amount of points you get for hitting people with chainsaw. Too bad survs get an ulta speed boost from being smacked, so they instantly become too far away for it to be any good except for memes.
---
To add onto this, they tested the dedicated servers again with the Freddy rework PTB, and they looked a lot better.
---
I had a Michael once bw nice n farm with us after someone DC'd/went AFK at the start...and the Michael toyed with us... Including watching us work on Gens and slowly creep,out from behind a tree, nod and crab walk back behind it xD. Does that count?
---
I play both sides.
---
I think I can deal with "toxicness" I dont follow the unwritten rules at all for both sides.
---
If the man be unhooking in front of me you better have Borrowed Time.
---
Most of the times I just slug the person that got a bad unhook so they dont die so fast because of one of their teammates.
---
If they get borrowed I just ignore them and go for the unhooker.
---
As survivor I flashlight all the time. It's a game mechanic. Just do it man.
---
I try not to T-Bag unless I want to die or want the killer attention.
---
Dont FLIPPING dc on me.

Ok then. I enjoy taking suggestions into account and I regularly do in my other posts so if you have a genuine idea then I’d like to hear it but if it’s something that overhauls the entire post to the point it’s nothing like the original then I probably won’t be able to use much of it.
---
L A aQA
---
What does M1 killer mean? Tru3 says that a lot but I don’t know what it means.
---
I think of Jeff's as the non toxic Claudette
---
Very cultured devs
---
Maybe give it a few addons; one applies Mangled, one applied exhaustion, maybe have a rare one that makes it into an instadown again.
---
i get bored playing the same one, although the new freddy has been pretty sweet overall.
---
lately i'm switching between nurse (actually trying to get good with her), freddy, michael, pig, ghostface, wraith.  i'll throw in clown or spirit occasionally as well.  
---
i really dont use bubba.  my hillbilly is still a lvl 1.  stopped using trapper a long time ago, plague is cool every so often same as doc.   dotn even own legion.
---
the asassins creed thing is because in the most recent videos the down survivors jumping from high heights xd
---
&gt; You swipe multiple times in one rampage.

last i looked it still only counted as 1 hit though. saw a youtuber awhile back that did a build that worked like this using that addon.

I wouldn't say gen rushing and deliberately not going into chases is the optimal playstyle imo but I didn't say throw urself into the killer, we all have different playstyles but I would say lasting long in chases is way better than playing immersive, points wise and time wise. I used to play immersive so I understand tho
---
“I am a asshole and think I’m better than everyone else,but don’t worry, I got downvoted to hell in the end”
---
Just say pre rework legion
---
I will do them eventually haha, first 6 of 18 are done so far
---
I got the same thing but with new Freddy
---
“You only got us because you have a teleport”
---
I’m sure the clown only gets you because he has bottles too
---
He can camp the living fuck tho
---
I'm fairly sure it dealt damage multiple times. I think I watched Scott in youtube do this.
---
The only other ideas I had for killers were supernatural like Vampire or werewolf

Bubba actually has an advantage over Billy when it comes to lockers. If Billy is using the chainsaw survivors can run into lockers, wait for the cancel/stun and run out, but if they do the same thing to Bubba, he can bump into the locker to start the tantrum which would still down them if they came out, or grab them if they don't.
---
Her salt was so unwarranted man, it's honestly not that serious. Imagine having absolutely no chill like this? I'd be a pretty miserable person.
---
well if you run ordinary and unhook someone you become the obsession
---
You can get double hits. If you hit them early in the rampage and stay on their ass you can hit them with one of the last swings.
---
The Freddy rework is just rehashing other killer abilities and traits that work and calling it a day. Oh he can teleport onto gens like nurse, slow survivors with traps likes hag or clown to cut off loops, he can make fake pallets like doctor, he can make survivors perform the wake up action "madness tier 3". Terror radius that mimics huntress where it's not directional. Need I go on? Behaviour made 1 good killer and to do it they had to literally give him all the tools of every other killer in the game. What a good job lmao.
---
A killer that has no insta down feature. Mouse Button 1 meaning the basic attack. Killers like Pig, Doc, Trapper, Wraith etc as compared to Billy, Leatherface, Tier 3 Myers etc
---
If you let it slide, it rewards a bad play with a good outcome, which is wrong. You think people that do that kind of stupid moves should be encouraged to do it more?
---
Tantrum is cool though, just shorten it.  I'd be happy with him moving faster when using his chainsaw, but making the actual chainsaw sprint duration not as long as it is currently.
---
Already loving his channel. Thanks for the info
---
That is way too kind! I appreciate it :)
---
I suspect you’d just have to specify that an obsession status cannot be transferred to them either.
---
M1 killer means that their power doesn't do anything to one shot survivors. So like, Wraith and Clown would be regular M1 killers because their powers don't instadown survivors, whereas Billy and Huntress aren't M1 killers because they have powers that can put survivors into the dying state quickly.
---
I remember that one game I played with my sister during Chinese New year. I was still a baby surv and wanted the Min outfit so she told me to get a lantern and stay at the exit gates while she tried to save a camped surv. It was impossible and she ran back to me. After that they insulted me as "fucking asshole" and we were like "she told me to do so. We are sisters" but they just continued that I was such a toxic person. Well I still escaped even though she unhooked me in front of the killer without borrowed time TWICE so whatever 😂 she got what she deserved
---
I was expecting them to run that way after the firs hit, but I did something a little nicer for my taste later ;)
---
" His name is Bubba Sawyer" do you think your mom is named mom?
---
Clown is a sad boi...
---
but that'd be unfair to the killer, who bets on the obsession switching hands
---
Well my friend is lvl 20~19 he can’t find games as fast as I do I am lvl 7 right now.
---
This does bring a smile to my face.
---
I couldn't hear you, could you repeat please?
---
On the New Freddy, if you use Insidious does his lullaby fade? Also with it would Freddy be invisible until he moves?
---
\*clap\* \*clap\*
---
We all know the new weakest killer.
---
He’s fun to face and fun to play.  I don’t see any other way it should be.  He’s not OP, but can still 4k.  You seem to want them to make another S tier killer every chapter, which isn’t good for the game.
---
I prob would have jumped in right away to save the key
---
Do you mind explaining why? Im interested to hear about it
---
This is amazing! Hats off to you friend
---
i just think it's pretty clear bubba is a nickname for leatherface
---
Removing her collision with survivors will open up a new can of worms however- imagine that I could phase through survivors and get to the pallet they’re running too and just let them come running into my arms. Collision being removed in my opinion will only add a whole host of new mindgames to her arsenal, especially for spirits who rely on the sound survivors make and not the collision as a whole.
---
Making Nurse an M1 killer, ironically.
---
I posted something days ago about the fact that add-on should be increased to a status effect
---
Your artwork is amazing but holy crap is the doctor disturbing!
---
Sure! I probably won’t be able to cover everything because there’s lots of small things that I can’t really put into words but for Daniel Barnes I just loved the irony of a blind man being a writer who ends up in the realm of the Entity along with the concept that to make it more “fair” for him he can sort of see without seeing. The concept of him being really determined and hopeful while not really seeing his affliction as a hindrance was something I liked which reflects in his perks and their quotes. For Daniel it was more the concept than the actual story. For the Shade though, I loved both. The idea of a scientist’s life’s work being ripped from him and turned on him that resulted in disaster seemed fun. Plus his journey towards becoming mentally broken and how that transformed into rage after becoming a monster felt like a good inclusion. My favorite part though is the fact I connected him with other characters in the world. I didn’t make it so his power has a Snap Out Of It action just for ease. The Shade is directly connected to the Doctor since he was the one who was torturing him for answers and the one that shattered his sanity. It’s why at the end of the backstory it states he felt like someone he recognized was in the realm and that he hated them along with the fact that the Entity *might* let him get his revenge. If it was a survivor it would be guaranteed but it says might instead. So, yeah, I just liked the thought of making the in-game universe a bit bigger and having characters have connections to each other.
---
No worries man &lt;3
---
There are a few cool ways they can change him to be a great killer.
---
A perk being unfair to the killer or vise versa is a pretty common argument, but that’s doesn’t mean new ideas like this shouldn’t be considered. For sake of argument, say this perk did become real and we had this furtive chase situation, furtive chase can continue to function even if the obsession can’t switch, while if the obsession was put on the survivor, it would be fully unfair to them as their perk is now useless.
---
I'm not sure how you guys managed to misspell Shirtless Myers twice, but it's fine, mistakes happen.
---
I don't run into toxicity often anymore. As a killer I've only been tbagged like once because they pallet stunned me but I ended up sacrificing them. When I started the game in 2017 I got hate mail almost every match now I don't get any hate whether I play survivor or killer.
---
Sleep by default is on a timer or when he hits you - you fall asleep. I think there are add-ons that add penalties to doing actions while sleeping but with rework, generally you don't have to prioritize waking up. The alarm clock does not give a notification (I believe) and you can still wake up by failing a healing skill check, gen skill check, or if an awake survivor m1's you. This method progressively gets longer with each time you do it, though. Hope that helps a bit.

Dead by Daylight
---
Ah, sorry about that then, I don’t think I saw the post.
---
Hmm, that could be interesting too
---
Thank you so much, that’s super helpful!
---
Wha-
---
I was making a YouTube video and I was completely thrown off by this haha, i didn't even know this was a thing until now
---
I just did the math (tell me if I did it poorly) but wouldn't it take nearly 120 hours to gain enough iridescent shards for a DLC character? 
---
I'm new, and I appreciate the chance to get dlc for free, but if that's real then this is worse than "a sense of pride and accomplishment"
---
Killers:kill by any means necessary even using glitches or exploits
---
Survivors: coordinate 
---
Killers: wait that’s illegal
---
There is.
---
Its called r/deadbydaylight
---
Sorry, I just thought some people might like it, it is DBD related though. I wasn't trying to promote my channel like that i just wanted to show a video i made about the game
---
Can we get a NSFW tag?
---
Wow. Someone down voted you for responding with a 'yes, I got that too'. Incredible lol. I'll put you back up to 1.
---
Totems are easy mode even on the game so I wonder why survivors have so much trouble with them
---
don’t worry dude, i can tell you had good intentions
---
How did the hatch open when there were still 2 people alive? I thought it had to be 1 person left alive for it to open.
---
Their both promoting each other, that was the joke
---
Overcharge Freddy is pretty good at slowing down the game
---
Gen Rushing= Survivors doing gens.
---
I liked this a lot, good job
---
David = running torwards you in a hook, get ready to be farmed.
---
Claudette = immersed/Ochido wanna be as usual
---
Nea = Old No0b3 wanna be
---
Dwight = Either baby dwight with default clothings or toxic
---
Meg = MegHead
---
Tapp = Will literally die for you. You can not see him not on a generator.
---
Bill = Always has borrowed time or unbreakable. Farmed you against Scratched mirror myers forgetting that BT only activates inside terror radius then DC'd
---
Jeff = Sweet heart
---
Quentin = Doesn't exist
---
Laurie = Used to be toxic cause of DS, now it's either a mix of Tapp and Jeff or toxic
---
Jane = Can be literally any of the above
---
Trapper = Either baby trapper or some god that will make you get out of a trap just to get stuck in another. Will DC if traps are getting disarmed
---
Wraith = Always using noed. Never has ruin because is still new to the game but has a bit of experience already.
---
Hillbilly = Either a baby hillbilly, or a tryhard hillbilly. No inbetween. Wll flame you in post-game chat or just say gg instantly. Will DC if the game is going bad.
---
Nurse = Either extremely bad, or a god. But that doesn't matter because everyone will DC in seconds.
---
Huntress = Don't really know a stereotype for her. Usually good at the game though
---
Doctor = Always gets looped for 5 gens
---
Hag = Will either trap like a god or be TydeTyme. Usually just a gg then leave in post game
---
Bubba = camping in the basement with noed and revving his chainsaw at the same time. DC's if game is going bad.
---
Myers = Decent at the game. 50/50 between having noed or not. Just leaves without saying a word in post game chat, maybe watching the survivors flame each other.
---
Freddy (old) = Will either tunnel a lot or pressure 4 survivors at once. No inbetween
---
Freddy (new) = No stereotype yet. If uses dream pallets = megHead
---
Pig = Will either tunnel you with a trap on your head, or play very nicely. May or may not say oink in post game chat.
---
Clown = Doesn't exist
---
Spirit = Faps to r/dbdgonewild

Legion (old) = toxic, with frank's mixtape and cold dirt. If using Susie, same as spirit.
---
Legion (new) = 0 kills. Varies a lot in toxicity/ If using Susie, same as spirit.
---
Plague = -1 kills. Will never get to use corrupt purge and will DC in the middle of the game because of boredom.
---
Ghostface = Will teabag you into oblivion.
---
The hatch spawns when there’s two people left and two generations left but it’s closed so I used my key to open it.
---
Going up survivors are there going down survivors were there 12 seconds ago.
---
I agree. If you want to be annoying, you get first smack.
---
Nope you're just an other lazy killer who wait untill the end obviously
---
Annoying sure, but survivors really need to do gens in a larger spread in that case, 3 gen is hard to deal with
---
I remember when the game first launched on PS4 we all had this bug for the first month. No escape unless the killer realised you were bugged and led you to the hatch.
---
See, i knew nothing about the going down and I’ve gotten up to rank 5 killer...lol thanks.
---
That’s fair, is it more if they whine too much about it? 
---
Because I do get annoyed sometimes about how fast the games go, but it’s mainly cause right now sometime the games are fast than killer queue times lol
---
Thanks for putting so much work into this I'll be sure to send the link to this sub after finishing them
---
The alarm doesn't give a notification.
---
The other commenter suggested Claudette due to her stealth and self care. I would recommend David. The main reason I recommend David is because of “We’re Gonna Live Forever”. It lets you get extra blood points at the end of the trial, which will help you level up more quickly. Also, David has Dead Hard, which is one of the best exhaustion perks. After David, I would recommend meg or jake. Meg has 3 teachable that are at least decent and one that is insanely good. Jake only has 1 good perk but it really shines: Iron Will. As a Bill player, you’ve noticed that Bill is extremely loud, especially when injured. Iron will makes it significantly harder for the killer to hear you, making stealth more viable
---
Like I mentioned you can role play all you want, it shouldn't dictate the balance of the game.
---
Technically the most effective way to pip in the current system is to all farm with each other and have all 5 cooperate at hooking/saving, hitting/healing, and running around with each other so everyone is guaranteed at least 1 pip, maybe even 2 depending on the rank and which side you're on. You won't see that too often though since people want to play the game.
---
like I said role play if you want, I understand what you're saying, that doesn't make it a smart thing to balance around though.
---
Fake pallets act nothing like the doctor. Teleport is only to gens so not same as nurse. Traps don’t work nearly the same as hags or clowns. Only one you have a point on is huntress lullaby but considering the lore it works for Freddy. Might as well be saying trapper is the same as hag because they both have traps or that billy is the same as bubba because they both have chainsaws.
---
&gt;bubba
---
&gt;op
---
C e a s e.
---
Everybody Gangster until Bubba puts them in the basement
---
15 minutes*
---
Explain how survivors at red ranks have above 75% survival rates then
---
Probaply because it is off topic and should be made in it's own thread instead
---
Matters what rank your in
---
This is incorrect. I've been told in postgame chat that I only caught people as Clown "because of bottle spam".
---
Who is the bubba killer?
---
That is most definitely not dbd. There’s not a mobile release for dbd
---
They don't.
---
I personally dont get the sexualization of Spirit. She's literally croaking screeching grudge girl. Her body parts are severed and rotting. What is the sexiness I'm missing?
---
True in red ranks its super long.
---
Oh, someone saw this? Sweet, it did get put back up!
---
This is just a part two to the other post I’ve got going where survivors are always angry about facing meta killers.
---
You mean you dislike the tenticles?
---
There is already counterplay to NOED... do the bones 😂. Or dont be a complete donut and get hit. If theyre still running NOED theyre probably baby/toddler killers anyway
---
This gave me the idea:
---
What if perk loadouts moved to the "Point Based System" (as seen in games like Call of Duty). So rather than 4 perks, you have 8 "points" where perks like NOED or adrenaline take 2 points and weaker ones only take 1 point.
---
It allows for more customization and balances out the shit ton of weaker perks by making then only cost half as much. It also gives devs more flexible, if there is a super strong perk that they feel like should still be a part of the game: make it cost double
---
YOU CAN DO THAT?!
---
JANARATOOOR
---
Yeah, it's Claudette players for me as well
---
*rimshot*
---
as a console player I wouldnt mind having nacho cheese pants
---
the yelling and screaming constantly..
---
She gets corrupt purge when fountains are reset.
---
Not as lower tier killers. The point of the rules is to make the game as easy as possible for survivors. The simplified version of the rulebook states: As the killer, load in and don't move for the duration of the match.
---
This isn't that bad, I like how you get rewarded points for each act of participation as an overall, I also feel as if once all generators are completed, they should allow survivors to feel encouraged to stay inside the map to obtain more blood points instead of fearing they will lose a big chunk if they get captured. That would benefit both parties.
---
Feng could be a really good looper and the Trapper could have decided to not even bother trying.
---
Yes you just need either the pink key or the purple key and you can go through the hatch.
---
He got delayed for some reason. PS4 still got like everything else, just not the L4D stuff.
---
&gt; I didn't receive any mail
---
I did.
---
Well... he IS making Baby Dwight’s..
---
When is dbd mobile coming to android?
---
Streamers who turn everything into a "balancing" discussion. It seems like most big streamers can't go 5 minutes without spewing nonsense about how *this perk is OP*, *If you use this you're not a good survivor/killer*, *You could fix [whatever] easily, just do this!* and other things of that sort.
---
God of the (face) Camp
---
His special power is being able to wear Claudette's face.
---
Bubba buffs and Pretty Lady cosmetics would be a dream come true.
---
They bring the gen with them
---
Hey go for it! Would love to see what you come with. For now I sort of want the Doc and Shade connections to be somewhat subtle so if people realize it then it’s something they can really enjoy but if more hints are needed then I may add something in there to help.
---
thanks i hate it
---
Lol. Good meme, did laugh.
---
I wish survivors would leave my totems alone. I've been trying to get Devour Hope to work for ages. Maybe if I unequip ruin they will be less vigilant...
---
He doesn't move his upper body at all lmao
---
Their are very rare just like lag switchers and their annoying
---
I actually started this whole thing because I was watching a streamer complain that they get stream sniped every single game, but they refuse to try to anything about it. Like they get stream sniped one game and they’re still whining 3 rounds later about it
---
It has been one of my favorite games for a long time now, even buying it on both PC and XBox. I would check out some gameplay videos (HybridPanda and Monto are pretty good).
---
Um actually yeah  I wondered what was under his hat, but looking at the in game model it's not hair it's mini gennys
---
**Jesus Christ, it’s Jason Bourne.**
---
That was... not a bright moment. Why would he do that? Why not actually wait for it to open up?  Bruh
---
I don't watch killers who run Ruin/NOED/Sloppy and other game-slowing or one-shot perks. Just not my thing.
---
Also, I don't watch people who play with "3rd party" music during trials.
---
Yeah, if you run ruin with it, they will look for the totem, and might get Devour Hope first thinking it's ruin. But anyway, in most maps, totems aren't really well hidden so even without ruin they will probably find it in a lot of games.
---
Snares are nasty, can’t wait for everyone to stop wasting their slots with dream pallets, snares are so much better
---
I’ve noticed that that’s gotten even worse the past couple weeks. They say “the game is the most balanced it’s ever been” and then proceed to complain for like 30 minutes about something lol
---
The devs are ready to spoil another upcoming release with the release of Bill yet..
---
Wow, this would have me so tilted if this happened
---
Leatherface
---
Glad someone could get a laugh in
---
yooo this is hella funny
---
These killers exist anyway and I don't think this happens that much... you'd have to be quite dull to take out revenge on somebody completely different. Or to make games as unfun as possible because somebody crouched at the exit gates.  
---
Also any strategy is legit. At the end of the day killers will use the most successful strat and so will survivors. A strat such as facecamping is worse for the killer.
---
Streamers that constantly talk about stream snipers endlessly. It gets to a point where the streamer isn't even enjoying the game or focusing on anything other than the snipers. Then they wonder why they are getting sniped when they are giving snipers all the attention they seek.
---
He wasn't always slow the entire game, that bitch could book it if he felt like it. 
---
But yeah, in-game he would probably be around 110% to fit the accuracy of the game.
---
I get mori'd 4/5 games... *sigh*
---
Who’s Bubba?
---
What are the “tiers”. I always hear people saying “when Michael hits tier 3” but I have no idea what they’re talking about
---
I disagree
---
I would argue about "map pressure". It's more like "camping capabilities". Her map pressure is comparable stronger version of 3 gen doctor. She needs time to setup and can't walk far away or she loses her ability to teleport. Best defending killer, for sure, but has hard counters that literally shut her down (aura reading, flashlights). Hex: Ruin is her signature for a reason this time around. Still think that she's right after top 3 killers, but it says more about other killers than about Hag. Well, maybe new Freddy is somewhere up there after rework.
---
Literally half of the damn video is a reaction clip lol.
---
I run Iron Maiden because it combos well with BBQ and Chili. But I also run it on my doc because the screams of survivors fuels my boner.
---
Doctor: Control electricity.
---
not nea 
---
pls god don’t do it
---
What about the locker dodgers what’s our counter
---
The devs released the statistics to the public, and they do. I think it's about 79%.
---
It's not impossible jut very difficult to escape Bubbas basement and I'll admit that I've died to basement Bubba a few times but thats mostly because either I got greedy with a loop near or at the shack and he came right back after an unhook while he was in a chase before that.  
---
You talking about old tinkerer or new one?  
---
Charge speed can stay the same because charge time addons exist but some of his other addons could get changes to make him a bit more different then Billy, his hitbox is fine Billys is the real problem because you can still get hit from stupid distances just because but i role with it. With the not be allowed you continue you mean not hit multiple people at once or something else?  
---
"He's too slow" I think he feels slow in everything (to me for some reason idk why) but has all normal killer speeds but i think some people want buffs to maybe his movement speed while holding his chainsaw at full charge. (If i'm not mistaken in the moves he runs normally while chasing someone in the movies)
---
Justice served.
---
Some of the best games I’ve had have been with randos I’ve never seen before. The fact that we can pull off great saves and be super synergized without voice chat is a great feeling.
---
Yep, heals are percentage based, so you've healed "2 and 0.99" survivors.
---
And now that Totems and Hex Totems are worth 1000/1500, people will go for them frequently. It was effectively a nerf for all Hexes and especially NoED.
---
‘Shaking my head my head’
---
*Local Clown main u/TigerKirby215 is gently weeping.*
---
I meant the get chased for 2 seconds
---
Congrats!!! \°/
---
Yeah I really like her concept and her theme is hilarious but I hate how easily survivors play around her. Had someone today tell me she was on par with Nurse/spirit. 
---
HAAAAAA.
---
They also explained why that value is faulty
---
Streamers who can't ever accept a loss.
---
"They only won because of (Tunneling, Ruin, NOED, DS, "stream sniping", literally *anything*)." Over and over again.
---
Biggest way to turn me off of a stream. I get that losing sucks, but c'mon man. You're not going to win every time. Constant excuses get annoying.
---
Link?
---
To be fair new Legion is a lot better to deal with than old legion, old legion would just gut you like a fish and leave you for dead while hunting down. Your friends 
---
At least with new legion if you know how to juke and use the environment you have a chance, while it's annoying it's just knowing your spacing and distance 
---
And if you do your best and the legion player is able to read through
---
That just means they're at least just as good as you no?
---
Legion is def a hard killer to deal with in a chase scenario but if even 1 person is running like a medic 
---
It's not nearly as bad
---
As a casual player, I say rotate between a small group of killers 2 to 3.  It keeps things fun even if everyone escapes.  I always go for Killer dailies  first
---
On Xbox (dunno about PC or PS4) there is an exploit so you can DC without losing items, bloodpoints or pips. It's becoming a real problem because that was the only real punishment to DCing.
---
very, very true!  i like how they say they arent going to talk about balancing, yet their whole stream they end up doing just that.  I think its kind of hard to avoid since most of their chat is doing it.
---
Pick any thread on the official forums talking about this and look for Peanits comment (community manager)
---
Myers' power (Evil Within) has 3 tiers: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shape#Power:_Evil_Within
---
Oh, it's a typo. Should be 2 minutes
---
You’re right, they faked it just for this reddit post
---
He just needs more reach. That's it. Make the yellow lunge/reach add on base and he's fine. 
---
The only issue is you have to be practically touching them to start the chainsaw
---
Pretty much... they’re even downvoting this conversation as we talk about it, lol. It’s just pretty sad, honestly
---
It's pretty close to how the dude ran in the original movie lol. Its creepy af in the movie, seeing this dude come at you like that, tryin to yeet you onto a hook
---
&gt;Uh... I'm guessing you're playing ranks 10 and up because extending the chase IS what you want to do.
---
I realize that. Doesn't really change my opinion that it's boring as the killer.
---
&gt;So if you find the way this game is most optimally played is something that means you have to tunnel for, you aren't going to have a good time unless you're playing with newbies.
---
I play around rank 8 cause I don't play often, but I have plenty of good time with mostly meme builds or blank builds. You defend criticism of one playstyle and then criticize another form of playstyle. People can play however they want. How you react to them playing a certain way is also up to the person. I don't know why this sub has such a hate boner over people playing how they want.
---
Please fix Freddie’s hitbox it’s at a broken state right now where I could get hit form a pretty dumb distance 
---
-concerned dbd player
---
But he’s running franklin’s demise
---
Wow that’s actually a really cool idea
---
I am literally pointing that you are wrong in trying to say that Freddy's pallets are just literally a guessing game. They aren't if you are playing smart.
---
You can download it right now through TapTap
---
Either a link or an actual explanation would be much appreciated.
---
Lmao kinda funny seeing her run that fast
---
How can they pull that off on console??
---
Some people do play spirt, nurse or Billy (I love spirit, not ready for nurse and Billy...I just don't like billy) and honestly people do want more strong and high tier killers then just those main 3 because either they are bored of them and want something new and fresh for red ranks. Yes this game has toxic survivors and toxic killers but some killers do need buffs.  
---
I do agree that not all killers are meant to be top tier but I think everyone would love for all not top tier killers to be around (If we were doing a tierlist) Low B-C tier but once more and more Killers come out there will porbably be a few low tier/worse killers then Bubba but we'll have to wait a good while.
---
Yes of they drop dream pallet it should work.
---
I’m sure it’s more of a meme than anything. I’m right there with ya
---
Going by that logic, Plague And legion arwbt M1 as they only need a single hit to down instead of two.
---
Isnt it the 6 sec speed perk
---
Survivors who survive in rank 2 rank up to rank 1 counting them as rank 1 and killers can easily derank on that rank making them rank 2. So the actual value according to the guy who I mentioned is closer to 45% survival iirc.
---
Looks pretty good! Im excited for the others :)

IDK. I like Hoffman for the little moments, like when he literally kills an entire police station with a knife and a cup of coffee.

Have you ever fell on your coxis?
---
Thank you
---
Balanced issues: yes
---
Bugs and hackers: no. While they do pop up, IMO it's less or otherwise no more than other online games.
---
The balances issues come from the fact that this game isn't meant to be some esports competitive game. It's not CS:GO. Low rank is going to favor the killer and high rank is going to favor the survivor. But the game is meant to have fun with not be super competitive
---
Devs said there won't be an event, but will there at least be a double BP event? I just started and could use the boost..
---
Love to hear it. That sounds like a reasonable grind.
---
It's utterly ridiculous that the points don't go up as you do more than one generator, but basically the way this game is set up right now you have to fix generator + clear totems + evade de killer + save someone + escape to have a shot at pipping up
---
i had someone fuck up healing skill checks then run just to draw killer to me.. in that case i just glue myself to that person all match to lead the killer to them
---
I just always run Spine Chill and not worry about this
---
I can't imagine why they would all be running Ruin then
---

In some kind of rush, if you will
---
i want dwight to deliver me pizza and tip him in kisses
---
Thank you I'm here for all eternity
---
Someone finally gets it. It's exactly the same thing as Freddy now. Never doing it is just stupid, but always doing it is stupid to.
---
Both sides of the argument are bad. Playing a whole game broken is just dumb no matter how good at looping you are.
---
Nah, I meant more mid-game disrespect, and then killer stops respecting whole group because of one dude, resorting to opportunistic tunneling and mass slugging to ensure victory over disrespectful group. But as you said, in the end half of the killers use mean strats just because winning for them is more fun than a process. Being pissed off post-game is more like when some killers remember disrespectful people and bring the sweatiest of what they got into the match, happens on streams all the time.
---
&gt;But blinding at a pallet/window is literally a better way to gain a distance and thus escape than just running away, because if disoriented killer walk in the wrong direction, they lose their advantage.
---
That's fine. At that point, I will go for the 3 hook and play like a normal killer. Are you asking me to go easy on everyone no matter what? Why can't I play memey vs some people and normal vs others?
---
I play super troll. Unless someone does that, then I play super optimally vs them. Whats wrong with reacting optimally to someone else playing optimally?
---
He actually got nerfed last patch lmao, chainsaw doesn't last 3 secs but 2 seconds now, lemme guess rank 20 asked for this? (I'm also the type of guy who gets scared af by Bubba, I would prefer Billy honestly, getting chased by him is so scary)
---
They haven't said. We can only hope so for now.
---
Why do killers get so much more BP than survivors? As killer I will consistently get 20+ whereas a survivor I float around 12k-15k.
---
The hatch spawns based on how many generators you have repaired and how many survivors alive.
---
If 4 surv alive = 5 gen repaired
---
3 surv = 4 gen repaired
---
2 surv = 3 gen
---
1 = anytime and it's opened
---
Could have been pulled out, looks like he was close enough to do it.
---
Killer instinct?
---
It doesn't matter how good a suvivior is, you will eventually lose at a loop. It's impossible to loop a killer forever, power or not.
---
They logic is stupid. Why don't you just loop a tier 3 Myers, Ghostface out of his Power? How is plague different.
---
Well shit
---
Oh! Okay, i forgot about that lol
---
🤮🤮🤮
---
That is some badass stalling that must have happened
---
You can’t get pulled out anymore
---
Yeah maybe I was a little harsh on Hoffman, he isn’t awful, and those moments were cool as shit lmao. I just feel like Amanda has a much more memorable personality
---
Tbh I think they should just re-work his add-ons. I think the worst part of Bubba's kit is the fact that he can't have things like insta-saw or anything like that, while Billy can. (And Billy gets mobility.)
---
I would agree with removing the tantrum, but I genuinely adore the ballerina twirls he does in anger, and I don't want those to leave.
---
Not really that much honestly lol
---
I didn't know you got both survivor and killer from directly buying DLC. That makes the price tags feel nicer. I'll probably end up grabbing Bubba's DLC eventually.
---
I mean I got downvoted for the same thing, your Resilience+Toolbox squad is going to pop all five generators in 79 seconds, and each only has to visit two generators. They're not going to spend any meaningful amount of time traveling around the map.
---
Even your M1-simulator randoms without toolboxes/perks do the same thing in under two minutes if they want to.
---
People act like running NOED when generators are done alarmingly fast even with Ruin when there's a multitude of safe pallets and most maps have easily abusable window/building/balanced landing loops is crazy.
---
It's just math, Adrenaline is incredibly easy to pop because the requirements for Adrenaline are incredibly easy to complete. It's not a Herculean task, it's something any team can do, all they have to do is avoid going down for 10 seconds per chase across 3 chases; they could still manage it.
---
Ah I see. Sorry. 
---
Yeah good point! But in a way that is what they want and probably what works best for survivors. Wind the killer up to full tilt on one guy, then he is most predictable, chasing the designated runners. Sure that may mean that you get picked on but that is still more predictable than otherwise. And in the event you are doing it for a distraction, then distraction successful?
---
Exactly. People are saying to just Gen rush and loop. Why won't people do that vs Myers or ghost? Why is plague so different from them?
---
Damn this is more funnier the 16th time I’ve watched this. (Survivor Main but I’m not a tbaggin looser)
---
Yea,it was made so it would discourage survivors to stay in the game when the exit gates are open
---
Yeah but wearing Meg’s face is better
---
I mean... if it at least showed you the aura of the totem. That audio cue doesn't feel too great lol
---
Probably just bad luck and you got matched with a bunch of asshats.
---
Am I gonna get wooooshed?
---
You can literally see her land on the other side right before the chainsaw hits the pallet and she still goes down.
---
A suvivior, no matter how good you are, can not loop a killer forever. It doesn't matter if your pro, numbers wise, Gameplay wise, the killer will in fact catch you. An extra hit will matter greatly at that point.
---
I suggested this exact idea before and it was massively down voted.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cb3id3/idea_for_balacing_of_perks/
---
when the community is massively against an idea, devs are unlikely to do it.
---
I'm crying because of your pink perks. I miss them so much.
---
Anecdotal evidence =/= concrete evidence.  
---
I have extensive data and a developer's word on my side, clearly stating it isn't worth it. You have spent a ton of BP on your favourite characters, and have unquestionably kept spending BP on them after unlocking every perk, while Ghostface has not been around for nearly enough time for you to do the very same thing with him, thus resulting in an obviously skewed line-up.  
---
Also, fun fact, these random bloodwebs are pre-determined. They won't show up in a certain order, but you will find two separate bloodwebs that are identical to one another, save only for which perks might show up in each one. If there are no more perks to unlock, they will be completely identical to one another. [This has also been proven, for the record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNy8dRaCdQ).  
---
But please, don't let all these ugly facts keep you from convincing yourself that everyone else is wrong, and especially don't keep it from convincing yourself that the facts themselves are wrong.
---
It's poor fucking game design.
---
What does it do?
---
bonk goes your item
---
Na he's actually one of my favorite to face. Going down to a legion is generally your own fault, its not like nurse when you cant avoid her.
---
I always give it to the last person.
---
I don't really expect everyone to have adrenaline, but when Meg doesn't have adrenaline I pause for a moment.
---
But it only works with that totem being the last one left, it basically helps only when 4 have been done.
---
i dont think anyone complains about billy, or spirit but nurse is a big meanie
---
Except Nurse. She keeps her 96.25% speed. 
---
Also, the number of killer perk slots will be reduced by 4 to balance out the sheer number of crutch perks killers abuse.
---
All lunge ranges will be reduced by 100%, making it so that you don't even attack or move when lunging.
---
Killers don't see auras of generators or hooks when playing the game.
---
The ability to destroy pallets is removed.
---
Killers wi- ya know what, lets save ourselves some time and just remove the killer's ability to move.
---
/s
---
ordinary is a great idea. but what would happen if all 4 survivors run it?
---
no because it was done on console, Obviously all the pro gamers play on the computer platform

Hell yea draw More!
---
Meh, as someone who got every killer to P3 I couldn't care less if they reduced the grind for newer players. Especially looking on the fact that Prestiging does little to nothing at all
---
he’s probably the worst killer in the game rn
---
His lunge is the same lengt as every other killer with the exception of tier 1 myers. It just looks wonky because he’s a smaller character.
---
Yeah, either the struggle effects need to be \*much\* more dramatic or it actually needs to do something to the wiggle progression. Maybe add a percentage to the bar if the Killer collides with an object/wall?
---
The 8-Meter increase in Generator Noises was also a much needed buff. If you use Headphones you can hear it being tinkered with easily.
---
I love using it on Spirit/Pig.
---
Not really. It shaved off barely anytime and getting all 4 or even 3 injured at the same time isn’t as easy unless you’re playing Legion or Plague. 
---
Back to its former buff it does a lot better and if it persists through death then it’s a better effect throughout the game. 
---
It would’ve seen play if they just kept the buff for it from back then. 
---
I just like it persists through death so it can be good and not useless when a person dies.
---
“stridor can’t exist with iron”
---
“noed can’t exist with adrenaline”
---
“distortion can’t exist with all aura perks”
---
perks counter other perks.
---
His name is gonna be every fucking word in the dictionary soon enough with all these fucking reboots and shit
---
This is how I counter NOED, I looked up YouTube Videos on how to Juke / Loop properly, then in game once all the generators have been completed, I executed what I had studied. Sometimes it doesn't work and that's OK, but I like to improve my game-play by hard work instead of telling the Devs to alter the coding and making the game work around what is more convenient for me.
---
Not that hit specifically but the actual thing of yes if you chainsaw *through* a pallet at the same time a survivor vaults it, it should result in a down.
---
I think we both know hitboxes on Chainsaws are fucked themselves, I'd never defend it when a survivor is on the other side, but the idea of the situation is fine.
---
deformed chainsaw man with a cool mask
---
Have been having the same issue on XBone
---
it would be op. ruin would become useless. essentially it would kill hex perks
---
I hate how much emblems for killers rely on survivors being good/playing fair. Dude kills himself on first hook or DCs because you downed him first? Go fuck yourself, good luck pipping now.
---
Even better is when I kill them Too Fast and end up depipping on a four man. 🙄
---
I actually love Ace's perks even though they're objectively not good. Random idea: make Open-Handed show your aura to survivors with conditional aura perks (e.g. Empathy, Aftercare) even if you don't meet the conditions. Could be a bit too strong, but would certainly be fun.
---
I actually can argue that because, for survivors, this is a team game. An individual survivor can do everything right and still die in the same way that an individual survivor can do nothing and live. So yeah, if a team plays well, they should be rewarded if they take adrenaline. That's the entire point of the perk.
---
make cleansing totems like 8 seconds instead
---
Third PS4 player chiming in to tell you, I never touch random psn parties. Fuck that noise.
---
I’ve got one if you’d like it
---
The killer has four players to interact with and the killer has an ability that contributes to their scoring directly where the survivors only have one thing to interact with aside from generators and totems. BP disparity has always been a somewhat issue because scoring is just weird. Most killers will always bring one or two addons that get burnt when the match plays though unless they also spend for the offering to keep it. Survivors on the other hand never need to bring items and if they live they get to keep it no matter how much it was used (aside from keys that open hatch without the addon for it) so in a normal game the killer is already spending anywhere between 6000-14000 BP where a survivor spends 0-17000 depending on the addon combo.
---
still too op imo
---
also, ordinary is a great idea, but what if everyone runs it? what would happen
---
That's the thing, surviving chases is all that matters, everything else is secondary being a survivor. A monkey can hold a button. Most dumbasses sit on corner gen thinking they are the smartest person alive, because killer didn't find them and their stealthy urban evasion, sprint burst, self care build play works, while everyone else is getting murdered, and they get one hooked, because they 3 gen'ed themselves, where is 2 people left, and another one left is p3 Claudette sitting in a corner waiting for him to die. If good players can't buy enough time, everyone dies.
---
I wouldn’t count on it but it may happen. There’s been no confirm or deny on anything for the summer but I wouldn’t hold my breath.
---
Wow interesting. I think ill give them a try just to see how they're able to beat red ranks whitout game slowing perks.
---
and t3 myers too
---
I did the legion! (Kind of proud of myself :)) [https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Legion-Wallpaper-807579207](https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Legion-Wallpaper-807579207)
---
im lvl 18 killer with a lvl5 clown. i just did a daily ritual, thanks anyway pal.
---
Get gonnorhea wet bag
---
there’s a daily for using TOTH?
---
But at the same time, what else were they suppose to do to level out how many bloodpoints survivors can get? Its super easy to max out with killers, but near impossible for survivors. (In standard games I mean).
---
I did the legion... :)  [https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Legion-Wallpaper-807579207](https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Legion-Wallpaper-807579207)
---
what do you mean lvl 18 killer?
---
i did once.
---
i had a kid scream after being facecamped for being a toxic little shit.
---
i'm never doing that again.
---
what??
---
Why else lol
---
Oh god, I thought the knife was something else for a second.
---
chasing someone with the clown for 180 seconds
---
Not optimised very well, but the core gameplay is the best thing you’ll find out there.
---
I don't know why people feel the need to be an asshole to their teammates. I always try to fully heal someone when I unhook them (if only for the points) and while I will occasionally teabag or look up at a Survivor on the hook I will unhook them regardless.
---
thinking of making phone versions of most of them
---
fair point
---
holy shit it's a zombie
---
balance=/=fun

Yeah Billy is definitely the worse of these 3.

No lol

"I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move."
---
Thank you. Freddy is really fun. Glad you're enjoying him. Good luck on rank 1.
---
took me 80 hours. take away the almost 15 hours of not playing and waiting in queue
---
If someone tosses a pallet in front of me, I’ll usually assume they’ll do it again unless they’re the ones to come and get me off the hook. (Basically “fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me”.) If they get hooked I’m not gonna play games like this Kate, I’ll just probably let someone else deal with you if they want to. I’ll still heal and play as a team though, I just won’t risk everything.
---
I haven't said anything about red ranks, though. Gameplay is what interests me, not results.
---
But Scorpionz is a red ranks regular, at least
---
My Rank as a Killer is Level 18? Want me to draw a picture?
---
That Nea head cosmetic on Patrick was a good touch. Well done my friend.
---
The other day a Feng body blocked a pallet from me when I was marked, and I got downed, hooked, only for her to go in front of the hook, teabag for about 15 seconds, unhook me, and waste her insta-heal. I literally don't know what's wrong with some of these players.
---
I’m aware, a better example would’ve been leatherface cosmetics
---
Red ranks tend to complain that the big three are the only killers used when the problem is they are the only competitively viable choices. It’s sad, but that’s what we’re stuck with and if any other killers got a buff people would flip their shit
---
Yea don’t get me wrong there’s toxicity on both sides but complaining about it isn’t gonna do anything.
---
5% of failed/successful attack is way to little. literally only a single token on BFL, maybe 20? with BFL stacked on it that would be insane
---
insidious’a only reason to exist is so bubba can face camp
---
That's fucking hilarious, lmfaooooooo
---
Hitmaizer already responded but I have something to say as well. First, the winning and losing aspect is I would say a part of the social contract. That is to say everyone goes into the game knowing that they will be competing and that they could lose, that shouldn’t be a surprise. Yes, some people dislike losing more than others but I think that if the game is deemed fair or close then most people don’t have much of a problem. What I was trying to refer to is stuff that isn’t (or shouldn’t be) expected in the game for example: intentional time wasting, BMing, griefing, teammate sabotage, etc. 
---
Second, This game to me is really weird with the winning mentality especially the killer side because it is hard to judge. Is a 4K only considered a win? What if the last person gets away? It seems like a lot of pressure to put on oneself to feel the need to 4K every time or feel like they lost.
---
Yeah I hate those dorks that can’t understand that accidents happen sometimes.
---
100%. I’d rather watch a streamer who’s able to say “I should have done X instead of Y” or at least admit that they didn’t play their best. Everyone has off games and nobody wins every single time.
---
I mean god forbid you to use Mike’s power like you’re supposed to am I right? What were you thinking???
---
and don’t you tell me you were also patrolling gens? you fucking disgust me you scum piece of shit. i hope you die
---
OMG 😂 SOO CRINGE RIGHT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Honestly shut up man. Somebody but time and effort into this and all you can say is CrInGe
---
Tysm
---
You're welcome
---
If you think that’s the only rule killers have for survivors I guess you’ve never been on the forums.
---
Can I post a lfg here? 
---
My previous group disbanded (conflicting work schedules etc.) 
---
I’ve had the game for awhile but only played it casually once or twice every few months or so. 
---
I’m not a total newbie but I’m not good but now I’d like to play regularly and get better.
---
Wraith is their own imagined character.
---
Yeah never really taken any graphic design classes, just found a style that works
---
Just because you unlocked the teachable doesn’t mean you get the perk. 
---
It just makes it reachable for every other killer you play if it comes up in their bloodweb.
---
I’m fully aware just survivors are much more vocal about it imo.
---
You're welcome and thank you
---
This is true in literally any game with ranked. I played a lot of Dota 2 and unranked and turbo were always way more toxic
---
Awesome thank you
---
actually funny
---
do we really need another killer that crouches, stalks, and has no red stain/ TR? like, the last killer was literally GF. (not counting freddy)
---
fuck bubba lame retard
---
buff pls
---
Ooh killers definitely have their own rulebook. Maybe it’s not as extensive, but it’s more than just “don’t
---
be toxic” lol.
---
isn’t it only visual bug?
---
Leatherface, has a chainsaw and makes screeching sounds
---
I only have 2 rules. Dont tunnel me, dont camp me.
---
r/shitamericanssay
---
you’re the only country that does this shit
---
I don't think the chase emblem correlates to those toxic group of people, they're gonna be toxic no matter how good they are in chases lol. And I agree, but I just don't like being a gen rusher cuz its not fun for me and when gens are rushed, there's no time to get chase or alturalism points
---
Only thing I would really consider gen rush a thing is 4x spare parts. 
---
That’s really about it. Otherwise it’s a term thrown around by people who can’t explain why they’re loosing.
---
There are no rules 🤡🤡🤡 do as you please
---
Every survivor also spawns on top of hatch with a purple key. If they leave through the hatch they get 500m blood points every game. Also I was gonna joke about the /s but holy shit people on reddit are so braindead that they don’t understand satire without it lmao.
---
if you don’t uncloak then you get a HEFTY stun just remember these are some quick ideas
---
Exactly!
---
Rank?
---
I just play with friends.
---
make him go faster than 115, it’s as simple as that. people say to rev faster etc. but i just think that a simple buff to his overall speed would be great
---
No don’t say gg wp give them tips on how to get gud :)
---
Yikes i cant imagen not having the sprint boost
---
Can't counter toolboxes and medkits without tunneling or running the "always OP" Overwhelming Presence to burn item charge.
---
Really?!?!?? i’ve never heard of someone that only plays kill your friends. no wonder. if you were to play normally you’d get bullied to shit.
---
Just picked it up there, heard good things but never really bothered with it. For this price tho it seems like an absolute steal.
---
I mean we are talking about a bat shit crazy family..
---
Well, in my scenario more or less the worst part if the killer sees you teabaging, and cuts chases after you short. He doesn't really take the bait, but also doesn't play a respectful killer anymore and remembers you in the next game depending on how offensive you happen to be to him. But when distraction works, it works.
---
it was a joke because he downs survivors jumping from high heights in two videos
---
same logic is “make survivors run at 70% they’re too quick”
---
No let her wear a fucking trash can 
---
That’s how you know I hate nea
---
Eh, let the haters hate.
---
I'm just gonna run around as mahboi the doctor.
---
Fun tip: if you and your friends ever wanna have a good laugh, open up a voice chat with them, play as the killer, and when you spot someone, play the Benny Hills theme song as you chase them down. XD
---
It's fun and the devs are still supporting it so if the gameplay looks interesting to you: then yes, it's worth it
---
I would say this is basically a guarantee that 1 of the next killer perks is going to affect basic attacks and/or obsessions in some way and they're messing with the code related to it which is causing stuff like this to happen, and why Pig got an apparent out of nowhere nerf.
---
ahahahah
---
Ironically camping and tunneling are the two leading causes of gen rushing in the game.  Those killers literally do it to themselves.
---
Ahh right thank you so much! I googled it before posting but I couldn’t make sense of it
---
Much. Thanks for the help :)
---
why won’t you play normally though?
---
and really, do you get blood points from kill your friends?
---
awesome!
---
xd
---
thanks bro
---
That's not really true. I sometimes "don't feel like trying" and purposely don't play very well with a weak killer... people do gens EVEN FASTER lol. I think they don't even pip since game last too short.
---
Not every killer needs to be meta
---
Don’t worry leave the toxic swf for me a spirit main &gt;:)
---
Those teach are huge.. he probably uses toothpaste recommended by 10/10 dentists
---
I can tell you right now that is not the case lmao
---
It's extremely true.  If you're camping your not playing the game period with the other 3 survivors.  I'd they have half a brain they'll plow through gens to punish you.  If you're tunneling again you're not playing the game with the other 3 survivors.  If they have half a brain they'll plow through gens.  Killers that camp and tunnel invite genrushing because they give competent survivors nothing else to do.
---
If the killer is winning fine then I doubt they'll be complaining about teabagging. Taunting is actually a risk in itself so yeah, punish those survivors... if its a distraction it worked, if they are just egging you on from the other side of an obstacle they are trying to get you to commit to something. 
---
It'll only be 'toxic' if say loads of skilled survivors are mocking a killer that is being outplayed. That's when people get upset and angry.
---
I don't care what perks you run. just don't t-bag whether at the gates or behind a pallet. especially if the killer is low tier. also are you really defending flashlight spam and infinite's???
---
I dunno.
---
I guess DBD doesn't really seem like the game I'd wanna play with total strangers. Seem more like a social game to me.
---
A camped survivor dies the fastest. So don't try to justify being a dick by calling it a "viable strategy." Camping is still more effective than teabagging pal, just a warning. 
---
It's still a video game at the end of the day. Trying to win is fine and all, but doing something that lessens the amount of fun others have isn't cool. It directly contradicts why people play games. 
---
So if you want to piss someone off, don't be surprised when that person takes it out on you. That's generally how it works buddy.
---
&gt; The Rancid Abbatoir loop. But here they actually have a point because it is kind of disgusting.
---
It is but tbh many of these issues are caused by the devs not fixing their damn game. This semi infinite has existed literally since game came out, so its hard to believe devs never heard of it. At this point i'd assume they think its good gameplay to use it lol.
---
&gt; But I see some people still complain about Borrowed Time and DS
---
I personally think both are perfectly fine since all they do is punish camping and tunneling.
---
&gt; plus they say that survivors loop them too much without realizing that they are making mistakes while chasing them.
---
Oh yea true. If you use your killer's powers well, you know some mind game tricks and you abuse unsafe pallets, you don't get looped for that long.
---
I think both are to much at once. Espesaly if you can down someone at top wraith speed
---
Hahahha too dope!!
---
If you’re playing without bloodpoints/perks, you’ve really just scratched the tip of the iceberg. you’ve literally seen nothing. queue up for a public match. i really can’t believe you’ve got 1 perk and no add ons, holy shit
---
It was an simple mistake, and you didn't do anything else tot hem, so fuck em.
---
Bubba needs to move faster while charging his sprint needs to go faster and last longer he needs faster charge time and most of all every time he hits someone with his chainsaw it should reset how long the chainsaw can go so let’s say he hits someone and someone would be out of range not anymore because his chainsaw now resets and he can close the distance
---
That's why you leave devour hope alone and combine haunted grounds with ruin
---
As a legion main, I just love that discordance gets weaker as the tier increases.
---
And wait, Nurse is Meta?
---
Dude I've NEVER been able to do anything with her. She was always so slow and her abilities sucked.
---
The remake changed his name to Thomas in the original it is Bubba https://texas-chainsaw-massacre.fandom.com/wiki/Jedidiah_Sawyer_(Leatherface)
---
yeah, she has a super high skill floor, i’m super shit at her too, but high skill players DESTROY. 4Ks every match
---
Ok fine you are right lol
---
Huh.
---
Guess she and I just don't click.
---
Now Billy I understand.
---
Lmaooooooooo get fucked kid 😂😂😂😂😂
---
she completely ignores loops and vaults
---
*Freddy has entered the chat.*
---
~~It's the same the other way around too.~~
---
I play Ps4 yet their are complaints on all platforms about it.
---
How often does the steam version go on sale? I got it the last summer sale and am trying to talk my friends into playing.
---
Not really, due to how quick she can finish chases. She'd be a M1 killer if she couldn't attack out of a blink.
---
&gt; He is still more than viable in low ranks where a majority of the playerbase is
---
Arguably every killer is "viable" even at red ranks as long as you aren't facing an SWF. Top killers win plenty of red ranks games with every killers, even perkless sometimes.
---
I just think its more fun to have them be balanced.
---
This is super true. Only Doctor (almost) is as good at camping as LF. He wants you dead, you dead
---
It’s stupid how they still haven’t fixed this yet survivors need something else to do this gen rush Meta is so fucking boring.
---
Sugar, spice and everything nice.
---
These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little loopers.

But Professor McCote accidentally added an extra ingredient to the concotion;

Did someone say Shirtless Kate?
---
Yeah but... 1000 BP is 1000 BP my guy...
---
that's not very nice
---
Woooooow awesome
---
She literally got one and a half nerfs.
---
Can people stop whining?
---
Dope asf!!!
---
Fine then tunneling isn’t a thing since gen rushing isnt.
---
That would explain why I see such a high dc rate on there now.
---
Can I link my accounts together? Like xbox?
---
We're not talking about the opportunities for one shot. We're talking about LF. That is just plain bad luck and a bad move, not the killer being overpowered.
---
My PC is a potato :(
---
Noed doesn't really reward you for not doing your job, just rewards you for the survivors not doing totems. If the totems get done, noed punishes the killer.
---
Wow, everything about what you said is so damn stupid.  
---
Btw, Hag's movement speed was never buffed.
---
Tysm :)
---
Not true about tunneling because it depends on how many people you've hooked. If you hooked everyone at least once then there's no reason to tunnel, however, you need to eliminate someone if gens are getting down quickly. Who you choose to tunnel depends whether or not the survivor is good or bad. Tunneling a good survivor will cause you to lose the game. Tunneling the weaker of the bunch will create pressure due to the lack of survivors, depending on how many gens remain. Those who are weak and are likely to be tunneled should stay clear from the killer's path while others try to get the killer's attention. Camping is a different story.
---
I've been playing survivor almost exclusively since Ash came out, running DS, Adrenaline, Dead Hard most games, surviving the vast majority of the time, abusing the most fucked up loops possible, and have gotten a total of 2 complaints in postgame. One was from a Wraith who had a guy wiggle off and escape because one of the 3 people bodyblocking the point blank hook had MoM, and he said that obviously he was salty, but not at us. The second was from a Clown who got (understandably, imo) salty and accused us of being SWF because I instahealed his almost-kill at the gate and we all escaped.
---
Meanwhile I can't count the amount of teammates I've had flaming killers in postgame chat. Most recent was a pair of guys calling a huntress toxic for camping an exit gate in EGC. Both of them escaped and they still BM'd.
---
The expectations on survivors and killers are not the slightest bit similar, in my experience. Maybe it's a yellow rank thing.
---
Im just asking how the community would change a killer for the better.
---

No):

You know how it deals to get bullied by a nea
---
Is a one shot multi hit weapon not enough for you guys?
---
I had a survivor flip out at me for minutes because I downed him with bloodlust...He said he fucking hates bloodlust!  And he's a God and killers suck and the only time he ever takes a down is bloodlust... I found the whole situation quite humorous.  The dude was a meme.
---
How old is this clip
---
So, every survivor build should be able to counter every killer build?  May as well just have 1 survivor and 1 killer in the game.
---
Fair enough
---
The main issue is how the game balance is completely different with SWF and no SWF. And every time someone suggest any sort of balancing of SWF, the whole community massively down vote the posts, which explains why devs can't do it.
---
Why are you so mad
---
uh, isn't that the guy you replied to?
---
Because I don’t like TOXIC neas
---
Right before end game collapse was released
---
Not OP but goddamn do survivors need to learn how to play against him.  The gens pop soooooooo slow.  If I run aura reading perks I can see them spending ridiculous amounts of time waking each other up.  I'm assuming it's potatoes that think his kit still has the aura reading or the 50% action speed debuff.  Just repair some damn gens people being asleep barely makes a difference.
---
Quite often. Basically every major sale, and on-and-off quite often. That being said with the Freddy rework I doubt we'll have another sale anytime soon.
---
You can find plenty of people selling the game on trading websites. Search the Steam Community Discussions or online trading forums to see if people are selling copies of the game there.  
---
Just... don't go to G2A.
---
Lmao at the top comment:
---
&gt;Good bye build i like running! Hello stale meta! Nope to this!
---
A point based system would literally do the opposite, it opens up so many fun and odd combos that you'd never see before. A "stale meta" would be like it is now where you're limited to 4 perks and only a handful are viable ..
---
just do bones
---
I believe the buff was cancelled explicitly because it resulted in situations where Legion would run it with Sloppy Butcher and Dying Light etc. and caused a feedback loop where healing would take too long, so nobody can effectively heal, which means everyone has to eat a 24% (1% less than Dying Light) penalty the whole match.
---
My fix would be to make it slow everything BUT healing. If it's fear of dying, survivors should not be penalized in healing speed, as healing basically prevents dying. I.E. survivors are so scared and anxious since everyone is beat up and bloody they can't focus on repairing, sabotage, etc. basically anything other than healing. 
---
And there you go, problem solved. No super mega long heals, while still doing it's job of encouraging healing (Healing isn't affected) and discouraging ignoring the wounded survivors. (Everything else is slow)
---
I dunno about it persisting after death. If it is changed so it does, dead survivors should have a reduced penalty for everyone else, otherwise it could snowball out of control where 2 survivors are dead and they have to deal with the penalty for the rest of the match with no actual counterplay other than "Don't die." It could get real nasty with Moris.
---
Have you even read my original comment you replied to?
---
Buckle Up was born because a big part of the players wanted to mechanic to see if it's safe to save someone or not. The obvious idea was to make Buckle Up a normal mechanic, but no, they wanted to create a shit perk just because they didn't have ideas.
---
Feng has fantastic set of perks for a beginner. They're not the strongest, but they do facilitate you learning some fundamentals. Alert shows you where the Killer is when they kick a gen or pallet, which teaches you map/situational awareness. Technician makes it more forgiving while you learn to hit great skill checks, which is really important in a world where Ruin is meta. And Lithe is a good little exhaustion perk that will give you some ground in a chase so you can practice running the Killer around. 
---
After that I would say the original three of Claudette, Meg, and Dwight are good to level.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/dbdLFG/
---
When people say “jungle gym” what are they referring to?
---
Generators can be flown by even if they aren't SWF is the problem. Literally all it takes is a toolbox and knowing to sit on a generator while someone is being chased.
---
Does ,,Im All Ears´´ Counter Quick and Quiet?
---
Maybe make the mask and shirt a bit dirtier and it'll make her blend in better with the others
---
“imagine hitting someone with noed and it not working” yes i read your comment i was talking about the fact that you woudnt be affected by hex’s
---
Question, what does the Dream Chaser score event mean on new Freddy?
---
Ace and Quentin suffer from the most useless perks, Huntress too.
---
Its not really a complaint against survivors its a complaint against game balance and mechanics. If I play a slow killer and 3 gens get completed in the first chase thats not the survivors fault they are just playing the game, thats the developers not properly pacing the game.  
---
Look at it this way, bloodlust, a mechanic in the game peaks after 45 seconds.  But if you chase a survivor for more than 20 seconds their team is going to make MASSIVE progress to opening the gate.
---
I'm not mad at survivors for making Ruin or other game slowing perks feel required, I'm not made at them for getting more than half the gens they need before I get 2 downs. I'm a little annoyed at the devs for not fixing the pacing of the game or giving survivors compelling side objectives.
---
I find it funny when they blind to early or dont hold it long enough for me to be able to see right as i finish breaking the pallet or when they hold it too long and i can easily hear them running in a direction and follow them
---
Yes. "This is not Happening" simply makes skill checks bigger while you're injured. Hex: Ruin makes it so that you lose progress if you don't hit a Great skill check.
---
With that being said TinH is not that great of a counter to Ruin imo. Along with the fact that you need to be injured the skill check size isn't *that* much bigger. If you want a perk to counter Ruin I'd suggest Detective Tapp's perk "Stakeout." Stakeout gives you tokens that will automatically turn good skill checks into greats. It's a great perk for stealthy players that rewards you for sneaking with faster generator and healing progress.
---
It does.
---
Sounds like a fair idea. I wouldnt mind this.
---
Especially if you just like... Have ears and can hear the direction they're running.
---
Yes/No.  If the use it to jump into a locker, the aura will be hidden, but if used for a vault, you will still be able to see the survivor.
---
Thanks! I was thinking of ways to make this perk more balanced. As of now OoO is just a way of SWF knowing where the killer is 24/7 which isn’t fun
---
Am I the only one that thinks Bubba is really hard to play against? I see a lot of comments talking about how he could really use some buffs and how he needs some loving. I get that he could use some buffs, it makes sense, but anytime I see Bubba in game I know I'm in for a bad time.
---
Usually it refers to the tile that has one window and two potential pallet spawn points.
---
I can't describe it, so here's the first image I could find on Google:  [https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/104/RIOYSHAL14X9.jpg](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/104/RIOYSHAL14X9.jpg)
---
In regards to Michael Myers: Michael's power "Evil Within" has 3 stages:
---
* Stage 1 has him move slower and not attack as far but gives him a very small Terror Radius.
---
* Stage 2 is a normal Killer with a smaller Terror Radius.
---
* Stage 3 has a normal Terror Radius, but he only needs to hit you once to put you in Dying state (knock you on the ground), and he also lunges further and vaults windows faster.
---
Michael progresses through the stages by stalking Survivors. Every time Michael progresses through the tiers the Halloween theme will play across the map. Tier 3 has a limited duration but Tier 2 is infinite, and he can't go back to Tier 1 after hitting Tier 2.
---
Nothing has been confirmed yet, but it is something that we'll consider.
---
This is why I run Ruin, PGTW, Surveillance and either Haunted Grounds or Thrilling Tremors on EVERYONE.
---
Then neither is tunnelling.
---
Nah
---
Indeed
---
someone’s a bit pissed
---
No, what you do is you run Haunted Grounds and Devour Hope with no Ruin.  They confirm among their SWF voice comms that there is no Ruin so don't cleanse any hex totems because they think it's just HG.  You get 3 stacks, hit someone and they see you have DH so they're like, alright, gotta cleanse that hex totem I saw.  67% chance they cleanse HG before DH.  Then the panic really sets in.
---
My favorite thing that happened when running that combo was when I had someone I had downed with 3 or 4 stacks on a hook and I was coming up on someone cleansing one of my 3 hex totems and they finished it right in front of me but it was HG.  They turned around, looked at me and DC'd.  It was hilarious.
---
now that is a dope shirt, you guys should check out [llamasfeas.com](https://llamasfeas.com), their shirts are pretty sick and they let u choose ur design color
---
Bruh, Dull totems give Lightbringer and 1000 BP now!
---
My first P3 killer lol. I also had so much fun collecting the faces. Cute Bubba
---
Take estrogen pills
---
Cleanse 5 totems, the Killer wasn't running NOED anyway.
---
Cleanse 4 totems, the Killer is definitely running NOED.
---
This is my solo queue life.
---
You gain popularity by streaming regularly, it's hard work, that's it.
---
Well there is a second issue which is Killer balance. The power level difference between nurse and Trapper is completely different. In order for Trapper to be competitive against a strong SWF team with toolboxes, u would literally need gen time to be like 80 -&gt; 130 or something. But a 130 time would be completely broken in matches where of Nurse vs solo team.
---
It's a fun game if you don't get too invested in it. It has a lot of technical issues but they're steadily being worked on and only really come up if you play this game for a very long time.
---
Dead by Daylight is one of those games that's fun in short bursts but can get really aggravating if played for a long time. The core loop is really fun but once you know how to exploit it the game becomes boring.
---
Also in regards to hackers: it's really not as bad as some people make it out to be. When you find it it's really noticeable but cheaters get banned very fast and are rather rare to meet.
---
These kind of "perfect" games for survivors rarely happens. Randoms are usually either scared to even touch a gen if it's a stealthy killer, or a cocky idiots who DC after they get downed 30 seconds into the match. 
---
I agree if the game was played only by Navy seal teams swf where would need to be a rework, now killers suffer from swf teams, but most of the time destroy randoms. So here is a question for you, how do you balance this mess?
---
Take advantage of it dying light is pretty fun
---
You also get Iridescent Shards for leveling up your player level
---
Oh man I can't wait. I just want to ask questions regarding the switch version. Will they have their own thread?
---
*We have the moral highground killers!*
---
\-Survivors 2019.
---
I mean i don't think that's always smart. For example, Legion clearly will do better with sloppy butcher than with Surveillance imo.
---
The only time I ever flashlight click is when I'm *asking* to be tunneled. Why would anyone do it and expect otherwise? That person is crazy.
---
Ah, the good old days.
---
I play killers who don’t have a lot of map pressure, don’t have the teachables for Hag nor Nurse nor Clown so I cannot slow the game down. I still win, no noed, no nothing, in fact even with Legion that only has Discordance most of the time I can get a 3-4k, you just have to play smart
---
This is incorrect. New Freddy's Lullaby works exactly like his Terror Radius according to the Wiki. Henceforth Insidious would remove his Terror Radius.
---
I do need to test this personally however.
---
lol Nurse has been considered the S tier queen of the killers for ages. She has a high learning curve but once you master blink chainning and then hitting as soon as you appear she is the best killer in the game by far. On most tier lists she is the only killer to be ranked above A tier.
---
That said baby nurses tend to be terrible and until you master her you will be lucky to get any hits or kills because her default movement speed is the slowest of all killers.
---
You’re welcome. Seeing cross map snipes with Huntress is always really satisfying. And also let’s me know that I will never be good at anything :’)
---
Saving this, going to make it my desktop background, what other killers have you done?
---
I think if someone offered a suggestion which was massively upvoted, the devs would definitely look at it and consider it. The issue is every time someone comes up with any sort of solution, it gets downvoted into oblivion. The issue is the community more than the devs imo.
---
That's just Sprint Burst tier 4
---
Did you get bullied ? );
---
2v8 mode when?
---
End game colapse. Once a gates open the survivors have 2 minutes to GTFO or die. The timer does slow if a survivor is dying or hooked tho
---
When I started ye
---
Ahh, thanks
---
The legion looks great but why are the threes in the background in 360p?
---
I'll try that and change it for the "release" version
---
thank you!
---
In a massive nutshell Emblems punish you if everyone other than you does poorly. Killer never found you? No Chaser emblem. Killer never hooked anyone? Well you can't unhook them for Altruism. Killer camped you? Why didn't you survive longer! Survivors all suicided on first hook? You didn't hook them enough for Devout!
---
For Killer there's also some other big issues (emblems penalize you for playing instadown Killers) but the main issue is that emblems aren't really decided by your own actions.
---
Yea low budget indie horror movies never take off.. oh wait
---
What rank are you?
---
yesterday i played a wraith game where quite honestly, i think i did very well on every single chase, wasting very little time. But the gens were done so fast i killed a single person lol
---
4 teammates running toolboxes with spare parts is for sure gen rushing, but besides that agreed that gen rushing isn’t really a problem. Without a swf team of toolboxes, majority of the killers can still win by out strategizing the survivors. I play both killer and survivor, and toolbox gen rushing is the same as mori’s to me. Its fucking annoying, but its an addon and you jus gotta work around it. I can see them changing the spare part rarity or some minor changes to work against the meta, but full on nerfing gen speed is overboard. Hurts the majority of games where this doesn’t happen just to stop a fraction of games from playing out that way
---
&gt;no stupid questions thread
---
Discordance is good for finding groups of survivors right off the bat (really nice on legion), but it gets worse as the game goes on (when people die and/or realize you have discordance). Surveillance is most useful towards the end.
---
Fuck you
---
Do you find yourself getting pulled off gens by Myers more?  I find myself getting more pulls on people since ghostface made everyone run spine chill and be too reliant on it.
---
To my understanding if you hit them while asleep it'll give you Dream Chaser.
---
I read that as “you only downed people in tier 3” okay and???
---
Apparently there was a killer behind them but obviously it wasn't close enough to warrant that unless youre throwing the person behind you under the bus. But they mentioned that after they jumped in the killer behind them closed it.
---
I would just like some decent add-ons.
---
Thanks for the input
---
I actually timed mine today for US and it took about 7 minutes for me. Not great but not the worst I guess. I'm farting around rank 10 unlocking perks but it wasn't peak hours either so.
---
Interesting post, what would you suggest as a counter to the Generator Speeds? 
---
Having played both sides, I honestly feel like the Generator Speeds are perfectly fine. This only ever happens when you're against Survivors who have great Teamwork/Communication skills which is how it should be. Working together **SHOULD** be rewarding and result in progression. You're going to get some matches that are out of your control, same goes for Survivor where you're going against an incredibly skilled Nurse or Spirit etc. It just happens. Skill/Teamwork = Progression
---
I'd try something like:
---
Balanced Landing, DS, OoO, Adrenaline, and as item use a med kit.
---
Not as far as I know, mangled only gets applied once, you only get a 20% reduction in healing, doesn't stack to 40% or more.
---
"Crouching in a bush for extending periods of time because the killer's heartbeat is nearby" was too long
---
All this time
---
I thought hindered was a crab
---
Better rework: Ban the perk if you are in a SWF.
---
Gotcha.
---
Okay, thank you!
---
More like fix his lunge animation, just feels so weird to get hit when it didnt look like it connected
---
High ranks late at night find games almost instantly, mid and lower ranks takes forever to get games.
---
If I manage to pallet stun a Ghostface, should I turn around and look at him to deactivate his Night Shroud or should I just book it and get distance?
---
Not sure exactly lol
---
Well that mistake is not the topic of this post. You're not even self aware enough to understand why it sounds like you're defending that Kates actions. 
---
And I don't care. If you don't want your comment replied to then delete it.
---
And an extra ton of toxic
---
Iron will and spine chill are contentious perks, I’m not here to argue whether individual perks are good or bad. Regardless of the strength of the perks the solution is never to run a specific perk
---
cross promotion. Some games do them sometimes.
---
Begin by putting .ttv in your nickname. Some players will come watch you, at least so they can see the replay of you vs them lol
---
Don't know, maybe on PC situation is better, on PS4 situation is horrible with randoms. I basically gave up playing solos, because it's nothing but rage. Killer doesn't even matter, most people are either immersed and do nothing or trolls. It's actually rare to get a good team. 
---
I would like to actually see my escape rate, I would be surprised if it was above 30%.
---
I’m just not a fan of exhaustion perks in general, not my style. Used Dead Hard for a while but never found it worth taking over other stuff with how unreliable it can be(killer lag, console framerate, me just sucking at it).
---
Always do that. If 3 disconnects I’ll give someone the hatch. 
---
Or if I feel like doing it I will. 
---
Or if someone plays good. 
---
Or I take pity on the last survivor because the game went by too quick.
---
Worthy of your grace?
---
You are a good man, thank you
---
yeah usually when one person does it all bets are off, i don't blame survivors for t-bagging at facecampers or killers for facecamping/tunneling tbaggers. 
---
as they say: play dumb games, get dumb prizes
---
Just hook survivors... And don't camp them and go to another one..
---
Wtf dude you’re supposed to stay in tier 1 what’s wrong with you?? 😂
---
Yes some people don’t use it because they run other detection perks or they’re just good at finding survivors.
---
Agreed, this is on both sides.
---
true but the only perk in the game that can trigger off a dull totem is NOED isn't it?
---
Good meme but spirit hasnt even been out for 1 year
---
I'd like an arcade as part of a mall. Not trying to diminish your idea OP, just thinking about arcades reminds me of hanging out at the one in the mall in my town
---
Yet all I get are 3k and 4k's with him. Solid killer if you know how to play him, but seems most people are just potatoes when it comes to Bubba.
---
Idk man, you probably want to dumb it down a bit because adding that as a killer would be like a 2nd game mode
---
Did he have noed and blood warden? Maybe he did forget insidious and was hoping for some end game cheese and didn't want to spoil the surprise by hitting you.
---
Detection perks being?
---
Can you make an edit without bitch? I love this but I'm not lookin to dance with the chance of getting psn banned
---
I honestly don’t mind that ranked is the only option for dbd but the rank system is straight trash, it basically is causal.

Yah

It’ll still come up in the bloodweb again. I’ve skipped them before and they showed up so it’s not lost forever

---
Spirit is genuinely the second best killer who only requires a pair of ears to play, and is one of the most frustrating killers to play against. Once your injured against her, without iron will you have pretty much already lost the chase.
---
Yea, this post is pretty salty and poorly structured, but you can't deny how powerful and easy spirit is, and how annoying it is to play against a killer where your input pretty much doesn't matter most of the time.
---
Lol 🤣🤣🤣
---
Lol toxic. Lol no one escapes death lol. Everyone escapes lol.
---
The other day I tried to play according to my own survivor rules, that is, not doing things that I hate to see in a killer when I play survivor (I used to be a main killer but I've been more of a survivor lately).
---
Basically, I have to play like a dumbass: not staying near a survivor in a hook even when you suspect/know someone is close, heading to the furthest generator when you hook someone... surprise, this way most of the survivors scape.
---
Worst experience ever, I'll go back to be a little toxic
---
It’s out in beta I think, only available in select European countries.
---
I don't know if it's a TERRIBLE idea, but I definitely think I'd rather see the time taken on a project like this used in other ways.
---
Bing bong's movie: After the junkyard incident, bing bong attempts to kill the mob bosses as revenge but its a shame that the criminals are a rank 1 swf group. so just like in the game, wraith kills literally none of them and all of the criminals escape.
---
It would’ve been better if it was micheal
---
You cant get banned for swearing, only racial and degrading words. People have tried to report me before and it didnt work. But yeah i can do it again for you
---
Interesting. You should do it. For science.
---
I bubba main, and you can 100% get more than one hit on the same person with that addon. It's not easy, but it is doable.
---
Foreshadowing Demolisher killer of course! (jk, in case anyone actually believes)
---
A harran map could be slick.
---
They really did turn the game into a single-objective game. Rummaging for items, sabotaging hooks that regenerate, dull totems, all of this could be incorporated into the primary objective but it's just a distraction now. 
---
My idea: generators requiring parts to complete to disable an initial "hex-ruin" effect on them- you can get a part from chests, totems, and sabo'd hooks.
---
***Shirtless Myers theme intensifies***
---
If you stun Ghost Face while he has Night Shroud active, it will be cancelled automatically. You don't need to stare at him.
---
Ya it makes no sense. I dont think all the killer medals are atrocious, they definitely need some fixing though. The survivor ones are really fucking stupid though and dont reflect skill level whatsoever.
---
When does the next double blood points event come?
---
All he had was uhh... unnerving presence.
---
Actually that violates rule 174 in the survivor rule book for killers it states “if bloodlust activates the killer must leave chase until it deactivates” it common knowledge lmao
---
and now read the post and think what I meant by that
---
I did, what you're not getting is the argument of cleaning vs not cleansing, you will last longer in a chase if you're broken and The Plague is forced to M1 compared to being healthy (Fully healed, seems I need to explain everything to you) and her using Corrupt Purge. THIS is what the conversation is about, this is all that fucking mattered, you will last longer in a chase when broken compared to when she has Corrupt Purge from cleansing.
---
If you last longer when she has Corrupt Purge, that has nothing to do with you as a player, more so her. You will not last as long when she has Corrupt Purge, plain and simple. How you are missing this basic shit is beyond me, but them again, I'm on reddit.
---
if you had this perk it would be broken because hex’s woudnt affect you. ruin is a hex. it woudnt a ffect you. it would make hex perks useless. holy shit how do you not get it
---
You know a arcade map would make me want a like digital killer. I dont know what exactly could even be a digital or technology killer but it seems interesting
---
Good lord Haddonfield with 3 Balanced Landings and 3 syringes.  Although at least with trapper you can shut down Myers house and another spot assuming you get enough time to collect all your traps.
---
But even then every other house becomes a nightmare to chase through. I'm hoping the eventually give the Haddonfield houses the Badham treatment with gaps in railings and holes in the upper floor.
---
who leaked my porn fetish?
---
It’s a sprint burst or exhaustion perk bug. Currently they have a slim chance (boosted chance of laggy) to give haste forever. And once it activates, their only choices are sit still and let you kill them, or... run.
---
Also, there is no distinct way to trigger it, it just happens, so it’s unpleasant for both sides. One gets destroyed by an invincible survivor, the other gets reported into oblivion and everyone now thinks they’re a piece of crap
---
I believe that when you pallet stun a Ghostface, he loses his Night Shroud automatically.
---
Mangled actually doubles the healing time of survivors. Against someone using Self-care, it adds a whole... 32 seconds to the progress. You way misread how good Sloppy Butcher is.
---
And to further clarify, it doubles *all* healing. If you are mangled, teammates heal you half as fast. Medkits heal you half as fast. If you're slugged, teammates pick you up half as fast.
---
If you're slugged and *you* are healing yourself, the speed isn't affected, because you're "recovering", not healing. Same with mending.
---
Nerfing legion???????? What planet are you from in which he is good lol. He needs buffs if anything
---
You’re taking the game into a way too ideal universe.
---
Y e s
---
Hag or Spirit would be pretty cool
---
Amazing artwork!
---
It wouldn’t be animated. I’m talking live action indie films, like the original Halloween and TCM. Also idk what most of what you said means

You also put words in the developers mouth, because he did not say there was no difference between P3 and P0 for any rarity. He just said it was too low, and I made sure to point that out.
---
Besides, I can always bombard you with screenshots and data from my account... But you would just be a child about it and tell me Mclean said something else that he didn't, to support your claims.
---
I don't go around making shit up, you absolutely did, and it's online for everyone to see. I just gave my 2 cents, and all you can do is tell me it's invalid.
---
LOL, I'm still not as full of shit as you.
---
*Houston, I believe he's trying to communicate*
---
Yeah LOL
---
when a SWF groups together around you to troll around isn't that usually a free win? What are you complaining about? THEY DIDN'T GEN RUSH IM SO MAD.
---
Depends on the delay. It would remove some mindgames, but only the ones that make her so unfun to play against. It would also add some new ones if her delay was long enough
---
Your average best friends
---
Oh! And the Huntress!
---
She and Doc ate actually tied up as my two mains!
---
Man, I can't believe I forgot about the huntress! Her ax-throwing ability is OP as fuck!
---
I don't understand why people rate him so low. I am a killer main with multiple P3's, and Bubba is easily my favourite to play. He starts slow and ends strong. Once the pallets are gone, there is no escaping him.
---
You keep saying toxic but I'm not sure you know what it means. I don't think you'll see me in-game because I'm red ranks on killer/survivor. Judging by your post about getting 360'd constantly, I don't think you're very close nor will be.
---
The solution isn’t to run a perk to counter it, since we only have 4 slots. The solution is to not create killers that require specific perks to have real counterplay
---
So since you said Houston I assume that i’m on Apollo 13 meaning i’m the shit and i’m qualified for interstellar expeditions and you’re still a BEETCH at home.
---
LOVE IT!!!!!!
---
Because the other 13 killers get massive BM because of chase flow control?
---
Lol we should get that blue virus guy from scooby doo.
---
he is better than wraith with insta saw add ons.
---
no add ons he is pretty bad
---
That little "no" shake as he blocked like he knew hed get you
---
It's funny because I play on console, and almost every nurse I play against is a potato.  Every time I hear her scream at the start of the game I think, "Cool, easy win!"
---
Good legions are never more than mid-tier, so good luck with that argument. Freddy’s pallets are, once again, too new to be discussing their balance. Spirits invisibility is the point of this post. Nurse has a similar issue, but that isn’t the point of this post. It doesn’t matter if there’s multiple killers that could use some rebalancing, this post is for discussing SPIRIT. All the points you are bringing up are pointless, since they aren’t a discussion of spirits balance, merely the imbalance of multiple killers
---
Yeah this is what I was thinking. An overly altruistic SWF with only one on gens is like a killer wet dream. Maybe not if youre playing trapper but what did you expect trapper just sucks
---
Thats a good idea. Ruin and devour hope are not a good mix cause ruin encourages survivors to go and look for your totem. If your gonna run ruin dont run devour hope
---
Or at least I should have brought the one that injures on disarm. But DAMN this match was rough.
---
Lots of them: shape, huntress, leatherface, and more. Check out my deviantart: https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/gallery/
---
He also sawed the fuck out of his leg
---
Dunno, I know when I play killer I go make a sandwich waiting for a game. Not sure why it takes so long if its gonna make shit matches
---
You had me at Shape
---
Collision is a thing, she’ll bodyblock that window if you wait. And doubling over scratch marks doesn’t do much if you’re moving the grass or bump into her. Once again, these all rely on the killer making a mistake, not the survivor being clever
---
Okay thanks :)
---
Spirit doesn't need a fix. She's counterable, and people just don't like the fact that it's not as easy as going from pallet loop to pallet loop. Anything that involves a semblance of actual skill to deal with is hated.
---
Excuse me why does that hook have TWO HOOKS. Otherwise nice drawing.
---
She has the mind of a master, she knows how to capitalise off her audience
---
I only main Jake P3 because survivors are all the same and I'm not wasting BP just to have different skins. I have 61/65 perks on him, all tier 3 and I like to use nonmeta perks while I play swf. Autodidact is fun.
---
&gt;edit: John Wraith
---
Im going to legally change my name to this now, thank you.
---
The killer is the power role,
---
Why on earth should a random adult be more equipped than a supernatural entity?
---
It will appear forever until you buy it, annoying as fuck
---
Awww
---
I forget how unoriginal and bland some moris are, this includes the trapper, wraith, HB, LF, Freddy, Pig. Honestly it would be pretty cool if they reworked these moris but BE isnt planning on making moris something that happens often and i guess it would be sort of a waste of time.
---
I wonder if it’s because the lack of killers in the high ranks or its because of swf with different ranks playing together 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
?
---
I hate that mechanic. I don't want to buy predator, do you understand entity?
---
Tysm you're too kind 💙
---
They must have had G-fuel too
---
do you have any idea how much that would cost XD
---
&gt;The Survivor is heavily injured and requires more time to be fully healed. Slows down the Survivor's Healing Speed by 20 %
---
That does not look like doubled, unless the wiki is fucked
---
Fuck Immersed Claudettes
---
It’s a drawing of the hooks from the basement but for it to really be effective in the illustration I cut it off towards the side at an angle so people could see more than one hook. Also thank you.
---
Some of those should take up 4 slots smh
---
I agree. Would be nice if they updated some.
---
this repost again
---
Doesn’t help his ability LITERALLY encourages camping
---
The way you were chasing that Kate reminded me of a couple days ago when a Jake I unhooked ran for a straight two minutes without stopping, even though I had we'll make it and was trying to heal him.
---
Yes of course
---
Makes more sense now that I look closer I'm dumb
---
my 2 main perks on every survivor are borrowed time and decisive the other 2 are just fuck around perks
---
Except it isn’t a matter of survivors skill, only the killer. This would be true if there were some other tool at the survivors disposal other than pallets and windows, but there aren’t. The only counterplay is doing stupid stuff and praying the killer makes a mistake
---
We had the exit gate open and I unhooked someone and took the fall so they could escape.....the killer picked me up and dropped me off at the hatch! Was quite nice of them!
---
Another game, called Identity V [DbD rip-off], also had this issue. Their solution was to slow down the repair progress during the beginning of the match, and then revert it back to its original speed after. However, this didn't solve the issue. Even using, in their game, top tier killers, it didn't stop this from happening. By the time the first person was downed, there were 2 gens left.
---
I seriously think that generator repair progress should not be 80s, it should be longer. I was thinking we remove Hex:Ruin as a perk, and simply 2x the time it takes for generators to get repaired. And also, somewhat, nerf the bonuses you get from working on generators with other survivors or items. I think that would be something to test out to see if it's a good starting point. But, we'll never know until BHVR takes initiative
---
It's happened multiple times at this point. I'd spend a game avoiding the killer and my first time on hook i'm instantly struggling
---
What I'm saying is losing is not fun to me, personally. Even if I looped the killer for 3 gens, its not satisfying after going down to noed or being tunneled by the killer then not being rescued on first hook. That is not fun for me personally. So, that social contract in which everyone must make the game fun for everyone does not really hold any water. Fun is very subjective and different to everyone. It would be impossible making the game fun for all people playing the game.
---
Only the last 2 are sort of balanced, everything else is broken OP.
---
Because it’s a game and should be balanced? This is straying into “buff killers because I play killer!” Territory bud. Also the fact that the entity feeds off the survivors hope of escape, overpowered killers don’t serve their purpose. That argument you’re trying to put forward has no legs to stand on
---
Matchmaking is fucked. Last night I joined a game  (me a rank 1 survivor) and the killer was rank 20.
---
Possible. Which ones?
---
It’s literally the most loopable and avoidable power in the game. I agree with what somebody else said, just some better add ons. It’s super obviously he was a rushed character.
---
suviver main bad
---
please laugh
---
You instantly go to struggle if you’re the last survivor alive or present in the trial.
---
Oh its a glitch of sprint they were supposed to fix i read that this month
---
It could be abused
---
I know that but this is when others are still alive. Like, i'll save someone then get hooked expecting to use deliverance, but then am instantly dropped to struggling negating any chance of that.
---
Nice downvotes
---
Cool argument
---
lul
---
First of all: can we leave my tag out of it? Freddy has nothing to do with this, and changing spirit doesn’t affect him at all. It’s pointless arguments that are better saved for another post. Second: spirits shards don’t glow when she starts phasing, the devs were very careful to make sure that they don’t. Her phasing animation is literally her resting animation, making it impossible for it to be different. That’s like me handing you an orange, then taking it back, then handing it to you again and you telling me that it’s a different orange. It’s the exact same orange. It’s the exact same animation. Once again, you’re showing ignorance for playing against spirit. I don’t really care if you play killer more than survivor, it makes no difference to me. But don’t try to participate in balance discussion is you lack the knowledge required
---
Yeah!
---
Right now I just use the perks I find with them, but consistently used ones are Distortion and Spine Chill. Both are frequently used on all survs.
---
IDEALLY, at a certain point, I want all my survivors to each be a different thing. Tapp can have Unbreakable, Tenacity, Flip-Flop and something else to be a SUPER WIGGLE DON'T TOUCH ME man.
---
Feng can have Lithe, Quick &amp; Quiet, Dance with Me and Spine Chill to let her fuckin' dissapear.
---
Dwight can be the buffiest healiest boi, I dunno. Just different all over. Ideally.
---
When did I say never cleanse? I didn't, I said only at the end of the game (That means when you're last alive and are looking for the hatch or the actual end game).
---
And just because the fountain is far away from an objective to cleanse means fuck all, you will be a detriment to your teammates, especially if they don't cleanse because you'll give her one of the easiest downs in the entire game. Not cleansing until the end (Like I said previously, but you know, I need to state it again cause you can't read), is the best case scenario unless you're an SWF and can hatch a plan of making all pools become corrupted at the same time, which I personally have not tried.
---
Lmao just had a claudette do that
---
I've given multiple counters, and your counter argument, every time, has been "That's only if the killer messes up". Well, that's kinda the point of the game isn't it? If the killer does everything absolutely perfect as per your argument, shouldn't the chase end in about 2-3 minutes. Yeah, an infallible spirit has very little counters, so does literally every other perfectly mastered killer. That's the whole point of perfectly mastered.
---
&gt;Nobody plays like this
---
You're right, they do the same thing but WITH perks and items making it even worse. It's a perfectly valid argument. It's not rare you get optimized, coordinated players, and people need to stop pretending it is. You don't need a SWF group to know how to do generators officially because it's not a hard thing to accomplish.
---
These arent balanced. Why are these never balanced...

Nice. I look like david so i think ill give a go at shirtless david cosplay
---
This ! 
---
I used to run self care untill I leveled up Dwight and realised how good bond is. The awareness it gives you is massive. 
---
Unless I'm playing SWF, bond is always my number 1 pick.
---
Hype. I thought so but wasn't sure. I run it as a part of my regular build all the time just to clear totems much faster. Especially after totem BP boost. DELICIOUS.
---
No, thank YOU! You got skillz!!!
---
I mainly use Legion, Myers, The Pig, and Freddy. I've never played the others for more than 2 games because I found them boring or unappealing.
---
I only play 2 survivors. So yeah i use the same build.
---
Thank you Peter explains the joke
---
And it’s the most useless potato survivor that gets to survive... kinda like Bran.
---
&gt; Logic: reasoning conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity
---
There’s no logic in the hate mail on xbox. I got one blasting me for camping - which I was. I was camping a survivor on the hook next to the open exit gate. I thought I’d appeal to their logic and ask what I was supposed to do. As expected I just got another incoherent spew of bile in my messages
---
Had to include them being sacrified at the end  RIP
---
&gt; BT allow the survivor to unhook directly in your face
---
Stop camping, problem solved
---
I agree ruin is awfull design. But many solutions were proposed by the community and all were downvoted to hell, so devs can't do much.
---
did you make all the killers if so can you send me all the pngs so i can use them :D
---
Surprised Meg didn't sprint burst away from him...
---
Also, I don't know if you've looked at this post, but uhhhh, 90% of the spirits uncounterable have downvotes and the counters listed are upvoted. If you prefer not to hear it from me, read others comments.
---
Rank 7, first three weeks of playing the game, got adept wraith at that level as well
---
Killer main here! I don’t think blinding after pallets is toxic, HOWEVER the moment I see that teabag I will tunnel you into oblivion. Sorry.
---
I would add to what has already been said that emblems also don't always reflect what is actually good to do. Like altruism is a big one, where saving someone isn't the mark of a good player, having more survivors survive would be. If the killer facecamps someone and the other three escape, everyone did a good job (including the person who stayed up on the hook the whole time, even if they shouldn't get points in other shards).
---
This...could actually work.
---
Probably just another bug. Hopefully it gets patched soon
---
jason is possible?
---
Git gud
---
Survivors: "OMG new killer OP nerf now!!"
---
Also Survivors: "OMG why is everyone playing the same three killers this is BS!!"
---
It's not toxic to play the game intelligently.
---
Your point fights against itself.
---
While I agree that players generally get better as a game ages and people find out new tech, what you’re saying is that only survivors skill increases while that’s not true. Killers skill level improves alongside it.
---
So we can assume that they at least evolve at a similar rate. And along that way, the game has been making minor changes consistently to make the game easier on being a killer. Anything from big changes like instablind flashlights being taken away to being able to close the hatch at the end of the game.
---
So basically your counter point falls apart without me even having to argue it.
---
I think a Doctor or Nurse or maybe even Hillbilly movie would also be fucking stellar
---
Fucking seriously. Spent my whole last match unhooking my suicidal teammates who didn't want to play against Legion because lEgIoN oP! Would unhook them and heal them to full just for them to immediately run into the Killer's arms again.
---
In particular there was this one Feng who I unhooked with Borrowed Time and let myself get downed to save her. What does this bitch do? Fucking *stands still and lets the Killer down her anyways!*
---
Best part is I didn't even pip because I spent the whole game unhook everyone. Fucking glorious.
---
Idk, did i say something wrong?
---
Hex: KYF
---
SO WE BACK IN THE MINE
---
&gt; I dont camp, but if i hook someone and while im walking away i see someone go for the unhook im going to go back for them.
---
Easy. Hit the unhooker. He will then unhook the person. Then hit him again. Hook that person instead.
---
Killer can't control your knowledge all the time either 
---
They aren't basically the same, they aren't the same at all. It's not a nitpick, it's a drastic difference and it absolutely addresses the issue because it exposes the premise of your issue as flawed.
---
You can blatantly see and play around traps if you're playing smart and scouting around the map while awake to make note of where real pallets are.
---
*Laughs in only $1.1M, adjusted for inflation*
---
Thats normal if you been playing the game from the time it launched in 2016 till early last year 2018 alot of wait time when playing swf took over an hr (ps4)
---
How about not.
---
10 seconds per gen isn't enough to make up for the loss of Ruin. Maybe if they nerf Ruin and then increase gen time 100 seconds, but that's just more time that survivors are staring at a progress bar. There really needs to be some other kind of secondary objective that will keep survivors off gens and is more compelling than just doing some channeled action.
---
And bloodwarden cause those mall chain link drop-down gates to cover the exit lol
---
Ummm... yeah I would 👀
---
Ah I getcha
---
Nah, it’s just the reworked sprint burst 👌
---
Just watch videos by top survivors and try to argue again that survivors is low skill cap.... They take plenty of Skill.
---
Yeah like the key on the phone keyboard
---
A surprising amount of people have never played chess and the knight is the hardest piece for beginners to learn.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Why loud and queer and with pride? Do straight people stream “LOUD and STRAIGHT”  why do I need to be told upfront what you do with your genitalia? I don’t care. It’s a game. If you are interesting and good I’ll watch. If not I won’t. Your genitals have nothing to do with it.
---
It's not always that simple, most if the time you dont get back in time to get both hits
---
Yes I know chess
---
I prefer results over how pretty he looks
---
Yes it’s surprising
---
&gt; 10 seconds per gen isn't enough to make up for the loss of Ruin.
---
That might actually be totally true. I suggested this small number but 100 seconds is probably more accurate.
---
&gt; There really needs to be some other kind of secondary objective that will keep survivors off gens and is more compelling than just doing some channeled action.
---
I mean this is 2 separate issues. You aren't wrong about this, but even if you add secondary objectives, ruins is still a problem.
---
Killer good. Survivor bad.
---
Maybe, but most of the playerbase is trash at this game so it kind of balances out.
---
Shoot me if I ever get so pussyhurt over NOED.
---
You're bad
---
Good point, throughly agree.
---
Arcade map + stranger things hmmmmmmmmm?
---
So people like us can know its a safe zone for LGBT community. Im not saying what I do with my genitals, being gay is more than just flashing your own genitals. Thanks for your concern tho
---
Damn I really am dumb
---
Yeah that happens because no one pops up on b&amp;c so they are like ok they are bumrushing me lemme get out my lawn chair and rev the saw
---
I think I'm dumber I deleted all my work
---
He said he's going to play more toxic. Playing the game in a standard manner isn't toxic, but you'll still get bitched at for it.
---
That would sound like his actual theme, except the instruments are replaced with those used for music in 1970’s porn.
---
Everyone is still adjusting to new Freddy. He’s kind of a basic killer now so just go against him kinda like how you would against someone like Hillbilly or Hag. Beware of the traps and mind your surroundings and try to loop as best as you can. 
---
Just cause you’re dying a lot doesn’t mean he’s OP though. And the only reason you’re not having fun is cause you’re just dying a lot.
---
Billy takes way more skill than nurse, solely because of curves.
---
Once you hit the red ranks, that's all you'll regularly see. Not that GF or Wraith doesn't happen, it's just dominated by Billy. He also has the highest fatality rate on Xbox as well
---
That's why I've been playing way less DbD...
---
Removing ruins and instead adding a secondary objective is actually a good idea.
---
creeper
---
Have you tried crying? I find that an effective counter to the emotions.
---
Did the change to ambush make it so that perks no longer interact with it?
---
dang, I thought you were serious until I saw that /s
---
Spine chill user here and honestly I’m thankful when a Mikey gets out of tier one quick lmao.
---
If you have the perk, it's max 60 seconds. Note though that the End Game Collapse goes at like half speed if a survivor is dying or hooked, so more like in the last 30 seconds. If it's down to that point, then the survivors REALLY screwed up as they had 1.5 minutes to leave minimum.
---
Thanks OP I wanna hear about em too
---
&gt; I don't like it either, but they said they won't just add x seconds to generators to make games longer. It's boring and doesn't require any skill
---
The thing is, what they have to realize is ruins essentially IS added time to generators. Doing a generator with ruins on is easily like 30% longer.
---
The difference between ruins at 80 seconds and no ruins at 100 second is essentially just RNG. Ruins gameplay isn't "more fun" or shorter.
---
What perks do you run, fellow bing bonger ?
---
They are eventually gonna add new emotes, and i think killlers might get some
---
I don't really see her at red ranks. She's lethal, but personally i find her boring to play as, hence her lack of popularity.
---
I would love that so much
---
I love bubba, I main him at red ranks. The only reason I main him is that I'm a diehard fan of Texas Chain Saw Massacre, one of the greatest horror films ever made.
---
Perhaps a bug? Try and get a clip next time it happens
---
This kind of play goes away when you get out of the bad ranks and into green or purple...good killers dont facecamp...Proxy camp maybe
---
Can you get characters free on console or just pc?
---
Until we dont get a way of knowing how many totems are left in the game noed is goign to be still a issue
---
I see this said a lot. How long has the playerbase been trash and do you think some of it is by choice (people trying to dodge an abundance of Nurses) or people just not caring to get better? 
---
Or people just aren't good at making the micro decisions necessary for this game?
---
I’m really glad I don’t have to do this. lol
---
I have Dying Light and it gave me a 60% off coupon for DBD. Maybe tomorrow there might be a DBD X Dying Light crossover DLC with some dying light themed cosmetics? 
---
Since theres not gonna be a summer event, they probably decided to add a cross promo dlc for everyone instead.
---
It's not a free hit unless the survivors are potatoes, which doesn't have a whole lot to do with the power
---
I like how you’re calling me grandpa because you can’t attack my argument so you try to attack me personally. Hilarious.
---
Also this game is only 3 years old, and honestly playing from the start of the game till now gives me better perspective on talking about these matters because I was around to see all the changes.
---
Also the way your argument is worded it definitely implies you’re only referring to only survivors and not everyone.
---
And as I stated, both killer and survivors skill levels would rise at a similar rate. So it renders your point null no matter what.
---
Yes its easy because as a killer rank 20 u pretty often get survivor rank 8 and its not so hard to rank up when killer is a brand new player
---
I hope you're right. I just got the game last week so I'm still low ranked, but it really kills the enjoyment of the game when you get hooked and the killer just walks in circles around you or sits on you to make sure they get a kill...
---
yea i really dont like the 3rd person ones for killers.   let me see that shit first person!!!!
---
Just to give you an example, a couple of days ago I replied to a guy in a comment under a post who said something like: offering for haddonfield=DC. Just to add another thing to the list.
---
People like you that makes me hate this game sometimes.
---
Dude, this game is about the memes. Anyone who disagrees probably plays at red ranks and/or doesn't have any fun.
---
You do you.
---
Lmao what is this from? That dude sees people under attack by bees so he sends more bees?
---
Na Killers don't suffer equally on Lery. Nurse or Billy suffer way more than most M1 killers such as Doctor or myers
---
BP is useless once you get a good build.
---
I would fucking love a Legion, Huntress, or Ghostface (BHVR's ghost face so don't even mention the Scream films)
---
 cool thanks
---
Same here lmao
---
Bub last time I played a game of survivor was in december last year. I'm almost exclusively a killer player, that doesn't mean I have to only argue in killer's favour.
---
&gt;pretending to be the poor weak victims even though survivors still have the advantage.
---
Nowhere did I say that survivors are well balanced or weak, 4 good survivors will beat anything that isn't omegablink nurse with tracking perks. I just think that using the edge case of literal depip squads with most of the videos being year old isn't a good idea. 
---
I can argue that killer is op by showing you videos of omegablink ebony mori nurse games. That doesn't really prove my point, does it? It's an edge case scenario that doesn't happen often.
---
in my experience it doesn't matter. at least when you get to higher ranks, regardless people will always search for totems.
---
bubba is basically a M1 killer with no power because his chainsaw takes too long to charge and his slowdown when revving punishes him too much
---
*Evil Dead creeps up*
---
Anything else in that update? Did they fix Dead Hard?
---
I feel like even Gordon was more memorable than Hoffman and he was Jigsaw for all of five minutes on screen. He was pretty badass though.
---
I wouldn’t mind badges tbh.
---
I know, but Killer is still super fun to play.
---
That’s old Freddy. New Freddy doesn’t benefit from the permanent aura reading.
---
or they just cleanse devour hope right away and you're left with 3 perks. 
---
and THAT my friend is the real #feelsbadman
---
Can everyone stop bitching. He doesn't like flashlights who tf cares.

---
Brutal Strength vs Enduring?
---
Do you need to vent?
---
So it seems like the chase is the name of the game in your opinion. At least when it comes to skill. And I seen others share this sentiment. 
---
But you do think that's a fair measure of skill when most killers have a little help with loops and chases or are basically ignore chases altogether?
---
Not trying to poke holes in your stance, just curious on your input.
---
I mean that's the case with every hex perk in my experience
---
There really shouldn’t be any “social contract”. If someone wants to solo themselves the whole way through, fine. If you want to be a team player, fine. If you want to be a total dick, fine. I don’t have control over you or your actions and I shouldn’t. That wouldn’t be fun for you. I’m not gonna like you and I’ll probably call you a dick in the chat, but at the end of the day it’s a competitive game. 
---
People are going to play how they want to play. Sometimes you have dick survivor buddies, sometimes dick killers. It’s the way it goes. Way too many people on this sub have such thin skins when you don’t play how they think you should play.
---
well if you're trying to distract the killer, why would you get mad if they tunnel you to death, so that you cant distract him anymore
---
It's not an edge case to know how to sit and repair a generator effectively. All it takes is a toolbox. It's a dumb argument to say only SWF 4-mans know how to effectively do generators, and fact of the matter is non-mobility killers no matter what cannot guard generators well enough
---
Maybe Distortion to counter BBQ unless they have that Ghostface perk that blocks all gens not being done and the ones that are being worked on glow
---
Not that I saw, there wasn't any other information. I believe its going to just be Left Behind's fix but we'll have to wait until tomorrow to see, I guess!
---
Finally geez,i didnt even want It but i felt left out... Or.. behind ... Get It? Ill go
---
What killer do you use?
---
Drop kick perk confirmed
---
&gt; They say “the game is the most balanced it’s ever been” and then proceed to complain for like 30 minutes about something lol
---
These aren't mutually exclusive. There has been a ton of good balance changes, but for example the Ironworks window is still there after all those years.
---
That nea is disgusting. I can not stand for this blasphemy
---
Slug. When you down someone look to start another chase is possible.
---
Getting someone out of the game quickly usually means tunneling, its not fun for the person you tunnel but sometimes you dont have much of a choice and 3 vs 1 is a lot easier.
---
Give up chasing on strong structures, even if they have gen in them just let them do it and defend other gens.
---
3 gens strategy should be considered on some maps or when survivors mess up.
---
I am defending Kate’s actions. And it’s not that I don’t want people to reply, it’s that you have no point and you’re a child. You done now?
---
*vommy mommy* I hate that so much lol
---
He’s already here
---
&gt; Adding a secondary objective would already be a nerf to Ruin because it would allow the survivors to focus on something other than generators while looking for the totem while also still making progress towards escaping.
---
That makes sense, but if your secondary objective is fairly significant, that feels like a fairly big survivor nerf which might need to be compensated in some ways? Maybe reduce generator repair time?
---
So if you end up with a significant secondary objective, but only 60 seconds gens, that does feel like a clear nerf to ruins i'd agree. Would def not be 100% mandatory anymore.
---
Give all the weak one hit killers Freddy’s teleport power and lets call it a day.
---
Its a Map addon. You can set the beacon anywhere ur standing but one at a time.
---
Pick one of the three killers that can generate map pressure.  Spirit, Nurse, Billy.
---
Thrilling tremors/corrupt intervention also slow down the game slightly, but are situational and don't really pair well with ruin.   
---
Red ranks are cancer due to how the emblem system works in this game for ranks.  Unless you are going for the achievement, just don't bother with anything above green.
---
Monstrous shrine
---
GODAMNIT BUBBA, GIVE ME BBQ&amp; CHILL
---
I love how they just ignore this. If you made it flipped around you'd have killers mains going "survivor good killer bad". This sub is full of a bunch of dinguses.
---
Thank you for this
---
It was frightening initially, so I ran. The killer &amp; I had a long conversation after the game, he apologized for striking at all.
---
I think it sounds pretty cute! :)
---
Boosted?
---
hags using make your choice with rusty shackles makes me wanna kill myself
---
I’ve had it done to me once and it was that exact situation, they were just messing about and I just went sure why not, I still think quick and quiet plays a part in preventing the stun for some reason. I had high hopes for head on, I was disappointed
---
ignore the third one. The rest are great!
---
Big brain 300 IQ memes
---
He’s been out on Xbox for a week now I think
---
And yet killers complain about SWF, it's necessary to have a chance because these stuff happens.
---
Yea, I do play killer occasionally but I just find survivor much more relaxing usually
---
The best counter to extreme SWF is camping . Sorry to say it.  They usually refuse to leave anyone behind. 
---
Camping is boring, but it works against entitled assholes who abuse matchmaking most of the time. 
---
Taking a break can be a big help
---
Though.
---
It's not only doing generators, it's being able to keep the killer busy for long enough to buy time for those survivors to be able to do those generators freely.
---
I believe ya, and like I said lets say it's the very start of the game and I see 2 survivors, a bill and a nea with that skin. Both fully healed, no hooks, equal risk. I would simply choose the nea because I know better people play nea w/ that skin and obviously you want to knock out the best players first.
---
I don't know how that sentiment pissed off some people haha
---
I love this comment
---
But he would have that face as he feeds of their stalk
---
It was fixed, now it's more exploit because it can be achieved only with programs
---
It's really not that hard today. Most of the playerbase isn't amazing at the game still, also the game itself got way easier for killer.
---
Finally 👏
---
You didnt know untill now?
---
Lockers counter BBQ, distortion counters BBQ.  You can run when he is projecting so it isn’t a free hit.  Then he has to Choose to pop the gen and possibly lose you or chase you and possibly lose pop or the gen might be completed by a teammate during your chase.
---
Yeah and even with all those changes the vast majority of maps have pallets and loops galore, so when you add on the time it takes for a non-mobility killer to get to said generators it's not enough time
---
Now should be balanced around the chases player have with Nurse or some killer like the Clown? 
---
Those chases look very different and that in itself isn't bad, but from a balancing perspective, I'm not sure now it would look.
---
If you never changed your loadout since then, you could still keep it. As soon as you changed it, you couldn't go back though.
---
Of course i do but i dont post it on reddit and than blame others xD FacePalm
---
Let me rephrase this again:  
---
If I see a default dwight and a weeb nea right next to eachother, both fully healed, both no hooks, both equal risk. I am going to chase the weeb nea 100% of the time first. 
---
What's so wrong with that? I know people who use that skin tend to be better players, and obviously you want to knock out your better players first right? What are you so offended about?
---
Would you say climbing rank currently is more of an indication of skill or just an understanding how pipping works?
---
There's a difference between "imbalanced map" and "map with structure where you could run for an hour straight and still not catch the survivor".
---
And besides, don't act like it's a killer-exclusive behavior. Survivors dc all the time. Hell, even I dc against Prayer Beads. Pretending like "killer calls standard game mechanic toxic" and "killer dc's without a word against survivor deliberately taking him to a broken map so he can make the killer have an unfun and unfair experience" are in the same ballpark is disingenuous and you know it. There's a guy who stream snipes killer mains with strode key + balanced landing who, when asked, *literally* said he does it because he wants people to hate him.
---
You could pull them out of the locker, and repeatedly drop and pick them up to eventually make them auto-break free. I have not gotten the trophy but 99% of failed attempts I see are because of the last guy DCing like a pussy because cucking your achievement is appearently worth the 0 bloodpoints and -2 pips. Frankly people who DC out of spite like that deserve to be 3-genned into submission by a Hostage Doc. 
---
And by the way, if I'm somehow the last man against a Judith's Myers and hatch is nowhere in sight or already shut I'm eating the tombstone and not going to pussy out in a locker just to deny an achievement.
---
By the way, I discovered it's possible to tombstone 3 people with tombstone piece. My EW3 expired naturally over time (Was running Tombstone Piece and J Myers Memorial for Tombstone Tuesday a while back) mid-tombstoning, and instead of my EW meter being 25% full from a tombstone kill it was 75% full, and the third guy I tombstoned was almost completely full of stalker juice at the time. I am very curious if there's an easier way to get Evil Incarnate with just a tombstone piece and extreme micromanagement of who you stalk and tombstone in what order.
---
I AM THE ULTIMATE COPYPASTA CREATOR, BOW TO ME, GIVE ME YOUR spaghetti with 300% more of IGGY'S STANDO, THE FOOL!  but istead of R A W G L A S S add BUCKET O CHIKEN 2!
---
Its pizza time
---
Again I'm not talking about what is wrong and what is right, i'm just saying that in the pool of things which killers complain about he missed more than a couple of things. You said you got 2 complainers in your entire experience in this game as survivor so I just wanted to give you the most recent example that came in my mind.
---
Btw I got red rank killer without quitting every game that would be hard. Like play with billy, one game you can get Lery memorial institute which is probably the worst for billy and the other game you can get rotten field where you can almost check every gen with a chainsaw sprint. (Just to say, if you don't like to loop a window 3 times bamboozle is a thing).
---
I probably would have done that if I wasn't doing so well during the game.
---
You have to start from the top.
---
Phil, working for his boss, doing junkyard things, boss is dealing with police and rivals giving him a hard time. Obviously politics and civil bullshit. Assholes.
---
Phil hears whispers from the machine from Time to time. Only when it's running. 
---
Cops stop showing up. Rivals stop doing shit to sabotage the operation of the yard. Slowly.
---
Fewer visitors. 
---
Federal investigators get involved. Start to look at Phil. Cuz, black. That's why.
---
Phil is scared, and even he sees the obvious foul play.
---
Boss pins it on Phil, Phil gets pissed. Phil confronts boss, tells him to take back his incriminating statements. Boss shows how Phil killed everyone.
---
Phil kills boss. Whispers follow him now.
---
Entity scoops him up. Torture. Break his spirit. Convince him he is a bad person. Give him bell, so he can take revenge.
---
Pallet stun. Teabag.
---
The end.
---
If you have to pick one I would say go with Brutal Strength. Enduring I think now only affects pallet stuns, brutal strength is useful both on the pallets and damaging gens.
---
Once you see them, you will wish Nea moried you.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cji19e/bloodweb_bug_there_are_not_confections_to_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
You could try using it without ruin on a killer that can apply constant pressure. Usually when there's no ruin most people don't even bother to check for other hexes.
---
But I can mwahahaha
---
Though I mostly find tunneling a toxic behavior I was talking about this:
---
&gt;Flashlights to me are anti fun because the people who use them generally use them to extend the chase not escape.  
---
But honestly I usually find it more productive to build the map pressure rather than following one single survivor
---
holy shit he actually looks scary wtf
---
People get mad at everything, no worries and no hard feelings I understand that.
---
Is using mad grit + agitation a bug or a feature?
---
I mean, he isn’t Jane thicc but... he a little thicc
---
Awesome! Glad I could help.
---
Run devour and not ruin.  Remove all incentives to find the totems and they won’t bother.
---
The "nerfs" aren't even nerfs!
---
The traps not working AFTER the gate is open is fine because A, you should have used them all by that point (unless the match was fast, in which case your problem with the Pig isn't her nerfs) and B, it prevents basically an inescapable situation with her just tunneling people with the trap on their head.
---
AND IT STILL WORKS IF THEY HAD THE TRAP ON IF THE LAST GEN GETS DONE.
---
Its the dumbest thing to complain about.
---
Her other "nerf" is her special attack not counting as a normal attack... Which makes sense. I can, however, understand people being upset about it
---
That'll do.
---
I can confirm

Coldwind farm, outside the thompson house, I think is the realm that has the least number of lockers. That or shelter woods

Killer good. Survivor good. I know that's a joke, but people should just stop giving crap to the other side of the game because they main another.

Aw man

What's the difference between efficiency and speed add ons for tool boxes
---
Ye but the fact is that some players are just salty kids who play only when they know they have an advantage on the opponent. Have you ever play with billy on rotten fields? Let me know if you get less than 3 kills how to do it, maybe if you use the keyboard and mouse with your feets.
---
Giant target
---
Yeah I don't think I've met any red rank survivors that want Freddy nerfed.
---
To be fair boldness isn't hard to max if you're decent at extending chases.
---
But aren't you doing the same...?
---
please do the hag
---
You will also hear "tiers" referred to when playing as or against the Doctor. Survivors gain madness when affected by Doc's power. At each tier, the survivor will scream and reveal their location, see Doctor hallucinations, and will receive the jittery madness skill checks. Tier 3 is the max tier and is when you need to snap out of it.
---
Tiers might also be referring to perk levels. For example, tier 1 sprint burst causes exhaustion for 60 seconds versus tier 3 at 40 seconds.
---
Jesus what the actual fuck lmao I need to try this
---
Story of my life.
---
"Why weren't you a gen jockey, I had the killer chase me the entire match?" 
---
"Because I broke all the totems and then did a gen and a half."
---
"So you were useless?"
---
"I don't trust totems ever."
---
"Just genrush you noob."
---
"You were the only one that died and had decisive while bagging, you kinda deserved it after a bag."
---
"I can tell you play deathgarden because you take the killer's side."
---
Never in my life have I actually been more confused about survivors in dbd until that moment. 
---
As a David King main, I was at a loss for words.
---
Youtube glorified toxic behaviour amongst survivors and killers alike so now when the game is popular we are left with people who want to mimic every single move that youtuber makes just so their ego can grow, dont believe me- type in youtube: toxic dbd and look how much of that shit there is
---
Nice way to waste a key
---
Oh well, most games that have been out this long have a lot of vocal veterans that don't want to see anything drastically changed as they've poured hundreds/thousands of hours into adapting to the meta.
---
Maybe for DBD2 we can see something like this
---
Dude you slugged for 90% of your downs and didn’t commit to half your chases. No one was following you disarming your traps we disarmed them long after you placed IN A VERY OBVIOUS SPOT you had noed and STILL slugged and Me (the rank 4) did 2 gens and the 14 did 1 the rank 11 only did 2 gens so what you said about that is bullshit nobody was harassing you and we weren’t trying to make the game longer that’s just what happens when you chase somebody who’s good  and slug when you finally get them 🤪🤪
---
Now this... this is a top quality meme I can get behind.
---
Updooted
---
Lol what even is this. Was he having a heart attack or something? :/
---
Also, why is this tagged as "NSFW"? :p
---
Maybe if m1 killers with powers that don't help in a chase didn't suck complete ass people would play them rather then playing Nurse, Billy and Spirit.
---
Giving killers like Trapper, Wraith etc. something like 120% move speed would go a long way to making them not feel like trash with no map pressure and 0 lethality against competent survivors (Its not fun at rank 1 to run around a pallet slowly getting closer.. over.. and over..)
---
First, there is no *medium* vault for pallets. Second, killer can break the pallet permanently, he can't do the same for a window. So there is counterplay on both vaults. Making *medium* vault for pallets would be unfair.
---
Fortunately not, although for some reason I haven't seen many Myers lately which makes me sad
---
I guess he found his lighter.
---
Is everyone else dead? If you're the last alive it just auto kills you
---
&gt;is Trapper
---
&gt;You focused on traps
---
(Saitama okay)
---
So playing chess for 7 years actually helpead me
---
I started playing on rank reset and it was challenging but fun. Surprisingly didn't see too much toxicity
---
No others will still be alive
---
You can easily wound a survivor, find the other survivors with killer instinct and you can catch up to them way faster than your normal speed. Legion can slow the game down a lot if played right and keep survivors injured 24/7. Basically you want to wound a survivor with Feral Frenzy and try to hit as many survivors as possible while in feral frenzy, but if your power runs out, chase the last survivor you hit or the one causing you the most trouble.
---
I like talking about the game, it was a pleasure replying.
---
People will say to you to "git gud" and learn how to play Clown or Freddy, but the reality is if surviors drop a pallet against Clown or Freddy with Dream Snares, you need to break it, especially if it's a safe one ( and if it's a unsafe one, you don't need their powers anyway ) and they can stall you long enough for generators to e done.
---
Hit multiple survivors, make them lose time mending and healing, find survivors easier and a bit of pressure between gens
---
The best build requires all four people working on this nonsense: Kindred, Open Handed, Bond And Detective’s Hunch. 
---
Just with perks alone, anyone on the hook reveals the killer in a 48M radius. 
---
When someone pops a gen, they see the auras of every gen, totem and chest in a 97m radius. 
---
When no one is on a hook, Bond will maintain a constant 64m track of one another for all healing and safe looping to avoid running the killer into someone else.
---
Now if someone brings a Rainbow Map with Green Stamp and Crystal Bead, you’ll be able to track the objects on that map 32m further out (you can see the hatch from 40m away omegalul) And if the map holder has completed a gen and got the auras of everything with Detectives Hunch, everyone can see EVERYTHING. 
---
When I do this with my friends, I’m the map wielder and call myself the All Seeing Adam.
---
You just got Good jobed
---
Background should be full of DC logos.

Yeah he does.

It took him pretty long tho
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Hmm. Now I'm curious if a nice chunk of players hang out just outside or red or somewhere 10 and below.
---
Dude that's literally what you did all game, you applied hardly any pressure, I did one full gen with ruin still up. And then i popped another full gen with ruin, that nea the rank 11 did nothing she was hiding in corners almost all match. You also run loops very wide, can't do anything but blame yourself we also didn't use 3 syringes. I used one on the bot nea when you downed her, she was an easy target from the start.
---
The perk’s effect is “when there are two totems left, you are immune to hexes” and I fucking said that it’s an unhealthy mechanic holy shit how do you not get it?
---
Are you of the mind that Nurse just needs to be deleted out the game or do you think she is salvageable?
---
And spoiler.
---
That bot nea didn't do shit she hid in corners I popped 2 gens with ruin just like you
---
&gt;"You also put words in the developers mouth, because he did not say there was no difference between P3 and P0 for any rarity."  
---
I never said he said that. I said it's been proven to be the case. I also posted a source for that. You have read the source, right?  
---
&gt;"But you would just be a child about it and tell me McLean said something else that he didn't, to support your claims."  
---
You realise I posted a direct link to his very quote, right? You have researched at least one single source I've shared, right?  
---
&gt;"I don't go around making shit up, you absolutely did, and it's online for everyone to see."  
---
Again, look at the sources I have shared to support each and every one of my claims. Surely, you are not this ignorant. I refuse to believe you're genuinely this dumb.  
---
&gt;"I'm still not as full of shit as you."  
---
Ooooh, the irony. I believe we're done here. There's clearly no reaching through to your skull when you are willing to literally ignore facts to push your own, unfounded opinion. Buh-bye.
---
Wow...
---
Yeah I'm pretty new, but I was referring to a situation in which I had seen someone walking crouching in the direction of the hook and instead of looking for them, I played dumb and went to a distant generator, or I looked for the survivors that BBQ revealed.
---
RROOAA! &lt;3
---
It's a different story. They had the rights to use ghostface's mask but not the movies
---
At least you get to play on the meat plant... killers ways DC at the start for me.
---
I know dude
---
Finally. I guess the summer vacation outfits will be out as well?
---
_laughs in xbox_
---
Just break the pallet.
---
It's an original lore, but with heavy influence from ghostface movies. Ghostface is kind of a mantle and can be anyone, their goals are usually to make it to the media and to study their victims to create a perfect crime, all the while tantalizing the police with planted evidence just enough to keep from being caught.
---
can't you open the door for them instantly
---
+1 the 3 gen strategy. If you can find a way to stop the team from getting certain gens done early(harder then it sounds) they may get the first 2 gens finished quick, maybe a third, but don’t let that shake your gameplan. Getting the last couple generators finished will be tougher if as killer you make sure the remaining ones are in aren’t too far from eachother. It’ll give you an easier route to patrol, and slowing their progress with kicks is easier if they do small increments of work in between each loop. Coupled with the right build on your killer it makes a huge difference imo.
---
Do I lose unlocked perks and items/addons when prestiging? 
---
Your comment of being a completionist makes me wonder. Cant u just grind all perks at level 50?
---
The ability to ignore pallets will ALWAYS be overpowered. I guess it could be better (more balanced) by disallowing 3 or more blinks and crazy distance add-ons, but that doesn't stop the best of the best Nurse players being unbeatable.
---
Can anyone explain what this is?
---
If 3 survivors are all standing in a doorway, that isn’t Bubba being OP, that’s survivors being dumb as hell. Its like saying, “Survivor all out in the open, far away from any cover while standing still and teabagging? Billy OP”. If you put a killer in their strongest scenario *and* make the survivors dumb, any killer can be argued to be OP
---
Nice grammar very epic
---
Legion is so boring though
---
This is so perfect. Literally just happened to me. Killed all 4 and get called bad. I don't understand. He proceeded to show he's the type of player to go "lmao so trash" after I kill all 4, and the type to go "lmao EZ" if he escapes. My favorite part is finding out how bad I am when everyone is killed.
---
I was reported because I wasn't taking the game seriously... Because I used bloodhound...
---
Your* I hate myself.
---
Sounds like you were the target of Rancor. Like you could see the killers aura or were you able to see people’s auras when one guy in particular was hooked cause it could have been Kindred.
---
Yes, no problem they are custom icons for status effects for dbd
---
What the hell is that build
---
Legit how do you play clown?
---
Your first mistake was using The Game map offering with trapper...
---
Prestige 3 Claudette. With full bloody skin AKA John Cena skin.
---
If you’re carrying someone and have both perks you move hella fast and swing hella fast. Nothing new there.
---
Billy basically has a series of movies already. They're called Wrong Turn, lol.
---
This....👌👌👌👌 but who would be the Killer though ? Hopefully not Carlito Keyes? 😂
---
Huh, guessing you haven't seen near yet.
---
Idk about making gens last longer but I’m down for another objective after completing the gens
---
meanwhile, killer mains cried so hard over Mettle of Man, that the devs nerfed that into fucking oblivion.
---
it's used to suck ass...that's is all...that is his only objective
---
Are you stupid or something?
---
When a survivor is self healing that's time **wasted** on not doing gens and your title is complaining about gen times.
---
Like, you're so full of contradictions it's unreal
---
I'm a PC player, so no?
---
Flare: Salt&amp;Rant
---
*laughs in PC*
---
Survivor bad, killer bad.
---
If you fall into the Us vs Them mentality, then you are part of the problem. Play both, play how you would wish you would be treated, and don't cry when others don't stand up to your own morality set.
---
It's a game, try and fucking enjoy it; that's what games are supposed to be for.
---
&gt;Um, why would I mention the purpose of the perk? And it does have a downside, which I stated. Also, just down the person in a chase. Boom, self care only works after an unhook, in which it only hurts the team even moreb
---
Your logic is baffling. The downside is, oh, it takes longer to heal IF you heal yourself. There's still no limit to healing. You're not hindered in any other way. So, logically, if you weren't being healed by another survivor your would run to a pallet or strong loop and then heal. 
---
And sorry to inform you but survivors can heal after being hit. It's not just being hooked or being downed.
---
I run Sloppy, Bloodhound, PWYF, and STBFL. I’m fast af.
---
Welp, you got us there
---
Huh, guess internet lied to me
---
*able to remove the pallet, thus taking away the vault entirely*
---
"Let me complain about how there is no counterplay to this"
---
Because it was fair that you guys got hit 3 times and then got one hit of armor? Please tell me how getting hit 3 times is situational.
---
This post hurts my brain it’s so cringe
---
Or sandbags
---
Now that is a gave only a mother could love. Mucho talented you are.
---
I'm trying to engage with people and have an actual conversation but if you want to act like an entitled dick weed then so be it.
---
*says the r-word*
---
**YOU HAVE BEEN BANNED BY THE DEAD BY DAYLIGHT DISCORD**
---
Gen rushing is literally just a strategy lmao how can you be mad at survivors doing their objective
---
Hmm ok
---
This looks amazing! So excited for the Spirit one
---
If u destroy a hook im more likely to thank u for wasting your time, unless you 99%'d it and are destroying it as I walk towards it with a survivor, in which case I applaud your foresight and testicular fortitude.
---
Anal beads spirit
---
Both isn't always an option, as you'd need to give up a perk slot for it
---
No, I was stunned once
---
I never knew how ugly nea’s face was until now
---
How hard would it be to get meta perks. And what are they?
---
im just mad the people say it doesnt exist, I say it does and its a strat but people say it doesnt causing the devs to overlook gebs getting done in like 30 secs with one person
---
She's also by far the least aesthetically pleasing killer. Well, maybe tied with spirit but still. Even the way she runs looks dumb.
---
Don’t get it
---
My children, I will tell you a little secret
---
there are literally no rules
---
They are all made up 
---
But that is none of my business *sips tea*
---
ohhh alright mb
---
4 iridescents
---
That makes no sense. Make people wait longer for playing the killer they like instead of putting you in a game as quick as possible with all killers? You can’t just make queue times quicker for other killers.
---
Not to mention the 14000 I'll have to spend to recover the add-ons and offering
---
It’s okay :)
---
They did that because enduring made DS a useless anti tunneling perk. And they did nerf it. And mowbhas specific conditions and a timer(this is the nerf, not the conditions). Balancing something as they nerf it doesnt buff the perk. 
---
Plus I like how all the killer perks have a negative, yet BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Insidious, Nurses, Deerstalker, Whispers, Brutal Strengty, and Franklin's dont have negatives. Unless you count them having conditions and not working 100% of the time a negative. 
---
I also find it funny that MoM, DS, Self Care, Autodidact, All Exhaustion Perks, and Distortion all have negatives and many also have conditions. 
---
And balanced creating more infinites isnt a perk flaw, it's a map flaw. Other than that, all exhaustion perks are a one time use in a chase besides Adrenaline, which is a one time use all trial. And it is one of the few perks without any real downsides on survivor side.
---
Oh ok
---
almost every game this happens. i wish i clipped the billy that lunged up the stairs to the window hit me after i touched the ground. it was a second story window also omegalul.
---
the active ability button is just for additional movement features such as dodging forward with a survivor or crouching/teleporting with a killer.
---
It doesn’t mean that the other killers have passive abilities, every killer has an active ability which is his main ability. But some killers have additional features e.g. ghostface, freddy, pig. 
---
The active ability button is ctrl for killers and e for survivors by default.
---
I'd strongly consider staying at T1 for a while if I were a Myers and drew Lery's. Put on M+A and it's gg.
---
So I saw before there was a bug with dead hard and haven't used it since yesterday. But I'm noticing that I'm not getting extra bloodpoints even with offerings. Anyone else notice this?
---
Like a series instead of movies
---
My problem is that gens get done way too fast, toolboces make it go impossibly fast, but then survivors ignore it and say that gen rushing doesnt exist and say that noed is the problem and they should have to destroy totems
---
Bitch gtfo. Sometimes I’ve gone games where it’s Michael Myers + ruin and we didn’t have a chance to get any gens done and he was everywhere we couldn’t find the hex so he still won
---
My mummy will always be huntress. but still this is a really good job
---
Sure thing! Something you might try to practice is roughing out the full-body pose first, then add detail after you're happy with that. That helped me get more cohesive looking characters.
---
Happy drawing! :)
---
Volatile killer would be terrifying those guys scare the shit out of me normally.
---
Actually, they might go with Night Hunter for a crossover, since it's way crazier with the tentacle leaps and shit.
---
What do survivors say to y'all aside from "Thats Toxic" or "Thats unfair"
---
Well it's just such a meta perk and Meg has it so like, it's just surprising when she doesn't. Like a Laurie without decisive.
---
We are not talking "killer can, killer cannot" its not about killers in general, there are only 2 killers who suffer from this, and they are not in good shape right now, put your survivor issues aside
---
Or make so even when the totem is destroyed the effects persist for 20/40/60 seconds after
---
Kinda rare the true meta perks pop up at the Shrine, tbh.
---
For killers the most common meta perks are Ruin and BBQ &amp; Chili. Other than that it depends on your playstyle.
---
Same with survivors. One exhaustion perk (Sprint Burst/Balance Landing/Lithe/Dead Hard) is pretty meta. Other than that? A lot of people run Adrenaline for endgame healing/speed and Decisive Strike to counter tunneling. Beyond that Self-Care and Borrowed Time are pretty common I'd imagine. The former lets you heal without medkits and the latter is anti-camp/tunnel to bail out your teammates. 
---
Really just boils down to how you wanna play, IMO.
---
Rank 4 killers still do this shit even if they lose 3-4 gens in the meantime.
---
fact noticed and appretiated
---
holy fuck I love the billy's face XD
---
I think you can stun the nurse if you time it right
---
Legion basically doesn't work. No, it's not that their power is bad. It's that their power is worse than not using it, outside of very specific circumstances.
---
Legion activates their power to suppress the ability to see scratch marks or blood, increase their movement speed a bit, and gain the ability to vault windows and pallets faster. 
---
They can attack with a shorter cooldown during this time to apply the Deep Wound status on survivors. Deep Wound means that survivors have to heal themselves within a specific time or else they'll go down. However, the timer for this doesn't decrease when the survivor is in a chase, when they're in the killer's TR, or when they're healing themselves. Attacking a survivor who already has Deep Wound applied gives them a speed boost, and ends Legion's power instantly. Hitting one survivor who hasn't already had Deep Wound applied shows you a marker on other survivors if they're in Legion's TR.
---
When Legion's power ends, they get a five-second stun. The update they received also slowed down their vault and movement speeds significantly. Due to this, Legion, despite being a killer intended to interrupt pallet looping, is worse at dealing with pallets than other killers without a power at all.
---
I'll be honest. I hope you didn't pay for that skin, because Legion is extremely rough right now. Unless you get lucky and survivors throw themselves at you, Legion is worse than a killer that doesn't have a power at all.
---
I think you could stun spirit when she’s phasing, I did it two times
---
Could you ELI5 the shrine? Just started playing, no idea what it is
---
Put Iron Grasp on there if you really wanna go HAM.
---
Get em a hook up with Crypt TV, would help both get more popular
---
M1 killer just mean killers who mostly rely on downing survivors using normal hits instead of their ability. The basic attack is on mouse 1 (M1) on pc so it’s some lingo people use to refer to killers such as trapper or legion.
---
I know how to play, i just want killers to be all in good shape so all are fun to play and this makes their power underwhelming and is just illogical
---
Im positive they both can be stunned while using their power. I see it a lot with spirit, and im sure its been done with nurse.
---
I worded that wrong. You can instantly permanently deny 100% of their power by simply not doing a single action.
---
Most people run Enduring + Spirit Fury. That is super meta with most Billies and some Spirits.
---
He had the appropriate reaction to that lol
---
I only teabag if I'm trying to get the attention off of someone else or if someone's on the hook I'll teabag so someone else can get the person off the hook
---
They should just remove the speed boost part of NOED. That's the crutch part about it TBH.
---
Happens to me too especially in the swamp and the  game map
---
It isn't really karma when the gate is open. What do you want him to do, walk to the other end of the map so you can easily unhook and escape?
---
Honestly ruin might benefit from a rework to make it more like corrupt intervention, where it functions for the first 90/120/150 seconds of a game. That way you eliminate both extremes, including the killers who lose their star perk 10 seconds in and the survivors who never find it/find it's bugged and can't be cleansed and are placed at an enormous disadvantage because of it.
---
Freddy you can deny a large majarioy of his power by waking up, Ghostface just look at him, Plague to not clense, Trapper by just disarming traps, Hag using a flashlight on her traps,
---
where does one obtain the image for a certain... research purpose
---
i most definitely have multiple times *thunked* a nurse and spirit in their power but still get hit without them being stunned
---
Well you ready-ed up
---
Yeah! Maybe make it so that you have to cleanse a mega totem in order to release the darkness around the exit gate or something? And if you don’t it only lets one exit gate be powered
---
I love PS4 gamers coming on this sub and crying about hacks when it's literally impossible to get hacks because CFW isn't available on the latest FW. It's just a bug, calm down.
---
Why didn't they say "Bill is no longer left for dead" I mean come on, easy marketing
---
Behavior knew what they were doing when they released those schoolgirl outfits.
---
Best teeth in the game
---
things that make ya say hmmmmmmmmm
---
&gt;Wow it's almost **like us killer mains** should get over it and learn to play instead of complaining
---
Who are you fooling? I see your survivor posts.
---
Only a survivor main would say something this stupid.
---
Yes ive noticed. I havent been getting bbq and chili bonus either.
---
Oh my god! I love when stuff *arrives* to me!!!
---
&gt;They did that because enduring made DS a useless anti tunneling perk. And they did nerf it.
---
When the changes first went live and they couldn't take 2 steps if a killer had Enduring? Sure. But since they changed it? Hell no. Enduring never, never, ever, "countered" DS not unless you used Clown. It would mitigate the effect of DS and allow killer to catch up to them sooner. I remember old DS and anyone will tell you that Enduring didn't counter it. And let me stop you before you say "Unnerving Presence countered it!" Because it didn't counter it either. Hitting the skill check isn't that hard even with Unnerving Presence. 
---
&gt;Plus I like how all the killer perks have a negative, yet BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Insidious, Nurses, Deerstalker, Whispers, Brutal Strengty, and Franklin's dont have negatives. Unless you count them having conditions and not working 100% of the time a negative. 
---
Your post just highlights this disconnect with survivors and pretty much makes it impossible to have any kind of meaningful discussion regarding balance. Everything you just said for the most part was wrong. I don't think we're going to get anywhere but I'll break it down bit by bit. 
---
BBQ: survivors can hide within 40 meters in the million hiding places to avoid detection. They can hide behind gens or in lockers to avoid detection. And don't you guys have a perk that hides your aura from aura-reading perks?
---
Enduring: already mentioned it. It's one of the few exceptions to the rule. 
---
Spirit Fury: need to break 2 pallets first. In order to reap the full benefits you need to couple it with Enduring so now you get only 1 perk slot to play with after being forced to use Ruin. Plus survivors that realize you have it will just throw the pallet down.
---
Insidious: takes 2 seconds to use, honestly feels like 3 seconds. Can be difficult to find a decent hiding spot if you're camping and the devs decided to punish camping with a lack of BP and often leads to not pipping (but hey waitaminute, ranking up has no reward anyway so...).
---
Deerstalker: it has a range limit. It's not like old Freddy where you can see them anywhere. And are you really suggesting that Deerstalker is one of the best perks? Are you going to bring up Unrelenting next? 
---
Whispers gives you an idea of where they are. The radius is still big enough that survivors could hide. 
---
Brutal Strength: still too slow to break a pallet. Old Brutal Strength from a million years ago was better. Survivors are often not obligated to throw a pallet down either depending on the map RNG and what else they might have like Instant Heal.
---
Franklin's Demise: you can hit them and they can pick the item right back up as you're in the cool down of your attack and they can still put some decent distance between the two of you. Especially if they're at a loop. And to counter Franklin's, like say if they have a key, they can just drop the item and let another survivor get it. They don't even need a perk to counter Franklin's. 
---
And how often do killers run Franklin's Demise and Whispers in comparison to the number of survivors that run Dead Hard, Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, Self Care, Borrowed Time, Unbreakable, and Lithe? Do those perks have significant downsides? No they do not.
---
There are 20 ranks. Do you really believe that if you aren't good at the game you should be over halfway to the highest rank?
---
Wouldn't that be for average players, or slightly above average?
---
Left Behind apocalypse chapter confirmed
---
How I would do it is make gens need different four parts to work these parts spawn all over the map randomly and a survivor can carry one of all four parts with a small install time when they put them in what this will do is force survivers to move around the map rather than sit on a gen how the Killers kick would work is if a part isn't fully installed then when the killer kicks the gen then the part is teleported to a random location on the map
---
I get you, for context I'm rank 10 and I stay there mostly because I often let the last survivor go (call me a big softy, I like to think of it as "one to tell the tale"). I have a ton of fun with pig, especially after I leveled hag and Leatherdummy to get Ruin and BBQ.
---
Was thinking more of my Myers. I have every perk on him because BBQ was being a little bitch and I’d prefer to only devote one slot for loops as I like to use Ruin, BBQ and either Monitor or Infectious Fright.
---
A second objective would lead to killers winning nearly every match that isn't swf. This idea is not balanced whatsoever. Maybe if healing wasn't nerfed, people would still bother healing more.
---
🤣 🤣 🤣
---
Is this a left 4 dead add on???
---
That was a thing for like 2 weeks a year ago. They removed it though.
---
What's wrong with Dead Hard?
---
It’s a tragedy, but it be like that sometimes. What do you think he would do?
---
and?????
---
He camped every single person he hooked. Only way we’d get them off is Borrowed Time or flashlighting him as he went to pick them up. It was karma, he didn’t deserve a single kill as he’d just stand at the hook hitting people
---
Gee I wonder why?
---
Try to sense the sarcasm, my man.
---
Lul, you seem like a fun person
---
Go on. Tell me more.
---
I said I watched the stream. Do I need to prove that too? Lol
---
I love when that happens 😓
---
The rage quit feels appropriate
---
This is awesome. I love it
---
I'm prepared to beg for the dedicated servers
---
Mount Ormond, this map is enormous and full of safe pallets you can't do anything about. Even potato teams often win this map since it's so huge and they can literally drop every pallet. I hate this map so much I want to DC everytime I load in.  
---
But yea, Haddonfield is terrible as well.  
---
For survivors I'd say Shelter woods. Also it feels like a very lazy map, same with Rotten fields.
---
Sorry, but Hacking isn't really possible on Ps4. It's REALLY hard to actually do, but you'll probably be instantly banned by Sony. It's a glitch, not a hack.
---
so, your saying that instead of nerfing them, killers should dodge lobbies?
---
What’s the point you’re trying to get out? She has fairly high usage is what the post means
---
Thanks!
---
Irrelevant. 
---
Just because something is sometimes and problem and something else is always a problem, it doesnt change the fact that both are a problem.
---
And what about when you go to somewhere you haven't checked yet?
---
so killers should be forced to run a perk? thats just bullshit
---
All i know is i hear thunk of a stun then get hit right after and shes not stunned
---
When's shirtless myers and bunny Feng? I hope you guys ask them the real questions.
---
Wow, even they do the same thing overkill did
---
It probably won't work as intended. Some survivors would just follow the killer to get pips.
---
Sarcasm doesn't translate well over text.
---
A gen focused team can get 4 gens down in less than 3 minutes, and that's with someone being chased.
---
Teams bringing in all toolboxes, multiple BNPs, someone with Prove Thyself maybe, these are SWF dedicated to rushing the objectives.  
---
There is nothing a killer can do to make hook progression speed up aside from running Monstrous Shrine and taking someone into the basement. It effectively takes team negligence in regards to altruism, or 3 seperate hooks for each survivor to secure a kill. Generously, a great or god tier killer who isn't play nurse can probably end a chase in about 20 seconds. We're talking the top percentage of players who are having a great game against a forehead team, and just snowball.  
---
That's far from the norm. Your average chase is probably going to last at least a 30 seconds to a minute.  
---
And again, unless the survivor is making mistakes, there's nothing a killer can do when they're playing efficiently and smartly to speed up the completion of their objective, aside from using a Mori.  
---
Time is against the killer in this game. They have to make 12 hooks at maximum, in a game that can last 5 to 10 minutes. There's a reason almost every killer runs Ruin.
---
So when killers complain about survivors "gen rushing", it should be referring to survivors who have coordinated to completing their objective with every possible advantage, while the killer can be left with very little to counter it, which feels stressful, unfair, and not fun for the killer, to be pressed on time which they already have little control over, and thats why killers complain about it.  
---
It is absolutely a thing and it still happens. That's what people abusing the Wake Up! bug were doing. Rushing the generators.
---
You can pretend it doesn't happen because some idiot reported you for something that isn't even a reportable offense (unless you were abusing a bug), but you're wrong.  
---
I'm also not saying killers don't throw the term around when it doesn't apply. They do, just like survivors throw around "facecamping" and "tunneling". It's a shitty part of this game and people need to learn to seperate their ego from their gameplay and let people have fun.
---
Can you give us a new tease or hint on the next chapter please?
---
&gt;is joke
---
Please ~~don’t~~ eat my ass spirit.
---
Well git gud and stop them from doing gens or run NOED and Ruin because you need the crutch
---
I'd have loved to get stbfl because it's so satisfying but it's the best build I could get unfortunately.
---
I never really noticed it when I was leveling her for Ruin, but yeah I can see that.
---
14
---
Rule 7
---
Two mouses?
---
It’s still a risk, it would just be better
---
I see what you mean, but it becomes a double negative. You have the killers complain about gen rushing but then the survivors complain about noed. However the killers do have multiple perks that go against that such as discordance, hex ruin, surveillance I think it’s enduring I’m thinking of as well that tells you when a generator is at 85%. I am not disagreeing with you or anything. I’m just saying there are less things a survivor can do to counter many of those perks than a killer can do to protect against gen rushing. It’s a pain in the ass either way though really lol.
---
&gt;but where do you see surv main?
---
The majority of your posts are about survivors. From a Feng gameplay video to questions about how to moonwalk the killer better. 
---
&gt;Since when am I not allowed to say things because I main a side.
---
I didn’t say you were not allowed to say things because you are an “x” or “y” main. 
---
&gt; I play lost of killer infact more then I do surv.
---
That’s awesome! But if this is true, then you would be familiar with the woes that killers face when practicing a killer. When you perform poorly, survivors enjoy taking advantage to teabag you and taunt you in post-game chat. 
---
If you played killer, then you would be familiar with how this toxic attitude pushes people to play strong killers.
---
If you played killer, you would not have said:
---
&gt;learn to play instead of complaining.
---
Killers want to learn to play. They just don’t want to be teabagged and made fun of while learning. 
---
Instead of learning and practicing Clown, they will kill you with Nurse.
---
No, there’s perks like Franklins Demise and Ruin to help you with that.
---
Make it happen Behavior
---
I forgot to mention, you don't get points if you stay in the terror radius. You have to get chased.
---
If the killer doesn't have LoS on you because you're behind him, it doesn't count as a chase.
---
Bills free lol
---
The devs already know holding down M1 and playing a shitty minigame is the boring as hell. They already tried to slow the game down by reducing heal speed, all that did was push Adrenaline higher up in the meta and make survivors want to so gens MORE.
---
Directly increasing the amount of time it takes to do gens is not a solution. It's boring, and it doesn't offer any more room for skilled play.
---
Right now the problem they need to look at is poor map design that the survivors can exploit to run the killer around without much skill or counterplay. All of Haddonfield, very safe and unmindgamable pallets, several connected jungle gyms, 8 billion parts spawning on the map, very strong building tiles, etc. A big problem right now with the game is the map design, and I can't see the devs focusing on any other important gameplay aspects before fixing this first.
---
I think it might be a bug. After being hit with FF last night, I couldn't rescue other survivors on hook.
---
That longbar add on doing some work
---
it does exist, its a strat cause of how fast gen get done
---
It's 10 times worse as killer, it take like 5-10 mins to finally get into a lobby, just for some bum ass survivor who queued in unprepared and leaves bc they didn't equip something, like wtf
---
What did hope do to you? :(
---
thanks for bieng the problem
---
And honestly? If you play solo queue, there's very little chance you have enough time to cleanse all 5 totems yourself. If you do, you are genuinely wasting time on the off chance the Killer has NOED. Frankly, it's usually better to go find NOED after it procs, because then you can at least spot the hex more easily. 
---
This is why "just cleanse totems" is technically correct, but effectively useless advice to someone who plays solo queue. Only SWF can hope to efficiently do all 5. If you do it in solo queue you can never count on your teammates to do them as well.
---
NOED isn't common enough or threatening enough to justify spending the time.
---
It only works half the time for many people. You just become exhausted and nothing else happens. I've had to switch to Lithe until DH gets fixed.
---
Sorry. I'm an idiot and replied to the wrong comment. It's been a long day of work on a monday -_-
---
Please don't be rude when replying to other users.
---
Agreed.
---
stop plugging your shit here
---
I only see "Gen-Rushing" when you get something like four survivors all with purple toolboxes, socket swivels, clean rags, prove thyself, resilience, and No Mither flying through gens absurdly fast and 3 gens pop by the time the killer gets his first down.
---
If it would take you an hour to catch someone on Lery's, its not the map.
---
Entity Displeased.
---
Ah.
---
Gen Rushing isnt a thing.
---
Surprisingly I got this trophy (twice) on fractured cowshed
---
Again, what "condition" (now we're using this term to gaslight) is there for the best survivor perks?
---
Dead Hard: have to be injured which happens anyway during a chase NOT unless you're facing a one-shot killer. In which case you could just stay injured in order to use Dead Hard.
---
Self Care: infinite heals.
---
Sprint Burst: insane burst of speed when running. Can only walk BUT the vast majority of maps are small enough where it doesn't matter.
---
Lithe: vault and you get an insane burst of speed.
---
Balanced Landing: fall from a decent height (not even two stories mind you) and get another insane burst of speed. Not really "conditional" not unless the map is Lery's. 
---
Adrenaline: once all gens are completed, get healed, can pick yourself up when downed, and receive a massive burst of speed AND if you've been hooked and get un-hooked after gens are done you still get Adrenaline. 
---
Borrowed Time: guy on the hook gets away for free, can be difficult to down hook rusher not unless you use a one shot killer. 
---
Unbreakable: a little more situational, I give you that, but completely counters slugging as a strategy.
---
&gt; And I've been rank 1 killer
---
I don't believe you. What you're saying makes no sense at all and it just comes off as mental gymnastics. 
---
&gt;I hope you realize that you're just bad st the game soon
---
And now you go for this petty "Well, you say this because you're just bad!" Argument. Doesn't matter what I say, you'll just continue to gaslight and live in your own reality. Doesn't matter that I hit rank 1 with the revamped Freddy. You bring up this utter nonsense "It's called EXHAUSTION. do I need to spell it out for you?" And again, WHAT. IS. THE. DOWNSIDE? 
---
If a guy uses Dead Hard and that guaranteed he made it to a safe pallet that let him get away where it's now impossible to get this guy because now -because of Dead Hard- they made it to another loop or made it to the Hatch/Gate? Where is the downside? Do you get penalized in any possible way? 
---
Let me hit you up with this: imagine if BBQ could show me the aura of every player on the map no matter where they are, no matter how close they are to a hook, wherever they're hiding, and it counters any kind of perk that counters aura-reading perks. And ask me "Well, where's the downside to BBQ?" And I say "It's conditional. I have to hook someone first." 
---
That's what you're doing whether you realize it or not that is exactly what you're doing.
---
I had one DC because I found her just after the game started. So because she had a stroke of bad luck, none of us will get to enjoy the game
---
To the bubba bone
---
Something tells me OP wants R20 survivors in a red ranks environment.
---
God damn, son—putting in work!
---
Yes I do it’s @austinmesler on insta and Twitter I’m also on YouTube www.youtube.com/asseenbyaustin
---
Me today.
---
For some reason I've gotten more devour hope kills with Clown than anyone else
---
This is less the fault of OP or Survivors and more an issue with the game design. You're correct, doing secondary objectives draws out the game and earns you more BP, but because it contributes little to nothing to the primary objective, it becomes a low priority. When you're up against a Killer who's putting down serious pressure, there is no time to do secondary objectives without being a bad teammate. 
---
Bloodpoints alone aren't enough of an incentive if the action barely contributes to the game. If you're not on a gen, running the Killer, saving a teammate, or healing a teammate, you're making it that much less likely that you'll escape. This is what OP means by time efficiency, and why the point system does such a poor job reflecting skill. BHVR has always struggled to effectively measure and reward what it is that contributes to a successful match. Instead we have a point system that rewards you for completing a checklist of actions that may or may not be in the best interest of your team. Either secondary objectives need to have more of an impact, or things like keeping the Killer busy or being a reliable gen jockey need to be rewarded better. 
---
The point system and the actual game proper seem to be at odds with each other. I'd like to see dull totems worked in to more Killer perks as a way of making them relevant. Right now the biggest reason to cleanse them is the *chance* of NOED, and that simply isn't enough. If more Killer perks were powered by number of dulls, or procced similarly to NOED, then Survivors would have better reason to proactively cleanse them vs. re-actively.
---
I miss him ;( R.I.P
---
I have another one where I blinded him from like 50 feet away from running across the map. Been getting super lucky with clutch moments lately. ☺️
---
This is why my queue times take forever, POS like you who can’t stand the idea that my shroud of separation could possibly be a mori and quit.
---
i dont agree, ruin can be destroyed, each person can do thier own gen with discordance, tinkerer is almost usless cause 99% of the time the gen is done, suveillance is a good perk but is really limited
---
Flashlight spam and tea-bagging can be good psychological warfare tactics tho, exploiting one of the biggest advantage of survivors : They're 4 vs 1 killer. It can be intimidating to be facing 4 brains alone.
---
Even if the killer doesn't fall for the bait, one or more survivors acting very cocky can quickly attack his self-confidence, pushing him to make mistakes.
---
I'm not denying the fact that teabag is toxic btw, I hate it too, I'm just discussing its potential uses outside of just being an asshole.
---
You can get them from a sub-reddit called /r/PerkByDaylight
---
hmm, i don’t know, maybe because it’s written by 12 year olds with no game design knowledge?
---
Odd flex but ok
---
franklins doesnt do much cause they can go pick it back up and if i hit 1 survivor there are still 3 more
---
We got them.
---
Wierd flex but ok
---
Hi, I’d like to add you. PSN name is juicycherub and I’m rank 11!
---
no killer.......??
---
I am prepared to get Trapper fixed whether they want him to be or not.
---
ive legit never heard of insidious camping a box, that is a cancer on another level lol
---
Yeah, there's generally enough time to get away. If you're doing a gen you should always be aware of at least 2 escape options around you.
---
Fair enough!, lol any perks for Frank West ?
---
If you hate it so much bring NOED. I dislike using the perk and refuse to use it on Nurse (Who I am potato at) explicitly to avoid bad habits, (I only use it on Wraith and LF because they're weak as shit, or the classic NOED + Remember Me + Fire Up + Blood Warden endgame build) but it is technically a "Counter" to gens being done too quickly.
---
no idea
---
This sounds exactly like a game i played a few days ago, however I was the killer and ended up wiping them without noed. I did chase this one girl for what seemed forever and eventually caught up and during that time 0 gens were done. Post chat was funny.
---
Im debating what this comment was intending to convey...
---
I think this is more due to the killer being bad than anything else. There is no reason why that blind should have worked.
---
&gt;80 seconds per gen is long enough;
---
It really isn't. 
---
 if you’re struggling to find survivors or ending chases in a timely manner, you either need to re-evaluate your perk load-out or your chasing habits.
---
I like that there's an assumption made (really just a passive aggressive way of insulting me because you don't like what I'm saying) that if I make balance suggestions that I must be bad at the game. No mention whatsoever that the balance is a known issue. No acknowledgement whatsoever (that I made in the OP post) that killers need Ruin and Ruin is easily countered. No acknowledgement whatsoever of there being a problem, it must be, I have to be quiet and survivors are perfectly balanced and never do anything wrong ever and behave like perfect little angels.
---
I see what you mean, and again I’m not trying to defend either side really. I’m just saying you came saying survivors deny gen rushing but complain about NOED. Then you complain about gen rushing but deny any issues with NOED lol. Well complain isn’t really the word I’d use.....make a point rather. But I agree with you, there is not really anything that can be done about NOED. I play as a survivor and if we get hit by it, it’s out own fault for not doing totems. I always do totems when I see them
---
Him = Freddy
---
Fuzzy Lumpkins = Leatherface
---
Sedusa = Spirit
---
Rowdypuff Boys = Legion
---
I personally haven’t done it, but I hear it’s the best way to induce a salt deluge, next to basement Insidious LF.
---
If every time someone uses dead hard they reach a fake pallet  you ARE bad. And do you want a rank 1 certificate or something? And conditions are downfalls. A condition means something that needs to be done to make something useable. Self care doesnt have a condition, but it has a debuff. Where as spirit fury doesnt have a debuff, it just has a condition. 
---
Conditions dont change the value of a perk, they just make it viable. Debuffs are what weaken a perk. I've been studying game development for over 6 years and am designing my first game at the moment. I may not work in a company, but I feel like I know more about balancing and conditions than a salty killer main on dead by daylight

The thing is, you can literally just switch killer and survivor and the meme would be just as relevant lmao

If I didn’t stop shining it for that split second I would’ve been off timing. The killer was good actually he somehow killed two of them after that. They kinda scattered like cockroaches minus me and the other guy

1st. i never asjed if your a killer main
---
2nd. im not on a high horse im stating a problem i am having with the game, not saying im better
---
3rd. i never said its toxic i just believe it needs to be balanced
---
4th. i dont like bieng stuck to a couple killers cause that is no fun
---
5th. thats funny that you tell people to stop whining like a bitch, specially since you believe that the spirit needs to be nerfed vefore the nurse cause people know how to use her

i dont believe killers should be forced to run a perk, i want a balance, not a solution thats "run this every game so it last longer than 5 mins"

Agreed. The primary reason I’m working on them is because my goal with customs is mainly to focus on works that have absolutely no chance of being adapted for sets. As other customizers have taught me, if they aren’t gonna do it, the fans will. Stranger Things is a surprise though, so maybe they’re slowly working on getting rid of that family image.
