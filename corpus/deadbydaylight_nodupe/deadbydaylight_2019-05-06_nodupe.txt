With freddy picking up a survivor he will be facing forward in the direction of the survivors butt.
---
---
---
They should make it function like the icon. Allow you to carry slugged survivors to safe spots/exits, like a killer, at a speed penalty.
---
Only freddy?
---
He’s pretty good he’ll be annoying at first, but with practice he’ll get better!
---
Well, all of them, but you have to rely on this for freddy cuz he’s invisible
---
Oh, I understand how teachable perks work. I have all of them unlocked except Lightborn and Tinkerer, in fact. I just apparently have the worst luck when it comes to bloodwebs, is what I'm saying.
---
I’ve been getting a SHIT ton of toxic doctors who message you just to insult you and a bunch of campy Myers. 
---

---
Stopped playing survivor for a bit today and started just playing killer and giving people the hatch after toying with them and moonwalking and shit like that to try to bring my mood up because I was just getting so annoyed. That’s what I like about killer- you can set the tone of the match. I like to be playful and i toy with the last survivor a lot and do stupid shit, it’s a whole lot more fun. If you don’t play killer, I’d recommend doing so especially if you’re getting pissed playing survivor. Most of the times at least one of the survivors will cooperate when you try to be nice and fuck around. Made more friends through killer than I have through survivor lmao
---
There's a myers in my region that's p3 and fucking destroys me all the time. So he made me a fanboy and gave me the impression that nyer is maybe OP.
---
It’s probably because everyone wants to make the most of the bloodhunt and killers tend to make more for your effort.  So more killers waiting around.
---
Really? I think Meg's portrait looks even worse than her model. Her face resembles a badly eroded cliff.
---
But the worst part to me is her expression, it looks like she's trying really hard to think and she just can't do it.
---
&gt; Now the game has been alive and out for 6 years
---
...I thought it was 3?
---
But yeah I feel you. You get hatemail for the dumbest things while trying to play nice as killer, and then you go out of your way to be a dick after the hatemail and get nothing. It's really weird.
---
I disagree with splitting the playerbase. We're no Fortnite/CoD/Apex/Destiny/Overwatch, there aren't enough people for that. It'd be cool if you could just outright hide your profile on all platforms though without having to set it to private/offline. Kinda like streamer mode on Apex.
---
I've deranked 4 times since the event started :(
---
Great...they saw Zubat do it now everyone think it's funny.
---
I agree every survivor double pips and escapes every game. Completely normal.
---
I deal with toxicity by either replying in a sarcastic manenr or saying random funny gibberish
---
The salt is also funny to read
---
Stuff like this has me wonder how stupid human beings can be
---
I lost hard as trapper, after 3 min 3 gens done (no hex ruin yet) so i decided to show them i want to farm since i accepted my defeat. They realized it and farmed with me. And in the end 1 guy even let himself go on the hook to give me a kill. I love you for showing me the nice side of this community &lt;3
---
About 20$ I made the design real quick in my photoshop knockoff program and emailed it to them. 
---
Nothing hurts more than seeing the survivors self care across the map and decide to sprint towards you when you got a seconds left on the hook...
---
So you have one game you base that theory on?
---
There's been a few instances of survivors I picked up then the last gen went off. I drop them to see if they have adren and smack them back down if they do.
---
I agree
---
I actually had a few really nice games this bloodpoint weekend - fair games at worst, and some killers that would farm after a DC at best. No facecampers, toxic builds, or tunnelers to be seen. The only bad game I had was when I got hooked and my whole team danced around the same chest instead of saving me so I just killed myself when I hit phase 2.
---
Considering all previous bloodpoints events have been maelstroms of toxicity, it's kinda scary to not dread every match I go into
---
&gt;you really think I care what the devs think?
---
You'd care if their opinion happened to agree with whatever goes on in that small mind of yours. Survivors say hitboxes are a problem, the devs say hitboxes are a problem, I've given you proof, and your ignorance is so unimaginably high that it all goes right over your head.
---
Don’t forget about all the other stuff. If you haven’t watched paulie esthers videos on scream I would suggest you do ...there’s 2 of them made within the past few weeks and each one has so much evidence to ghostface coming to dbd that you’d have to be insane to disagree with I honestly think there’s going to be a scream chapter
---
I mean...THE PLAGUE!
---
My only worry is not being able to heal as last survivor.
---
I wish that were true.
---
I'm assuming that is for the Galaxy S10+? If so solid phone my dude!
---
Being a dick in an online game isn’t cyber bullying lmao.
---
They have to make it work, as if someone's internet dies, they shouldn't be punished for it.
---
Funny you say that, because as someone who mostly played survivor in the past? Survivor is frustrating and unfun now. 
---
Killer is a blast.
---
I play killer all the time, everything survivors can do to be toxic in game just makes them easier to catch
---
Yup
---
Would have been clean af if you lived. Good job anyways.
---
Thanks for posting this
---
Apparently (and what I've found for myself) Billy is much easier to steer using Q E instead of the mouse.
---
He feels kind of like a spooky Leatherface. Almost no gen pressure, but is capable of getting one hit downs in his base kit, and a reduced terror radius. I love him, but his lack of gen pressure does hurt sometimes, especially in the really high ranks
---
While you can just run to a loop with both Mike and Wraith, it's much harder to know when they're coming(unless in an open field), as they don't have the whole "alarm" to them.  
---
He might be short and have a deceptively long lunge, but that could be said about Pig and Hag, which Pig is a really bad killer due to her ability being RNG reliant and her crouch being not that great, similar to Freddy.  
---
The whole stall of his is RNG reliant, similar to a certain killer I mentioned, which makes him inconsistent.  
---
The transition time mindgame seems really nice, but a real bother to learn when you have access to much better killers that take less time to "learn".  
---
If I'd have to pick between him and Wraith - the most similar killer(in my opinion), I'd take Wraith 100% of the time, as he gains a much bigger benefit from being cloacked - getting a movement speed and the windstorm lunge.  
---
I would still say Freddy is in a low position even within the lower-tier killers.
---
That guy looks like Ash.
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you. I'm beyond sick of this toxicity, as much as I love this game. I think a casual and ranked mode would work. It would be like Overwatch's quickplay and competitive modes. People can have less stressful games that way maybe. Perhaps Behavior could add some form of endorsement system that gives rewards as well? I often give props to both killers &amp; survivors, yet I feel it does nothing.
---
As for the toxicity, you can't win against it regardless of who and how you play. I'm always nice even though I suck, get picked on, and often get frustrated at times as a killer. I'm quite often found first while being unable to lead a chase to save my life as survivor. (Pun intended) However I still try my best so that everyone else can have a decent game. This event has been horrid for me as a survivor. I personally have more stress playing survivor than I do killer. 
---
In the end, I honestly think most people forget that we all play games just to have fun and escape reality. People have fun in various ways, whether if it's a competitive or a casual mindset. I just don't see the appeal of ruining othet players' moods for your their benefit. I want people to have fun even if I am miserable.
---
 "The best way to avoid disappointment is to not expect anything from anyone." I take this quote to heart. I'm glaf you made this thread, and I loom forward to seeing others' thoughts.
---
Farming isn't bannable. It's a gameplay option. Just like camping, tunneling, or sitting in the corner doing nothing. It may be unpleasant, but it's in the game for a reason, and it happens.
---
The only sad part is ... she wasn't your 4 stack of BBQ.
---
Jeff actually looks wholesome, like he's been caught with a spontaneous camera but he's kind of shy about it.
---
The others, though...
---
I’ll follow these rules, hopefully I can get overtime soon..
---
True! What do you reckon the killer sounds are for though?
---
I think you mean to say that you do not find playing killer fun
---
What the fuck am I watching?!
---
I prefer the Shirtless David meme.
---
No. Next time you get post game check the report function. I forgot what tab it was under but clear as day it says “farming.” Like I said, if everyone is farming, it’s fine and you can’t be banned, otherwise it is considered an offense.
---
That's my favorite move as Myers.
---
*Survivors get 3 gens easy.*
---
*I hit T3 and suddenly no generators get completed for the rest of the match.*
---
Doctor mains rise up!
---
Aww look at the little baby noed gamer getting rewarded for being bad
---
Crows are better than bloodstains. If you focus on the horizon and for crow bombs you can always see a crow flying where a survivor used to be/is. Crows are great and I get a bunch of haccusations when I find people with them. Survivors don’t pay attention to crows because people don’t use them often. Seeing a crow fly could change a 2 man to a 4K.
---
Just because you can report smth doesn't mean it's bannable. Imagine if every camping or tunneling killer actually got banned lol
---
that throw up did not even look like it hit you lol
---
#AllHeightsMatter
---
This is bullshit. It's 2019 and servers haven't been implemented  yet. Come on.
---
Camping and tunneling aren’t an offense. These could only be an offense if you target one person over multiple rounds I.e. stream sniping.
---
As killer you aren't obligated to farm if you don't want to..
---
Currently rank 3 killer on ps4. It I know I have my pip and my 28k+ and there is one person left. When I pick you up if you don’t struggle you get the hatch. If you struggle you die.
---
I get it - why this game allows totems to spawn right next to survivors baffles me
---
The name only amplifies your cursed power
---
So... a worse Hillbilly?
---
*flare doesn't check out*
---
Hahaha you’re so funny, I said a good game for a survivor not a normal game. I generally only pip once and escape about half the time, this is a normal game that me and my friends have. A good game is a game where we all escape and get 2 pips. And a great game imo is when we get the killer to dc
---
Still need a 1 mil though.
---
I never notice them as survivor but after this post I do! Thanks
---
A new killer means new content, while a new survivor means a new skin and some perks(very few that change the meta).
---
It's legit not possible for every survivor to 2 pip. At least at the ranks I play at.
---
Taking hits for someone gets you some good BP's, and counts towards WGLF. People who don't play survivor don't seem to know that. 
---
Wait near the gate, and when you're injured pal comes along, get between them and the killer. Take the hit, get some extra BP's, and a new friend for life.
---
But the killer will haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate you for it. 
---
Killers get pissed when you bodyblock a hit, but have no qualms blocking doors or getting free hits if they corner you somehow.
---
MoM intensifies
---
Wow that small huh?
---
geez seeing them all 3 grouped up like that gave me flashbacks to when michael first came out and the rate at which you gained evil within was tied to how many survivors you were stalking at a time
---
Hey everybody, it's me. The Guy on the Penny.
---
This game.....I swear.
---
Aww look at the little baby survivor not cleansing totems
---
BBQ is the best killer perk.  
---
It gives you so much information about where survivors are and bonus bloodpoints at the end of the match.  
---
A good killer won't need NOED, since they usually don't get to the end stages of the game.
---
Oof big oof
---
Where are you and how can I give you head for this wonderful tumor you gave me by watching this gem.
---
If you’re a guy idk bout all that mane but u gotta say no homo
---
#NoHomo have a bloody party streamer on me.
---
So ur just showing off abs huh
---
&gt;Survivors take games hostage. They tease killers and get mad if they die. They are a team until 'their' fun is being spoiled.
---
If you kill them in the exit gate and they are just far enough away from victory to grab them, they get really mad. Sorry your obviously bad decision ended up with a fairly likely consequence.
---
*YEA PAL IMA STOP YOU THERE*
---
Is it me or does this resemble gravity falls
---
Yeah thats pretty good too. The way they just put that on the shrine lol. Since then every killer has BBQ.
---
Yea, one time I was killer and saw the obsession (I had no obsession perks) so I thought maybe MoM or DS but he didn't have any of those perks. Next guy I find has MoM along with another guy having DS... once the game ended I checked the original obsessions perks and he didn't have any
---
"survivors will get mad for getting hit through pallets"
---
\- That's probably because you're not suppose to get hit *through* pallets. You see, when you're on the other side, you are supposed to be safe. Wheres blocking a hit counts as BP for protection. One is a glitch, the other is *supposed* to be in the game. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"gen rush"  
---
You mean: *doing their job*.  
---
Survivors are *supposed* to do gens. They aren't there to stroll about the map all day.   
---
"I play both killer and survivor"  
---
Ok? Do you want a cookie or something for that?  
---
The rest of your post has nothing to do with the original topic and contributes zilch to the conversation. We're talking about teamwork and bodyblocking, specifically things that make killers accuse you of being SWF, and especially things they're hypocrites about. You're just... bringing up people who "sit in corners".
---
C r y I n g
---
👀 
---
I’m sorry did you say something?
---
Bill be like :\^J
---
I play super casually but have never had these issues. Sometimes there's some salt in the chat but noone goes to my steam profile or anything.
---
Wheeeee
---
I thought exactly the same
---
Yeah I see this bug is making a comeback, had it the other day but nobody else in the game could see it. Weird.
---
nope 100%
---
Absolutely!
---
That was supposed to say banana
---
Might as well hook my progress lol
---
of course noed activates after cleansing 4 totems...there are 5
---
Jeff looks untouched tbh
---
jup, sucks but thats how it is :(
---
Honestly, I've even kinda of come to dread new killer as much as be excited by them. I've hated something about every new killer since Freddy. Some more than others, but I don't think any of the killers have been a ''Oh well this will be fun." for a while.
---
Not saying they've all been overpowered, but they've all had their annoying parts to go up against.
---
I love killer though? It's way more fun than survivor.
---
[removed]
---
Are the two on the right top row Unmasked Micheal and Nurse?
---
Is just all the player models supersized to fuck, they can't fit in the play area and so are crushed and distorted beyond recognition. When I got this bug I could clearly see things like a Claudette's hair in the sky, and a fucked up billy with my Alert.
---
I just went from "fuck Legion I hate them" to "fuck Legion".
---
Is this just a normal anime school girl with the paint bucket tool
---
I like playing against Dead Hard. It's a fun, skill based evasion. I despise MoM, which is overpowered, boring bullshit.
---
&gt;It's not me, it is "minus10degreescelsius" I met. You can find her on Instagram/Twitter/FB. :)
---
This is really Adam
---
Oh yeah good point lol.  I think I did only a few matches with him.  Never really enjoyed the majority of them though.
---
If I was in that lobby at the time I’d have said
---
“Look man, it’s not the crutch it used to be, you can lay off a bit.”
---
Sexually explicit what now?
---
Yep
---
Oh ok. Alright. Thanks for clarifying that.
---
They probably just dont wanna play that specific map or keep getting that map or whatever, either way, anytime someone DC's I report em.
---
He's mid tier at best, he snowballs hard though if a team is grouped up and he can down them
---
Sadly, the least toxic survivor I had was one who commented gg and said my addons were good.          Worst match was someone who I invited to a party and won’t stop saying “big gay” and baby killer and stuff.
---
Showing dominance over the tree? Impressive
---
So what you replace it with then to NOT make myers tier 3 garbage?
---
Nailed it
---
Will do, thanks!
---
Aka: the 4th way to escape a trail
---
I'm fine with body block, it just means one more person closer to dying state. Please keep doing it.
---
How do you do this?
---
unfortunately devs made his entire power revolve around eventually having a one shot so removing it would require an entire rework. doesnt matter tho bc they won't change it
---
Where's my boy, Quentin?
---
They had us in the first half not going to lie
---
Yesss, indeed. One could say this combination was orgasmic at the best of times.
---
^(I was a dirty user of machine gun perk combo)
---
Got em
---
Okay so that is a lot to digest so I’m gonna break everything you gave me piece by piece. I also want to tldr most of what you’ve posted by saying 99% of all killer perks and abilities have counterplay. 
---
&gt;BBQ isn't just for blood points, it's a wall hack perk and needs to be nerfed or removed. Most of the time killers win games due strictly to that perk alone
---
BBQ is strong and picked for both of its sides of usage. Nerfed? Not at all. Removed? With how expensive killer addons and bloodwebs can be combined to, lord no. The key part of this is that bbq has lots of area for counterplay. Either getting closer to the area, lockers, doubling back, or Distortion. Distortion is truthfully amazing because it ties into being a strong check to many commonly used aura reading perks. 
---
Also with Nurses the counterplay there is in either not healing in the killer’s terror radius (for few killers or very niche perks this is different but I don’t want to go into that because those are far reaching outliers), having Distortion again like before or healing where it’s safe versus where you would be caught out. What’s odd is you call it a free hook perk but realistically you should only get fooled by Nurses once before you register that healing in the terror radius is a bad thing. 
---
&gt;If survivors can't get to a closet fast enough before another survivor gets hooked, they're now exposed and it's basically a free hook for a killer. 
---
Now that is a lot of hoopla. While being revealed by bbq is something that counters stealth, this is all dependent on the killer’s mobility and ability. While someone like Hillbilly can definitely make more than intended use out of it or Nurse implying the target hasn’t left the area, most killers only use that brief moment to assume an area. The getting found part is also on the survivor too. 
---
&gt;Whispers etc....
---
This may have been true before there were actually decent perks for tracking, but compared to anything else in the game, Whispers is terrible. Taking Whispers is, in this current perk filled meta, a wasted slot. The only good use it has is telling you where you *shouldn’t* look or patrol. And even then that’s just game knowledge you as a player learn to get around. Whispers is part of the 1% of killer perks that has no counterplay other than ‘don’t be somewhere on the map 4head’ so I’ll humor that bit. 
---
&gt;Self-Care etc. 
---
Despite how you feel about SC, it’s still one of the most picked perks among survivors because even if it were slower, the ability to heal yourself under all conditions (barring madness Tier 3) is useful no matter what. People aren’t altruistic enough, which is why the perk continues to be chosen. Even with all of the other perks centered around rewarding healing or finding others to heal you (Bond, Empathy, Autodidact, Leader, We’ll Make It, Pharmacy and even Aftercare) people would rather heal themselves. Why do people still take SC even after its nerf? Can’t ask me. Especially with how common Sloppy Butcher is, you wont find me in the map corner using self care for 45 seconds. 
---
Everything else you’ve written towards the end relates back to Bbq so I won’t have to retouch that base. 
---
Let me close out with this: Look back at the where the game was before in its early stages and see how glaringly imbalanced a lot of survivor perks were. Certain interactions were just overturned to give the survivors too much safety. The overabundant pallets, the lack of bloodlust or entity blocking, being unable to kick generators, slower vaulting, that We’ll Make It And Self Care combo, permanent saboteur on hooks and Trapper traps, Instant flashlights, stupid early pallet hit boxes, pallet vacuums and vault vacuums too, like the balance of the game is clearly Better than before, I mean the data is right there.
---
 Survivor gameplay is way more expansive and people taking the same 4-5 perks is a product of using what’s the most powerful for the current gamestate. 
---
Killer gameplay has finally grown to be more diverse and taking the same 4-5 perks is a result of the game not solving any root issues with generator completion speed, stale chase mechanics and the fact that the most powerful killer is only that way because she has 90% of the chase potential where survivors against most of the rest of the roster have that amount.
---
Same but I'm finding that not worrying about my rank makes me feel a little better and enjoy the game a bit more
---
This is horrifying hahaha
---
Honestly I've just started pressing search lobby and alt tabbing to play gungeon until I hear the scream
---
The rainbow map cannot track the killer, but it can track their BELONGINGS, i.e. hag and trapper traps. The dull key and skeleton key both allow you to open the hatch, but the skeleton key is best suited for the Blood Amber add-on, which allows you to indeed track the killer. Also, the black lock and dark lock are the same thing. Any other questions?
---
Have you ever heard...of the Iridescent King's head? Did I ever tell you the definition...of torment?
---
If your Shadow Dragon handle is from Fire Emblem then yes you get an upvote.
---
That you used a yellow mori with a very rare and ultra rare add ons
---
Billy is definitely a higher learning curve killer. Not as hard as the Nurse but considering you have to learn the turning and how to apply the map pressure that makes his power so useful he can definitely be difficult! (Fellow Xbox player as well)
---
Oh wait I do have a question, is black lock only hatch? Or are there other black locks?
---
it's a purple rarity so you won't get it a ton but you'll get a fair bit of em
---
So far, only the hatch.
---
Wait is that her actual voice actress or did you record yourself in your drunken state? lmao
---
You know what. At least farming games are much more less toxic than sweaty killers with tryhard build and red mori during double blood point.
---
Well I only had 1 red Mori, and 2 green Moris, and I have like 7 yellow Mori’s with pig so until I get more Moris, the only one I’ll be using for her is yellow
---
I mean *go*, *go aaallllllllll out*
---
Who’s sweater is that?
---
Bruhuff, puff
---
r/deadbygay
---
Salty survivor has done been in this exact scenario too many times. End game collapse will fix that though. ;)
---
ok so imma need that reaction pic plz
---
Unless I get more than 5 red Moris which probably won’t be happen for a LOOOOOONG time, I’m not laying a finger on them
---
I does, noed is for shit killers that need to be babied into getting kills
---
Why would you throw away a 4K
---
It's not great. Never use it on a dull key. The startup for the cast can almost break it entirely. It's really nice against some killers or for some builds, but in all honesty, it's not too great. The range it reads is the exact range for the heartbeat anyway, so unless you just really need the directional heads up, it's not worth it. The tokens are better, since they work a lot like Bond, and you can use the skeleton key longer. The main difference for the keys is the dull key is DESIGNED to open the hatch and that alone, with only 5 seconds of usage, whereas the skeleton key has far more time for usage with the token, pearl and amber.
---
Start playing nurse for a long time and she is god or if ur on console billy or leather face is noice
---
This is what I get every time. Literally every time.
---
&gt;It either forces survivors to waste time cleansing totems
---
Or you can put on literally any other perk and still get that benefit? Noed doesn't give any indicator, so it's not like they won't be doing totems if you decide not to use it.
---
This is why i pay the internet, thank you.
---
Or sacrificial ward if you have one red mori but a lot of red add ons
---
Dull key hatch, skeleton key recon. Got it. Thank you, I appreciate the help
---
TBH some exposed are kind of balanced (Devour Hope since it can just be destroyed) while others give no counterplay (like NOED) and you feel shitty for it being 0 skill. Chainsaws are basically exposed for free, with unlimited tries
---
Yes.
---
Or maybe the survivor could just leave instead of waiting for the disrespect at the exit gate? He had plenty of time so he kinda deserved it. You know how he could have countered it? He could cleanse totems
---
Welcome to Reddit. Once you get downvoted, it will never come back since ppl don’t even try to get to the point lolz
---
No problem at all. Any other questions about items?
---
Absolutely nothing!
---
You know how to not need noed? Get fucking good
---
Yeah, can't wait for the patch to go live, tired of swf in higher ranks sitting in the gates
---
I
---
Ew that's what her vomit looks like? I still haven't played against the plague. So gross!
---
r/DBDGoneGay
---
noed can also be destroyed. all forms of exposed are total bullshit. from your name im assuming youre familiar with dark souls. the exposed status effect is the same thing as dark bead in my opinion. yeah there's ways to avoid it. but that doesnt mean it's not still stupidly powerful
---
dont even get my started on fuckin chainsaws man
---
The way you described the RBT hurts me on so many levels as a SAW fan and pig main
---
And auric cells.
---
I would say Jeff, Tapp, Bill and Jake all look kinda nice tbh
---
Me too. I play both sides, I won't sit at gates cause I've gotten so many people just mere pixels from escape and I won't do that to myself. Not to mention how annoying it is as killer when they're doing this at both gates and the hatch. Lol
---
With NOED..
---
GOLD. PERFECTION.
---
Does it matter? Lol!
---
Jesus Christ you're more salty than the Pacific. Not sure if you can read, but I said the reason I had noed on was because it's a swf group. You think I would be in red ranks if I had to rely on noed every game?
---
r/TIHI
---
This is one of the greatest things I’ve seen today.
---
Probably, console is a joke
---
Found one of the survivors
---
Adrenaline is FINE, same as NOED - toxicity on both side.
---
Except Feng, she looks so much better than her portrait
---
And Feng
---
Damn you're ignorant
---
Yes officer, this post right here. 
---
Nah but I'm in pain from laughing so much
---
Well thats her vomit if she drinks from an infected fountain and gets damage rather than just green vomit that will give you the plague and once you fully have it you enter broken, either way if you thinks that's gross you should see her mori
---
It's not a glitch it's lag. The only you can do is adapt and drop it earlier. Idk about you but my lag is worse than whatever is listed on ping. 100ms of lag feels more like 300ms.
---
600 hours on xbox, compared to PC it's a joke
---
I didn’t repost it :(
---
NOED is just a dumb perk for baby killers, I main both, but I'm better with killer, and if you want a perk like NOED, just run Devour Hope, it rewards you for more and you actually earn it. NOED rewards you for doing bad in a round, and that kinda makes me feel sick when I see it
---
I like how close dead by daylight is to the evil dead sequel title. Which was evil dead 2: dead by dawn
---
Jeff
---
It was like, one of the first perks in the game.
---
Legion is just ok. He can still be looped if someone's already in Deep Wound/he doesn't have his power charged up. Spirit is good. I would recommend Spirit because she doesn't get looped, but since you want a normal speed killer, I'd say Clown. Not particularly fun, but that answers your question.
---
Oh boy she sounds like so much fun! lol
---
Thank you, Michael. Very cool.
---
Is that the creeper? If it is I really wish the owner would sell the ip so something can be done with him and it wont be attached to so much stigma.
---
"Isnt that Tom cruise?" *neck cracking noises*
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Cries in Freddy and Pig
---
He probably doesn't get a lot of kills, so he was really excited at the chance to get one. Run Mettle if you can
---
Doesn't work?
---
I second that can you say it out louder for the people in the back
---
Nah, cuz I know it’s basically prenerf ds and it can be very annoying to fight, I’m just trying to get back to rank 1 so I see less of this
---
idk honestly, the more farming games i get in a row, the less likely i am to play them.
---
You did not just say millions and millions of players. Do you mean millions of games? If not, you are sorely mistaken.
---
So that's how you spell zilch. Thank you for finally helping me figure out how that damn words written
---
Please get help or find an irl hobby. Knitting, painting, photography, something to get you out of your head and to help you focus on something else. This isn't healthy for you, and it's not fair to others who deal with your unwarranted threats or wishes.

5 c
---
No now shut up with the stupid ideas
---
I need this inside of me
---
Yes, and it's the best part about getting put onto the hook, lol
---
But seriously, the clown has them for his belly too
---
I thought this was an in general post about every video game and didn’t even see it was a DBD post. My 1st thought was “ha that’s like DBD”
---
I KNEW THAT BUT ***JIGGLE PHYSICS ON KATE***
---
Still doesn't fix your stupidity. Went through your profile, and found out you're homophobic and maybe racist, that might explain your unreasoned rage/salt
---
I just hope for a new map...
---
Oof sorry just a concept
---
This is the kind of content I come here for. I’m gonna need a HQ screen grab of Britney with the plagues mask on sent to me ASAP. I will use it for my profile image everywhere. Perfection.

I don’t think I ever used it actually. I mained Freddy when I was Killer. I’m not even sure if I ever got it.
---
That dance thoooooo lol
---
Am I the only one who would rather kill him/be killed and move onto a new match?
---
Seriously when this stuff happens, just kill me.  Who wants to do 5 gens by themselves while the killer sits there bored?
---
Just end it and get into a new match
---
I had shit perks on my legion for the longest time so I just ran toth without any other hexes, but the amount of times survivors just threw themselves at the totem without even knowing what it is made it more than worth it
---
Oh I swear it happens on a regular basis for me lol has me wanting to die a little everytime
---
I play nurse and I can never get a good ranking cuz of chases
---
V
---
I should have screenshotted it but I was a lil heated at the time and decided to just get ready for bed
---
Why understand or attempt to rebuke when you can click blue arrow?
---
The entity knew damn well what it was doing
---
Jeff?
---
I disagree strongly
---
It's implied this has happened to Vigo already, but there's nothing concrete. Now, Bill, on the other hand...
---
With this title I was expecting some God tier survivor play. This is basic as fuck. I find it extremely poor taste to post this. The killer was on your screen for like 30 seconds.
---
Don’t waste your time watching this video. It’s 11 minutes of him doing gens.
---
This is a reddit of cursed images
---
Because sometimes it feels nice to show mercy if you feel they played well. I've had the oposite happen too. This survivor gave me a kill since they were honestly getting the better of me and I only had 1k. It's pretty much a sign of good sportsmanship.
---
with the new pip system I hate when this shit happens and then I get punished for it be deranking. mercy is nice, I’d like to at least come out even so I don’t have to work twice as hard to get back to where I was.
---
Was literally chased for a solid 3 minutes. Please tell me how this is poor taste? It's not enough to not like something but you have to comment and make a big deal about it? Iridescent in every category solo.
---
no pls ;-;
---
That 6 and 9 are separated by that 0 how sad.
---
Based on the length of the bars, it seems the rank 2 is the one shit talking? Imagine being 7 ranks ahead of someone and talking shit to them...
---
Thank you, I’d really like to see it happen
---
You just said that killers have no problems bodyblocking in corners. Your kinda incorrect.
---
Some kind of psychological stuff. The more they see up or down vote, they will definitely go straight on either side without analyzing the whole text.
---
In this case, I’m a 100% sure that report icons include farming too, and most of people don’t really mind on farming games, so they’re not likely to report it. But, technically they can.
---
Ashe, Bill, Jeff, and Tapp all look pretty good, the rest are nightmare fuel
---
had a Nurse we kept getting and we always got out 4 survivors strong. I threw on The Game offering to make it hard mode on our team and we got the same Nurse again for the fifth time. Nurse dc'd after the third gen popped and no hooks
---
MoM man shouldn’t even exist tbh. Hilarious that its nurse that it’s broken against, the one killer it is needed for really.
---
No way, a Metalocalypse reference out of the blue! God, this show was amazing. Would recommend to anyone who likes aborent violence and hilarity.
---
Ace is part of the Hag's DLC - ie. paid.
---
Yes, it was him.
---
I wish there was some way around Insta downs, but chafing it would also nerf several perks and killers
---
Hillbilly takes 0 skill
---
I'm neither, just don't like certain people
---
Way too inconsistent. The amount of times I've hit survivors after they take 3 steps and still don't get the down is stupid. Also the unhooker is sometimes just immune. Standing right behind them and the hit goes through them and hits the other guy when it should have pulled.
---
Damn
---
Yea, probably just a cover for how bad he was (he dead harded into a wall and then DSed and got stuck in a door)
---
No, you shut up with your stupid pessimism.
---
lul
---
and they nerfed it so that if you miss a single hit with it the frenzy ends now making it much less worth using thanks to the long stun animation that goes with feral frenzy
---
I dont think that's the n word
---
“Ended this mans whole career” is why it’s in poor taste. It’s one thing to say something like, “I think I did an okay job solo” but your title is extremely far fetched and putting someone else down. You post some bull shit survivor gameplay of course you’re gonna get flak for it.
---
Found the Killer who's ruin she cleansed!
---
When Survivors know what to expect things go more smoothly. So messaging is precisely is what be getting ya good farmin games.
---
Survs can go a whole match without seeing a Killer and his “I’m a Farmer Boi” Spin moves, so it makes it seems like those are tryhard sweatybois.
---
Course some are, but once everyone is on the same page, things go smoother.
---
Also the Vocal Minority on Forums and Reddit are certainly not the Majority.
---
Username checks out
---
Yes, it was him. Ranks 9 and 10 and didn't say anything.
---
Where is ace?
---
It is.
---
I find it to be that the most toxic player have their whole account private. It’s normally cheaters and face camping Russians that will have everything hidden. I think the devs should add the chat toggle to hide chat unless you press a key to show it, also should add a filter that turns toxic “gg 2 ez” to something self-loathing like they do in Overwatch lol.
---
Only by no life assholes. Lul
---
Если ты ничто без Hex Ruin, то у тебя не должно быть этого.

David, Laurie, Ash and Adam imo

WGLF and Dead Hard on David, DS on Laurie, Mettle of Men on Ash and Deliverance on Adam

I like to respond to hate mail by typing random gibberish such as this

Booga booga obro booga

GGGHNHGGJHGXDD!!!

What the heck is an "I'm a farmer Boi" spin move? 🤔
---
Default dance took me out. thanks OP for making my night!!
---
when i say i screamed
---
#humansbeingbros
---
Good one, you got me. Think you can post another 11 minute video of you doing gens a little bit later?
---
You can turn off chat by clicking the arrow icon when chat is open to close it. It's a bit annoying to do that though
---
I know, but you got onto the other person for talking about "hiding in corners" because that wasn't part of the discussion, when really you did say something about it.
---
&gt;It's needed on slow killers, like Huntress, or killers like Trapper and Hag, who like in this situation
---
Except it's abused by all killers, especially the fastest ones. I practically never see a Nurse or Billy game that doesn't have a Ruin in it. It's damn near unheard of. It's relied upon too heavily because if it is destroyed fast, the killer DC's, but if it stays much longer into the game, the killer goes "GG EZ SHOULD HAVE DONE TOTEMS! LAWL! GIT GUD AT SKILL CHECKS!".   
---
It's the most hypocritical thing about this game. Relying on a perk that doesn't require any skill, but call the other side shit for not having the skill to find it quickly or to out-skill your perk with skill checks.   
---
Then there's killers that babysit their Ruin. I've seen doctors stand in one spot and just continuously shock the area where their hexes happen to be, or Trapper/Hag running back the second they hear the trap undone, or Billy/Nurse making sure to run by every few seconds. Add in the protection of TOTH, and some games it's just beyond frustrating to deal with, *especially* for solo players.
---
Chased for over 3 minutes, never downed, did 2 and half gens, got 2 saves and a heal, opened the exit gate, with 1 perk no items no add ons solo, escaped. Hate us cuz they ain't us. I'll post another video really soon just for you ;)
---
I didn't say anything about people dealing with you but ok. The point was something you either aren't familiar with or capable of, and which ever it is, that's ok, but the purpose was human decency and basic concern.
---
I wanna see it.
---
Tbh I'm quite shocked there's chess controversies
---
Dude this happened to me today. I don’t play killer much, (rank 17,) but I had spend daily’s as Huntress and since I like playing her, I jumped into a game. 
---
Found a Nea, smacked her once, D/C
---
Caught a Tap once, when I put him on the hook the second time he D/C’d
---
Jane just gave up on hook, with only one gen done, so I found the hatch and let the Meg have it after she did another gen.
---
Really? So then I should be able to DC if the killer is able to render one of my perks unusable?  
---
If I have deliverance but I'm hooked before I can use it, it's okay for me to ragequit?  
---
If I get pulled into the dream world and it eats up all of my distortion, it's okay for me to ragequit?
---
If Wraith and Pig are constantly camping with zero TR and outplaying my Borrored Time, it's okay for me to ragequit?  
---
If there's a Mirror Myers able to avoid every single detection Perk in game, it's okay for me to ragequit?  
---
If I'm never being left on the ground long enough to stand up with No Mither, it's okay for me to ragequit?  
---
If I'm only ever being downed with Powers and never M1's and my MoM is never filling, it's okay for me to ragequit?  
---
That's a street that goes both ways. We get into games sometimes and our perks suddenly become completely ineffective. That's the risk we take going into a game when we don't know the killer's power, perks, or add-ons. Any good player should go into the game knowing what they'll do if their perk is rendered useless, and have a strategy for it. If you *rely* on Ruin to win the game, you're not doing a good job as a killer, because the perk is winning the game for you.
---
seconded
---
The last one was end of December/early January and we’ve only gotten our next one now, could be a few months :(
---
Survivors already rage quite for all of these examples. Street goes both ways.
---
Hmm.... I was more focused more on the body blocking part. He seemed to be talking more about people ignoring the game and just hiding in corners, or at least I took it that way. You can be working on a gen and be in a corner at the same time, and get body blocked in if you aren't careful.
---
Yeah.  I mean what it comes down to is at the end of the day if I think I can maybe save someone I'm gonna try.  Whether I'm playing with friends or not - And I play  alone A LOT.
---
U/iceman2kx
---
Maybe the totem system in general could be reworked
---
Now which Merc would make the best survivor?
---
Awh, oh well, it’s still really cool of the devs to add these events. From what I’ve heard its been pretty toxic anyways, still sucks though, I wish I could’ve taken advantage of it. I’ll definitely take advantage of the next event... probably! If you can play I wish you luck in your games though thanks for the answer!
---
I literally spent all the points I got from the weekend on Billy and I still don't have BBQ.
---
Play as killer!
---
I play on console, also thanks for the input. I was looking at Kate's perks and a couple seem helpful in certain situations but just not sure how they stand up in high rank.
---
I’ve been playing more killer anymore because when you play killer you kinda set the tone. I like to fuck around and play around and shit. Normally at least one survivor will play along, especially if they’re the last left
---
r/cursedimages
---
Surviving was always toxic.
---
I think being called the n word is a Steam
---
Achievement? I’ve only had it happen a couple of times and each time I couldn’t stop laughing. 
---
It’s just a game.
---
Then what is it? Noed user maybe?
---
Wasn't aware of the PC to console unlocked character differences so I already have David unlocked, just haven't levelled him up due to being attracted to Claudette's perks.
---
Honestly the only one of Kate’s perks I’ve found useful has been Windows of Opportunity, but that’s only because I’m not as confident in my looping as others. Boil Over’s wording is weird so I’d definitely look at some intensive Kate gameplay beforehand.
---
I showed you my blink please respond
---
r/nice
---
Oh I LOVE the gears on Prove Thyself!
---
nice
---
Was going to say that lol. Basically if the opposite team beats you, they were toxic. There's no escaping it. 😂
---
He's so adorable
---
Is like heaven
---
Did you get up a person at the end with a instant heal when they were downed? It's not toxic if you did but it's super annoying. Cant complain much though if you expect to get a last minute sacrifice after not having killed anyone then the killer has already lost.
---
I've been accused of this several times just because I like to dick around with flashlight saves. If I'm maxed on co-op points from a couple of gens there's not much else for me to do at that point except make the killer as mad as I can get them. 
---
I almost can't wait for the new end game mode to come out. There are some people who play killer that are so bad at playing killer I'll stay in the map and taunt them and spam my flashlight at them. One of them that I did this to was so bad at playing killer I got almost no points the whole match. He would ditch the chase at the first loop I got to. 
---
People here on Reddit are going to automatically assume that I'm a "toxic survivor main" but truth be told, I play both roles and at that time I still had points to gain so I didn't depip for doing well just because the killer was trash. 
---
The devs put the game into a really bad state for both roles with the emblem point changes. As a survivor if you don't participate in all aspects of the match you're going to depip or safety pip. You're literally punished for playing well instead of being rewarded. As a killer, if you play to efficiently and kill everyone in 3 or 4 minutes you're punished for not dragging the game out to 18+ minutes and either depip or safety pip.
---
So with that said, some might think me getting points is "toxic." Meanwhile the truth of the matter is I'm not trying to depip for doing well in the match. Think and say what you want, I'm getting my points and I average almost 30k per match without offerings and without WGLF as a survivor.
---
WGLF is a good one to have when you're trying to rack up some BP, especially during an event. Makes unlocking other stuff much faster.
---
Good... Job...? Yeah, hexes are a gamble, but if you lose that gamble, especially within the first 40 seconds of a game, then you can reset. No, not in a game of chess ir poker, thise are serious, but dbd is a game that doesnt matter, dc and reset if you will. 
---
Also, your playing right now? As in like, your stoping 5 min in the game to write to me? Okay... and you call me bad for using ruin. I never called you bad, but now your insulting yourself but making it sound like I did???
---
It doesn't do anything so good job
---
Yeah the amount of messages i get because of this is crazy and i try to explain what peer to peer means and they dont even care, one even said to me i was lag switching on a console and the game already had dedicated servers
---
Shy Tapp. Sly Bill.
---
Yeah I get what you mean I meant more for kyf cause me and my friends test builds and stuff and mess around and I wanted to try legion before the nerf
---
Im gonna message everyone "I'm a farmer boi" from now on
---
If you really want to test him before the nerf. I think it goes live this Tuesday or the next.
---
I had to leave town for the weekend but I informed everyone that before bed was blood hunt time. I didnt get in as many matches as I wanted but I still did some.
---
Would also make q times alot quicker with crossplay
---
It's the big brain game for rich people, I'm sure if the *tea* isn't quite warm enough there's a controversy....
---
No offense on anyone who likes chess here, but come on, a certain stereotype of people play chess. Let's not kid ourselves.
---
Best of luck, OP
---
Yeah I grinded the game for the couple hours I could before I had to get to the plane, sucks I couldn’t do anything about it but family always comes first, good luck in future games though!
---
Maaan you shoulda tried to edit it into slow motion as well. That was tufff
---
That's some helpful information, thanks! Also i am able to do a KYF in some rare cases when everyone comes online. I'll have to take some time to study what's available as you said, seems like the best way to solve this.
---
no
---
should have given ace the the pine tree just as a refrence, amazing work, was able to tell it was dbd characters drawn as gravity falls characters before I read the title
---
The higher echelons are actually better. Like every other multiplayer game it's the lower ranks where you get this trash bullshit. Higher rank killers know that camping doesn't win you games so they don't do it unless its strategically makes sense at a particular moment. And higher rank team mates know when to do gens and when to save.
---
This is Noob3 levels of edit. Props &lt;3
---
Us (2019) chapter
---
"Hexes are a gamble"
---
Except you aren't gambling. You're only playing the games that are working in 'your' favor. Destroying the hex is to reward the survivors, not you. You deny them that reward because you're butthurt, because you're crap without that Hex. I'm just saying you need to admit it. I freely admit that I'm not great in all aspects of the game, and I will leave in certain situations, though I personally prefer to stick it out and give my team the best fighting chance they can at least. Depends on how I'm feeling that day, or if I get into ANOTHER game with only 2 survivors, or if I'm getting facecamped for the 5th game in a row. :)
---
"your playing right now?"
---
Why yes I am. I usually watch something or have reddit open to take up the wait times. What, you think I'm gonna look at the "searching for match" text all day?
---
"to write to me?"
---
Don't flatter yourself. I reply to more than just you. Like Santa Claus, I have lots of coal to give out to many children.
---
I got on the trail after reading about how chess master inexplicably played terribly and really oddly in his last tournament and no one knows why
---
A 3K for me means that I basically hooked everybody three times. At that point, I've got huge points and it's not like getting the sacrifice is gonna give me that much more points anyways. If I dismantle teams, it's pretty just my way of saying thanks for not d/cing.
---
Survivors get really salty about who you give hatch to though. Lots of people don't like it when I give tHe mOSt WoRTHleSS perSOn oN the TeAM hatch. It's basically comes down to who I down second to last.
---
the game is basically dying now. well for my region anyways. i uninstalled last night after 3 years. it was good while it lasted.
---
Oh dammit I totally should have, lol
---
Thirded
---
I love it
---
detectives hunch with a killer belongings map is pretty neat. Tons of objective points and bye bye NOED after the 1st gen
---
Being a killer main is a worse experience.
---
Which killer do you play?
---
And it was Haunted Grounded. Nice fucking job, Meg.
---
Why does it matter? They haven't played in a bit. Maybe they forgot, maybe they never knew, but it's not really relevant regardless.
---
I love doing this as killer. If I find the hatch before they do and I've gotten all my BBQ stacks, it's just my way of saying thanks for the fun game.
---
Close! The first hex perk that's cut off is Haunted Grounds.
---
I tried to add similar objects to other icons, but they all looked much worse than they are now.
---
Its easily countered by getting into a locker or running that jeff perk? 
---
I am actually trying to understand why you need it to be nerfed?
---
They’ve already tweaked the range of it
---
Get in a locker or run a perk where it dont reveal you?
---
No idea what you said but incase you misunderstood - I’ve only posted twice on this subreddit ever - not this same video twice
---
Did the same as most of you have, went and played killer to have some fun and get points with people, fuck all these asshole killers on PS4 they have been out right blood thirsty, toxic and rude. I haven’t hardly been able to play any games as survivor without people not loading in, people DC or the killer killing us all in the first 4 mins of the game because they are running billy with all the sweaty perks and might make 9k or they face camp and that’s been horrible since the event started.
---
Had a bubba earlier who said bring party streamers and we did 4 of them and we did 1 gen and then went for the hook and rescues. Well after we all have been hooked twice, he downs all of us and finish’s us off and tells us thanks for the points and don’t trust bubbas! This guy can go play in traffic and was totally a mommas teet sucking loser. I was done and done burning party streamers for killers or other survivors to waste them fuck them and I will never burn another one during a double blood point event. We can help each other out during the event with these offerings but no I gotta be sweaty and fuck you over right in the beginning. 
---
So I went and played killer and have had fun and gotten a ton of points and my inbox is full of GG’s, Ty and ty for not being a asshole killer and letting us have fun and get points. 
---
To the rest of you cock stains on PS4 as killers, FUCK YOU!
---
Are you on PC or Console? 
---
Are you killer or survivor?
---
and yet here i am, wondering how i ended up with 3 BP
---
It's not remotely mandatory. I almost never use it myself. I much prefer killers using that over Ruin. BBQ can be annoying but it's fairly easy to counter or mindgame.
---
I guess it’s the saggy cheekbones, isn’t it. Puh, uncanny.
---
“I shouldn’t have to do anything out of my way to survive” 
---
Let me guess, are you also one of those people who gets belligerent when downed by NOED?
---
Yeah I don't get why it's okay for one player to grieve another by preventing them from playing the game. And sometimes even to forceful end the game for that player quickly.
---
It's a mechanic that breeds toxicity and the devs should really address it.
---
[deleted]
---
Your a madman I tell you... a madman
---
NOED? The best killer perk? A perk that only activates at endgame and can be destroyed before it even activates?
---
Why are so many poeple referencing a headless horsemen
---
I actually fucking love this
---
Beautiful.
---
We need to decide if we want killers to go do something else after a hook / hit or not. If we do, they need powerful sight options so they aren't just throwing the game. If not, then we need to delete the words "camping" and "tunneling" from our vocabulary.
---
Particularly for newer killer players. If you literally have no other information and are still weak on map awareness, there isn't a good option.
---
Also, Nurse and Billy would be strong regardless. They both have really powerful kits that help in both chases and give them map presence with no prep (compared to Hag, for example). I'm not convinced that Chili is what is throwing them over the edge.
---
Best way: legion bad
---
It's stupid how easily counterable BBQ is. Just climbing in a locker shuts that shit down.
---
I going against Myers. He is by far my favorite killer. Also, his Mori is so simplistic, but also wonderful.
---
Jeff and Tapp look great. The others...
---
I’m surprised when he said “Let it all out” you didn’t have her vomiting everywhere
---
The gestures are more rude. If you do one or two crouches in the open and don't run away then it's clearly friendly or "just kill me", it's different after a loop. I'm a killer main, it's pretty obvious when it's done to be rude and when it's not
---
Not saying its for everyone, but play killer and get good at it. It's so satisfying to outplay good survivors and annihilate them. MUAHAHAHAHA
---
Oh no
---
I get that getting tunneled isn’t fun, but what is my purpose as killer if not to sacrifice the survivors. In my experience, the most effective way to do that is to confirm my kills.
---
PC, survivor and killer. I’ve waited 20 mins and i still didn’t find any games.
---
Dont know why she did just blink away? Maybe she's a baby nurse.
---
wait I didn't know this was a sub reddit thanks
---
Its in no way sportsmanship its utter generosity.
---
Lol I love pairing the pumpkin head with the prestige cosmetics
---
As a trapper, the best tactic is to put your traps on the stupidest locations possible. For example, trap god pallet when god pallet has been already destroyed and all gens near the shack are done. They'll never expect that level of stupidity, and that trap will come clutch and let you get a 4 man (real story)
---
how to get 4 DC's in under 5 minutes
---
Like level 150 doctor, still don't have UP at more than rank 1(and I just got it at all), but I have like every other perk I own at rank 3.
---
I'd go with clown. Like others have said he can close down loops with bottles and his teachable,  bamboozle, let's you vault faster and have the entity close them for a few seconds.
---
Wait what’s the difference
---
Can you do some killers? I would love to see wraith in that style
---
Wrong. She's obviously The Entity Itself
---
Did you just call The Entity "her"?
---
As in "Nea"?
---
This reminds me of that one dog treat commercial
---
thanks for bill smirking
---
New ones are green/rare instead of common
---
People need to have their own art style instead of just copying the most popular (and ugly) one, no soul
---
I've said this so many times, and it never seems to sink in.
---
Killers do NOT want a 1v4 game. Ever. Like... never ever.
---
They want 4 smaller 1v1 games, where survivors do not work together, and where the killer has all the knowledge and power.
---
Nobody gives a shit.
---
I was streaming dbd and running an experiment, named the stream toxic bubba ran bbq, more, insidious, and Franklins and what I did was I face camped/ insidious camped(I wouldn’t do this at other time) a d almost every game survs hipped in my chat and tried to harass me (tried is the key word because they said what they wanted then ran from confrontation) it shows that survs shit talk, then run away, I’m gonna do the same thing tomorrow and see if I get more reactions, but it’s true that survs just complain about the game when they can easily counter it.
---
lol. i clearly said it was in “my” region there’s literally only two killers we verse.
---
Now they gen locked themselves, it's their own fault.
---
Thanks dog! 👍
---
Eh, I'd still argue that  tbagging to get that message across is a gamble in itself. If it works then it works. If not, then I don't think any survivor should be surprised that they got hooked.
---
Hag is sweet dude, I main her on PS4
---
Fourded
---
Has happened to all of us
---
Yes I read that. You still have no proof to claim that the game is dying because you personally got burned out from it.
---
Wow, back in those days sloppy butcher was just a trash perk
---
With the new ds?
---
Dude 100%. I have days where every game I have either crap teammates, get nothing but Nurses and Spirits, moris, or campers/tunnelers. Just switch to killer and be chill. Play the game for the fun of the chase and not to be a dick.
---
I think y'all are gonna be best friends.
---
Get the ones with perks you like up to level 40, then start leveling the one you actually enjoy playing
---
my proof is that it’s hard to find games. simple as that my dude. it’s not rocket science.
---
At least the song is cool
---
Did you just assume the entity's gender BRAH?
---
I could say the same of Self-Care, MoM, DS, Deliverance, Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time
---
Yeah whats funny is I remember going back and starting the blood web for every killer a long time ago idek why I did
---
As a killer main, I feel pretty much the same way.  I know when I have a bad game it's because of me.  Even if I know I don't have the perks or if I think survivors did SWF, there is always something about my performance I can improve.
---
As opposed to teammates just doing a bad job.
---
Why not? Killing has been toxic since the beginning of the game.
---
Yeah I found brown map offerings on my meg not too long ago lol
---
I wish I could have that kind of luck. The game never gives me any good offerings (Pudding/Cake, Streamers) so naturally, on the rare occasion I do get them and I use them, I get either campy tunnel-y Legions or Toxic Teabagging Flashlight Neas+P3 Claudettes. Its legit gotten me like one button press from deleting this game entirely.
---
At the very least, I'm taking a hiatus until EGC comes to console now.
---
It's not toxic for the game, it's just a perk. What's toxic is your pathetic attitude towards not wanting to have to work at surviving just because you've run in to a meta perk. Get over it and learn the counters or do us all a favor and move on to another game, please.
---
Yikes this video had more dead memes than your average Noob3 video.
---
  
---
Also that aspect ratio and watermark. What a bad post.
---
Feng looks uber cute
---
I was waiting to get into a game while watching this, the lobby loaded, and there was an Ash in there saying "Kiss my grits!" RIGHT as you jumped into the hatch.   
---
Perfect. Timing.
---
Your personal experience does not reflect anything major though. Your personal experience is such a minor sample pool that you can't accurately say the game is dying from just that alone. Its not rocket science but some how you still don't understand.
---
me at 3 a.m. in the bathroom pretending to be sick so that my mom doesn't send me to school
---
tfw the only time I got BBQ and Chili was in the PTB
---
AKA: why learn to chase when you can just ignore all the mechanics in the game and provide unenjoyable experiences for the other 80% of players 4Head.
---
Something like Gantz I would imagine except all of them keep coming back.
---
I mean, you shouldn't expect the killer to give you hatch anyway. For me it's kind of a "you're better than me, take a free kill" and if i get hatch that's great.
---
Completely true, If I had a penny for everytime My DS ran out By a few seconds and I get hooked because of this I'd probplably have like 25$
---
\*jerks self off over meaningless video game skill\*
---
miss pauling
---
I hate you, but in a respectful way lol.
---
Well I wouldn't say its no counterplay.
---
Prevent them from getting the last gen, countered.
---
On the hook when the gates power, countered.
---
The pigs helmet things, kind of countered.
---
Huntress with Noed, countered.
---
Billy with Noed, countered. 
---
Nurse with Noed, countered. 
---
Plague with Noed, countered. 
---
Blood warden, meh it works. 
---
Clowns ability, sure with some add ons. 
---
You get the point
---
My problem isn't what it does, it's how rewarding it is for the killer. Hooking each survivor once gives you a total of 100% extra blood points, on TOP of revealing auras.  
---
WGLF is nowhere near that strong. You basically give up a perk slot to get 100% extra BP, but it gives you no in-game advantage against the killer the way BBQ does.
---
To be honest, I would have been more okay with a 1 hit system with multiple lives or stages or something instead of the multi-hook system. That way each new life or stage feels like a fresh chance instead of "oh boy, the killer is going to come right back and prioritize me and I am not going to get to play the game at all". But that would require reworking the game from the ground up. Which ain't gonna happen. The problem with DBD is that it is designed in a way where people becoming considerably frustrated is simply inevitable.
---
Anyone new, killer or survivor, has it rough.
---
I mean, sure. Don't disagree with them being really strong, but the fact that they can zip around and immediately start another chase with a new survivor after a fresh hook because of BBQ is my biggest problem with it. It turns into "gg ez" at red ranks. Of course, I play solo, so my experience is very different from mythical stacked 4 SWF teams that everyone seems to know about.
---
Ok........
---
*YOU ARE ASCENDING*
---
Just had a match where I was the last alive and finally found the hatch but it was being guarded as usual so I just figured screw it and l just motioned for the killer to just kill me but instead they just downed me and gave me the hatch. Those types of killer players are my favorite ones.
---
You're\*
---
I got my spirit to p3 like last month and bbq doesn’t want to show up at all. At least I got the other 3 perks I use at tier 3
---
Does anybody know from what movie this is?
---
Seriously it's not hard i was a billy i kept running into a tree on purpose, only one person let me farm the rest just noped the fuck out everytime i remotely looked in there direction.
---
i don’t think you understand. that it doesn’t matter.
---
i simply stated that it’s dying in my region. good for you if not yours. games been in decline ever since legion and a bit before. slowly dripping it’s playerbase. it’s just what i’ve noticed IN MY REGION. read my fellow douche
---
Noice
---
Omg jane
---
Most likely, far as I remember when they lose all hope they become servants of the entity or else my theory would be correct and Benedict Baker is the entity, and the only way to escape the entity's realm would be to give up, which is the opposite of what he reccomends.
---
I want those. Is there a download link?
---
That’s s basically my reaction too and every now and then it’s actually a nice comment which just makes me feel bad about how jaded I’ve become.
---
Kindred is the anti camp perk.
---
Shows your team that you’re being camped, and the smart ones start gen rushing. Yes you’ll prob die, but the killer will depip as long as you’re not playing with yolo idiots.
---
Petty revenge is sweet
---
Perfect 10,/10 comment
---
Might wanna add a spoiler tag and stobing light warning, jesus that caught me off guard in a dark room.
---
no, saxton would be way too op of a character
---
&gt;slower
---
You mean faster?
---
Even funnier to report them :)
---
What's wrong with riding dick?
---
In all my 25 years of gaming Ive never seen a more toxic group of people than the dbd community lol
---
Do you know if legion loses bloodlust when going into feral frenzy?
---
What happens if you down someone with Feral Frenzy while using the Iridescent Button?
---
But was it adept?
---
I respect your opinion but nothing will ever top the main girl.
---
David/Huntress is free on all platforms tho not sure why he is listed.
---
I dont know why it does not shake, but i im pretty sure that it does not matter and bps still stack.
---
I would assume so only because you’re fixing to outrun that survivor by a lot anyways
---
What about play with your food?
---
I haven’t test this but I would bet he keeps that as he gets bonuses from perks in other ways such as vaulting. I’ve always wanted to see save the best for last perk on him
---
My boy ace doesn't need a smile, he's already smiling to the lady luck
---
Come on we all know that chlorohag rides that horse
---
Thanks I’ve been trying to test out fastest movement speed on different killers so I might get him and test it
---
I would love to see that on legion. It would be insanely funny seeing him blur
---
Swear words are pain relievers. I’ve been shocked many times, all of them result in me saying the word fuck in some variety. I think and many others would be stuck in a loop
---
He had 3 of us down at once, not slugging we were just all in the same small area, and it was maybe 5 minutes in to the game.
---
How tf does bbq/chili attribute to camping
---
Damn, that's fucking lame as hell.
---
There is hope during the anniversary in June.
---
It's the sound she makes when puking, you just don't hear it over the other sounds
---
With unnecessarily loud grunting noises I hope
---
I've been playing him a lot just because mine is hoarding an assload of puddings &amp; streamers. I never bother using him outside of events since hes so potato
---
your name makes this thread cursed
---
I couldn't play as much as I wanted to but i got my Meg to 50, Hag to 35, and Nea to 19 and I am really happy now.
---
That's a big old yep
---
I contemplate uninstalling everyday, at this point I'm assuming i just like the abuse
---
Thats so close! Thank you for the hope haha!
---
I got lucky with my spirit bloodweb and got bbq on the first one 😎
---
it's fucking annoying when people do this and I'm 3 hooked in the first 2 minutes
---
Perks:
---
Pumpkin bomb: When the trail starts 5 random windows will have a pumpkin bomb on them. Any survivor that performs a rushed vault on a window with a bomb will make it explode and take 1 hit point if a bomb explodes it has a 30/40/50% chance to destroy the window
---
Boo: survivors within 5/10/15 meters of your terror radius for 3 seconds will scream(can be countered by calm spirit) effect will not take place if your terror radius is below 10 meters
---
Your it: You become obsessed with one survivor. Hitting your obsession will reveal every other survivor for 5/7/9 seconds
---
You have a perk slot you could have filled. Every character in the game comes with 3 perks and you didn't choose one. That's your fault. 
---
You cannot get "bullied" by Borrowed Time. If you camp, that's your punishment. 
---
I agree, shit talking like that isn't cool, but you're not a total victim here. You didn't take a perk, and you camped.
---
It took me to level 46 to get SB to level 2 on meg. I'm running adrenaline and SB both lvl 2 as a 50 char.
---
LOL
---
If it makes you feel better I missed my ds earlier today against a camping Legion and ended up in the basement.
---
Tunneled for DS? Lord, I get tunneled just for hitting them with ONE pallet.   
---
Like... if they're chasing someone else later in the game, they'll change and come after me. 
---
Only babies camp. Don't worry about it.
---
sixthded
---
Love that perk.
---
Its really not that bad, if your getting hate every single game you must be playing in a real unfun ways
---
Yeah, more fantasy then Sci-Fi too. Watched Gantz a bit. Was really... Weird, even for me
---
*DemiPee wants to know your location*
---
Its like BT for yourself if its active.
---
As a killer main I approve this message because Everytime I play as LF they unhook infront of me then boom both downed by the chainsaw
---
Ok, well this is just wrong.
---
This is actually interesting for the killers power to be able to charge forward in a quicker timeframe to catch a vaulting survivor that would be out of range of a normal swing or that would escape to safety before a long lunge would connect.
---
The drawback depending on how long the rage would last might be balanced depending on the duration, and for not being able to vault like houses with a jump down window would certainly add in extra play for both the killer and survivor.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Borrowed_Time
---
A killer who can hide in one locker and then pop out from another one
---
Easy 4Ks.
---
Hell, a Legion with Rancor camped my body for almost a minute just so he could Mori me.
---
Me "Why'd you do that? I wasn't being toxic?"
---
Him "I know. I WAS being toxic."
---
ParaphrasIng here but that's the gist of it
---
It is not
---
I forgot about this thread.
---
Same
---
Doesn't the idea of survivors having cellphones seem fucking stupid though?
---
The issue with multiple survivors DC'ing at once is that it screws over killer pipping &amp; do a degree ruins the bp gainage. 
---
Players who DC before getting their first hook are the worst as it stops perks like BBQ getting tokens. Killers get I believe 625bp for a survivor who DC's which is barely anything considering hitting a survivor grants 300 brutality points. 
---
I personally feel bad for the other survivors when a survivor DC's. Although it annoys me as it ruins some of my bp gains &amp; pipping, the real victims are the leftover survivors as they are much more likely to lose &amp; makes me feel like I have to play more merciful.
---
When I DC its usually because I'm overcome with salt and feel the killer doesn't deserve the points for hooking me. I usually regret it by the time I get to the menu but I still do it. I've only ever done it when I'm on the last hook though, or if my own teammates have screwed me.
---
Is this the second time I've seen this?
---
Sometimes people feel the killer got a down/kill he didn't deserve.
---
Sometimes people don't want to go against certain setups.
---
Sometimes people are assholes.
---
Pick one
---
There's actually a very risky move that I do where, while you're running from the killer you slow down slightly then do a 360 degree immediate turn around and juke the killer. It mostly just works on more inexperienced killers but still fun when it works.
---
They don't lose pips, so they DC all they want
---
Idk I’ve never seen someone post an old party streamer only old new moon bouquets
---
Where is D for all the above.
---
I’ll pick the first one, how does a killer “not deserve it?” If a killer hits me I got hit, done deal. Aren’t survivors op in high levels anyways?
---
As a survivor main I usually only DC if I'm on a major losing streak because I get tunneled or face camped. That frustration just kinda builds up. As a killer I do understand though I have people DC just because I find them early in a match and down them once.
---
I literraly said why in my comment?
---
CalArts is overused and ugly, this is a drawing not animation so your entire post is pointless
---
Why not small game
---
Well then mabe all gens should'nt be capable of being done withing 3-5 minutes....
---
I suggest the plague. She is more than viable in lower ranked games and more importantly she spreads her aids which is pretty fun. I personally enjoy puking gonorrhea over hooked survivors to maintain dominance over them. Imagine 360 no scopes over the wall and their reactions in the post game screen.
---
Yeah if you watch streamers like Zubatlel or Fungoose, they can end games before the first gen is completed consistently with Nurse.
---
Her ability to go through walls &amp; travel far gives her the largest snowball potential in the game. She is also the hardest killer to play in the game due to developing muscle memory with the blink distances &amp; predicting survivor movement during LOS blocks. 
---
On console, nurse is hell to play because of the lack of precision for every blink. The same reason why huntress is much harder to play compared to PC. Zubatlel plays amazing huntress aswell &amp; he can pull of astonishing hits with the hatchets.
---
The best way for success in any killer is learning when to slug survivors. Once you master that skill you will find much better success with killers as it teaches you how to snowball matches into your favour.
---
By that logic, does scratched mirror Myers embody small dick energy?
---
Why take the worst exh perk then lol
---
In my only Billy game today, I pulled a 3 gen strat and literally both of the last 2 people were camping the hatch. Once I downed one of them, hooked, past the first thing I see of cover, the game is over. I notice a lot of my games end with people camping hatch instead of actually attempting to get gens done (which is understandable when there’s one person left), but there really should be a way to properly counter hatch camping as a killer.
---
Tbh, they should just add a way to decline getting unhooked. This perk would just be the cherry on top.
---
Well Nea was born killer but there was a game glitch that made her a survivor. I got banned from the dbd forums because I made a joke about people abusing the second killer glitch by playing Nea lmao
---
The thing with me is I suck at killer, so I give myself the illusion I’m good by playing Michael. Sometimes legion. Maybe that’s why people dc...
---
Some killers like to use the excuse of not seeing any auras to mean that the survivors are around.
---
Haddonfield is easily the most unbalanced map in the game and really boring to play on, its just survivors looping annoying houses the whole game
---
... if there aren’t any auras, then that’s a perfectly fine reason to *check the area for a bit*. Because that means that the survivors are in-fact, near.
---
We are specifically talking about being tunneled off the hook, which is why I made the comparison.
---
If hes face hooking just kill yourself on the hook instead of perpetuating the shitty DC behavior

---
I don't understand why they don't just have some code that detects when a player uses the 'leave game' button. After a certain number of times, the player is flagged to the devs. 
---
This way it can determine if players lag out or crash during a game compared to just rage quitting. You could argue that players will just shut the game down but it's much more inconvenient which discourages DC'ing.
---

---
Made them using an app
---
Watching streamers like Zubatlel, ScottJundd &amp; Fungoose really helped me play both survivor &amp; killer.
---
Would suggest giving them a watch &amp; see how they play. You become much better at the game from watching high level plays from either side which I would highly recommend if you want to improve the way you play the game.
---
Zubatlel shows some amazing slugging which I have been incorporating into my killer gameplay with great success.
---
Now that's just creepy
---
I can already see the hatemail. “STOP SLUGGING” “TOXIC SLUGGER”
---
That the old dude from left 4 dead?
---
Meme dedicated to the Doctor who'd zap people to Tier 3, hit them once, and then leave them completely.
---
When the game ended without him getting a single hook he typed "gg ez coward with friends try playing the game normally faggots." I didn't know anyone in that lobby. All I do know is that half the team spent half the game being injured and then Self Caring back to full.
---
r/thighdeology welcomes you brother
---
And I can already see the 'Merciless Killer' on your screen as they scream this at you from your 4k due to 'toxic slugging'.
---
Haha. Can I ask a question? Can you only get tier 3 as Michael 3 or 4 times? When I stalk people enough they turn red and my bar doesn’t go up, so is there a limited amount of stalk juice?
---
Could also be distortion, in a locker, behind a gen.
---
https://i.imgur.com/WfhXSh3.jpg
---
Yep William Bill
---
Lmao
---
I would love him as a TF2 Killer... Or also the Blu Spy the killer
---
Are you unaware of skill check doctor?
---
Camping should be addressed when infinites and pallet loop to pallet loop is nerfed.
---
Having bbq now, yeah, if I get 4 stacks at least I now suddenly lose my lust for killing haha. More fun to dick around generally.
---
Gasp!
---
Thank you for the in depth explanation
---
shut cho bii azz up. uwu
---
Which generally goes hand in hand with good sportsmanship.
---
Yeah, aside from all the “Dummy Thicc” jokes I always thought that janes face is the only one of the girl models that looks good when compared to her portrait.
---
I second this! It must happen!
---
“Survivors who have the Borrowed Time perk equipped are not affected” :)
---
As a killer if you see 4 tool boxes and you bring Franklin I get it. Or maybe you see a key then yeah but outside of that i dont want to loose my purple health kit that I've had for 6 matches straight over Franklin's.
---
Ash and Laurie if you have Cash/Cells.
---
The combination of DS, MoM, Adrenaline, and Dead Hard/Sprint Burst/Balanced Landing/Lithe can be insanely difficult to deal with as a killer.
---
As for Jane, Jeff, Adam, and Kate, Adam's Deliverance is the only one that offers you second chance akin to DS and MoM.
---
Yeah!
---
I like it myself man
---
I have to laugh.
---
Actually, it should be ingame mechanic.
---
Dead Hard is kind of too much situational against a good killer
---
Actually its 100% speed, not faster. But like I said pharmacy cheats through it, so we need to consider more things. For example what if you want to use another item ?
---
u/SpitsOutCereal
---
Definitely
---
And then they wonder why gens go too fast.

I like Franklins soon as i see a key. I just smack it right oit of your hands.
---
I blame rank system because I still depip with a 3k + hatch.
---
I need that skin in the game ASAP
---
I mean they selected Pug as a whisperer so...
---
Playing both
---
I said bad options.
---
I onced deadhard'ed into a corner and the killer bodyblocked me accidentally. It was an infinite tier 3 Michael and he stood there staring at me for a solid minute before he finally decided I was shamed enough and stabbed me. He left me tho, maybe he pitied my retardation :')
---
I'm missing 5 party streamers + BBQ in this post
---
I never see the point of bringing Franklin's, it is not worth 1 perk slot to "remove" items.
---
I think they've mentioned it, that as soon you don't seem usefull to the entity as a survivor/killer, you will get thrown into a void. Basicly killing you for good. I wouldn't call that an escape.
---
Sorry I was trying so hard to remember what they were actually called! 
---
What do you mean by I didn’t check all 5 and the extra box?
---
I don’t remember ever having to go to a jigsaw box more than once. That being said, I usually manage to avoid getting it put on me in the first place- so I don’t have much experience with them.
---
I dont think it would be any good... most chases would take way too long xD
---
When the event first started it was hard tunnels. Not pretend tunnels. You get off the hook you were getting right back on it reguradless of who else is around. It was facecamping and everyone ran noed match after match. It got to the point when 1 or 2 gens were left I was just trying to cleanse everything. I hang around ranks 8-12. I feel like I would rank up faster but every two or three games something crucial happens. I get dropped in and I'm the only one getting things done or people cant stop getting found and hooked. It also doesnt help that my looping skills aren't as great as they could be.
---
Bill is unbreakable!
---
zap
---
Yeah I missed it as well, I was at work every day, I’m off today....
---
You should have had bbq. You can get 70000 not during dbp with bbq. I can get 100k during the event if I'm going against some potatoes.
---
Well the stats confirmed that rank 10-20 survivors have less than 30% survival rate, one the big contributors to that is this totem.
---
Newbies aren't self-aware, and they play as strangers in the game, so most of the time hex isn't being actively looked upon by anyone, besides.
---
So if there are good players among survivors they suffer as the result.
---
Pro players most of the time will quickly find it and cleanse it anyway.
---
So having a runtime is a good solution.
---
There where only three gens left, your team could easily have rushed them.
---
Horseless headless horsemann would be cool. But pyro would be better. 
---
The killer could see everything in pyrovision.
---
:screams:
---
Tunneling isn't even a thing. It's called "doing the objective".
---
**CHANGE MY MIND**
---
It should be a mechanic. Where I can just say no to a unhook if I'm expecting trouble. It's the most annoying thing when someone rushes to get you and you see spine chill light up. It's getting to the point where I just give up on the match if I get hooked twice in 60 seconds. I had a match where I popped 4 out of 5 gens by myself and with the aid of others then died in 2 minutes from getting farmed off the hook.
---
Oh. So that's why my 360s never work. I dont slow down to bait the hit. Gosh I feel like a idiot!
---
Was in a 3 v 1 with a pig, who was a glass splinter. She hadn't seen me for like 99% of the game as she was torturing a poor Jane and trying to use her as bait. Ended up escaping with Jane not dead. F for the Claudette who knew I wouldn't save her cause lil' miss piggy was a wee bit territorial on her kills. You're welcome Jane
---
Electrode: Charged
---
Treatment: Ordered
---
Yup, it's madness time.
---
Huntress is a strong killer shes absolutely fine. I dont get how you are comparing her to plague whos spit does nothing apart from eventually injure a survivor.
---
I totally agree. I got to rank 3 killer doing this event and it's awful. I tend to stay around 8-12 for my own sanity
---
Corrupt Purge exists.
---
I sit at the gate in-case a teammate would need me to take a hit. Asides from that, I never BM.
---
That's some old shit
---
No, I sweat my balls off because I want to be the best at this E-sport. The only way to do that is to tunnel and camp while making sure nobody has any fun at all except me.
---
That's how you play E-sport games, dude.
---
Like saying patrolling a surivor on hook when gates are open is toxic.
---
Why isn't Nea a baby?
---
Which is why dropping it in a corner is better. It is annoying that other people can steal your items
---
Tonight I got a crazy doctor skill check on a weird part of the screen on a already hard skill check. You want to hard tunnel someone with ds? Play doctor.
---
Yeah man just look at those toxic survivors doing objectives. What a bunch of jerks.
---
Or rather... not accurate
---
All of Jeff's perks are really solid. 
---
Breakdown is extremely helpful attempting to avoid the killer (since you can see their aura) you can choose to heal after unhook if the killer doesn't turn back or use it to pick a good route for avoiding the killer. If camping occurs the hook break helps, especially against isolated hooks.
---
Aftercare gives yourself and teammates a nice benefit. It gives you info on yourself and your teammate so both of you make good decisions. It however requires a bit of altruism to be useful. If you're altruistic then it's not a bad perk.
---
Distortion is wonderful against high mobility killers with BBQ. If you're playing SWF you can concretely confirm what perks the killer is using. If a teammate is hooked BBQ, heal near the killer Nurse's Calling, finish a gen Bitter Murmur, by an exit gate Blood Warden. I've even detected Territorial Imperative once lmao. I've been able to concretely confirm a killer's perks many games and it makes me decide to do totems or not as if you know all their perks, then there's no reason to cleanse.
---
I dont know but apparently it makes you play toxic in dbd. This is my protection is so important.
---
Bill couldn't become a killer. In the comics he showed an extreme act of selflessness. He fought for humanity for so long that there is no way he would turn his back on it.
---
Franklin's trapper, with ebony and perk that hurts survivor if disarmed+bag. Then ruin, agitation, iron grasp and I yeet them to the basement for extra salt.
---
SWFs are the worst so you gotta do your best to be worse than them.
---
My poor vomit queen... weak across 3 platforms...
---
If the perk is mandatory that means survivors are too good. Its mandatory to go from hook to hook and bbq helps. There are way more op perks to complain about that are worse than bbq. If the slowed down gens and helped you find people we could actually have killers with different builds instead of a bunch of m1 reskin clones.

I enjoy the challenge of hiding from one since his tracking is great but not 100% spot on. Using lockers to regulate my madness adds a tense atmosphere to the game and you can actually use the hallucinations to your advantage 
---
He has rich counterplay (Unlike current Legion) and to defeat a doctor you either have to be good at chases and predict his shock therapy or hide + mindgame him. Both IMO are exciting to do, since they require you to genuinely think
---
Maybe at first. But then you realize you have to run Ruin every game or you're down 2 gens by first hook, maybe more. And then you realize that perks are important, so you have to run BBQ every single game so you can farm a literal quadrillion points. So, from the gate, you're down two perks and then you gotta ask yourself: do I prefer survivors to waste my time while they loop me, an apex predator, hellspawn, god of death, around an islet of car junk and a pallet for 45 seconds or 20 seconds? And bam, another perk gone. Maybe even two. Eventually it becomes existential. Do I really want to spend my life playing a game where the highest skill level for all players is just a matter of holding WASD and moving in a circle around junk? And then you realize that the game design is basically shit. Why pallets? Why hooks? Why generators? I'm a goddamn killer. A famous trademarked killer! But I'm getting hit by pallets. And I can't kill people because they're jumping over shit and touring  slaughterhouses. The game is pretty much goofy nonsense and it's buggy and it lags and everybody is abusive. Eventually you reach the ranks where people really do focus on getting the hell out of the game and people are really good and circling islands of crap, many islands, in fact. It finally dawns on you that a real killer wouldn't respect getting ran in a circle. You're wasting so much time getting looped every game when you could just be ignoring that tedious shit. You realize you can't play better, it's really how the game was designed. 
---
And that's how nurse mains are born. When you screw up as nurse, it really is your fault. Everything else is pretty much why no other killer is good.
---
Funny story - I was in a farm match with the Doctor that went pretty well. We did the whole hook exchange and I had just maxed out boldness by dropping the killer shack pallet on him, so I left the shack and pointed off to the side to signal for him to go find the others. He downed me instead. I went ????? until I turned the camera and realized I'd been pointing at a hook lingering outside the door. He took that as a sign that I wanted death. It wasn't a big deal since I was gonna let him sacrifice me anyway and I still got a decent chunk of points, but I got less than expected and felt like an idiot
---
I just played a match with Billy, who I hardly ever play and I did extremely bad in that match. I'm a rank 5 killer and the survivors refused to leave because they wanted to keep looping me even after I clearly gave up. Thank god Egc is coming for this kind of situations. And the end game chat was horrible. These situations drive killers to tunneling and camping.
---
Is that the entity?
---
What I've found is that it works best in an open area with no obstacles to block you accidentally when you 360 but also try to Male sure that you're at least somewhat close to a vaulting location or pallet so that you can extend the chase for a little longer. For that last part it helps tremendously to know the maps really well.
---
Agreed. I don't think it's very realistic that they're going to change every map in the game though.
---
As I just stated in my second edit, I feel that doing something about the hum would help her out a lot on her bad maps. It'd make survivors actually have to pay attention rather than just "oh, I have to run this direction because I can pinpoint exactly where she is, and if she changes direction I can just run the other way for free".
---
Even then whispers only tells you they are near it doesnt say they are in this cone of vision find them no it just says yep they are deffinatly there mocking you from 14-15 meters away
---
I'm getting to where I'm used to maps but it seems like window vaults are always a hit whenever I try to take them.
---
5 was a typo on my part there are 4 boxes base.
---
Damn now I want tonberry to be a new killer

What song is this ? Xdd pls tell

That's sort of like saying if a seatbelt doesn't require you to be in a car accident, it's not meant to protect you during a car accident. If it protects you from being tunneled it's anti-tunnel.
---
When they bring two flashlights and even the non-flashlight guys are there every single time you down somebody, I dunno what else I should expect lol. These damn good survivors playin like a team without even text chat
---
Later that day Reddit user “antivaxdog” was found dead laying face first into his bowl of cereal and supposedly suffocated.
---
Mom “He was so young😖”
---
If the killer camps and everyone else is doing gens or smth, don't do anything cuz it will waste killers time so the killer won't camp someone else
---
You r bad guy, but that doesn’t mean u r BAD guy

That's literally what the data says though.

On PC? No.

On consoles? Yes.

Just give her a visual representation of where her hatchets will go.

Wait so you’re saying you have to go to 4 boxes to  get it off?

What event were they for?

---
I get why Huntress has the humming and I am a very big fan of it. But it starts at 40M, maybe get that down a bit, maybe to the TR, so 32 M, and keep her TR at 20.
---
They have to cleanse and its temporary. I think plagues strong enough but a good huntress will destroy survivors in comparrison
---
As in a throwing arc or a crosshair? Both are interesting suggestions. 
---
I'm not sure how much it'd help with her bad maps though, and I kinda liked having to learn where to aim without an indicator. Just like nurse blinks.
---
This is factually the least effective way to play killer, at least against a team who is even remotely decent. It is a good way to get one sacrifice while the rest of the team gen rushes you though.
---
I know I'm just gonna get absolutely shit on if I use one of those so I don't even get them in the bloodweb
---
When a RBT is placed on you one of the boxes will be chosen that has your key, so you could remove it at the first box or a different one.
---
Swf is still way harder to deal with as a killer. Coming from both killers perspective and the perspective of a survivor who nearly always plays swf.
---
Or the killers who get salty just when I loop them (no tbagging or anything) then when they finally get you face camp you shaking their head like they out played you when you just looped them for 5 minutes straight.
---
You're stinky
---
And the devs don't think camping needs to be addressed lol.
---
But seriously, these have to be some of the genuinely laziest developers I have seen. They have taken no recent measures to drastically alter the game to be it fairer for both sides. They just keep making minor touches that barely do anything, and releasing dlc that is eaither trash or OP with no middle ground. At the very least the dlc should be fun for both sides, not just 1. Even when Myers has OP add-ons, hes extremely fun to play against, but he's just one of a few characters that are like that. It's not fun being tunneled by legion, camped by leatherface, speedhacked by wraith, or pseudo camped by hag or the pig. Killer wise, it's not fun to place as freddy and get rushed, or to play as trapper without OP addons and just get followed. The devs need to take a step back when balancing this game and find out what both sides enjoy, not just 1.
---
Lol they already added it in a PTB at one point ya dingus
---
Don't you have enough shards?  Would be good to buy him with those of you're unsure &amp; save the other for a licenced killer.
---
Cold dirt - dug

Frank's mixtape - played

Moonwalk courses - finished

Yep, it's dc time
---
Meg has not aged well..
---
That's interesting, I don't ever remember seeing that. TBH it would definitely be a great change for the game, I just don't have high hopes for this dev team. They just last month implemented a nerf to DS that they could have patched in like, a year and a half ago. Seems like either extreme laziness or a massive aversion to even the most minor of changes that could be reverted at a later date. I just hate game devs that are scared of making a single change to their game while the entire community bitches about problems and basically gets ignored
---
That killer win is only possible at high rank if you're playing a good killer like nurse or hillbilly. Tunneling is actually one of a low-tier killer's best tools. Now by tunneling, i dont mean downing and re-hooking. I mean slugging the survivor that was just unhooked and not re-hooking them and THEN going for the rescuer. Its actually a very good way of swinging the momentum of the game in your favor as another survivor now
---
has to get off a generator and come and pick up the survivor you just slugged. That kind of tunneling is actually pretty efficient and I recommend it to any killer who wants to win consistently.
---
"Reeee buff Legion or I will piss my pants!"
---
He was not outchasable, which made him hard to deal with
---
Imagine being so mad at a comment you need to tilt reply to a 3 day old thread.
---
Listen, here's my opinion on NOED in regards to its parallels with adrenaline, and how it relates to my original comment: both killers and survivors have a primary and supporting objective in the game. Survivors have to escape the trial, their primary objective, by doing generators, their supporting objective. Killers have to kill the survivors, their primary objective, by defending gens, their supporting objective. Adrenaline is a perk slot that momentarily rewards the survivors for completing their supporting objective, giving them an immediate health state, and a temporary burst of speed. Then the perk is used up and is useless for the rest of the trial, AND it exhausts you. NOED, on the other hand, rewards the killer for failing their supporting objective, giving them long term benefits in the form of a one hit down and a SUSTAINED speed boost, with literally 0 adverse effects. It is entirely designed to give killers who failed their supporting objective a long-term reward for playing poorly that has 0 drawbacks.
---
Took me awhile to find out that apparently if you're within the killer's red stain even slightly you'll be able to be hit
---
I am very fine with it if everyone else escapes
---
Meant to say shorter
---
Nice drawing - but only around a generous 4/10 for thiccness
---
Depends on the map and the platform. Plague's good all around. Maybe not as good as huntress when huntress has a good map, but that's the point.
---
I'm not suggesting huntress should suddenly gain 115% movement speed, no movement penalty when readying hatchets, and built in babushka. I'm suggesting that, if they're not going to do something about the map design, they should look into changing something small that would help her out *just enough* on her bad maps without making her absolutely insane on her dominant maps.
---
Like a fine wine
---
Woah, a baby Meg cleansing a totem instead of using their spring burst?!
---
It literally isn't, which means you haven't read it.
---
That's totally me.... D:
---
4/10 sounds good to me, as I'm only doing it for fun. 😄
---
Oh I understand now, thanks! Must’ve just got lucky before when it came off first go
---
Nah pyro. like 80-90% of scouts charm is his quips.
---
I'm still seeing people complain about being camped and tunnelled every game, here I am, a guy who plays DBD almost every day for hours and experience this maybe once or twice a day.
---
It really makes me wonder how many people on this sub aren't saying what's ACTUALLY happening in their games.
---
Well sometimes I let them farm sometimes I kill them where's the problem with that? Either having to wait for them to finish the gens and find the hatch or end it on the spot and jump into  a fresh game.
---
I LOVE THIS, AS A BRITNEY AND ADIRIS STAN
---
Yeet
---
My definition of winning as a killer is successfully sacrificing two or more individuals, the method does not matter as a kill is a kill. 
---
BP is not factored into this definition.
---
I think bc it would be to strong
---
How does no one know you have the ability to check if your opponent is SWF before and after the match?
---
Also the game's scare factor wears off after about five minutes. Killers aren't ever scary if they come after you, they're annoying and sweaty.
---
That would be nice
---
You are the bad guy, does not mean you are bad guy.
---
looks really great. is there any chance we'll get items/offerings as well?
---
Boy what a lyrical master. What'd it take, 15 seconds to write the one line that is that song? Oh wait no he also had to mention his own name too.
---
the most relatable post this bloodhunt. Bravo.  
---
Upvotes well deserved
---
Well supposedly console is getting some controller stick tweaks with the upcoming patch, so maybe that'll help with huntress. Haven't seen anything from anyone who tried it on the PTB.
---
As someone who played nurse a bunch before she was changed to have vertical blinks and less auto-aim, I'll tell you that precision isn't as much as an issue as the frames are. Some games you'll have a stable, relatively smooth framerate, but others you'll deal with constant drops while blinking. That coupled with the auto-aim loss killed her.
---
For me, anyway. I'll play her from time to time and do absolutely dog as her and get messages about how one of the survivors play nurse and do just fine. Good on them I guess, but I just can't do that anymore. Not against good survivors, at least.
---
Can I ask what rank survivor/killer you are?
---
Keep your hands of my NOED
---
I’d rather 2 kills=safety, 3 kills=equals 1 pip, and 4 kills before all gens are completed= double pip. A double pip should be harder to earn.
---
Tunneling is sometimes a good idea (e.g. on their last sacrifice and rescuer didn't take a hit for them), and sometimes not. You'll often get complaints though.
---
That said, if you have a billion second chance perks on, please don't complain. It's already more like trying to chop down an ironwood tree than kill a person with people with the most tryhard meta perk builds.
---
Can we talk about the hit through the window? Wtf was that?
---
Admitting defeat is the first step.
---
Boo hoo a survivor main that can't run loops and doesn't know how to counter BBQ, what's new
---
That's why I always derank to 11-13 before a bloodhunt, so you stay in the fun ranks during it. I always try to not kill people, just hook them twice and then let them leave. In order for it not to become boring for the survivors at that point, I still chase and down them, but I'm not hanging them the third time.
---
Everyone has been happy this way, I got many compliments and more bp were created. Also it's the most fun to play the game imo, tryharding is really anti-fun for both sides.
---
So just cleanse?
---
Posted because it was one of the most glorious escapes i’ve had in a while.
---
Chased me for 2 gens before giving up. Managed to hook light blue Claudette then went after the other one. I saved her then we did the last 3 gens whilst dark blue Claudette got chased and she got hooked just as we did the last gen.
---
he means as a killer's backstory, not making one of the survivors a killer
---
&gt;&gt;Gen rushing is fine
---
&gt;&gt;hex:ruin most used perk
---
Hmmm 🤔
---
Might remove too much of the outplay potential on the survivor side of things. I think having an audio and a visual indicator that your ass is about to be grass is fine. Admittedly it'd be a lot better for Institute, but on certain map tiles (like shack) it might be too much.
---
&gt; gives killers a disgusting advantage over survivors, of which they already have too many. 
---
You have no idea what you’re talking about. Get gud
---
I don’t use NOED lol
---
Can you elaborate? Why is the doctor so good in generating BP and why can he counter taunting? I played a few matches with him but from my point he is a very average killer. Certainly better then Cannibal or Trapper but also not as good as Spirit and Hag (my favorites atm)
---
Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
---
Yes, in fact hexes are gamebles. They can be the best perks in the game, but they can also be desteoyed. Noes, third seal, five stack devour hope... all the best perks. If your hex gets destoryed in the first 30 seconds, then not only did you loose your gamble, but now the killer is down a perk for the entire game. You keep calling me crap and bad at the game, because I use a good perk? Its hard enough trying to get any use from hexes at all, much less literaly no use at all. Stop DCing, it doesnt matter jf you face a camping leather face, staying on the hook is more time that the letherface is not downing other survivors. If they get downed for trying to save you, thats there fault. DONT DC. Why do I even have to say this?
---
The guy mains Freddy so he wouldn't know about a different perk on a different killer. Does that make sense?
---

Pharmacy is faster because 100% is healing someone else, but using a medkit on someone else or yourself are equal speeds which is faster than no medkit.
---
If you wanted to bring another item, I wouldn’t use pharmacy.
---
I didnt even DC against moonwalking legions with bugged addons. Some people are just pussies.
---
He’s afraid he’s gonna catch the gay.
---
I mostly play killer to get points quickly so I consider it a win once I get my 4 BBQ stacks lol.
---
Scariest moment in this game is when I play huntress and go to reload my axes and find a survivor in there that I did not expect.
---
I wish we could all get over the “This=Dc” mentality, it’s poor sportsmanship at best, totally pathetic at worst 
---
Don’t get me wrong, there’s things I hate playing against but I’m not gonna quit a match over it
---
What app did you use? Sorry if I am a bit late to ask.
---
I can only speak to my own experiences of course, but I’ll use yesterday as an example. I’d say 75% of the killers tunneled &amp; approximately 30% camped. That, in addition to the other survivors intentionally running the killer to me or not saving from a hook for no legitimate reason has destroyed my hope for this game.
---
can't you sprint to get your teammate to stop healing you?
---
It is really not that big a deal. It is so easy to work out if a killer has BBQ. If they hook someone and either magically appear by the gen your working on across map or they wound someone quickly after hooking then they probably have BBQ. All you have to do is when the killer picks someone up is jump in a locker and when the survivor is hooked count to 6 to be safe and get out your fine. Either that or get in the killers terror radius, which you should be anyway if your going to unhook your teammate, and again your fine. 
---
It really isn't that bad a perk and the devs won't do anything to it because the lockers blinding you from it was a big enough nerf. Just keep trying you will get used to it and find its no more annoying than Ruin and its easy to play around, if you struggle that much just grab Distortion as that will hide you early game but most of all it tells you a killer has BBQ so if you play smart you can save your other 2 tokens throughout the game to use late game and smash a gen without the killer having a clue.
---
Exactly, it’s not just an “anti tunnel” perk. You can still somewhat decide how to use it and use it strategically.
---
That's the thing! I notice they rake in way less BP when they go the tunnel-and-camp route, so in the end while it's annoying I can't help but see them shooting themselves in the foot a bit.
---
What Rank was he?
---
I was trying everything but it kept initiating, not sure if lag or not. By the time I'd managed to get them to stop the killer was heading over and I was downed shortly after. That few seconds would have been crucial for me.
---
sounds like a painful experience, I normally swf with a friend or 2 but whenever I solo I get the dumbest teammates.
---
I think it's more that having a killer with 115% movement speed with a ranged attack that can function as a free STBFL would be a little overtuned. There would be almost no reason to not play her over any other 115% killer if she had that speed, minus billy.
---
I should clarify that my post was intended to mean that these status effects should be applied when they're at full sickness.
---
I mean, I was in that game,(Rank 7) and you did camp pretty much whole game. At the end you tunneled him right off the hook, and thats when he started t-bagging. I agree he shit talking wasnt necessery but he didnt deserve the tunnel cuz he looped you on one pallet that you bloodlusted for 2 minutes. Also you were proxy almost whole game so i wouldnt say you ONLY camped Him for t-bagging.And for the daily ? You just got Bhvr'd.
---
Server side tied to your psn info.
---
And that’s ... reliable? 😬
---
Ace in the hole
---
Most people use BBQ&amp;C for the BP, sure the aura reading is nice but it doesn’t help when you play a slow killer like Freddy unless they haven’t moved an inch
---
Yeah, basically. :c I mean even with a swf I haven't been listened to re: Myers perks in particular, but solo is just the worst because often when a mistake is happening you just have to watch it unfold and hope for the best. Oftentimes solo queue is pain. 
---
I do try to read language though, if someone keeps moving they probably don't want to be healed and I'd leave them alone, and I say that playing support Quentin half the time.
---
 I think dat if you do it to fast it might not work but lag could be also a problem
---
Oh ok
---
hahahaha I go for the easier kill. I mean unless its like the only person that hasn't been hooked yet. I HAVE to hook all 4 at least once, its the golden rule
---
Me, who hates playing this game with other people - always runs bond so I know where everybody around me is so I can coordinate things and so I can cut the killer off to take hits if they need me to 
---
Killer - “is this survive with friends?”
---
That window's had clipping issues for a few months
---
Face camping is a scummy play that ruins another player's enjoyment. That's where the correlation is.
---
Sure, secure the kill after gates are powered, but if you face camp because you're butthurt at being unable to catch survivors fast, then that's a dick move.
---
Yeah you beat me too it but a club/rafe level would be pretty cool, especially if they added more skins like the stick light dwight ones
---
Plus I could yell panic at the disco everytime the match starts
---
11/10 idea
---
My feelings in words oml.
---
There've been several Killer main comments immediately jumping on the dOn'T TeAbAg ThEn train, when I have never done that believe it or not. Because I know how irritating it can be, I do my best to have a GOOD GAME whenever I can for myself and the Killer. Their goal is to grab me, my goal is to get out and away. I know damn well I'm no Monto or Noob either. Whether it's cos I'm console or just genuinely suck ass sometimes, I have no idea how they juke so well and 360 and make it look so *easy* aside from practice, I guess. I don't teabag, I don't even run any 'toxic' perks that are milked sometimes to make the Killer's life as miserable as possible like BT, MoM, Deliverance, etc.
---
I just know if I tried to step out of my comfort zone (this one that makes me wanna bash my head in) and dabble in Killer to change things up, I'd end up getting red-faced and sweaty-palmed even more. Especially since I have only ever played Killer once in all my time of owning the game. I know it's a learning curve but I'm strangely shy about it.
---
a party
---
Still farming, you just get a minor speed boost before you get downed again
---
More than likely tomorrow
---
I was not expecting to be turned on by this subreddit. Thanks buddy.
---
\-Bi boi
---
IKR I bring it to every game and it usually gets used. People just dont want to adapt to the new one
---
Nice
---
endgame collapse came early huh
---
Yep, one of the issues that flys under behaviors radar unless we killers scream about it
---
The new one is pretty good!
---
I actually love when survivors know what they are doing. When 1 is sacrificed and still no gens done it's boring
---
I mean yes she could have been hooked but it's a lot better than just standing there waiting out the timer.
---
hahaha holey shit, how did he not dc tho... must have rage control made of steel.
---
My bad i missed one health state. Don't know what's your point tho because what you're basically saying is it need 1 more hit AKA it waste even more time that i initially said, and that it ruin killer's momentum even harder.
---
More reliable than saving everything client side where it can very easily be hacked and manipulated.
---
If she jumped through a window and got sprint burst with no scratches it's probably Dance with me + Lithe.
---
Don’t forget the “Hex: thrill of the hunt” poppin up on your screen and a heartbeat immediately following it
---
“Oh motherfucker”
---
Either lie or ignorant. 
---
It was acknowledged a while ago that Nurse not being affected by MOM is in fact a bug.
---
Which mean that she will also be impacted by it in the incoming update.
---
Just wait to see even more Billy than before in the near future.
---
Jane Romero totally got an Angelina Jolie vibe with that smile.
---
yeah, i run behind a hurt guy to the exit and "toxic swf"
---
In my opinion, as long as they build maps while considering how Huntress will play them out specifically, I'd be fine with her staying at  4.5m/s.  
---
As she is now, I'd say around half(or even more) of the maps hinder her. A year ago, I would've said that buffing her to 4.6m/s would make her way too powerful, as the majority of the maps complimented her.  
---
Playing Huntress on most maps is just annoying at this point. Because you know you can't do much about them.
---
Plague is still, however, weaker than Huntress. Huntress has her insane snowballing potential.  
---
While Huntress is a pretty balanced killer on her good maps, her bad maps completely gut her, which is why I say that if they fix maps and build them with Huntress in mind, she'd be fine, but as it stands now, buffing her movement speed to 4.6m/s wouldn't be too gamechanging.  
---
The humming is completely fine even though it makes some structures a nightmare, imo.
---
I’ve been on vacation and when I got back yesterday I decided to play to see me through the jet lag. Moris, Prayer Beads, Insta-Saws, Tombstone Piece’s, Camping, Iridescent Heads, DC’s... thank god I only saw 1 day of this event.
---
Dead by Smilelight lmao
---
I always feel a bit bad as Killer when, after hooking someone and moving to walk away and go kick a gen or something, I immediately hear the unhook sound. Turn around and go back, oh hi there person I just hooked, sorry bout this! *smack*
---
Who talked about NOED ? (Which can be removed even before it get in play btw)
---
Who said it was also not problematic ?
---
Both need to go, but heh, toxic teenagers always loved this kind of cheesy and unhealthy mechanics.
---
Hence why it remain in the game since release.
---
The game is fun. It's just...extremely aggravating as well in the same breath. 
---
God damn paradox video game.
---
Thank you so much for answering! 
---
I think I'll give her a try.
---
Honestly, it seems like you can magnet on to the hook from accross the map xD. But on a more serious note, they should, I feel like I get 99% wiggle meter a lot and then the killer just magnet hooks and I'm like whelp.
---
Survivors: Uses 4 second chance perks
---
BHVR: I sleep
---
Killers: Uses two anti healing perks to increase healing time by around 8 seconds at uncommon situations
---
BHVR: Real shit
---
Are they active as long as they are sick? Or for a short duration?
---
Holy crap dude, how is it possible to just be so *dense*?
---
It becomes teachable after you reach lvl 30.
---
I'm glad these standoffs will disappear soon
---
How about naked Ash?
---
Who needs Shirtless Myers when you can have Naked Ash?
---
Someone explain, is SWF bad?
---
I like your thinking 😉

Let me correct him.

They already tried it once and it definitely mustn't happen.

That's pretty much what it used to be.

---
Ruin doesn't cost money though... Lol
---
The cAshual wood hand is already an option *but you already probably knew that*
---
That’s why if they don’t understand that I want to farm I eliminate them from the game asap. I don’t need to waste the time to complete 5 gens just to make a person understand. If you don’t want to farm I’ll kill you (or at least I’ll try). The best advice is to understand if survs want to farm as soon as possible, to know what to do next

Yeaaah, the issue with many of the cosmetics listed here is that there would be overlap between hand cosmetics. The only one exempt in the list is the Future Ash, where he would have a regular, flesh and blood hand.
---
Maybe they could sell them for cheaper and just sell the upper body and lower body of the outfits?
---
Use the interactions, pointing or calling, they are stopping the healing animation and you can move.
---
It seems like we need a goal other than doing gens to balance out the game. Something that isn’t holding down M1.
---
Understandable, I do that myself, but they're the 2 last guys in the game as you can see :)
---
The lore runs deep with this one
---
as long u dont delete the psn account your progress will be saved,u can unistall the game as many times you like
---
Oh sorry. 3-6%.
---
If u get shit on by Wraith, then maybe re evaluate your own play style... just a thought
---
There's no such thing as gen rushing. Just killers who can't apply map pressure.
---
Well I mean technically their right. U did win by completing the gens in a quick manner. That’s kinda the survs objective...
---
"Just crouch" its super common for Hags to proxy and just go check often enough where crouching is way too slow.
---
Similar to Pig add ons? I’m down with that
---
Not gonna lie, it was my first game back as killer after a month or so hiatus.  They had no excuse. I had corn blindness as motherfucker. I was missing swings left and right
---
Honestly, if they made it so that if a survivor is in the dream transition, they cannot interact with anything with a progress bar, he would get a lot better.
---
I haven’t been playing lately. What happened?
---
Lol. Similar happened to me. 3 month hiatus with Freddy. 3k.
---
Most probably dodging the red bar, high ping can fuck you up.
---
Well I knew Nea and the doctor are a dlc on PC I just didn't know about the other one
---
Not "bad" per say as it provides an advantage. The game intentionally avoid ways of standard communication, hence the lack of a voice chat in the game, the only real ways is by gesturing and tea bagging to some extent. SWF completely disregards that due to external programs like Discord, so you're at a bigger advantage than the Killer, a well coordinated SWF can destroy any hope a Killer has of winning.
---
I’m thinking he doesn’t
---
I hate it when I’m hooked and Meg is crouching near the hook until the struggle phase and decides to unhook me in front of the killer and he instantly downs me because no borrowed time and Meg sprint bursts away
---
'just a little bit' an intellectual
---
Yes fucking please
---
\*Laughts in Blood Warden\*
---
I only really take offense to people who literally wait at the gate just so they can teabag me. They could have left but they chose to wait 10 minutes while I was facing a corner in the basement hoping they'd fuck off and leave already because I saw them with blood warden. (I love how it lets you know if they're waiting at the gates.) 
---
Then they chose to sit here and humiliate me for about 15 seconds. Then rub salt in the wound in post-game chat.
---
Legion is much better for the game with their rework. Legion also got a buff(as long as you weren't using Frank's Mixtape).  
---
The Pig's trap changes are okay-ish, besides traps not activating after EGC starts.  
---
EGC looks great! While not too many people will get to experience the whole thing, it's a really nice QoL improvement and the hatch closing mechanic was implemented pretty well.
---
Hoax, you are just really lucky or have deliverance
---
Want me to show you the rest of his replies?
---
no deliverance, i dont have Adam
---
Again, I have run it for weeks. I've had it work on a Billy further than a pallet away actively trying to avoid it and a Legion doing the same thing. It goes off when it feels like it and it fails when it feels like it.
---
You can try to pump out paragraphs of frame perfect interactions you THINK work and don't but that doesn't make the perk less broken or less in need of a fix.
---
I WANT to run it for fun, but as it is I stand by what I said. Don't run it until the devs fix the broken, untested junk perk they pushed to the live build before getting it working.
---
I know, right? If I see their auras in the gate sitting there I know to go into the basement and face a corner.
---
If they wait that long, I'd get pissed off too.  
---
This is why EGC is getting implemented though, to stop survivors from holding the game hostage.
---
Yeah, I guess. 
---
(Still, you started it, that’s not very cash money of you)
---
Hmmmm i wonder what phrase is used to nick name “survivors doing gens at a set speed” 🤔
---
Indeed
---
Sounds like mostly only good things are coming from this then, thats great!
---
Technically they're not holding the match hostage because I can chase them out, I still think it's an extreme dick move and am looking forward to EGC because they can't wait there forever.
---
There's the [Sky Pack](https://twitter.com/datgeistra/status/1118292376810872833?lang=en) by Geistra and Happy Clown's Colored Icons which I can recommend.
---
4 kills before all gens are completed are you fucking mental, have you never played killer?
---
yea.. I missed it too.. only getting  a game /day for daily
---
Small Game, Plunderer's Instinct, Spine Chill, Dark Sense= Ez Win
---
It's a meme title about a video game lmao. I'm so sorry I deceived you on this so important subject. You can still fuck off at any time.
---
I forgot to mention it, but infinite loading screens and non-4v1 games should be fixed too!  
---
Great patch overall imo.
---
Did the match end normally? What if the game didn't count her as sacrificed and end up making you stuck there.
---
Don't even think about using Auto-Fire, or the entity will know!
---
I think he tried to use you as bait
---
Here's an idea. Sacrificial Lamb: If you are on the hook and the killer is within 24 meters of you, all survivors get 15/20/25 percent boost to repair speed. That way killers that camp the hook whenever there's gens to protect will be further punished
---
looks good, thanks!
---
Survivors are the same, they blame killers for everything when they lose.
---
I know a survivor who said : " I will DC every time I face a Nurse, so she can't get a BBQ stack on me", I mean, WTF ?
---
Btw, 4 minutes matches are a myth, they never happen ... .
---
Don’t trust russians. Ever.
---
The tunnel with the Mori at the end of it had me in tears laughing.
---
Deja Vu, Detective's hunch, Vigil and Buckle Up = gg
---
Thats good, how are the dedicated servers. I heard the hitboxes are worse? Or are people overblowing this?
---
Those are just dumbass survivors legit every killer is talking bout gen rush is toxic n shit
---
Kobe'ing is 100% luck.  
---
It's impressive if you kobe 10 times in a row, but it isn't when *someone* does - if you'd (only) play thousands of games with tens of thousands of kobe attempts there's a decent chance of you seeing someone who kobes even more than that.
---
I had to think for a second because my mind was trying to read NOES as "No One Escapes Seth"
---
Always stay positive
---
The match didn't end normally at the beginning. I let the remaining survivors escape and nothing else happened. After some time the Meg player got DC'd and then the match ended.
---
remember when everyone was complaining that you can simply play like shit and grind to rank 1?
---
this system worked tho, because better players were more likely to right up there
---
well now they made it require more pips to rank up the higher you are
---
everyone stays in green/purple ranks now, basicly matchmaking no longer works, because all skill levels are mixed together and games are unbalanced as fuck because of that
---
Masterpiece
---
I just want to be able to decline being unhooked. I got farmed by another survivor three time's yesterday. 
---
Shit needs to stop.
---
That's correct. She's the most balanced killer there is
---
DH, DS, MoM + Hope or DH, Open-Handed, Iron Will + Bond. (i also like running DH, Solidarity, Emphaty and Botany Knowledge a lot). But i love running fun builds like Boil Over, Flip-Flop, Unbreakable + Tenacity (with a Lerys or The Game offering), Iron Will, Urban Evasion, Premonition + Spine Chill (even if i hate seeing immersed survivors, playing immersed is fun), Open-Handed, Bond, Kindred + Plunderer's Instinct (a built that rely on aura reading is hella great), Lithe, Q&amp;Q, DwM + Lightweight (it's amazing how you can escape so easily from the killer) or Spine Chill, Resilience, DH, Hope (great for looping the killer, especially at the end with that 22% vault speed)
---
think of the BP Economy, man.
---
Rank 5 is the new rank 1
---
And yet you can always spot hillbilly's default hair miles away
---
First bloodhunt for me, was so disappointed
---
"BRAH?"
---
DID YOU JUST ASSUME MY GENDER? I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT I IDENTIFY AS AN APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTER AND MY PREFERRED PRONOUN IS "AH-64"
---
Thing is by trading hooks at the end we gave them a stack of their BBQ plus at least double more points then they would have got if the 3 of us had just left. They easy threw 60K points away.
---
I mean I was a rank 3 killer before the last reset and was getting a decent amount of 4ks with between 1-3 gens left.
---
Maybe the realised that they get nothing from ranting in a stream chat and just went back to playing the game. Nice cheeky way to get more people coming to the stream tho
---
Maybe he's just a nice Michael. I was still on the floor when my 2 teammates finished the last gen. Michael killed another Dwight and the Meg just left. Michael brought me to the gate. My stupidity might have saved me.
---
I only play dbd a few times a week, but I'm somehow rank 3 surv and could probobly get rank 1 if I cared. is it really that hard to rank up? I still get pips even witouth surviving.
---
Usually all the content (in this case endgame) that gets put on the PTB goes live on all platforms two weeks after the intial PTB release, so it's very likely we'll see the endgame update tomorrow for PS4.
---
They're still testing dedicated servers internally atm and there's bugs on the PTB they still have to fix for them so won't see them till   the Summer probably
---
Oh, my sweet summer child. This is just the beginning.
---
I’ll take two number 9’s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, two number 45’s one with cheese and a large soda

that's what i'm here for. &lt;3
---
This is frightening.
---
My bad i read wrong, i understood before any gens are completed xD, thank you for making me re-read the comment.
---
Fucking english read, read or read you will never know how i said them.
---
there is only one way, u know...
---
Army of darkness ash
---
Oooooooof
---
I'm a hardcore killer main, And even i can't comprehend how BHVR have not added in a feature to refuse being unhooked. It's probably been the most requested feature after they added unhooking from multiple directions.
---
The lag in my region at times makes it difficult if someone is also pressing buttons. I was trying to do just that, the thing is, they should have picked up on the perk midway into the game and not done that.
---
You can find survivors well by listening to them scream after getting hit, the direction the scream is coming from is where they're going.  
---
You can also use blood, scratch marks, grunts, footsteps and breathing to tell where the survivors is.  
---
The best tracking perk I'd recommend is Whispers, but that does no good in a chase. I'd recommend learning how to notice blood on the floor and listen to specific sounds to know where the survivors are. You learn those things while playing the game, and I'd not recommend wasting a perk slot on perks that help you do that.
---
Shes definitly not easy to loop if you are good, huntresses weakness are that shes slow and you get a good warning shes coming. Shes got great chase potential and snowball potential.
---
i agree on your stand point. In general i dont think this game should be try hard focused, its way more fun when everyone is goofing around.
---
And you can leave him on 30 unless you want dead hard because no mither will you off when you're looking for self care and such. It just sucks to have that perk even pop up
---
scroll through their friends list. But aint nobody got time for that
---
at least i got enough bloodpoints to level up my new main
---
my pink shirt Ace with glasses is the ultimate life form, he's so good that i even once got called "suicide clothes ace"
---
Now do it with killers.
---
Killer main here, I've never said that.
---
Oh, hell yes.
---
They’re edited so well
---
Dead Hard, We'll Make It, We're Gonna Live Forever, &amp; Distortion
---
Haha it’s all good man, happens to everyone!
---
2 of my friends and I got called a toxic swf group.. the one they were complaining about? Wasn't in the swf group.. And in fact I had stated on stream I felt bad for the killer, because it was suffocation pit, with the best window pallet layout.
---
If she’s using iridescent heads she’s up there with Legion on dc potential
---
Cries in Bill
---
Bloodhound would be most effective if you’re trying to track them through the chase and after you hit them. Nurses is only really gonna help if they’re bold enough to heal somewhat close to you.
---
No it isn't. It always launches 2 weeks after the PTB goes live. It went live on the 23rd, 2 weeks later would mean tomorrow on the 7th.
---
thats true she is a hard killer to learn and im not toxic when i see someone doing this typically i try to offer advice. Mostly im met with toxicity though.
---
exactly my predicament
---
Were you on PC?
---
Monto did a video a few days ago....blame him!
---
You start with Dwight, Claudette, Meg, Jake, Nea and David for survivors, and Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse and Huntress for killers.
---
Empathy, Autodidact, Spine Chill, and any for a white mage build. It's an awful Park if you can't get your Stacks but empathy helps a lot. Once you have all five hitting a skill check will advance the heal it by 50%. And with spine chill you almost always finish the heal if the Killer is coming
---
Opinion: No she isn't as long as I get damaged while the hatchet isn't even close to physically hitting my body.
---
F
---
No clue. Ik there is a bug atm that disconnects players it happened to me a couple days ago but this sounds like he did it on his own
---
I did get a spook from Pig a few weeks ago.  I had Empathy on and saw her chase someone into the iron works, so I started working on my gen and watching the other person's aura. Based on how erratically they were running I was convinced she was still chasing them. Rotate my camera and she's crouched right next to me, just about to lunge.
---
Simply getting some kills shouldn’t be encouraged. That’ll just promote tunneling and camping further. Killers need to also get in chases, kick generators, and keep map pressure.
---
You fuck up your arguments when you speak in absolutes. Maybe reddit "killer mains" think this way, but the vast majority of us do not. Gen rushing isn't real. Just like "kill rushing" isn't. If you're injured I'm knocking you down. This isn't a duel, I'm here to sacrifice you to my spider husband.
---
Why does it matter? He's asking for help. If you don't want to help him ignore him and someone else will. Not everyone knows as much in this game as you. I didn't know the perk either
---
Gen jockeys.
---
I can never seem to hear them like everyone else for some reason so I defiantly need something visual, I'll see how using whispers goes :D
---
Imagine taking a reddit clip seriously
---
I doubt that considering all of the sandbaggers
---
I've never seen a killer say that. In fact, I actually see survivors saying it more: "lol this is toxic, love it."
---
scout dont care, saxton would just punch EVERYTHING, and wveryone else would still find a way
---
Accurate. Every Nurse I encountered throughout the event did not give a damn about anyone's experience but their own. Between the common occurrence of a Nurse along with infinite loading screens dcing myself or my teammates I pretty much stopped using offerings.
---
Knowing about the tall grass would help a lot, that's one of my biggest struggles with scratch marks. With nurses level 3 would you be able to see them even if they're far away? :D
---
&gt;Adrenaline is more than fair, it’s an investment in success. NOED is an investment in failure.
---
NOED is an investment in pressuring the survivors so much they felt they couldn't afford to cleanse. And if they could have cleansed, but deliberately didn't, that is them wanting to be rewarded for "failure."
---
NOED is 100% under survivor control. They control if it activates, when it activates, and how long it stays active.
---
Hell, your very own defenses of OP survivor perks apply: if they have counterplay (not tunneling, "playing around,") they don't deserve complaints.
---
Unique "BAWNK" and "I'm a freakin' blur here" voice lines for using DS and Exhaustion perks respectively
---
Do you have a headset? If so, it's just about learning to listen to the specific sounds.
---
Unfortunately that's the only way to get them out. Even then they're just gonna wait as much time as possible to rescue them. Hopefully end game collapse will fix this. It's kind of dumb how the other 3 go full heal and come back, borrowed time, and body block. At some point altruism becomes overkill.
---
It's sad, but true. Was in a SWF (3 man), and was getting over to a buddy on a hook to save him safely. Out of the corn comes a David sprinting with the killer behind him just so he could unhook.
---
Honestly my only problem with this perk is it's ability to counter white wards. You brought an offering that allows you to take the item you die with. But fuckface made you drop it before he hooked you so now you get to waste a Purple offering AND a Rare item
---
Literally most fucking BALANCE game so far.
---
it seems hard but you get used to it trust me i know i used to never hit them with the addon that make the skillcheck bigger and know i don't use the addon anymore and can at least get 1 of 2 sometimes perfect. it requires alot of concentration
---
You played Freddy, what did you expect, seriously ?
---
Some people live to bully others, you need to ignore them, ignoring someone who try to piss you off is the worst thing you can do to him.
---
player level devotion
---
Honestly i think Plague could use a rework, what counterplay do survivors have vs corrupt purge other than denying the power in the first place (which is bad design if you ask me)? 
---
Yes you can use tall structures to loop her but the moment you need to vault/throw down a pallet to avoid getting M1'd she can just cheese you with corrupt purge.
---
The power is very easy to use and IMO way too strong for the (no) skill required, you don't need to aim it, if they get close enough you can M1 like a regular killer, if they vault anything it's a free hit. The moment someone cleanses themselves it's game over for survivors.
---
Hey can you link me to his separate comment? Thanks!
---
Ye I always got my headset on, I'll be sure to teach myself and listen out for the sounds :D
---
oh yah sub to my teotch im live streame rby the way sub to my teitch
---
I am not sure you was in my game. My daily was to do a 4 hits to survivors with maximum effect of sickness and I didn’t care about kills. When I saw someone I tried to get a kill. I never tried to camp or tunnel anyone because it was against my daily task. I even never saw that guy before all gens were done. He teabagged me at pallet and it took around 4 minutes to finally down him, then I hooked him and it was his first hook. Explain me how it is a camping or tunneling a person who even was not hooked before?
---
Even level 3 only has a 28 meter range. Most killers have a base terror radius of 32 meters, so they’d have to be bold enough to heal within that terror radius. At higher ranks when survivors are a little bolder it could have some viability but if you’re looking for actual tracking outside the chase I’d personally say Bloodhound is better.
---
Every fucking day...
---
If no one cleanses she's a perma tier 3 Myers against survivors making a bunch of noise puking with green clouds following them around. And she didn't even need to spend a minute staring at them beforehand!
---
That said, I think an exhaustion addon would be cool.
---
Not as painful as watching your ruin totem get cleansed.
---
I don’t have it on spirit st that tome, I do now
---
That's really the only time i'd ever equip it lol.
---
Imagine someone playing her with a hipshot dot tho
---
The worst people aren't the people farming off hooks, it's the killer that literally sees the dickhead farm a person and still tunnel him/her
---
It has been claimed that Resilience doesn’t increase vault speed anymore and hope are not supposed to increase vault speed too. Did you actually test that?
---
Thats the game’s fault, not the survivor’s
---
Listen to this guy BHVR.
---
Even when I pull it off it never fails that the killer finds me, smacks the gen and I get tunneled while my teammates crouch in a corner so the gen goes back to 0.
---
well don't tell that to me, I just wrote it down in computer font so it's more readable
---
Is now later? :)
---
But I just read that Nea and Nurse are a dlc tho. And on console David and The Huntress are dlc although they are free. I'm not sure why they don't just come installed
---
Awesome! This is a big help thank you! :D
---
I don't understand this image at all but I love it
---
Blindness is strong against solo survivors, it's weak just against SWF teams. Imagine a slugging build with that add-on ...
---
This makes no sense at all, you do NOT have to do anything to get the usage out of NOED and be rewarded for playing poorly, whereas survivors must put fourth genuine effort to get all of the gens done. 
---
One of these things should be easily counterable, and it isn’t adrenaline.
---
Now MoM:
---
Think DS has not been nerfed and ignore the obsession and hope nobody else has it. "Countered"
---
Use specific killers. "Countered".
---
Adrenaline is fine as it is as it rewards being able to loop the killer when there are few pallets left while others do gen, or doing gens while you are injured, which is risky. And rewards living to the end game.
---
I'd say the only crutches currently in the game are  Dead Hard and Noed and maybe MoM since you'll get it from every M1 killer if they don't kill you with the second hook. In my opinion. Dead Hard is fine since it gives you exhaustion and a comparatively small speed boost, but Noed gives you free instadowns for not being able to do your objecitve.
---
The only problems I have with it are the fact you get so many benefits you have to usually perk into simply by communicating first of all. Then secondly how you can be up against survivors much higher rank than you simply because one guy is rank 17 and then two are in red ranks with one in purple.
---
Meanwhile you're in green.
---
Matchmaking is horrible.
---
That said I still wont play vs a 4 toolbox team or if 2 or more of them bring flashlights because I play the hag.
---
&gt; so is very hard to actually snowball with her
---
Not in my experience. Every game with her, once survivors cleanse (which they will since i run the apple add on to force em to cleanse or get insta downed with corrupt cheese) it's game over for them. Stealth only goes so far vs a competent killer (you can hear survivor footsteps/grass moving/regular breathing etc).
---
Thats why nurse, billy, and spirit are great. They’re the only ones who actually can apply map pressure without giving up on chases constantly.
---
Sadly thats true, but what hurts it even more for me is that i used like 7 or 8 streamers and at least 4 got lost because someone dced mid loading screen. Never will use streamers as survivor again, pointless until they fix that shit
---
I dont get what that means?
---
I never called you an asshole I just think you're needlessly being harsh. Op was asking what a perk does and you didn't just say where it came from. You know this, you could have just helped them out or ignored them instead you call them out on their reasons for not knowing and it. Doesn't. Matter. That's all I'm saying and I think if you don't get that by now it will never happen so good luck.
---
I'm sorry, but what emblems did you get to de-pip with a 4k? I've actually never had that happen to me before. Usually when I 4k I get at least 4 golds, if not 3 and an iri.
---
I was with my group of SWF and asked the killer if he wanted to farm. He said "Nah fam" so we all went super sweaty and destroyed him. He was a baby nurse and was only able to hook one person once. He should have taken the offer.
---
I meant like a file to change the ingame look
---
Found the dumbass survivor
---
Honestly Jane and Kate are quaking right now
---
Entity just wants you to run around pallets for hours and then maybe kill the survivor. Its all about pallets
---
I honestly stopped playing for the event after day one. So many moris and dcs...
---
Lawl¿
---
oh ok
---
Once after a whole weekend of playing Killer, I went to work and outside was a pallet and my brain just went "break it" and I was like "No this is real life mate"
---
\*repeatedly teleprots behind u\*
---
nothin personnel kid
---
Survival rates for rank 20 survivors is about at 43% as well. Would an accurate representation of survivor rates across the 20 ranks look like a parabola then? It would be nice if we could get more information updates like this, ideally with some more graphs.
---
Also given that you only pulled from a week of data, are the killer selection rates still accurate? I have a hard time believing that Michael is so prevalent on the PS4 and not elsewhere. Also lastly, can we see perk win rates next time? That would be fascinating.
---
Sir please give me your luck. I haven't kobe'd in months (and not from my lack of trying).
---
I'd argue Jane is also okay, she looks like someone with a bit of an awkward smile but she doesn't want to be that one person not smiling in the photo so she does it anyway
---
"Myers chose eggshell white for his mask?"
---
- Legion and Shape comparing masks
---
How you can hear anything ? They fucked up sounds in the last patch.
---
And against competent survivors, you will not snow ball so easy. They know how to split up and use high walls loops against your Corrupt Purge.
---
Step 1: unhook every survivor in front of killer.
---
Step 2: always hide after so killer will see only unhooked survivor.
---
Step 3: blame killer for camping and tunneling.
---
(happened with me yesterday)
---
Unless you are doing adept, is a waste of time for both...
---
I'm in tears. I love the crying guy meme at the beginning (No idea what it's even from but I've seen it before.) and you perfectly captured how a Myers can go from being on the ropes to destroying a entire team. The dancing myers at the end was the cherry on top.
---
What’s the other option? Don’t do gens?
---
I’ve only hit the skillcheck when it was an insta-gen in 2016
---
Yesterday I got 3k and depipped.  No camping, no tunneling.  That's when I finally agreed that the ranking system is broken.
---
I am a big arguer that the ranking system is designed to tear down the hope off the survivors.  Show them what's what by hooking them multiple times, winning chases, and keeping the generators down for a long time.  But seriously?  3k and I'm not even good enough to keep my current rank?
---
You are very welcome, she isn't the best or easiest to use, but she is a ton of fun, you will definitely enjoy her
---
...I regret this.
---
this is very over complicated, could have just used a picture with everyone dead or a mori
---
‘Take of’
---
This is the thing that's problematic. You're not responsible for anyone else's "experience". This is a video game where two sides compete against each other. One is designed to kill, and the other works to avoid being killed. Neither survivors nor killers are tour guides or curators of certain experiences, so this attitude has major issues. 
---
Just as you're entitled to playing the way you see fit as survivor or killer, the same is afforded other players. Some players don't care about the points and want to just play as normal. There's nothing that says "hey guys it's bloodhunt so let's all just pause normal play and start doing everything that gets massive bloodpoints". That's the way you'd *like* it to go, and many others who could do with the extra bloodpoints, but forcing others to play the way *you* want them to through shame only serves to make you look like a petulant child.
---
I would be lying if I said I wasn't grinning ear to ear when I read that a maximum of 6% of player teams are 4 man swf. I wonder how " reddit killers " are taking this down.
---
Person in the basement chest was crouch walking around the map all game. This was my first hook by the way.
---
*hatchet hits floor* goes into dying state
---
I’ll still get hit even if she throws it straight up
---
That claudette fully blends in with the hook Holy shit

Nope. You will still get downed at some point because you shit teammate didnt want to wait 10 seconds before you got off the hook.
---
Thanks for reminding me. I hate that shit. I swear the game always autolocks onto a awake survivor, even if he's off to the side of the survivor you want to hit.
---
Calm Spirit  
---
Wait that's illegal
---
Only one Bloody Party Streamer was burnt. Fs in chat for the lad.
---
At least no one DCed?
---
rip my ears
---
I am not joking. They said this in a QA after Plague release that they thinking to give more effects to fully sickness survivors, but they give up, because survivors fun is more important than killers fun.
---
Forced farming isnt cool...
---
Plot twist; the entity is just a pallet disposal service.
---
I got camped and tunnelled because killers were salty about not being able catch me for several minutes in back to back matches yesterday. I mean sorry for outplaying you, I guess? I don’t know why I kept playing because I just got angrier each time until my boyfriend got home from work and told me to stop.
---
Well... sam still exists XD
---
I'm gay lol and I got turned on too!
---
Impact font memes niceeee
---
So they are stupid AF
---
I regularly have 5 gens left as Freddy. Freddy, the killer known for being best when all gens are done. It is easier than it sounds
---
Having gotten to rank 10 with plague, and then attempting to try other killers has made me want to quit the game, honestly.  
---
You get bullied so hard by SWF groups.
---
Low profile’s notification delay should be 1/1.5/2 for balancing reasons
---
Other than that I upvote

The most broken emblem of them all is the gatekeeper emblem
---
Ash: tall grass?
---
I hate this new system. Ending the game quickly should always reward you with 2 pips so you can get to the higher rank cuz you clearly don't belond here.
---
Apparently you gotta do more! I like that it's a struggle to get to red rank as killer. Just know when you do reach red rank you'll deserve and be a beast..
---
WHY IS MIACHEL SANS
---
Yes, but it's still worth it. If they have to save you with borrowed time, then the killer was probably camping in the first place.
---
I de-pipped as myers using Judith's tombstone and fragrant tuft of hair. I mori'd all 4.
---
ew what the fuck 😂 he kinda looks like my stoner uncle.
---
Oh well thanks for the help anyway you are very talented do you have a wallpaper version by anychance?
---
I’ll make it 1/2/2.5 but thanks for the critique and upvote.
---
I got a 32 million bloodpoint compensation for lost data and falsely banned of hacking, good times
---
[https://twitter.com/WholeyeetRye](https://twitter.com/WholeyeetRye) This dude makes some cool ones for killer and sur. Enjoy.
---
As doc if I'm spamming m1 in shock mode I win every hatch standoff.
---
Somebody didn't know how to hit great skillchecks, eh?
---
I myself didn’t teabag (and I never do), he never even saw the Nea (Obsession) as he had STBFL and the light blue Claudette went down instantly when he found her and she was with me after that the entire time. Maybe the other Claudette did but to be honest he was bloodlusting around safe pallets and I think he was maybe just pissed that he got looped so much.
---
I agree. I used to hate going up against the billy. But then I became a billy main. Now I'm excited af whenever I get in a billy match as survivor because I can predict how they are going to play a lot better than other killers.
---
The best way, for me (Rank 8), is turning around something big
---
Better to slug the 2nd to last survivor until you found the last guy
---
Had a wraith DC on me last night because three of us body blocked him from hitting the injured game on her way out. It was even more funny because he kept body blocking vaults while invisible throughout the game. I don't know if the others were in a SWF but I wasn't. Made me laugh
---
I think the actual goal of the **game** gets forgotten sometimes so people resort to The Sweat™️. And then of course all the fun just gets sucked out of it because everyone ends up getting punished :(
---
I don't play because I particularly care for pipping or ranking or farming; it's a pass-time, until suddenly someone has to turn it into a chore. It's a shame, because rather than getting to kick back and shoot the breeze for a bit online I end up more tense than I was before.
---
Dear Killer mains who chose to tunnel mori during this event: Fuck you.
---
Honestly I'd rather face a hillbilly than the other meta killers like Hag and Spirit those two can really be a pain 😫 if they're good.
---
yeah, there's a reason i used to get tipsy exclusively to play this game. it made me care less when people played like shitbirds.
---
now that i've quit drinking i'm trying not to care in general, not that it always works 🙃
---
Oh for sure, Billy is pretty easy to dodge once you get a feel for their play style.
---
That plague doctor outfit is sexy af
---
Set no.1
---
Np &lt;3 first time giving it out lol.
---
the only seasons worth watching are Murder House and Asylum imo.
---
Or he have no time to run away from hook
---
"Have you heard about our Lord and Savior, The Entity?"
---
You're making a lot of assumptions. I kind of thought it goes without saying, but of course people can play however they want, and I do not expect anyone to bend to another's will. I simply stated an observation that I found to be unfavorable to experience.
---
You will never see a r1killer if your survivor on your scoreboard, its a bug
---
Ace in the hole plunderers pharmacy and then adrenaline or balanced landing
---
The most interesting thing about this post is the way you censored the text.
---
Truly a classic. I hook everybody twice, let them reset the game, and don't kill anybody. These survivors were potatoes. Survivor complains at the end of the game that ruin made the game unfun after I say gg and that it was fun chasing people. "Why did you run ruin if you weren't playing seriously and you were just having fun? Ruin made my game unfun." I'm not making this up. This is why everybody dies in my games now.
---
He look like jake lol
---
Sounds like all my matches ever
---
You got the roles mixed up lol
---
I was wondering why I keep getting paired with super difficult killers. I've only recently started playing and have managed to rank up fairly quickly as a survivor, but only because I try to do a bit of everything each game. The problem is that I'm still bad during chases, suck at using pallets, and don't have all the top tier perks yet. I feel like those things are all kind of crucial against higher rank killers because they pull out all the stops and can easily take you down in a matter of seconds otherwise. It would be nice to be paired with killers that aren't like 5 ranks above me, but I guess practice makes perfect no matter who I'm playing against.
---
Bloodhunt helped boost my rank 6 levels in one day
---
I’ve been sad recently and you guys made me a bit happier, thank you guys!
---
Suprisingly Legion was picked in 12.83% of all matches at rank 1 on Xbox. This is significantly lower than the highest pick rates at rank 1 on other platforms. (Highest rank 1 pick rate on PS4 is 16.07%, and 22.39% on PC)
---
So if it was just one guy, he plays *a lot.*
---
Bing bong mains arise
---
But its not about killing quickly and effectively (like a red rank should be doing) its about keeping the survivors alive long enough without them working on enough gens to get all the emblems
---
This should be reworked for safe hooks only, besides taking a hit.
---
One game I was literally just running to the first gen and a pig just jump right at me and scared the crap outta me then later on it happened again and that pretty much ended that match
---
4 survivors joined the match at the exact same time. Popped 3 seperate gens at the exact same time within the first 2 minutes of the game. 3 escapes, 1 hook. Pretty sure it was a SFW
---
Those builds sound really fun, I'm gonna have to try them out! I usually play decently immersed myself, but I also feel like overly scared players give it a bad name...
---
And honestly I freaking love Hope, increased vault speed or not. It's just really good for that extra speed boost that lasts longer then Adrenaline. Adrenaline might give you a heal, but usually other teammates will do it for the BP, or people have a Medkit/Self Care.
---
No, they never have to do it, they just do it because borrowed time
---
6th token is too broken imo. Just removed it so it can be more balanced I guess
---
Why you mad though?
---
YES!
---
Can't wait.  Hatch standoffs are such a lame way to end games.
---
Stop getting caught first.
---
Oh
---
Needs 'The Game' map as an offering
---
Well if you think like that I can say it’s the survivors job to unhook people too?
---
That change is coming in the end game collapse patch.
---
You'll no longer get WGLF stacks from unsafd hooks.
---
Rather face a billy opposed to a one-shot huntress
---
Interest generator image on whatever Squidward is holding
---
So everyone is shouting selfcare...  my best advice to you is learn to play without selfcare. It's so nice not wasting time healing because it takes a long time and it frees up a perk spot for better perks. Either run a medkit or have your teammates heal ya... it's way more fun play style and you dont get the mentality that you have to be healed fully before you can do anything. I've played with people who cant function in the game without being healed which is annoying just get on a gen. Someone will come your way eventually and they can heal ya. 
---
You leveled up meg so you have adrenaline make sure that's in all of your builds. It's a life saver in the end and a little award for making it to the end of the game.  Megs balanced landing is a good perk also.
---
Level up David for deadhard, get laurie for ds because killers tunnel  way to often and it gives you a second chance. 
---
Jake has ironwill which is good to run especially if you arent running selfcare it makes it so you dont cry when you're hurt. I ran that for a while after not using selfcare it's cool. 
---
NEA has urban evasion which helps you sneak around and you dont leave track Mark's. 
---
Feng has alert very good perk for detecting where the killer is I ran this all the time. So anytime the killer kicks a gen or destroys a pallet you get a notification and you see their aura.. which is cool so you kno how far away they are of you should stay on a gen or leave.  ALERT IS AWESOME AND DOESNT GET THE LOVE IT DESERVES. 
---
Once you get those perks you'll be set.  I'd recommend getting ash for his amazing perk mettle of man. It let's you get 3 times before going down. Killers hate this perk but dude its saved my ass so many times. 
---
All the survivors have cool perks you can play around with them once everyone is to 40.
---
Thats what we wanting!!!
---
It doesn't need to be addressed though, if a killer just camps their very first victim then thats a free pass for the rest of the survivors to do gens and get out, punishing the killer for their choice.
---
If the survivors are dumb and don't take advantage of a killer's camping then its entirely on them.
---
my first bloodhunt has been great, i have never seen so many party streamers. and i manage over the weekend to grind around 4 mio bloodpoints because 40% of my lobbies was game for farming. but then higher the rank the more sweaty the games get.
---
It's impossible to hit red ranks as SOLO survivor, most of the games you lose 1 player in the loading screen and then more people suicides after, or people just dc after getting knocked once.  
---
Not only that but you can do all the work to win and barely pip.
---
According to recent data released by BHVR, hag has a 66% kill rate, the most from all the killers.
---
It's not a fair game tho, because the only people that play hag are those who actually can use her right.
---
As a hag main, damn she's able to dominate
---
WAAAAH!!!!
---
As an avid feng min main I didnt even realize the hearts were right on her nips until a friend pointed it out last month. Guess that's what being in a relationship does to ya- you stop noticing this stuff.
---
&gt; But when the new "normal" means DCing, rare add ons and NOED all the way, then i'll be out sooner or later.
---
DC'ing is a matter of someone being a piss-whiner because they got killed or they feel jipped. Rare add-ons and NOED is just a straight up "get over it" thing. There are ways to play around add-ons and perks, particularly NOED, though I'll never quite understand why everyone gets so massively butthurt about a powerful end-game perk. A killer is doing something that makes him strong, and people throw tantrums about it. It seems to be most complained about in low ranking games, where the survivors aren't that experienced.
---
My main argument is if we can say to killers "you don't have to 4k to pip. ranking up is the point isn't it?" when referencing survivor gameplay and items/add-ons, then we damn sure can say "you don't have to escape to pip. ranking up is the point isn't it?" to survivors when they complain about getting snagged by NOED at the end of the game.
---
&gt; You can't deny that a 3 blink nurse is OP.
---
Of course 3 blink Nurse is strong, though I'd rather have catatonic and ataxic.
---
&gt; Nurse in general is already the strongest killer, even without it
---
Of course she is. She ignores pallets and windows, the survivors' bread and butter. Map tiles are already too strong, giving survivors total control in a match if they have more than 2 brain cells. The Nurse represents someone that can ignore that and *actually be the power role for once*. Nurse doesn't feel fair to play against because she does what killers should have been doing since the start of the game; mercilessly hunting down survivors and destroying them. The same goes for Legion. Legion ignores pallets and windows, and like Nurse, catches up to survivors quickly. I'll be the first to admit the deep wounds rework is a very necessary one, but the point remains the same.
---
&gt; And if you pick the strongest killer and equip the strongest add ons and the strongest perks, do you really expect survivors to stay in the game?
---
Yes? I'm sorry, is there a thing somewhere that I missed that says you can't always run strong setups, that you have to weaken yourself every now and then? How silly of a concept is that? In what world do you *ever* play a game where two sides are competing against each other and throw a tantrum because someone is using something optimal or "meta"?
---
*Gee guys I've played a lot of Nurse today. I better play some trapper just to make sure people have a chance to beat on me a little so they can be happy.*
---
Seriously... That has got to be the most entitled-child-silver-spoon bullshit I've ever heard.
---
Of course I expect survivors to stay in the game. Killers stay in the game with the retardedly strong map tiles, dead hard, adrenaline, SWF, BT, insta-heal, decisive strike, and are expected to deal with it. Why can't the same be said to survivors?
---
Lmao!! At least he is not a drunk uncle lol
---
See you in hot
---
Rather save these for mk11
---
Not a thing, but I can see why people say shit like that.  
---
You feel pretty useless when 3 gens pop at once.  
---
So yet another thing that makes players angry in this game.
---
It comes from both sides, unfortunately. If you don't go tryhard, you risk not gaining any bloodpoints due to the killer/survivors running their meta perks. 
---
Community considered, it is the smarter decision to just run the best perks in order to guarantee some significant bloodpoint gain.
---
I mean, why not both?
---
You can do all sorts to avoid this though.
---
Hide behind gens.
---
Bring Distortion 
---
Or just bring a movement perk, if you are able to loop the billy or get around a big surface that ensures he cannot attack you with his chainsaw without making it a mega ball ache for him is a good shout.
---
But in reality just because you find a killer difficult to counter does not mean they should be nerfed or BHVR should "do  something about" them there is a mirriad of resources that teach you how to counter the killers on the internet, the youtuber Painkiller makes very informative and respectful videos where he talks to you not at you on how to counter killers and get better at the game. 
---
Hope this advice helps.
---
tbh, I think that if billy was released now, he'd be released as a 110 mvspeed killer. His chainsaw is a mobility tool that could be used to deal damage. Looks similar to spirit.
---
Crystalize OP my dude
---
Huh.
---
Well that's pretty interesting, I haven't kept up with streams in a very long time so i missed the stats but it's pretty cool to see her making a rise.
---
You can’t claim something is OP when you have no statistics or observational fact to back it up.
---
**This is to all survivor mains*
---
He's the first killer I ever learned, so that's probably why I feel he's pretty easy. Everyone is different. I have friends who don't understand how I can be so dog shit at nurse because they find her easy.
---
Played a bunch. Some wait for survivors when I played killer but not bad. No moris. No tunnelling. Very little camping.  Several streamers. Very few DCs. Lots of points. So, I had fun.
---
Oh my God...
---
A small part of the onus is on the killer for choosing to go after only one survivor at a time.  I'm not saying continue unhooking right in front of the killer but the ones that don't understand they win by attrition only get one, maybe two kills.
---
Yeah I was confused when my friend told me that he had the huntress locked!! He plays on xbox
---
There's a worse one on the Nurse's map. no trees, no walls, no rocks, just standing there in the open
---
I was once accused of SWF by a piggy cause I had a trap on my head and after saving me off the hook the two team mates that were left lured piggy over towards the exit gates and then left obviously knowing my only hope was hatch. Luckily me and the Meg that unhooked me had done the usual hatch dance at the hatch about 5 mins before so I knew where it was.
---
I played against four SWF in a row. Three of them brought keys...
---
honestly, that too 😂 he knows how to have a good time haha!
---
It’s so annoying you basically just have to take the minus pip on the chin :(
---
That's the one I'm talking about...
---
my expectation and reality are the same. I expect to be tunneled and camped every game even if i do nothing and sit in the corner of the map.
---
That's the best looking Ash IMO.
---
ever since they got hard-nerfed i never see anyone bring them into games anymore anyway. not that i could hit the fucking skillcheck if i did bring one regardless lmao
---
I mean... yeah. But that has nothing to do with farming teammates lol
---
xD
---
Well, some players are just god tier naturally like you, so I guess everyone else should just git gud.
---
Survivors almost always get less bp than the killer, unless the killer manages to put 0 pressure, gets almost no hooks and kills.  
---
If a survivor is bad, they'll get less bp than a bad killer, though.
---
&gt; You're making a lot of assumptions
---
Based on your comment, my extrapolation isn't unreasonable. 
---
&gt; I kind of thought it goes without saying
---
So then why bitch about it? You can reword it however you like, but it doesn't change anything. If you "stated the observation" you "found to be unfavorable to experience", then clearly it bothers you, ergo you come complain about it in the manner you did, suggesting that players ought to consider the experience of others during play.
---
&gt; but people using omega blink or 3+ blink addons along with meta perks and potential moris simply isn't fun to play against
---
Pardon me while I weep for you having to face someone actually stronger than you for once. Pardon me while I silently sob that your map tiles can't save you. Forgive me as I bemoan a killer actually assuming the power role for once, and please excuse my uncontrollable tears while you and your SWF tell killers to "git gud" and "learn how to deal with it".
---
Please... If you aren't prepared to deal with S-tier picks in a competitive game, then you should probably stick to single player campaigns on normal difficulty. Anything beyond that is likely to send you into a crying fit.
---
"I'mma show ya the meanin' of pro-pain..."
---
Kind of a waste of time though, its much quicker to just kill the last person so both people can move on to a new, hopefully proper game.
---
Also denying yourself bloodpoints by staying and letting him farm.
---
Ehhh fair enough. Its still just a way to get into a chase again and get downed, it just takes more time.
---
This is why when I unhook someone in terror radius I am trying to get killer's attention. But almost all time when I am gettin unhooked that person just tries to hide.
---
"I'm not camping, I'm securing my kill"
---
This acting like it's the survivor's right to live is so dumb. The killer should kill who they want when they want, not be beholden to arbritrary rules created by their opponent.
---
Do you complain when people kill you in pubg or fortnite bc now you can't play the game for a few minutes? How dare your opponent end your game quickly!
---
Incorrect again. The survivors job is doing gens &amp; escaping. Everything else is a side job.
---
Did you try to restart the game?
---
Detective Tapp looks like he's trying to detective tapp dat ass
---
For survivor, I really like Stake Out. Getting 4 free great skill checks in a row can be really clutch.
---
For killer, I love Save The Best For Last. Counters MoM and lets you ramp up the pressure during chases. It just kind of suffocates survivors when there's a super quick weapon wipe animation.
---
Nothing? Its good as it is. Maybe bump it up to 20 seconds or something, but its a good perk. Im just saying you shouldnt farm people because you have it
---
Was BP changed? I thought toolboxes should only be common tier for using them.
---
If Billy was 4.5m/s he'd be one of the worst killers.
---
Slippery meat + up the ante + salty lips the best Walmart brand deliervance known to man.
---
Lol sure bud if you say so :)
---
The sixth totem is just way too absurdly overpowered, the rest are fine but holy fuck. Any killer with good map control would just completely break the game.
---
It doesn't make sense as point-wise you get less when you camp/tunnel/mori
---
Actually, yes. I do expect survivors to stay in the game. You can't just label a killer as an exception and DC. The only reason why this mentality/DC culture is floating around so prominently in this community is because of lack of repercussions.
---
Don’t get upset @ facts 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Says the killer main that doesn't think survivors should save each other off hooks
---
If Bhvr nerfs Hillbilly they will lose 30 to 40 percent of the player base. What perk build are you talking about OP?
---
Hopefully there is a good summer event, at this rate wasn't the last 2x BP quite a while ago?
---
Post for us plzzz
---
Didn't say there was a problem with it. The problem is people dcing all the time.
---
Yep!
---
Why wouldn't they want to use object? It's a fun perk.  
---
Plunderer's Instinct could just show you every chest on the map.  
---
Detective's Hunch could show you nearly everything around you.  
---
Windows of Opportunity would show you every window/pallet on the map.
---
He's pretty powerful with certain addons, perk builds, and playstyles. Many people say "he's only good at tunneling" but tunneling with him is like Legion and takes forever, so I typically go for "Sleep tag" and try to sleep as many survivors as possible.
---
nobody said killers are the only problem, literally nobody. it's always been the other way around here, survivors are always the problem when it comes up in discussion.
---
killers are the ones who are given free passes for toxic behaviour constantly because "oh well survivors are more toxic haha"
---
survivors are dcing because this game is garbage now. I'm talking about old players though, not salty little new players who dc simply because they got outplayed.
---
Nope, it's happened with the Plague as well, and maybe the Huntress? I can't really remember
---
Honestly I've been having a really wonderful bloodhunt; Majority of the matches I've had everyone has been pleasant or just downright delightful. I've noticed being positive in chat first, even if you lose, really seems to help this along! So thanks for giving me such an enjoyable first blood hunt, everyone! &lt;3
---
I like the way the wraith looks right now, maybe give him some eyebrows. http://imgur.com/gallery/bUPvbkC
---
I believe it was. We need a 3x Bloodpoint.event and soon to try to make up.for this lackluster event.
---
I wish they could've added Evil Ash as a killer
---
Mettle Of Man counters chainsaws?
---
i didn't bother getting my hopes up so i wasn't let down. this. is exactly what i expected it to be like. it's still a shame to see my expectations being accurate, but that's all this game is now so
---
had something similar. was playing what i would call fair. was wraith with no tunnelling or camping or anything like that, but one p3 claudette had to chase me with her flashlight all game long and stun me out of my power.
---
i decided to stop fair play, hooked her and waited invisible for her team mates to deny them saving her (gates were powered anyway) and boy i did the right thing. 
---
claudette flamed me for being a noob, a camper, a tunneller and a noob because i use noed (they were so proud that they cleansed all totems)
---
I feel like the average person who complains about gen rushing is complaining about the game, not the way that survivors are playing.
---
I can see that, but even without that you can get it from the Shrine
---
Exactly, but wasting as much time as possible is the way you win. Of course, against something like nurse it's useless, since she can catch up instantly, but against other killers, you are pretty much getting a free instaheal for 15 seconds.
---
Awesome ideas. I have a couple of friends who refuse to use certain perks bc they suck at chases and like to hide
---
also slugging and camping
---
Almost no one does lol.
---
It does but only if you’re injured. M2 attacks don’t give you stacks though.
---
That is hilarious! I tried offering death to a nurse once and she adamantly refused.
---
This so much. I'm a survivor main but wanted to clear dailies and bring a little joy to the endless sweaty killer lineup. Ended up just sweating all 3 dailies out. At rank 15 getting potatoes to understand how to farm is impossible. I couldn't even get the last person to not wiggle for hatch. SMH.
---
counterpoint: when it spawns in The Game or The Swamp and its impossible to find
---
WGLF+BT=One perk
---
Im a rank 1 solo survivor on PC. I never have had difficulty reaching r1 in my 2k hours. Except for the patch before this current one. All they did was make a pip require 15 scoring points instead of 16.. that being said, I still did it. They nerfed the difficulty and it, truly, isn't too hard.
---
Just do a bit of everything. If you don't, you don't get a pip. Ez as that
---
I feel like the way it was before was better
---
Can't beat the classic.
---
I reached rank 2 by tryharding all Night yesterday with piggy, couldn't go further.
---
I played Freddy for the weekend lol
---
Because the Killer is the host.
---
When I play Freddy I am using only a strong addons or just preparing to get shit on after all 4 escaped when doing his daily. At least his daily is easy. He is the weakest killer if you compare all killers without addons.
---
lol I have an x dips like mad next to survivors as killer
---
Yeah if you wanna farm you kinda have to stomp them into submission quickly. Then they’ll be compliant I’ve found.
---
If you don't like playing with noed you have two options:
---
1. Cleanse all totems, no totems - no noed
---
2. Uninstall the game, no game - no noed
---
Wow the comments, he was fuming. Thanks for sharing, I'm glad you made it out 😎!
---
I assumed you thought killers were the only problem because you talked about how games during the bloodhunt are filled with campers, tunnelers, etc..
---
I'm trying to make the point that survivors also do irrational things during bloodhunts, and that their meta perks motivate tryhard behaviour.
---
Lol I love it
---
I somewhat camp when the gates are open too but I never facecamp or BM the survivor on the hook. This killer was pretty toxic and went mental in end game chat with insults that can straight up get him banned. 
---
99% of survivors I played against are fine with killers camping the last person but theres no need to BM them or complain when things don’t go your way.
---
can't say that isn't true
---
No those are just photoshop. /s
---
I just hate how Wraith and Pig can cheese BT, and not have to deal with it at all, while killers who can't disable their terror radius at will just have to deal with it or leave their hooks undefended (to say nothing of actual camping killers).
---
Some people just need an excuse
---
Every time I played killer, I got p3 swf Claudettes.
---
If your goal is bps sure but if you’re just playing for fun or for kills leaving that close to the gate makes no sense.
---
Ok maybe the lol in the title made it seem like I was being that way but honestly I was just impressed that we all made it away from the hook in that situation as it’s normally the opposite. I’m fully ok with killers camping once the gens are done but i’m sure he would have done it either way as he was nodding his head at her and seemed annoyed.
---
Also “practically powerless”... not really whilst stood an inch from the hooked survivors face revving his chainsaw capable of insta-downing multiple survivors at once.
---
Well,they still got the perks so eh,idc really
---
I support
---
Haven't played in like 3 weeks, my 5 last games before I left were wraith against a swf all with mettle of man, one with object obsession, all with adrenaline, all with decisive. I never had less fun in the entire history of the game. I don't feel like coming back when mettle of man is still popular because wraith is my favorite killer.
---
Oh... yea that was me...
---
I was also in another video too...
---
If you know Ochido, I was in his match when playing Leatherface.
---
It's called great escape from a face camping bubba.
---
 I went for Ochido as a joke and got rekt.
---
I play on PC and PS4 btw...
---
r/JustALilBit
---
someone clearly had a bad game
---
Jeez it was a joke...
---
Haha ok then
---
I keep hearing of all these nice games where people go in and just farm the whole time but I keep getting pink add on Myers or hag .
---
To be fair though when I go in as killer I end up with a David flashlighting me every 5 seconds or a Claudette doing something Claudette-y so I don’t even blame them
---
Oh shit, you're right.
---
When people are having a bad time. They want others to also have a bad time. One game you get tunneled and camped nonstop. So next game you [insert equivalent survivor thing] to the next killer. Then the game after the previous killer brings mori. It is never ending cycle.
---
Ash is a busy man. He's in Dead by Daylight today and tomorrow he's showing up in MK11.
---
You are aware there's a bug that causes you to get DC'd for no reason, right?  
---
That'd make the people who get DC'd because of the bug suffer a huge penalty... for a bug.
---
I think in total, I had about 10 normal games during this event. It seemed like every game, was either farm, tunnels, camping, or dcs. 
---
Honestly disappointed in this event.
---
Klaatu barada ni-ACHOO!!
---
"disconnect" "couldn't"
---
When you have a face and voice as iconic as El Jefe, you tend to be in high demand.
---
&gt;this system worked tho, because better players were more likely to right up there
---
I don't know if I'd say that, but it certainly worked a lot better than the system we have now.
---
Yeah I have no idea why they added MoM... the M1 killers were mostly weak anyway and now they’re even weaker.. they’re just pushing more and more people toward hillbilly, nurse, and huntress
---
Nothing worse than getting a 4K just to only get Brutal Killer...
---
And at that point, you've already gotten sweaty and scored damn near as many points as farming would so may as well just play normally and kill people just the same.
---
I just played a hag game.
---
people cleansed Haunted Grounds when I was near them, downed 3 people really quickly, then found the 4th person while I was hooking the rest. EZ 4 kill, entity displeased. Entity, ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
---
That's why I'm exclusively playing killer on these events either farming, soft playing or just troll playing with myself.
---
I know it's only a meme...but I loaded dbd for the first time since rank reset just for this.
---
Played huntress (2xdailies) around rank 10. Chasing full hp survivors only and if I downed one unhooked I just left them. 
---
2 kills, 2 hook on everyone and ggwp message from everyone. Least amount of salt i ever had....despite this being my normal playstyle. (And no, I do not run ruin or noed)
---
But this was only time I ever for GG fair play etc. I usually get salt only. Pause for a second and think why killers don't give a damn on what survivors think...
---
Oh I'm not mad just amazed. I've always like Ash in the Evil Deads and the not so good games that came with. I think it's awesome that he's getting so Mich more exposure.
---
Where did I say they didn't?
---
The game already have automatic ban system when you will disconnect more than 60% of your games. Giving you ban right after first disconnect will kill the game. It was supposed to bring fun playing games yet this game can give you a lot of frustration. So I don't mind if someone DC, I assume they just didn't have fun playing that trial. I understand this and don't mind. This is just a game in the end. You are not obligated to suffer when playing only to give more fun for someone else.
---
ah well, i'm at work now so no skin off my bones
---
Ok but this perk specifies that if you’re in the killer’s terror radius you can stop the guy from unhooking you. But BT doesn’t proc unless you’re in the killer’s terror radius

It's pretty awesome, especially with the show being cancelled.

---
The intro movie is there, pretty sure if you add a new MP4 with the same title it will play instead but ive never tried.
---
So... if the person getting unhooked is hit then the unhooker gets healed?
---
But its not about killing anymore then. Its about following a formula to get a pip. It only rewards a certain playstyle. If you don't follow it but still get 4k you dont pip.
---
I fear no doctor
---
TWD= The Walking Dead? I disliked that show after like season 1 and I watched it for 3 seasons. I find Ash vs Evil Dead far better.
---
this is a happy ending
---
Id have to read hope but both spine chill and res works
---
Yep! The Walking Dead, which has, in my eyes, been lame for a while.
---
I would say you are not wrong but keep in mind: these games are symmetrical, this game is not. Only one side can make a damage.
---
Doesn't justify your toxicity.
---
Screaming about how much you hate everyone and saying vile things towards players because you dislike an item just shows how immature you are.
---
There are multiple ways to get around this but if you hate the game so much (re: your previous post) just uninstall.
---
If it's a group dc, I suspect it's the killer's internet at fault. I don't want to blame the game on something that isn't fully understood yet. If you can, try and reproduce it and create a bug report. I don't believe it's a big enough occurrence to warrant a cease though.
---
I've always said they should make it the way some fighting games have. Put up a disconnect percentage in the lobby. This way both killers and survivors can decide whether or not they wanna risk playing versus/with someone who constantly disconnects. Just the other night I went up against a SWF on console who had lame ass matching gamertags. As soon as I caught one, instant disconnect followed by the other one doing the same a second later. I finished the match quickly, went on to the next, same guys, same result. I messaged them and suggested they might as well delete the game if they're that terrible at it and have to disconnect every time they get caught. I got the typical "U mad bro" response morons always say. But yeah, I'd love an icon or a disconnect percentage, if everyone leaves the lobby, they won't get to play and they'd be forced to stop.
---
No
---
whoa whoa whoa. slow down there, hoss.   
---
bringing facts to a feelings fight.
---
Agreed, this simple change would be so nice
---
Ok cuz I thought SC and resilience both worked and have used them and it seemed to make a difference but I also just read someone saying hope also works making it 22% at endgame which would be fun just hoping someone can confirm.
---
does happen.
---
i'd love the asylum one
---
Spirit.
---
How does one get caught 20 times in a row tho
---
Hope and Spine Chill don't, Resilience does.
---
Congrats but I would rather generate more BP per time played than more BP per match played. The time you waste farming an extra 2k could be spent getting halfway through another match, even during a 2x event. That extra 2-4k doubled to 4-8k just isn't worth farming.
---
Jeff is a Stunt double for Tommy Chong.
---
It's best just to think of it as a normal game with more bp. It's not anything special, just a higher chnace that some survivors abd killers will be willing to farm bp.
---
When I'm playing killer during blood hunt, I don't farm per se, I just go easier on survivors if they're clearly not great at the game. I'll slug to let them be rescued if I know they're on their last hook, for example.
---
Spine Chill was changed recently, I believe
---
Because it would (if working) improve matchmaking
---
2:00 pm EST
---
Thank you!
---
He's one of the default survivors...
---
...you realize he's free, right?
---
He comes with the Huntress DLC, which is available to everyone
---
I think there was a clip of  Mathieu saying both rez and spine chill no longer do that, can't find it tho
---
I don't see it as unexpected either, but it's a still bad way to gain points. Especially during Bloodhunt when people take BPS. Camping/tunneling/performing mori against a person who took BPS is just scummy. I do believe people might do it because of inexperience, but I'm strongly convinced most killers who camp/tunnel/do mori during Bloodhunt are aware of what they are doing, especially in higher ranks
---
*giggles in huntress humming.*
---
First, it’s not two thousand for me, I clarified that. It’s closer to six pre BBQ and Bloodhunt. Second, I’m not considering all the hours if possible time to play for points. I’m going to play based on number of matches, not amount of time spent, so I’m capitalizing point gain in every round possible. And lastly, I like when survivors don’t leave without at least a good chunk of points in their hand if they were polite players.
---
small game.
---
go forth and be salty no more.
---
🤣
---
I mean teabaging is bad but waiting to get hit gives points to the killer and if there is survivors arround you also give protection points.
---
Quick fix sounds ridiculous. It makes you repair faster than thanatophobia at full stacks, and 45 meters is huge. The only downside is the skillchecks being smaller, which is easily countered by being able to hit skillchecks
---
Well not smacking people is the only way to play infinite tombstone really. Other question is, why would you do this build during the Bloodhunt
---
True
---
I don’t
---
I used to like dying light but now it’s fucking useless
---
It says it in game if you hover your mouse over the little blood points symbol next to your blood point total
---
it bleaches a lot of stuff. it even turns the exclusive golden feng clothes into her basic ones
---
This. Except for me it ended up being 3 times as bright. I couldn’t even look in that direction, even across the entire map.
---
Possibly. Even if they are aware, they don't have to farm. You may think their behaviour is scummy, but in the end it is their decision on how they play the game. Survivors are also entitled on how they want to play the game.
---
How do you explain these ethics to someone who doesn't come on this subreddit, or even the forums? You may see them as a jerk, but they may not even think twice about their actions; they're just playing the game.
---
I remember trying to do that with a Farming Nurse, after we failed to communicate with the others that we wanted to do two hooks and break pallets. After pointing at the hook, she just downed me and brought me to the gate. Such a sweetheart.
---
"gen rush"
---
crybaby killer detected
---
sadly no, i meant i only played 1 game /day just to do them
---
It would only cause you to be dodged if you disconnect frequently. That’s completely different than dodging based on rank and perceived skill
---
My tier list : 
---
SS : Nurse
---
S+ : Hillbilly, Spirit
---
S- : Huntress, Hag
---
A : nobody
---
B : nobody again, the difference between top 5 and the rest of the killers is massive
---
C : Shape, Plague, Wraith, Pig, Doctor, Clown, Legion
---
D : Cannibal, Trapper.
---
And Nightmare gets a rework soon, so he's not worth mentioning in the tier list right now.
---
Unbreakabill
---
Freddy’s trade off is he’s invisible to detection auras and you can still technically see wraith even when cloaked.
---
This doesn’t mean Freddy is fine, it’s just some differences not mentioned here.
---
Lol maybe, some people are chill and trash their own surv buddies 😂
---
Shirtless Jeff
---
I only played killer and farmed everytime, and damn that was a good event for me.
---
Spent all my 20+ survivor pudding and some bps and the speed limiters on billiboi.
---
That's why I only play killer during these events.
---
To be fair, in French it used the feminine version of entity
---
Legion isint op you're just a baby
---
Hope so. But I remembered them talking about implementing a ranked rework or rewards around Christmas in 2017. As far as I know its still the same old 20 to 1 system. Not that I don't like this system.
---
Oh, well at least you got some work done, are you gonna take advantage of the next one thats available?
---
fair points here, and i agree with pretty much all of this. But I do believe that killers get free passes on their behaviour a lot, for example, who do people look at when someone says DC? survivors. Whilst yes, it's likely that you see more survivor dcs because the ratio is 4:1, people act like dcing as killer is totally fine.
---
At least if a survivor dcs you can earn more points from the game and aren't just stuck with what you have at that time. When a killer dcs, the whole game ends (obviously) and survivors miss out on a lot of points. They also derank quite often when a killer dcs which I mean.. is just laughable.
---
Blood for the blood god.
---
I would but what good would come of it?
---
At best this goober will see this post and see the error of their ways.
---
Wouldn't make that bet if I had a gun to my head though.
---
He’s not really hard, he’s just not fun to play against
---
Rise up fellow bing bongs!
---
I think the endurance status effect of MoM is deactivated while fully healed
---
Just went through this exact thing on my P3 Piggy. Never saw BBQ on my first 3 trips to 50 and it took an additional 100 levels to finally get BBQ 1 to show up. I did the math and I leveled Amanda 238 times (from level 1 with no prestige) before seeing BBQ once.
---
Dont disrespect the 7% Kobe
---
I hope OP picks option 2
---
poor Doc thought he was a survivor and wanted to fast vault :(
---
&gt;Meg Cosmetic #374 that is purple and can only be bought with auric cells

FTFY

How do you explain ethics to anyone who doesn't think themselves about ethics if they don't hang with those who act more ethical? You can talk to them directly, I sometimes do that. Like I'm talking with you for example, but in private messages. But mostly I get "I don't care" reaction. That's why I think most of those people are ignorant of those ethics by their own choice.
---
Still, I started this conversation on a different note. Basically, I just wanted to tell that camping/tunneling/using mori doesn't have anything to do with desire to gain points during Bloodhunt.
---
You’re aware the saying is no skin off my nose aren’t you? 😂
---
Hey Noobmaster, Billy here
---
If you dont get off this game im gonna YEET over to that basement of yours
---
and shove this hammer up your *butt*
---
We don't want rank 1 to be hard to obtain. That just means queue times at rank 1 will take forever and no one will want to be rank 1. Just give us a rank 1 reward, like 10% bonus bloodpoints while at rank 1 or something.
---
As a Billy main, I can say with confidence that he is easy to loop and juke. You have to have good spacing against him. If the Billy zones properly,  you may have a hard time, but it still will take time to go down. I'd much rather play against a Billy than a Nurse, Spirit or good huntress.
---
If anyone put up a BPS, I let them all go after the 2 hooks. I played a lot of Piggy this weekend and I had a blast with it. 
---
However, I did just play regularly after a point if they didn't bring any BPS. Not sweaty but just playing like normal without meta builds. (Still ran BBQ though for those sweet sweet stacks.) All in all it was a really good weekend...minus the 2nd or 3rd day. One of those was just absolute dog shit games all around.
---
A nurse without nurses calling? Lol
---
Yeah despite all of its issues with optimization, at least we have a tonne or variety with killers in game. There doesn’t seem to be a meta besides Michael.
---
Oh, well good luck on your next bloodhunt
---
So that's why I always get facecamped as Jeff, cause man boobs
---
I ran a tunneling killer for 3 gens (and i hate being tunneled). Did gen progress on multiple gens that was worth atleast 1 gen total. Destroyed 1 or 2 dull totems.
---
I got downed in endgame because i tried to save 2 hooked survivors from a noed killer and they stupidly ran into the killers hands for the u hool points.
---
Then i used the adam perk after i was hooked to save a downed survivor which then also was hooked later on because he once again ran into the killer like the others.
---
I even took a hit for a hooked survivor. So he had a chance to escape.
---
Yes I could easily see this perk being abused
---
Wait, this is Xbox so Hag comes with the game. The fuck is this guy smoking? Lol
---
Even just make it so they affect chests would be amazing. Make all of them affect all survivors too.
---
Bill looks pretty good because you can hardly see his mouth in the first place
---
So either change your ways or stay at the rank you are..  
---
Its the same for survivor we got to do everything to pip or we will just safety pip or derank...
---
Things I have learned this event:
---
1. High ranked survivors seemingly got there without learning how to do a gen through ruin (despite everyone 5-10 ranks lower than them pushing through without issue. 
---
2. High ranked killers would rather hold a game hostage to the detriment to all rather than lose out on one kill due to a possible hatch escape (seriously, two 20+ minute games yesterday because of this when we all could have finished a second game in that time). On the same regard, the last survivor keeps sneaking around for ages when at some point, just run up to the killer so we can move on with our lives.
---
I thought the stereotype about high ranks being a shit show was probably exaggerated since the rank changes...but now I can't wait for reset. I could probably count on one hand the number of games I had yesterday that had both competent survivors and killers that didn't have to rely on toxic strategies to get one kill. If I didn't have so many party streamers, I would have switched to killer, but I'm sure there was plenty of frustrations there too. What a terrible event.
---
I care
---
I've been getting a lot of bloodpoints and having some good games as Huntress during the Bloodhunt, having a pretty great time with DBD right now.
---
The killer usually loses when they tunnel
---
Oh my god, dont DC, you ruin the game. Especially if your survivor because now the other 3 gotta play withought you. If your killer, and you DC, especially within the first 40 seconds, its not that bad. Survivors start up a new game, the killer starts up a new game. What is there to explain? Dont leave because you missed a hatchet, or because the last survivor is running out the gate. Dont DC because you were first downed, or you're being face camped, because you're hurting the game for others and are ruining peoples expierence rather than just your own. Thats all Im saying, you all are reading into this too much.
---
I just play normally and use bps or pudding instead of saving them.
---
As a survivor main, Mettle of Man is broken. Enough with the insta heals already.
---
True. I'm glad I got out when I did then.
---
I know Freddy has good tracking but I find Class Photo super good as it shows survivor auras during the dream transition. Combine it with a range addon and you can do "Sleep Tag" and zip around sleeping survivors one after another. 
---
For tracking I LOVE Discordance for Freddy. Survivors often multi-survivor a gen at the very start of the match, so it helps me get the snowball started.
---
I'm glad you don't have 1-2 dc every single game.
---
I’m sorry I meant it to be like a stupid “what a bad killer would say” joke.
---
Suppose I didn’t make that clear enough.  :(
---
Me bad at joke plz no bulli
---
*soawns in*
---
*hears totem break immediately*
---
Postgame:
---
“Sorry dude, it spawned right in front of me.”
---
Kinda looks like Janeane Garofalo.
---
Devs pay attention
---
Its a hot day: the killer is sweaty
---
You could have been 1% off getting a silver in Lightbringer but unless you get exactly 100 points which is one full gen you’ll get bronze.
---
Totems, unless a it’s a Hex, count for nothing. 
---
Evader and Survival are correct then, long chase and surviving after being downed. 
---
Benevolence is 0 because you must have had unsafe unhooks. Doesn’t matter if the survivors are idiots and ran back into the killer, you get punished for it if you did the save. 
---
You should have hovered over the emblem to see exactly what you were punished for because it tells you exactly why you got the score you did.
---
What do you mean? You didn't do gens, you didn't safely save people and just hid in a corner. There is nothing wrong with it.
---
It's a long weekend for most people
---
I've been working on getting every survivor I own to rank 50. Just have David King left.
---
Damn that's rough
---
Something wrong with the Plague is hard to discern from this. The highest/lowest killer performance doesn't tell us if it's derived from mean or median, nor the data set it comes from, nor if it's because there are only matches ending in all or nothing sacrifices, nor the spread along ranks.
---
I do struggle with her, similarly to the Huntress, because better survivor play uses loops, which means they're always running *around* a corner, a big rock or a wall. She's great in the open, but so is Hillbilly, and Hillbilly's power is a one hit down, *and* Hillbilly can go around corners with it charging without slowing down, *and* Hillbilly punishes survivors running in his face.
---
No map traversal, detection, stealth or presence, especially since infecting generators only matters if you're there to capitalise... but you're infecting survivors you chase anyway. Her ability only becomes deadly if you go out of your way, no other killer has to do this to use theirs. Nurse's calling, a meta perk, can't be used. Dead Hard, a meta perk, can't be ignored. Add ons are an unknown quantity. Infected survivors, when unhooked, get a free heal so no-one wastes time healing/self caring. Using M1 before they're broken is punished, but being unable to connect your M2 much means why did you bother, means she's just a trapper without traps. Vile &amp; Corrupt Purge do not compliment each other; transitioning mid chase is a waste. I could go on, she's just a mess to analyse.
---
I finished getting my claudette to p3 and got my ash to p3 as well
---
Upgraded bubba to 35 for som bbq and chili
---
Killers are not rewarded, they are slightly compensated. I'ts not even 1k bp per dc and what do you lose out on? Chase points, hit points, hook points, bbq tokens etc.
---
????
---
yeah like no lag at all
---
I never got any of my pips back.
---
Its still bullshit that my teammates idiocy has fucked me over that much.
---
Next time i will remember to just go out of the already by me opened exit gate instead of trying to help some random teammates.
---
Someone has been only playing survivor...
---
My definition of winning is getting the most bloodpoints, if i got the most BP in the match even if all survivors escape i am happy.
---
I switched up my build completely in order to secure myself a pip.. its rough out there anymore.. I play killer also I know the frustration I get shit on a lot unless I run my spirit with my try hard build.
---
Never said there wasn’t, just an observation.
---
No you don’t
---
r/WholesomeRedditors
---
I don't think it would lead to a bigger issue. I'm sure they could implement where a disconnect rate would be displayed after something like 15-20%. It would for sure stop SWF constantly dcing. But this wouldn't reset, it would be an overall thing. It won't be any issue for anyone who isn't consistently disconnecting. It would be a simple solution, don't wanna get dodged? Quit being a rage quitting prick. It ruins games for both killers and survivors.
---
Then what is rank 3?
---
i envy you
---
Then stop killing so fast lmao
---
Dude I wish the hooks looked like that all the time those spider legs are so sexy
---
Maybe a pop up similar to how Kindred does next to your perks in the bottom right corner? 
---
Not that anyone would pay attention to that anyways.
---
You can do that and still pip you gotta play strategically to pip as killer. You cant just go in and kill all 4 in 3 to 4 mins and deserve a pip. You gotta work. You want them to unhook you want to hook everyone 2 to 3 times get the most bnf for you buck
---
Leveld up 4 killers to lvl 50+
---
what
---
Nice. I P3’d my Claud during the last Blood Hunt. But I got tired of her cosmetics. I want more options.
---
I'm not gonna defend the ranking system, because it's definitely bad, but in this case you decided you want to depip by using this build.
---
You used two ultra rare add-ons that make you not hook people and every Survivor dies after losing one single chase, which means you can win at max 4 chases per game, and explains the almost non-existent score in the emblems. Nothing wrong here, sorry.
---
If people were allowed to +2 by using these powerful combos, we'd be left with a bunch of incompetent killers at higher ranks, and when they run out of the add-ons, they'll cry that Survivor = OP.
---
&gt;  There doesn’t seem to be a meta besides maybe Michael.
---
This man deadass called Michael meta. Bruh
---
Honestly I do agree with you. If you don’t have Borrowed Time then the game punishes you for saving teammates when the gates are open as the killer will be camping and you’ll likely get an unsafe rescue. It makes you sacrifice ranking up for trying to help teammates.
---
I’ve done that for all but the the detective.
---
Didn't we see that the win rates are actually only marginally higher for 4 man SWF vs solo survivors? Unless we can verify that DCs are more common in 4 man groups, which they might be, I'm not sure SWF can be the boogeyman it's made out to be.
---
Getting my Jake all the teachable perks I want, as well as hoarding all the prayer beads and ebbo moris I can with my spirit &gt;=D
---
Happy cake day!
---
This is my favorite thing to do as Pig. &lt;3 I jump scare as much as I can.
---
Fair enough. I'm not red rank, so the culture is pretty different
---
Nice. Jake is probably who I’ll P3 next, after I’m done with Feng.
---
He’s played a lot on ps4 lol
---
It was not pretty. I tried playing killer after a while just to get equally toxic survivors
---
The last time I checked, he used reasoning and at least some logic to make his points. All I see you do is some uneducated insults. How sad
---
But he's not meta on PC. Which means he's not "meta"
---
I dig his cosmetics. Used to run an outdoorsman Jake look. Didnt blend in for shit, but lemme tell ya... you get good at running that way!
---
make it add something something to the HUD for other survivors (and not for killers). It can be used to send a message like struggle-spamming. Make it so you can't turn it on unless you're within 20 meters of the killer, or a chase is happening or something.
---
This entire thread was about ps4 killers. Sis I-
---
it was at that moment thst they knew.........they F*cked up
---
Got Jane &amp; Ash to level 40 and Jeff to level 30 (almost 40) to finish up their teachables.
---
lol
---
the p3 claudette was the 4rth person i had some brown clothes ? and btw you did camp
---
I don’t always want to blend in though! My favorite skins are the ugly sweaters!!!
---
Survivors: We have made a terrible mistake
---
i see, im going to work on it!
---
Yeah it’s kinda weird the way emblem scoring is now. I understand that they want to emphasize needing more hooks to promote less camping and such but a lot of the time minimal chase time and less hooks aren’t because of poor play on the killer’s side
---
So youre saying that i dont get to have fun bc my internet shuts off once a week?
---
I'm floating rank 4-6 as solo survivor right now, it's not really that hard. I'm not really trying my ass off -- I never bring in items and I don't have MoM. Yeah the 3v1's suck but it's really not hard to do enough to safe pip in those games. In fact pretty often I'm surprised by how little I do and still manage to pip/safe pip, even when I don't survive. Fun contrast to constant 4k safe pips as killer in red ranks.
---
3 hooks before you die is a lot of wiggle room to fuck up and still get your emblem points in.
---
"But only the ToXIc survivors can ruin the event Durr Hurr"
---
Maybe survivors should lose points for getting gens done so fast then. 
---
/s
---
Survivors who complain about ruin lol
---
you have yet to see what looks like a speed hacking Michael on ps4, i encountered one with litterally no othwr way of explaining how in tier 1 and 2 he was able to clear the entire map in litterally 5 seconds, he essentially gave himself Max Bloodlust
---
He's the most balanced killer, what you mean?
---
Same for survior`s 360.
---
me and my friends we constantly making jokes about him hauling ass
---
Just prestiged (3) Quentin before the event, spent a bunch of points getting him all the perks in the bloodweb that I wanted for him, and got Jeff up to P3. The rest I'm going to spend on Myers, it's a shame I don't like his prestige weapon very much.
---
Lol did you screenshot it? Sounds hilarious
---
I got called a speed hacker when I was using NOED...
---
One of my favorite perks. It’s underrated.
---
I mean technically you're right. There are no noobs at rank 1 if there's no one at rank 1.
---
Still don’t understand how people can teabag the lowest tier killer in the game and then taunt post game about it... just shows their lack of sense on this game
---
My brother and I played 4 games last sunday after some months of inactivity.
---
3 doctors
---
3 games with one player not loading into the game 
---
2 games where survivors disconnected when downed
---
2 games where the killer wanted to farm and dragged the game out when it should’ve been long over
---
Needless to say I probably won‘t be in the mood to play for some time...
---
Its not because its way too unbalanced. It has devs who wont change the game. It died for a reason.
---
Spirit is already shirtless by default !
---
Okay I misinterpreted something then. Sorry
---
Do you think they'll do something with it?
---
But isnt the point of being a killer to, you know, kill. Not play ring around the rosie. (Or whatever its called)
---
i love the detail of “because fuck them, that’s why” -probably everyone
---
Exactly
---
I just had a game where a Michael kept finding and every time I looped him for at least a minute or two. At the end I died and post game chat I said gg. He then proceeded to call me toxic and that looping needed no skill and that I only play to survive and not for fun, even though fun is different to different people. He then said that I use meta perks because I had decisive although its an event where people farm each other. He left.
---
Some people are just so hard to reason with. At least I didn't point, t-bag, click a flashlight or anything. I just ran from him. Some people think that everything is toxic, and it's sad. He was a good killer though.
---
The doctor will see you now  😂. I’d be able to power a small city lol
---
Quentin eh? I don’t know many who have him as a favorite. I don’t usually play a lot of the licensed survivors, because they don’t really have other skins for the most part. Ash has some cosmetics of course, and Laurie at least has two outfits. But that’s it. I don’t  think Quinton has more than two outfits. Besides a bloody one as well.
---
But hey, to each their own.
---
Can confirm
---
For me there's no doubt, you get an advantage for playing with friends. I think the numbers are for lower ranks as well. When you're a new player and playing with your friends the chances of surviving are lower.
---
Thursday and Friday I noticed a lot more farming in games, which I was okay with. I expected it, even if it's not my jam.
---
Saturday was the worst day I've ever experienced during this game. It was all tunnels, camps, and getting farmed off the hook by fellow survivors. I switched to killer just to give survivors some nice games.
---
Sunday felt like normal again. I had some great teammates, played against some great killers, and had one of the most fun days I've had playing the game.
---
Like I can see who's playing as killer.. like their gamertag.. I stay around the same ranks so I run into the same people over and over you begin to learn their play style and if you can deal.
---
No. I think it will die. It wasnt a bad game. But it wasnt very good either.
---
So mediocre or average
---
Mediocre
---
Bloodhound is better if you are trying to track them in the chase but nurses is better to track survivors overall. Nurse's workes really well with killers who have a terror radius lower than 28 or combined with monitor and abuse. Overall I say nurses calling is better
---
Apparently you have to do more just like survivor you cant just fix gens and run out the door and expect to pip.. doesnt work that wat anymore which is fair !
---
Nice post, Sharp Hands Joe.
---
You're not fooling anyone, buddy.
---
So it's safe to say it's a semi tragedy but not really cause we all still have dead by daylight
---
more shirtless
---
I wanted to do P3 Feng and possibly Pig, but decided to do P3 Tapp instead since I play him the most. I also decided to spend cells on Ash and got him to 40 with an extra 1m and have MoM on Tapp. Now I am just going to focus on getting the remaining teachables for both sides.
---
Last one was around Christmas, I believe.
---
I’m sure the entity would be smart enough to take advantage of an opportunity to turn a survivor that doesn’t get caught into a killer. Most of the comments here are talking about the lore so you obviously aren’t paying attention
---
man muscle legion
---
Gen rushing is not toxic... but survivors do look incredibly dumb when they complain about getting hit with NOED after only focusing on gens all game and not cleansing any dull totems.
---
p-3 my myers with all the lerrys and scratched mirrors a man could ask for.
---
At least you're compensated for it, survivors get nothing.
---
rank 15 OMEGALUL
---
He's a fun killer to play as, and play against. I rarely get a 4k with him but it's always fun!
---
(Halloween theme intensifies)
---
It tired too hard to be a replacement for DBD and failed, because as much as i hate to say it, there isnt really a game like dbd.
---
It's less to do with instaheals and more to do with what I call "state cancellers". Like DS lets you cancel/reverse the fact you lost a single health state by going from downed to injured, MoM lets you ignore a hit, cancelling you going down until the next hit. The issue isn't state cancellers themselves, but the fact some are given with no skill or effort from the player, exactly like the old DS, and exactly like MoM. The killer equivalent would be NOED, which allows the killer to force along extra "states" with no skill/effort on their part. The devs should just fix this entirely as it is completely against the idea of this game being competitively-balanced.
---
Do you have one for nea?
---
There's definitely an advantage, but killers (including myself) seemed to think that it was the difference between a 4K and a 0K. The game stats we see now point to it maybe being a 1k difference. It matters, but it's maybe not as big as we thought.
---
Hatchets: iridescent 
---
Infantry belt: loaded
---
Yup, its 4k time.
---
Yea, it's pretty bad. It's hard enough to hit/down survivors as a M1 killer; more so if they have MoM and Adrenaline.
---
She gets angrier the longer you've been out of a chase with a survivor, but gens have nothing to do with it.
---
Nope, no, not at all. Nooope no sir 😐
---
I actually killed 3 survivors with the hooks. Because they went in lockers
---
They need to make skins cheaper.. no more than $5 a lot more people would buy them I feel like.
---
So does that mean her lullaby gets deeper?
---
I'm just mad that we didn't get Season 4 &gt;:/
---
I used to run bbq, sloppy, ruin, and Nurses calling, but since I got phobia I replaced sloppy. Having nurses is OP coz u can see them healing before they get in your terror radius by 4 meters
---
Yup, and slower a bit in some places.
---
I'm aware, just want to make sure that people who don't play killer think its good for survs to dc from the killer POV. I agree that depipping is bs.
---
I'm always willing to take a hit right as I'm escaping to grant more BP, but I tend to do the "come here"
---
Gotta say, watching Ash slash the shit out of Deadites in a post-apocalyptic wasteland would have been badass.
---
Until then, I guess Ash being trapped in the Entity's realm because of his own dumb ass will be canon enough for me.
---
Really tho, like, cool your first 4k, tell your dog
---
Umm p3 kate. Then spent mostly on my p3 nea to get more addons.
---
Thats true. But i personally think skins on killer is dumb since i cant see it in game. But to each their own.
---
Rank .5
---
Only launched on Discord game store, did not help them at all considering it was a brand new store front either
---
I want to kill myself everytime I see a Plague
---
I wish I could post the image in these comments for ya'll 😭😭😭😭
---
One of the best clips in a long time! Enjoyed watching it :D
---
Thats also very true.
---
Get rid of lessening the dark mist that's just a waste of blood points.
---
The hook ones are stupid now also. Like it doesnt make them any further apart.
---
*sad coughing noise*
---
I had absolutely 0 problems with the bloodpoint event outside of me and my friends only connecting to HALF of the games we played. Almost every game, someones client would either freeze, or fail to connect to host after lobby. So 3 survivors and 1 killer would just have a farm fest. The real frustrating part is alllll of the streamers, and cakes, and envelopes I saved up for this event that went to waste in the fire because of the games that we'd never connect to.
---
Agreed. I dont care unless its a 2 pip
---
Those complaints aren't "game is shit now", the game always had those problems, and they were worse before.
---
BP grind used to be hellish. Pallets used to be everywhere and infinites used to exist on almost every map if not every map, unlike rarely if the right windows are unblocked now. Hit baiting at a hook used to be you can't get past one survivor to hook or *all* your hooks are sabotaged. DS used to be run by everyone. Blinding used to be more immediate and last longer, lightborn made it harder to see, shadowborn made blinding easier. SWF all brought BNPs that were very, very strong.
---
If you're using an axe on someone, I presume you're using the Huntress, don't. She's a pathetic killer that requires crutches and add ons. She can't even be on Billy's level without her iridescent add on.
---
Counterplay is generally mind games during chases, i.e. survivor runs one way, you need to realise they're going to go the other way, not that you often have a choice depending on the vault point. There's also just playing Hillbilly and destroying any pallet if they don't want to be downed immediately. Or you can play nurse, and ignore pallets.
---
Discordance teachable, more Iridescent Kings, Wards, Puddings, and Streamers on Doc, and MYC 2 on Hag.
---
I wanted to get Ruin, Surveillance, and Discordance on my Spirit all at tier 3. I’ve had Surveillance 1 on her for a long time. I didn’t get any of tier of those at all. Fuck the RNG.
---
It's a shame because I really like the Left 4 Dead-esque aesthetic, but couldn't quite stick the landing.
---
Thought it was funny, wasn't expecting anyone to give a shit. Here we are 2.5k karma later :/
---
They really need to change the scoring with these add-ons. It is impossible to pip while winning, and this build can be difficult to use against survivors that know what they're doing.
---
It's a depip party if the killer wins! That makes the next survivors even easier! We all lose!
---
Not that I remember,  no !.
---
You clearly did a lot os mistakes if you got 23K points and still didn't pip. If you would have the recording I could tell you what you are doing wrong.
---
Man, I got gold for generators done but when I looked at it it said 100%, 94% for gens, 6% for gates. But it gave me gold, what does the entity want from me?!
---
It's not just one sided, though. As survivor, if you pop out 4 gens + escape, without seeing the killer (or getting downed) you won't pip.
---
If you're the one getting chased, you can be running from the killer whilst your team gets all gens and escape, and you won't pip.
---
Both sides are punished hard by tunnelling and camping.
---
They do. Gens give few points. That's why most survivors don't do gens.
---
Pretty good job so far!
---
Wraith and Trapper shouldn't use it.  I main them both without it Freddy as well and do perfectly fine throughout red ranks.  Not everyone needs a safety net to crutch out our downs.  There are those capable of playing without it regardless of killer selection.
---
Mmm disagree. Unless you are an actual potato killer, you typically get more points than survivor by far even when 3-4 escape. Especially true with bbq during blood hunt and point offerings. I remember one game I decided to meme on Doctor for points with an offering, and a challenge, all four escaped and I got 130k points.
---
I wouldn’t say I was “ill informed,” i didn’t say they weren’t doing this, and it seems like many people didn’t read the patch notes, I read they were changing it but didn’t see to what, now we know what.
---
Just read your post about your sister situation, wish you the best of luck and that you too can still be close without your mom going nuts about it.
---
I dont think people would care they'd just go play one of their other games they own lol
---
Why does the vsauce guy want to kill himself?
---
I played nurse and only got DCs after using my BPS’ not to mention how I crashed 4 times in a row and lost 4 BPS
---
Amen
---
The disconnects are real tho, like there was a clown who brought pudding and there were 3 BPS but after he started lost his last gen (we 3 gen'd ourselves) he didnt kill anyone so he disconnects like... dawg blood points
---
My only 2 problems where that i was trying to unhook survivors who then ran into the killers (maybe i should also add that they easily could have ran away because for one i took a hit and the killer was again going after me and he could have easily escaped and the other one, i saved in an entirely killer free area but he decided to try unhook a other survivor which the killer was camping which cost him his life)
---
And the other problem was that the killer chased me for 3 gens which made it hard for me to do gens. He also had hex ruin and i wanted to go find it because hitting skillchecks is a bit more harder on console than on pc
---
Always look around you while working on gens.  Mikey is prolly right there breathin heavy.
---
At least I'll be able to play him in Mk11. That'd be badass. Although I also wanna main Baraka :,(
---
He is fast, but he has the same movement speed as most Killers: 115%
---
I've been thinking a perk kind of like corrupt intervention (?) Where totems are not lit for the first minute or two would help
---
At high rank i only rotate all of them so i dont get rusty. But if i know im facing a SwF or a sabi squad i use my freddy ir myers since i main those.
---
Hillbilly, Spirit, Huntress, Nurse, Hag.  
---
Those are the best killers. Against a team of good survivors Hillbilly's the worst, but against randoms, he's probably 2nd/3rd place.  
---
Unless you're on console, then Nurse is just... dead.
---
I'm mostly hyped for his story ending
---
Stop running it then stop dying
---
Or stop running it and then still cleanse totems
---
He really isn't though man....He's one of my favorite killers to face actually.  He is still very loopable and grants additional free loops if they are particularly chainsaw happy.  Also chainsaw jukes are a thing.
---
I did. Still haven't changed my mind. You think him or me getting downvoted would do anything? Nah, idc about the virtual internet points. 
---
Life is simple. If you disagree, debate. If you can't, you shut up. It's that simple. 
---
I cant care less about the people who will upvote what they want to hear and downvote everything else.
---
Thank you for the facial cleansing talk. I feel more informed. Lol!
---
I tried farming with huntress last night. kept giving stopping during chases to give the farming signal, and hacked at pallets to signal them to throw it. they never picked up on it. hooked 3 anyway, the last one near an open gate. stood probably 30 feet away to let them unhook, signalling all the while with my axe. they all swarm the hook anyway like Laurie's being camped, bodyblocking her all the way tot he gate despite me not throwing hatchets. then they all teabagged at the gate cause they thought they won. so I'm not going to be nice to dipshits anymore.
---
You're welcome. 👍 stay beautiful, brother.
---
Wasn't that like a 1.5? I feel like a 1.5 happened
---
Wow Claudette is super cute here lol.
---
I think having a built-in borrowed time and free unhook is worse.
---
Huntess has an amazing snowballing potential while still being hard to loop because of her power. I'd say she's in 3rd-5th place.
---
I get accused of stream sniping a few times. Streamers think everything is about them, when literally no one knows them. 
---
If you don't want to be stream sniped, maybe don't have your username be a URL to twitch.
---
Hunttress really isn't a bad killer though. We are talking the same game where Trapper and LF exists.
---
Also every character is crutched by add-ons, that is kinda the point. You could argue that every survivor is crutched by perks using the same logic. Hell, the only reason Nurse and Billy is good is because they cut out 99% of the bullshit: Fuck pallets, fuck windows, short chases and a metric ass ton of map pressure for free with their add-ons being more busted than any guy Sub Zero pulls a fatality on so why wouldn't you run their busted perks as it's not like the game even gives a fuck how you accomplish something as long as you do. 
---
I would also say this game isn't shit, it's fine, it's fun. It has problems but I still have a better time in it than say Overwatch which is pure cancer baked into a game.
---
People blame all their losses on SWF, and then they never get better because they thinks it’s always SWFs fault that they lose.
---
My slugs!
---
My precious slugs...
---
Also NOED was everywhere, holy fuck
---
Call me weird but I kinda like that as Killer. People will gladly go for hook-dives and guess what? You can sleep the unhooker (If he's not already asleep) and sleep the guy the instant he's off the hook, allowing you to sleep half the survivor team (At least) for free.
---
I play surv and usually it's the killers that don't want to
---
Huntress changes her tone and pace as the match goes on from what I've seen.
---
Watch some of Sverkeren play her, you will change your mind - https://www.twitch.tv/sverkeren/videos
---
Huntress used to be my main but she is unplayeable at these ranks. Okay I'll get some snipes since I played her a lot but she has nothing against looping
---
If you have been playing this long and you still let what other people say after chat get to you, you must have thin skin.  Killers are supposed to kill and survivors have to survive. Do w/e it takes to complete your objective. When it's all over Just give em' the GG if it was, or  just leave lobby. Let people get angry all they want. Playing tilted only makes them a worse Survivor / Killer.
---
Anyone can be a douche but when I wanna farm with the other survivors and the killer the killer usually just ends up camping and tunneling off hook. Can't have nice things
---
He does feel faster tbh
---
Against a Trapper make sure windows and pallets aren’t trapped BEFORE you vault/use them
---
Against a Hag be sure you’re crouching when walking to avoid setting off her traps
---
Against a Huntress pallets and windows are no longer your friend as you’ll get stuck in a vaulting/throwing animation and be vulnerable to hatchets (Bonus Tip: her hatchets hitboxes suck around various terrain, crouching behind MacMillan crates etc)
---
Almost every killer can be looped. And those that can't, just keep running. If you're playing against a good killer it's very hard to hide. AND NEVER CLEANSE AGAINST PLAGUE.
---
I mostly play killer, so I have't encountered it. I have seen it being posted multiple times on here though, so I'm kinda wondering when the devs will get to it. I think I may even have encountered survivors who were affected by it.
---
Spirit is a really fun killer who is also one of the bests but hillbilly huntress and the hag are good too
---
1) It's a concept
---
2) They literally added licensed cosmetics with Ash when he came out. You're the third person who I've explained this to.
---
JUST A L I L B I T
---
Its one year old but not much has changed I believe?
---
Nurse with sloppy butcher but no nurse's? That seems a bit counter productive since you'd down people much faster with some juicy aura reading. Then again, it's nurse. Don't even need perks on her
---
I love the perk [deleted]. Just straight deletes players from the game. It's a bit OP though.
---
ever see a tiny dog bark at someone from the other side of a glass door? they're that dog.
---
When your against the trapper you watch out for his traps. 
---
When your against the crapper though......well good luck.
---
BPS with    infinite loading screen
---
Please make it so totems never spawn near anywhere I spawn so by default I'll know never to check the entire fucking house, that'll make the whiny bitch killers happy for at least 2 games before realizing it'd help us finding it even easier.
---
I will never understand the hate for Franklin's.  We don't even need items as survivors.  I personally hope they run it every game.  It's like playing a 3 perk killer.
---
Bullshit if true. I wonder if all survivors suiciding on their first hook results in a depip.
---
I would rather it makes them scream, (I.E, you have some dickhead that's spamming unhook on you, or the killer is nearby), alerting the killer that someone's being a dickhead
---
maybe the games not for you? i enjoy playing it.
---
no just a lot of people are salty about them as they are technically considered the most OP thing in the game and are unfun to go against, especially if the killer decides to tunnel you right after a unhook
---
Use kindred.  When all 4 survivors have open handed kindred becomes 40 meters range for all survivors to see the killer 0-40 meters from
---
The hooked survivor
---
No, but nice assumptions. Debating people like that isn't worth the time and "lol no one owes you anything snowflake" isn't an argument worth having. It's a pretty dumb and selfish opinion he dragged out into 4 paragraphs of self serving bullshit you found logical probably because of the length. "What they want to hear" is what they agree with and think is valid discussion. If you think there's a bias against you in a public message board you need to look internally. 
---
I blocked the guy after I read comments of his so I can't reread his shit. but if I recall his main argument was that no player is obligated to help any other player and their performance has no impact and if you lose you don't deserve shit because of a hate for participation trophies, right? While you're not obligated to, it is a team game if you're a survivor and saving your team helps you. While not obligated, it's pretty stupid not to. 
---
If I also recall he started it off with some attempt at dismissing their opinion with some BS like "here we go.." lmao. 
---
Also, you get points for playing and finishing the game and only a bonus for "winning" so that entire thing is just ignorant. His bullshit "participation trophy" thing doesn't even make sense and it was wasthe result of his inability to not bring politics into everything. 
---
To say that the tactics of others has no impact on your outcome or experience is also so insanely ignorant I'm questioning if this guy has even played the game. If you've played over 10 games you'll realize things outside of your control, whether dumb survivors, dumb killers, asshole killers, or asshole survivors will impact your play and experience. To think that the playstyle of others won't impact you is insane. 
---
Not to mention his entire tone overshadowed his entire message. If he didn't come off as an arrogant prick, later confirmed by his comment history, I would have debated him but I don't really care to speak to pricks.
---
Not much has changed in her mechanics, but the amount of bad maps for her has increased, making her a worse killer, as she's very map dependent.
---
It's just annoying. Trying to blow through these games as quick that's why I bring items since it's bloodhunt.
---
It's a Freddy Buff though lol
---
Can u fucking inbreds stop posting this, you realize they get salaries for making skins right? You know who they could hire instead of skin-maker #16, someone to fix the fucking bugs you fucking degenerate 14 year old.
---
It's also a good way to mess with Survivors and screw around with their altruism. Set a trap or two by hook, leave, and let them set off Make Your Choice and a trap. Easy down, easy hook. Makes the survivors actually weary of traps instead of just yeeting through them, like some do.
---
good killers shouldn't use it*
---
I'd say "whatever works for you" if it was about me, but I'm complaining because he listed LF as if he was some kind of top tier
---
I was accused of hacking because a survivor died on his first hook and he was the only one left...
---
or... you didn't notice it?
---
I can assure you, you get them back. it sometimes takes a while, but you will
---
The quality content I subbed for
---
Not a great Idea. however, I think there could be a perk the killer could take that would make that happen. It would look a bit like this:  After the last generator is done all totems become unbreakable.   
---
It requires a perk slot , so not all killers are going to want to use it and only some totems will want to run using it, so no longer Ruin, because they have completed the objectives and is useless, some for haunted ground. Best perks to run this in sync with, would be noed and devour hope.
---
This is a prime example of how rounding a corner properly can be the difference between two and three loops. Poor huntress kept cutting each corner way too wide, losing any distance she'd gain on the short stretch
---
I saw a, uhh....nsfw 'research' video where the 'mom' says "Just a little bit". Wonder if I can send that to monto to be included in his next video.
---
Christ you're a fast reader.
---
Trapper, Wraith, and Doctor. I used to be a myers main but then I prestiged him and just now got some good perks back so I'll probably pick him up again with nc, m&amp;a, and bbq.
---
I agree LF is trash tier more or less.  Doesn't belong in the same breath as Billy or Myers.  I just really dislike the dependency that perk instills on its users.  It is seriously detrimental to killer play developement.  Promotes the worst game losing habits like over committing to chases and weak map pressure.
---
I can crack like every single bone joint I have
---
so yea, I do stretch like her, I even replicate the noise
---
So to go deeper into this , scout the terrain near where you are going to set up for a gen. This area you will most likely be stuck running the killer, yes you will lose some seconds on the geny but make up for them in the chase.
---
We need his wedding outfit too https://i.redd.it/jk7uuu8ndbq21.jpg
---
If you're on a gen against Freddy stay and see if you get a skillcheck and mess it up and run. If you don't get a skill check then run. Also don't finish the last gen against Freddy if he's on you cause most Fred's are end game and you'll be caught 1st. Don't dance when Freddy is putting you in the dream world it wastes the little slow down he gets when putting some in the dream world and try to get someone to wake you rather than skill check.
---
You've never seen a 4k from a killer?
---
yes
---
I don't get them because the bloodpoints spent is not worth 25% of a generator over 3 seconds
---
I'd give my right hand for that! 
---
R.I.P Candy though
---
I feel cleansing against the hag depends on the set of add ons she is using. If she is doing the Super high affliction rate, then dont bother. However, if your stuck doing an unsafe hook and you know it? Go ahead and heal but do it as far away as possible.
---
I see your a man of culture as well
---
I deranked to rank 9 because of it and never went back to 8 until I played a game to rank up.
---
RIP Candace Barr
---
Fun fact: in the original manuscripts, the number and mark of the beast is 616. It was changed by the Vatican to 666 for unknown reasons. :^D
---
To be fair, the likelihood that someone's actually gotten ruin from the shrine is fairly low, just because it's rarely there. With a week per reset, most people don't bother waiting and just buy hag. She's a decent killer now too, so no real reason not to
---
I never use noed myself (unless I haven't leveled a character yet and it's my only "good" option) and I know this perk is trash and teaches but habbits, but I see why people on low ranks use it. if it didn't work, people wouldn't run it.
---
I got bbq on all killers.
---
^^^^^And ^^^^^noed.
---
Rotten fields has a few spawns like that too. At least corn conceals them a bit there though.
---
What a dick. He clearly doesn't understand the game. Who the fuck plays killer to kill people?? Lol. But for real, I hate survivors with that mentality.
---
Hmmm mm mm
---
Camping, dc s, highlights were farming and feeling like survivor was worth playing point wise
---
This is exactly what I was going to say. If has this many issues with the game, they probably should move on to something else rather than expect that enough of the issues are going to be resolved that they'll start to enjoy it.
---
I have my problems with the game too, but if I ever got to this point with a game, I would have been gone long time ago.
---
That’s what the Unmasked Michael looked like in the first Halloween movie, had a messed up mouth and a milky eye
---
Takes a screenshot at the start of the game when survivors commonly spawn next to each other and will probably start working on a gen together as their objective is to repair 5 gens.
---
"Fuckin' toxic gen rushers."
---
I had 3-4 pure farming games which was nice. Every game being pure farm gets boring fast.
---
Only a few campers. All in all, I was pretty happy with it. I've got every survivor perk on Nea now and I was able to level up Legion and Plague to 50 so now I'm done with teachables till the new chapter.
---
My best moments, were honestly how talkative a lot of people were. I've never had long and funny discussions with people in post chat before, usually people just say "gg" and leave, but I made a lot of friends this bloodhunt.
---
And then there were the survivors who called me the n word. Gotta love dbd!
---
My problem with it is that even our games pros are settling at rank 5 and very rarely rank 3. At least I can finally compare myself to their skill level I guess.
---
I tried but I'd start a lobby and dick around my phone and then get so lost in my phone since it took 15 minutes I'd forget I was playing and suddenly hear the timer go off.
---
Lets see, I got trapper to 40, I got Bill to P3 from P0, nurse to 40, found and bought the trapper perks on Bubba and Dr. , got Jane to 30.
---
They should revert that totem to not showing a hex is active.
---
Well its been a day already and I still haven't got the pip back.
---
They won because they did the only object a survivor is given*
---
Seriously, survivors can cleanse totems which wastes a ton of time as a solo player, or simply sit on generators. Even powering through ruins make them fly by super fast because it's  super rare that skillchecks regress more than the generator progresses. It's tested and true that just immediately jumping on a generator, and humping one until the exit gates are powered is the best way to play. Gen rushing is the equivalent of saying 'Survivors did their job well' - It's not even derangatory
---
it's a rare bug. no one can see your progress bar when that happens
---
mist affects can be good for both survivor and killer. The salt add ons are a waste of bps
---
I guess it does
---
That's a very rare bug, happend to me exactly once
---
The problem is that they can't do that, how could they without messing with the "immersive" gameplay and tight-roped design they've got going on?
---
Out of the loop here, just hit Rank 1 with Freddy after 8 intense hours from rank 14.. Wzzz up? XD
---
Unless it's like 40k, I agree
---
Hey, I'm a Feng Main as well (and quite vocal about it).
---
Spine chill
---
I got to play only the last hour. First match a farming plague, okay, great. Second match quad BPS, killer DCs. 3rd match, 3 BPS...loading screen of death. 4th match, tunneling billy with my last bps. Good times.
---
huntress SHOULDN'T try to throw hatchets there.
---
every BP event is like that, has been for 3 years now.
---
&gt;All of your points are valid to some degree but I still love this game a lot.
---
Exactly, the game is fucked in so many ways but people still like it for what it is, myself included.
---
Freddy's more likely to get a first hit, and while you can spot Wraith moving around, Freddy's just a lullaby(And moving grass, but that's much harder to spot than a blur), meaning you could unintentionally walk directly into him. Wraith does however have the advantage of turning invisible to play hit and run. Freddy disappearing is immediately apparent
---
No I don't have that high level of autism that people who spend their lives on reddit, aka you, have.
---
Even as a Killer-main I experienced a real rush of serotonin on that DC.   
---
***Gorgeous, baby.***
---
I mean the only thing salt inducing about doctor is that you can facecamp with treatment and theres nothing survivors can do.
---
I've had some success with Monitor, Sloppy, Thanat, and Ruin. Have to kind of ping pong around and refrain from extended chases. The standard Ruin, Enduring, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury combo is fine, but you lose tracking and Freddy really needs multiple people to be asleep to avoid being pointless. Discordance instead of Bamboozle can be quite useful for sleeping multiple targets.
---
Those auric cells tho
---
You're living your best life lol
---
You dont even know how to play killer right you’re supposed to let me live
---
Actually, Jane has them too with her V-cut store shirt.
---
Dead or Alive By Daylight: Fog Volleyball
---
\*breathes in Nurse.\*
---
I agree and I'm rank 7-8. (not extremely high but ya) 
---
I honestly think she's pretty good the way she is tbh. I think an add-on would be interesting but in the end maybe too OP. Just my thoughts on it.
---
This game is definitely not pay to win. None of my regular survivor loadout perks are from DLCs, and I'm in purple ranks (currently eyeing red!) For killer, I only use perks from unlicensed killers 95% of the time. 
---
Just because there is a meta doesn't mean it's the only way to win, and even those who use the meta don't necessarily win all or most of the time.
---
It really was the worst double blood hunt I’ve ever seen. Barely an BPS on PS4. And even then, didn’t get any that farmed. 
---
If this game wasn’t such a GRIND for bloodpoints I wouldn’t care, but it is. So it’s unfortunate.
---
Implying that survivors don't have the advantage in literally every other situation when it comes to hatch. Having at least one killer where you literally can't escape hatch unless they want you to isn't a salt factory. It's a flip of the table
---
I didn't really deal with too much crap during b loodhunt, but the only streamers I ran into the entire time were ones I used. Nobody else used them and it saddened me
---
Eh. I usually just buy the $100 pack to save money. That’s been there since ever lol. Ironic considering I also have street meg.
---
Spent about half my time as survivor and half as killer. Had a decent number of farm games which was nice.
---
Funniest moment was one round when playing Myers with no add ons. Pulled 2 people off gens, both of which DCd the moment it happened. I wasn't farming but the first guy couldn't have know that. Last 2 stayed but I ended up killing them to get on to the next game.
---
Got about 2M bloodpoints since I had the luxury to put some life stuff on pause for afternoon grinds.
---
Its a flawed beauty, I honestly wouldnt want it any other way.
---
it does. if you kill everyone too quickly, you depip
---
I wasn’t talking about the hatch exclusively, I was talking about Doc in general. I’m excited for EGC in that regard because standoffs are lame.
---
are you really that blind?
---
Oh no I'm definitely done with the game, removed it from my library completely actually, but I thought I'd air my(and some others I've come across) grievances with it because why not.
---
Maybe it has to do with DBP. I’ve been getting trashed by SWF all weekend
---
I think if they increased the percentages a bit, it'd be a bit more worth it. I think the difference between like slightly and moderately is maybe 5%? If someone has the actual percentages I'd appreciate it. 
---
(At work and not able to check.)
---
I dont want to say that, but yes, it has ended :(
---
But that's the point of BT. It lets you hook farm without 100% fucking over your teammate.
---
There is an escape, run. No one in their right mind would stay and mend. Run for a few seconds until you're clear then mend away. It would be perfect as a hex.
---
again, Good Luck
---
Agree 101%, this game is somewhat harder for solo players... but can't complain. I've met both trash bags and "gods".
---
I don't really know what you're wishing me luck on when this is just a concept post I made but aiight
---
Nah not as match goes on
---
That and a few abilities you can pick are what breaks the game at the moment, two things they would have to adjust to make an overal better Dead by Daylight. I should have mentioned that I do not suggest getting into that game right now either.
---
Kinda sucks when it's close to the exit gate, but yeah I can see that.
---
Killers by a mile, for a single reason.
---
When a new survivor with new perks comes out, I have to pay money to experience that content.
---
When a new killer comes out, I don't have to pay anything to experience that content.
---
From the point of view of someone who likes playing survivor way more than killer.
---
I will be honest when I say that the speed boost from noed is my lest favorite part. The one hit down is kind of annoying, but the speed boost is what really takes away counterplay from you. I started running hope just to counter that boost. Also good against killers like Huntress or legion who move at 110%. Suddenly you’re moving at nearly their speed and it makes catching you a lot harder for them if they misuse their power.
---
I see your Naked Ash and raise you Naked Leatherface!
---
TLDR/W:
---
About 5 million copies sold to date, original sales estimate was 400k-500k, which was accomplished within the first few weeks of release.
---
They went from 35 person company to 500 and plans to hire more.
---
They use player feedback, data analysis (which is apparently a "big team") and gut feeling.
---
They have new found confidence in themselves to release original IP.
---
Hold on there bucko, if that happens, I'll have to learn how to play with one hand!
---
Nurse doesnt really care, landing an extra hit is pretty easy for her.
---
Then you tunnel the shitdick Mettle user out of the match for running that unhealthy perk.
---
Perhaps if there wasn't a perk devoted to getting multiplicative BP bonuses and an entire fucking emblem based around unhooking survivors, people wouldn't rush to unhook.
---
4.4m/s* Not Hag with shoes speed
---
What is this, comedy?
---
Go try it, report back pls ;)
---
The lessening the dark mist is pointless legit I've never seen anyone play it.
---
That's exactly what I was thinking that way they'll know that the killer is camping so they'll be able to do a generator. Although it'd be best if it the boost in repair speed was balanced to where a person could finish a generator before they advanced to the next stage
---
Oh god, what were meg and Claudette doing to Jake?
---

"I'M DoNe With tHis GamE, SWF eveRyWhere anD SurviVors are tBagginG Like littLe ShitS"
---
I'd love a massive DLC pack where each of the original 4 survivors gets a killer version. Even if they get added one at a time in DLC chapters like usual.
---
They just need to make it do the reverse actually and stop instadowns, anything that would bring you from healthy to downed you get to avoid it but say you are hindered afterwards for like 60seconds.
---
This way its a soft counter to things like  NOED/hillbilly/iri-head huntress/devour hope etc etc
---
He won't listen, he got better things to do lol
---
Removed - No salty messages of any kind
---
Map pressure is king. It's why Billy is so damn effective.
---
I never realized this game was that successful.
---
Myers got a ton of potential to punish the survivors :D
---
Now to turn the bracelet around, put someone in a headlock, then start singing songs from the South Park movie.
---
He gets looped tho
---
It's the BBQ rule.
---
I only play killer for dailies and BP, and if I get all 4 BBQ stacks I've won the game at that point.
---
Just play meta then, nurse, billy, spirit
---
Extra BP doesn’t mean your game is suddenly not a broken mess!!!
---
*sad oink*
---
I really thought it would end later today so I could get a few more games in now I'm sad :(
---
What u mean? He gets looped super hard and loses a ton of time when putting traps
---
You get better items with plunders too.
---
Was it possible he crashed on loading?
---
Whenever I run it it is mostly for the funsies. That said a logical reason I can think of besides doing a daily is that for people who can't do positioning very well it helps for points of reference.
---
Facts lol and both very annoying
---
That’s what I assume. Why would he lose one of his streamers just to troll?
---
But my point is they should have deployed the new patch before running the bloodhunt.
---
Did I fuck up the numbers? ,-,
---
I managed to level up every single survivor perk to level 3 with Ash.  Job done.
---
I use plunderers w ace in the hole on my p3 characters that have no items
---
again, Good Luck.
---
This does sound good
---
It could've just been luck for me, but I always seem to get a couple of vital trap hits each game. Run add-ons that give you more traps and place them all around one area. Add-ons that darken traps are surprisingly effective too. He does get as looped as any other killer but if you're smart with your traps it doesn't last long, there are enough traps on the map that you can completely nullify certain gyms or pallet infestations
---
*weeeeeeeeeeeeellllllll's in Cartman*
---
Pair it with AITH and become everyone's Secret Santa(well, only until the match ends)
---
Imo, the role of survivor is a bit easier than killer. Or at least it's way less perk specific. If you are good at hiding and looping a killer you may do fine with any perks. Likewise so many survivor perks are situational. So if you are using borrowed time, and the killer has devour hope, you have a wasted perk. I see more wasted borrowed time perks than any other, since I never camp as killer. It's just an example but I think you see what I'm getting at :)
---

---
There was a survey from behaviour that the community could complete. It listed all kinds of things they intend to implement or fix or add to the game. I believe the colourblind option was on the list.
---
Here's a video from hybridpanda explaining some of the ideas: https://youtu.be/D9QqmTTek4g
---
The survey is now closed though
---
Ehh that one extra hit allows for an extra one or two loops which, depending on your build, can be very taxing. Most times it even forces me to switch targets which is usually the smart move. Bonus points if my next target also has MoM tho. Smfh.
---
Swf increases likelihood of escape. It doesn't make you better at chases, hiding, etc.  That's why you don't see swf all the same rank.
---
gotta agree with the guy you can be bat shit awful and hit rank 1 if you just grind
---
Yesterday I played 2 games with the trapper to do his daily (catch 3 survivors in bear traps).
---
1st game - No kills, 4 hooks, actively trying to avoid tunneling, no camping and only caught one survivor in a trap. Result: Brutal killer. Totally fair.
---
2nd game - Nobody escaped, caught 3 survivor's in bear traps, actively trying to avoid tunneling, no camping, and at least 9 hooks (I remember hooking two survivor's 3 times and the only survivor that died on the first hook was a Jane Romero because her piece of shit teammate wanted the hatch). Result: Brutal Killer. Alright then.
---
Again, that's true with a broken system (kinda what we have) That wouldn't be true if it was working as intended...
---
Best moments: when I wasn't playing.
---
I've been running Borrowed Time, WGLF, WGMI, and Prove Thyself. I like my BP and I'm alturistic or always gen jockey. Might as well get points for it. 
---
If I'm not running that I'm running Lithe/Balanced Landing, Prove Thyself, Botany Knowledge (under-rated perk in my opinion)/Small Game, and Spine Chill.

---
Yea, her weapon is huge compared to other killers' weapons.
---
Anyway I also like spirit, but playing with the same killer over and over becomes kinda boring imo, just wanted to switch things up a little bit by using Plague
---
Neither NOED or Adrenaline are op.  
---
Adrenaline is nothing more than a speed boost if the survivor is healthy, and that's only if they make it to the end of the game. NOED can be completely invalidated if not all of the gens get completed or if, at the end of the game, there are no totems left.
---
Either way, both have the potential to be dead perks, the same way they have the potential to be game-changing. They can both be countered.  
---
Neither are op.
---
I do

So the entity is Pennywise, if the spider in the TV miniseries didn't look like shit.

From Jeff to Shia LaBeouf in a matter of seconds

Make it on a cooldown of some sort. Else it would be brutal with overcharge
---
People want itemz
---
free itemz are good itemz
---
I like it for green and purple toolboxes also a plus if I win with it
---
That's like 6 whole seconds spent even potentially walking directly away from the hook, then they dont even need the NINE seconds of no scratch Mark's, they would be gone by then. The perk idea as a whole is,,,, cooool I guess, but just so over powered in numbers, maybe like 1.5-2 seconds max
---
well I ended with 600k definitely not gonna try and spend it all

Never been so exhausted by a whiny post that I skimmed through.
---
Doing gens, You?
---
No doubt it'll be fun to puke on people, can't wait to try her out
---
no. it means you killed everyone too quickly
---
Genrushing, you mean their only objective? Would you rather they loop you?
---
yeah, I have 1500hrs but I rather stay at ranks 5-10 because really whats the point getting to rank1? Sweaty killers with ruin, bbq, noed and moris everytime? No thanks. I want chill games. I dont need to escape everytime, I just want some fun.
---
Thank you.
---
Mmmph. Daddy ash
---
This is way too accurate it hurts. Could have put Frank's Mix Tape in it tho. I went against 3 Frank's Mix Tape Legions and a 5 blink Nurse. I wanted to get my Michael to P2 and I still have around 10 mori's on him but I don't want to be mori people during Blood Hunt so I'm just waiting for the event to end. I got mori'ed so many times in these few days :/
---
BBQ snacks
---
I Tbagged a billy at the gate once and wasn’t as close to the exit as I thought I was. I got hooked and sacrificed and I learned my lesson that day
---
I'm pretty sure the only thing that affects her, is not being in a chase for too long. You can try it in KYF, her lullaby will only change, when she doesn't find any surviors in a while
---
Well I hope they do anything with what they got in there. You are right though it is on the list.
---
never had that happen to me. guess thats with facecamping into one hooking every single person?
---
true true I kinda have a biased opinion tho as I think they should just replace the pip system with something else xD
---
I usually run plunders because, from the recent buff, it's possible to get ultra rare items from chests. This means that getting dull &amp; ultra-rare keys are possible which are items I would argue to be the strongest in the game right next to toolboxes. 
---
Getting anything other than a brown item from a chest is a godsend &amp; plunders helps with that.
---
Keys can allow you to escape horrible situations &amp; with the end game collapse coming soon it can be used to reopen the hatch after it has been closed. 
---
You can also use plunders to find where the basement is on a map. A minor use but it can be good for giving you an idea of whether its a smart idea to loop the shack or run away from it unless you risk being hooked in the basement.
---
You didn’t have to show us this image
---
First one to say so, so I think I'll ignore it.
---
But who pays for the pallets?
---
I poked the bear but they fired the first shot.
---
I'm starting to think that streaming is a net negative in gaming. People just can't play in good faith anymore.
---
I haven't read all your gripes tbh and what I did read I wasn't agreeing with. I don't think a pay for perks system is a good idea, they have colorblind options for PC and have been talking about it with console, and no, changing the hue of things does not ruin immersion or make it cheap. The distance you can see things is the same and it isn't like they went from orange to neon flashing green. It's just more shaded towards yellow instead of orange or whatever the setting is that works for that person. Scratch mark and gen aura colors are not what makes the immersion in my opinion and changing them isn't a big deal. At the very least they can keep an eye to make sure no one is mentioning any abuse of it. 
---
That's all I gotta say
---
Fuck, same here. That was way too short.
---
Here’s to hoping we get another one before the end of the summer.
---
I actually had fun against a nurse last night. I did experience a LOT of toxic tryhards (like, taunting, camping, slugging, tunneling, etc), like, almost every freaking game, but I almost NEVER ran into Nurses (or the Plague, or Freddy).
---
If she doesn’t chase anyone for a while, she’ll start singing it a little crazier and start laughing if you wait long enough
---
Clown has base movement speed
---
that's the point. it only adds another 100%, so it's not gaining any value this way. Why don't they like wait until they fix this problem.
---
they just risk losing their rare stuff and then complain when they actually do
---
Two people DC'd on my game and the killer still tryharded the fuck out of me and the other player :(
---
i love it
---
Come on baby, that's just what we call pillow talk
---
Fair enough, but the original question was why fix rank without rewards and the answer is matchmaking. A system that can evaluate how well you play can match you with others that can play like you. It's pretty valuable, but it doesn't have to be a pip system
---
I would choose Dwight. Leader and Prove thyself are amazingly good for doing your one and only objective: Gens.  
---
Then, when you find other survivors and they see you have leader, you can stay together and organized.
---
It is an interesting suggestion &amp; I like the ingenuity of it but it seems to be one of these perks that a low-rank survivor will suffer seriously from while a high ranking survivor would be impacted by it. 
---
This presents the same issue as overcharge where its useless against skilled survivors which makes the perk useless while working well against lower skilled survivors which make low-rank lobbies hell for survivors.
---
I mean if you don’t like looping maybe this game is not for you? You should learn how to outplay survivors in chases, not just hold W all game...
---
report them, don't fucking post that there.
---
 **3.Shaming other players**
---
If you make a post featuring other players in a negative light, censor all usernames. Shaming other players by name encourages harassment, drama, and witch-hunting. Absolutely no calls to actions against other players, such as mass reporting or blocking.
---
Username checks out.
---
I did not have much fun this weekend. Too many killers played so toxic that the games were NOT fun at ALL for anyone but their own selfish butts.
---
Being rank 1 and going against a huntress is scary. you cant just dodge them bc they read you easily, you have to be smart and outplay them every moment you can. You obi have never gone against a god huntress and it shows.
---
Nurse, Spirit with Wakazashi Saya and Yakuyoke Amulet and I-Head + Infantry Belt Huntress are the only truly "OP" killers in this game.  
---
Those are things that need to be changed(even though Nurse is a problem herself, there's no changing her without a complete rework).
---
Think this has the same logic as replacing the Icons, where EAC can't really detect it, or do you think EAC might detect this. Personally I doubt it could but you never know.
---
I did. But i want to see that person banned. All the survivors are my friends. Also his profile is private. When he gets banned ill delete the post.
---
There are no rewards, its just a chance to be on a leaderboard on a streamer's stream.
---
Really works both ways. I ran into so many meta survivors with Adrenaline/MoM/instaheals over the weekend. You never have one without the other. It's not like killers are the only ones that can be tryhard.
---
Got accused of hacking because the survivor didn't know you had to mend to avoid getting downed with legion.
---
I just kept seeing them go down when I'm on the other side of the map chasing another survivor
---
Do I really need to specify that this is what I meant?
---
This is fantastic! Did you make it or where did you get it?
---
Trying? No, showing.
---
She's most popular at a rank only new players play.
---
You can dodge her hatchets with ease on mid to high.
---
You admitted you can outplay her at rank 1.
---
Okay but they have to be safe unhooks or you get plenalized.
---
Thank you all so much these tips are very helpful
---
Ah ok I see you’re logic 
---
So spirit and hag are technically useless killers Bc there not popular, I understand now thank you &lt;3
---
[**This can be captured here**](http://deadbydaylight.tereliye.host)
---
With PI3, more games than not I get at least one key from a box
---
I hate playing survivor and people insta DC because they see that someone has a mending bar
---
they didn't change chase mechanics to prevent moonwalking? must be too difficult to change. but if they did, it would make things so much easier.
---
tfw you get a broken key
---
Its easy as killer, but torture as survivor. If one survivor dces and the killer curb stomps the rest, they depip. Or if the killer farms, its also possible to depip.
---
Seems like you can't differentiate between a bad killer and a bad player. If you're complaining about getting looped while playing as the Spirit and Huntress, that doesn't mean that they are bad, it means you are bad at using them. Neither should ever really get looped if you know what you're doing.
---
Lol. "Nurf Lejion. Dey broken. Hax0rz!!"
---
Claudette for self care still.
---
I love how Adrenaline is better at waking survivors up than Wake up
---
They where safe unhooks. The survivors just decided to run into the killer when they simply could have run away
---
Deep wounds timer now doesn’t go down while you are in killer’s TR, stops while you are mending and killer doesn’t see progress bar.
---
For real, was playing a game with two friends yesterday and a random but we all managed to get out and the killer was cussing us out and said they was gonna let the random escape and only kill us for playing together lmao was willlld
---
Yeah it's really dumb. I guess that's them admitting they can't play against legion.
---
making it deep would sounds ok. even pre-nerf dep wound. 
---
however, if its deep wound, we *might* end up with people abusing that to deactivate it.
---
I don't think it's toxic it's just annoying
---
i got a lot of perks i wanted to T3 on my claudette. now i finally have a decently perked up survivor. also a whole lot of cakes and envelopes. :)
---
When killer DC’s at the beginning I always get 5000 free points, i asssume it’s the same at the end of the trial but i can’t say for sure.
---
Good starting killer - Wraith. He's the most basic killer. Another killer may be billy.  
---
Level Bubba to get BBQ, and David for WGLF.  
---
Get Dead Hard/Balanced Landing as they're the most fun exhaustion perks.  
---
Get Enduring, Spirit Fury, Ruin from their respective killers.
---
Yeah lol
---
Omg this same scenario happens to me and my friends but it was a trapper turned out it was some twitch streamer too xD
---
Well not really the thing that makes t3 Myers more deadly than plague vs someone in broken status is the fact he has super long lunges. IMO if plague had her yellow apple add-on built into her kit she would be a lot better off. So then she could at least have one red fountain in every game. If she had that 1 fountain and used it when everyone is broken it might cause others to cleanse themselves giving her some more red fountain juice. But idk just an idea I thought of.
---
Why is he salty ?
---
you can also look at the grass around you on most maps
---
Sorry, I guess I'm the idiot here. I ended up putting my phone down between threads and ended up getting them crossed. That was the one with the guy complaining about getting looped as Spirit.
---
Regardless, just because you can dodge most attacks from most Huntress still doesn't mean that she's a bad killer. A good huntress won't miss while you're trying to dodge and will be able to hit you over walls by clipping your hitbox. The problem isn't that you're a really bad player, or even a really good player, but from the way you talk it seems like you only rarely, if ever, play killer. Power levels can look drastically different from different perspectives.
---
Of course I don’t depip if I get a 4k, I just exaggerated for the meme, but a +1 pip isn’t always granted if you get a 4k and I don’t face camp, slug and even avoid to tunnel

Either you don't have a 2060 or your processor was found in 1989s garbage cause I have an old gen i7 and a 1070ti and frame lag has never and will never be an issue with dbd

Contrary to what Reddit would have you believe, Self Care is still incredibly useful in any situation that isn't you and three other competent friends over comms running Bond.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
^^Also ^^Freddy ^^exists.
---
At high ranks yeah, because people instantly kill totems but unless you're SWF then yellow, green and often purple ranks don't do that.
---
The best way to go is in any order, Dwight, David, and Claudette. Dwight and David have good farming perks and the uses of Bond, DH, and Selfcare are amazing. Also, using only teachables for them isn’t hard at all. Except for David for obvious reasons.
---
&gt;impossible
---
Haha, not really considering you cannot physically derank anyway. Not sure if it's happening for everyone but for a month or so now I keep gaining pips and ranks whenever I restart my game. I am currently rank 9 1/5 despite the fact I DC a bunch and don't gain a lot of pips either from finished matches. I should be rank 13-15.
---
Guess I was not clear enough. Refresh the page.
---
They are fine, you're not supposed to be able grind them out to buy stuff. I think of them as a currency that piles up and I can get something cool with them once in a while.
---
I don't usually care about the survivors because I think of getting them for free with the chapter packs.
---
Shirtless ash
---
I see you are a man of culture.
---
Not a thing? Dude i envy u for not finding a killer reporting u for PLAYING THE GAME PROPERLY
---
As someone who floats around 10-15, I can concur. Tons of noeds, always a game ended. I never do SWF either, but idk. Just my experience.
---
Boil Over isn't that useful in that build, I'd rather use an exhaustion perk like Dead Hard. Another great perk would be Adrenaline.
---
Meg looks gorgeous on most artwork, but ingame she looks like an inbred crackhead.
---
Well neither of those are true so take that as you will. Can't possibly be the game no way.
---
First off it's not toxic, it's a set of perks. People are toxic.
---
Second I'm just going by what I've been seeing and also said some of the most popular. Never said they were the most popular. 
---
Third take the stick out of your ass
---
Fourth have a nice day
---
I mean, throwing a killer into a nearby doorway can be the difference between getting hooked, and running free.
---
The problem is that people who start today want everything now, and that's what the cells are for. If you've been playing for a long time or just don't pay attention to the shards they do pile up and you can get plenty of stuff with them.
---
And... all gens are done.
---
it happens when you play tombstone myers or when you kill 5 survivors too fast, with not many chases etc.
---
Let's be honest. Match, 3 deads, 5 gens left, Lubally's at 5 tokens, I stood in the basement gathering points slowly, when he came to the basement, I stunned him with head on and started the chase, which lasted around 2-3 mins. So yeah, I can understand why he was kind of salty.
---
This should even be happening at rank 15...
---
I get all that, my main point was that if you're legitimately stomping the survivors in the match and already killed 1, there's no need to turn it into a farming game because you've already generated the vast majority of the points that match can give you. When normal matches last 10-12 mins, adding on another 3-6 mins (roughly 33%-50% of a new match) for even 6k (just 25% of a normal match or 20% of a farming match) before bonuses is just inefficient. Better to end it and move on to the next if you've already had to go full throttle anyway. 
---
My secondary point was simply that you can apply pressure to gain the survivor's cooperation without having to kill someone early, thereby allowing you to have not just 3 but 4 happily farmed survivors per match if you're not interested in maximizing your total BP gain for time played. If you're not able to do that, what areas are you having trouble with killer in-game? Are you noticing a lack of one of the 4 scoring events in your normal matches?
---
No cosmetic costs 10$, the max is 4$ for a cosmetic, and 10$ for a full outfit.
---
Not even remotely true lol. The only thing you guarantee by getting 1 hook on each survivor is a bronze emblem in the Devout category. It's very much possible to have a chain effect of hooking one survivor causing another survivor to immediately be found near the hook (therefore losing no Chaser points) which results in just about nobody getting saved. It's even worse if you use one-hit down abilities (Hillbilly, Leatherface, Myers), pick people up from bear traps, or don't heal each other because you don't get the full Chaser and Malicious points you normally would get by hitting them twice to down. So if you get a 4k by survivors constantly making mistakes and playing really bad, you most likely won't pip.
---
When I play as killer, Boil Over does nearly nothing against me.  
---
Boil Over's main feature is hiding close hooks in places like LT walls or inside buildings, but you can just get away from them with Tenacity.
---
Good thing the 11 people that use Plunderer’s commented or we would have a lack of information.
---
&gt; There is tons of idiots that say the totems can be cleansed but this realistically never happens in solo queue until you get to red ranks with survivors that are actually competent 
---
This quote denies your entire point.
---
you fucking denied yourself.
---
git gut and stop complaining
---
Also i get it’s annoying but what else is there to do thats like saying as killer “u cant win the game i want to win the game! So you cant gen rush or loop cuz thats playing the game how its meant to be played and i dont want you to do that!”
---
Coordinated SWF groups are theoretically stronger than the killer. However, I think the issue is that even theoretically low tier killers can pick apart SWF groups as long as the player themself are actually good. I think the issue is that there's plenty of bad killers who think they're better than they actually are, and they perpetuate this narrative that killers are grossly UP and Surviviors are grossly OP and they're the source of all the issues within the community. My example? Tyde Thyme.
---
" You can spend bloodpoints on the shrine. " I don't see what that has to do with letting people still buy whatever perk they want at any point with a sale on the shrine. Make that the sale, buy with bloodpoints instead if it's on shrine!

---
Otherwise, grind for it.
---
Honestly, totems as a whole are a stupid idea. No matter how "random" they make the spawns, people are al8going to have no trouble finding them. I would suggest making it more challenging by having certain totem perks respawn after a set period of time, in a different location. E.g. the hex totem gets busted at the start in that house? well, if it is ruin for example, let it respawn in an other random totem location (killers shack for example) after 90 seconds. Survivors get a notification, the old totem in the house regenerates and the game continues
---
I mean, are those survivors also running Flip Flop while you slug them?
---
Similar to being a Doctor and accused of Lagging/Hacking so much that they couldn't interact with pallets and instead I "instantly broke" them.
---
Jesus dude, I am NOT reading all that. It’s not that serious. For as much as killer mains like to say “oh I can play this game however I want” I’m sure not allowed to play how I want
---
This hurts to watch.
---
I use *The Third Seal* a lot because I like the blinding effect, but my god I can't tell you how many games it will be gone in the first 10 seconds of the game.
---
Nice job. Just commenting to search when I get home.
---
Alright so whats your thoughts on perks that give an extra health state for the survivors? Like BT and MoM?
---
Nah, waste of perk. Would rather run iron or agitation.
---
Got called out for using "Wallhacks" on Legion.
---
Apparently they didn't know your position is revealed after applying Deep Wound.
---
I've gone against two people running a similar build, and it still didn't do much for them. I still managed to get them to hooks after slugging.
---
Well, in my experience, it works fine.
---
Damn Bandicom, haven't seen that in a long time
---
Well, it's very annoying what you did. You should just let him kill you instantly, because it was no hope to escape with 5 gens left.
---
First off, yea, that's correct, it's still a build made to be annoying
---
Second you literally said those are 4 of the most popular when DS and MoM aren't really used this much
---
Third thanks for the advise
---
Fourth Thanks, have a nice day too
---
Best - remove pallet vacuum and instant blinding flashlights.
---
Worst - "All killers don't need to be rank 1 killers."
---
I really didn’t care if I was getting blood points or not. Im not really the type of person that cares too much about ranks so to me losing one match didn’t mean that much
---
dude the 'entire fucking house' takes like 13-14 seconds at most to check
---
Wtf is this
---
Ah my b, thought you were being a toxic rank 1 where noed is less common.
---
XD
---
 We had two slugging games in a row Legion then Doc, i haven't been slugged in forever.
---
I'll keep an eye out for people with those builds. Heck, I might even run it myself and see how it works then.
---
Yep, I agree. But I never waste shards on the shrine for about 4 games worth of bp, and mine tend to pile up and I spend them at 30k.
---
There's honestly no point, plus I keep de-pipping because killers always DC. Went from rank 4 to rank 5 because 2 killers DCd in a row.
---
Jesus dude I just thought we were having a discussion about game meta and offering to help your killer game if you were noticing it lacking. No need to get so worked about it. And I'm not sure what killer mains have to do with any if that?
---
Really? I don't lol, for me it's very inconsistent. Sometimes I'll get them, other times I won't. Sometimes it'll show me in the end screen that I got them, but when I leave my point counter is 5000 short. Other times it'll just simply show 0 survival points. Is my luck just shit or something?
---
Why are you just assuming that just bc nurse and billy are the top picked at rank 1 they are THE ONLY good killers? spirit and hag are fucking crazy good and i dont see them up there
---
The thing is that the devs do not want to change NOED for 2 reasons. 
---
One is that it has gone through so many renditions that the devs are probably sick of looking at the perk. Any changes I could see is perhaps increasing movement speed but removing the exposed effect or just having an exposed effect with no movement boost. 
---
Two is that the devs want them to be a risk associated with not cleansing dull totems. To remedy the issue of games being completed way to fast due to short gen times, the devs want players to have a reason to cleanse dull totems. If NOED didn't exist then there would be no incentive to cleanse dull totems. Dull totems would become irrelevant. 
---
The whole idea of making NOED force the killer to 100% movement speed as opposed to 115% would be such a significant nerf that the perk would be useless. NOED is really strong, bordering on O.P. if the totem spawns in a secluded space but forcing such a nerf on the perk would make the perk trash tier.  
---
I would suggest either buffing the movement speed &amp; removing the exposed effect or just remove the movement boost but maintain the exposed effect. 
---
The perk still needs to be powerful as it relies on survivors not cleansing all dull totems &amp; it also only applies during the end-game meaning it has to be worth something.
---
I think it’s a bug. A friend of mine also always lose the pip if he wouldn’t have gotten the safety pip for the game. I always get my pip back. He doesn’t. It’s frustrating.
---
hag spirit and huntress all have 4.4 move speed (huntress &lt;4 with a hatchet held). If you want a strong power, you get slower move speed (unless you're billy).
---
I’m not worked up dude, it’s quite the opposite. I don’t care enough
---
How often are blood hunts?
---
The ranking system is based around the "how", not so much the "what".
---
I definitely suffer from corn vision 😂 Esp. on Huntress.. With immersive claudettes all wearing brown.. Totally random map too! I cried on the inside.
---
You absolute *monster*.
---
The amount of salt this event gave me is enough to give me kidney stones.
---
I am quite sure it’s a bug. Had it myself till the last update now a friend has this problem as well.
---
Like the old DS it's a perk that rewards killers for playing poorly. I wait eagerly for the day it's removed.
---
There's a difference between "of the most popular" which is what I said and "the most popular" which is what you said. Also the build is for surviving against a killer, if they find it annoying then so be it. So is shit like ruin and BBQ and chili.
---
WAAAAA!!
---
Severe* my B.
---
so where's the problem? you straight up said that survivors on low ranks don't do something that high ranks do and they suffer because of that. 
---
Should one ask devs to remove dead hard's invincibility frames so killers can't complain about missing?
---
Yeah it can be hilarious when the survivors completely fail at the end game and you don't get many hooks by the time gens are done but then manage to get a 4k because their brains turn to mush at the end, or sometimes not even at the end.
---
And Michaels lots of Michaels
---
Why DC? I dont think that's fair for any side nor it is allowed within games EULA, you're just gonna get people temporarily banned.
---
Having the killer at the same speed as survivor could make this perk a complete hindrance. 
---
The whole point of NOED is to allow newbie killers get a kill or two more at the end of the game. Skilled killers usually dont like to rely on an end game perk but rather something which is useful throughout the game. 
---
This perk can easily be balanced by making it clear it is present in the game once all generators are completed, additionally, a totem counter would be a huge leg up for solo survivors such as myself. If NOED still appears to be somewhat unbalanced at this stage the perk could be changed to give a negative 4/3/2% to the speed for the killers.
---
For the low low price of $4.99 a month, you too can sub to my channel. Or, if you have amazon prime, you can sub for free! ~~No, seriously, give me your money~~

DS is fine as it is. It's meant to stop tunneling, which it does really well.
---
I’d support this.
---
That isn't live yet. I think they meant old bt with the white bar.
---
We both said "have a nice day" so we shouldn't continue
---
but I have to ask... why the fuck is everyone complaining about BBQ? People run it for points. POINTS! Aura reading is secondary and you can easily counter it by getting into a locker
---
Honestly with the amount of grinding required to P3 characters and unlock perks on different characters they really need to do these double BP at least every month or every 2 weekends. I was able to P2 my Trapper and unlock a few perks here and there but not nearly as much as I thought I would get done. 
---
I also think it would cut down on the BS from these double BP events if they were more often.
---
Yes! Make Survivors gain bp even harder!
---
Exactly, as killer, when a survivor runs adrenaline, it impacts me maybe 1/10 games? But as a survivor, when the killer runs NOED, it impacts me probably closer to 1/2 the time. Either it demotivates me from going for the save, or I get one shot downed. With adrenaline, I'm rarely in a chase with a survivor when it pops, and when it heals someone else who was injured, chances are I'm already in a chase with someone else, and they weren't in any danger of being downed. As someone who plays both sides, adrenaline is nothing compared to NOED. If you want to compare a survivor perk to NOED (meaning it can single-handedly win you the game), compare it to MoM
---
Yeah that can be quite effective but If the survivors are good and commit to the gens theyll get them done even if it takes em longer than usual.
---
I was on Spirit farming BP for the first 2 days. I was the only one using BPS so I decided to kill everyone but the last person, 4th gets hatch in my games because I like ranking up slowly. I was more frustrated when I swapped over to survivor to play and got left to die on my first hook more than once.. These events bring out the worst on both sides but at least when I'm on killer I have control over it :(
---
I'm not sure why you wanted to disagree with my original statement then if you don't care to discuss?
---
no counterplay, you say?
---
*laughs in surv ninja*
---
Also, NOED seems to be the early version of EGC, you either chance getting swatted like a fly, or GTFO, at least that's my impression.
---
MoM requires you to have been whacked by the killer several times over the two needed to knock you down. Hardly comparable since one takes one shot from a faster killer the other requires several hits from a faster killer, getting away, and healing. And one shot downs the cannibal, the hillbilly, the pig, and the plague don't effect it.
---
One persistent tunnel kinda kills any chance of using it.
---
Modified the meme after a recommendation by u/slimercream
---
Not if you get slugged, your teammates lure the killer away from you and all go down, if you get chased for 1 minute, if you are forced to hide...etc.
---
So you're saying RUIN is a bad perk too then because it can get cleansed. In fact, it takes 4 less totems to cleanse AND can be cleansed any time in the game. What a bad perk! On top of that, the impact it has on the game is even less than 3 minutes worth of time. FFS survivors can even just ignore it if they can hit their skill checks!!!!
---
That doesn't help Trapper, Wraith, Hag, Doc, Clown, Spirit, or Pig. All have zero counterparts against MoM.
---
It does not when the killer knows it and sluggs u till its gone, thats the point of this post, that it doesnt tick till u are out of the terror radius. Same as the Mending and RBT. Some ppl are just sweaty tunneling they dont care about time loss they wait just to kill u and annoy u
---
Maybe hex totems are what becomes of survivors who've lost all hope.
---
Sure......................................
---
Jeff looks cuter than ever :3
---
Oh, I don’t camp hooks lol, I just hit the guy that was on the hook if I catch them unhooking.
---
At higher ranks it's mostly either 1. boosted killer or 2. caught by surprise because people don't usually try to 360 at higher ranks.
---
Not true, entirely. Yes, a lot of depips are caused by these kinds of killers, but more often than not.. If you don't get the 4K before the third gen is done, or one or 2 die on first or second hook, you will depip. The system is based on 12 hooks, with a minimum of 24 hits on a survivor. This also doesn't take into account damage to gens and breaking pallets, plus chasing. If you don't chase, you depip. Billy struggles the most with chases in this system, as his chainsaw sprint doesn't count.
---
I'm gonna be honest, if your competent enough as killer, you will succeed. Don't let yourself get looped, and make sure to defend the gens, its easy to get 4ks, even against competent survivor teams. 
---
So,don't go bragging you got one, its not hard if you play smart.
---
You gotta love these hit boxes
---
Borrowed time prevents face camping. There is nothing wrong at all with this perk. You shouldn't be able to insta down somebody that is just unhooked. As a killer you should always go after the unhooker, which is what I do. By doing this you never even see borrowed time making it a useless perk for the survivor. The only killers that go for the person being unhooked are honestly bad at the game and looking for easy kills. If this perk didnt exist, unhooks could result in instant downs for the injured person and there would be more reward for tunneling and face camping. Mettle of Man is a bit more on the iffy side. I dont use it but it does allow a survivor another chance before going down. It does take 3 stacks however which means that you either already escaped a couple chases successfully or you were already hooked once. Other killers completely bypass mettle of man with instant downs from chainsaw like billy. The effectiveness of this perk really depends on the killer. I believe it is a balanced perk because it doesnt work for all killers.
---
NOED is a counter to survivor gameplay - hit speed boost and killer recovery is a key part of escaping which isn't there with NOED. You can't rely on teammates in solo to do dull totems with you unless you're high rank, so you have to do them yourself, meaning you don't do as many gens/saves/heals/chases etc, so you get fewer BP and emblems. Alternatively you die to the NOED and end up depipping and dying right when gate is open. I'm not saying to completely remove it's viability or anything, just a small change to make it in line with most of the other perks. I'm also not saying that some OP survivor perks shouldn't be nerfed if they're crutches - in fact I'm an advocate for it. Just look at how many people agree and have complained about NOED and I think you might see there are some aspects of it that could do with tweaking.
---
Sometimes those are fun to see if they're particularly impressive though. I wouldnt really compare a screenshot of the end screen to actual gameplay clip. It's more similar to when someone posts a clip of them catching someone tbagging at the gate and kills them.
---
I’m 50/50 on the idea of a totem counter, on one hand it’d be incredibly useful when playing with randoms, but on the other I feel like it would break the tension around endgame a bit because you’d know for that the killer couldn’t get NOED
---
Don’t forget all the camping on PS4, it was tent city from Thursday till today!
---
Thanks for the tips. I think I’ll go for Nea instead now and put Claudette on hold.
---
I was in that game, you camped whole game because you couldn't get a kill, it's funny that you run to reddit like a little cry baby over a game, hey maybe if you'd try the tutorial, you'd actually get some kills :)
---
Xbox is the land of tunnels.
---
Shit went so deep they ought to call the killers Plumbers
---
Not reading into it. You just won’t admit that you’re a hypocrite. 
---
You say a survivor DC’ing ruins the game for the other survivors. 
---
Except that shit runs both ways, and you’re too fucking stupid to comprehend it. 
---
Killers DC’ing ALSO ruins the game for survivors. You rob them of a game, potential saves, potential chase points, and all other manner of blood points, all because you can’t win a game without Ruin. 
---
Boo-fucking-hoo!
---
You’re sitting here, willing to shit on survivors saying “oh you got face camped?! Too bad! Deal with it! Don’t DC!” But at the same time crying your eyes out of your Ruin gets destroyed early in the game, when in reality you can’t STAND the flip side of that statement, “oh your ruin got destroyed! Too bad! Deal with it! Don’t DC!”
---
Where did you learn logic? Because whomever taught you logic needs to be slapped in the face.
---
&gt; just crazy powerful
---
IF used correctly. It's extremely weak when Claudette is scared self caring in the corner against a Legion running sloppy butcher. It's a trap for some players. You need to know when to self care and when it's not worth it.
---
I'll not complaining I'm just starting there are annoying perks on both sides. Plus isn't that hypocritical given you were literally complaining about different perks in the first comment?
---
It's not a community mentality; there will always be assholes in multiplayer games. The best way to deal with these toxic behaviours is to implement legitimate repercussions for undesirable behaviours (e.g., DCing, holding the game hostage, etc.), and to actually try to balance the game in a way that doesn't pigeon hold players into picking up specific perks. 
---
At the moment, killers are practically forced to run Hex: Ruin as an attempt to slow down the game just a little bit. Survivors also have essential perks, such as escape perks; however, they have a lot more diversity/flexibility when compared to what killers have to deal with.
---
As of late, it just feels like BHVR has been putting band-aid fixes on significant problems, while simultaneously releasing new content that, if anything, add new problems; meta-related, or otherwise.
---
Killers are TOXIC for KILLRUSHING. They should leave survivors alone and stop being such jerks that do their sole objective.
---
So you guys get the tunnels and we get the campers!
---
Need that United meme posted up about this, the tunneling has eased up a good bit since the Decisive strike rework, not to many killers tunnel anymore on PS4 until this event started but holy hell the camping was off the chain!
---
*cusses into watch*
---
*make a fist*
---
*open hand and electricity flows*
---
“HUHUHUHUHUHUHUUUUUUU”
---
That's the point though. If an SWF has all yellow ranks and one red rank player and you are a red rank killer, that is not good matchmaking because once you figure out who the gen jockeys are you can ignore the kid who can loop and decimate their team.
---
So does a 4k!
---
you can still counter it 
---
it made the entire match easier, because killer was running 3 perks instead of 4
---
noed should never grant more than one kill
---
actually, it's stupid, I know, but in my opinion noed should be in everyone's base kit. once the exit gates are powered you should get the F out asap, and getting caught when the game's done should always result in your death. 
---
before you call me a toxic killer main, I've spent more time playing survivor
---
Yeah I do the same, I know I'm gonna get future cosmetics so I save money by just getting the 100 and that lasts me a long time.
---
I know unbreakable, flip-flop, and adrenaline but I don't know the 4th.

It's till used a lot, want to know why? because it's fine as it is.
---
Pretty sure Jane's new perk isn't top tier because everyone runs selfcare and runs to the corner of the map to heal, so you rarely get a chance to use it. 
---
There are 60 seconds between hook stages, You've more than enough time to self-care and still make it.
---
no it punishes you for being good in a chase 
---
you will never see it go off if the killer cant catch you in the timer 
---
its a perk that is not worth using anymore

In the survey they had many ideas the community could vote on, one of them was auto punish of dc
---
Reminds me of the days when literal facecamping (Standing right in front of the hook) would block the unhook prompt. If you did that like in the image, the survivor was 100% guaranteed to die no matter what. 
---
I.E. even if other 3 survivors  were standing right there, they couldn't get a unhook prompt and you could just sit there or go AFK and the guy on the hook was 100% doomed to die.
---
Especially asshole killers would do that to the first survivor they downed, wait for them to die (meanwhile gens are being done) and then go after the next, etc.
---
Oh it's not jis t Reddit I just found Bond to be better in general, but then again low ranks almost no one heals one another
---
Here you go: https://youtu.be/ju8yXC98xD0
---
That guide isnt the best IMO, overrates blocks quite a bit.
---
You can make the killer down you, ds him, waste some time and still be able to lead him around for a lot longer, as he'll need to wait for the cooldown on successful attacks, pick up time and stun time.  
---
Just don't use resources.
---
I feel like a complete totem overhaul would add flavor to the game, how to balance that or what that entails I’m not sure, but things like perks or certain killer powers that can add effects to totems would be nice like invisible duration or a dupe totem would be nice ( and could go very well with a ghostface or Myers killer). The dupe totem could bypass the totem counter and not visually show on the UI but a well seasoned totem hunter could let their SWF know there is a additional totem ( alerting of the dupe) which would be a nice excuse for a totem counter.
---
Honestly with how squishy totems are without thrill of the hunt or certain killers * cough spirit*  I would personally just like to see a revamp of the totem system as it’s both unpleasant as killer and survivor.
---
Oh man, you'll get tunneled and then slugged till DS wears off.
---
Nobody complains because is fun to see how shitty this comunnity can be and the salt that comes with it
---
Its a shitty perk that rewards shit players for playing badly, im still hopeful it will be removed or totems are totally reworked to be a true secondary objective rather than just a waste of time
---
11 out of 10 killers suffer from corn vision.

Sleep as many people as you can, try keep at least two people in the dream at all times. Dont be afraid to switch targets if the survivor is headed in a super safe area. Best addons for him are range addons and dresses (only use the yellow dress tho). Got a good guide here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628612661
---
No ones gonna stop playing, NOED is bullshit but just keep asking for changes
---
Jeff looks so cute aggh
---
Claudette and Meg first as all 6 perks are good. After that just pick whoever he wants, no other perks are that important
---
Bloodhunt ended a bit ago :( But I am close. Then I can level my bing bong boi and dead waifu up
---
I dont get slugging, I can never find anyone I don’t immediately pick up had the last guy bleed out from full because I lost him.
---
I think it's largely dependent on the survivors and the skill level they have (and especially if they're SWF or not).
---
I had several variations of references to farming and BPS as a name too, although I was never that plain lol. Hell when I tried to coordinate the first couple groups to throw Party Streamers everybody thought I was trolling for free BPS and threw Escape Cakes for some reason. I slammed my head into the keyboard when I read that.
---
Smh sorry ;^;
---
If you or a loved one suffers from Corn Vision you may be entitled to financial compensation.
---
It bugs me they have yet to expand on lore really. Like, make Vigo or Benedict Baker a killer.
---
10% off!
---
Usually people do it to prevent the Hatch. I do it too, but only, ONLY if the survivors left alive are dicks
---
if I'm forced to equip the same 4 perks on every M1 killer what does that tell you?
---
Yeah I ended up playing survivor for the first time with my friends 3 days ago, went from rank 20 to rank 7 from then to no, just playing casually, doing suicidal plays, playing with the killer, barely doing objectives.
---
Don't think I've actually seen a de-pip in the entire time I've been playing around with them.
---
deerstalker or use your ears more
---
Dont really care anymore. I dont run it much anymore. Modst the time ill get saved and killer will find me again when it has 15 seconds left and its useless bc ill just run them around. Run MoM instead.
---
"oh, everyone is saying survivor has too many second chances, well, we got rid of D-strike, hm. Oh, give them an endurance perk just for getting hit".
---
Yup, I got DBD on PC after playing a while on PS4 thinking it would be even better, but fuck man the toxicity on PC is depressing. It's straight up just not fun. PS4 might be a downgrade of a few things but at least I actually enjoy playing the game.
---
hmm, I'm not even a fan of DS, but I can see the validity in this. On the other hand, even that little extra bit of wiggle room to use the perk could be abused by survs who just skirt the TR to keep the perk from being "wasted".
---
DS is fine the way it is, the only thing i'll like is the timer to stop when you're in a chase with the killer. like, why am i supposed to play poorly only to get use of it. it is a anti-tunneling perk but a good looper won't get down within 60 secs. (ik, if i waste that much of the killer's time, my teammates have enough time to do gens but many of us only play as solo)
---
&gt;Borrowed time prevents face camping
---
and Small Game prevents NOED, problem solved.
---
Ah got ya.
---
the only thing that bothers me about NOED is the haste buff 'cause i don't mind the instadown since i'm so used against it.
---
This is me. Wanting to dc but not at the cost of my fellow survivors xD
---
Yeah thats once of the changes I'd make him A tier.
---
For real, when I was first starting out I was getting 4ks and 3ks almost every game thinking "wow, I'm awesome at this game!". Then I got past rank 10 and that's when reality starts to hit you.
---
Alright that's fine, I understand, I've mixed up threads before. It never ends well.
---
I'm still trying to find a Huntress that I can't get around a wall before I'm hit or one that can't be ducked under if you can vault faster than they can reach for their hatchet, which can be the case in a lot of corners.
---
Rarely, if ever, play killer? That's a little presumptuous. Stop making up arguments.
---
An actual reward for prestiged characters? No can do :)  
---
Great suggestions though!
---
Finally got all the survivor perks on my Jake 👌 Time to do it all again on my Trapper 🤷
---
That is some fresh material for some DBD creepy pasta.
---
True, but I quit playing survivor because of how bad it got. Made a ton of points and had fun with other survivors playing killer and got a ton of Ty’s, gg’s and Ty’s for not being a asshole like everyone else!
---
I've had too many games where the killer has noed and will get two or even 4 kills even though they got little to no hooks all game. It's a serious crutch and I feel is completely unfair. The only real counter to it is to just cleanse every totem you see no matter what. It isn't a perk that banks on skill or any form of utilization. It either needs to be balanced heavily or just plain removed.
---
DS is fine now, it stops tunneling and its really good at endgame. Its not meant to let you be an invincible tank
---
That or you're Michael and you have t3. No point in wasting it.
---
I rather die if im one of 2 left, than no one get hatch.
---
You seem like you have anger issues.
---
Want to hug it out?
---
mori does actually make sense "lore" wise. Entity is giving you a freebie, but doesn't like you taking them all the time. Remember seeing that in some tooltip, if I find it again I'll edit it in.
---
But the times where I just play better, and win, then still de-pip because I didn't slap them around and let them have some fun, stare at them a bit, then watch them run off, is annoying. I should at least safety pip.
---
I ranked up more letting survivors go after farming, than when I do good, if that's not broken, I don't know what is.
---
I see your point, but there's some glaring issues here.  
---
The first is that NOED isn't just a high punishment for not doing totems. It's a punishment for missing even a single totem in the process of doing gens. That's really really harsh considering some of the maps have incredible totem hiding spots, especially on maps like Lery's and The Game where you will probably never find them all, even *with* SWF. Heck, I just learned of a new totem placement the other day that I'd never seen before on The Game, right next to an exit gate (between a van and a wall).   
---
I'm not sure removing the speed boost or the insta-down ability are the proper way to go, but I do feel that similar to TOTH, it should weaken with the number of dull and hex totems removed from the game. That way if it activates while a single totem is still standing, it's nowhere near as bad as if all five totems were left standing. In this way it's rewarding to survivors who took the time to get the totems, but not harshly punishing them for missing a single one. If implemented, you could both boost and nerf NOED. Missing all 5 totems punishes survivors harshly, while missing only 1 totems doesn't punish them a lot.
---
The next issue is that the only reward for cleansing all totems before NOED activates, is dull totem points. You removed a hex fromt he game before it could activate, and as such, I feel the person who removes the 5th totem before the last gen pops should receive a hex totem bonus. Yeah, it's not a huge difference in BP, but come on, give them something for doing the job right, ya know?
---
I think the final problem is that some killer powers put a TON of pressure on survivors to ignore totems. A good Nurse is all over the place, especially with BBQ. Having time to stop and do totems against her isn't always possible. Meaning half or more of the team could be gone by the time the gens are done, and then she also gets to instance down the rest of the survivors.
---
cutie legions are an odd sight
---
All those killers are only really OP against randoms, a good SWF will dick on any of those with ease.
---
Basically every Myers game :))
---
What about Daddy Jeff? He’s a hottie right?
---
i dont need hugs from pussies
---
The old system was awful, too. Sure the better players were up there, but so was everyone else and their mothers - the skill level disparity at rank 1 was huge, especially on the survivor side, likewise destroying the experience. While the adjusted system is not great either, red rank players are more competent, on average.
---
With how rng the game is there is no way to avoid all 5 totems not spawning near a single survivor, sometimes the games gonna give a sucky spawn. More often than not now the totem spawn isnt bad
---
I understand that that they are a company who need money but there is sometimes a perfect line between always needing money and allowing players to keep grinding their game and enjoying it. I might get hate for this but in my honest opinion Rainbow Six Siege has the best ways of monetizing their game by making a pass for 8 characters and get them a week early as well as grinding out its currency as a way to get them individually without paying money for them at an increased grind rate. If DBD had a perfect line like that, then the game can potentially become very profitable for Behaviour. (But idk though because I’m not a game dev, just assumptions)
---
Your 4K doesn’t mean shit when you hover around the hook. Survivors need to heal and unhook to pip, killers need to hook and damage survivors. It’s a mutual system to prevent players from doing boring crap like camping or tunneling. 
---
From the survivor side you can avoid the killer all game and complete every gen without anyone being hurt or hit and it’s also a bad score. The sooner all players realize this, the sooner games will be more exciting at higher ranks.
---
I liked being on the killer side of it. I didn't bring moris and the survivors were pretty cool.
---
I don’t care about rank anymore, the ranking system is complete garbage and BhVR keeps taking there game and throwing shit in the trash. I did 3 saves, 2 totems, 2-3gens, was hooked once, opened the gates and left, 
---
DEPIP! How the fuck! After this I’m done with caring about ranking up or down BhVR can go fuck them selves and I hope one of you shitty devs reads this!
---
Yes but a 4K is way more common then 360ing a high rank killer
---
You’ve never heard of Halloween outside of dbd??
---
I feel personally attacked. Also, don't forget to like and subscribe to my YouTube Channel "SuperTrapper69" for EPIC 4k games!
---
People usually play with bad killers and don't even try to mindgame or not even use good perks and complain when survivors do their job.
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse, Bloodhound, Ruin, BBQ &amp; Chilli
---
Totems already serve literally no purpose and are a waste of time except if the killer has NOED. There needs to be more incentive to cleanse than the killer running a shitty perk
---
Yeah so hire better or more bugfixers like I said? And my counter-scenario for your "bugfixes take at least 5 years per bug" and say they just don't really give a fuck and prefer making some of that casual skinbuying trashpeoples sweet sweet money.
---
Im a survivor main and I am fine with NOED honestly.
---
I was mama Pig this event and it made me so happy. :3
---
you do not take into consideration here that he can just slugg you, if you are one of the last survivors  then he can just slug and camp you.
---
I really like the idea of a spy character. I'd tweak some of the perks a little though. The grunts of pain part of Not Again is pretty useless(especially for someone who always runs iron will like me). Maybe it could be replaced by removing bloodpools for 5/7/9 seconds or something like that. Also, Quick Fix has too wide of an effect. I'd make it work within either 16 or 20 metres with the same boosts. It promotes risky play and could combine well with technician. Low Profile seems good to me.
---
BBQ, Nurse’s, Ruin, and M&amp;A with the Dead Rabbit and J. Myers Memorial is my favorite build in the game.
---
No, I'm not going to get mad at people who are trying to win, killer or survivor. Whether or not it's fun is ultimately a design and balance issue.  I get why killers tunnel and I get why survivors stack second chance perks.
---
How?
---
Ok! Thank you!
---
Tenacity
---
&gt;so i had to send a message to them
---
They almost certainly arent on here and even if they are they arent going to care
---
You forgot the part where they fucked up Technician when they did this and made it so you were actually LOUDER. Can't remember the exact source at this time but iirc it's still currently bugged out and shouldn't be used. (I used to use Technician as a newer player because quiet gens and less penalty for failed skill checks. gotta learn somehow)
---
That’s been the normal spot for a totem since I’ve been playing, and it’s been a year now. Almost every game I’ve played on haddonfield this totem is there! 1st one I always check on, sometimes lit sometimes not but I’m getting rid of NOED for my random solos :)
---
Haha, that is who I am normally! &lt;3
---
Have my Karma!
---
That tier 3 gonna f you up!
---
Yea, also I hate wasting time on hatch standoff, I rather sacrifice those 5000 points and go to the next game 5 minutes faster.
---
Its fine how it is just fix it in kyf and fix the timer so that it counts when you get picked up not when the skill check comes up I got picked up at the end of the timer and didnt get to use it by half a second
---
· Kills the killer
---
Im glad hatch standoff should be ending
---
I screenshotted my first r1 surv. Now I cringe when I see others do it. Gotta laugh at our nooby days ya know.
---
Are you implying that  Behaviour doesnt care about DS anymore and thats why players should opt out for MoM ? sounds pretty legit to me
---
#
---
I don't know. I just got hooked and the camera started following the killer.
---
Best: Remove the godforsaken instablinds.
---
Worst: Remove the timing off of flashlight and pallet saves.
---
They slug you, they waste a bunch of their time.
---
Don't forget the SWF bully squads who burn BPS and then try to burn the gens and leave ASAP to tilt the killer.  Those are fun.
---
Yeah I play the same way. Most killers don't seem to know or care you get more points if you actually let them make rescues. If I see somebody running towards the hook I ignore them and go chase somebody working on a gen instead. It makes the game go slower, and I'm guaranteed 29k points before bonuses whether or not I kill anybody because I can max out every other category.
---
Against a good Nurse, even really good SWF will have a tough time.  
---
And Spirit might have a chance with the add-ons I mentioned earlier.
---
True and end game is coming, to bad there isn’t a secret offering to make them think they have 15 seconds left when in reality the timer has run out and that teabagging Claudette gets moried on the spot by the entity and you get the last laugh!
---
I KNEW THAT BUT ***KATE HAS JIGGLE PHYSICS***
---
You were one of the rare killers on PS4 this weekend,
---
That first line was already pretentious as shit. The rest was just a dumpster fire.
---
Imagine being so mad(bad) at the game that you willingly call out for other people to become as much of a bitch as you and D/C the moment something they dont like happens.
---
Last week I got a message "Reported. Enjoy your ban." After a match. When I asked why i got the reply "Hacking you had no terror radius."
---
I was a scratched mirror Myers on Lerys.
---
That happened to me 4 times this weekend while using BPS playing as killer:(
---
She's already halfway there!
---
This bloodhunt all I did was put the Plague’s perks on my completed killers...10 of them. This was about 4.5million  bp...
---
They need to remove tiers entirely; especially considering how negligible ranks 1-3 are on perks nowadays.
---
...you know you could struggle out, right?  Like it or not, you would have bled out.  And if he spent so much time fussing with you, he'd never have gotten the 4th.  Killers are actually slower (without agitation) when holding a survivor.
---
It's so disappointing when the entire SWF DCs on each Devour Hope mori. . .
---
You know, it's honest work for the 5 stack and then they just skimper out.. :(
---
Their time is more precious than yours.  
---
While the killer is wasting around half a minute slugging and camping you, the other survivors can get a bunch of progress on gens or, if you're coordinated, set up for a save, while others do gens.
---
I know people have no obligation to but I find it disheartening when they send me a message saying theyd drop me on the hatch
---
When you think the killers gonna hook you but puts you next to the hatch but has a cypress mori and kills you next to it
---
God Quentin get over it. You're acting like he killed all your friends or something
---
Anyone knows where to find chases themes? :)
---
This was an interesting bug. Had that happened to me once on PS4 though
---
Perfect game
---
Nothing apart from the achievement.
---
Have you seen the new Left Behind? It's crazy! 75% gen repair speed once you're the only survivor left.  
---
You can repair the gens faster than what it takes for the killer to find the hatch and close it, forcing the EGC.
---
Yeah it's not much of a blow if that happens but if they do this maneuver it will be your second hook. I'm not worry about the time wasting I'm worrying about being tunneled and killed and depipping because a killer doesnt want to take a stun. It only matters to me if I get a extra chance or not.
---
Absolutely. Tombstoning an entire team is a terrible way to earn BP.
---
“those are SOME survivors, however EVERY killer says this” how can you not see the irony
---
R u being sarcastic
---
I want something like this, because I would die laughing!
---
I've got two words for you: Fire. Up.
---
So you fuck everyone else over. It's a team centered game.
---
To everyone saying that DS is fine as-is, I got two words for you:
---
Memento. Mori.
---
So not only is it easy for the killer to just tunnel a survivor, slug them, and then go out on patrol or chase another survivor to wait out the minute, then come back and pick them up again, but they can just kill them outright and circumvent the perk entirely in a matter of seconds, and the survivor can't do a freakin thing about it.
---
No other perk is as easy to counter as DS. And yes, I'm including perks like NOED and Devour Hope here, because even Hex perks require survivors to waste time look for the totems before the perk is nullified.
---
Was DS OP before? Sure, I'll hand you that. But it's current setup isn't the right answer either.
---
They are fucked anyways because of the Legion, might as well end it quick.
---
It didn't matter. The other survivor was too busy hiding to do anything, just waiting for the hatch spawn. I struggled out twice before before it was clear he didn't care. The game was 10 minutes of actual play and nearly 25 minutes of two idiots too stubborn to take action. For me it absolutely was a hostage situation because the game was long since over, but I could not leave despite my best efforts. I'm sorry if you feel differently, but it was an abuse of gameplay mechanics to prevent someone leaving, which for me was very much a hostage situation. If you disagree, that's fine, but it was a super shitty situation.
---
LANA NO COOKIE BANANA needs to be in dbd.
---
Yesterday I spawned right next to the corner totem on The Game. The killer was a Billy and despite the fact he went to his totem right away he couldn't stop me from cleansing it.
---
Reread my original reply, I was agreeing with you, but you're clearly just looking for an excuse to not talk about it. Have a good one.
---
y'all clearly haven't heard about Monstrous Shrine
---
Don't worry about it, this whole thread is just a bunch of shitty survivor mains that are bad at survivor AND killer.
---
I only play with a group of friends so we’re not ruining the game for anyone, but when one of us is face camped by a bubba we all dc. Fuck that noise. We play because the game is fun and we enjoy it and don’t care about our ranks all that much. We don’t let the game finish out and flame him we just move on and get to the next game.
---
Getting slugged is infinitely better than losing one of your hooks, and also you can prevent them from being able to slug you by literally just getting in a locker -- if they want you, either they pull you out and get DS'd, or they stand there at the locker for a minute.
---
M A D E  W I T H  M E M E A T I C
---
Except you can slug 4k or camp a 4k. 4k doesn’t mean you played well.
---
Sometimes I bring another item such as a key, but I bring along Pharmacy just to heal real quick then give it to a teammate.
---
This.
---
&gt; No other perk is as easy to counter as DS
---
imagine having this much of a victim complex
---
Would have to see some of those tournaments my dude to believe that
---
A good amount of killers would run them and I’d ask the chat to help too. Never got a 5x tho. One game I got a nurse in my swf and we all got 32000 each, with 4x on it.
---
Um yah I might drop by to see what it’s like
---
Wasting time does help to achieve the survivor's goal, it buys their teammates time to do gens.
---
holy fucking salt my guy
---
It’s subjective, but for the ranged killers she’s about as enjoyable as Clown, but not as much as Huntress. Her power is fun when survivors cleanse otherwise the game is rather tedious and you won’t get many points even with a 4K.
---
I wish she wasn’t so tall.
---
Best we could hope for is disabling moris but it's not gonna stop people from being assholes. Public shaming actually works tho.
---
SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!
---
Damn can’t get healed for that minute that killer went on patrol or went after other survivors feels bad man I guess you can say memento mori out right counters every single perk in the game.
---
A possible way to punish MoM users is using rancor. MoM increases obsession chance so just avoid them don’t get stacks and instamori at end of game. 
---
Not good enough to call it a counter but it should punish users of MoM
---
While we love to hate it at times, no game has captured the “Asymmetrical Multiplayer” feel as well as DBD and I’m glad we have it. 
---
Hope this success means we have plenty of ongoing support for it!
---
But how do they know you have it?
---
Yes, happens to me a lot, either for the shock stun and for I "magicly knowing that they're near me" (bbq)
---
I agree with farming as long as everyone in the lobby are okay with it.  
---
If even one person isn't up for farming, it's not okay.
---
Maybe they saw you self caring
---
Then don't complain that NOED happens in most games you take part in. I don't rely on my team playing solo for things like NOED because I know people focus too much on gens and with the matchmaking still being a bit weird I know their will be people weaker at dealing with killer and wanting to just get out ASAP.
---
10/10 would bleed out again.
---
Trapper has the third best kill rate. If that means for you that Trapper is strong just because of that state, then I don't know what to say. 
---
The differences aren't huge. Even the lowest killers got over 50% kill rate. And these stats might again include DCs, we don't know.
---
What’s a good keybind set that doesn’t make it feel like your stretching your finger out on? Sorry I’m new to PC Gaming so all of this is brand new. I mean is the default set the best and I just have to get used to it? Even with rotating just practice?
---
The killer waiting in the empty lobby had me crying. I literally only played like 3 killer games and I wanted to do so much more lmao.
---
For me, and possibly other experienced players, there's been nothing to grind for with this Chapter.
---
All of Plague's perks are awful.
---
Care to provide this laundry list?
---
And then, I do feel empowered to talk about something that literally *anyone* can see as being a problem. You just don't want to because (I'm guessing) you're a killer main that's glad you don't have to put up with an OP perk anymore.
---
Marths depip squad also 4 man escaped on Blinky Bill, one of the greatest nurse players ever on DBD. Besides, I was arguing about base Nurse, I didn't mention any addons/offerings
---
As a killer main...
---
...it's still NOED tho /:
---
Why tf do you have to show respect in an online game wth
---
I was gonna feel bad for you because I am a killer main and can sympathize with this then...
---
...Noed...
---
What I got from.this is that your a whiny bitch and anyone who doesn't play like how you want them to play is shitty. Got it.
---
Losing because the other side wasn't good enough to be competitive is stupid.
---
Only use noed against swf with flashlights
---
Slugging is a strategy that does require playing well to do.
---
Very groovy. Yes.
---
Mettle of Man is a great perk, "a little" bs however.  
---
There aren't many survivors that have great perks.  
---
There's Adam - Deliverance, Laurie - DS, and... that's it, pretty much.  
---
None of the DLC survivors have really meta-changing perks.  
---
From what comes to mind, at least.
---
g r o o v y
---
Where is the farm at?
---
I'll argue that for newer players, it's probably usually better to be healthy than in an injured state. After you play for a while it's not so bad, but at the start, being injured is just going to be a detriment to you and the team.
---
You tell em! I bet their pp is shriveled now. Lol.
---
It was not haunted grounds. Might’ve been the shittiest start that killer ever had lol
---
I’m throwing one of these at every blendette I play with
---
I’m getting solid Bs in my journalism program so far so you’re looking a little ridiculous for saying I’m a worthless journalist.
---
It's stupid to play base killers against SWF teams. They bring their best perks and items plus voice communication, so you should also bring your best shit. You are wrong about that match. Blinky Bill got 1 kill and he could got 2 kills if he would find a hook nearby. But he didn't find, so he let Marth88 escape. That was almost a balance match and Blinky Bill didn't use Ebony Mori or range/multiple blinks add-ons. If he would used them, he would won. And that against a team with 4 old DS. Now DS is weaker and useless against Mori.
---
Better than being a Freddie main 👌🏽👌🏽
---
DS is not a problem. DS is *fine* as it is. It's the only perk that I run every game on survivor no matter what. When it was initially nerfed to 3 seconds I was against that, that was pretty useless, but it got buffed back to 5 and now it's a very good perk. It kinda blows my mind that you think it's some wild uniquely shit perk when you don't even run it, and you're just taking other peoples' bitching as gospel.
---
That looms dope. Tho i have to say Legion = DC
---
I was waiting for the escape screen right after cleansing it
---
Borrowed Time always destroys my ass
---
Franklins?
---
Ruin?
---
I'm sorry but I just don't see an excuse to use NOED on anyone but Freddy.
---
I dont have Franklins, have tries ruin many times, but they usually send 1 Guy out while the rest are doing gens
---
I mean you can’t use any perk at all against a mori you just don’t understand what DS is for you had to much time with it how it was previously and that’s how you want it now too but you can’t have a perk with no counter.
---
But those couple of months will be 👌 for him.
---
You should fuck off.
---
I mean yes. I’m a killer main but I can’t blame the survivors for gen rush. Is it annoying? Fuck yes! But is it cheating or griefing? No. There objective is to complete gens. And they do it, stupid fast, but they do it. I can’t blame survs for doing their job, just as survs can’t blame killers for doing their job.
---
When most of the community agrees its balanced you aint gon win anything, youre just gonna stop playing the game, and they said you can do that if you want, so boycotting is useless.
---
1. Waiting out the minute *doesn't counter it* because it gives an opportunity for a teammate to get you up, unless the killer waits around the entire minute, in which case DS just wasted a whole minute of the killer's time on its own.
---
2. You can prevent being slugged by getting in a locker. The killer has no option to put you into dying state from a locker without proccing DS.
---
3. The fact that you don't know either of the above is why I'm not point-by-point rEfUtInG yOuR cLaImS. Because you demonstrably have no idea what you're talking about and you're blatantly just following the echo chamber on a perk that you don't use.
---
True. In my experince NOED sometimes rewards killers but most the time if people are smart it will get them only 1k. Plus a lot of times its cleansed right away or beforehand. Its never been a huge issue for me and I dont even see that many killers really running it. I dislike ruin more than NOED, Itz not OP but its annoying going against it 9 out of 10 games. Id just like to see more variety
---
Best decision - bringing Michael Myers.
---
Worst decision - not giving him a certain cosmetic the entire community wants.
---
You get better items. Often you get green or purple items over the common tool boxes I normally get.
---
I hate you
---
Worth
---
To preface, our goal is the same. We both want a fun game. I'm just saying that's the dev's responsibility. It's not the killer or survivors responsibility. That's the single point I am making. Nothing else.
---
&gt; Well for one, the above dude didn't mention developers at all so idk how you're gleaning that point out of his 'crush players every hope' and 'this isnt a feel-good-everybody-get-along' message. 
---
I just felt it was pretty obvious I guess? If unfun mechanics are not the player's responsibility, as he is saying, then who else's would they be? I could be reaching or putting words in his mouth, but that was how I took it.
---
&gt; I would buy what you're saying if the emblem system weren't very clear and apparent what gets you the most points, and therefore the most success. 4 hooks and 4 deaths is not exceptional or skilled, though most short-sighted killers see this as "success."  
---
The emblem system is clear to people who care enough to read it, understand it, etc. It also doesn't actually stop the behaviors. If you want the behaviors curbed the *in* *game mechanics* need to change such that camping and tunneling are so immediately unrewarding the killer is forced to abandon the strategy (e.g. double gen progression when camping and make it a very in your face UI element declaring that. Terrible probably but you get the point.). It's already a terrible strategy so who cares if you make it worse and more obvious.
---
&gt;  Real success is hooking every survivor 3 times each for the most possible points, with many successful chases, while simultaneously slowing/controlling gen completion. If this is still ambiguous to you then I can't help you. 
---
It's not ambiguous. That's how I play. I even run Thanatophobia often since my goal is usually total mayhem. I'm just not sure what your point is, though. If the game mechanics are underneath some UI elements the player has to search for and learn, then why is anyone surprised killers ignore them?
---
This will get removed. My screen shot showong hatemail for winning did :(
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far

---
Actually you didn't pay attention to the game's lore. As I said before: once a Survivor, always a Survivor. Survivors cannot be turned into Killers.
---
here is the perspective from (denpunk) in video  [https://i.imgur.com/3QyiZqp.png](https://i.imgur.com/3QyiZqp.png)
---
Billy, Wraith and other killers just for fun.
---
I played my first game of Hag yesterday, and 4K'ed even after my Devour Hope was dismantled. I'm definitely going to give her more of my time.
---
It’s just when someone’s dizzy or dazed and their eyes cross isn’t it. It a She btw. Happy cake day!
---
Where did the Peter go
---
*Julie and Susie would like to know your location*
---
The important is that you tried
---
1 guy looking for ruin
---
1 guy your chasing
---
2 guys doing gens
---
You already have alot of pressure, and if they find ruin before the chase is over your either really bad or unlucky
---
It's hard to even pip with thia build really
---
If you know the right loopspots you can loop her for minutes, because she wont be able to throw any hatchets at you thx to invisible walls etc.
---
This is valid too though. They're strong but with the current exhaustion nerf feel a bit much.
---
For the longest time I refused to level up trapper since beta, so until I leveled him up like 2-3 months ago he still had a Release day DBD bloodweb with like 6 items on the level 1 web and brown map offerings,
---
I've been saying the same thing about removing the tiers.
---
Yes which is still high mid tier, which i would also kinda agree with. Shes just not top tier imo.
---
First pic Slashy Ashy should be a killer! He was scary in that episode.
---
I really like playing against her because she is skill dependand and simple without any bullshit.
---
Yup. Pretty much the same if people DC when you use a BPS. Just gotta move on. Nothing else can be done about it.
---
For me personally... standing at the exit just to tbag is just as bad as face camping
---
That's some great copypasta material. Don't mind if I do ;)
---
And ? If i play like 1k hours on her ofc i will be doing great on her overall, just as an example.  Also you can do well with every killer no matter how bad he is. Doesnt mean that a killer cant be worse than others.
---
Okay! Yeah the wording of spine chill is misleading... apparently it does affect exit gates unlocking, too
---
Bruh shit like this is why i stay off new
---
Just ignore them. That's just what you gotta do.
---
I just wanna see the 3 lights go red super quick and the killer be like what
---
Not 100% certain but very very likely yes.
---
This is what I want
---
Tanktop Man-Girdle Ash
---
I don't understand the question.
---
One way to keep playing-close the chat box when the match was terrible or if they were toxic in-game. I think for consoles you can just make it so only friends can message you. Personally for me, the satisfaction of 4 kills with no DCs is better than the amount of toxidity I get.
---
I never said buff her shes perfectly fine.  Maybe stop making assumptions for no reason ?  Also imo Top tier killers should be nerfed and other killers maybe buffed a bit, so they are all pretty balanced.
---
But if the weaker killers get buffed, survivors should get some overall buffs too like not being able to hit through windows and vaults and some other stuff. Killer is already so easy, a 4k is nothing special anymore even at rank 1 lol
---
Coward
---
I'll upvote any Arrested development meme.
---
You guys actually wanna pip? For what, longer waiting times?
---
leave as soon as the game ends for pc or disable messages from people that arent your friend on console
---
Ok. Do we know when the Mid Chapter patch comes out?
---
Nobody likes those kinds of people my man. If you understand it, then trust me, no super model will suck you're dick if you correct someone. (See what I did there? Nobody cares. You shouldn't either)
---
I got accused of wall hacking while playing pig with Amanda's Letter. They weren't wrong, but it wasn't cheating either.
---
Leatherface would like a word with you
---
Yeay maybe I just do that.
---
They haven't said. My guess is next week though. Could potentially be this week.
---
Random totems are fair and balanced.
---
Shirtless huntress
---
You’re always going to encounter toxicity in a game, especially in a asymmetrical pvp game. Just remember for every person you encounter that’s toxic, there’s about another five that feel the same as you do and aren’t toxic.
---
This one game I played recently as a survivor, I was in a chase with a killer til all the gens were repaired. I got downed and hooked once but I eventually escaped. I didn't even get one pip. Feel like I should if I distracted the killer long enough for all 5 gens to be repaired.
---
Uhh okay. I dont really care but getting corrected isnt a bad thing unless the person is being a dick about it which i wasnt. Thats just my opinion tho.
---
Ok
---
sry about my english but I was questioning wich one is the best DLC (downloadable content) in the game except for the nurse's, the doctor's and the hag's.
---
Best DLC Killer?
---
"Gotta love dbd" I'm pretty certain that is just any online game.
---
If it is this week, it will happen on Tuesday or Thursday
---
Yeah, can’t wait for the new Endgame Collapse changes
---
I have not. I haven't been able to play the game in the past three months.
---
Huh?

I believe it goes until Tuesday. That's how it normally cycles

what about the spirit?
---
Best thing I’ve seen all day
---
10/10 would run
---
Killer was lucky that THIS time it wasn't the Hex totem.
---
you can buy her with shards so it's a waste of money imo. but she is fun and can pull of some god tier mind games, so if youre not a poorboi like me she's a good pick too
---
Yes, this happens because there is a minimal amount of pallets that can spawn on the map.
---
So if the RNG spawns a lot of L and T walls or just dead zones that don't have anything to work with, some jungle gyms will have double pallets to make sure that the minimal number of pallets is met.
---
That shits mad broken no lie
---
It's super long getting matches as both killer and survivor! What is going on ... Do you all not want those sweet red gems of blood curency?
---
You ever thought about the fact that rank was so useless (still is) because it was way too easy to get to rank 1 (still is) and that the only way to make it worth something was by making it more difficult? 
---
Now that it‘s more difficult and you cannot reach it again, now that should make you think that maybe you don‘t really belong there and only reached it all the time since it was basically handed to you for free? 
---
It‘s not impossible to get to rank 1. You just don‘t get it for free anymore.
---
Very small slits for eyes. My vision is pretty limited tho
---
Laziest devs I have ever witnessed.  
---
I have never seen another online competitive game in such a bad state with this much players in a daily basis. And you only adressed things which need to be balanced. There are so many bugs and on top of that disconnecting is not getting punished in any way. It's the other way around you get rewarded for disconnecting by keeping your rank and your item + addons. Imagine any other online game not punishing disconnects (lol, rocket league, overwatch, csgo whatever...).   
---
And now that this double bp weekend is over, I won't play until the next patch or dedicated servers go live.
---
Lmao, but which Seth? McFarlane or Green?
---
I think I'll take your suggestion. I'll buy myers, LF and the pig.
---
Graphics on low and resolution on 30% (so my potato computer doesn't lag too much to hit skill checks)
---
Higher rank = longer waiting times.
---
And a lot more DC's
---
You could just say "Fuck Gens" and use Hex: Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, Pop Goes the Weasel or Overcharge, and Discordance or Surveillance or Tinkerer.
---
Loud equals funny
---
Ochido did nothing wrong
---
Y’all can downvote and disagree but that’s the point of the game. Rank doesn’t matter, but if you care about it then you have to play by the devs rules and their focus is on rewarding both sides by making the game more engaging. This game isn’t a moba or FPS where the point is to outperform the other team; the point is to satisfy certain conditions each round. That’s why if someone dc’s everyone loses. 
---
Sorry you hate it, but that’s the game you’re playing. I’m not saying it’s perfect but you all seem to have a hard time grasping the point of the current pip system. It’s always been bad, now it’s just bad in a different way. Levels still don’t matter. People still dc out of rage, and the servers are shit. You’re looking for a complete overhaul of the game, not a change to the ranking system.
---
Someone threw it at P3 Jeff
---
ive been rank 4 for 2 weeks and have escaped 90% of my matches......this game needs help
---
Far better killer. Better perks.
---
Same, my ingame name is BEES? but its almost impossible for people to know that, lmao. only 1 person has caught it
---
I was playing as leatherface earlier and it seems like they are still broke.
---
I got accused of hacking when I was playing a level 1 Legion only using Discordance for always knowing where the survivors were and 4king them with ease.
---
All four survivors always did the same gen, all together and kept running back to the same one. They sprinted everywhere meaning I always had a ton of scratch marks to follow and they would throw pallets down before I even got anywhere near to begin chase.
---
Ps: This wasn't a rank 20 game. It was strange and a very unsatisfactory win.
---
It was one of my few killer games as I only really play Survivor.
---
Don't let the match get to you. Savour the pleasant parts and let the negativity wash off as you get into another game.
---
You don't really remember the negatives after a while if you can focus on the next match :D
---
Double pallets at the jungle gym.
---
Lowly, not lovely.
---
Yeah it's this patch.
---
shit im blind, my bad lol
---
Nah son, gotta save the Sprint Burst
---
Who else do you play?
---
Saw them there too haha, didn’t know I needed it either tbh
---
Same maybe ill actually start playing again lol
---
I like playing Wraith and Doctor.
---
According to this sub, the task you describe is impossible and most likely a glitch in the matrix, please turn yourself in.
---
Jokes aside, it just looks like the new system puts people into their respective places but they complain about not being handed rank 1 for free anymore. In the meantime, streamers are still desperately depipping on purpose to not hit the red ranks (lobby wait is horrendous up there) or even have second accounts. 
---
Good job on your grind btw. It‘s tough on Freddy, always was, but very doable.
---
Pretty sure they haven't said anything about it getting returned :c
---
Beads!?
---
I think securing the offerings is going to happen as a result of dedicated servers. They're supposed to release during the summer (3 year anniversary and Scorching Summer BBQ event likely) so no doubt that there'll be another double bp near or on its release
---
If only Lovely and Quentin went together.
---
Would've been true if we had Quentin looking more like Kyle Gallner.
---
Got enough to get all my killers up to level 40 so I'm good
---
They mentioned it will be rolled out with 2.7.0 patch right? I know dedicated servers is later, but this is supposed to be now because of these issues happening.
---
Then Spirit is probably the better option. They are both fun killers, however Spirit fury works amazing on those two killers. I would recommend the pig if you liked billy and nurse because make your choice works so well with them.
---
This is currently me at rank 2 as killer. Playing non-stop during the event and now I'm mostly waiting for the rank reset to get lobbies faster.
---
Ash is love, Ash is life.
---
Or maybe the system works and puts ppl into their places, meaning if you can‘t reach the red ranks your current skill level simply is the one you are stuck at...that‘s how rank normally works.
---
I was going to buy spirit, but a guy from the other post I made suggested the Pig and I was undecided, so I asked what are people suggestions and everyone rather the spirit.

---
Remember, this has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them.  Don’t let the way their mental health affects them affect you.  Ignore it.  Say something nice to them in return even if it kills you.   Teach them to be better.  
---
I know it sounds corny and easier than it sounds but to kill yourself over a game like this? It just doesn’t add up. 
---
I’m sure you’re doing just fine.  They’re more mad with themselves than at you don’t forget it.
---
Seems about right. Cool cosplay!
---
They said the servers won't come with patch 2.7.0 because they still have more tests they want to conduct. As far as I know they've only tested the infrastructure of the servers so far.
---
The offerings getting lost on disconnect has plagued the game since its release and could only be fixed with the release of dedicated servers. I'm sure they would have implemented it earlier if it was possible.
---
+1
---
I wouldn’t say ds is very useful and deliverance is shit.
---
You actually made my ears bleed, I've never been sound raped this hard before. I'm actually pissed
---
I like your perks background, did you make them yourself?
---
Honestly though, this game is a drug. Kudos to the devs for making a semi-broken game so damn addicting.
---
**Fuck no**, I don’t got that kind of talent. I’ll post a link here for the pack wen I get home. I also had colored perks too.
---
Worst : The creation of Legion, as it showed that the people who've created him had no idea how the game is played/what makes it enjoyable.
---
Best : Belive it or not, cosmetics in the store. It made it so that the game didn't need to shove out DLCs with no thought put into them and the devs could work more on balance/stability.
---
Ah thanks, I'd love to use them
---
2009 memes
---
Well. 
---
The fundamental difference is that I do not believe the game is currently pay-to-win.
---
The only perks you’re really talking about are BBQ and DS. I just don’t understand how these 2 perks cause all this outrage. They’re good perks, but you don’t get any kind of free win by paying for them. 
---
I’d rather there be only a few perks behind a price tag, not all of them. 
---
Most games cost around $60 while DBD is $20. That still leaves a good amount to spend on some DLC. 
---
And I get it. Everyone has different financial situations. 
---
But at the end of the day, this is a real company with real employees earning a living for their families. It’s ridiculous not to expect them to have some kind of money making strategy. You know, like how BBQ has strategically shown up only twice in the Shrine? Because the company needs to sustain itself moving forward. I wouldn’t be surprised if Leatherface DLC is one of their most profitable. 
---
I’m basically saying there has to be a balance as to what can be purchased. 
---
Let’s say all the perks are purchasable:
---
Are they all unlockable? Then why bother to pay for any of them. Just unlock. No sales made.
---
Are they not unlockable? Congrats this game is entirely pay to win!
---
I just don’t know why you think having every perk purchasable is a good idea. Do you not see how it would ruin the balance? Or are you too blinded by your immediate wants and desires that you just can’t see the bigger picture?
---
I like the part where you try to strengthen your argument by pointing out how I haven’t read your writing all while completely forgetting that I was quoting your own words.
---
The entity is after your money and then not? 🤔
---
Weird right?
---
Thanks! We'll get her someday, I hope  ಥ‿ಥ
---
The second ever game I played was against a doctor and the hallucinations actually scared me. The first couple hours of this game where playing survivor was actually scary was.. was like a different game.
---
#2 is usually what does it for me. I usually just stand there and wait for them to stop spinning around like a weirdo, but there are some people who are insanely quick at a good 360 and it always surprises me.
---
The gens are completed *insanely* fast though. Especially without ruin. You can finish a whole gen by yourself while someone is on the hook. And don't forget that so long as they don't enter second state, they will still have to be hooked 2 more times.
---
If you think it's too hard to reach rank 1 right now, you are definitely not a rank 1 player.
---
Straight to hell.  To the boiler room.  All of them.
---
&gt; Depipping with a 4k literally means you didnt play the game the way it  was intended. Hooking 4 people will +1 pip you 100% of the time. There  is no design flaw in this.  He likely lost enough points from face camping or just slugging and someone bled out that he didnt +1 pip. 
---
Slugging is a clearly intended mechanic. It would not have multiple perks on both sides to interface with it if it was not.
---
Also, it's clear from your posts that you have some extreme paraphilia for imaginary rules like "no tunneling." Maybe you actually are rank 1 killer, but:

The amount of screenshots I have of multiple people spawning 3 inches from a Hex totem is too high to count.
---
Yes
---
pls don't mori me
---
I wish they would fix the rank system instead of working on new shit. Give rewards to Rank 5 and higher and fix the 4K Derain BS.
---
VSauce out of context is a meme, he doesn't literally want to die *right now*.
---
That’s funny. Whenever I 4% I walk straight into the loving chainsaw of a Leatherface who still has that bitch revved and ready despite my depressingly low odds of unhooking.
---
Expectation: there will be more rank sparcity and ranks will actually mean something.
---
Reality: There are now 5 less ranks as Rank 5 is the new Rank 1 since it's literally impossible to get past Rank 5 without farming.
---
you're right but the Pip systems still shit.
---
repost.
---
Oooo someone’s a salty survivor
---
Yeah i might do that, problem was i'm a hot garbage billy i'd be better off just chasing and slugging the one farming with me then bothering with the other idiot.
---
*Laughs in No Mither*
---
Oh yeah. I wish the game could stay like that forever, actually. I'll never forget the sound I made the first time I panned the camera around right into a Michael charging his Evil Within.
---
"Slugging is not the intended way to play killer" apparently Deerstalker and Knock Out hurt him personally.
---
Quit match you get points. If they pull their plug you get no points. The game registers the dc different.
---
I didn't know that, that's dumb lol
---
This again....
---
Can someone explain what slugging is? I must be stupid but I really don’t know what it means.
---
Hopefully when dedicated servers are here they get punished for it
---
It doesn't make you stupid!
---
Basically, it's when you leave a downed survivor on the floor instead of hooking them
---
