Yeah, you should add that to his power, instead of his perk. Tbh the perk just sounds infectious fright anyways
---
Never seen it. Probably a glitch
---
Survivors are just skins my ass!
---
Ive gotten 2 flashlight saves so far, i thought i had 3 but turns out someone had DS and it procced as i was blinding the killer, i thought i had gotten one until the killer told me after :(
---
What speed is this guy because he sounds like a better huntress with less range?
---
The only thing I know is that I want David's rod inside my trachea while I shed tears of joy.

I‚Äôm a pig main and this made my day

Having someone else heal you(not accounting for perks/medkits) takes 16 seconds, which might be twice as fast as self care but ties up both survivors for that time so it still results in the same 32 collective seconds not spent on generators.  Realistically there's an extra second or two turning to heal then to get back on a generator resulting in it being effectively slower to not just heal yourself.  That being said, spending 32 seconds(possibly 40) on healing, potentially 2 or 3 times in a match is a lot of potential generator progress and many people don't have their chases last long enough extra from having an extra hit to really justify the time spent healing. Medkits and/or adrenaline is kind of the best of both, fast heals that don't require someone else's time and allow for more generator time.  Even just having the 1 heal from a common medkit can help keep you alive until adrenaline activates, and it makes a pretty big difference.
---
Yeah, I made a masterthread post a little after this one, where I corrected my mistakes.

thanks for the advice! Running around him close up is cheesy, but I like it!

u/PicklePunFun there‚Äôs others who think like us, big brain
---
Try going in and out of a locker. Worked for me. It was one of the only options available
---
I power through the hex because I just assume the other 3 survivors are looking for it.
---
Why? Are you hard of hearing? You're expected to look around for Pig and Ghostface, anyway.
---
PSN- TheArchitect8966 rank 11 highest was 8(almost 7) just looking for a swf
---
I bought spirit during the steam summer sale and as a baby spirit I feel like I‚Äôm just above baby nurse in terms of being able to use my power effectively lol. Feels like I would be better off just being an M1 killer than attempting and failing to use my power.
---
Oh god that's it I'm jumping DbD's ship the second that game hits. Those people know how to party.
---
IT COSTS IRIDESCENT SHARDS :O
---
I want to be part of a slug race :'(
---
Well you get points for everything you did do that match if you don‚Äôt leave but it takes time. I say if you don‚Äôt wanna wait then leave but if you mind waiting then it‚Äôs good news for you and the survivors You get points and they get points.
---
Doesn't Hag have like the smallest killer costume collection relative to how long she's been in the game?
---
I agree with you there. In high rank (Which i am not a part of, but what i see in streams) the killer is dependant more on survivors making mistakes. He still needs to have some skill, but if the survivors play optimally then you need to put alot of focus in your game.
---

---
Im not a good killer nor a good survivor. But when I want to play a relaxing game of DbD then chances are that im going to play as survivor. And not my prefered role as killer. It's simply not as stressfull.
---
So basically, I didn‚Äôt get the option to break the pallet (I have been stuck in a pallet but has allowed me to break it) and I was stuck there. The survivors slid over the pallet which didn‚Äôt free me either. Then a survivor slide over the pallet and I grabbed them which let me escape.  Still got like 32k blood points since I kept hitting them when they slid over the pallet.
---
It was the saw map and I literally followed them down the hole thingy you jump through and was caught in the trap right there. Not even 10 seconds into the game lol
---
I never thought of bloody tools (traps, hatchets, etc.). But now I really want them. I also would love different variations of Hag's traps.
---
They walk and groan pretty loudly and directionally, man. I guess it's relatively a stealth buff, but isn't it kind of insane that there is a giant broadcast? TF2 players learned how to listen for Spies and those are MUCH quieter, and Killer players already listen for Survivors the same way.
---
Plus, Killers are, you know, like 7 feet tall and plainly visible even when they're a cloaked Wraith.
---
Obviously, everyone has latched onto the Terror Radius so hard that now they throw violent fits if they sense any threat to it, but I still think it was a bad idea from the start, and only a few perks really justify it.
---
Lemme pull something out my ass, 105
---
I thought it was ‚Äúlook whose shittin in the tall grass‚Äù
---
Not even all that just play a few games messing around not killing anyone. It's slow but you get bloodpoints, don't depip too far, have fun running a meme build, and don't fuck anyone over. It's a win/win/win.
---
Nurse and Billy have a shrieking blink and a chainsaw, though. Hell, give 'em a loud noise indicator at the end of their movements if it helps; that'd be fair.
---
Get Hag up so you can get ruin, then after that just level up killers who‚Äôs perks you‚Äôd like to have
---
As a Hag main, I am very happy.

Chrome Face is dope to.

---
Survivors count anything as toxic and they‚Äôre really hypocritical about it I mean they insta heal teabag and all that stuff then get mad at you for it.
---
Insidious eliminates the lullabies of freddy and huntress
---
Level up killers based on the perks you want. Theres no reason to level up a killer who you'll never play with perks you dont care about when you could be spending those blood points towards a perk you actually want. Also then when you level up the others killers afterwards, you can get the other killer teachables. If you level them up at the same time all you killers will only have non teachable perks. You'll be flopping around with like bitter murmer and unrelenting
---
Overcharge and Lullaby is fun, Distressing and Unnerving on Pig isn't worth it if you tend to crouch around. I consider those add-ons garbage at the best of times. You can keep Lullaby and Overcharge for some fun, Fire Up and Bamboozle to vault like you're Legion. An add-on combo I like to play with is Rule Set #2 and Amanda's Secret, I find it also improves Pig playstyle since you can't patrol boxes
---
Cave Johnson new killer confirmed.
---
If the killer dcs he was just bad.
---
Cringe.
---
Nah because I get ultra rares on a regular basis due to my plunderers and I recommend always putting it on because if you bring a item in and you give a mechanics toolbox to a rank 20 it helps the team because they don‚Äôt need to worry about losing it because they didn‚Äôt bring it in in the first place.

You should‚Äôve sent him ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt have facecamped‚Äù, considering that his stupid ass decided to throw out the whole game and depip to ruin the fun for you just because you played the main objective of a survivor. Holy shit, I guarantee you his head will explode if he ever goes against a strong, high rank, SWF.
---
"don't shit in the tall grass" when he's hiding pls. (Cause that's what I always understand in the lobby) :&gt;
---
They need to change the protection hits to safe unhooks. Or allow both to count towards it atleast.
---
I know, I feel that already.
---
You go ahead and email them bigshot. Tell them how persecuted you are for being punished because you thought it was a good idea to abuse people over Xbox Live.
---
After witnessing all your entitled meltdowns, and your ignorant view that you should somehow avoid punishment because you happened to send abuse through a different platform, I can honestly say I am glad you were banned.
---
I do wanna use plunderers but I don‚Äôt have it yet so I‚Äôll bring my own items, most killers don‚Äôt run franklins so I‚Äôm good

Tfw survivor main but never had friends to begin with
---
Ive prestiged at least once on more than half of them in only solo queues
---
Lmao, agreed!
---
Ash would definitely have Sprint burst cause in the movies he literally has super human speed.
---
Never played against the new Freddy since I‚Äôm on console I hope he is good since old Freddy was a joke
---
Lol, it took me so long to get the perks I needed back on my Clown. Now I just got Billy to P3 but I also prestiged my Feng and unlike all of my killers, I don't have any other survivor to play on...feels bad man.
---
tbh that's being dumb, not smart. A smart killer will chase the teabagger and 4K them.
---
Imagine a shirtless Myers stalking you üòÇ
---
Get Bubba to whenever you get BBQ, then level the one you want to play until you have BBQ. Congratulations, now you have a BP farmer.

Camping because someone pissed you off is the furthest thing from smart.

You literally gave that survivor what they wanted: a reaction from you. Congratulations, you played yourself. You're not smart.
---
Well just know that if you are doing swf then remember to ask them to gen rush while your doing your chest shenanigans
---
Are you aware of how shit their power is?

Lol, it is...but those cometics

I usually loop the killer while they do gens and sometimes we switch turns. But I could try a plunderer gen rush  build

Personally, I‚Äôm still in favor of the common suggestion that it just do the opposite of what it used to do.  Make it so that if you are hit by an attack which would down you from the healthy state (Exposed and hit by basic attack, Chainsaw hits, Iridescent Hatchet, etc.) you are instead just injured.  Still only works once, keep the aura reveal if fully healed before you are downed, and remove the need to take 3 hits first (since this perk now encourages you to be hit by a killing blow).  Now it‚Äôs not only well balanced (counters certain perks and characters that people bitch about a lot instead of low tier killers and perks) AND still very in line with Ash as a character since he keeps not dying to monsters that insta-gib lesser men, yet he always seems to get knocked around like a ragdoll.
---
I mean, thanks but I'm more referring to this build specifically in regards to pairing things up with the add-ons to make it harder to finish Jigsaw boxes. I know it's not going to be worth anything at high ranks but it's mostly for fun and gimmicks anyway. Your suggestions for normal Pig play is useful though
---
I could say the same about 4 man swf groups. Literally every other game is literally sweaty meta swf groups in red ranks. They in turn make me feel like I can't play anything other than meta killers with meta builds. It's just a vicious sweaty cycle.
---
A dead cell. It's a BW node that failed to have an item generated on it.

---
\-OP
---
Killers are not created equal.
---
Try cleansing.
---
Or, since apparently that option is considered worse than outright using the N-word, try being stealthy. If they never find you, they don't kill you.
---
Also, every killer SHOULD go into the game expecting to lose. 3 survivors can finish 3 gens in the time it takes to hook a single person. The last 2 gens can be done by 2 people while the 3rd player rescues the guy off hook then distracts the killer by looping. The killer can't just "learn to apply pressure better" if the survivors all decide to actually play the game.
---
Only exceptions to that fact are:
---
Nurse because she has map presence and chase power. We all know it, we accept it and move on.
---
Billy because he has map presence and a potential instadown. And the instadown is EASILY countered by just not being out in the open.
---
Spirit because she has map presence and chase power. The chase power is fairly powerful, just abuse collision. The map presence is easily the weakest of the 3 killers without depending on speed addons or maps. (certain maps seriously hurting Billy)
---
Outside of using those 3 killers, you should always expect to lose as killer. A normal game would be about 4 hooks. A good game would be about 6 hooks, maybe a kill. A great game would obviously be 4 kills, but that's just unreasonable without using the top 3 killers.
---
You can tell the camel is a baby killer by the way he took those corners wide af.

It's called the smiling man

Yo I had this happen to me and I clipped it, could you tell me the email?
---
P3 Claudette means Prestige 3 Claudette.
---
The term refers to a type of the playstyle that the Survivor called "Claudette" has. Which is sneaking around the map and never repairing generators. Generally being useless.
---
Claudette has dark skin, allowing her to blend in on 80% of the maps in this game. Her bloody clothing obtained from prestiging her bloodwebs can make her almost invisible depending on map and position.
---
She is arguably one of the best Survivors in the game to play due to her cosmetics, giving her camo options, and all around good teachable perks.
---
Despite it being listed under exploit/griefing in the game itself...? Okay then. Also I won‚Äôt take that bet because I use a different currency
---
Not necessarily, since keys have more uses than the hatch
---
Oh really? That‚Äôs cool, that used to not do that.

Yeah today I used 3 mori' s and all my matches with them where 2 dead on hook 1 mori 1 dc
---
Could you show me a picture of this list? Also if it was an exploit why would they add a perk and not just patch it? An exploit is like infinite tool box or leaving map boundaries and escaping
---
Left Behind should make gens take 1 second to pop
---
Personally after reset I like to tone down on being a killer. I will let a survivor "escape" by making a hard turn through a window I will pretend I didn't see.
---
I will look in the other locker if there are two and I know where they are then wander off.
---
When people help their friends I "miss" attacks.
---
Let the lower ranks actually have fun man.
---
Me when
---
Hmm.. That's true. Maybe it's just my luck to be encountering that kind of survivors.
---
Oh no someone pressed a button repeatedly time to ruin their entire game
---
I'm not sure if it's scummy, but I'm fairly new and still not the greatest with getting great skill checks so when I see it has ruin I usually just tap on and off so as to not get a skill check and still progress at a relatively normal speed

Let‚Äôs be completely honest, if Ash had his chainsaw arm he‚Äôd completely fuck every killer.
---
They should just add survivor quotes but make them survivor side only and not intrusive.
---
It's more accurate to say that killers dont have the advantage against high level survivors the way they do against rank 15s. You can go into red ranks with brown addons and do fine if you play really well and get really sweaty. I recomend just trying to get used to playing without clutch addons by not using them for a bit because it honestly does help. Plus then you can hoard up your purple and red addons for when you want to be toxic and have fun :)
---
*Meg Sprint Bursts away*

You have to bring a flashlight, use a second or two of its durability, and be super aware of each trap. Easier said than done.

Rank reset my friend...
---
Why do you think they are too much? 
---
Also considering the cool down thrilling tremors doesn‚Äôt result in a game helper like it could be. 
---
I chose thrilling tremors to start with only because it was an idea I had in mind for days now and I just wanted to share it. I got plenty more ideas and I‚Äôm gonna share them all don‚Äôt worry :D
---
Also the drill spins and makes noise on this specific outfit
---
Ohh! So it just means I've maxed out Deviousness?
---
Baby nurses are cute
---
I see you got Franklin'd
---
What rank are you?
---
I used to think camping Bubba was just a meme, until I found one who camped me with Insidious, and tunneled etc.
---
Over time I've learned its always good to run Kindred during rank reset as a solo survivor. It doesn't always fix the issue, but it helps.
---
That‚Äôs not me in the video. I know to check my feet and smack the dude. So if it has a counter then it‚Äôs okay? Huh guess everybody should stop complaining about NOED then.
---
Then you come across a killer running Devour Hope and ToTH.
---
This happened to me the first time I ran the addon. Two survivors at the second Gen I checked started teabagging. All four were dead five minutes later.
---
Wtf is the story with this pic
---
Thats actually a good idea, literally havent thought bout that
---
This makes people dc lmao
---
Except I've heard that sarcasm used completely seriously.
---
Nice ad hominem bud. Attack my actual argument, big boy.
---
&gt;greater than the sum of the individual elements
---
Right. Which means that it is true by far, since running DH with NM greatly increases the chances of survival vs running NM without it. And again, WGLF with the bonus. And obviously WGLF doubles BP gain with 4 tokens. Who would have said otherwise? The very concept of that definition requires discussion about David's three perks only, not about having them in combination with perks that are outside of David's personal perks. You're not understanding the definition at all, except perhaps to skew it into your own argument.
---
It‚Äôs swf if they load in together?
---
Here's what I do when playing with killers that don't have great map control. Find 3-4 gens that are relatively close to one another and just patrol them ignoring the others. Bring in over charge, pop goes the weasel, etc perks like that. Another personal favorite is monitor &amp; abuse for sneaking up on survivors. Good luck.
---
Ad hominem doesn't even check out.  I'm a swf main lmao.
---
Mmm points
---
Just did this the other night. Killer was farming for no reason and when we opened a gate he stood by it and slugged us all then kept hitting the wall to let us know to line up. I thought we had convinced him by our silly antics at the gate to do it, but I watched the VOD of his stream and that was his plan all along lol.
---
Thrilling Tremors already has great functionality. It shows which gens are being worked on (shows where survivors are) and blocks gens from being worked on (for just a little bit). That alone is pretty strong.  
---
If I read your proposed changes properly you want it to automatically regress gens by 5% while also continuing regression on all gens effected? Thats a possible 7 gens regressed in just one pickup. The only counter to the perk, as it is, is to get off the gen before a survivor is picked up. That already has a pretty decent drawback to the survivors in that it blocks the gens for a period - and as we all know, in DBD time = bloodpoints.
---
I just feel that with your changes it would go from A-tier to God-tier...
---
When carried by a female killer he should say "gimme some sugar baby"
---
just thought of that, even more reason for immersed survivors to always hide, they can get all their boldness points from Dulls
---
You have an awesome dad!!
---
What others said plus Doctor for monitor &amp; abuse and over charge.
---
And that‚Äôs why I said I get ‚Äúpunished‚Äù for bringing something with me. I understand you play strategically, but you still punish me for bringing in an item to the game. 
---
Which raises my next question: If I get punished for bringing in a flashlight and you counter it by targeting me over someone who doesn‚Äôt carry a flashlight, how do I counter a Mori then? Or super rare offerings? I can‚Äôt. Not unless I become a god at looping and a psychic who predicts all your strikes to 360 them. Even with moris, killers will prioritize the hooked person over the unhooked person. It‚Äôs a loss for me as a survivor. So I feel, while understandable, it‚Äôs not fair for me as survivor. I feel like every survivor, regardless of what they bring with them, should be treated equally. If they‚Äôre toxic, by all means, go all out. But if they use it to help others or to help themselves, why punish them?
---
How common is it to find a teachable perk in another survivors bloodweb. I the perk available for others but I cant find it
---
I meant that as a general thing for everyone reading, not just you, but literally nobody is calling NOED a bully perk. People complain about it because its rewarding killers for letting all the gens get done (rewarding them for losing). NOED is a poorly designed perk, but it's not broken or uncounterable and definitely not something used to "bully." Lol
---
My favorite exit I ever had.. I got out the gate and was just waiting to see if anyone else showed up. 1 by 1 the rest roll in with the killer in tow behind the last guy. We proceeded to teabag our way to the exit in a nice perfect line of 4. I laughed. I'd like to think the killer laughed as well.
---
Holy shit,i'm supposed to face camp with leatherface??
---
I've been doing it wrong evidently.
---
Thanks, i have known i am not alone with mental health family issues. But i didn't know ir was this common.
---
It doesn‚Äôt stop that much survivors from doing gen since it doesn‚Äôt block the gen if they‚Äôre on it. That 5% alone seemed a bit too weak so I decided to go the same as pop goes the weasel. Also it‚Äôs pretty impossible that 7 generators are active on a map, I‚Äôm pretty sure the average is 1/2 or 2/3 if survs are really good. A good adjustment would be reducing the timer to something like 8 seconds then, what do you think?
---
Fun fact, Bruce Campbell used that line in real life and got laid. Not joking.
---
Lol one rank reset after dying on the first hook like 4 times in a row I finally figured it out.
---
Sometimes it's best to not ask
---
He means resilience. Spine chill helps with gen progress a bit when you‚Äôre looked at.
---
N O - C L I P   O U T   O F   R E A L I T Y
---
I mean if you‚Äôre vaulting the killer is probably looking at you already lol
---
Barbecue &amp; Chili, Hex: Ruin, Make Your Choice, Pop Goes The Weasel
---
Hook survivors in the vicinity of generators, so that way you can teleport back after the unhook, getting the jump on the unhooker.
---
What's the point of rank reset and why does everyone hate it?
---
*busts a nut in adrenaline*
---
I‚Äôm pretty consistently in the 7/6/5 range.
---
I do this sometimes when I slaughter the whole team and I feel bad
---
It‚Äôs all luck based. What I like to do is get as many perks on my main survivor until there‚Äôs no more teachables and then get one new survivor teachable at a time until I get it T3 at a time.
---
I think self care becomes useless in SWF or at really high ranks. I usually hover around rank 10 and I tried switching to Bond but it was useless as most survivors would simply not heal me in time. It's a great perk for solo survivors along with lightweight, premonition and deliverance.
---
oh, ok. Thank you &lt;3 I didn't know what it was
---
Doctor for sure, add on BBQ and distressing and you're killing it.
---
It runs pretty well, but the match making times still suck ass
---
Rip solo queue
---
You not wrong
---
As well as this, Freddy needs to say ‚Äòbitch‚Äô whenever he gets stunned. Also, let‚Äôs throw in some lobby voice lines for him too.
---
Yeah pretty much, or maxed out whatever it goes towards, would assume deviousness lol. Imagine if it didn't cap, you could just join a game as hag and do nothing much lay traps, infinite points haha.
---
no, its &lt;50% because the statistic that says 80% is misleading which is concerning Rank 1 survival rate.
---
The stat on whether you died/escaped is taken at the end of the match, assuming 4 survivors were rank 1 and 2 escaped and 2 died, instead of reading that as 50/50 escape/death ratio, due to the 2 who died most likely ranking down to rank 2, it now reads the statistic as 2 rank 1 survivors who escaped and 2 rank 2 survivors who died. Thus skewing the data and claiming more % of rank 1s escape than in reality.
---
I didn't ignore the data, the devs clarified themselves why it was like that, try again and read into it yourself before sounding like a douche.
---
That's why I always say if you dont have borrow time dont even bother to save me
---
Wraith is easy but you will get infuriated when running against strong survivors. I find the trapper to be loads of fun. Doctor is lots of fun but you'll feel like a dick playing as him. If you want to dominate learn Billy.
---
I think the line is  ‚ÄúWe had a pact!!‚Äù, but anything Seinfeld is an automatic upvote.
---
Would make it a way cooler skin too
---
use plunder u get high quality items alot
---
Lol @ the DS, Adrenaline, Dead Hard with a purple flashlight calling a 1 perk Freddy sweaty
---
I thought it may have been the last survivor in both rounds, as neither were hooked. I wasn't sure if DCs would count towards the adept achievements either, so I elected to play it safe and mori. First guy just crawled somewhere I couldn't get to before he bled out.
---
To be fair its my first rank reset for months and its also the first time that im having lots of perks on different charas, i didnt even know all the perks a few months ago xd

Anyone else remember when you could use sprint burst as you were crawling? That would be a slug race game changer. PULL THE NITRO AT THE END!

BOTTOM TEXT

Bubba would attend but he's waiting in the basement
---
If dark magic doesn't like the light why they have fires everywhere, and couldn't we just burn every killer to death if we had enough flashlights?
---
I'll be honest, it's usually the survivors with red ping when they enter the lobby that complain about this. Start checking that over, and you'll probably see the same thing. They have nobody to blame but themselves, in that case.
---
Remake Freddy is really different from OG Freddy. Remake is quite a bit more serious. But if they add some Robert England cosmetics, they could make it like Legion and have voice lines for that specific one.
---
I'm straight and I'd fuck Bruce in a heartbeat.
---
He also teabagged after every pallet drop and window jump, while also pallet blinding. They only got 2 gens done.
---
Because that's what heroes do
---
As it stands now it‚Äôs borderline a completely useless perks in my opinion. DS still has its uses at least, but I don‚Äôt remotely see a reason to run MoM. And I just think it sucks that a characters as cool as Ash hose the equivalent of dog poop when it comes to teachables.
---
Hes just brain dead bro.
---
Can the killer see when you jump through windows going fast and can he be alerted if you just run around fast instead of sneaking? Also how different is each character and who is an all around decent one? I play feng min just cause shes small and easily hidden but maybe shes not the best?
---
p3 characters get way less brown items than an unprestiged character. I don't know who did that "study" but it's obvious to anyone who switches between leveling p3 characters and leveling new characters that there is a noticeable difference
---
Yep, got like 70hrs total and I see it at least once every session
---
Have you seen the price of cosmetics in Identity V? I think not lmao
---
That's crazy, when I just started I usually got gg's. It's rare for me to not
---
I recently started playing again after stopping in January. The game seems to be running better than I remember!
---
Damn I'm sorry, I must have gotten lucky since I have gotten no negative reps
---
when did I say rules and when did I imply more of them? Where am I lying?
---
My sensitivity seems to be high all the time so it often looks like I play with Mnk sometimes but I don‚Äôt
---
They ruined my games today playing surv and killer, suicide on the firt hook is just DC but only getting 1 pipe less.
---
Upvote for telling the truth
---
I‚Äôm a red rank spirit main so I disagree t baggers shouldn‚Äôt get camped because they want attention just ignore them until  last 2 or farm them mate
---
That‚Äôll happen when you first pick a killer up. Some tips;
---
-When stalking (especially from tier 1 to tier 2), try and keep yourself hidden. If you‚Äôre spotted, the survivors will buckle out of there fast.
---
-Contain the Tier 3. This is the most common Myers strat; as you‚Äôre approaching Tier 3, don‚Äôt pop it. Wait until you‚Äôre very close to a survivor and THEN pop it. Tier 3 is valuable, it‚Äôs very powerful and will make survivors extremely cautious about what they do. 
---
-Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each tier. In tier 1, you have a 6 meter terror radius (0 meters if you‚Äôre using the Doctor perk Monitor and Abuse), no red stain (the red light in front of where the killer‚Äôs facing), fairly slow movement speed and an awful lunge. In tier 2, you have a 22 terror radius (I think 22- it‚Äôs around that), a red stainstandard speed and a standard lunge. In tier 3, you have a normal terror radius (32 meters), you keep the red stain, faster vaulting speed, and the longest lunge in the game- and, of course, you‚Äôve got the instadown. 
---
Just a few things off the top of my head.
---
You literally just said that omegablink was trash on console nurse. Now you say it's sad I lost with it? Lol. It was on corn and the frames tanked. That's the only way I lose with omegablink. Stop being salty.
---
It takes away potential points from other players, outside of that I don't know what they would mean.
---
Ironically, I never run any of my Prestige cosmetics since they look bad. But I P3 my three main Killers. Clown is the only one with all perks right now.
---
It is more likely to go up in price than down lol
---
Dont forget t'bagging and pallet looping!
---
I really like the re-work. But I will miss the old Freddy. I feel the "reworked" version could have been a new killer and they could have just buffed/reworked the old one...
---
Not just teabagging - any emotes/actions are toxic! I've been called toxic for saving, taking hits, even healing against certain killers is apparently toxic!
---
What is the orginal meme from?
---
Let's how the mid-chapter patch fixes this.
---
‚ÄúYou think you can turn back time? Answer me!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNo!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúDo you think you can bring the dead back to life?!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNo. I didn‚Äôt fucking think so.‚Äù
---
Should be fun

Not here mate r/dbdlfg

You just gotta be Extra groovy, y'know?

Yeah I did have a hard time to teir up cuz I hooked 2 instantly without stock figuring I could do it later and the upon hooking the DC'd
---
Halloween is finicky. BHVR got the rights to use Michael, Laurie and Haddonfield from Compass International (now called something else), but Zombie‚Äôs Movies was by another company, and 2018 was by Universal- so really, who the hell knows what‚Äôll happen. They could TRY and do Ghost Myers from the original, but I‚Äôm not sure how they‚Äôd get that to work. But then again, it‚Äôs not exactly terrifying to be stalked by a walking bedsheet with glasses.
---
Do they force you to prestige or is it an option?
---
Laurie would likely have any perk that implies she's "fighting" the killer as well as being connected to them. So... decisive strike definitely. Object of obsession. Boil over. And the killer would use Rancor.
---
"3...2...1...ready or not, here I come." 
---
"Found you!"
---
*proceeds to kill bitch on the ceiling*
---
I have at least 10 flashlights on almost every survivor I own (like 9/10 or something). Pretty sure it wouldn't take over 90 to burn them to death since 1 can blind them.
---
It‚Äôs stolen from A Nightmare on Elm Street 4, but;
---
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs this for a wet dream?‚Äù
---
After watching season one of Ash vs Evil Dead these past few days, I am ready.
---
I replied to the wrong notification but those killers are just bad but like there are a lot of survivor rules for killers tho.

I'd be for that, the clown got a santa cosmetics after all. Just throw some blood and some tares and bring bang boom.
---
I dont think they were. I think it was more to show the hypocrisy of his complaining about the hatch...
---
My brother follows that rule set so much, in the book in the end of the video he follows almost all of those so he doesn‚Äôt get called toxic, he doesn‚Äôt go after survivors who got hooked either even if they‚Äôre the only one around and if they get unhooked and he hits them he leaves them, someone knock some sense into him
---
Am I the only one who loved Nightmare 4?
---
"Remember me!"
---
Upvote for accent
---
OH
---
I dont understand what you mean by this in relation to my comment. Before they nerfed it, it gave you a vault boost when the killer was looking at you
---
True, but Michael is known in this game for being one of the few genuinely creepy killers to go up against. As much as I love Ghost Bob Myers, it would kinda take some of that out. I mean if they put it in the game I‚Äôd still use it, so eh.
---
It give you some points. But much less than others would get for healing you. And its slower. Its always best to let others heal you if at all possible.
---
Petition to make this a skin
---
My SWF did this once with a wraith. He used his bing bong to tell us when to go lol.
---
She couldn't blink out?
---
How is the killer "trying to take advantage"?
---
Samanimations would like to know your location
---
1 perk Freddy is sweaty interesting mindset
---
I'm being obtuse? If you look at the other replies, I already answered your question. Instead, you told me I had no idea what I was talking about.
---
So past rank 7, IE, where people know how to play, the scales tip to survivor. I wonder what would happen if you cross referenced that survival rate vs killers. If you exclude nurse and spirit would it be even more extreme. The point being, even data shows a survivor advantage once you know how to play the game, probably up to like 70-80% survival if you look at mid tiers and below.
---
lol.
---
But why list his perks?
---
Holy heck my butthole clenched at that last second. That was awesome.
---
Too sweaty with your tier 1 fire up smh
---
Bruh saw a r/dank memes post calling this guy a reposter, go to his account, and a post on one of my favorite games subreddits. Funnily enough I just played the game today.
---
Hypocrisy of him being salty when he‚Äôs running some of the best perks and a Mori

Also, Freddy's Revenge deserves it's own. As he's quite different from the standard sequel Freddy. Meatier face along with the real flesh claws.
---
750+ hours and still can't properly 360 ^^^^haha
---
Nah we just want the no shirt skin
---
well, its just 2(and a half) Meta perks on a low Tier Killer, but ye, hatch is a fair mechanic after the changes
---
Yeah, what I meant is that‚Äôs probably why they removed that benefit. I wasn‚Äôt aware of that because I only started in February, but I would assume that‚Äôs why they did that.
---
Mad props
---
Mhmm, yeah. Perhaps also Freddy from Dream Warriors- syringe fingers and a ripped open sweater with his chest of souls.
---
It's an option...a really tempting one for me with some prestige killers (Myers, Clown [my main], Trap Daddy, Billy, Leatherface and Doc).
---
Is Whispers a direction thing, or does it just give you the cue when you get in range? I got a nearly maxed out one, and have difficulty finding survivors with it.
---
Finally a conclusion to my love show üòÇ
---
Cheers!
---
Now wait for the season finale finale
---
Good one
---
the issue is those kind of people dont realize that 360 is supposed to be a last resort, crutch tactic, not something that should be your actual plan.
---
well ash doesn‚Äôt kill people, he just kills deadites!
---
My bad for not letting my friend die, sorry for having a high game sense lol.
---
Are you running sprint burst?
---
Your controller mess up
---
Oh gotcha, thought you meant something else, my bad.
---
hehe nice that's my birthday
---
No
---
OOOOOOOOH BABY! THERE‚ÄôS MORE!
---
"Let's get high."
---
"Welcome to prime time bitch"
---
"What's wrong Joey? Feeling tongue tied?"
---
Yes, Tapp Jr. will come to life, the first survivor **and** killer.
---
If you‚Äôre on console, your controller is giving way.
---
Huntress best make me the uncle
---
Well it‚Äôs not something reportable, which really sucks cuz it does seem a little unfair, there‚Äôs not much we can do to ‚Äústop‚Äù it
---
I can't get mad at billy because he's such a sweet boye
---
I just Gen-Tap my way around Ruin most of the time, fuck yo Ruin!
---
They do get punished. They lose possible bloodpoints and usually de-rank if they only get one kill
---
Maybe if they increased the amount of time it takes for each stage it would make camping less efficient.
---
TY :D
---
Im making FUCKEN MAC N CHEESE, A N D N O B O D Y C A N S T O P M E
---
Stable 60 fps as killer?
---
Wheres the p3 claude... oh, right.
---
If there was rank past 1 youd be there
---
I‚Äôm almost there with legion but I don‚Äôt really see the benefits just for blood cosmetics. Maybe I could do it on ghostface or huntress but other than those 2 is there a real purpose?
---
By "hatching" do you mean with a key? Because it is increadably frustrating to be playing and then suddenly everyone just escapes with there being anything you can do. Ruin and BBQ are good perks, but they aren't unfair, although an ebony mori definately is.
---
Exact same thing happened a month ago. 2 survivors thought I was farming, and thus all were moried. At least I finally got the 4 Moris trophy on PS4
---
God I remember being new and sprinting away every time a skill check failed out of fear
---
Happy cake day
---
I found there‚Äôs really no reliable way to do it. Even in purple ranks I‚Äôve found that doing a quick 180 can trick a killer the first time you do it. After that they catch on.
---
I'm a simple man. I see Hollow Knight, I upvote
---
What perk should a beginner prioritize? Right now I'm (L5) using Sloppy Butcher, Shadowborn and I want to add Ruin/Nurse's Calling/BBQ in the future.
---
Ayy what is that cartoon tho?
---
Just depends on what you like. I like certain prestige outfits so I went for them. Other killers that I have got prestiged once for only the weapon and the rest are either not prestiged or are just because I leveled them when I first started playing and ran out of good addons
---
Sadly no, but there aren‚Äôt as many frame rate dips
---
Moomins
---
I do the same thing if I'm just going for my daily

Is this the skin that won the skin contest?
---
as a killer main, idk if i should applaud your cool save, or feel bad for the hag ;(.
---
I have to deal this so much. Instead of trying to get a loop out of the pallet they just drop them when they get even slightly close and this is in purple and red ranks which is just sad. I feel your pain dude
---
Good to know. Thanks for the advice.
---
pro-gamer move
---
I AM TAKING BACK THE HOLY LAND AND NOBODY CAN STOP ME!
---
Honestly I dont know anyone that can consistantly hit every ruin skillcheck all the time. I've got thousands of hours and so do my friends. Its even harder to push through ruin when you dont even know if your team mates are too or will even help you at all. In solo I mean you're at the mercy of the ranking and matchmaking of dbd which makes it only worse. Ruin was far less powerful when r1 had mostly the top players only.
---
Myers should be a little more right and pig should be flipped to anger/greif.
---
Will ash ever make it back to Jacksonville!?
---
When you have a key plus adrenaline and escape anyway
---
Nooot noot!
---
how do we know you didnt bring that, and just get the toolbox out of the chest, and swap?
---
Blessed by the entity
---
I'm laughing too hard at this one
---
Urban evasion literally makes me vomit
---
Haddonfield be like
---
I can understand the fear if you're injured and they seem in 'lunge' distance, but other than that, ugh. About to touch green ranks again, try to dip back into purple, where I was pre-reset. I got pushed all the way back into yellow. cri.
---
well yes some survivors focus way to much onto getting the hatch.
---
Whenever i take a key or get one i think as the hatch being a bonus if i find it by accident
---
i rarely serach it on purpose
---
This game needs more players like you
---
Myers doesn't need help in chases when his lunge range is 3 miles long.
---
Well duhh. It's a totally fair and balanced perk.
---
I mean how likely is it that you'll be downing people that fast that often? BBQ is limited with regards number of uses - at least Thrilling Tremors doesn't have that drawback
---
Fair. Certain killers(My boy Bubba) definitely need a movement buff but some others(wraith) don‚Äôt need that but something completely different. He has the movement potential of Nurse but just isn‚Äôt as good for whatever reason.
---
I don‚Äôt mind Franklin‚Äôs as long as I don‚Äôt get tunneled for bringing an item to the trial lol.
---
Rule #1 with companies; prices never ever go down
---
He's not
---
great skills checks is pretty damn hard ... i'll try to practice it but it's really damn hard
---
Oof I was clown with bamboozle but the Claud still ran me around. I was dumb though and followed in a straight line
---
Only in the first name, who are you to say he isn't...
---
I mean I could give a fuck less about that stupid trophie lmao... 
---
It's just a fun sucker.. waste of a match when you're the first one downed and then tunneled off the hook riveting game play. 
---
I wasnt around for all the old bs.. I've been playing like 10 months and theres so many issues with this game its insane..   
---
Hag is my favorite mori and shes legit the only one I used an ebony on and it was the last time I ever tried to go all out for an ebony it was lack luster and a super unfun way to play the game.
---
‚ÄúGod pallet?  Psssh, your archaic notions of an invisible man in the sky mean NOTHING to me, an ENLIGHTENED INTELLECTUAL!‚Äù- Feng Min
---
Looking away from her made me terrified that you were going to turn back and she was going to be staring at you.
---
Are you for real that's really soon. Where didja hear that? Just downloaded this game days ago and I'm getting really into it.
---
Then slug them all and let them bleed
---
Impressive.
---
Can't tell if you're serious or just meming, but someone won an auction to be put in the game. Dwight is the result of that.
---
They got shown in one of the patch notes, theyre the only skins that havent come out yet from the ones they showed.

I could never be a part of something like this. It's truly hilarious! Who won I wonder... üòÇ
---
Thank you.
---
I know you were joking, pretty sure this whole comment thread is a joke
---
Ah no ok I wasn't joking then it's just a happy coincidence I guess!
---
You could also try Lightweight with that build. Since your scratch marks are missing for 3 seconds, and when the killer does actually find your scratch marks after that 3 seconds, it'll very quickly fade away and be extremely hard to track.
---
U sure they just didn't have shit like boil over? Where they using oaks?
---
Seems cool! Would there be more survivors then usual?
---
You know he will üçªüçª
---
Nope they werent, checked their offerings and perks. They only had one offering with added bloodpoints and nothing else.
---
wow so useful
---
I was once playing a Hag game with Devour Hope on Ormond and the last Survivor was running around the map. I heard the hatch noise and I was like "ooh, gg" but no matter how hard I looked I couldn't find it. Then I pinpointed the source of the hatch noise and realized the dead body of a Tapp I mori'd was blocking it from spawning.
---
I let the guy escape thru the gates but on bhvr fix your game
---
Rank 20 crybaby lul
---
He's gonna do whats called a pro gamer move
---
Decently likely actually. The way it is now, a considerable amount of people you down won't actually proc it. 60 seconds is just too long.
---
One of my "philosophies" for an optimal survivor build is based on the fact that there are killers you more-so need perks to do well against than against other killers. Most of all of course Nurse and Spirit, who have no reliable counterplay. So the idea is to optimize your build completely to play against those killers, since again, you aren't nearly as reliant upon perks against the others.
---
Perks that are particularly good against Nurse and Spirit: Dance With Me, Dead Hard, Lithe, Poised, Spine Chill, Iron Will, Lightweight, Quick &amp; Quiet
---
That's about it. Then there are obviously perks that are generally good, like Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike.
---
Dance With Me, Lithe, Iron Will, Quick &amp; Quiet is an overall viable stealth-juke build with particular effectiveness against Nurse and Spirit, so I like that one.
---
Poised and Lightweight are less consistent choices. Poised is obviously inconsistent due to its dependency on generators popping, which is something you cannot control while in a chase, let alone its timing. But if it does proc in a chase, it can enable you to lose the killer, and particularly so Nurse and Spirit. Lightweight is just pretty lackluster, given how long scratchmarks still stay visible for when using it. It should be buffed to increase the decay rate of scratchmarks a lot more, or at least to suppress footstep noises. Either way, if you do manage to make distance and/or otherwise lose the killer for a brief moment of a handful of seconds, Lightweight can be the difference between them being able to reacquire you or not, which is particularly useful against Nurse, where using distance is your bread and butter. Adrenaline and Sprint Burst pair well with these two.
---
For more general builds, I would always consider bringing Iron Will - not only is it the only way to still be able to consistently do something in a chase against Spirit while injured, as well as helping a lot against Nurse, but with the sounds finally fixed again, it helps you in general chaseplay against just about any killer, preventing them from being able to track you through walls via injured sounds, and obviously enabling general stealth plays. Dead Hard would be the Exhaustion perk of choice, given its strength against Nurse, while still being okay against Spirit, and good against all other killers. Spine Chill is also a good perk to have, telegraphing not only Nurse blinks and Spirit phases, but also telling you about stealthy killers' approach and giving you an early confirmation that a killer is actually committed to coming to you, allowing you to hide or run well in advance and wasting a lot of their time. It also speeds up window and pallet vaults by 6% if the killer is looking at you, though that is pretty negligible, and only really worth it if combined with Resilience - but faster vault speeds offer next to no benefit against Nurse and Spirit, and so Resilience should not be used in a build following this concept (all the less so because Spine Chill and Resilience would combine to decrease Dead Hard's dash distance by 15%, which is actually significant distance lost compared to Spine Chill's sole 6%). For the last slot, take any of the "generally good" perks that I mentioned earlier (Decisive Strike being the prime candidate), or maybe some flavor choice of perk you personally like (Bond, Hope, Small Game, ...). You could even use Lithe or Balanced Landing in this last spot, pairing them up with Dead Hard to have a more versatile toolkit (though now that Lithe procs on every medium and fast vault, I would usually not consider pairing it up with Dead Hard).
---
ahhh shit lmao I thought he was like Indian m8 my bad
---
Well must've been a glitch, cause there's usually a shit fuck ton of hooks. Same with pallets.
---
I've been playing this game for a pretty long time and I've only ever heard 1 and 2. 3 and 4 don't even make sense. 
---
 
---
Why you gotta make stuff up? Did the "survivor rules for killers" joke hit a little too close to home?
---
You know I always find it funny that whenver a game has an issue, the go to of fanboys is always 'hehehe git gud nub hehehehehe'. No constructive answers or possible solutions. Just useless insults from a moron.
---
I hosted one of these competitions recently. Meg was the judge and she decided that Quentin lost.
---
A glitch which occured on two separate games effecting hook spawns? That makes no sense.
---
Yo bro but pallets werent made in Dead by Daylight wtf you saying broüòê pallets were made not dead by deaslihht that make sense not! Help
---
She wanted to make sure she was playing on hard mode.
---
Played Billy like a damn fiddle!
---
Well there's a glitch going around that makes survivors unable to escape through the gate. So I wouldn't doubt it.  That fuckery happened to my friend twice.
---
If I ever get Bubba, I'm going to use insidious to ambush people (guard the basement chest, hide near a totem or generator) but I won't face camp people
---
So what is a "render" anyway? Like is it different than just the character model?
---
2 games. Only 2 games and you complaint? It was just pure bad luck.
---
I wouldn't even care about that, if the problem persist ( I don't think so ) submit a report.
---
I ignore teabaggers, too. Most of the time they'll chase me in an attempt to get me to follow them, and that's 1 less person doing objectives.
---
Don't camp, though, man. I used to have that same mindset and it's not worth it. Toxic players will be toxic, no need to sink to their level :)
---
The point of devotion is to have unlimited player levels. I don‚Äôt believe there is a limit. Th highest I‚Äôve heard of was devotion 6.
---
Where are the teammates like this when I play solo
---
Gone. Reduced to atoms.
---
Not really, im enjoying the game. Alot.
---
Just ignore the teabagging, it usually comes from the Survivors that cry about meta killers getting picked and reking them.
---
Practice, practice and practice and you will be abel to get your revenge.
---
Relax brotha
---
TECHNICALLY, Ash only said Groovy when he got a new hand. But yeah.

Got banned once, put in 3 seperate inquiries about the one ban because no updates in 5 days, claims it was for harassment but i literally hadn't messaged or "harassed" anyone, i bought the clown, wrecked 4 lobbies and in game 5 was disconnected and told i was banned
---
ya ik a lot of ppl love to say it is cause of ping but honestly it is not as killer I should not be shocked I landed a hit. I even sometimes feel bad when I hit someone threw a window when they are clearly running away from it
---
You uncultured swine
---
Impressive, I'd hate you as that hag but impressive
---
Why would i want to become good at that when i could be the backbone of this team and fix the damn gens while theyre all off annoying the killer over and over?
---
the devs have always had stuff glitch like that. there have been perks that are broken once for the killer as well like Tinkerer and also sloppy on wraith and it took forever to be fixed and no one was banned so do not expect ppl to be banned from this as well
---
If you placed a trap near mid-exit gate, you might have had time for a hit and make the trap after your cool down for another hit.
---
Please don't keep going back when you're betrayed, though.
---
To add they also said they want to move the whole friends list sending invites and so on into the game instead of the platforms overlay coming up along with a party system so swf can stay together between matches as well as inviting is more streamlined.

No it's a callback to an earlier episode where the nurse talks about how insanely painful blinking is for her
---
Makes me sad that it seems like most people on PC play at the lowest settings for some competitive edge.  Game looks so much more atmospheric and nice at higher settings but it eats up FPS past medium.
---
How do I know you‚Äôre not a chimp?
---
Um.. in the center...
---
Is anyone else having the game Not Responding when starting a match? It seems to happen at random, and with the number of leavers, I'm guessing I'm not the only one.
---
you would think that with games such as Star Wars battlefront 2 running a solid smooth 60 with amazing graphics that games with pretty potato graphics could do better but companies don‚Äôt care to optimize for console
---
I never get mad when I see a killer I actually get excited I play vs doctors and legions and plague whenever I get a trapper or hag I get super excited cause I don‚Äôt find them a lot of the time
---
Platform: PC
---
Bug type: In game
---
Description: Had an insta-heal add-on for a brown med kit. Without pressing anything other than holding M2, my med kit was consumed and I wasn't healed.
---
This reset is something that's for sure
---
I know but that's not acceptable, these people that are abusing these glitches are the same people that are being toxic and being shitheads. These are the people who are making the game overall just not fun and BH does nothing about it. We shouldn't just take that as a consumer
---
Calm spirit would be a counter to the cry homunculus yes.
---
Some players consider looping an exploit, so from his perspective you just cheated him out of 3 gens, so basically the entire game, and at that point he'd take spiting you and 1 sacrifice over getting cheesed more.
---
I played him with an offering, but it doesn't count unless you have the perks and have suffered long enough with him.
---
That's it. That's the community.
---
That is so unbelievably cool, i love it
---
So adept used to simply be a 4k nothing more and the achievement would pop.
---
Now adept is get a 4k and double pip aka merciless killer add into the fact the changes made some time ago to the rank system as well and adepts are much harder.
---
You have to win lots of chases I Think get like 9 or 10 of 12 hooks. Get the 4k and keep as many of your gens up long as possible. I'm sure someone has got better lists. Check out monto on youtube he does an adept series of videos I think most of the videos were made after the changes might help you out
---
I think if you bring the Predator in he‚Äôs be hunting with no tech. So he wouldn‚Äôt turn invisible. He‚Äôd have some sort of sprint and tackle mechanic, using claws like the hag, and have some sort of thermovision aura deal.
---
I know bro... you wanna know who has even more broken hitboxes?
---
Silverfish in Minecraft those fuckers you swing like 1,000,000 times and miss every time. I mean, it's kind of the other way, but I want to express how much I hate that so... 
---
But yeah, also when I play killer I get no broken hitboxes... so... that's cute...
---
Only when I play survivor do the hitboxes break..
---
Life sucks...
---
The game is fun, but some people are extremely sensitive to the most mundane things. Them teabagging you is about as dumb as it gets. If they're trying that hard to be assholes, they're not worth thinking about. Some people can handle multiplayer games, and some cannot.
---
Didn't they fix the Sprint Burst bug in the PTB though?  they have been doing a pretty good job so far though they've been listening to the community and trying to fix everything that's wrong.
---
\*ducks\*
---
Wraith: Gonna be sneaky
---
Also Wraith: *Rings bell for 4 seconds to uncloak*
---
What‚Äôs their email or how do I message them ? No I have 3 clips
---
Fair point. He needs a buff to shorten that cooldown or give him a greater movement buff after exiting.
---
I‚Äôve only seen like 3 good nurses, excluding the ones who used mor√≠s as a crutch, but they are rare.
---
I've played multiplayer games my whole life, it just feels so mocking and belittling in DBD compared to other games
---
They reverted that change in the ptb. They went to 15 then back to 20 seconds.
---
I dont care if it's fixed in the ptb because the live servers are what matter. Yeah it will get put into the live servers eventually but these are game breaking things that deserve a hot fix asap
---
You need to start watching people who are better than you and learn from them. If it's been a full year and you haven't past rank 14, then you don't have the fundamentals down at all. Getting to rank 10 alone is done through fundamentals. After that, the gameplay becomes more advanced.
---
Watch Monto on YouTube and learn from him. He does both killer and survivor. His survivor gameplay is A1
---
Rank 10 killer, but only rank 15 looking for SWF :) Xbox, LuxTempest
---
Nothing in terms of development, perhaps in a parallel universe, Dbd is published in China by NetEase, or Deathgarden.
---
Usually I try not to camp I might patrol but that‚Äôs only cause either I saw hatch near hook or I saw scratch marks near
---
the part where he has aith and plunderers
---
That trapper is fucking adorable
---
Yea decisive strike is a pretty big fuck you to them and I always run it
---
Some LF players are just like that. Had one recently that attempted this. We just finished the gens while he chilled by the hook the whole time. By the time the person on the hook finally died, the exit gates were about open. The LF only finished with 11k something points. Didn‚Äôt seem like a smart play at all.
---
yea ima go out on a limb here and say that there is no such thing as getting banned THREE times 'wrongfully'
---
ty for source you are a saint
---
I didnt get banned 3 times i put in 3 request tickets about my one ban
---
Are they really though? I barely see anyone use these glitches and if they do they are usually bad players that die fast plus if they hotfix that could lead to more issues instead of using the PTB for testing it. Game development isnt easy they can't just fix anything in a instant and having  a schedule of a chapter every 3 months is kind hard to uphold with also having to bug fix and nerf perks or killers, plus with the new pass system they're working on I imagine they are kinda juggling between everything.
---
i wish everytime a killer ate ds "nice tunnel idiot" would pop up on the screen in big flashy letters
---
It wastes time and robs other players of points.
---
If by some miracle we managed to the Wassup Ghostface in DBD, this is what it could look like getting chased by him.
---
I'm going to play Devil's Advocate here. The fellow survivors who are dumb enough to unhook you when the killer is still nearby should be the ones we turn our anger to. It's not the killer's fault you're bleeding, loud prey (which, by definition, is the weaker and easier target over a fully healthy survivor).
---
I love barbecue as a survivor. It makes it discourages the killer from face camping unless obviously he doesn‚Äôt see anyone.
---
Is waiting for someone to bleed out instead of hooking them so no one gets hatch in the list of things that the killer can‚Äôt do
---
The entity has escaped!!
---
NOED Users: *Slams Table*
---
I honestly don‚Äôt want this perk too become good in the first place it‚Äôs was a bad perk by design and deserves to be dead and forgotten.
---
It's not so much the multiplayer thing, it's how rude, salty, and ***aggressive*** people can be in this game when they want to be an asshole to the opposition.
---
Holy shit. Awesome!
---
the NOED nerf we needed
---
Ran a match as HillBilly (for daily) and they ran 2x Purple Mist offerings and the cornfield map. Pure hell to catch one but when I did BBQ showed no one else and I saw one of them going for the unhook - then ran into a flashlight guy while the third tried to bodyblock. 
---
At that point I ignored the bait (one survivor tries running in hopes I chase) and kept hitting them off the survivor, downing the rescuer and putting him up instead and kept at it. One escaped out the hatch and I left with around 40k in BP and a load of salty messages.
---
Sometimes your only play as killer is to camp. Very rare circumstances but they do exist.
---
Lightborn is amazing but it‚Äôs rather satisfying smacking items out of cocky survivors hands.
---
I feel like broken perks and bugs like this need to be taking spotlight away from the pass and chapter stuff. I much more care about the health of the game than being sent through the roller coaster that is a new chapter. Game development is hard and i get that but thats not a excuse, after all they are the devs and its their job to stay on top of these things.
---
HA! You fools! You expect the devs to give a flying fuck about what the community wants?!?! They think they‚Äôve done *ahem*  
---
‚ÄúA pretty *good job so far*
---
They gave us Ghostface...
---
This trapper is adorable. Samination always delivers!
---
Why is body blocking hooks, looping and pallets looked down upon? Answer me that, it‚Äôs looked down upon from a survivor stand point because you camping  can and  will remove that persons chances of actually playing the game
---
THIS is the shit I like
---
Godly save so close
---
It‚Äôs a [meme](https://me.me/i/luv-tha-dont-make-no-cents-930e54ddb7384e548dfffbcaf0b5b414) , heaux
---
I've lost my patience with dev's and these types of problems honestly. After being a huge fan of Rainbow Six Siege and watching Ubisoft drive that game into the dirt, I have no remorse for dev's who allow these things to happen and these people to continue playing.
---
Yet xbox still manages to make it happen.
---
Darn
---
So they were working together then? As if he tried to pass it offü§£
---
Lol good job
---
I don‚Äôt look down upon it. As i said, legitimate tactics. 
---
Generally i do not face-sit survivors at all but when it‚Äôs a group playing and someone is using OoO i‚Äôm most definitely tunneling that scouting bitch.
---
I want Ashy Slashy voice lines! &gt;:v
---
That would be really cool but potentially very hard to balance.
---
Intellectual reference 
---
^/s
---
Lol he shat himself in that bit
---
150 hours only this isn't all my "main game"
---
Taco Man died for these, you know
---
Yep. I thought the mw2 player base was bad lmao
---
I hate killer mains like you, you ruin the reputation of everyone else, you get so salty over a damn perk. I play both killer and survivor Rank 6 in both. I don‚Äôt see how either side gets so salty over a single perk.
---
Is there any way to counter a face camper? I‚Äôm playing with my friends who are new to the game, and they are ready to quit after just three games because we had a face camper every time. I get that doing gens punishes them, but not really in the short term.
---
I'd really like them to fix his face, he looks a bit..derpy facewise
---
or better yet, give him a skin that replaces his head with a giant puppet head, and gives him a tiny ash puppet for his hand
---
not easy on PC either
---
I agree, their parodies are incredibly well done &lt;3
---
I'm gonna try and play a game like this
---
:(
---
SWF this was but I think trying to make the play to save is what makes this game fun on a bun.
---
Exactly. Far worse than most games. Even in COD it's not this bad, which is saying something.
---
I know! I swear it‚Äôs the same sound just to fuck with people!
---
You're rank 13 now but the rank reset happened recently and there still might be some pro survivors lurking around that level.
---
Wait a bit and you'll get your usual batch of 13 rank survivors. If that doesn't work, derank to your actual skill level and work from there. Practice gradually from your real rank, because playing with good survivors from start doesn't teach you anything but rage. Good luck in the Fog killer :)
---
Bill also coughs while injured, which makes it super easy to track him while injured. Ace? You barely hear anything.
---
You can tell the guy who wrote this comment is a salty survivor who felt targetted x).
---
If  indeed you felt like it was directed toward you, maybe you could think about changing something. Because i wouldn't want to be associated to the cancer showed on this video either.
---
Yes. I've uninstalled on a whim several times because of the disgusting SWF groups. They don't just run circles around you, they taunt you and act like the biggest scum possible, trying to piss you off as much as they possibly can. I'm talking about the cocky ones that run along behind you, teabag, flashlight click, moonwalk at every opportunity. Rescue friends when you've taken one single step away from the hook. Run around in front of you in the open without a care in the world.
---
And when you inevitably 4k them because they were so cocky and confident they could humiliate you? Well then they just tell you to kill yourself in post game, or if you leave before they can, they just spam add you on Steam instead.
---
Anyone who says 'just get over it' or some variant is kidding themselves.
---
What is it with people saying P3 Claudette can Become invisible
---
What is a Moonwalk and how is it a exploit
---
What is Bubba's basement and why does everyone hate it?
---
The new decisive is kinda nuts though. You could not even get tunneled and still manage to get it off if you get in their face in the last 10 seconds. I see it happen in my games and to streamers all the time.
---
I don‚Äôt like that
---
Nope, not a bit
---
This is the most accurate thing i have ever seen!!! I can not tell you how many people do this. I had a guy say i ruined his game because i brought Ruin.
---
Lmfao. Idk why i thought about dad.
---
I'm surprised the devs have done absolutely jack shit to the writhing cesspool that is large sections of their player base.
---
Ace being the most relatable guy on here
---
the thing is that i'm about to give up (after a couple game more)  because this game is really to frustrating for nothing and i can't stand anymore being matchmaked with too good killers players it totally kills the pleasure of playing the game as a beginner survivor i just can't anymore play vs hell extreme try harders on just "even not mid rank" this game is too boring and frustrating the perk system is cool on the paper but feels too "tier listed as ever" 
---
this is just taggin for death with no fun and DC fest and it's understable because the game reached a point on survivor side begginer where even playing is more than half of the time not worth it or enjoyable
---
i'm used to maybe more frustrating games like dark souls or sekiro but this is too much and not rewarding at all 
---
but playing in this meta is just hell and boring and seem too RNG based on will you be one of the first to be found and really there's too much killers at low ranks who have way to much good understanding of the game and it ruins the things when you have one or two even three survivors who barely know what to do 
---
playing most of survivor side honestly it is much common to see begginers / mistakers survivor than killers and it's boring as hell because as said above it just create an excecution fest at those rank that is no more enjoyable or to play against the chance is too low maybe it's the total reverted thing at high rank 
---
but that binary situation (low rank / die fest ; high rank / toyed killer)  just points the poorly, looped and limitated gameplay this game has and it kills me that behaviour games just did so little things on this game in 3 years (on the other hand they are 100% here for cosmetics and making new paid characters it's disgusting ...)
---
When nobody goes on hook all game but you get a bronze benevolent
---
Same bro
---
Yep.
---
They can and often do go far beyond just being toxic during a match too. I get a 4 man SWF who runs along behind me, teabags, flashlight clicks, points all the time. Unhooks their friends when I have only taken one step away from the hook. Runs around in the open in front of me. You know, the type that are just so cocky and toxic that they want to absolutely humiliate you. I persist and they inevitably fuck up, so I get 4k.
---
Then they just proceed to tell me abusive things in post game. And even if I leave post game, they will click on my profile and all 4 of them spam add me on Steam until I block them.
---
As far as I'm concerned behaviour like that should be bannable, I don't care what anyone says.
---
Good point but still bothered me. Anyways it's a pretty good list
---
Wouldn't that just basically be the plague
---
Thx
---
I like the paint drawing on the cat, very nice
---
And you leave one out which is the most well hidden one and still get hit by noed.
---
I guess, but instead of some chick puking on you it's a dude with a bigass baseball bat. plus similar playstyles haven't stopped the devs before. I.E. Leatherface and Hillbilly and rework Freddy.
---
this is sad because there's a solid pretty lovely base in this game but it's ... ruined and clearly not enough enjoyable as it  should be
---
It would get repetitive.
---
Naw fam.
---
How is camping pallets toxic?
---
No idea
---
the main problem is the entertainment on survivor side is too fragile .... and too "switched"
---
That and my frame rate seems to drop at the same time when swinging at survivors causing me to kiss. It‚Äôs my favorite.
---

---
Yes, I agree Freddy isn't that bad, but whenever you chase someone as Freddy you have 3 other people on gens and the person you're chasing is a professional looper that you can't catch. Similar to what someone else has said as you climb up the ranks you find more people who exploit  these weaknesses of Freddy to a whole other level as you climb the ranks
---
Music to my ears. Daddy Bruce never gets old
---
Aren't you complaining about my complaining? Or are killers the only ones allowed to complain now?
---
Well the only reason I can think of is that alot of Wraiths camp and tunnel so when they see that they just nope out or they just have bad internet connection.
---
If it makes him happy and makes game more challenging for him why not, but if it's out of anxiety for bring called bad, toxic etc that is another story...
---
I honestly play as dirty as I can when I can just like they doo...,  this game is me VS you I am here to kill you with hatchets not kindness....
---
Plague felt guilty for her community that she belonged to so thats why I but her there
---
i think it would be kinda cool if he said gravy
---
What offerings are hidden from the killer?
---
We know mori are hidden from survivors so I haven't been able to figure it out
---
Its only fun as a survivor if you are able to outplay and loop killers. But that requires a lot of experience and time.
---
Rarepepe?
---
I hate it as a survivor.
---
Link?
---
Which ones? Please explain
---
Usually the disconnects happen in the loading screen and typically their Ms are solid when I hover over them during the wait. I don't tunnel due to the fact I find it more enjoyable to hook everyone twice atleast. Occasionally I'll slug someone if I know I've hooked them twice and it's still early. I'm too the point where if I'm in a game and the second to last survivor DC's and I've got the last person I'll straight up give them the hatch.
---
The angle of the picture? It sure ain‚Äôt.
---
**NetEase, Inc.** is a Chinese Internet technology company providing online services centered on content, community, communications and commerce.

They are probably the company that's gonna maintain the Dedicated Servers. I don't think BHVR is gonna co-develop DBD with another company any time soon.
---
I love my son. I love my dead gay son.
---
You're never allowed to win anything  in DbD lol
---
I just see them having money to fix these bugs without adding so many more lol. I may be reaching tho but I will stay optimistic.
---
Both of these situations drive me nuts.
---
Ah, Rambo I rice field scene.

Thrilling tremors is pretty good already. It goes so well with the new pop goes the weasel...like its actually REALLY strong. I think we‚Äôll start seeing people drop Ruin for that combo.

---
Well then they‚Äôd just wait outside the gates and tea-bag if they‚Äôre determined to do it. The EGC is there so that you can just wait and eventually they‚Äôll have to leave. There‚Äôs no need to introduce a brand new, probably costly, mechanic because some people can‚Äôt deal with BM when the match is over or can‚Äôt go stand in a corner for &lt;2 minutes until they leave.
---
The hilarious thing is, I can usually tell which survivors have Premonition.
---
I'll see Spine Chill activate for a split second and stop, so I know the killer isn't coming. Meanwhile the Meg next to me is immerse-crouching to some rocks to hide. Anything this happens in the game, I ALWAYS check if they have Premonition, and they usually do.
---
Just trying not to include names

---
Guys I want to be the next noob03 but this game is broken
---
i intentionally disconnected my last game but it was for a good reason. 2 people left on haddonfeild and killer is doctor (so he can find survs easily) and i was on the ground left bleed out so he could find the other survivor. And the other survivor, feng was in the area where i saw the hatch so i dc'ed and she escaped
---
¬´¬†THEY‚ÄôRE ALL GONNA LAUGH AT YOU¬†¬ª
---
Not gonna lie, as a killer main, I'd be impressed. Good Game indeed!
---
Dude I've been paired against a rank 2 survivor SWF as a rank 16 killer.... that sucks.
---
Dedicated servers when?
---
Well yeah, I think every killer should be able to win but also be able to be beaten, the win rate of every killer should be around 50%, but yeah weaker killers need a buff and nurse needs to like stop existing
---
How about "I put bright green text on a plain white background"
---
Yes
---
The way I see it, it doesn't matter how they all get infected, just that they do. Anyone who is decent at M1 killer mind-games will be a God with her if survivors choose to refrain from cleansing. TBH though, Plague only needs a few small changes to make survivors want to cleanse:
---
1. Give survivors the Hindered status whenever they vomit for the duration of the vomiting. This is a small and periodic de-buff to survivors that makes the Plague more of a threat in a chase but not so much that she becomes OP or too oppressive, and it would encourage survivors to cleanse at fountains more.
---
2. Also while a survivor vomits give them a 6m AoE that infects everything within its radius. This allows the sickness to spread throughout the maps less predictably and reduces the workload on the Plague herself. Currently survivors spread the sickness to each other by rescuing an infected survivor, working on a gen with a fully infected survivor or healing a downed infected survivor, otherwise the Plague has to infect them and objects herself all of the time. Adding this will make the sickness spread feel more like a Plague, apply more pressure to the map for her, make the add-on's that increase infection time on objects more noticeable, and help her gain the contagious (25bp) scoring events more often.
---
I feel these small changes would make plague so much better and more balanced without becoming OP.
---
I'd be more lenient if say, the killer was actually around. \[If I remember correctly, it was the Hag.\] But, right at the kick-off, not even a chainsaw revving near her to make her do it in fear. Just 'clunk' right in the shack as we loaded in lmao
---
Not sure what to think of when it comes to punishing survivors for staring but I have this other idea where maybe the survivor gets tricked?
---
Two ways
---
1. The red light smoothly adjusts to the survivor's back and you get hit and you normally get the sprint burst but after the wounded sprint burst is over, you're returned to normal as it was a hallucination
---
2. The REAL killer becomes invisible after being stared at for too long but it leaves a copy with its own AI that runs towards a survivor and pretends to lunge at them and if it hits, the copy will briefly disappear it won't do anything to the survivor but it will mark their location to the real killer.
---
Go go go! &gt;:D
---
Unless you‚Äôre in an organized SWF, cleanse yourself.
---
There's a glitch with maps relating to sprint burst; allows it to be activateable. They are exploiters.
---
Wasn't she a kid?
---
I think it has to do with the mobile port.
---
Somehow I mistake it for generator noises? But when you listen to barrel noises and genny noises side by side they sound nothing alike so I don't how HOW.
---
Looks really nice! It's just that her mouth looks a little derpy, but despite that, really nice!
---
I hope god some sort of totem rework is being done as well as totems already last &lt; 60 seconds once you pass potato ranks.
---
Good idea but I think its a bit complicated.
---
if u test ur  nat type on console u don‚Äôt d pip and u keep your items as well  so there‚Äôs no penalty in doing it so if they don‚Äôt like the killer or the killer ‚Äúcamps‚Äù /‚Äútunnels‚Äù they test nat and disconnect
---
This is actually really disturbing
---
I genuinely can't even tell if this is amazing timing or the pallet just didn't function.
---
I'm new to Reddit ok XD, and I just started getting into the game.
---
Next match: \*Sees Iridescent Hatchet flying through the air towards you\*
---
I thought about that. Idk. Didn't know so many people recommend it.
---
Lol I thought this was from the live action Gakkou Gurashi movie but realized there was only 1 pigtail and no apocalyptic things in the background
---
I think it was timing because spirit fury got triggered.
---
Targetting the flashlight user is a simple counter. If you want to call it "punishing" then cool.
---
If I'm playing killer and you are trying to blind me then of course I'm going to go for you. Not because I want to trigger you as a person, but just for my sake to remove the flashlight from my match.
---
This is a joke post, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that if you have franks mask on (or joeys) and susies or julies skin (the middle part, like the hoodie) they will have the male voice actor, I think the actor is tied to the mask of the killer

Wholesome &lt;3
---
I should hope not. I've also got in atleast a hundred hours on console in the game and this is the first I've even heard of it.
---
Because for that 1 second the generator is in regression, you can still trigger a skill check, but repairing adds no progress.
---
So after it fizzes, continuing to repair for the next second can only be a detriment to your repair progress.
---
I do that, too, and I still do just fine getting kills
---
I thought luck doesn't affect chests?
---
I don't get it.
---
You're supposed to be invincible when you use it, and he used it in time as you can see because he gets exhausted, but he still gets hit.
---
Sadly, you might be right. I don't know how the devs can program a killer AI to accurately chase a survivor and trick them.
---
Wearing headphones is great but all those little noises mess with me too.
---
Do what you want.
---
Here is the official announcement: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68065/bookmark-cosmetic-reveal-mid-chapter-3-0-0
---
yes this also happens to me
---
And I feel like locating the killer is more important than knowing if they are coming your way. A lot of the times when you can't just see him are when you are working on gen, so he is most likely coming your way.
---
And knowing his coming will also be hard to use if you don't know from where, because you may end up getting closer to him while wanting to get away from him.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cdu19c/when_you_finally_get_evil_incarnate/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Wait, it's worth being Survivor now?!
---
never seen this or heard this to happen to anyone
---
Maybeeee, but what if they get perks themselves? Like a warning of some sort. Idk, ur probably right. The third person pov is a core element that could not just be taken away without something to replace it.
---
Yeah except I don‚Äôt use self care.
---
Yip. Blows my mind that they break more and more with every update. I mean, they break stuff they haven't even touched!
---
How come you don't fall into a alternate reality
---
Did you get a spine chill?
---
Isn't Jane screaming for the longest amount of time after hit? She loves it
---
Is that the true escape route from the fog
---
Yup i was also like wtf 
---
I havent played in weeks so this was my first game but still, i have never heard of that happening to someone
---
Premonition already sort of does that with an auditory warning, so it would have to be part of the killers ability that they can like see him through walls within a certain range for it to be manageable. Even then it would probably still result in DC's.
---
this meme format always confused me. imagine being saved by a firefighter and then shouting ‚ÄúI FACECAMP WITH INSIDIOUS BASEMENT LEATHERFACE‚Äù for no reason, and then he just stares at you and yeets the door shut
---
Don't use the fountains please.
---
I am rank 10 and I can't hit great skillchecks coz i've like 20 fps playing this game on my pc
---
When I first did a successful 360 on the killer I felt like a god.
---
Thanks for letting me know ! 
---
He's probably one of those survivors that sandbag their teammates if they deem something they do as toxic like pallet looping.
---
that's also a huge issue with mine
---
As a killer main, just accept your fate. Even if it's four P3 Claudettes, they will not leave until they teabag you at exit gates. Just wait in the center and the endgame collapse will collect them
---
Oh if it‚Äôs not that long just dc
---
sometimes there are survivors that will click the flashlight and teabag to get me to chase them and i just ignore them so they dont get any more attention out of me then they do in real life.
---
Update: happened again
---
Explain yourself. Lmao. You've missed the point of this entire thread.
---
Hag got kerfucked by you OP. Good play and good teammate
---
I've seen lots of complaints about it but it has never happened to me(yet). Wonder what causes it
---
Me sneaking into the kitchen and waking up my dad
---
Their not common but not rare eithet
---
just fucking chase them out jesus christ, you already have EGC what else do you want? just go pout in a corner for 2 minutes or make them leave
---
I dont know, it always happens at the end of the match, the first time i was about to escape through the exit gate and the second one was when the entity got me
---
I wasn‚Äôt bitching about it. I even said I can deal with moris. My complaint was related to the fact that I get punished for bringing items with me. Killers have a way to counter it. I don‚Äôt have a way to counter super rare offerings or Ebony Moris.
---
Maybe play the game a little more before suggesting ideas? Looking at your posts they‚Äôre coming from a good place and have some creative ideas, but don‚Äôt really work in DbD.
---
Best thing for dealing with flashlighters
---
Don‚Äôt worry about the Freddy problems, he is having a rework put through the PTB right now. 
---
I‚Äôve not been able to vs a single Ghost Face since his release (surprisingly only The Legion, The Hillbilly, The Cannibal and The Huntress) so I cant offer many suggestions. Try spinechill and premonition to make locating easier, or other perks that identify killers‚Äô auras like Dark Sense or OoO (only do if good at running from an angry killer)
---
The spirit is pretty hard to counter, but the main thing I can suggest is not to run during her haunting because she can see the marks left behind. Also collision still applies even if she‚Äôs phasing, so you can still bump into her.
---
Idk man if a killer walks by 2 survivors just to keep chasing the person that was unhooked. They're kind of a cunt. Even as a killer I try not to tunnel, it kills the enjoyment.
---
Killer seems to be in the best place it's been since the start. A year or two ago you could have said the Survivors had the advantage but after the exhaustion, healing times, vaulting, pallet, window &amp; various map/loop change the game is much more balanced, even slightly favouring the killer I'd dare say.
---
LOL I've played with people who call me toxic for looping the killer while they sit on gens all game. I have no idea what goes through some people's heads.
---
No I'm not cherrypicking, I am analysing based on their looks and background for scariness or creepiness, not based off their weapons which are scary anyway in isolation when anyone wields them. It is the best way to look at this objectively.
---
Myers and ghostface are still creepy partially because they are generally creepier and partially because they are from literal horror movies - so they have a solid horror story behind them. Horror = scary.
---
Legion is not horrific. A group of teenagers start doing drugs get in a gang and attack random old man. Na that isn't anything abnormally terrifying.
---
Appearance-wise, accounting for the ones that are scary from being licensed from horror films - Legion is just out of place. There is no fear imo, just some trashy chav in a mask.
---
Myers is way creepier than legion and more intimidating, so is the pig.
---
Ive gotten to level 25 in 3 days cause ive done nothing but play this game. I hate the freddy kruger one hes almost impossible to escape and the ones that can be invisible are annoying too.
---
Giving the other survivor a chance to leave by disconnecting=\= a good reason to DC, that‚Äôs still unfair for the killer
---
What about spawning the item back into your hands
---
I really have to stop browsing reddit before I go to bed...
---
Prestiging Ghostface just for the camouflage, guess I‚Äôm a Claud main in a killers world
---
Myers don't give a shit about others looking at him. The snowball is real on him. Also, try to find someone as thicc as him.
---
If you play like a dick expect people to stop playing with you, it's that simple.
---
Slugging isn‚Äôt being a dick
---
Thank you! I seem to get COMPLETELY wrecked on these three specifically haha. It‚Äôs getting annoying.
---
What did you expect from a guy who smiles when the hag performs a mori on him?
---
Yet to find an unbeatable nurse on Console. If y‚Äôall see me in game, feel free to bust out your best and prove me wrongüëåüèª
---
It is, you're preventing the survivor from playing. Why would anyone wait minutes just to either bleed out or get hooked?
---
The issue is never knowing how many totems have been destroyed without playing as a group of 4 or scouring the whole map.  
---
Solo players suffer hard because they will do 2/3 totems and assume the rest are done, but find out later that 1 totem was left standing.
---
No I'm analysing them by appearance to be objective, removing weapons that are always fearful in isolation anyway. What are you even talking about? Rin is creepy as fuck, she is literally a fragmented spirit. Sure if you wanted to analyse their backstory in isolation to see which is scariest, take away all the appearance and weapons. Do what you want. But if you want to analyse who 'looks' scariest then take the weapon from them all and look at their general appearance and background.
---
Everything that makes them legion is a knife apparently? Look dude, you can continue to be a douche as much as you want and force yourself to not see my point. But it is opinion. Legion without a knife is some scummy, nonthreatening chav, who anybody could take, easily.
---
Put a knife in anything's hand and you have something threatening. So you have no point.
---
Tunneling isn't fun for either side. Killers don't really get many points off of them, and the kill isn't as satisfying imo. For the survivors it can utterly destroy the desire to play. Tunneling to me is when a killer singles out one person above everyone else. I had a plague who ran by two other survivors because I was the one who was unhooked. Then camp me and chase me again when I was unhooked. As a killer, should you try to kill everyone? Yeah absolutely. But if you're ignoring all the other survivors just to kill one person, you're tunneling. However if that survivor is toxic, tunnel them, they deserve that shit.
---
The upcoming Archive should fix the daily ritual problems.
---
I‚Äôve fallen for the sound so many times because I like to listen for the slightest sounds (such as a P3 Claudette crouch walking behind a tree to avoid me thinking they‚Äôre all good until I turn around immediately with my 100% sensitivity as my eyes flare red and my chainsaw already warm from the other victims I‚Äôve already sacrificed because she was so immersed and decided to not help and not do any genera- and she dc‚Äôd... well boys looks like there won‚Äôt be any fresh chili tonight.)
---
Amazing. Thanks
---
Being slugged in a 2v1 means that the killer is absolutely going to come back and hook you, just recover and hope your teammate is going to lift you up, or take your loss, it happens, you don‚Äôt win every game. Disconnecting during that situation isn‚Äôt very gamer of you.
---
There‚Äôs not a hard counter to a 2v1, you‚Äôre probably going to lose, take your loss and move on to the next match, DCing just makes it worse for everyone.
---
I‚Äôm experiencing the same issue! Every since I switched from the PTB, Running, doing gens, clapping survivors cheeks sometimes require 2-3 clicks. /: Just Report the bug on the forums or email them and hope they fix it soon.
---
Mad respect for people who suicide on hooks instead of DCing though
---
Camping pallets is a dumb strategy, how is it toxic? You can easily bait them or chase someone else, or use enduring/spirit fury to counter it.
---
99% of infinites are removed now. Chase someone else or wait for bloodlust, or mindgame.
---
Body blocking is a strategy. It literally gives you free hits.
---
Did you bring self-care?
---
Karma
---
If you kill me you are toxic, if I get out it‚Äôs gg
---
NoED is easily countered but rewards bad play. Adrenaline is not counterable but rewards good play. Just kill them all before gen 5 4Head
---
It's a waste of time caused by only one person, DCing only makes it worse for that one person.
---
It makes it worse for the killer because you got outplayed and unfairly gave another survivor the hatch
---
Ya know. All is fine and then they get hooked and just happen to DC. It's so fucking obvious that it makes you wonder why some things can't be diagnosed as what they are in-game and  the person doing it punished accordingly. Oh yeah, but that would probably mean that about one-fourth of survivors would actually quit the game permanently.  It's amazing really. Never have i ever seen so many entitled and just generally awful people playing a game before.
---
Well, they are hills. It should trigger BL when you jump off though. Maybe it's a bug because it works for me.
---
*tries to hit a survivor at point blank range*: auto aim makes you do a 180 and lunge across the map.
---
It sucks for both sides, I wish the devs would do something
---
Ahh George Constantza the character who suddenly became Retarded from rarely loveable in s4
---
Bleghhh
---
Yep. Its so broken. This plus autoaim makes it almost impossible to get hits sometimes.
---
That would make hunting for them more exciting but that would also mean that instead of them having to fix the usual 5 generators it's going to be maybe 10 so that they can't gen rush easily
---
I'd agree with DCs being unfair if DbD was a real competitive game, but with shitty balancing (that allows things like slugging to avoid a fair 1v1 situation) and tons of bugs in it? In a game like that making use of disconnecting is no worse than using the meta.
---
Baby surv here.
---
What the hecc does pip Mean?
---
now i‚Äôm imagining working on a gen whilst some kinda Gargoyle / creepy statue watches over me, nervous that it could suddenly come to life at any moment, and thats actually pretty damn spooky.
---
Blinking being painful was the lore reason BHVR gave for her screeching.
---
As someone that plays Bubba frequently, I'm sorry lol. Every time I play Bubba I play fairly, the most toxic thing I've done was tunnel someone that was teabagging at every pallet he dropped. Playing as a survivor and seeing a Bubba facecamp sucks lol.
---
Reasons to play doct-wait fuck she has calm spirit
---
Love the Trapper stomping the survivors lmao. And I'm 90% certain Huntress is gay but i dunno. She's the most likely out of any of the killers from what I could tell though. Maybe Nea tbh. Entity doesn't really count though
---
Heres what I do if I find a toxic player: just ignore them. They'll want you to chase them around and they usually know exactly where to go to stall you for as long as possible. Leave them, dont chase. Let them be toxic to a wall while you are somewhere else the entire game.
---
Also dont treat every game super seriously, try to have fun. Its ok if you dont kill everyone, its even ok if you kill no one. You'll still get bloodpoints to level up and if you end up with zero kills, it will probably derank you. Deranking is honestly a blessing since it helps you avoid all the toxic tryhards.
---
Just dont take things too seriously, and if theyve opened the gates, dont go there. Theyre just waiting for a final chance to be toxic before they leave. Let them sit there and just wait. Try to find some pallets or something that you might not have broken yet.
---
Who wouldn't lmao.
---
oh killer sure. but definitely more for surv
---
There is no problem here?
---
üëÄ
---
Have not watched twd in a long while but I wouldn't consider negan evil
---
I do to
---
He's not evil, but he is a villain.
---
You haven't been around people a lot have you, fucking up is what most of us do it's a human pastime... a little bit like football or baseball, it just involves another thing we crave "Salt"!
---
Once you have a nice set of man-boobs going you can pull it of!
---
Team no one.
---
you're both toxic, you for saying that fixing gens all game is bad and the other guy for saying you were toxic, can we move on now
---
There's ruin.
---
Me: okay, it's going to take time but we can do it. 
---
Friends: OH MY GOD, IT'S RUIN, WE ARE DEAD, FUCK!!! I can't do gens, going to find the totem.
---
Killers see you roaming.
---
And with huntress song or whatever is called, after a couple of hooks.
---
IM FAILING EVERYTHING BUT AT LEAST ITS NOT RUIN
---
I rarely ever use wards but when I do the killer has franklin's 100%
---
Then it has to be a very very very long stick. Because I am getting ridiculous hits when I am 3 miles away from the window.
---
Why do you people think just because it's annoying it shouldn't exist? Speaking as a survivor main. Dead by daylight in itself is a mind game, so of course both the survivors and the killer will try to play games with each other.
---
Basically this for both sides
---
It's huntress for me
---
The madlad
---
Doing the "I AM THE CENTRIST VOICE OF REASON!" shtick doesn't work when you're going round misinterpreting comments. When did I say it was bad to do gens all game? That's the main objective of DbD right behind running the killer. My complaint was with people who call looping toxic when looping is the reason they're able to do the gens easily.
---
How would a survivor mori an another survivor?
---
I already tried:
---
1. Reinstalling
---
2. verify game chache
---
I think it's just a glitch going on rn, sometimes she sounds like Susie, other times like frank

It's completely random.  You've just been unlucky

Probably not he's a licensed character and so far none have been available with shards the reason I believe this is Ashs isn't and from what we've seen from dbd mobile Pig ain't is either.

I mean I would play but on console it‚Äôs god awful playing with randoms and isn‚Äôt too fun, is it fun to play with randoms on pc or no?
---
How tf are infinites toxic? You should just let the killer down you I suppose?
---
Cool, but what if you moried with a toolbox? You grab a wrench and then you smack the other survivor to death with it
---
Never said I thought it was just saying I can see how it is.
---
I run bond, spine chill and lightweight, with my 4th perk changing depending on my mood and playstyle, and if i have a new teachable i want to try out.
---
Aye just messing around is also an option, I'm giving those ideas for people who don't like playing like that and would rather play "seriously".
---
Your way is imo the best, tho it might not be for everyone.
---
Just harder as all things are on console.
---
Spirit can be hard, especially if they are a good spirit. A lot of the time (if they are good) its mostly missplay from the spirit which decides whether you get hit or not.  Its basically not a whole lot you can do to prevent taking an m1 other than making it harder for the spirit to read your movement like making fake scratch marks, back tracking where you came from, avoiding walking through grass etc.
---
Don‚Äôt do drugs kid, do suicide instead!
---
Thank you! I‚Äôve mostly been leveling up Nea, so I hadn‚Äôt thought about that.
---
Susue!! Like it!! Just because of the Susie cosplay
---
Thank you! She‚Äôs just so fast it‚Äôs ridiculous haha
---
There‚Äôs auto aim, that‚Äôs the problem
---
Spin the left stick in a circle, hold the right stick in the direction opposite, (if you spin the left stick to the left, then hold the right stick to the right while you spin) and have your sensitivity around 85.  It‚Äôs a consistent 360 every single time.  It won‚Äôt consistently avoid a hit, that‚Äôs on you, but it‚Äôs a consistent 360.
---
Ok what you need bound for?
---
How can survivor mains think the game is unfair?
---
Approved.
---
Those people who get downed for the first time and disconnect.. Why? Just why?
---
Saying *never* to cleanse against her is as stupid as cleansing immediately and frequently. The smartest thing to do is pay attention to the match itself and adjust accordingly. 
---
Early game and most of the pallets are still up? Fuck it, I can stay infected. Late game and we're running out of options? I'll run to a fountain in a generator dead zone and force her to go out of her way to pick up the buff.
---
Basically, the key to Plague is being *judicious* in fountain usage.

BHVR what the fuck are you doing? Can the bigger playerbases not be prioritized? Seriously?

I'm sorry...I have to say it. It should be purchasable with iridescent shards because it is so bloody ugly, it's an absolute crime to have to pay for that with actual money. Not the mask though..it looks good. But the rest of it...I'm ready for my downvotes.

Well if you ever want to play DM me!
---
Can't forget we have the monochrome maniac which has the same colors besides the chromish looking cape like thingies(forgot what they're called)  makes me think the mask was supposed to be with the monochrome maniac as it looks kinda the same and has the word chrome in it.
---
Nah, you fuck with 4 other people's time, you know damn well what you're doing. Now they have a week to realize that online multiplayer games expect you to actually stick around and play them.
---
If you're DC'ing enough to catch a ban, you're leaving *way* the hell more than because of the occasional hacker or fucked latency.
---
I've P3'd my Feng on PC and PS4 and don't even use the cosmetics. Kitty skirt and Christmas sweater for the win.
---
If you play solo it's an amazing perk
---
There was a post in the DBD forum, in a wishlist thread, about doing this with cursed dolls (Anabelle, the Saw puppet, Chucky, etc etc), so the killer would be a devilish incorporeal being that would teleport around the map ocuppying these vessels (the dolls). 
---
Sounds cool, but it also sound like it would require a lot of money in a matter of licenses (this dolls example).
---
In that time, the only stuff that happened was one gen popped and ruin was dismantle. That was it.
---
Like a reverse Ghostface? Sounds really interesting actually, and would change looping since people use camera to it‚Äôs full potential to look around and behind them
---
*chuckles in no mither*
---
Well you can fuck over some survivors or work on gens with them but without proof yourself it‚Äôs kind of troll perk
---
This^
---
Facecamping is disgusting but if I have multiple survivors hooked, of course I'll patrol them, but I almost never down someone directly off a hook until they get healed unless they used an instaheal or did some toxic shit
---
Remembers devours on 5th stack
---
Well it depends whether you are NA or EU, cus of ping xD
---
Nah normally they'll leave right before the timer goes
---
I think it‚Äôs a lit totem until I round the corner and it‚Äôs a flaming barrel, then as I walk by it whispers ‚Äúpsss don‚Äôt you wanna rub me to‚Äù
---
Yeah it's not as much of a problem on PC as on PS4 (I play on both) but it still happens. The way I see it is you're never going to get better at the game if you dodge hard shit. It's like survivors who see it's Nurse and DC instantly. But I do think it's worse for killer because, like you said, preparation can be a big part of it at times.
---
We call those people ‚Äúwhiny babies‚Äù
---
Oh yeah!  the C.i.t.c.p.o.s.c.c.c.c.c. I heard of those guys.
---
i hate clown with a passion, but i love your art so üëçüëç
---
I cannot wait till we get that update that locks people from playing for disconnecting over and over. I‚Äôm sick of baby-brain people DC‚Äôing cause they don‚Äôt get their way. Pathetic piss babies, all intentional DC‚Äôs are.
---
So are they removing mori spamming then? Really don't want to be punished for dcing against that.
---
What about Trapper?
---
If a mechanic needs a perk to counter it, it's badly balanced. It's absolutely unreasonable to run counters for killer tactics as it's pure chance wether or not it'll be used against you.
---
Also, did you just unironically recommend No Mither?
---
Virgin Huntress vs Chad "**E X T R A  T H I C C"** Clown
---
That's a "Fuck" moment lmao
---
Bring plunderers instead of self care its like a 35% chance or sth to loot a medkit with 3 chests and when you do loot the medkit you get so much more from it and heal so much faster, as well as being able to loot toolboxes, flashlights and keys if you don't need to be healed
---
That‚Äôs Up The Ante you‚Äôre thinking of. AITH is supposed to affect chests.

Also gives more incentive to go for totems and slow down gens
---
There's no chat on consoles?
---
This happens to me like once or twice a day anymore my man, I have no idea what's causing it.
---
Yesterday it happened when I went to nab someone off a gen, I grabbed them an it all ended lol
---
just happened, a doctoress leaved me bleeding to die, it killed everyone, camping one, then dawning everyone, rip us
---
On Steam, Riderz. Also jeez people got salty haha, classic DbD community. But also my LF is p3 so I havent used the Claudette mask in months, but it could be a old screenshot im not sure

Same brother
---
No, it wasn‚Äôt you.
---
I do it when I see there's a needless struggle cause of 3 other players doing nothing helpful while I've been chased for a while plus downed.
---
When all of that releases
---
I agree I always get killer challenges but now I‚Äôve started playing killer more I seem get more survivor so I think the game is bullying me :)
---
Billy then goes on to Mori them all
---
End game collapse mate
---
Looks like a DC to me.
---
Have been in a lot matches lately where i see the killer taking a swing at someone and bam i'm kicked to the result screen.
---
Hasn't happened to me as a killer so far.
---
Nicely done!
---
Imma be honest, I only normally dc if the connection is shitty. Now you can downvote me into oblivion.
---
Really, there buffing points for totems, that‚Äôs stupid I already have to delete with teammates going round the map not doing objectives
---
1. when did I ever say that wasnt bm? 
---
2. Killers goal is to be in the early game and win, survivors goal is to win and get to the late game so thats why they run adrenaline.
---
Entity aged her up because you need to be 18+ to join The Hookers.
---
Could have cropped it out too without cutting any of the other text.
---
I would imagine this has to do with the mobile version
---
I know this is stupid, but would you consider redoing it with her giving a thumbs up?
---
I was a Meg main when I started playing, and after I had a bunch of stuff built up I prestiged her and lost everything. Now I rarely play her, so that wasn‚Äôt worth it.
---
I‚Äôm a David main now, and I have all the perks unlocked on him, but I‚Äôm not bothering to prestige him. I‚Äôve poured far too many bloodpoints into him at this point. And I always run him shirtless anyway...
---
Bro why couldn‚Äôt you just make the text regular

so, does that G in GoW mean God or Gears?
---
I love original posts, don t you?
---
Me too bud haha. I take them on anyway and break out the instasaw Billy lol. Sadly I'm terrble as nurse otherwise it wouldn't be so bad
---
I remember when I first started playing and everything was so scary. I‚Äôd hide in a corner and the killer would walk right by me. I felt like a legend.
---
That kid looks like a survivor main JenDenise fanboy.
---
Doesn't spirit fury still force the stun timer though?
---
Oh man thats mean lmao
---
What's worse is people who attempt escape hook then don't struggle at all. Like you could've bought us some time but sadly this is a game changer....
---
Thanks my Guy
---
I knkw the ranked system but I didn't know it was called pips
---
You can't waste pallets if you dont know where they are *taps head*
---
People can make excuses, they all boil down to they got mad and rage quit. We‚Äôve all done it at some point. The problem is those who dc more than they finish a match.
---
I think i read somewhere that these fire barrels actually have sound files from other actions used in them.
---
Good on ya.  Anytime I stay for a last minute rescue, the hooked person will let me run 90% of the way to them and then they give up or DC...
---
Console though...  Am I right...
---
I saw someone's concept for him. They had him able to possess people and make them walk themselves to the hook. Also a pretty neat concept of having him able to hide in lockers, chests and Good Guy boxes on the map.
---
When Ghostface exposes someone he should yell WAZZZZZZZZUUUUPPPP
---
Made with mematic
---
How can I play the beta? Its not available in my location
---
Had a swf yesterday who used one person to get in a chase then when the other found the hatch they dc'd so he could take the escape.
---
I mean, I would be okay with this rework. Not like DbD could have any more issues with toxicity.
---
Dude, I just run it. I played Myers and used that plus the low TR to thwack people and make them lose the item
---
I'm a killer main and I literally don't know why people do it at all. Or all the people I face do it completely wrong. It never works.
---
Every damn time.
---
Pussy
---
I have made it work just a couple times on low rank killers. As a killer it's sometimes fun to just stop and see the survivor become a fidget spinner.
---
**Absolute Legend.**
---
Speaking of which, Carrie would be a cool killer concept
---
&gt;Are you?
---
 Yes I am. You keep bringing up knife and are just trying to be a douchebag.
---
&gt;Of course Myers and GF would have an advantage because they already have movies
---
Yeah it is what it is. Deal with it. Non licensed killers get a scarier edge / advantage on the other ones because we automatically relate them to horror scenes and stories. IT is like the clown being a creepier version of a common phobia.
---
&gt; I'd also say judging the characters without weapons is also pretty unfair 
---
I don't really care what you think mate, it is the most objective way to judge their appearance and background. 
---
I think you are taking my opinion on what is and isn't scary 'once you take away their weapon' way too seriously and are trying way too hard to 'win' this, when it is an opinion.
---
Sure ghostface and legion are similar. But Ghostface is from a horror film, and legion just isn't scary. That's how he gets the creepy / scary vibe. Legion doesn't have this.
---
&gt;Comparing, Legion isn't what you said. 
---
I didn't say legion did, I said that is exactly the common situations we see in every day lives, and these kids aren;t scary. It is what they are generally based off of even if they don't include it in the background. It doesn't matter who it is, teenagers running around in groups stabbing people is cowardly.
---
Haha you reaally think teenagers form knife gangs and steal, vandalize and bully without drugs involved.. Ofcourse they wouldn't put that in the substory though. That is just realism whether it applies to legion or not. 
---
&gt;Legion isn't scary for the same way as the others.
---
I see what point you are trying to make, but this is still not fitting with the rest of the characters. 'OOooh anybody can kill', no shit. But give me a horror chracter with a reason to be scared. Not just that they have a knife and a mask.
---
&gt;They were meant to be scary in a group.
---
Another massive design flaw of the character. It just isn't scary full stop, particularly running around survivor style on their own.
---
&gt;judging on appearance
---
Yes this is the whole conversation you have entered into..
---
I would be more concerned with seeing the Pig, than something I see every day, a group of hoodies hanging out on a street corner.
---
The plague is distinctly and abnormally creepy, same as the wraith, same as the hag. Some are more scary than others. As you say Myers, GF, and probably the huntress are bottom of the pile for normality and not being visually scary or creepy. But they all have aspects that meet the mark rather than just 'a mask and a knife'.
---
And if you thought you would be catching a disease or the plague then it would be quite unnerving.. Plague is a little worse than just being gross.
---
I really want this mask for ghostface... Like... Really want it. Maybe all other Scary Movie variants too
---
Those people need to disconnect permanently and uninstall.
---
I think stake out is better than both
---
had no bleed out Timer left
---
Sometimes clothes vary or only 2-3 flashlights but its pretty close. Rarely matching names but I see that from time to time.
---
Whatever you say, u/ExceedinglyGayRoach.
---
I end it fast. I don't want to farm, I want to have fun.
---
And queue times on PS4 can be really bad. It‚Äôs so frustrating to queue for a game, wait fifteen minutes, get dodged, queue and wait again, then get dodged again. Even worse if you‚Äôre in a SWF group. Killers are free to dodge if they really want but last second switches are the inevitable response to it.
---
&gt; it really is uncounterable
---
The usual counter is to rush gens while Bubba hovers around his first basement hook, since mobility is his real weakness. That said, if "Bubba's Basement" is combined with a local 3-gen then it's GG and brace for the salt.
---
Most killers have a basement-centric setup, the strongest will involve an instadown/instagrab (such as Make Your Choice for the former, Trapper's traps for the latter) for snowballing when people come to rescue.
---
Without the 3-gen you need to be very careful that survivors don't simply outmanoeuvre you and pop gens. Nothing sadder than a Basement Bubba with a single kill because the rest of the survivors did a gen rush rather than going for the bait.
---
Im just gonna copy paste this to every swf team that has a guy dc. Maybe, just maybe i can make them see the error in their ways
---
Literally just played killer and thought there was a survivor sneaking about but it was just a fire barrel crackling.
---
it's not auto-aim per se, it's just fucked hit-registration
---
Can confirm, got a lucky drift on a guy that tbagged me instead of running and he immediately dcd. What a dumbass
---
Stop it. They are definitely doing something but they are just not doing anything right as you looked at them or something. Stop it. Get some help. Dont dc cunt
---
I just rewatched the remake of Texas Chainsaw, the one with Jessica Biel and I noticed a few things. Bubba carrying the dude down to the basement on his shoulder, just like in game. Bubba hooking the guy, just like in game. I hadn't thought about the run animation, pretty cool if it's the same as movie Laurie.
---
Stake Out is a completly different type of perk. It gives you no extra info about killer's location.
---
Pretty much the same, but I don't blatantly farm. If they get a DC in the early in the match, then I usually just hook the rest survivors twice and let them escape. 3v1 games suck for both sides and I feel bad killing anyone in these, but I still want to play the game normally and at least get some chases.
---
To be honest, it's a fair question. Perhaps I can understand the downvotes but the comments... by God, the comments. What in the world is this community?
---
I'm actually hyped for the stranger things killer.
---
Hope they dont fuck it up.
---
Well when you consider the competition for that slot they are quite weak medkits and toolboxes will almost always get you more value than a flashlight.
---
I‚Äôd be shocked if this hasn‚Äôt been suggested before, but it‚Äôd be great. 
---
We just got a chapter release without a survivor. Maybe we can get a chapter with TWO survivors.
---
It‚Äôd be fitting too, DBD contains COLLEGE KIDS and hillbillies.
---
I will 100% down the survivor that got farmed, but not hook him. I will go after the asshat excuse for a living shitbag of aids and stick a chainsaw up their ass, after which they most likely dc. Good times!
---
I‚Äôm tryna get downvoted
---
You sir, are a hero
---
You‚Äôre an asshole
---
yea exactly
---
Well, I didn't say the looping part was toxic, just the extended use of emotes and teabagging against a new rank 18 trapper who just tries to learn the game. I get it, you're super duper good, that's why you are at rank 15, you are honestly one of the best surv of the world, going full sweat with DH, SC and a flash against ppl who just learn the game (tbf he didnt know  that before the match started but still, take the free win and leave , don't play yourself up to be the best of the world)
---
Wraith, Doctor, and Clown are pretty easy to get to grips with - Clown has better perks, if you're looking at the long game.
---
All the rest have some kind of gimmick that comes with a penalty, and if you can't make the gimmick work then you're going to have an added layer of difficulty.
---
That said, I'd really encourage you to get Bubba just for access to BBQ &amp; Chilli's significant BP buff (barely appears on the Shrine). **If you get into the higher ranks then you're also likely going to be compelled to abandon the "easy to learn" killers due to the difficulty of handling high-end survivors.**
---
skal du ikke sige tillykke üò¢
---
Even when the match making work and i'm facing all rank 14, i noticed MASSIVE skill level difference between survivors. Some people literally haven't reached the point where they can look behind themselves to dodge my hatchet. While some others are above my skill level lol
---
Yea I 360 the killer like 3 times in a single chase. I went down once because of his traps.
---
I‚Äôd assume that they bring a key because they know they‚Äôre not very good in the first place, rather than the key making them play worse. Like an insurance policy when you have no confidence in your ability to get out the gates.
---
I'm not talking about removing moris. I'm talking about the spamming and cancelling the mori animation. But ebony moris are really op tho. You're telling survivors to compromise after a year of nerfs in every patch lmao?
---
Brand new parts have been nerfed several times to the point where they are not even good anymore. And flashlight have so many counters now with the pick up animation being sped up since last autumn. Insta heals are bullshit I agree and am surprised they are still in the game.
---
I know I‚Äôm just gonna get called an entitled survivor main but just hear me out.
---
If a survivor does something that is considered toxic like tbags or clicks a FL, that literally does nothing but hurt the survivor. If a killer tunnels or camps that mean the survivor literally can‚Äôt play and makes it nowhere as bad as something as little as crouching up and down or pressing a button over and over again.
---
I will always disconnect against a doctor. 
---
Yes, I know he's a lower tier killer but he. Is. Not. Fun. To. Play. Against.
---
I can deal with Ghost Face, I can deal with Legion, I can deal with Spirit and Nurse. But there is nothing fun about Doctor.
---
That's probably the best rework of left behind i've seen so far.
---
Then please don't play if you're in a bad mood. You're just making the game crap for everyone else just because you had a bad start
---
Thanks :D
---
Well, killers shouldn't use WI-FI when using an ethernet cable is way more stable and less likely to go from 120 to 200 out of nowhere
---
meme police here.
---
the irony of this template is in fact not the proper/correct/decent decision but an obvious silly one that is not supposed to be proper in the slightest. 
---
by using this template this way you're actually making fun of people who decide not to stay in the gate to t-bag. 
---
if you wanted to make fun of this situation and use the template correctly the title should have been something like: 
---
when you immerse whole game while your team does all the job and they escape through gates while you stay there to bm the killer.
---
\*Homer picture\*
---
everyone is stupid except me
---
fixed your meme, good day. remember to use templates right, kids. memes are our cultural genes.
---
Legion is perfectly fine though. People end up playing them wrong.
---
that WAS very cash money of you
---
No, both as survivors.
---
But based on the movie I guess you could make Tucker an accidental killer.
---
Every single blendette ever
---
Yesterday I was in a game as Hillbilly for a ritual. I‚Äôm not very good at him and I don‚Äôt really know when is and isn‚Äôt a good time to chainsaw but I chased this one meg around for ages while she wasted all the pallets and I was trying to chainsaw her for my ritual
---
A perfect Frank!
---
How do you know they aren't yellow items? I understand dodging keys and full toolbox squad, but 2 medkits too?
---
This is why instaheals need to be nerfed, any kind of other medkit gets punished because of these bs addons.
---
Not quite my dude. I do, however, disconnect when I get downed due to bugs/lag, go against a 3 blink nurse, iri head huntress or similar or get farmed &amp; tunneled. I also disconnect as killer when the survivors are just trying to farm.
---
Mix it with break down so they can't just insta-hook you again.
---
Our family planned to eat out thay day. I started a game and right when we finished first gen we had to go. Thats the only time i disconnected so far
---
She not really thicc at all, She just has really revealing clothes
---
Feng main; I always think theyre the wrath decloaking for like half a second
---
And people say tbaging and FL clicking is toxic. At least the killer can play the game when survivors do those little things. What the fuck are you spose to do there.
---
Instas need to be gutted there to fucking strong and have no negatives I used to not dodge med kits but now if I see 2-4 med kits I‚Äôm not taking any chances
---
so you're saying with them we'll have the "griefing" rule removed? cause otherwise the rp is impossible.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm just happy as it is from both sides I don‚Äôt think anything‚Äôs game crippling
---
The game literally has a required ranking system. The ranking system is built into the matchmaking rewards of every single match. I might agree the game isnt competitive, but that's only because people like you choose to stump for the overpowered role as opposed to realizing that the game should be better balanced for a competitive environment.
---
The pigs cosmetics (at least on mobile) are purchasable with shards
---
Ash didn't have a killer
---
I love that last second of panic we can hear. It‚Äôs nice üòÅ
---
Just because something is uncommon doesn't mean its not broken.
---
Now why‚Äôd you have to go and use sound reasoning and facts like that?
---
Happens just about every game i play right now. Started for me sometime after Ghostface was added.
---
No when u had a chase for over 2 mins and not a single gen popped, it's safe to say they aren't doing anything, especially if you're hooked and either see them urban evading around on the other side of the map or running around aimlessly.
---
Wtf is the end game timer? Havent played in a while
---
I wanna see them both in the game as well
---
Im new to the game and also do the unhook right after the killer left. The only problem is that he killer was just gonna destroy the gen 3 feet away from the hook and just so he can camp the survivor till death
---
Im curious, how long does it take for you to get into a match?
---
Could probably put one of them in, and then the angry college kid with his hatchet as a killer. Wouldn‚Äôt be a very good killer though, he has no real abilities other than being an angry college kid.
---
So does that mean if you double pip every game that you won't rank up ever while still gaining bloodpoints?
---
Then in post game chat 
---
*ez 3 gens*
---
But what did it cost?
---
AKA Legion?
---
Make Danny Devito the killer in his own chapter to balance the scales after releasing Tucker and Dale as survivors.
---
I've had really low ping going into the game and as soon as a game starts it begins lagging like hell.
---
Maybe killers with shitty internet should stop the lobby if the pings they see are too different.
---
Lets just all hope dedicated servers come soon, then people who dc are/should be banned.
---
Is anyone thinking this is serious?
---
hit through pallets more than once = DC
---
Everything, cause all 4 were sacrificed
---
Myers is a better all around killer. Ghostface is more fun to me. But fun is subjective.
---
Nurse is the best but she's hard to learn, you will get lot of salt, and most pro nurse say she gets so easy it gets boring eventually.
---
Spirit is well designed and strong but she's hard to learn.
---
Billy is a good choice. Strong and easier to learn. His issue is he is much weaker in some maps.
---
Yeah, I'm having that, too. Maybe not 90% of the time. Though I'm not using Bond, so  maybe I'm just not seeing it some od the survivors.
---
Here's something overpowered for you, since we want to fuss about it:  killers can kill survivors, survivors can't kill killers.  GASP. /s
---
But i was finishing a gen and the killer was almost there, so i ended the last gen with this box
---
I disagree for ruins. I think it remains a must have. You may get unlucky and it gets found early, but if it stays alive for a little while its really strong.
---
I brought up the knife once.
---
I won't argue about the licensed characters point because fair enough.
---
How did you determine this "objective" way to judge their appearance and background? If you're going to be using objective, I'm hoping you have good reasons behind it. What decided that was the absolute best way?
---
&gt; Legion is not horrific. A group of teenagers start doing drugs get in a gang and attack random old man. Na that isn't anything abnormally terrifying.
---
Also, you in fact did say that Legion took drugs and attacked a random old man. This was in direct relation to Legion. You start by saying Legion isn't horrific. It is not a stretch to assume that "doing drugs and attacking a random old man" is directly what you thought their lore was. If you claimed this was common then maybe, but I don't see that anywhere in there. Where was this so called "I said that is exactly the common situations we see"? This was you just not knowing their lore, which is kind of bad if you're judging based on background.
---
I won't make an argument about the "anybody can kill" and the "massive design flaw" though I will agree Legion working solo is bad for fitting them in gameplay, but we're not judging based on that are we?
---
&gt; I would be more concerned with seeing the Pig, than something I see every day, a group of hoodies hanging out on a street corner.
---
You're also forgetting the fact they're wearing masks too. A group of four staring me down with masks would be more concerning to me than if Pig did. Ambushed? I'd be more scared of Legion again. This is also assuming without weapons. A pig mask is something I'm far too comfortable with though for my own liking.
---
&gt; if you thought you would be catching a disease or the plague then it would be quite unnerving.. Plague is a little worse than just being gross.
---
Unnerving, yes. Scary? No. That wouldn't be scary. That'd be worry. Stress, even. I wouldn't have fear over catching a disease like I would have fear over getting murdered by Myers or Trapper, or literally anybody. If anything should I see Plague, I'd think they're some crazy and sick person. Both mentally and physically, to be exact. Call them an ambulance because they very clearly need one and keep an eye from a distance. The most creepy factor is how much the plague fucked up their body, which would translate pretty quickly to empathy for me.
---
Here‚Äôs to more to come
---
Just run at her when you hear it  ü§£üëå
---
Nah. Ruin is still meta. Even if it's found pretty early it still creates time for the killer in the early game wheb it's most important.
---
While there are other good perks, none come close to the importance of early game time generation.
---
Then you gotta hide for another minute behind a rock after dodging a bullet or two.
---
I see I found men of culture as well.
---
UsElEsS tEaMmAtEs right? You‚Äôre the problem dude, not them.
---
Killers when they camp and tunnel people with insidious leather face:
---
Killers when a survivor crouches once in their general direction: [real shit?](https://youtu.be/fKum4JmG-ew)
---
Meanwhile all the gens are done. Following a pallet-dropper isn't a good tactic at all, especially in the begining of a match.
---
I like to think of myself as more of a symptom.
---
&gt; I'm currently in a lobby as a killer. No matter what, a 4th person seems to be impossible to find whenever they don't join almost instantly. I've had 3 people constantly in the lobby and whenever one leaves it doesn't take too long for a new to get in, except the fourth.
---
I noticed same issue as both survivor and killer. seems to be a bug they need to fix.
---
&gt; Another thing with survive with friends, I constantly have to create a new lobby to play with friends again. I've heard it's because of the code, but this game is 3 years old.
---
Yea its ridiculous, really annoying.
---
&gt; Not to talk about disconnects, broken ranked system(it's not rare to see people with over 500 hours in the game and I've just started playing)
---
That is because devs insist to reset ranks every months even thought we all think its dumb.
---
I‚Äôll only do it if it‚Äôs major lag. Or possible lag switcher/ hacker.  Other than that. I‚Äôm happy to just take my bloodpoints and play the game out.
---
Why is it problematic that I don't live so that they can urban evade some more? They can continue their urban evading not doing gens just fine without me.
---
Pair Unbreakable with Tenacity and you‚Äôre basically reaching Entity levels of power
---
That‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt get. 4 Instaheal Medkits, 4 oddbulb flashlights or 4 brand new parts honestly don‚Äôt change the game all that much.
---
One mori completely changes the way the game is played
---
nurse is my bitch. she's by far the weakest killer. i'm on PS4, and every nurse sucks. its a garanteed good game if i'm survivor
---
That bottom artwork is cute as hell &lt;3
---
Play the game?
---
The amount of times I‚Äôve been camped literally 20+ times in a row.  Deleted the game.  Come
---
Back several months later.  First game.  Camped. Deleted again.
---
Bruh
---
nurse is by far the worst.
---
spirit is very easy. all you do is spirit walk to a generator.
---
yep to what you said about billy though
---
It's been a problem for a long time and prevents some people (me included) from ranking up. It appears when you need one last pip to rank up and apart from changing the displayed language they didn't fix shit. Sorry mate I feel you
---
They can do their thing just fine without me, while I'll suicide and go into a new game where we hopefully can get a gen done in the five first minutes. Everyone wins, I get a better game and the urban evading ones continue as usual.
---
If it‚Äôs 4 P3 claudettes I don‚Äôt feel bad for tunnelling.  I can‚Äôt tell which of you is which.  You accepted your fate the moment you hit ready.
---
I will bitch about heat,  
---
I will bitch about cold,  
---
I will bitch about sunshine  
---
and about growing old.
---
I will bitch about everything  
---
inside and out.  
---
You'll find that there is nothing  
---
I can't bitch about!
---
cannabal should always be your first choice in order to unlock BBQ perk. plus he's sooooooo easy. every game i use him in, it would be a masacre if not for the fact that i always let evryone live for more fun
---
Imagine farming your teammate right after he got hooked and then call the killer a camper. 200 IQ
---
unless ur a console player cuz they suck ass
---
somebody had to say the truth at one point, reality is often disapointing
---
Nurse and Spirit are the best. 
---
Billy and Huntress are the flashiest, you can do a lot of cool shit with them but theyre considerably weaker than Nurse &amp; Spirit. 
---
Hag is also all around really strong.
---
I just played a game yesterday. I was rank 18 and my team were rank 20s. The killer was rank 15(i think) and I got 2 gens done while he brutally murdered everyone else like it was nothing. I ran up to him crouch dancing and he let me get the hatch because I was the only one who was actually trying to win.
---
Wot? They can outrun you XD
---
Old habits die hard
---
Apparently David should have worn the brown pants
---
Where‚Äôs my balanced landing gamers at
---
Should have been hillbilly with tinkerer
---
I can think of something for almost everyone. I dont see why not.
---
Yeah I get that, which is why it‚Äôs annoying when a killer insists on making the game unfun for one player. I don‚Äôt want to just loop a killer all game every game. Idc about getting  hatch, killers tunneling feels exactly like survivors following you and constantly clicking a flashlight
---
Except with the killer, you can‚Äôt just ignore them
---
Ppl keep saying console nurse is bad and stuff but it‚Äôs a lot easier than it used to be and I ran into very good ones
---
If you unhook someone and run to another direction, I'll have to follow 1 of 2 scratchmarks paths, if it leads to the injured, then I guess you better have DS, because I won't turn around and just accept my fate, stay with injured people you bunch of dumbass
---
Not really if the killer doesn‚Äôt slug they are both pretty bad I just like them lol
---
Honestly it‚Äôs the same as killers nodding and smacking the hook when you get hooked
---
idk, when they get a team of potatoes and die to a mori ghey go to reddit to write about how everything that killer used is op and for killer is when they try and use any killer but hillbilly or nurse
---
Fair
---
My legit build is BL, Windows, Plunders and Ace in the hole, I farmed so many keys that it pays itself
---
Are there any stats on items appearing in blood webs? I see streamers carry med kits rather than use self care and I can only think it must take FOREVER to get all those med kits.
---
Holy shit
---
I'd say just get some cells and buy the raining blood cosmetic,those floating thingies give you away more than your body tbh
---
Ok, and? Are you new to the game or something, this isn‚Äôt a rare sight
---
It also helps a ton if they feel greedy and walk off to hit someone nearby, or decide to hook the person they downed beside you first, you have the chance to nyoom to safety.
---
in my first match with a mori on ghostface i moried a p3 bill that was super toxic
---
What are general tips vs clown? He runs fast and you can't loop him. I heard you have to drop pallets early vs him but doesn't that mean end game is a ton of dead zones?
---
Hold you can just stand up and run. We‚Äôve got a cheater over here!
---
There‚Äôs a difference between blendettes and Claudette‚Äôs. I‚Äôve seen some pretty damn good Claudette‚Äôs but I have yet to see a good blendette
---
We did it boys, noed is no more
---
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve never done it. You get points, why would I quit?
---
Shoot as the killer I'll ready up for every match no matter when the loadout looks like. Not every match is supposed to be a cake walk.
---
Check out PainReliever on YouTube.
---
We're not Blendette's btw. All Claudette's are dumbasses. &lt;3
---
1, I'm not "stumping" anything.
---
2, What "rewards"?
---
*dedicated servers would like to know your location*
---
Ye, everyone in the realms is over 21.
---
Had two teammates instantly dc because of that. Not a bad strategy.
---
They need to increase DC bonus. 625 is stupid low. If everyone quits you only get 1900 BP that is trash.
---
I am called hacker every time I shock stun with doc, I think I have like, 50 reports in using hacks
---
Ive seen pallet camping survivors at rank 1
---
Is teabagging toxic? I use it in a friendly way?  I just teabag for a second and go, or if the killer is giving me hatch I teabag for a second and go through.
---
A B S O L U T E L Y  O U T P L A Y E D
---
Nope, I was spectating some random who was hiding in the locker. The killer knew they were hiding there and stood in front of it. It was just an up-close in-the-moment view of her that I captured, lol.
---
That's also really annoying but at least some points get around.
---
As killer it really makes me scratch my head sometime. One recent match I finally found a Dwight for the first time after 3 gens were done. I downed him and then he just DC'd. No clue why.
---
i have so many questions. so many questions .. but holy shit all of you are bad af
---
When you lose a pip its called depipping. "I got depipped!"
---
Aw, back in the day when the lobby had atmosphere and was just O R A N G E
---
As killer, I hate this. I often start farming when I trashed a potato team with little to no gens done because it feels like bullying babies
---
They said it on one of the first dev streams.
---
bbq works, though tinkerer and/or discordance also Would work in this scenario
---
Gf camping is a really bad strategy, the only ones that fall for it are the ones that fall for insidious camping
---
Why they have auto aim in a game where the on thing to harm players with is melee I will never know. It is quite shitty and needs to go.
---
The 3 survivor lobby bug  has been a thing for over a year maybe two. Don't get your hopes up any time soon
---
If you just want perks Hag and Cannibal are great grabs. Honestly, though, they're not very fun, and in the latter's case, not very good either. If you want a fun or meta killer than you can't really go wrong with the Spirit, Myers, Ghostface, or Legion. They all have one or two nice perks and they're fun to play. Although I'd just save up your shards and buy Spirit and Legion that way instead of with real money.
---
well, it's rank 16 after all
---
Dark character and blood makes her darker, very hard to see especially on maps like MacMillan.
---
Ordinarily, moonwalking is a slightly more advanced form of killer mindgame to bait the survivor with your red again by going the other way. However for a while it was also used to refer to an old Legion exploit that has now been patched.
---
Leatherface (Bubba) is the best killer in the basement due to his ability to insta down multiple survivors at once, which combos extremely well in a room with only one way in and one way out. It's frustrating to deal with, and Leatherfaces have a tendency to use Insidious, hide still in a corner of the basement, and wait for survivors to come to them.
---
I didn‚Äôt know he was gonna come back. He sure went a distance so i went for the hook. He just destroyed the gen from the other side and came back to the hook. I know he is a camper because 1 mate almost died because of it. Me and someone else wanted to rescue him badly(keep in mind we are new players) so one took a hit so the other could unhook then i took a hit so we could escape. Later he got that dude and hooked him. I was near that hook so i waited for him to go away. And you know what happened then
---
Wait what?
---
Jeff
---
Honestly Meg with a Pony and red shirt would have been a better zoey
---
I think it‚Äôs partially wishful thinking. 
---
If someone is working there, it means you found a survivor.
---
Yeeee. These games take forever to load. I ain‚Äôt gonna sit in a game for shit bp just cuz I feel bad. If they are efficient I usually let them escape but if they are dumb af I‚Äôm killing their ass and moving on
---
What??
---
I‚Äôm finding it really hard to get into this game on PS4. It takes forever to find a match with a survivor and killer and I can‚Äôt count how many times people disco or killers camp hooks. My friend says it because of my rank but that‚Äôs a problem, this game is very unfriendly to new players. I will continue to play but man, it‚Äôs almost a chore to play it.
---
That‚Äôs a real dc haha
---
No one can escape skill !!
---
I think it would be funny if shaggy had some sort of unmask ability that revealed the Killer for x amount of time called "Old man Jenkins?!"
---
Cute
---
What an ass glitch üßê
---
I saw someone yesterday who DCed when he was the last survivor as he was getting downed. Like why not wait a minute and get the bloodpoints?
---
yeah sometimes but only when I feel like it
---
As someone who mostly plays killer (I like to play survivor too fairly regularly), I don‚Äôt follow them stupid ‚Äúsurvivor rules‚Äù. If you‚Äôre in my line of sight and are the most important survivor at that specific moment, then I‚Äôm going after you :)
---
This makes no sense. Yes, gens get completed because no hooks stop them from doing so, but by the time the first round of gens pop, most places are deadzones, making chases significantly easier.
---
Been having this happen in a couple of games. Just the usual bugs I guess
---
It sounded like you unhooked your teammate right away. I guess I misunderstood what you were saying. My bad.
---
Tf is the point of this
---
I don't play anymore, so.. okay. Banning literally everyone would end up getting pissed and BHVR would get so much bad flak, but I only spent like 20 dollars, so oh well.
---
I‚Äôm just trying to get downvoted
---
Depends on the situation I'd say. It's the ones who teabag behind a pallet as if they've outplayed the killer, or at the exit gate then they're completely safe that I'd say are toxic. They tend to also be the ones who DC when you down them
---
I dunno, I find Hag pretty fun.  And she is essentially higher tier against a team with no flashlights.  With that said, I would also still go with Spirit.  Decent perks and huge mind game potential.
---
My name
---
Make sure you‚Äôve brought insta heal or self care
---
When can we expect the mobile version to come out? And will it be easier to gain Blood Points without Leatherface being available or are his perks possible to use on mobile?
---
I'm looking forward to play DBD on the go, but having to farm back my progress is gonna be a pain.
---
Kind of like the ability with Laurie? There could be a fun interaction where the scooby-doo killer has some perk that has one of your teammates have a fake heartbeat. 
---
So x becomes the obsession and while they are around other players the heartbeat sound goes off.
---
Jigsaw, Distressing, Unnerving. Annoying as hell.
---
Lol what world are you living in?  Nurse is her own tier by almost all accounts.  On PC at least.  She is the hardest to get good with though.
---
Yeah, because if you think Huntress' hatchets get a flight adjustment, keep prayin' pal!
---
My DbD experience today, like many days: queued as killer, took me 10 minutes to find a lobby, the game crashed on load; queued as killer, took me 10 minutes to find a lobby, the lobby has the 3-person bug; requeued as killer, took me 15 minutes to find a lobby, the lobby has the 3-person bug; currently requeuing as killer, 5 minutes in, wish me luck. - Nevermind, got a lobby while I was typing this post: someone else has crashed on load, I am stuck on the loading screen with the bar unmoving.
---
They actually did seemingly fix the 3-person lobby bug for a while, or made it an a lot more rare occurrence anyway, but it's been back longer than it was fixed for, now, and obviously it had been a thing for a solid year or so before that. Just like so many other bugs, this one will probably be ever-reoccurring.
---
The reason is simply that they are not very good at their job. What other reason could there be?
---
Tunneling is chasing a survivor for an extended period of time and that survivor only. I'm also fairly new to the game and people are so extremely salty how a killer plays, but will be toxic themselves. Play how you want to play for the time being.    
---
While people dislike tunneling, it's also not a very good tactic. Other survivors can work on generators for free if you tunnel one person. The other thing people will baby about is ''facecamping'' which means staying close to  a hooked survivor so it's difficult for the others to save him.    
---
It's unreal how people genuinely expect killers to play a certain style. If people are greedy for hook rescues, I'll stay around.    
---
Have fun.
---
Huntress is a really interesting interesting and cool killer to play, and is one of the most balanced ones since there is the juking possibility on her hatchets and its hitboxes are a 50/50 it will or not hit a survivir on a corner, etc. Here are some tips:
---
*Use the perk Barbecue &amp; Chilli if you have it to try and snipe survivors on generators. It feels really satisfying when you get those map-across snipes. Perks like Surveillance and Discordance also help getting the snipes.
---
*Wait for the Juke - survivors will try to juke your hatchets. Wait for the juke and then throw.
---
*Fully charge your hatchets - When you hear that *Ding* sound when charging up a hatchet, it means it's fully charged. It goes WAY faster than a simple throw, giving less reaction time for the survivor.
---
*Low rank survivors - In low ranks (14-20) survivors tend to drop pallets really early. Use that to your advantage! While they are animation locked dropping a pallet or vaulting both windows and pallets throw a hatchet on them.
---
*Get to the high ground - You can use places like mountains and the second story buildings in open maps to find survivors in the open and potentially get a snipe.
---
*Basement play - Huntress has a crazy  basement potential (almost equal to Bubba). Block the stairs and fill their mouths with 'em hatchets.
---
*RELOAD - Hatchets are your Ace. They are powerful and you need to have them at all times, even if it means you need to break chase. Without hatchets you are basically a tall Hag with no traps. The perk Iron Maiden helps by cutting by half the reloading process and Add-Ons can help increase the max capacity of Hatchets
---
*Play survivor as well - By knowing your enemy, you can get to them and kill it faster and more efficiently.
---
*Don't be afraid to break the rules sometimes - It's better to get rant than getting called a Baby Killer. Survivors use their rules to prevent killers from being toxic at THEIR point of view. Use those Irredescent Heads if you want to, or NOED if you are struggling, but...
---
*NOED doesn't work with Hatchets - and I believe the *Exposed* status effect neither.
---
*Map pressure - Huntress has a slower movement speed than killers like Trapper, lacking of Map Pressure. Perks like Sloppy Butcher, Hex: Ruin and slugging in the right times can help you.
---
*Loops - Debri loops (not jungle gyms) are buggy, so practicing the right angle is mandatory to throw hatchets at the survivors.
---
*Watch guides - there is a 19 minute guide on YouTube about how to play Huntress, and it's great.
---
These are some tips I give you to be a better Huntress player, but try not to camp. Huntress is an agressive Killer (power helps mostly in chase), so you will only get better if you chase survivors. Watch good Huntress players play her and etc. But don't forget to keep practicing her.
---
Good Luck on your games  ; )
---
Wheres my man coach
---
Spirit‚Äôs line is funny
---
what a huge nerf
---
I hate ragequiters but if you get completely face campers on your first hook I can understand that you would rather play a normal match then hang there for 5 minutes waiting to die
---
Ruin is still the only effective slow for gens if it sticks around a bit.  Pop Goes the Weasel is much more effective now but requires you to hook people so it's not that useful if you're having a shitty match.
---
Wouldn't fit the live-action theme very well, unless you want to copy the live action shaggy, but even then, not sure if it would blend with the game's style. Also licensing. Would be neat tho
---
ok
---
Am I the only person in this entire Community that really doesn't want them to add this mask? I'd prefer being able to take the killers at least somewhat serious.
---
Speaking of **Boil Down** it needs to be buffed! ;P
---
If in flames it's really good for survivors and shouldn't be cleansed
---
&gt; When can we expect the mobile version to come out?
---
[Probably Winter 2019](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D77W0S2WsAEkudU.jpg:large)
---
Tunneling is where you focus only on one player to completely eliminate them from the game, which may be frustrating to the survivor and also unfun. 
---
People sometimes say it unnecessarily, like when someone gets unhooked and you immediately down them again because it was a poor rescue attempt. 
---
It isn‚Äôt the best thing to do because if you‚Äôre only focusing on one survivor the other three are doing gens, cleansing totems and whatever.
---
You also have camping, where you hook someone and stay by them until they‚Äôre dead. Also inefficient and frustrating.
---
I‚Äôm not that good when playing survivor. Same as you. But my chases are getting better and better. You have to learn how to 360. Learn various types of jukes. Learn how to help others like using a flashlight to free them from the killer‚Äôs grasp or hookblocking to give them enough time to escape. Bodyblocking to take a hit and learn where the vaults and pallets are. And hopefully you‚Äôll improve.
---
At least he wasn‚Äôt a baby Dwight
---
How did you manage to butcher the title...
---
If you're getting hit early get better. Practice better positioning and wait for the killer to patrol first gen if necessary. Quitting that early in the game majorly screws your team over.
---
I don't record my stuff at all but if you want my discord it's MOTOL#7463 all caps
---
I like where you're going with this but feel it could be better... Scratch marks are kinda irrelevant with EGC. Seems like a waste of a perk slot as you're banking on your team wiping early and that you'd be the last left. I feel it doesn't do enough to justify it's existence...
---
But the game is already over so nobody needs pallets ^_^ It depends on map too. If you just follow a pallet dropper on Blood Lodge or Mount Ormond you're gonna loose.
---
their perks will center around the other survivors killing themselves.
---
this didn't happen on the early days with shadowborn
---
I too want to know the history of thus picture
---
We have nea
---
Only time I‚Äôve quit was when I was the last person left and downed. The spirit just kept walking me with her sword and I still had 2/3rds of the bar. I‚Äôm not sitting through that shit.
---
if you're downing multiple people in that quick succession I don't think you'd need that added benefit. you're already ahead at that stage- why do you need to absolutely steamroll the opposition üòä
---
If there'd ever be a two survivor DLC, then I want it to be Cindy and Brenda! &gt;:C
---
Your brother must be the nicest person on earth. Now tell him he is an idiot and start 4k'ing :D   
---
Nah, really if he likes to play like that, so be it. If he fears private messages he should disable them from the settings (doesn't matter what platform). On PC he can just instantly quit before salty comments.
---
I mean, technically, all the killers are linked to the entity already, but I get what you‚Äôre saying. I think that would be cool. Maybe a character with this spider-like looking thing coming out of its back and that‚Äôs what it uses to slice you up lol
---
I guess so, I wasn't caught so i can't confirm on the "no wiggle", nor did I try to recover since I was more confused at the fct I was outside the map, but I can confirm that I couldn't indeed heal and when someone healed me the progress bar was stuck at 0 (although I was indeed getting healed)
---
No worries. We can still do KYF stuff and maybe some SWF (as long as you're either EU or East Coast). Rank reset is the perfect time too.
---
&gt;See Billy skin
---
&gt;See disgusting knotted beard
---
&gt;*"Look how they massacred my boy."*
---
Seriously can we just once have a cosmetic for Billy that *doesn't* make him look like an idiot?
---
I'M A CRAZY OLD MAN ON THE INTERNET AND YOU *CAN'T* *STOP* *ME!*
---
New killer here!  Just some questions.
---
I don't want to tunnel people, but I do want to slow the game down.  Is it wrong to slug someone I just hooked and go about hunting other survivors?
---
How do I signal to take the door?  I wanted to let one survivor go free.  I dropped them next to one of the exits, collected my trap, and went far away.  Hadn't found the hatch yet.  I did find the hatch later, but they had crawled away from the door while dying.  Couldn't find them.  Closed the hatch when they were almost dead.  Felt bad.
---
Can we get a special version of the Mori where we grab the flashlight from a survivor and beat them to death with it?
---
I don't have any DLC, yet.  I want to get the first 5 killers to 40, then I'll start adding DLC.  If buying them one at a time, is there a recommended order?
---
Some people just want to meme and do pro gamer moves, then dc when they find out they're not nearly gold enough to pull any of thise consistently.
---
Of course they'd never admit it, instead they will claim the killer is both baby and toxic for not getting mad at the flashlight clicking teabagging obvious time waster.
---
P.S. I know it‚Äôs already playable on the PTB, but I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
No. Leave as is. It sows mistrust between survivors and is the number 2 reason I use it. The number 1 being they have to waste time finding and picking their item back up.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve seen salty survivors sandbag or let each other die because that person stole their item.
---
Holy shit didn‚Äôt realize how close that was
---
Right sometimes you have to stay in gate to take a hit or something. the entity wouldnt freely give it's prey to the killers or there wouldn't be a hunt in the first place.
---
The amount of people that DC right as I get to them is way too damn high. This guy on the hook was my buddy though and he thought he was dead for sure.
---
No, fortunately there are still some people on this sub who can take a joke.
---
You monsters leave Baby Dweet alone
---
So try to escape and don‚Äôt struggle
---
I would have said that until EGC. Now I'm fine with them bringing whatever
---
Gonna add my name to the not done it at some point list
---
Yeah you got me there
---
But i mean the Winchester would make a great map.  plus dogs can look up.
---
This looks nothing like Claudette. Only thing similar is her skin color.....
---
7 pallets for 2 gens? I'll take it
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and I truly see no issue with rancor. If anything, it got nerfed with the obsession being able to change during matches.
---
&gt;the fact that playing survivor is pretty easy to learn
---
I disagree, I'm a noob, it took me forever to get my first escape as a survivor between skill checks not knowing what makes sounds having to loop etc, yet when I play killer I literally only get 3-4k's when I don't even know what my perks do. I switched to be a killer main because it was easier.
---
I'm sure this isn't the case at higher rank, but killer is by far easier to learn than survivor when you start
---
Is there any statement regarding the current state of the game client? Is there anything that they‚Äôre going to fix? How‚Äôs the PR?
---
As a purple rank killer. This works on me a good 70% of the time. I get so lost after a 360
---
Why can't my teammates be like this? You protect this dude, yet all my teammates leave as soon as possible while i'm on a hook even though the killer isn't around me or them.
---
Good job dodging the question dipshit, really just goes to show you're full of shit.
---
At least the raining blood outfit is black and the hem is closer to the real robes..this outfit looks like it belongs to the Doctor.
---
Yeah i fucking agree that shit gives me chills
---
Not really nerfed but less predictable. I see what you mean though.
---
I feel like when using the hot knife both the survivor and killer will scream revealing both of their auras to the other survivors for a few seconds. upside down is already a perk.... its a hag perk! I feel like the hex is way to much like ruin in my opinion. i really like the survivor perks although the last survivor perk sounds like one of janes perks! but i may be wrong
---
They get more points if they take the hatch though, so i let them take hatch.
---
You need the no exhaustion cheat if it‚Äôs gonna work
---
What about Nick? that was a missed opportunity for a new Ace cosmetic IMO.
---
Does Whispers activate on a survivor currently on the hook?
---
I thought I was on r/pokemon should have seen my face lol
---
Different experience for me, find a game within a minute and very rarely face a camper, been playing for about 2 weeks, few games here and there.
---
Now, killer. That‚Äôs a whole new waiting game
---
yeah would be pretty cool, with power that changed the game in signifkcant ways, or like new freddy
---
It's like I'm actually playing the game right now
---
i always think that until i see the fire
---
*DC*
---
nurse i understand but billy is the best killer on console lol so that can at least improve with time
---
In my experience it's not always worth it to let them waste every pallets. It really depends on the map, your ruin and how quick they waste pallets.
---
Because even if the survivor wasted pallets for 2mins, survivors could have done 3 to 5 gens. 
---
And then even with no pallets if the map has strong windows they will be able to loop enough to end the game. So you need to put pressure earlier than that.
---
How old is this screen? 2 years?
---
No reason provided, it's just not that strong
---
Yah, that works really simmily
---
That's a REALLY good point. I honestly think you're right about this.
---
Camouflage so maybe it‚Äôll still be alright?
---
Pls no, I can only be so erect üòì
---
Thanks!
---
Sure
---
I can go for 6, 7 is a little high
---
It's actually footsteps, groans of pain, footsteps, breathing, totem cleansing, and generator progress all at the same time
---
This can go both ways so I dont know why people still try to argue this. You see posts everyday on this subreddit about an OP complaining about how they wanted to get their killer daily done but they went against a toxic squadette with 5 purple flashlights 3 haddonfield offerings and balanced landing. But...god forbid the survivors want to win, right? Is this apart of the reddit killer rulebook? 
---
Its just a moronic argument both ways, why do people even bother?
---
&gt;4 Instaheal Medkits
---
If it's an agent, then thats 2 downs the killer has been robbed of. If it's a syringe, then thats 4 downs a killer has been robbed of. I agree with flashlights not really changing a game much, but insta-heals are quite an issue.
---
&gt;but billy is the best killer on console
---
Spirit: **am I a joke to you**
---
Awww shieeet I jinxed it. :D
---
This is every survivor I see on rank reset.
---
I'd swap something else for Lightweight, like Adrenaline or Borrowed Time. Lightweight reduces the marks from 7 seconds to 4, which honestly isn't that useful. Chances are the Killer will still see them regardless of how long they're up.
---
Why did I laugh
---
Slugging is fine but seen as very unfun from the survivor side, its a counter to decisive strike as well. I typically only slug if there's two players left and want the 4k. If you want a slower game, put on Ruin and hope they dont spawn next to the totem.
---
They cant open to door if theyre downed unless they have unbreakable/no mither, just stand there and let them wiggle off your shoulder on the door and then smack the gate switch. Usually I just carry them around and look for the hatch and they get the idea eventually.
---
For DLC, get Leatherface first for BBQ and Chili, then I recommend Michael and Spirit. Its mostly up to you orderwise, just get Leatherface first to help with the bloodpoint grind
---
One mori robs each individual survivor of 2 hooks. Even then, most survivors don‚Äôt get the chance to use it on a downed person, they usually don‚Äôt get the chance
---
Well, most of any company is money-greedy. BHVR at least on an administrative basis does strike me as a company more so in the "cash grab" spectrum of game studios (given their other titles, given the constant sales, the various un-optimized ports, some stuff about data-snuffing in their game that they removed once it was discovered, now taking Chinese investments from services that also strike me as data-snuffy), and DbD is their first in-house large-scale multiplayer success (or first of such titles at all?), but yeah, the developers working on the game that we see on stream and such seem nice and enthusiastic enough, but there is a clear lack of understanding of higher-level gameplay, and a very blatant incompetence when it comes to the technical side of the game's functioning. That's not to say they are just overall bad game developers, and maybe the crude initial code groundwork that the game was built upon is just very difficult to work with, but I mean, yeah, at the very least it says that they are not very good game developers. It's not like there's any monetary incentive to not fixing these things either, and again, various of them had actually already been fixed in the past, to an extent or another, but keep sneaking into the game; so it's not like they are just not dedicating resources to these issues either, they just really cannot seem to get them under control.
---
Ok.
---
I prestiged everyone at the same time and I am really regretting the grind right now.
---
As a killer who slugs the 2nd to last survivor, just fucking crawl away.
---
Fact is,if I‚Äôve downed you you‚Äôre fucked anyway. Your other teammate ain‚Äôt gonna be enough to get you both out if I hook you. 
---
The only guy who might make it out is your teammate, via the hatch. Why would I let that happen?
---
I wasn't defending moris.
---
I guess :D
---
Can‚Äôt believe this slipped my mind.
---
I can't downvote someone for having an opinion :) 
---
^^especially ^^when ^^its ^^^true
---
It only happens if you're playing Nurse for some reason. jane's thicc ass covers half of the screen.
---
I main Myers lol. But I mostly play survivor because I‚Äôm too lazy to get out of low ranks. Easy kills there for daily‚Äôs and the like
---
Tbh that‚Äôd confuse the hell out of me too
---
You unhooked him as the killer was destroying the gen, an action that takes a second. How could you know he was gonna camp him???
---
My b
---
Yeah, instead of them just getting their powers FROM the entity, I want a killer that IS the entity or atleast a part of the entity. I can‚Äôt really explain it lol.
---
new mode where ash is the killer and the killers play as survivors
---
Yea its come up a few times. Unfortunately it probably wouldn't be a good fit. Personally I would love it because I have a little sentimental value with scooby doo. The only way it could probably work is a "joke" chapter similar to The Evil Dead but the purpose and/or shock value of a joke chapter probably only has room for 1 and beyond that your kinda bending the rules of the whole concept of this game. But who knows maybe if this game doesn't go away there will be room for another parody type chapter.
---
NO, There is more than one fucking gen on the map m8, they wont all genrush it at once ffs
---
I used to do this a lot as Jake.  On one occasion I was in Lery's.  The killer came round where I was, and I hid behind a desk or counter.  He left the room, and looped back around a few seconds later as I was leaving the room.  I crouched right next to the opening of the room, next to a wheelchair, I believe, and the fucker walked right up to me, and through the door to the room, never seeing me.  I felt like the coolest man alive, hiding in plain sight, not moving a muscle.
---
Oh, you disconnect when a killer is using a good addon that you cant counter with your insta heals and genrushing! Nice. So you dc whenever you get hit through a window, a pallet, dead hard not working etc. When was the last time you finished a match? Fucking brainlet
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I would too, trapped is literally unplayable unless you've gotten at least one down while it's still up
---
THEN GO TO ANOTHER FUCKING LOBBY, YOU ENTITLES FUCK! Not everybody has solid connection like you, and even then its both of your connections toghether. Absolute disgrace of a human, how the fuck can your brain work like that
---
NOED on Mike though ?
---
XD
---
( ‚Äò_‚Äô) 
---
I‚Äôd like an explanation as well, Asking for a Friend.
---
The final chapter...
---
People like to shit on Trapper because he takes so long to set up, and they're not totally wrong. However Trapper is the best killer when it comes to a 3 gen strat, imo.
---
Run Unnerving Presence, Overcharge, Pop Goes the Weasel and Surveillance. If your gens are close enough, you shouldn't even need distressing.
---
Bring the trapper bag addons and they're going to have a hell of a time trying to get that last gen.
---
Well, these survivors were apparently bad then, the only problem is that they were rank 3's, 4's, and 5's XD
---
I hate them when im in their team, and i despise them when im the killer because i have to get 10 billion hooks to pip even once. If im too good for them ill barely if even black pip
---
Yea at least spirit can ignore the 360s Billy has to deal with when he's trying to chainsaw and the frames screw up.
---
I hope the devs will one day make the game performance alot better for both playerbase. PC and console, so far they've done pretty alright. But specific killers on console are just a nightmare for lag.
---
And i think i am one of them. Im sorry i bought the game yesterday and have never heard about it. Started watching dbd letsplays and montages to understand the game better, joined the dbd community to get some tips on how i should play and what i should do in these kind of situations. The game where i unhooked him right before the killer left was at the time where i had no idea what the hell i was doing. But if you think im wrong then so be it. Im sorry for making poor decisions im a better player know
---
Hold the fuck up. You are complaining about the killers internet connection while you are mostly responsible for it? What the fuck
---
That killer wasn‚Äôt using noed? Is this the same game?
---
I kinda lag because my intenet is ass, so all I play is nurse no add ons, with shitty perks (except for nurses duh), on console, and even though I get looped for like 5 gens ans it feels like I'm playing on a Google slide, if I actually down somebody they DC. Like I'm sorry, do you want me to play blind, because I might as well with lag and nurse on console, I get it you're having the problem too, but I'm getting fucked a lot harder
---
No aura reading does, so they're just bad lol
---
Exactly

---
i cant rank up no matter what. It does not matter if I 1 pip or double pip
---
I always forget she's DLC, she comes included on the console versions. Then yeah, def get her with Leatherface, Ruin is absolutely necessary when you start ranking up unfortunately. 
---
Yeah drop them 3 times and theyll instantly wiggle out. As a survivor, you can only recover to 95% or so unless you have a perk that lets you pick yourself up, otherwise someone else needs to heal you from the dying state.
---
Also, honestly just hook and kill the person, it's their fault if they ran right into you. If you see them and other survivors, go after the other people if you want to be nice, but I wouldnt worry about being considerate if you happen to find them again by themselves
---
There just needs to be harsher penalties for people who disconnect. 
---
Make people who disconnect often, de-rank more and also only be queued but against others with higher than average disconnects.
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed because it‚Äôs not that strong. It‚Äôs annoying when you‚Äôre the Obsession vs Rancor while running no Obsession perks though.
---
Even considering points they get from opening?
---
It does mean end game can be tough, but his overall lack of map pressure means he can oftentimes end up not getting many people. What *does* suck is that his power will potentially guarantee he does get someone, which can suck for the unlucky chosen one.
---
Here is a stupid question:
---
When the fuck are you guys going to improve this game as opposed to just releasing new cosmetics and killers? Your hit boxes are shit, the hook concept clearly doesn't work since you need to make an agreement with the killer to play fairly without camping and people constantly quit without penalty. 
---
My god, what kind of rinky dink operation do you have going on at behavior? Oh yea, the operation that says we just want your $$, fuck fixing the core problems with the game.
---
I always run NOED on mirror Myers. Survivors with Hope will actually outrun you, otherwise.
---
Okay so we have two options, you slugged the whole team and felt bad when Dwight was at a pube hair of health and just happening to be stupid enough to forget that and throw a hatchet. 
---
Or this was extremely planned after the last set of posts that blew up exactly like this.
---
Tbh a lot of those streamers used self care for a long time and basically stockpiled medkits over time.
---
*we‚Äôll be right back*
---
&gt;looking stupid.  
---
This a game where u can dress up in bright pink and in a santa costume. Looking silly doesn't matter lol.
---
"A nurse running spirit fury beat me, spirit fury must need a nerf"
---
Most really good killers use slugging a lot so I run it (with ds so I can at least use something to get up after getting farmed then cocked)
---
"When the survivor who throws pallets 20 years too early and tries to loop on the most unsafe pallets gets downed and sacrificed and say "gg  ez" in post game chat" :)
---
The only messages from online games I ever got, are from this game
---
And at least 90% is pure hate
---
Generally vs Clown you want to avoid unsafe pallets because he can naturally mindgame the low walls and the tonic slow makes it so you are very very open to areas. For those pallets, just drop them to get rid of Bloodlust or extend the chase. For the safer pallets, you basically have to assume it‚Äôll be a standard rotation of 1 loop, pallet drop, rotate away from the area instead of getting two or three loops because of his slow. Generally yes you want to drop the pallet earlier than usual and it will result in a dead zone so rely more on gyms and high ground to get the most out of your resources.
---
Is there any way to make the achievement "Taking One for the Team" more reproducable? I'm running Empathy and Borrowed Time and I try to YOLO rescue everyone, but god damn, dude. I am at 97/250 and it seems that half the time I'm getting points for the 100+200 point "Protection" saves, but other times I'm not, and then even other times I'm getting points for the achievement without doing anything it feels like.
---
I‚Äôve faced a couple on Xbox that fucking annihilated my whole swf group.
---
It‚Äôs all randomly generated. People tend to hoard their items, or at least everyone I‚Äôve met boards like I do too so they‚Äôre probably just investing in stash for later.
---
We could, FunWorld owns the rights to the StonedFace mask (I think they do, another redditor said that on this sub)
---
Yup he had noed still made it out though
---
I was waiting for bw
---
The dev Almo said once in his streams that was intentional.
---
I love how you just assume that I'm using the strongest survivor items and tactics in the game and pretend that the fact that they exist excuses using even stronger loadouts that I couldn't even counter if I *did* take everything the survivor meta has to offer. 
---
The statistics in my games look something like this btw: 
---
Survivor :
---
DC in &lt;25% of matches
---
Most common reasons: laggy killers/bugs &gt; op killer loadouts &gt; mate got facecamped/tunneled to death early on &gt; killers using unfair tactics
---
Killer:
---
DC in &lt;5% of matches
---
Most common reasons: Major bugs &gt; 4 man farmers
---
In my experience, if you only run Devour Hope and nothing else, Survivors are less likely to hunt for Totems. Sometimes you'll get a shitty placement, but if they're not actively looking till it pops, it could help.
---
Honestly I think a better idea would be Scooby Foo Cosmetics for the survivors
---
Your mental gymnastics are killing my brain cells
---
When you hook a survivor then all 3 other survivors circle the hook like hungry sharks, then in post chat they say "lul scrub killer camping hook"
---
Anyone want to group up and play today? I'm on ps4 but never have people to play with.
---
Yes. You are the only person in this entire games active community who thinks this way.
---
If you can't do 8 in one sitting are you even trying?

I think we can fairly move Quinton down next to Jake...
---
YES! THIS HAPPENS WAY TOO MANY TIMES! I just tell myself it's just the fuckin' barrel and not some P3 Claudette with Urban Evasion around one of the walls.
---
Sorry does it really only take 400 bp more to make survivors do what they should have been doing in the first place?
---
***YES***
---
Why does the Unbreakable icon look so weird?
---
Scrub survivors thinking killers need to go by their rules.
---
I play clown, Trapper, plague, and the occasional spirit, good God the amount of hate I've gotten. I've actual gotten the most hate for plague and second most for clown, which I find funny.
---
Not only rank 20, it can be higher ranks too
---
I should have, it‚Äôs just that English isn‚Äôt my first language. We all make mistakes :)
---
I mean, the killers are also just trying to win, I‚Äôm a survivor main but I still know us survivors can be just as if not way more toxic and ruin the fun for the killer.
---
The ultimate crossover meme
---
Stefan, TF2, and Dead By Daylight
---
Really? Because the devs made her hard, and wraith is intermediate in comparison. So while not easy, shes extremely unimpressive
---
I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs sarcasm.
---
they hated her cause she spoke the truth....
---
I've seen loads of people post their videos on here. Always the same stupid,pathetic Ochido influenced, ear raping videos with those lame generic screams and "1000 hours later" garbage. I always end up telling them it was a shitty video, then block them because I don't want to see any other stupid post/comments of theirs. But this, the editing was great, the music is great. I really liked this. Good job
---
"When you are about to play killer any time during the month."
---
feels bad man
---
Okce you've already achieved a rank below 7 or so. How does one go about it getting the adept achievements for killers? It's really difficult and something I should've done when I started playing.
---
Ah, a Classic meme. Thank you my friend
---
 Tantum ad tardus ludum tantum exigua
---
I think that staring at them for too long (around 5 seconds) would trigger one of these:
---
Distortion in the screen
---
Static on the screen
---
Exposed Status Effect
---
Had a survivor sending me hate mail because I kept leaving him alone, instead of chasing him.
---
Well yeah, guy. You're a decent looper. I'll get you when there's only two of you left...which is exactly what I did.
---
I believe that omegablink is a crutch that bad nurses use to win games. Therefore, I have a negative opinion of it and believe new players should not use it as it makes playing other nurses more difficult. Under the original post, someone commented on my opinion towards omegablink in a calm and respectful manner. I then linked a masterthread for tips that I made slightly after the comment in which I edited and stated differently. This gentleman, however, said I had no clue what I was doing without reading the other comments. If Omegablink was in his opinion, so amazingly strong, then losing with said addon. I dislike Omegablink because it's not needed and a crutch, but to each their own.
---
The Clown is one of the weakest killers. That‚Äôs why.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 0 seconds and it feels awesome when this happens to a YouTuber I‚Äôm watching
---
I got an awesome comment on my steam profile about 4king a squad with Billy using only m1.
---
He's boring to play as, unfun to face and not very strong
---
it's a shame so many people use stealth killers for hook camping
---
I dont get what seems to be the problem of running urban...
---
?
---
Was this recent? Devs added a simple LOS check to prevent totems from spawning in places visible during the camera spin a while ago.
---
Tfw the entire community wants you ingame and you finally get added in
---
Nah, because much like this guy, you don't really want your mind changed. You just want to drum up attention and drama.
---
I don't camp as Leatherface or any killer at all.
---
I‚Äôve been playing without ruin recently and gens get completed way too quickly without it. At high ranks ruin is basically mandatory if you don‚Äôt want the game to be over within a matter of minutes.
---
I gotta agree with that along with Nea doing C and B torture to me.
---
Doesn't help that unless you're playing a good-time survival game, the BP gains are an absolute joke.
---
Sure thing mr. Rank 20
---
Basically Hag.
---
No one ever suspects it
---
What map even is that?
---
The Hag, but she got cannibalized much less
---
*Blood Warden Activates*
---
I went AFK before a match while I was leveling Freddy, and forgot to switch back to a different killer. All 4 dc'd after the first down. 
---
Easy game, easy life.
---
Father Campbell's Chapel
---
I'll give the hatch to the last person if:
---
I've dominated the whole game and they didn't stand a chance
---
They gave a fun game and weren't toxic
---
One or more of their teammates DC
---
Because DCing as Survivor because of a mistake you made is just as toxic as face camping on first hook. Bvr needs more punishment
---
Then, when there are NO PALLETS AROUND, I get stuck trying to distract the killer with little defense and once I get caught, they refuse to rescue even if the killer is nowhere near me ;(

We can agree a pc nurse is insanely strong, but it's not egregious for you not to get a 4k with it, especially when it only happens 1/21 of the time, on maps that kill frames.

I find Leatherface a pain in the ass to get downs with. I feel even pre-rework Freddy was better than him. BBQ is an amazing perk though. 
---
What happens with me is my chainsaw always whiffs at the absolute last second.
---
Already going to insults, impressive. Guess you have that little faith in your argument. I made my comment about OOO, if you want a more generalized one, the person affected by rancor either brought in obsession perk(s) and accepted the risks of a killer using one, or got bad luck at the start if no one brought one in (which at most games like that occur 1/10, then you still have to get the obsession on you.) If the latter, it still only affects a survivor end game, and the person is well aware throughout the match what is waiting for them, giving them time to prepare.
---
"Should I perform a mori on him?"
---
No lol, someone drew that a few months ago
---
A lot of people shit all over clown, but he's honestly a really strong mid tier killer. 
---
If you use a combination of his bottles and certain perks, like bamboozle, he basically shuts down loops and ends chases really quickly. 
---
The only bad aspect of clown is his lack of map pressure that killers like nurse and Billy have, which is easily countered with certain perk setups and consistent patrolling.
---
For example, I currently run:
---
Bamboozle, Pop goes the weasel, Discordance  and Ruin.
---
Bamboozle helps me stop chases pretty damn quick, pop and ruin help slow down generator progression, and Discordance counters gen rushing pretty easily.
---
Currently at rank 4, and win games pretty consistently with this setup.
---
Oh, ok
---
When you get 1.5k upvotes just for playing the game normally. Speaks volumes about the DbD community.
---
As a Jake main can confirm waiting to perish
---
The easiest (and most consistent) way to do it is by running empathy and taking a hit while the killer is carrying the survivor. This'll count as a protection hit. If you stand directly under the hook, they'll have to hit you in order to hook the survivor.
---
It still won't be *fast*, but you can more or less get one protection hit each time. Bonus point if you're using Mettle of Man, it'll give you an extra hit and help make up for all the hits you'll be taking.
---
I've watched this 5 times already I love it
---
Right. Normally I only use BP offerings when playing with friends, but I‚Äôm gonna prestige David so I‚Äôm using all of his offerings.
---
P3?
---
Pig can too just slowly.
---
"Just to slow the game down just a little bit."
---
I love when I hear Monto saying that and I hate it when the totem gets destroyed not even 1 minute into the game...
---
This happens whenever 2+ people have the same name, the game has no idea wtf to do so the portraits/health bars glitch out
---
Camping: Staying near the hook.  
---
Tunneling: Chasing the same survivor immediately after they are unhooked.  
---
Looping: Running around the pallet to get the most out of it before throwing it down.  
---
Pressure: Keeping the survivors busy to make sure that as few people are on generators as possible.  
---
Gen rush: When people only do generators, nothing else (though this gets thrown around more than it should).
---
Those are probably the most common ones.
---
Because people that play like that are the ones who can't take heat off of another survivor that's already been hooked twice. Playing like that means survivors get an extra hook phase.
---
This game is designed for survivors to run killers. Not developing those skills screw over not yourself but your teammates as well.
---
Love seeing a good nurse
---
Doing one gen takes 1 minute and 20 seconds.
---
So it should be nerfed because of an unlikely string of bad luck if you didn‚Äôt bring an obsession perk? This perk is weaker than noed since they get at most 1 kill from it while noed can end the whole team.
---
Died laughing!
---
Hahah, nice one! If I had gold I'd give it to you.

She does.  The ponytail cosmetic even has a Zoey quote.

Wastes your time....at endgame? If he wastes time looking for you, gates opened by teammates, you can escape. If he goes after a teammate, you‚Äôll see when they get hit, and can open a gate yourself. As long as you aren‚Äôt careless, you‚Äôll get out in that situation.
---
But at least it gets used instead of lying randomly somewhere. I always just take it and don't care if someone takes mine. If we see each other, we can always exchange items again or sth
---
Honestly why doesn't he? It's really disappointing that his "voice acting" amounts to a bunch of lines in the lobby.
---
Okay so now I‚Äôm positive that you don‚Äôt tunnel since I know your mindset about it. 
---
There are two types. Camping and facecamping. I think you know what the latter is. The former, however, is when you‚Äôre floating around the hooked person in hopes of catching anyone nearby. Which seems to be what you are doing. In this case. You‚Äôre not pressuring the gens, allowing them to be safely made, same goes for totems and you‚Äôre not chasing anyone so pallets are still standing around unbroken. It is considered camping because, well. You‚Äôre camping around the hooked survivor‚Äôs area.
---
You can definitely catch a survivor or two this way but often times one is going to distract you while the other rescues. And if you‚Äôre not committing to a chase until the hooked survivor dies. We can call that camping. You lose a percentage of the points you earn in the deviousness category I think? The longer you stay near the hooked survivor‚Äôs proximity the more points you lose so the game itself encourages you not to do it.
---
When you get hooked and a killer‚Äôs just preventing the other survivors from saving you by staying close to you until you die you‚Äôll understand it.
---
I think he is good for the balance, he shows very easily how the people gets triggered and thats not good for a healthy debate, but its also true he uses these areas ( campuses ) to promote and generate debate which he already knows what its going to be the answer. He knows his business.
---
I‚Äôm new, but everyone says I have shiternet. Is it on my end or theirs? I feel bad playing if it turns out I won because of my bad allegedly bad internet and that they sucked.
---
---[TO BE CONTINUED]---&gt;
---
Just if youre being nice and you can see theyre clearly an inexperienced player and/or got screwed over by their teammates. 
---
Baby dwights and people that got farmed off the hook I let go all the time.
---
i cant stop laughing at this.
---
* You generally want to have repaired 1 generator. This gives gold, and to reach red takes a lot more efforts.
---
* Saving/healing people is a very quick way to get more emblems in altruism.
---
* Make sure to have perks that helps not be taken out of the match in first 9 min because that would give bronze in survival and almost surely depip.
---
* If you haven't been chased by the killer a lot, you can try being in his terror radius to get some evader points (and then go for an easy save once he hook someone else).
---
Essentially paying attention to how the ‚Äúunhooking‚Äù category actually works. The first two times someone is hooked everyone will lose points for that tier, by unhooking him/her everyone will regain those points with a bonus/penalty to the guy whom unhooked that person depending if she/he escaped or was caught immediately. If you can keep everyone off a hook you‚Äôll easily hit a pip or two
---
Looks neat, hood needs to be a lot looser though, GF‚Äôs hangs down to his neck
---
It does affect Freddy‚Äôs aura reading
---
As someone who used to be a decent rank and now hangs around the 16 mark I would say use bond to see what your team mates are doing. If you see them being altruistic then smash out gens, otherwise go for saves and if you see them being idiots just laugh it off and don‚Äôt take the game too seriously.
---
You can't really do much after all the gens are done, unless survivors are stupidly altruistic
---
I'm rank 11 and I'll still look for the hex only if it's my first game on
---
I chased the same guy for a whole match because they were "wasting pallets". Little did I know that there were enough pallets to keep me occupied for 5 gens
---
Am I losing my mind? I could have sworn I killed 2 survivors and suddenly they reappeared back in the game.  
---
There was also this guy who spammed his flashlight rediculously fast. Like with an autoclicker or something.
---
I‚Äôd be Ducker I mean Tale... uhh
---
Yeah
---
We could have Chad as the killer: The Charred.
---
&gt;bullshit complaint as doing gens is the objective of survivors
---
yeah, but imagine being waiting 20 minutes to get dropped in a 5 minute game where no one in the lobby gets more than 10k bloodpoints and 1 pip
---
There‚Äôs plenty of pressure to be had if gens are done and you sacrifice two I feel that‚Äôs breaking even and three is basically a win
---
Good Luck and happy Stalking!
---
Whenever I see open gates with no survivors to be seen I just walk away. No point in allowing myself to be t-bagged. They just waste their time
---
Any and ALL aura reading the Killer can have on you is blocked by Sole Survivor. Aura's are only counted as the bright red outline you see as Killer, like Generators and hooks you see when carrying a Survivor.
---
Aura's ARE NOT the outline bubbles you see with things like Doctor's Madness, Rancor, and Infectious Fright.
---
It‚Äôs when a killer focuses on one survivor, which is  against the survivor rules for killers.
---
ok Ill name situations hatch was close,mid-chase,traps on exit gates,you getting slugged with one gen,remember me,legion with dumb luck,post rework freddy with obsession addon,any killer that can traverse the map fast,iron maiden. All these things can help ensure you get caught or slow the game down just enough for them to find you
---
Thanks, I loved watching no0b3's videos with myers looked so fun so I just said screw it and bought it
---
I think everyone is missing the point I was trying to make that people are getting punished for other people
---
This is great! You can tell that you actually put some effort in to it. Thanks for sharing! 
---
I also subscribed because I enjoyed it so much.
---
It would be fine, except survivors have ruined it to the point that teabagging the killer is toxic in general. There are worse things you can do so if you love it, do it. But, the killer will almost definitely interpret it as you being a jerk. I play both survivor and killer, I used to teabag at the exits to say goodbye and now I don't because I've never had a time as killer where a survivor teabagged me and I thought "Oh, he's just saying bye." Smarter people then me have suggested pointing at the killer as a better way to say goodbye than teabagging.
---
yes, when someone dc as soon as the game starts.
---
ENTKOMMEN
---
I bet you‚Äôre fun at parties
---
that can be said about almost every perk just because it had counter play doesnt mean its healthy or good look at the old DS
---
The devs sadly couldn‚Äôt get the rights to Sidney, they only got the rights to the ghostface mask from fun world
---
It‚Äôs dead by daylight man. Everyone‚Äôs gonna complain about every aspect of the game, no matter what. Just play how you want and ignore chat
---
Absolutely none. Assuming they're still *actually running away*, it just looks a little silly (and it's satisfying to do). It actually slows them down slightly.
---
If it's when you're about to hit them and they move wildly from side to side, they're trying to make you miss.
---
You are indeed losing your mind for the first bit. The second bit could just be them binding their flashlight to the scroll wheel.
---
Thanks, you too!
---
How were we supposed to know that
---
Literally not a single comment like that, you just wanna be a victim. Not a single killer above rank 18 facecamps without being forced to stay near the hook, and even still they rarely ‚Äòfacecamp‚Äô. Usually just proxy camp.
---
On projectile killers, like Huntress, Plague, Clown, makes it harder to get hit.  But also just good practice.  Will I keep zig zagging?  Will I go left, or right?  It's harder to hit a lunge if you don't know where your target will be.
---
Ah, I see - it's just for fun. c:
---
I believe that is because survivors can do a ton of stuff to win BP and the killer has a more limited amount of actions but yes, I do agree it‚Äôs way harder to get blood points as survivor without offerings. You do have to fight 3 other people for totens and saves and shit
---
Did you seriously just get downed at the killer shack by a non- blinking, pallet breaking nurse??
---
That makes sense!
---
Thanks for info.
---
Even though the other survivors were swarming the hook and you had nothing else to do
---
Wtf
---
They're making it easier soon. I believe mid chapter. Basically you'll get bloodpoints for how long you survive, boosted bloodpoints for cleansing dull totems, and more
---
ok first issue if you get slugged and run adrenaline they can just smack you down,second issue is that you can escape if they close hatch thats what a key or wake up is intentional for,third if you get hit by noed mid chase you are not guaranteed to die your teamates can get you and you could escape,fourth if your hiding your teamates are still affected by remember me combine that with a perk like bloodwarden and your done,I have a problem with this perk specifically because it punishes a survivor for using a perk that they may not have the idea of the perk is stupid I misphrased the meme it shouldnt be a nerf but a rework seperate conditions for when the survivor doesnt have an obsession perk.Just like monsterous shrine,no mither,left behind,and sole survivor.
---
Okay. thanks. There are quite many aura-reading perks these days so maybe it is worth of trying. I found it easy to avoid killer using OOO, because I can see him practically always approaching me (even though he can see me too).
---
Oh hidy ho officer, we've had a doozy of a day. There we were minding our own business, just doing chores around the house, when kids started killing themselves all over my property.
---
&gt;Literally not a single comment like that
---
"When you hook a survivor then all 3 other survivors circle the hook like hungry sharks, then in post chat they say "lul scrub killer camping hook""
---
Okay lol.
---
&gt;you just wanna be a victim.
---
Are you this dense, that was my whole point. Comments tend to get filled by whiny people who are butthurt and it's typically on stupid killer posts where they somehow rationalize camping, but not teabagging (both are stupid). I'm not arguing on the validity of either, just the rationalization of both.
---
&gt;Not a single killer above rank 18 facecamps without being forced to stay near the hook, and even still they rarely ‚Äòfacecamp‚Äô.
---
Oh and you literally just did, what I said would happen, so thanks for that.
---
I dont know when, but they are getting added in. Check out the year 3 roadmap
---
Does anyone know how the scrapped tape is affected by the electrode range upgrade? Does the inner ring get smaller along with the outer ring getting larger? Is it just one or the other?
---
Gotta be cannibal or doc at this point.
---
I‚Äôd rather use Lightborn if I really want to counter flashlights. They‚Äôll never blind you but they‚Äôll waste their time trying. I remember one time a SWF tried to double flashlight me and i still didn‚Äôt get blinded lol.
---
His personal perks would include: 
---
Record throw- you throw a record at the killer. It does no damage and doesn‚Äôt stun. 
---
Red on You- When he points at another survivor, they get red ink on them.
---
Blow Over- you go to the Winchester and have a pint.
---
The game is balanced more toward swf now, so solo queue can be very difficult if not all 4 survivors are competent and experienced. A bad mistake from one survivor can throw the entire game if the killer chooses to leverage aggressively leading to many 3 and 4k games. 
---
The game is very snowbally. Its kind of like chess in that if one side gains a substantial material advantage, its very difficult for the other side to recover.
---
Tomorrow!
---
Damn, this looks amazing. Did you make this piece yourself, OP?
---
I was waiting for Ghostface to come join you guys
---
Your complaining more about game mechanics than the perk itself at this point honestly. People learn perks as they play, so far your argument could apply to enduring and spirit fury because ‚Äúit breaks looping‚Äù, or other poor arguments. All it does is force you to play different, and not even by that much.
---
Wait you speak for everyone? Also again, it's about when it comes to camping killers immediately come in to defend it **I'm not arguing the God damn validity of camping, get it through your skull**. However, I never see survivors coming in to defend teabagging even though you could make just as many arguments for it (Idk distracting so you can take the hotheaded killer away from gens, getting back at them for tunneling/camping, hell if I get virgins that somehow can't get me with noed I'm sure as hell going to rub it in their face)
---
For a survivor in any state except dead.
---
You husband now.
---
How dare you make excuses, now go to the corner while we unhook and heal &gt;:(
---
That's not obvious? :O
---
So, you want a worse Body Block Hag?
---
GAS GAS GAS
---
I downed dwight early on and my cat threw up so i didnt even know he was that low.

Why is it that evey time I play survivor I go up against the same type of players. They all play killers with exposed status powers and all use noed and camp, tunnel and depend on perks and are so bad and clueless it's mind boggling, why???
---
I see that insidious. You are a man of culture
---
Tell that to 2 of my matches yesterday
---
So survivors should just let you hook their teammates and not do anything?
---
You can‚Äôt just make rules for survivors to follow.  I get that it‚Äôs annoying, but it‚Äôs their objective to have ae many as possible survive, and preventing the killer from hooking/taking hits for others is literally an action they get points for, so you can‚Äôt blame them.
---
It is more of the fact as a rank 20 killer I get a rank 11 survivor who just dominated all game.
---
Fake news. False propaganda.
---
Honestly feels like most of the sub is a mirror of this sometimes XD
---
Yeah we got the game on game pass and got really into it, watched quite a lot of guide on good perks etc
---
Or just a shaggy cosmetic for Dwight
---
I dunno, it's my first reddit post, sorry '-'
---
But you got ran for 14 pallets, so that means the survivors basically won.
---
Cannibal yes not doc he is higher for me due to how much blood points he gives you
---
I want to look good while getting absolutely ass fucked in red ranks
---
Depending on your mouse, it can be faster to scroll down then press space bar.
---
On my Logitech mouse, if I give it a good spin, it will keep going until I stop it.
---
Your swine is fake bacon
---
Bloodpoints doesn‚Äôt equal strong killer.
---
As a killer, one of the most enticing things is that "Unhook" or "Gen fuckup" notice. They cause people to run and give me easy prey.
---
This happened to me while playing freddy. It's a really easy glitch to avoid but unfortunate the first time it happens.
---
* Common image repost.
---
There is also the simple fact he takes stealth a deletes it from the game
---
If you have a problem with game mechanics, make a post about them. Comparing rancor to the old ds is laughable, rancor is nowhere near that bad. Again, you just have to play a bit different, it isn‚Äôt hard.
---
With an optional Trash Man skin from Always Sunny.
---
That's the joke of the game though. 
---
I had one match where every single survivor did nothing but throw pallets and there was an exceptional amount of pallets, they definitely got the maximum.
---
Did you try the ptb dedicated servers? I‚Äôd aim for lobbies with green ping and it worst than live servers with high yellow / low red ping.
---
I have little faith dedicated servers will fix this issue. Their fuck up was increasing the hit box sizes when legion came out
---
How do you avoid it?
---
The cooldown make this perk kinda pointless, compared to BBQ
---
Yeah i skipped the "april fool's patch" one lmao, still. It wasn't looking like one with how much of a long shitpost you made, i got confused my bad that im a dumbie. It was looking completely serious from your side.
---
Thanks for the feedback, but would it make more sense in combo with sprint burst? I mean they often want spend their exhaust running to the hook indeed
---
But we assumed you were following a pallet-dropper for the whole match ;)
---
how is running the killer around pallets and getting sacrificed is winning?
---
People who complain about body blocking baffle me, I love it when survivors body block. You get free easy hits and half the time they don‚Äôt even save the person anyway.
---
Like two days ago I was playing hag. Got a 2k and 1 dc with the last survivor getting the hatch escape. In the chat, the survivor I mori‚Äôd said ‚Äúlmao REPORTED‚Äù
---
Wild
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Werent they just trying to farm with you?
---
As annoying as it is, yes. This is one of several reasons why Stridor is a superior perk.
---
Amazing work as always
---
And your main perk does not appears again until you are P3 lvl 70.
---
Yes, but try balancing that while keeping in mind that most players play solo :)
---
At this point I just check every post with the mematic watermark just to see who got the free karma
---
watch the video again. she attempted to strike at the claudette, but hit the pallet. she knew the game was over.
---
Oh there is a battle pass coming? Dayum
---
That's shocking
---
You‚Äôll never know if a killer has Whispers or not but if you want to be sure if they have bbq or not, there‚Äôs a perk from Jeff called Distortion. It has 3 tokens and ever time your aura would be revealed you lose a token, your aura can‚Äôt be read for 6 seconds and during that time you don‚Äôt leave scratch marks. Basically if you have that are someone gets hooked from across the map and you lose a token, you know they‚Äôre running bbq.
---
We all get them. Learn to laugh at them or disable them, best route kill em with kindness. I'm a survivor main, but play killer when I'm sick of being camped and tunneled or have baby survivors as teammates... First message received as killer, "gen camper" XD I was doing a daily and there was always two people at this gen I just kept losing them. Fun fact when there's 1 gen left to repair, there's 3 gens on the map that can still be finished.... I ugly laughed at that message
---
Tru3Talent. Full length matches with chill and insightful commentary. Each video is well titled too.
---
Oh please educate me of my team mates point of view, please do educate me, also weigh in why I should prioritize their enjoyment before mine.
---
Nah, NOED is the problem. I'd happily trade Adrenaline for NOED. It completely changes the outcome of a game.
---
yes because killers are perfect angels
---
Both rings get bigger so you just make a big donut.
---
idk if it counts but i watch Ohmwrecker
---
No because you can see the long before you start the match, you chose to begin the match with them
---
Whispers and BBQ are the big ones.
---
Nurse's Calling is probably next up. It'll allow the killer to see your aura within a certain range while healing. As a general rule of thumb, you don't want to heal inside the killer's terror radius.
---
Discordance is also somewhat common. If two or more survivors are on a generator, that generator is highlighted. If it seems like the killer always appears at your generator when you're working with someone, you might want to split up.
---
Thrilling Tremors is a more recent one. It's still up in the air whether or not people will keep using it, but it's new so you'll see it pretty often. If you notice generators being blocked in the middle of the match, the killer is using Thrilling Tremors. If you're working on a generator when they pick a survivor up, it will block any generators *that aren't being worked on* for a while and highlight the ones that are. You can play around it by getting off it and waiting out the blocker, but it'll cost you some extra time.
---
&gt; It was looking completely serious from your side.
---
That's exactly how I intended it lol. The dream would be working something like that out with BHVR.
---
Farmer John and Hybrid Panda
---
Tell me about it. It's been very annoying waiting for these while watching survivors and killers who already have loads of cosmetics get even more. I am shocked these cost shards though.
---
Outplayed tbh
---
Only played a few days, huh? Either you‚Äôve been playing for pretty much every hour since you got it or you‚Äôre lying. No way you‚Äôd be good enough to get that low in that short amount of time. Especially with the rank reset.
---
1: Slugging is fine. You're giving up a hook and giving other survivors a chance at a free save.
---
2: Open a gate for them. That's a clear signal of "okay, we're done, now leave."
---
3: Would be amusing but not sure how they'd implement it.
---
4: Cannibal (if you didn't get BBQ from the Shrine) followed by (in no particular order) Myers, Pig, Hag, and Spirit. Clown and Legion are probably the best choices after those 4.
---
Just for fun. If you've got one of them fancy mice, you can bind your scroll wheel to M2 through your mouse software. That way scrolling counts as clicking M2, but you can also press and hold M2 if you want to blind.

I got a feeling that a Legion I was playing had Whispers just based on how they were patrolling but that does make sense that you can never be certain. I hadn't heard about Distortion though, thanks for the information :)
---
Your art style is fucking awesome
---
What is "griefing"?
---
Points for opening + escape: 6125 (5000 for escaping, 1250 for unlocking)
---
Points for just letting them escape through the hatch: 7000 (5000 for escape, then an addition 2000 for escaping in the hatch)
---
When this happens, don't touch any gens. Hide in a locker and wait for the killer to check the totem and leave. Pretty much 99% of killers start the game by going straight for their totem, which is how I find those totems 99% of the time.

I have a lvl 50 huntress and BBQ didn't appeared not even once, but i got it lvl 3 in the first webs with legion, but when I prestiged it did not appeared again until I reached p3 lvl 50+. Spirit fury is another one I almost never get it, I only have lvl3 with my legion and many bloodwebs after lvl 50.
---
Oh shit I made a typo
---
She was probably trolling
---
Enduring and whispers are very strong. Noed is good for low ranks, but not really a necessity on Billy. I'd keep it on for a while.
---
Bitter murmur is also strong, but due to Billy's one shot capability I think that deerstalker could be better. Easy snowball/slugging potential, but the main thing to remember with Billy is when to chainsaw and when to m1.
---
interesting, but if you game alot using a wireless mouse really isn't an option. Sucks about the issue tho.
---
I feel like they need to implement an avoid system. So toxic killers and survivors can be avoided. Or people with bad internet.
---
Looking to level all of my survivors to 10, then get some looping advice on PC. Same name on Steam.
---
The other day I had a game where a teammate ran around for about one or two gens to get done, threw every pallet down (actually every pallet), then when they got caught, disconnected.
---
Dustin?
---
I can agree not all games are laughable, I had a game where I was the only one killed, despite doing 3 gens and running the killer for a long time without using too many palettes AND saving some of my fellow survivors. I got the most bloodpoints even though you get 5k for escaping and one of my team mates had the audacity to say ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù. Thats usually the point where I start playing killer.

Noed makes sense in very short game where people gen rush hardcore. They make less sense if its a slow game where people waste time doing things like cleaning totem.
---
Spirit requires skill and is a good killer to play. You have to be moronic to think that the spirit requires no skill.
---
So Wraith with hatchets?
---
Lmao just use urban evasion on Blendette
---
But apparently this would be an impediment:
---

---
The mind games are what make her so much fun. She's not easy, and isn't even viable unless you like taking risks that might prolong the chase if they fail.
---
Tunneling is when the killer goes after a survivor who was just unhooked OR if they chase 1 survivor all game ignoring other survivors.
---
Pretty much lol but look at hillbilly and leatherface
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse isn't for tracking, but it could allow a killer to sneak up on you much easier.
---
Nurse's Calling is used a good bit, so not healing near the killer is probably the safest bet. 
---
Discordance is good to be aware of too. 
---
Bitter Murmur which shows survivor's auras near completed generators isn't common, but lower ranks/new players might use it so it's good to know about.
---
"Muh survivor rules"
---
"Muh victim complex"
---
"Someone asked me not to do something why am I so oppressed"
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a pretty fair play. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs toxic anyway and I‚Äôm a survivor main, bc killers that only slug and don‚Äôt hook at least 1-2 people, it tends to be their downfall bc they can‚Äôt come slug them back down straight away since when another survivor heals them they‚Äôll have forgotten where they downed them or the survivors will get away before they can come grab them again most the time
---

I mean, I think there's a difference from shitty connection to LS
---
Camping is considered toxic gameplay, Even as a biased killer main I don't reccomend you do it, it takes the fun of survivors, unless that is what you actually want to do that (annoying survivors).
---
About that "harrasing" just shrug it off, it happens to us all, no matter if you play killer or survivor.
---
Requires no skill
---
Is countered by walking instead of running
---
So the inner safe zone gets bigger?
---
 confirmed. i refuse to prestige up, so every now and then i'll throw a rubbish offering out there, like the one OP saw
---
At first I thought this was a meme because of the title, But wow. This is really well done and I love it!
---
There‚Äôs just no counterplay, iron will isn‚Äôt a counter most of the times. And loops are useless against her.
---
She‚Äôs like a dollar store nurse
---
Whatever man, you're really missing the point of the post, I added our ranks so people wouldn't assume we should be hitting the hex skill checks every time.
---
seems unlikely it would be the console. may want to consider rebooting your router and/or modem.
---
Spectacular art! I especially love the look on Meg's face, such an expressive display of emotion.
---
I think they mean just that, hinder your gameplay so as to de-pip and lose ranks. I could've very well misinterpreted but that's what I got out of it :p
---
And then she sprint bursted into a trap.
---
&gt;nurse is by far the worst
---
Console?
---
Yes I'm that bad at the game.
---
Oh nice. Yea I want bbq bad too. Not sure if I'll like playing Leatherface but we'll see
---
I've had some games where I solo up and get thrown into a game of low ranks. It might just be the game not finding enough players at that rank and picking the next lowest person in queue it can find.
---
Trapper here reminds me of main protagonist of Splatter House games
---
What I said was in relation to welcoming new players to the game and promoting growth, and not making fun of players worse than you.
---
What you said was some next level triggered jargon. Did some survivors make fun of you again?
---
IDK why I pressed RB
---
I understand that. But for some reasons low rank players don't gen rush, or at least are much much slower than higher ranks, which is why i think NOED makes no sense in low tier matchs.
---
I had already used unbreakabke iys a one use thing.
---
So long as there weren‚Äôt multiple people hooked at the end game / gates being powered/opened it‚Äôs fine in my opinion of ‚Äúthe altruism rules‚Äù if there were multiple people hooked at the same time when gates were powered I‚Äôd say at least try. But it doesn‚Äôt matter this game can be a cooperative game in which we all survive or nobody does and can be a solo game as to the only thing that matters is my survival. But most time when I choose to be cooperative I tend to die. But if I had a daily (daily&gt;the rules) :p
---
The killer could not be any more true for me lol
---
YES

Has too good, I know players who report and quit every time they see him.
---
But every time I fight him I've escaped so Idk about all that
---
To anyone that thinks there's no counter to spirit.. Actually go a play her for a bit, learn her mechanics. I can counter spirit fairly well as survivor because I can play her as killer well.... When you hear the phasing sound walk away from wherever you are. I've had good survivors be able to loop me well enough, not forever, but well enough to the others to get gens done if it's a good team. She is hard to play against, I know. But you can still win.
---
At that rank people do expect you to hit hex skill checks. Why lie about your rank? For those sweet upvotes?
---
If I'm thinking of letting a survivor go, I drop survivors at the hatch, close it in their face, and if they have adrenaline I kill them.
---
Sometimes I also let the last two finish the last gen, and I kill the one with adrenaline.
---
Adrenaline is one of those perks that is OP unless you're winning anyways, but it's really annoying to deal with.
---

---
If i see someone D/C at the beginning of the game, I'm doing that same... just not dealing with that 3v1
---
One of my friends does it often.
---
He says its because if he is the first down, he usually gets tunelled and spends all game on hook. He is new so he doesn't have DS and can't loop very well.
---
I don‚Äôt know what goes through people‚Äôs head, but can you help me? I play on my macbook. It‚Äôs a really fancy and expensive one I got as a gift. It plays most games on medium to medium-high settings with no issues and can play much more taxing multiplayer games without issue.
---
It obviously does not have an ethernet port (that I‚Äôm aware of) and I am forces to use Bootcamp in order to actually play DBD. Is there some way I can fix my situation?
---
&gt; There‚Äôs just no counterplay, iron will isn‚Äôt a counter most of the times. And loops are useless against her
---
None of that is true against a player that has no skill at playing spirit though
---
My fiancee prefers to use Freddy/Huntress, so the camping isn't usually a common occurrence. Nonetheless, we'll make sure it's not every game.
---
That's so bad, for an add-on that already pushing the limits of situational usefulness. I recently got my first interview tape though, that thing is hilariously fun.
---
The dude is good at the game and is up against someone of also good skill and when the person with good skill has a good strat he sends them hate mail? lol
---
monto his videos helped me know what some perks do
---
Noob did the same for me
---
This looks amazing, I love Meg's expression.
---
Thank you for the kind reply.
---
I honestly think we both will have to change our strategies for the good of the game. However,I still don't appreciate the name-calling.
---
Excuse me? I have played nearly all killers that I have available and I only found nurse and huntress harder to play with. She's definitely not easy, if you don't know how to use her power properly you're just a 110% m1-killer.
---
Now that is some good stuff. Interview plus High Stimulus for Railgun Doc. Run 5 Hex Doc with Haunted, Ruin, ToTH and Devour Hope And every time someone tries to pop a totem, you point and shoot.
---
BT only works vs campers, so you're a camper?
---
DS works only vs tunnelers, so you're a tunneler?
---
DH is fine, Adrenaline is hardcountered by NOED. Not even instaheals in your fake story omegalol.
---
Have fun camping because you know you're bad, btw you were already camping or you wouldn't complain about BT or DS, loser.
---
Oh okay. One more day of patience for us Tapp and Pig players I guess.

Yep and I've literally checked before every game lol. Either I'm an outlier or there's way more swf than you're wanting to admit (I'm definitely going with the second option cause I've seen a shit ton of people have the same problem)
---
This is really good, keep up the good work üëçüèª
---
You‚Äôll get better, just keep practicing
---
when you mori someone in the autohaven garage duh.
---
You can't stalk hooked people, so how exactly was he facecamping you to get infinite tier 3? Are you sure it was that? Are you sure you're not just making shit up?
---
The hood should be a looser and you need to do a thumbs up for the camera.
---
It's more because I play killer more but now I actually started playing survivor again because you get 5000 bloodpoints just for escaping.
---
Anyone on PS4 and would like to join in, in creating a DBD community to play 'Kill your friends'?

Best is when they loop you in shack for 5 seconds then give you the god pallet. Thanks!
---
OK then
---
That Nurse was so potato. That's adorable.
---
Playing against the same type of killers every game is a gift. You can always be ready to counter. Exposed makes dead hard useless, so don't waste a slot on that unless you're going into the match injured. Take a toolbox over medkits, borrowed time, kindred, balanced landing, hope all would work against that kind of build. If they're bad though, you dont necessarily need to try that hard. You make them pay for it and maybe they can learn from their mistakes. Doing totems helps nerf the killer and scouring chests can give you more flexibility incase you have a bad build for the killer.
---
A Meg tried to do that to me but forgot I had NOED. I promptly threw a hatchet at her and she dc'd.
---
That does sound nice, but I guess with how broken/overpowered things were back then I'd rather take the longer wait
---
This would be seriously amazing. I love that movie so much.
---
Shaggy would be the killer due to his unlimited powers of god.
---
usually either youtube twitch or reddit
---
I have considered having my switch on hand, but it didn't seem worth, but I'll give it a try for sure
---
Okay, you're obviously trolling. In case you're not, I do not main spirit, I purchased her like 2 weeks ago and I'm not good at all with her bc she requires skill. She definitely isn't the most broken killer, nurse on pc is more broken. I never claimed to be good at this game, I actually played wraith yesterday and got a 4k, I do not play trapper very often I'll give you that. I never claimed that those killers require no skill, when it comes to using their power they actually don't require any skill. It takes time to learn the ins and outs of phasewalking so when you look at it like that spirit requires more skill than both trapper and wraith. I find it rather funny that you call me obnoxious while I'm the one making points in a calm manner while you're just jumping to conclusions and have no actual support for your claims.

Leaving would be playing the game normally. You are incentivised to not risk yourself in this situation with a high risk low reward instance

Otz is. Hands down.

Hybrid panda has added music to his videos and I can‚Äôt begin to watch them. So frustrating. 
---
Monto posts videos of his amazing gameplay and he‚Äôs just bullying green and purple rank survivors. Red ranks don‚Äôt fall for the crap he does.  
---
Puppers is usually pretty cool, but he flips out sometimes and whines about the game. 
---
True is great to watch for strategy as he is one of the better killers out there. 
---
Zubat is the best huntress out there. You have to watch his stuff, it‚Äôs so scary. I‚Äôve played against his hag a few times. He hooked two of my teammates before a gen was even done in one game. Easily a top killer with certain characters. Maybe better than True?
---
The holy trinity for sure, that's usually where I've been landing as well
---
I fucking love this lmao
---
Dude this is awesome. Has a 90‚Äôs comic book feel to it
---
I main killer and ever since they've balanced the game a little more I barely get bullied unless you count hate messages. Killers seem more toxic than survivors now in my experience.

Always cleanse as soon as you're sick. The plague is incredibly overpowered when everyone remains sick, it's practically eternal NOED. The fountains for her aren't strong enough to worry about, sure you might get injured, but you can use the speed boost to get to an open area with no obstacles where she is at her weakest. IF you do cleanse, and she's chasing you with corrupt purge, it's way better to drop a pallet early, especially if she's about to puke. This will cause her to have to swallow the puke and break the pallet, buying you precious time for safety.
---
Again, speaks volumes.
---
Whoa, not nice.
---
Please find some examples of people defending facecamping, i don't mean camping or tunneling, those aren't toxic, I mean actually facecamping. No one says "I facecamped because you were swarming the hook" that's an excuse for patrolling, stop making shit up
---
At rank 1,nurses on PS4 are no joke. Especially because they're almost nonexistent as you rank up so you have no idea how to actually counterplay them. Fun and exciting games though once you figure it out!
---
It‚Äôs still what imma call her

It actually doesn't. It's actually just how most people operate in life in general and doesn't say anything about the dead by daylight community... Other than it consists of people from real life.

I was imagining some pretty good mind games with the hologram. Kinda like the spirit just start walking away and if they follow thinking your invisible going around the back you just turn and boop.
---
Thanks man I appreciate it

Right? How dare someone say that survivors can bully a killer without also starting that killer can bully the survivors in the same meme. It's a meme, chill. I'm sure someone has already posted a toxic killer meme today that you can enjoy.
---
The curse actually encourages tunneling after you hook everybody once and also will make the games a "slugfest".
---
the first one seems interesting, it would cut chases, I like it. 
---
And the looks are a total no, There are many witch looks you can work with, but the halloween decoration one is like having a blanket ghost killer (Other than Myers or a joke skin)
---
I think the chain adds a really nice touch. Is it attached to the bear trap?
---
I generally avoid either side, no ones gonna be happy no matter what. I thought people would get the sarcasm, is it really that bad? I took the line from the satiric samination videos.

No, leave so someone can get the Hatch if they need it or go back in to see if you're needed for a bodyblock (if you know the Killer doesn't have NOED).
---
Sitting and waiting for the Killer at the Gate is the least helpful thing you can do unless you just really want to give the Killer those 600 extra Brutality points.

Reddit is a shitty website I don't have a main account here, I make new accounts to post if I feel like talking bout this game.

---
Well... Did you use the new sprint burst exploit? If so I kinda agree with him. It's not meant to be in the game üòê
---
i mean if you hooked all survivors at least once AND sacrified the obsession (for dying light) and all this time survivors only did 2 gens... you will win with any killers lol
---
Wait, this isn't just me? I use a wireless mouse, never have problems in any other game, but in this game sometimes I just don't swing.
---
Or too stubborn to realize
---
I said at a 3 gen, in which the three closest generators are all that remains. The killer can just patrol them and basically take the game hostage.
---
I was the killer, I messaged him lol
---
*the garage killer*
---
I mean people bitched and moaned about DS and did it not get a rework
---
I would change 
---
**The Asteroid That‚Äôs Overdue:** For each generator completed, gain one token up to a maximum of 5. For each token, your terror radius increases by 4/6/8 meters.
---
15 meters at max level isn't very good or even noticeable. I think with a max rank of 8 per stack, it could make extremely intersting chaotic games, and I would love the absolute shit out of it as killer and Survivor. Would also be a nice perk for doc.

No, you're not getting it. They're getting 1.7k upvotes for a sick ass play that most people would probably bail out of. Not playing the game "normally" because it's not normal gameplay.
---
ZubatLEL is one of my favorites
---
my husband loves me the way i am - bitchy know-it-all who constantly corrects people. so parties with him are always fun for both.
---
Ussylis.
---
&gt; it hasn't hurt anybody.
---
I mean camping isn't very fun to play against, but def not bannable.
---
The main part of your post is you are too scared to voice your opinion like sorry twat waffle you are.  ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt talk to me like that irl‚Äù lol tf big guy
---
I've been looped by good survivors... there is counter play to her
---
Tbh survivors will almost always name call no matter what you do as killer. But i do think camping is both boring and not very effective.
---
Whats the exploit with sb?
---
I mean, I'm in the same boat of people who think noed is a bit overkill because of how quickly it can turn the tables of a game but I don't think you should nerf it into the ground
---
laughs in nurse
---
you have to change the game files!! 
---
there‚Äôs lots of tutorials for it, it‚Äôs pc only tho :((
---
Then you have a lot to learn. Because no matter how good a survivor is, he can‚Äôt guess right everytime. It‚Äôs a 50/50 against a spirit.
---
Lol this meme could also work for something like "Killer with a daily to chase survivors for 3 minutes"
---
There is a line of sight check, but I have still spawned right next to totems that were around a corner or tucked away in the tile I spawned in.
---
I assume they've just take like a two month break maybe. Tbf, I know the meta too since I played on PS4 but I only recently got a PC
---
Bbq along with using BP offerings. Killer naturally gets more BP per match, and it‚Äôs pretty easy to get 4 stacks every match
---
Ayy, first time I saw someone mention him
---
That is not what Survivor Rules means lol
---
Right, everyone else‚Äôs fault but yours......
---
I can easily say the same back to you about having a lot to learn if you think that's true.
---
T bagging, flashlight spamming, pointing, be the the endchat was cancer
---
That's such a weird fucking way to think. Not only have you shown you're upset by crouching a few times, but you ensure someone can't play the game, and also yourself. Staring at a hook has got to be the most boring thing you can do as a killer, and I don't know why you'd even want to play if that's how you're going to do it.
---
Idea from u/sprinklepop
---
Hybridpanda, Scottjund, noob3 and demi are awesome
---
Because it needed one, unlike rancor. You have fully failed to show how rancor needs one.
---
Yeah, trapper is so damn cute haha
---
and they are the one who "bully" non meta killers.
---
Tru3 was right after all
---
I‚Äôd kill for a wolfman killer
---
If you don't punish it, you were dumb.
---
Thus it was  E Z.
---
or the nurse, she would be funny as well.
---
Baby megs are really cute too
---
Because Rank 20s are scared that they'll lose the kill if they leave for a second, and prefer to guarentee a kill
---
I hit more people on accident in the cornfield with the chainsaws than on purpose.
---
I should feel bad but it's hilarious.
---
Yeah thats why they exist
---
Even on console I think nurse is the best but she's  worse and more tricky than she is on pc
---
Then after the match when you kill em they say "gg ez baby killer" lol
---
unbreakable is pretty cool, yeah.
---
don't get why everyone is being shitty in the comments. it's clearly a low-ranked game. everyone is new/bad at some point. give the guy a break.
---
You can also use distressing and thrill of the hunt, people still go for it even if it's your only hex totem, but just try and get BBQ stacks and protect it
---
The biggest counter to flashlights is being good at the game. Face a wall; get a free hit on the nearby crouching flashlight wielder and pick up in the direction opposite they ran, slug if they‚Äôre in the open.
---
Flashlights are a killer-friendly item because it pulls survivors off of the objective and makes them actively *chase the killer.*
---
For real, I don‚Äôt know why killers get mad about that. Don‚Äôt immediately pick them up, check surroundings real quick, and face the wall to pick them up(if you‚Äôre by a wall of course).

Hey neighbor! I‚Äôve got all these pretzels I made for a bake sale but I‚Äôm outta salt, spare a cup or two? You seem to have plenty.
---
Do you have any specific positions for the traps?  Or do you use darkening addons?
---
Many of the traps I place recently get avoided or snapped.
---
I'm honestly curious what is the sprint burst exploit? Cause you'd think once you sprint you know exhaustion takes affect.
---
"Now you two young ladies stay in the basement and think about what you done!" - Billy.
---
Nurse is undisputed #1. 
---
Spirit and Hillbilly are also top tier.
---
And use Huntress‚Äô bloodhunt, something like that, one of her perks. It‚Äôs 40%, still adds up
---
Where can I get this specific icons?
---
There‚Äôs been a lot of lags on PS4 today. Noticed as a killer survivors would disconnect but it wouldn‚Äôt be a usual one,  they‚Äôd be froze in mid animation for a while before they go and now as a survivor I just saw the nurse float sideways into a wall stay there for a few seconds then I‚Äôd go from healthy to downed and on the shoulder in the space of 4 Frames
---
Remember kids, they may have a mori and you don‚Äôt realize it yet.
---
The proper way is any way you feel like playing that doesn't include hacks or exploits.
---
Excellent work
---
For basement trapper, one on either side (or both) of the window but preferably on the outside, one on the corner to the right of the window, one on the inside drop of the palette, and then one around the corner of the bottom of the stairs. 
---
In general (not basement), put them on either side of palettes (NOT in the middle), around corners, and sometimes in windows. I also like putting them at the top of hills to fuck over balanced landing drops. It's more about area denial for general play than for actually trapping.
---
The main reason i play killer is because i know what it feels like when a killer camps when no one is near the hook and tunnels all game. But survivors have a lot more ways then killer to be toxic. They can tbag, flashlight spam. Derank to bully inexperienced killers, have a rank 20 in a swf to bully killers, insta heals, Object of obsession to always know what and where the killer is. They can bring a haddonfield offering with 4 balanced landings. If a killer is camping someone on the hook theres 3 other survivors that can be doing gens. A killer nodding isn‚Äôt toxic lmfao
---
So it's more fun do die knowing the GF is camping than doing gen?
---
That's my initial response to anyone suggesting a rework to perks that don't need them ever.
---
I mean if we were to get Shaun we would kind of need Ed as well. killer could be the pissed of naked roommate zombie
---
Lol
---
There should be like a minimum ping that everyone needs to have before a game starts. Even then sometimes it'll be green in the lobby and then someone on the killer's WiFi starts watching Netflix or some shit and I start teleporting
---
At this point it's not GF problem, if the team is altruistic and wants to throw themselfs to GF, why should he want the hard way? Don't give people the easy patch and after boo them for taking it.
---
Ussylis (Idk how to spell his name) did a video on flashlights, it was helpful for me and i already know how to do them so you can definitely learn from him.
---
But how would we know lol Shit post OP
---
Check their profile. What even are you asking?
---
I'll check it out.
---
Idiots gonna be idiots ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This hurt to watch, but hey! You can only go up from here. Keep playing and improving!
---
And what‚Äôs his gamer tag lol we wouldn‚Äôt know because it‚Äôs against the rules.
---
They didn't seem very coordinated so I doubt it.
---
You right, you right. All you people always have better ideas than meüòÇ
---
They change that sounds a couple of months ago and it makes me really paranoid
---
Flask of bleach should be base clown tbh.
---
These are awesome
---
Something about dbd feels different. As someone who used to get a little bothered by BMing I can say that dbd BMing feels a lot more belittling and annoying than other games. I've played countless other games where BMing does occur but not as much as dbd and it would never bother me but for some reason, dbd felt different. I saw people who would play other multi-player games, no problem but stayed away from dbd because of how often BMing occurs, and how different if feels. 
---
We as human beings are pretty sensitive, not everyone is thick skinned and a lot of people can't handle it. So although I don't think people should take BMing seriously, I understand why some might feel the way they do.
---
You look at his profile and see if its the same cover image and profile pic. Are you okay?
---
Are you ok, or just salty about a bad connection to the host. Any proof of lag switching?
---
Farmer John. Perfectly matches my sense of humor and not afraid to admit when he goofs
---
This. 
---
Always fake the pickup before actually picking them up.
---
I was told that I was a bb trapper when I got the 4K. 
---
Big HMMMMMM
---
This pic have been posted thoose ammount of times
---
Honestly it's kindof dependent on the situation at hand. If they suck at gens and only get one or two done while you destroy 6-7 pallets, good strat. If you start the chase and you're 60 seconds in and they've got 2+ gens already yeaaaaaah you're getting rushed and might wanna break it off
---
Ikr
---
How can i see that
---
OP spirit be like... prayer beads ebony mori... not fun to against.
---
Oh nvm i just get it
---
I recorded it. I'm posting the video later, I'll give you the link. It was extremely obvious or I wouldn't have made this post. No one could move, no one could do anything but people were going down and getting hooked instantly.

**Survivor - Dale Dobson**
---
An altruisitic hillbilly just trying to look out for his friends.
---
* Perks
---
**Good-Natured**
---
* Completing *Altruistic* actions or *Protection* events grants a Token, up to a maximum of **10**
---
 * Each Token grants an additional **3/4/5%** faster *Healing, Recovery* and *Cleansing* speed.
---
**Stonewall**
---
You seem to attract attention quite well, but not in a good way.
---
* Other Survivors within **8/10/12** meters will have their *Auras* hidden from the Killer.
---
 * When the Killer would normally see the *Aura* of a Survivor affected by **Stonewall**, they will see yours instead.
---
* **Stonewall** does not affect other Survivors with **Stonewall**, and the Perk will become disabled if you are affected with *Blind*.
---
**Best Friends Forever**
---
With your best friend, anything is possible.
---
* At the start of a Trial a random Survivor is chosen as a Best Friend, other Survivors with **Best Friends Forever** will take priority.
---
 * Survivors cannot have more than 1 Best Friend.
---
* Best Friends can see eachother's *Auras* while not in a chase, up to **24/36/48** meters.
---
 * While within **12** meters of your Best Friend, both of you gain **6/8/10%** faster *Repair, Sabotage, Cleansing, Healing*, and *Looting* speeds.
---
* If your Best Friend takes lethal damage while within **8** meters, they will go into a **10** second bleedout timer.
---
 * This ability puts **Best Friends Forever** on cooldown and all it's effects will be disabled for **120** seconds.
---
* If your Best Friend is *Killed* or *Sacrificed* gain a permanent penalty of **6/8/10%** slower action speed for *Repair, Sabotage, Cleansing, Healing*, and *Looting*.
---
Not entirely sure on what kind of survivor Tucker could be, but I believed Dale to be an easier and better option.
---
Prayer beads spirit requires minimal skill
---
Legion has cosmetics in the store, so they‚Äôve got plenty of variety. Killers like Michael, Freddy, etc don‚Äôt have anything but their default stuff plus their prestige gear, so it‚Äôs more tempting to Prestige them just because of the additional customisation.
---
I feel like he‚Äôs being sarcastic, why so many downvotes?
---
If you leave you can't go back and bodyblock, so tea bag
---
People only put "Rank 20s When..." In their memes because they don't want to offend any of the audience of this sub.
---
Monto for the builds, Noob3 for the loops, HybridPanda for the chilled gameplay.
---
Yeah, I don't feel I am, but I feel this is the kind of game where a killer would form the opinion that a survivor was toxic. 
---
I've had hate messages before when it's their choice to continue the chase.
---
I guess I just want to separate that playing well does not equal toxicity, but it's generally good players that do display toxic behaviour which makes everyone else look bad.
---
Yeah but characters in identify V cost a lot, so I don't wanna spend an entire month trying to get a single killer.
---
Seems I forgot the second ‚ÄòL‚Äô. Guess I‚Äôll die
---
I just find Freddy's to be boring. It would have gotten bottom tier if not for the fact that all of the ones in bottom tier are almost the same
---
This looks silly
---
The internet doesn‚Äôt need more of your retardation.
---
Two wrongs don't make a right though man
---
Playing in that manner ruins the game, as none of the survivors can get much BP even if they ignore the guy on the hook and do the generators. Play how you want, but of course people are going to be mad because playing killer this way wastes everyone‚Äôs time. Even he himself is going to struggle to get a lot of BP and pips. Eventually, that strategy will no longer work and he will left crying about survivors being OP, because he never took the time to learn how to play the game as killer as opposed to mindlessly camping hooks.
---
To each their own I suppose.
---
I'd like to know how it's killer sided. The point of the hatch is the first one to find it ultimately has the upper hand, however you still have 2 extra means of escape, either gate or using a key to open the closed lock, not only this but you don't even have to complete any gens to have it spawn. ALSO you can't get grabbed anymore so if your being chased and you see it, it's gg. The fact that you can't have a 3 hour hatch standoff anymore doesn't make it killer sided.
---
Gonna wanna throw a /s at the end next time my guy. Lost a fuck ton of karma for some solid sarcasm.
---
Omg. I love playing Nurse and I wish they would remove her range and extra blink add ons.
---
He isn't wrong though. They should not have harassed and messaged you. That being said, he is trash though for camping with ghost face. 
---
People who only play killer like to make up rules all day for survivors who do things that have minimal impact on the game (teabagging) but then do shit that actually prevents someone from playing and ruins the game for everyone. Hur dur do gens. Yeah, walking away from a game where I only get 10k bp and a de-pip is fun.
---
Bloodlust
---
You are so wrong about the demogorgon part. It even isn't a second Entity it's more so a hive mind of beasts that kill and eat people plus I don't really think there is even a rule the entity can't take beastly creatures even if so the rules for entity taking someone is kinda weird. they kinda already did a deal with Netflix so it's unlikely that the demogorgon won't come to DBD.
---
Me or the devs? If me, because I like this game? lmao and if the devs, because they've already devoted themselves to a narrative, and are continuing to do so (with the Rift and Archives later on). Why ruin that work with that?
---
I understand this is usually frustrating. However, I did mention that this isn't a strategy he usually employs. So while I agree with your first points, I do not agree with the last one.
---
Slapped his face with words lol
---
Kindred buff please!!
---
Where is this video?
---
Yeah. And ofcourse not everyone was against it but you did see people who on the subject of changing the mori perspective would whine about it.
---
Dont ask me how it would make a crutch to see a claudia teabag twice and then keep running while i was stuck tombstoning meg.
---
Laughs in Brutal Strength
---
Got a game on that stupid map on Sunday against 3 Claudette. Keep in mind that I'm still learning nurse. I wanted to die.
---
Sounds like 80% of the community bud
---
Why is it that any time I see a Jake he's either a complete fucking forehead or he's an absolute god?
---
Honestly this, when I play killer I rarely get "bullied" but as survivor I constantly get tbagged, Head banged, ect just bc I didn't run in a straight line and die
---
I can see how that is problematic
---
You. There even already is a killer with his own dimension. I don't see any problem. As for the rule of killers must have been human: why would it matter to stray from that?
---
"Yesss, yesss. waste the pallets before any gens are even done..."
---
Wraith and leatherface yea, legion no. Legion isn‚Äôt strong strong but he isn‚Äôt weak either, he‚Äôs my main killer actually, and I‚Äôve seen a lot of good results from the community about him. If 3 survivors are healing and one is on a hook then gens aren‚Äôt getting done.
---
Keys also allow a 3 man escape or 2 man escape without even finishing the objective Soo.. :/
---
Preach it
---
There are plenty of good reasons to put the Stranger Things universe characters into this, at this point in time it is more relevant than ghostface who got put into the game and also with the most recent season of ST there's plenty of good lore points to put into any character that would be put into this game. Plus I think we are lucky we get any lore in this game, there is no over-arching story that BHVR owes us.
---
That setup is crazy OP. Especially in yellow ranks
---
Good work it was entertaining
---
*flashbacks of baby megs sprint bursting away from a generator they blew up*
---
I too remember ORANGE LOBBY
---
Lmao I love them as killer dude. Cus they'll go from pallet to pallet and by the time I actually commit theres none left on the map. I always make sure to respect the pallets while they throw them down so I can get free hits on him and any swf with him later on with the few pallets left. They are like it's ok hes terrified of pallets. OH GOD HE LUNGED RIGHT THROUGH IT WHAT THE FUCK
---
That‚Äôs just wraith
---
Oh my god
---
Thanks man it really means a lot
---
This is why I love playing Ghostface
---
I assume you mean Freddy? Yeah but he's not a Lovecraftian elder god lol, and for them to have once been human matters because when the Entity takes them they either are willing or unwilling and he changes them or tortures them until they do what it demands. How would taking what is essentially another Entity even make sense, let alone why it would be able to in the first place.
---
Looks like she either lost connection or intentionally dced when he started the grab so they got stuck, I've seen it happen with other grabs too
---
No, you anticipate how a survivor will move so you strike where he will be not where he is. 65% of the time your killer will get a auto-aim seizure it swings him to where the survivor was, screwing over your positioning and it'll make you turn your back to a running survivor that's in the meanwhile skidaddling away meaning even more lost time.
---
That is not a latency issue... neither is it meant to do that, but it's exploitable by survivors. It's just there on console (I don't teven think PC has this function since they use keyboard and mouse) and there is no way to turn it of.
---
Outplayed
---
It's come a long ways. I started playing in summer 2017 and killer balance has definitely been on an upward trend since about March 2018
---
Left 4 Dead 3
---
She isnt that bad. It's just most people get the timing wrong. You could try switching your controls to something you prefer.
---
Agreed. But since NOED and Ruin are band-aids for a lack of skill, a necessity to have either perk at higher ranks does not indicate there is a lack of skill, it indicates an unbalanced game.
---
Jokes on her that‚Äôs haunted ground. Amazing work 10/10
---
I've spawned hearing a hex totem once. It was actually in a good spot too (upstairs in Iron Works of Misery in a corner covered by boxes).
---
Respect the killers perseverance lol I usually stop following a looper after he‚Äôs takin me around 2-3 loops and I‚Äôve made no progress. No toxic survivor but killer needs to know when to break off
---
I think you are preemptively overthinking this.
---
Weird, I haven't seen a killer complain about number 2,3 or 4. For me it goes a little like this :
---
Thou shall not pallet loop. Thou must stand at a hook and let me kill you.
---
Thou shall not use flashlights. Thou shall not save your teammates with flashlights.
---
I suggest message him ask about it you shouldn't just assume that can happen with bad net I have seen it
---
How bout the guy that was killing people all throughout season 3?
---
Mori spam is straight out griefing one player usually at a point of the game where you have time to spend. I don't understand how you even defend that kind of behavior.
---
Survivors don't need chests or items to destroy killers. Waste of a killer and waste of perks these are F tier perks at best. We are all dumber for reading this and may God have mercy on your soul
---
I have no idea
---
Need to bring unbroken too for when they gun us down we can get back up
---
Normally I agree that survivors cry too much about camping, but OP literally admitted to him camping. It's one thing to patrol the area, or check the nearby building/gen, but to straight up face camp is toxic
---
what's wrong with disliking microsoft?
---
TFW you‚Äôre storming Area 51 but you gotta hurry because you only have 20 more pallets left, Dead Hard, Defensive Strike, instaheal, and Jake‚Äôs Borrowed Time.
---
My friend messaged him and asked why he lagswitcher and he said he wanted to see the new ghostface mori.
---
Another fellow man of culture I see
---
Sure, that'd be recognizable to fans and normies alike, random killer dude from only one season
---
It's a fake.
---
Oh so pretty much admitted it I guess that's it fair enough
---
I haven't played him as killer as I don't want to spend the money, but I always have so much fun facing agaisnt him as survivor.
---
Clown's should be S tier just for how hilarious it is if he spams the animation.
---
Yeah, that's a problem.
---
Not on console,  been playing for a few months and I have seen 1.
---
I agree! He forces you to have great awareness and ability to loop. T1 is scary and T3 is, as well. Great killer design. Maybe the most fair and balanced.
---
I've gone against him many times at high ranks and low ranks. Everytime I see the newest killer teleporting around the map and instadowning survivors I know it's him
---
*laughs in unbreakable*
---
She‚Äôs right there
---
I‚Äôm on xb1 and granted I‚Äôve only had the game a month but I can say that at least 1/4 is the spirit
---
i didn't think BHVR ever read any of those reports.
---
When was there a time where not all the survivors died immediately and somebody brought in an item or you saw a chest open. Yeah exactly. Items makes games easier for people and some cases faster. If somebody doesn‚Äôt have self care there going to try and find a medkit. If somebody wants to be distraction they are going to bring a flashlight. Chests are more important than you think they are and there has not been one game where either I haven‚Äôt looked for a chest or I saw a chest/chests already open and like 90% of my games somebody brings in an item.
---
Ash has this in the bag.
---
Oh wow. Killer runs back to hook as soon as unhook occurs, and rather then going for the rescuer go for the easy target because they‚Äôre insecure bitches. That‚Äôs an excuse? More like the killer did that because they were playing poorly and couldn‚Äôt apply gen pressure. But ok.
---
I edited my post to include the possible actions taken.
---
I'm a rank 1 survivor and I don't open chests.
---
Turns out the specialist is the doc with addons.
---
You might not, but others do.
---
Yeah they filed it on the official website with video proof. I had a game with a legitimate lagswitcher and I tried to report them on the website but I didn't have video proof so they did nothing. And also the in-game report system does nothing.
---
YOU CAN GET THIS BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS AT OCHEEDO DUT CHOP
---
What rank are you? No bully but like. I‚Äôm rank 4 and I come up against some cookie cutter badass nurses. Deerstalker, Devour Hope, Infectious Fright and haunted ground every other game.
---
Put spirits up a tier
---
You can have a sprint burst on demand, like dead hard. You can remove the downside of sprint burst which is having to walk normally
---
I thought that at first too, then I got a third DH token mid chase, hit the guy and was like 
---
‚ÄúOh, so that‚Äôs what that does‚Äù
---
All I am saying is they are not needed and no rank 1 killer is running any of those perks. Just run Franklin's if you care about items tha much. Revolving a killer around preventing survivors from using items is stupid.
---
Breh
---
Get out of rank 15 Lul
---
I can't give less of a fuck about Stranger Things. But it wouldn't bother me if it got some representation in DbD.
---
Will you not be posting the individual ones per usual?
---
I think everybody thought this at first because that's what exposed means. They should change it.
---
Yeah, it's really annoying and I hope the devs fix it asap
---
The only thing more stupid than tbagging is a deceloper than temp bans people for tbagging
---
Yeah, there's generally something wrong with grabs lately! I've seen it a couple of times too - killers not getting the grab even if the animation started for a brief moment or - like here - killers getting stuck in the grabbing pose.
---
I'm not getting it? What, my own point? This wasn't a sick ass play lmao.
---
One more time. Speaks volumes.
---
I dont think i have had a more bonding experience with dwight than this panel. Screaming internally would totally be my go-to reaction
---
It's not reportable, but survivors do complain. Though you lose points for letting a survivor bleed out so it's in your best interest not to do that.
---
I'm not saying its toxic, I'm asking how you find them comparable to doing something that prevents someone from play t he game at all.
---
Looks like someone got blown the fuck out by Ms. Yamaoka.
---
Poor miss piggy. They always do it to her.
---
‚ÄúAs Nea, Unhook 5 survivors and escape knowing full well that your gonna get sacrificed after you unhook the guy anyway and never escape‚Äù
---
So did i
---
I have one other theory that the hitbox drags behind the survivor poorly because I have been hit halfway down windows quite a bit and when I am hit with franklins the item drops a little bit behind where I actually was (could just be the perk though)
---
Sadly, in my experience I get bullied most with her. I just cant do her justice yet, so I take my vengeance with freddy.
---
wait they got buffed? when?
---
It is not a bannable offensive but it is considered a foul play by the community. Try to avoid it unless there are clearly other survivors around the hook or if you're really struggling to do well and need it.
---
I mean you can do it as much as you like, no one is stopping you, but people will get mad and it promotes toxicity in the game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Me too ! I read the description of haunted grounds and I thought i could see their aura after they cleansed a totem and it didn‚Äôt so I thought the perk didn‚Äôt work x)
---
Axe: *flies past shoulder* yep, looks like hitbox
---
Can‚Äôt convince you because you‚Äôre braindead. Tell me what happens to the survivor mentality  if 1 extra survivor is injured, rather than just downing the same guy? I‚Äôll tell ya cuz I‚Äôm a predominant survivor main: ‚ÄúOh shit man we‚Äôre all injured, we should probably heal‚Äù   
---
Now what happens when you down the same guy? I‚Äôll tell ya again cuz I‚Äôm a nice guy and I have sympathy for idiots: ‚ÄúShit man he‚Äôs tunneling, GG, just go do gens and burn his ass, he‚Äôs not getting this next hook, I‚Äôm gonna depip anyway might as well make it two‚Äù *DCS*
---
There's no way you got banned for teabagging, it isn't against any rules and does not violate anything, so either there's something you left out you're not telling us or you're lying
---
Gotta get to red ranks somehow
---
Yeah but like if they get unhooked and you run into them later they could just call that tunneling right?
---
It was always laggy when I played nurse in dbd in December on console. Now it‚Äôs almost as smooth as on pc. Huge difference
---
Top tier strat right there. Can‚Äôt get hooked if you aren‚Äôt found in the first place
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Or maybe I dont know we care about each other and want everyone to escape....I know it sounds crazy that survivors arent hungry sharks
---
DS and unbreakable? Survivor be packing heat
---
What? Incoherence at its finest.
---
I wreck with freddy ATM, granted I still lose some to highly coordinated SWF's or the occasional hatch. I'm excited to see what changes,  but I will miss the current mechanics. 
---
Now what I want is a Stranger Things monster with powers kinda like Freddie's right now.
---
I'm a simple man, i see 3 or 4 items on survivors? i bring franklin's
---
Candyman Looks like a neat option Imo
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
defensive strike
---
Love it so much! Hope we can see some artwork of yours in the future featuring Ghostface stalking some survivor in the background!
---
I agree, they're much more fun to play as and against when they play like a creepy stalker.
---
yeah as much as a cramped mineshaft would work for DBD (you know, spooky horror game), I personally can‚Äôt stand indoor maps gameplay wise. especially the game..
---
If you are bad at evoiding flashlight saves as a killer, you can also just run lightborn, although you need to get it from teachable hillbilly
---
If that happens all u gotta do is run off the edge. You'll Spawn near the hatch.
---
Is there Killer Rulebook for Survivors?
---
Hahahahahahahahahaha.
---
I can relate with him. i‚Äôve been taking scaredy cat since ghostface came out
---
Ok survivor main
---
Of course you werent being toxic. That guy was just an idiot that tried way too hard to get to tier 3. He should have aborted that chase when 2 gens were popped.
---
Its called imagery. I made you imagine sharks because the action is similar. Go read a book
---
Shut the Fuck up.
---
https://youtu.be/mlz5_XDVGqo
---
Its not the most recent, but tyde is a example.
---
Then provide proof. All we have from you is a "woe is me, I must be banned. Obviously it was because I t-bagged"
---
Especially with ghostface
---
*Prepare to be reminded of what Blood warden is*
---
Salty players gonna salt. No matter what game you play, I always find it hilarious that the person who loses claims the winner has "no skill". Deflection at its finest.
---
Yeah you're right. its not really supposed to look realistic. more of a cartoon'y style.
---
Them fancy city folk might say that ain't proper, but if it's still got some meat you best throw that roadkill on the grill.
---
someone hasn‚Äôt read the Survivor‚Äôs Rule Book for Killers
---
‚ÄúAll you did was trap‚Äù was probably said by the guy who knows trapper likes to put them in loop locations so his next move was to waste all the pallets because obviously he can‚Äôt trap you if there are no pallet loops
---
I actually like this idea. A lot. However, BVHR would never do it. Anything that might change how survivors play tends to get scrapped.
---
"I can't loop since I can't look at them, bad killer is overpowered 1!!1"
---
This is bullshit dude.  They absolutely don't ban for teabags.  What did you really do?
---
shit i broke a lot of rules with this one
---
Demi, Tru3, and Farmer John.
---
he tbagged at every pallet or place where he was safe, used a flashlight, didnt let me be stealthy cuz he was always up my ass, i know using a flashlight is just being good at the game(if you manage to use it correctly) but you make skill equal to toxicness if you act toxic while doing these things since you it is easier to make the killer mad and you are actively trying to do that
---
sprint burst definitely is an advantage BUT double blade ruined the game and moonwalking ruined the game. I'm not saying don't fix sprint burst just making the distinction. pointless distinction that only seems to upset people, but a disctinction none the less lol
---
Well, ruin's name Is like that for a reasons lol That was suppose to ruin his game and get u the 4k hahaha
---
Huh...that's actually interesting. Like I see it as annoying but interesting.
---
i‚Äôll have moments where i‚Äôm running for the exit while billy is charging and run by a guy who‚Äôs standing perfectly still for him and i‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúWHAT ARE YOU DOING‚Äù
---
Meg got an adrenaline boosts after hearing the gate power on. However, her joy shrouded the fact that the totem next to her just got lit.
---
The demo gorgon isn't a entity it's a animal the mind fayer is a Animal too they can be killed and they have to have  a body.   A Entity doesn't have to have a body and is banished not killed as it can't be destroyed just gotten rid of. It would also show how strong the Entity's power really is to control the demo gorgon reinforcing  how the survivors are hopelessly trapped in a never ending cycle of pain. P.S  I made a Reddit account for this lol
---
Lore went out the window with the absurd novelty cosmetics we have now lol.  Noone takes it seriously anymore.  I don't want Stranger Things either but that has nothing to do with the quality of the show and everything to do with me being bored shitless of licensed characters.  More original killers please.
---
Two ways to fix this imo
---
1.  Lower the percentages
---
2. Don‚Äôt have it get rid of exit lights
---
Otherwise this perk would be way too strong
---
When you failed a skill check on a generator, whilst in the dream world, it would spray blood.
---
The generator bleeding used to mean you escaped the dream world by failing a skill check.
---
The real trick is to let these guys bring you on chases as long as someone is downed or on hook
---
oh i dont even remember that.
---
They are the same, both ruin the game and has to be fixed asap, they have 0 difference.
---
Does this add to the discussion? No. You can leave.
---
What audio said. It basically shuts down the best loops in the game. BBQ is good, but not always the best for killers without map pressure like clown, and whispers is honestly not very good at all. The massive range and lack of accuracy make it more of a time waster/distraction, though I know some people can use it very effectively.
---
You husband now
---
I would hope so.
---
Hey it has 2 comments now
---
If they added Negan as a killer and his ability was to infect the survivors with the walker virus and the survivors would turn into really slow zombies that would be amazing
---
Honestly, I love watching Moris, but when I'm playing Dwight with Dwight's perks, I'm terrified
---
I found the hatch etc etc.
---
he‚Äôs litterally too old for this shit
---
Screaming Girl, Spectral Girl, Speedy Boi.
---
I knew I recognized that style from somewhere! Dude! Your style is amazing and this art just confirms it again. I love Meg's face and how she looks so happy and I absolutely LOVE how vibrant this looks (mainly the totem). Great work!
---
If by "realistic" you mean "hilariously inflated" then yes.
---
Prestige II spirit‚Äôs hands looks so good in first person. That‚Äôs what i‚Äôm going for now.
---
So the killer should stop a lobby mid game. What a fucking genius you are!
---
Bill is coming out with the mid chapter patch. So next week? I think. Then you get the holsters and the best Claud hair in the game!
---
They are from horror movies?
---
Well, considering the "fanart" of Leatherface and Michael, there could be a different reason.
---
Have you tried getting adept Laurie? It's not easy at all.
---
Favorite in looks, or favorite in gameplay?
---
No problem.
---
Laurie was stuck in place in the video because of a glitch or something.
---
Lol yeah, that one is silly, but then again, I get called a camper when i walk away from the hook and hear someone run past me, so of course I'm gonna check.
---
&gt;why I should prioritize their enjoyment before mine.
---
I... no
---
I‚Äôm rank 15. It was easy
---
Ooh I like micheal as Well he is great but I realy hate ghostface and Leatherface is okey I quess
---
How did we not get a map with ghostface anyway?? or a survivor? there‚Äôs like...4 movies worth of source material
---
Favorite to play with
---
and yet it so rarely is. something the tough guys on this board never seem to acknowledge, i've noticed. at this point, their posts that ridicule camping have begun to resemble the Navy Seal copypasta.
---
It could be because of the doctor. If I recall correctly, you can hear the whispers while you're in madness tier 3
---
It certainly exists! 
---
No teabagging 
---
No emoting at the killer
---
No flashlight clicking
---
No blinding at pallets
---
Leave the exit gate immediately 
---
Do not loop around a pallet more than once or you are exploiting 
---
If the killer is chasing someone, take your time on gens otherwise you are genrushing
---
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more. Since these things are all allowed in the game, any complaints about it are coming from said rule book. Same as camping and tunneling in the survivor rule book for killers. Both sides do this.
---
I dont defend it? I just dont fucking think it should be prioritised over DCing. Plus Mori spam looks funny af most times, unless the killer is a twat waffle and does it more than a few times. Then they are just toxic, move on with it. DCing is way above that in priority
---
Exactly, I‚Äôm a huge Slasher fan and I love all those characters including Freddy. But I don‚Äôt play Freddy much.
---
Make that 3
---
That's a hard question. I think I'll go with...I might go with Trapper. Right now he's my favorite to play. I play most of the killers on a daily basis.
---
You ever play old school Sierra games like So You Want to Be a Hero? Your art style reminds me a lot of theirs, if higher Rez. Either way fantastic stuff!
---
If you tunnel then you're a garbage killer. I'm a killer main. I dont ever tunnel, and I consistently get 4ks. Tunneling makes it easier, which in turn means you dont want to challenge yourself, and your never gonna get better from that trash place you're in. And besides, we play this game for fun. I play survivor a lot, and I hate getting tunneled. It would be very hypocritical to complain about tunneling while I would tunnel myself. Everyone has more fun when the killer doesnt tunnel, but you just want an easy way to get kills and then you say you're good at this game. Shame on you.
---
It‚Äôs okay, I don‚Äôt want him to end up right back where he started
---
New Freddy is amazing!
---
Lol play survivor and you‚Äôll learn how killers can be the same.
---
There‚Äôs shitty people on either side and I can say as a solo player more often than not my teammates aren‚Äôt toxic.
---
Killers may assume SWF or they had a bad game earlier and take it out on randoms.
---
Right now wraith, Ghostface, and Meyers. Wraith was my original main but recently got Myers and Ghostface and I‚Äôm really enjoying them.
---
Here's a 4
---
Only applies to PC lml
---
To be fair The Game can have some really good totem placement and messes with Small Game because it‚Äôs two floors.
---
Dwight maybe the one survivor needs to save from basement
---
I'll look into those- thanks for the suggestion! And thank you!
---
Which perks are better than BBQ?
---
I think Ace fits a lot better since he's a gambler like Nick.
---
I like wraith a lot as Well but I just can‚Äôt play ghostface.
---
This is awesome
---
It's also possible that the killer can't slug in certain circumstances because there aren't enough gens completed to be able to find it before the second last Survivor is sacrificed.
---
Very nice
---
Trapper. The only change I wish he'd get is the ability to rearm traps without having to pick them up. That way you don't have to awkwardly set one down if you're carrying your limit.
---
If the killer plays a clean game don't bm at the exit gates if you escape.  Show gratitude for getting one of the few killers that doesn't resort to camps and tunnels.
---
You are a basement camper and use their sneaky ability and or insidious and the killers one shot abilities?  No?
---
Mines doc
---
Don't worry it happens to everyone at least once.
---
Rochelle is a legend who never deserved the hate she got
---
I'm really digging that trapper design, it looks amazing keep up the good work OP!
---
Myers, Spirit, and Ghostface in that order.
---
I‚Äôm relatively new to the killer side of dbdl and I know legion was a big problem and kind of a touchy subject, but I‚Äôve recently started playing him and wanted to know if any sort of changes hand been announced for him
---
Sounds pretty angry to me
---
I laughed way too hard at this LMAO
---
Stray wolf is just another OchiDO like channel
---
Well I feel like we sidetracked here. Killer triggers the endgame collapse when they close the hatch. But yeah getting the hatch is just rng, not sided either way.
---
I actually had a long good laugh from this
---
I hate that I have to run Ruin every single game as Wraith. I'd love to play around with different builds that don't use Ruin, but then I'd get gen rushed every time. Really limits what builds you can make.
---
I never noticed that either lol.
---
I originally thought the reason I was so super low feeling is due to ping but I'm starting to think it's a problem with the control. Because whenever I press down on it it goes back to normal, idk how long ago this happened but I'm pretty positive this is the reason.
---
Imagine if he had NOEP too...
---
I know right, at least give Julie a skin that doesn't make her look exactly like Frank but with a smaller frame
---
I'm usually not a fan of art posts on here but this is really cool and original. I feel like you captured the essence of that DBD moment.
---
Completing gens are good for the reminder of survivors but almost never do anything to the poor guy getting camped.
---
I just can't aim his tonics good enough to make him worth playing lol
---
Oh God every single time I try to go hard while playing The Shape I get a message saying "EZ" stupid kids.
---
So painfully true.  I'll be screaming at randos not to unhook me and then I'm caught again.  üòí
---
Here's a downvote.
---
What are the chances of getting banned for using them?
---
Wish I had enough to give this the top award... this is amazing.
---
I like running sloppy butcher, death clutch( the one that makes you carry more) and whispers. I think play with you food is good to use if you aren‚Äôt winning a ton of chases
---
Dbd cosplayers are so underrated‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
spirit is easily one of the best killers, especially with add-ons like prayer beads. it‚Äôll take time to get used to her ability tho
---
This would actually be cool.
---
It should make them naked for 60 seconds...
---
Tbh no blinding at pallets is a good rule. You are only wasting your time, any killer with ears can follow you even while blinded and you'll get hit because you didn't use the pallet break animation to gather distance.
---
It‚Äôs like Nurse. They take skill to play but once you learn them survivors have very little counterplay.
---
Spirit
---
As a strong looper who can keep a killer busy for two people to do five gens (WITH the help of pallets) I would rather someone who DC‚Äôs as soon as they get downed. On certain maps it‚Äôs quite easy to do a 3 man game if you conserve the pallets as best as you can especially for end/late game.
---
We don‚Äôt need normie teenage girls in the game. 
---
Agreed.
---
Could you send me an invite?
---
I remember this post
---
‚ÄúSo uhhhh, which of you assholes farmed me off hook again?‚Äù
---
I made this not as a complaint, but as a way to poke fun at how my irl friends are when they face off a mediocre killer. If you‚Äôre over rank 16, you‚Äôll be fine. Nobody really facecamps anymore.
---
I can agree with that point!
---
NOED is balanced. Cleansing all 5 dulls keeps it from going off altogether. It's all of the survivors fault if they don't cleanse all 5 dulls. It doesn't need any changes
---
Yea. This is my 69th game. Still haven‚Äôt gotten it
---
There are still a few loop spots that are map dependant and disproportionately strong compared to the rest of the loops in the game, with no real counterplay/mindgame ability.  The good windows in groaning storehouse, ironworks and suffocation pit are all much stronger than windows on basically any other map and pretty much just require brute forcing it as killer. Sure, it's not infinite and you will eventually get the hit/down so I wouldn't necessarily go as far to say that they're broken, but it takes a large amount of time for something that's so mindless for both sides.
---
exactly lmfao, like i don't have a problem it's an instadown perk but the fact you get the extra movement speed annoys me, basically bloodlust
---
why are his perk icons a different colour?
---
What about my response do you not understand? Utter ignorance at its finest
---
Well escaping without using the whole item gives the full item back. So once you get a bunch you can pretty much always have one if you got for them in the bloodweb
---
There's gonna be a lot of dead Claudettes.
---
if you can push through the bullying, it only makes you stronger
---
is that even a question
---
What the heck is stranger things?
---
Then on top of Bloodlust it‚Äôs the nuts lol.
---
feelsbad
---
Watch youtube videos.
---
I'll ready up and tab out, start my video and put my cursor on the dbd tab so i can see what's happening in the game (check offerings and such). When i see the little red circle on the top of the loading screen i hit space and then alt tab and am seeing the camera swoop to find my ruin. Not a second of down time in there.
---
aparently im a wall hacking legion because i knew where the last injured guy is,  clearly it had nothing to do with BBQ and chilli and nurses calling combined
---
A killer who is going around murdering people feels like some light in his eyes is toxic? lmao.
---
its actually hard if ur playing solo cleanse all 5 totems... so not viable at high ranks
---
Survive with friends.  
---
In my opinion, maps aren't super useful but basically they'll let you know where gens are if you ran past some while in a chase or something and can't remember the locations. But the real trick to them is that seeing gens and stuff with a map equipped gives you points for "marking" it, so some survivors take them just for extra bp
---
Yeah I'm pretty new lmao
---
Yea, bc my response says I never play survivor.
---
welp... then if the increase MMS doesnt apply... do u like these changes?
---
Why are you chasing someone for five minutes? They are clearly better at the chase game than you, go for a weaker target.
---
Underrated thread
---
He... Starts flying???? I don't get it
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ lmao
---
I love when they lagswitch and everybody loses connection so they get their items the bps and their ranks lol
---
I once got hatemail because I was apparently laggy as trapper and kept ‚Äúteleporting‚Äù and got accused of hacking. This was on ps4 with an ethernet, mind you.
---
Noob3???
---
Face away from the other interactable object most of the time. Sometimes that can suck like if you know a survivor is nearby trying to get a flashlight save, but otherwise just facing away from the window will work fine. Some survivors might try to wiggle around near windows to make you vault by accident
---
I just cleansed all 5 dulls this game I just played. It's easy to look for dulls if it's not The Game or Lerys.
---
Jane main: I would not be loving, having or featuring the idea of saving someone from the basement. 
---
Meanwhile Laurie, Bill, David and Tapp just want to get it over with.
---
will you add new game modes? i would like too see a 2 killer vs 8 survivor with 10 more or less gens
---
oh ok thanks
---
thanks i love it
---
When will you ever finish it?
---
It seemed like scratched mirror meyers, so I think it‚Äôs not very justified.
---
Yep you got the reference
---
yes
---
That billy looks like from a summer event or something like that
---
wait wait if you don't prestige do they keep coming if you played while they were available? That's cool.
---
In-co-her-ent
---
They're survivors they are all supposed to be weak targets. Why does this person just completely ignore gens and hiding or doing any surviving at all and instead just holds the shift button down and abuses fucked up mechanics and perks. The game is garbage. I would come back if they removed all perks and addons.
---
the associated killer is Faith/Destiny
---
I dont know. It looked ez but damn
---
You just got outplayed bud. gg ez
---
If the demogorgon would fit great in this game, anything off the Taco Bell menu would fit great in this game because it kills my asshole uwu
---
Clearly.
---
The only way to fix it is to leave the lobby and make a new one.
---
The devs have said that they expect for both the fix for this and persistent SWF parties to be implemented once dedicated servers come out in 1.5 months.
---
Survivors are scum.
---
Thank you Kanye very cool
---
I'm so glad survivors won't be able to pull bullshit like not moving when Freddy's putting them to sleep while they're healing or doing a gen or some crap.
---
If the killer is new to the game, they usually only facecamp because they don't know how to effectively play the game. Being an asshole doesn't teach them that. Beyond that, playing the game a certain way does not warrant harassment or abuse. Do not be toxic towards people
---
So you haven‚Äôt got a proper response to anyone disagreeing with you. Cool.
---
reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/itMNDUXZbtk?t=118)
---
Because those are lower tier killers and salty survivors cannot fathom the fact they lost to a "bad" killer
---
The blind takes a few seconds if they look away there is no effect but if you blind while they're picking someone up there is a certain timing
---
no, but they stay in your inventory, and if you have a bloodweb back from when they were a thing, they persist until you complete that bloodweb
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ce4aat/come_by_this_via_the_facebook_group/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I swear I've had way more disconnects as Freddy than any other killer. I think because survivors buy into the "Freddy = EZ WIN" mentality (Which I disagree, Old Freddy had his shortcomings but with the right mindset, build, and playstyle he could become a real monstrosity.) only to DC out of shame.
---
One of my favorite builds (Besides the one punch build, STBFL, PWYF, M&amp;A, Rancor. Ignore obsession all game, instagib at end) was Dying Light with a Shroud of Separation/Mori and black box. Obsession starts asleep, sees the Dying Light notification and secret offering, and usually DC, proccing Dying Light and giving you the joys of slow gens, as well as turning a match into a 3v1 with 5 gens.
---
What's the point, I'm not changing anyone's mind, like I said, it's my opinion, I don't need to rebuttal you, it's not a debate clearly, you replied to it, I don't owe anyone a response, thank you.
---
And ruin
---
I‚Äôve got the same rule with the last survivor UNLESS their gameplay seems toxic in any way. 
---
I can‚Äôt level up Myers enough to get the good add ons and the only reason I use him is if his daily comes up and I can‚Äôt trash it. I‚Äôm a plague main so...
---
Wrong, you stay on the hook and buy time for your team to do gens.
---
Just because you main a side doesn't mean you can't play the other side tf? I play killer because I don't like relying on other people and most killers are annoying. Doesn't mean I don't play survivor for dailies and when my friends invite me for a few rounds.
---
i strongly recommend you play a KYF (Kill Your Friends) match to get a better understanding of how the flashlights work. your aim must be precise, and depending on the flashlight and the add-ons, you may have to be close.
---
No because death is not an escape
---
if the killer looks up you can't blind them, also if you blind them before they finish picking up the survivor it will blind them but won't make them drop the survivor
---
They can still get blinded if the survivor is already on their shoulders though, right?
---
They'll think its funny too because they know they suck.
---
Whereas, a lot of people in the high ranks think they're good but actually suck, so they'll take offense.
---
you act like the memes have been different ever
---
Love this style. Nice job.
---
Damn that's as evil as letting a survivor crawl to the hatch and then close it in their face
---
Pretty much, I can't even equip a flashlight without killers dodging or bringing a mori.
---
What you mean?
---
Why you gotta do my man ghostface like that
---
Tbh idc about a story line i would buy a stranger things cosmetic lol
---
it‚Äôs posts like this that make this sub so good
---
Survivors are trash. Nobody cares.
---
Tunneled vision
---
Thanks for the information
---
man the menu honestly looked better back then now it's bland
---
No problem
---
Certainly looks like it from here darlin üôÇ Can't wait to see the finished product.
---
It was impossible to win games against Blade-stacking. It was impossible to win chases against a moonwalking Legion. It is not impossible to win chases or games against SB-exploiting survivors.
---
One is something frustrating and overly powerful, the other is something downright gamebreaking. There is a difference. It is true that both should never have been a thing and be fixed as soon as possible. Moonwalking Legion was in the game for almost half a year, mind you.
---
I play killers for dailies all the time and I 3k and 4k no problem, I get more of a rush out of survivor but I'm more 50/40. Sick assumption though.
---
I mean people don't just install the game the first  time and know everything there is and exactly how to play. It's in the game for a reason, to be used. If you don't like it moan to the Devs.
---
That‚Äôs called swf but don‚Äôt worry when he is actually playing against his own level killers he is going to be the most boosted player lol.
---
Do you take suggestions?
---
Try standing behind them while repairing a gen
---
Those killers don't give a shit about points you do know that right. They are there to grief and make others angry to fill the void they have from daddy leaving their whore mothers.
---
Do this but body block a survivor in a corner until they eventually die to end game collapse
---
I don't get it
---
Hey girl, you a claudette? Because you disappear everytime i approach you
---
Oh come on! They can read this!
---
There's a drunk sheriff, a paranoid mom, a "redeemed" villain kid, an evil scientist man, and several high schoolers who are now over the age of 18. There are plenty of worthy adult characters they could easily add, even more than I can probably think of at the moment.
---
I get it if you don't like the show but it sounds like you're grasping at anything to validate your opinions.
---
Lmao some survivor main always gets tilted by these. Hey dummy, you do realize there's atleast 10 survivor player for every 1 killer. So Yea, you faggots do act like cock sucking shits more often than killers.
---
but I want my flashlight

---
Change it to a shotgun, design it after Ash's and boom profit
---
Fits lore wise too then
---
You can find killer's masks and stuff with a simple Google search as far as I'm aware
---
So which one of you stole my med kit when I was franklin demised
---
"Why?"
---
Cuz whoever stole it, is gonna fucking die
---
Yup.
---
Imagine thinking you might be able to dodge his attack, but then your arm is mangled, and you can‚Äôt even crawl away before being stabbed in the tendon and being dragged away before being gutted to death.
---
Exactly, I used to chuckle whenever I had a nurse game when i first started playing because it meant a free win. But boy oh boy did that change once i hit red ranks
---
You said something about not being a 6'2 white guy who can crouch behind boxes, obv this led me to believe you meant the kids who are arguably the main characters. They already have smaller women, big guys, young teenager types, etc that's why I was sure that's what you meant. 
---
For the record, I don't need to "validate" my opinions because that's just what they are: opinions.
---
exactly, it's really not fun to play against.
---
Hag has the scariest mori by far because the survivor is still alive and wiggling until it‚Äôs over.
---
It takes me 20 minutes to get into a lobby half the time and then I experience d/c half the time
---
Rank 10 Meg's best cosplay
---
Thanks man!
---
I think you're confusing me with someone else lol
---
All the god damn time
---
Dose anyone else laugh when they see Claudette's toolbox/med kit sticking out from behind a half ass hiding spot.
---
To be honest with amount of points you get for stunning, if I manage to stun killer 2 or 3 times after doing some gens I already consider the game "won", as in I'm satisified with results. 
---
Maybe I'm weird, but I don't really care much about surviving, besides the big point gain ofc.
---
You will now be forced to run, the meg can reach the speed peak of 69 milles hours, good luck
---
Yeah. Her counter play is limited.
---
P3 Claudette? Sounds like normal behavior to me
---
bruh it basically survivor noed
---
Isn‚Äôt this just Friday the 13th?
---
A killer that could set up beehives around the map would be cool imo
---
How so? Would you like to explain or just keep stating that it's limited? Prayer Beads Spirit is insanely strong, spine chill and tapping generators is a good counter to it. Iron will, which is useful against every killer, is a good strategy to  avoid her hearing you mid haunting.
---
Legion got reworked and is a solid mid tier killer now. You were probably watching a video of Legion before the rework. Old Legion was either one of the weakest killers in the game if you actually played legit, or if you exploited Deep Wounds with Frank‚Äôs Mixtape then he was extremely strong with no counterplay.
---
Is this only a rumor?  What's next, a bear?
---
If we're bringing rank into this, I've been to rank 1 as Freddy more than once. Dunno if that changes anything.
---
She has to obey the laws of pallets and window vaults, her mindgames can easily backfire. A good spirit is a pain, because they took the time to practice becoming a pain.
---
Then they will all go to billy
---
Thanks, and what about the bleedout conditions? I couldn't find any info on wikis
---
Poor piggy ;( Oink.
---
No, but they can hear the bones rattling if they are close enough. The only time they would be notified is if they are using Thrill of the Hunt (you will know if they are.)
---
People in red spam Haddonfield offerings, Billy would get smoked.
---
He has noed
---
I mainly play Kate as a survivor but I occasionally play killer as Amanda. I also think that face camping when you‚Äôre swarmed by players is a perfectly reasonable course of action- even as someone who‚Äôs been hooked in this situation. What‚Äôre they supposed to do? Just let you go so you don‚Äôt cry about dying? 
---
People need to just let the other side play however they want and stop crying about either side being toxic because at the end of the day who the fuck do you think you are to tell someone else how to play *their* game.
---
K.
---
Exactly what I was thinking when it comes to the toxic survivors. I will hunt them down if they are tea bagging after a stun. No remorse for that survivor lol.  And when I play as a survivor I always hope I don‚Äôt have to face the plague!
---
No. Iri Button just plays a standard terror radius map wide. UP only affects your own immediate terror radius.
---
That‚Äôs kinda rediculous
---
True but billys really the only killer they could go to
---
Doc‚Äôs most viable build is 3 gen. Doc‚Äôs not very viable at rank 1 because random skillchecks do basically nothing against good survivors, his anti loop with his shock is inconsistent at best, and the amount of time it takes to get people into madness 3 is disproportionate to how easy it is to snap out of it. Doc‚Äôs game stall basically only works if Doc stalls himself (ie shocking people instead of hitting them).
---
However his 3 gen build can lead to disgusting games that are unwinnable for survivors. Basically throw on Distressing/Unnerving/Overcharge/whatever the fuck 4th perk you want, and defend the 3 closest gens from the beginning til the end of the match. Only problem with this build is that it‚Äôs fucking boring (ESPECIALLY for the survivors) and also all of your games will last like 30 minutes. Good survivors will know that you won‚Äôt leave your 3 gens so whenever they‚Äôre in danger they‚Äôll run to the other side of the map. If you chase them you lose, if you don‚Äôt chase them they heal up and you rinse and repeat patrolling your 3 gens for 3 hours.
---
I always stay on the hook. If the killer facecamps w.e my team gets a better shot and he gets a shittier score. Dcing only benefits the killer and rage quitters are too selfish and stupid to realise it. Go on your phone. Waste his time. Tap a button. Waste his time. Congrats you ruined the killers game as he ruined yours. You made 3 others happy.
---
That doesn't have anything to do with it, I was just sharing a similar experience having plenty of fun with an ability rather than by killing, that's what games are about anyway, just as long as you have fun
---
I should mention something here.
---
The amount of detail that went into the animation is craaazy.
---
Look at the mori at 0.25x speed on YT, and keep looking at the bkade, it's pretty amazing.
---
Easily my favorite mori in the game.
---
Legit, my ears are dumb enough to somehow think they're GENERATOR SOUNDS.
---
Also, if you're salty about prayer beads. Fine, we can all agree it and omegablink nurse have to go. But stop trying to ruin one of the most interesting ability characters killers have. Might as well just throw shit as clown and huntress.
---
I just do one. Toxic people will do many of them. You can also relinquish any item you are holding.
---
There is a very small chance of that happening you got lucky
---
Are the adept killer achievements fixed yet? I got a ruthless killer but still got the achievement, but I double pipped as well, so I‚Äôm curious if they made it easier or if I just have to double pip
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I meant tru3ta1ent, not OhTofu. OhTofu is funny too. Mixed up the names.
---
A gun would be nice if it could stun the killer, but not kill him
---
Also, why should the survivor hold all the cards in your argument? As the killer, aren't they theoretically supposed to be the power role. If it's already a 4v1 and I'm supposed to let survivors have all the information. I lose when I decide to play the role.
---
"Blacklist noob"
---
Me too fam
---
I wish I'd have recorded it now for proof it was on haddonfield against ghostface, it has to have been a bug as most the people I played with were also new.
---
I know you're closed minded and wouldn't bother taking anything I wrote into account. But if I atleast get more people talking about her than that means I've atleast got people talking about balance instead of "oh some people enjoy it".
---
This wasn't meant for you, it was meant for open minded people. You're still allowed to have an opinion as am I. Have a nice day :)
---
No it's just a really lucky thing to happen
---
Thank you!
---
Those eyes make worth sacrificing for the unhook and save of Meg. &lt;3
---
I would buy that print! That is some serious high quality work. I love your use of colour and her mischievous facial expression.
---
Because most killers aren‚Äôt the power role so when a killer is the power role,people think they‚Äôre OP.
---
Well, I see you're one of those people, who ends debates with personal attacks.
---
Fun.
---
She's an annoying killer to play against every game. This is a true statement. However, after 50 games of just looping.... looping........ looping, you wouldn't agree that a character that adds something different at least spices the game up for people who do that shit all day.
---
It doesn‚Äôt
---
4% chance each time
---
I'm not sure how they could even change his power at this point. He's one of the only killers who has absolutely nothing in terms of killing power. He can almost guarantee the first hit but unless the survivor messes up a ton, he'll usually get fudged over by long window loops. 
---
Even Wraith has windstorm, Freddy has traps/fake pallets, and Pig has a situational dash mindgame. Legion is the only killer who is currently punished in a chase by using his power.
---
Unfortunately if you buff Legion's power by adding any killing ability or reducing the stun significantly, he ends up mind-numbingly easy to tunnel someone down over the course of a minute or two with.
---
He's fine at mid ranks, but boy does he suffer later on. And SpiritFury/Enduring is just a band-aid that shouldn't be necessary for him to work.
---
Rank 20 Meg: *wastes pallet while I‚Äôm 20 feet away* *tbags*
---
The Pig is getting some skins in the near future. I still think her prestige skins look better than the new ones.
---
You have a 4% chance of unhooking yourself.
---
Just give me my mettle of man replacement
---
Lol my friends and I went against him a couple of weeks ago and didn‚Äôt realise it was him. None of us were playing seriously and were just having a laugh/ fucking around and the dude read into EVERYTHING we did. Literally mind gamed himself thinking we had a big plan to beat him when we were all just playing for fun. 
---
He also complained about SWF and toxicity and had his viewers insulting in chat despite the fact he won quite early on because we weren‚Äôt playing that great. I felt bad for one of my friends who was a fan of his and saw it because Tru3 was being so negative over nothing. Dude takes DBD too seriously, ofc that‚Äôs gonna encourage sniping.
---
I'm not expecting to get a 4k every game, I got a whole map to cover and the person I'm looking for is about 1/248 of that space. Also, they have a ton of mechanics to help them escape. Low tier killers are fun, they are designed to be interesting taking into account the game will probably be a loss unless you've completely mastered that killer. However, most killers revolve around M1, and the ones that don't, are hated without realizing it's the only thing that makes this game not a monotonous mess.
