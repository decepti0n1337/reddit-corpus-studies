I‚Äôd rather him open the gate first.
---
---
---
With regards to overall power and 4K potential,  Huntress and Meyers are seldom complained about - yet Huntress' iridescents one hit down, and Meyers' rare and ultra rare addons are both deadly, including an outright kill. To even get close to their potential, much less Nurse or Billy, you're burning mixtapes faster than Kanye. 
---
Legion isn't overpowered, at all. Simply demands a different playstyle. 
---

---
Honestly, you say it isn't fun, but being endlessly 'looped' while survivors BM is just as boring - so I'm glad Legion exists.

I honestly would dislike a no rank mode but I wouldn‚Äôt mind an offline mod vs bots to try out builds and practice in general
---
Hex: Ruin Is On The Shrine!
---
genrushing is a thing, but it was built into the game and for many killers there is no outplay but ruin which is not good agaisnt half decent survivors
---
tbh, nerf mixtape and stab wounds study into the ground aka. change the whole mechanic of these addons or simply remove them, then tweak base bleed/ sprint mechanic numbers to be stronger (like they did with pig, if you wanted to use her stealth at all you had to have combat straps as addon)
---
and most importantly, remove the no cooldown on hit in frenzy
---
this way you get a killer that has unique power that behaves more or less with the same success rate no matter what addons it has, and you can counterplay him, because it is actually hard to land a hit without lunging while you're at accelerated speed. it's easy right now because you get to swing it like a madman until you fianlly stab something
---
with all these changes add the proposed PTR change that wasn't implemented, that injured survivors start with lower bleedout timer to actually make people heal against legion and you have a great killer
---
but people will still complain because the ACTUAL counterplay to legion, no matter what numbers you give him, mixtape or no mixtape, is to break the chase. everyone is so used to the long chase looping tactic that people have a really hard time adapting to anything new
---
also. I wouldn't call a literal survivor detecting sonar and action block after shock nothing on doctor. the alternate effects are just a cherry on top, and you still get imaginary doctors even with 0 addons, the one dedicated to them just prolongs the duration 
---
What about when they hit you from miles away. Insta dc
---
Is that thanatophobia and ruin?
---
I think legion is fun to play
---
Im pretty new to dbd but I hear that Ruin is pretty good
---
I feel u. I just got the game 2 weeks ago.
---
I took a screenshot of the stats and the salty dude died before me like????
---
Get Ruin if you don't have it already.
---
That's all you need to know. 
---
You will probably experience this more due to the event both sides play sweaty during them. Also, just playing devil's advocate, if your as good as you say you are they may want to just get rid of you to make the match easier. 
---
Ruin is only good perk. Survivor perks are both level 30 perks for Ace and Meg, Thanatophobia sucks.
---
I would play against Legion if this happened
---
If you play killer at all, you need to pick it up. 
---
Get ready for slowing the game down!
---
What rank?
---
Hex: Ruin, Thanatophobia, Quick &amp; Quiet and Open-Handed. 
---
Remove DS as well as NOED. That would be more than fair
---
Is it?
---
I literally just spent all week leveling up Nurse to get Thanataphobia because i thought it was never coming back and then they do this to me? (e_e)
---
Ruin is really good if you want to slow the game down just a lil but
---
Won't change anything but go ahead.
---
Ruin is really good if you want to slow the game down just a lil bit 
---
Alright man take it easy lol. 
---
What the fuck did you bring upon this cursed island 
---
I hate toes.
---
The 4 Perks Are
---
* (Ace) - Open Handed: 
---
Strengthens the potential of you and your team's Aura-reading abilities.
---
Increases Aura reading ranges by 4/6/8 metres.
---
 
---
* (Meg) - Quick &amp; Quiet:
---
You do not make as much noise as others when quickly vaulting over obstacles or hiding in Lockers IconHelp lockers.png.
---
The vault and hide actions' noise detection and audio range is reduced by 100 %.
---
This effect can only be triggered once every 30/25/20 seconds.
---
* (Hag) Hex: Ruin: 
---
A Hex that affects the Survivors' skills at repairing Generators IconHelpLoading generators.png.
---
2/3/4 Survivors are affected by Ruin, which causes the following:
---
Good Skill Checks IconHelp skillChecks.png result in 5 % regression on the Generator
---
Great Skill Checks grant 0 % bonus progression on the Generator.
---
* (Nurse) Thanatophobia:
---
Their courage fades in the face of their undeniable mortality.
---
All Survivors receive penalties to Repair, Healing and Sabotage speeds for each Injured IconHelp injured.png, Dying IconHelp dying.png or hooked Survivor.
---
1 Injured, Dying or hooked Survivor: 4/5/6 % reduced action speed.
---
2 Injured, Dying or hooked Survivors: 7/8/9 % reduced action speed.
---
3 Injured, Dying or hooked Survivors: 10/11/12 % reduced action speed.
---
4 Injured, Dying or hooked Survivors: 13/14/15 % reduced action speed. 
---
Trust me, it's long run is good. Let's say 3 vessels spawn inside of one match. Simple math shows that it's only 9 points, but now you get 12 points stacked onto that. It's only nothing if you do nothing.
---
As if there aren't sweaty 4-man SWF squads at rank 1.
---
Hex Ruin and Thatnophobia ?? Hell yeah !!!
---
Spirit is Japanese my dude.
---
An interesting way to interpret this.
---
I've thought it would be nice that if someone DCs mid-match, it should treat it as if they DCd before it started and drop a gen. Maybe take one of the least finished gens out instantly and call it finished. I had a match where someone DC right after the camera looked around us. Then 5 seconds later I saw a Nea running to a vessel and the killer was heading right to her and right before she got it she DCd too. Like wow really? And we still have 5 gens to do? Making it 3 at this point would only be fair...
---
That is where you went wrong she is garbage on console I've been told op on PC that one I have seen for myself
---

Now you can buy it for a bunch of blood points 
---
Other guy in this thread said they wiped everything.  All his legit stuff too.  Full reset.  
---
Shouldn't you be upvoting reposts and garbage memes little buddy?
---
Meanwhile, I'll admit I'm not that good at the game as survivor, but I'll hit rank 1 every month literally without even trying to. I don't want to rank up that high, but I do, anyway. The devs really need to fix the ranking system in this game.
---
2018 omegalul
---
When will the entity bless us with bbq
---
Yeah I still don't dc. If they hit you from miles away it's usually a connection issue which is evident from the lobby with your ping beside the ready indicator. 
---
FUCK and I just bought the hag... 
---
Game 6. 1 kill. 15k points. Black pip. Nonstop taunting in game. At the end they just left. 
---
Yes. It‚Äôs more points for killers.
---
*Sees Hex: Ruin* "Oh no"
---
...I mean... he is a pedophile...
---
Seemed like you should have found his totem, sounds like you had tons of time of just staring off at the killer.
---
You don't need to level her up now, plus you got a new killer.
---
That doesn't sound like my boy Fred, he would never do such a thing.
---
I mean, if survivors are wasting time T-bagging then they‚Äôre only wasting their own time. Also I give props to anyone who blinds me, that shit is hard to do on console.
---
Never again. 
---
I... I really hope you‚Äôre joking...
---
I do the same, except I don‚Äôt camp the hook. I always know where the teammates are, and I give them all a hard time to prevent saves.
---
Last event people conplained the grind was too easy and everyone spent the second half not doing event objectives. The points req is fine. Its easy to get a few, and the hardcores can grind for all 9. 
---
God i swear this community with bitch about anything. 
---
I wish the devs would ban the free perks from appearing here. It defeats the purpose imo.
---
Of course I am you psycho he's fictional how would I know him on a personal basis.
---
Jesus Christ I thought Peridots were supposed to be smart.
---
She looks like the girl from DEH who ended up making everything worse and posting &gt;!Connor's suicide note!&lt; online. 
---
I don't know about banning it completely but definitely reduce the chances of them appearing. Last week, a.k.a 30 minutes ago, all 4 perks were free perks, frustrating.
---
We are, we‚Äôre just not good with social cues, and sarcasm doesn‚Äôt translate well online
---
I‚Äôm good but I‚Äôm certainly not a god or anything like some survivors I‚Äôve seen as killer. I think I‚Äôm worthy of some loose camping maybe- but not the shit they‚Äôre doing, like hitting me repeatedly and nodding ‚Äòno‚Äô over and over again ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Never thought od see the day where this title would be muttered.
---
{:/
---
Welp, it's better than last week, but I already have Ruin and I don't feel like I'd ever actually use Thanatophobia. Quick And Quiet is pretty good, but I hardly ever play survivors, let alone dedicating blood points to them, so even if I did buy it at the shrine, I still wouldn't be able to get it on anyone.
---
Huntress Iridescent head is always complained about. Myers isnt because they suck and its better to just run J Myers Memorial with the flower. 
---
&gt;Legion isn't overpowered, at all. Simply demands a different playstyle. 
---
What different playstyle? You cant say stealth because his ability lets him see surviors not in deep wound. Theres no way to play the chase against him either. theres no different playstyle.
---
&gt;Honestly, you say it isn't fun, but **being endlessly 'looped' while survivors BM is just as boring** - so I'm glad Legion exists. 
---
Glad you finally showed your true colors. The only people defending Legion are just mediocre/bad killers who complain about getting looped when they dont run tiles correctly. Even add icing on the cake by assuming every survivor ‚ÄúBMs‚Äù you. Pure victim mentality. Legion is awful game design and isnt fun to play nor play against.
---
Weird that your getting it so frequently normally to have killers frequently BM you it's because you gesture at them or t-bag etc. As I said probably just the event. 
---
then the host obviously disconnected. I understand that you'd think it'd be something wrong with a game but it's just the killer being irritating
---
No it happens to me as the killer as well.
---
sticc
---
My dumbass friend is new to the game he just combined the highest rarity items, without understanding how they work. 
---
This actually happened,  that‚Äôs not the picture from when he did that but you can bet your ass we never let him hear the end of this idiotic move.  
---
I don‚Äôt care about karma not even 100% how it works check out my profile I‚Äôve never really used reddit boi
---
I would love hitboxes to be that good, that looks so much more fun
---
Nurse is the exact same though, just takes significantly more skill from both sides so it can feel a little bullshit at times.
---
I don't think that Frank's Mix Tape is honestly *that* much of a problem but I do think Stab Wound Study hinges entirely on exploits and needs some serious rebalancing. But other than that I agree with everything in this reply.
---
And yeah my point when I mentioned Doctor is that he can still increase Survivors' madness and he can still prevent vaults/pallet drops. I think outside of getting the initial hit and starting Deep Wounds Legion's power does practically nothing without addons. Add in the fact that they move at 110% and they're by far the worst killer when played without addons.
---
Yeah thats just pure salt. Doc sucks ass without add ons to add afflictions to madness and to make the beam longer. Hes also awful to play on console because the survivor just has to turn erracticly and they‚Äôll do an ‚Äúepic 360‚Äù lmao.
---
??? 
---
Ymean Susie.
---
Some of the jungle gym ones are tucked in, and it took me a while to realize they are behind the barrel.
---
The slats on the walls however, make it less of an issue if it's lit. 
---
He did this, we grilled him for it then he made it again and sent a picture to us and was like ‚Äúlook what I‚Äôm bringing‚Äù in a way of making fun of himself, so I took that picture since I forgot to when he actually used it in a game on the post game screen. 
---
Not a single time :o are you sure you actually got the points? Like if someone dcs as killer itll show me earning points but they are actually the points I earned last game and dont they add up to my total. I hope for you you actually got those event points, thats pretty good value for a straightup dc. I wouldnt mind killers dcing if that were the case :p
---
My friends and i remind him all the time lmao 
---
holy shit looks like i dont need hag anymore
---
Oh shit ok
---
No joke, I think that's me
---
then you're a good friend
---
Thanatophobia is good for Legion. 
---
SB is doodoo, only reason to use it is ever is bc dead hard is buggy 
---
The nea in the back
---
He didn't type too well, that's a given- but disregarding one's opinion due to simple spelling mistakes is pretty silly. The guy has a point, using the term "baby" in DbD is effectively shooting yourself in the foot.
---
r/boneappletea
---
There are better perks
---
You‚Äôd be surprised, it‚Äôs the difference between 19 points a game and 28 points (8 hooks and one lantern which is prolly like average) which is much more manageable, and what would‚Äôve previously been 31 points now becomes 45. (11 hooks and 3 lanterns) 
---
The change actually solves the one big problem I had with killer progression, the issue that the killer relied on everyone putting up an offering to get max points while survivors didn‚Äôt even need an offering to get 45 points. Now, it‚Äôs still harder to earn 45 points if you‚Äôre your the only person to put up an offering but at least it‚Äôs possible and as a trade off for the difficulty you have the possibility to make over 45 depending on how many offerings go up
---
Pretty quick on the blame game. I play both sides, survivor and killer, and I main Huntress. I've ranked to rank one four times. 
---
Incidentally, I am not *bad*. I'm no miracle man. But I can throw some pretty 'the fuck?' hatchets on occasion. 
---
Also, your own bias is in plain view. What's any less boring about playing match after match against survivors running the same meta perks? Oh, look, there's the fourtieth Decisive Strike today! 
---
It's stale, and I invite any killer to shake up the meta. Legion and Spirit included. 
---
Imagine being so upset at getting downvoted that you look through my comment history and downvote/reply to everything dbd related in the past week. You okay dude? 
---
The best is when someone dcs while nurse picks them up and then they slide along behind when she blinks the rest of the game. Shots hilarious. 
---
??? Not at pallets it's not, it takes maybe a handful of lives of practice to nail the blind everytime.
---
tunneling isnt against the rules

This crawwwwl it will not crawwwlll

No, sadly. But you won‚Äôt need to learn it from her when leveling her up.

When killer's mind game is so good you dont even remember how to print screen.

Im not hating against claudette players. But i will ask you if you use urban evasion. And if you do i will leave the lobby. So many people i encounter in rank 1 hide and dont know what gens are and camps pallets. So i just save myself from dealing with that
---
that pre anal uncertainty 
---
Neat. Just when I decided to start playing killers.
---
At least we‚Äôre getting ruin but seriously, where‚Äôs my Chili?
---
It ain‚Äôt happening fam.
---
My connection was fine; the game ended like everyone escaped and it finished.. and wouldn't it say I dced next to perks?
---
Spirits fine and interesting and decisive strike is lame. Legion just breaks the game and makes it not fun to play. The chase is looping or somehow outwitting the killer to not see you, which is not really up to the survivor its up to the killer being blind. Its really ignorant to complain about loops when thats all survivors can reliably do when in chase.
---
Wendigo Huntress?

Props:)

Consoles have built in screenshot function

He is right, you know

I wear aces new cosmetic outfit. Or ill wear the shirt and pants with p3 face. Or ill run his smooth operator pants and a dark red robe. I also will run my pink sweater and pinkish pants when i want to be chased alot. And i just change the head cosmetic to whatever im in the mood for 
---
Ily
---
Stop complaining about these perks. Cleanse totems or take DS in the face. It's not that hard. DS mskes me mad only if it's 4 of them
---
Great.  Now every killer and their mom will use ruin in the next few days.  Equip your small game, guys!
---
When my literal two worlds collide. Take my upvote for your fraj meme
---
Don't see what's so toxic about disagreeing and naming killers that can counter looping. Also no one insulted him or anything he's just being down voted because people disagreed with his statement. Nothing toxic about it.
---
Niles better 
---
If everyone gets everything, nothing is special.
---
Yes, they DO need to monetize everything. They are a business- making money is what they do.

It would be interesting to see these perk inflict Deep Wounds on Survivors.

It is. If you look closely, it says "R1" for the pallet prompt. However, impressive nonetheless.

You can, but after playing on PC and then playing console with friends, it was very clear that hits that *should have hit* did not. Like with nurse on PC, I get a lot of awkward max range hits that look like.. maybe they should not have hit. On console I'll be halfway down their throat and it misses anyway. Either the frame rates are causing it (we're talking 144 down to well below 50) or it's some sort of hit registration bug. The devs mentioned on a stream that their game runs on UE4 Blueprints for the most part, and those tick by frame if I understand correctly. Having the game try to register 60 per second when you're only getting 30 means up to 50% of the ticks aren't being registered properly. I'm not a tech wizard but I have my fair share of coding knowledge and I'm pretty confident it's the frames causing that issue. This clip though, looked pretty clean. LF should have been in the middle of the hallway, idk why he hugged the wall lol
---
When my sister and i play we play as neas and we go ‚Äútwo sisters‚Äù then if another nea joins the lobby we say ‚Äúthree sisters‚Äù and so on, but we say it in a voice as if we‚Äôre summarizing an upcoming thriller movie 
---
While I‚Äôm not a fan of the current event design, you‚Äôre being quite dishonest by putting words in my mouth.
---
Never said I hated doing event objectives. I stated that 36 event points is the maximum for killers if they didn‚Äôt break any lanterns. Perhaps I should have used more neutral gammar, but I never meant disdain for doing event objectives. 
---
Zelda?
---
I play as Kate with this set: ponytail(darker one), prestige top and blue jeans (from US bundle(?)). I love Kate but her cosmetics are huge meh to me, they look all kinda the same and boring. Fengs cosmetics are much more diverse and cute so I am considering swapping to her lul. I just wish I would be able to get her new stuff, but I don‚Äôt play often and I don‚Äôt think I can grind that much.. (I also love her pastel ponytails with mask but I‚Äôm bad at looping so it‚Äôs not for me for sure lul)
---
I think it should be different for each iteration of Legion.
---
NOED AND DS are fine the way they are. 
---
I believe the meta is Hex: Ruin, Whispers, A Nurses Calling and BBQ&amp;Chilli 
---
I personally use Shadowborn, Hex: Ruin, A Nurses Calling and Iron Maiden

yeah, maybe one day i'll get her

Shameless plug? Or edit of her background?
---
Ruin, BBQ, Nurses calling, Whispers is a popular one, but sometimes I swap out whispers for Iron Maiden because that reload time is awesome. (You do burn an entire perk slot on reload if u choose it tho so keep that in mind)

What is the perk at the left?

How dare you insult Freddy.
---
Whats the bonus blood points for the current event? How do I get bps for killers / survivors
---
Except any exposure to high level play will be informative. You for sure get diminishing returns, but that doesn't mean it's "just not true".
---
Your karate analogy is flawed in the extreme, as you can and usually should ABSOLUTELY be watching high level performances and things to learn.
---
Think we'll have to agree to disagree though, which is fine :)
---
This is a lie! Rank One is worth an achievement or Trophy for both Survivor and Killer. Staying at Rank 1 is useless, but getting there once gets you a moderately difficult achievement
---
These were ideas I put together while I was playing. Care to share an alternative to NOED if any come to mind?
---
Should have put sarcasm in my title.
---
That's because you don't seem to have any sort of self awareness lol I imagine you often feel like that.
---
i was also spooked
---
Nope I've learned a lot from him
---
They can pick up an item with no usable charges??? I‚Äôm assuming it cannot be used to blind the killer in that trial right?
---
Would also be better if after they realise who it is, we all split up to avoid 4 deep wounds slowing the game down.
---
Idc how trash they are, they‚Äôre fucking cancerously annoying to play against. I‚Äôm not urban evading around the map for 20 mins bc someone picked a killer that ignores loops
---
Lol yeah I know this post makes me look bad but if I didn‚Äôt honestly think I ws in the right I‚Äôd remove it 
---
Yes lawrd!
---
git gud?
---
Survivors rarely get away after using DS, unless the Killer is not even trying at all
---
And noed is not just to reward "missing Preasure" its also used on alot of Endgame focused builds, and honestly cleansing totems is not hard at all, just memorize the spots,  or use a map/small game if you cant remember them...
---
It's still usable. Imagine it as it has 1 charge, so Franklin's doesnt remove any charges as it only has 1. But it still gets knocked out of their hand
---
ye, that or the shitpost flair *lol*

Same with stake out. There‚Äôs always a skill check drought when I have full stacks.

Ooooh... That explains it... Yet im surprised i managed to survive against him
---

---
One of these survivors is not like the others.

Although alot of people already had ruin now everyone is going to use it

try to answer to the rest of my comment instead of trying to be a comedian about this line?

If you can respond, of course
---
Knowing this community, everyone will still be matched together, based on the thumbs down.

I think you believe you're more intelligent than you actually are

That would be amazing.  I have a feeling that making the survivor sided perks work on a disguised killer would break their code though.

Man, seeing you post this after whining about Legion is DELICIOUS.

I mean I really shouldn‚Äôt since you decided to ignore half of my comment but alright, fair I‚Äôll discuss.
---
DS without enduring is a 2 second stun, any decent survivor can find a loop especially since they were probably downed in a loop already. This waste lots of time, very precious time, for the killer every second counts and can be the difference between a kill or not.
---
For NOED, sometimes you just can‚Äôt find all the totems. There are lots of spawns and I don‚Äôt have time to be looking in every hidy hole of the map. Survivors need another objective but totems aren‚Äôt it, they take too much time. By time all 5 totems are cleansed the killer will have a huge advantage in the game, you just wasted at least 1 minute getting totems but in reality you wasted much more time. As I said before small game is unreliable, it doesn‚Äôt tell you where the totems are and in some maps it‚Äôs useless (such as Game). 
---
The nerf to DS is incredible minor but would prevent the potential extra 2 minute chase.
---
The nerf to NOED is huge but I feel it‚Äôs unfair to get one hit with a speed boost which can lead to multiple undeserved kills.
---
Sick idea dude/erina
---
Legion bad*
---
One thing I learned you should do as playing killer is to never give up on a match if your loosing. Things can turn around, and they can turn around FAST.
---
Corn + Claudette + gen sounds = godly combo
---
Hey it's not their fault Susie is so damn cute
---
Man, if only there was some.. Magical skill that would let survivors compete with unbalanced killers like the Nurse, or the Doctor, or Legion.
---
Oh. 
---
Nice
---
a brown toolbox is worth more tham this
---
Didn't even have the sound on and I got spooked
---
I do that often little bitch boy
---
Don‚Äôt forget frank
---
I agree
---
Not necessarily, there's still that weird segment of the population who use a DS4 on PC with whatever app it is that shows PS prompts instead of Xbox.

he is a licensed killer because he's the yeti from star wars

---
if you make michael myers cry you're a bad person
---
Ah, alright. That‚Äôs kind of a shame, tbh.
---
A 2 Second stun is just barely more than destroying a pallet that hit your head or being blinded by a Flashlight, as long as the Killer and Survivor are about equally skilled, that wont Change all that much, sure sometimes it does, but thats okay...you shouldnt nerf a perk to the point where it doesnt even have a good Chance at changing the outcome of a chase.
---
As for Noed, you said survivors need a second objective, but not totems? Why? They have reliable spawn Points and dont Take that long to cleanse and if you dont find all? 
---
Same as for DS, You arent supposed to always counter it, sometimes you have to leave someone behind because of that or sometimes you get killed because of that, but thats just how it is.
---
And why getting Kills with NoEd is not deserved is just beyond me. Wouldnt that mean that escapes with adrenaline arent deserved either?
---
The point is not surviving or them being ‚ÄúOP‚Äù. Its not fun to face them because they break chase mechanics
---
pebble time
---
Thank you so very much! 
---
I know, how dare Tofu play with his wife. That's fucking horrible, isn't it?  
---
Y'all are so fucking dumb. 
---
i think you got that reddit bug where it posts your reply 3 times
---
Viability/meta aside, as a killer can you stack multiple regression perks? Obviously it would be a hindrance to chasing/tracking ability etc. 
---
For example could someone potentially run Hex:Ruin, Dying Light, and something like Thanataphobia and have all those regression penalties stack on the survivors? 
---
Wow, Tofu is such an asshole for playing video games with his wife. What a fucking piece of shit that guy is.

---
i like using it, even if its just a couple seconds faster, it can still make  a big difference, every second counts.
---
&gt;play red ranks and not enjoy the game 
---
&gt;play green to purple and enough the game again
---
Hmm
---
I assume you hop off the hook and then it breaks. Deliverance just changes your hook escape attempt chance stat to 100%, so the game still considers it escaping from the hook [yourself].
---
Believe it or not...they did.
---
Why. Ever.
---
I heard that originally people found Nea's name and some things relating to her datamined in the files before a new chapter was out, so people were saying she was going to be the new killer, since dbd would probably add a killer's name before they add a survivor's, right? But no the chapter was announced and the killer was the nurse and nea was just there lol.
---

---
I just got done streaming some killer and my frames were the worst they‚Äôve been in a long time. I must have used up the games playability in this moment.  
---
*LONG ASS COMMENT WARNING*
---
TL;DR - Just be awesome to one another &amp; have you some fun.
---
I'm only a couple months into playing, and I've seen a definite increase of DCs &amp; suicides during the event, which is a bit frustrating; at the same time I've also seen *killers* putting their interests aside by helping *survivors* grab lanterns, lead them to gens, and even throwing the last *survivors* on hatches. The community has been trying to balance things out; not to say if you're a *killer* that you should feel obligated to change your play style &amp; help *survivors* at all, it's not the point of the game (quite the opposite). I think playing the game &amp; being respectful to *killers*, *survivors*, and *teammates* are tantamount to everyone enjoying events, challenges, and the game overall.
---
Imho, it's really important to remember that you're playing a game - it's _supposed_ to be enjoyable, and sometimes a good mindset goes a long way. Not having fun anymore? Stay respectful, breathe, put the sticks down (or step away from the keys) after the match, and come back later. Playing the game respectfully and still getting BM'd all over (intentional shat on pun)? Just laugh it off if you can, you're in control of your emotions.
---
I was a *killer* main before the event and remember one game when I was learning how to Huntress and got decimated by a group. Looped, palleted, clicked, and teabagged throughout; at the end 3 Survivors stayed at the gate to continually teabag and click flashlights. I just smiled and figure I'd practice some throw skills. Ended up landing two throws on one, got blinded by the second, and swung blindly landing hits on second &amp; third. Result, hung all three in the basement because they tried to body block for one another as each were getting downed or hooked. When the endgame chat loaded up, I  typed in: "GG, y'all know how to make a n00b work for it" (or something to that effect)" fully expecting some snark. First reply: "Ayyyyyyy, that was actually funny!" They ended up being really nice, "gg'd" at the end, and I got some killer points (see what I did there?) for keeping calm and having as much fun I'd allow myself to have. The game helped me decompress after some hard days a few weeks back after a car wreak, and I keep playing because it's fun for me.
---
Not trying to lecture anyone, hell I'm nowhere near the most level headed person I know, but I want to have fun. That's why I queue up, and run on load. Just an opinion from someone who loves the game, and tries to see the best out of the community.
---
100% Agree with you, sometimes leaving a fellow survivor behind is the best choice
---
No refund out my store now
---
This should be higher up! Lol
---
It wouldn't be such a pain to play against Legion if he wasn't guaranteed to down me eventually regardless of how good I play because the killers ability literally cannot be outplayed.
---
This just makes me want to play Legion more
---
Crawling, In the End, Numb, and as a bonus, Bring Me to Life. 
---
(Different band, but whatever)
---
Or Creeping in my Soul. 
---
I can understand why that would make Legion to be annoying as a killer main. Tbh I guess I haven't experienced that high level of play or issues yet (I believe I'm currently rank 8?) But I feel the same way with other killers and some of their stuff as well. Stuff like Iridescent Head+Infantry Belt Huntress, the new silent Spirit build, Insta-Down Bear Traps, and even just a random yeet from a Hillbilly downing you from Wakanda never really felt good to me either as a Survivor, because of the 'Just Wins' factor, but I feel it more with Insta-Downs then losing a chase.
---
But I'm admittedly awful with chases, so unless I get a stun in I'm probably not getting away. I don't usually run exhaustion perks.
---
Wouldn't be shocked if it's a super salty person who's trying to make survivors feel what they have had to feel when they DC to avoid the hook and deny a BBQ stack. Those BP losses suck, and if someone's cranky and toxic, they may see this as a chance to lash out
---
I feel it DS can do change the course of a game if the survivor gets that extra minute. That extra minute is a lot of time gone from the killer or the whole chase could be meaningless if the survivor gets away. If DS is used on a survivor who can‚Äôt loop super well then yeah it won‚Äôt change much, but they aren‚Äôt the people who run DS. 
---
For the totems is a combination of they don‚Äôt even have to be done to get out and me wanting more from an objective. What I count as an objective is something that has to be done to get out
---
Anyways, you do bring good and valid points, but it‚Äôs about 10 here so I‚Äôm going to go to sleep. If you want to talk more I can in 8ish hours.
---
Only issue is queue times. There are a million better ways than what we have now and the devs know this but the playerbase is too small to do something like this without queue times spiking hard. 
---
Oi. I'm not sure if this counts as a complaint or not, but does anyone have advice for feeling better after a bad game?
---
The correct term is ‚Äúsauce‚Äù
---
That's some Dragon's Lair shit. 
---
# OOF
---
Does Open Handed work for everyone or just you? 
---
What would you run besides Ruin, BBQ, monitor &amp; abuse, and sloppy butcher or phobia? 
---
It‚Äôs way more than y‚Äôall think, I‚Äôm now actually averaging 40 points a game for doing well instead of like 24
---
Not gonna pretend like I know what this means
---
I like to crouch and spam the ambush attack a little bit to constantly OINK at survivors
---
You know what 
---
At least it‚Äôs not a legion cosplay
---
Put it down for an hour. If I have a bad killer game I‚Äôm gonna be on tilt for the next one so I just go murder stuff in Warframe/Skyrim for a bit. 
---
That's a stacked Shrine. Best I've seen!
---
I feel like a lot of people are picking the perks unique perks even if they're not that good on that killer because they don't have good perks. Pop Goes the Weasel isn't that good. Neither is remember me.
---
If the killer is bad why is NOED at the end such a big deal? He's still a bad killer. I mean, I use it and it doesn't help me suck any less.
---
I've done Wraith, 2 Nurse costumes, and default Huntress...but I don't ever see myself making Legion. 
---
Yes, but they don't add up like you'd initially think they would. 
---
If you have two perks that slow something down by 10%, the first one will knock survivors down to 90% speed and the next one will knock 10% off of the new total. So 90% would be brought down to 81% instead of 80 (10% of 90 is 9% so you lose 9%). 
---
The formula is: 
---
Speed = (Base speed + positive modifiers)x(1-Negative modifier)x(1-Negative modifier) and so on until you run out of negatives).
---
That doesn't fly shove Rank15 unfortunately. 
---
Guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all
---
Like assign each Hex perk a color and have they color only visible to the killer but the survivors only see them lit up like normal. 
---
Really cool idea dudeüòÄ
---
Thank the lord for Ruin. Now I don't need to buy the Hag.
---
It‚Äôs a good perk, but imo I think it‚Äôs the worst of the five exhaust perks. 
---
*Legion pick rate rises to 100000%*
---
Chases are supposed to be 40 seconds or less anyway. If you weren't so reliant on abusing a single mechanic Legion wouldn't bother you so much.
---
Lately I've been playing with 3 same perks and rotating one of them. Whenever I tried Resilience, I wouldn't get hit so I could use the small speed bonus. lol
---
I think it can be an okay choice if you don't know what to use in one of your slots.
---
Not to mention that all a suicide mission accomplishes is giving the killer an even bigger win than they would have had. 
---
The worst is when the killer hook camps someone and the rest of the team all come to try and save the person at all costs. Then they all complain about the camping despite them being the entire reason that it worked in the first place. 
---
Don‚Äôt listen to em!
---
&gt;Crouching does nothing
---
eliminating the terror radius is seriously nothing to you?
---
&gt;traps are only good end game
---
any trap before the first two gens will make good survivors slow the game down on their own by not finishing gens
---
Idk but all i see is claudettes who hide ue around the map and they never touch gens or they urban during a chase. Like they wont loop the pallet theyll hide behind a tree thinking the killer doesnt see them DURING A CHASE. 
---
Yeah at least you get something good XD i played on ps4 for a long time b4 switching to pc and when i saw i had to pay for ace i was annoyed but did it anyways
---
What mechanic am I ‚Äúabusing‚Äù to you? Are you seriously suggesting that looping is ‚Äúabusing chase mechanics?‚Äù This reddit amazes me every single day.
---
I get slugged 10 games in a row. I use unbreakable. I never get slugged. I take unbreakable off. I get slugged. Story of my life
---
Ruin BBQ Monitor and Bloodhound
---
How are they gonna make more cosmetics if they have to do the work to implement that?
---
Its better than running self care. Perks that synergize with being injured are always good
---
None of the killers powers are hard counters. (except trapper just barely if you do it right)
---
DS still goes off, you still waste time and lose momentum whether it be perks or powers that you utilize as soft counters. NOED is not always as easy to counter but it can be hard countered without the selection of perks or items by ‚Äúcleansing the totems‚Äù.
---
At the end of the day both perks suck to get hit with but damn does it feel good to soft counter DS efficiently even if I know I still lost momentum from it, and nothing beats actually doing the totems and seeing the killer brought NOED post game.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to argue but it‚Äôs a decent change. Let me put it into a scenario. You hook 3 of them and 2 of them twice, and break 2 lanterns, instead of getting 16 it‚Äôs 23. That‚Äôs 7 more which is the previous equivalent of 2 hooks and a lantern. Again, not trying to argue but it‚Äôs a nice amount more. If you kill all of them with 3 hookings each plus 2 lanterns you would get a hefty 44 instead of 30. That‚Äôs almost as much as a survivor completing every gen and escaping with a lantern. Only 1 less. Please stop complaining about the extra points as it isn‚Äôt a joke at all, and will free up the queues a bit and make killer, which I play more, better to play.
---
He‚Äôs unfun. Personally, I don‚Äôt find him annoying, but that‚Äôs cuz i try and have fun in this game. If you take it to serious, it becomes more stressful &amp; less fun. So i never care who i play against. 
---
Insidious noed nurse hiding behind the gates with blood warden.
---
He can down anyone if you really want to.  You just stab them with Frenzy then follow them to break chase to drain the bleed out timer, or you can run Frank's Mixtape and 3 hit them.  His power granting him the ability to quickly vault over windows and pallets as well as sprint fast can make him seem overbearing and suffocating for survivors to deal with since he has little counterplay.  
---
But, without any of his good add-ons like Frank's Mixtape he can waste a lot of time to down someone which means good survivors can use that time to pop generators like mad.  If survivors like to fuck around in games, Legion is going to be a killer they can't do that with since he'll always be able to turn it around in due time.  
---
Personally, with how many shitshow perks that survivors have and how it's always that side that has the most entitled kids crying about almost anything (Hillbilly is 115% movement speed, Tombstone Piece is OP, Iridescent Heads are toxic, etc.) I am happy to have a killer that is the biggest, neon-lit middle finger to them.  Reap what you sow, motherfuckers. 
---
Escape is not an escape
---
Has it really been a whole year since this was originally posted? Damn time flies.
---
Well just have fun and say GG &amp; WP at the end because every one needs to feel that they played well even if they lost also im trash at this game rank 13 is hard for me because i get looped and don't know how to loop so i get ran around for 5 gens and get like 0 - 2 kills but im happy i got at least 1 kill
---
So you copy-pasted a spirit.png file on a geometric galaxy background and slapped on some emojis? Pretty low effort.

Ah well now I understand the dcs but uh I'm running one perk on the guy 0 add ons and having a blast just sprinting around. I've had quite a few toxic little swf groups tbag at hooks recently (and I've run into them again) but haven't really faced many toxic people since they all DC lol

I know exactly what it is OP. You can't stop me from worshipping it. I'm ready to ascend!

---
Don't listen to u/secretdbd some killers are really good, or really lucky. I know I fall into the second account.
---
That‚Äôs literally what you said... you‚Äôre suggesting looping is abusing chase mechanics when it‚Äôs the ONLY thing survivors can do to live in chases...
---
As if I care lmao. I'm an eternal rank 15 since half a year now.
---
Congratulations, you just repeated the conversation, including the bit where I didn't call looping abusing the chase mechanic, thus proving yourself wrong. And, apparently, an idiot. Well done!
---
Yes. Up the ante is the best killer perk.
---
good idea

Starting in a game as a newbie can be stressful, especially if the game has been out for several years, so you have that chance of running into veterans, but honestly, your best bet would be to hop right in and get your hands dirty. I had the privilege of starting out playing with a couple of friends since they introduced me to it when it was free on PlayStation for a month, but even then, I had no idea what I was doing, it was fucking torture getting used to the game. But now it's been less than a year, and I've already gotten used to how to go against and play every killer so that I would say merely watch a couple of YouTubers who are very experienced in the game but also commentate in a way that even the newest of players can understand. For this, I would probably say watch HybridPanda, Monto, and Ardetha, all three being very skilled and very experienced in the game. And once you want to start getting into the meme/toxic side of the community, watch no0b3 and Demi, both very entertaining to watch. And that's all I have to say, learn from hands-on experience along with gaining tips from watching those YouTubers I listed and you'll be perfectly ok. Good luck in the Fog, my friend!
---
This is the first I've heard of a prestige exploit, this very recent?
---
Full team of DS overloads the graphical settings. Add pallet bitch slaps on top of that, you‚Äôre guarantied getting 12fps. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the sweaty nerd mist everywhere. 
---
I started playing on Spirit free weekends. What was Wraith before the update?
---
Well I think its safe to say the person is salty üòÇ Though I never understood dcing to deny a BBQ stack. Imo you are doing the killer a favor by removing yourself from the game and putting your teammates at a huge disadvantage. The killer can now control the game and 3 hook everybody at his own pace, even some slugging on the side if the person is on deadhook if enough gens are still up.. Because of that the killer probably ends up with more points than what the BBQ stack would have provided in a 4v1 instead of a 3v1. That aside its petty to rake out your frustration on people who had nothing to do with what triggered you. If you want payback remember or write down the name and the next time you meet you farm/sandbag him or facecamp him. Thats easier on console though as you cant/dont namechange often.
---
It‚Äôs only customizable in the three categories. Head chest and legs. Nothing further can be done in each section.
---
I didn‚Äôt hear the n-word...
---
Thanks (:
---
Every non-licensed killer and survivor are available all the time in the shop. As of right now and probably forever, licensed characters will never be purchasable with in game currency.
---
No, I did not.
---
Firstly, I never said a single word about looping. Secondly, read the fucking comment again and pay attention this time.
---
"Chases are supposed to be 40 seconds or less anyway. If you weren't **so reliant on abusing a single mechanic** Legion wouldn't bother you so much."
---
**Bolded** so maybe your eyes will actually see it and your brain will grasp the context this time.
---
Technician negates the +8 meter hearing range, now at any level. It makes it so that surveillance only does the gen regressing thing
---
Play whatever the hell you want. Who cares what people get upset over. 
---
Except for the small little detail where good killers don‚Äôt fall for window jukes more than once a game. 
---
Legion is bad without them he can't do anything really without Frank's mixtape so 
---
interesting
---
Except that's the point of the game. Might as well just farm your team if you don't care and want points.
---
Mixtape only takes 1 less hit
---
One is the best map for mostly any killer but Hillbilly and the other is the best map for survivor except for going against Hillbilly. Why do you put them in the same category of bad maps?
---
Holy shit. This would be so interesting.
---
&gt;It would cost too much to get you all theme songs. I mean we have to pay John Carpenter to follow The Shape everywhere.
---
Ikr I got into 5 games with q's of 5 mins each all dced on loading screen depimed I WASTED ALMOST 30 MINS TRYING TO PLAY A GAME they should add like 25k BP if killer dc and if event gose on you get max possible rewards for that 
---
This is fucking hilarious 
---
Not every perk has reliable hard counters, killers and survivors both have perks you can‚Äôt just negate from working. Not to mention the whole reason hex perks can be removed from play is they‚Äôre super strong. 
---
but i do care
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I was in solo and I swear, she found me so easily and scared the crap out of me! If I was being a potato it wasn‚Äôt on purpose. Sometimes bad players will run the killers to you. I played against a spirit right after and was able to do 4 of the 5 gens myself, so I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm the worst player. 
---
I agree with this one hundred percent if those same people that use ds when they get caught like legion isn't effecting the game he's easy to juke but there's a lot of boosted players

Thanks, I know sometimes I just have really bad games where nothing goes right for me but it wasn‚Äôt just me, it was all of us (I was solo, not sure about the others). We did make a mistake by not really leaving the area but she kept hooking us and I think they were overly altruistic. 
---
? Um no it takes like five to get them down mixtape it takes 2or 3 I don't rember

YES
---
I hardly camped haha, only when I wanted to get an easy axe off.  After that I played normally, this guy still messaged me and continued to.

Thank god for No one Escapes Death.

---
80 seconds a generator, right? So if one guy can run him for even 45 seconds, that's a little over half a gen, he goes down and gets hooked at around the 60 second mark, that's 20 seconds left on 3 gens, and you have 2 minutes on the hook. That's AT LEAST 2 gens on 1 person being hooked. People need to realise this. Time management.
---

It's 4 at base 3 with mix tape.
---
The first 2 hits are usually back to back. 
---
Base has to hit 2 more times after the initial combo. Mix tape only has to hit 1 time after the first two hits.

it doesn‚Äôt really do anything since he‚Äôll keep going after you but ok
---
Have you seen Legion walking towards you from afar on Ormond? Shit looks so fucking cool

I‚Äôm going to assume she had Prayer beads? It‚Äôs pretty stupid OP

Exactly, you are disagreeing with me agreeing with you. Brown medkits and brown toolboxes are not good, however, you make a brown medkit useful with a syringe or 1-up. I am not saying that brown medkit is useful by itself, only for one health state.

---
Haha it‚Äôs the fact that he kept on messaging me which I found pathetic
---
Probably meant "DC'd" Usually how people spell it.
---
the score should show that you have equal to or greater points even though they escaped
---
&gt;you HEAVILY implied looping. Please stop being dumb.
---
I did absolutely no such thing. I very specifically called out using only a single mechanic while ignoring the rest. It'd be like playing a fighting game, only using leg sweeps, then getting mad there's a fighter who floats. Don't abuse (spam) one mechanic and a floater won't cause you as much trouble.
---
&gt;and obliterates stealth.
---
LMAO. Obliterates stealth? Are you fucking kidding me? Doc is far more anti stealth than Legion. And like with Doc the counter is basically the same, just stay out of his fucking TR as much as possible. But unlike Doc, hiding inside the TR is still viable so long as no one else is there to be a Killer Instinct proc. And even then, most Legion's ignore KI and focus on the one person.
---
It's okay to be upset over a camp but the guy is beyond salt with the whole "im gonna report you enjoy your ban &gt;;( ". Kid is toxic post game.
---
Yeah, I once played a mat h against an overly altruistic team (not sure if SWF) and I ended up hooking all 4 in the basement because they kept trying to rescue each other.
---
This makes me happy that I play on console. Sorry you had to pay for that, that‚Äôs kinda annoying having it free for one platform and not the other.
---
Doesn't change the fact, that this kid was so triggered that he wanted to message OP. Like, why? Shit like that happens, it's part of the game, deal with it and move on to the next game. I'll never understand these players... 
---
Shoulda made it ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù

To try and get a excitement about writing essays 1/2 of the topics were about video games and things like that, and many of her classmates are also presenting about video games. Kids these days don‚Äôt know any better.
---
Probably as
---
Never did,good luck to you guys over there
---
Or a perk that ads dull totems. Or a perk that switches the totem to another dull when cleansed
---
Thanks! ;)
---
Also just having a controller plugged into my pc will sometimes display the controller commands
---
Claudette worse
---
This could of been a thing
---
Yes. Usually just retry though.
---
100 for the first coin, 200 for the second coin, 300 for the third etc. It goes up the more you get.
---
It goes up 100 points every time you earn a token. I've earned 4 so far, and need 500 points to earn the next one.
---
You must have had a very low ping with that killer
---
One step closer to the edge...AND I'M ABOUT TO BREAK!

---
You can't call me out like this. Male presenting Legions are too attractive not to draw 50,000 times.
---
Also on PS4 and it‚Äôs happening. Extremely irritating, especially when the injured survivor thinks I‚Äôm doing it on purpose and runs away. 
---
"It's inconceivable to leave anyone behind." - No One Left Behind
---
But yeah, sometimes it's best to just leave. 
---
Thanks!
---
Same, lol
---
Yeah, but the hindrance is so negligible it's not worth the perk slot.
---
Rank doesnt matter, as you arent more or less of a DBD fan/player depending on rank. However there is a major difference in skill when it comes to rank. I usually sit in red ranks, and killers are much better, and survivors play a lot smarter. When I play with a friend who is 13, I get placed with other rank 13s and the killers are usually a lot easier to run around or trick and the survivors dont play even close to the red ranks. It is a very noticeable difference in how they play. 
---
I'd tell her to pick a better game.
---
She‚Äôs dead set on this one, I tried to convince her to do an easier one.
---
Not hard to do in corn....
---
True. My little brother and his friends all play a ton of fortnite and like all the parents in the neighborhood joke about them being a generation of pussies. It‚Äôd be funny if it wasn‚Äôt sad lmao. 
---
I would either go afk or dc probably.
---
Make me sad. :( 
---
Like, 10-20 min queue just to leave lobby so you don‚Äôt rubber band. 
---
When a rank 18 survivor makes a post. Lol bashing aside who cares as long as the gens are done you still get the coins. The way i think about it is treat other survivors how you would wish to be treated. If you got tunneled all game but managed to loop for 4-5 gens before getting first hooked would you want your team to leave without even trying to save you? Also i like to be ballsy so i go for the saves no matter what. Fuck escaping lol.
---
I have some PlayStation messages 
---
I really don't think legion would be the easiest killer to play as I very rarely seen anyone playing a decent legion. 
---
Wraiths another  odd one I main wraith and while its easy to just simply play if you want to be actually good at it and get constant 4ks it requires absolute perfection in chases and predicting survivor movement. whereas something like billy has an excellent closer so more friendly to a newer player 
---
Those will do 
---
Billy hard to use??
---
THIS IS +7 HAUNTED
---
Yup, just buy the DLC and put the BP you get into Bubba's bloodweb. Eventually you'll get that teachable. I got it by just playing Dwight lol
---
CAN‚ÄôT WAKE UP
---
hard agree
---
he might Report you m, but there will ofc be no ban.
---
Who uses that steam feature anyway?
---
‚ÄúMomma, ain‚Äôt we ever gittin chili gain?‚Äù 
---
For real.... I don‚Äôt have the $5 to buy leathercock. :( 
---
I‚Äôm cheap and petty. Lol
---
Mermaid Dwight
---
Thats totally a meta perk that almost all killers are running. Yup. Totally.
---
/s
---
maybe play the Killers before ranking them *lol*
---
How is Legion the easiest and why are Hillbilly, Wraith and Leatherface that high?
---
Sending someone a message on PSN saying that they're going to be banned is actually a bannable offense. I would have told him that, blocked him, and not engaged in a pointless conversation that clearly wasn't going anywhere. 
---
true try to hit with billy's ability cross map
---
LOL
---
I think it would make a lot of sense for Chucky to jump onto the survivor's back and puppeteer the survivor to the hook. Then Chucky jumps onto the hook, lowering it enough to push the survivor into the hook, which then yanks upward.
---
As trapper I love haddonfield due to all the "hallways" for the traps.
---
 You counter genrush easy by patrolling a perimeter, so that you end up by having 2 gens close to each other.
---
Go for the gen, just assume Adrenaline. By doing a gen you could not only be healing the other guy witout actually healing him, but could also saving the injured guy being chased if he has it too.
---
Not necessarily "hard" to use, but using his chainsaw effectively and hitting difficult backrevs (like curving his chainsaw around a loop) undoubtedly takes some sort of skill. 
---
It's funny that she need such thing
---
Honestly. My day today
---
Nurse
---
Legion
---
Meyers 
---
Billy
---
Can I get some diversity please lol
---
Haunted grounds?It helps I guess.(that is the perk that makes fake,exposing totems right?)
---
Sorry idk i like doing dcd rather than dced or dc'd its just faster. Im weird ig LOL
---
how do People still think camping/tunneling is reportable?  They should get banned for false reports
---
Yeah. It was annoying. But its the price you pay to convert to pc ig. But at least you got it for free!
---
This. Legion was the first killer I ever played as and it took me ages to get used to playing as them. Always felt like they were weak, didn‚Äôt realise people thought they were op just cause they can run. 
---
well thats just bs
---
Im guessing nea wrote the second message
---
I prefer the add ons 
---
Cold Dirt and Joyes Mixtape to get a Frenzy Hit, run around them to block pallets, Windows and down them with a normal hit
---
Do you have Adrenalin and the gen is near completion? 
---
Yes - Finish the gen
---
No - Heal yourself so you can save the hooked survivor. 
---
YES YES VERY NICE. NOW HANG HER UP IN THE BASEMENT AND GIVE HER THAT PHAT INSIDIOUS STARE UNTIL SHE DIES
---
or to memorize the pallet positions &amp; gen spawns for us high rank survivors.
---
Yeah I can only get to rank 7 with him, or at least from my last time playing Wraith at my actual rank because of rank reset, if you‚Äôre good at tunneling you‚Äôll be fine with Wraith.
---
I am curious, does Unnerving Presence shorten the skill check on DS? 
---
Feels bad man
---
I'd be happy to spend money on this game if they would stop treating consoles like shit. Keep supporting shit practices though, I'm sure it won't end badly.
---
Aww. 
---
What I‚Äôm going to start doing is time my chases. If we don‚Äôt get a gen done within ~80 seconds (since that‚Äôs how long it takes to get a gen done) I can safely assume I will not be escaping 
---
Yeah, you know that thing that happens after being hit twice? What's the problem? You want correct terminology? Alright, dying state.
---
Or are you arguing that this is not a thing that it happens too easily? Yes, I would agree. If you failed to realise, my comment was a flip of the OP's argument, not a reflection of my beliefs.
---
So stick your confused 'what' where the sun don't shine.
---
When there is only 1 survivor remaining they will be revealed to the killer for 3 seconds, exposed, cannot leave the trial, and can be moried. This becomes active if there is a dull totem on the map. Survivors cannot leave the match via hatch and will be cursed for 60 seconds. (Does not require a totem)
---
Juggling, Enduring, Unnerving Presence, or twitching (hitting something and shaking the mouse around when the skill check pops up) 
---
No way, the previous events were a breeze comparatively. It was like 55 hooks to get the propain hammer, along with tons of BP. I leveled a LOT of killers and survivors during that event. They don't have to make it punishingly difficult or spend money, that's just a rewarding model that they know dummies will feed into.
---
Wait, how could they do that? Just curious.
---
If this is possible wouldn‚Äôt that mean someone could disconnect now and trick the game into thinking it was the killer and get the escape points? I thought people during Hallowed Blight were collecting the crap and then suiciding, not DCing.
---
All I'm thinking is waluigi.
---
Why is it worthless? (I'm new to the game don't shred me plz)
---
Ding ding ding! You said the magic word! you win the internet fyte!
---
The comment I replied to states quite simply "You will run out of addons fast trying to do that". Now you're saying you won't run out of total addons, just rare ones? Contradicting yourself there.
---
Fact is I was replying to your original claim. You don't run out of all addons, you make more than you can spend. Don't try to bring some justification into it now, because that has nothing to do with what you originally said.
---
Please god I hope this is it
---
No this is beyond broken please.  I don't wanna be hooked and start dying of laughter and then proceed to forget about struggling and die
---
Yes it was a joke
---
I'm curious, does Unnerving Presence work? A survivor that's picked up is still within the terror radius, so theoretically it should be more difficult. 
---
No shredding here! You can‚Äôt use a green (broken) key without add ons. I brought in a firecracker hoping to get a tool box or med kit or flashlight (or red key) and instead it was something you can‚Äôt even use. 
---
Thank you very much. 
---
Damn wish I was that good at dodging. My looping is sheer luck.
---
More about how fun it is to play against them rather than the balance/win percentages. The entire reason I play and enjoy survivor is to have a fun, intense chase with the killer, not to hold m1 and press space the entire game. 
---
Im getting ptsd from 4 blink nurse noeds
---
I just really loved the whole invisibility thing and was the first killer i started doing really good on. I don't think hes the best killer at all but i know him so intimately I play a much better wraith then average and i kinda like the fact the fact that people aren't used to seeing him played properly and therefore don't know all the counters.  
---
I bet you think that about a lot of people huh buddy
---
Explained myself in the comments. We cranked out 3 Gens in 5 minutes, and nobody was even injured or hooked. The moment he got hooked he gave up. 
---
Oink
---
Can you link to some streamers who derank to ranks 20-18?

---
Claudette has proliferated. 
---
Same. Won my first game. Such a fun game that literally came out of nowhere to me
---
Nurse is harder to play and easier to fake out than legion. Also she‚Äôs been in the game forever, with legion there still hope the devs will fix them 
---
So he can still see his surroundings right, just not the survivors and the things they leave behind? Seems unplayable if you were just faced with a black screen the whole time hahaha
---
Nurse is harder to use than Huntress and Legion is not easier than Trapper or Myers.
---
Awesome just what this game needs, another crawldette.
---
Point and laugh. 
---
I would say:
---
Spirit
---
Huntress
---
Hag
---
Doctor
---
Wraith
---
Myers
---
Pig
---
Freddy
---
Clown
---
Bubba
---
Trapper
---
I play legion so I can stab people around. Why use Frank's mixtape when that means one less hits for me? 4 stabs and screams compared to 3? Nah.

Mate it‚Äôs the other way around on console. Killer frame rates CONSTANTLY cheat survivors and hit when they have no right to
---
&gt; thinking it was the killer and get the escape points
---
Yep, that's exactly how it works. You don't get the 5k escape bonus, but you acquire any BP you earned and keep any items you're holding. It's basically a rage quit that rewards you.
---
&gt;I thought people during Hallowed Blight were collecting the crap and then suiciding, not DCing.
---
You are correct, I was referring more to the fact that you'd have a scenario where typically at least 1 person has the objective of "get the event bonus, and get out leaving everyone else in a 3v1".
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted for this, it's pretty unanimously agreed that the Thanataphobia percentages make a pretty minimal difference and other perks do it better unless you're Legion. 
---
Got my Rin in the kimono with one of the school haircuts

High skillcap, there's a very obvious difference between a good and a mediocre billy
---
Seems like it‚Äôs so much easier to 360 people on console. Funny clip though 
---
I think it just goes to show how wildly everyones opinions differ  ( which is good as that shows balance in the game)
---
Because I find spirit one of the easiest to play
---
*pst* these posts are kind of not allowed on the sub, just letting you know so you wont feel bad if it gets removed

Also you showed him name, this counts as witchhunting.

Oh haha thanks for the heads up I appreciate it
---
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
---
Did you use the envelope offering?

I wonder if having multiple Chuckys' littered around the map would work too? You could spawn as any of them then attack for the jumpscare. 
---
Mime clown 
---
Lmfao nea in the back üòÇ
---
That would be a fast dc tbh.
---
Thanatophobia is probably the better Ruin. Higher level survivors won't have as much of a problem with Ruin.
---
Thats not "counterplay".
---
Notice in all of these complaint posts, the op always seems to loop for 5 gens? Just me noticing?
---
I've literally gotten -rep for "spending all game healing" when I was the killer 
---
She's got a high skill ceiling but is very strong (similar to Nurse). If you like playing mindgames and have good perks (or add-ons) for tracking survivors and map awareness, go for it.
---
Put the sound on the first time you see it and it will be scary as f**k
---
This is why you don't play solo surv, people don't cleanse dulls.
---
Ive only ever seen it once and was very confused.
---
QnQ is okay, Open-Handed comboes well with Kindred, but everything here is trash.
---
I know the feeling. The Game is a map that I just have the worst track record on. For whatever the reason, I go against the most nightmarish killers on the Game. 
---
That...was wild.
---
I was talking about using the exact same addons every game. I am not making excuses, you just have the reading comprehension of a monkey. Yes I said "addons" in the comment before that. Going by previous context, I was obviously refering to running out of a specific adon or addons. Like, as mentioned, double stalk addon myers.
---
I completely agree with this, though, that's not to say I wouldn't help someone ever. To be honest, I would understand if I was on the recieving end of this as well, I mean, it's not like they're obligated to help me because I got downed by a killer with NoED, I'd much prefer them to survive and me to die instead of one or more of them die.
---
Having the Saw theme while playing aa the pig would be lit. 
---
I Brought Dead Hard, Insta Heal, Deliverance. Plus   
---
It Was Nurse On Console At she's Pretty Hard To use On Xbox (In My Experience) and It Was More Like 4 Gens If I'm being Honest. 
---
Also I'm not Complaining Really More just Making A Suggestion. 
---
Agree, sometimes people care too much about dying. Unless I have 3 or more shit matches in a row where I didn't get to escape I'll stay and go for the save. The best matches have been where your ballsy moves after the gates open pay off. Plus I'll take the good feeling that I tried over leaving someone behind. 
---
Report him To PSN, that will really teach him! I had to report someone, too (although I have no idea what happened to him, but I hear PSN does not let that kind of stuff go unpunished)
---
More so than SC. 
---
Definitely not, BL is way better.
---
I was just going off the "can confirm,  wasn't fun" part but i guess i missed the joke. 
---
Yeah I Didn't Know They Could Do That But With That Info I guess That Its Better the Way It Is then
---
(Or They Could Fix Their Game Lmao) &lt;---That's A Joke Btw
---
You say it like that's a bad thing ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
This guy gets it. Good shit brother. Mad love for my fellow survivors out here going for the ballsy saves.
---
those common addons seem very strong for common addons 
---
You don't understand the argument I see.
---
you dont need to be good to rank up, and sweaty =/ good, you can be sweaty and bad, the point is that it's not fun to play against.
---
I can't understand killers that master the map, like I main the Pig and I always get lost. The fucking Pig getting lost in the Game. Can you imagine that? Its gotten to the point where people would accuse me of being a bot
---
It also slows healing
---
You don‚Äôt really win unless you get hate mail 
---
You can also play 4blink nurse, tombstone piece myers, beads spirit, oneshot huntress or insta saw billy all with an ebony mori on top. And they all will feel op. Honestly, nerf instaheals and moris
---
Done! Much appreciated 
---
Ok.
---
The argument is between Greens and Reds, stop being a strawman and actually realize what you're talking about, anyone who deranks to r15 is a subhuman and deserves a ban, but around R10-R6 is completely fine because it  doesn't make a significant difference in skill compared to R1.
---
To be fair, BBQ is only strong on Billy, Huntress and Nurse and used for the BP
---
Hate the game, not the player. Go watch a DbD video of BrickyOrchid and listen to what he suggests at the end of every DbD vid.
---
Me too. But I wanted to play her anyway, so i save some shards.
---
Is that a glitch? Why is Claudette going ultra instinct
---
*nods in approval*
---
I'm trying to learn spirit and what does juniper bonsai does exactly? Increase frequency of passive phasing? What does it mean?
---
Such a subjective question. Yet here come all the pros.
---
Kate
---
Your DLC's are also $1 cheaper.
---
Oh god, I tend to be shit, but I don't think I could handle doing so badly that people think I'm a bit lol
---
First person down disconnects. :3
---
Oh, yea I'm only talking about from a PC perspective. I have no clue if something like this is possible on Console, although I imagine so.
---
You sir are a goddamn American hero
---
*FBI wants to know your location*
---
Just got her yesterday. Played 4 games. 
---
Game 1:One kill. (N.O.E.D) Got bullied by SWF XD
---
Game 2:Easy 4k (Last 2 gave up lol)
---
Game 3:3man last one got away cause i got baited of hatch XD
---
Game 4:Easy 4k, and got some salt. 
---
She's awesome.
---
I‚Äôm on my last coin and honestly I don‚Äôt know why I did this to myself. I work and have money to spend so I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt just buy the last set with cashmoney. 
---
This event has made me realise I need to play different games for a while.
---
..........I‚Äôll be back for the next chapter tho ;)
---
That is fair. And that rule cannot be used consistently in random solo queue games. Legion may be a pain, but using Lithe to waste his power and get ahead of him for a bit to the next pallet for a loop would make it easier. I think it's just that legion is *relatively* new and people get frustrated.
---
Hmmm I got a scenario. Same situation, but you were first to die. What then?
---
Don't feel bad I went to locker to refill my hatches and got scared when I found a survivor XD
---
While we are spit balling ideas, how bout we just delete Legion?
---
Just make it an option for every character. The game needs a QOL for character cosmetics that arent pay/grind.
---
It usually gets worse towards rank reset because all the less experienced players have climbed higher. Then again during the reset its all the higher ranks in with the lowers. Cant really win :(
---
Br*h what the fuck?
---
I wager your Legion build with Spirit's MD Ring+Prayer Beads with M&amp;A, Discordance, Surveillance and Ruin. Insane map pressure that'd make Billy blush, yoink potential that'd make Myers proud, and the only thing close to a counter is a niche perk (Spine Chill).
---
You need a hobby
---
Spirit has this passive ability where her motions are randomly dodgy in appearance (I think there's some afterimages of her, to be specific), which makes it more difficult to predict what she's doing. The juniper increases how frequently this happens.
---
The one true killer- shit ping 
---
Nah screw that mate i never leave them behind even if they've got noed, ill look for that damn totem so i can take a hit for them.
---
My only suggestion would be the noise made outside of a chase or terror radius. Otherwise that obession is instantly killed once caught id imagine
---
But I mean hey, at least it's Legion. Could be a rank 1 nurse.
---
Garbage as usual
---
I have textual evidence as well if this person ‚Äòlaughing‚Äô while explaining that he didn‚Äôt care if he abused an unfair glitch. He would happily take the one week ban as he had multiple accounts....
---
I dont like any of the event items besides 2 that I already got, so when I play survivor I just try my best to help the other people get out and sacrifice myself or take aggro. 
---
Best tip i can give you is to not take a lantern until youre about to leave, theres literally no point to grab one beforehand. Also plan to take hatch if youre desperate for the coins
---
I have been playing all day and night for a few days, only a few power naps
---
I always grab one right in the beginning. Gotta get those blood points :D
---
1. No 2. Salty killers that think juggling DS is fine but if you tap to avoid hex you‚Äôre scum. Plus it takes a little longer 3. Yes you can keep your purple toolbox like that if you escape with it. 
---
D A R N
---
Obviously Kate Denson, her Alpine outfit especially
---
Unpredictably pretty good job so far.
---
Jesus 
---
Nope. 
---
Can you not see that he hit me miles away When I threw down the pallet 
---
Wait, 2018 ?
---
+ Urban Evasion = Claudette doesn't exist
---
Honestly I think i was tripping when I made this meme. I could have sworn there were people there.
---
Well to be fair every killer have a very very hard time finding survivors in that map.
---
I JUST leveled up meg for quick and quiet ;.;
---
This and stay away from each other and, of course, don't get yourself seen. Legion is very bad at spotting people without Frenzy unless the Killer player is very good at doing so by pure skill.
---
Red ranks and still camping, yup that's a console killer for you

Tapping gens or simply doing the skill check makes Ruin have no effect. Thanatophobia is unavoidable as a survivor.
---
Yeah I know but since I couldn‚Äôt care less about the cosmetics I might as well get something out of this event
---
Which is overrated and which is good?
---
Just got this game and played it for the first time tonight...for about 8 hrs. 
---
I‚Äôm still pretty horrible as survivor or killer, but I finally on killer mode got to my last survivor, bashed her and went to pick her up and my internet assed out
---
Then I went in and played survivor and finally got all the generators done with. Got hooked opening the gate on the last probably 5 seconds before opening. 
---
Yeah. I feel it.
---
Ruin
---
Thanataphobia
---
Quick &amp; Quiet 
---
Open handed.
---
Nope :P, but yeah that‚Äôs bs
---
Wahhhhh i cant run a killer for 5 gens, he is cancer wahhhhhhhhh. Fucking idiot, this is the embodiement of the DbD reddit
---
Ruin is overrated as fuck, QnQ isn't "good", it's not very reliable but it can work out for you sometimes.
---
I JUST BOUGHT HAG ARE YOU KIDDING ME???
---
Can‚Äôt remember which game it was... but you push tyrant into a big bowl of molten metal soup. 
---
But yeah. Just to tired to think of something a little more original. Maybe gen break % increases with every gen completed. But that kinda seems useless too. Lol
---
Im a survivor main and started to play a little killer, 2 out of my 3 matches this happened to me. I had to let them bleed out. I hate survivors like this.
---
I'd have opted for "Pumped up kicks"
---
Lmao. I binged KH3. So I‚Äôm taking a break from it to play DBD
---
I feel like this is the sentiment of many.
---
Voice chat? To hear salty crybabies? Or 10 year olds that argue with their mom? Not thank you. 
---
I love resilience.  Been using it since legion came out since it's stupid to heal midgame against him.  Also synergizes extremely well with my adrenaline.
---
Just play who you like. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with playing what you enjoy, don‚Äôt let some angry kids on the internet ruin the game for you. 
---
Just have fun, man. Play for you.
---
The entity has really blessed us this time bois, Hex Ruin. TY Bby
---
I'm frightened
---
I couldn‚Äôt sit there the entire time I went after the David who you can see in the background.
---
You can‚Äôt run them for a single gen no matter how bad they are or good you are, bc they gonna press m2 and you‚Äôre getting hit and them tunneled down immediately. The absolute worst killer main in dbd can down the absolute best survivor main in the exact same time as the best killer main can down a survivor who doesn‚Äôt know how to look backwards as legion. Killer removes all skill from either side and the only counter to them is hope the player is disabled irl and won‚Äôt find you or will fall for window jukes. 
---
People complain about entitled survivors but killers act like they‚Äôre entitled to get ez downs on survivors who are better at the game than them 
---
He ended up having unbreakable and escaped.
---
They‚Äôre the reason people want killer buffs.
---
I'm sorry senpai, tho I missed my skillcheck, I'll be sure to open all the gates for you
---
Reported him, but it‚Äôs hard to not let it get to me when this happens every time on this map.
---
I‚Äôm getting real sick and tired of legions character getting hate. I‚Äôm not talking about the harmless edge jokes I‚Äôm talking about people who are genuinely mean about people who like the character. I mentioned cosplaying legion and had someone say ‚Äúanyone but legion... please..‚Äù its honestly pathetic. I mean I‚Äôve seen people get hate for playing a character in most communities but never for cosplaying them. I understand this was a harmless joke but I have seen artists get hate for drawing them. Which is why I play them. I genuinely enjoy playing them. And I wasn‚Äôt going to because of the unfairness. But after I realized that I was getting hate for ENJOYING the characters art, cosplays, and comics. So I‚Äôve decided to just embrace the hate by playing them.
---
A decent shrine? Unbelivable 
---
Obviously you would have the option to mute those players lol 
---
Thanatophobia does kinda suck though. 
---
Not when it happens every time I play this map...
---
Then why implement it? 99% people would mute eachother or won't be near eachother at all
---
Tbh was in game and I didn't think of it.
---
Realism, or going against the very way this game was designed around from the ground up? There's a reason SWF is plain broken. 
---
Everytime you play that map you have exploiters?  Jesus christ dude....I've encountered 3 exploiters like this since I started playing 2 years ago and I don't even think any were on that map 
---
I'm like you. I calculated the amount of time spent getting the coins and the amount I earn per hour. It was pure stubbornness that I didnt want to fork over the money. It would have saved me a lot of time and hardship to just sit this event out...
---
Poor innocent soul
---
This exploit is fairly new to my knowledge and fellow killer mains that I know in person have told me about it. I‚Äôve got this single exploit 3 times in the past 24 hours with video evidence.
---
ohh my god I was playing a game on Lery's where the doctor brought in a green mori and killed me pretty quickly. I stuck around to spectate anyway.
---
Anyway, he didn't manage to take out anyone else until NOED popped and he got someone on a hook.
---
The gate was open. The last two teammates could've just left, leaving the killer with a wholly unsatisfying 2k.
---
Instead, they try to go for hook rescues when the doctor is right at the hook, they don't have borrowed time, and they aren't even looking for the NOED totem.
---
They all died. I was actually enraged. I don't know why seeing this shit salts me so much but it does.
---
Great idea.  The only moonwalks that belong in this game are the ones Myers does at exit gates when he gets his ass kicked by survivors and just wants to meme.
---
One man shouldn't have all that power. 
---
I have 1200 hours, every achievement in the game, every character level 50, and 6 characters prestige 3 with every single perk. I've played this game almost too much lol. But this really isnt relevant to my point.
---
God damnit i have all of these....
---
NOED has a good chance of not even popping when you bring it, and then it is only active for the last minute of the game. I don't understand how you could think it is anything better then a niche endgame build perk.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ano6er/shrine_of_secrets_262019/
---
yeah that would be the mud.
---
This isn't entirely true!!!
---
First of all, not everyone who exploited got banned.
---
All of my exploited characters got reset back to level 1, meanwhile I got to keep my Level 50 and P3-50 characters.
---
The teachables for my exploited characters were once again locked. Only ONE of my friends so far has had their whole account wiped clean- the rest of my friends (About 4-5 people so far) just had their exploited characters reset.
---
But yes, I have lost all will to play this game. The devs are severely punishing players who just want to skip a bit of grinding (Bearing in mind you still have to level them all the way up to 50 and beyond if you want all perks) meanwhile actual hackers and people who ruin games manage to get off with no punishment.
---
Oh, also- it's funny how they don't care about any of the game-breaking bugs that make the game actually unplayable, but when innocent players want to skip some of the shitty grind in this shitty game, they flip their shit.
---
You dont need to play the killer you want to level up, you just put points into them.
---
That was a 180, also you were so far out that it hurt to watch
---
I think its pretty lame to just ditch your team but you do you
---
So, you think it's ok to cheat if there're no bans?
---
Mate, its not just claudettes. I saw a default dwight at rank 1 urban evasion crouching everywhere, failing skillchecks on generators then crouching away, it was fuckin terrible.
---
I main Nea and I don't get the meme. *cries*
---
Lmao yeah love it when I do 3 gens solo, save literally everyone, get hit by bullshit noed while taking a hit for an injured person and then get left to die. 100% agree here haha guys just leave lol not like you would already be dead if it weren't for me. 
---
you can always rebalance bt in other ways, besides i think bt is largely overrated and has a lot of counter play given it is derived from being within a terror radius that can be managed in a lot of different ways, or simply by pressuring the rescuer instead. Between the many powers that can hide terror radius or otherwise rapidly kill unhookers, and the ability if you really want to facecamp that hard to just interrupt the unhook/hit the unhooker so the rescuer is forced to run/die if they go for the unhook during the successful attack animation there's a lot of different answers to bt even if the deep wound timer is buffed. Besides i fail to see how making the deep wound timer based on proximity would have a substantial difference than being in a chase, it wouldn't effect the time from hit to mend substantially and if were just talking about end game rush to the exit it will have literally 0 impact
---
AGREED lmfao
---
Honestly I just played a game where they gen rushed me, I was playing spirit. Got one hooked and then BOOM fucking noed right üòé THEN I phase to the exit and SLUG Anotha one.
---
Long story short: survivors if you see noed, just leave dawg it ain't worth it
---
Yeah - in 1 chase I would have done definitely more than 9 vaults. I would be insta-moried. But outside a chase, I wouldn't do any loud noises, so this perk doesn't really work.
---
"what did it cost" 
---
"everything"
---
This is in the case of exploiting a bug? Because you would be lucky to not have evrything set to zero. Because you broke the EULA. At that point you're graced to be allowed to play.
---
I leveled up my Hag 2 days ago...
---
where did i say that, that‚Äôs not at all what i was talking about 
---
I'm not going to defend their behavior but they might have a point if you spend more of the game tunneling than you do harassing people on objectives. Gens only get done as fast as they do if nobody else in the game feels threatened or the need to disperse when they hear your terror radius because they've had time enough to know you're not actively engaging anybody else.
---
That's what I'm thinking as well. I don't want to be practically blind every time I get farmed. 
---
Shouldn't it be the other way around? Isn't he supposed to first show what they don't want it to be? Because now it's implying that the survs think that they're cleansing Haunted Ground but it's actually Ruin
---
I had a game where 2 surv dc'd and the killer decided to farm with us which was nice. 
---
My teamate left the match as soon as i was hooked, despite knowing the killer was farming all game.
---
Even the killer was like "wtf" post game lol.
---
Not ALL survivors care about if you live or die in any context. Personally, I'm altruistic so ill probably try to help those hooked once the gates are opened. But thats just me
---
Just leveled my Hag to lvl 35 to get Ruin. Fun times :^)
---
The thing is, it is harder to win with the "easy killers". So, what is hard really? If you play Huntress/Nurse all day you eventually get good and the challenge gets sucked out of the game. The more options you have the easier it gets to be honest. BHVR fucked up the "balance"(the game is unbalanced anyway) from the beginning and it's baffling that they don't know how their own game works. There are worlds between the worst killer and the best.
---
Wish I had your luck. For me, I end up staying on the gen as that dick head runs away, and hear the terror radius 5 seconds later. Get caught and hooked. That same team mate is over the other side of the map crouching in a corner.
---
Even worse is when someone unhooks you, and you urban evasion your way behind a rock and start healing. The team mate waddles up and wants to heal you instead. So you let them, and they fail a fucking skill check. Killer comes right back over and hooks you again.
---
These types of team mates need to eat soap.

Why couldn't he leave? I'm newish

Jesus is this what red rank looks like

if i'm playing swf, i almost always try to go for saves even if it will result in my death bc i love my friends. if its randos, i'll try my best to save but sometimes i just can't otherwise it'd be considered a farm. so i get why others leave me behind sometimes too and try not to take it personally. it ees just a game after all 
---
Literally just bought the Hag 3 days ago, and *now* Ruin decides to show up.
---
At least now I don't have to also wait for Devour Hope...
---
I mean I mastered her after a couple days. It's literally all about remembering her blink distances and thats it.

Sick throw man.  I'd have laughed my ass off if you hit me with that.  Respect.

Stop
---
The problem is the hatch mechanic. If I want my 4K I‚Äôve gotta bust my ass doing everything in my power to ensure no more than a single generator gets completed. Since that‚Äôs virtually impossible sometimes given how easy hexes are to find and that most competent survivors can push through ruin, I‚Äôm left with no other alternative than to slug to ensure success. Sucks for survivors but that‚Äôs more on the devs than the killers I feel. 
---
Stahp*
---
That's not because of the frame rate, it's because of the hit assist and the wonky hitboxes
---
The FPS drops only cover up the hit assist. Since I got my PS4 Pro I've had a significant decrease in FPS drops, but I still get hits on people I didn't deserve because of the hit assist and hitboxes being crazy big
---
LOL//
---
How many hours do you have in the game?
---
If you have friends you could just play KYF. But yeah it‚Äôd be an interesting concept to add in the future to allow new survivors an incentive to learn the game instead of starting up a killer or survivor game.
---
SWFs just ruin the game period
---
I agree, but it's so infuriating in the meantime because of all the toxic survivors. And I HATE losing in the meantime 
---
You don't have to play LF to level him up. Play your best killer (preferably without add-ons) and put bloodpoints into LF.
---
do you feel better now after venting on the internet?
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Join some discord (for example, of some streamer you like), find people there. You need only one other player to test things in KYF.
---
amen
---
I see jojo, I upvote.
---
No one cares, really. If you're not Youtuber/streamer and not from a region with extremely low players number, chances are you won't face same survivors any time soon. And by then you'll be way better.
---
Bing bong.
---
Absolutely amazed
---
Because he has no counter play but takes no skill to use once he hits you you're on a timer there's nothing you can do there's no point playing the game cause it completely removes the funnest part which is being chased
---
Ahhh dasboschitt. I miss him
---
This shit always spooked me out 
---
Pretty much all tracking perks with whispers, ruin, BBQ, nurses calling 
---
I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well
---
I'm in the same vein. When I read this I was thinking "so these are the guys that leave me on hook after I 5 gen loop a killer, neat"
---
I would petition to replace with Benny Hill Music, Yakety Sax: https://youtu.be/LUYbu5DJA1U
---
I mean practicing would be kinda pointless. You have to learn against actual players or there is no point, they dont play like bots
---
I would think if a survivor isn't being camped/chased at the moment, that more teams would just wait. The thing only lasts for two minutes. Usually, the killer just bounces back and forth on the two gates during the time, and so if you utilize some stealth in the remaining corners, those 2 minutes go by fast. 
---
Running to get the totem he can see or trying to get the gates while he chases someone else just feels like an unnecessary risk when you could just chill behind a barrel and let his advantage slip away.
---
Map layout, how for example the nurse blink works, distance measuring and so on could be useful to practice though
---
Ruin, ruin, ruin and ruin.
---
Only on console. Here on PC the only reason we won‚Äôt hit you twice is because we went to link the power to someone else.
---
I'm rather new, I assume Hex:Ruin is an insta-buy?
---
This had to come after I bought Hag in the sale didnt it :(
---
They should just hand you hatchets lol
---
Ruin is a needed park on killers others are all pretty meh
---
i guess what i‚Äôm trying to say is prestiging IS a single player action, it affects you and only you and has no impact on the way you interact with other players unlike the item glitch which impacts how you play the game. 
---
Let's team up! I'm a tryhard camper and a tunnling flaming kid despite playing survivor.
---
Vampires can be whatever race/gender e.c.t. That's why I was speculating they'd be a vampire as we don't have a vampire yet, Like what else could they be?
---
Has any non-streamer even been banned for the prestiege exploit lol.
---
Also yeah they need to punish holding hostage more.
---
Oh. Thought knockout already makes it so you cant see teammates.
---
Can Golden Coins be spent after the event ends. Is this the first time this event runs and otherwise, is it possible to keep the coins for the next year?
---
Holy shit, am i glad i stopped leveling hag.
---
Actually rewarded! 
---
It's not that bad tbh
---
Tombstone. Its a myers addon
---
Tombstone add on
---
I wouldn't use UE in general personally, but I'd drop botany for it
---
Dark in terms of light or mood? 
---
Yeah I hear that worked out great for friday the 13th
---
Spirit is inarguably top-tier, and arguably the 2nd strongest killer in the entire game, though the devs tend to fuck with the sounds a lot so it's a bit inconsistent since a single patch can make her completely unplayable.
---
Lost it at the nods
---
300 IQ strat
---
for your first point, good for you. there is a chance it does something. There is also a chance you 4man as freddy; it doesn't mean it is good. I too have used the perk and won because of it, but I have also won because of Deerstalker, and Territorial Imperative. NOED does fill a niche but it isn't good enough to be called a crutch, it is one of the easiest perks in the game to counter.
---
D-strike isn't a crutch either, I just think it is incredibly good and impossible to truly counter (you just have to be lucky or run Enduring which only softens the blow), NOED isn't even on the same level.  Not only that, but for NOED to work you have to get caught in the first place, for killer if he wants his points he *has* to eat the d-strike or get lucky.
---
My guess was maybe  something to do with steam trades.
---
Yep..... yep......... all survivors back on lvl 1... y√§i
---
That shape music would be scary af ü§©
---
I understand what you wrote as I stumble quite often on SWF groups even at killer rank 15. This is always a hell for me, as I‚Äôm not so good playing killer. The worst is when they bring 2 (or even 4!) flashlights. I also struggle a lot when 1 or 2 begin to run all around me while I chase one survivor.
---
This blind at pallet break happens all the time.
---
Then, when you finally get one down, it‚Äôs a DS strike and a flashlight blind.
---
Is there a good way to get some work done against such toxic teams ?
---
"This" being playful banter instead of 'toxic', also positive post chat.
---
I plan to make an album full of positive things like this, from launch of the game to now.
---
For context, last guy destroyed my devour hope instead of looking for the hatch, then teabagged me after I came towards him. It was pretty funny.
---
Can someone explain how decisive is a crutch? If you can hit the skill check, it gives you advantage no matter what the situation is. It always helps you, if you go down by hillbilly at the start of the game or if you‚Äôve ran him for 5 gens and the exit gates are open. Every perk in the game can be ‚Äùcrutch‚Äù when it works. 
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
I mean yes, I can do that. I also realise there are other players who are new, cant figure out the game, dont watch streams, or simply just arent great at video games. People like that may find a safety pip difficult because they cant last more that 5 seconds in a chase. Perhaps they get an unlucky spawn and dont know how to not get spotted right away. Just saying, this game isnt easy for everyone just because it is for some.
---
Have any of you ever done SWF and seen who can hide in a locker the longest?

---
They wouldn't get any survivor perks, just a whole slew of sneaky killer perks! Faking an injury to get survivors touching you to take them down silently. Sabotage gens? Work on gens and the progress goes down. Swap character? Pop in and out of a locker to change appearance into the player furthest away from you? There's so many ways to make him awesome. 
---
Devs fucked up as soon as they released his trailer.

---
I currently have just under 700 hours in this game.
---
Welp, no BBQ, but I did pick up Hag's DLC a the same time and Ruin showed up so i was technically right, the game will give me a perk i just paid for to spite me. I just picked the wrong perk.
---
What platform?
---
PC
---
I domt like the nurse period. The blinking doesnt work for me because im bad about losing sight on people and them hiding on me or getting away. 
---
Ok but killer can hear the voice too then, making it realistic and risky to speak when killer is near. But when you would just have to scream: "DWIGHT'S IN THE LOCKER!" to sacrifice your friends, so that's interesting but bad... or also screaming when killer come to make him deaf xD
---
Forget blood warden for a second you main legion?Mods, take him away.
---
I think the entity took her immediately
---
How does getting a teachable you already know get you BP? 
---
Some perks are green at max rank, not all are purple if that‚Äôs what your asking 
---
Oh oof I'm sorry. Also trust me in saying that around rank 8-5 is probably where you want to be. The further above 5 you are the longer queues are. At r1 when theres a lot of killers playing like a new killer or something? Don't even try lol. Oh but yeah instadowns are mostly kind of eh, especially if they hit essentially before a chase. To me, iridescent heads are pretty much the same as DS. Because in a good huntress' hands, iridescent heads only affects some situations, and in a bad huntress' hands well... they aren't hitting their hatchets or aren't using her to zone or threaten or anything like that. New silent spirit build? I haven't heard of it but spirit can feel bs sometimes and mostly its just people being really really good with understanding survivors' movement and thinking or being very lucky. Aw man hillbilly downing you from china must suck, dont think ive experienced it yet but that would be lame. Kinda part of why I dont like hillbilly, same as nurse, its too easy, it takes some skill to get over the first hump but after that its just too easy to enjoy. Like personally I'd say huntress is, design-wise, the best killer. If the game was only her as killer, it would be perfect. Her entire kit just works so well to dbd's strengths and skill ceiling and prediction and just, ugh, sorry to drag on, I just wish sometimes they'd take huntress' design philosophy to other parts of the game. As in, trying to play to the game's core, basic strengths and simple structure to find a huge amount of depth. For example, Huntress' hatchets allow good killers to predict survivors in areas of the map they cant see (a core part of being a good killer) and reward that ability with a hit, but its a risk since you're losing a hatchet no matter what, and her whole kit is perfectly designed around emphasizing the core aspects of dbd and not fucking with anything else. They dont add timers and status effects. Just hits, or misses, and a slightly slower speed.

One exeption: If you are running Small Game you are allowed to search it, but only one round around the map, after that it's not worth it.
---
That's okay, I keep getting matched up with survivors who kick my ass, so we're evening each other out in the metrics.
---
What it is horrible is that a high ranked goes killing low rank people and complains about it after.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, who? 
---
I vsed  slug nurse the other day. To me it's prob one of the most toxic plays out there. No one has fun because no one gets to play the game. Pointless.

I can hear the hum just by looking at it, so you have done a great job.

---
what if they added fuses for the gates like 12 each map scattered around you could collect at any point, and attach them to the gate (gates need 3 fuses to get opened). the fuses lighten more up for each gen complete making them easier to see. survivors can only carry 1 fuse at a time to prevent someone to collect all the fuses and troll everyone. wake up will be buffed to see the aura of all fuses when all gens are done. the action of planting a fuse into the gate is 3 seconds long (so killer have a window to prevent it, so it ain't to safe). 
---
when holding a fuse the aura of an exit gate is revealed to you, collecting a fuse will feed your objective bp and emblem.   
---
this is a mandatory objective you can do throughout the match, so there is more than just holding m1, and gives killers more time to kill the survivor instead of the game ending in 5-6 minutes, while also making killers late game a little better. in exchange i would reccomend a total rework or nerf of noed, since killers now would have a better end game

Since when is toxic wearing flashes or using DS?
---
Having NOED and BBQ is way more abusive...
---
Sorry, but no one left behind, I prefer to be the only one to die and save everyone than being selfish and surviving
---
I think you may be talking about RE3 where you give Nemesis a nice burning acid bath and he mutates into a monstrosity afterward
---
The Hillbilly add-on is pointless as it would counter any kind of decent play from the survivor. It would be a sucker punch of an add-on that would punish people who play well, look behind them to dodge the chainsaw sprint, and this would make it impossible. People would stop playing skillfully to evade the sprint and just go for the Huntress hatchet dodge scenario in case the Billy was using the add-on.  
---
  
---
The Nurse's add-on would make it impossible to use Dead Hard against Pocket Watch Nurses.
---
Or you could always just accept the obvious 3 man victory and still have a chance to take out the 4th survivor.  Slugging shouldn't be mandatory every game.  We don't have to sweat that hard do we?
---
Or, if they were a giving me a good run around, I‚Äôll carry them towards the hatch. They think I‚Äôm gonna let them have it before shaking my head and hooking them
---
Rocket launcher
---
I know, but who cares? It barely affects healing, my main point was describing Thanataphobia and its best, which is +14 seconds on a gen, which is still useless. 
---
Ruin is amazing.
---
Quick and Quiet is a surprisingly solid perk.
---
Thanatophobia is heavily over-rated as it does basically nothing.
---
Open Handed is very niche. 
---
Instablind flashlights were removed about a year ago.
---
Except on pre-school, where it's always in the basement of the school except that one time when you really need it to be there.
---
No need for small game,ruin totem already spawns in front of you at the start of the game.
---
Both are applicable. 
---
Survival of the Fittest, my fellow survivors.
---
Not that big of a deal, it's a pretty bad perk even on them
---
No but it will be 50x more annoying 
---
On PS4 this happens if the killer is that mad that they close the application, if they just leave the game then it counts as an escape &amp; you still get your points.
---
This is called karma
---
Yea, but it also slows you down a lot also. 
---
And remember - you'll lose all perks if you prestige. So if you have a P0 character with all perks at tier 3, maybe it's better to leave that character unprestiged.

Rank 12 still being way lower than the rank 1 you claim you are.

Anyways, rank is not related with toxicity. I have played against high ranked tunnelers and campers when being a low rank myself. That is a reason why I am leveling up Laurie to get DS.

Cosmetics that I pay will be removed?
---
Survive with friends 
---
Ain't that swell
---
U forgot freddie and doctor
---
as I said, not perks, the playstyle is what concerns the person commenting. just like literally any killer or survivor. me too. I hate when it's swf with more than 2 ds and them all working together via their party communication devices. any pack of randoms with ds, even if it's 4, I can't care less about. 
---
I say watch truetalent on youtube.
---
 Watch every movement he does as killer and he even teaches why he does them. Should get you high rank easily.
---
Message me if you got questions.
---
I doubt it, but I don't know. Just wait and you'll see for yourself.
---
Then they would know when they're close to you so they could use deep wound as a sort of whisperers. But then they could add it so Mending also stops the timer, but then they might need to shorten it aswell?
---
I read somewhere that you can use the coins for a little time after the event but not too long. I'm spending mine. 
---
You keep cosmetics you paid for
---
I thought that was balanced landing for a second and got excited :(
---
There was a basement bug just over a week ago that effected a fair few players and streamers where once you entered you would try and leave but be teleported back, got hotfixed last week.
---
I understand the devs will never rebuild the game for the exact reasons you stated but surely the rinse and repeat of bringing out 6 new perks a survivor and killer every quarter is enough to keep the player base going forever? 
---
The buff we need.
---
This literally makes no sense 
---
If everything is reset it does not matter, I did not pay the game and I rolled the game to 100% lmao
---
it would be neat if they could transform themselves into a bat though and have bats surround generators like a trap or something.
---
No! No! No! No!
---
He's alright.
---
Don't be this guy.
---
Always do gens.
---
Lol u so funny m8 eksdee
---
I want to see your accurate statistics about this please.
---
WE are groot. 
---
So what?
---
If anything, they should reset their accounts to the latest PTB snapshot before the bug, to avoid removing most stuff, but people shouldn't just get to keep their cheated progress.
---
You don't just get to whine and continue reaping the rewards of cheating.
---
Like the other guy said, they could just ban you which would effectively remove all that paid content anyway, as well as paid DLC and the cost of the game itself. 100 to 1 they're protected in these actions by agreements you agree to in order to play at all, so how bout just be thankful you're allowed to keep playing at all.
---
They are new (low ranks) and on console (hiding is more of a valid tactic) - I think everyone goes through this immersive phase for at least the first 50 hours of gameplay.
---
It's not too late for them to change... hopefully.
---
We had engine update not long ago, we'll have dedicated servers Soon^TM It's not all about content for devs, I think.
---
As for retaining players, I'd say new content is a major factor along with not breaking game (or fixing critical bugs fast).
---
ü§£üòÇ I hate that bitch though.
---
The chase music should be [this](https://youtu.be/Gd9OhYroLN0?t=26)
---
Hello Zepp would be amazing for the RBT it‚Äôs just very hard for them to get rights for the music, I think even the Saw game couldn‚Äôt get rights for it, would be amazing to have in game though!
---
K you convince me
---
Define tryhard.
---
So be sure to not bring Dstrike next round, because the Killer community is not as forgiving as I am, Commander.
---
Tell that to my rank 1 potato teammates that apparently did not get the memo.  So sick of carrying immersed urban premonition do nothing crawldettes in game.
---
It almost never takes that long.  They either find the hatch quick and the game ends or you find them and get your 4 man anyway.  If you know exactly where they are and you can end the game fast sure slug if you must but the killers that leave you slugged with no idea where last dude is are pretty toxic and just dragging out the loss the slugged survivor just wants to accept at that point.  It's about respect and not wasting peoples time 
---
Don't take it personal, and the game will become way less toxic.
---
I am so much laughing right know.  
---
Key Features
---
‚Ä¢	**Survive Together‚Ä¶ Or Not** \- Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?   
---
The original promotion to the game in the steam store. It is legit as fuck to do what ever you want in this video game except cheating. (slugging, tunneling, bodyblocking, camping, teabagging and all the "toxic" stuff including "toxic" perks like DS, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, NOED, etc.)   
---
BHVR Devs doing nothing. They want it to be like this. So you all should stop crying and hating so much, instead move one and fuck this bullshit ranking system.   
---
The only thing that matters are some perks, skill, SWF/notSWF. This game is unbalanced as FUCK and not even close to competetive. It's just a fun way to troll around. Don't take it serious at ALL.  
---
If you do, may  Allah/Jehovah/Yahweh/God or even the Entity help you.
---
I remember a time when doc was the most hated killer, good thing I don't have as bad of a rep anymore
---
All I know is I better not see you on an any advice subs, lol.
---
Except when you play survivor.
---
It's more fun and takes more skill than legion so his got that
---
Light. Depending on the room I can't see shit. 
---
That is just plain boring, I feel amazing when the gates are open, the killer is nearby and I still can save the last guy on the hook. Those moments when you can feel like a hero, not a coward, are the best. 
---
Depends on the player. I would let you leave (except if you were toxic)
---
&gt; You‚Äôre supposed to not chase the person if this happens right?
---
Wrong. If I'm near you when you're jumping off, I'll down you again.
---
&gt; That‚Äôs how I play. 
---
Good for you, just don't push your playstyle on others.
---
I feel like we need the context for this.
---
I find killer matches quick anytime of the day or night. It's survivor matchmaking that takes forever. We need dedicated servers ASAP!
---
You won't.
---
But it really helps. I don't care if killer camps me, because it's most probably his playstyle, not some kind of revenge for what I've done. I don't care if survivors teabag, because they're just wasting their time making my chase easier. As a result, I don't see DbD as a game with extremely toxic community. It works for me.
---
High tier with Frank's Mixtape, low tier otherwise
---
use an ebony mori next game
---
I save them for using as a pick-me-up
---
answer depends on who you ask
---
killer main would say: C-F Tier
---
surv main would say: S+++++ Tier
---
as a Legion main I highly recommend them especially for you since you don't have much bloodpoints they are by far the best bloodpoints farmer even with a 0-Kill game you'll get 25k bp because you simply hit survs so much getting the max score of 32k has become normal to me
---
Incorrect, Dwight was in the locker 
---
I always felt like Fuming Mixtape should sound something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNF5zJTAUI) lol.
---
&gt; worked hard enough to get to this point
---
*holding m1 for about 5 and a half minutes with the occasional spacebar press, maybe hold cntrl while behind a tree every now and then*
---
lol
---
On my first day of playing i got salty messages about me doing this or that and it wasn't satisfactory to how they think a killer should play. A couple of people got reported for harassment. To tell the truth I didn't do much but double back when he got unhooked and i rehooked him. Imo once a alert goes off for something like that or a generator you should leave the area. 
---
Sounds good, doesnt work
---
It was in shrine 3 months ago max, dont soil yer knickers m8
---
I leave with NOED. I am simply not that good at being chased. So I would always leave. But if no NOED and I am not the last one alive I will always go back. Yesterday me and my friends waited 5 minutes before we got out because we didn't know where the random was. He was healed up, so we left. When I switched to spectate the huntress just got to him. Felt so bad xD
---
Would love this so much 
---
Shouldn‚Äôt it be a common perk
---
Wait a sec... hasn't the game like dedicated server? You're telling me that the killer becomes automatically the host?
---
Nah, Dwight is da new Claudette
---
I had this happen to me on the Coldwind map with the barn.
---
I hid in a corner of the barn until they came to do the gen there. They'd done 3 gens before that point, so I hope they got really freaked out when I just popped out and smacked one of them.
---
However the rest of the game they just tbagged me, so I don't think they were very impressed.
---
yep, thats annoying as hell
---
You and I both know that Whispers, while can be more useful in the long run, require some... learning and some adjustment, if I may. BBQ is plain simple: you hook a person, you look around, you see 3/2/1 survivors at the certain areas. 
---
I can't even tell you how many times BBQ have won me the game only because I saw 3 survivors healing in a distance all together. After locating them, the match ended up pretty quickly. 
---
Again, I am not saying that you are not telling the truth. But this is a very rare instance of use of the perk. 
---
I have over 3000 hours in this game so don't fucking tell me 'I wouldn't have stuck around long anyway'
---
This grind is shitty and long and we are 100% innocent for doing this exploit BECAUSE IT GAVE US NOTHING BUT COSMETICS. We would still have to level everyone to 50.
---
That feng looks amazing
---
I think almost everyone starts playing with crawling or sprint while learning how to play.
---
This would be more concerning to me if the OP was a high rank XD
---
It's a mod from katversecc - it's called wooden floor cas background wf01 :)
---
There should be a perk in every web until you own each.
---
I DON'T GIVE A F-K IF LEGION MAKES ME START BLEEDING
---
Mix it up. I‚Äôm getting the cosmetics that I can mix and match with others, like Feng‚Äôs hair, Huntress‚Äô boar head and hatchet. Then Imm just working down from there, getting them all ideally.
---
It depends on the person. If you 4% in my face I would still hook you. It's disrespectful denying the killers job by undoing his sacrifice ;)
---
Nice job.
---
So, basically, they don't work how they're supposed to work. Sad oink.
---
And look what I get for it! Downvoted to heck! 
---
oh god a nea joke
---
If I remember correctly third seal doesn't allow you to see downed teammates because it gives you blindness 
---
r/insanepeoplefacebook
---
Self care should be replaced with maybe iron will or deliverance. 32 seconds and often 40 because of SB is too long to spend doing nothing. Half of a gen is more important and gets you closer to adrenaline. 
---
Spirit fury is better for most killers than noed.
---
You can call me all you like, I load into Red Forest agaisnt Doc on console, Im disco'ing.  My game time is limited and Im not spending it watching frames so bad it looks like a slideshow.
---
Oh shit but i say the first thing but sincerely :(
---
I got Huntress outfit and Ace hair, I don't want anything else. If I get more coins I guess I'll go for Fengs hair.
---
Last night i played 7 games in a row
---
All the seven games this hapenned:
---
First one to be found (if i wasn't the first to be found someone else would bring the killer to me and for whatever reason the killer would stop chasing a person that's hurt and chase me)
---
First one to be hooked because got hit for some bullshit crosswindow hit
---
First one to die since everybody was busy doing stuff
---
Alright misunderstanding I suppose. :p I just don't find Brown toolboxes nearly as bad as everyone in this thread seems to make them out to be. Doing 20% of your objective 30% faster helps to at least some extent.
---
Self care is pretty trashy
---
This is some maxium thinking emoji right there.
---
&gt; Hello there 
---
Gerenal Kenobi...
---
&gt; 1.6% of the surviors have bad internet connections. 
---
100% sure the root of these DC is "bad internet" ;)
---
So... by reading your stats we can say that it's not only "bad RNG", it's "programmed bad RNG"
---
I've been playing without taking any later a and when I play killer I only destroy the vessel if they are nearby and I've already 6 coins. Just play the game
---
Be careful with gens. Surveillance got buffed and Discordance is there. Also Spies got buffed, so if you're just walking behind a rock and the killer runs straight at you don't be surprised.
---
Aside from that everything is pretty much the same.
---
Game hasn't changed really. Small things, but expect the same overall.
---
* Self care is still meta defining.
---
* Borrowed time did get a nerf, so its not a free escape when the gates are open anymore.
---
* ruin is still far and away the best perk.
---
* Clown, Spirit and Legion all have some pretty sick perks.
---
* Surveillance Save the Best for Last and Sloppy Butcher are now good.
---
* Tinkerer's is a completely different perk.
---
* Trapper got an addon overhaul.
---
* hatch standoffs are still a thing.
---
* Hag is now good.
---
* Freddy is still garbage.
---
* Flashlights now no longer make you want to slit your wrists longways and put eels inside.
---
* you can play as Jesus now.
---

---
I get your first point and I agree with it to some extent, but not everything is supposed to be an achievement. Sure, you need to have some great challenges that only some people will complete and can show off, but you also need to have earnable cosmetics just for the sake of customization, regardless of if everybody gets it or not. 
---
Also a tedious long grind is not much of an achievement in itself, it just shows that you have time (or money in this case), does not really make it special.
---
Rank 1 cosmetics reward would be cool to have.
---
As for the second point, the key to success is not to blindly monetize everything, it's to monetize smartly.
---
Give some stuff free on a regular basis to hook the customer and keep him hooked, have some of the most appealing stuff behind a pay wall. That's how you maximize profits.
---
Blindly monetizing everything will leave a sour taste in some of your customer's mouths, and can be counter productive if they decide that you went too far with the greed and they don't want to support you anymore.
---
oh no why'd you downvote him...my poor boy.
---
Correction: it's an instrument of  p u n i s h m e n t ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Pardon?
---
Wasted bps smh
---
I started working on it before I finsihed my last post. I would say around a month
---
Might be win trading. Probably he thought you were premade with the last survivor and you let him get the hatch. 
---
I agree. Myers is shit against low rank but great at high rank. Love how they can‚Äôt see him and let you stalk lol. Not if you play her like tydetyme lol! He camps with hag in a game I played against 
---
Get Ruin. It might get taken out early or last mid game but it'll always give survivors another objective to do besides gens. Thana's debuff doesn't mean much in the long haul even if Legion is the best killer for capitalizing off of its effects.
---
i have some sort of stupid. can someone gimmie exaples of these three lol
---
Here's the greatest reason why this needs to happen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2IYpJQL01M

I lIkE wHeRe YoU'rE gOiNg WiTh ThIs
---
The real questions is. Why do you need so many remotes?
---
Spectators can only see what heir teammates already see. The only was spectating has come of any use to my SWF team is when we play with a guy who doesn't use a mic. When someone dies, they spectate that one guy and give the rest of the group the information that that one guy should already have been able to convey if they did use a mic
---
The thing is that I can run other killers around for minutes. But with the legion, even if I know exactly how to outplay the killer at shack for example, it doesn't matter because he just jumps through the window with his ability and hits me. His ability completely removes all sort of mindgames that is required of a good killer. It's not fun when the only option you have is to "waste as much time as possible" but eventually you go down regardless of how perfectly you play each tile because of the cheesy deep wound mechanic. That's just bad game design.
---
No one gives a fuck about randoms if their on a time limit 
---
Do what you want! Don't let us *nerds* boss you around! That's an order!
---
Jokes aside IMO the Feng skin.
---
I'm a Huntress main but IMO she has better AND according to you, you don't play her that much.
---
Yeah I agree. I know it sounds shittg but I usually just end up leaving right away as soon as the exit doors are open. Too risky...
---
Good job!
---
gen rush but not breaking totems? thats a noed for ya
---
Went for Aces hair, working on the full Feng outfit then going for Huntress axe if I get that far. Never see killer so I can't justify the cosmetics myself.
---
But the rush you get when that T3 Evil Within jam kicks in is so worth it.
---
At 3000hrs are you still grinding??? 
---
I'm not asking you to give them a kidney.
---
Yes. The grind in this game is insane.
---
Well opening a chest is fairly easy and it doesn‚Äôt exactly benefit the whole team, like gens or totems.
---
I like the idea of a blind killer. Like, imagine if there was a killer who could only hear, so they could only see survivors when they're running, working on Generators, wounded, or very close. Survivors would have to hold very still, while the killer ran past them. Could be so creepy. \^\_\^
---
Sorry if that's basically what you said. TLDR.
---
Runs WGLF: One Hook Facecamp. 
---
Takes off WGLF: Iridicent Benevolent within the first 80 seconds of the game. 
---
*My poor boy. Look at what they‚Äôve done to him.*

---
Nah. You unhook near me and Ill throw ya back up. Unless I actually signal ill let you go if you 4%
---
I‚Äôm  just saying if you load into a game and they are needed to help a family member or something of the sort their likely to dc 
---
Sorry, every game I play as killer, my no1 target is ALL vessels. I have a 90% rate at least!
---
It kinda looks like a-[AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH](/intensifies)
---
I don‚Äôt get the joke lol
---
I've never seen a Legion that would work on and I've played against and as Legion. Hasn't worked on anyone I've played against and hasn't worked on me.
---
Legion has a terror radius. They already know you're close to them.
---
I didn‚Äôt know about this exploit but no wonder I‚Äôve been seeing p3 nurses with 5 blinks and noad and still couldn‚Äôt get hits. And this whole time I thought I was the shit juking baby p3 nurses. 
---
I can see this getting as many votes as shirtless Myers, but still doesn't happen.
---
Is that why he always target David first every time he shows up with Jake? Can't handle the competition? 
---
Maybe beating you is fun?
---
I mean the killer can see when they're close to the survivor by seeing that the timer has stoped.
---
Just run Rancor lmao. Ignore your obsession all game and just 0 counterplay Mori them at endgame, 4head
---
Upvotes for Tofu

Why ruin now when I just went on a spending spree

Incoming "Deleted: Off Topic"
---
Here: Let me smol Billy your Postymon.
---
Ily LOL
---
Well they are dumb. First cleanse the no Ed totem and then go for the save 
---
He also runs around with ten traps. 
---
Some audio cues would be nice too
---
Yis.  Gooey tyrant 
---
Hell yeh and I had to wait a loooong time for him to stop looking. If he was smart he would have stopped for 3mins then patrol again and found my 99%gen and my 2nd gen. Other pro tip. Assume they have whispers. Urban emmersion near them as they patrol and they will never be able to pinpoint where you are with it.. lol "the closer you are to danger, the further you are from harm."  As you can I got to solo alot 
---
Here is in my opinion the order you should get these perks:
---
Hex: Ruin
---
Quick and Quiet
---
Thanatophobia
---
Openhanded

---
Thanks. Someone also told me I should swap no one left behind for Hope?
---
Killers camping generators. Which is bannable.
---
I know...
---
Above comment isn't wrong. It is a good song. 
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll try this out
---
Kate with her Alpine outfit. That outfit makes her look like Lara Croft and that is the only reason I chose to main Kate.
---
Okay, this got a lot more attention than I first anticipated, so, let's try to spread this?
---
He‚Äôs not a good killer really. But you just hard focus one person until they die and then the exit gates get powered. No skill expression in his kit, right click and press w until you hit survivors. He needs to stay a shit tier killer imo
---
I'd run Self-Case &amp; Borrowed Time. Then it depends. Plunderer Will give you great items from the chests most of the time, so if you want to collect good items that's a good one. You could go Empathy + Botony, so you can see injured survivors, and heal them faster with Botony. 
---
Sorry. But the only guy that gets to blast Jake with any sticky substance is David. 
---
Yes. People have had literally everyone in their roster reset and theres no way for them to get it back.
---
Isn‚Äôt it better to have self care at the lower ranks though? Cuz teammates are kinda clueless
---
Not even close to how good dead hard is 
---
Slows down a lot. I hate to walk like a zombie all the time. 
---
Imagine save the best for last with this
---
The stats seems to not be as random as it should be?
---
Having just over 50% chance to remove your trap on the first try seems wrong to me. Shouldn't it be 25% per attempt?
---
Also, you should do the 5 Jigsaw Boxes variant. 
---
..or the 6 one, if you feel extra masochistic.
---
Most good killers don't usually remember that you have dead hard. It's all about memory and less about how good you are at this game. 
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Now it increases the chances
---
Maybe use it until you get Adrenalin.
---
I can‚Äôt remember if Adrenalin is a basic perk or someone‚Äôs teachable so you‚Äôll have to check.
---
Imo a speed boost at the end of the game isn‚Äôt wort sacrificing a perk that could help you all the way through the game. Half the time killers bounce from gate to gate at the end of the match so hope isn‚Äôt worth it long term.
---
Switch it for we will make it
---
My issue isnt in people losing cheated progress, its in being scammed out of paid content without any way of getting help. Its happened to a close friend of mine already. He lost his access to paid survivors and killers.
---
No, fuck RNG lol. You get a second chance to survive if you 4%, not a free escape
---
"So, you wanna heal, huh? Here, have a brown toolbox"
---
If you earned the rage quit it counts as a kill, prove me wrong
---
You are totally wrong. Dead hard can be used when you thought you could make an extra loop but you knew half way that you were wrong.  So, I just start going back and believe me, 99% of the killer will just swing at you when you go towards them. Press dead hard. Make it to the pallet. That extra loop is all it takes for me to keep making more loops at other places. At least in my experience, no other exhaustion perk has come close to being that useful. The drive to make that one extra loop is always there in me. So, I need a perk like dead hard. 
---
Get what you like of each outfit. You don't have to get it as a whole. I like the dress of huntress, but i already got a nice head and axe cosmetic.  
---
I personally went for the full feng as I liked that outfit the most. But if you play killers more you might enjoy the huntress skin more when you need to do her daily rituals etc. 
---
If you actually bothered to read the post, youd see that
---
1. This isn't about me. In fact, I really didnt lose much.
---
2. Some people have just had entire paid killers and survivors just locked back up from them despite paying for them with no explanation from BHVR.
---
3. This did not happen to me, meaning that their entire process was super inconsistent and proves nothing except that they had no idea how to handle a situation like this.
---
One last thing. Am I a bad person for this somehow? I got a P3 bill, then literally never equipped the skin. Why does that suddenly make me a horrible person who cant have any opinions on anything despite me owning/playing for longer than most people currently playing this game? I wanted a cool skin, and I didnt have nearly enough time to get it myself. I saw an oppurtunity so i took it not knowing the consequences. I lost almost everything for it. I accept that. But how am i suddenly a bad person for doing one thing in my over 2 years of owning and playing this game and then asking that bhvr atleast be consistent with their punishment? Did i ruin the game for someone else? Did i get infinite bloodpoints through cheats? I just wanted interesting skins for survivors despite not having money for it. Im not malicious.
---
My team of 3 was paired with a rando that found the key and spent the entire game looking for the hatch when we had only one gen and we lost. Some times putting yourself first does not always work.
---
Yeah but it's not. There is more than 1 gen always, and camping a single gen is thus NOT holding the game hostage. Camping is NOT bannable.
---
Cosmetic exploiters deserve bans as much as other. What they really should spend time on is the DC first 5 seconds in the game.
---
Killers shouldn't be judged based on addons. It's all up to their base power. 
---
Atleast Nurse takes practice and skill. 
---
They are not gonna fix Claudette lol
---
Yeah, Daddy Myers can come for Dwight instead...
---
Maybe your computer is too far from the router, have you tried moving it close? 
---
fuck ill just kill em. i dont want to just sit there and do nothing
---
A truly fine display of mental gymnastics to justify cheating.
---
We can try, but I think in the end, it doesn't really matter.
---
just a little bit? 
---
Same, nearly fell off my chair 
---
Nea = killer confirmed 
---
My general thought process:
---
If you get chased, you will probably run the killer until all gens pop and heal via Adrenaline
---
OR
---
You get downed, therefore hooked or slugged, which means you either die without a chance yo heal, or get saved, in which case a teammate will heal you.
---
So rarely do you have a time to actually use the perk + with how common Sloppy Butcher and mangled in general is, it often takes so long you're better off working on gens (if you have Adrenaline that is, if you don't then the perk is fine, I prefer doing Botany + Medkit for consistent healing though).
---
I would have
---
well with prayer beads it's a diffrent thing but without it puts you in a slight disadvantage since only people in the Terror Radius of your Husk are not gonna hear you phasing. Also when you start phasing the chase will mostly stop.
---
If you tunnel with Freddy then you are playing wrong. I don't particularly say that you tunnel but overall fact that tunneling with Freddy is bad. Freddy main BTW. Sorry for my terrible English, I'm russian
---
Borrowed time is the best perk you have. Selfcare is good for beginning players, then hope, empathy, botany are all useful

Ah yes, how could I say no to 2 seconds extra for opening the gates. Even with Sloppy Butcher it's just not worth it, healing with SB and Thana is basically the same as healing with SB alone, not to mention you need to have more than 2 survivors injured to even make it almost worth or the fact that it becomes weaker each time you kill a survivor.
---
The math just tell us it isn't really worth at all, even Remember Me buys you more time
---
inb4 obligatory NOED comment
---
I appreciate these posts. People were skeptical of the limited dataset last time so it's good to see another. I wonder if the devs would ever look at this data or comment on the issue since it seems pretty unfair to ol' piggy girl. Weighting the stats so the last box key is the least likely outcome by some small margin seems a bit fair, but 50% on the first box (or roughly 50/50 chance for each box if I'm interpreting the stats right)? That's insane.
---
currently at rank 1 as killer, I decided to keep bringing an ebony mori until I find a lobby without a DS user... I'm almost out of mori offerings :/
---
Lol doesn't matter when you down them the second time they'll just DC and say that you're hacking 
---
The envelopes only give you extra bloodpoints, not the moonrise ones
---
Personally I‚Äôve gotten to use self care A LOT in my rank. Every game I use it about 4 or 5 times

---
Hey dude, guess what. I didnt justify it. Honestly i deserved to lose what i did. I just wish i could say the same about a lot of my friends, who lost an excessive amount more, and for seemingly no reason.
---
How do you just get to that question? 
---
At this point BHVR is just shooting themselves in the foot because most of the people that did the glitch are people that buy dlc and cosmetics from them. 
---
I agree that I it shouldn‚Äôt go unpunished but what they‚Äôre doing right now is just thinning out their active playerbase. Pushing away any number of your best customers is never a good business idea
---
 ( Õ°O Õú ñ Õ°O)
---
As for me, I think devs either have to remove matchmaking or to give SWF groups much higher rank killers. So 20/20/1 group gets 8 rank killer, not 17 or 18.
---
No...Not Ruin again
---
Every Survivor game is shit after one of these
---
Yep. If this test data is reliable (and 500 seems good enough), this **tremendously** increases the odds that the key to a RBT is not 'hidden in a box', but the game simply flips a coin on each completed box to determine whether it had the key.
---
Because yeah, otherwise the odds should be far closer to 25% and not instances of 0.5^x
---
Not gonna lie, I remember Freddy getting the same treatment. 
---
just applies at the end of each month tho, and not even then for sure
---
Because it saves your ass when you fuck up, that's the definition of a crutch (I'm pretty sure). 
---
Holy shit, youre the first person to acknowledge that most of the people who did the exploit are just normal players like you or me, not malicious hackers hoping to ruin the game forever.
---
Finally, another cat huntress fan!
---
It always spawns there when I'm survivor, but never when I need it to be there as a killer
---
I'm pretty sure you're ure just covering up how he was right. 
---
On the other hand though, the killer can‚Äôt break the lantern if you‚Äôre carrying it.
---
Thats the guy in green isn't it?
---
Because you're both ignorant, dribbling isn't toxic in any way. 
---
Adrenaline is a Meg teachable 
---
Empathy is very good with We‚Äôll make it. You get one unhook and then go around the map and heal two more people.
---
Just level up Nea, she's a free character 
---
I did mention that, y'know, I suck at this game.
---
The devs know removing SWF would destroy the player count which would hurt everyone.
---
But we do have with Tapp. :)
---
Swf aren‚Äôt all bad. My friend recently bought the game. He wanted to get something we could play together while stationed in another country. 
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm one of those rank 1s grouped with a 15. But that didn‚Äôt really matter. I‚Äôm not using perks to fuck with killers. DS is pretty cancer. I am guilty of looping a killer the entire game... but that‚Äôs their own fault for not breaking the chase.
---
There are toxic 12 year olds, and there are chill mfs everywhere. 
---
I can understand rank 1 love though. Finally hit it yesterday as survivor. I got a leatherface who didn‚Äôt face camp or tunnel. Intentionally went after someone that wasn‚Äôt on last hook. Everyone won that game. 
---
When I play low rank survivor, I just sigh. 
---
Ok so I‚Äôm fairly new, rank 17 killer. I just got a game where all 4 survivors had purple flashlights and Add-ons and did nothing but surround me blinding me the whole game until I rage quit. How tf do I counter that? Every time I got one down I just got flashed while picking him up.

I've never played as or against legion but I think this could be the best thing for the game

Hello people of the fog!

When can we expect to see licensed related DLC cosmetics? Any recent word about it?

With bloodhound.

is this witchcraft?

Probably be way too strong for someone like Nurse
---
This is a screenshot from a Monto video, right? 
---
I never go tryhard against 3 people, if one DC's very early or fails to load in. That said, I've had people bitch me out, and have the other 3 people rage quit to complain in post-game, because they wanted me to play seriously.
---
LMAO. We call the one where wiggling does less "grip of a lifetime". We've used it so long I honestly forget the actual name.

Lol it‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll upvote you!

We‚Äôll just make our own!

how does it have to do anything with my post? 
---
I didn't shit on anything in particular, I just said that it's weird that people de-rank cause games are trash and most people are more toxic than those on red ranks. they always say red ranks are sweaty or whatnot but they're literally less toxic and frustrated. 
---
where did I say anything of swfs being all the time bad? I said specifically of those who were cocky or disrespectful in the game, with those I'd play however I liked. 
---
Yeah, I expect it'll blow over eventually. 
---
It seriously would be the death of the game. People talk about like they're coming up against top tier swf every game but that's really not the case. Even if you run into 5 swf back to back maybe one of them is a well coordinated team. You need to exploit their altruism while not camping. They always have weak players. If you can down the one good player they have early and hook them they all kinda scramble. Theres lots of ways around it but sometimes it's a possibility to get outplayed. I think a lot of people have created this idea in their mind if its swf then theyll lose and that messes them up.
---
Ah okay. Well I would still prefer auras over the fire because you have to physically walk there instead of just looking into the distance and knowing which is which.
---
A green key with no add-ons? Please tell me :D
---
I feel r/outoftheloop on this one
---
Slow the game down **JUST A LIL BIT**
---
Just seeing you makes ppl wanna dc 
---
Fact: I switched DS for Plunderer and SB for BT or Ace in the Hole and honestly? Best Decision I have ever made.
---
yeah what the hell
---
I wish to consume hot dog from off of your face.
---
Some adam cosmetics are dark. He is bigger for sure, but it feels like he has lighter skin. At least he's visible when p3, claudette is already hard to see, and p3 claudette is even worse cause of the blood
---
Good to see the killer Gang is still around. I do wonder what happened to the killer cults....like Zappy bois, Sweaty boi and the like
---
I never dodge unless a 4 man SWF joins, those matches are never fun. Other than that I never have reason to. 4 flashlights? Lightborn. 4 toolboxes? Hangmans. 3+ items? Franklin's. I just play for fun, but 4 man suck the fun from the game for me, or if I have a spare tombstone fragment I won't dodge &lt;3
---
Pig is all about controlling tempo and slowing the game down. Crouch is slower but can be used on surprise pallet mind games with her speed burst and landing that first game hit.
---
they cant Change anything without making her useless tbh
---
That's happened a couple of times. It's called Karma. 
---
same...lol
---
Yes
---
you are slow
---
Besides that, getting off the hook can cause the killer to lose a lot, if not all, of their map pressure. The RNG in that is stupid, but I guess that's a part of this RNG-filled game.  
---
I wouldn't let pretty much anyone leave for free just because they got lucky, assuming all survivors attempted escape, you'd have 48%(3*0.04*4) chance of a survivor escaping - that's almost every second game.
---
Lack of punctuation made his quite difficult to understand.
---
You can get up there
---
She needs to be completely reworked in my opinion.
---
Damn! I did not know that. Thanks for the tip
---
In my experience, in solo queues you'll waste half of your WMI timer to catch and heal unhooked survivor. 
---
yeah i also feel that
---
you completely and utterly missed the point of my post, haven't you? 
---
I was ranting about people who de-rank or shit on red ranks, fam. not that "boo-hoo noobs dunno how to play". and assumed that those who shit on red ranks are boosted lamers. 
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt what BHVR is hoping gain from this course of action. If I lose everything for duping like 20 BPS then so be it but I won‚Äôt be putting forth anymore money or time into the game. I‚Äôm only one person but if they go resetting everyone then they‚Äôre gonna lose a lot coupled with the negative responses to the lunar event.
---
Meh, nurse is the equalizer. Rather see them buff other killers to make them more viable at red ranks (your wraith for example) rather than nerf the anti swf killer.
---
Make her gay
---
Thank you for actually linking the source and giving credit
---
Wait are you trying to tell me that I am not blending into my dark envirement when I am wearing a bright white coat? 
---
He hit me once and chased me without looking at me so the game wouldn‚Äôt register it as a chase thus making the timer go down. He‚Äôs broken.
---
Username checks out. 
---
ITT: Folks who got banned for exploiting try to justify it, and cry foul when they have to face the consequences. 
---
I agree. In a game where the only thing between the survivors and the killer are pallets and windows, teleporting is a stupid idea
---
Don't tell anybody this, but...
---
^^I ^^did
---
They made it even worse by giving her that dark brown shirt cosmetic like wtf lmao
---
that'll work
---
There‚Äôs always a translator lmao
---
It literally is. If anything Enduring is the one that's not really a true counter as it dosent stop DS from activating rather it merely lessens the impact of it. Dribbling straight up prevents DS from being used.
---
The idea of hitting them twice is more of a form of insurance.  You can‚Äôt always guarantee that you‚Äôll be able to standard hit them, so at least you know that if you have to Frenzy down them, it‚Äôll only take two more hits, not three. 
---
but a Killer without any add ons would be badly designed.. :D
---
Not charge speed, blink movement one.
---
Yeah I know it's the new killer and everything, but I fail how to see how it's even a consideration for a visually-designed killers commendation. It's just a guy in hoodie. And when you have the likes of Spirit...
---
exactly.  Swf groups always risk everything to for hook saves, body blocks and other really stupid moves.  Like poor flashlight saves, firecrackers...easy hits boys, easy hits all day long and the best part is they arent doing gens while all of this is going on
---
I got a -rep for ‚Äúwallhacks‚Äù when I was scratched mirror Myers....
---
Now all your friend is here........
---
I had like 6 games in a row where someone DCed pretty much right at the start, so I just farmed with the remaining ones and let them escape.
---
It's up to your killer. I tend to let them go if they 4%, mainly because I know I would like the courtesy done to me. Most killers don't, but that's their choice. They have no requirement or incentive to let you go. In fact, them letting you go is them giving up BP.   
---
So, if you let people go for that 4%, that's cool, and you've got a few others like myself that let the 4%ers go. Just be aware that a vast majority of killers don't give a damn about your 4%, and, honestly, why should they? 
---
oh okay
---
well, thats a good point, but if you combine that with add ons like Cold Dirt and Joeys Mixtape and bodyblock them, its pretty safe to get that hit
---
Removed for unrelated to dead by daylight 
---
[reeee](/intensifies)
---
Thanks, I can finally understand half the posts on the sub now lul.
---
That‚Äôs the exception, yes. 
---
I dunno, I find him fun to play as, trust me when I say you survivors would rather I play Legion instead of nurse, 
---
Well, that's the only change that wouldn't make her useless that I can think of.
---
Once a nurse player reaches a certain skill level, they can‚Äôt lose, that‚Äôs a problem, 
---
Actually whit the new sistem you cant get the pip and rank up even if you didnt escape, however is true that sometimes you cant save everyone
---
If there's no hook nearby within 10 m you're screwed
---
He WAS the last survivor though and i didn't simply let him hop in either
---
Wow you let someone escape youre so trash smh
---
I was in this same boat last night. I was at 395/400, and I said 1 more game. Got tunneled and killed after 1 Gen for a +4 and a 399/400. 
---
I‚Äôm you cheated, you should feel lucky they still let you play at all. 
---
The most boring for sure.
---
I'd rather play a killer I have a chance of surviving a chase against than none. I'd rather have an ability(if slight) of countering the killer, which is why I don't like going against Legion. All they do is either down you in a predetermined amount of time or make you hold M1 for a little bit, go hold M1 on a gen, hold M1 to mend and repeat, what I find very boring.
---
I'd argue we should make more killers viable at rank 1 than nerf either of the 's tier killers (nurse and billy) especially before a nurse nerf is implemented 
---
Your handwriting is terrible so it is no wonder that you tried to Photoshop it in, but even then you failed miserably.
---
Each of you have good reasons to hide your face behind some stupid mask.
---
Ah I love her
---
You‚Äôll go down much much faster against a nurse. 
---
Yeah, a perk stopping you from being downed, then a killers ability stopping you
---
Geez is that for me or Legion? I just used my thumb on my phone screen so you can‚Äôt expect much ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I managed to get a 4 kill as Myers because I was getting looped all game, but essentially broke most of the pallets while losing all my gens. 5th gen pops, I go tier 3, hook someone, get a second person which procs Blood Warden, and then get the last 2 guys on the exit.
---
Because all the other killers are gross, monsters, undead, underage, or pedophiles while he us an absolute UNIT who isn't afraid to check out that ass. I doubt just his evil goes up üôÇ
---
Then she's just a regular killer. Why even blink at that point  it would be like a worse huntress
---
Thanks for sharing this for people who never saw it, good on you mate
---
That's not a bad idea you have there...
---
You probably got those ranks because of SWF but surprising to see survivors saying "gg" to a Nurse.  
---
If you like using add-ons I'd have to recommend Omegablink(double range) to you.
---
Good man.
---
I'm only explaining why people don't like him I personally don't care too much one way or the other. I don't like being tunneled by Legion because he's basically impossible to lose, but if he wants to focus me, that's on him.
---
I got to rank 1 with Legion last month (well, and Nurse), and a lot of that also has to deal with just being super annoying by constantly stabbing people with DW, and then going out of Frenzy to try and route them into an area where you can down them normally, but if a survivor knows you're doing that, it's not hard to counter play.
---
On that note. Could we also have some sort of priority given to healing others over other actions? I constantly start self caring instead of healing someone else, or doing a gen. Last night I ran saboteur for a daily and unhooked someone and tried to sabo 3 times when the prompt said heal.
---
Best shrine in the past couples of weeks. All very good perks
---
Killer tier list is
---
Billy and spirit
---
Huntress and hag
---
Clown and myers

Everything else is pretty bad

I prefer whispers to strider, personally. I start thinking I hear things with strider and they turn out to be nothing. YMMV.
---
I also have recently started using Bitter Murmur. Rancor is cool because of the free mori, but the freeze-frame survivor outline it provides after a gen is done is useless. I already know there was a survivor there, how else would the gen have gotten done? BM gives me auras for a few seconds and let's me know where they're going, not where they were. It's like BBQ (for gens not hooks),  but without the BP bonus.
---
Best killer perks are ruin, BBQ, enduring, spirit fury, nurses calling and whispers
---
Survivors the only real change is self care is now mediocre 
---
To be honest, to this day I still have no idea why they made the nurse in the first place. Shes the only killer that completely ignores all in game map mechanics (legion still has to go around walls). The very essence of her character makes her overpowered right off the bat.
---
 She can get to one side of the map like billy but also clip through multiple floors as well. The top tier nurses I play against legit never lose. I can't see them nerfing her without destroying the character. 
---
He's about pig/LF tier in my opinion 
---
After blinking you can chain another blink before you get stunned, or you can try to hit someone before the stun.
---
However, you will always get stunned in the end
---
Mad respect. All hail the Dwight king!
---
I haven't played as Legion, only against, but I entirely agree. 
---
Additionally, I think it's kind of sad to see so many people proclaiming Legion to be a scourge when I can tunnel infinitely better as a Freddy - and I can do it to whomever I want, in whatever order, one right after another. 
---
You're half right.
---
Dribbling can be effective in making survivors not use DS, but it definitely isn't reliable. Say you're on a big open map like Rotten Fields or a map with a lot of walls and crap in the way like Lery's and dribbling just won't work since you won't be able to get them to a hook before they struggle out.
---
In reality, there really is no good counter to DS. FeelsBadMan.
---
YEET
---
I mean, it's probably what they'll do if they ever change the nurse.
---
It's not a good perk. You need to hook someone after the gates are open, and then have it be relevant in that relatively small 1 minute window. If they open the gates afterwards, it's a wasted perk. If they see that it's happened and then just disappear until it wears off, it's a wasted perk. If you catch them all rushing the hook anyway, it's a wasted perk. Occasionally you'll get this situation where somewhere will rush the gate on the assumption that it doesn't matter if they're seen as long as they make it there, and you'll get a kill you otherwise wouldn't, but a lot of stars have to align for that to happen, and you've still spent the game with a dead perk slot. If you'd taken Spirit Fury to go with Enduring instead, you might have knocked that same guy out in the mid game, and then you could've snowballed from there, rather than praying for an end game Hail Mary.
---
Please dont, I really dont like the toxicity in the game or sub. I will promote dcing if you get d striked then they t bag instead of even trying to run. 
---
How do you see when people give you -rep?
---
Thatnatophobia is a terrible perk ruin is miles better 
---
So DCs are cool if the killer isn't playing the way you want them too, but not cool if the survivors don't like how you play killer?
---
Unless the person was playing in a very stupid manner (trying to mess with the killer after gates are open), I never leave anyone behind, even if i know I'll probably die. I just don't like leaving anyone behind, and I don't blame people for leaving me.
---
She wouldn't be normal. Blinks itself wouldn't change but you couldn't use them as often. Maybe make it only have cooldown while in chase or have smaller cooldown when not in it. This would make her not as impossible to fight against. Now, you can only run, run, and run. But if she is very good you will only ru... and will be downed. If she misses she waits few seconds and can continue. With this change she would be punished and would have to wait.
---
I mained him first.

---
That's a keyboard clicking 
---
So from 75% of the sub then
---
I got flashed too many times in my last match to be so kind.  After I dropped the final Claudette, I carried her to a hook right NEXT to the hatch, then went and broke a lantern for good measure.
---
I'm just joking, I never DC. Besides I run enduring so DS isn't the end of the world
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Honestly, I wish more that the Phone on Lery‚Äôs would let you pick it up and listen to The Entity. 
---
RIP Dwight
---
YES YES YES!  OH MY GOD!
---
Imagine being so bad at smacking survivors you need built in unrelenting.
---
Thats a good thing
---
Was playing against a spirt when the same thing happen, jumped a window thinking ‚Äúoh just one hit I‚Äôll have time to run‚Äù *haunted grounds cleansed* ‚Äúfuck‚Äù

Only 300k?

I spent 700k just to lvl a killer for the teachables
---
Template?
---
Wrong
---
You are a champ! Some people will dc faster than lightning over nothing and then we have you just dealing with it. You are the Hero we dont deserve but should all aspire to be. No need to feel bad about it, the only people who would not have dcd after that are the ones that dropped or threw their controller/mouse in a reflex... btw I hope kitty is feeling better now.
---
You got an ID to go with that permit?
---
People you exploit to get the bloody cosmetics (hardest bass game cosmetics to acquire), people who exploit to max prestige, and survivors who hide in a locker or somewhere in the map after the gates are open for an indefinite amount of time, pretty much the single most toxic thing you can do in this game, usually hoping to forge the killer to DC so they can join a new game, which causes them to lose all rewards 
---
Third seals also good because you cant see hooked survivors 
---
Where where the numbers confirmed ?
---
why do people overreact like that? especially with a cute piggie
---
That‚Äôs so lame. First time it‚Äôs happened to me though so I thought it was a glitch or something. Thanks.
---
I assume you play console?
---
These sociopaths go into your steam profile and leave comments, note that -rep in steam culture is for cheaters and scammers mainly.
---
Player stats during the bans stayed a consistent 3000 below average. This heavily insinuates that those missing players were temp banned for the exploit.
---
Idk if this is good enough, comment again if somethings wrong: https://imgur.com/pVhGDDZ
---
Getting downed isn‚Äôt always fucking up and the perk rarely ‚Äùsaves your ass‚Äù, it just gets you and your team extra time 
---
how was it a 180 when i went in a full circle?!?!?
---
At this point, I don't know what I would fix if I was in control. I know, deep down, I'd probably make things way worse.
---
That's the exact reason why they're bad
---
[Wich way do you loop this](/intensifies)
---
I physically can‚Äôt play against Doc bc of migraines and the shock flashing triggers them almost immediately. DBD is one of the few games I can play bc there‚Äôs no other flashing and it‚Äôs generally dark. (The police car on the Myers map does it too but I can avoid that/close my eyes). With Doctors shock, I‚Äôm useless so I have to either hide in a locker or immediately DC.  90% of the time I hide in the locker but I feel like a jerk.  
---
There‚Äôs no solution to this issue unless the game allowed us to block a killer from rotation and I don‚Äôt see that happening, so if you see DCs or someone hiding in a Dr game they may be me, just trying to avoid days of actual physical agony.
---
I had 2 dc at the start of a match. Decided to let both of remaining survivors farm until 3 gens were left, killed one, and gave the last one a lantern and the hatch. Next thing I know I'm getting a message from the one I killed that I'm going to get banned for working with survivors. It's been over 48 hours and I just got another message that he has a "direct line" to the devs and I will be banned shortly. Not trying to make any point just thought it was a funny story. 
---
Truly disgusting
---
you didn't...
---
Well, 3-blink nurse was the default setting (if I recall right). Thus the achievement to blink 3 times before hitting someone was do-able without add-ons. 
---
Also, don't forget the Nurse is slower than a running survivor. 
---
Well that's good then isn't it ? if he plays that way he loses. Same with camping/tunneling.  Just keep punishing these people with gens and they will eventually have to chase others too or quit playing.
---
I spent well over a million on her just for ruin...
---
Bloodwarden is the fucking best. It's not a great perk, but it's great for all those moments when you can tell they thought they made it out, then the panic starts to set in.
---
"Cheater" yeah dude, its not like all he did was use a bug to get bloody skins because he thought they looked cool. Yeah hes a horrible person, not just a normal player like you or me. My issue isnt with him being punished for it. Its the fact that BHVR got to (seemingly) randomly pick and chose what kind of punishment these people got rather than just doing to everyone what they did to me.
---
Thats a different scenario. Nobody is being toxic here, the killer just dcs as soon as the gates get powered knowing we will escape with a vessel, just because he probably didnt make enough points to his liking.
---
No worries, mate. I'm getting downvoted, too.. But I agree with you entirely. If I dodged every time I saw the same tired ass P3 Claudette running DS, people would rage shit themselves. 
---
Your message is sound, and the fact that we have a post actively encouraging toxicity via DC is nasty. 
---
people look at it for 2 secs then dont think cos its the internet and dont realise its sarcasm
---
I HATE HIM TOO, ALSO; I WAS FIRST
---
I CANT WAIT FOR DEDICATED SERVERS SO ALL THE KILLERS WITH BAD CONNECTION WONT BE ABLE TO HIT ME THROUGH A WALL ETC
---
I do agree with you honestly. I hate when ppl just dc for no reason. It annoys me to see when survivor or killer DC cause something happens they do not like 
---
This sub is mostly survivors. It's crazy that people think otherwise
---
I played him between ranks 20 and 7 and almost always got 4 kills. I found him fun to play. I just go use my ability and hit everyone I can and it wastes alot of their time to heal themselves.
---
You got a certificate for that permit cunt?
---
Both the Wraith and Leatherface are somewhere in the bottom four characters, along with the Trapper and Freddy. That's been the same for a long time, so I doubt that's a huge surprise to you.
---
I have to agree, the edit isn't that good. No in game sounds and the music just doesn't match up with the gameplay.
---
I'm all for checking out new DBD videos but put some effort in bud  :)
---
My favorite is when Trapper steps in his own traps whilst carrying you
---
Green broken keys rely on add ons. These add ons will either show you your allies or the killer. My favorite addons for this are the yellow beads to add 15 sec and the blood amber to see the killers aura. 
---
The purple and red keys can open a hatch to escape while it‚Äôs still closed. You won‚Äôt be able to find a hatch until it spawns and that determines how many gens are done and how many people are alive at the time. 
---
Well actually changing any in game file is bannable, it just so happens that changing character portraits isn‚Äôt detected as it‚Äôs on the user side. Changing anything in the actual game data such as audio would be detectable and likely get you banned.
---
It's still not "hooked on a feeling" which makes me sad.
---
Sometimes yeah. Even playing doctor, I‚Äôd occasionally zap someone and the frame rate would tank and they‚Äôd disappear into the Aether
---
Smells like chili 
---
How I play freddy and have SOME decent success. Equip some end game perks and have em asleep, they will be staying a bit more longer even when the gates are powered. :D
---
I don't recommend hacking the game, but maybe the devs could let you edit the files and remove the lightning effect from him.  Try emailing them, it's worth a shot.
---
They're not fun to play as or against.  Playing as Legion takes zero skill, so it's not fun.  Playing against Legion has zero counterplay, so it's not fun.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ank80u/petition_to_replace_legions_terror_radius_with_a/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
agreed. and I always mess around with remaining survivors who did not DC. unless if they refuse to get the point and keep running lol which happens
---
I don't think claudette will have this fix, mostly because she is made like this for that pourpose  
---
The best way to end a game
---
I want to take my splicer mask and make an elegant/gold trimmed huntress. 
---
I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT NOED AND HUNTRESS HATCHETS. I GET TO LOOK AT ALL THE LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE THREAD!
---
Theres two must have meta perks for killers : ruin and bbq.
---
I think people forget though that killers make this game more than survivors.. "but its 4:1" yeah and look at the event where every killer said wtf and played survivor to get coins the load times were garbage 
---
Dude. Thx. I would legit just follow the killer around because that shits my jam. 
---
The amount of time my team works on a gen before giving up and looking for ruin. 
---
I just leveled Hag up last week solely for ruinüòë
---
I see, disappointing. I would like it if mod support would be available in the future. Just slight things like special moris, specific game sounds, and cosmetics.
---
I never got ruin, I didn't have the time to get the teacheble
---
That would be amazing. I play on console but I will email them as it‚Äôs worth at least a try, thanks. 
---
Disconnecting is bullshit but if it's a Legion I stop trying once they spot me and just let myself die on the hook as fast as possible.
---
Omg so cool 
---
Shit, then I better get Legion then. 
---
I‚Äôve done it a few times. Always against doctor who shoots electric lag out of his hand, always when the lag in general is so bad everyone teleports and rubber bands, and always when I‚Äôm found and hooked in the first ~15 seconds of the match since I physically cannot run away with that amount of lag. I have never felt bad about those rare situations, and I doubt I ever will. It takes about that much bullshit for me to DC though, anything else I‚Äôll grin and bear
---
Exactly why I wanted to do it, a bit disappointed it must likely won't be like that. 
---
I've stopped playing the game as much because of these issues. If the next update has more issues than solutions (like this last update), I think I'm going to call it quits.   
---
I don't have time to make excuses for a game that isn't fun to play anymore. 
---
Buff Freddy ? Is that you ?
---
You 360'd the Feng
---
*Super Freddy 
---
I didn‚Äôt even see her until she got down... 
---
Oh don't worry my complaint is with this sub not the player. This sub wants to believe tea bagging is the most toxic cancerous thing you can do ever, but then turn around and be hypocrits
---
How is nodding your head up and down to taunt a player any different than crouching up and down to taunt a player?
---
I still don‚Äôt understand why this game doesn‚Äôt have a timer. F13 has a timer. Last Year has a timer. I‚Äôm pretty sure Deceit has a timer. Secret Neighbor is going to have a timer. Is there anything about this game that breaks if you add a 20-30 minute limit on it?
---
HIT BOXES THE FUCKING HIT BOXES! EVEN A BLIND BAT COULD FUCKING SEE THAT THE HIT BOXES ARE BULLSHIT! 
---
I would recommend you get rid of no one left behind for borrowed time but also once the event is over if you don't have many good items use plunderers instinct because with the 2.5.0 patch getting rare stuff is a lot easier.
---
 P.S. like your playing on ps4 its a bit harder, but i mean no post game chat.
---
"My uncle works for Behavior, I'll get you banned nub"
---
You didn't see her crouching?
---
I feel this way unless the killer burned a mori or had super rare add-ons that would be wasted if they let the survivors go. Then I completely understand killers still tryharding to get the most out of them, and if I see they have those at the end I‚Äôm not mad.
---
Not on Leon A standard mode. 
---
You can easily outrun that fucker. 
---
CHUNGUS disappointed you used iridescent head and infantry belt
---
Dwight, you ignorant slut!
---
nice people take it normally, toxic people get really fucking angry because they see you're not bothered.
---
And Legion isn't? Legion does take control and finesse like the others. 
---
If they made it so they are REALLY loud I would actually shit myself. If its just Mikey levels of loud it wouldn't be anything new.
---
You know, I don't usually look at fan concepts; not because I think most will be bad (and I assume they are) but because you won't see anything like that in the actual game because the devs couldn't give a shit less what their fanbase thinks (fanbase and community are not the same thing), but I do have to say I really really like one thing you said here. Every season the perks have been released with the idea to "shake up the meta" in mind and the perk you invented "Laughing Stock" would be the biggest shake up to the meta in a long time, but a well needed and deserved one. I do think it would need tweaking as a hook taking 3x as long to accomplish would be miserable for a killer and even as a survivor main believe this is way too great an annoyance for a killer that would make the game unfun for them. Also, as for the additional bloodpoints, I think for a complete struggle, getting 400% bloodpoints is a bit over-the-top I think at most maybe 200% but you shouldn't be able to make a whole game out of being hooked (even though this would rarely happen maybe 1/20 games). Overall I really like the idea of this perk but some balancing would be in order!
---
Yep. 
---
You can‚Äôt even be skilled at Freddy because he‚Äôs so bad
---
I think the overall thematic they were encouraging with Legion is great. 
---
Make certain 'must have' Survivor perks less viable, like self heal, while encouraging strong team play and composition. Legion becomes more of an annoyance with out the currently twisted 'look away' mechanic and a player or two with med kits and a healing perk. Healing each other is faster, and more efficient. 
---
It's no coincidence that there are four members of the Legion and four survivors in play at any time. You're supposed to feel beset upon from all sides - that failure to work together and lone wolf is a death sentence. 
---
The 'sloppy butcher and look down' meta evolution is bad, and I understand the frustration - but I don't think that was intended functionality. 
---
She probably wasn't looking back
---
If the player who plays him is:
---
1. A bad killer in general
---
2. Doesn‚Äôt understand how to use his power which usually ends up in them tunnelling

Jokes on you, everyone's getting a farm session when I'm playing Legion and too many people DC.
---
Thanks man, the numbers are just placeholders really and can be change if needed. Also yes it does suck this probably won‚Äôt become a thing but  goddamnit who doesn‚Äôt want an anti-facecamp perk? Also you only get like 600-700 points for struggling at max so 5x would only be like 3200-3500 which way less than what prove thyself could potentially give you.
---
ok but real answer is trapper he's cool
---
Stop dragging me
---
But that makes him objectively bad.
---
Hate to break it to you buddy but 1) you don‚Äôt know what cognitive dissonance is and 2) I‚Äôve hit rank 1 solo every single ranked reset. Rank 1 isn‚Äôt hard at all, but as you‚Äôll find out when you eventually get to high ranks it‚Äôs full of cancer try hard that make the game 0 fun because every game is nurse or iri head huntress. 
---
High ranks aren‚Äôt fun, and there‚Äôs no incentive to stay at them. Until there is I‚Äôll keep hitting rank one and then deranking back down so I can run circles around garbage players like you and enjoy myself. 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It comes down to the decency they‚Äôre giving to people that did go through the grind(s) to prestige those characters. If I had worked my ass off and gone through all the heinous bullshit it takes to prestige a character, then I saw a bunch of people prestige because of a glitch, it would take away from that sense of accomplishment. It doesn‚Äôt impact gameplay directly, but from a developer standpoint, they‚Äôre showing the players that did put in that time ‚Äúhey we respect your dedication to our game‚Äù. 
---
Had someone tell me I'm stupid for cleansing Rancor.
---
I was playing Michael.
---
Chasing someone and spamming m1 isn't finesse 
---
Again, not on pc. Unless you have a Julie or Joey Mixtape you wanna hit them with both Incase they try and abuse loops.
---
Yes she is OP and should be reworked... but the devs won't touch her or Billy until they've dealt with SWF first. To her the only two viable killers that can deal with SWF. To nerf them without nerfing SWF at the same time would cause a lot of killers to leave, leading to obscene queue times for survivors. The devs know this. They've created a balance trap of their own making that they feel would be impossible to fix without pissing off tryhard SWF squads and/or killers. The people I assume that buy all of the cosmetics. 
---
Maybe... love the idea of guarding ruin and eliminating the killer shack window is nice
---
Oh nooo xD
---
There can be more than one.
---
It's not killer's fault too. If I play my usual game, refusing to give "free" gen or farm, am I tryharding?
---
‚ÄúMommy‚Äù WOAH MAMA I‚Äôm just an Ace main.
---
PEOPLE CALL ME MEAN NAMES BUT IM REALLY FUCKING SENSITIVE! ITS NOT MY FAULT I KILLED YOU YOU DUMB BITCH,, GET GOOD
---
The game is in such a broken unfun state at the moment that using the exploit was my way of "balancing the scales" so-to-speak. People say how it used to be way harder to prestige a character, and it most certainly was, but it was a game worth grinding out and putting 700 hours into, now put simply, it's not.
---
If the nurse is a significant amount better than me, yes I‚Äôll likely go down quickly. 99% of nurses are not complete gods at the game making them not that big of threats as long as I‚Äôm paying attention.
---
Now in legions case, it doesn‚Äôt matter how good I am at the game as they will 100% down me within a set time and there is nothing I can do about it. 
---
There are two types of Legion, the Launch Freddy style Legion who is unstoppable when they use certain add ons and tunnel one survivor. Or the Weak style Legion that bounces from survivor to survivor and extends the game. I prefer to play the second version over any other killer in the game right now. I'll take a properly played Legion over every single killer in the game. Sad part is, 90% of legions run the the tunnel route. The thing is, people wanted a break from the meta, they gave everyone a break, and now everyone is salty as fuck about it. I don't play legion, I haven't played him yet, but as I said he's the best and worst killer wrapped into one. It all comes down to who plays them.
---
Where‚Äôs Legion
---
They don‚Äôt owe you a refund, you breached the contract that you agreed to when you accepted terms and conditions. 
---
I'd say Trapper just so you have all 3 original killers P3, but if you don't play Trapper, then that's a pointless waste of bloodpoints.
---
Basically whichever killer you play semi-regularly, but not often enough where having them vaguely useless between prestiges would be a problem.
---
There are some things you can do, and at least Freddy has to play the chasing game like most killers.
---
Legion doesn't have to mind game, doesn't have to moonwalk around loops, doesn't even have to worry about missed attacks. You get tagged and just sort of get downed when you get downed if you're gonna go down.
---
Prepare for downvotes because you used NOED
---
Holy shit that one is rediculous
---
I am pretty sure I was part of the same conversation xD 100% sure xD
---
‚ÄúLegion lol‚Äù Nah get THICC BOI CLOWN to p3.
---
What changed? (I‚Äôm a relatively new player, started around Halloween event) 
---
I ask because I‚Äôm an aspiring game developer and want to know what triggers that fatigue 
---
micheal/david/jake would be hottest
---
an odd on that lets micheal instant kill even healthy survivors when he is in tier 3
---
Yeah, that's understandable. In my own experience, that's rarely the case though. Usually they're just like 'whatever' and take advantage of the lopsided situation.
---
But his thickness would cause a hole in the space time continuum 
---
soundcloud.com/entity
---
the thing is that the Killer is super easy to play.
---
And Leatherface can stop looks pretty fast actually with 115% Speed and the Chainsaw to break pallets
---
I like to prestige the licensed characters because they don't have any other alternate cosmetics to use.  So Pig or Myers?
---
Well, we was asking for it. 
---
the best strat is to just place them in dumb spots and doorways. they never expect it for some reason
---
doctor is still annoying 
---
and honestly with legions perk equipped to him that lets him know when people leave lockers the one way to counter the screaming is lost forever 
---
You need add-ons to blink more than 2 times. After you've blinked, you need to quickly do another blink.
---
I'd give them one free gen if the player DC'd at 5. Then you're on the same footing as you would be if someone DC'd in match load. Then go to town. But 5 gens, 3 survivors is very hard to recover from and favors the killer far too much.
---
Now we‚Äôre talking. Someone please draw this. I have no talent whatsoevs.
---
As a insidious bubba main I‚Äôm offended by your perks! Nah the perks seem intriguing and the survivor concept is dope because we only have survivors from the modern age so it‚Äôd be funny to see a jester running around the map like a madman.
---
Quentin: holy shit man ive been awake for 5 days on nothing but crack and adrenaline
---
Oh yeah, I get this all the time too. It really sucks, honestly. I'm at the moment, rank 12 as killer &amp; I constantly run into SWF that are like, 'rank 2, rank 20, rank 8, rank 18' and I'm like, 'stop clicking your flashlight, for the love of God.'
---
Hate survivors like that. I play a lot of survivor and unless I'm trying to save someone or guide them to the exit you can bet I'm gone. 
---
Hes ONLY strong because you never play him with a full lobby. People have dced or sucided on hook immediately.  Aaaaaand freddys mixtape was passed out by the hundreds. Without that in his kit hes very easy. 
---
As someone who is Homophobic... I've hated this sub with all my heart
---
I've been lucky and only had this happen twice to me so far. I've seen a lot of people do it when I was Survivor tho. 
---
Every time someone goes for them I just body block the heal to let them bleed out tbh. It's such bullshit that people think it's okay to do that.
---
I play on PS4 to and i am maining doc and it's not that bad just do not run the overcharge skins that's what screwed me up, but yea prestige your doc.
---
Listen buddy if it can handle the THICC chili lord that is Bubba it can handle clowns T H I C C N E S S.
---
slashing someone on the hook is the killer version of teabagging and its treated just as bad 
---
if you want to be a dick in the game be a dick, just dont expect people not to point out what you are doing is a dick thing to do 
---
I promise I‚Äôm only using up my inventory before I prestige UnU
---
I just want to unlock and put on freddy
---
?
---
Looks great!
---
NOED the Tom Brady of perks
---
I promise I‚Äôm only using up items before I prestige UnU
---
Lmao any line you draw is just as arbitrary as anyone else's. 
---
Either its all not okay or it all is. This is literally the only community I've ever played in that gets personally offended when they're tea bagged and I played halo 1.
---
I jump scare them when jumping out! I usually have a second or two head state because they never expect it.
---
You don't have to download doctor do you? Is PC different with this? 
---
Report for griefing
---
Until u realize u dont know pallet spawns and can hardly run away from the killer
---
Momma Huntress :3c
---
Tbh from the doc side laggy people are harder to hit. You think they are right infront of you but nope they nurse blinked 5ft away. I tend to tunnel blinking connection people out of mercy. Im not sure how it works but if it was my connection causeing the lag then they wouldnt show laggyness on my side. But if its laggy on both sides then I think its connection of survivor or survivor processor issue.  Doc is hella processor consuming ngl. You need a pc that can play minecraft for that laggyboi
---
This. It's not about boring gameplay, not at all. It's about winning. 
---
Meg is best girl smh
---
For some reason i always get emotional when i hear that theme. Goosebumps and the whole package. 
---
Just like when i saw the movies for the firet time and the person you think is the killer turns out to be a part of the game and you just sit there, completly..fucking.. 
---
mind BLOWN.
---
Thank you for creating this :') 
---
I‚Äôm not great with her hatchets but I do enjoy her humming. I‚Äôll consider her
---
Nurses Calling when?
---
Well NOED used to work that way (lasted 2 or 3 minutes) and DS was already an idea the devs put forward a bit ago
---
REKT!
---
Yeah, I can't believe that people honestly think this trashy behaviour is ever acceptable, even if you're convinced that a killer is OP or "nOt Fun to pLay AgaInst" or whatever.
---
Behold the power of operant conditioning 
---
I RECKON SURVIVORS HAVE A GPS OR SOME SHIT THAT LEAD EM STRAIGHT TO YOUR HEX RUIN AND THEN THEY URBAN EVADE AWAY
---
It‚Äôs the only way to get the bleed out achievement without playing with genuinely new players. Just begin mending last second to deny them of their bleed out down.
---
You mean HeRMeN CaRTeR
---
Haha, currently, Santa Clown is my favorite.
---
How it should be
---
THATS NOT RAGE THATS HAPPINESS AND JOY
---
Because rawrrrr... xD 
---
Those are the hosts that always either dodge, or people don‚Äôt stay for more than 10 seconds.
---
My internet connection gets very iffy when there is a legion. It‚Äôs the weirdest thing. Green ping for everyone else. Even those ebony nurses! 
---
It annoys the killer
---
THIS IS SO TRUE BUDDY
---
I do this because farming is boring and time-consuming, and if I just murder everyone as quickly as I can, then we can all move on to better games.
---
Tryharding is not playing more gently or kind and still patrolling/tunneling and slugging to be sure no one get hatch...
---
Im mad cuz I just got hag to level 20 and there‚Äôs no going back
---
Fuming Mixtape. 
---
What‚Äôs console got to do with this? This happens with any platform nowadays.
---
Not sure if this fits. But ive noticed there is a entitlement for survivors for the killer to dc instead of them when they get trapped in a place the killer cant reach and they cant get out of. Like if your stuck in the hook or behind a locker you should dc..... but they dont
---
I really enjoy haddonfield, personally. It is challenging but it pushes me to work harder
---
I think the "moral of the story" is that you should sterilize yourself.
---
This is a beautiful moment in gaming
---
Same reason some people see a dog on a leash and thier first reaction is jump back and yelp. Some people are just fragile with animals and city people are especially scared of anything that's not a rat, cockroach, or pigeon.
---
can someone tell me what swf stand for? I'm new to the game so i don't really know the terminology 
---
It‚Äôs not his job to be your friend. I can see having pink add-ons and deciding to help a 2 dc group but you have to remember it‚Äôs still wasting whatever pink add-on you brought. But if there‚Äôs 3 left I don‚Äôt wanna waste them. Plus a lot of killers just wanna end the game so they can get to the next with hopefully 4 people.
---
Thank you!
---
I still don't think Freddy is *fun* to play against even if it's fairly easy. Like, there's no way to stealth around him as he's invisible (unless you pay attention to random things like the grass at all times, and sometimes that's not even an option) and if he finds you, your only real task is to loop the guy until he gives up or loses you, and in the latter case he'll see you again once he goes away far enough or you wake yourself up.
---
Yeah he's not the hardest killer to play against, he's more or less a powerless killer in terms of chases or catching people, but he's easily in the top 3 most unfun killers to play against at least in my opinion. Legion still holds the number one spot for me though.
---
What's this from? I swear the original is from a movie. 
---
One time, I don't remember if I was item farming or messing around with a friend. But I had a suspicion I was gonna die but I saw the hatch. So I marked the hatch and dropped my map. The last person got out but sadly they were a slug who couldn't take my map with them :(
---
JUST. DO IT. I'd love to see that!
---
No, why would it be?  Just means I try to escape three times and then don't struggle.
---
Will do! :)
---
And then she just hits you. GG.
---
No mither plus masochist would basically be the buff everyone says no mither needs as well as giving you one extra health state at the cost of one less hook state. Would make for a sick anti-slug build.
---
I've never encountered someone who straight up slug everyone no matter how many gens or players are left. And the times I've been slugged bc I'm one of two left and killer doesn't want to give hatch to the last person doesn't justify bringing unbreakable.
---
If its you? Then yes if someone else maybe he don't get hit
---
friends 
---
Yeah this doesn't often come up if you note where they were hooked (Because it still shows the initial hook), but if they forget the blind they can get lost....happened to me once.
---
Yup its crazy but I've had 4ks after both gates were opened. When previously i had zero. Didnt even have noed just a bunch of wanna be heros. I love hero survs
---
That would sick as a keychain or coaster
---
yep. nurse Brough bps so I thought we'd have a good game, nope. everyone ended under 10k while nurse had 29k
---
Fact: Killers are compared to each other, meaning that you're always going to have a hierarchy. 
---
I'll have to design some stuff out and get some fabrics, but it's definitely on my to do list with knitting neas beanie amd bloodying up some jeans for neas prestige outfit.
---
Lmao, what? Don't assume shit about people just because you're salty and don't like what they're saying.
---
It's a gay opinion, Aaron. Not a shit opinion. Now shush, get back to Fortnite.
---
Its actually more or less Subjective &amp; Objective
---
It really depends on how you view the matter and see it,
---
if you think he's bad. he's bad in your eyes &amp; maybe others
---
But there are the uncommon few who are rare who would say he's decent,
---
While i stand on neither side.
---
I would say he isn't perfect but isn't bad
---
Cause with the right addons he can be a quote "threat" by only a minuscule amount.
---
Lol, you like my name? Also, meh, I'm over fortnite. And you're right, your opinion is pretty gay. Have a nice night.
---
I mean, Jake with Saboteur and Trapper pretty clearly go against each other. 
---
Just quoting a stupid thing someone said doesn‚Äôt make it a funny copypasta
---
What about David?  Doesn't he have a bald head cosmetic?
---
Remember that, as a killer, you have the choice of the number of person that can have fun during this game. You can let every one have fun or chose to bring toxicity, rage and bitterness, therefore creating toxic survivor player that you'll later complain about... :)
---
It could easily be a large coaster, would be better encased in clear resin since each layer is raised. Might print another and give it a whirl. üòé
---
If you mean "Deranged Pursuit" for the Legion, unless they actually fixed it (couildn't find anything in the mid season patch at a glance), that achievement is pretty fucked up and you wont get it by moonwalking towards a survivor.
---
The achievement text reads "In public matches, as the Legion, down 25 different Survivors that have Deep Wound applied." which is incorrect in more ways than one. The devs say the achievement was working properly but they fucked up the text (Dunno why this hasn't been fixed to my knowledge)
---
The reality of how you get the achievement is to down someone using feral frenzy (Doesn't even have to be different survivors either) so when the player with deep wound is one hit away from being downed, you have to hit a player who isn't in deep wound with frenzy and then use that to down the first player.
---
(As a side note, the best way to get this achievement is to just farm it with survivors, using a brown addon or two that reduces cooldown on frenzy, it's so unreasonably specific that it's not worth getting it normally)
---
People who moonwalk as legion are just exploiting cunts, it's not even achievement related to my knowledge
---
EVEN WITH THE POINT BUFFS FOR KILLERS, SURVIVOR QUEUES ARE STILL ASS.  
---
ALSO SWIFT HUNT IS STILL AN ASS-TIER ADD ON FOR WRAITH, IT MAKES UNCLOAKING MARGINALLY FASTER. PLEASE GIVE WRAITH SOME LOVE AGAIN BHVR.
---
I thought I was the intolerant one, lol. At least I respect your opinion. You cant even tolerate mine. Lol
---
Keys have so little charge they are pretty much useless other than be able to open hatches

A response?

Thanks :)

Very few people use punctuation on the Internet.

Shoutout to my man Fungus, who couldn't be here with us today.

NOTHING BETTER THEN HAVING NOED ACTIVATE AND YOU 1 HIT KILL THE TOXIC NEA THAT WAS TEABAGGING YOU ALL GAME

Omg yes please!

Ah my bad. I thought there was an achievement like that.

I'm not the biggest fan of NOED but this is why I'm totally fine with NOED.

If you can leave, just leave. Even if your intentions are good (givi
---
Any chance of sharing the STL file? Would love to throw this in Cura and try to 3s print it 
---
I don't think so. 
---
I wish they would buff all the useless perks rather than Nerf the good ones. I hate seeing the same 8 or so perks every game when there's like 50 to choose from. A lot of the perks seem like really cool ideas but aren't worth a perk slot if you are playing "competitively".
---
I was thinking about the same thing, him throwing the people onto the hook. But reality sets in. He‚Äôs too small because some of the ‚Äúgrassy‚Äù maps have grass that‚Äôs taller than him. It like playing the killer in the corn field but your smaller and hard to see other people. Idk I think he would be a bad killer unless they make him human size but that would never happen 
---
üòë
---
Funnest 4 mins of your life right? üòú
---
Well, it's not particularly shocking there is more survivors, after all there's 4 survivors and 1 killer per match
---
I FUCKING HATE FREDDY THE PEDO PIECE OF SHIT DESERVED TO BURN
---
ill wait at the exit but its not to teabag the killer its to see if anyone who hasnt made it yet gets hooked so i can save them. also to get a bit more chase BP and give the killer an extra hit so they get BP
---
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR MODESTY. 
---
And I can see the wraith better than I can see Claudette. 
---
LOL this happened to me the other day, cleansed a totem and BANG teammate goes down almost instantly after. Sorry bro
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kinda pointless if you don‚Äôt add the 15 sec and even that‚Äôs not a lot. I barely use it and just look to see if the killer will be in the area right in front of me. It‚Äôs helped when exit gates are open to see if they are near before running in. 
---
I WISH PEOPLE WOULD STOP LEWDING THE HUNTRESS. SHE IS BEST GIRL AND DESERVES PROTECTION FROM THESE FOUL ARTISTS
---
No, it's not. It's totally logical and fine, but a lot of people try to pretend otherwise for some reason I can't figure out
---
Playing with an open mind, or with patience to learn the killer, or even with the power of friendship or something doesn't have anything to do with the fact that player skill is not the only factor in a killer's effectiveness. A big one, yes. Even the biggest. But not the only. 
---
i would pray to him because he is our lord and savior
---
I remember when everyone was saying he was trash on release
---
I ESCAPED A MATCH WITH THREE IRIDESCENTS AND ONE SILVER DUE TO BEING SNEAKY AND ONE OF MY TEAMMATES STARTED CALLING ME NAMES SAYING I WASN'T DOING SHIT, EVEN THOUGHT I RAN AROUND THE WHOLE MATCH DOING GENS, GOT THE RUIN, GOT SOME SAVES AND ETC. WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS?
---
Well, Legion killed Jeffs father. And is Adam Japanese?
---
Looks like Froppy if she was a murderer and not a super hero.
---
what does it mean to keep the game hostage?
---
It‚Äôs even worse when one survivor DCs in the loading screen and the other survivor(s) just instantly DC once they see they‚Äôre down one. At that point I hold hands with whoever is left and help them do some gens so we can move on to the next game.
---
Actually it was a huntress that didn't do anything the whole game, but watched us do lunar gens.. Creepy flex but ok I guess
---
Dwight get off that gen legion is coming. Oh no, he has airpods on. Oh god. Oh fuck.
---
ITS NOT MY JOB TO SAVE YOU, KEEP YOUR SHITTY MESSAGES TO YOURSELF, I WILL IF I CAN BUT NOT IF YOU BEEN DUMB THE WHOLE GAME. FUCK YOU DISCONNECTORS WHO ONLY DO IT AFTER I AM ABOUT TO HOOK YOU FOR THE 3RD TIME. I NEVER GET TO PLAY KILLER BECAUSE MY FRIENDS LIKE THIS GAME ALSO. 
---
Punch him in his face.
---
The scene opens up with Claudette and Dwight T-posing into the scene. They spend the first few seconds jittering then the cutscene continues as normal. Dwight begins to work on a generator, Claudette begins to constantly tap the generator over and over and over, never quite putting her hands into it. In fact in the video it just looks like he's slapping the top with her fingertips.
---
An injured Meg runs by the generator bleeding all over the place, spraying her two teammates in her own viscera as the heartbeat begins. Both Claudette and Dwight continue to work on the generator, undisturbed, like nothing happened. In fact their facial expressions don't even change and they don't look up from the generator.
---
The generator is finished, and The Exposed status effect flashes on the screen as NOED kicks in. Dwight stands up and T poses. Suddenly The Trapper is standing behind Claudette. Claudette turns only her head to look at him while running in a straight line, and run straight into a tree.
---
The Killers swings at her and misses, Claudette then runs into the generator. Dwight is still standing in place and T posing. The killer hits and grabs Claudette and puts her on a hook. Dwight begins running into the forest. The trapper casually walks to where Dwight once was and swings at the open-air. Dwight magically appears in front of him and takes the blow to the face.
---
The scene ends with the Trapper picking up Dwight and starting to walk away casually. He makes it 3 steps before Claudette is instantly unhooked and all three remaining survivors up here on screen teabagging around the hook while flicking flashlights at him. Dwight stabs the Killer in the back with a piece of glass and goes to join tge others. Then the killer DCs.
---
Title Screen.
---
Reddit seems to be the exception most of the time. 
---
That's extremely valid point, and i acknowledge that.
---
But take this into consideration,
---
Would you rather
---
Play a bad killer and have fun playing/learning the killer via losses and occasional wins.
---
Or 
---
Play a good killer that if played right will always guarantee a win but give little to no satisfaction into the victory.
---
I think u just suck
---
Yeah given the infrequency of lerys offerings I started saving it for twitch streamers who look like they might be jumpscared easily. That way I have a vod to watch lol
---
Since this event started, I have Detective's Hunch locked on my loadout
---
The clown is a good example of this. His toxins slows the people down just a lil‚Äô bit, the toxins are also good counter for people looping you. Put the add on that makes people exhausted and that‚Äôs a bounce because they can‚Äôt do dead heart or balance landing since they are already exhausted. The clown is pretty good but not many people play him :( 
---
The timer should only start going down 12 seconds after the chase has ended.

Legion is my BP farmer. When I get my BBQ stacks I switch to full on farm mode, just slappin everyone like some kind of maniac.

Cleansing?
---
But... But... All of the survivor mains keep saying this sub is one giant Killer circle jerk... And survivor mains would never lie, right? People don't do that. People don't just go on the internet and spread lies, right? 
---
Lighting is terrible.. supposed to be a dark and scary game.. now its just bright.. 1.3 had the best graphics this game hsd ever seen

Everyone should just move on in those scenarios

Or they're not viable at higher ranks, but ok.
---
Everyone always thinks they are honestly in the right. Even cannibals.
---
I... I don't.... What?

You mean "Korean brutally murdered". 
---
Purple flashlights I stopped caring about tbh. I'm much more concerned with a bunch of toolboxes on the team.

Flashlighty people like to follow and not be on gens a lot.

[Missed oportunity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcoqR9Bwx1Y) (jk)
---
Its cause he supposedly lacks map pressure,
---
His main effectiveness is ending chases quickly,
---
as i do with many killers is i use perks to counter his weakness
---
that being Gen control.
---
i would go with
---
Pop Goes the Weasel, Ruin, OverCharge "and any other perk as the 4th"
---
To me its always considering the weaknesses of the killer and using the perks to fix those weakness, even if it isn't that much of a fix.
---
We keep saying Nea is a killer, but really, Claudette is a better Wraith than the Wraith is.
---
not really interested in sarcastic snark. that'll just make people feel attacked and be defensive 
---
Yes but why would I do that? Kind of removes the initial point of the comments.
---
People call everything crutches. It's a super sweaty perk (like noed) but calling it a crutch kind of relies on the assumption that going down (or all gens getting done) is always player error. 
---
Even if their personalities go against one another, its more about their relationship outside of the Entity's control.
---
Oh yeah, whoops I meant that thanks for clearing it up! I usually remember Perks by Image so I forget the names lul

---
Same, but I completely understand why people hate him though. Unless they‚Äôre running frank‚Äôs - fuck that add on.
---
But chainsaws and various pointy and sharp objects are still ok yes?
---
If you hide in a locker for too long or even just idle as survivor the game starts giving the killer noise notifications, so that's less of an issue than it seems, most players are just immersed somewhere.
---
This needs more jpg.
---
This is for the safety for survivors, killers have to carry out their own risk assessments, and are exempt from duty of care. 
---
Demm. The real joke is always in the comments
---
a good spirit can aswell. maybe even hillbilly and huntress
---
not every swf is extremely toxic and well-coordinated, those are actually kinda rare in red ranks
---
Fastest Disconnect in the west
---
If you play him the way he's intended (don't tunnel, moonwalk, try to hit everyone in your radius before going after someone) he is pretty trash, while still being not fun to play against. 
---
If you play him with Frank's, moonwalking, and tunnel vision, he becomes even worse to play against and fairly viable.
---
I always get dodged when this happens :/
---
I get that and I hardly slug for the 4K unless there‚Äôs a BPS or the 4K is critical to some aspect of my match, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with slugging. The survivor may not want to sit there for 4 minutes but the killer may not want to lose a 4K because of a busted mechanic. It‚Äôs not mandatory, but if someone wants to do it every game then so be it, they‚Äôre often only doing it to opt out of a mechanic that is equally unfun for them to go against.
---
I just wanted 2 say thx for the upvotes, this is my 3rd post and it's over 500. Thank you all so much, also, about spreading this meme, here's a template: https://imgur.com/pVhGDDZ. Thank ya'll so much

I remember that from the Devs stream when Legion was announced
---
Holy shit yeah I need this now.

I don't know how I never thought of this, I love the Saw franchise.

I. E. if you're VSing a wraith with bloodhound in Lery's, i'd strongly advise you to heal.

ACTUALLY WON'T FIX A THING DEPENDING ON HOW THEY IMPLEMENT IT.
---
OH GOD OH FUCK
---
I love sitting on hatch until the killer finds me and wait until he picks me up then hit em with the d strike into hatch. GG2EZ
---
Dave Richard said they didn't, so..
---
I got two of them yesterday in approximately 8 matches. 
---
It's the single worst feeling in dbd. 
---
&gt;moonwalking Legion is counterable
---
ok friend
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH THE HITBOXES!!!! I HAD A BILLY HIT ME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PALLET
---
Devs intended him to be played a certain way but he's garbage when you do it that way.
---
If you abuse chase mechanics he's overpowered but more importantly completely unfun to play against.
---
Ds would not be worth it if it's for one charge and only does that.
---
As for noed, it used to be time based, but it was much longer than what you proposed, plz just make it to tier 2 and 1 dont have instadown so I don't see it every match and id be okay
---
It's cute how disingenuous you are :)
---
Haha cool :)
---
I mean look at the legion he was invented, and for what reason? To make the most anti fun killer in the game? 
---
This is really awesome
---
What they could do is make it so that there is a time window before the match where they are still in the lobby but cant change perks, like how when everyone is readyd up there are 30 seconds and now they can see the killer.
---
Had ruin like 5 weeks ago so idk what youre so hyped about

It's technically a hyperlink. Some subreddits will cause text to shake if they link to the "website" [/intensifies] It only works on PC though since it's an HTML thing.
---
Also cake day upvote.
---
By supporting them? It is, yes. I know it's easier to just ignore your own personal responsibility in life but it's not good policy.
---
I rarely play killer.  I can't stand when one of the last survivors just endlessly vaults a window near the exit after the gates are open if you don't chase them.  Just leave, dude.  I've got other things to do.  I once got up and made dinner and came back and this Claudette was still doing it.  For over twenty minutes.  Then they came down to the basement to teabag my face and I downed them with Evil Within III.  And of course they disconnected after I hooked them.
---
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET ROLE LIKE BLOOD ACE ON THIS SUBREDDIT
---
First time I got mori‚Äôd was like one f the first games I played. I was like rank 19 playing Jake (this was old mori by the way). Trapper downed me and then the animation played. I was confused about what was happening until it‚Äôs like lol you‚Äôre dead. and I was like WHAT HE JUST KILLS ME!?!? and then I saw it was a rank 2 trapper and then watched him destroy the other survivors.
---
YOU APPEAR TO BE A BITCH. SELF PROCLAIMED. 
---
First of all, are you playing on PC or not? Hardware limitations(fps, controller) can make the killers easier to spin.  
---
If you get it correctly you should have your survivor run in what seems like a really tight circle. For me, it was something that came naturally with playing the game and fucking around so I don't know how to learn/teach it to others specifically, but the more you do it, the more mistakes you're gonna notice and try fixing.  
---
Overall, "spinning" isn't a great idea against any killer with a brain as you can just not swing or just follow the spin easily(m&amp;k). Juking in general counts on the killer not being great and making silly mistakes.
---
10/10 backdown. Got downvoted in your snarky replies so you deleted all of them and edited your post to deny it LOL good job dude. My boy Orville Burrell could take a page from your book.
---
console looks so clunky to play
---
Oh wow, I didn't even realise it was my cake day!  My account is oficially one year old!
---
i mean it isn't that rare
---
Yea pc but spinning is a great thing to learn because if u have nowhere to go its another chance to get away
---
Maybe they changed it later, I'll edit
---
isnt micheal a bit to young to be a daddy? i mean he was only in his early 20s when he went on his first killing spree. i mean 2018 micheal is a daddy for sure but he isnt the games version of micheal 
---
How many times do I have to teach you this lesson, old man?
---
If you disconnect because you don't like the killer then maybe you're the one who's no fun. I find it fun to play it out and see how far I can get no matter who I'm facing. 
---
This post was made by the doctor gang
---
I have over 300 hours in this game and just realized, that only half of the face is a skull.
---
Amazing 
---
Wait what, they revert it? Damn that's harsh. How much progress did you lose?
---
Yeah but that's my hobby not yours moron 
---
Ready and prepared. 
---
This post is shit. 
---
Not the response I was looking for but it works too.
---
Autism is hard to cope with, good luck with that
---
Sry then, bad example. A better one would be mentioning how the base flashlight is useless unless you actually put on addons. I mean the fact that you can bring in extra disposable firepower for both a killer and a survivor standpoint does mean having higher rank means you are very likely to have that. And dealing with it from either side kind of turns you pff from the game. Like a killer/survivor can just decide he is stronger this match and I just have to deal with the now unbalanced fight. Why would I put myself through that?
---
He was invented to counter looping and to slow the game down, I don‚Äôt think they went oh let‚Äôs make someone un fun
---
Apart from the hours played, my niece said the exact same thing to me. Really tempted to make the other mori icons now. 
---
Really hate to see that
---
Very slight chance at that.
---
r/dbdgonewild you say?
---
Well played have a vote
---
Dude don't forget your NSFW tab.
---
There's a difference between farming and playing casual. You can play like normal with no camping or tunnelling. You'll still win most likely but the survivors won't have had a shitty time.
---
Killer's job is to kill. It's not magically their responsibility that someone decided to throw a temper tantrum.
---
If 2 people DC then yeah there's no sport in it, and I'd usually give the Survivors a few gens before killing them.
---
Playing a bunch of killer lately. And man survivors are disconnecting like no other right now. Might be because I'm just getting back in so I've only climbed from rank 20 to 11. But shit man. Most of my games 2 of 4 survivors DC before I can hook them for my coin points.  If you're gunna be a dick and quit. Let me hook you first!
---
***Just a little bit***
---
I don't disconnect when I see a killer I don't like - I might get aggravated and just want the round to end faster though. I rarely do use the get out of jail free card in fact. My point was that a wide array of players seem to just want to disconnect to avoid playing against the killer due to the mechanics making them feel unfair or unfun to play against. When a large chunk of players, at least in my own experience disconnect over how a killer works, it shows that there needs to be something done to remedy it - or at least taking a look at it.
---
Every legion game I play I watch usually at least one person or more disconnect which ruins the game for other players. It's rather rare for me to see no one hit that fancy 'nope' button when it comes to Legion.  DBD really needs a way to punish DCers.
---
I probably wouldn't have disconnected.  But instead afkd to clean up the mess. 
---
DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON P3 CLAUDETTE

RNG power is best power
---
I usually bang out 1 gen, get all highlighted totems, then have a pretty good idea where the rest are. Also helps me locate gens if I get Lery's
---
You completely misunderstand. You can play without camping or tunnelling but not farm.
---
Tryharding is slugging all the survivors to get a 3k because there's only 3 of them. Basically being sweaty af to win. You can win easily against 3 survivors so there's no need to tryhard. If you tryhard you just make the game even worse for the remaining survivors.
---
Imagine having to stab ppl 28 times to go down
---
Doesn't calm spirit directly counter it?

Shuch shitty hit boxs
---
&gt;He was invented to counter looping
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt think they went oh let‚Äôs make someone un fun
---
The chase is one of the only things that's fun on Survivor. Other people find fun in stealth but imo that's boring. Legion just removes stealth though after one hit anyway.
---
"AHH LAWD JESUS RUN AWAY ITS A SPIRT"
---
Not everyone wants to use shards for a perk.
---
I would fold.
---
Yeah if you stay in one spot to long. That‚Äôs why every once and awhile you just move, it‚Äôs a pretty big issue. I‚Äôve had the gates be open for close to twenty minutes before and there‚Äôs a survivor that just refuses to leave. The issue is the survivor knows whenever you‚Äôre nearby so it‚Äôs easy for them to avoid you since you have no clue where they are
---
That's why I wrote "define tryhard". For some people tryharding in 3v1 is simply trying to get 3k (doesn't matter if by slugging or by hooking everyone 3 times without camping/tunneling)
---
Killer is your next door neighbour
---
Came to say the same thing. 
---
Most killers run noed though in case of d strike.. they go hand in hand in general dont think noed or d strike should be a thing without having a stipulation like if you use d strike your position is shown 100% of the time no way around it, NOED even if not up same thing position shown 100% of the time. 
---
Well then you are lost!
---
Hahah, I got my eyes rolling too when I tried to count them and messed up so many times.. 
---
More eyes the better :)
---
Both are completely balanced survivors just resent that majority of these killers baby camp.  Bubba with his saw and wraith just hiding next to hook invisible.  
---
I'll never be able to live my dream of leapfrogging other survivors confirmed :(
---
If they‚Äôre on their second hook and you don‚Äôt know totem spawns, you‚Äôre probably not going to safely find that totem in time to cleanse and save
---
No, but the purple and red keys can open the hatch early.
---
ENCOUNTERED MY FIRST GAME LAST NIGHT WHERE THE KILLER GOT SO ANGRY THEY DISCONNECTED THEIR CONSOLE/CLOSED THE GAME WHICH MEANS THE 3 BASEMENT SAVES I RISKED MY ASS FOR AND THE 30K BLOODPOINTS I WAS GOING TO GET WHERE ALL FOR NOTHING. GO DO A SPLIT OF BROKEN GLASS YOU SPOILED BRAT.
---
Honestly I just think the community would be a far far less toxic place if neither perk was in the game.  The funniest players to me are the ones that bitch about one but use the other lol.  They're two sides of the same crutch coin.
---
Well... If you wouldn't mend, you probably would do a gen. Doesn't seem to be that interesting too, does it. At least you now have 2 different boring tasks.
---
People may be harder to hit in general, but you get more chances when they rubber band through the window you‚Äôre at 3-4 times
---

Really has nothing to do with SWF. That's just 4 people being good at the game and rushing 5 gens as fast as they can.
---
‚ÄúI could just stomp it out.‚Äù
---
People say his broken or underpowered, what is it? me personally i see him alright, against or controlling. 
---
Suddenly I like him now
---
WHY DO KILLERS HAVE TO CAMP ALL THE TIME AND EVERYTIME YOU GET OFF THE HOOK THEY GO BACK FOR YOU THE SAME 3 TIMES. THEY NEVER GO TO ANY OTHER PLAYER AND THEY MAKE SURE YOU DIE. ITS UNFAIR. WTFFF
---
I'm a sloppy butcher guy myself lol it's on literally every killer I play except leatherface who i run his 3 and enduring 
---
This killer is the most cancerous killer ever added into the game.
---
And the fact that his outfit and mask look uninspired af don't help making his case.

---
Well i have one ore two survivors left, my quentin p3 50.. Adam 50, laurie 50 and dwight 50. had all survivors on 50, prestiged them regulary and glitched them to prestige 3.. because why not, reduce the grind i thought to complet all survivors one day.. well that went not so well.. in time.. lost arround 400h?.. i lost some killers aswell, all those i dont like.. but got what i deserved... i guess :)
---
I'd like to think Adam protected Rin during the train wreck, and then she went home and got attacked by her father, who was fired from his job, because they needed a scapegoat for causing a train wreck.
---
Nurse does have a downside and a big one at that if you ever played her. I have no issue losing the clown. Makes me wonder why i rarely get matched against the clown, yet legion is pretty much a solid  choice.

Read again pls ^^ I said he is as far away from being OP as Doc and Wraith are far away from being OP 
---
Not my main language :D
---
Oh makes sense pay money for the perk. Gotcha 
---
Yes they are not OP, that was what I was saying. 
---
And now think how " fun " it is for a killer like myself to play wraith or freddy or some low tier shit and get bullied every game with flashlights and SWF :D Fun is subjective
---
Honestly? No that's way too harsh. Everyone agrees that the grind is huge. How huge? I decided not to glitch my killers because I would need to get the perks again even though I could have glitched all of them (except for one ofc)
---
GET FUCKED MATEY
---
Sounds so fun 
---
This pic fucks with my Brain, somehow when i look at the door and the yellow spot at the bottom it kinda looks like a Video Game render but at the same time it look like real life o.o
---
Fear is the Dwight killer.
---
To be fair they just recycled the unhook animation for the lanterns. I‚Äôm just waiting for lanterns to spawn in the basement hooks.
---
Works best when all three of us are pizza Dwight. 
---
Just like how every survivor uses clutch perks?ü§î
---
Wat?
---
Are you serious? The whole dbd community hates this killer. 
---
I'd like to think so. In fact, I might just draw and print one of those too.
---
What downside? She has a nearly infinite skill ceiling. Only downside is cancer maps like Swamp and Coldwind with the ton of grass/corn in the way. This doesn't qualify as a downside to her kit but a downside to a map. (I play on console so she isn't as big a problem as she is on PC. She has a hard skill ceiling on console because of low sensitivity max).
---
Clown isn't as hardcore at countering loops as Legion or Nurse but he still removes loops if he is good. While he can stop loops from happening he still has to interact with windows and pallets.
---
***DANNY DON'T YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE HOT AS FUCK ON THE INSIDE?***
---
"*Yep....not interested*"
---
Perfectly calm response.
---
yes there is, there literally is, you're literally using it incorrectly. literally. and everyone plays video games for fun.
---
at the expense of others?
---
I'M FUCKING TIRED OF MY TEAMMATES CROUCHING NEXT TO ME IN A TIGHT SPACE AND REFUSING TO MOVE WHEN THE KILLER IS WALKING TOWARDS US. I CAN'T WALK THROUGH YOU BITCH MOVE. WHAT'S EVEN WORSE IS THAT I END UP GETTING HOOKED.
---
DC'ing is reportable I would like to start seeing some proper consequences for survivors doing it. 
---
***DANNY DON'T YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE COOL AS FUCK ON THE INSIDE!***
---
God, I swear, P3 Claudettes are fucking invisible. Specially in the swamp.
---
Amazing job :)
---
I always think I'll get hooked but so far only once. I'm very team oriented (without farming people) and plunder + cleanse + saboteur + always loop killer away from the hooked person so someone else can save, so I like to think karma comes back to me.
---
Just saying the Ace pants look dope as fuck with that one maroon jacket of his in the store and that jacket costs practically no iridescent shards.
---
Other day I was playing billy down/hooked 3 survivors within 3 minutes, they all D/Ced. So I thought I‚Äôd be generous when I caught the last one and would let him finish gens and get the hatch, but no he D/Ced when I saw him and then they all flamed and reported me. I love the toxicity in this community, makes disconnect 4 even more fun. 
---
You might actually be correct-if so, the stats should level out to 50%-25%-12.5%...for each respective RBT
---
Not his fault the devs released a killer they knew was broken just because they could push so many cosmetic sales with them.
---
LEGION IS LEGION, THIS IS HOW IT IS
---
I don't get why people saying eat it early is a good thing. Eating it early gives 3 survivors an extra chase worth of time to finish gens. If anything, eat it late, when other survivor(s) is already hooked/dead. That way there will only be 1 or 2 other people working on gens when you have to chase down the obsession again. The less survivors on gens the better.
---
If you're going to taunt someone who is disabled, make aids you're not within striking distance of their crutches. If you got all the gates open and there isn't Blood Warden, don't decide to go strolling back out for shits and giggles.
---
Dwight has no one else to blame but himself for getting downed. He was at the 1 yard mark doing his touchdown victory and got bodied.
---
Self care is pretty much a must. Borrowed Time just recently got even more buffed. You can debate over Sprint Burst but I would still pick it over another exhaustion perk like Lithe or Dead Hard. But if you disagree I would be interested to hear what the real clutch perks are. 
---
I lost a engineer's tool box with brand new parts and instructions one time.
---
That's great !
---
I don't think that word means what you think it means.
---
There should be some punishment, but I disagree with the degree of punishment they‚Äôre giving out. If they continue to revoke honest progress instead of just the glitched progress then the bans will be worse for the games health than the actual glitch was, and that says something. 
---
These people they‚Äôre banning are mainly honest everyday players that took an opportunity to lessen the stupid crazy grind this game has, not hackers that mod their files with the intent to grief or cheat in game. They‚Äôre essentially dealing out executions for murderers and culprits of petty theft.
---
The people who did the glitch should receive a punishment, but not one that convinces them to leave the game for good. BHVR loses money and the playerbase takes a big enough hit to feel a difference if they completely go through with this. Whether you think it‚Äôs ethically or morally correct to reset everything these people have got, even honest work, is up to you, but regarding the future of dbd these consequences and thinning out your active consumers is a horrible idea to go through with.
---
If anything reset the progress to what it was before 2.5.0 and give out a ban until 2.6.0, that way they get a reasonable punishment and actually feel motivated to continue to support the game when they‚Äôre allowed to play again.
---

Ps4 or pc? I'm on ps4. I'll need your player name if you are So I can spare you. If not carry on. *oink*

Petition to replace legion in general :)

Great job on the wraith!
---
Let us not forget all the items we have lostüòîüò≠
---
PC, sry. I keep changing my name. 
---
That happens on the computer version, as well. 
---
Cleanse totems, ezpz, no NOED.
---
On PC I'm not getting the extra bloodpoints as a survivor or as a killer. Neither are my friends. I submited a ticket and they said "We know. It will be fixed in a mather of days"
---
By then, the event will be over...
---
Carry on. *oink*
---
That happens to me too occasionally
---
Still wouldn't be too hard-instead of 50/50 it could be 1/number of jigsaw boxes on the map, with the last one being an automatic 100%
---
You know, you've convinced me that when there's a DC and I see someone get downed I should assume they're people like you and I should be sandbagging the game for the next 20 minutes to waste his time ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Yeah it's kind of up to each individual killer.  If they're not toxic I respect the Kobe more often than not.  If they were cocky little shits I don't.  Sometimes I'll respect it just for making me laugh.  I had a Dwight Kobe in front of me in the basement as I was hooking a second survivor.  He didn't run he just stopped and looked up at me.  I laughed so hard I hit the air a few times until he left the basement.
---
What?! So I need 900 points to get my last coin?  How many altogether then for the 9 coins?  4500!
---
Yes and with the spies from the shadows buff also gave calm spirit a use outside of doctor. It still might not come into play to often but  when you get bored of the same meta perks every game it isn't bad to put on with iron will and urban evasion to make the most immersed survivor possible.
---
So does adding a box actually make it easier for the survivor to remove the trap? Extra box means more likely to be one nearby and if its still 50% on first try...
---
too much has been lost to the clutches of Franklin's demise 
---
HAG IS ACTUALLY A STRONG KILLER, LEARN HER YOU BASTARD
---
The human side of the face looks like Donald Trump
---
Wait wasn't Legion the worst killer by far? Did something change in a patch?
---
IM DONE WITH THE AIR GETTING HITTED AND ME GETTING DAMAGE. FIX THE HITBOXES.
---
Funny story from last night: I'd downed a Survivor and was carrying them to a nearby hook. A teammate was already crouching under said hook to boody block. I'm still not quite there yet and I hear an explosion go off somewhere. Half a second later the would be blocker had dipped. HG had just proced.
---
It was like:
---
"I got youuuuu. I'll take a hit save youuuuu!"
---
**Exposed**
---
"But I won't die for you, byeeeee!"
---
NOT FUN TO PLAY AGAINST 
---
Does that match the numbers here?  Because then it's %:  25, 33, 50, 100, which doesn't seem to match.
---
This streamer is OhTofu for anyone not familiar.
---
Its 2019 and we still dont know how to vote sources, apparently :/
---
Was playing a few days ago. Had a trash team that all ended up leaving. We didn‚Äôt even get a gen done. 
---
I ran to the killer and began my attempt to communicate that I‚Äôm trying to be friendly and want to farm some bloodpoints to make this shitty match a bit better. 
---
Instantly kills and hooks me. 
---
This happens every single time all my teammates DC. 
---
Killer mains, why are you so mean to me? Don‚Äôt you want free bloodpoints????? 
---
well ill drop pallets near the exit and jump in an our of lockers so the killer knows where i am in the hopes they chase me out of the exit gates giving the last person a chance to look for the hatch since if they still havent made it to the exit then odds are they are either trying to get experience for opening the other exit or looking for the hatch so i try to get the killers attention before leaving
---
Yes, caught a 2 day ban and all chars that I did it on reverted to lvl 1 regardless of where they were at prior to the glitch. 
---
Yeah, this happens when healing people too. And it's not because they purposely stop you from doing it (as I sometimes SwF), you'll heal them for like a second then it'll stop for like two seconds before you can start again
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Both of em are very weak
---
I HATE FUCKING BLOODY TUNNELING NURSES?! WTF HAPPENED TO YOU?! YOU'RE PLAYING THE MOST POWERFUL S+ TIER KILLER AND STILL YOU TUNNEL LIKE MOTHERFUCKERS WHEN STILL 5 GENS REMAIN! STOP IT.  
---
I WANT TO FCKING KILL EVERYONE WHO UNHOOKS IN FRONT OF A KILLER. DUNNO WHAT IS THAT BUT MOST PEOPLE UNHOOK IN FRONT OF UNCLOAKING WRAITH. THEY'RE BEING CHASED, WRAITCH CLOAKS AND FOLLOWS THEM AND THEY JUST RUSH THE HOOK. WTF IS WITH YOU?! DON'T YOU SEE THE SHIMMER?! IT'S SO ANNOYING, AND IT'S RED RANKS, PLEASE, D O N' T  F U C K I N  D O  I T
---
I am still pretty new to the game and I really get the sense that the reason I hate Legion so much is that they easily counter all the skills in a beginner's toolkit. If vaulting and hiding is all you have (which is very true for me right now) then Legion feels broken and unfair.   
---
He is literally the killer of choice for both bad killers *and* assholes. 
---
He boosts bad killers because you dont have to learn how to play tiles like other killers and his power has no learning requirement. He removes the skill gap between players. If a legion sees a survivor, the chase will end in a predetermined amount of time. Even if you successfully escape him, Legion is rewarded because now your bleedout bar is completely diminished. 
---
Legion also has the power to be the most toxic shit in the game. They cheese the terrible chase mechanics by looking down and follow you and you're just dead. 
---
i feel like if bhvr actually cared about the feelings of it‚Äôs player base, the impossible grind wouldn‚Äôt exist in the first place. if they cared about decency they‚Äôd have a legitimate QA team, would have released an optimization patch like they promised (not PASS), wouldn‚Äôt push cosmetics rather than working on QoL changes or make arduous events that are so time consuming most people are apt to just shell out the money for cosmetics, would communicate more with their community (remember the whole clown debacle?), they wouldn‚Äôt have been completely radio silent or said there was no eta when people constantly pleaded for people who lagswitched or speedhacked to be banned on console then proceed to conveniently drop a ban system when a glitch threatens their "bloodpoint economy‚Äú, the list goes on and i don‚Äôt feel the slightest bit of respect from them despite being a loyal paying customer for so long. 
---
they batch banned item glitchers and p3 glitchers with the same consequences despite having drastically different advantages, i doubt decency was even an afterthought in their decision. i have 5 characters p3d legitimately and i honestly couldn‚Äôt give a shit if people got a few extra characters to p3 because the road doesn‚Äôt end there and it doesn‚Äôt effect my sense of accomplishment because there IS no sense of accomplishment with all the leveling that you need to do, you still have to level to 50 then go through hundreds of lvl 50 bloodwebs to get all the perks or, honestly, just to get perks you can use. 
---
LEGION..... ENOUGH SAID
---
Maybe I can change at least one person who reads this and they won't be toxic or fight with people after matches for even ONE game.
---
Needs more JPEG.
---
I'd prefer to not waste a perk slot for that. I'm sure devs can amplify survivors' sounds a bit.
---
MY CLAUDETTE IS LEVEL 35 AND STILL HAS SELF CARE AT LEVEL 1
---
***my hope will never die***
---
The Dwight is doing nothing wrong (other than the teabag he did). He was just waiting for the other survivors. That‚Äôs why he went out to look for them. Not because he was cocky lol.
---
Good guy Dwight
---
I JUST FINISHED MY 5TH GAME IN A ROW AGAINST A BASEMENT CAMPING CANNIBAL!
---
I LOST RANK BECAUSE I COULDNT SAVE THE PEOPLE WHO WENT DOWN!
---
THE LAST ONE WAS A SALTY &amp; RUDE TOO!
---
yea but she will do the fatige stuff.
---
This is the real answer. Any killer can 4k. You will struggle at the red ranks against swf. It's not a joke when they say 4 gens done in 3 minutes. I have YouTube videos of it happening to me. 
---
11/10 I would definitely equip. 
---
but at least the nurse needs a little practice, you actually can play inmersed against nurses but legion not.

Your logic was paying for a single perk. And I debunked it. You clearly lack any structure to even form a solid argument. Gday.
---
You sound like a bitch
---
I hadn't noticed until I just read your comment LMAO. Yup, That is indeed a typo :p
---
Going against solo queue survivors isnt even fun as killer. Theres almost always a nea/claudette in a corner doing nothing and I just feel bad for them. At least SWF groups know how to play the game so I can get better as killer
---
SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKA! 
---
Logs
---
There is an report option for killers who work together with survivors but it's probably just because of the event or because of 3v1 matches. So think twice about reporting someone.
---
so why cant you just do gens/run away normally if he pressures you.
---
Tier 1 - You can attempt to free yourself
---
Tier 2 - You struggle
---
Tier 3 - You are dead
---
That is how it is right now. Does the speed multiplier just affect the speed at which the Entity kills you when you reach tier 3?
---
Good to know it's just a strong loop and i can walk away. I'm going to try and exclude indoor gens for the 3 gen strat from now on lol.
---
Doesn't sandbagging mean that you're helping the killer by acting in a way that gets your teammates caught? lol
---
But seriously, could you elaborate why you take 1v3 games so seriously?
---
Is it a case of reward where you want to keep your items and get blood points? Or is it a case of ego and it doesn't feel good to have to lose an unwinnable match while your opponent wins an almost unlosable match? 
---
Like I know it feels bad to lose for reasons outside of your control, but does winning and getting points because the opponent didnt try feel good? Do you feel accomplished for escaping or getting more points when the killer is having less fun while everyone else is also having less fun because they know the killer isnt really trying and is basically letting you farm? 
---
Rewards aside, wouldn't you want to have more time playing in matches where its balanced from the start? I certainly do when I play survivor and killer. Getting 2 gens done and waiting for my other teammates to die so I can grab hatch sure is boring to me.
---
Heeeheeee Michael Jackson voice
---
Idont see that even when iam the killer
---
Amandas letter sucks
---
That‚Äôs a nice thought, but sadly the other 30 identical threads made this week alone didn‚Äôt change anything. All these posts do is clutter the sub.
---
You can‚Äôt change people being toxic online. It sucks, I know, but that‚Äôs just how people are.
---
Dark sense is a really good perk for new players. I would run Self Care Dark Sense Empathy and Borrowed Time. Once you get claudette to level 40, level up Meg to 40, then Jake to 30. Meg has Sprint Burst and Adrenaline, Jake has Iron Will. 
---
Survivors have teachable perks that once you get you can find it on any other survivors bloodweb.
---
These kinds of survivors are why I enjoy smoking while I play. That way I don't give a fuck when the salt and sweat starts to rain down, instead I can just laugh it off. \o/
---
Prestige 3 Nibbas: üòé

You are kidding right?!?
---
FUCK YOU, THIS IS DEAD BY DAYLIGHT, NOT AMIIBO KIDDIE HOUR WHERE WE ALL SIT AROUND AND LICK MARIO‚ÄôS PUSSY.
---
How was the end chat?
---
There is such option already. Gotta agree, farming is lame.
---
So this is how it would work with masochist. At tier 1 you die right away when hook. In tier 2 and 3 you can attempt to kobe but you will die instead of struggling. The multiplier is how fast the bar goes down to hit the next stage.
---
Alert is like a beefed up Dark Sense. Since Alert is a teachable and there are better teachables to get he probably should stick with Dark Sense for now. But I‚Äôve loved Alert ever since it got changed, its insane the knowledge that perk gives you. I wish they‚Äôd do more perk rebalancing for both survivor and killer
---
JUST GOT TUNNELED BY A BUBBA WHO HAD PERKS WHICH MADE ME END UP IN BASEMENT EACH TIME. HE ONLY GOT 10K BPS THO SO THAT FEELS GOOD
---
HOWARD JOHNSON IS RIGHT!
---
BBQ isn't just an extremely powerful perk, it also generates crazy amounts of bp which is great for grinding other characters. 
---
They are both fun. But hag has Ruin. Get hag.
---
Your logic. 
---
As a fellow Killer main you should understand the struggle of playing killer (especially on console)
---
Loving the Wraith figure

Well I presume the Myers theme was held by the same people who held the rights to Myers, so they only needed the permission of one entity. I'm sure they could with Hello Zepp, but it's a little more complicated due to multiple rights holders.
---
chase lasting longer than 20 seconds aren't worth it
---
this might not seem like much but teams worth their "salt" can gen rush even with ruin in game in less than a couple mins

That was my first doctored photo. Since then, it's gotten a little better. My friend showed me a new tool. But I love the classic MS Paint.

Hmu, Joey's Mixtape + Cold Dirt.
---
He‚Äôs not OP, his power is just broken. There are a million threads like this already T.T
---
I speak out of ignorance, but would it be too hard to design and 3D print the actual face/skull attached to a chain rather than the icon with depth? I'm not being picky, just wondering, I absolutely love this!
---
1. Yes.
---
2. Nothing even comes close in terms of utility.
---
3. Bloodhound makes blood neon fucking bright meaning if you pair it with anything that induces bleeding (or just run it by itself) you will not lose someone who is injured, period.
---
4. Surveillance lets you know when you kick a gen if there is a lil shit still hiding nearby. It is incredibly good for keeping up pressure, especially because you can kick multiple gens.
---
The real funny thing are the people who actually think there is a diffference. You get rank 1 by simply playing. Anyone who thinks it's worth anything or saying anything about your personal skill across the board can go home because it doesn't. 
---
Maybe a hard pill to swallow but it's the truth. Rank in this game is playtime, nothing else. 
---
At least when you're working on gens you're working towards an objective. Mending literally just means hold m1 for 20 seconds. No skill checks, no chance of counterplay if the killer finds you. *And then you have to heal afterwards too?* Come on dude one hit for 40 seconds of wasted survivor time is boring.
---
Oh I did. Don‚Äôt you worry. 
---
Though it‚Äôs not like reporting actually DOES shit. 
---
Okay i agree with what you said tbh
---
No, now you can easily kill the unhooker unless the door is VERY close.
---
This post was made for those who dc on purpose.

I had a whole swf dc because of that.

SELF-CARE ONE IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS SELF-CARE THREE BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SELF-CARE YOU DON'T NEED A MEDKIT, SO THAT'S NOT THAT BAD.
---
Sadly, I don't think Rins ever taken the train, or if so it doesnt seem like it was ever mentioned. The backstory says she came home **on her bike**, so.
---
If you play on PS4, they have done a lot of bans so it's a start. I have no clue what the status of PC is however
---
The reason they farm is because the progression system in this game is incredibly grindy and annoying. I thought it was bad to get a survivor to get all level 3 perks but its like 100x worse as killer. There are like 20 base perks that suck ass and clog your bloodweb. My spirit got BBQ at level 3 and shes at level 48 still running with BBQ1. 
---
There would be almost no one farming if the bloodweb grind was just better. Reduce the points of everything by 1k, or make it so that theres only two levels of a perk instead of 3. If the devs really had an issue with farming they would have made the grind alot easier awhile ago.
---
I wish survivors could blacklist toxic killer mains. 
---
Before long face campers and tunnelers and NOED users wouldn‚Äôt be able to find a match. 
---
Your desire works both ways, buddy. 
---
How does one abuse pallets or jungle gyms? Unless you consider using them in the way that we are intended to use them as abuse.
---

Easily possible to print this as a flat piece, but I'd have to have three extruders to print the colours, or latex mask and paint each layer separately. 
---
U mad t.t
---
Hes annoying. Hes weak as he has no map pressure but will always win a chase
---
EW1 myers with shackle hag traps or muffler/file billy chainsaw.
---
WHY THE FUCK DID THAT FENG JUST SIT THERE IN FRONT OF ME AT THE GATE AND NOT HEAL ME?! I HAD ALMOST HEALED TO FULL WHEN MY MED KIT RAN OUT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HALF A SECOND BUT NO SHE JUST SITS THERE LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT AND THEN I END UP GETTING HIT BY THE HUNTRESS AND BEING THE ONLY PERSON KILLED IN THE GAME ARGH!
---
He's broken, not OP.
---
Even though people often use those terms interchangeably, they mean different things. The Legion breaks the game. They break game mechanics. But they still lose the game.
---
Yeah moonwalking. I say abusing it, because moonwalking is only one way to do it. There are other ways to do it that don't involve turning around. 
---
It‚Äôs not possible to finish all gens in under 2 minutes. I get it was an exaggeration but it was a poor one. 
---
I used a smoking splinter once and went from getting a DC (near the mid-game) and a 1 man to a full four man as Freddy...without perks or add-ons...against purple rank survivors. At rank 13. Because they just didn't wanna leave the way they were supposed to.
---
Yeah it's kinda shitty but some loops are just a bad idea to follow people through, part of being a good killer is knowing when to give up on/ignore survivors and move on to a new target. 
---
IF I LAND THE DECISIVE MID DRIBBLE I SHOULD GET TO STUN THE KILLER. 
---
Ruin's actually a somewhat frequent visitor. Like that weird uncle you don't know that gives the best presents when he visits your parents. BBQ is the convict dad that sends you 100 dollars every year or so.
---
And Overcharge is the little brother that you sorta like but goddamn he won't stop knocking on your door every 5 minutes to tell you about his Minecraft castle.
---
It's not worth it though
---
Agreed, Nadine Ross was a shitty character and her ‚Äúredemption‚Äù arc(s?) made zero sense.
---
No lol, just tired and annoyed of reading the same thread a million times.
---
The Legion‚Äôs power completely breaks chase mechanics, making chases completely unfun for survivors and giving away free hits to anybody halfway decent at playing them. When coupled with Frank‚Äôs Mixtape, this basically means free downs.
---
If you want a better explanation from somebody who‚Äôs played the game a lot longer than me, just search for Legion and you‚Äôll probably find it ^^
---
Give wraith the spirits power, the rework/buff he deserves.
---
Are you having an issue where sometimes you'll just get disconnected partway through a match?
---
What a dumbass lmao
---
ACE IS CHARLIE DAY IS NOW CANON. 
---
DAMNIT, NOW I HAVE TO LEVEL MY ACE. 
---
Okay, event lanterns, and escape icons. Those are event things, and players escape sometimes, so Obviously that means both are STUPID!
---
What‚Äôs the logic?
---
I suggest you watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqzBaPOnwtQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqzBaPOnwtQ)
---
Because I often see people here talking about Legion who don't have a clue why he is so broken and unfun to play against. This video explains it all very well.
---
Congrats? Your one of the pricks making the game shit for people who are trying to have fun. Please go back to fortnite where you belong.
---
Wow. You are very smart. 
---
you not turning your camera more is the real killer
---
Thanks üòé I'll no doubt release it at some point soon, but I'll let my friend have the exclusivity first.
---
I already sent u a message 
---
awwwww this is the best, sorry he didn't get any Valentine's Love!
---
Correction, you can't lose him, you can only make him give up the chase. So if he doesn't want to, you're either getting on a hook eventually or looping him for the whole duration of the match. 
---
IM JUST LEAVING
---
10/10 writing, so powerful. Slayy queen.
---
Honestly yes if you now how to play legion he's an amazing killer who can be over powered and most people will disconnect because of this but if you aren't trying to win then no I wouldn't buy
---
I don't like clown because he is boring. Idk, his release was just super underwhelming - like, what even was his lore?
---
I want one. Can I get one?
---
Teabagging is never a ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù move. This coming from a survivor main who hates when killers hit me on the hook or nod. Just don‚Äôt do it. 
---
Have they left the lanterns behind ?
---
"10 meters of distance" "5 second cooldown" I don't know which Dead by Daylight you're playing but we're not playing the same game lol.
---
It's kinda shitty on Pro too
---
hand it too her, but don't flip it over. 
---
She'll known your not giving her a shroud of seperation C:
---
Hes saying that survivors escape but didnt even pick up a lantern when escaping. I dont get it either because the killer can just destroy the lanterns after hooking someone if survivors arent picking them up
---
Happens to me on PC constantly. It seems to help if i grab from directly in front of the survivor though. Cheers.
---
It was Nea
---
cursed image
---
pwease killer, don‚Äôt dOwO it to us
---
One of my friends I play with is named David, and the other mains David King, so it gets pretty confusing for us sometimes lol 
---
Yes that‚Äôs true but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that legion is a 110 movement speed killer
---
110 chases are possible, though painful 
---
I know I was messing haha.
---
Don't be soft

Throw it back at him.

Oh thats given me an idea, I should print off the hidden side of the mori. üòéüòéüòé
---
Karma doesnt exist but if kids messaging you stupid shit bothers you guys just set your messages to private. This is discussed in almost every single gaming community. Yes people are assholes and feel safe behind a screen, we all know. Best course of action is to ignore them, or my favorite is to get them mad.
---
i hope you keep yourself safe
---
All I can say is slow down. I'm still on the newer side. I have had the game since launch but it wasn't until 2 weeks ago that I started playing daily. Knowledge is key. When the match starts, hide. Don't rush. Don't be a hero. I 100% of the time, locate a generator, hide in an area that I can see said Generator and wait for the killer. I do not touch a gen until I see 1 of 3 things. The killer visit the gen and I know who I am up against, the killer off in the distance moving around the map (I assume they will begin a chase and see someone before coming to my gen or someone blows a gen), or someone gets slapped. After 1 of these things I begin to go to work. As the other guy said, the game is hide and seek, and the hider has no defense besides running. Juking and skills come in to play but as someone who struggles in a chase, I'd rather just not get into one. I go for saves, I work on gens, and I'll sacrifice myself if needed, but I will always try to be the least seen person in the match. Taking an extra minute or two of hiding to take in as much knowledge as you can. 
---
Not that deep bro lol
---
Spoken like someone who doesn't have any responsibilities. Kids, SOs, and life get in the way sometimes. Does it suck being a man down? Sure. But it's not "selfish" and shitting on someone because they had to log-off and deal with kid puke or their SO is in tears and needs comforting is just being a toxic jerk. 
---
I think it all sounds good minus the iridescent shards bonus... you crazy... that's literally taking money out of behavior's pocket. They wont do that! (You can buy skins with them, if you had more shards ppl spend less on cells)
---
Hell yea man, smoking while playing is so fun!!
---
So some random person on the internet call your gf a "trash can" and you post about it on reddit.
---
I would of posted saying what a weakass insult he used.  Trash can is something a 5 year old would say, but I guess it worked on you judging by how you ended your post....  
---
Except it's not blacklisted
---
Nope, sadly
---
I think you wanna know if you can get banned for using MLGA? No.
---
I also highly suggest using it because the in-game ping indicator is terribly inaccurate and MLGA has saved me from a lot of laggy games.
---
The whole "getting hit through windows" thing *should* be fixed by Dedicated Servers.
---
Currently, you connect to servers via the Killer, which increases latency. With Dedicated Servers, you will connect directly to the server.
---
Scratched mirror, monitor and abuse
---
It's a specific build with his scratched mirror add-on that allows him to see through walls and being constant T1. Usually with monitor and abuse giving him next to no terror radius. 'Jumpscare Myers' lol
---
I'm not playing vs Freddy on console with this shit fps or letting you tunnel and mori everyone with your pink lameness.  Enjoy your 1 vs 3
---
This is only a low rank strat. On higher ranks you will play almost always vs swfs and this just will not work. Yes, I tried: useless on top ranks.
---
It's a small map with lots of corners and walls to hide your approach. pair it with the yellow rabbit add on and monitor and abuse, you'll be able to sneak up on survivors more often than not.
---
Also, have you ever run scratched mirror on lerys?  I had so much fun jumpscaring survivors
---
*Spikes to 500 when everyone readies up*
---
FUUUUUUU...
---
To close what ? You know billies chainsaw breaks pallets 
---
That's what you get for not looking around while doing a gen. ;)
---
20 seconds from a Survivor's perspective. It takes roughly 320 seconds for a generator to regress fully from 99%; meaning, from a Killer's perspective, it ypu are getting 80 seconds worth of regression.
---
Oh okay thanks! I'll watch the video and I am gonna use that build.
---
oooh thanks
---
I'm playing at rank 1. The nurse was able to end chases quickly, and with nurses calling could tell when we were being healed. We were not SWF. This is console btw, full swf group at rank 1will take forever to find a lobby, so I usually see groups of 2 or all solo.
---
Just repair gens and dip 
---
TL;DR: Booty Danced my way into Legion's heart, convincing him to let me finish a genny and help me find the hatch. 
---
I have a bit of an unfortunate habit of getting really disheartened when I see we have a Legion as the killer. I've found them to be rather cut throat and I honestly don't think weve ever opened the gates with a Legion.
---
So, a friend and I are playing and we see we're against a Legion killer. Unfortunate. It gets worse since by the time we have 1 generator finished, I'm the last person standing and im on my last hook. This guy was cut throat. So we spend 5 minutes running around the map, me avoiding him, he looking for me. I cant find the hatch and it wasnt even spawned because of the lack of finished generators. I eventually get bored of running and hiding from him so my friend and I thought it would be just hilarious to chase HIM around the map.
---
Eventually he turns around, sees me, and hits me. I immediately stop, and start bandaging myself. This seemed to kind of confuse him because he kind of stopped for a second, let me heal, then swiped at me again. I healed again, then started booty dancing around him. There happened to be a pallet nearby, so he went and stood next to the pallet and I ran over and hit him with the pallet and booty danced at him. 
---
To make an already pointlessly long story short, he lead me to a generator, let me finish it and he and I proceeded to scour the map, together, looking for the hatch. When we found it, he let me go; after I gave him a thank you booty dance, of course.
---
WHY ARE MOST MAPS IN FAVOR OF SURVIVORS? THERE ARE LIKE 3 MAPS AT MOST THAT COULD BE SAID TO FAVOR KILLER, AND EVEN THEN IT DEPENDS ON THE KILLER.
---
ALSO, WHY ARE TOTEM PLACEMENTS THE SAME? THEY STILL SPAWN OUT IN THE OPEN, SURVIVORS STILL SPAWN ON TOP OF THEM, THEY STILL SPAWN NEXT TO GENS... WHAT'S THE POINT OF SAYING YOU IMPROVED SOMETHING IN THE PATCH NOTES OF YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY IMPROVE IT? 
---
so you're not the last p3 myers?
---
Yeah, but they don't care; that's the problem. They don't need to rationalize it to make themselves feel better, they already don't feel bad. They know that they aren't going to be punished 
---
Sure you did bud
---
The whole point in cosplaying is recreating a character and geting all the details on point.
---
Go and look at your cosplay, it's literally blue with red rose patterns on it... smh
---
https://imgur.com/a/0LiLW52
---
then the topic of the axe, that's like if i was said "Dwight cosplay" and wore jakes jacket for dwights new messenger outfit.
---
It doesnt work like that lol
---
I like both his and Jeff's perks so I'd say go for it. I personally don't like Legion's gamestyle but if you think you'll like it, it's worth a try.
---
Though if you're missing other DLC, there's definitely better killers and perk sets out there.
---
Why can't you lose him? He doesn't have any extra hunting abilities, just that he can go over pallets and windows. 
---
Seems like a rip off of both Dead by Daylight and Friday the 13th the game. Kind of merged together in a mobile game. 
---
What are you even talking about...?
---
Same, I've starting having weird connection errors ever since the event started. Super weird 
---
not number of boxes remaining, i mean number of total boxes. So it there's 4 boxes then it'd be 25-25-25-100 
---
Oh god, I've made another scratched mirror Myers to jump scare me. What have I done? 
---
Lol, yeah it's a pretty fun build, you can practically imagine the survivor's shock when they turn a corner and run into your lap.
---
I once played that way too. Then I started actually going for risky plays, not leaving everyone behind and guess what? The game's way more fun. For you, the killer and also the other survivors who surely wanted to die on first hook. Also, you will probably get better at the game too when doing that.
---
That build tho... YIKES!
---
To slow the game down... just a little bit.
---
I'm stupid, I didn't see your flair lul
---
It looks like you just palleted him I dont get it
---
My friends always say it's "useless" compared to other perks because you can only see the killer for five seconds with the max perk. I can see why someone who doesn't use it would think it isn't useful, but seriously in that five seconds you can tell so much. If the killer starts walking one direction and changes his mind you have plenty of time to see where he is going. Not to mention at the early points in a match when you don't know who you're playing, once you get good you can tell what killer it is just by the silhouette! It's good shit
---
sorry it took me a couple mins to reply 
---
&lt;(\^\_\^&lt;) 
---
You would have died trying to save them. If the killer stayed away from your gate you could have YOLO'd it and go for the heal but with the red stain on your ass you need to go.
---
I say Thank You :) or GG :) and disconnect.
---
Does it matter? They're strangers on the internet. What they think is irrelevant. 
---
I'm more adventurous when there is no event. You like my build? :)
---
No. Only Legion has a worth while perk imo, Discordance. 
---
Is that all? I had to click the image to see if I was missing the nasty part. I understand that getting salty/braggy messages at all is annoying, but if that's the worst thing you've had somebody say to you, consider yourself lucky. 
---
Can you not see the blood coming off of me. And you can see that he hit me from really far away. 
---
That's not what YIKES means. ;)
---
Maybe he was trying to go back and get a lamp
---
Killer main, I had three players DC and just leave one poor guy all alone.
---
I figured I'd just hook him, and then we could go on and both get a good match. I'm not that interested in points, I want a good match.
---
But this little punk wasn't having it, he was like *I won't be euthanized just because my team was pussies!*  He came to survive, and that's what he intended to do.
---
I like tryhard, it's not supposed to be a casual game. I chilled until he had one gen and then went after him with everything I had, when he found the hatch, I yanked his ass back out, he wriggled free and made it.
---
After game he asked if I gave it to him, but I didn't. Great match.
---
P.s I might give up on this event when I get my 4th coin, it's a pain in the ass on both bloody sides...
---
What do you dislike about them?
---
YESTERDAY I WAS PLAYING AS PIG, DOWNED A NEA, WAS TRYING TO PUT A TRAP ON HER, BUT KEPT ACCIDENTALLY PRESSING THE CROUCH BUTTON PROBABLY THREE TIMES BEFORE I APPLIED THE TRAP. I THEN REALIZED IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS TEABAGGING. I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE THAT MUCH OF AN ASSHOLE, I DIDN'T MEAN IT, NEA, I WAS ACTUALLY JUST AN IDIOT
---
(ON PS4 btw)
---
Well from that build I can see that you are one of those people I really, really, really, really hate playing with.
---
Lol? I mean I can‚Äôt really prove it but take what you want I guess.
---
Which also wouldn't match the numbers.  Am I missing something?
---
Nah 
---
I feel this so much but no one seems to agree with me 
---
Some people don't do it because of that though. I know that during events, once in a while I'll ask the survivors if they want to farm. This is not as much for me as it is for them. Farming as killer is insanely boring once you've hooked everyone twice. But I just like being nice sometimes. 
---
Damn
---
https://me.me/i/when-you-finish-cleansing-the-totem-and-you-hear-dwight-5dcbbcdba68a4a6e85bb0c9c0ee02445
---
Amanda's letter is her best addon, combine it with the tape and its incredible when combined with map offerings for the game and Lerys
---
Shouldn't they all be about 25%?
---
You can easily trick the nurse with her teleports. It's far rarer to get a nurse that obliterates the survivors than it is to see a legion do the same with less of a downside.  
---
 There is a reason people don't D/C when they hear the nurse blink and scream opposed to the legion that most of the times guarantees at least one person saying  fuck it and d/c
---
this was the best event by far, loved those gens!
---
Gl getting this outside of SWF since people are fucking dc when killer breaks their LAMP
---
on the other hand this is the perfect time to get your adept killer trophies done lol
---
That‚Äôs just a worse Spirit at that point. 
---
not exactly sure what you mean by psycho killers? are you just.... salty that everyone got sacrificed?
---
Oh yeah for exit gates it would help. My keys just never last that long haha. At this point the only keys I use are the ones I randomly find in chests. 
---
What do you hate about a sneaky boi? 
---
"ding" its ready 
---
If you get a message after game saying that, they are probably just mad that they lost and want to blame somebody else instead of getting better at the game.
---
I PLAYED AGAINST A TRAPPER WITH OVER 1200 PING AND THEY CLAIMED THERE WAS NO LAG AND THEIR DEFENSE WAS THAT THEY RECORDED IT. I DID TOO BUDDY AND THERE'S FUCKIN LAG OUT THE ASS.
---
Does Freddy‚Äôs lullaby count? Having a perk where a small terror radius exists around the obsession would be an awesome idea and something I‚Äôve love to see!
---
I was talking about Freddy, as it seems like you believe I was talking about Legion if you talk about going over pallets. You can't lose him because he sees your aura in the Dream World once you are outside the Terror Radius while sleeping.
---
THE POINT BUFF WAS A JOKE IMO
---
I LOVE THE ORIGINAL MOVIES BUT HATE FREDDY TOO. EVEN IF THEY FIX HIM, I WON'T EVER PLAY AS HIM. 
---
There aren‚Äôt any, and to the best of our knowledge, there aren‚Äôt any plans to add any. Trust me we all want them LOL
---
I'd lower the terror radius range to 20 metres for tier 3. 32 is pretty insane in my opinion.
---
DEDICATED SERVERS PLS
---
For Masochist, is 4x for tier 3 or tier 1?
---
Yah
---
What‚Äôs toxic about wriggling?
---
This has gotten me killed, so many times.. (Xbox user)
---
relevant username
---
I said "probably". I'll do it seconds before the DBD servers shut down.
---
SOME PEOPLE DONT CARE ABOUT FAIRNESS UNFORTUNATELY
---
4x is tier one and it‚Äôs 4x faster progression.
---
Weird flex
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not sure what he means.... they‚Äôre new killers so they have one perk..
---
Am i the only one that really doesnt hate playing against any killer in particular? I don‚Äôt think Legion is as bad as people are making it out to be
---
There are certainly reasons not to save your team, but often it's done because people aren't good enough at the game.  NOED is often an easy pickup if you have 2 people alive not yet hooked, and the save really depends on how the killer is playing it and where the hook is.  Facecamp saves are made easier by 2-3 survivor coordination and borrowed time.  I'm all for running out with an item or daily, but it's so much more fun to try and make a save (unless really hard camp and it's just you).
---
I mean sure, id just rather have the hallowen DLC
---
If you get 4k'd by a killer with 1 perk active, that says more about you than them.
---
NOED...
---
Of course, but you had 0 speed. Billy needs speed to break a pallet.
---
Test it yourself 
---
I always think that it is better to blame shit on report system after you used it with no effect rather than blame shit without any data to back you up. 
---
STOP FUCKING WHINING ABOUT TUNNELING! I'M A KILLER!! I'M SUPPOSED TO KILL YOU!!!! IF YOU UNHOOK YOUR BUDDY BUT DON'T BLOCK FOR HIM, OR DIVERT MY ATTENTION TO YOU, I'M GOING AFTER HIS ASS!!! 
---
Ah, I see. I love these concepts except for the last perk. I think it will only be used for survive with friends. 
---
Myers is the easiest
---
Well, people like that mostly urban evade around the map not doing anything, constantly crouching behind something (even if the killer is on the other side of the map hooking someone) and when they get found instantly get downed because they don't know how to run the killer around for more than 2 seconds. 
---
And even if they do, the most likely will just run from pallet to pallet and camp them, wasting every pallet so when someone who is actually good at the game gets chased has nothing to work with.
---
I see. That's a shame. I feel like even a small reward would go a long way for the community.
---
Trapper or Clown would be cool. Pig is so overdone it bores me, same with Huntress and Legion. Myers wouldn't really be DBD themed if you're going for that amd Doctor would be pretty difficult to pull off.
---
You mean the data OP gave? Ofc it wouldn't match-I'm just giving an alternate option for the devs
---
Most people have Hex:Ruin and those who don't run it don't want to. There won't be much of a difference.
---
I did the exploit, and I rightly got banned for it (My ban expires at just before 7 pm EST tonight at which point I'll see what happened to my characters), I knew the risk when I did it, and have paid the price for it. The problem that is going on is that BHVR stated on multiple outlets that doing this exploit would lead to a temporary ban.........and nothing else. They never said they would roll back anything on your account if you got caught, and the harshness that some have allegedly received is just flat-out uncalled for. They literally went out ad publicly stated what the punishment would be and are now piling on more than they stated without any announcement beforehand. That's where they open themselves up to liability.
---
EZZZZZZZZ
---
they had a recent post that the community manager escalated to the dev team to look at, it included increase and lump sum rewards of bloodpoints, shards, and cells for seasons and devotion ranks (player level 100,200,etc) not sure if any of it will happen.
---
Alright thanks for the insight
---
Link
---
It‚Äôs just meant to be an inverse dying light. It‚Äôs not an amazing perk but it‚Äôs not terrible either.
---
Yeah.. that's why I'm not really worried about him.... plus lots of people will probably go as him.. I've never seen a pig 
---
Lmao 5 seconds is so long. They have to use it themselves to see how crazy good it is.
---
It makes sense for the survivor but I wouldn't want to run it while I'd like to use the other two.
---
Jeffs perks are actually pretty fun.  That being said they arent meta, so i'd say its optional. (Legion isnt fun.)
---
I think everyday it cant go lower yet am amazed every time I check this sub.
---
As killer, you'll see a lot of survivors rant about how you "suck" or you're "trash/noob" because you killed them and didn't play the way they wanted you to. Just ignore it.
---
I expect EVERY killer to be a try hard just as much as I expect every survivor to be a try hard. That's what the game is about! Try hard to kill everyone or try your hardest to survive.
---
r/unexpecteddarkestdungeon
---
I have a problem with legion ,, i cant win with 4 kills most of the time i kill 1 or 2 at max , the rest end up surviving but injured .. any idea what my problem is? 
---
probably not, at least I'd be shocked if they did. They have only been talking about it for over 2 years now.  Must be super hard to come up a idea and implement in the game
---
Well I'm not "big" enough for clown (trying not to fat shame) and I've never seen a pig... trapper I guess would be cool but I think I'd be cold... plus my skin tone isn't dark enough (now I'm trying not to be racist!)
---
Wraith killer?
---
Unless every survivor is doing it, I dont see why you even bother attempting to chase them. Unless they‚Äôre the last guy left and just being as asshole to you. 
---
I've got shards to burn. Best killer to purchase with them?
---
I never got a message. My psn is exotic1234
---
I would love to see the backstories of every survivor in a cinematic. They could explain why Ace is with Hag, maybe when he escaped the mafia or the people who where after him, he hid in the swamp. Other than that, i see no relation with both. 
---
Punch him in the mouth. Next question 
---
hahaha well the post was recent but i bet they have ‚Äútalked‚Äù about it for a while and as you know they dont want to give more away, some people too thirsty for the grind
---
I‚Äôm gonna pretend that was funny
---
He's got a boombox on his back 
---
Just to buy a little bit of time.
---
Alright. Also I was wondering what sensitivity I should use for the killer and survivor? Personally I found it‚Äôs hard to juke with a low sens.
---
Really good at the game already...!  4k's all round, just breezing through and can hardly do any gens.  We don't stand a chance against them etc..
---
Yes salty!
---
If you've only got one perk running then it's got be your first game or 2 with that killer, especially with all the kills/points they're getting.
---
Well if it‚Äôs green there‚Äôs no hope using it lol 
---
Maybe you aren‚Äôt good at survivor?
---
Feel free to. Was only quoting him
---
Greylisted. :)
---
No. She's fine.
---
Still. Wtf.
---
not necessarily, killers can be prestiged and levelling from 1 again. The other day I prestiged my huntress and only had enough to level 17, all low tier perks and yellow add-ons but still got a 4k.
---
sometimes you just have bad games you know? some night I escape every game and some nights I never escape. That's just the nature of the game
---
Lmao
---
SHOULDA JUST TOLD ME YOU WERE BAD AND LET ME WIN. NUB
---
That is the biggest flex possible
---
Odd flex, but okay.
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
That's a good idea lol, looking forward to the males. :3
---
And not see the exit gates open
---
Sounds less like a lag switch and more like the guy is playing on mars
---
Not many perks affect the killer‚Äôs sound notification, good idea!
---
Xbox was lucky to have the +25 bug the longest. 
---
Got to 6 coins without too much hassle, but I kind of wished I grinded the shit out of it. Would have been working for the last coin right now.
---
But yeah, gotta get that Ace hair + pants. Those are really sweet!
---
To be fair that stanky noed would hit em quicker than that gate could open.
---
So at these ranks all survs get killed every game by killers that run only one perk? But not so much by killers that use 4 perks...
---
Cheers.
---
Well, he failed the challenge. 
---
His point was - with Legion you can't even loop or run away, you go down because his power is busted and ruins the game harder than Nurse
---
\*Posts picture of just myself as a boosted Miss-Cleo dress &amp; head Claudette with Morf shirt, fancy red top, or sweater, depending on mood &gt;.&gt;
---
Nah, I do have a friend who plays David and one who plays Laurie that join sometimes, but they are very thankfully super casual at the game and we wind up dying a lot and laughing about it. It puts the game into perspective and I love it. 
---
that's true but I'd rather take what BP I have than DC. I already invested time in this game and I WILL come away with something
---
No.
---
They could be trying a different killer out.
---
Since the legion/engine update its gotton worse, mainly with the screen freezing during status affects
---
Thanks so much for all the advice. I don‚Äôt have devout hope on her, how essential is it?
---
DO ALL FREDDYS TODAY HAVE A DAILY TO DISCONNECT IN ORDER TO DENY SURVIVOR THEIR POINTS JUST BECAUSE THEY PLAYED AWFULLY? I'VE HAD 4 AFTER THE OTHER, I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TWO BUT COME ON THAT'S ALWAYS LOW
---
Unless it's Legion.
---
Wtf dude that's unfair.
---
B-but hag is D tier!!! Opinions can‚Äôt be wrong, but the community has been proven wrong!! /s
---
Touch√©, but they never made far enough into the game to use it.
---
that way, at least the Killer would get some points
---
Someone should made a Tyde Tyme Quotes tier list

It‚Äôs not essential. When it comes to nurse, nothing is essential truly. You need to learn her inside out. Fail a thousand times just to get that little progress with her. It‚Äôs all about your skill with her in the end as she doesn‚Äôt really benefit from neither addons or perks. But I like devour on her, because it‚Äôs fun how everybody is brave until they see that notification on their screen lol
---
Use make your choice instead. Or noed for shit and giggles. Whatever makes you happy in the end really :)
---
He is most defenetly not mediocre, for starters.
---
The main issue is he is so fucking unfun to play against, you can't run away unless he is literally autistic.
---
You also can't hide because his power won't let you.
---
As soon as I see franks mixtape or cold dirt I just DC because honestly, I want to have fun, and that shit is not fun.
---
What's is it a representation of then?  Higher ranked players aren't better than low ones?
---
Okay, thanks man.
---
Earlier i was in a game against Michael, our team was getting downed left and right. Exept for myself, as stealth master ming. 
---
As he reaches evil within 3 and downs someone, i notice a flaming totem... i hesitate, but decide to cleanse it. 
---
Low and behold it was a haunted grounds, thanks to that, after hooking the survivor the enemy killer manages to turn around and spot my two stupidly altruistic teammates. Instantly downs them both as i watch from afar. Was amusing to say the least.
---
When you play dead by daylight and you‚Äôre about to DIE?!!!!
---
Anyone experienced that before? hooked the survivor and this lantern just didnt turn red
---
If I ever have this ping in the lobby the game is a lag-switching sh*t show 
---
I would like to see NOED be changed to something like,
---
Survivors on the hook become sacraficed 20/30/40% faster.
---
Maybe not NOED specifically but just a perk that encourages killers to play more actively during endgame and not have to worry about camping on a hook to secure a kill
---
Terrorism's at a new high
---
&gt;You can easily trick the nurse with her teleports
---
Then you're playing against a bad nurse. Good Nurses don't get tricked. They'll blink in spots where any Survivor option will lead to a hit. 
---
Example, Survivor goes around corner and waits for Bad Nurse to blink -&gt; Bad Nurse blinks, trying to predict movement -&gt; Survivor runs opposite way -&gt; Bad Nurse misses.
---
Survivor runs around a corner -&gt; Good Nurse blinks to corner's edge -&gt; Survivor now can't make any decision to avoid a hit, it's up to the Nurse to misplay -&gt; Good Nurse blink-hits.
---
Why are you even trying to argue whether Legion or Nurse is worse? Let me finish this for you, Nurse is worse but take skill. Legion is easy but not as good.
---
Aight, thanks.
---
Still the same rank though... 
---
Looks pretty 2D, could have printed that with a regular printer and save some money
---
SHIT I'M PLAYING THE WRONG GAME THEN
---
Well excuse my whoosh I guess, I never know who‚Äôs being serious or not on this sub, so my bad. At least you and I agree that he‚Äôs not all that bad he just gets memes because of the occasional thing even if I did woooosh myself there.
---
Doctor would be awesome.. But hard to pull off..
---
Even survivors are playing legion
---
No they *generally* are. But people like to purposely derank and do what I call ‚Äúseal clubbing‚Äù new players.
---
And sometimes an idiot makes it to rank 1 somehow. It just isn‚Äôt accurate, especially around rank 15.
---
Yeah... that's why I'm asking really early 
---
He‚Äôs right, but I understand because you‚Äôre rank 17
---
Sometime soon üòé
---
WHY THE FUCK IS THERE ALWAYS ONE FUCKING GUY WHO DOESN'T HIT READY AND WAITS FOR THE TIMER TO END WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING FOR AN ENTIRE FUCKING MINUTE.
---
I don't want to be in your head
---
It's both. He doesn't have map pressure so well coordinated teams will end the match quick and be done with him. However, once in chase it is literally impossible to lose him due to mend/moonwalking.
---
The two don't have to be mutually exclusive. No one is saying he's overpowered. Broken just means that his kit doesn't work as intended and leads to an undesirable style of play.
---
An actual interesting idea. Wow.
---
I DON'T FEEL THE PIG IS BAD AT ALL. IN FACT, I PLAY HER NOW MORE THAN ANY OTHER KILLER. WHAT RANK AND WHAT PLATFORM DO YOU PLAY ON?
---
I mean they have to be dead for the perk to activate and by the time one person is dead the game is usually decided. I can‚Äôt see this perk being useful past two people running it.
---
I'm just dissing ya. Good job by tge way, looks very professional
---
SHE GOT THE BEST BODY OF ANY KILLER. I CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE LEWD HER. MOMMY HUNTRESS' **T H I C C N E S S** IS UNMATCHED 
---
Made the changes with the exception of seeing blood (He shouldn't need that as he can still see scratch marks, and when they're bleeding their making noise you can track anyway barring certain perks) and I left Writ of Habeas Corpus at 2 seconds since it's already different enough.
---
Any good suggestions for another perk? I feel like "Has a chance to not drop survivors" would really help a "Carry survivors to find other survivors" build, but that seems kinda dumb on any build other than that.
---
I think she's fine how she is, much like Spirit there's a specific play style to counter her in chases, and good luck getting a 4K against stealthy survivors. 
---
You feel like the devs could do it? 
---
Even on Xbox and PS4 the game runs like utter garbage. 
---
Before they manage to get those two on a stable level, a switch version would be unbearable.
---
Yeah, he can still see everything except the Survivors :P
---
That's true,
---
I guess just like most things in this game i can see swf groups abuse it to a point
---
I don't see why rewarding time and skill with more frequent wins is a problem.
---
I meant in general, tydes a dumbass.
---
Be Hag
---
There was a recent fuckup from the devs with an exploit you could do to gain prestige on any character and as soon as the devs found out they jumped on it and banned everyone AND removed every single bit of progress (including all teachables gained) on any character that was not already P3-50 (say goodbye to any p3-40/level 50/P1 characters etc) and yet all these people who are actually hurting the game still run around when this exploit served no hindrance to other players whatsoever. 
---
In 1.3 p3 Claudettes were very unusual, you mostly saw MegHeads and Locker Dwights
---
It's because they're there to help him track you down, not so much anything else. His power is kind of a detriment to him outside of his Terror Radius, so those addon's are specifically about helping him not have to stay in one part of the map and actually track down people.
---
Great minds think alike :D
---
Because getting out of his power is pure RNG and when you're asleep, he can always see you and everything is slow as fuck. It's not very fun.
---
MAYBE HE DOES THAT ON PURPOSE TO QUICKLY GET A BATHROOM BREAK. STREAMERS DO IT SOMETIMES THAT'S WHY I KNOW
---
5 year anniversary. Mark my words.
---
But she can't see through walls without situational perks. Stealth is her main counter. When a Nurse is fatigued she might as well be flashlight blinded for how much she can see.
---
I agree completely
---
correction: if you DC against anything against Nurse, or Legion. you're an asshole.
---
Fuck off
---
I never said it was toxic? It‚Äôs a you lost but I‚Äôll give you hatch if you don‚Äôt wiggle. It‚Äôs simple a unknown challenge to the survivor I do for fun.
---
Lol what?
---
all of the upvotes
---
Haha, best of luck.. And we OBVIOUSLY expect photographic evidence.. üëç
---
He's right, this was a 180. If it was a 360 you would've continued to go into the corn as that's the direction you were running before the spin.
---
I think it comes down to what you class as a crutch perk. For me a crutch perk is any perk I become reliant and lean on constantly, like a crutch. So for me I would agree Self care could be a crutch perk as a lot of people use it and rely on it to survive. 
---
CAMPING PIECE OF SHIT LEGION THAT KEEPS TUNNELING ME UNTIL I'M SACRIFICED 
---
LMFAO I mean sure but what's worse: someone who does that regardless of how the killer has played, or, someone who has done a small and simple exploit that is purely aesthetic and serves no competitive advantage? 
---
Buy him with auric cells don't be a dummy
---
You certainly did a great job!
---
Love it!
---
Hahaahahahahahahah
---
HOOOOO BOY THIS EVENT HAS MADE SOME REAL SALTY KILLERS. 80% OF GAMES END WITH THE KILLER DCING WHEN THEY SEE THEIR PREY RUNNING FOR THE GATE SO THEY CAN'T GET LANTERN COINS. PRETTY SAD
---
No. The challenge is getting to rank 1 using no perks the entire time. He has got gud. 
---
That depends if I can be bothered to make it.. it will cost loads 
---
The Cost of Preparedness.
---
Measured now in gold.
---
Later..... in blood.
---
BBQ has so many counters i don't understand how i ever see anyone's aura with it...
---
There are already non pallet non window ballet locations. So the current description is accurate while your version is not. That's why.
---
Man I‚Äôm glad we can see eye to eye on that
---
I will do this if the survivors dont do anything too toxic.
---
If you‚Äôre gonna head in a more realistic direction with your style, ditch the thick black outlines. Real life dosen‚Äôt have outlines and if you put the two together you end up with really off looking work, it makes things look a lot more flat.
---
That's not what the dedicated server change is going to do.
---
Games with dedicated servers like CS:GO measure your ping **end-to-middle**; Alice has 50 ping to the server, Bob has 50 ping to the server, messages have to travel Alice&lt;-&gt;Server&lt;-&gt;Bob, so Bob sees Alice's actions (1/2)(Bob's own ping of 50ms) + (1/2)(Alice's ping of 50ms) = 50ms after she performs them.
---
Games with "p2p" connections like DBD measure your ping **end-to-end**; Bob has 100 ping to Alice, messages travel directly Alice&lt;-&gt;Bob, so Bob sees Alice's actions (1/2)(Bob's ping to Alice of 100ms) = 50ms after she performs them.
---
100 ping in DBD will "feel like" two players with 50 ping each in CS:GO. The exact same physical connection will tell Alice and Bob they have 100 ping to eachother in DBD, and a combined 100 ping in CS:GO. Depending on where the dedicated server is, that 100 ping could be split between them unevenly. If the dedicated server ends up being out of the way, it could even be more than a 100 ping, because now the physical connection between them has more nodes to hop.
---
DBD just shows people their ping in a way that confuses them because they're not used to it. Your ping in DBD isn't actually twice as bad as it is in CS:GO.
---
It costs more money if I want both Jeff and legion
---
Neither do I üòÇ
---
I feel your pain. Have about 150 hours in game and I usually play survivor. I got to rank 7 and playing with survivors/killers with similar playtime/experience to me was extremely fun.
---
Now I'm being matched up with 2000 hour billy's and nurses. I don't mind dying in a game, I don't mind depipping if the killer is just straight up better but god playing against a killer like that is just impossible.
---
Just had a game with a long time player playing as P3 billy and we all died in 3 minutes with no generators done. This is literally not fun and super discouraging. 
---
This idea is extremely OP tho.
---
Yeah pretty much but I wouldn‚Äôt consider a 2 day ban ‚Äúdoing your time‚Äù. The ban should‚Äôve lasted minimum until the end of the event and maximum until 2.6.0 but a total reset was a horrible decision on their part. 
---
As presented, this is incredibly OP
---
I love hooking someone when they are screwing around. Like, y'all shoulda left when the gate opened and now you're dead.
---
Everyone who did the prestige exploit (A LOT OF PEOPLE) got banned for 2 days (some even more if they got double banned due to a report) and had every character reverted to level 1 without ANY teachables whatsoever. 
---
How would you balance it?
---
Hey buddy.... why is freddy there? Think he's gonna kill ya bud...
---
Haddonfields only place with any spawn that can even be considered a pseudo would be Laurie‚Äôs house. It‚Äôs also very easy to counter by any killer. However if a killer does not try to counter the loop it is an infinite. 
---
Huh interesting I'm playing on ps4 pro usually don't have a problem with crashing- sometimes a long wait for match making. I've never been able to transition to pc for whatever reason 
---
‚ÄúNIGHTMAN AHHHHH FIGHTER OF THE DAYMAN AHHHH‚Äù
---
This happened on PC for killer queues after Spirit was released and they blamed it again on too many people playing one side but even after they tried a similar fix it didn't change anything. 
---
Trust me its fucking harsh. Its a bigger punishment than people get for hindering the actual gameplay and all this exploit business did was reduce the grind and give an AESTHETIC CHANGE. 
---
Use Mobility to get to survivor for first hit. 
---
Cooldown after successful hit. 
---
Cannot use power immediately afterward. 
---
Chase survivor at less than 115% until power recharged or survivor potatoes into you. 
---
Is this the Spirit or the Nurse change you mention? 
---
Wouldn't they at least use a teachable perk?
---
And to answer the second part of your question, it doesn't really matter how many characters you play. For example, I like playing as David, although I could play someone else with the same perks. Play what you enjoy. But when you start to play, there are certain perks you should get, like for example Self-care. I would also recommend Kindred (neutral perk, that you can get on anyone). It's a very useful perk at low ranks, as it gives you better chances of being saved by your unexperienced teammates. 
---
I had the impression that you let people leave if they weren‚Äôt toxic. That‚Äôs why I said that, sorry if I misunderstood.
---
Is it because not wriggling is like ‚Äúoof guess you‚Äôve given up, here, here‚Äôs a win‚Äù or is a more arbitrary reason? 
---
I‚Äôm on regular ps4 and my game will probably crash twice a week but the main problem is definitely the fps 
---
My dumb ass got downed 2 metres away from hatch and the Wraith picks me up, stands above it (I knew he wasn't going to give it to me) shakes his head and hooks me. I fucking snorted.
---
He was new and people hadn‚Äôt found out any of the bullshit he can do. It happens with pretty well every new killer, they‚Äôre either shit or op until people play around with them.
---
In legions case it‚Äôs not even that he‚Äôs op (unless they have franks mixtape) it‚Äôs just incredibly unfun to play against. 
---
jarvs is a fingermichaelmyers mind_fucked weary sweat_drops eggplant tongue eyes screenshot_14 
---
First thing this morning I noticed a difference but it paired me (red rank) with a level 2, 7 &amp; 15. Killer was a rank 20 with 1 perk. 
---
As the morning went on the queue times got longer and longer until I gave up and swapped to killer 
---
IT IS TOO LATE. YOUR MISTAKE HAS BRED A TOXIC SURVIVOR, SPREADING THEIR UNINTENDED DESPAIR OVER THEIR MATCHES LIKE A PLAGUE
---
i remember trutalent saying he was good and getting 4k's over and over, even pointed this out around the first week and everybody called me a dumb lmao. This community is a hive mind
---
I don‚Äôt think Xbox give out monthly free games like PlayStation plus users do... so I don‚Äôt believe so.[Dbd ‚Äòspecial‚Äô edition](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dead-by-daylight-special-edition-xbox-one/5859438.p?skuId=5859438&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;ds_rl=1266837&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;ds_rl=1269132&amp;ds_rl=1266837&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqOriBRAfEiwAEb9oXfLe7W3o8ZTT8IdwylNeRISrsJ_NoVHCMJxVEG3sBU_HIGS7KLEqaRoCaLAQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) 
---
Yeah but I mean the ban time was their choice, I agree it should have been longer but resetting all progress is just too much for such a meaningless exploit that didn't even affect the gameplay itself. 
---
if he's moonwalking he cannot see your player
---
Just strap a car battery to your head and call it a day.. Pass out Flintstones vitamins, in the process.. People will know you're A doctor, at least. üòÇ
---
For all we know moonwalking was intended
---
It is very similar to DBD but far more grindy. Also, chases are almost impossible, since the killer can see you all the time because of the isometric top-down view of the maps. When you're injured, you leave literal bloody footsteps and you walk only half as fast. I tried it for a bit, but I didn't really have fun.
---
Console so none. 
---
You deserve a gg for not using ruin in rank 1. However, I guess it makes sense if you're a good nurse
---
Lol noed at rank 1.  Jesus man.
---
Hey man, how are you doing ?
---
Probably for the best
---
It use to be really bad for me but my frames have been stable for a while so its doing good no frame drops 30 is not bad 
---
Google marth88 depip squad. There's a spreadsheet with all of their games as well as some dbd forum posts from people who played them 
---
Before the event started.
---
Some characters have useful teachable perks (perks that are only to that character until you level them up high enough). Its useful to get at least most characters to a high enough level to get them so you can transfer them to all other characters
---
The only thing I hate more than playing Legions is listening to any amount of Linkin Park.  
---
From my experience, legions have a higher ‚Äúcool‚Äù rate. No clue why. When I think back to all the killers who let me farm at the end or at least let me escape.. legion gets the most tallies. 
---
Using ruin is useless! Gets broken within one minute anyway
---
Yeah br√∂ther
---
What system were you on?
---
He‚Äôs a weak killer but 0 fun to play vs 
---
All you need to do that is watch an Ardetha stream/video.
---
Steel curtain is just plain useless. Just take third seal if you want the same affects but better since it applies to everyone once you hit them. Spirit fury is great on anyone other than spirit, nurse, and huntress btw
---
What adept was it?
---
It‚Äôs because they all started out as that kind of survivor
---
do they not have black female legos?
---
I need the achievement as well so I‚Äôd be down to join a SWF with you
---
Last 3 nurse games that i've had i had 0 d/cs. Last 5 legion games(yeah just today) I've had atleast one person d/c every single time.
---
In future, you can report in the post game screen, there's a box next to the names with two thumbs in it. 
---
Borrowed time, self care, empathy, and hope for helping other get out at the end
---
Oh that‚Äôs cool to hear I didn‚Äôt know that but it would definitely be quite lucky to see dbd in cycle over there
---
Oooh yes, I did that. Is there any way I can send them a video?  Or explain what happened?  I'm on ps4.
---
I second this
---
If this perk was specific to either totems or generators and the amounts were 1 second with a set number of tokens that stacked, it could be balanced. I.E. 1 generator is 1 token = 1 second delay, 2 gens - 2 tokens - 2 seconds, etc... And the cap on tokens could be what changes with the perks rank. I suggest 2/3/4 tokens. 5 seconds might be a little crazy, but it is a delay not a complete cancel and requires that you either worked on all 5 completed gens or cleansed every totem. So, it might be okay as 3/4/5 tokens. Great idea 
---
Hello
---
Pallet loop him like any other killer. It's even worse for him because he can't camp a hook like other killers. 
---
sounds like KWF
---
Preach!
---
Ace is love, Ace is life!
---
Ok, tyvm
---
Enduring is that aunt who you think is really cool but after a few visits you hate her
---
They do, and many other skin types for their non-yellow sets like Marvel/Star Wars/Harry Potter/etc. 
---
If you want constant DC's, neverending Toxicity in end game chat. Sure, and good luck to you.
---
Having lobby wait times of over 20 minutes. Makes me ask myself what I'm doing with my life.
---
Yes, just google deadbydaylight support. You‚Äôll need the names and some ID# you can get from your PS4 
---
It was The Clown. Deciding to get the Adept achievements at low ranks was a real pain in the bum.
---
Yeah but you can tell exactly when he's using Franks mixtape or Cold dirt because it's a really massive boost.
---
And it's the only time I dc. I don't mind campers, I don't mind Freddy, I don't mind noed. Even tombstone is fine... I even don't mind Legion with some other perks. But when I see this shit I don't wanna waste my time with the shittiest match possible.
---
I also underatand if anyone on my team dcs because od Legion. He is just so unfun to play against
---
They'll have data from the match, they should be able to get the guy, you can upload to YouTube, or here and call-out the assholes though 
---
Hey bb. Hope ur okay. PM me?
---
NIGHTMAN COMES WITH 3 PERKS:
---
-THE BOY‚ÄôS SOUL
---
-MASTER OF KARATE
---
-THE TROLL TOLL
---
I'm sure it was. Glad you got the achievement
---
I like how OP has responded to comments except for the many ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the context?‚Äù ones. 
---
That so mean it's funny. 
---
So they can just insidious from a distance away and then insta tunnel? Or survivors could rush the hook to keep the killer around making the timer last longer? Too many issues.
---
r/unexpectedRE
---
By any chance is there a map online that has the totem spawns marked?
---
WHERE THE FUCK DID THE POINTS GO FOR SMASHING LANTERNS?! I WAS GETTING 1500 EACH ONE UNTIL THIS MORNING!
---
I would love to have an insane survivor. I like Jester. 
---
WHY ARE THE DEVS SO BAD AT PROGRAMMING THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN MAKE DEAD HARD WORK WHEN I HAVE OTHER KEY FOR RUNNING? 
---
MY KEYBOARD IS TERRIBLE, THAT'S WHY I PREFER TO USE CAPS AS MY RUNNING KEY, BUT THE DEVS ARE SO BAD THAT I AM FORCED TO USE SHIFT TO GET THIS DAMN PERK TO WORK. IT'S NOT EVEN SOMETHING THAT HARD TO FIX!!!
---
WHY ARE YOUR WORDS VIBRATING?!
---
Nah I'm talking about the pig bitch in dbd.
---
If Survivor disconnects within 30 seconds of the match starting, it should automatically cancel the match.
---
Until your boss breaks it
---
I still don't quite grasp how it works. For instance you say in your original post:
---
&gt; for each
---
^ this usually implies that it stacks. Otherwise, why would it be "for each?"
---
So putting together what you wrote in your OP, and in your reply here, I'm going to try and describe my understanding of it.
---
"whenever a survivor completes a generator, cleanses a totem, or saves a survivor off a hook, the next notification caused by the acting survivor is delayed by 4/6/8 seconds"
---
Is that accurate?
---
Also the reason devs put in Distortion and changed Surveillance is because generators get repaired way too quickly and now killers have some options other than Ruin and Pop Goes The Weasel to control that. I don't think a perk that counters that change so strongly could feasibly go through.
---
So toxic for no reason. 
---
What does Amanda's letter do?
---
And my axe! 
---
When the baby killer finally gets to use his first ebony mori
---
I would love to have a Nea one. This is awesome! 
---
ITS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WRAITH IS RIGHT NEXT TO THEM WHEN THEY START RUSHING FOR THE SAVE.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself
---
I hope you bought that dlc for Jeff and not legion..
---
For each is in reference to every generator/hex totem/survivor save that the survivor with the perk completes. By the way, I respect your insightful criticism. I wish there were more like you.
---
Underrated advice. I started playing yesterday.
---
Source?
---
Speaking of fucking which literally right after reading this I go in a match and a guy dced 2 seconds it and it was a godamn iridescent head and infantry belt huntress
---
You're a brave soul. Without ruin I feel like I'm at a major disadvantage
---
Hex: Justalittlebit
---
She's still not going to fuck you.
---
In all honesty, I try not to dodge. If it looks like a rough SWF group with all prestige, I know I'm about to get graped. 
---
But I can learn from that, and be a better killer. 
---
I know she's not. üòé
---
That's a god pallet bro.  They have to break it.  Use it wisely.
---
Dude, such an OP spot, there's not even another way around.
---
He can't but he can clearly see what area you went into and once you break chase, it causes the wounds tick so unless you get back in chase then you'll be in a very specific area defenseless.
---
Within 12 meters while crouched, you can see survivor‚Äôs auras
---
The godliest is god pallets
---
[When the killer's connection is coming from inside your house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkcGm-pWwsQ)
---
As soon as you learn how to pallet loop, he becomes one of the worst killers in the game. He's still playable at most ranks, but he has a much harder time than most other killers.
---
WHY THE FUCK DO THEY HAVE NOED BE SUCH A BULLSHIT PERK. GOOD TO KNOW I DID ALL THIS WORK POPPING GENS JUST TO GET INSTANTLY SMACKED DOWN, HOOKED, AND FACE CAMPED AT THE END OF THE MATCH SO I DON'T GET MY FUCKING LANTERN
---
Thank you =)
---
Only reason that‚Äôs not in is for these cowpokes with poop fetishes.Though it would sell better for the game
---
&gt; I respect your insightful criticism
---
Thank you. I like talking about game play balance and mechanics and too often people frame it in a way where their concern is "does this affect the role I main as negatively?" then go from there.
---
This is a good idea you have. Just needs to fit properly into the mechanics.
---
&gt; For each is in reference to every generator/hex totem/survivor save that the survivor with the perk completes.
---
Right, I understand that. But what does it mean? What does each one cause to happen? Does each one create a token? A stack? 
---
I know, right?! Wth!
---
The meme is ruined!
---
They don't care if you use it because once they get dedicated servers going, it won't be viable any more. If they didn't have dedicated servers coming soon, they would probably be more strict about it.
---
Wow. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. 
---
How often do they reply, ‚Äúgg ez, git gud‚Äù?
---
She cant see through walls but her speed of flying across the map to unpredictable places at that is unrivaled. Stealth is sweet, but if you arent near a gen as she will more likely then not find you anyway. With bbq she can hook and guarantee to be on the next person she sees 100% of the time every time. 
---
We'd just get better at blinking.
---
If they‚Äôre new players than no they wouldn‚Äôt know any better
---
Needs more jpeg
---
If your teammates are clearly trying to save you and not doing gens, camping to punish their altruism is the smart thing to do 
---
Thank you very much, say goodbye to the post
---
A screenshot from a monto video that was posted on this sub about 300 times with different context. Hopefully it becomes a meme now so it can finally die. Not because it is bad, but I don't like shit being reposted a billion times.
---
You should focus on getting good at the game instead of posting counterproductive ideas on Reddit :)
---
Yes I read the last paragraph but I want to emphasize this.
---
Didnt know that about bbq thanks for the info and ya I will probably get those perks from billy for sure now.
---
When people try to outsmart me by running at me I just start undershooting. 
---
Nothing like having them run right back into you before they do a backflip.
---
Good nurses adapt.
---
I would but I‚Äôm a cheap date
---
A Meg did this to me once, but then she unhooked herself. She didn‚Äôt even have deliverance which means it was just an unlucky day for me.
---
Depends...
---
TECHNICALLY, getting your teammates killed IS a legit playstyle, and isn't bannable, as long as it's not targeted at specific people, and the surv and killer cannot know each other.
---
Look up Evil Dwight for more info :)
---
I didnt know that about bbq, now i am really looking forward to it, it should speed up the process.
---
The more blinks the longer the stun. If you attack, you get maximum stun, even if you miss.
---
Don't attack unless you can hit or you'll just waste more time.
---
Thanks man, this is why I ask questions in here.
---
When your blinded, does that cause you to drop the survivor immediately? Or just makes the wriggling out go faster.
---
Haven't played hillbilly yet, been having fun with trapper and huntress.
---
Gave the clown a few goes for the daily's and get gutter stomped every time haha
---
Once I was the last survivor left and unfortunately got found by Daddy Myers before I could find the hatch. Begging for my life I started to spin on the ground, a desperate wiggle to make contact. And Daddy Myers responded by spinning too. We officially bonded!
---
So he picked me up and I didn't struggle. As I was his friend now, Daddy Myers carried me around for a good while until he found the hatch on top of a hill. I was filled with joy and hope, yet a bit heartbroken as I'd have to leave my lovely Daddy Myers behind. Our wondrous friendship had to end and we had to go separate ways again.
---
But behold!
---
Daddy Myers didn't drop me on the hatch.
---
He put me on the hook right next to it, continuously hitting my dying body with his knife as if it merely was an emotionless lump.
---
But this lump was full of emotions. Heartbreak.
---
*My Heart Will Go On flute parody starts playing*
---
Tl;dr: Daddy Myers played with my feelings and I died. The end.
---
Is that the creator of Hex: Ruin? Or does OP think his face looks just like the icon?
---
it was on the game and i was going upstairs to a gen when he got saved, obvi i went back to see the ruckus.
---
I HAVE A MASSIVE TL;DR FROM A COUPLE MONTHS AGO WHEN EVERYONE WAS HYPE FOR DEDICATED SERVERS, TRYING TO BREAKDOWN THE COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS. IF YOU WANT TO READ IT, [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a3vj85/dbd_getting_dedicated_servers_in_2019_polygon/ebc94kc/). IF YOU DON'T, THAT'S FINE TOO. IT'S FUCKING LONG AND IT GETS KIND OF TECHNICAL AT PARTS.
---
THE GIST IS THAT HIT DETECTION IS ALWAYS DONE FROM THE ATTACKER'S PERSPECTIVE.
---
ALWAYS. THERE IS ACTUALLY A GOOD REASON FOR THIS - ANY OTHER APPROACH WOULD CAUSE DISPLACEMENT BETWEEN THE VISIBLE MODEL AND THE TRUE HITBOX, MEANING WHAT THE KILLER SEES ISN'T EVEN WHAT THEY NEED TO AIM AT, AND THAT FEELS SO AWFUL IN PRACTICE THAT IT WOULD TURN ANY GAME BUILT LIKE THAT INTO A GHOST TOWN.
---
BUT SINCE WE'RE DOING HIT DETECTION FROM THE ATTACKER'S PERSPECTIVE, THAT MEANS THEY'RE ACTUALLY ATTACKING A PAST YOU INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT ONE - AND IT'LL FEEL EVEN WEIRDER BECAUSE THE MESSAGE THAT YOU WERE HIT TAKES TIME TO TRAVEL TO YOU. SO THE KILLER WILL TELL YOU 100 MILLISECONDS FROM NOW THAT HE HIT YOU 100 MILLISECONDS AGO. IT FEELS EVEN JANKIER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS!
---
DEDICATED SERVERS AND LAG COMPENSATION MIGHT STOP THE JANK HITS FROM DROPPED PACKETS, BUT THE ONLY "REAL" WAY TO PREVENT JANK HITS ENTIRELY IS TO JUST NOT HAVE PING. WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE. RIP.
---
REAL TALK, I'M ACTUALLY SUPER SCARED THEY FUCK UP THE DEDICATED SERVER IMPLEMENTATION AND RUIN THE GAME. EVERY OTHER MAJOR UPDATE HAS BEEN A DISASTER, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER HERE IS LARGER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN.
---
I think it‚Äôs a bug buddy. I had the same issue playing as wraith on the school map. Specifically the hook just outside the school. The animation was just a left to right swaying and when the dude got out of my grasp I just used another hook after a quick down. ( enduring thank you) . 
---
Please don‚Äôt hurt me :c
---
You should always do that gen last...
---
No, it's Monto. He uses ruin a lot, and whenever he does he says " slow the game down, just a little bit." It's kind of a meme
---
You drop them immediately 
---
Jeff is one of my favorite survivors! So yes
---
Working on it, not going to happen overnight but I'll get there.
---
This is just something I've seen people complaining a lot about in comments, I'm seeing what other people have tried that works.
---
"These wounds they will not heal"

Too fucking perfect.
---
I don't have a build like this, but I took the time to learn how to kite myself. It's still 50/50 wether I go down instantly or am able to keep the killer distracted for 2-5 minutes. Yes, unfortunately I am one of those guys that loops around a pallet until I can't afford the range of a lunge, but I do enjoy being chased to an extent. It's challenging work and if there's one half-compitent  teammate working on gens while I do this, it's worth 2 gens typically.
---
By no means am I good. Just keeping my eyes on the prize of running through that open gate.
---
That‚Äôs a hard slap in the face to survivors. What rarity is it? 
---
Wait a minute.,,
---
If you only want Ruin and don‚Äôt care to play as her then I don‚Äôt see any reason as to why you wouldn‚Äôt buy it from the shrine
---
I actually enjoy playing hag tbh.
---
**OSHA WANTS YOUR LOCATION**
---
Save the best for last &gt; Brutal Strength.  You get fast as fuck boi with them tokens.  You're back on their ass before they know what to do.  Also Brutal is pretty mediocre these days.  Killers shouldn't stop to break every single pallet midchase.  Only the ones they can reuse on you midchase should be broken.  Down their ass then break pallets 
---
You mean NOED got the 3 man. That‚Äôs just like a survivor bragging about escaping by hatch because of DS honestly 
---
- Garbage killer if played as intended(bad at killing, but good at pipping)  
---
- Midtier to high midtier killer if you hit a survivor twice and exploit chase mechanics to force a down after 20 sec
---
That's mainly the reason why I decided not to ignore this and report her/him. He was what some people would call "Toxic survivor" not because of his perks, but because of his acting. Moonwalking, teabagging, and even at the end (which is how I got her) she was downed but could escape my grasp (I dropped her and she was close to escaping), and decided to wait in the exit gates just to make me lose time. It all seemed connected.
---
WHAT ABOUT THRILL OF THE HUNT? IT ISN‚ÄôT EVEN A DLC PERK
---
Welcome to Mount Ormond Resort. The bug has been happening more since the Legion‚Äôs release and mostly on this map. 
---
THAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME! TRAPPER WITH NOED, ONCE THEY LOST THAT, ABOUT 30 SECONDS LATER, THEY DC'ED! HAD A LANTERN SO WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING SOME EXTRA POINTS TO MY NEXT COIN!
---
Only if it‚Äôs normal stuff I think. Perks like ‚ÄúAlert‚Äù Na Kindred Tier 3 would still need to show the killer‚Äôs location. 
---
IF YOU PLAYED AS DOCTOR ON PS4 LAST NIGHT AND YOUR NAME IS RAVEN-SOMETHING. KINDLY GO FUCK YOURSELF. FACECAMPING EVERY SINGLE HOOK YOU GET IS A TRASH WAY TO PLAY AND NOT FUN AT ALL.
---
NOED got the 3k because of a cocky Claudette.
---
You could call it a crutch if the Claudette wasn't BMing.
---
I don't know why people feel like they should be entitled to BM and then cry about crutches when they get their ass handed to them. The killer can't down with NOED what's not there. Door's open? Get the fuck out instead of being cocky.
---
Typically SWF are more prone to tilting. Abuse as many mistakes as possible and watch them panic. Bait pick ups, and pressure altruism hard
---
Have you tried restarting your game? If not, do that. If the issue continues after a restart - contact support;

I would feel the opposite of safe since the Entity seems to sneak up on people when it takes them. You're now just suddenly in the Entity's realm.
---
Am meg main big bran, can confirm
---
He said that you are a cancer killer. What‚Äôs wrong with killing cancer? Sounds like a complement to me. 
---
Had this happen. Just reset the game and they came back. DBD verifies purchased content beforw launching, so maybe something went wrong there? 
---
His power puts you into the injured state and on a bleed out timer. So what they do is put you on the timer, lose the chase so it starts to deplete down, and you are forced to do something called ‚Äúmending‚Äù (it‚Äôs the same thing as self caring with borrowed time). When your bar depletes legion finds you and if you stop mending you go down so you get smacked and hooked. Fun btw.
---
I JUST TUNNEL THAT MOTHER FUCKER HARD. 
---
Did you lose teachables for ur other characters?
---
Survivors are weird. Level 2 of them quickly for perks and pick one you like the look of to play. Good perk survivors would be; Claudette, David king, or Meg to start with
---
I don't find the hag fun AT ALL imo. Just get her perk from the shrine.
---
I did, i wanted breakdown to make the ultimate sano build.
---
Killer main here, this angers me. 
---
Huntress would just throw a clearly  missed hatchet that  clips its way into your back after you throw down that pallet.
---
Hey shirtless Myers is good and all but shirtless Freddy thoüòç
---
A Meg got mori'd by Tombstone Myers a few days ago in my gameplay.  And after I risked my neck to save her from the hook too!  Instead of just sprinting out ASAP, she just had to put in one last teabag near the exit gate.  I guess she didn't expect Myers could just grabbed her and started the Mori animation without needing to down her first.  The last thing I saw of her was her being grabbed by Michael by the gate.
---
I got it once. It‚Äôs so good when that happens! But they broke the hex right after tho :(
---
I've got almost 1700 hours and just realized this.
---
Legion should be in the next Purge movie.
---
I FUCKING HATE SURVIVORS WITH DS AND KILLERS WITH NOED. IF IM PLAYING KILLER AND SEE YOU ARE MY OBSESSION EVEN THOUGH I DON‚ÄôT HAVE A OBSESSION PERK IF I FIND YOU YOU‚ÄôRE GETTING KILLED FIRST BUD. 
---
It's true
---
YOU LITERALLY LET MY TEAM DO 4 GENS WHILE YOU TUNNELLED AND 3 HOOKED ME. GG YA PLAYED YOURSELF FOOL. YOU SHOULDA PUSHED PEOPLE OFF GENS WHEN YOU HOOKED ME. THERE I FEEL MUCH BETTER NOW THAT IT'S IN CAPS. DUM DUM TRAPPER. 
---
Same, just one mori but I was so stoked to have it haha
---
Did you bring a salty lips offering to this post?
---
I think we did a pretty good job
---
Throw it right back at him. Find another pebble and throw that one at him also
---
*Angry Hag noises*
---
What a dick move. I had a Nea try to point out my position to the killer but he went for her instead hahahah
---
I'm down for this. The more shirtless beefcake the better.
---
4 PEOPLE LOOKING FOR 1 THING IS MUCH EASIER THAN 2 PERSON PROTECTING IT. EVEN IN THE BEST HIDING PLACE.

Y'all are weebs for having names like that üòÇ
---
This looks kind of strong no ?
---
Fucking dumbass
---
Hag. you'll get some good playtime out of her and she's decent enough to win in red ranks
---
Sorta toxic but gg
---
Will have a look!  Felt like I was in the game with 2 killers XD She was looking around for me to point me out to the killer.  I actually escaped from the hook, got downed straight away and there she was taunting.. Was pretty sadistic!
---
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY A GAME?
---
Very cool. Hoping that you'll share the entire cosplay with us when it is finished
---
It already did. I know because i bought it
---
It's happened to me. If they DC or severally lag during the animation you'll get stuck until they lag out
---
Ormond is a buggy af map. This has been an issue there its whole existence 
---
Then people see it‚Äôs a killer they don‚Äôt like (or map) and DC and keep their offerings and add ons. It should just do it during the load screen, and punish people for intentionally leaving like league does.
---
Nah man you decide to fuck around at the gate you deserve what you get.
---
They are the best perks but can be taken away in an instant. It's a gamble
---
Usually the first person vs legion dies and everyone else escapes. Legion is a tunnel master. Not op just bad game design.
---
Thanks for the reply. What does Frank's do?
---
That was a better throw then what I watched during the Super Bowl.
---
How do you know he was lag switching? Some people just got that Soulja router.
---
Are you agreeing with me or not? I can't really tell, but in your description, if you're so close to the killer that you can't make another loop by closing the gap with dead hard, you never should've thought you could make another. Dead harding into the killer is risky and doesn't always work, as you could get body blocked or they could just hold lunge and hit you at the end.
---
Based on what i see usually? Disconnect then go on their profile and wish them cancer and threaten to rape and kill their sister. Apparently.
---
When you pretend to give the last survivor the hatch but you mori them
---
Ok

This is an Ace post not a Dwight post XD silly billy.

---
No, it‚Äôs more like he sucks if you are the one the killer is tunneling. Legion is fine if it‚Äôs not a tunneling legion, it‚Äôs rare to find one that isn‚Äôt though lol.
---
This‚Äôll get ya laid for sure.
---
I know what you‚Äôre talking about , and it has increased recently due to a bug/exploit where you can disconnect from the match and gain points for your coins in the event , and you can keep doing it over and over for unlimited amount of times till you reach your 9 coins , won‚Äôt go into detail not to get my comment removed, but yeah after the event you should see this decrease alot.
---
Yea I bet so. I played on pc for 300 hrs when the game first released and now I play ps4 and have just as much fun. Sadly there is no bill tho
---
This is impossible, perhaps the archives are incomplete. 
---
Yep its just salt. I go to hoom someone then use a trap and they get down before im back of course im going to get you if I quickly see you
---
Black text on a black background, an excellent move!

It's a safety hazard to leaving pallets leaning against objects like that.

Unless you have Spirit Fury.

Only if *Bleed it out* starts playing after a Survivor gets hit.

put tape on monitor, done.

good feedback

or we can just stop making tier lists and play the game like a normal person

And I guess Fire Up‚Äôs the disabled cousin who rarely pops up, yet you dread every visit from him.

The grind starts bois.

Just my 2 cents

I used to feel that way but I've grown to love it.  I always go back and watch the vod to see my game from their perspective. Helps me be a better killer. 
---

---
Unfortunately they can't lighten anyone's skin tone without it being something that would spark controversy. They just need to brighten he cosmetics.
---
I don't think they should change her. Playing as/against almost all of the killers against good survivors is rote. It's a very on-rails and scripted experience, and if the survivors know the script and stick to the script, most of the killers in the game are just getting taken for a ride. Nurse is pretty much the only chance killers have against strong SWF players, and it's not guaranteed by any means.
---
I would recommend continuing to play nurse until you meet the survivors out there that can do 30-45+ second chases against her, which is all you need since the game allows survivors to do gens so fast.
---
well the way i see it it's either fix hatchets or this, and BHVR isn't gonna fix their game, they've proven that much already
---
OIIIIINNNKKKKKK

Yeeeeeeeah don‚Äôt know anything about that truetalent part.

Who cares ?

What was your most memorable moment in the game?

I've got Ruin already, is it worth me to go for Thanataphobia? As I would like to keep saving up my shards for a costume (a Spirit one, can't remember the name of it but costs like 20k shards)

I'm upset about no bill. I saw his trailer and wanted to main him but noooo

Petition for all survivors to have bell collars. Scratch that, petition for all survivors to be replaced with cats and for killer attacks to be replaced with gentle pets.
---
DO YOU SLUG THE LAST 2 PEOPLE AND LET ONE BLEED OUT THEN HOOK THE LAST SURVIVOR SO NO ONE GET HATCH? IF YOU DO I WONT CALL YOU NAMES BUT I MUST REGISTER MY IRRITATION. LEGION IS FINE. I DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT HIM SO MUCH. JUST MOVE ON TI THE NEXT GAME IF IT BOTHERS YOU SO MUCH. 
---
Some people say 'if they flashlight/use X perk, drop a pallet on me, ect. I won't spare them.'
---
But thats all fair to me as it's simply part of the game, but *God help you if you tea-bag ONCE, as*  *__I WILL RAIN DOWN THE MIGHT OF ZEUS.__*
---
I think you just need to fix your aim
---
Gotta get get

Which Chris is your favorite (Hemsworth, Pine, Evans, Pratt, Walken)?

Why did you post this?

Since when did people care about their rank? Its not like it matters in this game.
---
Upvote for the American Dad image you sent him. Highest quality response.
---
WGLF on: Found, hooked, and camped first. 
---
WGLF off: EZ max altruism and every unhook ever. 
---
There are very few insta kills. Mori requires a hook first.  All I can think of is tombstone Myers and Rancor.
---
my god why didn't i think of that
---
it's not like the entire game has broken hitboxes or anything
---
Wraith used to have cheese strategies to get way more blood points than the other killers. The game was also hugely survivor favored because of sabotage and numerous infinites. So if the Wraith got kited for the whole match and lost every hook on the map, you could still rank up with 20k+ points.
---
FUCK YOU SURVIVORS WHO I LEAVE AT HATCH THEN EXIT THROUGH GATE INSTEAD
---
IT MAKES SAD BECAUSE U MAKE ME FEEL LIKE BEING NICE IS BAD 
---
Hexes are all about gamble. It's a big risk big reward deal. If Ruin lasts for 2 minutes you're almost guaranteed a 3k+
---
I like to pick them up and put them further away so they bleed out right before they get it. 
---
this is beautiful
---
That's not possible, man
---
The killer moonwalking is to hide their red glow, essentially to mindgame. 
---
Survivors moonwalking is really just showing off and nothing else. 3
---
The Shape is more of a stealth killer, to most degrees. In Evil Within I, you only move at 105% speed, just 5% faster than a survivor can run. However, you don't have a terror radius, so you can catch people off guard quickly. EWII and EWIII both move you up to 115% speed like most other killers. If you plan to play him stealthily, don't bother with a chase build but more location based. But if you truly want to make a him a chaser, make sure you're always in EWII or EWIII. 
---
That's guys flair is the best part of this 
---
It takes a lot of coordination to do. Most people just do it to flex on everyone who can't but it can be used in some good jukes.
---
 Jake - male Moana ..... so....does he makes you moan?
---
Damn right he does 
---
It is absolutely a strategy. If you play survivor, you will notice that the killer has a red stain (light) coming from their front. This is so you can know where the killer is coming from etc. With moonwalking you can eliminate that factor.
---
An example is, when you are looping around a pallet, and you are just running forward towards the survivor. If you keep turning around, they will see the red stain and turn around as you do. If you moonwalk, it'll show that you are going one way, while moving towards the other direction. 
---
I hope this makes sense!
---
The funny part is that I didn't even tag it that.
---
That's pretty funny.
---
Love how no one gave a fuck about this. Also here. "?". 
---
I like this idea. Can someone put it in the game?
---
if you expect to play longer than 300 hours buy hag, otherwise ruin is fine.
---
Hax I call hax on dis man. Grab your firecrackers and get ready to notify the A team the aebony momento mori team
---
Time to start a petition? Lul
---
the fuck is Pandora?

what rank is that lol
---
It's the poor man's Spotify. 
---
There used to be a point in time when face camping was worse now you just have to either have borrowed time or get lucky, or leave them on the hook and do gens. After all that is the best way to counter face camping let 1 die and 3 escape
---
You're trying to sound dangerous, but you're only tempting us more.
---
Legion can jump from D tier to A tier with the right add ons.
---
actually you should avoid doing that gen under almost any circumstance other than the other 2 gens are getting camped across the map because it has no pallets or escape route.
---
Ah, not even available in Germany lol
---
thanks for the tip, I'll try there
---
I do...
---
Just remember that you're aiming at the middle of the screen. Also it's like clown's bottles, you just have to get used to how they arc and how you should adjust your aim to get a hit.
---
Crosshairs would just get in the way. I prefer huntress without crosshairs and I can hit most shots easily enough (apart from yolo shots or trying to hit a crouching survivor over an obstacle). Just play her more and you'll see that you don't need a crosshair. 
---
Why isn't Michael S tier?
---
aim higher, I know it sounds obvious but that's how I adapted to it
---
be good at nurse
---
I agree, I had just finished up a game where my bud and I were face camped so I was pretty miffed...
---
Iron Joke I mean Grasp
---
It adds literally 2 seconds or something like that trash
---
Your Internet is the asshole. 
---
Why? It doesnt mean anything sadly. 
---
Shit maybe I'll make a custom one on Spotify then.
---
commenting from the future, spirit isn't harder to play than nurse, I play a good spirit but nurse? hell naw, not with this console fps anyways
---
Touche
---
Besides on Legion some people swear by this perk. Legion is the only killer that can keep multiple people tagged consistently. On a basic killer it isn't worth the slot
---
Yeah definitely /s
---
Git Gud, huntress is fine you just need to play her more
---
Odd but happy you're in a country it's not available. I was about to be like shit I'm old, the kids aren't even using streaming apps I'm used to anymore.
---
Huntress in B tier??????
---
yup. in ingame reports on PC in griefing category "working with a killer" is listed as one of the examples
---
Im a hero! 
---
You can just tell by your connection at the start of the game 
---
There's an offering which allows survivors to start together  :) 
---
Rank is essentially a measure of skill. So it does matter to some degree. Imagine rank 1 killers who have all the best perks and addons, as well as strategies and optimal turning, etc, versing a rank 20 newbie. 
---
If rank didn't matter then that sort of matchup would be okay and they should be at around the same skill level. 
---
I fucking love this sub.
---
This may be the first time I've seen someone brag about NOED doing the work for them. 
---
Excuse me that is a safety hazard in the workplace
---
Oh and btw if someone wants to see ancestors voice actors (Wayne June) beautiful shitpost about amazon Alexa then enjoy : https://youtu.be/eYSPRwL9oX4
---
Not for me. 
---
as other people already suggested it's used on every killer to hide the red stain during the loops, but there are 2 other instances of moonwalking. first is legion who is trying to go after you while breaking the chase, so you bleed out and are forced to stop moving
---
and Myers during stalk.
---
just because it looks fucking hilarious from the survivor perspective
---
I‚Äôve never understood why self care is thought of as toxic. 
---
Could be an offering or just crazy luck.
---
Congrats you corrected someone on the internet! You win!

No worries, will do. üòé

Pandora was the first wife of Epimetheus in Greek myth, and her curiosity released all the evils that currently plague humanity upon the world. 
---
After doing that she didn't learn her lesson and again released an unknown entity upon the world: Hope, with whom humanity can have the strength to overcome all of life's hardships.
---
Her story acts as an allegory for humanity's curious nature and stubbornness, and how those traits often cause many problems, but also provide us the solution to our problems as invention and determination.
---
Pandora is also a music listening service company originally founded back in 2000 as Savage Beast Technologies.
---
Bro I died
---
No hate, I love megs, they got that booty.
---
I never understood how using perks is toxic....
---
Adrenaline is toxic? 
---
And here i thought being a swf all with ds and flashlights was being toxic
---
Guess ill just have to not use a clutch perk anymore, even though half the time the killer brings noed anyway &gt;_&gt;
---
I never hated Doc that much, Nurse can go fuck herself though
---
They KNEW i had NOED it spawned right beside the gate  then suddenly a claudette rushes me i down her put one on the hook went back and the other claud was healing her and boom dead
---
Why do people hate him so much?
---
The only dumb thing I've seen him do is put leather face above Hag and Doctor and some other killers that are better 
---
Excuse me for asking but why the hell do we care
---
P3 feng is scary change my mind
---
Their ping was likely bad and they desynced. My guess at least.
---
If they kill you, they're better
---
No I am not wrong. In any game the only way to get better is to grind and get better through playing more. Nobody is top tier at any game overnight. So your whole point as to why rank doesn't matter is completely void. 
---
Once again if rank does not matter then a rank 1 versing a rank 20 should be fair, especially since you believe that all you need to do is grind to get to a higher rank. You need skill to get to higher ranks, you can get there perkless and without addons, so that also disables the need for grinding while enhancing the need for skill. 
---
I enjoy using Adrenaline. I'm the complete opposite of a Toxic player though. It's a big reward for staying alive and finishing all gens. It's a waste of a slot through the game, but that's a risk I'm willing to take
---
Because people didn‚Äôt like his opinion 
---
Youd deserve it for knowingly anusing a bug
---
*Feng Min grunts*
---
Haha
---
Console Aim.
---
This reminds me of The Whitest Kids You Know ‚ÄúBaby skull seeking bullets‚Äù except it‚Äôs survivor skull seeking hatchets. 
---
It was only with one survivor. And he had great ping (Everyone Green, not even Yellow) 
---
Fucking christ people, just spend the 5.99 on LF and grind him out. BBQ will increase your QOL in this game dramatically and I can promise you that most of that money is going to the copyright holders anyway.
---
Most def gonna agree with ya.
---
Well she isn't OP but doesn't suck. Sounds about right
---
&gt; shitless david
---
Is that at&amp;t Operator Shalonda Dykes? 
---
This happened to me ages ago on Penn Asylum. Was getting chased and *right* before I got hit the second time, I teleported 50 feet away next to Claud on a genny.
---
What about dying light? 25% speed reduction seems pretty fucking great
---
I don't really see the harm in adding one. You can already tape a crosshair to your screen and if you're on PC you can use an overlay.
---
Lack of mobility, and if he can't tier 2 quickly, he has huge trouble building momentum
---
4 man swf squad goes against poor rank 15 and absolutely destroys the killer. "Rank doesn't matter"
---
He noticed last second too wow
---
Shhhh, you didn't see anything
---
It's funny that everyone makes memes about killer's hit boxes, because lately when I play killer I'll swing when I'm extremely close to a survivor and sometimes the hit still doesn't land.
---
Precisely this. Plus, controller sensitivity is balls, so 360 melee hachets are far more difficult.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, in a month and a half a new killer will come out and fall into the DBD outrage culture we‚Äôve all come to ‚Äúlove‚Äù
---
I think this last patch put Survivor hitboxes out of wack in general. 
---
Look at this doooood! Haha
---
No perks are truly toxic, but if there is one addon that is toxic without a doubt then it would be the combat straps.
---
Rules of the board say No Name Shaming! Admin please take this down 
---
I play both killer and survivor, so I never do any of that. Worst I'll do is be looking for the hatch if I'm the last survivor, but even then, sometimes I really can't be bothered, so I fast vault or something to alert the killer, or crawl towards them if I'm down (which actually resulted in the killer taking me to the hatch once, which was nice :3 and I'm pretty sure they weren't going to do it anyway, cos I wasn't the last survivor yet. Don't remember all the details, but it was the sort of situation where you're unlikely to be the one dropped at the hatch)
---
Thanks captain
---
If the only argument is basically "thank God not everybody can do this" i.e. Nurse, it's still a problem.
---
I‚Äôm okay on teabags it‚Äôs the excessive ones that get me, pallet drop? Bag. Get through a loop? Bag! 360? Flash? DS? It‚Äôs like Holysmokes I‚Äôm gonna camp you and depip. I‚Äôve been in games where I teabag like an asshole but I‚Äôm expecting assholery in return. The amount of salt from a bagging survivor after getting caught and camped is my favourite 
---
You're right, I shouldn't introduce violence into this chill, Christian game.
---
But he has add-ons that let him get tier 2 and tier 3 super quick 
---
E v e r y b o d y  n e e d s  t o  s q u a r e  u p.
---
True. But the fact he is also predictable, and has a hard time protecting totems, which limits his ability to prevent smart survivors from finishing gens. He's my most conflicted, but overall his inconsistency makes me think he should be D atm. I'm hoping he gets some tweaks in the right direction.
---
Just like how ZubatLEL counters nurse 
---
But those aren't their personalities, it's literally their functions. 
---
That‚Äôs a bit unfair. Pandora was created to be curious. It wasn‚Äôt entirely her fault that she opened it. The real sad person is Prometheus relative.
---
ALL OF THE SURVIVORS ARE GEN RUSH JOCKIES TONIGHT WHILE I'M TRYING TO HAVE A FUN GAME AS HUNTRESS ON THE BIGGEST AND WORST DAMN MAPS IN THE GAME. HOW DARE THEY RUIN MY FUN AND KEEPING ME FROM MY OBJECTIVE IN THE GAME WHEN THEY'RE COMPLETING THEIRS.  
---
but seriously though, stop. i want a game that lasts longer than 4 minutes please. thx &lt;3
---
At least it IS next to a generator, LOL. If it was one of the spawns in the middle of nowhere, dead out in the open, that is literally worst case scenario. Atleast with that one, there is a percent of games where you will be able to defend both the totem and generator depending on the order of generators that are completed and your map presence during the game.
---
Thank you. 
---
If i play a rank twenty with my skill, i can loop and 360 them the whole game, compared to an average of 30 seconds before i take a hit at rank 1 with no pallets
---
Rank matters, it just doesnt mean everyone is going to be the same skill level
---
And are you omnipotent? You have no idea what they're doing outside of those moments you see them crouching somewhere. I've had people sandbag me because they think I'm "just hiding", when I know the killer's nearby and I don't want to interact with them, after doing saves, heals, and gens all game. That kind of thinking is dumb.
