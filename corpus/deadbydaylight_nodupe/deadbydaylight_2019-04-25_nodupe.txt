It’s not entirely useless it’s just more about getting an easy first hit now
---
---
---
You have the best arguments. I bet you're the kind of person that thinks if they don't get a 4k every game it's unbalanced.
---
I’d love to hear your dumbass illogical self explain how exactly getting a prestige will increase your chance of getting the perk you want.
---
2 things 1 how are they buffing it and 2 you basically just explained how it is now minus the totems. You repair gens 15/20/25% faster for every gen left when you are the only one alive meaning with 5 gens left you do gens at 75/100/125% faster 4 gens 60/80/100% faster etc etc
---
It's PTB dude. I didn't care what I brought in, when I used it or whatever. I just wanted the entity to kill me at the end.
---
I like the lmao. Like what i said is ludicrous. Youll understand eventually
---
i don't get it, did that survivor forget that the main big things about the PTB are the Endgame Collapse and Legion changes? did he go in, expecting to NOT go up against a single Legion? and why did he DC anyway? Legion is fair now, you won't get cheesed to death with his power anymore.
---

---
as for why the Legion DCed, i have no idea lmao. best case scenario is that the killer didn't want to play a 3man game
---
Not really, if a killer were op then most people should be able to get easy 4ks. If they require skill, like nurse and billy, and people just get good with them then the survivors should find a way to combat their play style.
---
Everyone seems to be jumping into nerfing killers they don’t know how to play against because it leads to their death. For nurse run back at them after they’ve held a blink for a little bit. For billy run behind objects, move to the side, or just get lucky and he misses somehow.
---
Killers need more options for playstyles, not less.
---
Increased base movement speed. It’s a very big deal
---
Ok real talk I am cool with them getting rid of 3+ blink nurse, there's really no need for those, but people here are talking entire rework, honestly what bothers me atm.
---
You’ve got to let your friend know he has bad fashion sense
---
Oh then let me clarify-- What you said is ludicrous.
---
AHHHHHH
---
A massive speed boost. Now not only does he break the rules of the game and remove survivors ability to escape a killer, but also can catch right up and down someone right after his fury is gone. 
---
His ability to double hit a survivor during fury is removed. Oh no how bad (/s).
---
They'll now stay 2:55 just live dangerously and watch the Entity take over, even the ones who would normally have left immediately.
---
just taking a quick pish!
---
You can pip, if you somehow catch more than one survivor
---
Old sprint burst with old balanced landing plus all these new exhaustion perks can now have the 20 second cooldowns as well
---
Whoa wtf. No, none of that. Jesus Christ man relax. I just don't want to argue with you. Your response was very terse and it seemed like you have your mind made up.
---
I figured as much but I just wanted to be sure. I know this game has some stupid ass made up ethics but I've never gone too far into it so I didn't know if I was breaking some unspoken rule
---
i still debate launch legion was stronger than freddy, now its way easier to tell
---
I love Yamaoka's as survivor but I can't see shit there when I play killer. Same goes to corn maps. 
---
Aesthetically my favorite one has to be Mother's Dwelling. Rainy, foggy forest is my landscape of choice
---
Nah. They made a lower-tier killer unarguably weaker. It's not the end of the world, just a completely asinine nerf without corresponding buffs, and we're vocalizing it.
---
Pretty much. If you have mashed potato ping you're still going to lag no matter if it's p2p or  dedicated servers. If you get frame lag it's still gonna happen.
---
Spam ambush while playing pig and make a song from the growls or whatever it is
---
Lol what a fun strawman.
---
I cannot believe that they nerfed DS. It really did take a lot to master... and because of that it wAs aBsOluTeLy fInE

I take no credit for making these icons! If you want to message the creators:

Had this happen last night. Just wait until you get hooked oh boy do those auras get attracted to you
---
Also she isn’t getting nerfed because it’d probably kill the whole concept of the character and leave her too weak. I think she’s past that point, the only viable solution might be a rework.
---
after so many hours. So many teabags, so many body blocks, so many flashlights.
---
it’s time to get back at those plucky little shits
---
don’t know why this is getting downvoted. if it’s a 3 player game it’s fine if you leave. waste of fuckin’ time unless it’s 4 players.
---
don’t disconnect for any other reason tho. if you’re on a time crunch, just don’t queue. don’t ruin other people’s games.
---
Wish it was a full miners suit this cosmetic kinda sucks imo the only thing cool is the mask
---
Ah, so no argument again. Great discussion going on here, really made me change my mind!
---
Wtf happened to him?
---
I enjoy the maps like Haddonfield and Elm Street just because of the houses. Even though the houses are built for ants, I enjoy the idea of running from a killer around a house like in classic slasher films.
---
I THINK IM FINALLY OVER THIS TRASH GAME. EVERY GAME IS FULL OF DCS, CAMPING, LAG, LAGSWITCHING, BUGS, CAMPING, CAMPING  AND CAMPING. EVERYTIME A PLAYER DCS A GEN SHOULD AUTO POP. YOUD THINK THE KILLERS WOULD GIVE YOU A BREAK IF YOURE SHORT SURVS BUT THEY JUST GET EVEN MORE TOXIC. ITS LOST ITS NOVELTY. IT WILL DIE. AND IT HAD SUCH POTENTIAL. ID RATHER BULLSHIT AROUND FRIDAY THE 13TH AND RP THEN TRY TO ADAPT TO THIS BROKEN DISASTER. AND THE COSMETICS ARE TOO MUCH AND HONESTLY SUCK. YOUD THINK WE COULD ATLEAST HAVE THAT.
---
Im a console pleb so i know nothing about icon packs except that they exist...do the devs like em or dont like em? Because i would honestly love to get one officially on my console
---
Rank 12
---
Holy shit dude, RELAX.
---
Nice. Reply to me please, so i can find this later on my computer
---
Survivor update: all medkits contain some tums. No longer vomit or enter broken state.
---
Lol
---
DID YOU JUST CALL ME SOFT?!?! You can’t say that man, I’m fragile
---
New cosmetics
---
Even without perks and toolboxs gens can be done stupid fast. Also, all gens being done isn't survivor victory. To me, it's when the game gets interesting. (on survivor side, and you have to hook save)
---
Ugh, i would love to use these but with the amount of time and money I've sunk into this game I would be too nervous of being banned.
---
C? She wasnt C. Shes decent. Solid B
---
THIS BULLSHIT HAPPENED TO ME TWICE. POP OUT STUN AND GRABBED.
---
I think shit like this is inevitable in an asymmetric multi-player game. Regular games are hard enough to balance, but assymetirc ones are almost impossible to get right. Evolve went through the same shit. Unnecessary balance updates one after the other until all the people that gave a shit stopped playing.
---
Omg that killer would be really cool in DBD
---
&gt; normal amount of skill and give normal results,
---
Yeah but playing against an optimal af swf group fucks up that balance. Nurse isn't a killer to deal with the new players, she's a killer to deal with the experienced ones. She requires more skill for better results to help us against the 4 man swf that can play extremely optimally. By all means get rid of her addons that add extra blinks, that I agree has little to no counterplay and ins't needed, but she doesn't need a whole new rework.
---
I agree with the other poster. Can you link to several videos of M1 killers at Rank 1 who get 4Ks without using their power?
---
I have a really hard time believing your statement. Else you would see many Trappers at high ranks.
---
aah too bad. They don't ban you for it, but the EAC system can ban you. They say: use it with caution
---
I'm really worried about dedicated servers. Ping won't change, killers will now be affected by lag (if it's the same as it is in kyf if the killer isn't the host then it's gonna be dreadful) and I can just imagine all of the bugs that will be happening.
---
We get tons of bugs when they update the engine, imagine what will come when they rework their entire network, lol.
---
To be fair, I downvoted you for the strawmanning, the idea that killer players are frustrated that BHVR didn't make it easier to 4K instead of them actually responding the nerfs. I don't feel you're posting in good faith, and so I don't believe your posts are contributing to discussions here. IMO people are using the downvote system correctly ITT.
---
I never understand these arguments that devs favour one side or the other. Literally makes no difference to them, they'd obviously want the game to be balanced  so more people buy and play the game.
---
They literally believe that NOED punishes you for "doing the objective", the only way a person could believe this is if they think that repairing generators instead of escaping alive is the true objective, and that they're entitled to an escape for powering five of them.
---
As if this entire subreddit is biased in their own favor...
---
Lol, you're both right. The movie franchise Amanda, however, saw it as more of a mercy-killing when compared to Kramer's methods, and often rigged some of the traps so it'd kill the people instead of giving them a choice (Whether or not that was right is up to you). She does have a mean streak, which makes sense that it'd be carried over to DBD.
---
This is why the nurse won’t get a nerf/rework anytime soon, because it’s the only “counterplay” for SWF. The problem is that the whole concept of SWF shouldn’t exist since you can’t restrict the communication between the players. But one problem doesn’t remove the other problem. Nurse is still a character that breaks the basic mechanics of the game, and you can’t have a killer that’s supposed to deal with 1 type of player (extremely optimal survivors) while destroying the other one (new survivors). Both things should be changed imo.
---
I bing my bell constantly when chasing survivors 2
---
As a Clown main I can tell you he's not perfect.
---
🤡🌎
---
Should I go find that comment? I feel like we're at the point of witch hunting, but eh, that's life.
---
Clown is a killer that can end chases quick and has no map pressure, [and he can still get fucking destroyed when doing well.](https://youtu.be/L5EWhjPyR1o)
---
yeah, I can't remember the specific friend, but I just remember the immensive disappointment upon seeing it.
---
I aim to please.
---
It's 100 times better than having the last guy hiding around and you having to look for them for 10 minutes.
---
You can close the hatch, force them to try to go for the door and die if they don't. That's the point of the change, to force people to do something at the end of the game, instead of hiding around.
---
Amanda was one of the most recurring (IE she's more iconic) one of Kramer's 'henchmen' who wore the pig mask. I believe the second-most person was that doctor guy who survived his trial with one leg, as he decided to join Jigsaw.
---
Fun fact: something can be overpowered but you can still be shit.
---
On a more serious note I don't think Billy or Nurse are "instawin" overpowered but they're way above the overall power curve.
---
You do realise the perks you mentioned are hex perks which can easily be destroyed and will just be a wasted perk slot for the rest of the game.
---
All the killers??
---
He does have the canister in game. I checked.
---
&gt; It's not that you are a bad killer overall if you lose a game, but you have made a lot of bad plays/mistakes in that particular match if you let all of the gens get powered with 4/3 survivors still alive
---
Or, that you ran an end-game build with perks that activate only after five generators are powered; Blood Warden/Remember Me/Rancor/etc. The amount of generators powered is not a referendum on how well or poorly a killer played in a match.
---
KEEL ZEM ALLLLLL
---
True, before counterplay against legion was mind game him. I started running quick and quiet just because he couldn't see scratch marks, which made locker jukes on him easy af.
---
All the time, but then again, I have an anxiety disorder. A couple deep breaths and I'm ready to tax that ass.
---
He got fucking neutered
---
Because you are removing a killer’s power directly (and possibly in full) when it is being used as intended and there is no counterplay. Hangman’s noose is not valid counter play. It only cuts time down to 2 minutes, which is a long time. 
---
It would be easy to exploit with SWF to quickly remove all traps from the map. There are only a limited amount and it is supposed to take time to sabotage them, not be instant. It would basically be a huge sabotage buff that cuts out the disarm, then sabotage requirement.
---
Nice. A medkit, a toolbox and...
---
That's not tequila...
---
Did he take you out for dinner after? To a nice... BBQ? *\*Badpun tss\**
---
Nurse just isn't well designed but it's very hard to nerf her without killing her on console and making a whole one out of five starting killers for new players so so difficult with very less reward.
---
This honestly. After the first hit is made Legion is like a worse Wraith. The cooldown from Feral Frenzy is probably longer than uncloak and without a speed boost immediately after.
---
\*More DCs than Legion\*
---
I lol'ed.
---
I never said it wasn't a problem, I said it wasn't a huge problem.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's bannable as is to hold a game hostage so EZ reports, bonus points with video proof you can send in to the devs.
---
How was it 18nminutes and only 1 gen got done seems odd to me
---
They would fix that actually.
---
Kinky.
---
So that’s what he uses when he has DS, railroad spikes.
---
For real. Anyone who DC's over such a petty reason needs to uninstall and leave their bitch ass at home.
---
&gt; I had two games in the PTB against a Hillbilly where I shouldn't have escaped, but due to the timer changes I was able to run out before he chainsawed me. 
---
We-were you refering to the gates taking less to open or was the madlad actually using remember me on Billy?
---
See that I can definitely agree to, get rid of swf and nerf top tier killers to compensate. Alas doubtful they would do both so that's the main reason I fear bhvr nerfing nurse without compensating for the top tier swf groups with something as well  :/
---
what would i need to change if you are correct

---
&gt;Where exactly do I say that you need to camp and tunnel in this message? I don't understand why do you feel the need to mention those two here.
---
Because when you make comments like this:
---
&gt;but you have made a lot of bad plays/mistakes in that particular match if you let all of the gens get powered with 4/3 survivors still alive
---
It goes to show you don't play killer at all and you have _no clue_ what it's like from a killer's perspective. Every post I've seen from you just reinforces your super survivor main bias.
---
I don't really care if you find camping and/or tunnel boring. I'm not here for your entertainment.
---
Long window with 2 pallets used to be the norm on certain maps.
---
Anyone remember when you couldn't even count the pallets on auto haven?
---
90% of people didn't even loop then because it didn't matter if you learned to or not.
---
Everyone played trapper and trapped right under hooked survivors though, so it wasn't all good for survivors. The game has evolved a lot, though. If we went back in time with the same skillset, rank 15 survivors would go untouched against rank 1 non nurse killers.
---
It's 6000km from Brisbane Sydney and melbourne to Singapore, 4000 for Perth, 8500km for Auckland, Wellington and
---
Who gives a fuck what you think? You've obviously got a bone for this guy.
---
He should be deleted. Or reworked.
---
Either way, I still don't call this a nerf. His increased speed makes up for any other nerfs.
---
this isn’t zubat speaking in the picture tho, but yeah, he is really good
---
Trust me, it won't. There can still be lag with servers. Servers can also f up randomly and go down, so there's a problem with servers. If you have potato internet you're still going to have potato ping.
---
Okie silly okie yo... I'm an idiot
---
Is that zubat
---
EXACTLY! TY, FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS FUCKING IDIOTS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS!
---
Yes those BM actions of both killers and survivors are rare but they are extremely toxic and you can't do anything about them. Killers have a lot of options but in the end game its mainly whispers that helps them lock down on survivors but if they don't have that then its difficult to find the leftovers.
---
yay another killer that's a massive joke to this toxic community
---
please keep killing your game developers.
---
What a shit bag comment.. You must be autistic? Seriously..?
---
Not really, they already weren’t that good of a killer but now they’re basically useless
---
Nice!
---
Reasonable prices too!
---
This subreddit is Killer biased, so I doubt suggesting they aren't the victims will go over well here.
---
Most Myers that I've seen run: ruin, enduring, spirit fury, and bbq and chili. Survivors have a lot more map knowledge, so you just have to learn how to counter the loops they use using mind games (red stain, moonwalking, etc.). Also, never respect the pallet, just swing through it. And don't focus one dude the whole game.
---
I typically give hatch to the last survivor if the game was fun. I don’t typically farm though. However, If someone DCs I only 2 hook people. Then I’ll start memeing with them.
---
Since BHVR has already shown they have no problem with needlessly rewarding survivors for bad play and punishing killers for good play, I'd say this is a "logical" change to the perk.
---
I get the appeal late game builds have for some people, but imo they aren't worth it.
---
You can play like shit all game and then try to cheese a kill or two at the end. To me that's just boring and kind of lazy, so I'm not a supporter of them.
---
You're talking extreme outliers though. What the subreddit is talking about with the lag is when the killer is lagging and everyone else suffers or when I play survivor late at night and no killers in my area are playing so the ping is always high. We are no longer at the mercy of the killer to have decent internet to have a decent time.
---
With or without bad internet, if you are connecting to the new servers within your region you will have a significantly better connection more reliably all hours of the day.
---
Hell yeah.
---
That's why we gotta hope the  servers are good. There won't be memes about players want p2p if the servers aren't trash
---
Logically, I guess. From a balance perspective that would be kind of dumb though.
---
Lol then why comment about it? Sorry, I guess.
---
Same. Some of the best times I had gaming. Met most of my gaming group playing evolve too. Now I'm sad 😔
---
And trump collided with Russia
---
2nd guy is on the right lines. But most of the complaining is about the Pig. Shes now basically useless and only viable attack in the chase is her dash to start off with an easy hit, if you even hit that.
---
As a killer main, I wish it was only 70%.
---
Gonna spend the next two hours playing, I'll return with data, including killer, amount of dc's, and time (based on objectives done).
---
Me too.
---
I recently bought 3 new in box PC copies. Key works on steam. Then you just choose legacy from the beta options and you can play peer to peer!
---
These are amazing! Great job. Have you been banned at all for using them? I want to do the same myself, but I’m scared about EAC detecting it.
---
Bubba's fucking leather creaking and squeaking when he picks a survivor up makes me so uncomfortable
---
That's me after putting my last trap on a survivor who is dead on hook.
---
Your preference for end-game builds isn't really what anyone is talking about, we're discussing whether generator counts are a good measure of a killer's performance.
---
&gt; Er, I said mistakes.
---
Which again, shows that you literally never play killer, ever. If you think killers need to make mistakes for gens to get done without kills, you should _actually play the other half of the game_.
---
&gt;I've clearly said in the past that I think tunneling and camping is not a good strategy to win. 
---
Except it is and you would know this if you _actually played the side that you're making up strategies for_. Tunneling is one of the most efficient ways to get a survivor out of the game. Camping a survivor hooked next to your Ruin is practically a guaranteed 3k.
---
Everyone is a nazi these days. He's in fact an excellent comedian on youtube, he's why flex-tape is a meme.
---
Rule of thumb for the internet: if someone gets called a nazi, it's because someone else just wanted a reason for people to hate them.
---
M2 for 60 second NOED that you can pop point blank
---
That’s awesome lol. Nice job :D
---
Hmm alright.  Doesn't sound too terribly different from when I left then lol.
---
I was never a great Myers, except when he first came out and was kinda OP with certain runes.  I mostly mained Hillbilly and got to about rank 4 before I stopped playing.  But I see they've added a ton more killers and survivors and quite a few perks I'm completely unfamiliar with.
---
I am a killer main and I agree with what you are saying. It is not killer mains making that statement, it is people who can’t differentiate skill caps (difficulty) from balance. 
---
There is not really a counter to her, just a small delay. All you can try to do is go immersed, but you need to do gens to escape and she can jump right to you. 
---
She can take down an entire team in a minute. She is absolutely godly with distressing and “Shit Your Pants”
---
I would rather play against pre-PTB Legion than Nurse, because at least I would have a chance to escape with the time it takes Legion to down someone. 
---
If you take away all perks and adding from her, a good SWF has a chance, but that is about it.
---
Except for the spirit glass sounds
---
Lol, I'm sure this is totally backed up by wide sample reliable data over a long period of time. 
---
What's that you say? These numbers came out of your butt? 
---
That explains a lot.
---
CAKE DAY
---
THIS GAME SUCKS NOW. PERIOD.
---
I didn't say they've fixed all of the bugs, but they have fixed some.
---
Billy's scout pants are still bugged and glitch around when he walks for example.
---
I _promise_ you're nowhere near a decent rank 1 killer. If you're not full of shit, stream killer so everyone can see. Because I am willing to bet $100 that you don't consistently 4k at rank 1.
---
Hell, I'm pretty sure you've _never even made it to rank 1_.
---
3 minutes is more than enough time to troll The Killer.
---
HAVE FUN PLAYING WITH PLAYERS PLAYING WITH THEIR DICKS
---
If you tbag you’ve sealed your fate
---
But I am asking you to explain why.
---
In a hatch standoff today - the killer stands on it so the survivor can't jump through.  They can sneak off and do a gen - so what? especially if they're dumb enough to do the one closest to the killer and have to back off far enough for the killer to resume killing - otherwise - it's a standoff.  It stays a standoff. Closing the hatch is supposed to end this - but this mechanic 100% will not do that. 
---
Again, factoring in the "they can do a gen" scenario - you wait until you know where they are. You close the hatch. You don't give them enough time to power a gate (although I saw they're reducing the timer? guess remember me is about to become a more popular option)
---
You say you're not weighing in on if this is a fix - but you're arguing with me over my position that it isn't accurate for me to say no - it isn't a fix.  So yes - you are taking a stand while at the same time trying to claim you arent.
---
That actually looks pretty unnerving.
---
It fixes both of those, and it fixes the issues I mentioned.
---
Leatherface is a dollar store Billy*
---
What happened to the pig?
---
FIX THE DC's, PUNISH THE SAWFT BOY CUNTS, FUCKN BITCHES. YEAH YOU! GAMERVILLAIN KNOWS YOU'RE A CUNT!
---
End Game Pig is literally just NOED with maybe Blood Warden/Remember Me and whatever else.  
---
Relying on NOED as a crutch doesn't increase diversity or offer a different playstyle, it just covers up bad performance or a lack of understanding how to effectively play a Killer before the end-game state.  Endgame Pig with EGC would effectively become a massive cheese build that forces people to stick around longer, stalling things out to try and guarantee some easy/free kills.  
---
The EGC was designed to stop those shenanigans where you have to rely on the Hatch or have the game stalled out.  Endgame Pig has never been a 'fun' build to play against and nerfing it is justified.  Otherwise Endgame Pig would practically be the only Pig build we'd be seeing with the EGC patch release since it would be such an easy way to secure kills.   
---
Let the downvoting commence.
---
Did you draw that? Because that artwork is AMAZING!
---
That's pretty cool. I played it on ps4. iirc since console never got the new version that they discontinued I think you can still play peer to peer on the original version you just can't play the ranked mode and none of the leader board or the shop work. Been trying to get my friends to re-download/buy it so we can do custom lobbies and mess around.
---
i shall protect you from the others who want to save your life with my chainsaw
---
It really is. The endgame traps don’t bug me as much as the terror radius one does.
---
i understood this before i said anything lol this community is so divided/toxic i knew what was commin
---
Thermonuclear take: And apparently the devs are blaming all those DCs on killers.
---
You mean my item and offering are fucked
---
Laggy? Lag has to do with connection. FPS on console is supposedly better, but idk about that. Still seems pretty meh to me.
---
The only issue I have with Myers is that he can save his tier 3 until he's right behind you, pop it, and then down you with absolutely zero counter. That needs fixing.
---
Story: i spawned next to her Ruin and after i cleansed it, she started chasing me for 4 gens. the funny part is when HG got cleansed, she still was after me and couldn't get me. then (she had the add-on when a gen is repaired, she has the corrupt pool) idk what was she thinking but i used DH and stunned her with the pallet (making her lose her corrupt purge). whatever, i got down after the 4th gen and she was hard patrolling the area where i was hooked. after i got unhooked and hit with NOED, i used DS and then her hex got destroyed right in that moment and DCs instantly.
---
I want to meet his cousin Fappy Boi
---
I HATE THAT DAMN WIGGLE BAR THAT STAYS ON MY SCREEN FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME TILL THE END ALL THESE UPDATES AND THATS STILL AN ISSUE WHEN IS THAT ISSUE GOING TO BE FIXED!!!???
---
it doesn't fix hitbox issues. If a survivor is laggy they'll still be BS hits and misses. Stuff like that happens in video games with Dedicated servers (not  including LOL and other mobas), so it doesn't fix every hitbox problem
---
Memes don’t normally make me laugh, but this did. I can just imagine the literal “wtf” expressions on the people’s faces.
---
I have the same reaction, my guess is that it isn't uncommon to die as survivor, sure you get angry when you gets tunneled/camped/screwed over by a teammate, but dying as survivors happens a lot. However, with killer you feel like you HAVE TO get kills, and if all 4 escape you get frustated, because you have that feeling that the killer should get 3-4 kills everygame.
---
Scratched mirror Myers loves it.
---
That killer was an idiot. If you don't tbagg or spam the flashlight, you are not toxic as a survivor. At least for me. Meta perks? Gameplay. Looping? Gameplay. You spawn next to Ruin? What? You should let the totem there like say "I must respect the killer's perk"?
---
Legion is literally still really strong and may even be better than before. People wanted to say he was dead way too quickly. Legion is fine.
---
The downvoting is only going to commence because you're automatically assuming End Game Pig is NoED, when most Pigs didn't run NoED since it caused people to leave and not try to save someone.
---
My End Game Build with Pig was Fire Up, Bamboozle, BBQ, and whatever else I felt like running that time. Eat as many pallets as you could in chases (either on the head or just getting them dropped) and then Fire Up and Bamboozle were there to counter the windows.

You're still under the impression that suddenly every Survivor has a Hat on when EGC happens. They won't. One or two will at most. You're also assuming EGC automatically means the Hatch is gone. It won't; the Hatch is still open if the killer doesn't find it before the survivors do, and even if it's closed it can still be opened with a Key.
---
You're not going to be downvoted because you have "logical" points. You're going to be downvoted because your entire argument relies on NOED and the hatch being closed. What you're saying with End Game Pig being the only build we'll see is like saying Tombstone Myers is the only Shape we'll see because why worry about anything else if you can just kill them....
---
That's assuming it's entirely the hitbox issues. Plenty of huntress axes are visually landing on targets but the game says they aren't. This can be fixed with dedicated servers.
---
The ability he gains from stalking the survivors? One of the more balanced one hit downs in the game?
---
&gt;I promise you're nowhere near a decent rank 1 killer. If you're not full of shit, stream killer so everyone can see. Because I am willing to bet $100 that you don't consistently 4k at rank 1.
---
&gt;Hell, I'm pretty sure you've never even made it to rank 1.
---
It's ridiculous that you think rank 1 matter anything in this game, the ranking system is so awful at measuring skill that rank is literally meaningless. You don't need to be good at the game to get to it, you can literally grind games to get there.
---
My laptop is weak enough that it has trouble running dbd without garbage fps, I doubt it could handle OBS + DBD. I guess I won't be getting that 100$ that I'm sure you'd give me, unlucky.
---
&gt;I think if you get to 5 gens with no kills or even people on death hook, you've played the match like shit
---
&gt;Which again, if you would have played killer, ever, you'd know this isn't even true.
---
I mean, you can think that you never make a mistake and you get to that situation anyway, but you really don't. You must know what a correct decision is to know that you've made a mistake.
---
If you don't make mistakes on killer while also not getting awful map rng you'll never be in that situation.
---
Hope he doesn’t DC.
---
Yep, customs still work in legacy. Everything is unlocked. All characters and skins. The only progression is character progress
---
They better not buff nurse
---
It's not a legit strategy for sure, but it is fun to play in alternative ways sometimes. Sure it can be annoying, just like 4man swf with map and a key jumping into the hatch   5 minutes after the game started
---
For me playing basement leatherface is like making a stupid deck in a card game. Sure, the combo does not work most of the times, but when it goes off 1 in 20 games it's still fun and satisfying. 
---
It also is one of the very rare moments when I can actually feel like a bad person playing as a murderous lunatic in a game about serial killers
---
and I know. downvote away because it's unfun, but I've actually been on the receiving end of the Bubba's basement party as the guest of honor on the first hook and I don't mind. I'm more annoyed at people who try to save me, not at killer playing around with goofy tactic that doesn't work if you don't let him get it to work. I mean, its an asymmetric survival horror game and you sometimes die because you have less power than the side that has only 1 person, shit happens.
---
I do mind being camped and tunneled by normal killers, but if someone is on high rank its damn obvious he didn't get there by playing insidious leatherface and the guy is just having some fun trying to pull off multikills with a chainsaw
---
Cry dude it’s the internet get over it
---
I literally never tbag at killers and I still get camped from time to time
---
Well, can't say I'm shocked that a landslide victory and objectively losing are equally rewarded by BHVR, but it obviously shouldn't be the case.
---
Ayup
---
It’s funny because Legion is super ez to go against now and he only catches you if you are back or your dumb Rank 21 teammate uses all the pallets cause they think they can loop.
---
JOJO MEMES 🎉
---
If that ho hadn’t said yes, I’d have fuckin gone with yas. In an instant. I fucking hate prom but I would have shut the hell up and just gone.
---
Bard
---
Or someone on your team who decides to trash talk you because they failed to escape yet you did, then finding them in a lobby the following match, terribly awkward, it only blocked them from contacting you. I miss back when Xbox had the “avoid this player” option
---
I dunno. That trenchcoat is pretty thick, she might be a D.
---
Its laggy cause the framerate is so bad. Its like a slideshow. Im assuming the game runs at like 20 frames per second on consoles. 
---
After playing at 100+ frames... it literally makes me feel dizzy playing on the console again
---
I know I will get hate for it, but I prefer new legion over the old one, I mean new legion isnt meta and probably around doc or clown tier but it was pretty jarring to tunnel survivors for about 2 minutes with your power on old legion.
---
Pig nerf was a bit dumb, but I dont mind it as much as others seem to, never used it as endgame pressure but did well with her since I am good with 115% killers. Still tho, the nerf was unnecessary thinking about it :P
---
It's so true it hurts.
---
Have 3 graphs as 15 was too many killers.  Top skill level was taken from like 10-20 rank 1 opinions (not me).  Tried to average out the consensus.  I'd say I'm better than intermediate not super chart topping though.
---
Early skill level I compiled more from theory and comments.
---
Intermediate from experience.
---
You're an asshole. :)
---
That argument its so stupid. At best
---
It's fine playing other killers in PTB. Something may get fucked because spaghetti code and playing other killers help to know if something is glitched.
---
WHY ISNT THERE AN OCEANIA SERVER?! US AUSSIES AND KIWIS ARE GONNA BE FUCKED!
---
Yea probably me too, dead hard can fuck your power lmao
---
How many hours do you have?
---
What exactly did No0b3 do?
---
Lmao your tag
---
&gt; It's ridiculous that you think rank 1 means anything in this game
---
It's ridiculous that you think it doesn't _when you've never been a rank 1 killer_. 
---
Just admit you don't know what you're talking about, because it's obvious to _anyone_ who has a decent amount of kills that you're absolutely clueless. 
---
Just stick to survivor and stop running your mouth. It honestly only empowers other terrible survivor mains who think the game should further cater to them.
---
Also very cute ;)
---
I feel like if someone got shit on all game and then gets a lucky roll with Noed and BW then I don't think they did that well in the match.
---
OH BOY DO I LOVE SOME THICKER FOG WHEN I'M PLAYING KILLER SO THAT SURVIVORS ARE HARDER TO SPOT. REVERSE IS TRUE WHEN I'M PLAYING SURVIVOR. **GIVE ME THAT CLEAR REAGENT**
---
Don’t backseat drive other peoples playing styles
---
Ok I get that but lag has nothing to do with framerate. Lag refers to poor internet connection, something completely unrelated.
---
yup, the only correct way to play basement bubba is to run monstrous shrine / iron grasp / agitation / insidious and 0 addons
---
if you're going with a meme strategy, you gotta commit
---
He got nerfed because rank 20 survivors didnt know how to counter him, so the devs nerfed him, he was weak on release and now its shit
---
Yes, running in circles around a pallet is SkILL. Best player ever. And also, a decent killer never chases a survivor for so long, knows when to stop and look for another one. But yes, thanks for toxic survivors, DBD is dying
---
Idk why people care what others think about how they play. Have fun. Don't cheat. You're good
---
MORE LIKE SINCE THE GAME WAS RELEASED.
---
I've been really itching to play it lately. It's just a lot more fun with a full group (monster included). Although at some point I need to elite wraith and kraken to get my platinum trophy.
---
Oh my God I thought he said 4 gens left.. sorry dude then that's messed up... you should've double pipped..
---
I have such a deep appreciation for this
---
entitled killer is entitled
---
Honestly, I could care less about Legion, I just feel bad for Pig
---
usually about a week or two after the ptb went live
---
Nah. I always get messages accusing me of tunneling from injured survivors that stand still in the middle of the map. Or survivors that run towards me and stand in front of me after getting unhooked. (Even when I’m chasing someone else).
---
You had a semi decent point until you decided to act like a child, then you’re entire argument become null and void in my eyes.
---
Ive got that on my Xbox like 3 times. It makes it almost impossible to play
---
It’s created buy a survivor with a map by using an offering who’s name I cannot remember, only survivors can see it
---
Are you fat shaming jeff??
---
Nothing good, nothing good at all.
---
Yes, and I've also seen this question asked 1000 times on this sub.
---
It's a map addon that shows all survivors the marker.
---
I mean you can go and check with multiple members of the community that rank 1 is meaningless. 
---
Check with Scottjund, ZubatLeL, Ryanpez etc. if they think rank 1 on either side means anything in terms of skill.
---
I just think it's funny that you assume that since I don't think camping and tunneling are great strategies that I must be a survivor main. Like god borbid I have a different opinion about it based on my own experiences.
---
Though in order to do that he has to single you out away from vaults and pallets which isn’t exactly something that happens all that frequently.
---
Read the patch notes?
---
Ok this post only comes for tank 20 survivors, that always are on the corners of the map and throw every pallet like animals, also they dont know ehat looping means, and they dont look behing while in chase
---
Have you met a teacher? They've been dying for the chance to beat the fuck out of some teenage little shitbag
---
r/expectedjojo
---
WHEN YOU ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISH THE OPPONENT(S) YOU ARE PUNISHED BY THE GAME IN CHASER/EVADER CATEGORY. THREW GAME ACTIVELY ENCOURAGES YOU TO BE A DICKHEAD AND FRUSTRATE THE ALREADY SEVERELY LOSING AND FRUSTRATED PARTY BY TOUTING WITH THEM SO YOU CAN RANK UP. DUCKING HATE BOTH CHASER AND EVADER
---
That's the console experience. You play killer for an hour or two and it feels like your eyeballs are going to pop out.
---
"I literally gain nothing from having the ability to vault pallets "
---
God, do you even read what you type?
---
lower ranks it favors killer but higher ranks its survivor sided most chases i get into take me around 40 - 60 seconds to end (depends on survivor &amp; map) if i remember correctly takes 60 seconds to do a gen and good players can usually finish 2 gens by the time i get the first hook i then have to traverse the map for 20-30 seconds to find someone to start this all over again all this time adds up for survivors to complete gens pretty effectively as a killer your constantly trying to manage your time on top of that second chance perks like dead hard and MoM make a huge impact in a chase stalling it for even longer adding to that i see many players duo swf and 4 man lobby's and if your in coms its even worse for the killer if you havent tried out killer yet give it a shot and go for red ranks
---
You can learn nurse in an evening and hillbilly is so basic it should take you a couple games to get him down.
---
to be honest even if you take away the entity's support and choose Susie as the legion representative, I would still bet on her in almost all of these 1v1, except vs Ash Williams, because well, he is Ash Williams and MAYBE Tapp/Bill depending if they were properly trained during their careers 
---
if you don't have combat training on disarming people then the person with a knife in hand usually wins. 
---
but if you take Joey as the representative then I don't think anyone would win vs him.  It can be surprisingly hard to disarm a sadistic lunatic who practiced being physically abusive basically since his childhood.
---
RANKING UP FEELS COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS, CAUSE THERE'S NO REWARD FOR DOING IT. JUST GIVE PEOPLE SMALL AMOUNT OF SHARDS/BLOOD POINTS REACT TIME WE RANK UP (AS IN REACH NEW NUMBER) AND/OR A LARGE AMOUNT BASED ON OUR RANK AT THE RESET.
---
Yeah the devs really have no idea what balance is bro i play a good mix of killer and survivor, pallets and hitboxes are fucked, this update on my main (the pig) is fucked, and they castrated legion too, legion wasn't ok but the steps they took to fix him (banning people exploiting their mistake) and turning him into another generic killer just weren't the way to go and its getting old spending 80% of the time i play this game pissed off or in a black screen, the pig helped that by making killer less stressful but now she's just another generic m1 killer with an ok ambush attack, if it makes it past the ptb I'm just done
---
I can't find them for some reason, I don't know why. You can at least provide a link if you're gonna be rude about it :/
---
Please don't.
---
The positive thing is that end game pig dies and isn’t oppressive.
---
Does that include killers?
---
[removed]
---
Link?
---
they literally came up with an entire new gameplay mechanic (endgame) bc killers can’t stop complaining about t-bagging at the exit gates... so?? come again lol.  BUT i do agree amanda’s nerfs are ridiculous and if anything she could use some buffs
---
Look out tunnel snakes the end-game timer is about to run out! Oh fuck they can't hear us over the legion's terror radius oh shit
---
Your not existent argument is also null to me. :)
---
just in case someone needs a reference
---

---
Top Skill level was taken more from opinions of rank 1s.  Intermediate was mostly from experience.  Low skill ranks based on the fundamental ideas of learning to hunt and killers that can function without map awareness or game IQ.  I just curve fit beginer, intermediate and expert (1,2,3 respectively).
---
After reading comments and playing since it came out on PC.  I feel this is the average consensus of the community.
---
I just posted as a better visual to the typical killer tier list where people debate that it matters about skill level whom is best.
---
Well, dont worry! After the mid chapter patch, the bug is no more!
---
It should be “If you are the last survivor alive, gain a 5% opening speed for each remaining generator.” This would give you a 35% boost if no gens are done and a 10% boost with all 5 done. That way it would be a niche version of wake up.
---
Is... that not what the killer should do anyway?
---
Really though
---
Honestly it’s a stealth buff that keys badly need, so I’m all for it
---
His username didn't say zubat, so I just wanted to be safe
---
God forbid you ignore every argument they’ve made about terror radius removing the urgency of the trap and the gens being powered making an already weak ability completely nonexistent after the gens are powered for an end game collapse that changed nothing about the balance of the game in any meaningful way, objectively nerfing a killer that was already quite bad in both the end and mid game.
---
But no, don’t you DARE question a decision BHVR makes. You’ll just be part of the mob mentality. It has nothing to do with whether or not BHVR has a history of making mistakes and needing to go back and correct them. We’ve never seen anything like that before.
---
Really killers shouldn’t worry about balance at all. If you kill all 4 survivors before the gen pops it doesn’t matter. If you can’t do that on a slow M1 killer you’re probably just trash.
---
Where did you get camping and tunneling from we just trying to play the game
---
STARRED PLAYING RECENTLY, LIKED KILLER A LOT. I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHICH KILLER TO BUY. I REALLY LIKED LEGION'S POWER FANTASY AND I WAS LIKE, YEAH GONNA BUY LEGION WHEN I HAVE THE CHANCE. **LEGION CHANGES GET ANNOUNCED** OH COME THE FUCK ON, NOW THE KILLER ISN'T GONNA PLAY HOW I LIKED IT AND IS PROBABLY GONNA BE WEAKER THAN BEFORE THE CHANGES.
---
OH WELL, GUESS I MIGHT BUY SOME AURIC CELLS AND GET THE PIG, SHE SEEMS FUN. **PATCH NOTES ARE ANNOUNCED** ARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ME? SAME SHIT TWICE IN A ROW, BEFORE I'VE GOT 40 HOURS I THE GAME.
---
Glad to hear! If not we would have given you the OK to put him on a hook until he agreed. :P
---
The theory was based around how useful an ability is to a player of the appropriate skill level.  Nurse is the obvious example where ability to far too difficult for beginners to use and you are simply a slow moving killer but undisputedly the best with experts, where wraith is probably easiest to gain advantage for noobs since he helps in locating but really brings nothing to the table if you dont need that crutch.
---
you know that with bloodlust mechanic all killers will eventually catch you if they commit to the chase and there is not much that you can do about it? you can juke and hide, but then again, its even relatively easier to do with legion because of his limited tracking during frenzy
---
people just don't like changing the playstyle from looping to actually trying to lose the killer
---
its still all about how long it takes for a killer to take down a person in chase, and no mixtape legion was really slow at doing that, only slightly faster than Freddy who literally has no chase related power and has been for a long time the worst killer in the game
---
the mixtape was the problem, legion needed to be redesigned with numeric values and they needed to make missed hits in frenzy have normal cd, but even in that one change that had to be done they went overboard
---
remove mixtape, add normal missed hit cd in frenzy, buff the numeric values of normal frenzy and the legion is an unique killer that just forces different playstyle from both sides
---
but instead they just soft-deleted him from the game
---
Oh then let me clarify— you’re exposing how bad you are at the game
---
This. All the damn time.
---
Endgame Pig was the opposite of a NOED build so you immediately sound like you know nothing. The whole point of Endgame Pig is to entice survivors to stick around around longer so you get more hooks and shit. NOED just entices then to leave.
---
Also the Hillbilly I had a 9.75 just under nurse at top level, must have imputed wrong number.
---
Especially on console too.
---
You’re right I am
---
No addons? Wouldn't the circle be complete of you use instasaw addons?
---
A slow is nowhere near the same thing as a blink strike
---
what purpose does it have though?
---
anyone help？
---
As a trapper main, this made my day.
---
/s
---
Haha shit your pants. I love when people call it that xD
---
the definition of toxicity is:
---
Meta build, tbagging, spam clicking flashlight, looping killers, cleansing hexes, unhooking survivors, and maybe escaping all in one game
---
And the point of Endgame Pig - stalling out the endgame - would be completely broken with the EGC, so BHVR would have to slow down the EGC/etc. on trapped victims to compensate for that which goes against their intentions for implementing the EGC.
---
I GOT MATCHED AGAINST 2 KILLERS RECENTLY. THE MAIN ONE (TRAPPER) INSISTED HE WAS THE ONLY ONE AFTER THE GAME, BUT I FUCKING SAW THAT LEGION AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE GAME. SURVIVORS DON'T HAVE FROSTY EYES. THE WORST THING WAS THAT I ONLY SAW THE LEGION ONCE SO I QUESTIONED MY SANITY WHEN THE TRAPPER SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. BUT THERE'S A FUCKING REASON THE OTHER TWO SURVIVORS DISCONNECTED.
---
Maybe mint rag?
---
I have this image but it has a white background. Where do I find one without the background?
---
As a killer main its literally the killers fault if you let someone juke you for more than two minutes. Just leave with your ego and gen patrol and if you catch them later after they wasted a ton of pallets then enjoy a little victory
---
Really good in swf. Its my favorite item
---
I play console man, played this game for 6-8 months so far, play as killer sometimes but I main survivor. I just play the game for fun, I don’t nerd this game like you probably. So god forbid I’m uneducated on a few things in this game, give me a break.
---
I don't look at myself as the best player, but you sure seem to look at yourself that way, which inherently shows that you're just a salty rank 16.
---
Also blink hits don't do anything to survivors with Deep Wounds.
---
Go check the wiki dude.
---
Oh my! I didn’t even realize this was a thing! I just looked it up now i feel dumb, i don’t play her enough to know her rare add ons 😐
---
It’s better. I’m sorry, that could be interpreted as incredibly mean and hurtful because literally anything would be better than the present Endgame Collapse system. It honestly feels like Behavior is doing [the absolute least they can possibly do and wrapping it up in the shiniest package. ](https://youtu.be/kBoesEFWZnM)
---
What I meant was, “It’s better *and I like it.*” It’s a much more balanced and fair system than what’s on the PTB— and dammit I’m doing it again. I would like to see this implemented.
---
&gt; I mean you can go and check with multiple members of the community that rank 1 is meaningless.
---
And that summarizes this entire discussion. You're basing your opinion around _what other people have said_, especially when you're taking what they've said out of context.
---
Getting to rank 1 __does not__ mean you're a good player, but the _vast majority_ of good players are at rank 1. __That's__ the point when people say rank doesn't matter.
---
I don't think it is him unless he deleted the comment
---
So, yeah, Deep Wounds.
---
I meant useful as in the argument for her being not nerfed, wording came across wrong
---
^
---
No I'm not weighing in on is it a fix, I'm not arguing about your position on the fix. I'm pointing out that your initial example was a flawed representation.
---
And btw 
---
&gt; it's a standoff. It stays a standoff. Closing the hatch is supposed to end this - but this mechanic 100% will not do that.
---
Closing the hatch 100% ends the stand off. If you choose not to close the hatch and camp on it instead then sure it's a standoff, but actually closing the hatch does literally end the hatch stand off
---
Pixels moving up and down  and flashlight being spammed isn't toxic
---
It’s to mark important objects. I use it pretty often as a solo survivor if I want to mark gens, or an exit gate I’ve opened.
---
M'daddy😘😘
---
I actually made it in Photoshop! I took a picture of the perk and masked it into a png, then printed it, cut it out, and glued it over the purple diamond I painted.
---
I have checked.....but I can’t find it
---
You saying the boner was never a feature? D:
---
As someone with the achievement you're looking to get, and a trapper main, here's my advice to get the achievement. 
---
Setup for 3 gen, trap pallets instead of breaking them if they're close to a hook, if you place it right, they can't dodge it and they'll easily forget about it. Your strongest advantage for getting achievement is killer shack. Trap the doors and window after you have one player in basement, the rest will go like dominoes as long as you keep the traps active.
---
U dont have to nerd the game to know that myers isnt OP, he has a lot of counters, 
---
1. Looping
---
2. Gen rush: he doesnt have a good map control
---
3. Dont let him to stalk u
---
4. Run premonition
---
I'm lucky he's a killer main :P
---
Running around a pallet is skill you fucking moron. You wanna sit there and be sardonic but you come off mentally challenged. Knowing how many loops you can make on the pallet, when ti throw it down. Knowing how to time the pallet on a lunge and not getting hit. Analyzing route for the next pallet. Repeat. We may not have a lot of ways to express skill at the game, but its definitely one of them. And no dbd is not dying but oh boy i cant wait to see you stop playing
---
I wish it was not gonna lie.
---
I swear it's an actual in-game advantage, people are too busy staring at it to look where they are going.
---
But they said something about joysticks on patch notes
---
Thank you!!
---
&gt;In your case, you don't play at rank 1 and never have
---
And you are basing that on your guessing?
---
The pig is an ideology. Anyone can become the pig. The representation of the pig isn't just hers. Someone hasn't seen the other movies apparently.
---
Ok, your flair is just about right, kappa. But how tbagg and flashlight spamming is not toxic?
---
I don’t like to play against Billys or Bubbas, i hate being downed on one hit because I’m terrible enough as a survivor i don’t need the extra help sucking
---
A bit out of the blue I know but I saw Jen is throwing a baby shitfit on twitter  about those perks and she's calling you out for it. Can you either link me the thread it was posted in or the spot I can download them? Streisand effect is a helluva thing.
---
Always nervous as killer. Flipping pallets and tearing my head through the brush like a coked out Gary Busey unable to find a single survivor.  Every second I'm not bumbling after someone I feel the match slipping away and gens popping in the distance...
---
-20 .. -25 Celsius ( -4 .. -13 Fahrenheit) is the "normal" winter here, it could be -30 to -40 Celsius (-22 to -40 Fahrenheit) or even lower for a couple of weeks :) It's not too bad :) But I understand it's different for others, I'm a highly cold-tolerant weirdo. I love breathing cold air, it's so fresh and feels like you're breathing delicious ice cream. I can't breathe hot summer air, I feel bad at summer to the point of often not being able to sleep properly. It could be as hot as +30 Сelsius and higher for an entire month (86+ Fahrenheit, probably it's normal for the rest of the world though, but here it feels like hell).
---
Anyway I love it here, especially the huge amounts of snow.

It’s the Pig’s soul ascending to heaven after this recent nerf
---
What'd they change about the wraith?
---
I have Vietnam flashbacks of a time of instant flashlights, no bloodlust, more pallets, Civilization V, and nothing to stop survivors from window looping forever. Almost a year to fix those problems. Yet when we had machine gun builds or even remotely fast builds (back when STBFL was good) it was nerfed as soon as survivors complained.
---
Smh some people
---
Freddy is one of my better characters but I've adapted a very different way to play him.
---
First, seems strange but I dont focus on sacrifice points, instead I can reliably max other category's for a consistant 30k.
---
I prioritize putting multiple survivors in dream state, hit them, then rush back to defense.  I usually get 2-3 in dream right away, then damage with first free hit, then change targets since I can monitor most of the survivors.  I've found the second hits are easy when they have zero clue where you are coming from.  Keep them constantly down on ground and injured.  They spend so much time fleeing and you know whom to target to scare them away from generators.  You kind of have to have a play with your food mentality and switch targets constanly.
---
Basically fight all of them, keeping occasional pressure on each even if you dont eliminate any.
---
Sacrifices are a bonus.
---
WHY DOES IT SOMETIMES TAKE FUCKING FOREVER TO FIND A SURVIVOR GAME ON PS4? I DON'T WANT TO PLAY KILLER IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME.
---
Tbh I usually get kills with Pig by yoinking people off gens
---
But with the increased cooldown they run away so far that the time gained is wasted catching up
---
As a survivor main I 100% agree with this. I've never understood the want to "teabag" or troll the killer. What if the killer see's it and DC's? I've had too many matches where my friends and I have powered all five gens and the killer DC's because they're mad. I'm getting the open and gtfo! Good for you for teaching a jerk not to be rude. Maybe next time they'll think twice!
---
He was such a good sport (even ran and hid from us! 😂) That we let the entity take all of us lol
---
Tbh,it’s not that weird.The developer of Yandere Simulator sells panties(he’s a bit of weirdo but my point still stands),body pillows in general are reasonably popular,and there’s apparently a large gay male and straight female following for this game.The gay part I’m not to sure about because my only basis is that someone said some larger streamers swing that way(hope someone can name them to put it in perspective.)
---
Still,I’m surprised it’s on the official store and not some fan made thing.
---
WAIT, COULD YOU ELABORATE? HOW DOES IT NEGATE NOED?
---
If time was an issue then this is definitely not the game to DC in because the matchmaking will make you wait. I always wonder how much time the first down quitters spend just sitting in or waiting for a lobby. I also play a lot of Apex and a lot of people quit there too but it actually makes sense if time is your priority because matchmaking is fast.
---
Sure, Jan.
---
Oh hey Prime 🤩
---
be myers run tombstone
---
dont tier 3 until exit gates are open
---
see someone tbagging
---
:)
---
Thanks! At this point I'm convinced that the community can come up with better changes, so that's why I made this a discussion and not just a suggestion. If anyone feels that something I've said could be tweaked do speak up. There are things I probably missed that are troublesome in the EGC. Those were just the top 6 ones I could think of at the moment, in addition ones for the Pig.
---
I thought the change WAS that Legion is now 115%
---
whispers.
---
because im not soft
---
This is seriously fubar!
---
I saw that Myers and forgot how to read, but I'm sure what you're saying makes sense
---
Lol is she really? I doubt it. I didn't even make them. I reposted them from somewhere else online. If she's mad, she can go be mad at someone else.
---
“I mean you could do that, but why? Why would you do that?”

My suggestion:
---
-For every survivor who is still alive inside the trial when you escape you gain a 10/20/30% bonus to all blood points. Survivors who have already escaped do not count. 
---
-If you are the last survivor alive, you will be able to see the aura of the hatch and gate boxes from sixteen minutes away. 
---
Still a late game perk. Rewards players for keeping their team alive but encourages them to get out before them. Still has utility if you’re the last person alive.
---
Next level: *Pulling out a gun and shooting your screen to kill the killer and win*
---
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going.
---
2 minutes into prom, he stands up and starts looking for the survivor who broke it, leaving your night ruined
---
I think they're just being paranoid. They dont want things to be the next legion. Unfun gameplay isnt fun.
---
Same. It's super useful for helping others find their way to an open gate if they don't have Wake Up! Good for marking the hatch, too (as long as you don't care about getting hatch yourself). I've yet to see it used by another survivor in-game, though.
---
also an Option to consider and the Bonus BP might bring more People to use it
---
Ready your ebony
---
Very nice style. My only gripe is the teeth looking just a tad derpy, but everything else is noice

Nurse is fine, it's mainly her addons that are broken. No addon Nurse is completely fine but cross map blinks and Omega blinks are when it drifts into the realm of OP.
---
All this damn update did was nerf killers. Yea it added the cool endgame collapse shit but you cant even use it to make a cool play for it was safe proofed so you cant make a cool play
---
Quite the adult you must be, real big man over here.
---
Great. They are still very unfun to play against since it destroys game mechanics.

---
You mean Myers/Shape, not Jason?
---
Lmao I am a Freddy main and this just made my day
---
Thats exactly why. BHVR don't follow common sense, they do the exact opposite.
---
Yup. I usually only play killer for dailies, because it gives me anxiety.
---
This
---
Regularly two weeks after the PTB goes out.
---
if you think its toxic youre soft
---
I wish I could give this more upvotes just for the Fallout reference.
---
Which would be fine, if teabaggers didn't act all goshdarned surprised when the killer continues to focus them even *after* they've been hooked.
---
AH. A FELLOW PRIME.
---
You know that’s still stealing right? Does this not click?
---
Nope that’s them saying  we suck.
---
That's just the unfortunate reality of it. You got the short end of the stick, and got caught, and because the killer chose to play that way (camping) you're just screwed. 
---
As survivor, I never see rank as something personal or a good representation of just yourself. A lot of times, you have to rely on your teammates, and if your teammates are shit, and bring you down with them, then yeah, it's gonna drop. I stopped seeing it as a personal rank and just a rank of how fortunate you are to have good games where you managed to be successful.
---
I mean backwards walking Legion was also a playstyle till BHVR started banning for it. Still doesn't mean its a playstyle worth allowing.
---
Well I do feel they should have told us about the pig changes and retain the old pig in the end game collapse to test what is fun and unfun then proceed from there. They keep messing up on the communication with the community for some reason.
---
They'll bleed out first
---
If you play pig you should always have whispers anyway wtf?
---
The problem is that you contributed to the problem. Instead of reposting them and be like ah whatever idc about this shit. You should’ve called out the person because then you make yourself the target, guilty by association.
---
It makes me just not want to play survivor. There's too many little bullshit things that you have no control over that could ruin the game for you. It doesn't feel fun
---
I rewrote my reply maybe 5 times now and it kept coming out condescending or negative. Ill say this. I'm red ranks. Not that it ever really matters to some people who think the ranking system is a joke. Im not the best player, but I know that im good. I also know that new players think playing immersed and hiding a lot is the way to play because when they get caught they go down quick. The better you get at looping, the less you care that the killers coming your way. The killer almost has to smack me off the gen before I give a shit about running away. Maybe you should introspect and realize that if your smack dab in the middle in terms of skill, that you shouldnt just hold strong opinions and argue with people, when you still have a lot to learn
---
*Flatlined Oink*
---
In a way I like how freddy works though, his entire thing is that he works via fear. If people aren't afraid of him he's powerless, which is kind of how it works in the game since anyone that knows how he works can dunk on ~~me~~ Freddy mains all day.
---
Why the hell would plagues run it? Plauges want survivors to cleanse so they can get corrupt purge lmao
---
I’m hoping they keep RBTs as they are, but their ticking slows or stops the end game timer. Seems to be the most obvious answer. Dying and hooked affect the end game progress. Why not pig traps?
---
How does it destroy game mechanics? I literally ran around a gen that was next to two trees for a whole feral frenzy and they never caught me
---
I agree but dont be surprised if the "people can enjoy the game how they want stop whining and get better"s come along.
---
Both are toxic for continuing to msg each other.  You don't want toxicity,  leave end game chat like an adult.  Nobody had ever won an argument in end game chat.
---
True but it would also cause survivors running aimlessly to find pools without assistance and if they can't cleanse they can be instadowned. It depends on how you wanna play as Plague
---
What is it again?
---
Idk bud, I've had games where all gens were done when they were all still alive. I still got a 4k thanks to ~NOED~ my skill as a killer.
---
Nah, just all ideas for what needs to happen with him.
---
He should be deleted or reworked. I don't care about him being nerfed, that was my point.
---
Zombieland SAGA.
---
I appreciate the fact that you rewrote your reply. I'm red ranks as well. I run with a SWF who are all in red ranks. We all run alert because it's easier than communicating where the killer is. I don't do immersion. I run the killer.
---
I thought they made it so he vaults slower now, I'm gonna take a look to see if I'm correct.
---
Good survivors don’t give Myers, “just the right moment,” without a pretty major screwup.  So while you aren’t wrong, it’s not that simply.
---
Was thinking in the player mindset not the BHVR mindset XDD
---
Oh, im really sorry that this devs doesnt care about console:(
---
They should have ~~clensed totems~~ outskilled your skills, huehue
---
Yeah... I get it... But it's gone now. I made a mistake according to Jen, and now the mistake is gone. It had a total of like 2 downloads anyway (I had to rehost the file myself, because the original link was from a sketchy website, and I can see that the file got a total of 2 downloads, one was from me checking it worked lol) so there's almost no damage done.
---
Just have the endgame timer slow or pause when a trap is active.  Seems simple to me.
---
We can literally see the watermark of Chickennunget.
---
Well you wouldn't "make it three steps out of the basement" if you keep walking back in to say hello to your friend on the hook.
---
I play killer to de-stress cause it’s always a lower rank. You could do that if you play survivor a lot.
---
Taking a bite of a slice of pizza and throwing the pizza in the air to hit the skill check
---
I think that nurse is a Killer that gives great games but a but lame to playing against when you're alone and you literaly get rekt and no gens done everyone dead u get that to do tha you need a FUCKING TON of hours but as someone playing in low ( do we say low or high)rank 1-5 
---
I can say that somw times it's lame.
---
I absolutely agree it does none of those things, but again, I don't think that was the intention of the change. I feel like it was just a consistent "We're changing things from not ticking down during chase to not ticking down while in the terror radius".
---
Psst. I think he deleted the post batman
---
Excuse me, MOST, I’ve heard it all. If you camp you are simply ruining that persons fun especially when it’s a leatherface who is facecamped eyeball to eyeball with his chainsaw ready to go. Your not gonna rescue them. That players match is over.
---
Its completely self centred and illogical.
---
Well that’s kinda cute
---
Remove hatch standoffs my ass.
---
you wont be able to trap survivors after all gens are done
---
RBT timer stops in terror radius instead of chase and if you put a trap on after gates are powered it doesn't activate and survivors can walk right out the exits.
---
LOL
---
i don’t know a whole lot about tarot cards, but I thought this one described him well. Here’s a link if you’d like to read more about the “Upright Fool” meaning. 
---
Also i’ve thought about doing other survivors and killers, if you have any ideas, please let me know! 
---
https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list/the-fool-meaning-major-arcana-tarot-card-meanings
---
So what happened. Did he say something bad about the EGC or did he say its not that bad.
---
To each their own, im horrible at nurse and play her the least, only for dailies, when i do play her im so bad i koss blinks half the time etc and i can STILL get 4k's because the chases are so short, this is high ranks too.
---
Just my experience though. You know? When i flop in a game as huntress i get completely railed and 0 kills.
---
Wasn’t the Freddy rework supposed to be for the mid chapter?
---
What about survivors jumping through windows the Entity is supposed to be blocking?
---
he does not think it is really that bad. in fact he even used one of the things ppl are calling a nerf to his advantage and that was the traps timers stop when in terror radius
---
It’ll always be my personal favorite. I liked the bogeyman a lot, and, of course, I love rain so much more than sunshine. I also thought it was just really fun to play.
---
Want to watch VHS porn later?
---
Okay fine. 
---
Pre collapse the killer has to concede the standoff for it to conclude (in most cases, sometimes it ends in a grab)
---
Post-collapse the killer can close the hatch and hope to hell they're close enough to both gates or otherwise admit that closing the hatch was conceding the match anyway since gates can still be completely across the map and will take less time to open.
---
Brings a whole new meaning to “Ive got my eye on you.”
---
Same here. And even then I’d rather just leave the match and get to the next game.
---
Okay now I understand all the “sad oinks”
---
Agreed about the bogeyman, he’s one of my favorite SH villains. I wanted to be him for Halloween when the game came out (I was about 15 at the time), he was so cool to me.
---
SO. MANY. FUCKING. CRASHES.
---
I FEEL LIKE I'VE DDOS'D THEIR SERVERS WITH CRASH REPORTS AT THIS POINT.
---
You’re ugly, you’re disgusting, I’m gonna kill you, give me 200 dollars
---
Hows that an advantage?
---
Sounds just a tad...
---
*salty*
---
I have to s'y playing against a 5 blink nurse is really lame and it usualy goes like this : 
---
I start the game 
---
Do a gen
---
Start a chase
---
5 sec later im dead
---
10 sec later Everyone is dead and bo gens done
---
*YOU LIKE THE SIGHT OF YOUR OWN BLOOD?!* oh wait that’s raider language. Same thing I guess
---
Ok....
---
I’m sure with that kind of language and attitude they will get right on that!
---
Agree with this, but leatherface doesn’t need the tantrum reduction time, the idea is for the tantrum to really punish you for running into something, it’s no different from billy except leatherface can still down during his tantrum
---
On EGC in general, he said that 3 minutes is way too long of a time for when the door opens. Don't remember if he said that in this or the Legion or Survivor video, but quoting from memory: "three minutes is too long. The moment the timer appears it should be like 'oh shit, it's time to go', right now it's more of 'eh, I'll leave when I feel like it'".
---
I don't remember the exact quote, but it was basically that.
---
As for Pig, in the last showcased video he literally had three people with RBT's on their head, the last generator got powered (Turning them on), he went and opened the door..... and one of them died on hook, he slugged one of them, and the third guy got his trap off immediately and got the door opened.
---
Monto literally had to pick up the last, downed survivor, let him wiggle off his shoulder, the dude ran over to the first box he could find..... and immediately got the trap off. Monto picked him up in disgust and forced him out the door since the hatch was already closed.
---
The rank 20’s are striking again
---
According to Noob3, The Legion is more fun to play as, but he couldn't say the same about playing against a legion as he didn't play survivor in that video. I personally think that he might be slightly more decent to play against than before, but he still needs a buff in the deep wound effect.
---
thanks man. just wanted to make sure this wasn't looked down upon
---
How about stopping with the nerfs and starting with the buffs to trash tier killers?
---
*if an all 4 legion members game mode existed*
---
I mean really the point is that it could make escaping extremely difficult but at the same time the traps are meant to kill people so if it does its job that's intended. The more I think about it the more I think it can be fair. If the pig wants to camp boxes then that's them going out of there way but they cant do that to all 4 survivors.
---
Honestly all killers should have 2+ moris. 
---
Trapper smashes a trap on your head if hes holding one and does his normal mori if he doesn’t.
---
Pig triggers the RBT if a survivor is wearing one and does her current mori if not
---
Hag does something if she has no available traps and current if not (or vice versa) 
---
Huntress does her current one if she doesn’t have hatchets and throws hatchets at them if she does
---
Myers does a different one for each EW tier 
---
Freddy could do one for survivors who are awake and one for if they are asleep (current if asleep and one where he says “welcome to my world bitch” if they are awake)
---
Plag has one for each puke
---
Clown has one for if he has bottles left
---
Wraith has one if cloaked or not
---
However they will never do this because there is no monetary value in doing so...
---
Awwww. That's a cup of hot chocolate for the soul.
---
Mechanically yes, aesthetically no
---
Does no one think its weird that we are only allowed to have like 3 really strong killers. Not any more than that.
---
10 bucks says everyone but me is gonna say Susie.
---
I like Julie more, with the P2 Bloody jacket, Karambit, and Skull Mask, personally.
---
As much as I know SWF is OP, what keeps me playing is the ability to play with friends. Talking, joking, and having fun with friends is half the reason I play, so I don’t want to get rid of SWF. Something has to be done, but completely dropping SWF is not an option, because there are a lot of players who are like me
---
You appear to be missing a stack, madame.
---
I would actually be behind that decision if they did decide to make that a thing.
---
Found the one weirdo who thinks that pig is overpowered or broken in some way.
---
Sry I was just upset about his rework
---
And therein lies the problem. Nurse and Billy are really the only two viable killers against a well coordinated SWF team. As has been said somewhere else in this discussion SWF fundamentally breaks the game mechanics to a point where it needs an equally broken killer to provide some counterplay.
---
Its arguing hypothetical situations so it is hard to see eye to eye. I think this exact line of change was unnecessary and that there were better courses of action or I don't know maybe let pig go into the ptb changes without nerfs and see how it works? I have said it tons of times. Pig could tunnel trapped survivors in the end game already and nobody complained about it so why get rid of this function now? They could have done lighter nerfs like slow down the timer as if you were hooked/downed and see if people still don't like her power.
---
Regardless of how you view the nerfs they could have tested this out much better. Minimizing a killers ability to a hex perk which loses its function in the end game is a terrible solution. Also I can't think of any other killer with an ability that becomes useless in the end game.
---
No it's not according to Jen it's cause you stole some artwork that wasn't released for public use it's mind blowing how igonrant you are and disrespectful to someone's work what you are 12 y/o if so I completely understand your lack of common Sense
---
Yep. I've done it before using the momentum from an uncloak as my Master Ninja Wraith. So he made the part as he came out of nowhere.
---
Toxic implies you're being a jerk on purpose, if you click the flashlight to be a jerk you're being toxic, doesn't mean you're upsetting the Mark just means you're trying to be a jerk
---
Extra speed is super depressing + he now can mindgame easyer
---
Myers main. Trust me if post game salt is anything to go by he's considered OP in some quarters.
---
All it does, is tell you I'm within thirty something meters. 
---
In a standard game, you're practically always within that range of someone.
---
It was the preemptive datamine on BHVR's part
---
The only thing I hate about legion is how bad his deep wound ability is, I think it needs a nerf tbh.
---
Oooh I can definitely see the appeal of the p2 Jacket, tho I personally don't like to prestiege so I'll probably pass on it. 
---
That's a really nice combo tho! Thanks a lot for the idea.
---
I mean it looks to me like you're the only one whining but sure.
---
Also limited to a maximum of four times assuming you're both good and reasonably fortunate.
---
WHY IS THE PTB SO DUMB? CAN'T YOU USE YOUR ADDONS ANOTHER TIME? ME AND OTHERS JUST WANT TO SEE THE NEW FEATURES LIKE THE ENDGAME COLLAPSE ANIMATIONS BUT NO, YOU HAVE TO RUN NOED AND MORIS AND BE A DOUCHEBAG BY TUNNELING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A TRYHARD, YOU AREN'T GAINING ANY POINTS FOR IT ANYWAYS SO WHY BOTHER?
---
I personally love Susie’s (the one with red hair) but it’s a matter of preference really. If none of the current skins convince you, you can always wait until they release new cosmetics for the killer.
---
10 seconds is for hooks. 1 minute off the 3 minute timer for traps. 
---
In a SWF, a team can coordinate when you are across the map. That is why OOO is a killer on SFW. No time to get there. 
---
They would need to change breakdown for it not to be abused. As long as it is balanced.
---
I'm crossed between that and just green Susie set, I think I'll have to sleep on it to figure it out, haha.
---
I think it’s knowing you’re alone as a killer and you’re in that first person feel more. Whenever I play survivor I feel as though I’m watching a movie and it’s entertaining. As a killer I feel lonely and want to do good on top of it so it’s nerve racking.
---
Who's the most difficult killer to master in your opinion?

---
HONESTLY IVE BEEN SEEING LESS ON PS4 MORE ON PC
---
My combination is green hoodie, bloody knife/karambit and bloody mask (Frank’s). The bloody mask looks really good with Susie’s outfit tbh.
---
I ENJOYED THE DEEPWOUNDS CHANGE I THINK THE FF RECOVERY TIME IS KINDA STUPID THOUGH ALSO THE ONE MISS INSTANT END THING SORTA RUINS THE WHOLE FERAL FRENZY IDEA IMO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO BE ABLE TO MISS A COUPLE TIMES
---
Yare yare
---
I don't know, I'm not a dev. I'm sure they'd come up with something.
---
its not toxic, many times happens anyway. i love when they leave the last 3 gen options in a row in one corner so the last gen takes forever to get done. as survivor i usually try to stay aware for which gens are already done so i dont corner myself like that.
---
Kiss her. Kiss her good.
---
And Frank sounds exactly like the type of teenager a teacher wants to punch but can't due to rules.
---
Thank you!)
---
Hah, these are cute.     
---
You could totally do like a Sunday Paper Comic panel out of these. Just office cubical jokes between killers.
---
This is glorious
---
Naow Kate doesn't have her banshee scream anymore, so she can't do that.
---
This survivor got mad because I was using “op addons” and all I do is watch YouTube videos.
---
I was running doc on game with iridescent king, and smacked him twice after he stood in front of me at a pallet, allowing me to shock him.
---
He killed himself first hook and then slandered his teammates and me.
---
hes the idiot ofc
---
Nurse isn’t that bad on Console with practice, congrats man
---
Rip pig
---
Can I get an f in the chat
---
Mmm, see I'm tempted with the mask but I honestly hate prestieging. 
---
I'll ask a friend who owns more of their cosmetics to show me different combinations, that's probably the best idea.
---
Most killers like bloodpoints. Even campers.
---
i cant wait to do this to myself 
---
im on console so the waiting kind of sucks but streams and clips like this have me excited
---
Yeah those people are actually stupid, why come to the PTB if you don't want to play against Legion? LoL
---
THANK YOU. He’s been arguing with me fir like 30 minutes on it, I had enough time to play another match while he stayed at the main menu messaging me😂😂
---
only useful on the Pig if survivors have active traps.
---
tbh this whole Endgame and Preasure to get out feels kinda pointless. 3 minutes is way too long
---
That's what I been saying and thinking!
---
I'm surprised the devs haven't thought about it
---
Ahh yes just what I was looking for
---
I enjoy Joey set, but all are quality. Welcome to the legion... I'll see myself out
---
tbagging and flashlight spamming is part of having fun.  If that didn't exist  there'd be no fun in the game
---
No more 99%-ing gates against a potential Blood Warden.
---
Your not camping. Theyre just an idiot.
---
Holy shit this is gold
---
Took me way too long to realize this wasn't 5 survivors
---
Idk, I thought it might’ve been just a bit wide. I’m not sure to be honest. Nice job anyways
---
Who do you watch?
---
\&gt; GETTING HIT FIRST. DC  
---
\&gt; SURVIVOR WORKING ON DULL TOTEM. DC  
---
\&gt; KILLER MISS ATTACK. DC  
---
\&gt; KILLER SAW PURPLE FLASH LIGHT. PROCEED GAME THEN DC.
---
HAHAHA THIS MAKE ME LAUGH!
---
It's like the players in Overwatch who complain on the forums about how TBAGGING IS GRIEFING because they're so soft they take everything seriously. If you complain about tbagging you shouldn't play video games
---
While I disagree with you, reading through the comments is painful... everyone is such a dick...
---
If you need help, watching the Youtuber No0b3 can kinda help you with looping, as that's where he specializes, Ussylius also made a pallet tutorial that is pretty damn helpful, and while I know you play casually, if you want to post a complaint on here, odds are you want a solution. If your excuse to not do what I say is "I'm just a casual player", no offense, but take the post down.
---
Another thing is try to find a friend and 1v1 them with them playing any killer you're struggling with, continue doing that and you'll notice your chases getting longer and longer, you'll still get downed, and progress will be slow, and you won't get BP, but it gets you extra practice and more than you get in the game, because in the game your adrenaline goes off and stuff, against a friend it likely won't, and if it does, it won't negatively affect you, which you can apply to real games.
---
Another thing you can do, which will cost you, is but the DLC and see how it's played, see how they see it, I mained Hillbilly and got really good with him, I find Hillbilly's once every 100th game pretty much because I don't play enough survivor to get higher than purple ranks, but when it comes to Hillbilly's, big rip to them, because they don't even stand a chance...
---
These are he most effective ways to learn how to counter Michael or pretty much and killer... I hope this helps and I hope you enjoy this game as much as me.
---
(Side note: Look out for Michael's log ass lunge and speedy vault speed in tier 3, also, Michael has an add-on that give him infinite tier 3)
---
Touche
---
Nah he had some crazy political opinions
---
THAT IS THE REASON THEY ARE POTATO\~ THEY ROLL RIGHT AND LEFT THEN DIE
---
Or... y'know... not waste their time nerfing a killer who's powerful (but not broken) into the ground, please?
---
Then why stop there? What about Billy and Cannibal who can effectively do the same thing but an unlimited amount of times and without a setup.
---
WE NEED TO CALL PIG AS ROASTED PORK NOW! #ROASTEDPORK
---
Its dumb, quicker opening times and nerfs to perks/killers that could counter it.  Unnecessary.
---
Yeah, The artwork is great, it really puts some more personality into the character. Can you link any more artwork you've made for the characters, if you can?
---
10-20 frames on PS4  
---
One shudders to ponder on the frames of the switch, such eldritch magic to run it on a system as itself must come with a price. Always, child.
---
At least with Billy and Leatherface, you know you're basically exposed at all times. With Myers, you have no idea how much stalk he's got until it's too late.
---
Who said anything about nerfing Myers into the ground? A change like that wouldn't be nerfing him "into the ground".
---
hahaha true! cannibal, even i did the basement camp lolx
---
I think they are going to follow through.  BHVR is stupid and stubborn.  I will always hold Freddy against them. Honestly its been how long? Do they not like money or something. Lets piss on our customers opinions and feedback and TELL THEM WHAT THEY WANT.
---
****, I’ll ship it
---
Honestly, I would make accuracy from the addons actually mean something. This would make omega blink be inconsistent because of the reduced accuracy
---
Did you have the balls to stay or did she leave you slugged for 3 minutes?
---
Yeah. Got to have pretty thick skin. I can’t enjoy memes from DBD this week as they aren’t memes just people whining and complaining. 😣😢
---
I'm not complaining I'm just saying it's Toxic since someone here said it wasn't toxic. If you're intentionally trying to upset somebody you are being toxic and are griefing someone, it doesn't mean that it's bothering them it doesn't matter if people are "soft" as you said but it is being toxic if you're intentionally griefing somebody to upset them for your own enjoyment, 
---
And to your point about it being fun, I say it's A-Okay to do things like that to your friends but not random people playing a game that didn't ask for you to grief them,
---
Edit: I realize I sound like a soccer mom

Can you link to any videos of M1 killers not using their power and getting 4K’s at red ranks. I am interested to see why they would get it. 
---
The only thing I can think of is the survivors are SWF with one person in red and the rest low ranks. (Though usually that matches up with a lower killer).
---
I ran Cooldown Add-ons before it was cool.
---
I've no goddamn clue, I just got back into it as well, hard to imagine new players coming to this game, but maybe because of the free weekend a while back?
---
The game. This map is really powerful in the hands of survivors or killers that understand the layout. Also has way more mindgame potential than almost every other map.
---
Yeah people on Reddit are psychopaths, mob mentality morons and get upset someone not as good as them or someone that plays not nearly as much talks down on their game/complains about something they can’t relate to and they just shit on you lol. I don’t care though it’s the internet these people mean nothing to me at all so whatever, but yeah thanks for the advice I’ll check out some of those videos.
---
Yup. But if I put the trap before the last gen, the survivors would mostly wait till its off then pop the gen. The trap also won't automatically turn on when hooking someone at the endgame.
---
So... No point on saving the traps till the end
---
Nah you're not, it's just a three gen straight strategy
---
Okay. Then there is no problem lol
---
Freddy can no longer make survivors sleep. Instead survivors will fall asleep for 20 seconds every 2 minutes. His power allows him to damage awake survivors, but survivors that are asleep gain the exposed affect. All of his addons are changed to affect what hinders survivors during sleep, and the time between sleep spells. No addons increase the time that survivors sleep.
---
But seriously, does anyone know why this bug happens?
---
I PLAYED THIS GAME FOR MORE THEN 1 YEARS, AND I STILL TUNNEL AND CAMP WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE IT, AND I LOVE SEEING SURVIVOR WHINE ABOUT IT! =D, JUST CONTINUE TO DO WHAT BEST FOR YOU =D

---
Agree which is why it's such a common tactic, but it also requires some setup. Myers needs time to build to EW3 he doesn't just wander up to a survivor and down them. He's a weak early game killer for exactly that reason.
---
There are a few effective ways to prolong this setup. Most tactics to counter Huntress will work nicely with Myers.
---
Break line of sight as soon as possible. Most savvy survivors can head for loops or jungle gyms with LoS blockers quite fast 
---
Don't pause after pallet drops and window vaults to watch him. Work out his direction as part of the loop.
---
Don't taunt or teabag, ever. I've lost count of the amount of free stalking I get from that, especially at exit gates.
---
Don't play immersed. Again, free stalking from survivors who aren't looking around when they do gens, cleanse totems or heal are an absolute godsend.
---
imho Myers is one of the most balanced killers in the game. He's got some heavy hitting powers and add-ons but they all come at a price.
---
They already do for everything else, go ahead and throw that in there too.
---
*slaps both* "I think we did a good job so far."
---
Does Bruno Mars is gay?
---
Yep. It is like pre-PTB Legion, just with a MUCH lower skill cap. It is either use OP addons and 3-4K easy or maybe 1K because it takes a while to catch a survivor (2K if you count the DC). 
---
It’s just more obvious with Legion since unskilled players could play and annoy skilled SFW players.
---
Now, if before you were able to down someone eventually while gens are being down, you wont be able to down a good survivor at all, theres no mindgame to legion\`s power at all, you cant use it to catch up to a survivor because of your speed, fatigue time and nerfed vault speed, your power does nothing in a chase. When playing against Trapper you have to fear about traps. When playing against Wraith you have to fear his cloak and speedboost. When playing against Billy you have to fear his ability to shred pallets and 1 down. And etc. Freddy\`s been suffering the same problem, that's why hes the worst killer in the game, that's why we think they butchered legion as well, once people get used to the fact that hes 115% speed, hes only going to be a slightly better version of Freddy
---
I can't get the perk to work either. I don't understand the hit box of it, or if it even exists
---
Lets all not play until the devs add him
---
The issue I have with that is, you can see and hear Huntress prepare herself for a hatchet throw. Myers? You have no idea how much stalk he's got until it's too late.
---
You can make the exact same argument for SWF. Playing survivor takes skill, but 3+ survivors coordinating over coms breaks the game - especially if they're smart about their perks/items.
---
Since rank 10+ you'll hit swf groups nearly every game, I see no issue with a high skill floor and ceiling.
---
I’ve attempted to use this perk numerous times and it hasn’t worked for me once
---
Even Monto couldn't find a way to make the traps useful.
---
The toxicity
---
It's worked for me once, but the killer was a mile away to left , and I couldn't get another hit at that location any time
---
Where’s Legion lol
---
HAVING MY XBOX ONE X LAG ME OR DISCONNECT ME FROM DBD
---
https://youtu.be/JaotiOp45dg
---
I kinda want them to, just to see how much more useless the other characters become
---
I fully agree. It is my opinion that they should integrate coms with the dedicated servers so that the survivors are all on equal footing. 
---
After that and killers get stomped for several weeks and complain, they balance killers to be better. Hard to balance SWF because it basically gives you permanent Tier 3 kindred, empathy, bond, knockout perk immunity, totem count / location sharing, awareness of killer perks, gen progress notifications, and downed survivor recovery progress notifications all without needing any perks (which is why the no perk de-pip squads did not need perks - they had 8 big ones via using coms)
---
I think part of the reason is that people are realising that hardly anyone gets actually punished for purposely dcing a lot, I think as long as you don't dc like half of your games you usually won't get banned. So naturally people take this as a way to basically ensure they get to play more games that are in their favour/they're having the most fun.
---
Just a theory of mine but I think it might be at least close to the truth of the matter.
---
WHEN I WAS IN RED RANKS THERE WAS DEFINITELY WAY LESS DCS
---
It’s a hard to swallow pill. They did it because they thought it was needed with end game collapse.
---
Even after the main buffs (regening hooks, bloodlust, kicking gens and window barricades) was introduced the players would still bully the killer relentlessly because they WEREN'T enough. Borrowed time in a decent lobby was AIDS. Decisive was disgusting and if you werent by a wall picking up a survivor was a super risky game for the longest time. Atleast they added timing so you cant get your EPIC GAMER MOMENT flashlight saves easily. Body blocking was a HUGE issue too, now its strategic and Im cool with it but if someone stood in front of the hook it would literally not even give a chance to killers for the hook.
---
There are still issues with gen-rushing, "infinite circles" and T-walls. Yeah survivors need somewhere to go but oh my god do you have to put so many objects around the map where you can run around in circles with the killer until they get bloodlust 3? It makes every chase a huge risk for the killer...like more than it should. They could either chase one person for 20 seconds to do their objective or risk a couple of gens from popping because they stopped gen patrolling.
---
 At this point if im in a chase for more than 30 seconds I just walk away which brings out their unearned cockiness (im referring to circle runners) and brings out the infamous T-bags and pointing. Its funny though, the same people who run in circles every game and waste a good 2-3 minutes of the killers time (more than enough to pop a gen) are the same people who claim killers are OP when they get smacked down when bloodlust actaully lets them catch up. WE ARE KILLERS, YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO TAUNT US OR "JUKE" US YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO RUN OUT OF SIGHT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THERES A REASON YOUR ONLY WEAPON IS A GODDAMN FLASHLIGHT
---
Agreed
---
Honestly after playing Nurse I felt that she was a lot more balanced than it would originally seem. That being said her design at its core is rather unhealthy for the game (as the meta currently is at least) and there are certain addons that are way too strong right now. (5 Blinks xd)
---
In particular I think a lot of her weaker addons should be tweaked to have less of (if not just flat out no) downside since they're so hard to use as is. In addition I'd like some tweaks to her power so that it's mainly used in a chase to get hits at loops/pallets as opposed to being her main way of moving around. I know that sounds weird but basically I think it's unfair that a Killer with so much anti-loop strength also has such high mobility, so her general mobility could be turned down in favor of chasing power. Something like longer fatigue on a miss but shorter fatigue on a hit? I don't know how you'd do it.
---
Honestly I think Nurse on her own is fine but in the grand scheme of things she's rather strong. I'd much rather we buff weaker Killers to give them more strengths than nerf good Killers so that every Killer is mediocre at best.
---
*Billy* though... I've said it once I've said it a thousand times: why does the Killer with the best mobility in the game, an instadown, and a fast pallet break move at 115% when the Killers who have limited counterable mobility (Hag and Spirit) move at 110% and the Killer who has a ranged attack (that requires ammo) moves at 110% and also has a unique terror radius that allows you to easily track her location and immediately identify what Killer it is?
---
No matter how I look at it Billy's power is better than Spirit's in 95% of circomstances. So why Billy is 115% when Spirit is 110% is beyond me.
---
And I know people like to meme at me whenever I say this but... Jesus Christ the deformed cripple moves as fast as the in-her-prime survivalist who spent their entire life hunting wild game in the forests of Siberia?
---
Careful, the survivor mains might be listening
---
thats because the stun happens when they left the locker but the check for it is when they pressed to leave. Its about 1 ish seconds difference. Which can lead to some funny moments because you can be like 4ish meters away and still get stunned. Which is why as a killer you got stunned way off to the side. Add in some latency and you can be pretty far away. One time i had the killer crawling around in the inner chambers of the temple of purgation. You know that area that had two lockers separated by like 9 meters of a wall with two stairs? I once stunned a killer from my locker as he got to the other locker. I died laughing
---
Well isn’t this just the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
---
My main confusion comes from the fact that traps are generally shorter on time than the end game will be so I don't know many situations where trap timers will last longer than end game unless someone stayed like more than 30 seconds passed the exits opening which seems ridiculous.
---
You can request a refund on steam as long as it has been less than 14 days and you did not play for 2 hours in game.
---
Jane Romero.
---
Agreed. Not toxic. The survivors just have to push you away from one area in chases prior to gen locking themselves.
---
It wont last longer unless you get a trap on half way through the timer or something. If you put it on right when it starts people will have like 2 and half minutes for the trap then 30 seconds to get out if you aren't in a chase. I'm not a good survivor and I dont know if I will be able to manage to do that against a pig. Good players shouldn't have a issue though.
---
I've had fun with this build too. Seeing a freddy look around lost and baffled while in HIS dream world is hilarious!
---
As for the 4th perk, lithe, balanced landing, adrenaline, dance with me, urban evasion, or iron will.
---
Lithe is, in my opinion, the most flexible of these. It can outright lose a killer in the right situation, otherwise it extends a chase big time. If you want the sneaky last survivor build, then urban and iron will is where it's at.
---
Balanced landing is best for looping killers all game, the reduced stutter makes drop down vaults very strong for survivors.
---
Adrenaline if you plan on kiting the killer during the last gen chases.
---
I don't recommend self care, med kits are way faster, and its tough to find time to heal with OoO.
---
I also don't recommend Left Behind, its not fast enough right now, and even after its upcoming buff, killers will most likely just shut the hatch before you can get any gens done when you're the last survivor.
---
Your build is really fun on maps like The Game or Lery's, where you can draw a killer to you, then creep around corners just on the edge of his/her sight.... probably the most tense moments this game can offer.
---
yeah how dare i think closing it means something what kind of super entitlement do i have to think that its a little bs that the whole endgame collapse can be ignored by an item what a guy i am for think that's a little weird and even potentially unfair. something i think is kind of a problem with the way thing are balanced is that the devs always want survivors to have a way out no matter how bad things get. Its why pig got the changes in this ptb my problem with the key is that its just second chance, again. And now im writing a paragraph to explain my thoughts so that i don't get downvoted into oblivion for being snarky. yikes
---
My entire fucking survivor experience
---
&gt;But if I put the trap before the last gen, the survivors would mostly wait till its off then pop the gen.
---
This is what the RBTs are supposed to be used for, keeping the survivors from finishing gens while its on somebody and having one survivor not doing gens while he is frantically searching for the box that hast the key to the trap in it. Thereby giving you enough time to pressure the 3 others and putting traps on them.
---
They were never meant to kill  the survivors reliably, as is evidenced by the 50% chance for a key on every box.
---
Does it work like that on high ranking survivors ? Probably not, they will just do gens until 99% and pop them when the trap is off.
---
I’m a Hag/Trapper/Legion main (survivor to me is boring or frustrating solo, so I just occasionally play that. Still unlocked all the survivor perks)
---
I feel your pain.
---
As much as I miss evolve with a passion, peer to peer is not worth it, they're no longer monitored or updated &amp; end up cheat infested. Peer to peer is the worst service you can get because it offers no viable protection to it's users. If DBD ever dropped their project in it's current state as peer to peer, anti-cheat would just break, all players whom played would be opened to being exploited.
---
Ya gonna cwy about it?

At the moment this is all what I can show, although I can also show animated wallpaper for desktop.

It never was oppressive....
---
That sounds like the typical Nea player.
---
Killer is simply too stressful of a role to not be anxious imo. You will get insulted whether you do well or bad so that's to start but also theres just so much knowledge you need about the game in order to do half decent vs other players who know how to play the game.
---
It's really to the point that I dont even play killer anymore because what's the point? Mettle of man screws over M1 killers and without hundreds of hours of game knowledge you would not know which pallets are safe, what routes survivors take and where they hide, the correct way to run loops and mind game where necessary and a bunch of other stuff which really adds to the role simply for those with tons of knowledge and nobody else.
---
Add to that and the general feeling I'm getting is that even long term killer players are getting fed up with Behaviour's lack of needed changes to bring weaker killers to actual viability. And their adversity to putting anything in the game that is too un-fun for survivors (hint that's anything that gives a killer player power)
---
It sucks because I dont want to run out of killer players my level to play against.
---
I’ve got a fuck ton of karma to burn through idgaf I’ll say what I want.
---
That’s not deliverance? And even if she did have deliverance, how is it greedy? No one is saving her and she still has no chance at the hatch. Might as well just get your points.
---
I like calling him Splinter Cell Myers. Scratched Mirror is basically the DBD equivalent of Sam Fisher's visor and I've seen pics of him wearing it, even. 
---
Even Trapper has some diversity. He's a killer that's generally so average that he's easily melded and shifted around with perks. He has so much diversity and so many tools to work with. Gen defense? Check. Contingency Plan? Check. Besides, he's the true king of the basement, and has been since before those little Insidious Cannibals came along. 
---
Admittedly, Trapper's add-ons are kinda hit or miss but crazy good combinations do exist and he has what I deem the most subtly powerful red addon in the whole game--the almighty Iridescent Stone. 
---
Guess I'm rambling. But it's hard not to love a Killer that's served me so well for two years.
---
If he played that good he should also be a rank 0
---
People complain about facecamping because most of those survivors are low rank, once you get to high rank the complaints (usually) change. They shift towards the amount of skill required for each task, because killers no longer feel the need to facecamp or tunnel in order to kill/pressure. There’s a huge difference between the low rank/high rank player base and what they want or how they perceive the game. Why do you hear more about facecamping? Easy, because there are more players in low rank than high rank.
---
*insert pipping system drag here*
---
Perk idea: What a Twist
---
Hitting a survivor changes one of their perks to a random perk at the same tier level. 
---
...Surprise no mither!
---
Haven't you heard? Complaining about Legion being OP is *so* last month. 
---
Complaining about Legion being nerfed in the *new* hotness, darling!
---
I got my eye on you... literally
---
I wouldn't go as far as to say fine, but maybe a little bit of tweaking to his kit and it would be perfect
---
The game is really diverse.
---
Oh yeah no doubt about that. I just just curious about the Hispanic thing
---
Do people know when you are running devour hope? Or do they only know from getting downed after 3 tokens?
---
THE FIRST THING I DO IF I GET SPOTTED GOING FOR A SAVE IS 180 AND TRY TO LEAD THE KILLER AS FAR AWAY FROM THE HOOK AS POSSIBLE. I REALLY DON'T GET WHY OTHERS CAN'T DO THAT, IT'S NOT HARD
---
very cute and well done, but I feel like "will you Dance With Me at prom?" would have been a more cheerful way to ask.  ruining your day sounds a bit gloomy.  but you said he's a killer main so maybe he would prefer this!
---
Appearing in front of them at the gate as Spirit, only to see them teabagging. 
---
Oh, and noed.
---
Bill is soldier. All he needs to do is wrestle the knife out of Frank's hand.
---
and this is what i mean strait to the 4k meme egc turns the game into defending the gates ether the one you opened (which is kind of a bad idea) or the one people actually try closing the hatch and playing kill the person(s) trying to open the gates but with the key there exits a perfect answer that invalidates all of it if i find someone on the hatch i have to just know they've got a key or if you hit them they (possibly more than one) get away and there is no counter if there's more than one person what stops one from going to hatch and one from going to door what r u supposed to do there. nothing you do nothing you try for the one on the door hatch opens and they run back. like really you don't see any problem with the hole egc just having a perfect answer. hell they could find a key in a box a boom luck strait solves the endgame. this hole thing started with a snarky throw away line answering someones question about keys opening hatches after its closed like wtf i don't even really care but jeez it seems i've hit a nerve
---
It's on in the artwork, but it says broken in the description and it's off in game, sadly.
---
People downvote this guy 😐
---
I think they're sufficiently different. Legion buys himself a ton of time with his power, forcing survivors to waste time mending and saving himself time with sprint + auto-detect.
---
Plague's power actually gives survivors a way to heal *faster* than normal, without any extra mending to do. She also has to spend time walking to and claiming fountains. Not to say she's bad, of course, because "enemies have no mither, or they give you ranged aoe low-cooldown attacks" is pretty strong, but I'd say they're fairly different.
---
I think the meme format has to be that way. Because if it accurately showed the insignificant differences between the bone structures of different races, some people would read *way* too much into it, and then you'd have a whole comments-section saloon brawl.
---
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d8UyCMb0Pct72WvhydXQ5m13egLjYq29)
---
They shouldn't slow the game down. Just do a better job as a killer.
---
"Impetuous"? For using a perk or trying to Kobe when literally everyone else is perked? What else is she supposed to do, waste both their time not attempting to kobe?
---
The main issue that needs to be fixed is the dev team :^)
---
I know how it feels but this game has a lot of facecampers and there is nothing you can do if they are camping do the gens and escape and if you see that your team is not doing the gens when you are being facecamped just kill yourself on the hook and go to another match and block the dude. Seriously if you are gonna be mad for camping you gonna have a bad time on this game its sad but the devs don't know yet how to solve the facecamp problem but a believe they always are trying their best. And facecamp ends in rank 5 or higher and sometimes there rank one killer that camp too because they get mad for i don't some reason and good luck on the fog...
---
I rarely get against players who get upset at tbagging. Usually they find it funny too. The ones who don't find it funny are just soft and get mad if you tbag. It's like people playing a sniper who get mad when you tactical crouch to avoid getting shot at because they find it upsetting then report you
---
it wasn't a good nerf, but there was a reason though
---
Nurse only breaks pallet looping. That's one mechanic of the game. She doesn't do so well against stealth, but too many high ranking survivors want to win by spamming loops with tank builds instead of diversifying their skill set, so when a killer comes along that breaks or punishes looping, they cry foul. 
---
Look at Plague for example. Looping her for a long time gets you injured without her touching you, and if too many on the team do it, she can upgrade her power to corrupt purge and down you even easier. So it's therefore best to avoid being found to begin with. But I've seen survivors get pissy about her because she's anti-looping. Their loop abuse won't work, so they reeeeeeeeeeeee
---
True, they thought the change was necessary. The community disagrees though. The issue I have is they thought it was okay to weaken her without buffing another area of her kit as compensation.
---
Well that's a relief haha. I was thinking the rework would make it harder. Thanks!
---
If she waited or faked or a small bit, the killer would have been in the cooldown or hit animation. Yes, it was still RNG. There was distance between them, though, so she was able to see him revving. if Billy was closer, then there was no way to stop it. If she waited too long, he could have M1’ed. Just bad timing.
---
Accuracy now does something, whenever you blink, you are more likely to appear in front of a random survivor on the map.
---
This could result in worse pings than before for us if we have to connect to Asia
---
It doesn't take 3 minutes to save a teammate or two, they would die from the first hook state before that. The current timer is just too long to do anything of meaning, it needs to pressure survivors deciding to stay after end-game starts. Sometimes that teammate is dead, just gotta accept it.
---
IT'S OK. I'M JUST FARMING YOU.
---
Yah I just stopped fast vaulting that specific window after getting killed by this bug twice.... As a killer I would pause, but 99.99999999% of other players gobble up exploits like the entity gobbles earwax.....
---
Yeah I agree. It helps looping too since you can see the light.
---
I'm glad you punished facecamper but dude that was a thorough waste of the God pallet.  Block off that window first man.  Loop it.
---
IT'S BECAUSE CONSOLE PEASANTS AREN'T AWARE OF BETTER ALTERNATIVES.
---
They only KNOW if they get downed after 3 tokens, but most people take a chance and cleanse it anyways. That’s why I run devour &amp; haunted ground. 😂
---
Hypothetical scenario: Would it be possible to leave console Nurse unchanged while nerfing PC Nurse? Because you're right, they're two entirely different ballparks and it'd just be wrong to make her worse on console... yet it'd promote inconsistency and, as far as I know, it has no precedent in basically any other game.
---
for the person that thought this would be a good horror experience, F
---
Wraith is there btw, he's just hiding
---
BEING SELFISH IS PROFITABLE.
---
Not true, they said it on stream a few devstreams ago; they're completely aware that both Nurse and Billy need to be nerfed, but too many people, and too many popular players play them almost exclusively. They basically said theycan't risk the backlash of hurting their fragile egos when they can't 4k every match by using broken killers.
---
That said, none of that excuses dumpstering fun, mid-tier killers and furthering the divide between the top tier and the bottom tier with very little inbetween.
---
i do like that she now has in-built whispers, but piggy with no endgame is no piggy
---
#PrayForAmanda
---
This. Survivors complain about these killer buffs because they've been so used to being the power role in a game that dictates that they should never have been so in the first place.
---
EXTRMELY TRASH CAN'T EVEN USE HIS POWER
---
A properly balanced game goes about something like this Skill-&gt; Should  =-&gt; Total output. The nurse is the most difficult and skillful killer in the entire game. Thus she should be rewarded for the skill it takes to use her properly. I'm sorry you don't like the fact she isn't man with machete maybe learn to juke ,break los and hide from her. You can't loop nurse, your not supposed to your supposed to evade her.
---
#IRON MAN AND BLACK WIDOW DIE BUT EVERYONE ELSE IS RESURRECTED
---
Does it matter?
---
Lol all good, recognizing it already makes you better than most of my teamates.  Either way good job punishing the babykiller
---
Please please please do the Empress as Jane Romero!
---
Wow
---
Yes, Nurse doesn't have anything to 'counter' stealth, but stealth doesn't get shit done.
---
She skips over all the mechanics of chasing that are designed to give survivors a chance. Pallets and windows are the two features which put a barrier between the killer and survivor for breathing room and she skips over both of them. It's very similar to Huntress, except she has limited charges where Nurse does not.
---
You CAN hide, but you can't expect a full team to hide, do it flawlessly, and still get gens done. Once one person is found, BBQ is in play, alongside countless other detection perks. Hiding is not infallible.
---
If it were as simple as "hiding from the killer lets you win" then survivors would never die because barely any killers have much more of a means of detection than Nurse does.
---
The game is based around chasing more than anything, and a killer who takes all of the survivors' chase tools and negates them is inherently broken.
---
Survivor has to be Shaq
---
Remove playing with friends and nerf more killers? That's an excellent way to reduce the player base down to a point that kills off the game.
---
&gt;I am interested to see why they would get it.
---
Against average red rank survivors, they don't really know how to loop. But let's grant that 3/4 can use the map efficiently and would rather take downs than waste certain "tie together" god pallets towards the center of map.
---
Like hyper efficient.
---
I think it's still possible to consistently lay on pressure if you're a god tier killer who knows exactly how to run tiles and read minds.
---
So... just go super stealth mode and don't get into chases ever? Unreasonable.
---
Joey's and Dirt ftw!
---
That’s what I said when Captain America went back on his word and passed on the shield.
---
Most is still wrong.  None of us killers think it's a good idea except for those that do it.
---
speed limiter or gtfo /s
---
Fuck you
---
That especially proves this whole thing is just a survivor buff, since EGC doesn't start til gates are open anyway.
---
You've been lucky. In one game the last 2 survivors were running calm spirit + urban evasion and crouched around the entire map ignoring the remaining gens (2 left). Took me 25 minutes to find them and they ended up bitching at me afterwards.
---
NOED gamers don't get to complain about perks...pot meet kettle, kettle meet pot.
---
Found the arsehole that likes ruining things for people who look forward to films
---
Classic Legion, embracing being a survivor now.
---
At high levels of play stealth goes out the fucking window
---
No killer worth their salt is playing without sounds blasted and game filters on to make the game not look like a dark soup of blackness.
---
Just a bit
---
Not nerfed, but fixed. I played nurse and i got a grab from the other side of a gen. FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF A FUCKING GEN
---
Pretty much this; I still don't have teachable Ruin so I have NOED to slow down the game, but BBQ/Distressing/Unnerving Presence/NOED-Ruin eventually.
---
Where’d you find that joke format?
---
Think about the EGC, you'll know why they made the traps that way.  
---
The terror radius change? WACK
---
"most difficult" yeah for your first like 3 games with her
---
Looping isn't hard at all on console.  PS4 analog is great for hugging corners while using other to rotate camera midchase.
---
Well this isn’t normally how I play. He just got a special treatment because of how he was playing
---
IM SO SICK OF USING AN OFFERING TO KEEP MY ITEMS AND ADD-ONS IN THE EVENT THAT I DIE AND LOSING THEM ANYWAY.  FUUUUUUUUU

No shade man, it was good 🙌🏻

Weren't these designed to put pressure on survivors? Freezing the time is pig sabotaging herself

They never said that mechanic was going to be the EGC. And slowing the game down when all gens are on and one gate is open doesn‘t really work, so what did you expect?
---
They aren't offended. But we all know you're a fucking dickhead that's for sure.
---
Distortion user can’t relate
---
This. At least one person with some brains on this sub, thank you for existing.
---
Mods?
---
Im glad you two hit that great skillcheck :) Its nice to see a wholesome post like this. Hope you enjoy your evening!
---
Literally a piece of fucking shit
---
He knows it’s peanut butter jelly time.
---
Imagine the dance rapidly increasing in pace because someone destroyed the totem
---
I dont get your point. You attempting humor?
---
**Amanda**: The survivors have opened the exit gates.
---
**Entity**: Congratulations survivors. You're free to go within three minutes.
---
**Amanda**: Yeah, but not all of them have their traps off.
---
**Entity**: Deactivate their traps, Amanda, and let them go.
---
**Amanda**: No, their traps should still be ticking. They can't just walk out.
---
**Entity**: Amanda, survivors are worth more than you know. Deactivate their traps and let them go.
---
**Amanda**: I said no.
---
**Entity**: Amanda, there are rules!
---
**Amanda**: I said NO! They don't deserve to go free!
---
**Survivors**: You have to now.
---
**Amanda**: I don't have to do shit.
---
**Entity**: Amanda, even with that blade, it is the survivors who hold your game in their hands.
---
**Amanda**: Fuck you. You gave them control over me?! FUCK YOU!

---
Yeah but how does the devs tell? I know that if you quit the game through task manager they can’t see whether you DC’ed or quit, can they tell if you leave normally?
---
Isn’t BHVR known for not doing everything to a killer or perk all at once. Maybe they will buff another area. In my mind, I can see them doing this to see how it works out without a buff. Better to need to add a buff than to need to renerf due to an accidental game breaking buff. At the end of the day no matter what they do the community will find something to be upset about. 
---
Would you rather have the community crying for a buff that you’ll think about and potentially get to if needed, or have the community crying for a nerf because the buff you applied made it way worse, but said nerf may take time to get right. 
---
In my eyes it’s better to have a nerfed down killer/perk than to have an overpowered game breaking killer/perk. Look at Freddy, people have found a way to play him despite how bad he is. Now imagine a killer that ended up being way overpowered. Everyone would play said killer till people quit playing because it broke the game and they either wait till it’s fixed or quit playing altogether. A nerfed killer/perk can be set aside and more time and thought can be put into the buff as it’s not game breaking, people may stop playing the killer till buffed but that’s better than everyone playing one killer due to a game breaking buff. A game breaking nerf just means it’s not viable atm. 
---
Am I wrong for thinking this way. I would honestly prefer a buff needing to be added rather than nerf after nerf.
---
(Whack)
---
“...Well that was anticlimactic.”
---
Me and my friend were talking about this and he sees it as the rewards for survivor are already pretty low even when you do okay so normally if you're first to be found or felt like you've been tunneled to not get anything done for yourself you don't gain any decent amount of BP so you might as well leave and take your chances of getting a higher amount next game where you might not be instantly downed.
---
Apparently. I just don't see it. She's Latin America. I want someone 100% but that'll do for now
---
No, just helping you point out the worst part of playing killer, that unless you play Billy, Nurse, Trapper you can go get fucked according to BHVR.
---
This guy knows whats up
---
No. They're not soft. And just because you don't personally get upset by it doesn't make it okay.  
---
Being an asshole is toxic. And the fun of the game is the game, not trying to piss other people off.
---
Woah at least i wasn’t trying to hurt anyones feelings
---
I'm anxious when playing survivor
---
No one click the hidden downvoted comment, it’s an Endgame spoiler :(
---
But it would ruin the feel of “collpse” since the concept is that the entity is trying to destroy the whole place alltogether. So if you want to slow the timer, it should be slowed for everyone at the same time. not a bad idea if you take this into consideration
---
Sad because I'm sure it was shitty for the killer to get memed on that hard. But that doesn't make it okay to project the blame on survivors who are doing their job.
---
I have 100 hours and I’m still dog shit sooo. Don’t stress
---
Toxic? No. Should you stop? Only if you don't enjoy what you do.
---
When I say survivor and there would be voicechat you'd hear me say 'oh.....OH...OH NO. That's nasty!' Because that is the moment when I realize how you're doing things and I am solo queue so there is no way of telling my team mates who fix the far away gennies like AI characters

I wouldn't call it a nerf to the pig. It's more like digging a hole 30 feet deep and throwing the pig into it and burying it alive. At least with legion their power has some type of use even if that power is a little bit slower. Being forced to mend has more 'delay the game' potential than traps ever will again since the survivor is forced to do something if they get poked with the mend timer. If they reduce her TR back to where it was before and increase the crouch movement speed then it would probably be ok. Forcing people to crouch walk the maps as the pig when gens are being done just to avoid pausing someone's timer is bullshit. Ever play no blink nurse or bk Myers? Do that shit crouched the entire match and see how far you get in a match.
---
Well they've done a good job so far.
---
They used her to represent the pig because her assets were already in another game. All they had to do was buy the rights to use those assets and port them into this game. 
---
They could have used any number of people from the franchise to represent the pig. It's the exact same reason tapp was put into this game. The assets were already made for another game. There's a huge list of people that would have worked out better for dbd had they decided to include them instead of the 1 guy that died in the only Saw movie he appeared in.
---
I’m in Australia so constant bad ping, nice.
---
"yeah survivors DC like crazy but what about this incredibly situational killer build you'll only see maybe once every tenth game, if that"
---
This is the most accurate shitpost I've ever seen XD
---
Im not saying stay hidden the whole game. Do things like body blocking and flash light saving if its viable. Just dont run around like a dickhead the entire match because you arent really supposed to just jump infront of the killers line of site every 2 seconds.
---
But yeah the emblem system sucks. What ever happened to the classic it all just adds into one category and based on how much you earned, you got a pip.
---
THE FUCKING INFINITE LOADING SCREEN BUG
---
what about they start restraining certain perks for certain killers ? Good nurses wasn't completely unbeatable when bbq wasn't a thing.
---
That's not the problem.
---
The problem is that they made surviving EASIER.
---
Hatch opens no matter gen count.
---
Doors open 25% faster.
---
The timer fucking SLOWS DOWN if you do well as a killer during the EGC.
---
Also lets not forget that pig nerf that completely guts the current Pig trap strategy.
---
You're missing the point of the complaints.
---
yea but we all know that nurse does not really need addon to wreck a team in 3 min. 
---
This change would just make average nurses easier to deal with.
---
u/mistar_z don’t read the comment just delete pls
---
r/UnexpectedYetDelightfulStevenUniverse
---
&gt; Nurse isn't a killer to deal with the new players, she's a killer to deal with the experienced ones
---
really hypocrite. Experienced players who aren't in swf don't break game mechanics and are destroyed by Nurse. 
---
How stupid can you be to want to counter something OP with something as much or even more OP ?
---
Sometimes it’s about making a statement not playing optimally.
---
If I’m being honest, as an overwatch player, I can confirm I’ve had far more toxic experiences in Overwatch than in Dead by Daylight.
---
never liked David but god damn bhvr you know how to trim that mustache properly. wait, is it hot in here? ugh, no, it's just David D:
---
No, nothing is wrong. That is like saying self care should be a base ability because almost all survivors use it.
---
No cost too great
---
I can answer that top search easy 
---
How to be toxic as killer: hit a survivor, your job is to be the one who holds the door open for them 
---
How to be toxic as survivor: do anything to impede the killer from sacrificing you, you should be lining up to be killed
---
A lot of killers I play against are fine with being tbagged. I’ve only been camped or tunneled by 1 or 2 killers for tbagging and only a few others got upset. The rest found it funny or didn’t care. I’ve tbagged people in other games and died afterwards and we’ve had a laugh. Not many get upset over pixels going up and down
---
&gt; No killer worth their salt is playing without sounds blasted and game filters on to make the game not look like a dark soup of blackness.
---
lol ! it's so funny to hear people calling themselves "competitive" when they optimized every single aspect of the game instead of playing the hard way.
---
Voice come, Nurse, Purple addons, filter screen colors etc... what a pity.
---
&gt;Jafari discussed politics on a livestream hosted by Sargon of Akkad on January 27, 2017; on March 12 of the same year, Jafari posted a tweet defending a quote from Iowa representative Steve King, who had tweeted in regards to the United States' policy on immigration: "We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies."[39][40] Jafari defended King's tweet and later appeared on Twitch streamer Destiny's channel to explain his views. During this appearance he said that, "nobody wants to become a minority in their own country", and stressed that he took issue with white people being labeled as racist for wanting to remain a majority.
---
So, standard white supremacy. And your response appears to be standard alt-right diffusion. Yup, dude's a racist. Ironic since he's Iranian. Probably thinks the Nazi thugs would see him as one of " the good ones." Good luck with that.
---
YOU FUCKING DESTROYED MY PIG, YOU PIGS!
---
WGLF: first time?
---
Nah they aren't close enough they literally would be inside you
---
What about Dwight ;(
---
Not gonna lie, it makes me a little upset to visit the forums and see well done constructive criticism posts, but the devs only seem to respond to people saying mostly positive things.
---
PS for rank 20s here who say nurse is OP, block line of sight and she has to predict where you blink, dont run in the open lmfao.
---
Negative.
---
GETTING HIT BY A KILLER WHEN ON MY SCREEN THEY ARE 5 METRES AWAY IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS AND FUCKING INFURIATES ME SO DAMN MUCH! WHEN DO DEDI SERVERS RELEASE SO I CAN SEE IF IT FUCKING FIXES IT????
---
Noed killer omegalul.
---
They hurt muh babeh! =\[
---
Its okay, i have played this game for hours, days actually and i know people have played it much longer but i just pretiged my main survivor to 2, because i leveled up all my killers to 40
---
Every strategy has a name for it that implies that that strategy is unhealthy to the game, so there is actually no strategy in the game that you can use without being flamed.
---
Yes homo
---
Are we blind? Deploy the up-votes!
---
Dude, don't even try to make any arguments with that username...
---
I have pants on, they're just small I guess
---
Juking… getting downed 10 seconds into the match… all the same when a killer camps…
---
#yaasqueen
---
Oh...i never thought about it i use all the kilkers in red ranks.
---
PIG NERFS.
---
EGC MAKING IT EASIER TO ESCAPE FOR NO DAMN REASON.
---
NERFING REMEMBER ME.
---
THATS WHAT EVERYONE IS MAD ABOUT!!
---
The difference between a good Nurse and a bad Nurse is astonishing. I honestly think she's simultaneously the weakest and most powerful killer in the game because of it.
---
Is this some kind Bubba X Hillbilly sickening shit?
---
Yes, I see how it can be a pain for M1 killers. I guess this change will help balance the map abit
---
Lol I get it
---
I don’t think so
---
Isn't the "reduces accuracy" part of the omega blinks just nothing? It would be more balanced if it actually did reduce the accuracy the longer you charged it. Like say at max charge you will end up a good few metres to the left or right of where you wanted to go
---
I mean, some players do play like that. Tbag, flashlight click, jump in front of the killer as you said to get his attention and waste as much of his time as possible and other 3 (rarely now tho) survivors have plenty of time to do gens/totems and it's up to the killer how he handle it. They even have builds around that. 
---
On the other hand, if they get downed, camped, moried or whatever they have no right to complain or DC. Risks come with certain behavior and some actions stated aboge are seen as toxic.
---
Emblem system sucks for both parties sadly.
---
when janes too thicc
---
Frederico would approve of that
---
I HATE PTB 2.7.0. THIS PATCH IS FUCKING BROKEN. 15 SECONDS TO OPEN A GATE , PIG NERFS , LEGION "REWORK" , REMEMBER ME NERF AND SURVIVORS BUFFS
---
If being camped i recommend not trying to unhook and if you get unto stage two then keep tapping X button. Punish the killer by wasting as much of their time as possible for camping you. Bring s'mores.
---
Games are for fun not stress, remember that and you will find much joy in the cat and mouse of it all. 
---
Running around objects is better than running in straight lines when being chased. Play as each killer you have available at least once. The knowledge you gain about how each one works will help you survive.
---
Yeah, but that's more an exploit than an actual playstyle. Endgame pig was a legit playstyle and didn't need nerfing. Hell, it's one of the only effective ways to play her. It even fits her theme. "I want to play a game"
---
If you're getting genrushed, it's your fault. YOU are not keeping up the pressure correctly.
---
Comming from a hag main
---
I know you guys don't live or play games down here, but believe us when we say not including Australian servers is basically removing the game for all Australian and NZ players.
---
Our internet connections to other regions is garbage, and on other games (like dota) where there are options to use SEA or Aus servers, it's a difference of 100s of ping.
---
Over 81% population of Aus, and to a far greater degree NZ, are also on the absolute opposite side of the continent to Singapore as well. It's a greater distance for us to a Singapore server than it is to use the Frankfurt servers from Montreal, and that's before even considering that the cables connecting us to Singapore are crap and unreliable, and that Australian internet infrastructure is already in a poor state with the awful NBN rolling out.
---
Switching to dedicated servers will kill off a lot of the Oceanic players if there isn't an option for us. I even know dedicated DBD streamers that just quit during the matchmaking tests because it wasn't worth spending an hour per match trying to get green or yellow ping when we were being placed with Asian players. My biggest worry is also that if you guys "keep an eye on it" and change your minds later, it'll be too late to recover enough of the playerbase here to keep playing even if we do come back.
---
Somebody is very skilled with the healing stick. May I be on the healing end?
---
HG stands for Hex: Haunted Grounds. So basically this entitled killer used two instant down perks.
---
FUCKING SURVIVORS ESCAPING THEOUGH THE HATCH I SWEAR TO THE ENTITY, I WILL FIND THOSE PEOPLE AND FUCK THEM SHIT UP.
---
Legion hot buffed tho
---
They expected he'd been nerfed to the ground and wanted to humiliate him, and are now surprised he's not as bad as anticipated.
---
Basically if we see a hidden offering i know its a mori. We dont know what type but its a mori. Also i recomend just running green moris if youre so inclined.
---
Those hairy feet on Meg😍
---
Singapore is the closest server to Aus, that's further away than playing on EU servers from the US, with a slower connection that has frequent issues.
---
Saying it's "another nerf to killers" as though that happens a lot is kindof silly. The devs are blatantly killer sided (most updates prove that), they just designed a fundamentally broken game that has a lot of abusable strats that survivors can use that they honestly can't take away without completely ruining any chance of survivors, well, surviving.
---
Same here. I get that it's more fun and simple to respond to people saying "You did a good job" rather than responding to someone saying "Y'all messed up" but they should stop being so biased towards one side of the community. It's frustrating to see how stubborn they are and how they don't want to budge from their original plan. If they at least explained why they refuse to implement some changes like having the EGC timer slow down/stop when a survivor is in a RBT instead of making the RBT useless in the end game, it would be less infuriating to interact with the devs but it feels like we're speaking to a brick wall. They received our feedback about the PTB, it'd be nice if we could hear from them before the PTB ends.
---
I remember...
---
Hatch spawning at round-start. Survivor with a key could open it with 5 gens left. Where did they go achievement could have been done with a 4-man SWF with one key ignoring gens.
---
Infinites were MUCH more of thing. No window blocker, no bloodlust, and I think there was "Vault Vacuum" of sorts.
---
Pallets were higher in number and much more annoying. I vividly remember people healing at each pallet while you break them so they could heal during the chase. Also pallet vacuum. You practically got a speed boost during a chase by dropping a pallet. 
---
Killer couldn't kick gens. Gens didn't all power up once gates were powered so a survivor could stay back and do the extra gens for bloodpoints. Gens at 99% made no noise and didn't show up as auras so survivors would 99 them all and pop them one after another.
---
Only killer was the Trapper, everyone was super excited for Hilbilly and Wraith.
---
Mori's didn't require hooking. BNP instantly powered a gen.
---
Maps were MUCH darker and the lighting much more atmospheric and spooky. I understand why it was changed (optimization) but I miss it. (made immersive stealth much more viable) Eventually moonlight offerings were removed too.
---
Instablinds being a thing. 
---
Spies from the shadows being meta.
---
Hooks and bear traps not respawning when destroyed. You could have a sabojake squad running no mither, use the less hooks offering (When they reduced number of hooks and not distance) and sabo every hook, leaving the killer unable to do jack shit but use basement hooks and can't even slug. 
---
Decisive not even requiring you to be obsession and 4-man SWF would run it. When it was an obsession perk but before Killer's had insta-mori taken away a killer would often bring a mori and mori the obsession to prevent them from using DS.
---
Lightborn making your screen darker. 
---
This game changed alot since when I played the open beta.
---
Don't do it. You'll get a 1day ban. Even for only 1 game.
---
When they do roll out the servers, they need to make it official that Aussies get the Oceania servers or the game will be very dead on the killer side on both PC, Xbox, and PS4.
---
Dude, I only lasted 2 hrs on the PTB before reverting back to the live version because of this exact reason
---
My experience on the PTB:
---
-Survivor game, get pitted against Survivors who were goofing off instead of doing the objective to see endgame. Killer obviously was testing the new Pig changes and Legion changes. Games end up with Survivors constantly DCing or self killing on hook. Get queued with Rank 20's that seem to be baby killers that are completely clueless
---
-Rinse &amp; repeat several times
---
-Get fed up and play Killer
---
-Same exact shit on Killer side
---
-Switch back to the live version
---
It’s pretty much guaranteed to be a mori like the only real question is what kind of mori it is. I’ll put it this way, I don’t even remember what the other secret offering is because I only see moris
---
End game pig was an exploit, plain and simple. Cheese strats of pigs holding their traps till the end.
---
I did and I don't see a problem there. enlighten me
---
Wow 3 likes I did it
---
Tbh you never see nurse on console anyway - 1/50 rounds I would guess, or fewer - she needs a buff on console!
---
Wait no 4 likes
---
Wait no now its 5
---
Half of what you said makes no sense bud. Skill  and should equals total output??? OKAY sureeee.  I know my nurse jukes. Dont flip this on me and make it an anecdotal summation of my lack of skill or some bullshit like that. My skill has 0 to do with my argument. The fact you want your entire argument to revolve around skill is alsoa joke. Idc how hard nurse is to play(shes really not) difficultly!= balance. Ive played fighting games competitively my whole life. This argument is ild as shit and was defeated really early on. If it tkaes a 1000 hours to be a good nurse, it doesnt give her the right to break the game. Idgaf if it took 10,000 hours of practice. At peak level shes busted. Period.
---
Reread what you said, again, except this time read it slower and maybe say it out loud.
---
Neat handwriting
---
He may have been smacking people on the hook but it just means he's a rank 14 with a lv1 legion. Guy just wanted to try him out before the nerf and gets steamrolled by purple flashlights with irridescent addons. I kind of feel bad for him.
---
I second this. What is it with this game that makes everyone (killer and survivors) think they somehow deserve to win/pip every round?
---
If you are a high rank killer, you will still get shit from time to time and even rank one doesn't mean that you're invincible.
---
Now this is a logical change.
---
Jeff is busy being face-camped, would you like to leave a message?
---
I did again. It's still true. Not keeping up the pressure correctly makes gens pop. it's not "getting genrushed", what else should those people do? crouch in the corner of the map?
---
Send the killers to the ranch!
---
Alright buddy, whatever you say lmao
---
First of all, the update is going to make Legion a more balanced killer. Second, if he was trying Legion out, why facecamp and not even bother to use his power? I don’t feel bad for him at all, players like that make the game unfun for everyone. I was just giving him a taste of his own medicine
---
He wont give chase lol
---
For these people its not a meme though.
---
so, will you enlighten me?
---
Man, that's a pretty spicy legion meat-a-ball!
---
Nipple
---
But you can stay in front of the killer and run them the entire match depending on the killer and your team
---
Nah it's too late at night to have a circular argument. My head is already sore from beating my head against the wall with the guy who said the Pig changes were good.
---
Bevahiour... K den
---
quick and quiet, self care, and the 4th isnt really important but something like empathy or mettle of man. Quick and quiet works really well with head on. Ill be mid chase and fast vault in the locker and the killer will scratch their head. Many many many times, has it bought me the 3 seconds to stun them when they figure it out. Or lose them completely. This is against red rank killers. They expect to hear a locker noise or they dont so they dont think its possible you pulled a bamboozle on them.
---
Oh lmao I am on ps4 I'll pop a msg if I see you xD
---
the 0 addons part is to establish dominance
---
if they rescue someone in the basement and you're nearby they have no chance no matter what you use, so why waste stuff
---
Me: Heheh this has a nsfw tag time to see a dongle or maybe a boober :^)

This pic just gave me a thought, what if dead hard was a stun instead of an attack dodge?
---
its not a bug, its just the way it had to be designed. If the stun happened even before u left the locker then it wouldnt make sense. If the stun window happened after you left the locker then it would be a whole argument of well you need the 3 seconds + the animation of leaving. or many other things people would complain about
---
Darn. I really wanted a Bloody Valentine's dlc
---
Lmao beautiful work man
---
Do you even play killer or do you just ramble incoherently on this subreddit?
---
Hopefully prom will be before the endgame goes live otherwise the post prom sex will last a maximum of 3 minutes :(
---
I remember this time
---
This. So much this.
---
If you are not im control as killer, it’s on you.
---
How does dcing help?
---
You just murdered that man
---
Okay "buddy." (Nice pathetic attempts to troll, btw, really just invalidates your whole argument.) But you want to have this pointless argument? Let's do it. We'll do this properly, I make a statement,  then you make a counter statement, then me etc. I'll go first: 
---
The Killer is not in control of getting truly gen rushed.
---
Okay, if you're going to use the 'quote' feature, use actual quotes, instead of saying what you want me to say. I never implied what you think, and I didn't imply hag had 0 counterplay, I SAID she has 0 counterplay, when used in a certain manner. (Trapping any loop you chase to). Like legion, that takes more time.
---
I think the more logical change would've been to have the beartraps slow the collapse down like a hooked/dying status would.
---
This and the comments are so fucking funny
---
Alternative title: "So this is why the gens weren't getting done."
---
Omg after all that you're gonna start a real conversation? Wow dude
---
I actually think both sides have points so I'd even agree with some of the things you probably have to say, I only joined in to tell you that you sounded like a douche cause you weren't clearing yourself up to the guy who was asking nicely so you were the one trolling. You're also the one that started the "buddy" so nice try with that too. Maybe have a normal conversation right off the bat instead of being a tool cause I dont care to talk to you anymore. You can keep your thoughts that I'm sure are highly intelligent coming from someone like you.
---
Used the beads on spirit vs swf. Had rancor and two survivors left while last gen popped. One dude got out asap, but the obsession didn't wanna leave. Spotted him with whisper and hit his ass. Afterwards got a message and he was mad that his friend told him I didn't use the beads and he'd be safe haha.
---
Alright, so you waste my time then pussy out. No surprise, the idiots normally do that. Have a good one.
---
\&gt;he doesn't understand internet culture
---
Anyways you have no point because Hag does have genuine ways to play around her. Current Legion doesn't. It doesn't matter if it's moonwalking or just spamming the frenzy over and over again, it's stupid, unfun, unhealthy and does not deserve to exist in the game, the new Legion is far superior in every single aspect.
---
No sense of humor around here...
---
They wont nerf her, 1/3 of the consistent red ranks killers would leave the game.
---
r/cursedimages
---
What does that screenshot have to do with anything?
---
People that can't play killer keep whining about gens getting done. It's how it's always been and always will be.
---
What’re trying to say about console?
---
Lmfao I waste your time? Buddy what do you want me to say if I see both sides of it? Is it not the killers fault for not pressuring enough sometimes? Other times yes the survivors are good and there's not much you can do. My point is you could've cleared yourself up in the first place instead of setting up the big run around you just did literally just to try to talk anyway. I'm sure you can agree you sounded like a tool and if you don't think you did then I dont know what to tell you but it definitely was a dick move to act like that and not back it up to the guy.
---
But it’s not fair unless survivors can’t move and killers get 4K every time! Don’t you get it!!?!?! This game is so in favor of survivors. Uugghhh. 
---
/s of course. 
---
You’re getting downvoted is ridiculous. Give me mine too tho I guess.
---
All my post supports is telling people to voice their opinion. If you go on the DBD forums right now almost all the feedback is massive posts discussing the balance of certain changes. Reddit might be full of screaming people but the actual feedback section on the DBD forums tells a different story.

Salty babies thinking they're right about everything

EVERYONE ON THE FUCKING SUBREDDIT WHO AGREES THAT THE PIG SHOULDN'T BE NERFED BUT STILL DC'S WHEN THE GET DOWNED THE FIRST GODDAMNED TIME EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE SOME DICKHEAD SWF WHO ALL RUN D-STRIKE, BORROWED TIME, METTLE OF MAN, AND FUCKING BALANCED LANDING WHILE FLASHLIGHTING AT EVER SINGLE GOD FORSAKEN PALLET WHILE MY PIG PLAYING ASS IS OUT HERE TRYNA LEVEL PIG WITH ONLY SLOPPY COCKSUCKING BUTCHER AND DEERSTALKER.

Everyone who plays this is an asshole at some point. Jesus has never played dbd.  But if you 4K you gotta expect trash talk post game, because it’s the internet. Don’t dwell on it, if you have a good game hit them with the gg. If they talk shit hit em with the ole EZ and peace out.

I find it weird that his eyes are blue-ish grey.  The blue is even more pronounced when he is on the hook and moonlight shines on his face. That's kind of unusual.  But then again David's eyes is kind of red-ish.

&gt;It's not a cheese strat at all. It only works if the survivors are too potato to make skill checks. And besides "No other killer makes you do an objective before leaving the gate after all gens done." Who's fucking upset about some diversity? She's a killer that slows the game down without having to absolutely having to run Ruin or NOED, we should be singing her fucking praises for adding variety instead of just playing Nurse or Hillbilly
---
Yet you only see 1 pig in every 30 games. The EGC changes would've created an unintended buff to cheese end game builds on Pig. Period, end of story.

I turned mine off for a while. I was just starting and getting nothing but salty messages. I turned it back on and at first the salty messages out ranked good helpful ones I was getting but the better I get at the game the less salt I get.

Can you make a normal/logical argument that the Pig would need any nerf?

I dont understand it either lol if someone tbags me i just play along and nod they are just having fun. You guys are too sensitive just play the game lmao

Frenzy sucks you use if you aren't used to legion. I personally lose line of sight so much if I use frenzy and get few hits in.
---
[no?](http://imgur.com/50o57na)
---
I agree with you here because i spend half my time with perks like premonition and small game and unless I’m super in the zone i spend my time looking at the perk icon for when its CD is activated rather than keeping an ear out. 
---
But to be fair did you check for perks that couldve impacted the use of stridor or your ability to hear gens? Things like technician or iron will and the like all reduce sounds the survivors make  either by volume or frequency and would thus nullify a perk like stridor. 
---
I trust your judgement but as it wasn’t included in your argument i wanted a clarification.
---
Dude I didn't assume shit, all i said was their is counter-play your deliberately ignoring. Also your background in fighting games doesn't mean shit, for one its a completely different genre, and two this is an asymmetrical horror survival game. Your not SUPPOSED to be on even footing with a killer thats why there are 4 survivors, strength in numbers friend. Final point I'd concede nurse may be slightly over-tuned but there are allot more pressing issues with the game then nerfing one of the ONLY killer viable at "PEAK LEVEL"
---
You want a nurse nerf? Fine go ahead and figure out a way to stop people from grouping up and using comms in a game design'd from the ground up to be played entirely without them, then you can have your nurse nerf, till then she's JUST FINE.
---
&gt; It's not that you are a bad killer overall if you lose a game, but you have made a lot of bad plays/mistakes in that particular match if you let all of the gens get powered with 4/3 survivors still alive.
---
dont agree with that. sure its a difference if you're a bad or a good killer, but ultimately its up to the survivors to decide how the game goes. when everyone runs 4 second chance perks and does few mistakes, you cant do anything as a killer (that isnt something like nurse or billy)
---
I use it with the intention of getting a quick first hit but I always lose people with him. Hes just not that great as it is unless the legion is super good at keeping up with people without his cool down getting in the way.
---
I like it! Hope you consider doing more!
---
Lmao lots of wasted time there just like you were trying to avoid buddy. You're way more up for conversation  than you acted, so do you have no point to the original topic or do you only like conversations that make you look like an asshole?
---
Too busy ruining fun
---
I’ve played the game plenty of times without the audio but I wouldn’t say it was any easier. I have a friend who is partly deaf and he plays the game and he is arguably better than me.
---
Hey listen man, I'm sure you have a big dick and all, but I already tried that route with you and you decided you didn't care enough. So please don't come back 30 minutes later starting shit. I have moved on and am working atm and I think you should move on too.
---
Once they come up with a way to prevent nurse from autoattacking into walls, I'll be fine with some tweaks to addons.
---
Decent nurses will only use brown addons to reduce fatigue or shorten blink times.  It completely throws off the rhythm if you stack on a bunch of items that cancel extend ranges and reduce blink window time and etc etc.
---
Don't play Wraith for your first killer. Learn another killer such as Trapper, because Wraith's special ability is to be able to go 90% invisible, and when you're invisible you have no terror radius/heartbeat for the survivors, therefore you'll get used to this more than actually having a terror radius with every other killer.
---
Ok man sounds good. Must be really busy at work mentioning you've had this conversation all night instead of proving your point. Sorry I had to call you out for clearly acting like a tool.
---
Okay buddy. Have a good night.

Ok buddy I will. Hope your head starts feeling better so you start making sense :)
---
There have been countless tests run by experienced survivors that prove SWF is broken for you to come and just say it’s just “players goofing around”. And even without those tests, it’s pretty easy to realize that a gamemode where 4 players can have the ability of communicate and give info that only perks should give is pretty broken.
---
I definitely agree with you about his addons and the general philosophy of how they should work. Some killer addons should really be reworked or replaced. I main Spirit and even I think her beads are broken as fuck. It turns her into the most overpowered killer with one addon. I'd prefer a change of playstyle over being that OP.
---
  
---
I think one of the best examples of a great addon is scratched mirror myers. It changed the way you play and it's fun to play and fun to go against. Admittedly I've lost every single time I've gone against one but it still felt like it had counterplay and it was fun to go against. Going against an insta-saw Billy is not the same. His addons never make him feel different to go against, just more difficult. I do think that Billy has counterplay unlike nurse though.

Don't confuse high skill gap with game balance. Nurse is definitely in need of nerfs.

Dbd in a nutshell
---
Yeah, but even a 2 blink nurse is really powerfull
---
It's The Passing, where the finale ends with a generator breaking down and one of the players (canonically Bill) has to sacrifice themselves to get it back up and running so the others can escape.
---
Seems like a joke but honestly turn off your mind. I somehow managed to kill everyone as nurse when I was trying to get daily bloodpoint rewards although to be honest with you I played dirty by proxy camping
---
if u dont know why ruin is meta, then sry, but to persist in those ranks its something u have to learn. yes, swf-survivors have an advantage against the killer, but gen rushing is pretty normal in this game. the game in fact is about how fast the killer can get the things under his control, and ruin is a very powerful tool for this. and yes, those swf survivor groups can be very annoying to play against, but in the moment you finally understand what to do against them, it feels like u get rewarded for all those games lost.
---
Fair play thanks mate. Ive not played killer since reset so I'm down to like 14 so might have a day playing her and see how it goes. 
---
I won't camp though as that gets boring as hell for me haha.
---
Read Patch Notes
---
Im sorry to tell you but the game isnt balanced around your understanding of fun. Also I dont see how that change would in any way reduce the fun factor of the pig. She still playes the exact same. And also getting with any killer to rank 1 is no chalange. Grinding your way up to rank 1 proofes nothing bejond you joining a game
---
Fuck off.
---
He might of been over-nerfed but there was a reason for it.
---
where tf do i get that back pack though?
---
They wont patch it on the game on this mid chapter patch, and the data centers used are only for test during this ptb.
---
It seems that you are the braindead here.
---
I Wonder how many karma this guy is gonna have left
---
shes far from beeing low tier. It seems that you just dont know how to play her
---
nice you made yourself known on the internet as a piece of shit. hope your happy my dude
---
I know MOST of them just tweak your speed or cooldowns a bit (same as they did originally, but with different numbers!) but the ones that had big changes, were the pins
---
Iridescent button now makes your terror radius effect the whole map when in frenzy (you don't have to apply Deep Wound) 
---
The Legion Pin (rare add-on) now makes it so hitting a survivor with the Deep Wound status effect while in Frenzy applies the Broken status effect for 60 seconds
---
Defaced Smiley Pin (uncommom add-on) now makes it so hitting a survivor with the Deep Wound status effect while in Frenzy applies the Mangled status effect for 60 seconds
---
Smiley Pin (common add-on) now makes it so hitting a survivor with the Deep Wound status effect while in Frenzy applies the Blindness status effect for 60 seconds
---
Man, I hadent played for a month but i kept reading this on reddit.
---
Had my first game in a while today and literally the first two people i downed disconnected.

lol @ this thread
---
The more interesting question is on how many subs he will be left unbanned.
---
It might be because i'm Australian and we don't have Prom culture, but... why wouldn't your boyfriend go to the prom with you?
---
That can be said for a lot of other bugs too.
---
i like how his excuse about spoiling is "weLL iTs tHE INTeRnET stOP GEttinG oFFenD aHaH" what an asshole
---
Ahh great advice mate thank you. My main problem is frustration to be honest. I can hit blinks just not consistently. I'll land 3-4 a game but the fatigue drives me insane!! Haha. 
---
Shadowborn is a great tip I'll see if I've got that in a few minutes I also didn't no you could charge your blinks while moving. So that's going to be very helpful. 
---
My build so far for the nurse is. Nurses, BBQ, ruin and NOED (NOED is only because I'm so bad with her haha)
---
Amazing use of John’s audio tape
---
Suit yourself, I'm getting Dead Hard
---
Yes! I've seen the skin, but neon collors are not for me. I'll stick with Susie.
---
Spirit is fun. Not being able to see survivors isn't bad because you can see the scratch marks still when they run. If you know or think a survivor is somewhere, you can phase to them and force them to either run and you follow scratches or hide and they'll be nearby still. Since you leave behind a husk, just standing still pretending to start your phase walk can make survivors do dumb things sometimes
---
1 million bps is actually not even that much. clearly you can't count
---
Yeh but like aren't they more super heroes and stuff and not really horror genre defining characters from classic films?
---
That one's interesting. Would leave her with good map pressure, but not so insane chase potential. Everyone who's played 1 blink nurse for a while knows that it's still strong but way less devastating. The devs should think about this one for sure.
---
Yeah man the devs are so killer sided they literally just introduced a perk that effectively neuters over half the killers in the game. Give me a fucking break.
---
Just because the survivor side got some much needed nerfs (removing pallet vacuum, exhaustion nerfs, decisive strike rework, etc) which improved the killer experience does not mean that BHVR favor killers. The game flow is still heavily dictated by survivors and the clock is ALWAYS working against the killers.
---
Yeah, tell him he still owes me bloodpoints for that beer.
---
Yeah whoopsie. 
---
Deadass I don’t play a shitload of dbd so  a lot of stuff goes right over my head or i just dont know the fine inner workings well enough to talk about things like this.
---
I've given up on ptb when I saw how try hard a lot of people are
---
Went up against only 1 legion and no pig
---
Every other killer would just camp and not test out the collapse(which is the only new thing for any other killer other than end game perks)
---
Survivors who have keys skipping end game with
---
I just don't get it, there is literally 3-4 new things in the ptb, collapse/end game perks ,legion changes, pig changes
---
Why aren't people testing those when on the test server???
---
Death is not an escape.
---
The traps arent meant to kill but to slow down. So the heartbeat nerf is irrelevant. And if you think about it you can force the person to activate their RBT. You can just wait by the hatch till they activate a gen and then close it. But coming up with strategys would be too much to ask for?
---
&gt;But in the end game the situation where a survivor manages to get away off hook just doesn't happen especially if it is already a decent amount of time into end game. In what situation will a survivor get off hook with the killer a reasonable distance away when the exits are already open and there are still pallets on the map to evade the killer. Any killer that tunnels will generally give no hope of escaping unless the survivor is like right next to the exit. 
---
You'd be suprised how bad some players are. I've seen people get out alive vs a tunneling killer on many occasions.
---
&gt; since survivors would need to spend a set amount of time at these boxes now
---
And they have to spend a set amount at the box too, currently. I know camping boxes would still be a thing, we can never fully remove it. But this change would be a considerable buff to Pig, as she'd no longer be gated by RNG.
---
&gt;since while pig looks for the hatch the survivor can go find jigsaw boxes to look for the key.
---
Which option is better:
---
- looking through multiple boxes, giving her a huge headstart looking for hatch that she can just camp after you get your hat off
---
- looking for hatch so you can just escape with the hat on
---
Ok that's funny but can we stop and appreciate how well drawn the normal skulls are? Like, damn.
---
WHY ARE YOU NOT SHOUTING! CAN YOU NOT READ THE RULES! THAT'S IT I'M GONNA D/C YOU ARE NOT PLAYING FAIR!
---
&gt; you know that with bloodlust mechanic all killers will eventually catch you if they commit to the chase and there is not much that you can do about it?
---
And bloodlust should also be removed from the game, but no, even this isn't true. You can force people to kick pallets.
---
It's not about how long it takes to down people in a chase, that shouldn't be the deciding factor on whether or not a killer is broken. The fact that it took him a while to down people doesn't matter. He still took every single gameplay mechanic in the game and made it irrelevant. Much like Nurse.
---
Not having to play the game should be the deciding factor that pre-patch Legion is completely fucking broken fundamentally, and I don't know why people don't want to see that.
---
Numeric changes don't fix a mechanical problem.
---
That would just make people angry. Some people spend days to get all perks and one they they log in and their are gone. People would be more angry with that then with legion being legion and pig need combined.
---
It's all according to plan.
---
It's hard to take any advice seriously when you say you camped to get kills. Honesty is there at least but still, if you have to resort to camping to get any kills then you're not good.
---
Why is Billy broken ? He is a strong killer, but he still can be looped like any other killer. He doesn't break game mechanics as Nurse. So I don't see a reason from soneone to call him broken.
---
And if talk about Instant Saw add-ons, McLean said already that they will nerf these add-ons.
---
Make your choice could be cool. Nurse is the only player I use NOED for.
---
I still don't have the adept trophy so what I'll do is practice for a few games and then maybe move and try adept her. I've got nothing at all planned for today so I'll probably spend the day playing her. 
---
The last time I done this was a couple of months ago with hillbilly and now I'm ok with him I don't really main a certain killer now I just have fun and go to use someone else haha.
---
its unnecessary to nerf something that never was that strong on a killer that wasn't that strong either.
---
legion on the other hand.. they had to change him, but imo people overreacted on that
---
What are you talking about killer biased? If anything I've noticed its survivor biased. Killers get away with way less here than I've seen in other places.
---
You're both being absolute children.
---
Having a high skill high reward character (compared to the rest of the characters) in a multi-player game is such a mistake sometimes. I mean, on one hand it's so satisfying to do well with the character, but on the other you get people who don't play that character cause they don't like it's design and they lose a lot because of it, or it has an unfair advantage.
---
I don't believe you.  Looks like you'll have to Prove Thyself and show the class.
---
When did this board become such a whiny circle jerk of killer mains?
---
Why does this remind me of Detroit Become Human?
---
"Well defined strengths and weakness" Strengths: Ignores literally everything in the map and is the best character capable of working with Aura reading perks. Weakness: Hard to use. Nurse is, really, REALLY not well designed. Shes simply unfair to go against, as long as the user is good enough.
---
Im expecting this to be a shitty tactic from survs:
---
Hide until killer opens exit gate for endgame collapse
---
Run through exit
---
Profit
---
All good :) Duck Duck Go is your friend.
---
Lol it worked for me as well
---
Don't worry man, I don't camp at all now.
---
Point is, a good nurse is uncounterable, and has zero counterplay. Nurses "counterplay" is break line of sight so she has to guess. But theres so many ways to circimvent it. And lets not even get started on 3-4 blink nurse.
---
when you cleanse the hex totem and it’s haunted grounds
---
Lmao you ended up having a pointless argument. You literally played yourself
---
Hm I don't know, I mean there are alot of killers and this group would just consist of 5 people.
---
I will try to list the killers and how strong they would be in this scenario, without the entitys involvement (except for killers who only "live" because of the entity, like Spirit since we are speaking about the full killer cast here).
---
Another Note: Every killer will keep their M1 weapon, but I will not take the M1 into account of how strong they are because I am assuming the M1 as part of their "base streangth", so every Killer will start at "Useless". The killers will only keep their powers if they are possible to use without the entity. The survivors will get their weapons they would logically use.
---
Also: When I will give the killer a "Useless" that does not mean that he would not be extremely dangerous for a normal human, but it represents their strength relative to the other killers.
---
The Killers:
---
The Trapper:
---
If I get an RBT put on me and there are &lt;3 generators left to go, I'm just going to ignore it, knowing I can walk out the gates with no penalty.
---
I like how they get mad at completing the objectives
---
You mean people would have to adjust their timing? That is what the OP is complaining about. It is not in a great place now for either killer or survivor and needs reworked if the effect is not obvious.
---
Aye I don't like Susie's broken ruler, I'll probably get the karambit if the default knife doesn't look too good.
---
I swapped ruin for monstrous shrine and they were super altruistic
---
&gt;I've seen tier 1 billies that use zero addons or NOED
---
NOED is not the reason good killers get 4k, NOED is the reason bad killers have a chance of getting 4k (which is why people don't like it).
---
Not sure why you were negged. It's true. Here on this board, DBD game chat, private messages, whatever. No one "wins" or gains anything these kind of back and forths and it just ends with both sides sitting exactly where they started - spiteful, resentful, angry, etc.
---
Oh use the dark trap add ons. They won’t be able to see it in the dark basemnt
---
I'm a surv main PS4 and playing all day too; hope I bump into you!
---
These are so cringe
---
&gt;A massive nerf
---
Without the nerf, survivors chance of survival would become inbeliavably low.
---
That's fine but it becomes a problem when it just becomes a reason to nerf killers for no good reason and buff survivors.
---
- collapse has hardly any effect on killer gameplay, it's just there.
---
- nerf the pig even though her endgame gamestyle hardly changes because of collapse mechanic. You still have to tunnel a survivor if you want to secure a kill, which is the same as before collapse. The others will get away and even if they had a active trap on their head, 3 minutes is long enough to search the boxes
---
- delete Legion from the game by making his power useless
---
- hatch spawns ALWAYS, which is fine but why does the last survivor need "another" chance to escape once the killer finds it first. The last survivor just needs to camp one exit.and wait till the killer closes the hatch
---
- reduce exit gate open time cause it didn't go fast enough
---
- as a killers your forced to activate the endgame by closing the hatch since you cannot hatch grab anymore. So if a survivor just camps an exit gate, he's gets an easy escape.
---
- bt buff cause why not?
---
I know that would be crazy right
---
So now you're shirtless too huh :D
---
Yeah boi
---
Couldn’t agree more. In my year of playing, I have only faced maybe 1 or 2 good nurses
---
So I'm confused, isn't it only the LAST survivor that can escape with a RBT on?
---
Theyre never gonna nerf swf so i would just learn to accept the loss, learn from the trial to try improve your play style since it is still very much possible to kill a swf
---
Because unlike 110 movement speed killers, Billy can be looped like any other m1 killer. All 110 killers + nurse have abilities that counter loops (hag traps, huntress hatchets, spirit phase walk and legion doesn't care about loops).
---
Nerfing Billy to 110 would severely weaken him, think how easy it is to loop a huntress without hatchets or a spirit/hag who doesn't use their power.
---
Killer movement speed isn't determined based on their mobility, rather how they perform in chases.
---
He's associating himself being a dumb ass with being autistic.. How is that NOT offensive..?
---
It does exist but only for some killers, 
---
LF is one such example as they have little to no tools to apply pressure to survivors. On the other hand gen rushing doesn't exist for nurse as she has more than enough tools to create pressure and its up to the players lack of skill if they loose
---
Let me rephrase it.
---
Nerfing killers that aren't the best is surely not a good balancing strategy? You'd think they'd look at the very top instead of smacking around the mid and low tiers.
---
Well I'd say my win rate is at least 95% since I am a nurse main on pc and I still don't agree that nurse just takes 4 hours to learn maybe 4 hours of consistent playing to learn her blink range but that isn't the whole story that is like learning to track with spirit
---
We got Leatherface whom Billy is an expy of so it could happen.
---
Send a support ticket, they may be able to credit you with some bloodpoints :D
---
CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER PLEASE?
---
Is she not 100% hispanic or something? To me she looks latina af
---
I have to agree I understand it gives me an advantage but do to unreliability in randoms I usually only play survivor with a 3 or 4 swf  group
---
I'd say Huntress.
---
With a lot of bad maps and prediction/precision you need with her, along with being a low mobility killer and a hum that lets you get away from her long before she arrives, to me she's the harder killer to master.
---
Plus it's just more fun with friends
---
*Laurie kills herself to get four stacks*
---
How would you pressure with LF?
---
True, there were a few funny bits though in my opinion.
---
I was thinking about putting Myers in A tier but he’s way too slow. It also takes time for his power to activate.    
---
Maybe Clown would be a little higher but he wouldn’t be better then Myers or Trapper. Trapper has area denial thanks to EGC (moreso if there’s only one person left)     
---
Hag has gotten better because of EGC, would say better then Trapper because while her traps have counters you can easily miss them more then Trappers Traps. Her map pressure has always been insane
---
F
---
You will

The devs have said not to report D/Cs
---
Same goes for UK. They got like what, 100 players? Imagine the queue times.
---
Wraith watches in stealth, while playing with his nipples.
---
Glad someone can see the difference. Its obnoxious and specifically down to piss people off. Nobody Tbag's and flashlights spams just cause, they do it to gloat and go "im better then you lol". It is entirely toxic as a action, just because you don't take it as toxic doesn't mean it isn't. Most people who play one side of this game seem to forget that its other human beings on the other side of it.
---
L4D2 and the first one, its "The Sacrifice" where in the canon story bill fights his way down to the generators to raise the bridge and save his 3 teamates Francis, Louis, and Zoey ultimately dying in the end which is where his time in the entities realm begins in his DBD lore
---
Learn to look behind you while running away from the killer. ( without bumping into stuff)This is the single biggest skill that extends chase times when done correctly
---
Why are you playing a video game then? If you don't enjoy the game for the gameplay, but for doing what is widely accpeted as a toxic and "ha ha you suck" action, and thats the ONLY fun in this game, whats even the fucking point in playing?

Its really not. Thats a horrible analogy. Its more like someone tbagging your corpse everytime they kill you, or emoting in Overwatch over your body every time they kill you, or typing in chat "thanks for letting me kill you" every time you get a kill. Yes, you can just brush it off, but its simply being a needless douchebag. Yeah, some people will smile and laugh at it. But others will just get pissed off. It doesn't make someone "soft" because they are frustrated by the actions of a player while you are not. Stop acting so entitled and "holier then thou" about it.

I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE STILL USE THE TERM CONSOLE PEASANTS WITHOUT IRONY.

That's a really good idea

i once hit a ruin skillcheck without looking, best feeling of accomplishment any game has ever given me
---
Still waiting for my wheelchaired survivor
---
But it is still reduced to 3 minutes instead of "as long as the survivor wants". Learning the game (or even just trying to get some adepts) there would sometimes be survivors who would refuse to leave and hide until they got bored, at which point I'd have to tab out and check back every 10 minutes if I didn't want to DC.
---
Awe thank you
---
Well it’s perfectly in line with lore, us Wraiths need a holiday ever now and then too. Nice dish of pallets cooked to perfection with the heat of four purple flashlights, constantly getting uncloaked due to the Sun...
---
No, whenever I play Trapper (and hag) I use the same strategy. I'd even go as far as saying it's the best strategy unless you're using OP addons, because Trapper doesn't have enough traps + sets them too slowly + moves too slowly to cover the whole map. Smart survivors know this strategy and try to counter it, not so smart survivors die and the really dumb ones whine in the chat about it. Keep at it!
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Making your voice heard and giving feedback during the PTB is literally the point of the PTB.
---
It's important to blink where they're going to be, not where they are. Too many nurses try to play catch up and it doesn't work. Learn survivor patterns and cut them off. Grab them from pallets, don't try to hit them before.
---
Well by that logic how could someone get upset over face camping? It's pixels not moving at all? I know I know, soft people.
---
This is why it’s almost impossible to be toxic in splatoon 2 there’s almost no communication between players so aside from squidbagging there’s not much you can do
---
It's also kind of funny that they were only affected by 2 of your perks instead of all 4. Complaining about MoM as Plague makes no sense..
---
As a killer main, you will always get survivors who will complain and call you toxic. It's just how the community is at this point. Everything the killer does is frowned upon by someone. The main thing to avoid is facecamping hooked survivors, and that's only to avoid getting insulted post game lol.

UK? Are you afraid they won't let you play on "real EU" server (Frankfurt) and lock you to "imaginary EU" London one? morfThink
---
This is not overaltruism, this isn't even altruism. This is purely farming
---
I don't believe I am strawmanning when the original post had nothing to do with pig nerfs and had everything to do with people who were arguing that EDC doesn't make killer easier and suggesting changes to the system so that it would make it easier for killers to get the last survivor or reducing the time to the point whete survivors wouldn't realistically have time to do anything.
---
You can't tell me that people that think that don't exist, I've seen them. If you don't believe this, this post isn't directed at you and I think you might be overcomplicating the entire meme

Typical human being
---
THIS. IF I HOOK SOMEONE AND BBQ SHOWS ME NOTHING, WHY SHOULD I STRAY FAR ENOUGH FROM THE HOOK TO NOT CAPITALIZE ON THEM ALL BEING CLOSE?
---
***when you realise the fame forces a devotion every 100 levels*** #Wait thats illegal
---
That was me (not literally, I'm not that pretty) when I realised what I'd done.
---
First they came for Freddy, and I did not speak out - because the potato team mates can't play against him.
---
Then they came for the Plague, and I did not speak out - because she was better in PTB but still pretty fun.
---
Then they came for Legion, and I did not speak out - because, well, f\*ck Legion.
---
Then they came for me...
---
Nooooooo
---
They are not brain dead, games with way more players (PUBG for ex.) doesn't have Australian servers, because the cost of running them is too high for the amount of players (and revenue they generate) there.
---
Also, the list is not final
---
This post isn't about the pig nerfs, it's about the people who I've seen argue that EGC doesn't benefit killers generally.
---
Not toxic, but when you go up in rank just know that strategy will not work. By the time you have your traps setup, all of the gens will be done.
---
Get better, there is nothing they can do about swf. I understand your frustration, since I play both solo survivor/killer, never swf. Good swf have an edge that's really hard to counter, but bhvr can't do anything. Literally.
---
well yea i intended the 4hrs for the blink range if you dont play this game a lot or dont play killer ofc you will not win most games bc you dont know how to use your power right but if you played other killers enough and learn the blinks youre pretty much set up for some nurse wins
---
Ah yeah I know that map, I played l4d2.
---
The hell a night as a killer in a red light district must be.
---
No, see is not a killer anymore.
---
The changes aren't even out yet. How can you know how strong she would have been without those nerfs?
---
Donald Jigsaw Trump
---
Yeah happens to me all the time on PS4. Lost a few matches because of it :/
---
They have the right to complain, it doesn't mean their complain aren't shit.
---
You have a shitload of dumbass in this sub that are SO retarded, that they are really sure that every killers should be able to compete with SWF. SWF being acknowledge by every one, even devs, for being game breaking but we let them be 'cause "it's fun to bully a killer with a group of 4 low minded who don't exist by themselves", we don't want to hurt their feeling by giving balance back to the game to remove the 3-4premades (obviously i'm not talking about friends that take it very casually).
---
Yes everyone can give his 2cent about balance, but yes their opinion is shit for the most.
---
It's a good thing devs removed infinite. I don't remember a general outcry when it happened. It's was obvisouly stupid as a game mechanic so they removed it that's great. Now, most killers can do really good against an experienced team of solo survivors, that's were the state of balance should stay.
---
I think if you would get banned for using this you can contact easy anti-cheat and get you unbanned
---
Could happen for them
---
I feel you. Everyone just needs to take two steps back and actually test out the new content instead of worrying about 4king/4eing.
---
(it was rare that survivors abused it, but in red rank you always had one in the game)
---
Perfect ♥
---
PTB
---
5 survivor that motivates the others to work faster?
---
Wow imagina that build... that would be scary for survivors but only if the generator spawns there, wich i think it doesnt happen now:(
---
It’s not really meant to be a threat nor had it ever been. It’s a way to injure multiple survivors if they are together and keep them busy for a short period. You then chase the last survivor you hit and attempt to down them as the rest mend or heal.
---
Knowing them, they’ll do jack and shit.
---
I’m saying they still happened. Sometimes people prestige so they can get a certain perk. You don’t have to be butthurt.
---
i see through the lies of the jedi
---
Cloaked
---
Im not a legion main... im actually a spirit main, and i think legion is by far more balanced and fun
---
Nurse has ultra rare? Maybe you are talking about very rare. Anyways i agree. All of them are just useless. Her best addons are rare (green) and common (brown). The only good uncommon are catatonic boy and pocket whatch. 
---
Anyways i suggest using poket whatch and metal spoon while learning
---
Every single game would be which ever map is the most survivor-sided, since 4 vs 1 in the vote.
---
He’s an idiot for repeatedly trying to save his teammate. Do you know the definition of insanity?
---
You are welcome kind sir.
---
Freddy buff. Ok 5 rules
---
I doubt they pulled the server locations from nowhere. They’ll have data on how many people are playing and in which locations and will have picked servers based on that.
---
Not toxic. Patrolling isn’t toxic. In fact, I find that I do this frequently with certain characters like Pig and Doctor
---
The  ew one in my opinion
---
Keys can feel rough, but it's just a part of the game, and it's not an item that sees regular use, it has a low drop rate for a reason.
---
Shitty whispers only when timers are active? No thanks...
---
still cant comprehend why anyone would want to play this game on console
---
Only if they have Empathy for one another, bad idea to base a relationship on Slippery Meat.
---
Yeah, I remember when it used to. You have to be really careful about how and when you move and uncloak with this build unless you're on the Game or Léry's.
---
you still didn't learn to read, did you...
---
That’s the moment where you find god’s little miracles
---
Well... The one on the right is pink and... Uh...
---
getting a skillcheck with huntress lullaby and all the doctor's shits.
---
Don't use any addons that give her more, less, or farther blinks. It messes with your ability to predict how far to go.
---
He tore your argument apart flawlessly.
---
Swf is pretty balanced. People dont want it removed because its fun
---
Imo mid-tier killers are way more fun because it makes the game more challenging because you have to actually mindgame effectively when playing killers like Wraith or Hag. I personally really enjoy the plague right now but seeing as I don’t play much killer and I don’t have many good perks or add ons but that doesn’t stop me from enjoying the game even if I get like one kill by the end of the game.
---
Top me
---
The canister counts as his body piece. 
---
The head piece is merely the gas mask and helmet.
---
We all know
---
This is definitely not true, as a console player I am limited to the max sensitivity which makes it really hard to turn fast with a controller.
---
At least you got a game
---
Don’t get close while he’s at tier 3. You’d be surprised how often this happens. Also certain add ons increase his tier iii rate and unlocks instakill abilities
---
&gt; but then again you can’t rotate the character in menu to see everything
---
You can rotate them in the Store menu by dragging them with your mouse (holding X/A and spinning your left stick)

If your deaf friend is better than you then you need to get better at the game

Traps are meant to delay \*objectives\*. Exiting the gate is the final objective. 
---
Once the last Genny is done, do you feel that BHVR intends for a 3-minute teabag party for the survivors, with no further objective or pressure?
---
Do you want to see 1 pig in every 60 games instead of 30? Because that's what this nerf is going to do.
---
TWO COUNTERPOINTS:
---
FIRST, RANKING IS SUPPOSED TO BE A REFLECTION OF ABILITY, NOT A REWARD. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER BECAUSE A 4K IN MINUTES COULD MEAN YOU'RE MUCH BETTER THAN YOUR RANK... OR THE SURVIVORS ARE MUCH WORSE. ITS BETTER FOR THE OVERALL HEALTH OF A GAME TO NOT OVERREACT FOR SOMEONE'S RANK IN A GAME WHERE ITS CLEAR THE SYSTEM ALREADY SCREWED UP. AND IN CASES LIKE YOURS, ITS CLEAR THE SYSTEM HAS ALREADY MESSED UP.
---
SECOND, THERE ARE WAYS TO TRY TO GET A 4K THAT AREN'T HEALTHY FOR THE GAME. JUST SAYING BLANKET "YEAH THATS A DOUBLE PIP" POTENTIALLY CAUSES LONG TERM PROBLEMS THAT DRIVE SURVIVORS AWAY, AND MAKE THINGS WORSE IN A GAME THAT IS FRANKLY ON RAZOR THIN ICE (NOT SAYING ITS DEAD, BUT THIS GAME HAS BEEN OUT LONG ENOUGH THAT ITS EASIER TO SCARE PEOPLE AWAY THAN IT IS TO BRING NEW PEOPLE IN)
---
Y’all better eat some BBQ and Chili for prom dinner!
---
That hoodie gives you a connor vibe to it eh?
---
What isnt true? That noone know how to counter her? I play nurse a lot and only see player sprinting into my face while charging a blink, and is really easy to counter this juke. As i said, she s harder to learn than pc but not impossible. You can turn while blinking and the auto aim help a lot  for hit survivors behind you
---
I mean I don’t because I just play to have fun I don’t really care all too much about how bad or good I am.
---
Im pretty sure Queen already knows about this. If I recall correctly she was in the stream at that time
---
Because literally everyone does it... he didn't call you autistic so why should you care?
---
Oh, well, it's good to see they both changed for the best.
---
No not really. People only get mad at BHVR when they make dumb decision like nerfing pig or matchmaking and servers being horrible. And seeing how BHVR makes  poor choice often, everybody is complaining at them all the time.
---
They should allow P2P as an option so that people from less populated regions can actually play
---
BUT WHAT IF I AS A SURVIVOR WANT TO DIE? BET YOU DIDN’T THINK OF THAT HUH?
---
Dont use monstrous shrine. Its terrible
---
If you can't find a good meme to send to someone, just send a simple ;). It's the most triggering thing ever lul
---
I don't know what rank you play, but if you play nurse at red ranks it's not like they don't knpw how to counter you. I always run into the problem  that I'm swinging in the dark and hoping the auto aim locks on. I need higher sensitivity.
---
Poor Nurses
---
Okay... good luck... with Myers and the downvotes.
---
Oh dear
---
The deep wounds bar can no longer be seen going down by killer so it all ways looks at 100% and I think they have an addons that makes it so if you hit some with deep wounds a second time they
---
 become broken for 60 seconds.
---
I think nurse is fine tbh - but hey
---
Amen
---
Ayeeeeeeee
---
\*shudders\*
---
I mean, like it or not they DID overnerf him. Deep would is pointless to apply now, it may as well not even be there. They slowed Feral frenzys speed insanely much so moving between multiple survivors is difficult unless they are very nearby one another, and hes just another m1 killer now after landing that first hit with his power. Im sure survivor side hes more fun to play against, no doubt. But hes boring, hes bad, and his power is mostly pointless.
---
Split up. The best way to play against Michael is to use your numbers and his lack of mobility against him. Don’t all work on one gen, don’t all run around the same area. If he gets tier 3, stay the hell away from him, don’t immediately rush hooks, don’t rush to heal people on the ground, be a little more cautious and hang back for a few seconds. He can only get to tier 3 like four times in a match so unless he’s running infinite tier 3, you can usually wait it out. 
---
Every time I kill everyone as Michael it’s because the survivors rush to unhook each other before I have chance to leave, and I’m able to immediately down the rescuer. I slug someone for like five seconds and three other survivors come running over, desperate to heal. It’s like they can’t bear to be separated and I can easily stalk multiple survivors, get tier 3, and down two or more people at once. The games I struggle are those where the survivors split up, work on separate gens and don’t let me snowball. 
---
I would honestly recommend playing him and seeing what survivor strategies work against you, then try using those.
---
The issue is how many people are gonna wait around for an unplayable game to LET them play again. If they stall and take 6 months to "monitor" and decide, it's gonna be fucking hard to rebuild the playerbase. Those of us that WILL come back could well be met with insane queue times for a very long time.
---
At one point devs probably considered expanding on stealth but once they saw how boring and stale stealth is they decided to abandon it. Imo current stealth is boring for both sides and shouldnt be pushed as a viable strategy.
---
They don't show you that it runs on 15 fps in the trailer or on PC so the people who bought it early (me included) got screwed .
---
That and the pose
---
yes.
---
It happened to me a lot of time 
---
Nurse to level 40, one day later nurse to level 1
---
Bubba to level 40, one day later back to level 1
---
Nurse prestige 1, all the way back to level 40
---
Wraith prestige 1, all the way back to level 1 
---
Quentin prestige 3, all the way back to prestige 2 level 1.
---
And other minor level lost. I think the problem is that you turn of the play station whitout closing the game first. I try to remember this everytime and i dont find anymore problems from a long time
---
Ghostface is pretty much confirmed as far as I’m concerned, they guy who owns the character has talked about it a few times and BHVR has said it’s a possibility.
---
This is so common now. Sad
---
Hm I don't know, I mean there are alot of killers and this group would just consist of 5 people. I actually think that Michael and Freddy (the influence of the entity actually kinda weakens them) would have it quite easy against everyone besides Ash (who also was heavily nerfed by the entity)
---
Without preparation or knowledge about him, Freddy can just kill everyone one by one in their dreams. No one but Ash would be able to fight him in the dreamworld and no one would have enough time to understand that there is the possibility to bring him into the real world. And otherwise he will never be down for good.
---
And for Michael he just won't die, you can do whatever you want, he somehow survives all this. And he won't hesitate to kill. So they might be able to slow his killing, they won't be able to stop him.
---
So these two alone would be a good match for these 5 people, because Freddy is just OP and Myers kills without hesitation. However there are still two people who run wild with a chainsaw, one man who lays traps in preperation for the fight, one highly intellegent man who is able to use the stregths of the killers and coordinate tactics. one women who has animal like instincts and who hunts human and animals alone since she was about 5,  one woman who knows how to destroy the psyche of other people, 2 people who just want revenge and will do anything to get that, 2 people who are mentally broken and who will most likely do everything they get ordered to do, 4 edgy teenagers who just have fun killing and one man who just loves the feeling to break his prey and kill them afterwards.
---
And I think the most likely order these 5 would die is:
---
David, Tapp, Laurie, Bill, Ash
---
So while I do believe that especially Ash would give a good fight, I still think he would eventually die, just because there are just to much people who want to kill him.
---
yeah, one of the reasons I lost interest in the game after 200+ hours in. Useless perks left useless for ages when they could have been changed really quickly without even altering their functionality that much and then changing things that were core aspects of some perks/characters to make them a lot less fun to use or unusable. Also I still hate the bloodweb, I never get to really play the builds I wanna play because every time a new character is added, it just takes too damn long to RNG those perks to the character I want to have em + using the add-ons is kinda the same thing as many strategies require specific add-ons but you have no guarantee of finding them at any given time
---
Honestly makes me feel good
---
I mean out of all survivors and comparing their in game model to rendered model, Jane is pretty damn close
---
Traps only last two minutes. EGC last three or more when someone is downed. Survivors had less time before EGC. This nerf was unnecessary. The ability to die from leaving the traps was a literal 
---
#feature 
---
It required coding and testing. Its quite clear that if the devs decided it was a cheese strat, they would have nerfed her within the year she has been out. Just because you feel it is cheesy doesn't mean it is. Yeah, its easy to get a trap on your head and suddenly have to stay in the game an extra few minutes searching through boxes instead of just leaving. But that was a feature, not cheese or exploit. 
---
Think of Freddy, after the gens are powered, its very difficult to wake up if your fully healed. Does that make that a cheese strat? By your logic it does because it is exploiting the lack of skill checks available at the end game. 
---
You cant decide how RBT are meant to be used. Thats up to the killer. But its also up to the devs and apparently they side with one sided complainers like you. Yes, the EGC would have been a buff to pig. But there are ways to alter the EGC so that its not a "Guess im dead moment". Make it so if a player has a RBT on, the EGC slows like if someone is downed. That would buff pig, make her more fun, make the community happy because they can experiment and relearn the game with new strategies, and not litteraly make her power usless after the game is nearly over. 
---
If you get caught by pig and get and RBT when the EGC is about to go off and you dont have enough timw to get the trap off and leave, well thwn that is literally the survivirs fault for staying in the game that long.
---
Sure, but there's a huge difference in running at the killer to to loop him and running at the killer only to die 5 seconds later..
---
I love make people salty whitout insulting them, and i love being creative whit it.
---
"You are such a toxic player fuking noob " 
---
I "this game is toxic, buy an hazmat suite and you'll be fine" 
---
Or to an ash that was hiding the entire game cuz he was the last survivor whit 5 gens left 
---
"How you dare to shit in the tall grass all the time? " 
---
Lore reference are my favourite. But what i like to say when i go to do a bubba full facecamp is "sorry, i cant stop to stare at your face. Is such a beautyfull face." Or smth
---
Just be glad I didn’t go with the colour version
---
Dude, I'm saying this so much lately (its Thursday now, caps lock off)
---
They need to start penalizing DCers harshly
---
It had to be the noed player
---
I mean they should be able to make a setting for a region that is called other, and if you have that selected you would just queue with the old system.
---
Nice grab there lol
---
&gt; The ONLY time I've seen killers complain about swf in game is when I've been in solo queue with a bunch of others solo queuing and we all just happened to play very well.
---
Yup. Get one flashlight save or a bodyblock, and you're immediately SWF
---
Can be bought with shards or costs actual money?
---
What are the tricks to using Distortion efficiently? I've never used it but I just feel it's not worth it given that you can hide in lockers, behind generators, and I don't use Selfcare
---
So the killer shouldn’t rely on their ‘power’ to get kills? M1 it is then.
---
Don't get me wrong, I like the EGC and it was needed but it's not as important as Dedicated Servers and Hitboxes! Those two make the game super annoying and thankfully they're working on Dedicated Server and hopefully this fixes Hitboxes as well!
---
Daze
---
9 minutes?  phht,  If I was gen rushing that is enough time for 3 games not counting lobby wait time.
---
On PS4, I see plenty of UK players.
---
Plus there's a fair number of English streamers, including: Tru3Ta1ent, Ardetha, HybridPanda and Morf.
---
definitley disagree with the Noed and Rancor changes.
---
It would be okay if Noed is shown inmediatly if 5 gens are done and Rancor should honestly stay the way it is.
---
Not sure what you changed about PTYF
---
That's hard to believe though. They've been teasing us with a Freddy rework for almost a year now!
---
Vigil: heck no. Can easily be exploited   
---
Rancor: No. that is too Powerful and it’s not exploited now. 
---
Left behind, great
---
Damn, I can feel his salt from here.
---
Well done lad
---
Right?  I also was called a nazi earlier too because we did the objectives and escaped.
---
As I said, a couple hundred is not enough to maintain a whole region. 
---
Some of the said streamers already said so themselves and see a potential thread in being locked down to UK only. 
---
They should really just break it down to "EU West" like every other game odes and provide data centers in multiple countries. But not lock a country in.
---
Yes, this happens to me too. I'm starting to think it's because I'm not closing the game first before I turn off my console. Fortunately for me, each time I've only lost the last 20 minutes of bloodweb purchases, etc.
---
Yeah..  with a baseball bat to the knees.
---
sorry, you lost me at "bloodlust should also be removed from the game"
---
let's just delete killers and add some friendly cuddlebears to assist survivors with tools while their repair generators
---
You either have a problem with the whole theme of legion or with the whole idea that killers should be something other than M1 spammers moving at 115% speed without any power during chases. In both cases we have fundamentally different views on the subject of diversity in gameplay and we can just agree to disagree.
---
Tuesday I was rank 4 with 3 pips. Logged in next day on Wednesday to find I'm rank 5 with 3 pips. Never DC'd or anything. Just went back to play next day and all my rank progress was lost from the night before.
---
You basically just pointed out all of the things that the legion can do currently in the game...
---
Means prestige
---
but this is dead by daylight, what do u want to spoil? that the killer has NOED?
---
my eyes omg my eyes no &gt;\_&lt;
---
Wdym? He randomly said who died in the new avengers movie
---
If you need Bloodlust to down a survivor, you don't deserve to down a survivor. Bloodlust was introduced as a band-aid fix for infinites, which are no longer even a thing outside of Haddonfield (which should also be fixed)
---
No, I don't have a problem with killers that aren't 115% movespeed. I main Huntress and Spirit. I have a problem when a killer is introduced that removes any reason to learn how to play the game, which live Legion does.
---
YES DONT YOU JUST LOVE TO GRIND ALL THE TIME FOR YOUR LOUSY STACK OF BP AS A SURVIVOR AND THEN HAVE TO SPEND THEM ON PERKS LIKE DEJA VU, TECHNICAN OR “LESSEN THE DARK MIST”-OFFERINGS.
---
These wraith mains I’ll tell ya what
---
Didn't know about Lauries training. Is the 2018 version worth watching btw?
---
how exactly would one even nerf the nurse? like, what can you even do to her that still keeps her power... powerful but also balanced?
---
True, i think its the assumption they played for longer they must know the game well by now
---
its like in overwatch, i'm gold border and people freak out about that thinking i'm amazing at the game....i'm a poop ;( lol
---
I mean a god nurse on console realistically still can’t even be comparable to good nurse mains on PC. They’re limited by a controller as far as her kit goes, and they’re *severely* limited by their own hardware. Obviously if you practice hundreds of hours on just her you’ll be able to win matches, but the ceiling for nurses on console is much much lower than on PC.

I agree that there are some harmless SWF, but that doesn’t invalidate the fact that at high ranks, SWF of 4 who actually know how to play exist and it gives them a huge advantage the fact that they can communicate. You have to take into consideration that low ranks and high ranks have nothing in common, and they have different problems

Dinner at the Red Forest Inn
---
Not anymore. Now it's more like two.
---
Hahah !
---
The colors and the fabric. Detroit was saturated with synthetic fabric and sky blue LED lights.
---
Only 1080 auric cells will buy it
---
Speak up Francis, you voice got all muffled up for being so far up your arse!
---
&gt; you never know which vault this game is going to give you 
---
You do! I'll send you a great video when I get home from work that should help a lot. Also, staying more tight to your corners will help a lot. If you rewatch your video, you go wide quite a few times.
---
If you were on PC I could help you ingame haha, but I'll get that video to you after work.
---
I sit in a recliner with a little tray to rest the keyboard and mouse on. Try turning up your sensitivity a bit so looking back is a bit faster and won't require as much movement.
---
Any offensive action uses a token. The only change PWYF needs is that the attack has to connect to use a token.  OPs change would make it worse imo (as far as attacking the obsession is concerned) as losing more tokens on a hit would make an already weak perk even weaker.
---
Lame. Not gonna pay them any money after their new updates. Such a shame. Oh well. Maybe I'll reconsider when they get their shit together.
---
I mean, it *was* the DC enabling pallet
---
You can run straight to the hooked person without worrying about the killer seeing your bright-red trail. Goes quite nicely with Sprint Burst + We'll Make It
---
It's about the angel you hit it at. There are times where it's fucky but generally speaking as long as you're running up on it straight and not curving into the he window your vaults should always be fast. The code's not bulletproof but straight paths to windows for at least 3-5 steps should garuntee a fast vault.
---
He is moving down
---
Here you go, a bunch of downvotes, because fuck your opinion
---
That's a bit disappointing, not for the "finding out if she's running IF" part, but since the scratch mark removal would be great.
---
This reminds me when I first wraith grabbed
---
On console i will sometimes look back and literally watch the killer while i run for a couple a seconds, are you saying i can only peak on keyboard and mouse?
---
thats why you don’t constantly play one side. You’ll have more fun swapping roles every game
---
so... are you saying that i should run in a straight line?
---
I do play Survivor and Killer but for the 4th time playing as Spirit. Not in a row but in general.
---
Apparently on the PTB active traps aren’t going off either. Could be a bug, could be a typo in the patch notes.
---
well now you know when they’re in your terror radius at least
---
Ideally you'd like to keep an eye on where you're going and having faster camera movement helps with constantly switching views. It also helps if you do killer
---
That’s the problem. They balanced the game around one setting (no voice comms) but people asked for SWF so they added it without changing a single thing, and that obviously made it unbalanced.  And I agree, playing with friends is more fun, but I’m not saying remove SWF. Maybe make it a different gamemode (for both survivors and killers) that gives more rewards or something like that.
---
Wow! Thanks for the photos.
---
Also, your English is fantastic!
---
Im getting really sick of all the pig posts was thinking about unsubscribing until all this blows over tbh
---
Wrong. It was made to stop hatch stand offs and definitively end the game, also preventing immersed survivors from holding the game hostage. The entire community is sick of them. Nobody worth their salt cares about BM at the gates. 
---
If everything they did was based on complaints then every killer would be non-lethal and survivor BP gains would average 50k per trial.
---
Why do you feel like that it is *required* to sloe down the game. You feel like it is but not everyone does. It is good thats why everyone plays it just like self cares I legit dont see the difference
---
This isn't really how it works.
---
The servers only mean where the players are going to connect, the game will typically try to connect you to the server closest to you or whichever server will have less latency but that doesn't mean that sometimes, provided the ping is under certain values, will connect you to those servers in those locations.
---
Found the entitled killer
---
This might apply for shooters more, but playing a game such as Portal 1 and 2 tend to be helpful in getting people comfortable with changing from a controller to mouse and keyboard. As for keybinds, I think really the only one worth changing is your stuggle to something else like M1, mouse wheel up/down, or even another keyboard key. Space bar is the loudest key to mash.
---
Just keep at it and it'll all work out. Just gotta adjust naturally.
---
DO NOT LOOK AT u/Laburneraccount999’s COMMENT AS IT CONTAINS ENGAME SPOILERS
---
Oh yea, I typed my snark too quickly.
---
I play a lot of nurse on console and frame rate is hardly an issue for me
---
On my first 5 or so games as killers, I remember hitting hooked survivors thinking that it killed them faster. I wonder if those peeps thought I'm being toxic too. Too bad for him if he's really a new killer being bullied with a flashlight.
---
It's not like he wouldn't go with me, it's just a fun gesture to make a poster and ask your date to prom even if you know they would say yes
---
I meant the jungle gym or how it calls. And you think you're better than me just because you're a native English and me not? Good. The same people who teabags at the exit every match just to waste killer's time will down vote my comments and support yours
---
look, i don't want to point out that she was bad but she was stubborn for not giving up and she lost the match for that. thank god that i had competent survivors in my team and did both gens and totems
---
Because they seem to need to have inflated egos from bullying people like you
---
Honestly, I miss the surprise hype of the new chapters. 
---
The time when they went straight to live. PTB has it HUGE benefits for the  feedback and such but still.
---
Why? Are you sick of justice?
---
;D
---
Glad to hear it but im pretty most people agree that the framerates pretty awful, especially compared to pc
---
Also killer: opens gate on his own, carries 2 survivors to the basement and uses lag switch to drop them there and bodyblock the stairs
---
Why, if you cant play her then she is very bad and she is never played at ranks 20-9 ?
---
I run same build except, no add-one and replace insidious with bamboozle
---
\*Entitties mori\*
---
It seems to be the T pose while healing someone, not sure hhah
---
60/40 Survivor / killer, but it's OK.
---
How about we just make accuracy mean something?
---
Killers think not getting an easy 4k every game means survivors are toxic. This sub seems to be mostly an entitled killers support group.
---
I totally get what you mean but I could just say well the base survivor is very weak and has building blocks to compensate for that, I also feel like it has been blatantly stated before dbd team is very killer-sided and not survivor sided except for this new update where they for some reason decide to do something extremely different ( I also think they dont know exactly wtf they doing tho atm )
---
Every time I close my eyes...
---
No, i'm not. I'm just not a good Spirit.
---
Feel you bro
---
Don't play by your opponents rules
---
Tbh missing blinks is just a part of her gameplay, everybody miss at least sometimes. Otherwise there would be literally no counterplay (well, who am I kidding, but...)
---
I don’t think it should slow down for *each* survivor. That would result in like a twenty minute timer in extreme cases. Just slow it down *if* a survivor has a trap on them. I still wouldn’t like that but I could come to peace with it.
---
Not really but I have funny writing style when I discuss things I see when a survivor grand stands and fails.  Its like when you are in chase and they are on the other side of a pallet tea bagging. They just got me closer to blood lust when I go around it and down them. Ty for your skills??  Besides the DC meta going around is usually the guy who thinks he is hot shit and gets bitch slapped back down to earth.
---
And what did you do? Hhhahah gosh that survivor's mentality
---
I solved this problem. I made a Trapper Basement build. Worst case scenario, I only get one person. Best case, I get all four of their toxic see ass' in the basement and set/pickup traps in front of them as I wait for the entity.
---
A lot of great killer mains will be say nurse is the only killer played at red ranks because she is the only one that can actually challenge survivors because she simply goes around the fundamentals of the game rather than playing through them like every other killer. Take that away and not many killers can withstand the type of survivors that make it to rank 1 now.
---
But you need to look at the other side here. Is it better to not have dedicated servers, something that the majority of the community has been begging for YEARS? Or is it better to keep the lag-switching enabled, unreliable and outdated connection type that is P2P just because a few regions that make up a miniscule part of the community won't have their own servers? I'm not trying to say "fuck australia" or anything, but I don't think the discussion on whether or not dedicated servers should come out is considering how it affects one small region of the game.
---
Why should the C in "chapter" be capitalized?
---
I wil be the 5th survivor.
---
My pain is immeasurable and my day is a bit funnier, thank you.
---
“We’re gonna build a HUGE trap, and we’re gonna make the survivors pay for it!”
---
rofl I got that reference
---
Hey dude I don’t mean any offense by this, but it’s killers like you that allow survivors to set these arbitrary rules.
---
You don’t have to play like a dick and camp, but damn forgiving stupid mistakes is like letting someone take my Queen in chess because I feel like being nice.
---
It won’t affect me because I use them mid game. Also the terror radius thing won’t affect me either because I never check the boxes for a survivor. I use the traps to slow down the game.
---
Yeah, her hits after blinks are always a gamble, but sometimes it's better to just fatigue instead of swinging in uncertainty. Swing miss + fatigue is a lot of wasted time
---
Makes more sense then some of the people I see doing nothing while I die on the hook.
---
Same here. It's too much.
---
Sure thing! Offer stands to help in KYF also. I lost my red rank due to DCs so I just gave up until the new patch comes out.
---
Well I'm lucky I already saw the film
---
The thing is, against a good nurse even if you break LOS they know your options and can still track you down. Against a good nurse you really can’t do much but practice good fundamentals like doing gens when someone’s on hook and not being over altruistic.
---
I play killer and survivor. My killer main before was legion. Why? I LOVED the ability to ignore pallets and loops. But survivors can't handle that and whined so much that he was nerfed Ok fine. Granted, he did need to be tweaked to remove exploits, but not have his core kit nerfed into the ground but whatever.
---
So since legion is effectively dead and can be looped like everyone else, I started playing nurse again. No add-ons, 2 blinks. 
---
Why did I start playing nurse? Because pallets and looping are dumb and I hate them. Even as a survivor I hate them. They are silly mechanics, but survivors don't have any other option, so I get why people do it. But it still isn't fun.
---
Furthermore, everyone is saying "most swf groups are just goofing and having fun". False. Most swf groups are there to win, and it is incredibly easy to gen rush for a coordinated team in this game. Most killers can't even down 2 survivors before 2 gens pop if they are being coordinated. And that's the problem.
---
At higher ranks and against swf, killers are passive and reactionary. Survivors set the pace of the game and killers just don't have the tools to stop them.
---
Except for nurse.
---
Even against a highly coordinated team, a nurse can still wipe them IF SHE IS GOOD. There are plenty of things survivors can do to stop her (stealth, jukes, breaking los) but you just can't loop her, which you can for EVERY other killer, hence for most survivors, that's all they know how to do. And when it doesn't work (like vs nurse and old legion) they dunno what to do!
---
Please... do not nerf nurse. Killers need the option of being able to control the pace of the game. I would even be in favor of buffing most of the other killers, even though I die in most of my solo queue games because we aren't coordinated.
---
Killers should be scary in this game, not mocked while they are running in circles around a pallet.
---
Uno reverse card
---
Yeah it’s pretty terrible on console. Didn’t bother me before I got it on PC. Then you can’t go back.
---
Yes, it's so funny bully beginners. I could understand if he was rank 10 and above and all the things you did were totally justified. Anyway, there was no a reason to facecamp plus hitting, he should watch videos and learn that, it is not the way to play killer mode. Less BP and fun,and Bullying justified
---
A CAMPING DAILY
---
MAN I JUST FUCKING LOOOVE WHEN I PLACE A TRAP AS TRAPPER AND THAT SHIT STARTS FLOATING? LIKE WHAT THE FUCK??? AINT NO SURVIVOR GONNA STEP IN THAT ITS A FUCKING FOOT IN THE AIR, GOD DAMN I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE IF ANYONE HAD THE GREAT IDEA OF LOOPING AROUND THE KILLER SHACK AGAINST A TRAPPER MAYBE I COULD PUNISH THEM BUT NOOOOOPE
---
I can’t stress enough how much I’d actually like to be able to play the game with her trap mechanics unaltered. Let the community decide if her traps are OP. If her kill/pip rate exceeds the norm, fine, then nerf her. This change just feels like it was a three minute discussion at a meeting with no testing done or metrics considered.
---
I know your pain, I can have good games until that one game, were I can go from not being triggered easily to that single teabag and you're ready to throw your PC out of the window.
---
Take a break, do something else and come back to it.
---
Thats how I deal with it, I can get frustrated, and tell myself I am not going to play for a long time, Grab something to eat or walk the dog and 30 minutes later I am ready to absorb more punishment.
---
I like seeing a diversity of killers in the game other than playing against Frank's mixtape i didn't find it too bad. I equated some of it to playing against other killers with ultra rare addons.
---
You mean beside the fact that she'd have too much of an advantage in the end game due to different perk combinations combined with her Traps? The fact that she'll be able to snowball at the end and keep survivors in too long?
---
Nurse needs nerfs (although it’s only showing now bc red ranks are ONLY playing nurse) billy is the most balanced killer for high ranks since he isn’t as overbearing as nurse is in the chase
---
Oh, well that is definitely shit.
---
We will have to see and hope they won‘t fuck this one up
---
Here are my nicknames for these perks:
---
Hard Mode Enabled
---
Terror Radius? SCATTER!!!
---
I See Your Pain and it's Glorious 
---
Right in the Place of Mild Inconvenience
---
That the sound gets fcked more and more. It's horrible.
---
That‘s a sad possibility. But it‘d make 0 sense.
---
If players just accepted it as someone trying to have fun instead of being a dick they wouldn’t be sensitive over tbagging in video games
---
In all honesty it was most likely a first time legion. Only a tier 1 discordance and nothing else.
---
Needs more Jpeg
---
They downvoted you for no reason
---
Yes, a great pc nurse is better than a great console nurse, but at the same time , if the console nurse get to use mouse and keyboard (not counting that he would have to adapt) he will be better than the oringinal pc nurse because he will find everyting more easy to do
---
Yea pretty much man. If the killer community keeps doing these favors for the survivor community, those favors will become expectations by the survivor community and then our obligations.
---
Which is what it seems it’s at. And what’s the point of playing then? Might as well go play world of Warcraft or something.
---
The Endgame Collapse: Oops, All Killer Nerfs!
---
Which member we talkin about here
---
workin' in the salt mines.
---
Nurse on console is just as good. Its just that fucking pc masteracers are bad and think u need to have a high fps to be good at the game.
---
Having fun by the looks of it
---
I think he means all four of them, simultaneously
---
All
---
Its a rank 14 killer playing Legion for the first time. You can hardly expect more
---
Reported
---
I rate this guy 5/5 in my heart
---
On the PTB right now it doesn’t matter if they are active or not. Could be a typo in the notes. Could be an oversight. Could be a bug. Could be fixed before the patch goes live. Could be fixed in the next few months.
---
Hold up not gonna lie I’m into Susie she thicc
---
There is only pain and suffering in dbd.
---
Yea true we dind't have this problem way back because we only had like 3 killers and not all those fancy perks ( sounding like a real old man here ) sadly this forum is also no place to have a normal discussion, anyone saying anything bad about killers just gets insta down voted which makes it collapse. This sub reddit is just a massive echo chamber for killers who are salty they don't get the attention they want. Also alot of times it's not even the killers chances they have but they just suck ass. Alot of the killers out there are legit baby killers that you can loop around, good killers wouldnt let that happen.
---
Sounds like a place I should live! I love it when it's cold outside. It gets warmer here now and I don't like that at all. :P
---
I am convinced this was a three minute discussion at a meeting with no testing done or metrics considered.
---
r/dbdanimemes
---
Do you really think a 2 blink nurse is OP?
---
No. I’m just bad at downing people before that. At least with the traps, I can either force a kill or force altruism
---
Oh I play killer.. just never made it to red ranks i dont put in enough time lowest i got was like 7 and I could only do that with the spirit. I'm really bad at chances still i loose track really easily so I'm not ready for red ranks lmao.. but i play survivor ins red and purple ranks. Red rank survivor is miserable the killers are so sweaty I dont have fun.. lots of Billy's and bbq,nurses,ruin, sometimes noed in red ranks. But my squad tries to take out all the totems we will leave the last gen if we havent found them all. Noed is becoming more common. Anytime we forget to cleanse all the totems bam pops noed. Sometimes you're lucky to get gens done more or less totems. Lmaoo. All the killers slugging for the 4ks makes me crazy and killers wonder why theres so many dcs..
---
Report him for spam 🤣
---
Well your talking to one of the few who could pull it off my friend too
---
Unpopular Opinion: Toxicity in dead by daylight is built into the way the game is designed and written (as far as  writing goes in a multiplayer videogame.) To play optimally as killer is considered toxc to survivors (proxy, not face, camping and tunneling are viable options) and to play optimally as survivor is considered toxic to killers (genrushing, etc. etc.). This all part of the entities design, to sew intense emotions from us that satiate is hunger. As a mediocre killer main i welcome salty messages from survivors tbh.
---
Sub's rule number 3...
---
&gt;Bad at downing people
---
There. This is your issue. Not the patch, not the change. This. Get better at it and you won't have a problem. Don't rely too heavily on cheesy mechanics.
---
Imo she needed something for egc. Not necessarily this nerf but she cant just be how she was. Imo they should just pause the egc timer if someone has a trap on and itll be like how it was before the ptb against pig except she can close the hatch, which still gives her a small edge, but not one as big as her npt being changed for egc at all
---
well maybe the Nea was camped and tunneled jsut the game before when he played helpful Bill. It's a Catch 22.
---
Absolutely not - But most definitely uncounterable in an experienced player's hands.
---
That's the key thing - Experience. You can most definitely counter an average nurse. But I wouldn't say you'd be able to counter a professional nurse.
---
A good change would be to disallow her seeing scratch-marks for a second or so after fatigue, or otherwise.
---
They should start selling hat cosmetics that Pig can place on the survivors' heads instead of reverse bear traps.
---
im a great console nurse i just dislike playing her
---
That's what birthed the true Gen Rush term. 4 players banging them GG
---
No. It would be logical if they actually tested the Pig’s mechanics in the EGC or used metrics to determine how often traps kill people trying to exit the gate, then determined that she would perform outside normal kill/pip rates and implemented the change. This change was the result of an exchange at meeting that pretty much started and ended with, “I think we need to change the Pig’s traps for the collapse.”
---
For some reason I imagine Ace just pulling out a gun and shooting Frank
---
***BING BONG***
---
Because I own a console and the game looked fun..
---
yeah, playing as nurse or no-mixtape legion is really being spoonfed kills with no skill required and I'm the bad player here that has no idea about the gameplay and difficulty
---
infinite loops can only be countered by bamboozle or bloodlust, they are called infinite for a reason. the only choice instead of going for bloodlust chase on infinite loop is to ignore the survivor that went for it which is a correct choice in most of the situations anyway, that's really fun indeed
---
also the argument that I need bamboozle to win is stupid. how dare I use a perk that gives me any adventage in gameplay?! I'm surely the worst killer alive, its either no perks and no addons or I'm bad. At the same time survivors using self care, adrenaline, dead hard and old decisive strike are totally fine.
---
I don't know why you're implying that I'm complaining here. I've been playing DBD for over a year with hundreds of hours put into the game and I never had problems as a killer or as survivor (however I am much worse at it than killer because I play surv only occasionally). I actually learned how to play killer in the worst imbalance moment in the history of the game, with both mechanics and bugs that really hurt the killers. For the first 2 months I didn't know you are supposed to hear footsteps or survivor breathing and I still enjoyed the game and ranked up just by developing a game sense. 
---
I don't like unnecessary nerfs and removing diversity  from the game. I'm all in for necessary ones though , for both sides. I'm lobbying for removing franks mixtape from the game entirely and adding cd to the legion missed hits in frenzy, but not for homogenizing a killer to be another Trapper without traps. Big surprise that after few hundred hours it is refreshing to play something in a different way, like legion, who makes chases totally different and changes the objective both for the killer and the survivor
---
when you resort to personal attacks it really means that the discussion is over.
---
With this way of thinking, games should never say “Game Over” either. You pretty much can’t handle losing and if a stagnant game that’s fake tells you that you did bad and you can’t handle it, you’re probably not mature enough to be online anyway.
---
They're only useless if you put them on after endgame starts, active RBTs will still trigger at the exit gates
---
I really agree with this. “Sacrificed/Dead” doesn’t mean anything because you can still get that message and pip, meaning you actually won. “Entity Displeased” is just a big giant “YOU LOST” sign waved in their face. Think I’m wrong? Ok, then how about if survivors don’t at least safety pip the message they receive is “Trial Failed.”
---
I'm playing Sekiro lol
---
Yeah it’s so hard to believe that they tweeted it out like 2 days ago
---
Hopefully the money made from the sheer number of cosmetics they pump out is spent on design and programmer teams rather than the art team.
---
Seeing as the art team just uses copyrighted characters half the time anyway they dont really have a challenge in character creation.
---
The design team and programming however could really use some extra enthusiasm and resources i think everyone here can agree with that, what with the hot and cold balancing and rampant bugs and failure to get a functioning game more often than not.
---
I'm not going to break chase to go after a trapped survivor. That wastes so much more time. Survivors now for some reason think it's funny to chase behind me when I'm in the middle of a chase with someone else... Little do they know that I have a 200$ headset setup and can hear them the whole time they think they're being slick or funny. Occasionally I'll spin around and smack them real fast so they know I know. People like that will abuse/exploit the timer mechanic and just hang around the killer so the timer never drops until they get to their box. On small maps you can power through 3 or 4 gens and never have to give a fuck a trap is even on your head because you'll be in the pigs TR more than 90% of the match. This makes her own map pointless as fuck.
---
Wasn’t frosty eyes but actually had a game where I used devour to mori everyone as spirit. Was also running BBQ and M&amp;A with prayer beads and mother daughter ring. Fun game.
---
Well..psychopaths give 0 fucks lol
---
ok real fucking talk people.
---
I've been using WoO for ages now for this very reason. If you get this patched i will find you and I will hook you.
---
Thanus
---
I prefer Lithe, personally.
---
What did they do to her
---
Ah fuck, I was like: Spoilers? For the endgame collapse? Dafuq? And I read it. Now there is one guy more on my "I hate you" list
---
Entity Displeased doesn't mean that the survivors scaped. It means you played badly.
---
You're assuming that the survivors would just stand still and let things happen, they'd communicate what they know with eachother, they'd be experienced with the kind of overall behavior that these killers show, Leatherface, Hillbilly, Huntress, Spirit, Hag, Wraith, Nurse, Plague and Myers are all very simplistic with their desire to kill, they don't really "think" as much as the other ones, they're somewhat predictable, they're also the ones who are usually brutes, they're not real "thinkers" in regards to what people might be doing, I'd think the survivors would just avoid them or pick them off one by one.
---
As for people like Legion, Clown, Amanda, Freddy and Doctor, I'd say those are the most dangerous in regards to taking down what would be an otherwise coordinated group of 5 incredibly experienced survivors, they're the ones who would be trying to be clever about the way they tackle them, they're just as aware of the survivors' experiences as the survivors are aware of their intelligence.
---
I just keep playing dude. You have to keep trying.
---
They play Fortnite
---
Had a teammate doing this the other day against an insidious p3 bubba with noed and a red mori. Unfortunately he died being camped the whole time but we knew bubba was camping cause of it and knocked out the gens quick. he only got the one kill. Rip
---
I agree with you, a professional nurse would be pratically unbeatable. But this same argument could be used for every killer really; Any professional killer would be a pain to go against. This argument could even be used for survivors; a good team would be able to defeat a professional nurse.
---
I don't think that's a good change either because of the fact that coldwind would make nurse absolutely lost.
---
*ATTENTION*
---
Dedicated servers are currently not live. They well be enabled in the backend later today. No update will be required when this happens.
---
They're never strong enough though to completely invalidate a killer though unless it's someone like Trapper/ Hag/ Freddy
---
My experience at Rank 1 isn't that competitive as both killer and survivor.
---
I have been there. The only thing i can tell you is that eventually you will git gud and you will feed on other players salt when you stomp them.
---
Hitboxes aren't an issue, that's latency, which will be fixed with dedicated servers, which are coming this summer, along with a Freddy rework that we'll be getting news about next month :thinking:
---
I know they have bad ping but at the end of the day they are just trying to play the game like us, albeit with a shitty ~government~ internet
---
yeah i agree just saying that i didn’t say anything about breaking chase, just that you’ll know if someone is near you with a ticking trap because it stopped ticking, and if you have monitor and abuse you can make it a small area where it’ll be easy to find them
---
BRINGING A SMALL CHARGE ADD ON LIKE ONLY ADDING 8 CHARGES LETS YOU HEAL THEN KEEP THE MEDKIT, I USE IT FOR YELLOW MEDKITS ALL THE TIME.
---
That really really really hurt my feelings.
---
Got irritated after i noticed that you had rancor..
---
WOW GREAT! Where is Pig?
---
Good advice! I love portal haven't played in forever. Might have to cop. And that's funny I didn't even think about changing struggle to m1 I changed it to ' or something like that. Yeah I guess I just need to be practicing. Thanks for the advice! Any advice on the mouse to A to D ratio? Should I rely more on my mouse for camera or a and d?
---
The ptb cams out 2 fucking days ago
---
How dumb you got to be to believe its out allready?
---
if you almost complete the animation it means 'come and get me'
---
if you tap it regularly to get the 'flapping' animation then THAT means you're being camped
---
I'm scared to try killer I can't even chase as survivor right now lol
---
Thicc boi good,
---
Legion pre nerf bad,
---
Nuff said
---
I don't think they're going to un-nerf her.
---
I asked when it goes out fuckhead
---
Um all killer mains that stream said legion is fine.  I think he looks more fun.. base speed is fast and you get to stab people so they have to mend and not do gens.  Seems like that's how they intended him to be played. 
---
Killermians take advantage of exploits and then get pissy when they fix them.. hmmm🤔🤔🤔
---
SLOW DOWN GENS SO NOT HAVING RUIN IS A DEATH SENTENCE, PUTTING ON EARLY GAME PRESSURE IS PRETTY LUCK BASED ON YOUR SPEED AT FINDING AND DOWNING THE SURVIVOR WITHOUT RUIN.
---
Killers are learning to fight fire with fire.
---
I heard Waluigi.
---
No? If you have to search one box then why not just not use traps. This is worse than what they’re actually doing
---
Yeah my bad, so now it drains the power even when you are not using it? That sucks
---
Wow Jane Romero drew this! I don't even know how that could be accomplished but damn is she good
---
Sorry man. My message came off a little more harsh than it actually was.
---
THEY DONT HAVE THEIR SPECIAL RED BADGE TO HOLD ON TO, MAKING FUN AND BP THE FACTOR FOR SASIFACTION.
---
what an idiot even i wouldnt be this stupid
---
Looks like a cosmetic from Android become human
---
I’ve gone against a really good nurse of Xbox and I was trying to give her the rundown. Usually I can run a Nurse all game but this dude got me in 2 gens. So I was surprised a lot and messaged the guy because he only had 50 hours with 2 killer achievements. He told me was on mouse and keyboard. I felt hurt right there
---
What? No. Too easy to confuse the 2.
---
Patiently wait and do nothing = come get me
---
Flappy bird = do gens, being camped
---
oh sweet, Legion can search lockers while in Frenzy again, i actually complained about that earlier, maybe the devs actually saw it
---
Yeah and that logic would hold if this was a competitive game with a competitive game mode. But it isn't. The point of the game is to have fun right? Well what the point in kicking someone when they are down, especially when they are playing the role which is meant to be the overpowered, dominant role of the game and they are routinely screwed over by poor and inconsistent balance configs. 
---
All I'm saying is that they game doesn't need to have to make a big hoopla just cause you decided to use a play style that leads to more fun for all. 
---
FYi: Also personal attacks are a pretty poor way of trying to valid your point. If you had to be beyond a point of maturity to play games online, the community would never had existed 👌
---
Slighlty late, but ...yes. Anything involving few parties trying to counteract each other is a competition.
---
The terror radius one can actually be used to find them
---
I am good just not with spirit :((
---
It made playing her kind of unplayable, im worried if that bug stays in itll kick legion really hard
---
IF YOU GET THE KILLERS ATTENTION WHEN EXIT GATES ARE OPEN, PREPARE FOR THEM TO YOU KNOW, TRY TO KILL YOU.
---
First, I didn’t make this post. Second, that is exactly why I don’t play with noed. Third, my pig games go horribly unless I’m on an indoor map. This and the community’s general consensus on the pig as one of the weakest killers in DBD would point to us wanting a buff to the pig. I am fine with this being how helmets work but can we please get 100% or more crouched movement speed?
---
If you can run from a Nurse - Again, I don't imagine you've met a very good one.
---
Bruh, have you seen the newest ranking system... if survivors are using crutch perks then you kinda have to play like a pure cunt to safety at purple/red ranks.
---
"The devs cater only to killers!" - Litterally No one.
---
/rbeetlejuicing
---
Guess they had to nerf legion even more
---
Only like 50% of his changes eliminate unfair part of gameplay and make him ~okay killer. 
---
But there are some unnecessary which ruin him:
---
-Slower vaulting speed in frenzy (I don't want to waste time describing how bad it is, so I'll just give you an example of it: if survivor will jump over pallet and make a circle to jimp over it again, legion will not be able to hit him in frenzy, as he loses so much time vaulting and following the survivor that he is able to jump again and so on.)
---
-Stuns set powet gauge to 0 
---
- Frank's mixtape ruined (they could rework it to make it strong, but balanced, yet they decided to make it useless)
---
-you're unnable to chain hits as frenzy doesn't give you enough speed 
---
-20 sec cd, inability to use frenzy until fully charged. This is just a joke. This is another nail into chained hits coffin
---
-ruined pins (not as if we cared too much about them, but also hurts)
---
-can't see deep wound timer progress. (They are taking another piece of information away from killers. Gj)
---
On top of that legion is now stricted to only 1 strategy, which is chain hitting (useless since you'll never chain more than 2 hits/1 hit if they run opposite directions, until they stand still/run same direction. 
---
But hey, at least he's not that annoying as he was. Still annoying piece of crap, but now with power that gives him less advantage then Jigsaw baptism or wraith's bell.
---
I should also mention remember me nerf, 15 seconds to open gates instead of 20. 
---
AND ALL THIS JUST FOR A MECHANIC THAT PREVENTS G R I E F I N G FROM SURVIVORS AND FORCES THEM TO LEAVE KILLER ALONE.
---
GREAT!!!
---
Removed - Author request.
---
Camping is not a thing either we just ensure a kill after all.
---
replying is toxic? lol and he is not even being disrespectful at all
---
God this sub has become such shit.
---
I'm surprised there are no Russian and Chinese servers. The Russian playerbase is more than large enough to warrant having at least one server of its own, and wasn't China kind of a big deal for BHVR, too? They've catered to them on various occasions, such as Doctor having his origins in a fan contest on a Chinese forum, Chinese exclusive cosmetics, and all this Chinese New Year stuff.
---
That's why you need kindered if you want to help your team on that.
---
the thing that scares me about asking for commissions is what if what was in my head is better than the final product
---
They delivered on what i asked for and ill pay em
---
but I'll always secretly hate it
---
of course theres an equal chance itll be better than what i imagined but im a Negative Nancy :/
---
He was doing his fair share of BM before too. Nodding and shaking his head at whoever he downed. This guy knew exactly what he was doing and I wasn’t having it. He may not have known how to play Legion, but he knows how to play the game
---
I cant decide if I like it or not
---
Shes fun. Put in time, and also watch how she plays on some YouTube vids. 
---
That said, shit man... I had a match last night where 3 people dc'd just to give a 4th the hatch and save their items.
---
Disconnecting needs to be punished with temp. bans and item loss. Killers dont keep their addons  during disconnects, neither should survivors.
---
Oh nice they shortened the timer, seemed slightly too long from what Iv'e seen, big ups
---
Whats wrong here?
---
Killers have never controlled the game. How can you pressure 4 people at once?
---
Such an awesome skin
---
#PrayforAmanda
---
i would prefer making her ambush more potent because its more consistent once you use her traps they just gone most of the time
---
In theory yes. Overwatch STARTED this way and if Blizzard turned out to be too lazy to continue it then I have extremely low hopes for BHVR.
---
Same
---
I 100% agree but all they needed to do was pause/heavily slow timer when a RBT is on their head rather than just making her traps useless
---
Wait, are those nerfs to the cool down add-ons? less time taken off of the fatigue?
---
I used to see it that way but on PS4 everyone seems to do it the other way around so now I just wave about if I want you to unhook me
---
I'm just happy almost nobody ever complains about my killer "mains". Then again, I never saw people complaining much about Pig either, so I guess nobody is safe.
---
Please dont, stop targeting the fun mid tier killers, please.
---
I played Nurse for a bit, I was on and off with her.
---
Sometimes I would fuckin slam with her so hard that my friends were scared to go up against me in Kill your Friends.
---
Other times I couldn't hit anyone.
---
But I find Doctor more fun.
---
That’s a great attitude! There are a lot of survivors who will either d/c or just kill themselves on hook when this happens which makes the game even more unfun for people. The fact that you’re still willing to try in these situations is a great attribute
---
Kindered perk helps out. Your teammates see each other's aura [2 or all, depending on the tier level] when hooked and it lets them see the killer's aura if they are close enough to you hooked. If the are far away that you don't see their aura, let the terror radius help you on how close they are..... unless they have the Insidious perk......
---
I have all 57 perks at tier 3. I main pig and only the pig. I'm not a killer main or a survivor main. I play both just about equally but when I do play killer, unless I'm doing a daily, you'll never see me use anything other than piggy. I don't use m&amp;a with whispers as much anymore especially with plagues new perks. I've actually been increasing the size of my TR for the deviousness boost with distressing because lets face it, she lacks in that area even if you do everything right and I follow that perk up with infectious fright. It's like having ruin without the survivors being able to destroy your perk because they never know if you're coming or going and if you're chasing someone and down them it exposes the ones on gens and they run off of them. If they stay you already know where to go if there's more than 1 on them. 
---
The other killers and new killers only exist to give my pig new perks. I've played some plague matches though. I like her. She's a little on the cheapo side of things if you know how to run loops as a killer. Pretty much an instant tier 3 Myers if you have good aim and good add-ons. Idk, imo she's not exactly fair for survivors if you know what you're doing. Kinda like a nurse main using ruin type of not fair or fun. I like fun matches and I like trying to make them as fair as possible because I'm on the game to have fun afterall. 😀
---
honestly the BHVR devs are the Entity by now
---
This is how me and my friends even played this game.
---
Thanks for the tips! Always glad to learn new things to improve my gameplay!
---
I think it’s because most of us from PC that played in the beginning are still sticking to it.
---
Ita fine. I main killer tbh. I just hate how my team goes for all gems before I can get all totems. And I got rancored 10games in a row so it might have influenced my.post.
---
Im glad you agree most people i try to explain that pig needs something just kinda go REEEEEE.
---
YOU HAVE TO TONE IT DOWN TO GET SEVERAL HOOKS AND RUN FAR AWAY TO LET THEM SAVE. ALSO USE YOUR ABILTY MORE TO FARM SOME MORE PIP PROGRESS AND BP, ITS WHAT WE ALL HAVE TO DO.
---
Does it really matter? It is a horror game it isn't going to be nice and its just a way to differentiate how well you did in the game. If it upsets you that much just skip to the next page or leave the after game report if you feel you did bad so you won't see it.
---
I agree with the “come and get me”, that’s always made teammates drop a gem and decide oh I guess it’s safe. How did we all form these quiet collective consciousnesses LOL
---
They should.
---
Cute, this is how I felt playing my first few matches against Myers, and when I saw that Ash was announced too.
---
The traps will stop them from leaving the trial  , now instead of running out of the exit gates with a trap on (0 searches) you have to complete one search.
---
Changed the opening exit gate time for Survivors from 15 seconds back to 20 seconds.
---
Decreased the End Game Collapse timer duration from 3 minutes to 2 minutes.
---
Fuck yeah!!!
---
...muh piggy tho... #PrayForPig
---
I wave my arms to tell someone to save me, if no one is coming
---
I hate this, rng is the entire damn point of the reverse bear trap after all
---
i see that wasn't your intention but all i can see is a bad salty killer on the other end of that chat
---
4 seconds base fatigue and now that....
---
Trapper easily, its like knowing what people are going to do before they even think of it themselves.
---
Not in all cases. Some psychopaths have issues with being viewed as “competent, valuable, useful to the people around me so I look good” so it could be that that would actually make him more antsy.
---
They shouldn't have changed her this way, should've just made the traps slow down the end game timer imo.
---
No killer is OP. The only killer who could be percieved as OP is nurse. And she has to deal with dead zones, fatigue, and just general survival movements. Thats why its dumb to super nerf killers. Im not saying you cant change them but sometimes bhvr just gets a little zealous.
---
Yeah..... it's annoying..... also, console has Ruin...... I had a 4 hr game session one night 90% of the killers had Ruin....... and no one was able to find that stupid hex......
---
A whole lot. Herding is very important to Amanda. Keeping survs away from boxes when their trap is active is a crucial way to play. The TR changes will make it much harder to herd effectively, as there is no more tension when u r in a box when her heartbeat is heard, because if she’s in tr, ur trap stops. Sure crouching can work to sneak up on them, but sometimes that’s not an option. Also her endgame is gone.
---
I don’t mind Legions that play exactly how they’re supposed to play. As annoying as it can be at times, I know it’s exactly how the devs intended on Legion working (hitting as many people as possible to make them mend/stop doing things) and I can’t get mad at that.
---
Will it be region locked? I'm in Asia but mostly play with someone in EU, which server would the game use? I hope it favors the server of the person who sent out the invites.
---
WTF all those new issues though. Jesus if they’re known issues how about laying off testing the servers and fix them first.
---
Very, very sad oink.
---
Nobody fucking knows, and if we knew dont you think there would be an announcement of it?
---
This is consistent with the movie Amanda too - the moment you wake up and start moving, things start ticking.
---
No one escapes death.
---
Usually you follow them through the process so you can make changes to confirm it is as close to your vision as possible.
---
If you run a Mori you deserve treatment you get. 
---
I've always felt the toxicity or one side controls the other. Eg. If I'm a SWF with 2 x clicki boi's and 2 x insta-heal I expect the killer to use whatever tactics they want. 
---
If a killer is running a mori or is tunnelling then expect the survivors to play however the fuck they want. 
---
In short -  if you're impersonating a cunt, don't complaint when you get fucked by a dick.
---
This has such cool story and mood behind it! I love the lighting and the hands in particular.
---
I too didn't try this game until I was given it for free on the PS4. Tried it, now I'm hooked.
---
They definitely won’t be changing her back now. They just reduced the EGC timer to 2 minutes. It would be extremely broken to revert her traps back to the way they were.
---
Most Freddy’s have a tendency to put someone to sleep and then tunnel them to death. If you’re asleep you literally cannot get away from him due to his ability to see you and he’s free to just tunnel you until he gets you or decides on his own to leave you for someone else.  On top of that trying to wake up when you can’t find a teammate is more annoying than mending is because it’s solely RNG based. Mending can be annoying but at least you can tell when you’ll be done with it. The amount of time taken up by trying to heal yourself or on a gen is immeasurable because it’s random, and I swear I’ve worked on a gen for a full minute without a skill check and also healed myself fully without one as well. There’s also an aspect of like not being able to see or tell where he is initially unless you happen to see fucking grass move to avoid being put to sleep that kind of irks me. I also like to run Dark Sense a lot, and Freddy is the only killer who it doesn’t work with so it’s a fun completely wasted perk slot when that happens. All in all it’s not hard to win against Freddy if he’s not good and you can loop him, but I never find Freddy games enjoyable because of these factors.
---
Monto: Hey CD Legion is still pretty viable
---
Behaviour: What did you just say?
---
on the internet, lots of people do
---
i get that its cheaper. but quality over quantity
---
Regardless if killers do some favors or not the survivors will still expect you to play by their rules anyway.
---
I’ve seen this excuse before, and it’s a stupid logic. First, the trap must be active to even locate them this way. 2nd this strategy also alerts survivors more to your presence, as the timer suddenly stops. 3rd, it disables the timer! U don’t even have to be aware of the other survivors presence for it to be disabled!
---
It was a baby legion, there is no point on being toxic with him
---
I thought he was a beginner at first too, but he was just a scummy player and knew all the ways to bm as killer (nodding/shaking his head when downing someone, standing over someone after he downed them and repeatedly stabbing the air with Frenzy) so now I’m thinking he either de-ranked or this is how he always plays so he never pips. Either way, you’re right, he did deserve what happened
---
They definitely wont unnerf the pig with egc ay only 2 min now
---
😏😏
---
Some of the "known issues" are pretty bad - regardless of the Pig and Legion, this can't go forward yet.
---
&gt; The match will not be cancelled if one or more Survivors get disconnected.
---
&gt; The Shape can no longer stalk when Evil Within is interrupted by a firecracker item.
---
&gt; The Corrupted Intervention perk does not prevent Survivors from working on generators.
---
&gt; Killers walking on a destroyed totem causes multiple issues including teleportation and loss of using certain actions.
---
Etc.
---
But rng isn't always the best the way to deal with this particular aspect of game design.
---
I ask you what is the point of the RBT?
---
To kill or slow down?
---
If you say to kill , you'd be wrong because it's incredibly rare for beartraps to kill and the 2+ minutes you get to search boxes will always be enough time to get the trap off.
---
If you say to slow down , you'd be less wrong because it's really inconsistent at slowing things down because in one part of the rng , it's really hard to gauge how much a beartraps is worth.
---
wholesome.
---
:O forrealsies? Forreals and not forfakes?!
---
I don’t play surv. I don’t find survivor play style to be fun or rewarding
---
Not all of them, no. But an average one, yes.
---
But I don't think you play only against professional nurses either, and know how not always nurses are "unbeatable".
---
This post is cringeworthy and an embarrassment to killers. Either you DON'T care if the survivors escape, in which case you should ignore the post game message because apparently you are just "making sure they have a nice time". 
---
Or you actually DO care about getting kills and you aren't very good at killing things. Try playing a new killer or use some new perks or tactics because this game doesn't sound like its for you at the moment.
---
Very few nurses are so godly you can’t do anything, but they have 1000’s off hours playing that one single killer so it’s their sacrifice. I agree that the nurse isn’t op.
---
i personally think it's difficult to confuse the two because if I see them trying to unhook themselves it's literally like they are saying 'GET ME OFF THIS HOOK'.
---
But let's concentrate on what we agree with
---
Flappy bird = stay away.
---
As if this wasnt already common knowledge?
---
He knew exactly what he was doing. While he may not know how to play Legion, he knows how to play killer and he mechanics of the game. Before the video started he was nodding and shaking his head at people on the ground and on hooks. He knew exactly how to make survivors mad
---
Lol same. They hookbombed me and failed. Then one teabagger downed at gate and missed the exit threshold!
---
Youre a little bit slow I guess, how am I supposed to know that nobody knows, thats why I asked
---
YES, they better change her back. either make EGC 1second or buff Pig.
---
How do you kill which that has no life?
---
Well I’m noticing everyone who says they like to save a trap for endgame is getting downvoted so I might as well join club. Yeah, I try to save a trap for endgame and if I bring an extra trap it’s explicitly for that purpose. Too many altruistic fools insistent on getting everyone out, especially on Xbox where SWF makes up 60-70% of my games. Pretty easy to convert that trap into at least one kill.
---
Under "Dedicated Servers" known issue:
---
&gt;The Rite of the Plague Daily Ritual cannot be unlocked.
---
Does this mean... They actually tested the dailies out on the dedicated servers? BHVR actually went out of their way this time... to test things intricately? It can't be!
---
Jane did a show on Bulimia, she can help
---
That's how it usually goes.  The PTB is more a preview than an actual feedback gathering tool.
---
At most, numerical values will get changed, nothing requiring actual development work will be touched.
---
Well it kinda doesn't mean anything if they haven't said anything about it? I mean okay recently they have started a Dev update thing that hopefully will be monthly, but they simply cannot revert this change due to its implications on how it would work in the end game.
---
I don't mean this lightly, but I assume that the endgame never had a "full" build that was similar to this with the old Pig and new Legion etc, so I wouldn't even think it's possible to revert and test how it would be.
---
I am on the side of wanting the RBT situation back, and the only way I can stomach these RBT changes is if the End Game timer was a lot shorter, maybe half the length it is now. 3 minutes is a hell of a long time and it's kinda shitty the way that The Pig will solely require on Perks at the end game rather than having the traps to buy time. As someone said previously:
---
A piggy without end game ain't no piggy.
---
That's the problem with this game ATM. The amount of skill needed to be a red rank survivor does not equal a red rank killer. (However that doesn't mean survivor is easy, it's still pretty hard if the killer had good perks). I don't know how to fix this disparity other than making it so killer rank doesn't have a cap and goes up instead of down. That way there's a plateau for survivors skill and you'll get a mixed bag of good and bad, while there won't be a mixed bag of killers. Killers will eventually reach some god tier status like rank 30 or whatever it would come to, and they'd be paired against said mixed bag, making it more fair and so they don't have to rely on nurse.
---
That said, I'm not trying to flex, but I don't even entirely think nurse is mandatory at this point. Surveillance, discordance, ruin, and bbq will destroy literally any team so long as you don't tunnel the whole game and constantly bounce from gen to get weakening them all down until they're either too intent on healing, or too annoyed to heal so they attempt gens. In my opinion it's not rocket science.
---
WHILE I AGREE ITS REALLY KINDA A 50/50. HE DID GET A NIC ME BUFF BUT ONLY NEEDED LIKE 2 OF HIS 10 CHANGES AND HE WOULDVE BEEN LIT
---
I feel attacked
---
I think that would make nurse less fun and rewarding, that's just me.
---
[deleted]
---
ahh, another day in the salt mines. it's good work.
---
Maybe it’s the nurse needing nerf?, cause she doesn’t 😁
---
NOED? ON A NURSE? YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE DC'S. Except they only did 3 gens so you're ok in my books
---
&gt;I wouldn't call it a nerf to the pig. It's more like digging a hole 30 feet deep and throwing the pig into it and burying it alive.
---
This made me laugh
---
I'd say refert the changes back and make it so RBT slows down the timer.
---
i love the dbd pun
---
IM ACTUALLY APPALLED THAT KILLERS ARE GETTING THE SHORT END OF THE FUCKSTICK BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THE DEVS CREATED, WHILE METTLE OF MAN AND ADRENALINE EXIST. FOR FUCKS SAKE.
---
You still got the game
---
They have 5 minutes to live...I mean why not.
---
I don't think it is, because even at rank 1 I see a lot of survivors trying to drop pallets and loop me regularly.
---
Be confident in your intro
---
not just thay but opening the gate is even faster. Theres no way to protect both gates
---
You're welcome
---
Trappers new cosmetic will actually be useful in the salt mines.
---
Good survivors rarely give a Myers the time needed to hit ew3 and remake that short distance they lose when tiering up without being at a pallet or window, as said before.
---
That's a yikes from me, dawg.
---
Poor upside down people
---
&gt; Also how often do you put a trap on a survivor after the generators are done?
---
Against hyper-altruistic SWFs, this is usually a necessity. They'll do gens in a way I can't always stop, but I can get someone down and put a hat on him. If you're being swarmed with survivors, you can just leave the trapped guy on the ground and start a second chase. And they usually weren't expecting a chase, because they thought you'd hook and camp the trapped Dwight. It gives the Dwight a second chance, creates another chase, gives me possibly two kills if I do it well, gives them more survivors if _they_ do it well...
---
Now? I'll probably hook and camp the Dwight without putting a hat on him.
---
Good change. /s
---
So, well done then 🤣🤣🤣
---
So then tunneling and camping aren't a thing, right? Cus killers have a main goal, kill
---
You're so right. When you have a overpowered killer you have two options. Make it weaker and less rewarding, or make literally every other character stronger and *more* rewarding. The problem? The latter would make killers unhappy, and the former would make survivors unhappy. There is no winning. The only kinda middle ground is just making every killer *fun* versus viable, because it makes it so while yes, it's harder, you losing gets cancelled out by having a good time by messing around. This approach is impossible to take, and even if done, the community will obviously be bipolar on what is or isn't fun far more than what is or isn't op.
---
Sorry man, I totally lmfao picturing this 😂😂😂
---
Looks like somebody is running Slippery Meat
---
Your job as a killer is to kill the survivors, if you play by imaginary rules you are not gonna have a fun time. 
---
Just consider the following: 
---
\-Dont face camp (ot fun for you or the survivor in the hook, this is common sense)
---
\-Try not to tunnel on purpose (downing 1 survivor after "light camping" waiting for the unhook ) if by chance you find them after the unhook, too bad for them, you are not obliged to ignore them.
---
\- Dont DC even if they are destroying you, if they are better than you, too bad, deal with it and get better.
---
\- Golden rule - Dont be a dick.
---
I think that is regular etiquete when playing competitive games, other arbitrary rules are nonsense.
---
I so tought the totem would get broken right after the person got unhooked
---
Our baby is dying, and all we can do is try to convince them to not kill her
---
It's both
---
Don't think anyone gets it though. 4/5 games if I'm getting camped, I wave my arms around and 3 claudettes/dwights will still crouch move to me without urban evasion and rescue me only to get someone else, or me again, slaughtered.
---
How’d they buff nurse?
---
When did they say that?
---
Can't say that. Killers need to have higher standards. I can't stand these rules people give each other
---
Really gave me that connor feel, Detroit become human was an amazing game
---
I ran kindred thinking it'd help tell my team to not have a clash of who's going for save, but sadly, I wasted my perk slot, because once one person is on hook, it is EVERYONE'S duty to go for save.
---
That was also my thought. I was playing with my friend and he told me he was about 30 seconds from finishing that last gen, and throwing that down/stunning him would have given me enough time to escape and get my Adrenaline to go off. Didn’t even even make it to endgame though haha
---
I stopped for a while, I'm starting to play again.
---
I'm literally 1 trophy away from plat, its "Sacrifice 500 survivors" and I hate it. I have no idea how many survivors I've killed.
---
Just an FYI, you use ‘an’ not ‘a’ in front of words that start with a vowel.
---
I dont understand why pig got a nerf? A good killer off the bat are characters who's powers help in the chase or tracking. (nurse, billy, huntress and spirit)
---
like OP said, the RBT is meant to slow down the game so the pig can get more hooks by the end of the match. While i do agree the RBT require bits of RNG, Ive had games where when i got trapped i had to search through all 4 boxes, I wasnt being chased meaning my timer constantly ticked down. Through no fault of my own I died. 
---
I strongly agree with OPS proposal.
---
Yeh, its why I run sprintburst in solo que, I dont gotta be faster than killer just faster than potatoes
---
I’ve never had fried bananas, but now I really want to try one.
---
Well I'm from Texas and people call me out on it, especially in the internet. So I was just curious.
---
90% of Wraith mains
---
50% of Leatherface mains
---
20% of Hillbilly mains
---
It’s what happened to Freddy on a whole new scale...
---
Delete this post. It is against the rules.
---
Nice try. Australia isn't real it's just a hoax.
---
&gt;either make EGC 1second
---
Er, you meant 1 minute?
---
I'd remove the vaulting speed penalty, it feels unnecessary.
---
Damn. Reeled him in and caught that ass
---
That's hilarious as hell.
---
You use a great Nurse build mine is, Predator and Bloodhound for tracking the survivors (I keep losing the survivors after I hit them, somehow) Shadowborne so I can see better when I blink and Ruin, because I get gen rushed all the time.
---
Face camping isn't bannable you uneducated dick  nugget
---
But shouldn't the devs be trying to support multiple play styles instead of taking then away?
---
The problem with “playing nice”, is it gives survivors (especially newbs) a construed view of what tunneling actually is. Therefore, “literally every game” has “tunneling campers” when the truth is survivors can force a tunnel, yet they still blame a killer.
---
The quotes were from a lot of post I see that mention that sort of thing.
---
It was even worse early last year, couldn’t go two matches without a facecamp regardless of rank.

[Me right now](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510702139757297674/570986952736636971/unknown.png)
---
I once had a survivor tell me I was a scary Myers.
---
whenever a survivor's a dick, I remember that some of them play for the same reason I do.
---
Wake up isn't really even much better now since it's a % reduction, so you'd shave about 2 seconds or so over 3. I'd love to see both perks become viable but I doubt either will get reworked at this rate.
---
100% of pig mains
---
It’s always the frosty eyes. Always
---
Teabagging is BM tho
---
As is facecamping, obviously
---
How often were you able to use your saved trap if you had to give an estimated percentage?
---
It was pretty nice. It was at a Korean BBQ too
---
Be careful with what you wish for. They might do the same as they did with the haddonfield into music
---
&gt;Changed the opening exit gate time for Survivors from 15 seconds back to 20 seconds.
---
Good, but no Remember Me reversion?
---
&gt;Decreased the End Game Collapse timer duration from 3 minutes to 2 minutes.
---
Alright.
---
&gt;The Legion can search lockers while in Feral Frenzy.
---
Understandable. Still missing other Feral Frenzy adjustments, personally: vault speed changes should be reverted, instead draining some additional Frenzy for vault actions; not seeing blood in Frenzy is a little unnecessary of a nerf; missed Frenzy hits should only drain part of the Frenzy, and/or cause a regular missed attack cooldown, rather than ending Frenzy; hitting a survivor while not in Frenzy should not drain the Frenzy bar at all.
---
&gt;Adjusted the values for The Legion's fatigue-reducing add-ons
---
I find this disappointing. Cold Dirt now is only 100 milliseconds better than Joey's Mixtape... With the base fatigue time increase, I don't feel like these add-ons were as overtuned as these adjustments assume them to have been.
---
But if you are able to down someone in end game and put a trap on them wouldn't that mean you also got them on a hook?
---
Now that I've seen the movie, I'm pretty sure Rin was based off of The Grudge.
---
I am a nurse main and I absolutely love fighting other good nurses. It’s really the only challenge in the game. Fighting the nurse actually feels intense, it keeps you on your feet, and the mind games are fun (especially because i know how a nurse player thinks). I wish fighting every killer was as intense as fighting the Nurse.
---
Predator is just useless. Bloodhound could be ok but i cant use it properly. I suggest change predator for bbq or sloppy butcher (combo whit bloodhound)
---
Ikr?
---
Community: Legion's too weak
---
BHVR: Nah, they still have legs.
---
*Power saw starts up*
---
the end game timer is 2 minutes now. atleast theres some good news
---
Female Even More Angry Waluigi
---
BuT SuRViVOr TOxiC MAn
---
As SuRV MAiN I SaID "THanK YoU kIlLeRS"
---
Looks fake AF.
---
It isn't against the rules to camp...
---
You can have free speech but that doesn’t mean people have to like it
---
It got buffed a while back. The killer aura gets revealed from further away and at all tiers, it reveals the aura's of all survivors
---
Do you think that people will still come to save hooked Dwight? And what changes do you think shouldn't be made?
---
:(
---
i mean, you can see when your timer isnt ticking down on someone (see: in your terror radius), so you basically have a survivor radar now
---
damn, can I have some of that salt for my fries?
---
Face Camping isnt bannable, false Reports however are
---
there, this is the right link, ignore the previous post
---
Meg main big brain out here DOIN WORK
---
&gt;[...]this initial test will be limited to approximately 500 players per data center at any given time.
---
Oh boy...
---
So what happens now if the killer disconnects does the match still just end?
---
lmao lol this joke is really an advanced one, the joke is that the legion and doctor are both happy and smiling and the spirit (killer from day by lightdead)(a big boy game) is angryed and is the mom angry about the joke, the guest is Dwight from day by dead light day and he is dying on the meat hook featured within the game.
---
Looks like I'm the brother.
---
Just cos you complain about it doesn't mean the change is bad for the game?? its literally to prevent a pig holding you hostage at endgame where you either die to the trap or the entity.
---
At least revert the terror radius change!
---
Yes, you should clarify this anyways because some of them go about it different ways but yeah.
---
She’ll be the only one on a hook tonight ;)
---
If it follows previous PTB scedules then May 7th
---
then they create a YouTube Channel and lose Nr.1 spot to an indian music company :/
---
i wave my arms because im bored
---
It goes both ways i was kidding.
---
True, but you cant deny that it doesnt in fact do that.
---
And honestly Legion is nothing like Ghostface. 3 of the seven Ghostface killers weren’t even teenagers, and their lore is entirely different. Plus Legion is all about rushing people, Ghostface is a “stealth” killer.
---
Also the guest is **hooked** on a feeling... Cause he's alone and he's like "c'mon guys, don't leave me **hanging** !"
---
Because you never derank if you dc when you know it’s a bad game for you. You get downed first, Nurse, tunneled etc.
---
Limiting her to max 2 blinks and nerfing most of her addons is a good start
---
You haven’t been here long enough then.
---
That’s not the point. The point is that the tactic of using traps to track is so fucking worthless, that the excuse is grasping at straws
---
PRAYFORAMANDA
---
If its salt you need come play with me youll have anoef for the rest of your life
---
Swear it be like this. Don’t tunnel and when they manage to escape they teabag and gloat but when you tunnel once or twice because they literally unhook in front of you, get hate mail and called unfair/cheap. There is literally nothing good about most survivors
---
Are you really that dumb?
---
Still, once it procs the first time, you can play around it, and dash into a locker to preserve it next time. It's great for helping guess the killers whole perk loadout, and the added bonus of hiding your scratches while active is a nice bonus.
---
Says the one that created an account just to spoil the movie on a video game subreddit.
---
nope...1sec EGC or Pig buffed again.
---
I STILL FIND IT WEIRD WHEN I AGREE WITH SOMEONE ON HERE SO THOROUGHLY.
---
Nurse ignores all game mechanics. Especially with addons she is broken
---
Dont know, Im worried I might die of dehydration
---
that's a fancy knife ya got there.
---
So many people seem to forget that the other 3 people can leave and Pig would get 1 kill in a 3min game because she didn't use any RBT's.
---
100%
---
i feel the same. kind of disappointing how they didnt think it through. sure, it would've been a buff to her traps. we dont know how big of a buff that would've been (and won't know), but getting a pretty big nerf instead feels so bad lol
---
Fuck yeah Indiana-Ohio ping let's gooooo
---
Counter suggestion: Revert the Pig changes and have the timer slow down for everyone as though someone were downed/hooked when at least 1 survivor has a RBT on them.
---
Nurse shouldn't be nerfed as her ability actually requires players to learn before being able to play her to her full extent unlike legion who before the patch had no counter play but I can think of many ways to counter nurse
---
1 spine chill. It tells you when it's a good time to move 
---
2 hide. Nurse is slow hide around objects she won't have time to look around them all(unless baby nurse)
---
3 when In chance don't run in a straight line(yes it helps as it can throw off her aim)
---
4 her exhaustion stage can be a good time to hide
---
5 every play has an counter play so a God nurse can predict well and learn of your behaviour so stay unpredictable
---
Now I am a nurse main but I use these counter plays when I am playing survivor and at least half if them work and yes some require skill to pull off but it doesn't mean nurse Is op. 
---
Also devs seem to be listening to killers and survivors who can't even do a gen without blowing it up so nurse will be nerfed and a game will be dead
---
People don't seem to understand that the end game pig will never be a thing anymore. Not because they wanted to nerf the pig - but because they needed to completely rework the endgame.
---
Still will probably end but no one will lose progress, also the disconnect may be punished
---
what is p3
---
Look at the upvote and downvotes first to know a potential spoiler.
---
Get over it! They're not reverting the change just because an entire subreddit of neck bearded man babies are crying about it. Ffs.
---
I wouldn't be shocked either because they already confirmed that it wont be here. They are going to talk about it next month or so they said though.
---
She ignores every survivor defense unless you play like an immersed muppet and be useless all game. Rank 1 does not equal skill either, I’d love to see you go against a good Nurse like Zubat and “hold your own” lmao
---
Considering they said they wouldn't even be releasing information about the Freddy rework until next month it kind of makes sense that they wouldn't be releasing the rework on the mid-chapter patch...
---
With or without a hat, people will come to save him, but if he has a hat I'm far freer to actually chase someone away from the hook rather than just feinting and whacking anybody who gets too close. 
---
There's still an interesting game to be played if the hat keeps him in the game. If the hat _doesn't_ keep him in the game, then I'm just going to whack another stubborn survivor and put her on the hook in Dwight's place.
---
And then repeat if necessary. Kinda boring. Any killer can do this and everybody hates it. Now it's really my only option if I definitely want that one kill. Otherwise, I'm asking to be stomped by a healthy survivor's exhaustion perks and open door.
---
&gt; And what changes do you think shouldn't be made?
---
Nobody ought to waltz out of a gate with a hat on. As far as I know, there was never(?) a dud trap in the SAW franchise.
---
If we need to slow/pause the collapse timer, that's great. Make it easier to remove in the collapse? Neat! But don't just make the RBT a nice hat. Might as well make the huntress hatchets turn into butterflies halfway.
---
Trying to find reasonable points
---
Hey, I recognize that gay blowjob.
---
Hmm okay. I wish they change that then. With them doing that i could be okay with the changes
---
Holy shit, you complain too much. The key isn’t an issue, dude
---
Gitgud
---
“...we have made a lot of progress with the Freddy Rework in the last couple of months”
---
Mhmm
---
No if the nurse is good the only thing that screws her is the map fucking up her blinks. A good nurse cares about nothing in terms of game mechanics
---
Drawing the hag any other way would be inaccurate.
---
Press Alt+F4 to Feral Frenzy.
---
&gt; Pallets, windows and structures are completely useless against her.
---
Yes, but in return things that are completely useless against other killers (literally anything that breaks line of sight without granting significant distance) are good against her.
---
She's probably too strong, but I'll happily give that up once the game is either balanced such that SWF isn't game-breaking or I get bonus bp for playing against them.
---
Your right but did you see the frame rate before the plague update that's what I call nearly unplayable it's stupid that they even released it in that state.
---
&gt;This change just feels like it was a three minute discussion at a meeting with no testing done or metrics considered.
---
It's called PTB, which stands for "Player TEST Build". They're testing and gathering data right now. They probably don't want to turn her into a niche killer since she'd have a clear advantage over other killers by saving her traps until the endgame, which was not the purpose of her ability. It's a time waster ability, not something to use to guarantee kills.
---
Gonna be honest i hate this more than the current changes. It makes pig way worse for the whole game
---
Sure! Just PM your Steam &amp; Discord name
---
How?
---
To quote the great Prussian psychologist and landscape architect, Friedrich Karl Krüger, “Bitch!”
---
That seems low at first glance but I would be surprised if that many people were even playing per data center on the PTB
---
Going to be waiting another year for it :(
---
You can use whatever you want. Nobody cares about what you think is terrible. I’ll use it all I want
---
BHVR lowered EGC to 2 minutes from 3 minutes which mean for sure Pig won't be reverted. Happy now?
---
Zubat is an amazing killer in general, and I would agree that the best killer in the game is the nurse. It wouldn't surprise me if he completely destroyed me playing as her especially because my survivor game isn't super strong. However, I don't think that's a great way to determine if she's broken, seeing as he's probably one of the most experienced players ever.
---
To be frank, he'll destroy you pretty much with any killer he'll play.
---
Or perhaps it's the fact that you say survivors can act like dicks but did you notice the fact that they didn't know I had a mori? I didn't kill a single one of them yet all of them teabagged me.
---
she's a basic bitch, smart Legion mains know Joe is the best
---
Please, she ignores every survivor mechanics (and we don't talk about all the op add-ons). I don't know how she can be nerfed without completely rework her, but then she won't be the nurse...
---
Something has to be changed, don't know what
---
It makes her boxes waste less time, I know the RNG  doesnt work properly but thats the games issue not the boxes themselves. It makes traps useless from the latter half of the match rather than just endgame
---
That was one of the major draws of endgame RBTs - you could slug someone, hat him, and then start another chase immediately without hooking the guy on the ground. He'd probably get healed and would start working on boxes, but he couldn't just run out a door.
---
Now, your only option is to hook and watch him. No more secondary chases unless someone insists on being so cocky near the hook that you think it's worth losing the guy on the hook.
---
I just ate and now I get to see this, great
---
NEW PLAYER HERE, I'M RANK 16 SURVIVOR, AND LIKE 18 ON KILLER. I WAS SUPER ANXIOUS AND WORRIED ABOUT ALL THE DC'S AND TOXICITY THAT I SEE ON THIS SUB, AND DURING STREAMS BUT EVERYONE IS REALLY NICE AND ALWAYS SAYS GG AFTER THE GAME. I THINK I ONLY HAD 1 KILLER FACE CAMP SO FAR.
---
chill out jesus i was just giving advice
---
listen kid you cant be banned for camping and no one cares you got camped, grow up.
---
I thought it doesn't work on addon's or powers.
---
Seriously, I don't get many facecamps at all. Sure, I get a few people here and there that don't leave the general area - had a legion camping pretty hard last night on the PTB... but I rarely get the in-your-face variety. I play about 10-12 hours a week.... usually hover around ranks 11-15... either I'm just lucky, I don't play enough, or my play style doesn't trigger this behavior. (I'm not a super looper, I suck at flashlights, and I never BM killers. Basically, I'm not that great lol)
---
That's my take on it as well. Tried playing nurse once, I think I landed maybe 2 or 3 hits the entire round. Played against a good nurse and it felt like they were cheating we were all hooked so fast.
---
I fucking love how every bug is killer related.
---
An idea I had was to increase the base range of her first blink, but make it so the followup blinks cannot pass through terrain. That way, a survivor can successfully misdirect the nurse around an obstacle without it not mattering due to multiple blinks, but the subsequent blinks would still be useful to the nurse for course correction.
---
Fair enough and thanks for the response. On the opposite side of this, I enjoy him because of his ability. I run monitor so I can see you closer because I am a poor tracker. Not being able to be seen is another plus that no one else has. In my experience, survivors run self heal so they break out of sleep so easily. I have ran the blue dress add on and it's like they get a skill check instantly. That is probably the most frustrating part about Freddy because if you can easily break out it is another 5-7 seconds you can run or loop me before I can do anything.
---
Is it? I don't get facecamped that often at all. Maybe once a month, tops.
---
Le Boo!
---
nurse is below freddy tier on console.
---
You know he had to do it to em.
---
Why nerf the Pig? She's not even OP or anything, I don't see anything wrong with her.
---
No, she is DUMMY THICC
---
Its even worse when you see them appear in your lobby again afterwards...then I just bring out my main and enjoy the salt
---
Just gonna throw this in, 
---
You can lightburn the nurse by using a flashlight on her hand while she’s charging a blink to force her into fatigue
---
BHVR lowered EGC to 2 minutes from 3 minutes and reverted exit gate change from 15 sec to 20 sec which means for sure Pig won't be reverted. Happy now?
---
People cant be banned for camping. So just quit it
---
Camping is only... ONLY for survivors you know, and who deserve it. They will know what they did to deserve it, if not in the moment... upon seeing who the killer is.  
---
If you come across a killer who shakes their head at you as you approach a camped hook... back away. It doesn't concern you, and your cooperation will be rewarded.
---
Haha nah the totem was right next to me
---
It makes sense in a way, as survivor has been playing in client config the whole time, but killers have always been host and are just now adapted to client.  I feel you, I do, but it does make rational sense in this case.
---
Oohhhh yea, I just didn’t want to risk it, I knew I had them all dead to rights. And I was trying to get the mori four survivors in one game trophy.
---
The legion is dipping into hype beast territory
---
Seriously. I bought the game on release day and shortly dropped it like a week after as survivors were OP to all fuck, now Killer gets the upper hand for a month or two and they are instantly brought in line
---
I think gens are getting done fast enough, thank you. Don’t need a SWFs bringing a 45% speed boost because they stack the perk.
---
This is how merciless killers are born. When I used to play killer it took me maybe a day worth of games like that to just simply not care about any of the survivor complaints.
---
They feel bad they got tunneled? Try hiding better. They feel like they got "camped" even though maybe there were survivors in the area or they were hooked in an area that was about to be 3 genned so no point in leaving? Still dont care.
---
I play survivor mostly now but under no circumstance is a killer ever supposed to be sympathetic to you not having fun over they themselves having fun.
---
i watched some of dunkey's overwatch videos and just from those couple of videos, it's put me off of ever wanting to play that game ever.
---
Sarcasm right? Well for most of them atleast
---
Watched Monto play it and I gotta agree that the Nerf is destructive to her. There is no Endgame unless you let it happen or they all will escape you entirely or get the trap off in time. Especially with the 3 minute EGC
---
Oh hell yeah
---
How was it?
---
oink :(
---
I knlw that...................
---
90% I'd say
---
Thank you for that info, I will delete that part of my comment because I was missinformed. But most of my points still stand. No Im not happy. The pig change wasnt necessary. Even if it was neccessary, BHVR should let the community even test Pig with the EGC before they just butcher her power like they did.
---
What I find is helpful is to explain why not to face camp. Unless the gates are open. Chasing 1 survivor with 1 going for the save and 1 on the hook is way better than 2 or 3 survivors on gens because it wastes their time not doing gens.
---
The traps rng isn't broken , it's just a 50/50 each box. 1 in 4 chance would be too strong. We can't really know if it's working or not if BHVR doesn't tell us all we have is player data reports. 
---
So that means most of the trap escapes are coming in the first or second box. 
---
As of current when you put a trap on a survivors head with 5 gens incomplete they could take a long time getting it off , or they could instantly get it off instantly. If they get it off instantly what was the point? Wasting a minimal amount of time? Luck isn't fair (big surprise). And it means you can't rely on the the beartraps. 
---
My suggestion has roughly the same numbers (it's a small chance that a survivor will get to search 3 boxes. 12.5% if I did my math right) , the average. Could go up from 1-2 to 2-3.
---
D/C: Become Killer
---
I get its a joke, but this is incorrect. The skulls of caucasians, africans, and... Mongoloids is the asian term but I think its a stupid term. Anyway, the three skulls differ. I can't remember the details, been to long since I took a forensics class, something about a damn pencil test.
---
Gideon Salt Plant
---
Much less successful sounding poster: It would make my *Slippery Meat Icon Pic*  happy if you'd go to prom with me
---
That's why you don't play by your enemy's rules.
---
DBD already has a problem with jerryrigging perks instead of changing the design of the game (see: bamboozle). Deliverance or Slippery Meat + Decisive Strike are sort of the patchwork perks That said, facecamping is already a ludicrously bad strategy anyway.
---
My constructive criticism is to wait until you get more experience before feeling the need to weigh in on the design of the game. A very simple way to avoid being facecamped by bad killers is to avoid being caught in the first place, which you can do by [learning to run tiles.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ)
---
i thought it would be kinda normal like just them pulling on the gates hella hard and dramatic
---
Ahh, alrighty my brightey!
---
I JUST HAD A REVELATION
---
IF SURVIVORS ARE ALLOWED TO USE METTLE OF MAN, DECISIVE, ADRENALINE, ETC THEN I SURE AS HELL SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO FUCKING USE NOED
---
It’s kinda messy
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
I would agree with you partially, but survivors that get a feel for how you will blink and use it against you can do really well if they plan out their escape paths well.
---
I do think however, that the add-ons that increase her blink distance are a bit much when stacked. that should be reduced a bit or even disallow the stackability.
---
Will we stay in our SWF group now after every match or do we still have to re-invite every time?
---
Sidney Prescott is one of the OG badass survivors in a horror movie, and one of the best final girls in the horror genre
---
lol
---
Nope now it’s just a missed attack animation.
---
Rank doesnt matter, I used to be 1 it was just as toxic.
---
Add some stuff onto it like, if a survior is within X meters of the hook then it wont trigger and i'll be fine with it.
---
But then campers could also bring lightborn aswell so there's that
---
They have heart attack because of the idiot dcing
---
Yeah I saw it, it’s pretty shit tbh
---
Feelsbadman but this can happen in solo games to. At least for me, i feel I do similarily well in solo qeue as i do in swf. This isnt just a swf issue its the game as a whole( i mean other than the obv communication on where totems are.
---
It's incredibly broken, also why would anyone push it past rank 1 if it lasts the longest then? 10m is plenty range for a 360° stunbox. You seem to have the rank 1 and 3 stats mixed.
---
Besides that, it's just insanely overpowered. You have no special clause for it to trigger, i.e. an unhook within terror radius, or attacked after being unhooked, that would allow this not to be abused. 
---
If it stuns the killer, then it can be exploited with the survivor just following them around, blinding them and keeping them from playing the game.
---
Sure. Totally. Just be less toxic to new players.
---
I always ask this: HOW?! I am not a game designer, i hate giving them a hard time, but how the fuck are some of these glitches related to the cause?
---
I hate it when people wave their arms the entire time they are on hook, and complain in post game chat when I didn't go to save them
---
Pretty sure that's a bug then
---
Wow, so now you can hit the rescuer through a hooked survivor?
---
I scoured the internet, all day yesterday to look for a clip of it. Found it on montos video yesterday and was immediately disappointed
---
This exactly why they did it.
---
hatch standoffs are 100% preventable,  just leave if you’re the survivor. if you’re the killer, hit them out or chase them out. it’s literally every killers choice to just sit there. immersed survivors that hold the game hostage exist, but enough to warrant endgame? if that’s what we’re going with, then ok. endgame is purely a counter to hatch standoffs. killers constantly complaining about toxic survivors and BM at the gates had nothing to do with it ;)
---
Yeah, I consistently 4k against solo and swf groups. Sure every now and again you get the super food swf team thats makes you wanna uninstall, but most swf groups arent MLG tryhards who are unbeatable. I'm the best at getting chased in my swf group but a couple of my friends cant last more than15 seconds most times and we lose probably more than we win. But its fun to me.
---
Dedicated servers are literally being tested right now, this will also drastically improve hitboxes because less latency issues and im pretty sure the freddy rework is planned to be released in the mid-chapter patch
---
I feel like it's the kind off decision made by someone who watched others play without playing themselves.
---
Absolutely agreed. Disconnects have always ruined games. When dedicated servers finally come out, hopefully it happens less often and those that do purposefully disconnect can be identified and punished accordingly

---
Horrible lag every game regardless of ping after the update.
---
I don't need to know where trapped survivors are, I need to know where free survivors are. No point in chasing someone who is on a clock already. Except if their in my TR might as well now since there is no point to ignoring them anymore
---
The way to fix camping is that if you are within a certain range of a hooked survivor, the kill timer goes slower.  You can still facecamp, it'll just take much much longer.  You can still proximity camp if it makes you feel better to call it that then straight up facecamping, it'll just take longer.  
---
Voila, If the killer wants to waste my time facecamping or "proximity" (lul) camping, then it should draw out the hook time.
---
Wahhh dude go cry somewhere else...
---
Because I shouldn't have to spend money on a useless killer just to get a survivor with decent perks.
---
Pfffft 💀 would be much better in my circumstance if I had a slippery meat
---
Sadly they arent gonnna revert probably bc they just decreased egc timer down to 2 min..
---
just like that movie :)
---
Poor emus
---
It is useless, but it is still a thing you can do. 
---
Traps were never meant to be used for more then slwoing the game down anyway, her main power is the dash, traps are just a secondly thing.
---
That's exactly how you should be playing as him. Those suvivors are just being saty bitches.
---
Only if you're the obsession. So unless that's you, Distortion wouldn't do jack.
---
Its 2 mins now
---
Yeah DC's are the worst and theyve been so bad lately. Another issue that really needs to be addressed is lobby dodging. Even if i solo qeue i get dodged and if i have to wait 5 to 10 min to find a game just to get dodged it sucks. Should be a penalty like cant host a lobby for 5 min if you dodge
---
Ah, the good ol bowling grip, I see.
---
GAME ENDED, DC.
---
WAIT
---
Can't you just buy the survivor?
---
I know...so give me back my goddess or give me a 1sec EGC. Make your choice.
---
This happened to me recently. I played extremely badly, and as a result I loosely camped towards the end. Still, I got no kill, and they all said "Ez". My excuse was that I was tired.
---
reeeeeeepost
---
As a non-native speaker i'd be glad if someone corrects me in a polite way, but this sub seems to disagree
---
I mean, Monto is a good plater and he did show how they CAN work, its a different playstyle then before.
---
Have you tried Dedicated Servers yet?
---
Thanks /u/PublicWifi very cool.
---
Impossible for u
---
Depends. If you get an average nurse you surely got a chance.
---
What if they made Traps Trigger when Exit Gates are powered and Opened?
---
The end game timer reduction is so nice ima cry
---
They did it orginally cause of the ENC espcally since its 2 minttutes now, but they can change it to be a bit better
---
An*

CONSOLE PLAYER HERE. I NOTICED MORE TBAG AND HATE IN THE YELLOW/GREEN RANKS THAN IN RED.

I just stopped to think that EGC is pretty much a free ebony mori who has a timr to happen
---
Just do what red rank players do, be scum who refuses to unhook, heal, do gens. Get those first 2 gens done then outlast your fellow survivors for the hatch. Its *super fun* to have these games consistently.
---
thanks homie 👌
---
Tunneling I would say is up for debate. Especially if it's an obsession.
---
Not yet, but I think getting the goddess Amanda back to her throne is more important now.
---
He was a Hillbilly with Ebony mori who was camping hatch to ensure he got the last mori. I only messaged him after 5 minutes of circling the hatch around the map to see if he’d leave it alone (hint, he didn’t). After the conversation he let me take the hatch. I’d also like to say that I’ve never DCd before (unless horrible connection kicks me out), and I never tbag. If I have a teammate who plays toxic (tbags, stays at exit gate, etc.), I message them and either tell them to just leave or that being disrespectful has negative impacts on others. With all that being said, this isn’t a playstyle or anything. I’m not super tryhard and I was trying to see if the Hillbilly was hellbent on that 4th kill. I just wanted to see if I could mess with the billy (and yes escape).
---
Ok...stop being toxic
---
Oh hey that'd be pretty cool
---
He even has a swell OG villain as his avatar -- Uka Uka from Crash Bandicoot.
---
true that it doesnt really help in locating other survivors (there's plenty of perks for that tho), but you get a short list of where to find trapped survivors since you can generally scan your surroundings and check the nearby boxes/gens/etc to *keep* them trapped while you look for the others.
---
Next level mind games
---
Serial lobby dodgers, I agree.
---
Yeah it was posted just a few days ago as well, really not long ago lol
---
NO! first problem of DBD is connectivity. Once you stop depending on killers connection then everything will be better.
---
Nice

“A lion doesn’t concern itself with the opinion of sheep” - Tywin Lannister 
---
They do this because they know it bothers you and they get a rush from knowing it. If they tea bag at the gate, read a book and chuckle too yourself as they waste their own time.
---
That is A problem. But the number of games I have that start with 3 or fewer survivors are dwarfed by the sheer number of survivor DC games.
---
Nurses just requires a didn’t strategy.
---
Nurse is littrely the best killer in the game dude. She is the top killer along with Billy for a reason.
---
WHY THE FUCK DID THEY NERF THE PIG? THOSE NERFS IS SO FUCKING UNNECESSARY.
---
Y’all need to chill the hell out and leave sally alone.
---
Hell yeah my fellow br
---
Not doing gens, that's what
---
kind of easy really, killer host the game current and now another computer is hosting.  You have to rewrite a lot of the coding, and while doing so, you run the potential to break a lot of things. Which is what we are seeing here.
---
Personally, no. But I mean it seems cool.
---
Well I’m lucky I’ll never go see this movie

Great job!

Psn. Turn ps4 on, select new user, then create user and press "new to playstation network? Create an account" now feel free to do whatever you want
---
That's us! We're the Tunnel Snakes! And we rule!
---
Genie confirmed as new killer?
---
Oh yeah don't get me wrong, i 100% know BHVR have no control over this sort of thing and that's because Killers are more complicated on that end of things.
---
I just find it funny how after all the recent blows killers have been getting that even random bugs target them.
---
As am I. I wouldn’t be surprised.
---
The guest is also high on believing that you're in love with him
---
They cant. Devs life. Too busy making it to play it
---
Was going to downvote, but saw you are OP.
---
I’d rather be 4kd by a killer using a niche build and moris than solo killed by a killer using bbq, hex ruin, and noed. The crutch perks take the fun away. You’re not a better player for using the same perks 99% of the community is using.
---
I speak English
---
Entity take me right now on the floor 😩
---
Unlimited but its a perk that requires good stealth play
---
WAIT, WHAT ARE THE CHANGES? I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THEM. :(
---
Thats probably who’d i play next
---
Can you don't 
---
This is almost the same thing as when people make "cute" fan art of the Columbine shooters
---
I was extremely angry about the Legion changes at first but the more I think about it and they really aren't that bad. Just kinda wished that they didn't increase his fatigue time.  
---
However the Pig changes are ridiculous.
---
Yeah, but they said earlier that the rework would be going live this mid chapter
---
No mither, from my personal experience, is not a very good perk to have. Most of the time I see it, the player basically is tunneled. The dead hard build is obvious, most killers with any form of a brain will wait until you use dead hard or use a quick M1 attack.
---
They know you have no mither. They will not give you the opportunity to pick yourself up. They won’t let you use dead hard. More ruthless killers won’t give you breathing space on the hook and hard patrol you.
---
No mither makes you an easy target. Weaker prey that is easily removed from the game. There is a reason why it is considered a meme perk. Veteran players only use it to meme and give themselves a challenge or they are going for that stupid David achievement.
---
Don’t do this to yourself. If you really want something useful, use mettle of man. That actually infuriates the killer, instead of going “oh sweet, he has no mither, easy kill”
---
&gt; It says 37 but it almost feels like I'm playing against a 200ms killer.
---
It kinda depends on both your ping. If you have low ping, but killer has high ping to a server, you'll see some surprises.
---
It's not worth using. His other 2 perks are good.
---
Only wholesome post in the saltiest sea of Reddit
---
Yes. Keep at it.
---
I just camp the second I see some survivor trying to be funny. I have no problem camping instead of sitting there being trolled. The match ends fast so you can get into a new one and the annoying survivor gets to sit on a hook while nothing happens.
---
can you even fathom people not having enough money
---
Whats the average you pay? What's considered "too much" for a commission. I dont wanna insult anybody nor do i wanna get jipped
---
Steps in the right direction. Go BHVR!
---
Most killer related things relate to the killer being host, by unravelling the spaghetti that is this games code in order to make killers the client tons of bugs deal with killers because they're no longer the host so so much shit had to be re-written
---
 It's infinite but they will never leave you slugged because they can tell you have no mither when you join the game broken.
---
The endgame timer should be 90 seconds to make it intense and not just a way of stopping survivors from holding games hostage.
---
It is a shit perk. Don't get it. It will only clog up your bloodweb forever.
---
I still need the left behind achievement, I'm just going to run left behind and sole survivor and feel like an asshole...
---
I think camping after all the gens have been done is a different story though. As a survivor it really sucks when it happens to you but I understand why a killer would do it. It becomes a bigger issue when a killer face camps from the very beginning.
---
I definitely have a few more on the way!
---
I completely understand why you play him and honestly as long as you enjoy yourself I think it’s fine. I’m in the minority honestly of just really finding Freddy annoying to play against, and I think it’s mainly due to looping being one of my weakest skills already as survivor and the due to the amount of hardcore tunneling Freddys I’ve encountered. There’s something very frustrating about finally getting away from him and finally waking up only to have him put you back to sleep 5 seconds later when he catches back up to you again because he isn’t planning on switching targets. Being unable to attack is definitely frustrating, but being asleep can be pretty frustrating as well. The RNG honestly sucks for both sides imo. For Freddy it can seem survivors wake up instantaneously, and for survivors it can seem like it takes forever to wake up.
---
By fluke I mean they knew devour hope was around but they just didn’t find it
---
Completely correct.
---
But the A was not from the edit, it's from the subtitles of the show itself
---
I'll have to check him out, but thank you! I'm glad you like it!
---
You gotta understand that dedicated servers are a *huge* change for the game and the dev team in general.  They aren't throwing the entire playerbase onto them with known issues (although to be fair, they may end up doing that) - they're enlisting help from players who choose to opt in to help find other issues.  There's nothing wrong with that approach!  It's more efficient to find all of the issues they can before spending development cycles fixing them.
---
the only time i fell anxious is when i miss billys chainsaw multiple times
---
My experiene with Nurse is they either body the whole team in 2 minutes or they don't get anyone until 3 gens pop and they leave.
---
This is going to kill the South African DBD community Im a part of :(
---
Weve got about 200 odd people on a discord and can consistently find games with each other
---
Rip OP
---
Are y'all aware shit takes time and there's different teams working on different things? The entire team doesn't stop working on bug fixes just because meg is getting a new cosmetic lol
---
Yes please. as a red rank player i get spammed with nurses. Its not even close to fair unless i have a 4 man swf all running meta perks, But most of the time im running fucking pebble or somthing to attempt to have fun, and i just get ass blasted by a nurse with 18 blinks that says "ez" in after game chat
---
I think you've hit upon the real problem with the Pig that most people seem too keen to ignore: RNG is bad.
---
RNG makes the Pig's power *unreliable*, which is bad design. 
---
How well you do as Nurse, Billy, Trapper, Clown, or nearly any other, comes down to how well the player uses that killer's particular power. Missing blinks or chainsaws or bottles, or misplacing traps, is all about player skill, not randomness.
---
The Pig is different. Her core power is completely random, so she has no way to skillfully play around it. As a Pig player, you basically have to *hope* that survivors don't get the RBT off too quickly. Actually killing someone with it is a rare treat, as it should be.
---
I'm not sure I'm completely on-board with your current iteration, but I think it's a good step in the right direction. I think the developers should remove the RNG from the Pigs (and Freddy's) powers. There's a reason both of them are at the bottom of the list, and RNG is the heart of the issue.
---
Maybe as part of additional balance, they could add some alternative method of removing traps to the exit gates that activates during collapse. One that doesn't take as much time as searching the box and guarantees a successful removal if completed, but takes a chunk off the trap's timer each time you fail an associated skill check, i.e. three skill checks over 9 seconds, a great success shaves 1.5 off the removal time, good skill check removes a half second, failed skill check instead removes 25% of the max trap time off the timer and creates a loud noise notification but doesn't stop or regress your progress. Generally, the RBTs still wouldn't be too much of an issue, even without hitting any skill checks, but it'd waste time at the gate and possibly lead to a sacrifice, albeit rarely. 
---
Again, just my two cents, there's probably something in there I forgot to consider, and I just pulled those numbers out of my box so they're probably not optimal for balance purposes.
---
I WAS IN A GAME AGAINST A SPIRIT AND I WAS ON MY 2ND HOOK. JANE URBAN'D TO ME AFTER A FEW SECONDS OF BEING A PUSSY AND I COULD HEAR THE SPIRIT ALREADY PHASING BACK. (SHE WAS A PROXY CAMPING PIECE OF POO!!) I RAN TO AN LT GYM SINCE I ALREADY KNEW THERE WERE NO PALLETS IN THAT AREA. I COULD TELL THE SPIRIT WAS BEHIND ME BECAUSE OF THE PHASING SOUND SO I RAN TO ONE OF THE LT WINDOWS AND THE JANE, UNINJURED, KNOWS VERY WELL IM ABOUT TO GET MY ASS BEAT IF I DON'T TAKE THIS WINDOW, TURNS AROUND AND SLOW VAULTS THE WINDOW AS THE SPIRIT COMES OUT OF PHASE AND I GOT DOWNED. FUCK YOU JANE.
---
If you think you have to cleanse just because Plague puked on you, then you're already ignoring her counter.  Just say no to feeding corrupt purges.  Do the gens.  Know how to loop.  Profit.
---
I just looked up egc points for survivors, and the only survival based one seems to be "Pressure" which awards with 250 points.Still not sure if it's survival though since it doesn't say anything about it.
---
So,there's no other way to get max survival points without that technique
---
*laughs in every killer except pig*
---
&gt;I didn't make this post
---
Never said you did, neither is that even important.  
---
&gt;Community's general consensus
---
The majority of every playerbase usually isn't that good at the game (see any given pvp game) so I wouldn't give too much about the general consensus. General consensus was that Freddy was too op when he was released while the devs already had a chart showing him doing terrible and yet they nerfed him because they followed that general consensus. 
---
There is no buff to the Pig needed, especially not to crouching speed. You are not supposed to crouch-chase people. Run Monitor and Abuse + Whispers to get the best chance at Dashing ppl doing gens or simply standing up and grabbing them. Other than that: Use Dash on pallets. The majority of survivors are trying to use pallets to the best possible, if someone "camps" a pallet with you being on the other side of the obstacle: Crouch, look in one direction, dash, do a 180 and go the other direction.  
---
This isn't as eay as it sounds but it's also not that hard. It's by no means fool proof but with some practice, you will get a ton of hits on pallets while totally ignoring them. Also Enduring will help you to just dash into pallets and take a stun without caring too much. That should help greatly with downing people.
---
I mean, I posted it with a '/s'. Can't get more obvious than that.
---
"Batter up"
---
I’m from Ontario. I went on a grad trip to Quebec to visit Montreal. Lots of partying, McDonald’s, and the pleasure of trying out fried bananas. I really liked them, I didn’t think I would but I was very wrong.
---
Really nice style. It reminds me of something but my brain can't remember what. I want to say some 80s cartoon but I'm not sure.
---
57ms ON DEDICATED "SEWERS", GETTING HIT LIKE IT WAS FUCKING 300MS, KILLER FROM ZIMBABWE HAPPY AF. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS GARBAGE WILL FAVOR KILLERS WITH HUGE PING FUCK THIS GAME.
---
Jush
---
You know I had to do it to 'em.
---
Yeah, tunneling because a perk has that mecanic, well what can you do? 
---
For me the objective in my games are bloodpoints, I win if I get 25k+ bloodpoints, and tunneling and facecamping are not good strategies to archieve that.
---
Fair enough!
---
Just keep in mind that most artists will have a limit to the number of times you can request a redraw, or have a fee for additional redraws past a certain number. $100 isn't worth a month and 20 redraws worth of time.
---
&gt;Activate Windows
---
100% agree
---
Unlimited  but its hard mode.
---
Killer has choice between you or uninjured survivor? They pick you for a faster down.
---
Killer has choice to hook downed you or chase near by injured survivor? They hook you before you can recover, even if the other guy is injured.
---
They all expect you have deadhard, and buggy sounds means that half the time they hear you groaning at full volume and half the time they cant hear anyone anyway.
---
Depends on the killer if its a nurse you are better of stealthing but if its a freedy or wraith or some other m1 killer just loop them
---
darn well 250 is nice. only thing that sucks is you have to be last one i alive i'm pretty sure. 
---
OmG aNoThEr KiLlEr BuFf SuRvIvOr Bp GaIn Is ShIt
---
Ok thanks
---
In the For Honor community we saw the same thing. People think dedicated servers are better but they are the same, but different. The connection is going to be slower so registering hits is gonna be inconsistent. It's slower because it's not a direct connection. So while we may be able to punish quitters and maybe save our items in honest disconnects, the games overall quality is gonna go down. Likewise they may need to mess with input normalisations and stuff. Most fighting games are peer to peer for a reason. We will just have to see. Regardless, switching a game from peer to peer To dedicated servers is like changing an engine in a car while it's moving down a highway. We will need to be patient with them for awhile
---
tunneling is perfectly viable just camping isnt because of how much time it wastes
---
Yeah unfortunately survivors can be toxic on both sides. Not just the killers have to deal with it.
---
You mean like being sweaty enough to commit to camping a hatch?  Agreed.
---
Why dont people wait to see how it plays out before making bold assumptions about what she needs instead of theory crafting?
---
Yeah he's a dumb piece of shit.
---
Are you on console or PC?
---
Maybe I should have clarified and been more specific; I’ve been playing for more than a few months now, so it’s not like I just picked the game up last week, but obviously it’s not as long as some players (a couple years) have been playing. Moreover, while I may not be that experienced, I don’t think that should discredit my input. Those with better ranks are far less likely to deal with this (since, as you iterated, it isn’t a viable killer strategy), and thus become apathetic to the issue since it doesn’t affect them. At least I can say I’ve been around long enough to identify that it’s a persistent problem that plagues newer players, and may cause them to abandon the game. 
---
You could have at least humored me and not said “don’t get caught”. That’s such an infuriating cop-out response. As getting caught is part of the game. Or are you going to tell me that you’ve never been caught? Ever?
---
I do, however, appreciate the link to the video. I will watch it with an eager mind to learn to improve my skills, and I thank you for that. 
---
Now if, BHVR has an issue with just slapping perks into the game as patchwork for issues, how would you implement something to counter this without adding another perk into the game? Does it really make sense to add something design-wise when it only effects half the ranks?
---
Honestly, for one, I had a fucking stroke trying to read this. Grammar and spelling is important. For two, "I've watched all the Saw movies and have max level Pigs on all accounts" just shut the fuck up. Regardless of that, I think they need to continue tweaking Pig and changing things until BHVR magically gets something right and has a balanced killer. I also agree that, as I come from competetive games like Rainbow Six, having RNG in gameplay is unfair and means the game won't be a perfect test of skill between killers and survivors. This also takes away that panicky feeling when you search 3 boxes and your trap is almost gonna pop and you're trying to get it off, which breaks immersion. The RNG is a key part of how her ability works, although it's not fair, and your opinion on this likely depends on how competitive a player you are. I think devs should just continue to try things until she's a balanced killer, since they obviously aren't going to use direct suggestions.
---
PC
---
Doing Meg, U?
---
have you ever gone against a nurse that knows what there doing?
---
Plague is easier but the spirit is stronger and more fun imo
---
I didn't talk about cosmetics... Did I?
---
They only have like 8 servers up right now, limited to 500 people.  When it gets full, it kicks you to another server regardless of ping or rank.
---
Having bad connection while tunneling, while using no ed and the exit block off? Toxic asf, cannot change my mind.
---
This is based on the number of players who have been playing the PTB. You likely won't receive the error.
---
I've been playing plague a bit, and survivors often are able to escape me if they duck as I spew. So now it's not only about stance or looping in chases, you must duck behind cover if you think she's getting ready to blow. With spirit, as soon as she goes invisible, duck and hide, you'll get it better with practice :)
---
I don't get why they can't let the traps be activated still when all gens have been done.  Instead of a nerf, why not just make it a buff?
---
I understand the nerf was necessary due to the amount of time spent during the end game, but all you had to do was make it so having a bear trap on your head stopped the EGC for everyone. This gives you time to get the trap off, but also doesn’t turn the pig to freddy tier.
---
AND NOW YOU HAVE GONE TO FUCKING FAR BUDDY!!!
---
It wouldn’t be unfair to punish someone for not being able to connect to the hosts match?  I don’t understand.  I feel like it’s super unfair to punish someone who is forced to connect to a host that once you start loading in you can’t connect and are forced to dc
---
To come back later :)
---
Calm down satan lol
---
No they  dont, i just think its complain about killers week.
---
Plaid Shirt addon is the absolute best nurse addon. This combined with the massive range addon. Or even just the 2 massive range addons combined gives you the OMEGA BLINK, which is great for hopping between generators.  
---
Prestige the nurse a few times and stock up on the good addons.
---
We will stop complaining when she is no longer nerfed.
---
Huge disclaimer: This is the first test for dedicated servers. There will be some gameplay issues. Right now we are focusing on making sure they can take the load and making sure everything's up and running. Following these tests, we're going to start ironing out some of the rough edges so everything feels the way it should (hit registration, lag compensation, etc.).
---
In short, if something feels a little off, don't panic, this is a super early test and we're going to fix it.
---
Im honestly pretty surprised people are downvoting you, i thought it seemed like a fair and pretty good idea.
---
Guess everyone in Africa can say goodbye to DbD until devs remember that it exists. RIP with Australia
---
You don’t need to be a douche about it. :(
---
This is why I just don't play killer.  I have much more fun with Ultimate Hide &amp; Seek than I do at Get Bullied: The Game
---
I only see perks and you complaining.
---
I usually have to play on Central servers, not this time baybee
---
Nice, so we can leave Freddy and all the other low tier killers in the dirt.
---
Nurse ignores every mechanic and addons like Omegablink and more than 2 blinks are blindingly OP. Just because you go against some shit Nurse players doesn't mean she isn't broken, and most good nurse players will agree that she is.
---
You shouldn't whine about it...
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
It sucks, but it already happens to killer loading into a 1 v 1 game with good addons.
---
With the upcoming dedicated server changes (hoping that theyll be good) it should become a non-issue... but yeah. I'm saying itll suck, but that the alternative sucks way worse.
---
no, but you did say "LOWERCASE LETTERS WILL BE MEET WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE." which isn't correct grammatically so fuck you bot
---
This is some amateur level follower fishing. Twitter equivalent of a chain letter.
---
He had to do it to em
---
&gt; The nerf just makes her actually take skill
---
Nope. It means when the game is getting closer to the end, instead of trapping you she'll just hook and facecamp you.
---
&gt; She was impossible to win if you have a trap on ur head and defends the jigsaw traps.
---
Are you assuming she, like, teleports or something? Hat removal happens all the time in games.
---
&gt; I trapped all 4 survivors after 3 gens were done
---
If the survivors all manage to find you and get stabbed twice, and none of them remove the hats while you're chasing the others, then they deserve a rough endgame. The situation wasn't stupid - your opponents were.
---
I had a swf meg DC on me yesterday, her and her friend instantly left when I caught her in my trap. The game before I was playing bubba against the same duo, and she hid in a glitch on a haybail where I couldn't reach her. It's hard for killers nowadays. Either I get no one and they tbag me, or i get 1 or 2 early and they start to DC on me. If I use a pudding or streamers, at least 2 survivors DC garunteed just to try and grief me :p all in all I don't mind but I agree there needs to be incentive to play a game til the end
---
HEY! YOU SHUT YOUR GODDAMN MOUTH BOI
---
No one bad mouths my piggy, but I do come Back after my make your choice gets triggered.
---
Muahh
---
Weird thing was, two out of the three face campers I ran into last night did it with only one gen finished. I mean, I at least understand why you’re camping if the gates are open, but with one gen done? I just told my two friends to gen rush at that point.
---
There's still people thinking MoM is broken/toxic? I just got out of a match as Huntress in which I let the MoM user get away, and after he was forced to heal himself I sniped him from half map away.
---
yeah other than laurie strode
---
This is the gayest thing ive seen
---
I agree... end game pig is broken af... like you said trap them and patrol boxes seems pretty fucked up. 
---
To do somehting that actually takes skill..
---
Both are super fun but for different reasons. If you enjoy tricking survivors into playing themselves I would suggest Spirit. If you enjoy disabling survivors and being able to hit them from far away I suggest Plague (or Huntress)
---
Weird.  I don't like going against Nurses,  they don't have a strong counter against them.   And a good nurse?  Unstoppable.  
---
But I'm not on here complaining about it like these bitches that are going on about the Pig changes.
---
Not every dbd player uses reddit.
---
I wouldn't waste a perk slot on it
---
I like to bust pallets when they are at the gate, get extra BP on their time.
---
Yes this. It means no killer and no traps if hag
---
Freeddy cant work but his power doesn't help him in anyway expexct slowing the game down a bit and it ends up hurting him more then it helps.
---
Its BHVR studios. Complain all you want, nothing will change
---
It’s great, but hitboxes are tragic
---
Same thing happed with For Honor. They assumed it would be better, but they don't know anything about how it works. People only want it to punish DCs but the overall game is gonna suffer :/
---
Yikes
---
did you also outrun the hatchet? haha
---
Sounds good. Doesn't work.
---
Got arrested breaking into a factory looking for pallets. Send help.
---
R/dbdgonewild
---
&gt; No.
---
No.
---
&gt; If you patrolle all 4 traps a small map, they see you , they run. They won't stay there.
---
Then it's their fault for playing stupidly. If you let your entire team get traps and head into the collapse, you die. This is obvious punishment for avoiding dealing with the traps. They didn't suddenly appear on the map with four traps on their heads - they got there somehow and they've been permitted to stay.
---
It's obvious that a team which has four traps, none of which they've removed, should be punished for bad gameplay. You're asking for the traps to be irrelevant, since any team can just get traps, ignore them, and escape.
---
The survivors are stupid for letting the traps build up and I'm suspecting that you might be too, if you think that's permissible.
---
Given it's Shawnee Smith, I'd nut.
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Start the date boo
---
I been trying to do this with Hag and can not get it. I’ve gotten Ruthless Killer so many times
---
The best feeling is chasing a cocky survivor into a trapped area and hearing that sound and then the screams
---
I've seen not_queen &amp; other BHVR people making the rounds saying that the goal with this deployment is pure stress testing and making sure the raw concept of dedicated servers work. They aren't currently concerned with getting it perfected at this point. They'll wait to refine and fix issues later.
---
Which kind of sucks, but it's a clash of expectations. The things the players thought would be fixed for this test probably aren't high on the list of what BHVR is actually trying to get data for.
---
Help can I get a link or something reddit isn't loading it.
---
Thanks a ton.
---
It's our right to complain, so complain about us all you want, nothing will change.
---
Yeah I'm not saying just reee your whole review about pig, most of the recent surveys have had questions about each aspect of the PTB. I feel there is a lot of good with this PTB update but I dont necessarily agree with killing Pigs end game pressure, and I'll say that but I'm by no means Reeeee'ing about it. I'm a console main that plays freddy, I'm used to things not being great but I still love the game and the work the dev team is doing.
---
=D
---
&gt;Same thing happed with For Honor. They assumed it would be better, but they don't know anything about how it works. People only want it to punish DCs but the overall game is gonna suffer :/
---
Also survivors mass started going around complaining about hitboxes and demanding dedicated servers to fix it (???). Sums up this community in a nutshell.
---
Oink furiously
---
Well I'm lucky I don't even care about MCU.
---
I guess because you can close the hatch and patrol the jigsaw boxes. *But that's just my guess don't downvote me into oblivion*
---
Not run away cuz her lunge is like 50 feet
---
Make bacon.
---
Well, unlimited in the context until you bleed out. It takes about 30 seconds to get up without someone reviving you/using Unbreakable and you have a four minute bleed out timer, so really you're only gonna be able to get up 7 times.
---
Pros
---
Can take advantage of injured perks like Resilience and This Is Not Happening permanently so decent for a gen rush build
---
Works well with a dedicated Sabo build
---
Counters perks like Sloppy Butcher and Bloodhound
---
50% less groaning helps with certain characters who already have pretty quiet groaning like Ace, Tapp or David, on someone like Meg or Laurie their groans are still pretty audible.
---
Pick yourself up 7 (9 if using Unbreakable) times.
---
Cons
---
You're pretty much marked for death as you start out injured so the Killer's gonna know you're running it.
---
Dead Hard's really inconsistent which is arguably the best perk to run with No Mither.
---
You're a one hit down.
---
Killers are gonna tunnel you as the weakest link as you're literally easy pickings for them and actually picking yourself up would require pure luck or someone taking the aggro almost instantly as you're down.
---
&gt;I've seen not_queen &amp; other BHVR people making the rounds saying that the goal with this deployment is pure stress testing and making sure the raw concept of dedicated servers work. They aren't currently concerned with getting it perfected at this point. They'll wait to refine and fix issues later.
---
&gt;Which kind of sucks, but it's a clash of expectations. The things the players thought would be fixed for this test probably aren't high on the list of what BHVR is actually trying to get data for.
---
As much as I want to believe that... its BHVR... This is most likely what we will get unless they give up on the idea after seeing how bad it is.
---
.... Not gonna give them a lesson about conjugating verbs with that title?
---
Why were you on reddit in a match?
---
Seems like LeChat here is showing that he has brains and can use them. Tmega on the other hand...
---
disrespectful XD
---
I'm not sure if they will keep the others on P2P if there's no nearby server, though they said they would add more regions as they see fit. I would definitely ask a dev in a Q&amp;A or something similar.
---
Bruh for real, letting tbagging bother you is pathetic tbh but people who do it are Neanderthals I don't bm unless you camp/tunnel and I get away

Since I think it everyone by now knows that I LOVE Amanda, I would have a nice date with her, hope it grows out into a relationship, get married, have kids, and live a happy live with the woman of my dreams.

I actually figured he was using the app considering how fast he was replying but I assumed that he would use both hands to type and while he was typing I’d have time to jump in.

I had a game recently that was really fun. Killer was respectful and my teammates were competent. This one Claudette has saved me from the hook and in general we did well as a team. 
---
I escaped and viewed the remaining match. Everyone but that one Claudette savior was left. She waiting and teabagged the killer for no reason at the gates. Felt really bad and reported her ass.
---
There is one major difference in networked gameplay between the two: dedicated servers eliminate host latency advantage. Fighting games had to find ways to address this issue, as well. Killers in the current P2P networking environment have a flat latency advantage, since they host the server locally on their machine and therefore enjoy 0ms latency, while the clients (survivors) have to communicate with said server, at a latency interval delay. With a dedicated server architecture on the other hand, both sides are clients to a remote server, being equally affected by latency. This makes for a more fair (or equally-unfair) latency environment.
---
How well the game will generally function on these dedicated servers largely depends on their quantity, quality, and the quality of the game's implementation on them (server code, network code, network techniques). Highly-competitive and decidedly more time-sensitive multiplayer games than DbD is, such as Quake and Counter-Strike, have been operating on dedicated server architectures for ages, so we should not expect or accept that the at times already-questionable quality of this game's networked gameplay will only get worse.
---
Being on PS4 I would actually pay money to have something like this... hint hint devs.
---
Perhaps some people went back to PTB to test the servers (on PC).
---
[FTFY]( https://imgur.com/R75GiYp.jpg)
---
Or just being good at looping
---
When you’re being chased by a killer in the fog but dick is life.
---
depends on what rank you play. are you red rank?
---
Dont play by their rules.... so follow these rules.
---
The whole don't tunnel on purpose thing is stupid. Sometimes ill punish the person hook rushing instead of the guy who gets pulled off immediately but it all depends on how I'm feeling. 
---
That being said I recommend never opening chat logs on this game. So many scummy people their opinions really are not worth it. 
---
Just remember it's a game and you are in the role of the guy who is murdering everyone lol. They don't care about you they just want to escape, Its your job to murder them so there's really no winning over their salty hearts in the process. If they get out of there you're "bad" but if you murder them all you're always still "bad" because of something you did. Lots of poor sports out there just want to run their mouths. 
---
I try not to taunt killers unless they hooked camped my buddy or something than I wait to wave goodbye with my butt. I also DC if the killer leaves me on the ground at the end to try and guarintee a 4k so the other guy can get the hatch. But those are just my personal peeves and don't affect how I play as the killer at all.
---
Dude, go try them RIGHT NOW!
---
You obviously threw a boomerang instead of your hatchets. Git gud bro /s
---
This is why I use sprint burst when running no mither
---
Stop this nonsense, no changes were needed. Maybe, MAYBE slowing down the timer when an RBT is on. It is a HUGH risk to save traps that has a change for a huge payoff but a higher chance to be a waste of power. So can people stop this myth.
---
Haha, I think that's a good way to put it. Again, thanks for the response.
---
I would too. It looks so epic
---
Always try playing both sides, can help you better understand how each role operates and will improve overall skill. I'd suggest starting with hillbilly as your training wheels killer
---
THE GOVERNMENT MADE IT UP! AUSTRALIA IS JUST A SHAM!

And now I am telling you that there is only ONE way to make us stop. So you can either accept  this is live now or fight against it like us. Live or die make your choice.

It's almost like this is a Public Test Build or something.

Lol this is a dumb comment. I made this post so that OTHERS who CARE about the movie don't get ruined. If you read the post correctly, which you didn't, you would realize that I didn't care that mich about being spoiled. I know how important that film is for people, I made this post for them. I think you should be the one that goes somewhere else instead of speading your ignorance like wildfire.
---
&gt;No chainsaw
---
or make traps trigger when they're first placed on the survivor's head.  Why make them wait for some external trigger?

Oh boy I cannot wait for this chat! We will show them they can fuck off or change Pig back. TOGETHER OINKERS!!!!

Yea so you head bang and hit the nea on hook after she did nothing to you, You act like bringing a flashlight is toxic while you bring Those addons and a Pink mori. You are the toxic one.

It's amusing how inaccurate these memes are... Literally no difference between xbox and pc.. Lol its more like "rank 20 nurse vs rank 1"
---
"Be like" is usually intentional.
---
The artist I mainly commission will send me sketches of the basic outlines/ideas before she goes any further and then I can make some last second requests before the main draw happens. Artists are usually very flexible. Just give them time, pay them right and be respectful and you'll almost always get what you want.
---
I enjoy it. Especially when they write “hahaha you got me but don’t feel like you are good, you are a baby killer get good”. 
---
I’m just like hahaha okay whatever you say bud. You are the one who felt it necessary to go out of your way to criticize me...
---
That’s right, Id had enough of SWF purple flashlights thinking they can come into my game with their best items and bully me. So I took pleasure in bullying them for once. :)

Blush bashfully then asks if she wants to play in the pig pen ☺️

For Sacrifice, yes. It actually makes it feasible to cap out given "Late Sacrifice" scoring events and the like.
---
Only if you’re close enough to see them, so that doesn’t matter. And survivors have a 75% chance to get it off on the first 2 boxes. Pigs whole power is based on RNG, so if you die because of it it’s deserved.
---
Piggy is fine, if you're upset or think she's ruined you're just bad.
---
Excuse me?

They are trying to turn her into bacon, stop them!

did it 2,5 weeks ago and got banned 2 days ago for a day.

So how were they toxic? Purple flashlights are not OP, you were Bm'ing after no one even tried to BM you, and you come on reddit to try to flex the fact that you "Punished a swf" When you were playing like this. Actually gross.
---
Um. Not quite. Didn't say the pig was toxic or the ability was toxic/crutch.
---
i usually stay cause it's fun to try and juke/loop a nurse but most of them i face are toxic and camp their ruin 24/7 and it's even worse when you get hooked near it...
---
If the choice is between being nice and getting wins, I'll be a loser every day of the week. Besides, its clear as day that Survivor perks by far outweigh Killer perks. Essentially most games where I'm the killer boil down to if I even get anyone that round or do I just stand at the gate ushering them along.
---
Nani?
---
So i need to find 1 and be a regular. I need me an "Art Guy"
---
Honestly if the pig downed you and used one of her LIMITED traps on you, then you deserve a difficult RNG based escape.
---
Oh please, I go against SWF all the time and 95% of the time they’re teabagging at the exit gates and spam clicking flashlight at you. Punishing SWF is not flex you idiot LOL! It’s a satisfying video getting revenge on the typical SWF. Try getting to high ranks on killer and see how you fare, you filthy useless crouching Nea. Disgusting.
---
That's a really fitting outfit for the situation
---
Well a bit cringe and desperate but I will take it
---
This team just didn’t get a chance to be toxic but all red rank killers know they would. BYE.
---
I would like to be your officila leader. They John Kramer of the Pig mains
---
Known bug - if I remember, they suggest moving away and then moving back towards the box after opening it, which may or may not fix it.
---
Why are some perks pink or blue? Couldn’t that be a bit confusing?
---
Why shouldn't I be?
---
40 minutes later and it's not pinned or even on the front page

The obvious answer is a Double Windstorm Wraith with 3 PWYF stacks and Brutal Strength, Fire Up, and NOED.

well.. :D

When you sleep a survivor, you suffer a minor speed penalty which seems to lasts about 4 seconds (from personal experience, I don't know the exact numbers, I don't know if that is correct). This effect is very obvious when more than one survivor is transitioning at a time. I am not entirely sure about this part, but addons like the prototype claw either turn the speed debuff into a speed buff (making you move a little faster) or reduces the speed penalty effect (though I believe it is the first one). 
---
Either way, it does not last the whole match/as long as someone is in the dream world.

A crutch is something used when there is nothing left. Some killers save the pigs traps for late game(aka a crutch) and I was literally just stating that they can't anymore... No one was complaining about the pig. Please learn how to read.
---
I feel like the pig changes are ok. You just need to use your traps before all the gens pop, and the RBT stopping in the TR can do for some GREAT tracking, it's like a built in whispers.
---
Sup my ngl
---
Om nom nom nom.

De-fuckin-lightful. You BM'd a bit, which as a killer main myself... come on man. Dont encourage the survivor mains.... but love to see that 4 mori
---
Omg what a rank 20 noob you are...
---
I will not control her power or how she is changed. You guys will just link me in posts or comments about Pig and I could start some really cool roleplay. I hope that one day people get on his reddit, who are new to the game, and they will see me be the leader of the Pigs. It would be a dream come true.
---
well you could save up. it would take longer and more money, but ultimately you'll get more out of it
---
ur probably hanging out in the wrong areas of the internet. like reddit xd
---
I mean, they both ended up dead so I don’t see your point. And the whole point of Amanda IS not following directions and instead being a free spirit (well, in this case, pig).
---
Hahahahaha - I know! You’re right about me BMing and I shouldn’t have - but you might understand as this was the 4th SWF I’d had in a row who were all teabagging me beforehand so I was presuming they’d have done the same if I didn’t go with this punishing build. 😂
---
1st: Camping isn't against the rules. This guy's playstyle may be annoying, but its not against the rules, so you're not gonna get him banned.

Idk man, I just wanted my double pip though 😭😭😂 they practically handed themselves to me at the start like wtf 😂😂
---
Looking at it now, I see what you’re saying but I can’t name it either
---
I as a pig main and many others are upset about the fact that our traps impose no game pressure now,  rbt being heavily depended on RNG hurts us sometimes as if you get lucky your trpas is removed on the first try, you can simply do Gens while having a trap and then later remove it afterwards as the timer is 2:30 giving SURVIORS enough time to complete atleast one Gen.
---
PIG had a lot of flaws her power didn't really help in chases and hooking people and they still nerfed her
---
People don't reliase but traps not going off in the terror radius actually hurts as people can abuse it while saying close to you doing objectives.
---
Just had a horrible match in ptb with 4 mom am a bit said about it but it is what it is.
---
I just submitted a bug report, the huntress in some cases on PTB has insta-down hatchets even with no add-ons. So far, 1 other person reported the same thing. I think huntress is broken right now on PTB, no idea how they are going to fix it, but I'm sure they will.
---
Understandable, Appreciate it
---
I feel like this could be the style of a 2005 series of flash cartoons on newgrounds.
---
To be fair, Id use BBQ even without the wallhacks. The bloodpoints are just too good, and is required for my "Bloodpoint Trapper" build.
---
thank you :)
---
Dude, I *get* it. Killing lately had been like having my god damned soul sandblasted.
---
Now I get a constant 200 ping  :( 
---
but at least no lag switchers :)
---
Bless you
---
I thought we'd be getting Pennywise?
---
I once ended a game as Pig in a total of 25seconds. They cleansed Haunted and spawned together in the bathroom. I depipped.
---
Exactly what I pictured
---
O-H!
---
You can adjust the brightness of the game on pc, which isn't bannable, and that eliminates any sight problem you would have. 
---
Nurse, concept and in practice, is too strong. She can just teleport through all of the survivor's defenses, and a nurse who has practiced won't have any counter play. Not only can she teleport through the map and is not bound to map layout like survivor/every other killer, she is fast. Map control + an ability that ends chases quickly without any counter play if they know how to use her is just too powerful. Even if she does require some adjustment to get used to, her ability is broken.
---
Amanda died cause she didn't listen to John, John died as he planned to die, it was part of the game. And you just failed yours...Game Over.
---
yeah huntress is literally broken on the dedicated servers. Those servers doesnt know how to handle the hatchets or something, they are just so laggy.
---
That's kinda funny, cuz even if you tried her on the ptb, she wouldnt be garbage, so nice on hypocrite. You play it yourself before making decisions about saying she's bad. And if you have played it on the ptb, then you're just not the greatest pig main then, just deal with it.
---
I run frosty on pretty much every killer, never realized it was a “noob” cosmetic
---
4K in Rank 10? How dare these Killers! *starts up Nerf Gun*
---
I am seriously considering putting Frank's on most of my killers. At least give the little shits a reason to hang around and try to dc with their toys.
---
Boarder state of Ohio here as well, I'm happy about it!
---
I know, it sucks. Legions one of my least favorite killers to play against, but I agree that his nerfs were too much :P
---
Dew it
---
This subreddit is mostly survivor mains. Enjoy the salt!
---
right when it's my thesis deadline fuckkk
---
All new Legion Cosmetics to play as Ghostface im calling it
---
We're worried about survivors not being able to remove RBTs placed during the collapse. In other words, we're encouraging facecamping to get those last kills.
---
I think increasing number of jigsaw boxes or making them more difficult (RNG) to remove earlier in the game would make me feel they have improved her, even if they keep end game like this.
---
lol it's so obvious you're lying about playing killer.
---
Who cares about the neon skin it ain't waifu Susie so no one cares SUSIE BIKINI SKIN OR RIOT
---
Pig will be broken end game with helmets if they still pop at exit gates. Glad terror radius timer is revered but helmets need to stay the way they are.
---
They arent reverting her back I just watched the dev stream. They are reverting the trap timer thing when in terror radius.
---
Nah man we’re getting Chucky you know this
---
They if they don’t give us arming traps in endgame (which I hate to say they probably won’t because they reduced the egc timer) they need to give us rule set 2 as base.
---
Honestly, I think this is all we really needed. They did say they would continue to make changes to make her more viable, so I'm happy about it
---
i won't make the same mistake that i did last time when there was a bloodhunt.
---
this time i will play the absolute HELL out of the game
---
they use less skill then a flashlight so no shit they're worse.
---
Keep them as is.
---
You shut your Goddamned Mouth
---
I've been gone for almost a year and I remember crazy exploits. 
---
-Flash light buffed to so cheap they fixed it in 3 days.
---
-A dead sur sending me messages about what the killer had.  Just to nullify all the killers perks. 
---
-Pallets fucking every 10 feet. 
---
-4 man DS 
---
-Sabo squad madness.
---
They fixed or did nerfs to all that and now the only thing left is to dc. I bet once bans from dcing start I think we are going to dump big chunk of the player base.  When I came back and started to play killer now I get more 3 or 4k games then I ever did.  I love playing sur now more too. 
---
#1 problem is to get the toxicity out as much as you can. Then balance.
---
Yes! Honestly this is what I was most worried about.
---
Can confirm. Played as huntress right after the dedicated servers update and my hatchets caused insta downs most of the time i used them.
---
Hate how this moment of temporary fame got to this guys head well better enjoy it now before May 28th
---
Thats fair. I didnt get why they did that.
---
This change felt like an overkill anyways.
---
What... A killer, i dont like going agaisnt those, I'll just leave instead
---
I cant take you serious... its video gran bruh
---
Better flip our shit and act like all the changes are permanent.
---
Not to say there shouldn't be feedback though.
---
Powers in general seem laggy on the dedicated servers. When you activate legion's frenzy it always stutters and you lose quite a milliseconds because of it as well.
---
Also had a Nea disconnect on me right as I picked her up and it put me in a really weird state, I was moving at the usual survivor carrying speed, but could attack and my visuals stuttered extremely hard, like if I had 5 fps or something. 
---
They have quite some things to improve with the servers, but hey, that's why it's a PTB.
---
Ay ay
---
Same, I like using bp perks and addons that have detriments like trappers no damage traps. It’s satisfying
---
we all have Ruin fam
---
Go get some professional help man. 
---
It's not healthy being this angry over a video game.
---
This is all that was needed. Traps need to stay the same or they need to reevaluate egc
---
Okay how is it broken? RNG has a lot to do on getting the rbt off. First box mấy have it or last one might. Also the timer is like what, two minutes? If perps aren't stupid don't finish last gen until all traps are off.
---
It means that the player is playing poorly like they are new to the game. 
---
Its usually used for killers or players that make massive misplays consistently such as survivors throwing down pallets super early  &amp; running into nowhere from a killer or killers that constantly respect pallets.
---
I dont disagree. Most of my suggestions are aimed directly at ripping out toxicity by the fucking roots
---
I played as Legion a few times on the PTB and felt that I was able to win chases without too much difficulty. Mending didn't feel super cheesy but it was still something the survivors had to eventually deal with. I particularly like how you need to be precise with your swings and not just keep spamming them until you hit someone.
---
The one person in the report office just got round to doing your case
---
&gt;Allowing pig to potentially secure a kill or two with her power is pretty fuckin reasonable when you have things like Tombstone Myers and InstaSaw and Corrupt Purge + NoED. 
---
Maybe, but you're comparing a base power to add-ons and perks. Maybe the solution is a rare add-on that activates your RBT immediately?
---
As much as I love Hybrid Panda he is a huge content creator in DBD and he showed a bunch of future players the opposite.
---
My body is ready.
---
Of course I won't be in town around that time, and will be in Illinois for a wedding.
---
**Angry oink**
---
No problem :)
---
Aw, I was expecting the Peepee Poopoo man.
---
*Drools at hunk*
---
Finally someone said it
---
Just in time of my birthday!
---
HURRAY!
---
I said a Billy without Addons or NOED can get 4ks easily. You then state the exact same thing I said back at me...
---
Are you a parrot?
---
Oh and the EGC was just to get people to leave and not grief and the WGLF change to stop hook farming. Also dedicated servers to punish DCing is all the proof we need to show what kind of ass holes we have. Get them out and balance game.
---
While survivor gameplay may improve, killer is gonna be pretty rough.
---
is Corrupt Purge now affected by NOED? I thought it worked like Legion's and Huntress' powers?
---
Well Ghostface’s whole thing is calling people and sneak attacking them. Wouldn’t be too hard to integrate a cellphone mechanic, we know the Entity can obviously add anything it wants into the trials.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we got em
---
Remember Me changes will stay if I understood correctly.
---
The exit gates will be reverted from 15 to 20 (they already are on the PTB).
---
I don’t think so, this guy was also talking about how much he hates Legion, wouldn’t make sense to seem this hyped up for Legion skins.
---
I wouldn't use "highly successfull" perhaps "financially successful"
---
Actually it is fault you killed them to fast.. thank you next
---
I'M NOT IN RAGE but curious what will happen now.
---
Possibly- having it activate next time the survivor is unhooked/healed from dying sure as hell would be better than current Amanda's Letter, but at Very rare rather than iridescent would be more worth it.
---
Even Noob3, who profoundly hates Legion, said in his new video that Legion was actually more fun to play.
---
You cant rely on randoms to not finish last gen. And it woukd be broken bc in multiple scenarios you just automatically die bc of egc running out against her. If she can close the hatch and you cannot leave a gate there is little hope for you. I will reply with the scanarios i snt to my friends one second
---
They said it was in the last live patch.
---
Feelsbadman
---
Exactly. And if pig was just reverted imagine this scenario. I am running the killer around for 3 gens and she finally downs me right at the beginning of egc with noed. Its my first hook and I hang until egc is only 2 mins left. Magically i dont get tunneled immedately but i need my trap off bc there is no hatch and ill die if i try leaving. So i run and check boxes. Im on the 4th box with 30 seconds left i get it off and die on my way to the gate bc i ran out of time. Or this scenario. I run check 2 boxes
---
Also you are now way more likely to get multiple people with FF, thus keeping the survivors occupied longer. If you feel like the 10 seconds are too little, try the duration addons. They're awesome and I think his best choice atm since they just nerfed the cooldown addons into uselessness.
---
As a Freddy main, I don't usually use those addons.  I tend to favor power range because due to my testing, the slow isn't as clutch as hitting them with the power as soon as they hear the lullaby.  Good survivors will bolt the second they hear the music, so putting them to sleep before they start running for it balances out the slow.
---
I mean, Bruce Campbell said the same thing in his announcement trailer.
---
Still trapped with no time i sprint to the 3rd box, killer finds me and i am just dead bc even if i can run her around i have no means of escape and no time so the entity kills me for her mid chase
---
Yes...
---
Or there is also just getting tunneled. There is no counterplay. I have no way to escape. Even if i lose the killer, i will have no time to take my trap off, and even if i do i need to panic run to the gate and get found
---
The picture is rather representative of Scarred Hand's Hag.
---
Massive happy oinks! I literally do not give a fuck about end game pig builds because it never gets that far for me. However the 1 thing that needed to be unnerfed that effectively made her traps 100% useless on all but like 3 maps is now going to be gone! Happy oinks for all!
---
I think the issue is mostly with huntress (potentially clown, plague, but to a lesser degree), because the hit detection system for huntress was designed around p2p, and isn't coded to compensate for server lag from the killers end
---
Noed does not work with Hatchets nor Frenzy, but I've gotten noed downs with it. That may have changed now, though, I do play on ps4 and it was around Plag launch
---
Playing killer is so unsatisfying at lower ranks. I almost never play killer, so I'm not that great at it. It seems like I get put against deranked survivors, I find it weird that a rank 18 can have multiple 3rd tier teachable perks for other survivors...maybe I'm just crazy.
---
Anyways, I get called a camper for being across the map from a hook and downing the guy when I eventually make my way over there. I also get accused of lag switching by people who stayed in my lobby with 600 ping. Dunno if they're dumb or what...
---
But yeh what they said about not letting it get to you, just ignore the entitled survivors.
---
Being too good means your rank should be higher. This is a major flaw with the system.
---
Not to mention now egc starts at 2 mins instead of 3 so this woukd be even worse
---
true... oof
---
And when she gets nerf’d, we’ll have a bunch of shitposts about how the devs “WenT tO FAr.” Ffs, this sub is beyond retardation.
---
She could also just exploit vy following you without downing you and you cant take your trap off bc she is right there so you have no option but to let egc kill you. How is that fair?
---
surv is pretty crappy too atm tbh.
---
I can see that being a problem, yeah. Really hope they figure out a way to fix these until summer, because they can't really implement it like that.
---
Not like i was having fun facing him too , but i agree - they shoot him in the face and burned the corpse
---
Hahahahahaha!! I can tell. I used to main survivor and I’d maybe have been the same - then I got to red ranks with killers and I see how it really is. 😂
---
Harsh wording but the essentially yeah. -.
---
I don’t have any facepalm images handy so......”insert facepalm image here”
---
You guys bitch a lot
---
No!
---
I do not say it out of hate, merely fact.
---
How? How is that a buff?!
---
Ya I think it's an easy fix (there's another bug it seems that causes hatchets to go through survivors, dunno bout that one).
---
Just add a small (.5-.75 second) grace period where a survivor can't get hit again after a hatchet throw and I think it'll be fine
---
How? Bc I say not every SWF group is toxic and he was in fact, being toxic to people who did nothing to him?
---
Misdirection fam
---
Fucking tryhard killer mains on this sub, using their powers and stuff.
---
Let’s be honest, in the world we live in “financially successful” and “highly successful” are basically the same thing lmao
---
Lol reddit users are such whiny little bitches. Simply state that some people save her trap to end game and they won't be able to anymore and yall get moody like a bunch of cry babies. Wow.. Didn't think this page was full of 12 year old. Smh
---
now that... is how you make a character.
---
freddy mains that dont use ruin*
---
Yaaaaaaas!! I’ll check out your profile 😄! M&amp;A has been amazing to sneak up on them so they have less chance of getting to a pallet. I usually run Ruin/M&amp;A/Nurse’s(or Sloppy)/BBQ(mainly for more BPs).
---
don't you get less bloodpoints as well if you camp hooks too? it always seems like campers get less bp at the end screen.
---
I didn't say he wasn't?? I said him and nurse are more likely to end the game in a 4k with zero addons/NOED than any other killer. Perhaps it's only the very skilled that play them but there's a definate issue if a killer can 4k at Rank 1 easily with no addons. SWF plays make the matches much more viable for the survivors. I've played since launch so I've nearly seen it all.
---
HAHAHAHAHA!!
---
I just watched the whole livestream and I still fell for it.
---
WOOO!
---
Lets be honest, ptb is a way foe the devs to maximise the amount of bugs they cant release on the live game all in one go
---
Wait, are you complaining about the tr change? Because I am fine with Party hats not going off if inactive.
---
He did sent that 4 hours ago and 2 hours ago he was telling people to add him to play DBD
---
I wave rapidly if I'm being camped. I do one to say coast is clear.
---
unBaLaNcEd GaMe
---
Welp I won’t even be in the same country...
---
They reduced it!? Huzzah!!
---
I don't usually run ruin because I hate having my hexes broken and usually dont care if gens pop early. A hag with a tight 3-4 defence is hard to break
---
If you are not in a chase it goes down.
---
Who is angry?
---
Yes, that's what I ment with it.
---
Legion.
---
Why though. How often will playing in the endgame matter? Why would they need her whole playstyle for the last 2 minutes of the match? They could've just left her alone and then we should have a mediocre killer that has more potential during the end game, sorta like how she already was.
---
u/not_queen
---
No not that, the idea of dying trying to escape
---
Yup which sounds like it was needed
---
Why not just slow down end game collapse while rbt is active then just like they're on a hook?
---
Egc does? What do you mean
---
It was. 3 minutes too long.
---
I know right!! It’s just a couple swipes at the Nea, all in good fun! 😏😂
---
People have been asking for this change forever. Perhaps now we can finally use her nerf as an excuse to implement these changes!
---
I thought the point of the timer was specifically to stop hostage situations
---
Good way to get people to instantly hate you I guess 😂
---
After this dev stream im not so sure anymore, karma train just left
---
There's no debate about it, the only reason you wouldn't make the efficient play and target the survivor closer to death is because of social pressure
---
The reason they were op during the winter event was because they gave no noise notification so it was essentially impossible to avoid since you never knew if they dropped it while out of sight. If you want to buff from decreasing the timer then that could be an option, but the noise has to stay because it was just way to op while it was bugged.
---
And here we have one of those users.
---
Dunno, frankly. It's been repeated often by the community, but they're going with this other odd "fix."
---
[Discord](https://discord.gg/aBz4aC7)

[Many templates](https://imgur.com/a/fx4xols)
---
Yea,but I also have other things I need to buy. Food,rent,gas and I only have time for a part time job
---
So if the trap is active you die if escaping via gates, hatch still safe. Honestly I do not see the problem.
---
My bad, mobile reddit made it look like your comment was a direct reply to mine. Sorry
---
That doesn't really change anything gameplay wise, but that would be nice
---
I enjoy the memes but this nerf really isn't a big deal. Big end-game change and now you just dont put on the head cages once doors are activated.
---
Do pigs really need them that much in the end game after all gens are done?
---
You rather have ten minutes? /s
---
I didn't make the icon packs. All I did was combining the two
---
Why are you defending you’re friend like this? It’s obvious you 2 are just agreeing with each other Bc you’re friends
---
What about being able to see where she's gonna be when the blink lands, this could make it so survivors can have some more counterplay than just breaking line of sight and running back towards her when charging a blink.  
---
I play a lot of nurse on console and play against her, it's easier than it is on PC to play against her yeah, but being able to react to her blink before she actually gains control should make her have some kind of counterplay that's not hoping they aren't skilled enough to get you (not saying the survivor's skill doesn't matter AT ALL in the match up, but the nurse's skill matters way more currently).
---
Do it! You can never go wrong with Invader Zim
---
For keyboard and mouse? I'm a high skill console player 50/50 each side. I know the mechanics but I can't control my movement or actions, at least not efficiently like I can on console lol like I can't move in a straight line with good camera control, it's either one or the other lol which can be a huge downfall for either side I play
---
Generally speaking, the idea isnt to be used in chase, but I already said how you could get 25% added to your wiggle bar if you're running flip flop since itll give you 50% to your recovery bar if you do decide to do it mid chase. An extra 25% to wiggle bar can definitely get you out of some situations, and since you're already going down, why not?
---
It’s because you’re getting triggered pal, and you look ridiculous
---
I have 2k hours and I have 3 rules:
---
1. No tunneling. 
---
2. No camping.
---
3. Not tbagging (as survivor).
---
Even tho most of the games I get 4k, survivors never complain after the match. Sometimes I get messages on my profile that I'm a hacker, but other than that I love the killer experience.
---
Oh and if they tbag me or click their flashlights, I focus on them, not when they get unhooked, but when there are multiple survivors and they all start running.
---
This happens on pc too.
---
I would, but I have to get sprayed with pepper spray first.
---
Shut the fuck up ‘MarbleTheNeaMain’, you’re a disgrace to this community, no one wants you here, get the fuck out before I come to your house and smash ya head in.
---
I just want them to remove the permanent injured sound
---
I’m just asking why are you 3 so fuckin toxic, you’re friend couldn’t defend himself so he had to call in you 2 to back him up
---
Couldnt this trigger the anticheat and fuck over your game?
---
Lol if it was 3 mins too long that means you think egc should be zero mins which would mean as soon a s a survivor opens a gate everybody instantly dies lol
---
Or just put a Jigsaw box near the gates that are guaranteed to remove your trap, so at least Pig would get *some* utility from her power in the end game. There's so many ways they can address this better.
---
Honestly I agree.
---
To be fair his comment is only partly true.
---
Yes, the community wants people who make threats over the internet like a 12 year old who just got Xbox live
---
Okay wait. In your above scenario, in ptb, Piggy would be wasting her trap if the EGC just started. I said I am fine with party hats not going off if inactive at the gates. Plus at start of the game, in thẻ lobby one can ask to not đó last gen if Pig if not all traps are accounted for.
---
Yes, because nerfing the only viable Killer in the game is a great idea
---
Yeah... Things started out the other way when the game first came out. And it should remain that way even now.
---
You keep still if you’re being camped — BECAUSE THE KILLER CAN SEE YOU IF YOU’RE WAVING TO TEAMMATES.
---
You start waving when the killer is gone — BECAUSE THE KILLER CAN’T SEE YOU COMMUNICATING TO TEAMMATES NOW.
---
Waving when camped gives information to the killer. Still when camped does not.
---
Not hard to figure out which one is better.
---
If u were pig main and you are that upset about small changes that will be irrelevant to the gameplay that means that you basically played pig but not mained her omegalul
---
How about if pig closes the hatch and if the last survivor has a trap on it gets removed instantly
---
Give me your phone number big man, you’re in for a call.
---
RIP Canada I guess
---
Ik i sent the scenarios when i thought you werent fine with being able to escape with a trap. If you are ok with leaving with a trap on then we are on the same page.
---
*coughing noises from the mist*
---
will there be p2p host for us oce players still?  or will we have to connect to the nearest server which is Singapore if i'm not mistaken.
---
Ouch?
---
Eh can be abused. Run DS and if after first hook with this nó need to wiggle if not the obsession. Imo
---
Earlier today I had a game against a non-insidious bubba. I was on hook, waving my arms because he was camping. My team had 3 gens to do for the entire 2 minutes I was on hook. All 3 of them sit around the hook and do nothing while he camps. They all die. Rank 6 by the way.
---
From my experience, the burn is a lot quicker on the nurse if aimed properly
---
What do you mean? D
---
Blink grab are pretty glitched, sometime you just start sliding for the entire map locked into the animation or get your fatigue without grabbing the survivor. Just be aware of this next time you grab blink someone. All your exitement could be destroyed by this bug.
---
Anyways good luck whit your training. If you need any tips i can help you
---
Remember Me nerf is most certainly not needed, especially considering the bullshit reason they gave for nerfing it. "It's too oppressive if the hatch gets closed." Yeah, as it should be. If you're in a 1v1 with the Killer, the Killer is the one that should have all of the advantage. If that isn't the case, if one Survivor is enough to challenge the Killer, then that's how you get..... the terrible state that the game is in.
---
That would be fine but that's essentially the same thing as just allowing the escape with it on anyways
---
Downing or hooking a survivor probably wouldn't count towards the slowing of the timer if a survivor or more have a trap on
---
It would be awesome if the entity also came and impaled killers that DC. Cuz the entity would be pissed at them for not doing their job.
---
I-O!
---
Just noticed this myself  
---
I had to check to see if anyone else noticed it
---
No. 3 minutes was too long. Two is great imo. Remember it only takes 15 seconds to open gates. Plus you are assuming you are the last person which is not always the case.
---
Yeah cuz it would be fucking delightful to be tunneled by the pig after exit gates are open and only knowing thay you have 3 minutes to die without any hope.
---
The terror radius thing was probably what bugged me the most, so I’m happy with that. Sure I would like to have seen traps still work in endgame, but with a decision to reduce it to two minutes then they really can’t do much about it.
---
2 minutes sounds more reasonable to me as well. Hope they stick with it. Best news I’ve heard
---
From my experience with testing it versus a nurse standing still (in kyf) it's not as long as wraiths burn but definitely is longer than 1 second, either way, it is NOT an effective way to go against a good nurse
---
Thank you
---
Can confirm, am Xbox to PC nomad
---
If I'm remembering right the fireworks from the previous events had audio cues, except for the winter event, didn't they?
---
I don't mind the Remember Me nerf too much but it doesn't work
---
&gt; If you were to stack the old one with Blood Warden, you'd have an endgame timer of 110 seconds, leaving survivors with just 10 seconds to escape.
---
like that. Endgame will only trigger after a door has been opened or the hatch closed. Once the door is open then Remember Me is basically useless.
---
The nerf was done because it would suck in a 1 v 1 situation when the killer closes the hatch.
---
Oh damn thanks for explaining it, I didn't consider that
---
Dude calm down its just a fucking game, why are you so mad bro hahahahah
---
Lol dude that just people taking an internet meme too far. Just because people go overboard doesn’t mean ALL the fans are ass. I’m a fan and I’m not gonna hate some random Indian dude lol.
---
If it didnt make it too over powered, i'd also be down for that. Maybe even just re-working the combat straps to make them increase move speed while crouching? idk lol
---
red ranks its miserable for both sides i try and stay out of red ranks and most of the slugging is to buy more time if you slug 2 people and go for a 3rd then nothing is getting done for survivors to win i hate it but thats what most killers at higher rank have to do to get a decent game
---
Oinkers unite!
---
Im starting to think Legion and Pig were sacrificed for Freddy
---
and to get Pig back to normal they needed to gut Legion more
---
I had a game today against four survivors who would run around the map without a care for stealth, unhook when I was close, etc. One died, one was hooked, I chased another through the gate. I put two traps down near the hook and saw Jane Romero's immersive booty urbaning around behind a tree, so I chased her out the door too.  
---
The first thing in post-game chat was "HE WAS CAMPING", as if with the gate open and a survivor hooked ten feet from it, I'm supposed to go sit in the corner at the opposite end of the map and let the last two get a free escape.  
---
Don't play by survivors' rules. Anything short of giving them a boost over the exit gate wall will be called some form of 'toxic' by people who can only make it through a match by stacking second-chance perks so their many mistakes don't get them killed early in the game.
---
Thanks man

Hol up, fact check here. How'd you know his User ID if you were still in-game?

I think "in a good place" meant "the afterlife"

That doesn't make any sense. Of course the pc player that is used to and is better with keyboard and mouse will still be better.
---
exactly why would i give up dead hard, borrowed time, self care and any exhaustion perk for wglf
---
OK, as of now nurse is incredibly overpowered and might need a little balance. However as of now she is one of the only viable killers in this game along with Billy, until they make all the other killers viable nurse needs to stay where she is, but that's clearly never going to happen, so I guess what does it matter.

---
I've played survivor for 100 hours, and I complain about everything you can imagine in this game. But not once have I ever felt the need to complain about "tunneling".  
---
I'm fully aware I'm going to be the number 1 target after an unhook, and in most cases I blame the person who unhooked me.  
---
I really don't understand why so many people complain about tunneling when the killer is just playing the game.
---
If she stayed the way she did she would become hated, like alot. If a Pig was running No one escapes death and got a trap on they could never escape, getting 1 hit downed into confirmed kill sucks
---
The end game changes to her RBT are really harsh and take away a lot of her power, but yeah that’s good you’ll keep an eye on her.  She will need buffs otherwise I think.
---
See, it's killers like you that I respect.    It's these sociopaths on here that are like "IT'S NOT MY JOB TO HAVE FUN IN A VIDEO GAME. I MUST WIN"  that I dislike.  
---
They are also the ones that camp, tunnel, slug at 5 gens, and then wonder why the survivors salt them in post game chat.   The ones that have been on Reddit, see people post "Who cares if you are a dick to survivors" and can't imagine why making the game so unfun that people block them with MLGA.  
---
I've gone up against killers that facecamp, get called on it and said "I DON'T PLAY BY YUR IMAJUNARY RUULZ LUUSER GET GUUDS"   --  Do killer mains really not expect to get a bit of salt in post game chat when they act like that?
---
Well it can change back. Have to test it
---
I get that. I actually like the direct they went. However they didn't need to nerf so many different things. If they stopped at increasing his speed, changing deep wounds, and had each missed swing reduce frenzy by like 3 or 4 seconds (instead of all of it) I feel like they'd be much more fun to play.
---
1 freddy isnt the worst killer, but require way more skill than all the current meta killer so people just dont want to be good and prefer running around with one shot and a chainsaw 
---
2 nurse on ps4 is at same level of a pc nurse, but is way more difficult to learn. Anyways once you learn how to use her noone could counter you because noone on ps4 play against nurses that often so you will win more easly
---
Yeet
---
dont take the post so seriously, have a little fun geez everyone on this sub takes things to seriously.
---
Nah, I'm good with the thing I already have that works well enough for me.
---
Ive said "not counting that i would have to learn kaybord and mouse", but anyways, what i mean is that being good on console with nusre require more effort, so at same level the console player has trainend harder. Probably im explaining bad.
---
100% chance those 'other killers' hear just as much shit from whiny survivors who expected a free escape as the killers who do toxic things like prioritize downing injured survivors or don't leave a hook because some dumb bitch left a wreath of scratch marks around the nearby jungle gym.
---
Exactly.  You can tell what killers go to Reddit any time they act like a sociopathic prick in game and then say "I DUNT PLAY BY SURVAHS RUULZ BOOKZ."
---
if they are hiding better that means theres no LoS
---
Means a bigger window to save
---
Waving is still better
---
Why is a 60 year old man that sucks at video games deciding how to balance Legion?
---
This Ethan Larson "dude" is wearing female jewelry and has his finger nails painted. He is clearly mentally ill.
---
Good. Now revert the other change
---
What I mean with tunneling is a killer going after a specific survivor no matter what. Imagine going against a billy, you are the first one to be found and billy chases you, downs you and hooks you,later you get off the hook and billy immediatly go and look for you, if there is another survivor close by its ignored to focus on you. Repeat that until you are dead. That is tunneling on my book.
---
Should have asked how each other's dick taste like.
---
Honestly I main all 3 so this whole PTB has been 1 wild ride
---
I think there's better ways to address her strength in the new EGC without completely invalidating her power. The nerfs aren't nonsensical, I don't agree with it but at least I can understand their logic, but it doesn't make sense to nerf a lower-tier killer without buffing them appropriately.
---
You are welcome.
---
The Devout Emblem is *broken*
---
Idk why thats so funny to me
---
Oh this is not all of it, I can give links to the whole convo if u want
---
Thank the Entity. I'm still upset that they kept RBTs not activating during the EGC but I'll gladly take this revert.
---
Don't need to shit on it yet, it's a good direction, gotta give it time to see how it plays out.
---
It's call a Mori ;)
---
^^^^^/s
---
Sadly I play on PS4.
---
I legit only have BHVR to fix such a simple thing to fix.
---
They showed in past events/and with certain perks that have different colored Gens, Hooks and all the other effects can easily be changed they just don’t seem to want to cause it’s not effected a large enough playerbase to be worth the effort I guess.
---
Waving gives information to the killer. Staying still does not.
---
If the hooked survivor is waving, killer knows they are communicating to other survivors. If the hooked survivor is still, killer can not be sure if they are communicating or just afk.
---
Stay still when camped. Wave when clear.
---
Don’t feed information to the killers.
---
Where can I find a huntress to hide under?
---
"Fix terrain shitboxes"  
---
"...there are five rules."
---
That's understandable. It is a necessary change, especially now that the End Game timer is down to 2 minutes. Unfortunately that removes her late game power, but it's something that ultimately needed to happen. We'll be sure to keep an eye on her, though.
---
I’m not up to date what’s is his endgame collapse pse update
---
And alot of survivors are stupid. The majority are noobs who still havenet fought half the killers and dont know how to do shit. A survive with frienss againts the pig nerf is gonna be super bad for the pig but a random 4 man, its fair for the nerf
---
This ain't great. But it's something.
---
The TR thing didn't address what they wanted it to, mainly because of the crouch (seriously *how* did BHVR not realize that?!), and harmed Pig who were just playing normally. Glad it's gone.
---
The endgame change makes sense, especially since the collapse timer is now 2 minutes, at base. That said, it does take away from her identity, and I HATE the Devs' attitude regarding this. They seemed to completely disown the idea of endgame Pig, saying RBTs are meant to be used while gens are up.
---
Probably the case
---
Yeah I get you, I agree with you, people like to complain. Sandbagging is the survivor fault not the killer.
---
I have only encountered 1 tunneling killer, but he was a rank 20 so it can be just inexperience.
---
Maybe a cooldown when you leave is a good idea
---
Is that outfit taken from the game files or is it something you've made? Looks great!
---
I do too, I never DC, again, I don't agree with it, but I understand why
---
I don't care what the people designing 'my game' look like, or the choices they make in their personal lives.  If that makes me a moron then so be it.
---
I want this
---
Go ham on your thesis now so you can go ham on the blood hunt later. It's worth it.
---
I will, Game Over.
---
Yep! It's post match as well, so you're not capped at the usual 32,000.
---
I'm not sure, honestly I heard that game is trash, it's fun but trash. Not my opinion but that's what I herrrr
---
Just to be clear, you're arguing that we should balance the Pig around a team of noobs who doesn't know to take off the RBT? Because that would be fair? These folks don't even know the basic mechanics, and that's the Pig's burden to carry?
---
I’m ready for my Sidney Prescott.
---
The day nurse gets nerfed I quit.
---
She's the only true killer that scares survivors.
---
Yes
---
Same, she’s gonna be my forever main lmao
---
I wouldn't ever want anyone to lose their job, but he did a piss-poor job justifying all the nerfs. ESPECIALLY those to the cooldown add-ons, which came today.
---
Why is it bad for Legion to see blood in Frenzy? They can't down anyone with it.
---
Why is it bad for Legion to use Frenzy before it's fully charged? They can't down anyone with it.
---
Ohh damn I didn't even consider that possibility, sorry dude!  Yeah that really sucks for colorblind console players :(
---
I wonder if there's a similar type of software available for TVs?  Definitely a long shot, but the software on PC just applies a color filter, which I imagine is possible to do on a TV as well.

Ask her to put a trap on my head and enjoy the entirety of the date considering it won’t kill me when it’s time for me to go out the exit.
---
I agree with you, TR thing was kinda dumb. As I said in my OP the endgame change I am grateful for but you are also right in that it takes away from her identity. And it does ruin her endgame potential. Pig had GREAT endgame potential before and the devs are gonna let egc ruin it. In my mind the best solution would be to pause egc if someone has an rbt and it would be like it was before, but even more in the pigs favor bc she could close the hatch on the last survivor. We would still have an endgame pig.
---
Pig at endgame is a joke. A smart pig will never let you live if the door are open and you have a trap. Most players are noob, therefor most die to a trap in endgame, therefor they're nerfing it
---
Hard Pass.
---
On the offer and the character.
---
He's obviously mentally ill and shouldn't be trusted to make important decisions that affect game play. He obviously sucks at his job. Instead of reworking legion this idiot just blanket nerfed him and game him 0.2 movement speed. You have to be a moron to support such lazy game design from a mentally ill weirdo.
---
I personally use my traps pretty early in the game to slow down generator progression (and occasionally kill survivors who go for saves with their trap active and don't respect Timer and Sketch), so the nerfs don't affect me too much (they reverted the terror radius change). However, it feels like kind of a slap in the face to Pig players, as it cuts off certain strategies and makes the traps useless after EGC triggers. Pig is a killer who hasn't gotten a lot of love, besides the crouch buff a little while ago. Half of her addons are completely unviable, and her dash attack is usually worse than just uncrouching (except at the beginning of the game, and with certain addons at certain loops). I thought the devs had mostly forgotten about her, and then finally EGC comes along and opens up some interesting strategies with pig, and the devs just nerf her. Personally, it's more insulting than game-ruining.
---
No negative apart from the fact that he can't down people with it and has a Nurse-level stun at the end.
---
I definitely need to play a lot then. I'm still trying to get those essential survivor perks like adrenaline.
---
Øink!
---
You can have 4k hours 4k every game play optimally and they will still call you bby killer
---
we are getting pamela voorhees you dumb shit
---
Monto's ptb Legion video showed how strong 2.5 could be.  he didn't even need to chase anybody for more than 10 seconds after hitting them with that first feral frenzy hit.  I think it'll be more valuable to test how 3 seconds works on the ptb now.
---
Ranger/Police Jake would be great.
---
you typed "coming from a hag main" when she is one of three killers in the game able to pressure the map effectively with their power (the other two being billy and nurse, albeit hag comes with a caveat which is setup time).
---
other killers, like a huntress or a clown, are not bad killers in their own right. what they lack, however, are ways to pressure the map effectively: probably the single most important thing a killer needs in this game, and it's the reason why billy and nurse are far and away better than everyone else. 
---
it's true that there is a lot a killer can do to create pressure and snowball, no arguing with you there, but the gist of the argument is that some killers struggle A LOT more with accomplishing that as opposed to others, to the point where people just say "fuck it" and boot up their billy or nurse for another spin because they are tired of not performing as well.
---
I'mma be honest, I've mained pig since release and as soon as I saw this I was like "welp gonna regret checking this out, but here we go." and then after I read for a bit I couldn't stop thinking about how you typo'd RBT as "RTB" multiple times and now I can't even concentrate on anything else.
---
Thanks op.
---
No problem my friend
---
I’m guessing them didn’t have a GG   Why bother even going thru the trouble to message them?
---
I mean no disrespect, but could you go into detail as to why? Or perhaps give some alternatives? Leader of the Pack isn’t an indefinite effect, I could increase the time it takes for the screams of death throes to trigger...
---
Ohhh I get it. It kills old people.
---
The only time they will slug you is if you take a hit while they’re carrying someone. Usually, in these cases they can’t afford to drop the carries person as it’ll progress the wiggle too far and let them escape if they do.
---
But you’d better be running tenacity and hope the killer isn’t running deerstalker as otherwise othe killer will still be find you even after taking time to hook the survivor they were carrying.
---
Did you meet the typical survivor swf group who think they are good at the game Tbag you flashlight clicks you and tries to loop you whole game but they suck and you kill them so they accuse you of being a camper and a tunneler?
---
Learn how to pallet loop
---
It was a gg though. I was gonna give him kudos for running me for so long and saving his team so effectively.
---
Ohio servee should cover east coast right?
---
This.
---
Devs only seem to revert changes when the community is *extremely*  vocal.
---
&gt; Of course a character like this should exist, sure she's a little OP but if you put in time to get really good at something why not make that something really strong?
---
This is such a stupid way of balancing things and it's very concerning that so many people that play this game thinks this is how it should be balanced lol...
---
I DISAGREE THAT WGLF SHOULD GET A BUFF. MY OPINION IS BBQ IS BETTER, BUT YOU HAVE THREE TEAMMATES AND I'M ALL ALONE. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF PERKS BEING EQUAL, YOU LITERALLY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO USE DISCORD AND COORDINATE YOUR SAVES/LOOPS/FLASHLIGHTS ETC AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T DISCORD, YOU STILL HAVE FOUR PEOPLE AGAINST LITTLE OLD ME. KILLERS SHOULD GET SOME GOOD PERKS AND EXTRA POINTS IMO TO GO ALONG WITH THE EXTRA STRESS OF DEALING WITH ALL OF YOU. EVERYONE HAS AN OPINION, THIS IS MINE AFTER FAR TOO MANY HOURS OF PLAY ON BOTH SIDES. ANYWAY, GG WP!
---
I main survivor, and I point out my toxic teammates to the killer. I'm a huge killer-apologist lmao.
---
Try to not run as much, given it leaves scratch marks the killer can follow. Also, and this is what I'm doing you don't have to, go Claudette and try to get her to 40 asap for her teachable perk Self Care. That will unlock it for anyone to have a chance to get it in their bloodweb.
---
Doing Feng, you?
---
Check this one out [https://youtu.be/0LusX\_1PUm0?t=45](https://youtu.be/0LusX_1PUm0?t=45)

You fucking got me, lmao.
---
I think they can just use the old version where it lowered deep wounds but rework the mixtape add on
---
Oooh edgy. What are you, twelve?
---
I don't see many doctors but when I do it's great. Good job :)

add a 3/5/7% Haste effect for 120 seconds to Left Behind
---
That would make people want dc
---
People are mostly coming around I think
---
I've read some awful things on this subreddit but this might be the worst... how does painting your nails make you mentally ill? People can express themselves however they want.
---
He can't down anyone sure but he gets an insta down on them after and forces them to mend or die, not to mention the blood lust that reveals others
---
True, like use a killers special ability on a survivor, or SLAP ‘EM ON A MEAT HOOK FOUR TIMES!

---
Pm me if you have discord and wanna play later
---
I don’t think so and I would *really* rather the community have had a chance to play with her as is. If her kill/pip rate exceeds norms then we can talk about changes.
---
Hype is hype 🤷‍♂️
---
I think the point of the daily challenges is to get players to try new things, hence why there are so many different rituals
---
Comming from a hag main was there to counter the "downvotes from salty survivors". I MOSTLY play hag, not ONLY. I can still keep up pressure while playing killers like Wraith or Clown
---
It NEVER makes sense to dc.
---
Oooh so smart, What are you, eleven?
---
Should be here within the next few weeks, since they seem to be releasing all those leaked cosmetics now.
---
I mean the endgame collapse timer? Not the trap timer?
---
Oh fuck yea bud!
---
1 I guess it's confirmed that we are getting Ghostface in DbD.
---
2 Why do we even want a licensed killer that has NO POWERS?
---
3 I hate everyone that is stupid enough to think Ghostface can hang with Myers or Freddy, never mind Nurse or even Spirit. I'm not talking about viability in the trials, but how they are just human and nothing about them is actually scary, powerful, or mystical. They make prank calls and they have always failed/died. 
---
4 I have every DLC. My steam wallet will be happy to not have to buy an extremely mediocre killer from a psudo satire horroresque movie.
---
Yeup. They argued that if you put a trap on in the collapse - say with just fifteen seconds left - then the survivor wouldn't have time to search a box and get out. 
---
If you're downed in the collapse, you're doomed anyway unless the killer is greedy. I really don't know why they're trying to save survivors from RBT deaths that will still occur by other means.
---
Yeah, but I only have so many matches I can play in a day, and if I have to waste 3 games playing a killer just to complete their daylie seems backwards.
---
^^^ This
---
The lack off any acknowledgement about the ongoing audio issues is really, really concerning. I'm not dealing with another six months of busted sounds - if they don't fix it this time, I'm done with this game.
---
It is so vehemently unacceptable that this continues to happen repeatedly, and it takes longer and longer to fix.
---
His performance is actually up slightly now because of that movement speed buff, but he is a much less interesting character. He can't get looped now either and playing him with cooldown add-ons makes him a nightmare.
---
I agree, but its cool that people have a choice, there are a lot of interesting packs
---
Fried bananaers is worth giving up hatch standoff. Also cute pics of pet. Or answering a riddle. Kinda wish the game had in game voice. 
---
"STOP RUNNING I JUST WANT TO LOOKAT YUR SKIN!"
---
The RBT is still nerfed but if they are wearing them when last gen pops the timer will go down and they can't exit. I personally use all my traps by last gen pop anyways so um happy.
---
Is it possible you could change the end game timer to treat the RBT as a sacrifice state and extend it?  That is to say, if a survivor has the RBT on the EGC timer would extend by adding the remaining time left on the RBT to itself.  That could help maintain the pigs end game capability while respecting EGC.
---
“On a hunch”
---
Are you fucking kidding me? The very FIRST FUCKING THING pig mains considered when this was announced was “oh shit! I can use my RBT in endgame and camp the boxes! FREE KILLS BECAUSE THEY WONT HAVE TIME!!!”  
---
Now they find out they won’t be able to do that and they have a fucking hissy fit about it. It was not a hunch, it was the truth. Why else do I see so many posts about people disappointed that “endgame pig” won’t be a thing? 
---
Also, let’s reiterate my last post. 
---
PLAYER. TEST. BOX. 
---
They are TESTING and gathering STATISTICS right now. 
---
Good freaking god, 
---
“They’re not testing the way I want!”
---
Get the fuck over yourself.
---
Yeah, this is the lesser of two evils. The escape mechanic is the real issue.
---
The person asking the questions almost asked how it was a buff but stopped herself.
---
Excuse me? How do you think he gets an insta down on anyone when they have 4 FULL SECONDS to run away where he cant move
---
You cant really nerf a swf
---
Both
---
OINK OINK
---
Tbh, it feels like 8/10 randoms just run without a plan and thus things like that occur
---
Yeah legion like only they can insta down using their power. And it just looks like they pounce on you and stab at you a dozen times.
---
It's a good point, just asking out of curiosity. However the one time I did it, I was trying to blind her normally while she was chasing after someone else that was already injured. So I agree, in a situation where she is chasing you, not good at all.
---
Even the situation I described above is rare, but it's just a cool fact that I was unaware of until recently.
---
DEAR 90% OF SURVIVORS POPULATION,
---
YOU'RE SELFISH BASTARDS, G-O F-U-C-K Y-O-U-R-S-E-L-F!
---
WITH BURNING PASSION FROM, 10% OF TEAM PLAYING SURVIVORS.
---
I was thinking the same thing, I played a hag game for the first time today, for dailies, and I'm definitely gonna play her more. Way more fun than I thought :)
---
Maybe Ghostface will be a skin for Legion. How hilarious and disappointing would that be.
---
I'm getting married on May 4th..... Goddammit
---
i dont get people who come for anything other than memes. On No Meme Thursdays i swear every post was "Nerf DS", "Buff No Mither", "Freddy Rework Ideas"
---
Like I get those were serious issues but did we need an entire day, every week, to talk about those things? BTW Shoutout to those people it took 3 years but we finally killed DS
---
We can even open the door for them now
---
People do this all the time to me working on gens. I want to say it's not intentional but if I am on the run and I hear a gen being worked on I'll try to go a different way. If someone just seen you there working and they lead the killer there then I think that is intentional. I have had people slam pallets to block my path in chase before so it definitely happens on purpose some.
---
Just use your traps during the match, I don't know why people are going crazy with this. To some extent I feel bad for pig mains too but they're acting like they removed her traps entirely and left you only with the crouch. The only real problem is her terror radius cancelling the timer.
---
Umm the ptb isnt over yet. Calm down
---
Still time to cancel it! Congrats though :)
---
Legion has no powers. None of these characters had powers before they were brought to the Entity’s realm except Freddy. Leatherface *still* doesn’t have a power other than his chainsaw.
---
Whoever has twitter, just follow, then unfollow once something is announced.
---
Yeah if it’s a map like the game and I don’t know where I’m going I might run by a teammate to make some distance. But it’s only if I don’t know the map.
---
You gotta oink
---
This is the ideal Claudette player. You may not like it, but this is what peak immersion looks like.
---
I like this idea a lot.
---
Then just don't do the dailies? The BP gain isn't that great anyway
---
Where’s the patch notes for these legion+pig nerfs? I can’t find it
---
ok the reactions to these pig changes are just embarrasing at this point.
---
Lol no.
---
&gt;There's going to be sarcastic twats who say "bye" and call me bad or whatever
---
Bye, git gud bad baby killer. 
---
Sincerely, A Sarcastic Twat
---
The already reverted the TR change when is this going to stop?
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Maybe because the A was part of the original subtitle. Just a guess though. I didn't downvote.
---
Imagine if all survivors got a headgear cosmetics. -confused pig oink-
---
I wave my arms cause I'm bored and about to pull the trigger on these attempt to escapes and then letting go
---
OK but what about the Endgame nerf?
---
Because honestly that's the big nerf here.
---
You're talking out of your ass.
---
Feel free to PM me as well if you want more people to play with. I'm 520 ish hours mostly killer but I'm playing a lot more survivor lately, got no issue helping and teaching^^
---
True, but I can see how they prevented a terrible thing possibly happening and, like old Legion, players abusing it until a PTB fixed it. The EGC created a lose win lose for the devs when involving the pig
---
The rbts not going off when you go through the gate is arguably a change made to go with egc not really a 'nerf'. Simply put if rbts went off when you left the gate the pig would be to powerful with egc.
---
No? Its like any game, have something stronger than most other things that also takes more skill than other things, put in the time to get good. I also mentioned a way to nerf her without completely killing the character entirely.
---
Yea that’s why I just run kindred in solo
---
I mean selfcare is lame.... waste of spot also.. I havent ran that shit since like October or november.
---
Oh I do, but ive seen on the forums a community manager say this is DIRECTLY a stress tests and see how it goes. Thank god they test it and not just release it garbage first
---
4 man SWF = no perks
---
3 man SWF = 2 perks
---
2 man SWF = 3 perks
---
etc.
---
I'm tired of the Pig circlejerk on this sub. I didnt like the changes either but you lot go too far sometimes...if only you people were this passionate about the true problems of this game
---
It got mixed reviews. I actually enjoyed it but there were also alot of people who think it's not really good. I think it's not as good as the original movie but atleast ties with Halloween 2 as the best Sequel for the series.
---
His base movement speed buff surprisingly made a lot of difference, but he is still kinda boring and mediocre now.
---
That's not a decent game that's 0 fun for anyone.. slugging is bs.
---
Bye.
---
Yeah that's cool and all, but the biggest nerf still is the fact that the RBT wont be activated if you place it on a survivor's head after the last gen gets done.
---
AAAAH GIORNO BE GENTLE
---
It seems like no matter what cool update they have for this game they just cant help but mess something good up that fans clearly want. Do they look at the subreddit? Sometimes it just feels like they don’t acknowledge anything we want and when they do they say ‘its coming’ only for it to never release or take years to happen
---
**28 STAB WOUNDS**
---
Find a playstyle. If you're a gen jockey there's perks for it, if you're more altruistic there's perks for that, there's stealth, theres the runner, then there's the memes. Personally I like stealth and have an aura based stealth build with urban evasion. 
---
Read the perk info on character sheets and play around with the perks you have. Play around with items as well, some people prefer tools, medkits, some flashlights. Play the game trying to find what you're comfortable with and what's fun, and don't worry about "winning" until you figure it out. A nice thing to do is have different build types on different characters. You can add challenges into the mix later on, like wearing neon clothes while running stealth for instance.
---
Because everyone knows the Pig is one of the strongest killers in the game, correct? So this one thing, even though the end game collapse gives 2 minutes to leave and the time is extended if someone is downed or on a hook, is just not enough time. 
---
Do you people even comprehend the bullshit you're spewing? Don't answer because we know you don't.
---
Nice bming for no reason jackass
---
Cornvision isn't fixed by changing brightness.
---
Coldwind and Lery's are the maps where Nurse struggles the most.
---
Maybe also Mother's Dwelling if you don't have range addons.
---
well that sucks but don't let it get you down we need more positive attitudes out here glhf
---
Keep reeing some more.
---
They're not changing anything else. They just nerfed Legion's add-ons that affect the stun when exiting frenzy for extra spite. You can say whatever and hand waive everything but this is the honest to god truth: people will drop the game once these changes go live.
---
I never really put much thought into how much you use one over the other. I think you should just keep at it the best you can without overthinking that stuff too much. It'll all flow naturally once you get more settled into keyboard and mouse.
---
I'd change the penalty for missing an attack from a complete cancelation to taking away 4 seconds from current duration, to make it less punishable to try hitting multiple survivors.
---
something that also came to my mind was making it so after being hit by Feral Frenzy your generator repair speed is reduced by 10% until healed to make people actually want to heal up
---
Uhmm ok? Way to just be all like "Im right and your wrong." Thats fine though I'm done talking to you
---
Im on ps4. 90% of people who do it think it means come get me.
---
But the add-ons aren't working...
---
HAH!
---
I feel like tvs and monitors should have those settings built in. If not that's a whole new thing we need to bring up
---
brutal killer = 1 pip
---
It would be possible, sure, but it's a little more tricky than it seems. Picture this scenario, for example:
---
* The end game starts while a survivor is being chased. They go down \~30 seconds later.
---
* The sit on the hook for around a minute while the killer guards them (very likely in the end-game) before you make a save. (After factoring in the time from the hook, the timer is half up.)
---
* Since the killer is guarding the survivor, they end up downing you as you make the save. They give you a hat and put you on the hook instead.
---
* Shortly after, you get unhooked (but for whatever reason you aren't chased).
---
Now you have a trap on your head and you have about a minute to remove it and leave. Unless you're incredibly lucky and get the trap off in the first box or two, that's it for you, it's over. This type of thing wouldn't be to uncommon. Even if it doesn't happen to you, it can very easily happen to one of the survivors in the match. This might have been doable when the timer was three minutes, but now that it's down to two minutes, it can be extremely tight.
---
It's something we can still consider, but there's a little more to it than it seems on paper.
---
It wouldn’t tho.
---
Red is the easiest color for most people to see.
---
I’m only asking that the color changes
---
Everything is doubled.. so if 3 people use Bloody Party streamers you get 600% BP post game PLUS double what you got from the actual game. 
---
It's not uncommon as killer to get over 100k every game
---
its worth checking if they have bond (or another way of finding you) if they do it was definitely intentional if they don't they might have just already committed to running your way and going somewhere else would screw them over.
---
Every little bit of bonus BP is nice, just cuz they aren't that great to you doesn't mean I can't use it.
---
Yeah OP maybe don’t start a thread and then respond to people like a condescending prick if they have a different opinion to you?
---
You won't be able to cheese uncounterable no skill downs with Legion anymore ohhhhh noooooooooooooo.  The walls are closing in the sky is falling, the Mayans predicted this they just got the date wrong.....seriously man it will all be okay.  You'll just have to actually earn your downs with him moving forward.
---
He sent out a dbd related tweet 2 hours after this so it's gotta be ghostface coming
---
... Did somebody say Slippery Meat?
---
i played it casually and my Level 1 Legion had every Killer perk and 30 of each add on by the end of it... the cheaper gift boxes helped a ton then
---
I love this build so much.
---
You know some of the most wildly successful people throughout history have had history of mental illness right? Is that really something worth degrading something over? I bet if he made changes you liked you'd be all for his appearance, because hed cater to you.
---
I hope to never see a legion again honestly
---
I wish everyone understood that if they didn’t nerf her traps at the end game, she would be STUPID OP and it would get abused so much
---
Seems alright. Having 4 survivors in a lobby without a killer was weird.
---
It'll probably be rough on killers especially while they iron out the bugs, but it'll be worth the stress in the long term I think.
---
Where do you submit PTB feedback?
---
Thank you for this. What everybody wanted to say
---
As if eating the CD on legion wasn't bad enough...
---
Now revert the other bullshit nerfs and while they're at it also revert the pointless terror radius increase from her last "buff", then it'll be fine
---
You did one gen and got rescues in each game, that already makes you more useful than 50% of survivors.
---
If the killers slaughtered your team as well as you, you were probably at least equal to your teammates in skill.
---
IMO self care wastes far too much time, killers often find you before you can finish healing. Med kits are much faster and better, a yellow kit with +8 charges and scissors is very useful and fairly common.
---
If you notice a killer coming in your direction, book it early to the strongest loop you can get to. It takes alot of hours in this game to learn every map layout and the best loops on them.
---
It also helps if you want to lose the killer, running early prevents bloodlust, keeping the killer slower, even if they are following your scratches. If you got a good head start on an approaching killer, you may be able to lose them once you reach an area with LOS breakers.
---
Spine chill is a great perk for being sure when a killer is heading your way, especially against stealthy killers who are very strong at low ranks.
---
Keep in mind if the chase music is playing, the killer got close enough and will speed up following you, and you most likely need to drop pallets to slow them down. Bloodlust resets when they break pallets, but not when they vault windows.
---
I would stay out of lockers, most killers check them when they lose you.
---
Also split up when doing gens, if a killer finds multiple people on one gen, they all have to leave that gen. This is worse than one survivor leaving a gen.
---
If you're a PC player you should have no problem finding mentors on discord, I'm a console pleb so I can only help through text lol.
---
if they go for that hope would kind of be pointless maybe some sort aura or alert when a killer is near exit gates or hatch?
---
If it causes less disconnects and they minimize the lag then I am all for it.
---
Which ones are you disconnecting against, specifically?
---
An average billy will be way better than an average nurse is what I meant.
---
Same lol
---
I don’t ever respond to anyone as killer usually. Survivors usually have nothing nice to say after a ruthless 4K.
---
I thought SA would be left out,
---
Like we always have been
---
Imagine if it’s nothing to do with dbd and he’s just feeding into all this attention no one ever gave him prior to this clown fiesta of twitter spamming.
---

Yeah, from the way things are shaping up - I'm shaping to be a **Gen Jockey** 🤣🤣
---
I just want to feel like I contributed in a match.
---
I never claimed voctory oer the war, I claimed victory over a battle.
---
Cry harder
---
Is it live? I don't see a diff. I don't think the servers are connected yet.
---
Traps were a pressure tool after gens were done it allowed you to juggle multiple survivors in games that move quickly with or without ruin. They just flat out removed it because they didnt see the implications of what they removed and now pig can't apply any pressure after gens are powered unless they run noed or the survivors aren't running borrowed time/adrenaline and you are lucky enough to get one down as gates are powered.
---
Damn, what did you do to get facecamped 10 times in a row?
---
And as I said before, I get it’s a tactic I said nothing bad about it.
---
Precisely. I know why these people act like anything but massive outcry results in prompt changes.
---
This is gold
---
Jesus! That's fucking awesome.
---
Im seriously not having a good time dude

---
😭 it'll never happen again. I swear!
---
I found out what the change was before you answered and this is my personal take on it. I am copying my post from another thread.      I don't think this was a nerf but a buff. If someones trap pauses you know that they are near you in your terror radius. It is like having whispers except there are only a few spots on the map that people with traps want to occupy. With monitor and abuse, you could always locate the nearest box and find/down the surv when your hud shows the trap pausing. I really liked that change.
---
I'm sorry 😭
---
THE FUCKING FACT THAT EVERYONE IN THIS GOD FUCKING JESUS RAPING ANIMAL ABUSING COMUNNITY IS SO FUCKING TOXIC AND COMPLAIN ABOU EVERYTHING.
---
Hahahaha
---
I heard that Myers gives alot of Jump scares!
---
How do you even get into the PTB?
---
I mean obviously I'm nott going to just go in and REEEEE about the pig changes, genuinely curious to try it out a little bit.
---
Maybe a perk that actives when the gates are powered like noed that give you a action speed increase. Unhook faster heal faster open gates faster.
---
It's my opinion that it's incredibly selfish to dc.
---
I agree:
---
OP, this kinda feels like you're just highlighting something everyone knows (there are toxic people in the community) and making yourself look worse by calling them out for it.
---
Beautiful work! 
---
Feng min is the best XD
---
Pick your poison (and go ahead and kill the optimist if you really don't agree I guess) but honestly, I disliked Remember Me because I hated having to try and tunnel a survivor to gain stacks. Save The Best For Last is just now emphasized as the better Obsession perk, and Blood Warden is now more dangerous than ever. 
---
While Remember Me was certainly powerful, the degree of tunneling required sucked at Tier 3 so I'm at least happier with the lower stack count. But I will agree that it should be 20 seconds instead of 16 for no apparent reason.
---
Hope works when all gens are poped, Left Behind works when you are the last guy alive. They could also stack when the killer closes the hatch when you are the last one alive. I wouldn't really mind it, killer can run as fast as you, so it's not like you'd easily go ahead and open the door. 
---
reminder, closing the hatch starts the collapse, which now is 2 minutes, the same as hope and my suggestion
---
Thank you too! 👍🏾
---
That's not entirely true. Let me throw a scenario your way.
---
* Survivor is being chased as the end game starts. They go down \~30-45 seconds later.
---
* They get hooked, the killer camps (fair enough, don't want them to escape).
---
* You make a save with under a minute left on the timer, getting downed in the process.
---
* You now get trapped.
---
Now you have under a minute to get your trap off and escape.
---
That's not an incredibly uncommon scenario. If that were to happen, you would basically have to get incredibly lucky to escape in time.
---
you know i think this is a really good idea i'd go for it tho i could see someone going for a you can't hook me build with that ash perk that turns recovery into wiggle bar but even then i still think its a good idea
---
Now that's motivational, thank you
---
So, you have no issue against insta-saw billy, iridescent stone bear traps, silent bell wraith, prayer beads spirit, iri head huntress, frank's mix tape, 5 blink nurse, any I'm missing?
---
As a killer main I would use Leader of the Pack and mercilessly tunnel the obsession. I'd pair it with dying light, monstrous shrine, and iron grip. I'd drag the obsession to the basement and make sure they were dead asap. 
---
His hound negates the need for whispers or BBQ&amp;Chili and if nothing else the scream perk can take the place of monstrous shrine. 
---
Yea this killer would OP as fuck and I would use him to shit on every SWF team I met.
---
Alright. I can appreciate that. That doesn’t mean my opinion makes no sense, but thanks for explaining your POV.
---
Dude, when you wake up do you curse the day and sulk? Honest the amount of pessissium is a little too high. This game, flaws and all, has survived 'this game will kill DbD' as well as a game from the same company dying. Again why would a small developer, out of spite, drive players away?
---
that's your problem? I like the nerf as it sounds but what about the doors being close to each other? They just said deal with it next game they won't be close I promise. That's the most idiotic excuse to avoid putting efort into your own game to fix issues it has. BHVR covers up issues with other ffeatures instead of ffixing the issues making the imbalance bigger and bigger.
---
I... I did not know this was a thing. Thank you for enlightening me. I shall now venture forth into the depths of this subreddit.
---
Just because I didnt mention it doesnt mean I have no issues with them. Read my original post buddy instead of trying to pick apart a comment.
---
Survivor chase sound is played 2 times, and you can hit the obsession to get a free Pwyf stack even though you never let them go.
---
And Freddy has a whole 7 seconds where he can't do anything to anyone. 
---
He gets it after because of how it works.
---
I do too but they need some changes
---
Bold man
---
Nobody blames you, enjoy your peace!
---
Its small things sure but surviviors still control the pace of the game more then killers do.
---
Hey man. Git gud.
---
Sincerely, 
---
A guy whose played fucking Freddy even in the high ranks
---
A survivor buff lol
---
What was the reasoning behind this? Aren't traps suppose to kill you if you try to escape the gates with them on?
---
Ugh, oh well it was fun while it lasted
---
Nevermind, fuckdisshitimout
---
Exactly.
---
People wanting her to be the same in the Endgame update are just crazy.
---
I like how people are more positive about this but you need to help me out here a bit so I can see it too. Let's take Wraith, a killer that I really enjoy playing and that nobody thinks is very powerful, and tell me how new Legion is better or more fun than him in anyway? 
---
Wraith has no power cooldowns, can get first hits on people easy, can move around fast between gens, can use power on demand, doesn't get stunned or lose power on stuns or misses. You can even negate pallets with him if you move to them ahead of survivors in stealth. With old Legion you could've said the vaulting made him better but now you need to regular chase and M1 them down anyway, same as Wraith. 
---
Or if you go for the 'stalling' angle, both Freddy and the Pig move 115 speed and can stall better and they don't have power downsides either. I guess I just can't see a single actual upside or a thing that Legion does better than anyone else in the game now, and the more unique gameplay got replaced with the style that half a dozen killers use already.
---
Loop her around a litle bit then drop palet on her and the do the clicky clicky thing.
---
No it isn't, especially since EGC is only 2 minutes now.
---
If you use her RBTs early, you won't see endgame often anyway.
---
shut up and take my money
---
Yeah, this is nerf was the one I could live with. It had the silver lining of having a baby whispers attached.
---
Exact same on PS4. This game is actually pretty relaxing and fun when played without PMs. As killer, you can play fair and not see false accusations after every match. As survivor, you don't have to see accusations of killing the team when it was the others who were sandbagging...
---
Even when I play SWF I find myself getting a little worked up at times, but when playing solo or killer, it's easier to not sweat the outcomes with no communication to any other players.
---
(:)
---
This was my first time playing it as I’ve pretty much survivor main (as you can see from my Michaels perks lol) and I really haven’t had so much fun as a killer before!
---
I don't believe this statement. If you actually played Freddy then you'd recognize that the nerfs are incredibly unfair. So I'm going to wager that you're a guy who just say's you play Freddy or you consider high rank to be rank 10 or you made it to high rank once OR you're one of those weirdos that's content just getting points and doesn't care about the mountain of problems with this game. If so, you remind me of a lobotomy victim who enjoys getting bullied.
---
Nobody but the devs fault this new patch is ridiculous too.
---
This is a TF2 reference, right?
---
Because the killer knowing where the whole team is, is really strong. Bbq gives you 5 seconds and is the best perk in the game. Maybe make it 3 seconds. 25 is ludicrous. Also when you kill the obsession, seeing the rest of the team forever is just way way too long. Maybe 10 seconds but i still dont like the idea because it encourages you to tunnel the obsession. Imagine an evil within 3 myers downs the obsession then finds the rest of the tram, or a nurse.
---
Don't forget that the game was utter expensive and most of the DLC did cost like 75% of the actual game price. I don't have anyone in my friend list who wanted to buy the game filled with DLC content for ~200$.
---
Could say the same to survivors who endlessly complain about everything and ragequit when playing against a killer they don't like.
---
I got tired of being the fair killer. I play toxic now xD tunnel I camp if I need to and I actually love when survivors DC.  Those honourable killer days are over.  Since survivors all they do is tea bag and being toxic. :P
---
I hadn't heard of this. 
---
I'll try and use it from now on, but i'd be surprised if even 20% of console players know about this.
---
leader of the packs problem is how long it lasts the plague perk contagious fear(?) was basically this but not tied to the obsession and it was ABSURD on nurse. leader definitely lasts to long and it being permanent on kill would definitely be too much. death throws makes loosing the killer impossible if you scream every 10 seconds that's way to much. instincts is interesting i think it could be a good idea tho i wonder about how it would actually play out. As for the characters power its a sort of single(?) target doctor which I'm not to sure about it seems like this killer would just get a bunch of complaints about how you just get looped. A power that helps catch survivor rather than find them are generally more desirable.
---
OwO what's this?
---
Problem is every time a player adds constructive criticism about killer nerfs they get downvoted into oblivion and insulted by entitled baby survivors.
---
Can confirm. Why I learned to use billy
---
I feel like he's still the second least-effective killer, after Freddy. When people say killers are 'bad', they don't mean that they're impossible to 4K with or something, just that they're bad in comparison to the others.
---
Ummm I am a killer main. Hell I main Legion. I can understand why Legion was changed because of how certain things were exploits. I cannot see the reason behind the cooldown add-ons nerf but I have not played. Maybe with the original change it offered no counter play? Who knows except Behavior.
---
Ah fair point, I didn’t look at it from that perspective. Might I ask what you think of the power?
---
I mean you could have walked towards her and got hit
---
They served us a burger on a garbage can lid, then when we protested they gave us back the lettuce and asked if it was better. That's how I feel about it. 
---
It means nothing. 
---
Revert all the fucking changes to Pig, not just one. Just because they weren't creative enough with the End Game Collapse shouldn't have meant that the Pig had to suffer for it with nerfs.
---
As someone against this pig nerf, I actually didn't mind this part of the change(I disliked the endgame part), but I would've liked to have seen a compensating buff to her crouch ability.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Yeah man, I'm trying to pitch in for the team by at least being in on a Generator Completion.
---
Problem is, and looks like it's going to be for a ***long*** while - I'm terrible at the chase.
---
She wasnt hitting her. She went afk
---
She's not that heavily impacted by that change, Pig's viability didn't really rest on her endgame potential in the first place. It was a nice element of her power for some more dedicated builds, but it wasn't a core part of her strength- definitely not something she's crippled without.
---
Splinter Cell Myers for the win!
---
I would consider him buffed now. Monto and Farmer John are both fans of the changes; now you just hit a guy w frenzy, chase after them, end it and M1 them down. No incentive to hit multiple times with DW anymore. It's boring, but I'd argue it makes him stronger than before. If they didn't change the way frenzy worked it would have been stuck in a shitty mess. 
---
Imo I think they should scrap Legion though, the mechanics are dog crap and when the changes go live Legion is gonna be getting 4ks all day.
---
I use all my traps 90% of the time before last gen so I am happy.  I would  say I get 1 head pop out of 10 games. Now and then it does secure a last kill but most if the time they would just get hatch anyways. Not that big of a deal to me but it does kill end game build so I do understand.
---
There's nothing wrong with not wanting to hear from you. If they didn't hear it in-game then they probably don't want to.
---
Pic is of a hot guy
---
Anna, throw me!
---
You and me both.
---
Oh, I didn’t know it was known. Thank you.
---
Who is this guy exactly
---
The numbers on it are very bad though. It speeds the sacrifice by like 10 seconds or something
---
Right? Everyone was losing their minds on this subreddit over the changes, when they haven’t even seen how Legion performs in-game yet. The changes are actually surprisingly good! The duration has been bumped up, which gives them time to travel across the map and catch other survivors. Hopefully BHVR doesn’t revert the changes or I just might cry.
---
I heard someone say that headshots equal instadown now on PTB.
---
Nah just pat yourselves on the back and think acting like children is what you have to do to get what you want.
---
Fools are sleeping on Frank. I'd rather play either dude over the wheezy girls.
---
No. Please. Don't abandon Freddy's rework. They've worked so hard on Legion and Pig. /s
---
I switch roles as well, but this quote can be applied too both roles. If you’re getting tunneled then accept your situation and have fun with it. Adapt to the situation. Don’t give the toxic killer/survivor what they want by becoming emotionally compromised. It’s a good test to temper your mental for future things around the corner in life.
---
You mean like how survivor mains (over 500 of them) review bombed the game's steam page when the devs said they were looking into changing DS? 
---
I'm amazed at how hypocritical you retards are.
---
Valid mechanic, too. Allowing killers to prepare their 4 perks and 1 offering against their opponent's 16 perks and 4 items, or defer the match, prevents more of the problem you and I are complaining about; in-game disconnects. On the other hand you can't allow survivors to have visibility on their opponent because then certain killers couldn't get matches, players would just take Wraith and Trapper lobbies or something and it would hurt variety across all ranks. Each survivor plays the same though, so while P3 Claudettes probably spend more time in the lobby than other survivors, she can still get matches. 
---
So yeah I get that it's annoying to have to re-queue, but IMO it's a necessary evil right now.
---
I think it's doubled at the end of everything.  If there are 2 BPS and you scored 10k points, you're total at the end of the match will be 60k.
---
True and I did use it that way a couple times,but consider the fact that you dont want to be in a chase or down the one person NOT doing gens. Thats the same reason you dont tunnel simeone with a trap on. If they are your only option sure,but going out of your way to do so by using these pseudo-wispers would be detrimental to pig ,ya get what im saying ?
---
Another Wraith.
---
Poor Amanda's not out of the woods yet though, Stefy the puppet and Behavsaw still have diabolical plans for her, and she's still lost her arm! But hopefully she can be improved by the torture to come.
---
My Shirtless Myers always gets 3-4K games unless I’m being lazy and wanna just have some straight fun, hell my nurse normally can get 2-4K games pending on the map. I play on PS4, and I’ve just started playing huntress and have a act of hitting people with those hatchets at distance. Camping is boring and you don’t pip and the survivors don’t pip either if they can’t be chased and get the unhook points for the emblem.
---
If you found a killer you enjoy playing and a strategy that works for you and your having fun then fuck the salty survivors. 
---
They’re gonna bitch and complain no matter what you do, and they always have a laundry list of bullshit “rules” they’ve pulled out of their ass that you somehow broke because it’s easier to call you a cheater then admit they fucked up and got killed. 
---
You play how you like and play what you enjoy. If you play how the survivors want you to play then you’ll pretty much be facing a corner not doing anything while two survivors rush gens and the other two tea bag around you then spam “gg ez baby killer” in the chat afterwards.
---
Nice so it’s joey, also will you make a video on all the announced cosmetics?
---
IM LITERALLY CARLY RIGHT NOW
---
Omg thank you... I'm not the only one who thinks this way. I've had randoms cleanse over and over again. Makes me crazy. Meanwhile I'm over here throwing up on my gen lmao..
---
they already had an obvious solution, as they could have simply made EGC timer slow down when someone's trapped, just like it does with hooks and being downed. and there's still no reason to make the trap timer stop in the terror radius instead of a chase, which happens before EGC, as she isn't like Legion at all.
---
People are allowed to not want to talk to you without restricting everyone else. They could be playing other games, but that doesn't even matter. Stop acting sensitive and entitled because someone said "dont message me"
---
It is also a button that you're supposed to use if the comment doesn't contribute anything.
---
Saying "just break LOS against her" is some of the least helpful shit.
---
Mori's aren't broken. You have to get hooked. just don't get hooked
---
good. but sometimes lags when u have 50ms
---
So your score, plus BPS modifier,  then double that total.
---
Big facts
---
Sure, as long as we never touch it. No 250+ pings for me, thanks.
---

---

---
Yeah she just dc'd because he wasn't letting her out
---
This subreddit really is a clusterfuck of salty killer mains with murder-boners and fragile egos. How are you guys saying that the nurse is balanced? And how are you guys saying she’s fun to play? I don’t know about you, but getting down the first five seconds of getting spotted isn’t a very enjoyable use of my time. And you may say “yeah, but you can juke her with walls and lockers.” - 1) A skilled nurse with the right add-ons could miss the survivor’s location with one blink, but easily recorrect it with another. | 2) Even if you were to hop into a locker and miss the Nurse’s swing, you wouldn’t have enough time to make good distance from her, especially if she has Pocket Watch. She has such an incredibly outdated loadout. She literally defies all game mechanics like what every other person is saying. Yeah sure, Legion avoided all counterplaying aspects, but besides being annoying to deal with, the chases were long and by then the killer would have lost a lot of map pressure. I don’t want her to receive the Freddy treatment, considering I’m a Nurse main myself, but there’s definitely room for balance. Maybe the devs could rework the add-ons, remove the extra blink add-ons, maybe even make it harder to turn or reduce her swing range.
---
Most killers don't give a shit about 99% of what you just said. Mettle of Man is bullshit because of no counterplay, and the devs don't give a fuck about changing that because they aren't done cashing in on Ash sales yet. I'm sure they'll eventually balance the perk in about 3 or 4 months when sales peter off.
---
You know that most of the people just run randomly, and even tho it SEEMS they are running to you, is just a coincidence..
---
This all the way, the rework is great, now players are forced to not waste their stabs while in frenzy and chase different survivors to make them spread and in the end focus on the last survivor being stabbed, that and the huge range his survivor detection got now and the speed at which they move now make chasing survivors more fun and challenging.
---
Now moonwalking and tunneling one survivor isn't an option anymore, this brings Legion to a newer tier, before anyone could exploit that with no issue, but now you have to actually think how to chase the survivors.
---
Why, I do main Wraith without perks. How could you tell?
---
i don't even know why they did this were they at a table and said "oh well now that it will take survivors 3 mins to get insta killed we don't want them to fell pressured from the pig, so lets remove the RBT activation from leaving, that will make it a less shitty situation" MY GOD!! the whole point of those traps is to punish those who get caught if you get downed WHEN THE GATES ARE OPEN!!! then you should be punished for it.  
---
tick tock!! get that off your head or your dead!! thats what it should have been!!
---
Go for a other person. Mettle of man happens once a game for 1 hit. If that really fucks you up, just don't play killer
---
If the traps slowed down the timer, no.
---
the people losing their minds were the shit players who exploited Legion to no end, now they are forced to actually play like any other killer player, you know, using your head.
---
Survivors just talk out their asses. I had one game where i got 3k and the last survivor barely made the hatch then the chat afterwards was them spamming “gg ez” and “lol baby killer”. The one spamming “baby killer” was the one I killed first too. He died on his first hook because no one came to save him. I laughed my ass off.
---
I think Nurse and Billy are fine as is. Nurse takes skill to use and Billy is no where near op. MoM is an issue because it invalidates a survivor mistake and allows for situations where a killer won't get anything out of.
---
Jump scares are literally *never* fun for me at anytime, not during movies or video games.
---
Kneejerk overreactions are all Reddit knows though.
---
Says the dickhead who never plays killer.
---
I know they needed to change her for the EGC but I'm saying they need to fix her in other areas if they are going to nerf HER endgame so hard
---
Hug her and assure that it will be ok, rip amanda
---
IF YOU SLAUGHTER ALL SURVIVORS IN TWO AND A HALF MINUTES THE ENTITY IS GONNA BE ALL LIKE "YO WHERE THE FUCK'S ALL THAT HOPE I NEED TO FEED ON AND SHIT" SO YOU'LL HAVE TO PLAY WITH THEM IF YOU'RE STOMPING
---
I feel your pain, I can usually get up to the high green/low purple ranks as killer, but played a lot of survivor this season, decided to play some killer, rank 14, thought i'd get some chill games. have a chance to learn and practice with some different killers, but ...... seriously, why are there so many decent survivors in the yellow ranks? Did the rank system get screwed so much that these players cannot rank up?
---
What adds insult to injury is that wait time for killers in the yellow ranks is getting long, so I am waiting 10-15 minutes for a terrible experience.
---
HALF THE FUN IS MINING SALT!!
---
I disagree that he is the second least effective killer in current PTB form, but I respect where you are coming from. I feel that the devs are trying to bring Legion out of the *bad killers* category, and they have succeeded in some ways and not in others. Why I say Legion is good (and I tried to change the title to be more specific but I don't know how), I mean that he is more viable to play and face against than he was before. This new Legion is more effective than some other killers (in my personal opinion I think he is more effective than Trapper and Wraith), but he could be further improved rather than, let's say, BHVR implenting their entire rough-draft brainstorm list of Legion changes.
---
jUsT dOn'T gEt HoOkEd, lol. I stopped playing survivor a while ago and mainly played killer this last period and I can tell you right now that you're delusional. Moris aren't particularly broken because killers tend not to immediately use them since it doesn't offer a lot of bps, but there's no actual counter, just like there is no counter to getting camped and tunneled, if a killer wishes to do stuff like that he will have possibly made a survivor mad etc etc. but he does not gain anything by it, if he camps he'll get genrushed, if he uses Mori he loses chance to double pip and bps, ...
---
Oh I thought she was looking at you, I was in bright sunlight and couldn’t see
---
ACCORDING TO YOU "SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN" HAPPENS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT SO JUST ROLL THE DICE AND HIDE!!
---
Indoor maps are good for nurse. It's no coincidence that the best map for nurse is an indoor map. Theoretically, a map that is confined where the killer (nurse) isn't restricted to the layout of the map while survivors are restricted to the layout of the map offers a clear advantage. You made very valid points.
---
They lowered EGC timer to 2 minutes to it's very unlikely they are reverted the other stuff on Pig.
---
&gt;unpopular opinion 
---
&gt;the general consensus of this subreddit aside from people who abused legion as this sub was flodded daily with ‘nerf legion’ and ‘delete legion’ or ‘legun bed gib 3 karma plz’ posts. 
---
Sure, OP
---
I agree to your post but that last part is utter non-sense, not everything's got a counter, that's just make-belief.
---
Absolutely! Its terrible how popularized being an asshole survivor is. It feels like every other game is filled with toxic tbagging swfs. It’s shown by big dbd youtubers to be the best shit ever but honestly its horrible to play against. I don’t get why people have to be an asshole in chat either. You can kill a while team or just a few or maybe they all get out but in their eyes you existed on the map so you camped and tunneled. 
---
But you gotta remember the more you play the better youll get. The better you get the more equipped youll be to deal with these assholes. Theres also the fact that this is a game that these people take way to seriously. Take a step back and give yourself time to clear you head before you play. Its a game that should be fun for YOU. I wish you the best in your games and Im sure youll be stomping squadettes in no time.
---
Feels australibad man
---
Moris are broken, pink addons generally are unfair, instaheal is OP, the multiple infinites still in the game and the ones that can happen randomly through unlucky prop placement are dumb.
---
The fact that people are stupid and sometimes complain about stupid thing doesn't negate the existence of several severe balance issues, regardless of whether I can "achive to counter it" (sic).
---
YOU RATION YOUR TRAPS!
---
THIS ALSO KILLS THE FUN MEME BUILD OF SLUGGING AND TRAPPING EVERYONE THEN OPENING THE GATES SINCE AS FAR AS I KNOW TRIGGERING THE EGC DOESN'T PROC GENS!
---
Both are good but self care takes longer to heal since it’s like 50%(?) the healing speed when not using a med kit
---
I thought they had to actually open a gate to get the 3 minutes started? Or have the killer close the hatch or open a gate?
---
I've been calling other survivors out on going after killers lately. Like I had a wraith game and he played fairly and we had three genned ourselves and he had a complete opportunity to make the game hell.
---
Earlier in the game he chased the same person for about 2.5 gens and at endgame they were like 'u really chased me that long'. So I was like don't be mean. Honestly, it's unnecessary and then the backpedal like "ohhh i wasnt being mean i was just saying." Well, no one asked. 
---
I almost never get salt from killers as a survivor because no matter if its a fair game or I'm face camped, I try to be nice and gracious in endgame chat.
---
LET **US** DO THAT IN THE PTB!
---
Because you touch yourself at night. /s
---
I'm half serious. If you're using it in lower ranks to bully  killers that aren't as good it's toxic. If you're doing it in the rank you belong in it's just playing the game
---
People like you are the issue though. You reward killers who camp by making their game easier and also potentially rob your team of pips and bloodpoints in the process. 
---
BHVR can't come out with dedicated servers soon enough so D/Cers get timed out.
---
I don't see a problem with slowing the timer if at least 1 survivor has a trap on their head by the amount that a downed or hooked survivor would be normally until the survivor is killed or gets the trap off. 
---
Keeps the pressure, but doesn't make it only 2 minutes.
---
Fine, but you understand that what you are arguing is exactly what all australasians are going to have to deal with now? Fuck you i've got mine right?
---
People who play killer suck anymore. Ive been camped by 2 wraiths and a myers..  I dont get it.. such a boring unfun way to play the game.
---
Not the case. I played legion without exploiting and was upset because as they said in the stream, they completely changed the legion play style and unfamiliarity causes anxiety with people.

---
Thief! Thief! How DARE you take someone else's icon packs!!!!
---
Go to the deadbydaylight forums and they have instructions as well as patch notes for the PTB, its PC only also. ( link to that: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/59071/2-7-0-mid-chapter-player-test-build )
---
Well I mean, the same people who could “read” were losing their minds over the Legion rework. Now that the PTB is alive, people now see that they’re actually more fun to play as and against.
---
Cat in the hat, actually.
---
After it's over they normally advertise on social media a survey but for more details on the PTB check their site:  https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/59071/2-7-0-mid-chapter-player-test-build
---
Me as survivor, you WILL DC. I'm a camo claudette and know every hiding spot.
---
Hour
---
Did you read my comment and title or are you trolling?
---
And yet they’re not nerfing op killers like nurse
---
So this is why everyone DCs on first down.
---
To avoid a Mori.
---
The EGC clock ticks down slower when someone's hooked or dying state so that would be incorrect.
---
I got 71 of them but I don' use them.
---
Honestly the only op thing about nurse is her blink add-ons. At a base level she's manageable. Id like her to be nerfed too but it's not a war, and dev time is finite
---
Yup. Classic revenge
---
I used to run it but at low ranks no one would save anyways, at high ranks everyone would hook dive, no matter if the killer was camping or not ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Technically couldn’t the legion use it to do exactly what he did prior to his nerf?
---
Slap a surv in Frenzy, then lose chase and it only takes 1 sec to reduce his terror radius to zero. AND since nurses calling now works on mend he can start running at the survivor if he sees them mending.
---
Imagine being so bad at nurse on console you are given 2 free DC’s at start of match because potato survivors but the last 2 do all the work and get out :,) 
---
Cause that just happened on ps4 lol 😂 
---
Honestly if all you can get is 1k with nurse don’t feel bad because 1k nurses look like gods compared to this potato nurse that this survivor and I went up against.
---
I've been soaking my tears with my kiwi, which all New Zealanders  have allocated to them by law. Poor thing is so waterlogged she can't even fly.
---
I too love Ruin and NOED at the same time
---
RIP all Aussies and Kiwis playing this game man. It was fun while it lasted :/
---
only if the same happens to survivors during the Match
---
Pink add ons are not the problem.
---
Prayer beads, tombstone piece, tuning guide, etc. Are not pink.
---
CAMPERS CAN CHOKE ON THE SCROTE
---
*"Please give me more attention!"*
---
Gross...
---
A lot of people get really scared of the anticheat, but EAC won't ban you for this or MLGA. EAC looks for programs that are injecting into DBD and directly altering game values, eg, movement speed, and then bans appropriately. All this pack does is replace the PNGs for the hud with other PNGs of the same name. EAC won't detect this, and seeing as it gives no actual gameplay advantage, BHVR doesn't have any reason against it.
---
That's a good start at least. I'd still like to see some sort of compensation buff for the other nerf. Doesn't have to be huge. Just a little something.
---
45% of the player base is &gt;20
---
Why am I not surprised lol
---
Still needs less restrictions, at the moment there's no point in using FF because it hinders you too much and is too slow for chases and removes your ability to track blood and scratch marks.
---
I'm playing as a basic M1 killer on the ptb and I won more quickly than when I try to use the power how its intended to be used.
---
There will probably be an oce server added when the servers come onto live, but for now we just gotta suffer in singapore.
---
They shouldnt be nerfing an already weak killer with the pig it serves no purpose.
---
Literally every killer can do that. What is your point?
---
You did not just go there
---
Yeah, thats the other problem with all this BS rules stuff, no one even agrees what they mean. Your definition is 100% something I've heard people call tunneling, too. Equally stupid. I've had matches where I had *very* good strategic reason to focus certain players (skill level differences, perks, etc). That's the game. I'll absolutely walk right past the super skilled pallet looper to get an easier target. There is no tactical reason to enter into a long chase when I could get an easy hook THEN go for the pro pallet looper once there is a bit of map pressure.
---
Traps in the egc would be guaranteed kills. Period.
---
It just can't happen, unless they pause the egc for the duration of the RBT.
---
"devs play the game more than you" I bet you 500$ thats not true
---
"Legion Buffs" Ye and after People found a viable build for the nerfed Legion they nerfed that build even more...plus, have you seen his awesome slow vault?
---
The power is very cool
---
just don't get infinited loooooool
---
When you're casually working on a gen then tier 1 myers pulls you off
---
Id be fine with this
---
You're the one normalizing it though.. punish them. If they play with a bad connection, punish them twice!
---
that sounds great let me go rambo a deer
---
Obviously not "the" problem, but if you consider iri heads fair, you're somethin special.
---
Thank you. This is a really good explanation. I appreciate it!
---
Kinda hostile but okay. I'm also advocating for using the traps early (most of the time we would save 1 or two traps for late game because if you RBT ever down, most of the time the masks are all off the survivors and you have nothing before the last gen is even done) but with the current RNG, most traps barely delay anything and they aren't any kind of threat. If they want to remove the end game pressure of having to get the trap off before leaving, they could make them harder to get off earlier in the game. I still dont think this suggestion will make her a top tier killer but no one is asking for that, most people that play pig (myself included) like to meme with her and just try to see heads pop as we hum the saw theme but I'd still like to see they take the fair approach instead of the easy approach. But that's my opinion of course and you are entitled to disagree. &lt;3
---
Oh, you're totally right. I forgot about that completely. Thanks!
---
Assuming they find away for killers and survs to dodge a lobby if the ping is atrocious w/out the penalty
---
I played Legion on the PTB, he's in a better state but his power suck, it's litterally like playing a wraith without using the bell, there's no point in using Feral Frenzy at the moment unless you enjoy gimping yourself.
---
Wasnt he playing vs purple ranks as well? He is supposed to be a red rank player.
---
Again. Vacuum. It's not about the pig being weak as a whole. It's about how the pig's endgame trap combined with the collapse would be almost unstoppable
---
then we have a deal!
---
i thought this was common  knowledge
---
The problem is that some of these things ARE broken, or simply the failures of the game. Moris are broken. Hell even Nurse herself as a killer is broken. People who complain are not just complainng to complain, they're complaining because they care about the betterment of the game.
---
But, that wasn't the nerf we were complaining about. That one made sense w/ consistency from the Legion changes w/ moonwalking.
---
I've had so many of my friends stop running selfcare. We rely on each other and we get an extra perk spot.  
---
As a killer that's runs nurses from time to time I love selfcare so many idiots selfcare constantly
---
Entity tendrils are moving way too fast in my opinion, looks rad tho
---
Basic ass Billy
---
I want someone to do this but with Freddy and Legion in the pic too lol.
---
If you’re gonna play by your opponents rules you may as well just go afk or stand under every pallet and let them stun you.
---
Who even settled on these arbitrary rules? If you face camp the other 3 survivors will just gen rush. If you don't want to possibly get face camped then don't get hooked, you whiny survivor.  "Gen rush," on its own is a stupid term that whiny killers use to get angry at survivors playing to win. Combining Haunted Ground with Hex Ruin or NOED is just good strategy, and yet whiny survivors will claim it's "toxic." Stacking Mettle, Decisive Strike, &amp; Dead Hard, and bringing a flashlight to play aggressively is also just smart strategizing, but killers will call that "toxic."
---
Just play to fucking win and work to outsmart your opponent.
---
The only thing I would say is justified in complaining would be people using voice comms in SWF. The game is balanced around not being able to verbally communicate and using Discord with friends breaks that balance. Either make voice comms for survivors baseline and balance around that, or give killers some way to disallow SWF being put in their lobby or give them some kind of bonus when playing against SWF to compensate the unfair advantage.
---
What does the patch have to do with this?
---
Unless you just so happen to get into this situation during the EGC, the patch won't fix this.
---
So I'd still try to get that killer banned by recording the footage and sending it to the devs.
---
They're not broken. Broken is ps4 rn trying to grab someone but it glitches and you just wake them. Nurse is a little op but not broken ans morys are super rare to fight againts
---
they added him to the game already he just uses distortion to make eveyone think his name is jeff
---
Bumped up a teir would be an understatement. NOED+Blood Warden + increased time to search boxes, plus less timer, plus a closed hatch equals game over for anyone who has a trap on during the EGC. Theres literally nothing they could do to counter it besides die or be hooked. 
---
Killer mains are just reacting harshly instead of actually testing her out. Shes still the same pig, and now basically has a built in tracker, since you can easily tell where trapped survivors are now once their trap deactivates in your TR and you arent chasing them. 
---
If she didnt get changed somehow she would be stupid OP in the endgame. Everyone would hate pig, shed be the new pre patch legion. So many cheeses would be opened for her. And as i can tell from everyone complaining and DCing against pre patch legion, she would have been nerfed either way. She still has pressure during game, and they made it harder to completely wipe the floor with everyone in the endgame.
---
I call that lag, I don't know of any hacks that can pull survivors towards you, the only hacks are always noed, speed hacks and wall hacks
---
yep he played against rank 10
---
Possible. Also possibly lag switching.
---
Just played a guy called "laggy bill" who instantly picked himself up off the ground and teleported around the map. So hacks are absolutely present right now.
---
The clock is slowed while they're being dragged into the sky.
---
It only goes back to the normal rate when they're fully dead.
---
NERF.
---
NOED.
---
True, but it is a component of her endgame counter play and I don’t think she’s in any position to give that up. Besides, I said this elsewhere but it is absurd that survivors be allowed to walk out of a trial wearing a death trap with no consequences. 
---
With the reduced endgame timer I would be willing to accept a compromise where trapped survivors count as downed. That would give them roughly four minutes to get out, plenty of time to check all four boxes.
---
\&gt;dodging 100 ping lobbies  
---
Don't ever let this guy discover 200+ ping lobbies. He might vomit blood.
---
She would be strong, but she still wouldn't threaten the current top tier killers. It would not be a bad thing to have some variation in who the top killers are. 
---
I feel like they should've at least seen how strong she was before nerfing her.
---
&gt;I don't nitpick at other peoples grammar since it rarely pertains to the discussion.
---
Alright, then you need proper grammar because you failed to convey yourself properly. Then you got downvotes and your fragile ego had you delete the comment.
---
Really? I fuckin love it if they don’t feel cheap like most movie ones. But when I get jumpscared in this game it normally makes my heart rush and then I mayyyyy make dumb decisions but it’s more fun once the blood starts flowin ya know?
---
after which he bings his bong
---
Fine, let’s not look at it in a vacuum.
---
The Pig, since she can’t force survivors to stay in with hats, will just facecamp towards the end of the game, worsening an already-boring mechanic. Instead of leaving to chase another survivor and gambling 2 vs. 0, she will now insist on the 1. Whereas she used to have some interesting gameplay, now inactive hats means she’s just like any other killer whose only option when the doors are open is to sit and stare.
---
Wrong. Considering you would get hooked every time ur downed, you could do it 2x max if you are always on full health at the start. Also if you get to use it twice the killer sucks at tunneling letting you heal, legion, micheal, billy, nurse, leatherface, plague, trapper all counter mettle of man
---
Originally this was supposed to only be a still poster, until a friend suggested to animate it.
---
Nerf her.
---
&gt; Wrong.
---
...No it's not. Each player can feasibly have it. That is up to 4. fuck off
---
If you know there at the box near you you can chase them off of it, further decreasing the time they have to get it off, which in turn keeps them from doing gens for even longer.
---
You must be joking
---
Why, is your reroll button not working
---
Her whole appearance is kinda masculine, really.
---
No OCE?? really?
---
Was a pig main, now I’ll become a nurse main
---
&gt; Especially when you consider the major problem with the traps in general is that they’re RNG and survivors quite often get them off after the first box
---
I'd say 25% of the time they get them off after the first box...
---
PTB Huntress seems to be able to hit multiple survivors with one hatchet and insta-down them if it's a headshot. I couldn't find anything about it in the patch notes, so I don't think it's supposed to be like this, though I could be wrong.
---
Makin' 'im an offa 'e can't refuse.
---
what doesnt have a counter?
---
What about Canada? :0
---
So if everybody does something it makes it okay..? If everybody was a rapist or a mass murderer, it would just be fine in your book? And I happen to know people with autism, and trust me when I say it hardly makes them an idiot. Your closed mindedness is far more debilitating than and person with autism.. Just saying. 👎
---
Just because somethings rare doesn't make it balanced. If I added a add on that had a 1 in 1000 chance of spawning on a bloodweb, that just made me have perma expose and automatically caps all bloodpoints, and I can mori everyone, is that fair? Moris are unfun, and poorly designed. they simply should work when someson on death hook, not on first hook.
---
Have not though about it that way. But still thats assuming that your u are not a chase right? Because if you are you would probably lose the other guy right ? Not trying to fight ,just wanna see the other prespective.
---
Wait is it just a hatch grab
---
I mean, that makes sense. Why would they change a feature just to please a small handful. If everyone is talking about it, surely it must be important.
---
Okay, you know what? 
---
I like your style.
---
This is too real and the sixth I can suprisingly relate to. 
---
Picking up the cup and hearing the skillcheck noise to then hit a ruin skillcheck
---
Endgame Capital Gains Tax is now the name.
---
It has been written into the universe by Trapper.
---
High-ping killers, Mori, tunneling, camping, ... there's a ton of stuff
---
I was looking through my trophy photos and this one must have saved right as the game was ending. This photo looks similar to the blight aesthetic, but it doesn't have to use the same color pallet! I like the look of the hole in the arm, and it makes for good inspiration, no?
---
I think the pig was possibly better with that change, but since that's kind of an exploit I have a feeling the devs would have just changed it to be like Legion where you can't see if the trap is active or not.
---
Anyway I'm glad it was reverted so I can play my dumb gimmicky skill check build again.
---
thank you, at least I know the message is clear
---
Plus it is an animation sync issue. It is almost like people don't listen or 'go hard of hearing' selectively
---

---
That should be the creator of the portrait pack
---
Fair point, it would be to OP if pig could just crouch and your timer would go down anyway.
---
Well of course, he’s not my main maaaaann
---
Pig could never see the Timer...
---
Yup. I said it many times. Dedicated servers were never the magic solution. They only help some people (Americans mostly, no surprise they selfishly wanted this), and even more have to deal with the issue now.
---
I think if you die to the trap youre pretty new to the game then.
---
Forreal.
---
Yeah, when I first saw the patch notes I thought a similar thing, i’m sure it was actually a nerf on a level i can not comprehend yet though.
---
Does it involve Dark Devotion? Mine with UP kind of does
---
There needs to be a way for Surviviors to tell if there's an inactive member in the locker
---
No thanks.
---
I like teabagging the bodies with other survivors, or in front of the killer.
---
Yeah, so no risks here.  Some guys don't do the digging required for this kinda stuff.  It's important.
---
Avengers spoiler
---
You know its a good post when even the shadow is edited. Above the common shitposts this is!
---
Me too, remember F13. They lauched it just before the game died.
---
A huntress complaining about Haddonfield, wtf?
---
This is a cool idea, I like it
---
Oh thank god, the nerf with the endgame was already bad enough, but the terror radius change? That was just overkill
---
Dodge a high ping lobby. Moris,, eh I guess no counter. Tunneling perks like DS. Camping Has BT.
---
This was a selective Nerf and Buff, if you think about it.  Built in Whispers and you can disable this by crouching.  Also can’t you exploit it by crouching in a chase to pretty much destroy the RBT Timer?  I’m not great at Pig so I dunno, just my thoughts.
---
Lemme think. :D
---
I'm not going to credit them for fixing half of their own fuckup. Don't fuckup in the first place - that's praise worthy.
---
Fix the other half that you took away from the Pig. And rather than fucking with killer's powers, change your freakin end game to work around killers' powers.
---
ping doesn't always show right in lobbies, DS was nerfed to death and can also be avoided by slugging for a moment, BT doesn't work for shit if the camper is bubba or billy. About that camping thing, most of the time if the killer wants you dead, you will die without a say in it unless it's a threeman save and the killer isn't bubba or billy by chance.
---
This is the best thing I have seen on this subreddit I have never seen anyone this salty.
---
Sharkles009 (dont laugh)
---
Who cares?
---
Hey, at least he let you hook him first for the extra points.
---
Play better next time
---
You mean Joey?
---
You're looking at an extra 20 seconds to just wait until you're hooked and then give up. The only reason to DC over dying on hook in that situation is to be a dick.
---
Why The Legion gets a 4 seconds fatigue time, but The Nurse is fine just with 2 seconds of fatigue ? 
---
They nerfed even the cooldown add-ons, and I don't understand why, they really didn't look too OP to begin it. His power doesn't help him to down survivors, so he gets looped and his power doesn't grant him map pressure, so he gets gen rushed. He is practically a Pig without crouch, with Deep Wound replacing Reverse Bear Traps.
---
Did you make them?
---
Oh yeah it's not like you can't throw a fucking hatchet over the fences.
---
Literally git gud
---
PlAy BeTtEr NeXt TiMe
---
This isn't the "hung" the Entity was looking for
---
Does michael myers even have any special powers? Just a sturdy lad with a knife right?
---
Everyone can rage about it but on PS4, most people use it as a form of "no one is coming to get me, come save me" and I know its true because my teammates will be across the map not getting me, ill wave, and immediately someone starts heading for me. Usually if someones getting camped we just go n find out, we see the player attempt escapes or run kindred.
---
Exactly because after that no one will be paying attention to him lol!
---
yeah I've had that happen a couple times before. very annoying
---
blessed comment
---
Its called pc dead by daylight.
---
Yeah, pretty much, especially so considering the Entity specifically chose Michael from Halloween 1 as opposed to say, 4, where he’s shot like a million times and hit with a grenade.
---
Says stop whining when entire post is whining.
---
Well best luck my dude
---
Why the down votes?
---
I’m not saying she is unplayable just that she isn’t as good as she once was. Just chill it’s just a meme and you are thinking to deeply about it
---
Well if he doesn’t announce Ghost Face as the new killer and it’s something totally off topic he will probably be the fastest unfollowed guy on twitter and on top of that the comments and threats he will receive to boot! But from what I’ve heard and seen it’s shaping up to be a phone calling killer with a buck knife!
---
You say that but there was that one pig player who decided to experiment. It seemed heavily skewed to first try removal. Obviously it could just be bad RNG but that was 5 traps for... I think they sid 100 games and the first try was at 50%
---
Yes it's annoying indeed. Imagine not being able to help your teammates. I tried to do something helpful and started searching for all totems to cleanse to avoid NOED as the killer hooked only one survivor the whole game.
---
They're getting it done Quick and Quiet. Someone saw a Window of Opportunity and took the Mettle of Man Head On.
---
First of all, I will pay you to make another set of those for me. Second of all, I never realized how much Window's of Opportunity looks like MOONMOON\_OW's twitch emote 'moon2SMUG'
---
Corrupt purge and NOED don’t work together...
---
Meh. Don't really want people taking advantage of shitty chase mechanic like they did with Legion but whatever as long as they bring this back if it comes to that
---
EVIL WITHIN 100,000,000
---
i'd say it depends on what you have in your head, as well. some people can do more painterly styles as pictured in this post and others (myself included) can only do flat colour/shading, which is fine for small illustrative work like avatars and emotes but less impactful, imo, for larger pieces like this one. check out the Dead By Daylight tags on places like Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr, and i think you'll find an artist you like well enough through those. :)
---
"Hey DBD, fans.  Give me a bunch of follows and I might let you in on a little secret! #Ghostface"
---
Lol.
---
If you face a lot of camping LF / Billys, run Kindred. You will die anyway, but the killer will lose
---
It's healing except the healer is Asleep, so the animation broke.
---
1 Thanatophobia is garbage.
---
2 Survivors can loop a killer while injured with no problems if they don't have a power which help them in chase ( the case with The Legion ), why you think Dead Hard and Adrenaline are meta ?
---
If they are struggling on the hook I let them kill themselves, because clearly they don't have the braincells to stay on the hook the max time.
---
Each Legion member has a specific bird that perches on the locker they are in.
---
AHHH, I need this bugs in my life xd
---
*laughs in australian*
---
I have a feeling the game will get even more unplayable for us, I only ever saw ping of 500+ to begin with.
---
There'll likely be an OCE server added down the road but until then it's Singapore and Japan GL to us all. Godspeed.
---
Flipping our shit IS feedback.
---
So far, so good. We're doing it, Reddit!
---
it depends on the style you're looking for - pieces like this one (full body, full colour, digitally painted) can be $100+ on the low end, whereas something simpler like flat colour &amp; simple shading could be ~$25+ on the low end. just depends on the artist. as someone who both takes commissions and has commissioned in the past, though - if you see someone charging something stupid-low like $10-$20 for a full-body full-colour piece, tip them at least 50% of their price. they're radically undercharging themselves.
---
Must be a pc bug. I’ve never seen that on console before.
---
i play on ps4 and it's happened there.
---
Legion and Pig. For Legion, you can only use the feral frenzy when the meter bar is completely full. Also, some of the Legion's add-ons have been nerfed due to people doing the "infinite mending" glitch. For the pig, her reverse-bear traps changed to fit the end-game collaspe. 
---
 I don't remember everything so I might get some of this wrong. If a survivor has a reverse-bear when the endgame collaspe, the trap will not activate. The trap will only be active for the endgame collaspe if it was already active. However, survivors with unactivated reverse-bear traps can just go through the exit gates and escape. 
---
I know there is more for Legion and Pig, but I can't remember off the top of my head.
---
I say the same but may I ask...
---
Why is he holding Michael’s knife?
---
Not anymore. (For me at least). There's also another spot on the opposite side hidden in grass. Not nearly as good as this one. As killer you should check there for immersed Claudettes
---
Your opinion is noted. Matchmaking being as long as it is, I’ll save the 20 seconds for that instead of a poorly connected match that in no way lets me have fun.
---
Im not whinning? Im telling people to stop whinning over these things. There part od the game and them whinning about ot won't do shit
---
Now here's where I'm at, I replied to someone else about that, if the killer accepts the factors that come with it and facecamps you it's his choice and you can't do shit, it's not counterable. Someone here said "just don't get hooked" on which on you replied "true facts", that's simply delusional. If a killer really wants you dead, you will die, what are you going to do about his tunneling/camping/mori? Loop him for 5 gens, somehow not get hit twice the entire game?
---
Yeah, but one extra hit is a big deal to all of the M1 killers.
---
Not sure why survivors do this, I'm a survivor main and me and my friends all love when survivors who tea bag get fucked especially if the killer played fair... makes no sense for me to stay behind in matches etc to just be toxic as all it does is make you earn less points in the time you are doing that you could already be in another game :p
---
Played well, everything has a counter, some killers might not be able to counter some stuff but yes, some killers can't counter some perks,
---
Yeah, trust me: that is a *fat* 25% chance. I see a lot of people get free on their first box. I usually chalk this up to my bad luck but I do see a lot of people saying that RNG tends to screw the Pig over.
---
While it sucks for people living in less populated areas, dedicated servers are the best thing to happen to any game.
---
Why yes, I only play Legion with Frank's Mixtape and won't be playing him anymore after the nerf. How could you tell?
---
How about, if a survivor gets close enough to the locker, they can hear faint Legion breathing?
---
Wrangling snakes isn't as fun, trust me.
---
did you not see this subreddit after the rework was announced and the intended changes were released? people went fucking *apeshit*, not just toxic Legion mains. it was frankly ridiculous.
---
Moris are more something to annoy then do good
---
there's uncounterable stuff on both sides, that's why that last line of your post is utter rubbish
---
Now we need a Kate body pillow.
---
I don't think it is op, I do think it penalized some killers who are not the greatest more then others. That's my personal problem with it.
---
Also shouldn't wake someone up against freddy.
---
Its not, coming from a wraith/myers main, its not OP. Even on wraith, it’s not OP.
---
im in love with you, op
---
The DBD official store sells them
---
I appreciate the meme but know you brought this wrath upon yourself. I have to go all out. Just this once.
---
I'd like to note that their chase time is still reduced by half if they start a chase injured. At 115 movement, it's not like how you can loop a Huntress. Legion basically will now reduce every chase by half. No healthy state loops to close down. Only the injured one.
---
Dead Hard if not in the perfect position buys two seconds. Adrenaline only matters if the gates are active so that's not much of a point. It's legit just insurance if they're the ones being chased when it happens.
---
you should probably double check with the portrait artist before redistributing their work without attribution :/

Honestly, I only picked this game back up because of Ash. I got dbd back when it first came out, had no one to play with and gave up on it. Now I can't stop playing, I'm bad, but I can't stop playing.
---
This game is basically designed to make people angry.  
---
No wonder the community is toxic as hell.
---
Us wraiths have to love each other, no one else will

Low rank survivor is BRUTAL! Not only do you have to learn, but your teammates tend to be a detriment to you. I personally main killer and started trying survivor a few weeks ago. Killer experience taught me a few things about surviving strategies. Maybe you try killer. However, learning killer is much harder.
---
Waving tells killer GTFO, they know you here and not hunting them.
---
This. The traps need to do something late game. Especially if you fall behind early and they complete the generators, you need the traps to keep survivors in the trial. This is a good compromise I feel.
---
i mean tbf to the devs i felt love from the buff a few months back
---
The only map I'm less fond of is Ormond, and that's because I apparently go blind there.
---
Interesting. I'll have to find that video. Thanks for the heads up
---
You gotta admit that it's a real buzzkill when you hit an injured survivor and he just glows white, waddles to the exit, and teabags you before leaving
---
So the power would hardly ever get triggered?
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Yeah, I started Survivor beacause I feel like I'd be a ***TERRIBLE*** Killer  🤣🤣🤣
---
Yea thats just a cunt survivor
---
Looks like they are doing RE6’s logo
---
Ah, okay- but hitting an injured survivor with it definitely gets the cursed/exposed icon to come up then
---
Yes I'm on PS4 too
---
Show this to the Devs. What they did to the legion was just cruel.
---
Control switching immediately... what happens if I'm carrying a survivor and this happens?
---
Cmon dude it's not that bad, Tokyo is only like 7000 km away, you're *basically* complaining about nothing
---
Well legion now is a 115% killer, without anything useful at all
---
His ability probably puts him into more disadvantages than advantages now, resulting in a killer, that is obsolete, because there are 115% killers with actually usable abilities
---
I'm also pretty sure the Myers house is an infinite if the survivor has balanced landing
---
I agree that there should be a bigger penalty for disconnecting, like a long wait time to find the next game! Similar things are implemented in other games like Overwatch.
---
First time I will experience BBQ + Blood Hunt, thanks RNG!
---
Gonna be swimming in BP soon enough.
---
Luckily killers often don’t DC against me, but I don’t think the Survivor Compensation is more than a few hundred bloodpoints if any.
---
I am OK with the killer rituals requiring a certain killer. Makes sense to have to play with a different power occasionally. 
---
What I am not ok with is survivor rituals requiring certain survivors. Ex. "Open an exit gate with Meg." When my build is on Kate. Everyone knows that you put your build on one (maybe 2) survivors then just get the teachables on everyone else. Would be nice to be able to complete any ritual with any survivor.
---
Yea bud, as mentioned earlier, you are not entitled to a gg from anyone and they have every right to tell you to not message him.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Aww, thank you!
---
damn ma is it that serious?
