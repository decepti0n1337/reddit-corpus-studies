Just saying, they did say they‚Äôre gonna throw us of from their ideas and cover them up as much as possible. They tried it with Ash but they accidentally leaked perks in KYF. Other than that we had no info. So I think this IT and Walking dead is too good to be true.

---
---
Negan will be the next killer
---
Lmao damn you're getting really defensive over this aren't you? You also didn't answer my question, I'm still curious as to what you think those gals are.
---
The left 4 dead shirt
---
He can try to shock my gay away üòâ
---
Well , 2 things . 
---

---
1)Lether face , hilibilly .... Legion , ghostface
---
2) IT is not a clown , its an entity . Its a shapeshifter . It would perfectly be called The deadlights.

I just had a rank 16 killer game against 4 rank 7‚Äôs, who all claimed to be solo. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with the matchmaking right now. They could‚Äôve been lying I guess.
---
Did you see what Mathieu cote said to tony hawk. ‚ÄúHow can a respected game dev get you on their game‚Äù that‚Äôs a rough quote but it‚Äôs along those linesüòÇüòÇüòÇ. People are getting trolled. Plus he could be mocking the game devs for ‚ÄúThe last year‚Äù as they made pennywise without licensing for ‚Äúfun‚Äù and posted the concept. No response and never happened tho lmao
---
Ayanami Rei?
---
I guess we have different definitions of toxic. I would call out unfun but not really toxic because the intent isn't really purely malicious. I would definitely say talking shit post game and teabagging at the exit gate is toxic tho
---
Not if you only mori on death hook which is the only appropriate way to use it unless survs are being ultra toxic.
---
Defensive over a meme, üòÇüòÇjust funny how critical people are these days. I already said in this a thread on this post that I thought it was an ostrich. Dinosaurs were furry so are ostriches. Change my mind
---
For some reason, when I‚Äôm playing as killer it starts teleporting me all over the map and then the game disconnects. And it looks like I‚Äôm the one who DCed but.. I didn‚Äôt. Not to mention, the survivors get their BPS and I get nada. So I‚Äôm the one punished for the game kicking me out. Please tell me I‚Äôm not the only one with this problem.
---
Oh yes. The "freddy is bad" mentality that has plagued the community since his release until he was changed. 
---
I've went against it time and time again, and im sticking by him. He wasn't bad at all. Stronger than legion, and imo stronger than leatherface, *possibly wraith* (id say that depends on the addons).
---
You wait 7 seconds to hit someone. Seems terrible, right? Well, that's because you're looking at it like that. You wait 7 seconds to get their aura revealed to you from across the map, always knowing their whereabouts till they wake up. It was a longer term investment. His ability had it's drawbacks, but it also came with many positives. He had built in game slowing time (since it was based on rng, it could either be as weak as thanatophobia or stronger than ruin even), ambush capabilities, an ability that let you locate survivors easily, an ability that gave you information so you could plan your next step, a dark world that made it hard for survivors to see while giving you their bright blue outline on the hunt, an ability that let him get close to survivors so he could start the chase in a relatively close distance consistently while they were awake. Also as a small side bonus: people underestimated you, so they're even more astonished that you beat them as "the worst killer". 
---
The examples that you see where survivors would bm the hell out of him because he couldn't protect hooks properly and he couldn't stop people from healing a downed survivor till 7 seconds were mostly problems of a noob freddy. A good freddy knew how to prepare for those situations, the only part of his kit that was outright terrible and annoying was the fact that adrenaline would wake survivors up, but that happens in a small percentage of a trial. 
---
I kinda miss him, but if nurse changes a lot (which I doubt she will, probably some number tweeks to base kit) then nurse mains will know how it feels to get their mains thrown away, the freddys who played him because they liked his ability the way it was had to change who they played or play the new freddy which is nothing like the one they spent time into learning. People will probably make more of a fuss because nurse is popular and freddy wasn't, but it'll essentially be the same thing.
---
As for nurse, nurse's base is fundamentally broken and there's no doubt about it. She teleports through all of the survivor's defenses. I know killers are supposed to have powers that make survivors play differently, but none of their powers should completely void core mechanics like pallets and vaults, that's kinda what makes the chase (along side some mind games). Even spirit, the one who is weaker than her by quite a bit but is still strong enough to take care of swf according to most people obeys basic things like map layout, nurse doesn't. The only thing that makes people go "she's good where she is" is the fact that she requires a bit more skill than other killers and her skill gap is surprisingly big among the community (she really isnt THAT hard imo). I guarantee if every nurse player was good, she would be one of the most hated killers among survivors. 
---
Also doctors ability kinda has the issue of destroying a game mechanic like hers, but it's definitely less severe and its the opposite of what she does (he has to deal with pallets and vaults but breaks most stealth mechnics as a whole).
---
They have announced Hallowed Blight event. Skins and posters were already added in latest patch
---
I think you were on my team like every other one of my games for the past some years now
---
Meanwhile though there's a rank 20 killer who is super excited he no longer has to deal with a r1 with 5k hours intentionally queueing with their depipped friend to bully the shit outta them, so, :)
---
Yea I see your point you're right
---
Holy shit i didnt know that thank you
---
I hate that window. Same thing happened to me many times
---
Even if, they wouldn't just call the video something like "DBD - Pennywise reveal trailer" or something.
---
At first I wasn't sure her blight outfit was different enough to like, but damn this thing is nasty and I love it. What isn't covered in glowing boils is black and necrotic, it's so grody.
---
Throw monitor and abuse and youll have 0 tr. Monitor and the dead rabit addon is around 6ish tr in tier 2
---
Thanks :3 I'll think about Jake
---
At least it's lore accurate
---
I‚Äôll just leave em sometimes. They must learn the hard way that our time is precious.
---
My complaint about ds is how bold people play they have ds, I have survivors work on gens right in front of my face to body blocking while injured.
---
I don‚Äôt know either, but the worst add on is face mask
---
She's pretty mid-tier, probably give her a 6.5/10. As a 110% movespeed Killer, she's susceptible to looping more easily but not more recklessly. If you're going to drop a pallet, you need to either guarantee a stun with it or make sure she doesn't predict you dropping it or vaulting a window, because then she can charge preemptively.
---
okay
---
Dude, I pointed out as a joke that they weren't raptors, then you ask me what they were so I tried to be nice and answer for you. Then you throw a tantrum because, I dunno, you don't like tyrannosaurs apparently? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yup. It is really unfortunate because I can't really introduce new people to the game now. "Sorry, we can't play together because you'll be matched up with killers at my rank. You don't have enough experience to survive for very long, but you can see what it's like to die often."
---
Talking to a friend and telling them "Hey, you should play this with me. First you'll have to play by yourself for 50 or so hours to get a basic understanding, then after that we can play together". Why would they want to play the game at all.
---
Assumptions make an ass out of you. 
---
I don't see how it would suck for the killer when we arsn't that great and usually lose at least two people most games. The new method sucks for most of us because we play with one red rank and the rest of us float between 10-20.
---
Ways to counter the huntress: dont run in a straight line, use the crouch button, utilise cover such as trees and dont run in a straight line.
---
huntress is high tier the problem is shes fucked hard by most maps
---
My main problem with Small Game is that you can't hear the difference between dream pallets/traps and totems. So often I keep looking around trying to find the totem because my perk keep going off and realising it's a dream pallet. This is why I tend to use it less then usual. But it's great together with Inner Strength and it's easier to deal with Ruin and NOED, two of the most feared killer perks.
---
Jealous! They need to sell that in their merch store.

If a boy did this to me I‚Äôd really be hooked on him! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
---
Self-caring takes 32 seconds. If youre good enough, you can last longer than 32 seconds in a chase without getting hit. If you dont heal and can get chased longer than 32 seconds, then you would have made a better profit by getting hit and getting chased 32 seconds longer.
---
If you dont heal and get downed before 32 seconds, you just went down and helped the killer snowball. Should have healed to actually have a better chance of escaping.
---
Its a lose-lose. Of course, its not always applicable. Like when your gens almost finished or you just need to squeeze the last/second to last gen. But usually healing will pay off. Especially if youre a good looper and know how to use windows
---
A good friend of mine is still able to utilize it well. He mostly plays a help-survivors-and-run style of survivor though. I think personally that they just reduced it to not only nerf it, but encourage teamplay within the game. Just my thoughts though.
---
Huntress USE to be Top Tier. Now she's lucky to crack the top 5/6. Girl is in desperate need of a buff.
---
Compared to Hillbilly, Spirit, Hag, etc. Huntress is a joy to play against.
---
‚ÄúZat vas not medicine!‚Äù
---
Not responding to comments with a long ass paragraph takes skill
---
It's a ruse. They know now that we're paying attention to their Twitter follows.
---
And that too.
---
Beard Brothers
---
Thanks for sharing this, love the music ;)
---
I clenched hard just watching this.
---
Randcid Abattoir, Wretched Shop, and Ironworks of Misery all have windows that can cause a 110% killer to end up breaking chase during it, giving legitimate infinite potential at times.
---
I feel like everyone miss understood the sarcasm here, what a shame
---
I love jakes that 99 hooks. But you know what I love more than jakes who 99 hooks? Survivors that do gens.
---
This. It‚Äôs not just about the survivors having fun. Swf should already be having fun because you‚Äôre playing with your friends (and on coms, which is, you know, a giant-ass advantage in this game). There are also new players who want to play killer and probably stopped playing because of how the system was before. And I say this as someone who plays mostly survivor. The ideal balance is both sides having fun, so this was certainly a welcomed and needed nerf imho.
---
i have to wait for 20 min. to find a game as a killer.
---
Well yes but also no.
---
To be fair the perk itself should automatically uninstall the game for the whole swf causing them to lose all their progress.
---
No yeah Ik that. I want a full fledged dinosaur survival game however
---
The killer could easily just leave you their or fake a lunge.
---
The mode that coined the term doesn't exist anymore, so that's probably why. It's now a part of the "Play As Survivor" interface.
---
Lmao, you have a problem with it being skill based and not how well you can run a loop? The counter play is outsmarting her, play well and its not a problem. The collision thing really only comes into play if you stand and wait at a pallet, which you should almost never do. On terms of difficulty id say she's definitely a medium, not as mechanically difficult as nurse but that's not what she's built for. Anyone can play spirit but it takes a good killer to do well with her, like how anyone can use a hammer but it takes a Carpenter to build a house with it.
---
If only there was a casual mode that took ranking completely out of the equation...
---
*Happy inbred noises*
---
He doesn‚Äôt have more then 1 M subs.
---
Probably due to the fact that his content is not released often
---
if you wanna show your distaste downvote here
---
or upvote here if otherwise
---
Freddy these days lol
---
Yeah I should probably elaborate. I meant as soon as it went off it canceled all survivor actions for the 7 seconds that they were deafened. The survivors holding their ears is a really good idea.
---
Yeah this is literally leather face 2.0
---
I wonder which map getting reworked...Haddonfield getting the Freddy maps treatment perhaps? Thatd be exciting
---
Did this recently. They paced around the killer's shack for a moment and decided to go for the pallet. It's great to visually see the gears turn. Haha
---
Is all the time
---
what if they crawl to an exit gate?
---
How is this downvoted but Bran's comment isn't. Sorry you dealt with simpletons.

Don't need to sometimes u need to end a chase to check gens

I use snap too much relax

Poor Meggy
---
Blood test: you leave smaller blood trails and other survivors blood trails are brightened
---
It made me want to die
---
No, surge "kicks" the gens. Doesn't cause failed skillchecks.
---
He can be fun but most of the time it's a basement camping teabagging ass wipe playing as him.
---
Don't get me wrong the teabagging can be hilarious but it's irritating when he facecamps you.
---
Also his stalk needs to become more consistent I.E. I shouldn't be able to cancel it by complete accident but I should be able to do it when I'm literally right in front/behind him.
---
Yes. But you cant assume this was taken from Until Dawn.
---
Wait what
---
Just farm them I guess, or sandbag the shit out of someone against a Devour Hope Killer
---
Tali is best girl you uncultured swine!
---
Moris let you feel like a killing machine which is the fantasy of the game. Sometimes it's fun to be powerful. Everyone should just run what they want.
---
You'll get the hang of it. The perks you have are pretty decent, she just takes some getting used to, but she's worth it in the end. Good luck!
---
Yet i rate him at the top of the most unfun to play against. Nobody wants to deal with the screaming of doctor.
---
You could tell your friend to not do that.
---
Dehydration is no joke.
---
I played against a Freddy today.
---
I spawned next to Ruin.
---
Huntress is very skill based, she‚Äôs not low tier she‚Äôs top. Up there with billy
---
damn, dude your a badass. I bet you get all the lesbian pussy
---
So just let the SWFs destroy relentlessly! Fantastic idea!
---
I'd rather have him as survivor
---
That's not what I said dumbass. Theres ways they could nerf SWF without having to buff the hell out of killers and make it impossible for less hardcore players to enjoy the game.
---
Wouldn't surprise me.  Everyone knows they follow people they're interested in adding now, so BHVR's gotta start throwing out some red herrings.
---
This is the killer equivalent of Head On we never knew we needed
---
Why you cryin hun
---
No. Save up bloodpoints first. I recommend 300k minimum
---
new player here, what do totems do?
---
Yes there is always a chance you could get banned but if you aren‚Äôt changing survivor or killer appearances you should be good
---
If he had just stood on the hatch he would've been fine, right?
---
Macready was the alien!!! he should be a killer
---
I had a game yesterday where the killer basically let us win he hooked each of us once and then if we got healed chased us to Injur and basically let us go. While of us were at the exit waiting for our 4th the killer (Who was ghost face) just there tea bagging with us for a giggle. 
---
After our 4th showed up, I let him sacrifice me so he got at least one by standing by the closest hook and crouching till he got the signal. I regret nothing and it was a grand old time
---

Plasticface
---
I got her Adept in the very first game I played with her, and since then, I have not gotten a Merciless with the best perks, nevermind with her 3 perks. Only one I‚Äôm missing now is Huntress, which I haven‚Äôt tried since levelling her up to 10. Good luck
---
She almost killed him.
---
When other people have cleansed
---
They're currently on on PC servers for testing
---
This is the greatest idea I‚Äôve heard lol
---
Ok, but like, Jurassic Park Chapter when?
---
New Survivor: Alan Grant/Owen Grady
---
New Killer: Indoraptor, The Hybrid
---
Indoraptor was incredibly intelligent in the movie. And now that we have Demogorgon who knows. I do, because this is never happening.
---
Thank you!
---
They‚Äôre turned on for pc as of yesterday.
---
Holy butts there was an in-game announcement that they are live and everything
---
Lol you *are* new, but you're going to fit right in no doubt. If you want you can tune in to the next dev stream and complain about huntress with 3 or 4 other survivors and have her nerfed into the ground.
---
However, if you want to get better rather than removing huntress from the game completely, a few tips: 
---
1: she makes a grunt sound when she raises a hatchet, most huntresses will go for the throw immediately and depending on where you are way you are headed you can usually tell, eg- if you just pallets slammed her and are running for a window or another pallet and you hear her raise a hatchet you know that she is throwing through the pallet, so dodge lefy or right of the path and she misses.
---
2: she is extremely slow on foot and whenever she raises a hatchet she cancels Bloodlust and any build up it has which means she's very very very easy to loop.
---
3: if she hits you with a hat at Point Blank you need to go to a pallet immediately and drop it because her cool down after a hatchet throw is very small and they can usually just M1 you immediately after if they are on your back.
---
4: bait her hatchet throws when you have distance on her by sprinting to a window and waiting to hear the Hatchet.
---
5: better huntresses will use hatchets to not just wound survivors but to Zone them, which means if you are running forward and there is a cornfield to your right and a pallet to your left and I charge and hold hatchet you will most likely Dodge right because you know I am aiming at the pallet, now I can walk towards you with a held hatchet and force you to either run somewhere else all run into where I know I can hit it you, if you run right you run into the cornfield with no cover which is what I want. So again you need to bait the Hatchet so you can run through the loop.
---
Always remember the 5 D's of huntress: Dodge - Duck, Dip, Dive and Dodge.
---
I was playing with a guy in the discord server we were in and we had this exact conversation, lol
---
I had a similar one last night I was the killer and got the first 3 within 5 minutes so when I found the hatch I stood by looking to see the last survivor to show him where it was. Never came into view so I eventually got impatient and closed it. I found him tying to sneak to the exit later so I downed him and carried him to the exit and let him struggle till he got free and I stook there while he opened it. He let me down him again for some extra points then I dropped him at barrier that blocks the killer and let him crawl out
---
30 seconds? What an idiot, I wait like a most 5 seconds before doing something because past that its obvious that you faked.
---
Perhaps
---
Really? Not the most popular character from the show.... okay buddy.
---
But Id rather have Jesus anyway, so I agree with you.
---
19
---
I mean... Sure.  
---
And I almost had Pizza hut today.   
---
Still had a survivor pudding instead though
---
Still havent made 1 month lul
---
I love doing that, instant map pressure, and its hilarious when they miss a skill check because of it.
---
Suspect:
---
Your intuition is sharp, allowing you to remain calm when confronting a threat. 
---
When within 24 meters of the killer, you will receive a notification and the perk will activate. For 4/5/6 seconds, leave no scratch marks, and make no sounds.
---
This has a cooldown of 60/50/40 seconds.
---
Unpopular opinion, super glad this perk was nerfed to the ground, it was a big fuck you to M1 killers
---
This is coming from someone who plays 50/50 btw, not killer only
---
Thanks
---
What if I wanted white milk
---
Its a solid 98%, thats why i have a fucking trauma with that comp
---
Sorry that aint yea sis thats leather face
---
I can agree that's possible for the second saw, but the first one had the survivor between me and the palette. This is 50ms fwiw.
---
Bruh read the first paragraph
---
Wheres the joke?
---
you get tombstoned on the spot
---
A Walker or Negan as killer would be amazing. Can't see either happening but it would be insane!
---
Rank 1(it happened a year ago or just around clowns release). Went against alot of noobs during my first month making it really easy to reach it(with Trapper btw) but then after rank reset I just got destroyed.
---
ngl that clown kinda freaky tho
---
Keys are a fun and balanced game mechanic.
---
/s is very useful
---
Get adept Pig before she's nerfed again lol
---
I want The Thing as a new chapter...
---
They are about the same imo
---
And 8% regression still applies
---
ok ok I take that back
---
And if you don't, I don't care
---
Is that a Metal gear solid gameplay ?
---
but they still play dead by daylight
---
Make yourself supper annoying to focus down.  Best things are balanced landing and general looping/map awareness are key.  It sucks to get tunneled but it‚Äôs their decision and you can only adapt and make yourself a bit annoying.  Also run DS if you have it
---
Imagine being able to kill the killer, just taking a rifle as your item and then blowing their brains out
---
Hmmm :/
---
New to the game: What is N.O.E.D and M.o.M?
---
"ShE dEpIpS tOo So ItS fAiR"
---
Coral then lol
---
Shit u rite.
---
When do they come out?
---
JuSt rUn dS
---
That and seeing which area is get the most hype
---
Actually in this circumstance DS wouldn't have helped you.
---
I would rather use wraith with no windstorm than play nurse 1 more time. I always get the game and I always change floors.
---
But it's not what binds them.
---
Yeah, not to mention that lockers are a direct counter to bbq and chili as well as the doctor's shock therapy.  
---
There are quite a few legitimate reasons to use lockers, honestly.
---
Thanks I'll have to try pointing to get out. Hope it gets fixed soon
---
I've ever live streaming my very 1st killer match....
---
 The people watching me all agreed that I sounded like an actual serial killer with how much I was enjoying hunting kids down and stabbing them.
---
I was running it and I got unhooked and hit immediately. But of course the skill check went at 1 frame per second so i missed it.
---
Relatable
---
That explains a game I had earlier, now I know. Thanks
---
Ok fair enough, thank you üëçüèª so what about overcharge ?
---
looping for 20 min
---
Use Decisive Strike. It won't necessarily prevent you from getting tunneled, but a lot of the time you can usually lose them with it or they'll go for someone else after you use it.
---
Slow it down. Are you running around everywhere? Trying to navigate the map and get to the gens fast? If so, slow it down a bit, put urban evasion on and resort to making stealth your priority, lessens the chances of you getting caught to begin with.
---
Since you're SWF, get on voice comms and communicate. It'll help you track down roughly where they are, making them easier to avoid.
---
u may have max. chase points but all other categories are low with points, it is not fair indeed but hey u shouldn't bother with it too much.
---
Already went through this with the other guy.
---
Game is still unbalance, am queing up with rank rank 4 palyers while my rank is 8. Please balance the game.
---
I hope roadmaps are not the future of gaming I think the Devs of DBD are using them properly and have hit about all their stretch goals up to this point but a lot of games like Fallout 76 are using them as an excuse to publish a non-finished game with the promise of more content soon (tm)
---
Wraith mains when they get spotted by the swf group with all purple flash lights and red add ons
---
Also I cant use doc power at the middle of the game.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say three years closing the hatch is new
---
Ha! Right on the money!
---
Bruh nobody wants to wait another 20 minutes
---
This doesn't work against a good Spirit.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I *am* a good Spirit, I'm not really, but I play her and have been against good Spirits, and I *do* run Spine Chill.
---
It never flickers, as the Spirit phase walks around the tileset they keep their camera locked on where I am (or would be if I was waiting at the pallet) the entire time, making it seem like they're legitimately staring at you.
---
Monitor and abuse reduces TR by 8m so you have 0 in tier 1
---
And with dead rabbit you can have 0 in tier 2 i think
---
I looked at him too long. He's not stalking me anymore.
---
Pretty sure if he smashed spacebar he would have been fine. I'm assuming as long as killer still hosts hatch should close before the survivor jump, right? 0 ping?
---
Doubt it very strongly
---
Yes with overcharge it would work im inclined to believe
---
Aw, wish it was a TWD game survivor :(
---
No One Escapes Death: if a dull totem is on the map when the exit gates are powered one becomes hexed. Survivors are exposed (1 hit downed) unless it is cleansed.
---
Mettle of Man: [Ash perk] after 3 protection hits, the next hit that would down you doesn't.
---
oh god oh fuck
---
*laughs in deliverance and ds*
---
Nah I got the notification too, not everyone‚Äôs first thought is ‚Äúshit I should screen shot this for Reddit karma‚Äù :p
---
Daryl would be my first pick, 2nd would be Rick Grimes, 3rd would be Glenn, 4th would be Maggie, 5th would be Negan
---
I am currently using both balanced landing and ds, but I rarely get to use BL and as for DS it feels as if I only get about 20 seconds rest from being chased. I'll look through my perks and see if there is something I can change. Thanks for the help
---
New meme template?
---
Ok but if they have 2 crows over their head then it‚Äôs deserves
---
I really like keepaway characters in fighting games. Dhalsim in Street fighter 4, Peacock in skull girls, etc.
---
My post match messages online were always full of this prayer.
---
Though some people really are that unlucky.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I play with a guy who gets tunneled a good 85% of the times he's unhooked even when the killer has another injured target near, was chasing someone off and broke off (or slugged them) in order to tunnel off the hook, circumstances that I get away safely most of the time and think are perfectly safe still has the killer tunnel them even as I bodyblock.
---
I wouldn't have believed if I didn't see it, but some people really are that unlucky.
---
it‚Äôs so queues are not 30 minutes long, and actually a good change.  Maybe you got unlucky but as a rank 8 killer you aren‚Äôt too far off rank 4....
---
"Good" is a slight understatement...
---
Well BL basically removes any fall recovery time even if you are exhausted which is great because most maps have small drops at least
---
That‚Äôs easy, just run urban evasion and crouch towards literally everything (except the hatch ofc), even if it means not making it to the hook in time and letting your teammates die
---
Ah okay. Thank you very much.
---
I've only had the game about 2 weeks now and I don't have Ash and haven't seen the other one yet
---
r/Unexpectedtf2
---
Yeah. I lost a few levels on Hag around a year ago and BHVR gave me ~450K to compensate. They'll get you.
---
Haha perfect Claudette strat
---
Yeah isn‚Äôt his hole shtick just to break the mind of his victims
---
good to know thank you!!
---
Lmao
---
Might be a glitch seen a few other post today about people having killers unlocked that they didn‚Äôt purchase unless I didn‚Äôt get the memo...
---
Change it so camping/tunneling is either very punishing or impossible then balance accordingly if this makes survivors too strong (like making games longer)
---
Yeah it was a disgusting joke and was easily the single most over powered and broken perk of all the perks ever released in the game, killer and survivor. It was unanimous that it took no skill to use, no downplay and would carry a team to the exit gates single handedly.
---
ok
---
Learn the ins and outs of the game. If youre good as you say you can punish killer for tunneling and with swf its so damn benefecial. Stay at strong loops and waste his time then ask for body block coordinated rescue by the end of the game. Being tunneled gives you the spotlight, play your best.
---
Well other than the fact that the definition of sarcasm is being an asshole, I'm going to assume you knew that what you said, not as a joke, is a really rude thing that a lot of people say to be a jerk. So you have to come up with something different to actually be joking on the internet.
---
Ok
---
Baby dweet: "does this look dangerous to you?"
---
Okay, but so can rank 5s, rank 6s, rank 7s, rank 8s, etc. Stop whining and just get better.
---
Sounds like a pc problem....u xant blame the game for that because skill checks are client side :/ sorry
---
Yes it is.
---
Reddit moment.
---
Same
---
I mean, I main killer and still find it cringey.
---
&gt;Well if someone facecamps me once the exit gates are open it doesnt feel very good, especially if I played well that game, why would I do it to other people? But sure I have a mental illness because i dont scrape the barrel for a kill at the end of the game
---
I don't like to be flashlight stunned as a killer, especially when I carry a survivor. 
---
When I play survivor I'll try to get those stuns in despite me not liking being on the receiving end of them.
---
It‚Äôs very much a game issue, happens to me and all of my friends whenever we use ds
---
you know i had to sloog it to em
---
What are the other survivors gonna do? Obviously he‚Äôs gonna be mobility focused...
---
consider peeing before a match. Matches don't last THAT long that u suddenly have to pee. Outside of sudden diarrhea this is not an excuse.
---
To unrealist by time u lean around a corner u already kicked out of lean cause someone stared at u
---
Yes it is its much more diverse compared to dbd as survivors can hide more during chase and not just loop, its a better game its just young and less accessible because of how fast paced it is.
---
I don‚Äôt find it cringe I find it pathetic and hypercritical when I see a killer do it but yet bitch and cry about being teabagged
---
Until the mm update you currently have to pick quality vs quantity. I didn‚Äôt make the rules, but you make the choice to be in the lobbies you solo into. No one puts a gun to your head and says you have to stay nor does anyone tell you dodge. But if you decided to stay in a mixed lobby, expect some of those ranks to be those ranks.

Friend. Watch some skilled Huntresses like Umbra and Ralph still get shit on because of where she is at currently and get back to me.
---
You are correct she is skilled based, but skilled based doesn't mean that she's top tier. There's skill to playing Trapper correctly for example.  Knowing where to place traps is key and skill is required.
---
Doesn't make him top tier in the least.
---
You're welcome. I didn't understand what NOED was until I started playing killer and got the perk in the web. Wasn't very common in my early days but as you rank up you'll definitely see it a bunch.
---
it's to basically read and study how the brain works, Dr. Carter went a little overboard with it though.
---
I would take it a step further.
---
Throwing the survivor you're carrying is a guaranteed hit if within 32 meters through obstacles.
---
*But.*
---
The survivor you throw is fully healed, gets a sprint burst effect, cannot be hit for 10 seconds (but also cannot use an item for those 10 seconds to avoid instant-heals on the one you downed with them) and then gets a protective effect for 15 seconds afterward if you do hit them (temporarily 3 hits needed to down).
---
:P
---
The video is cool and funny, keep the great work dude!
---
Imagine spamming spacebar being difficult lol
---
Quieres?
---
In my experience Ruin is better than Lullaby for this build.
---
Don‚Äôt forget that when you can‚Äôt unhook your teammates because of asshole killers, thinking it‚Äôs okay to facecamp all game asshole to asshole, that you and your teammates lose emblem points and will only safety pip if lucky, since all you can do is bang the gens and try to get out... 
---
But BhVR states that camping is perfectly fine, I don‚Äôt get where they see that logic, since you derank and it ruins the game for everyone else and I think they are smoking some cheap crack to!
---
Yeah, but it‚Äôs almost impossible to use now
---
Fuck me thats grotesque
---
i just tried it, they owned me very hard at rank 10. 
---
they got three gens in the first 3 mins, lullaby got destroyed after that
---
Kay. But it can also go
---
"My teammates are morons and run around doing nothing, leaving me to unhook them, do the gens, find the totems and we all lose"
---
Good.
---
Otz*
---
Same, it's gone for the 8001th one time
---
Meh
---
Have your buddies run Borrowed Time.
---
I was the Pig in this match.  It was wild, I was trying to do a backpack build.  The reason I went outside was because I was hoping some of Kate's hitbox would be targetable on one side of the wall or the other.  Kinda sad she was stuck there until the headpop, but I guess it's better than being stuck there until the egc.
---
Isnt a "controversial truth".. you just have no idea what are you talking about
---
Gen rush does exist that you like it or not. It's a survivor issue? No, it's a dev issue that can't think about something to make the game last longer (except holding one button for longer)
---
The games lasts for 5 or 6 min, that's it. Gens alone are done in 80s, a chase with anyone but a chosen few killers lasts for 30s per hit. Pick up animation, hooking and just the hit delay takes in total 8~ seconds, without counting the travel time to the hook, flashlight saves, pallets saves.
---
That's just for the first hook. Then in the next hooks count again, make the gens slightly easier to defend since 3 are out, but put also DS in the mix.
---
Gen rush is a thing because the gens can be done so fast. I'm not even counting people with prove thyself or toolboxes, just the standard 80s gens.
---
Now You find yourself in high ranks and everybody use toolboxes or insta heals to make chases longer, so on and so forth. That's why just few killers are viable there, a wraith for example, can't keep up with all that sht. Billy might, nurse can and Spirit too if used properly.
---
Before calling something "truth" I would do more research if I were you. just because people feel personally attacked by reading "genrush" doesn't mean it's survivors fault. It's something that devs should care about and fix it, even with a additional objective that doesn't take much to complete. 30s for a secondary objective would be nice, something you have to find preferably since doing gens is already boring in itself
---
Hmm well I guess this is what happens when I‚Äôm late to the party and barely joined reddit
---
pretty much, yeah
---
A blast when he's around spooking me
---
Terrible when he's just being used to camp
---
Thank you for telling me
---
I miss White Noise 2.
---
I think they should make the gens take longer to do, but I they also gotta keep it reasonable. They could literally just add some seconds to them
---
Go Susie.
---
If I bring an ebony in, unless I'm absolutely struggling, I won't use it until people are on their last hooks (as in "third" hook)
---
Depends on your rank. You need 16 sections at red ranks.
---
Sections needed = 16 - (rank/5) rounded up
---
None = 0 sections
---
Bronze = 1 section
---
Silver = 2 sections
---
Gold = 3 sections
---
Iri = 4 sections
---
##Gatekeeper:
---
&lt;250pts = None
---
250 pts = Bronze
---
350 pts = Silver
---
650 pts = Gold
---
\&gt;=900 pts = Iri
---
5 gens. (7 on map but on 5 count for the math)
---
Each gen gives 5*T points every minute where T is the number of minutes that have passed. This caps at 9 with 1,125 possible points.
---
You get N*100+100 for every gen left at the end of the match that the survivors needed to power, but didnt. 5 max, so 600 points at max.
---
Based on the devs 2 dead/2 alive end goal, there should be 0 gens remaining. So you need to have 3 gens left at the 9 min mark for Iri. 
---
##Devout
---
Simple. /s
---
2pts per death/sacrifice
---
0pts per bleed out
---
1 pt for 9 hooks
---
1 pt for hooking everyone once
---
Get 9 hooks and 4 kills for Iri. Doesnt matter how they die as long as they dont bleed out. DCs work too.
---
This is actually impossible to Iri with the devs vision of 2/2
---
##Malicious
---
&lt;11 pts = None
---
11 pts = Bronze
---
22 pts = Silver
---
30 pts = Gold
---
\&gt;36 pts = Iri
---
1 pt per hit
---
2 pt per hook
---
-1 pt per heal
---
-1 pt per struggle escape
---
Again, 2 dead/ 2 alive w/9 hooks means you need 18 hits and 0 heals. Summary: Dont choose plague.
---
##Chaser
---
This'll just happen if you dont lose many chases.
---
Havent quite figured out the math.
---
Imagine being so bias that you didn't realize the op was talking about the low ranks and not the gens
---
How far have your head up in your ass? God damn it
---
Has anyone noticed if the legion goes to pick you up and your running DS that there is a glitch where you the needle jumps and you miss you DS, this has happened a few times now since the 3.2.0 patch on PS4...
---
Daddy Daryl is the best character in the show.
---
I‚Äôm thinking 2/4/6%?
---
If we are just being honest, if the whole team can loop, you aren't going to have time to do get downs and check gens.
---
Thanks for taking care of it.
---
Been playing obsessively in my first month, and with all the time I logged during the bloodhunt, I hit rank 3.
---
Rule 63 skins would sell big.
---
I hit rank 1 launch month on xbox
---
Im impressed by the nancy she can bleed alot through her chin
---
Imagine saying that after you haven't got the point of the post in the first comment.. wew, you're so bias
---
Both sides in DBD have access to ridiculously broken stuff and the game is really only fun for everyone when both sides agree not to use it.
---
In the bog standard game of DBD, survivors have about six health states before they're dead. Two health states per hook, three hooks before they're dead, 2x3 = 6. Four surivors, 2x6 = 24. So DBD is more or less balanced around the idea that killers will have to burn through 24 survivor health states.
---
Now, what happens when the killer is an iridescent head huntress with an ebony mori? Huntress's hatchets are balanced around taking two hits to down. Iridescent head makes them down in one hit. Ebony mori lets you skip an entire hook per survivor. So now we're down to 1 health state per hook, two "hooks" (one real hook, then the mori) before they're dead. 1x2 = 2. Four survivors, 4x2 = 8. I just cut the survivor's total health pool to **33%** of what it's supposed to be. Imagine hopping onto an online fighting game and cutting your opponent's lifebar by 2/3rds before the match even starts because fuck you that's why.
---
Meanwhile, survivors have syringes (+1-2 health states per survivor that brings them, so potentially brings the 24 up to 32) and Haddonfield offerings (Haddonfield with balanced landing has actual infinites and a bunch of loops that are not technically infinites, but long enough that you'll lose the game anyway if you try to chase).
---
As a killer, I can only have a fun and fair game if the survivors let me have one.
---
As a survivor, I can only have a fun and fair game if the killer lets me have one.
---
Since the devs adamantly refuse to address the most broken stuff in their game, and too many people are assholes who enjoy using broken stuff to troll the other side, the community is constantly salty at eachother because each side is constantly ruining games for the other side by using broken shit for LULZ.
---
I usually do too.
---
As someone who has watched the will to live fade from their eyes using this build, I prefer the way Otz plays doc. Don't go into treatment until you put someone on the hook. Ideally, also when haunted grounds is in effect, get another hook or two. Proceed from there.
---
I feel this on a another level
---
I just picked one up for a ghostface cosplay myself
---
*When the killer has bloodlust 3 and downs you 2 mins after having it, starts shaking his head
---
Okay.....
---
It‚Äôs funny how he says that but not about like mindbreaker. Which makes survivors exhausted, but only if the gen is below 50%, and then once they get off it only lasts 3 seconds.
---
Oh like a ptb for the servers?
---
How is that different from base game
---
Comic Negan killer would be dope.
---
Its not you amigo, it's just that this image itself is posted so constantly with he spirit that it auto removes at this point since it's that common of a repost from people.
---
Wow survivors seriously need a nerf
---
South Africa is a good example. Not sure if the discrimination of white Africans has gotten worse, but it was a recent issue
---
But recently since I'm rank 12 because of rank reset and my teammates don't do gens
---
What happened with pig?
---
Wtf üòÇ
---
they are way higher than u think I believe wiki says 30% chance with plunderers and without it's like 5 or 10%
---
‚ÄúNot touching your keyboard takes skill‚Äù how is it not obvious that it‚Äôs sarcasm? And how was I being rude to who I replied if I literally agree with them.
---
The rank bracket you play around influences this, *usually* the closer you are towards red ranks, killers bother less with securing hooks. 
---
Of course, it also depends on what killers/perks they're rocking, but the trend is still noticeable.
---
I really don‚Äôt understand the whole gen rush thing. It‚Äôs the main objective for survivors. I understand there‚Äôs others like unhooking, healing, totems, etc. but gens are how survivors ...survive.
---
LOL
---
Does anyone know if hitting an exposed survivor procs IF?
---
Try not to care about dying and such. If your not having fun just try a bunch of random perk builds you come up with.
---
If you don't want to get tunneled give lightweight, Quick n quiet, urban evasion and a perk of your choice a try.
---
I Hope it happens
---
You could buy one of her clothed cosmetics. Give her a robe or a uniform to wear. Rin deserves to have her dignity.
---
You are welcome for the mental Image. ;)
---
So focus on gens and let someone else do the looping.
---
Record the game play
---
Well of course I wouldn‚Äôt change their appearances. But this pack seems really fucking good and I want to use it. Sadly I don‚Äôt know if I will be banned or not for using it
---
Yep. That one too. It's always partnered with a blood lust.
---
Your ace is identical to mine
---
I'm used to the opposite. When I see people bringing keys most of the time, mid to late game they'll get less involved with doing gens and focus more on not being seen or looking for the hatch and staying near it.
---
That‚Äôs really interesting
---
Yeah after long ass chases they just start respecting pallets and bloodlusting the shit outta you
---
Hell yes! Ha ha
---
Anything that puts them in the dying state should
---
Yeah, this is an idea that appeals to you?
---
Spaghetti code
---
If only Maniac Cop was a killer
---
I do it when I tell what the survivor is trying to do, not when I‚Äôm in a chase for ten years
---

---
Thats clearly what happened, but closing the hatch as trapper means a win, he was there, just spam spacebar and close it, no point in anything else regardless of where meg was.
---
Yeah no Daryl, please. Either Rick or Negan would be appropriate.
---
Sarcasm.
---
When did I face camp?
---
Wow this harmless criticism is all you have to do to get steamrolled with downvotes
---
Rank is not the end all be all. A rank 8 with 1000 hrs with be better than a rank 4 with 60hrs.
---
Usually if you face camp straight up without moving or leaving the hooked survivor you‚Äôll get an entity displeased, no hate though hope you still got your points
---
Would it being drawn in crayon help?
---
That‚Äôs commitment right there cheers!
---
The obsession perk (cant remember the name), ruin, bbq, and bitter murmur.
---
&gt; hey can literally gen rush and end game within 2 min.
---
I've seen that at rank 10...
---
it might be an Issue, cause you cant Dodge Bubba as easily as Billy
---
What about Thana?
---
Even if it's active at full potency for the entire trial from start to finish (not gonna happen), that increases the time to finish the gens from 156 seconds... to 181.
---
The best case scenario for Thana is about the same as a single proc of Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
It's OK on Plague, Nurse, and Legion I guess, but all of them would do better with different perks.
---
Meanwhile, I would‚Äôve been the one posting the ‚Äúalmost got away‚Äù version where I step on the trap.
---
They'll change the base too
---
"Slight changes" they said. Welp, they said the same for pigs traps after the egc so..
---
still looks locked in this image?
---
i'm not certain, but I think that's sarcasm coming from booflea.
---
"slightly higher" isn't worth it to me personally
---
I‚Äôd say the first suggestion and last two suggestions would be the most viable ways to make her more playable. I personally love Plague. She‚Äôs got the makes to being a challenging killer. 
---
I feel like if you added all of the suggestions then she‚Äôd definitely be OP. 
---
And as for the generator slow idea, I‚Äôd say not so much on that one. I‚Äôm a survivor main, and purely from that standpoint, I‚Äôd say that even if my timer was slowed, you wouldn‚Äôt catch me cleansing. A bit of a slowdown isn‚Äôt worth taking a long range hit. It‚Äôs a nice idea, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd work the way you‚Äôd think it would.
---
what happens when you switch off of him?
---
Yeah but I didnt face camp at all
---
The game after this picture we had a killer DC.
---
And somehow I lost 2 rank points for that.
---
the grunts of pain is too much too its like having a free rank 1 iron will and a bit more and there is the fact that everything in this perk incresae by rank there should be only 1  thing from the perk that incresaes and the scratch marks decrease  doesent that mean a Free rank 3 lightweight and the increse in heal speed and repair is honeslty weird dosent that mean that if u have botanty knowldge u will heal at the speed of a medkit with selfcare? and with a medkit u will be super crazy speed and with addon it will looklike like a instaheal not to mention if u have an addon that incresae charges u will probaly have then what like 3 insta heals? honestly its not even close to be a balanced perk mate like it
---
I personally don‚Äôt consider hatch escape as a win. Whenever I play as survivor, I feel wrong taking the hatch. I only do it to end the game but it feels more like a tie to me
---
Agree &amp; stickers!!!
---
Survivors OP smh
---
I just broke 100 hours and am only rank 11. Geeze.
---
Or you know, you are a killer that can only do so much and thus can't maintain pressure (in pther worlds, anyone but spirit, nurse, billy and maybe demo and freddy)
---
lol imagine saying git gud in 2019, already did that 3 years ago
---
Personally not a fan (yet) haven‚Äôt had a chance to play him much his shred is his best ability and portals are kept on back burner for me personally plus addon wise it‚Äôs meh. survivors are the best part id say get him it might take time to learn but who knows maybe I‚Äôm stunted or something
---
Reee I can't apply map pressure so I have to complain about survivors doing the only objective.  Toxic gen rushers.  Run ruin or something really isn't that bad.
---
I disagree. You can't kick people in Ranked. Also people in Ranked actually care if they win. Casual is nothing, but sweaty run outs and spawn peeking these days.
---
I fell your pain sir...
---
Some ppl can't run out of shit to complain about
---
Not sure what I'm looking at.
---
That happens to me BECAUSE someone asks me to do something. I‚Äôd rather you guys not get fucked over by a 3v1 so I‚Äôll just leave in consideration
---
Imagine hating someone for using a specific perk.

[Paulie Esther](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T66T1en7RYU) tried everything he could think of to replicate people getting a notification, but not getting an e-mail or youtube notification that could be documented and nothing worked, even if he deleted or privated the video 3 seconds after uploading it people still got emails.
---
He never said it was impossible, but even on his "small" 32k subscriber channel a ton more people took notice of his quickly privated and deleted videos than compared to the "DBD pennywise leak".
---
You're telling me the DBD youtube channel with over 450k subs and not a single person screenshotted this leak?
---
"I learnt a new word so I'm gonna use it every time someone disagree with me if they use any word to attack my thin skin!"

Before using Latin, try to learn what it actually means. It's not attacking you but your behavior. Ignorant
---
He‚Äôs still one of the strongest killers in the game. One shot, insane mobility / map pressure. He‚Äôs the 3rd best killer imo
---
Had no problems with it today
---
Bruce Campbell would definitely be all for it. He truly loves his role as Ash.
---
Killer mains when they camp and get a 4k:
---
yOu ShOuLd HaVe DoNe GeNs LmAoOoOoO
---
Elaborate maybe?
---
Personally I know it‚Äôs scandalous to cleanse I do it anyway because I suck at looping(I know filthy killer main) and because when it‚Äôs active you can just jump in locker or hide for 30 seconds or be cocky and try and loop
---
I would definitely main him. The norwegian camp would be a really cool map aswell. Would be kind of weird though to see david run around shirtless there lol.
---
Lol wdym noed needs a BUFF and ruin is all rng
---
Yeah, I was gonna say, this looks like a rip to your gpu
---
rip brother we barely knew her
---
I would be so triggered lmao
---
Have you ever tried running discordance? That would help disrupt the teaming-up on gens. 
---
I've always thought that the two person bonus to repairing generators was too generous. I'd be totally okay if they scaled it back to a 60 second completion time.
---
Yes no guts no glory blood points can be gained fast(unless you got BPS and escape cakes then use em first)
---
Quentin‚Äôs teachable perk, Pharmacy. Not sure how they should rework it but give Plunderer‚Äôs the speed increase to searching chests
---
There‚Äôs a few others but I can‚Äôt think of atm
---
No ed is a perk that noob or bad killers NEED.... but the higher skill you get the more able you are to win before then, making it a wasted perk slot.
---
And I did say only nerfing these perks if they decide to make killers almost across the board stronger... cause rn there are 4 maybe 5 killers that are viable and have a actual way to win against optimal teams of survivors.
---
2 of these are huntress, hag who are really map reliant.
---
Referring to getting shafted by P2P
---
I always had this perk idea where if someone peforms a flashlight/pallet save then they befome exposed for some time. I would call the perk "Get back here! (You piece of shit)"
---
Holy fuck yeah I'd love him as a survivor
---
Some dude refused to heal me and then messaged me that I should be using self care because he‚Äôs not my dad.

Seriously tho, the classes maybe even a couple in learning disabilities, I think they‚Äôd be good for you.

The last I heard they were testing on the PTB with the Stranger Things DLC, and promptly pulled them to work on fixing them more.

I‚Äôve only been on vacation for four damn days, and I‚Äôm about 90% sure they didn‚Äôt have them then.
---
Trying to play dead by daylight, not genrush simulator.
---
Dark Suspicion- Years in isolation have honed your instincts. Whenever a teammate within 16/24/48 meters performs a potato play, instantly heal a health state and gain a 25% bonus to bloodpoint gains, up to 4 stacks.
---
Yea that's usually what happens when you ignore a guy on hook just so you can get your escape points
---
Open up steam and go to dead by daylight page in store, it'll have the DLCs listed.
---
If you have the game open when you purchase them you might have to restart the game to access your new content.
---
What a bot
---
My only complaint with Monto, is that I find his outro song kinda lame.
---
It's gotten old too.
---
So it will show like a ‚Äústart chapter‚Äù or something like that? I already purchased the spirit‚Äôs chapter
---
Not dissin my boy goth jesus but R.J has the best beard and hair ever
---
That'd be sick
---
You don‚Äôt start a chapter. A chapter is just a character, a survivor, and a map. Everyone has access to the map though. You just bought characters to play so select Spirit like any other killer.
---
Wow. Took me twice that time to get to rank 4. U have some natural talent, my good sir.
---
Buying the chapter just unlocks the content, you should be able to access the characters as you normally would.
---
There won't be anything special you have to do.
---
Oh.... but it said it would come with her graduation outfit too but I don‚Äôt see it anywhere in customization
---
Lol how did anyone take this seriously?
---
why is this downvoted? it's true. no one gives a shit if they spoil patches, and I agree. if you don't want to be surprised don't go on the god damn reddit.
---
Just wish it rolled off the tongue better.

Damn. Even with you explaining that you were, in fact, joking and in agreement with the original comment, people are still downvoting you.

True

I‚Äôve played against groups that pop gens quickly through ruin. It‚Äôs pretty rare though. And I‚Äôm sure that it would have been even faster without ruin.

Here's my idea.. Have him be Charles Lee Ray.. when he wants to use his abilities, he uses his amulet to turn into Chucky. He could have speed (since he's so short, he'd need the extra help) and he'd need some aura stuff to help him find anything.. But he'd be super sneaky! Give him a butcher knife and he's good to go. Once he downs someone, by stabbing them in the shins, he can then turn back into Charles Lee Ray to hooks them.
---
it is a mistake though, you should never trade. Your actively removing 33% of the manpower on the team by going in for the save, and probably getting the other person downed. Instead, rush the gens and have 4 done by the time the person dies barring ruin.
---
R.J. MacReady - the Arctic Pilot
---
Isolated: As long as there are no survivors within 16 meters of you, you get a 10% increase in repair &amp; healing speed. The radius increases by 4/3/2 meters and speed by 2/3/4% per completed generator.
---
"Ya see, when a man bleeds, it's just tissue, but blood from one of you Things won't obey when it's attacked. It'll try and survive."
---
The Test: Every 60/45/30 seconds, the killer's aura is revealed to you for 6/8/10 seconds.
---
"There's a storm hitting us in six hours, and we're gonna find out who's who."
---
Fuck You Too: When you are injured by the killer, your stuns and blinds become 20/35/50% more effective for one second then 15/25/35% more effective for 14 seconds.
---
"YEAH, FUCK YOU TOO!"
---
I‚Äôd recommend 900k minimum but that‚Äôs just my opinion
---
whatchu mean? this is how it is normally
---
Stop right there, criminal scum!
---
Killer:The Herobrine.
---
Weapon:Cursed one's pickaxe
---
The Herobrine is an creature of great power, that even the entity fears.
---
Power: Miner's Torment:you are obsessed with one survivor.  When activated all survivors are unable to do generators for 60 seconds, pressing mouse 2 on a survivor will create a phantom The Herobrine and it will start chasing the chosen survivor, The phantom WILL disappear after: 25 seconds or touching the survivor, the phantom does not deal damage to survivors. However pressing mouse 2 on the obsession, will create a phantom that deals damage the obssesion.
---
(Maybe an add-on to make the phantom do damage others survivors...)
---
Teachables:
---
Watcher From the Fog.
---
survivors within 7/15/25 meters away from you will scream in terror and suffer the hindered status effect.
---
For 3 seconds.
---
Panic Hysteria.
---
Entering  a Chase with 2 survivors will case both of them suffer from Exposed status effect for 5/10/15 seconds.
---
Ghost of the machine.
---
Pressing the active ability button will cause all generators to be blocked for 10/15/20 seconds. Ghost of the machine has a cooldown of 130/100/60 seconds.
---
Survivor: Steve Blockee
---
Steve Blockee lived In an strange world full of unusual creatures, doomed to live alone has given Steve great potentials, but one day after seeing an strange creature lurking in the fog, he has gone mining in a cave when he got out of the cave he saw an different world, after hearing someone screaming for help he rushed to help.
---
Sole Worker. Years working alone has granted Steve great powers.
---
Performing any action alone will give an 5/10/15% speed,
---
It also gives 100% bloodpoints for actions completed alone.
---
Natural Architect.
---
You have 2/3/4 tokens, use a token to rebuild a broken pallet or lift an downed pallet.
---
Night Fright.
---
Being hit by the killer grants an extra 1/2/3 seconds of speed boost.
---
As a killer main, I have to say, I‚Äôm terrified
---
i wish people would shut the fuck up and stop whining about " spoilers ". God.
---
To be fair you misread the description, and Shattered Bloodlines does give you great content.

It's better than being Ash ketchum and living in pallet town. That sounds like a real nightmare.
---
I run Decisive and Borrowed Time, I'd rather get saves and trade. If the game really rewarded rushing gens on campers then survivors would actually pip when it happened.

You lost me at the end there

don't ask him to risk this lol. this is an opportunity to get his thingies for free.

They're good suggestions.
---
The problem is it's subjective. What one person may find as a good suggestion another may find horrible. The point is that the mods don't have the authority to say what is or isn't a good suggestion. Nor do they have the authority to change it if they thought it was bad.
---
Power is different from authority. And their misusing their power.
---
That happens to me a lot
---
It sucks my 700 survivor main hours would agree.  But when I can‚Äôt get an achievement just because of a stupid fucking counter like jumping into a locker it‚Äôs fucking dogshit.  If you do this fuck you honestly  the number of times you go against tombstone is so incredibly low anyways.  It‚Äôs super balanced anyways.  Takes SO long to get tombstone.

Then don't bring the perk. That's the thing, you can't bring every perk. Pick the ones you like.

they‚Äôre messing with us
---
He doesn‚Äôt have and won‚Äôt have Undetectable in EW1. He still has a small Terror Radous and Undetectable is a Status Effect whereas EW1 is just base Myers.
---
Teaming on gens is usually a mistake.
---
Not only is it just more efficient to split up, if the killer disrupts one person on a gen it's much less impactful than if they found multiple.
---
Discordance is great up until rank 1, when people tend to just solo gens.
---
There is one.
---
Imagine also having Spine Chill and the killer looking at you
---
"You would receive an ultra rare, if you're a survivor, or an ultra rare" what
---
Creative! I like it!
---
Those achievements can suck my entire ass. I want rituals like some of the killer ones.
---
Trapper, Myers, Legion and ghostface all come to mind
---
*Gets Vietnam flashback remembering Re:Zero in 8 Minutes and Subaru's suffering*
---
No I don't get that fucking feeling of deja vu.
---
I mean that's if video game logic applies, I was assuming this was like lore-based where all the Legion are ganging up on a Demogorgon
---
If it's game-based then it's safe to assume that a tie would end up happening because in-game DG has severely reduced power to make him fair haha.

are you over 18? if yes, I don't know why you ever care.

if no, I wouldn't have cared either.

Thank you :)

I find it hillarious, especially on Myers or Demogorgon. Tea bagging tho? Thats cringy.

Why were you in the closet when you could've just stayed next to them?

Fuck Nea
---
Lets give survs one too then, "Upon completing a generator, teleport to another generator. Has cooldown of 100/80/60." /s
---
I dont get it either. Can anyone explain?
---
Agreed. The poster is the only thing good about it
---
It's like eating diabetic friendly pudding...
---
Yeah legion farms pips it's crazy
---
O damn didnt notice, thank u
---
It might just be overheating, or has too much dust in it.  
---
  
---
Buy one of those compressed air cans and clean your rig out, including your whole video card.  
---
It might not work, but you will want to clean it anyways before you install a new card, and if it does work, you don't need to change your card for a little bit longer.
---
Oooo. Maybe when it hooks someone, survivors don't get a notification of the hook, and the killer becomes a copy of the hooked survivor
---
I stopped running We'll Make It because of it. It takes me 8 seconds to heal you. I brought a medkit so it will take like 5. No heartbeat, You clearly can see the trapper chasing someone on the other side of the map. I have Spine Chill just in case they have anything that would let them sneak up to us. 
---
STOP RUNNING AWAY FROM ME!
---
Sometimes keys let 1-2 survivors escape when they don‚Äôt deserve it just like mori‚Äôs let killers get 1-2 kills they don‚Äôt deserve.
---
This man gets it, upvote from me good sir.
---
I prefer to remember as a remake if only because as a prequel it kind of retcons stuff and kind of screws up the original movie.
---
lol who is crying am just saying it is unbalanced after new update. Before this patch it was ok.
---
Well those ideas are completely trash and the plague has a censor burner not a lantern
---
I get why they did that tho. Sprint Burst was meta at the time and the only way of telling someone "I don't want heals" was to waste it
---
Not a bad idea actually. Go for it and post it.
---
Doing totems, you?
---
Not necessarily. The "Survived" bonus is beefy enough that survs can easily overtake your score if you had a bad enough game.
---
Due to the pools of **devotion** being able to be turned into pools of **Corruption**, this basically turns her puke attack into a deadly range attack which can **injury you** so if your already in that state you'll be downed if the killer player does hit you.
---
You can wait till she uses up the corrupted bile on one of your teammates or take a risk at repairing generators.
---
Fingers crossed she vomits serum
---
There will always be a clash, unless he uses some special control with a 5th trigger??? I‚Äôve played on PS4, no matter what something will clash. Wanna disarm that trap? Drop the pallet. Wanna vault the window? Open the chest. Wanna unhook someone while rubbing self care? Jk self care in place instead.
---
Thank for your input buddy
---
Would I get r/woooosh‚Äôd if I in answered that
---
You overestimate the people who actively camp in dead by daylight
---
you should send this to the developers and ask them if they would put it as chase music for ghostface, this is terrfying
---
Ok I see it now.
---
It was even more untrue during double bloodpoint events
---
Just don't be a typical Self Care user.
---
As long as you don't run into the killer to take a hit 15 times in a game just because "I can self-care it off in the corner of the map", you're good.
---
Just never go down :)
---
As someone who plays the game routinely, I don‚Äôt understand it either.
---
it's been abused for years on reddit, it's free karma
---
Not at all, addons will still be consumed as usual, despite the fact that killer addons need some way of staying but that's another argument entirely.
---
BP is the only point that you could say is an assumption, and I'd say it's a fair one to make.
---
You don't get BP from Kill Your Friends, so an unranked mode would more than likely be a middle ground on this.
---
so why didnt you just buy spirit for 5$ instead of the full price lmao.
---
Take off Distressing since he has an add on that increases his terror radius in treatment mode and use Pop. That‚Äôs what I always use for this anti gen build and it‚Äôs so much fun to play around with. 
---
An absolute nightmare to go against though.
---
And lockers
---
What‚Äôs the problem then?
---
What about ghostface
---
Could've probably made the image show off more proof he is modded but I accidentally didn't take a picture of the whole screen I hope you believe me
---
rule 3 man, no witch hunts
---
Okay yeah that's bad
---
thankfully atleast i'm on the high end of the spectrum, unlike you clearly
---
I like it, but the Test seems a little off.
---
Every 30 seconds you see 10 seconds of the killer? That means your playing only 20 second gaps without seeing them. That's pretty damn strong.
---
Every time I‚Äôve gotten hit so far it‚Äôs felt like it shoudn‚Äôt have
---
*facepalm*
---
Nice I‚Äôve never put in the effort to get there (I‚Äôm a pretty casual gamer) nor do I ever plan to but still congrats man.
---
Not entitled to a kill
---
I'm sorry I'm sorta new what does witch hunts mean is it a Halloween only add-on?
---
*stalks aggressively*
---
I've been doing this, yet i haven't seen one damn Michael while I'm survivor lol
---
This might be fun and possibly better balanced at high ranks, but killers up to green and low purples running this Ruin + Thanatophobia together will get a 100% win rate with that gen time slow down and increase, at least, judging from how survivors play every game I play where killers run that combo.
---
I thought it was like an entire chapter as in like some kinda bonus stage story, the fact they call the DLC chapters is kinda misleading
---
Bruh, ever heard of no one escapes death and blood warden. 2 perks that literally put the game in your full control when the gates are powered. And if the survivors are too altruistic, it can be their downfall.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the point of the spoiler here. These will eventually come out... and it‚Äôs not like finding out is going to ruin someone‚Äôs excitement about the outfit.
---
Trapper: Is this a trap?
---
No names or identities in any posts

Join us brother
---
~~I mean they didn't flame him, they just disconnected.~~
---
This is the result of poor balance and no DC punishment, people will disconnect from shit they deem ridiculously strong.
---
Survs are not the only people, Loads of killers DC if ruin is cleansed early on.
---
Nice! I'm so glad all my adepts are done. For now.
---
Quite a few people in general, whether they play survivor or killer, rage quit way too often. It‚Äôs really annoying.
---
Reddit wont let me comment for awhile as not enough karma :(
---
The Thing has a timer til it's next reveal. Once revealed he must attack a survivor before he can transform again.
---
While transformed the thing pretends to be a survivor, but does negative generator progression. This negative progression is hidden, until the generator should be repaired. Once this happens, every survivor within 4 meters of the generator is brought to the injured state, and The Thing reveals itself, gaining a 130% move speed boost for four seconds.
---
When this happens, the generator that should have been repaired is brought down to 75% completion and begins regressing.
---
When The Thing reveals itself, every survivor within it's suddenly revealed terror radius screams.
---
One the map are three blood draw kits. A Blood Draw, when used by a survivor, marks them as Not The Thing. The Thing cannot transform into a marked survivor. Blood Draw kits become usable as the match progresses, but there are only three on the map. 
---
A Blood Draw kit takes 12 seconds to use, and notifies The Thing when someone is using it.
---
The Thing can reveal itself early, but drops to 80% move speed for four seconds, and doesn't get the bonus of causing nearby survivors to scream.
---
I mean, good? Nice things that make you feel good are usually upvote worthy.
---
big brain play: buy high end PC and play with a controller
---
Yeah, it keeps progress. It's much better to 99% hooks and only break them when you need to since they will repair themselves after 3 minutes if you do break them.
---
Nah
---
I want a proximity chat in game
---
Why are you booing me? I'm right!
---
"Trash"
---
"Go fuck yourself Trash"
---
Grabbing?
---
yep. your point?
---
Short for -reputation and +reputation.
---
It really would be a cool idea if ‚ÄúThe thing‚Äù as a killer could copy exactly what one of the survivors look like and surprise attack someone.
---
"Yeet"
---
I can accept that I die a lot because of unnecessary risks and my need to do generators and try to save people. I do wish there were less face camping instances though but I understand that maybe they're not very good and want those guaranteed points so off we go to the next trial
---
My queue times have jumped from 1 minute to like 7-8 minutes
---
Seems good mate, the main problem is 2 people per gen is 44 seconds down from 80, make it 60 or 56 with 2 people
---
Damn 140 seconds is a little bit long don't you think
---
Ok so there is 2 different clips, The second ones didn't flame.
---
Maybe, but killers always say that survivors aren‚Äôt entitled to escaping or they‚Äôre not allowed to control what the killer does.  Killers don‚Äôt follow the survivors rule book. Works the other way around too.
---
Just add "devs plz fix" and he cant be held accountable lol
---
Do you use the pig?
---
No they didnt.
---
The game is full of annoying players like that, I‚Äôm talking about both sides. Killer and Survivor. they should make crazy penalties for dcing so that you don‚Äôt dc just because the killer is using good addons or the survivor found your ruin in the first 20 seconds of the match
---
his dad works for club penguin and will, in fact, get your habbo perma bobba'd
---
Yeah
---
lol would be interesting
---
How about making the game mode we currently have better?
---
The problem is people will just suicide, not everyone in the video disconnected - Some of them just suicided instead.
---
Honestly there are a lot of things that are really fun such as iri hatchets but only when you are the person using them. BHVR should really focus on reworking things that cause the whole game to go to shit.
---
Dunno why you‚Äôd want to do that, whatever you feel like doing to yourself I guess
---
Oh yes, it s all coming togheter
---
It's not a Nerf really, more of a 'Yeah, that makes sense' you know? Or do you feel my explanation of her ability used in chase hasn't happened to you and is an unlikely occurrence?
---
I personally disagree cause at that point all gens might as well be one man gens plus it‚Äôs already a big deal if three people work on a gen if killer finds them that‚Äôs 3 people that are literally forced off the objective which is more beneficial since if four survivors are on different gens they already are being more efficient than multiple on one and it removes more of the team play aspect of survivors even more.
---
Normally one or two will instantly dc against it. I'll run the killer as long as I can then I'll suicide unless team mate wants to hook farm me quick.
---
Didn‚Äôt know Puppers camped.
---
Yep, grabbing triggers IF too.
---
Swap lightweight for something useful. Maybe prove thyself or borrowed time. Something that benefits the team.
---

Aaah yes, The Lore Accurate Doctor Build, The first Killer I played to stretch the match 30mins.Awful, soul tormenting and hallowing experience, 10/10 would exit.
---
https://i.imgur.com/tjNfhXR.png
---
fair point, but every killer knows if you scatter more than 1 off a gen the others will be back on it when you walk +3m away, i just think 2 people on 1 gen is so very easy to acheive, but 3 is not, reward survs for having 3 people on a gen, not 2, dont cut gen time by an entire half because of 2 people on 1 gen.  
---
An idea ive been sitting on is that the longer you work on a gen without a break or failed skilled check you build cumulative repair speed, to help stop tunneling and camping, if theres even slight pressure then the build up will not reach a high rate, but camp or tunnel and one person left on a gen can build up fat speed and all you need to do as a killer to stop this build up is threaten the gens occasionally.
---
2 reasons why I don‚Äôt play KYF.
---
1. no bloodpoints
---
2. Someone in our group always gets salty at something in a KYF match and it causes friction.
---
Im running the same cosmetics on Ash
---
I see it mostly for traders
---
Surprisingly, that isn't bad --- But it's all Behaviors choice.
---
It's a suggestion, idiot.
---
Suggestions are subjective. Mods were overstepping.
---
Oversatment*
---
Hello and first of all welcome to DBD!
---
I have almost 1000 hours into the game so I hope that I am able to help you out!
---
So it looks like you are looking for an "immersed" game style, so I will be listing to you, what others would deem a "meta" perk loadout! But before I go into that, lets go the why's to your questions.
---
Urban Evasion - A splendid choice for an immersed build, and one of the most popular perks for it! Very useful and used in almost every build!
---
Balanced Landing - If you are able to utilize it's uses well, then it most certainly becomes one of the best exhaustion perks in the game, particularly on the new Stranger Things map and Coldwind maps (the tractor "infinite"). Exhaustion perks are really your anchor for how you want to play the game and is sometimes dependent on the map you play on, so it doesn't really matter which one you pick! However I will go over a popular choice (Sprint Burst) in a sec...
---
Kindred - A very underrated perk and a fantastic choice for solo queue matches. It's not a particularly popular per se, but it still very much helps with efficiency amongst survivors if they are able to capitalize on it correctly. Usually high ranking survivors will use perks that will help themselves to keep chases going for longer (Any Exhaustion perk or mindgaming with Quick n Quiet) or perks that makes unsafe situations safer! (Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, Unbreakable). 
---
Lightweight - I personally am not a fan of using this perk and I'll quote from another reply I did from a post long ago. tldr, it is useless in a chase and makes tracking you even more easy. Remember you can use scratchmarks for mind-games!  
---
&gt;imo, Lightweight is a bad perk. While yes, the killer may be able to lose you because your scratch marks fade away faster, it overall just makes you EASIER to track if they realize you're running Lightweight. And while it doesn't work most of the time, you can ACTUALLY use the scratchmarks for mind-games as well! 
---
\--------  
---
Immersed "Meta" Build (Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst, Spine Chill, Iron Will)
---
Urban Evasion - This will be one of your crutches on being immersed as it allows you to crouch around objects at walking speed. If you use this well, you "might" be able to cause the killer to waste his/her time looking for you. Note that unless you're against a Huntress, this is useless in a chase.
---
Sprint Burst - When all else fails, Sprint Burst is here to save you! If your hiding spot has been found out then you'll be able to sprint away to safety! Just remember not to run at the beginning of the match.
---
Spine Chill - This is a very underrated perk and I consider it essential to hiding in an immersed build. This will provide you enough time to hide somewhere without the killer knowing where you are, or at the very least get you enough distance away from em so you can run to safety.
---
Iron Will - Got damaged? No problem! You got Iron Will to back you up and will muffle your grunts of pain, this final perk is really up to you as an immersed survivor shouldn't get damaged in the first place... Although it IS pretty inevitable at times. Take this final perk as a suggestion, not a necessity. If you want you could even put Kindred here.
---
\--------
---
I hope this helped you and if you have any more questions just lemme know!
---
Not meta perks.
---
As God stated "STFU BOOMER" seriously though am I the only one not surprised keemstar is saying killers need to be nerfed?  Poor You not being able to win all the time so you gotta whine and bitch to the developers, get the fuck out of here ya Garden decoration
---
I like it.
---
Keemstars an asshole so everything he says is invalid haha
---
So...? They still change the tide of the game, and even if you don't have them, you only need to hook one survivor to create a lot of pressure. Especially against altruistic survivors
---
We don't need double pallet spawns. We know what happened back then.
---
at low ranks run whatever perks you find enjoyable to use. just know that some perks can lose effectiveness as you rank up. for example lightweight may help shake off low rank killers, but experienced higher ranked killers will not be affected by it as much.
---
you‚Äôll notice as you rank up, survivors tend to use more and more ‚Äúpractical‚Äù builds. these builds will almost always consist of an exhaustion perk (sometimes two if they run an exhaustion perk + adrenaline) as well as practical perks such as self heal, borrowed time, unbreakable, decisive strike, and other perks that can directly get you out of sticky situations.
---
Said by someone whos first action when the killer sees him is to run and drop every pallet on the map.
---
Dead hard might not sound good on paper, but it‚Äôs pretty good when playing. Most of the red ranks I play with use this perk.
---
Basically, when you dead hard you don‚Äôt take damage and you get a slight boost to gain distance between you and the killer. This can help you recover from mistakes and take the killer for an extra loop if you play it right.
---
I love it, it gives them a sense of accomplishment, especially if I've ran them around 3 Gens later. It's the price you pay for being a good teammate. üòå
---
can‚Äôt y‚Äôall just switch to nurse 
---
/s
---
Oh cool I'm not alone! No idea what's happening with it but it changed 3 times then finally stopped thank god
---
This leap was so awesome. Looked lit.
---
I‚Äôm a bottom, so I care
---
I would take it as a positive, your clearly getting better at the game for it. Plus an easy 4 kills as the killer is boring for all involved.
---
Lol I go to bacon city and throw it to bring the killer to me expeditiously
---
Ye same for me. I get it and reroll it, next day it's something completely different.
---
I see you're a man of culture as well
---
Depends on your play style, bond is great when you're getting chased for keeping the killer away from your teammates working on gens.
---
Empathy can let you know if someone needs healing or is being chased, if they are self caring or working on a gen then they've probably lost the killer but if they are running around erratically then you have a pretty good idea where the killer probably is which helps if you want to be stealthy, altruistic or both
---
oooh thanks a lot for the detailed explanation!
---
the meta immersed build seems great! though I don't think iron Will will be more useful than Kindred..  
---
I really don't get how to use Spine Chill.. I guess I'll have to watch some videos
---
thanks again! off to leveling \^ 3 \^
---
You got a 3k, considering 2k is the killer winning I'd say it's fine.
---
Why do you need to go against worse people?
---
You're free to do it I guess. I personally rely on adrenaline and only let myself get healed when I know I'll be going for a save
---
Just don't get into the habit of always needing to be healthy
---
Oh right, clearly. How did I not know
---
lol
---
A killer getting a 2K is not a win. In what would does getting 50% out of 100% mean you win?
---
Monstrous shrine changes the tide of the game.
---
Every perk does, some do it very little though.
---
yeah that seems to be the case with lightweight, even at my rank killers can find me still..
---
thanks! I've been eyeing Claudette for self heal.. let's see
---
Place portals in obviously decently hidden sounds also make sure they can't hear it, don't place them Willy nilly as they could be in dead zones making it a wasted portal. For the shred it has a big hitbox so use that to your advantage,it's great if you think a Survivors gonna drop a pallet early or baiting them away from it meaning you can just cancel it and M1 them.
---
Ikr i had to go see if it was
---
thanks for replying!
---
yeah lightweight seems useless after all, borrowed time seems scary to use, I'll look into it \^ 3 \^
---
nea is the heccing entity
---
Again: A killer getting a 2K is not a win. In what would does getting 50% out of 100% mean you win?
---
also i HAVE to activate them in order to use "of the abyss". Idk bro i am getting really frustrated on what they want me to do
---
I mean Doc I can understand because the only counter to his maximum tr build is to loop him constantly but a Spirit??? Are you a masicust or do you just want the pain of a spirit game to be over quickly?
---
Because the ranking system is broken. I'm a rank 14 and I still get matched with rank 20s. Doesn't really matter though. I do enjoy bullying rank 20 killers.
---
I am a Nurse and Spirit main. Come at me.
---
Nice dude u bullied a new player, recorded it, and posted it on here so people will think that you‚Äôre cool.
---
I never make it past rank 10 as a killer cuz I don't play much and when I do I destroy the survivors so quickly I get no pips.
---
"Oh, this killer is doing outstandingly well on this rank. They are probably destroying new players' experience and should be matched against better survivors so everyone can have a balanced experience. Those survivors probably had no fun. De-pip."
---
Yea... sorry for doing well and not farming.
---
What more do you want when the devs have literally said 2 kills = killer win.
---
If they wanted to balance around 4k and 0k then the hatch mechanic wouldn't exist.
---
You're trying to tell the developers how their own game works?
---
but if i hide them it wont be close enough to survivors for the "of the abyss" tracking ability? and also i never seem to be able to sneak up on anyone anyways even when i do
---
aftercare
---
Well, it isnt that i want to face worse people, it is that after the matchmaking fix I am still getting survivors 3-4 ranks higher than me. 
---
I do wanna face harder survivors, and I am happy that I can do something like that. I am just sick of facing higher tier survivor groups around 85% of the time. I wish it would reward you more for playing against higher rank killers and survivors.
---
Iron Will will help you **during a chase** or when you're trying to hide again if you manage to shake the killer off or if there are high walls where the killer cannot see, forcing the killer to either listen for breathing or footsteps.
---
Kindred will help you **after a chase** as it provides information for your team, and if they're reliable enough, can make most of their time. Kindred loses value if you are in a group of four, as you can just tell them where the killer is in proximity to you, and which one of your team will pick you up.
---
It really comes down to whether you're confident in your ability to run killers around or if you reaaaaally trust your teammates to make the best judgement!
---
\---------
---
[Spine Chill](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Spine_Chill) is a really great perk as unlike Premonition, will always have a 100% uptime (meaning no cooldown) and can actually help you during a chase! If the killer is standing in proximity 36 meters away from you and is looking at you, the perk will light up in the toolbar. In Dead By Daylight, the average terror radius of most killers are 32 meters, meaning you will get a heads up a bit before the killer's terror radius music starts kicking in. This perk also is especially powerful against stealth killers (except Michael Myers at T1 since he completely negates it). Side note that Spine Chill also makes your vaulting speed a tad faster so it can be very useful in a chase. 
---
I encourage you to look at [PainReliever's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_RifCSaesGVAmguu-iU-ow) videos on youtube as he plays an immersed gameplay as opposed to other content creators. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YEqJA4kF8A) will certainly help!
---
Baby huntress now too? Damn dude. You‚Äôre starting to make me think you must suck ass to be matched up with all these new players.
---
Again: A killer getting a 2K is not a win. In what world
---
would does getting 50% out of 100% mean you win?
---
Jesus man, at least crop the stolen repost meme
---
...Ds and adrenaline are not op.... and spirit does need a reword/nerf
---
Empathy tends to give you way more information over the course of the match. Not only does it let you know where the killer is when somebody is in a chase, it also gives you a good idea of what your teammates are doing. Bond gives you more info that's immediately relevant to you, but I find myself being able to strategize way more effectively when I run empathy. 
---
Think of the extreme: say youre going against the plague and your team doesnt cleanse. Well now you have full info on your entire team all game, regardless of distance. Bond's utility doesn't come anywhere near this.
---
That may be your problem lmao. Get good perks for him.
---
It wasn't from healing others, it was from being hit. Literally, get hit 3 times, the 4th is free.
---
Keemstar: *gets killed*
---
Also Keemstar: OH MY GOD BEHAVIOR FIX UR GAME
---
Bro he is brand new this is why people hate coming into this community because of people like you
---
Good Lord, could she be any whinier?
---
Bond is better.
---
36m is a very big radius
---
Lets you know what everyone does
---
Lets you know where the killer is (just look for someone throwing down pallets, running in circles and fast-vaulting windows
---
Because of the range, it only gives you valuable information.
---
Makes looking for gens in in-door maps easier
---
Makes it so you know if someone else is going for the unhook
---
Lets you know where others are when you're getting chased, so you don't interrupt them when they are working on gens
---
Empathy lets you know where someone is being chased, but only after they got hit, and that's about it.
---
Cry me a river. I prefer to be at lower ranks. Mainly so I can bully rank 20 killers.
---
You fuck up your speed boost by ramming into a tree: Yo, Soldier, you got your permission to die!
---
such a fun game this is
---
Ok, I see you are completely delusional and only seem to want to break balance in the game by giving survivors even more leverage. I'm done arguing against you because you have the stupidest logic. Enjoy the rest of your day.
---
Weird that you got downvoted, figured I‚Äôd even you out
---
U ‚Äúprefer‚Äù to be at low ranks, or you can‚Äôt get to higher ranks?
---
well i am grinding all the time but got  0 control in what the bloodweb decides to give me
---
‚ÄúRemember son, dying is gay.‚Äù
---
wow she broke the pallet too
---
I haven't played this game too much so I'm still trying to learn and shit. And I've played people like you, really ruins this game for me when the community does stuff like this.
---
Aah yes the good old "guess Ill get a new GPU"
---
Or maybe its the drivers? Had sonething similar when I got my 2080.. but I needed to get it refunded since it was actually broken...
---
My -rep was from
---
\-playing doctor
---
\-camping when the survivors were rushing the hook
---
\-using amanda's letter and body blocking a jigsaw box for the entire countdown (that one was a dick move, I admit)
---
I think it's because calling those things happening "unlucky" and saying "it really happens" sort of feeds into the prayer.
---
I hit rank 4 for the first time yesterday and I regret every second I have to spend there
---
No he's just a pansy ass
---
We call these people "Entitled"
---
That was a pretty great movie.
---
Actually we didn't know her at all
---
So, how is this post relate to Dbd or make sense at all? What do the numbers mean?
---
It doesn't matter how much you repeat yourself.
---
**THE DEVELOPERS HAVE SAID 2K IS A KILLER WIN**
---
What the fuck are you not understanding here?
---
Again: Again: A killer getting a 2K is not a win. In what world would does getting 50% out of 100% mean you win?
---
That moment when people think Jurassic  park dinosaurs are release in but they actually had fur. Bet if I put a completely shaved man you‚Äôd think it a gorilla üòÇ
---
I remember dying to my "mistake" when a killer decided to bloodlust me for a whole minute around one of the unsafest pallets on Badham. He really outplayed me with that W button.
---
Ad hominem.
---
Ignorant prick.
---
Nah it's because you're trash and can't handle non potato rank killers.  You're an embarrassment to the community.  Consider uninstalling.
---
It was so funny in game
---
QUENTIN ACE
---
Nooooo
---
How does this collaborate to ANYTHING?!
---
Well placing portals on generators is kinda 50/50 if it'll work or not because let's say you place it there then teleport back you can surprise them and after that they will possibly break it wasting more of their time and if the generator is in a one doored room you can bodyblock it giving a free it.
---
I. Don't. Camp.
---
From the very beginning I'm telling you that the system punishes killers that don't camp and just do well. 
---
Apply pressure correctly and end chases quickly. Down one, hook, go to another, down before the unhook, leave them on the ground and down the third one.
---
Survivors on low ranks can't loop and for ending chases and games quickly you get what? depips. Sorry for doing well.
---
The only way to rank up is to not do terribly bad and not do well either.
---
you can't even read.
---
Its the creature from the movie ‚ÄúThe Sacrifice‚Äù
---
Monto is truly all of the above :)
---
This is a masterpiece.
---
How???
---
Did...did someone just downvote a post asking for a favor?!
---
I would think that someone who just got the game wouldn‚Äôt know that shit
---
If the survivor has to get hatch to escape that means you‚Äôve already won, the entitlement to getting a 4K‚ÄîI have to laugh.
---
&gt;What the fuck do you mean?
---
Exactly what I said
---
&gt;There's only ONE mode, and it gets better all the time.
---
No shit, but the only permanent improvement, excluding quality of life and events, has been the addition of endgame. The overall pace of the game is the fundamental issue, among other things,  and getting killers and perks to bandaid that isn't a real improvement. 
---
&gt;It‚Äôd be nice to have an arcade mode. Just imagine survivors running all over the place, killers double teaming people. Why not just throw a fun mode in like this. I know plenty of people that would love this shit. Plain ole ranked dbd gets dull after a few years.
---
It would be nice. It would be even better if it wasn't just an unoriginal idea of "just double the amount of survivors and killers. Fuck blood points also."
---
Is is possible to learn this power
---
Hope they manage to add cosmetics for him like they did for Pig
---
Huntress is up there, people don‚Äôt know how to play her e.g you. You watch a streamer and make your mind up. So you don‚Äôt actually do it for yourself and see the potential. Plus every killer is skill based lmao.

It's easy the host has to be killer then a friend ready up and when you hear the heartbeat swap to killer...

the issue is the lack of counterplay. nothing else.

It‚Äôs people like you who ruin others chance to get into the game, honestly you could‚Äôve let them all die (assuming everyone was a baby) and got hatch and hope for a new game without them. Not ruin their game just cause the couldn‚Äôt get a skill check, you‚Äôre at a level where that‚Äôs gonna happen a lot, you‚Äôre gonna get a mix of those who do, Don‚Äôt, and kinda know that they‚Äôre doing.

Dead man walkin

Hot damn man

Its too bad lullaby is a hex.
---
yes, literally google the thing dbd and you will see a thousand trys and all of them suck.
---
do you think you're smart or funny? pipe down mate, they where bad but you make yourself look like an entitled killer main by saying that and it makes me think you're the type of guy who either crouches around the map with sprint burst all game or gets bullied with his baby killer
---
Why people are so fixated with that?.. it's an honest question. Yeah I got it is an okay movie, but there are tons of other movies that are actually horror, which have better or scarier killers.
---
I'm seriously asking that because I really can't understand why would be such a good news having IT in the game. I'd rather see more original characters at this point or scarier killers
---
For just one reason, seeing It looping a survivor with a red balloon in his hand as a weapon isn't really scary. Knowing how they never made a really new mechanic in the game even for the newest killers, that's what are we gonna end up seeing. It would be funny than anything else
---
I wish i meet u lol
---
Your boring as fuck then. Simple as that.
---
I'm just teaching him a lesson.
---
you would like to see nurses more often? What rank are you? lol
---
The top two show that your not a high rank or haven't played long. Or are just on console in the case of nurse, if so she belongs in the please bully me section. Scream is fucking annoying to go against for me since i can never push him out of power, and my team always seems to get 1 shot by him.
---
you say that, but it's more like tripping over a rock. you just kinda vibrate then inevitably fall on your face.
---
&gt;No perks mode
---
"killers fucked to death mode" or "only play s tier killers mode."
---
I could say the same kiddo. I guess you're too young to have been in any other community before, cute how you tried to dismissing my points but just taking it in that way ignoring how many communities there are out there
---
That's why I think you've never been in one before. Listen kid, grow up then come back would you? Great
---
Yup, they started 2 days ago
---
The first man on Earth that wants to see more Nurses
---
Forgot to mention, I am a green rank potato. So Nurses are still fun and are not as OP as rank 1 Nurses yet. Though I haven't seen any green rank Nurses in a while... :/
---
Happened to me
---
Do u know console players like us wish we can join it too ?  I have red ping 6/10 game and 4/10 have yellow. Its unplayable
---
Nobody is stopping them. If the only way they can have fun is by making another person have a bad time with  their friends then I don't really want to play with them.
---
I want an Evil Dead by Daylight mode. Ash with his chainsaw and boomstick hunting down 4 killers trying to escape.
---
Would they though? I mean Herbert looks a little bit like Dwight anyway. I don't think Jeffrey Comb's likeness is necessary. But if they go for it anyway, I'm positive that it would be cheap as heck. Combs is a very nice human being.
---
Lmfao that‚Äôs what I was thinking. But I just started to use killers so I didn‚Äôt know if there was some etiquette that I missed

I edited my post for you baby ;)

Bloodpoints should be solely for the original ranked mode. An arcade mode like this would be much better with everything unlocked and available to use. Maximum fuckery.
---
Imagine that but on the next level in the official DbD forum where they will shadow ban you, mute your comments, delete your posts and so on if you disagree with them

:)

When I am literally running in front of the killer and they refuse to hit me, they're wasting a lot of their "time points"

---
What a bad idea
---
A strategy that is very effective against SWFs is teleporting to a portal right next to where I hooked someone when I know someone is camping around waiting for the unhook
---
No. No etiquette. Survivors aren't entitled to escaping despite them thinking that. Don't let them try to crybully you.
---
again, you missed the point. People want to progress in the main mode, not fuck around in a off brand mode that gives nothing. You think on paper that its gonna be some weird builds 2v8 10 gens to have fun and dick around, and then its double ruin nurses. Nobody wants to play around with all unlocked perks outside of custom games, which nobody does now. Your literally just taking custom games and putting matchmaking in there. Its a shit idea and you  should feel bad for having it.
---
Lmao you‚Äôre trash
---
Just stop.. You're describing kyf.
---
Wait, are you the huntress that played against OTZ once?
---
I can never catch you streaming
---
Oh god people would be mending all over the place. Mending party 2014!!!
---
Nah, this guy is just a fucking idiot
---
&gt; Lets you know where others are when you're getting chased, so you don't interrupt them when they are working on gens
---
In my experience with bond users it is the opposite of this.
---
Hmm yes, either make it 100% useless, or have an insta down at the start of the match
---
Lmfao what an entitled crybaby
---
Tbh it's pretty decent. Haha
---
good internet
---
The farming would be insane on bloodhunt. Plus toxicity will riseeeee upppp
---
Combs loves Lovecraft stuff and was willing to play Herbert West in two sequels, one of which was pretty terrible. So I don't think he would turn it down because he clearly likes the character.
---
Yea let's just put Agitation, Iron Grasp and Mad Grit all into one perk
---
I let 1 or 2 survivors go if I've won before the second gen is complete because I have a bunch of extra bloodpoint stacks from bbq and chili, but that's just me and there's a lot of killers that don't do it. They aren't expected to either
---
Point of the game is to have fun at the end of the day, so just do what you want as long as you're not being a dick (e.g. bullying one player or just fucking about)
---
Survivor: Stop being so mean!
---
Me, a nurse main: *silently takes a ebony mori out of pocket*
---
Survivor: Of course you had one too
---
Huntress is only scary with oneshot hatchets. Trapper can be a pain in the butt, but is pretty weak if you don't step into his traps.
---
I'm currently 9, do only play with red ranks though and hate that every game is either nurse or spirit.
---
I actually love to play against myers and ghostface. I love it when ghostface just peeks around a corner to stalk me lol.
---
I'm really a fan of reconnaissance, especially for solo queues. I feel like Face your fears is a little busted though. Granted the -25% is a good penalty, if they do manage to get to 15%, they'd pop gens way to fast IMO. Additionally, Tunnel Vision would also be good for solo queues, and it's always good to know where the killers are. Great ideas all around though!
---
I‚Äôve said this since day one, we need Herbert West.
---
Wraith has now the n-word pass
---
It‚Äôs not, the survivor can jump first and you can close it whilst they‚Äôre jumping. If it‚Äôs a stand off and you get there the same time killer gets it.
---
1 way I see it working id that they essentially No Power and since they have to move slower for each legion member they have to use well coordinated strategies and in a 4 legion team they have to land 4 hits to down a survivor
---
How does Hope counter Hex:NoED
---
Please say that you‚Äôre joking
---
now that you lay it down like that iron will seems amazing.. guess I'll stick with kindred for now and level Jake when urban becomes passable to try it myself.
---
yeah turns out spine chill is amazing.. and wow how he sneaks past a chase so good!  
---
I was just very intimidated with the generator nerf when spine chill is active.. it all makes sense now that it's only fair that you should gtfo off whatever you're doing when you're given a warning
---
thanks so much \^ 3 \^
---
Look at devour hope and you have your question answered
---
This isn‚Äôt balance, I play both sides and would hate this.

„Åã„Çè„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÑÔºÅ
---
Oh fuck oh shit
---
lol this is not a good way to look at things man.... The game is big enough to where they could be doing interesting things with it. And they SHOULD be trying new things.
---
That's lovely to hear. So it's just a license for Jeffery Combs likeness and that's it? The DBD creative team can treat it just like an original killer after that?
---
I‚Äôve never disagreed more with a tier list
---
Immersed can be fun, but the second the killer aint near me im on a gen
---
You probably haven't seen a good huntress that lands hatchets across the map yet then
---
I love it. And looked back, your Nea is cute too!!
---
Can we not with this.
---
They are following horror related media because they are a horror product. Not every single person they follow is a hint to a new chapter. People are reading way to much into this
---
Yeaaaa its a WIN WIN BABY!
---
Oh boi that's what I'd love to see
---
Nice! I will add you as soon as i can! But i dont use mic though
---
Survivor perk, classic slag: unhook people from 128m away
---
I hate doctor!!!!!
---
Are all of your ideas this bad?
---
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Boring games yay
---
turns the flashlight into a can of mace
---
Well.. because it‚Äôs a perk designed around punishing survivors for not cleansing dull totems.
---
Damn.
---
Can you elaborate please kinda hard to take your word without a reasoning.
---
You need a break from the internet their lil buddie. 
---
And its like you didn‚Äôt see the whole 8 survivors 2 killers part. Thats the whole fucking idea ya weird little shit.
---
What?
---
So you can call me whatever and it's fine and if I dare call you out for your lack of experience I'm proving your point?
---
Grow up please. If your skin is this thin no wonder you find anything toxic
---
Don‚Äôt call them cosmetics when they change gameplay. Plus there are already plenty of ultra rare cosmetics
---
Same in PS4
---
Shouldn't have tunneled to avoid this DS
---
Yeah, like fixing the level designs of the maps. That's a start
---
What thing is survivor fail to notice is when they do that, I'll  just shrug it off and end the game, and focus to get another tombstone or ward from web and try again, once I've finally got it, I don't really use tombstone anymore.
---
I'm playing on console and I had survivor who keep jump in locker, I had just end the game by hook last one, ward saved me tombstone, so next game, I've try again and I had notice very same survivors come in my lobby, and she was my first victim since I knew she would just jump in locker when she found out, and last survivor DC during last tombstone kill animation. That first victim survivor send me message and I suck and I needed tombstone to win, I am cancer to that game, etc. I told her the way she avoid me to get trophy is only force me to do again and again all over, till I got that trophy, then I don't need use it anymore. I've finally got the trophy while ago and never use tombstone since then.
---
TL;DR You do that only to make people just get another one or warded, and doing again till they get achievement/trophy.
---
Im what fucking world is thos a bad idea?? GOD I feel lile every person on this subreddit is a fucking 12 year old.
---
Entitled little participation medal kid lol.
---
The thing is that Killers NEED more bloodpoints.
---
Progression on generators is reduced by 30%. That‚Äôs where up gave up reading, might as well just make corrupt intervention block all gens for the whole game
---
Give me a single reason on how this is a good idea
---
I want that character potraits
---
After a hit you need to do an animation and your ms drops to a crawl, buying the person who is already down a hook a lot of time to lose the killer.
---
On the otherhand, if they commit to the chase and don't hit you, their ms actually *increases* thanks to bloodlust.
---
r/PerkByDaylight
---
Lightweight in my opinion only gets most of its use when traversing from generator to generator while running, but if the killer is nearby, you should almost never be running in the first place. 
---
In a chase, the perk is near useless, and actually makes you more easier to track if the killer realizes that you are using the perk. They can simply just follow the fading scratchmarks which should be 3 seconds closer to you.
---
Survivors can use their scratchmarks in a middle of a chase inside a jungle gym to throw the killer off, and buy you a couple seconds to find another pallet. It's very hard to explain, but its much more simple to show haha.
---
If you wanted to use Lightweight, you might as well use Dance with Me, as it's uses are in my opinion, much better than what Lightweight has to offer.
---
You seem really angry and upset. Got Sand in your vagina?
---
All good! I just love the game! It‚Äôs fun playing it
---
&gt;His power is shapeshifting and thus the balloon is not his weapon
---
I know, I described how BHVR would make it tho. Especially taking into consideration they never made new mechanics, just mixed them up like for Gordon or ghost. Even legion I would say
---
&gt;He can absolutely have shapeshifting abilities too . 
---
I would love it. And I knew he was a shape shifter, was pretty obvious, buuut also Freddy is a shape shifter. Now look what BHVR did. That's what I mean
---
It happend to me a couple times before, but I ended up buying all the killers anyway
---
I loved having a locked lvl 2 pig tho
---
In the scenario the user above you is talking about, why would you stop chasing an injured survivor to go after someone that has just been unhooked?
---
Just to put him in phase 2 on the hook? Please, by downing the other player you can keep your pressure on the map and if you have BBQ you can go to the next survivor to keep the pressure on and if not, you still roughly know where 2 survivors were not that long ago.
---
The maps are good. They are fun. They work. The whole comcept of the game is complete. They aren‚Äôt going to be changing it. Its been out 3 years and is successful as is. A WHOLE NEW WAY TO PLAY would make things interesting. THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR BELOVED MODE GOES AWAY. Sorry i‚Äôve been replying to little kids on here honestly lmao.
---
I agree with everything except spirit and the top an bottom tier.
---
You can actually flip this around to be the Killer‚Äôs Creed too though. Sometimes shit happens and sometimes the game isn‚Äôt played fairly. Some people use lag-switch (yay, that‚Äôs going away) some people use a bunch of team tactics. As a killer you can cheese the game (time to slug everyone, that is almost gone thanks to the end-game collapse) and as a survivor you can too (a whole trained meme stream team with Discord). Just don‚Äôt be an asshole.
---
Because it would make it a trash perk. if it bothers you that much, just cleanse all the totems.
---
Why not just make it so exit gates can‚Äôt open so you always win
---
Can't relate, I'm usually the bad teammate
---
Technically legion can be male or female
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if they added him and bond became a must.
---
Go back to the friendzone baby Claudette.
---
Jake is my main but as a killer I'm a Freddy main, so this post has me feeling all kinds of things
---
&gt;plays only with rank 20 fresh players
---
&gt;claims he "enjoys bullying rank 20 killers"
---
&gt;cites the same rank 20 killers complimenting him as evidence of his greatness
---
&gt;refuses to respond to me BTFOing him so I have to do it again
---
Man.
---
The game should be balanced at all ranks lol. That's what balancing means. Any player, using any character, at any experience should have a fair go. Not an easy time, but a fair go. OP's suggestion makes it such that killers at high ranks have more of a fair go seeing as high rank survivors are going to play optimal. But then low rank survivors will not have a fair go lol. You know there are less experienced than inexperienced players now right? So making the game playable for less experienced players won't make the game die lol. Purple and greens aren't new either, they're just not as optimal as red.
---
The 9th maybe was the rumor i saw...
---
no. people just don't like losing. your odds of winning go up the less survivors there are.
---
Your negativity makes me wish my friends would kill me.
---
Love doing that with urban evasion. They have no clue
---
Yeah i get it . But pennywise has a big studio behind him , its pretty hot right now . I guess they would be willing to work something out ( they work pretty hard on the stranger things chapter )
---
Thanks bud
---
Oh that‚Äôs just unusable for me damn
---
KYF does not support 2v8. Stop bringing up KYF.
---
What lesson? Don‚Äôt play this game because people are toxic?
---
Maybe break the chase then
---
Nah I‚Äôm good buddy I‚Äôm a gen rusher.
---
Okay - I just looked into this. There is a 5% chance to find a purple item and a 2% chance to find a pink. There is only a 7% chance of finding a key so the odds of finding a key of purple or higher quality is much much less than 30% lmfao
---
Then it would be an even worse perk.
---
Entity: not funny didn't laugh
---
After finding out what he named his cat, I'd rather not have anything associated with him in the game lol
---
Funnily enough, in a perverse way it might be better to let 'em get the achievement if it's a "last guy and you're dead either way" situation. Means one guy running less tombstone games in the future.
---
But you are correct. It's never your job to give the other team an easy ride, though one part of the appeal of this game for me is that you can.
---
Its fun to communicate. Get the salt started before hand.
---
Hey uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
How do I get to be as cool as you?
---
Good, fuck those survivor entitled fucks, they wanna play op meta, we can do the same /s
---
That not a good point, that's a bad point.
---
Say the advantages
---
Me : *wants to play spirit and the match to last more than 5 minutes and be actually good*
---
Survivors : "ehhhh dc and we dont even try to play, stop playing op killers noob."
---
That‚Äôs bullshit but ok.
---
&gt;The maps are good. They are fun. They work. The whole comcept of the game is complete. They aren‚Äôt going to be changing it. 
---
I'm so sorry but you're so wrong in so many levels
---
There are still infinities if you use balance landing. Huge loops that are very abusable. They had to introduce a new vault speed (mid) because their level design is shit (the level designer was a waiter before getting the job). Some maps had to be changed (pre school) or cut smaller (swamp) due to bad level design and many others still shit.
---
The maps are far from fine. They cannot find a nice balance to give enough resources to Survivors but also give opportunities to killers, they fuck up in a way or another.
---
&gt;Its been out 3 years and is successful as is. A WHOLE NEW WAY TO PLAY would make things interesting
---
Or make it worse. Since now the teams would be busy making them instead of fixing issues that still in the game. We're not talking about blizzard or riot games, it's BHVR and they have a limited amount of man power. I'd rather see those efforts towards a better game than new modes.
---
We still don't have an option for colorblind people! Just saying!
---
&gt;THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR BELOVED MODE GOES AWAY. Sorry i‚Äôve been replying to little kids on here honestly lmao.
---
No, takes away time from the coders and designers that now would spend time making that while other things should be look upon to.
---
I would love more modes for sure but as it is right now is impossible. Unless few hundreds of coders and designer get there, unpaid, to do so. That's the sad reality, even if it sucks since with killer and survivors you can make game modes specific for each killer for example but time and men power aren't sufficient now
---
I have no idea how the license would work. I'm not a lawyer. Though I can't imagine who they would pair him with that would be licensed since the bad guys in his movie are kind of just reanimated corpses.
---
Chief your hat wasn‚Äôt activated you could‚Äôve left
---
I'm actually a survivor main, I just really don't like having killers flamed for my team mates mistakes.
---
But "genrush" is another joke term.
---
Many have tried. All have failed. Where's Pumpkinhead SMH

lol take a break from the internet there kiddo.

You got 6 downvotes tho

Because otherwise it would be completely useless.

Everybody complaining in the comments and probably not realising this is a quote form "the office" is the funniest shit I've seen today

Noed is only counter to adrenaline

Personally, I think Freddy is stronger than Micheal, but both are fun; I don‚Äôt think you could go wrong with either
---
Welp, you are. And should be proud of it
---
Yeap valid points  right there . I guess i am optimistic . I imagine they had messed up code from the beggining and we all know how hard is to change code from its core . It takes time , and  needs hands and minds . I just hope they get more people working on it .
---
Killer main here. Having completely defunct perks isn't really a good thing honestly, it just makes games stagnant in terms of opposition with an even higher ratio of players just using DH/BT/Adren/DS instead of anything with more variety.
---
Did he have adrenaline? Anyone that runs that can not complain about noed

Everyone is fighting to maintain the 666 upvotes, lol.
---
Unless the killer was playing nurse
---
That still doesn't excuse it or make me want to enjoy his work??? That's like saying the confederates were justified in being racist because of the time period they lived in. Just because it was the norm doesn't make it a good thing.
---
Every 13th of every month, a rank reset happens. You drop 5-10 ranks
---
Just let's everybody have fun
---
I could see how 4 brand new parts way back when was a genrush, now it seems a little slower, but still possible to have gear and coms for it so ya, I guess I‚Äôd feel rushed too if there was a huge item advantage.
---
There is a rank reset every 13th of the month but ever since stranger things dropped the game has been buggy with the ranks and matching different ranked players together
---
I'd argue that running infinite and tombstone is an asshole move. Play dumb games, win dumb prizes.
---
omg it looks exactly like him
---
People enjoy watching her?
---
Well this point actually proves the meme. It was your choice looping an unsafe pallet :)
---
Yep, can't wait for dedicated survivors. All the current survivors just aren't putting their all into it.

You‚Äôre probably missing their player level prestige it‚Äôll be a tiny green number they won‚Äôt be lower level.

---
You can still get hit one step after a fast vault and two steps after a medium vault. You didn't even fully land there.
---
Do you think youre cool? Do you think bullying new players will get you a bigger or functioning dick? All this will do is make new players quit the game and make the player base even smaller than it already is. Can you please just quit the game? It would be better for everyone else...
---
That trailer was the most infuriating thing
---
Keep refreshing the post. You‚Äôll see the upvotes constantly re-adjusting to maintain the 666.
---
I mean, everyone wants something new but yeah you're right, it's kinda dumb.
---
Aw no not The Leg
---
I mean mathematically eliminating the opposition as quickly and as efficiently as possible makes the most sense it just seems a bit unsporting to me so I don‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt play like I used to anymore, winning the game and having fun seemed to be at odds too often so I just try and get two hooks on everyone (usually non-consecutively) depending on how much I think they/their team can take... But that‚Äôs just what I like to do, to each their own.
---
Yep totally. /s
---
Idea: ultra rare offering: double the gates and gens. Now don't "harass" my unique and awesome idea.
---
Only judging by what I saw from the clip, i probably should have asked for more context before jumping to conclusions, so I take it back. My bad.
---
I mean... Lightweight is kind of a wasted perk slot so you can run really anything. Why not counter low rank camping killers
---
Why not? He‚Äôs dead. It doesn‚Äôt matter if he was racist or not.
---
Oh that is cute, all but 1 of your posts didnt go over 100 upvotes apart from content about Logan Paul, and half of your posts are just other peoples content or images of new skins that are images released by devs, actually hit me in the feels on how adorable your ego is. Yet here I am, with 1 out of 1 posts that did in fact breach 100 upvotes and I also have my dignity due to not posting shitty memes, Logan Paul and stealing content from other creators/sources. üòâ
---
Because the dude was a shitty person. I don't have to like him lol. I didn't say anyone else had to agree, I just gave my thoughts on it.
---
Thats awesome mate! All my mom gave me was trauma &gt;.&lt;
---
I could not get past rank 20 in the entire first month of me playing the game.  Wow he must have sucked.  No, our rank system was broken on PS4 and we reset back to 20 every single day when you first logged back in lol.  It felt like I was stuck in the movie Groundhog Day only there was a lot less Bill Murray and a lot more blown skillchecks and facecamping.
---
Yeah but even then it's still hit or miss, there's a 1/3 chance they break ruin instead of haunted and myc is easily countered by more than one person coming for the save so it's a gamble on who's exposed.
---
I mean, to be fair, they didn't even have to read the rest of the comments to understand that they were being sarcastic. They made it overtly obvious. But I get you!
---
Lol all you did was explain what freddy‚Äôs power did he was still shit tier.
---
I don‚Äôt like survivor entitlement
---
Your cool
---
Blame the devs, not the player.
---
I‚Äôm aware of the effect I have on survivors
---
Ideally if the team knows how to play her than I just cleanse endgame after you the last gen is popped.  If you got potatoes feeding her corrupted during the match though unfortunately you're pretty much forced to join in there.
---
You said you didn‚Äôt want the character in the game because of what Lovecraft named the cat. Seems pretty pathetic to me.
---
How do you check reputation?
---
Lol okay.
---
Lol, that sounds like adding Chucky to the game.
---
and lose most if the surviors have half a brain
---
Yeah iirc they changed the terror radius to where it was a little fainter if they were above or below you but honestly I can't tell a difference with any terror radius.
---
If you were higher than rank 14 you might have been aware that you cut that loop short and wasted a palette

This happened to me in a few games during the bloodhunt. It‚Äôs like, thanks bro (‚Äúbro‚Äù can mean both the killer and the person unhooking me who slinks away as the killer rushes right back).
---
She is there! Just not unlocked yet
---
It's actually the most helpful for the Killer, when it comes to ending the game. It isnt the best for emblems, though, as an already injured survivor gives less chase and maliciousness points. So at higher ranks you get a lot less campers and tunnelers (at least I do, I want that R1) and more Killers that try to drag a game out as long as possible to ensure maximum emblem gain.
---
A tip that I can give you is: place portals right next to the generators so you can detect survivors with your ability, BUT keep an inactive portal somewhere near (hidden if you can) so if the survivors clear your portal, yo will have another one to teleport to and smack them.
---
What I do is select 3 or 4 gens close together, put a portal in all of them and one extra somewhere in the middle of all of them.
---
That way I can teleport somewhere near the gens smack the survivors and replace my broken portal.
---
For the shred ability is just a matter of practice. I suggest using it only when the survivor is running straight in a long trail (like going for a window) and just basic attack survivors when on loops.
---
Also using the shred attack destroys the pallets faster than smacking them, so you can use that to save a couple of seconds.
---

Question is what kind of horror fan are you?

Slasher is a good series on Netflix if you are a Slasher fan also scream 1-4 should still be on netflix.

Typo in the title, nice...
---
Often overlooked as in not a viable option. Yes you might find yourself on your confort zone avoiding chases, but you need to break out of that habit asap, imagine that all the 4 players are stealthy, nothing gets done or in a awful pace which favours the killer immensely. Plus when i play killer i see this pattern everygame , stealthy players dont know how to loop, they are generally pretty bad at chases. Everyone in the team needs to be able to run the killer around, for at least a little bit while others work on progression. Also a overlooked aspect of playing stealthy, if you unhook someone and go stealthy, you are basicly leaving the unhooked survivor left for tunneling, which hurts the team overall for logic reasons. You do need to take the heat more often than not, thats how it works,  in no way shape or form is stealth a viable option for being optimal as a team, something you will need to be to suceed against high level opposition.

People like this crack me up. They don‚Äôt even understand the basics of the game but still whine and bitch. My favorite is when survivors say ‚Äúnice lag switch‚Äù whenever I play spirit. They are so dense.

There‚Äôs a Claudette in the image?
---
&gt;I think you didn't get what I was trying to say. Balance shouldn't be towards anything. Otherwise it isn't balanced, it's just more challenging for survivors at red ranks to give the illusion of balance to higher rank killers playing against optimal survivors.
---
What..
---
Shouldn't be towards anything? That's really dumb sorry. You always have to balance towards something, otherwise is called chaos not balance
---
&gt;That would only mean that the game is in fact extremely unbalanced at any rank other than red ranks and everyone that isn't already in red ranks will be forced to play an unbalanced game. I'd agree that balancing has to be done so gameplay at red ranks isn't incredibly one sided, but making the game harder for survivors and leaving all the less optimal players in the dust probably isn't the solution.
---
What? I really don't understand you or maybe you misunderstood me. Balance should be towards better players. Let's take an easy example or you might miss the point again.
---
Let's take.. a moba since it's pretty popular these days. Hero A is an easy fella to play, you can play it decently at any rank. But, the higher you go, less mistakes and more experience of the game you need to make it work. It's easy to pick as as well to find it's weaknesses in higher ranks, so it should be balanced towards those higher ones. Making it's flaws more readable or the strengths less prominent.
---
It's the same thing here. Things, as maps, killers and so on, should be balanced towards high ranks. So, higher ranked players can't abuse something that has little to no flaws that was designed for newer players. We saw this several times, like the stupid vault change (mid vault) so they won't make as many map changes as they should. Or just the old DS that was broken beyond repair
---
Balance towards high ranks means having the same opportunities in both sides in a fair plain field to outsmart the opponent. Low ranks or who play casually won't even notice changes that are towards those players in the first place. I have countless example for that, just play any pvp game in existence
---
&gt;Just thought of something though, how about gen timings scaled toward accumulative player ranks?
---
So high rank players would have gens that take longer to complete while lower ranks would have gens that finish faster? With rank 20 being the lowest possible rank with the current gen timing so even if you derank yourself to rank 20, playing with other rank 20s with the current time it takes to repair gens would still be a challenge?
---
Who the hell is talking about that?
---
I said it before that I wasn't defending the idea because more time in a gen is just stupid and even more stupid make gen time rank dependent since would encourage depips.. 
---
They should just fix the maps and give a secondary objective that isn't just "hold a button for x time". That's boring
---
Something that you have to do like "take item x and put it in place y" would be way more intriguing. I just made it up so isn't even that hard to think about something especially if you're paid to do so (devs)
---
This is just for surveys, oddly enough the ST chapter didn't get a survey
---
I REALLY WANT THIS :(
---
This is completely fine. You can hit over vaults and fences if the sirv is right next to it like you are at the end of a vault.
---
High level play has very little stealth play.
---
In case anyone is wondering [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaRLW4ZS4Jk) is a link to the music by Jon Rob. It's an amazing piece of work.
---
hey, just wondering if you could make the "action" one? you know, the picking up of the survivor?
---
That got me ü§£
---
If you admit it's an asshole move, than you admit that the survivor shouldn't give a shit about whether or not you get the achievement. "Let me ruin your game so I dont have to ruin the games of others," isnt exactly an endearing argument.

I think you misunderstood. In the server survey, they ask you which killer you played since 2nd October. But the Demogorgon is missing as an option.

That reminds me of a friendly Michael I had a few days ago who let me and another escape after our teammates died super early. After knocking open the gate he moonwalked back and forth across the entrance. Good guy.

Ah yea, finally a balanced map.

You hit them by an inch and they'll act like your arm stretched across the map for it.
---
Please tell me you killed the Moira main first
---
What the heck is a Moira main my guy
---
What are you on about? Nobody mentioned borrowed time, it has nothing to do with going straight back to the hook where the survivor was saved. Stop creating imaginary scenarios in a poor attempt to win an argument. 
---
I‚Äôll lay it out for you simply since you‚Äôre have a hard time comprehending what I‚Äôm saying:
---
Survivor A is hooked, killer goes patrolling, not camping
---
Survivor B, C and D are working on separate gens. 
---
Survivor B goes for the save. Killer is at a random gen, could even be one that a survivor was working on
---
Killer immediately abandons any pressure/chase and goes for survivor A
---
Survivor B either heals survivor A or goes back to the gen they were on
---
Survivor B, C and D are working undisturbed while the killer finds, downs (possibly downs again because of DS) survivor A. 
---
Rinse and repeat until everybody just wants the time pass simulator of a game to be over. It quite clearly isn‚Äôt the correct play and good survivors will not let you get more than 2k for it. Was that simple enough for you there sport?
---
I saw this earlier as it was recommended to me. I hope they get hired!
---
You survivors disgust me. no mattwr what we do "you camped" "tunneling" how about this get good at the game or deal with it your legit garbage anyone complaining you are bad at the game! just face it you suck even when there's no camping i get a "oh ur tunelling" NO! you just suck! mf ima throw my hatchet at you if you limpin tf you think this is a charity? of course ima hit you and not your friend in full sprint ima deal with you first cause your a problem they saved you so lets see how valuable you really are now
---
so who's gonna tell him?
---
That is straight up amazing!
---
That's cool af üëç
---
Franklins tho
---
Congrats! I‚Äôm so close to reaching rank 7
---
Last time I got called a hacker was when I was playing Omega nurse with BBQ so a hook just meant "FRESH MEAT"
---
don't have that perk yet.
---
Honestly this one is not that bad. If you pause when he hit you, the chainsaw is really close to you.  
---
It's also not a hitbox issue in this case but latency. The killer is actually closer than what's displayed on your end.
---
I forget what movie this is from but 1. It‚Äôs worthless and 2. I think it gets stepped on and killed lol.
---
I have like two perks bruh it‚Äôs just the grind
---
Teach me the ways of he pallet
---
I understand why tunneling in some situations might be good (usually only when someone just got unhooked and without a pallet), but I just don't do it as a killer out of pity. People don't choose to get unhooked, so when a survivor gets unhooked by some idiot right behind you, I focus on that idiot to make sure he is the first one dead. I only tunnel when there aren't many gens left.   
---
Guess it's just a matter of wanting to be nice. Genrushing however isn't a thing though. A killer has the option to not tunnel, survivors don't have the option to not do gens.
---
Thanks!! You‚Äôll get there! Every time I finally get to a low rank, rank reset fucks me lol
---
Plague is so underrated... the only weak killers that can be fun bc of how weak he is, especially at red ranks, is wraith, clown or doctor.
---
That last one is funny as fuck though
---
Cause I had no other choice? It was an unsafe pallet or going down. If he decides not to break the pallet and just hold W there's nothing I can do. That's not me being out skilled or making a mistake, that's the game holding the killers hand by saying "It's okay, just hold W and eventually you'll catch him.
---
Oh yeah, just run away from the pallet and get downed cause he's got bloodlust 3 4Head

Scroll down on your steam profile after turning public comments on.
---
Nice! I‚Äôm trying adept LF but I just can‚Äôt ... lol
---
It's BOB from creepshow ep2
---
Oh my favorite mistake, the ebony moris
---
Ig I rly am special for liking to play against nurse mainly bc the actual good nurse players are rare af so breaking LOS usually ends up working easily
---
You can see other peoples prestiges now? I thought that was removed like a year ago unless it's a SWF thing.
---
Yea sorry for spoiling btw, didn't know there was a tag for it
---
Like, I just feel like I'm going crazy here, I legit just wanna have a fun time, I don't really care if I win or lose, I don't play this game for that. But it's awful when you have someone who just wants to play for fun constantly get matched with insanely try-hard people, I just had a game where it was doctor on gideons and he slugged me 3 times and then said he had to do that so I "looked decent" granted he had the obsession perk that transfers their radius to me, that's not what bothers me though.  I should also say, I'm not bashing on try-hards, i get it, we all have those games we wanna get godlike at. I just don't wanna get constantly matched with them since it's not fun for either side
---
Same, if i see 2+ toolboxes i just take no addons and no offering so they lose whatever offering they bring when i dc :)
---
Doc legion Freddy for me is S tier lol
---
There have been plenty of times where I‚Äôve had zero reason to check a locker and had it pay off. There have been many, many more where it hasn‚Äôt, but they probably don‚Äôt consider that when I‚Äôm dragging their asses out to the hook.
---
I just got done with that episode and my god what a huge leap in quality from ep1 to ep2.
---
No I feel you man I'm mainly a killer main and there are games I can tell "that guy doesn't belong in this rank" it's dumb but at least BHVR made it harder for survivors to maintain their rank not that it rly does much
---
hah whenever my mom sees me play DbD she tells me to think about my own sanity
---
[When your fellow survivors want to know what you were doing while they all died, but you were sitting on top of the hatch. ](https://i.imgur.com/CPX6Aq8.png)
---
Legion got nerfed pretty badly. But he is still a good alternative to the base "loop, throw pallet, repeat"
---
then stop complaining about NOED. You are doing that to yourself.
---
Your trap.. It wasn't even activated..
---
How do you know he isn't human or at least dog sized
---
This is a very specific but very relatable post and I love it
---
Dude I think you just don't get it
---
I'll make it very simple. Survivors keeps the items if they survive and can also bring new items from the trial without spending a single bp. I kept my med kit for several trials and don't need more BP to get more, just find one into the game
---
On the other hand Killers always consume add ons. No matter what. If they use it, if they kill everyone or nobody doesn't matter, the add on is consumed. 
---
That's why killer get more BP. The End
---
activating Mom and still doing 5 gens ? No, i don't think i will
---
He would become obsessed with one survivor and then kill all of the other ones. He would bring the obsession the other‚Äôs dead body parts.
---
Seriously, don‚Äôt ever hurt that woman in anyway. Precious.
---
If Ash is the killer, who are the survivors?
---
I know I choked and just decided to be on the safe side just in case I didn't make it to the end of the exit and I almost died for it as you can see haha. But its not a big deal I have like 30 instaheals anyways.
---
And not gonna lie... I have like five images of Meg using a flashlight with a face of peeing herself or so.
---
I really only started seeing that mainly at red ranks, maybe it's region dependent. Purple ranks honestly felt like a really good sweet spot for both sides imo
---
So cute! The hag looks adorable!
---
Agreed
---
Stopped reading at "average 50 second chase"
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been having this problem
---
This is why u use a mask on Meg
---
Rule of sarcasm on the internet
---
Sticker for my car! I never had a sticker and I would be proud this being my first.
---
I remember I once showed my mum a ghostface mask and she said not to show her such horrid things at night. It wasn‚Äôt even covered in blood or anything it was just a standard plastic mask.
---
Demogorgons can also place portals near windows making it impossible to get a fast vault.
---
Is this when Michael gives oscar the doll or when he kicks the ladder from under Daryl?
---
Oh that‚Äôs why they want to get hit all the time when I am dealing with other survivors. Mystery no longer
---
I can't even open anything, every option is closed, if I try to cancel the "searching match" it won't let me.
---
What the hell you got a good mum
---
I personally call it, meg and claudette had a role reversal, meg being a nerdy girl becoming a jock and claudette being more free spirit into becoming the nerdy girl
---
Another example of Keem being retarded
---
All animations that were made when the game first came out look kind of weird when you look too closely. 
---
Dbd has come far, but its animations could use some work 
---
(Some of them are great though)
---
Sounds like a normal ranking game to me
---
Wait is quintins chin pointing straight fuckin forwards lol. 
---
Not hating it just that looks wrong and it gave me a laugh. 
---
So 10/10 perfection!
---
Easy, FLYING TO AUSTIN FUCKING TEXAS
---
Basically what you want to do is level up the killer you want to use the most in order to get add ons and perks in his/her loadout. You should spend bloodpoints on other killers that you are less interested in only if you want a certain perk exclusive to them on your main killer. As for survivors you should level up the one that you like the most keeping in mind that, as for killers, you will have to spend bloodpoints on survivors that you may not use just for their perks (Decisive Strike on Laurie Strode (DLC), Borrowed Time on Bill, Adrenaline on Meg, Dead Hard on David, those are the main ones you want)
---
You instant dc against huntress? What if you get her in an indoor map?
---
Yes i draw weird chins üòÇ
---
I disagree I feel the finger was the best segment yet, the werewolf shenanigans was a bit bland but the effects fun.
---
Also nerf Pig while you're at it
---
This got really real, really fast
---
So it‚Äôs normal for purple killer to get matched with red ranks? Then that‚Äôs stupid.
---
It's needless communication that would only serve to breed toxicity
---
On the 13th of every month your rank gets reset. It means that depending on your current season's rank you will be placed in another rank to start the new season from that point on. The higher your rank is (closer to rank 1) the higher you will be placed rank wise (if you are rank 1 you will get rank 10 for example)
---
It's literally from a creepshow episode which premiered today, in which it's harmed in no way.
---
ep 1 was fantastic, from the acting to the effects. ep 2 "Bad Wolf Down" was a huge dip in quality imo, but I enjoyed it for the cheese factor. The Finger was a big comeback, the effects were very endearing and charming, TJ did a great job acting, and I can't love Bob enough
---
No? Its either play with those or dont play at all.
---
Yes it would benefit greatly as long there is a reason to play ranked
---
Ah the rare mother who understands online games cannot be paused
---
(We don't talk about the new Twilight Zone)
---
he is 48 years old
---
She‚Äôs doing Blue Steel!
---
White/frat boy meme.
---
Isn‚Äòt the escaperate for rank 20 &lt; 40%? Technically he is right
---
Ohhhh gotcha thank you :)
---
Shit is it bad? I thought Jordan Peele was game enough to make it good
---
Sure you right. But its not always swf. As a killer i normally check profiles to see if i got swf in my lobby sometimes its obvious and sometimes you got 4 people from the same country so its clear.
---
if it can reassure, once you reach red rank, almost everyone will really appreciate you using the perk.
---
You say there is no big difference between rank 6-1 survivors, but then I get lobby full of rank 2 survivors, they loop like 10 times better then purple rank survivors so idk.
---
Nah, he is very overrated imo but even regardless of your thoughts on him, you can NEVER replace Rod Serling no matter how hard you try. Twilight Zone was a perfect show, and should be respected by leaving it be.
---
Doesn't need to be 4 people but hey why care low ranks just equal easier games thanks BHVR for making this new system that also sucks
---
Yes and No. As someone else said, currently your rank doesnt matter. That means most players would only play casual.
---
The other big issue is that it would split the community even more. While the game has definetly grown in popularity over the past couple years, I dont think it's quite big enough for 2 game modes yet
---
thanks for the advice. this is the kind of shit i was looking for
---
Yeah I had the same reaction. Tbh I didn‚Äôt even like the finger that much, but I can definitely see why some would.
---
I mean, we already have a Huntress...
---
Yes
---
Oh shit I completely forgot lol. Well then I would need change the name
---
She looks like the L4D2 Spitter
---
Then you prob just unlucky i have so many matches with different rank 3 - 1 survivors in my team acting so bad you wouldnt believe. At the end of day you rly cant tell a players skilllevel by his rank
---
Probably, yeah. But cool concept!
---
His name is Lucky Luciano, and the meme is "I had to do it to 'em"
---
Word bru
---
I have a bit over 400 hours but I hardly take it seriously, so I almost never even hit rank 11 because I always save people over myself and get left behind :P
---
But that's rank 20. The lowest rank.
---
Except No0b3 disagrees with him
---
Suck shit dickhead. I've been blocked like that before.
---
This used to happen once every now and against higher latency killers but now its happening constantly with these servers, at first I thought maybe it was my timing that was off but i tested it when not being chased and theres a 1-2 second delay on it for me.
---
Yes, specially the standing still animation, sure it's shows that the chatacter is alert and scared but it could have more personality to it
---
Number one mom over there
---
Are we just gunna ignore the fact that you LEVITATED out of his arms?!?
---
Wait you can open a closed hatch?
---
Uh huh. Interesting placement for my wife.
---
Nope unranked mode is called more complain mode. 
---
Alright I‚Äôve said a lot about this subject in the path and insulted people‚Äôs intelligence but I‚Äôm tired lol. 
---
Basically the problem is ranks not being a thing 100% of the time. It will be more of a problem then it is right now. There will also be more complaining about it.
---
Nah. Rank is useless for anything other than a visible form of sbmm. Even if it didnt exist in game, the queue system would either not have sbmm, meaning baby survs getting p3 omega blink nurses, and baby wraiths getting bullied by a flashlight squadette, or it would have sbmm, and therefore be marginally better if not identical to ranked. There also is currently no reward for high ranks.
---
Constipation
---
Oh really? How come I was closer to the window than the chest yet it kept happening? Because the chest input radius is bigger than vaulting, which is bad. Real bad.
---
Not once did I focus on the chest, at least intentionally. Not only that, but any time I was directly moving to the window to vault, my character turned around to open chest instead
---
EVEN WHEN IT SAID ‚ÄúRB Vault‚Äù ON THE DAMN SCREEN IT STILL MADE ME OPEN THE DAMN CHEST!
---
In what way?
---
If we could get custom chase music for everyone that'd be groooovy
---
Thing is I would never bring that perk. It seems so situational that you wouldn‚Äôt need to use it.
---
I hate the queue times, but it‚Äôs really nice not to be hit through pallets when I have green ping.
---
There are way more red rank survivors than killers on EU PS4 in my experience. Even so the rank difference between 2 and 6 isn‚Äôt that big. I think Behaviour recently said that their system will try to match people within 6 ranks of each other.
---
I like the artistic approach it took to its story telling, and Bob was cute in a gremlins kind of way
---
BHVR this time be like:
---
wdym nerf, lets just remove it lmao
---
Gonna be honest, I do that
---
This is because I suck at keyboard and mouse to the point that I can‚Äôt even play with it.
---
They photoshopped the eyes smaller
---
When you say ‚Äúthis is a sarcastic joke‚Äù it kind of takes away from the joke itself
---
You‚Äôre still not reading what I (among others) are pointing out. *It is required to get the achievement*. Once it‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs out of the way and never has to be done again. 
---
Do you get an achievement for ‚Äúbeing sacrificed instead of Killed by a tombstone Myers‚Äù? If you did, i‚Äôd completely understand your argument. But instead you‚Äôre being selfish, not only to the Killer but to every other player who gets caught up because of your actions. You‚Äôre being even more of an asshole than the Killer, period.
---
Sloppy butcher self-care is 40 seconds, that's half of a generator. Instead of sitting in one spot and being a deadweight for my team, I'd rather make myself useful. I can get healed when I run into a teammate/I can run iron will or adrenaline.
---
I've had tons of games where I got chased a lot and didn't need to heal all game, it's really just dependant on how confident you are. If nobody is healing and just focusing on gens, the game will be very short anyway.
---
&gt;If you dont heal and get downed before 32 seconds, you just went down and helped the killer snowball.
---
You are helping the killer snowball by sitting in one place and sucking your thumb for 32/40 seconds, you might as well not be in the match when you're doing that. You know how much map pressure that is?
---
&gt;Especially if youre a good looper and know how to use windows
---
If you are that then you don't need an extra health state.
---
You guys are rare. Last couple of weeks i have seen only handful of Quentin's.
---
for one brief moment, i believed your name was "Jewis"
---
this kind of player should be burned like a salem witch
---
Some of the newer animations are definitely more polished, Demogorgon slithering through a window for example is really well done.
---
Tell me about it, I barely see anyone play as Quentin. I don't blame them, his in game model is a little creepy looking üòÇ
---
It was some damn good practical effects. I probably would have liked it more if the 4th wall wasn‚Äôt broken as often as it was.
---
I still disagree, but to each their own
---
So did you win? Or.....?
---
the number of times ive had to explain to people that ravens appear over lockers if you sit in there for these insane amounts of time are absurd.   
---
"hmm.... where could he be... Oh look, this locker next to hatch has an entire murder of crows sitting on it and cawing constantly"
---
Honestly want to try it cause I‚Äôm ass and can‚Äôt loop or mid game so I‚Äôd rather hide XD
---
Its so accurate it hurts  üòÇ  üòÇ  üòÇ
---
This has 0 to do with DBD.

Your comment, unnecessary it is.
---
They‚Äôre down voting you for having common sense. Well said my man.
---
Yeah no, Keemstar dosent deserve the platform he has, his opinion means less than the worms in the dirt.
---
Do people wanna see Rick get morried tho? I‚Äôd say negan for sure
---
Tunnelling gets thrown around a ton when survivors decide to get salty. Like, no, you messed up several times and clearly didn‚Äôt even try hiding when I got close, it‚Äôs not my fault you stick out like a sore thumb and can‚Äôt loop properly.
---
Loving that pride flag!
---
It's better to use Pop instead of Lullaby
---
I shared your mentality when I started playing but just keep practising. Watching youtube videos helped me too. You'll get there eventually trust me.
---
And then when you do it again and get them to the hatch but they insult you and claim gg EZ in end game chat/xbox messages.
---
technically, an understatement.
---
"still good" refers to it being good before
---
it was broken before.
---
It still wasted quite a bit of the killers time and left them open to being blinded or body blocked, and you'd never know if more than one person had it on besides the obsession so you'd likely get hit by it more than once
---
And newbies complaining since 1990 that they get destroyed by killers.
---
Just saw that the DBD team saw your work and got so excited, I really hope they add it into the game. Well done my man
---
Then take my updoot!
---
Ohh...
---
Wow a meme that I actually don‚Äôt have a problem with lol. Mostly because this one makes 100% sense.
---
This has to be one of the greates cakes I've ever seen and the fact that your mom made it for you because she knew you like a video game makes it even better. Your mom is obviously precious. Happy birthday, by the way!
---
I have it off, it caps at 100...
---
Just listen to it while he floats upward
---
Thank you \^\_\^
---
&lt;3
---
That's a very old repost tho.
---
I try it‚Äôs just so different to me since I play identity v on my phone the mechanics of getting away are so different I try to do some of the stuff from the other game and it just gets me killed lmao it doesn‚Äôt click in my head that I can loop certain spots over and over in the other game you have to keep moving or you die in this one you gotta like try to mindgame more and I have trouble getting fast vaults I usually get stuck then end up getting a slow vault then I get hit :/
---
The same I could say
---
This made me smile! Rarely smile online üòû.
---
Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
She don't need to understand her child to love him üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
After I just reached rank 1 in survivor for the first time now I can go on not caring too much about my rank. I'll play how I want, I'm sure I'll stay around red ranks so I'll still be paired with decent people.
---
Bro idk if it‚Äôs just me (I‚Äôm on console) but for whatever reason my eyes refuse to focus on a p3 claud I‚Äôll be on her ass then next thing poof
---
Chucky has the strength of a grown man. They would have to make another pick up and hook animation for Chuck since he's smaller than most of the killers.
---
Hemorrhage üÖ±Ô∏è
---
getting evil incarnate was the worst, i didn't have ruin on myers 'cause it never showed up, most of my tries i would lose the acchievement because instead of the kill, myers would lunge and normal hit the survs... it was really difficult but i managed to do it
---
I yelled out ‚ÄúWHO‚ÄôS THAT POK√âMON!‚Äù
---
Man that's some talent does she not work in like a bakery or something?!?!
---
Can we stop this bs where we don't acknowledge that camping and *tunneling* are legitimate problems in the game?
---
They hurt the game and are an asshole thing to do.
---
*by tunneling I am referring exclusively to when the killer ignores all other survivors who may be easier hits to go for the one who was just unhooked*
---
https://youtu.be/pauXWfWOP0U
---
This one has the standard song with a heavy duuun duuuun all the way through
---
 https://youtu.be/JMi0HrGFzKE
---
And this was has the standard song but a stinger playing through it
---
Answered my own question he has two versions now,
---
Not my videos credit goes to the uploader.
---
Any example you can send??
---
Oh, sorry. Apologies for that! &lt;3
---
You should post this in the bug report section on official forums, in case the devs aren't aware of it.
---
The devs keep coming up with ways to encourage people to cleanse the totems (increased bp reward, literally turning them into health packs with Nancy's perk, etc) and there are still people who complain about NOED.
---
Just updated the post take a look, thought the actual chase music takes place at the end of the clips
---
Not 5/7: no teabagging Claudette/Shadow-6, lacks *ReaLIsm*!
---
Just kidding.  That's incredibly thoughtful of her OP, and Happy Birthday!!!
---
Billy and Leatherface can't one shot down you from across the map. They can't chainsaw you once you've dropped a pallet and they have to charge and maneuver their ability. The fact that people don't complain about one-shot chainsaw on both of those characters proves the opposite of your point: Survivors don't care about one-shot abilities as long as it is in keeping with the mechanics of the game.
---
Yeah, I've noticed a real lack of effort in the memes lately. Just simple shit. At least it's not the Freddy on a train one.
---
I think all mum's try. It's not really fair to say that unless they do things like this, they don't try.
---
He's not wrong though.
---
The bottom is from the PTB. The top is the new version for live. Unless there‚Äôs genuinely 2? I thought the stinger was when he was very close but not in a full-on chase.
---
I used to do that but it got a annoying when id do it and all, even the guy i saved from getting hooked would complain to me about doing it because i was "wasting time" on it and it was stopping them from getting altruism so thats why if youre not in red ranks or in swf i dont recommend doing it unless you wanna get bi###ed at for helping your team in a different aspect
---
But I didn't say all mom's don't try...I just said this one did. Don't put words in my mouth.
---
It would be amazing to have different themes for all the different (non-licensed) killers. This track is really well done
---
While this is super super cool, can we chill with posting this?
---
I just try to get the highest rank out of my friends for bragging rights. Also yes I only excel at 2 because I don't practice with any of the other killers
---
pallets? no 
---
Making nurse have less overall ability to travel across the map in .5 seconds? Yes
---
Found the rank 20
---
I think it would be fine for PC/console crossplay since the only real advantage for M&amp;KB is on killer and killers don't compete with other killers.  There's nothing PC survivors can do against a PC Nurse that console survivors wouldn't be able to do just as well.  If PC Nurse is fair for PC survivors, then she's fair for console survivors as well.  If she's not fair, then that's a balance issue with the game but not an issue with crossplay itself.
---
It'd be cool if we got cosmetics for finishing a season with a purple or red rank
---
When something doesn't go my way? We DC as soon as one of us notice the killer is Spirit. We don't DC because the game isn't going our way. 
---
I don't complain about moris because we never play against it either. Camping, tunneling and slugging are easy to counter so we don't mind that. 
---
Like I said, we play against Nurse and Billy, characters that are equal or stronger than Spirit. The problem with Spirit is not the challenge (not that there is much), its the boredom of playing against a killer that you can't do much against, like old legion.
---
She does, but my wallet‚Äôs already looking very thin.
---
Love it.
---
But I'm stupid, and thought it said 'Jewis' for a seacond.
---
I absolutly hate playing against trapper. But I don't know why.
---
I thought it was a "different" answer...
---
In the worst case scenario they will think you're a bit weirder than they thought. in the best case scenario, you're already this weird so nothing really matters
---
I only use Myers on occasion but, I believe stalking wile in T3 slows down the rate of it being used wile still taking stalk from players/being able to see them highlighted. Tombstone allows you to kill survivors (which could be hiding) which if you were able to stalk and find someone in the grass, would be an instant kill. This definitely in NO way is an ‚Äúintended‚Äù effect... I got two Tier 3‚Äôs off of one stalk charge. There is no way in hell thats a thing as it never has been.
---
This is what people don‚Äôt understand. You see these perks almost EVERY.DAMN.GAME. 
---
How often do you actually run into a huntress like this, let alone one who can use it well? Suck it up, play the match, and move on... just like the majority of us do.
---
That hag in the front is everything
---
Oh wow... thx! :)
---
Fuck him and fuck one hit hatchets. These survivors are right in dcing against that kind of OP shit, same as prayer beads
---
Honestly if I gor a glass of chocolate milk irl for helping a Michael get evil incarnate I'd do it.
---
Thx you! U‚Äôll not believe, but the top was a lot of work... took me around two days to redesign the wolf ;x but I guess: worth it!
---
Lol could also be mask-meg
---
I need that too!! I‚Äôll add you. I‚Äôll be on most the day after 10am pacific time today
---
oh I'm sorry I didn't read the post correctly.
---
What I meant was a bit different. I was talking about being able to stalk a bit during T3 to have a bit there already once it ends
---
My mums reaction to me hooking a claudette was "he's not a very nice person." I don't think she realised I was the killer.
---
Iri hatchets don't ignore mechanics of the game, wtf...
---
Cuuuute~
---
Ikr, the one is so hard to see
---
I know, right, it's almost like you can't use windows, pallets or distance to evade the killer.
---
QQ
---
Explain...
---
I've seen that video before! The music is fantastic, and perfectly suits The Spirit. Judging my the positive comments surrounding Demogorgon's sound design, people really like unique chase music.   
---
Plague could have ominous gongs, babylonian whispers and wails. Legion could have some edgy teenager music blasting. Clown could have discordant/off carnival themes. There's so much room for creativity!
---
Surprised doc isn‚Äôt in S
---
Lol im still a beginner learning huntress and i thought rotten rields should be a good map because of theoretical easy shots to anywhere but after playing a few games on that map now im like "what does a survivor even look like??"
---
Every killer have been there...
---
you're gorgeous, keep rocking those cosplays!!
---
All i‚Äôm going to retort with is what a childish viewpoint. You do you, it‚Äôs not against the TOS so you are well within your right to do so. But so is every Killer who ruins games by slugging, SWF teams all using insta-heals and every player who goes out of their way to be an asshole. 
---
Sure, you can do it. But it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you could just play to have fun **with others** instead of being bitter.
---
No stalk doesn‚Äôt work like that. Anything ‚Äúearned‚Äù wile in Tier 3 doesn‚Äôt apply to your charge. If that was the case you‚Äôd be able to back to back T3 and would be far to strong.
---
Isnt that the point though lol? Why would you want a item that ends the game for yourself? Or a killer perk that lets the survivers live longer? I feel like the insta could use some form of nurf, BMP is fine though.
---
Entitled much lmfao
---
Bruh imagine watching someone get moried by the bloody deer monster in the middle of the carnival at Croatia Prenn. I‚Äôd gtfo while also somewhat laughing at the absurdity of that.
---
You did too well. ofc your fault.
---
lol please go outside dude
---
Fellow ace main
---
That's the only word you know of?
---
Congratz, getting close myself!
---
But that boy is WOKE
---
Happy IRL cake day!
---
Disagree, I do
---
I'd prefer shards or bloodpoints, honestly.  In this game Id be fine, but Ik from League it kinda sucks to be unable to get the rewards because you aren't good enough.  
---
Maybe something like Overwatch's reward system might work.  The higher you are, the more  "special currency" you get, which you can use to but golden guns, or in this case, maybe legacy skins or similar?
---
Are YOU KIDDING ME THIS IS SO GOOD I ALREADY LOVE YOUR MOM SHE IS  AN ARTIST .

Aww man is someone too bad survivor so he can edit a keemstar photo. Theres enough pallets almost 2 much if you and ypur team can lanage and save them
---
Your devotion 1 level 85 is this seriously your first time getting rank 5
---
Damn dude. Go hug your mom.
---
They are just doing it intentionally at this point. They know we're watching
---
Yet on the surviver side the objective gets done instantly by a quardinated team anyway. Yes the morie is OP im not denying that, but an item like that on surviver would make the game literally unwinnable for the killer.
---
Alright I'm not saying he's right, but also Keemstar is both a streamer and youtuber
---
This game gonna have Stranger Things, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream (sort of), Saw, Halloween, maybe Stephen King, and now maybe The Walking Dead? This shit is wild man.
---
Don't tell me your mom also plays DbD If not, I'm impressed that she knows all those details... I mean, she would have to make a fair amount of research.
---
Either way, that's awesome!!
---
Us feng mains appreciate it  üòä
---
If only Nea looked like this in game üòÇ
---
Happy 8th birthday Lewis :D
---
wait doesnt cum taste salty?
---
Oh shame on me for wanting to play a game. I sure should take that L
---
Good cosplay ngl
---
The art is actually alright though! Just keep drawing more and practice! 8/10
---
They also followed the maker of IT so who knows
---
If they bring TWD in...Michonne better be a survivor.
---
Keen star is just shit
---
&gt;racist
---
Keemstar is many things, an asshole, a cunt, a garden toy, speedy fucking Gonzalez, etc. etc.
---
 
---
 But outside of an instance a decade ago, he hasn't shown any care to what race you are, except some white girl jokes at dogfuckers
---
Killers definitely feel op for the first week or two you play as survivor
---
I legitimately thought it said 8 too, its okay bud
---
Trapper is so fat he can't fit in his own frame
---
You have an amazing mom. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
New players bitching about something? Very surprising
---
Happy eight birthday!

---
Ah thanks, I‚Äôll start doing that from now on instead of just working through it then.
---
Right because you can't make mistakes against nurse and spirit
---
For legion it's probably one of the susie or Joe cosmetics, or the individual Frank &amp; Juile ones.
---
I dont know why you guys have so much problems finding killer games, the maximum time i had to wait the last week was 1 minute. Usually its just a matter of seconds.
---
&gt;BC there really isn't a point to. You can still hold m1, but the gen won't progress. Some people want to click less, I think.
---
There is a point. If you continue to hold M1 during that time where you can't progress the generator, you can get another skill check which will regress it even further.
---
I love when they say tunneling when I'm trying to find survivors and I just so happen to keep finding the same guy. Like look I didn't WANT to find you again but here we are
---
He‚Äôs also just a whiny asshat in general so at least this is on brand for him.
---
I have a friend who runs it because he finds not running it too easy and not challenging enough. I don‚Äôt think people run it for a reward I think people just run it for fun.
---
When u hit a ruin skill check the gen stops getting progress meaning u can still get skill checks meaning u lose more progress so if u hit a good stop for a brief time and get back on
---
&gt;dogfuckers
---
Do you mean Furries or actual Dog Fuckers?  They aren't the same thing and Keemstar is a dumb piece of human garbage so he'd be the one to project that onto others.
---
Pepperidge farms also remembers the hooker you ran over last Christmas
---
To play as...its a tie between Hag and Plague. Idk I like saying, "Hello!" When they trip my traps for the Hag. And Plague because I like her chant when she gets corrupt. Plus throwing up on everything like I am in kid in the Exorcist is fun.
---
To play against...Nurse. Ok hear me out, I play on console (Ps4) so they arent that good. Its hilarious when they misjudge the blink and just zoom away when i am right in front of them. 
---
Pigs cool too.
---
you would know wouldnt you
---
It is an actual problem, mostly in low ranks. However this post was just referring to when bad survivors just say that the killer was tunneling when he really wasn't to compensate for their lack of skill
---
The best killer in the game is obviously nurse personally I like playing against nurse players bc only a rare amount of people are actually good at nurse
---
In which case you only live because the Nurse made mistakes.
---
Against trapper, cause I‚Äôm a baby survivor. 
---
As Freddy, cause he is my current main.
---
Inb4 the typical dumbass "but judging by your story, you fed the troll" comment.
---
A survivor complained that I was ‚Äúcamping my totem‚Äù (which was ruin) I didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing!
---
Inb4 they are following some looney toons account.
---
Idk about fun, but scariest is the demigorgon. I don‚Äôt get scared the way I do against it compared to other killers. Aside from maybe Michael.
---
Now kill the killer
---
O yea. You're the true large brain.
---
Even so at least I came out happy instead of frustratingly chasing around some cocky fuck lol. 
---
So even if someone wants to be a douche I‚Äôm still happy with my decision lol.
---
I'm not exactly certain what you're asking, but I just want to map specific actions to certain buttons.
---
The reason why I didn't stick with changing "secondary action" or "interaction" is because I didn't like how it affected certain actions and how those actions interfere with the sticks (thumb off camera or thumb off movement when not necessary).
---
Optimal gameplay is when you are allowed to do whatever you want comfortably. So BHVR should make it a priority for players to be able to map each function for themselves. For example, I very rarely use the "come with me" emote, that would be mapped to Select (if at all). Self-heal would be on Left-Dpad, heal others would be Down-Dpad, etc.
---
Fortnite has like 40 different functions, but they seem to make it work on console primarily because they opened up the control scheme tremendously and allows players to map their buttons so they know exactly what to do in regards to their controls. There's certainty that X will do X.
---
DBD console is not like that whatsoever because there are so many instances where your controls are uncertain. That shit can be infuriating (look at this rant for example) and makes the game look like shit.

This is the 1/100 games where adrenaline is useful
---
I can imagine! But definetly worth it, looks great.
---
Myers because when I‚Äôm playing as him it‚Äôs always fun to get a gen grab or to sneak up on a survivor! But when I‚Äôm against him that man still scares me!
---
People take this game too seriously and it's a cesspit of salt, so do what you gotta do.
---

I'm sure most mums do, but mine certainly doesn't. I've never had a custom birthday cake or anything unique done for my birthday lol

This is the wholesome content I like to see! Happy birthday to you!
---
r/fondonthate
---
I've had s pool mething similar to this I hooked someone and then ran off to check gens and then they got the unhook, I wasn't in a chase so I ran back (Billy BTW) and the unhooked charged me so I smaked her down and chases the other person cause DS was in the shrine at the time
---
&gt;I bet you're looking up my channel right now.
---
Me: Who are you again?
---
Yeah! That's why I beat my meat every day. This video game violence destroyed my sanity smh my head  üò§  üò§  üò§  üò§
---
When I was playing bubba to unlock bbq,  I had a map where three gens were near the killer shack and so was the basement. 4th gen was also not too far to patrol so I just let them finish 3 gen. After a long game all 4 survived, in end game chat one said I was camping, other said he means patroling gens to camping and thanked me for not camping when I hooked them in basement.
---
This cake is so cute!! You can tell a lot of work was put into this. Enjoy your cake and birthday! :)
---
That is actually the most awesome thing ever
---
Speaking of pallets, the new map has way too many.  It seems like every room and hallway had one.
---
People take this game far too serious, it's fun to go against different stuff whether its op or not, I enjoy the challenge of trying to adapt as a survivor 
---
Same goes for when I play killer against a swf group or whatever. 
---
Its boring just going through the motions game after game
---
Yeah that's my go to as well
---
Yep, been also having the similar issue for last week or so. Except, when you re-roll the daily, close the daily missions interface and when you re-open it again the daily challenge would be something different than the re-roll you got.
---
Being called a hacker for having wall hack while I was using Bitter Murmur is one of the funniest things I have ever read about me. Or when someone calls me camper and says to go play Battlefield is fun too.
---
That's so sweet! Does she play too, or does she know what stuff looks like since you play?
---
What'd he say
---
As a huntress main I must upvote.  I dont even go for Iri heads in the blood web anymore, it's just a DC magnet.
---
It takes 33 seconds to finish a gen with 3 people working on it. Now add toolbox and perks for an even bigger reduction in time. How exactly is +5% speed supposed to help killers with no inherent pressure?
---
lewis
---
Glad to know I'm not alone
---
To be fair I don't blame them. I would also be salty if my only purpose in life was to fly up and down.
---
You can, since the last chapter's release I think
---
You right though, he fits the theme even if his movie isn't called Halloween.
---
Wow happy 8th birthday mate!!
---
The kind of person who plays Dwight in my games.
---
She‚Äôs the best :)
---
I'd love to but I haven't leveled him at all so he's worthless right now
---
Are you by chance, an inventor? Or maybe a bowler hat guy chases you around once in a while because you‚Äôre really good at making time machines?
---
Yes. Self Care comes in real handy against NOED.
---
*Sweet home Alabama intensifies*
---
Yeah man, i love all my memories of getting screamed at and grounded, hit, and then mocked and laughed at if i ever cried or complained.
---
That's amazing indeed !  Let them know again and again !  Haha
---
I didn‚Äôt know today is Opposite Day
---
Had roommate trying to talk to me during a game as killer.
---
It‚Äôs just a joke/challenge I believe
---
I love the console.
---
I think she ran out of time to make her a proper body, but it looks like she‚Äôs lounging in the ground XD
---
Thanks :)
---
Aww thats cute of her, happy birthday! Its also my mums birthday ! XD
---
Lol, it does say 18 but it‚Äôs hard to see :)
---
I‚Äôm a killer main, and I don‚Äôt agree with this. If you guard them while they are on hook they essentially have no chance to escape and have fun... I don‚Äôt care about tunneling as much
---
Blinded by Daylight
---
that does make sense cause the killers ping is zero cause hes host
---
Thank you very much :)
---
Oh no, that's just an example. She's told me again and again how much she wishes she hadn't given birth to me.
---
Mate, grabeddd from hereeeeeeeeeeeee......
---
üëç
---
You can do that, I'll just use the leave button real quick. The problem is not defeating her, is the fact that even when you do, the game was boring or annoying.
---
The genuinely made me laugh.
---
salty much
---
Cheers :)
---
Fits Keemstars personality perfectly
---
Dedicated servers will make the killer connect to a server, that server is the host
---
Mine was for hookin a rank survivor as huntress, for some reason i was a camper and tunneler when he quited past 2 minutes of the game.
---
Also a lot of peopoe desired me to die of cancer for just playing
---
Me whenever I play cause I‚Äôm shitty. It makes you feel better tho.
---
Not even close glad I found you because I too feared I was alone.
---
Por favor xDD
---
Ace is god tier you ignorant fool
---
Lmao so true
---
are they still testing it on pc? im sure they are planning on doing that once they release
---
I thought it said 8 lol. She did a great job!
---
Yup us PC players are lab rats for dedicated servers rn
---
Things aren't looking good... 
---
Thank god for this live test, it is showcasing bugs with almost every killer and the improvements for survivors aren't quite there apart from completely getting rid of lag switching and bad connection from the killer. 
---
At first we thought only Huntress would receive the hardest hit but now, seeing servers literally on a daily basis and normal gameplay, the tables have turned. 
---
I won't be surprised if they end up giving up on servers.
---
bingo
---
lmao ppl use mom?
---
Addons aren‚Äôt consumed in kill your friends. And you can use addons you don‚Äôt have access to.

Are there pics for it online cus I've been looking it up and can't find shit
---
When I was rank 13 killer (the day before yesterday) 9 rank survivor said that he has only 300 hours in this game and he already has better rank than me. I had 250 hours and played as a killer for the second day

He corn doesn‚Äôt me unless I‚Äôm laggy as fuck

I definitely will, thanks to all you guys that upvoted &lt;3

Well she actually is. She still survived after all the nerfs
---
That's the problem with survivors no idea what's important in the actual game. You just run around and don't realise what impact your actions have. NOED reduces time to down people those other perks increase it. When you're playing as killer every second is important and every second spent chasing someone is a second spent by the others doing objectives. If you can't see the game that easy then you'll never understand balance.
---
I know, it took her ages to do :)
---
Thank you thank you
---
Ok I guess I should have worded it kind of differently, what I kinda meant is that there must have been a certain follow up of events that caused the killer to be able to bloodlust you there, I mean we get little context when you mention only an unsafe pallet, the map it was on and A killer. Can you specify or is that too much too ask in this meme thread.
---
* Screenshots highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
Thank you, happy birthday to her too :D
---
I like how even though no0b3 is a survivor main he at least acknowledges that most killers are way the fuck underpowered rather than jumping on the bandwagon of nerf all killers.
---
Welp, at least I'm not the one who DC anytime something I don't like happens
---
Only snowflakes do that
---
Survivors don't understand that the most precious resource a killer has is time, and the more of it they waste the harder it is for the killer. NOED just gives the killer more time at the end of the game is all.
---
As a Huntress main can confirm that I've been feeling no change with her power in particular
---
Well if they are disturbed like 20 or more meters away from you it's definitely worth checking out
---
oh no
---
Anyone going to mention how he‚Äôs too young to be on the open internet such as reddit? /r/gonewild /r/yiff /r/inflation /r/gore
---
Thx
---
nah but if you play nurse and spirit perfectly you have little chance of failure in comparison to lets say a myers or (imma get real low with ya here) a wraith.
---
What's looping
---
NOED reduces a chase by half though. Other than decisive strike which you could mess up the skill check with, survivors don't have anything that powerful.
---
It says 18 but it‚Äôs really hard to see
---
I'd be very happy with just one survivor/killer crossover, but if it ever happens, it's unlikely to be a licensed character like Amanda. 
---
Someone like Susie would have worked when she was released, but now the community hates Legion
---
&gt;When something doesn't go my way? We DC as soon as one of us notice the killer is Spirit. We don't DC because the game isn't going our way. 
---
It's exactly the reason why. Nice contradiction. I wonder how many others contractions you hold in your tiny brain and force yourself to not realize
---
&gt;I don't complain about moris because we never play against it either. Camping, tunneling and slugging are easy to counter so we don't mind that. 
---
Ohh again contradicting your very first point. Good job
---
&gt;Like I said, we play against Nurse and Billy, characters that are equal or stronger than Spirit. The problem with Spirit is not the challenge (not that there is much), its the boredom of playing against a killer that you can't do much against, like old legion.
---
Just because you won't adapt which means "not going your way", so you DC. Pretty sad tbh
---
Maybe one day you will grow a thicker skin and being able to not contradict yourself several time in just one comment
---
Playing devils advocate...
---
This type of survivor is the least enjoyable to play against as killer.  Going against a survivor who you never find is annoying and boring.  You also miss out on a stack of BBQ/hook points/ect.  Contrary to popular belief, you earned red rank and shouldn‚Äôt be playing against killers who can‚Äôt find you.  
---
What I recommend is spending a few nights doing nothing but engaging the killer.  Make builds that extend chases.  Exhaustion perk, quick and quiet, dance with me, d-strike, there‚Äôs a lot of ways to go.  I highly recommend windows of opportunity.  It will be huge for someone who isn‚Äôt great at looping.  Go into matches with no expectations but to practice chases.  If you die and de-pip...good.  It‚Äôs a win win.  What you might notice is that you can earn as much BP in quick aggressive games as you can in long games where you‚Äôre never found.
---
I played the same way as you for the first year.  I was a Blendette.  I ran into the same problem and stopped playing every month once I hit high purple.  Overtime I went from a 100% (stealth) survivor main to 75% (friendly) killer, 25% aggressive survivor main.  Some days I just want to chill and do gens, but it‚Äôs fun mixing it up.  
---
If you‚Äôre really having a bad time at the end of the month in red ranks...dare I say...go play killer.  Be a friendly killer.  Focus on hooks, hits and bloodpoints.  You earn a ton as killer.  Don‚Äôt get caught up on kills.  The fun is in the chases.  As a bonus, you know you‚Äôre giving the survivors a decent experience by letting them survive.
---
Remember if you escape, that‚Äôs great.  If you de-pip, that‚Äôs also great.
---
NOED reduces a chase by half though. Other than decisive strike which you can only use once and could mess up the skill check with, survivors don't have anything that powerful.
---
coming back at this thread bc i need to know his instagram
---
Yeah, but the thing is, a parent/sibling *should* be concerned if they see an almost-naked lady on their teenage brother/son‚Äôs monitor. It‚Äôs not a matter of it being weird. It‚Äôs a matter of it being the fact that, well, she‚Äôs almost completely naked. They might think It‚Äôs porn or something.
---
Nurse on console is a lot harder, while pc nurses are basically god
---
Ogod. If you have the plague and the whole locker is like a neon green killllll meee
---
I don't get it, a good 4 survivor team can dominate nearly any killer.
---
sending a digital hug your way

Hello my fellow Quentin main, pleased to see you
---
This is fucking cool, your mum is the best
---
This is so dope
---
Your mom is better than my mom

Michael IS God.
---
How does the killers ping to the server effect your ping to the server and your ability to hit a dead hard. That‚Äôs a server issue. Not a killer ping issue. Killers aren‚Äôt hosts currently.. the server is.
---
You ruined your joke by not using the right name. My first thought wasn't "that was funny" or "good meme" but "those are Tyrannosaurus, not raptors"
---
You coulda just said "dinosaurs" and hide the fact how you literally don't have 1st grade level knowledge of dinosaurs. 
---
P.S. Dinosaurs were not "furry"  a lot of them had feathers or proto feathers which game them mold protection and a fuzzy look. A lot of them still have no evidence of having any coverings.
---

Dedicated servers are already live on PC.. what on earth do you mean by when they release it?
---
Bro this has been posted like 8 times can we please chill on this
---
Bruh this is amaizing
---
Agree on ever point.
---
Would also add more but would be just drops in the ocean
---
https://youtu.be/u2d91TliOys In this video at about 9.40 you can see her.
---
they are testing it live on pc for testing so it is not really fully released they are just working on bugs and etc
---
So many damn pallets...and they all suck.
---
It's kinda cool but what does it have to do with jewish
---
And people wonder why this community is toxic. Perfect example right here
---
Pleased to see you too fellow Quentin main!!
---
Mammels have fur. Dinosaurs weren't mammels.
---
.... Following that logic the game isn‚Äôt even fully released seeing as they‚Äôre still working out bugs.
---
Meh. They are just low rank
---
High ranks don't use noed for a reason.. for other reasons many use adrenaline tho
---
Carnotaurus had two short horns over the brow to resemble devil horn. It also had a short oval skull.
---
i feel bad for the demo
---
I dont play on console, Nurse PC is just too broken.
---
Maybe not an unranked mode. 
---
How about a random mode? Random map, random perks for both killer/survivors.
---
Or have a match theme every  week or two. It would allow people to try new perks and add an additional challenge of adapting to a playstyle you didn't choose.
---
Your mum after watching 2 matches: KILL THAT FUCKING CLAUDETTE.
---
Schrodinger's T.rex
---
sad Freddy noises
---
But the big word here is: Tunnel | you know?
---
‚ÄúHaha ruin crutch perk bro‚Äù
---
Lol ok mr. DC on your first hook
---
Ahahahaha
---
I guess although it is still not released on console cause again they are just testing it on pc in a live environment and I believe only turning them on at set times
---
Does he smell nice? Is his godly body real?
---
Probably to weird out the killer.
---
Huh, that's weird. Have you tried reporting it on their forums?
---
Yeah but that's simply because Baby Survivors can't even tell the difference between a safe and unsafe pallet.
---
It's like playing Pokemon against someone that literally doesnt know anything about type weaknesses lol.
---
Dude every single game in the history of ever has bugs and glitches
---
the song still plays when ur killer like how Micheal gets his music still
---
Nah gen rush exists
---
fair enough I guess
---
That‚Äôs my exact point! Smh
---
Yeah like I find killer so much easier.  I went from being a casual every couple of months player to owning all but two killers within the space of a month...  I still can't play survivor like as killer I understand that if I mess up it's my bad and I need to find a way to make up for it but as survivor other people rely on me
---
So no games have ever been released cool
---
There is no team do you think if there was a killer running about you would be worried about what the rest think of you I know what I'd be doin hiding in a locker fu guys I'm not gettin stabbed today lol
---
never heard a worse idea
---
old as in someone who was there in the beginning, not as in old i'm sorry matthieu
---
I'm a noob survivor but I will run behind injured survivors and take hits.  Yet I get consistently messaged cause I did a loop wrong.
---
Those are clearly not raptors. Pretty sure they are T-rexes.
---
According to the logic they were presenting and I was disagreeing with.. yes. Unless you totally missed the part where I was noting how absolutely ridiculous of a claim that is.
---
18, lol
---
It‚Äòs a Kitty Krueger
---
Fuck em they just salty its your game you paid for it
---
Really cool! Can you make dolls for other killers, like Myers and Trapper?
---
It's a fucking snitch
---
Did you watch the whole video?
---
I get that. I felt a need to be useful when I started playing, so I was always on gens and unhooking people (unsafely lol).
---
But I think the whole idea of "ruining people's games" should only apply to BM, if even that. Not lack of skill. The point in playing a game is for YOU to have fun. Just relax.
---
Also, lifehack: play Dwight, Dwight players get a free pass on potatoing.
---
Are u 8 years old?
---
Well when I posted I did not see any post about it before so I bet I was the first one
---
That would be me fam, I am the tunneling spirit
---
Or... just do gens.. and work together you will see killers aren't that tough...
---
i cant disagree
---
That‚Äôs really cool, happy birthday!
---
Your mom seems like an amazing woman.
---
oh this so nice and happy birthday. take good care of your mum yeah... have good day.
---
I main Dwight but I play like I'm a David main haha
---
I will thank you :)
---
I play as Nurse with Pumpkin Head. 
---
It is spooky but very hard.
---
I‚Äôm 18, it‚Äôs hard to see on the cake
---
100% agree with you. My friends are super casual they play like one night a month. I feel I can't play by myself anymore otherwise  I will ruin their experience
---
Depends how good both teams are and many other factors
---
Survivors spend every game doing skillchecks, which is why I consider skillcheck builds to be fundamentally flawed.
---
Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice, Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel. If you don't get them all during Haunted Ground then just 3-gen them until the hallucinations start appearing (T3 normally, T2 if you have a Restraint add-on).

She is and thanks :D

Me or everyone else?

Happy 12th birthday!
---
Cheers :D
---
Might point out the obvious, but IF there's some sort of imbalance involved, it's mostly about the Killer having too much.
---
There are two properties which are quite easy to recognize. Having both will most likely lead to the Killer being "Overpowered" :
---
* Does s/he have consistent, increased mobillity?
---
* Does s/he have increased lethallity as in a easier time downing Survivors?
---
Having both automatically leads to a very good default amount of Pressure, which also forces Survivors to play more cautious and thus less time efficient. Indirectly, just playing said Killer applies stall.
---
There's a reason why Nurse, Spirit and Billy are still the best Killers. Atleast we got rid of the old wind-up Huntress pretty fast. Would love to see Nurse and Billy being kicked from the top tho. Sure, Nurse breaks the game with her very abillity, but there's no doubt that Spirit and Billy are the 2nd and 3rd "best Killers".
---
To be honest I think they lack some sort of penalty or inconsistency. All 3 of 'em can roam extremely fast almost all the time they want to, with an exception for Billy who might get cucked by "The Game" or maybe even Yamaoka's.
---
I'm very aware of this being a shitpost, but to be honest, I can't imagine any Killer concept that does NOT yield a mix of lethallity and roam, but is still atleast just as viable as Spirit or Billy.
---
I think if you are a good enough nurse she always wins
---
:/
---
That's very true tbh. The map is one of the best vault maps.

Adrenaline is always useful if you let yourself stay Injured and do a gen instead of self caring every time you get hit.
---
You cause instead of just seeing the points you keep trying to justify yourself instead of sticking to your point and when you get downvoted you tell this community to ‚Äúgo fuck itself‚Äù. it‚Äôs that kind of behavior that this community is so hostile to one another
---
I googled it and I think it's happening to everyone on Switch. Levels and bloodpoints save though. Really weird.
---
It's reddit lol
---
His saw was so scary she just gave up .
---
He used the force.
---
Also the proof that this community is the saltiest of all I am currently banned from psn I have had the name ugotteabagged for years all of a sudden I play this game and somebody actually reported my username like how sad is that banned from PlayStation for a week bec of a username lmao so don't worry about what people think
---
Yes, it's the outfit he wears at the final of Season 3. There should've been a season 4 but the series got canceled.
---
I‚Äôm only here to say you should watch The Evil Dead Franchise and Ash Vs. Evil Dead. 
---
If you have Netflix Ash v Evil is on it.
---
you should sell these! they look amazing
---
the issue is not the dead hard activating but the killer‚Äôs lag making it so that i can‚Äôt time the m1 to dodge the hit because of HIS lag. sorry I didn‚Äôt explain that enough
---
Alrighty bud
---
And the vast majority of other streamers and youtubers who have more than 50 hours in the game.
---
I mean it looks like a giant ass head on a small body
---
sTeALtH bAD
---
Those stats have done more harm than good.
---
It takes a lot of knowledge to be good at survivor on dbd, and most of ya'll don't have it.
---
Pwyf makes her actually work lol.
---
I play on PSN and omg the salt is crazy.  Literally wiped a team in under 5 mins trying out wraith I had 2 perks and they said I was using crutch perks. Yeah no problem bloodhound is super OP
---
If I remember the stats correctly, hosting a killer lobby takes 60mb an hour roughly. That‚Äôs 16.66Kb per second. I‚Äôve hosted a killer lobby on a throttled 500kb upload download connection with a 60 ping to survivors and no disconnects. However IF you‚Äôre talking about console.. it‚Äôs because the consoles servers require data for their own system which bogs your connection down, it was never really the game. It‚Äôs shit like PS4 requiring a large chunk of your systems bandwidth to be dedicated to their own systems like inactive party chat or ‚Äúonline‚Äù data.
---
Oh.
---
Wait a bit, DBD usually has a steam sale for halloween and most dlc gets a good discount.
---
I am seeing the points though. There's been some helpful comments and some dam right piss taking ones.
---
A great example of "stop judging before you know someone's story". Foot in mouth disease.
---
Skelly hag it is, with voodooh-like paint resembling a skelleton
---
The problem with unsafe pallets is that they literally serve almost no purpose against good killers. Personally as a killer, I will literally leave these bad pallets up because it actually helps me to have them thrown down. You can't argue that something isn't too weak when a killer can use something intended for survivors to their own benefit.
---
I'm not saying all pallets need to be killer shack pallet good, but all pallets at a minimum need to be able to force a break rather then a doomed loop attempt.
---
You should do it!
---
Thanks Skemooo :D, appreciate your vids on YouTube btw
---
And a vast majority of *everyone*
---
Lmao I know I know why I was reported I was playing ghostface with blood warden and noed and I got a salt messege the next day I was banned lol love the game but community is toxic apart from a few decent people
---
Has everyone just forgotten that Keemstar is a piece of shit?
---
Damn
---
That sounds great! I might actually get paid early enough to get it! Thanks for the tip!
---
Is that what the escape cake offering looks line?
---
I can try, this is my second time making a doll. I was thinking about doing billy, but not too sure, i actually think myers will be easier actually. Im starting off doing the easier ones first to get the hang of it, but yeah ill try myers asap!
---
You know there's a button to reply to comments right? Cool cake, though.
---
Okay, just try not to be so hostile cause that only resorts to more hostility especially here on reddit
---
Aww thank you! I will! I have a craft IG if you wanna see what else i make, IG: coffeeandcraftsstore
---
Now **that's** spooky.
---
yo you're turning 8?!?!?!?!? congrats my guy
---
This is why I'm annoyed they actually lowered the DC penalty to 1 pip instead of 2. 
---
Lol
---
I just figured it out now oops, it‚Äôs my first post :). How do I edit my post title btw?
---
Dont be afraid to play surv, ignore teammates shittalking you, as long as youre not actively trying to ruin the game(disconnecting first down/hook, sandbagging etc) anything goes, you cannot be banned for being a noob.
---
My pro tip for Michael is to not screw around trying to get those long distance, spooky stalks around corners. Those are good for memes, but it's much more reliable and efficient to just chase somebody into a spot where they can't easily hide from you and get right in their face stalking.
---
I don't believe you can.
---
Chucky doll size will never make it. 
---
I can see a life size Chucky but others say nay it‚Äôs weird. 
---
Killers I want? Hellpriest(pinhead) and I will be complete.
---
You could definetly edit this one with a few MGS sounds and music.
---
I have not once as a killer ever considered that map OP. Yea it doesn't  really have many unsafe pallets (there is one that has a 50/50 spawn chance on the bus), but none of them besides the killer shack are insane.
---
the sushi and octopus are so cute! do you sell those? i‚Äôd buy
---
If the killer has a bad connection to the server, technically speaking you should almost always be able to have the advantage as they‚Äôre the one de-synced to the server and not you. I can‚Äôt imagine this even effecting you unless you‚Äôre trying to time a dead hard wile standing still and letting the killer try and attack you. Server takes priority, not the killer who‚Äôs behind on updates to the server due to a bad connection.
---
Yes i dooo! Send me a message and we'll set stuff up.
---
[Obligatory edit](https://i.imgur.com/itbIkYf.jpg)
---
Part of that was whoever owned it and the main man himself (Ash Williams actor which I‚Äôm forgetting his name)
---
agree but i digress when the killer is fuzzing around teleporting all over the place, its happened
---
Bro it's bbd, random shit like this always happens üòÜ
---
Hmmmm... I don't really think the devs would add him into the game, mainly because of like hes a doll lmao. But i think if something ever came up like a deal or anything with the parent company of chucky, then they would do somethin really interesting
---
wow
---
He could be the size of the pig. That wouldn't be too weird.
---
No, what hasn't been forgotten is that his POS-ness was greatly exaggerated by GradeAUnderA and Leafyishere for their own gain.
---
That's pretty much how it goes. Killers can have a hard time. But survivors can have a hard time too. And last time they release a graph, survivors didn't have the best of winrates.
---
And so Jake got tunneled
---
Anything not doll size is weird lol. By life size I meant any possible height that makes sense for the game.
---
Iridescents work too.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dd7pex/havent_played_in_a_while_come_on_for_a_game_to/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If you go down, the killer will snowball way easier. Of course, its not always the best option to self-care, but more often than not self-caring helps a lot.
---
You dont need a teammate, you dont need to go anyway. You can just do it on the spot.
---
If youre a good looper, you dont NEED the extra health state. But the extra health state means you will be able to extend it for over 40 seconds. 40 seconds you waste on the killer is way, WAY more impactful than one single survivor spending 40 seconds. Its a huge difference.
---
If youre not healed and you go down, youre working against your team.
---
Yes, sometimes theres only one/two gen/s left and you need to just finish them. But when you just get hit during a normal game and have to depend on a teammate to heal, then you can
---
a) not play unsafe, for rescues and gens
---
b) get downed right away (since if you want to do gens, its easy to get hit really soon in the chase
---
self-caring is good and will usually save your team from getting snowballed. You invest 40 seconds on yourself, one survivor, so you can get chased at least 40 seconds longer so 3 of your teammates have 40 seconds to do gens. You basically triple your investment. 
---
Not running self-care is sub-par. It has to be included in every good meta build. There is no good alternative, as of now.
---
We got clowns, pigs and ghost. Why not a doll?
---
I think so too. Chucky would bring something fresh to the game.
---
That sounds a lot more like sheer luck on their part, cuz like I said.. their timing in the game would always be delayed. Your update would always be ahead of theirs and they should never hit you at all. It‚Äôs the server, not them.
---
here or ig?
---
It's not even that the top-tier killers are imbalanced, a good team will still destroy them because of broken gen speed, it's just that they're super unfun to play against (Nurse and Spirit, that is, not Billy). The chase is the most fun part of the game, and they just get rid of that. I'd love to get a nerf to gen speed and **then** a nerf for Nurse, at the very least.
---
Yes but then again they're all human and human sized characters. Even pig is just a human in a mask. So I don't know
---
They could also make one for ghostface since they have the license for the mask, not the movies
---
Managed to temporarily unlock pig with the glass offering a buy MYC before they patch this bizarre bug
---
More unsafe pallets is much healthier map design and more fun for both sides than few super-safe ones.
---
If they unhook right in front of you the only reasons not to go for the unhooked person is Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time, honestly.
---
Whether or not you should return to a hook after the unhook alert can be a really complicated decision that would depend on that specific moment in that specific game.
---
You should get counseling for your "us vs them" mindset. Criticism of a group most often comes from within that group. With a better perspective, you'll be a lot happier and stop seeing enemies where none exist.
---

---
Yis.
---
Exactly! Now there‚Äôs never a chance lol. And evil Dead won‚Äôt be the same without Bruce Campbell and we can never have anyone else play Ash because it would be a completely fuckin different feel.
---
I mean in DbD EVERYTHING your opponent does feels op when you're a beginner, killer or surv. My first killer game was...not pretty.
---
that's normal
---
In that case burn the witch
---
Happy birthday man! Your mom is really talented. :)
---
Yes I was wondering how the shirt was created. Very nice work on it
---
amazing man! what a great mom
---
I think you could bring Chucky to the game with Tiffany helping him. Chucky could choke/steer the survivor directing them with say a yo-yo. The hooks are lowered and Chucky steers thr survivor till they impale themselves into the hook. Then Tiffany cranks them up to the normal height. 
---
Problem solved.
---
Having a tiny killer would be terrifying. I'm all for it.
---
I hope they add this as her chase theme
---
Happy birthday! I'd sell a kidney for a birthday cake like that
---
Have you tried the dedicated servers the last time they were on the PTB? If not: Trust me, it is better that they got delayed. The lag was just horrible. I rather wait a bit longer for the servers instead of getting them now and having the game unplayable till they fix it.
---
Fuck em, play it if you wanna play. I mean yeah bad players are slightly annoying sometimes, but you'll catch on quick. We were all new one point
---
I don‚Äôt see anything?
---
I hadn't actually thought of the 1st one like that.  It wouldn't make it fair if used with BBQ.  Darn.
---
The second one the range is dependant on level. 
---
The Hex obsession Perk basically means that you can rebuild the Hex you're obsessed with as long as survivors are cleansing totems.
---
Again, that last idea isn't an original idea.  I'd credit the original person if I knew who it was. I don't think it really increases Gen Repair speed too badly, and that person cannot work on other generators if that one is unfinished.  Indirectly, this means that if they don't finish it, they get no increase to their repair speed.
---
Thank you for your insight though.  I just wanted with the last two to have obsessions mean more than just killer/survivor.
---
you should feel bad for the 3rd guy, i dont think he/she survived, the killer was near to close the hatch
---
trapper, billy AND bubba fun to play against ? those are the most annoying imo
---
sometimes I play a killer I have hardly leveled up for a daily and get really frustrated and angry. But usually people don't teabag or BM and simply say gg at the end of the match, which really helps calm me down. It's just a videogame after all.
---
Well, they make some sense at least.
---
And as for Pig, we got killer in the Pig mask, not Billy doll how everyone was joking, so if Chucky will ever (which I greatly dought) be in DbD it would just be a human with a knife or whatever he used and doll would just serve some decorational purposes
---
Forgive me I had a brain fart. I can see what you mean, but I don't know how likely it would be that they'd do that.
---
oh, btw i see that p3 quentin, glad im not the only one :D
---
So no head?
---
This is why they SHOULD activate on exit gates. No timer, they slow the timer down as if someone is injured/hooked, and they just need to be taken off. Bam now Endgame Piggy is usable without being unbalanced and unfun to play against.
---
Of course this will never happen because BHVR thinks The Pig is apparently The Nurse of this game.
---
Where‚Äôs your instaheal?
---
I guess. They‚Äôd have to do the same on the killer end and have the survivors pings also.. which tbh when your dealing with dedicated servers is sorta pointless. A cute novelty.. but pretty useless. People ditched lobbies before because they could see pings when it mattered more. Now that it doesn‚Äôt people might just choose to play against people with bad pings and always have the advantage. Simple is usually better.
---
favorite: quentin or hallowed blight dwight
---
least favorite: nea, claudette and meg
---
Rage shitting?
---
I now realize it was ragequits since the DC icona had sound cues with it, and if someone gets kicked from the game there is no sound cue.
---
It's just really cheesy, killing people inside a locker seems like a Myers thing to do and he can't, you would be dead anyways but you used a small niche to spite them and make sure they didn't get the achievement
---
I like the sound of that
---
Dead by light
---
No. Don't nerf gen speed even further. You know what really isn't fun? Staring at a generator and holding M1. Instead, give survs more side objectives or ANYTHING they have to do besides sittng around and holding down a button. It's the worst part about playing survivor.
---
I want one.
---
I tried carrying a baby Meg to my Ruin totem for free points after her 2 teammates DCed and the 3rd died on first hook, but she kept struggling and running into the opposite direction, and after like 5 attempts I just killed her and felt bad about it, but she didn't let me let her live :(
---
P.S. this was before EGC so there was no hatch I could even take her to.
---
You‚Äôre only missing the purple medkit with insta heal and you‚Äôre all set for a trial. Good job girl!
---
Not broken hight skill cap
---
BHVR knows that if they follow someone, they'll get a reaction now
---
Demoflower
---
The escape rate at rank 1 is very low, especially for the instadown killers. Hillbilly, Nurse and Spirit are the three most competitive. SWF groups skew the average, though.
---
And then they DC if you let them struggle off.
---
/s?
---
My sister played the game for the first time yesterday, she got an afk crow and i told her it‚Äôs bc she was standing still for too long and she said ‚Äúbut if i move won‚Äôt the killer find me?‚Äù and i‚Äôm here like Bitch you got a raven above you making noises i‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs more of a telltale sign than moving
---
Oh i see it allows you to rebuild hex totems, this is a completely new idea. I like it but i feel like it can be abused, this wouldnt be that bad with ruin but how would it work with devour hope? I think it would be too strong just repairing ur devour hope and continuing your rampage.
---
Also wouldnt the generator one be abuseable? What if the killer keeps an eye on the only generator you can work on? How would this work if multiple people have this perk? What if everyone uses the perk and in an unlucky course of events they all get the same generator? Cant th killer camp it and stall the game forever?
---
give nea skateboard?
---
Look at all those campers, tbh though this looks really cool
---
Wow that's a good idea! I don't see a problem with his height too. I mean he got a terror radius and the red light. You will see him. Mostly. And when not. Well that's when it becomes fun. Cause you get scared. And that's what I'm missing atm.
---
What is underground complex? I‚Äôve not heard of that map.
---
I would blame both.  Players can tell what's reasonable and what isn't in the game.  Why are so many people desperate for a effort-free 4k that they defend this?
---
Id prob main Quentin if I bought DLC before Ashy Slashy came out
---
Come join us - We're all disappointments
---
f o c u s
---
I just wanted a nice ending I hate cliff hangers. 
---
Like I wouldn‚Äôt give a shot if Bruce was only in 3 episodes and they killed him off but in a good fashion. 
---
Or you follow the other members and then near the end they meat up with Ash and save the day. Both endings I‚Äôm satisfied with.
---
Noed is such a shit perk, it activates when the game is over lmao. Survivors are triggered because they can't save their friends from the hook
---
Yup, that's the exact issue I see with generator time being increased. For most of the people it just isn't any fun to deal with.
---
Just bluntly increasing it would be a bad idea anyway, I'd prefer to tie it to totems instead of whatsoever. As in, for every totem still remaining on the map the time needed to complete a gen increases by 15 seconds or whatsoever. This wouldn't just make totems themselfes more attractive, but also makes certain perks more impactful and also gives the Survivor a choice. Either, they'll have to head through a gen that lasts longer, or they do everyone except the Killer a favor and go for the bone-zone.
---
She already has one ü§î
---
Its not players fault for using items and mechanics that dev made and put it into the game, i should be able to play however i want without feeling guilty, if its an issue then the devs should fix it, not me not playing it.
---
The only counter to a good nurse is to get hooked three times, then she'll probably leave you alone.
---
I read at first jewis
---
The only reason I made it 15 seconds is because that goes in line with other perks like Leader and Streetwise. I could settle for 10 seconds, but 5 seconds would just be to little and would make the gains from this version of Spine Chill just as useless as the current one. 
---
Not to mention the speed bonus is equivalent to Prove Thyself and Worn Out Tools so it's not like you're getting a huge speed bonus from this version of the perk anyways.
---
No. No.
---
"Unnecessary, your comment is."
---
Fixed it.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I mean u slugged
---
I'm still hoping for a spin off with the rest of the cast.
---
TBH his story line didn't sound too amazing, but i'd like to know what happened to the other guys. Most notably the girl. Introducing such an important character just to do nothing with.
---
I did and got wrecked by a spirit... I disappointed everyone
---
I don't get it
---
Because getting No Mither with Second Wind, Self-Care, or Inner Strength is funny, but can get frustrating
---

At least you can be farmed by the WGLF gang.

We won't forget your service to survivor kind. Funds raised will be used solely for flashlights.
---
The cliffhanger ending was in line with Evil Dead fashion though. All the movies end on a wacky cliffhanger, just like the show did.
---
Dead by Flashlight
---
They can avoid it and they will still tunnell you again.
---
Your flairs makes me doubt that statement.
---
That's certainly ahoyt off my shoulders.
---
Sorry...
---
OOOO DEDICATED SERVERS LETS GO!!!
---
It's not a habit of devs tho, more of a matter of management and PR. I have no doubt devs would take all time in the world
---
This image is awesome- but what really bothers me is the fact she is mall grabbing that skate bored ;-;
---
Better than tunneling, which would've been the case had I hooked her again
---
Playing as trapper, everytime I set a trap I step in it as soon as the animation finishes. Rough times
---
üê∑
---
babyrage
---
You won't get to use much of the offering because the tunneller will throw you out the game by teleporting and hitting you as soon as you step off the hook making it useless.
---
They will be dead too lmao.
---
Still scarier than Susie
---
Adrenaline is useful 9 of 10 games
---
I'm talking about op...
---
Ooooh that makes more sense
---
Yes to this
---
It's both adorable AND demented. It's perfect!
---
I love idubz but he never actually finishes people‚Äôs careers he kind of just makes their popularity have more range. Idk if that‚Äôs what you were referencing but that‚Äôs all I think of when people are in his content cops. Lol
---
Survivor: You tunneled me! You're looknig up my channel right now.
---
Thanos killer: I don't even know who you are
---
Sadly it's always before 18 that the game is not scary anymore in your eyes :'(
---
It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake!
---
Both there aren't. The rarities on cosmetics only go up to purple. And true, they would be less of cosmetics and more of rewards
---
If it stays active after the Killer looks away, it's giving a false positive for fifteen seconds after every activation. That's not good at all.
---
Even better is when the games are evenly matched. I feel like too many sore loser and winners don‚Äôt understand a good game when they see one.
---
You'd be rendering pts obsolete when you can essentially always have the speed boost just for the killer glancing in your direction.
---
They are on live for testing.
---
The Spine Chill change is because the bonuses from Spine Chill are basically useless to begin with, and with the new Undetectable Status Effect, Spine Chill is going to need something extra to stand out from other perks.
---
The Premonition change is because the perk is basically just a worse version of Spine Chill. To make a proper distinction between the two perks, I gave Premonition a stealth aspect that Spine Chill doesn't have, with the trade off that it triggers at a closer range.
---
There is definitely an argument there, but at the same time some of us never used old DS because we knew it was bullshit. I usually don't use the strongest thing in a game, because when I win, I want it to be because of me. Just my philosophy on gaming I guess.
---
These would be for veteran players who would grind through a harder bloodweb. Maybe I should've called them cosmetics
---
That's what u get for playing spirit
---
Just always be doing gens when you‚Äôre not in a chase, that is the best thing you can do to not let down your team lol as long as you do that you‚Äôre okay in my book.
---
Haha! Thank you! :3
---
F
---
Just did that, thanks
---
what happened after?
---
Update: Patch just went live this morning.
---
While I can't put this in the description, the perk icon would have a Stake Out effect where it would slowly change to inactive over the 15 second period when the perk is active but the Killer isn't looking at you. Not to mention, the audio que would always trigger when the Killer first looked at you.
---
Check his router settings most likely stopping him because of the connection to the killer
---
I'd take NOED over Hex Ruin any day.
---
Thanks hopefully it‚Äôs fixed now
---
I used to be the same way about killer üòÇ red rank survivor but thought I‚Äôd get embarrassed as a killer and now I‚Äôm nearing red ranks with both
---
I hit rank 3 survivor and rank 5 killer with 80 hours played. Nobody good will be impressed by this.
---
To play as, I'd say Ghostface/Myers.
---
To play against Hillbilly/Myers. I used to hate Hillbilly as a new player, but once I better understand how to loop, he became less frustrating. Myers is fun because his power means he won't be removing anyone from the game quickly, and it's scary but satisfying to loop a tier 3 Myers.
---
That‚Äôs a mom who is the best
---
That would honestly be too much. It's already a great perk. Buffing it to increase repair speed would bust it.
---
So basically you're a wretched piece of shit and you have no friends and your parents regret your birth. Got it.
---
Not a killer, but had a salty teammate tell me to "go back to Kingdom Hearts" after apparently creeping my profile in full salt mode.
---
Yep. The most dangerous survivor (from the perspective of a killer), is the one who works a gen, starts a chase, loops you for a minute whilst only needing a single pallet, then vanishes into nothingness.
---
Makes sense the lockers are only made out of wood and he has a chainsaw
---
What settings exactly? Do you know if there is something specific that needs to be looked at?
---
I mean, if anything, they might see the demand for this sort of thing thanks to this channel and decide to make custom tracks, but they'd almost definitely use the composer they've used for everything else instead
---
I've had a similar issue where my roommates and I (all hard-wired in with ethernet cables) on Type 1 cant connect to each other.
---
GEDDADATHEGOO
---
Happy birthday!!!!
---
I mean. you don't have to be good to have fun
---
What happened Keem? I thought you were "fast as fuck"?
---
Welcome to playing survivor with a killer with shit ping. Now the fun is on both sides.
---
Even my teleportation exhaustion perk idea?
---
Looks like the match isn't going too well then. Probably moried by a Demogorgon.
---
Best mom everü§©üîù
---
Yeah, I think other games balance the game around high tiers because they are the best at abusing the game. But in dbd def have ability‚Äôs never intended. Such as communication, you can‚Äôt balance a game around a feature 99% of the player base doesn‚Äôt have and screw them over by nerfing swf.
---
Then Premonition would basically be OoO 0.5 without a cooldown.
---
Id understand if its in heartbeat distance of the killer, or you didnt have we'll make it and the survivor has selfcare because you would want as many as possible working on gens, but if the survivors just gonna run to the corner and doesnt even have selfcare(medkit doesnt count since you savor that), you just say f### you to the guy because theyre just waisting your time
---
This is amazing!
---
You won't get many points, will get D striked a lot, disconnected and trolled by pros. Doesn't sound fun to me.
---
RIP
---
If this starts playing as soon as I'm exposed, I'm shidding myself
---
Except shorter range and no aura for either side, which is enough of a different perk imo
---
Happy Birthday!!!!
---
More like 14. Reddit community suck ass when it comes to doenvoting. I didnt even know there were 5
---
can... can she teach me?
---
Too bad that this game is only scary to rank 20s, sonny jim. Adding a stupid doll won't change that.
---
Amazing cosplay! Nice job!

You are actually delusional if you thought I was preaching it as hard as I could if at all. Idk what's wrong with you, you must have some attachment to steroids or savage himself cause this is not how normal people think my dude. All I said was steroids are bad for the heart and you feel this offended.
---
Yeah I get what you‚Äôre tying to get at, but I dont think your list is representing the killer side fairly. 
---
What about hex ruin and pop goes the weasel, and now Surge + surveillance combo. Every killer is running hex ruin these days since it came on the shrine. Most survivors stop doing gens to look for it or can‚Äôt do hex skill checks. 
---
Killers have plenty of  red add ons as well and mori. Insta down ability killers. I met a huntress that was super good at cross map hatchets that have exhaustion hatchets. Meyers can literally see people through walls so can plague with one of her addons and legion with his frenzy. 
---
For toolbox and such, killers can bring Franklin‚Äôs demise. 
---
Freddy has plenty of things that can slow you down once you‚Äôre in the dream state so you have to wake up somehow to counter act which either means wasting time to find the alarm clock or reveling your location by failing a skill check (possibly regressing a gen) or finding someone to wake you but the time for that will increase to a crawl.  
---
I don‚Äôt play killer often so I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs so many other things I‚Äôm not listing here that can help a killer counter survivor. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to argue if the perks or items are tilted one sided towards one or another Bc I think it‚Äôs kind of balance. I‚Äôm just saying doing gens is 95% of a survivors job. So to call it gen rushing is silly bc I can call it hook rushing for killers on why they keep going around and hooking the survivors all the time...
---
If I had to choose an in game killer and irl killer
---
In game: Micheal Miers (or however you spell it)
---
Irl: Jeffrey Dommer (or how ever you spell it)
---
It already increases repair speed, I just upped the speed to a Max of 10%, from 6%. The equivalent to Prove Thyself or a Worn Out Tools, Toolbox.
---
The ugliest character in dbd lol
---
GUrllll, I MAIN Huntress. ASSuming things I see.
---
How i wish that this could be said to be the same for random survivor teams
---
Not you btw the cosplay is amazing:)
---
Teams have been autobalanced
---
I relate to this post so much. XD
---
Held two survivors in the Ironworks of Misery as Leatherface for 10 minutes with 4 survivors alive, other two guys showed up to find out where the killer had gone, got bored, knocked the survivors in the basement down, hooked and killed one, went back for the other to find the other two guys trying to heal him, knocked him back down, took out another guy, the first guy crawled off as I hooked the second guy...
---
To summarize, I locked all the survivors in the basement at separate times and got two kills, but I held two survivors in the basement for easily 20 minutes at least.
---
Actually had time to go get a snack and eat it, I was getting hate from one guy and the other was trying to bait me into attacking him, which, I wasn't even touching my controller.
---
Eventually got bored of watching one guy run up and down the stairs while making smartass comments towards the other guy, so I ended it by knocking down the one guy and then hooking him, to which the other guy took the opportunity to leave.
---
You have the coolest mom
---
agree
---
My bad
---
Haha Killer good Survivor bad
---
If your names D‚ÄôArby and you have an older brother with the same name you‚Äôll have your answer.
---
Slugging exists for D strike, points aren't an issue BBQ covers that. and if they do all escape. GG WP
---
Omg so beautiful, ur mom is amazing...Happy birthday btw
---
can't they body block it though if they are dead center on it?
---
I wouldn't worry about it.  A rank 11 friend of mine always says 'Don't judge me by my rank'.  Yeah, we're all terrible, regardless of what the numbers say.  Just do your best, and use your killer knowledge to your advantage.
---
The worst that can happen is that you die.  Again.
---
But you won't get that if they and most likely will disconnect lmfao.
---
Well.. that‚Äôs your opinion... I like her a lot.
---
But that‚Äôs :)
---
That's a free item every time the Killer glances in your direction.
---
Let me guess. You login once a month
---
I don‚Äôt know who Keemstar is but all I can say is that he‚Äôs obviously bad at the game, and anyone who agrees with this is also bad at the game. Learn to loop. Learn to evade. Learn how to play the damn game, instead of wanting wins handed to you. I‚Äôm a survivor main, and honestly I get sick of survivors bitching about ‚ÄúOP killers‚Äù, when the reality is that they just don‚Äôt know how to play against them, and they don‚Äôt even want to learn. Get over yourselves.
---
Imagine clowns theme just being that on circus music but bass boosted
---
How recently did he start playing? I assumed he has like 20 hours, so nothing he says about the balance of the game matters.
---
And they're working on those underpowered killers. Specific killers are strong such as nurse, Sprit and hillbilly. specific killers are weak such as (in my opinion) Doctor, pig and leatherface.
---
Even those killers are easily viable that I mentioned are weak. Literally every killer is viable and you can easily get 4ks with any of them now. 
---
You're saying killers as a whole are incredibly underpowered, that is a very different statement to specific killers are underpowered or SWF is overpowered.
---
Considering the games past, it‚Äôs probably by far the most balanced it‚Äôs ever been for the most part. Still, most of the m1 killers are pretty weak imo and need work in general, but really only on an individual level. I don‚Äôt think there really needs to be any big sweeping changes unless they decide to do something big about making solo survivors more on the same level as swf, since right now, solo survivor is extremely unfun if you end up with bad teammates.
---
Legion should definitely have some electric guitar. It's in his music when you pick him.
---
Yes dear god. For survivors it‚Äôs escape lol but killers have to move Mt Everest like jeez fam
---
current ones
---
More recently was a game where I was more active, had a maximum shock range Doctor and the survivors 3 genned themselves, I just kept walking in circles, shocking the generators and coming over to kick them if I actually shocked someone.
---
I think the match lasted another 20 minutes.
---
Didn't even hit anyone until I figured "I think they're getting close to finishing some of these generators."
---
To which I decided to start downing people and hooking them, unfortunately for the survivors there was a hook in between all three generators, so if they went for the save (which they almost always did) they'd get shocked, and probably hit.
---
People who complain about "tunneling" when it isn't actually tunneling bother me. If you just got unhooked by a healthy survivor, right the hell in front of me,  you're getting downed again. Blame the survivor that farmed you.
---
I'd love to see some of the sensitive people on this sub handle getting spawn trapped in a FPS game, or getting juggled in a fighting game.
---
I think they‚Äôre both solid perks.  Spine chill is very popular and premonition III is insanely strong for stealth.  You know which direction they are coming from before the terror radius starts.
---
If people used that with the new faster walking perk it would be a huge headache for killers.
---
Either clown or plague feel like throwing up on people and throwing cotton candy vape would be quite fun
---
I've seen this video! They really deserve it. Also it would be nice to finally hear something other than the same track over and over!
---
It was a joke lol they can both have fake pallets to fool the survivors
---
And this, ladies and gentlemen (and others) is an example of taking survivors (though not the entire game, since there are still survivors up to repair gens and trigger EGC) hostage and generally being a complete dick.

 'He died from steroids. Did I mention he died from steroids? Because steroids are bad and I had to mention he died from steroids' - Nobody asked about steroids. Someone explained it and you threw in steroids. Fuck off with your backpedaling
---
Yep I agree, I just made a reply to his reply if you want me to go more in depth. Specific killers you can argue are weaker but in general, the game is very well balanced right now, we're at a point where even the worse killers are pretty well viable. New players would never know the pain of pre 2.0, just watch any gameplay footage of old hag if you want to know what I'm talking about.
---
What an amazing mum. It‚Äôs nice to have parents who take an interest in the things you love.
---
It‚Äôs just Evil Dead. It‚Äôs from 2013 and directed by Fede √Ålvarez if that helps.
---
Escape with it for double bloodpoints in all categorys
---
I once had a devour hope get 5 stack and got 3 Moris was so happy
---
Thank you
---
Trans rights!
---
Oh, this was before EGC, exit gates were open for the longest time, I probably would have only gotten one kill if the other two guys hadn't stuck around.
---
Plague or Michael tbh
---
laughs in inner strength
---
Yes but it take a painfully long amount of time like nearly all 4 survivors fully stalked. It's really fun when you pop it though.
---
I don't get the threat in a no blonk nurse
---
I'm not sure exactly how recent but I know it was sometime in late July/early August which is when I saw the post that he'd be playing it. I'm not actually sure how long he's been *playing* it
---
He said Tombstone Piece which doesn't work. He needs to use Judith's Tombstone.
---
Well a lot of the early survivors looked kinda ugly (except Dwight because dwight is god) nea she literally needs makeup and hair dye and masks to look ok‚Äôish
---
Starts by K. "Ochido, but is a new player."
---
Oh yea you right my bad
---
I play daily if I can.
---
*insert Michael tier 3 sound effect*
---
I have so many questions
---
That's fine. Think of that next time you fail vaulting a window. ;D
---
Happy birthday
---
if they all dc thats a win for me
---
[Ohh you almost had it, you gotta be quicker than that Trapper!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItUECpFi9_s)
---
But then someone cleanses it and it was haunted grounds
---
Still, you'd get that speed boost more that you think. You'd get it more than PTS plus you know when killer is coming. So how does this buff not eliminate PTS?
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
Because you never encountered her
---
Yes, they do. It is an infinite tier 3 meyers that can mori you without downing you. The catch is it takes all game to get to tier 3 making it difficult to pull off. You have nearly get all of the evil out the survivors to come close to getting tier 3.
---
Technically it makes you a loser with hardly any points.
---
I had a Dwight get super toxic the other day, I didn't even tunnel him when he got unhooked (like I didn't race back to the hook or try to find him), I just checked my Ruin and there he was, vaulting (still injured, he must have refused a heal under the hook) right into me.
---
Like sheesh if you return to my hex totem that I know you saw within 5 seconds, of course I'm gonna be there waiting for you.
---
He then proceeded to be super toxic, he showed Claudette the totem (which wasn't the toxic part) and then proceeded to fast vault a billion times to try and sandbag her/draw my attention so that I'd chase her and he could cleanse it. He was still injured.
---
This sometimes depends on what killer your playing or what the situation is but if every survivor dies when they have the best perks and they die to a trapper then it the survivors fault for being trash

I think I lost a brain cell
---
So true, my fellow fans of Devour Hope :D
---
I had that happen on a pallet and a locker yesterday as killer in my only match.  Did they add dedicated servers for Xbox? Lol
---
Had a game were a survivor continually ran into me (almost like he was chasing me) and called me a tuneller and "dirty chink". I'm not even asian.

I imagined Billy having something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85mDyWCgHy0)

Potato survivors, unite!!
---
Yeah I can see "genrush" being a term survivors use like:
---
&gt;"What the hell you guys! All 3 of you were healthy, killer didn't have noed, and I'm on my first hook but you just genrush and leave me to die!"
---
probably Legion, cause lets be real...they are the only ones I could fit
---
Is this some kind of attack? Should dbd players band together to stop this? Only time will tell‚Ä¶
---
The "bonuses" are meant to be useless. It's there to give you an extra warning if you didn't see spine chill light up.
---
Some do care only about winning. That's fair I guess, but it makes me sad. There are so many more experience to have in a game with goofy antics and off meta strategies. Games seem to have gotten so much more competitive as time has gone on. I guess I'm just nostalgic for simpler times, back when most people were casuals in online games, and there weren't billions of YouTube tutorials on how to git gud. Alas, the sands of time flow on, and such an era is lost to us.
---
Mall Grab 100
---
Anywhere if you take her on a date and give her enough Lemon Sours
---
Can you please give some reasoning cause i feel that removing this whole reliance on great skill checks only benefits baby survivors.
---
Bitch, if you can't loop, then stop running around and become immersed.
---
As a killer more often than not you can predict Dead Hard and swing late or not swing at all and watch them awkwardly... Of course there are survivors who dead hard for distance but these are rare. 
---
If you have a problem with dead hard as a killer, don't know what to tell you.
---
the Ending was beautiful
---
Probably because you've learned from previous mistakes. Good job.
---
Bond is best for general time optimisation and getting gens done, which is the most important thing for solo play imo. Empathy is better as more of a killer detection perk, since you'll be able to see whoever is being chased when they're inevitably injured.
---
Well It's definitely nothing like OOO since Premonition doesn't reveal auras. In fact, my idea of Premonition and the current OOO are basically completely different play styles.
---
OOO: You see me Killer?! Ya?! You should come for me! Ya I can see you. (Agro)
---
This Premonition: Oh the Killer is over there, this is my chance for escape... (Pure Stealth)
---
If you run against a wall while turning a corner and then stay still it could confuse someone who isn't a prodigy
---
I think it's funny lol
---
Mull mull mull mull
---
Those are all fair points
---
So the solution is to 'getgud' lol. Cool. Look forward to it then
---
Meg angry!
---
My version of Premonition has a cooldown.
---
Its probably the video for Hallows End. There were comic style videos last year
---
You can also use OoO to stealth (somewhat) if you use it to "flicker" the killer's location. Even better if they're not looking at you when you do it.
---
My point is that both OoO and your idea for Premonition do the same thing: reveal the killer (not *just* through auras, mind you) for an infinite amount of time, and only one of them has a drawback.
---
You‚Äôre gay.
---
Looking like an APB character

We're talking about this guy's suggestions for Premonition, not yours.
---
Oh okay. Yeah I know that. I just thought you were saying they had more pallets than other killers because of those add ons. Lol thanks for clarifying
---
Taking the HTM ‚ÄòL‚Äô
---
I wish I could do spins like that, but alas I play on PS4
---
4 killers and 1 survivor üòÆ that's a recipe for disaster
---
WOW! this is soooo good!!!
---
I NEED one of these for the clown with some creepy carnival music.
---
My legion main soul felt this
---
Yes, i think so
---
Ikr? Bullies totally deserve that.
---
Yall obviously play with better people than I do, the only time mine activates 9 out of 10 games is when the killer closes the hatch.
---
It‚Äôs your 8th birthday and you play this game?
---
Just let me hope for pennywise üéà
---
If you piss them off enough for them to become toxic, you're probably doin something right
---
If you wanna use the perks that seem fun to you, just go for it so that when you win the survivors feel like shit because they lost to someone only using monstrous shrine
---
yea but they forfeited. making them lose and get 0 bp and depip. I might at least still safety pip
---
&gt;Look at the flair
---
Using the meme flair as a smoke screen for a lowkey complaint about dead hard and then acting like its just a joke.
---
No, and we shouldn't balance the game around Rank 1 either, but they should think about mechanics which make it easier for Rank 20 survivors and harder for rank 1 survivors, but benefit Rank 1 survivors in other ways(More Iridescent Shards).
---
Yet just killing yourself on first hook also ruins the game like a dc
---
Then you don't understand how impactful saving someone is.
---
pfft, k dude.
---
Weird flex
---
Behaviour. The devs.
---
im curious as to what your assumption meant
---
This happens if you play too many games without restarting the game. After 3 matches the menu gets laggy, after 5-6 matches it gets even more laggy and after 8 the bloodweb glitches out. Atleast on ps4
---
Oh yeah and inner strength was a great indirect Noed nerf, I hope people keep running it.
---
Surely that much is a good thing though?
---
You're going from hosting the game yourself to having it hosted remotely, any tangible change on your end could only really be a bad thing.
---
Bugs are bugs, but the moment-to-moment experience as a killer is very solid imho.
---
its just the most fun and chill way to play killer for me. Bricky says theres no made up honor code or rule book you gotta follow in this game just play how you want to play
---
i play almost everyday and i dont get rank yellow rank survivors as a red rank killer
---
Link?
---
Hawkins
---
Not true. Fake news
---
That's fantastic! I really want chase music specific to each Killer. Heck, I'll even buy music packs as DLC if necessary. Just give me spooky circus music for my Clown games!
---
Tapp ain't got nothing on me
---
Actually there's a report button for some rules so technically there is..
---
No Pennywise ever. Sucks to suck
---
I love powers that change the chases fundamentally, like Demogorgon's Shred, Billy's Chainsaw, Hag's traps, etc., so that chases are not the same fundamentally. It's just when the power gets rid of the chase entirely that I hate it. Playing against Spirit just feels like flipping a coin every 10 or so seconds, and playing against Nurse is nigh near impossible unless the Nurse is bad.
---
The same goes the other way, default Wraith and Bubba (and to some extent, Myers and Doctor) are really boring to play against because it is just the same shit over and over if you're playing properly. Powers should be reworked to be able to shorten chases effectively, but not so much they just get rid of it.
---
Survivors have we're going to live forever for farming  blood points though.  It would make almost no sense to have a perk on a killer for more BP in exchange for a perk slot.
---
Nice!
---
The last part of the basic attack isn‚Äôt even true on everyone though- Legion can gain stacks of STBFL by stabbing people during Feral Frenzy.
---
Lol spirit ur trash lmao xdxdxd hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Well a large majority of ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù survivors usually play as Nea or Claudette.
---
My favorite thing is it‚Äôs al on the Xbox cake
---
Who hates nea? She is my main but her default skin is kinda ugly maybe thats why and no she is not bad at gameplay, all survivors are the same.
---
You should have found 1 if you're prestiged
---
I use claudette for self heal... is that bad?
---
I mean I don‚Äôt want that thing fucking me but to each their own
---
No. Hard mode should give some reward. Think Of games with hard modes. Do any have no benefit? If yes, than do you think it‚Äôs worth playing hard mode if you get the same experience for normal or easy (and ‚Äúsome people like it harder‚Äù isn‚Äôt a reward it‚Äôs preference)?
---
Thanks man and yeah I think 2 of them got to struggle on first hook and I didnt get all my brutal points but it was close.
---
Basically
---
As far as I know Nurse is not even played on Consoles. Maybe redo this post and say "PC players will quit?"
---
not on console tho
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm reporting you for teaming with a survivor‚Äù
---
I let him escape though?
---
well yes but devs said tunneling is fine. not necessarily nice, but you wont be banned for it
---
Once you get more confident with chases it is actually more efficient to go after the other person depending on the situation. If I‚Äôm really close when they‚Äôre unhooked I‚Äôll down the unhooked survivor, I don‚Äôt hook him though and I run after the survivor who unhooked him. The reason I like to do this is because it applies a lot of pressure in a little bit of time, gets nearly all if not all survivors off the gens to go revive the downed survivor, and if I manage to down the altruistic survivor I ran after and hook them quickly then I may manage to snowball the play into a 3 hooks or even an early 4k if I‚Äôm lucky and they make big mistakes but worst case scenario is I don‚Äôt catch the survivor I chased and everyone gets free. So medium risk big reward. The average reward from this play is usually two hooks for me though. Not to mention I got them way off track on the objective after the first hook. With this plan I mainly am trying to get hooks while also getting other survivor off of the gen without being anywhere near them. Killing two birds with one stone. But if you don‚Äôt want to do that you would probably have a good time with make your choice. Just one hit the altruistic survivor. Go chase down and one hit the unhooked survivor and boom two hooks right there.
---
Does keemstar play dbd? I did not know that
---
I never said you would..
---
Idk, when i say something about nea, some people say bad of her idk
---
Just do bones, it's easy blood points and pip progress.
---
kids should not be here.
---
Huntress nerf lookin good to me
---
And I got downvoted to hell for asking a question, well thank you for informing me about this.
---
do you realize that thats supposed to be cursed?
---
lol no they won't
---
Am I supposed to recognize that name?
---
I am the opposite. Just started playing, and I didn't want to feel like a loser by playing killer and not killing at least one person. Took me a couple of weeks to coax myself into it, but now I'm enjoying the Hag and usually get at least 2 people. But we're all rank 20s who have no idea what we're doing.
---
nah man she kind of a meme. She is the best killer in the game :)
---
dumb meme that nea players are toxic
---
Wut?
---
I'd say you have the best mom ever! Happy Birthday, good sir!
---
It‚Äôs actually Vanity Mirror, and anyways, this was a complaint because i literally just went up against that spirit build
---
I'm just sayin, i technically I ain't doing anything wrong
---
Dead in daylight
---
thats the meme. Checkout "Noob3" on YT and u will understand.
---
it's just that shitty stereotype where Claudette and her represents the toxicity in this game, which i find it dumb
---
Oh, this guys a memer
---
No one said you were but don't expect anyone to stay in your game or want to play with you lmao.
---
Wicked underrated netflix original movie.  For having a CGI monster, they do a very good job not showing it to you very often.  It never really looked "silly" to me like a lot of the big reveal monsters do.
---
I have a quick question.. What does that little number o der your player level means?
---
Nea main, is that you?
---
Oh no not at all. It‚Äôs more of the players than the character that they use that everyone hates. But people just slap Claudette and New onto these people as a face
---
Gonna get downvoted for this but whatever.
---
They actually did release stats back when they use to do weekly streams and I recall them saying that 65% of survivors die in their games.
---
This was back when bloodlust didn‚Äôt exist, vacuum pallets existed, and ruin wasn‚Äôt used.
---
Now this was across all ranks and probably factored in DC‚Äôs as well.
---
But still an interesting statistic regardless.
---
Now with that said, do I think killers are OP? Against solo players? Perhaps, but against SWF, absolutely fucking not.
---
So hard to balance imo.
---
Those are awesome! How‚Äôd you make them?
---
That's how I used to play Freddy during bloodpoint events before the Freddy change.
---
I meme'd it up with add-ons that made waking up really easy, and threw "Slumber parties".
---
It honestly made the game a fun challenge to play since I had to remember who I had hooked already, since I didn't want anyone to die at a Slumber Party :)
---
Well technically yeah but it also would remove the counter play of protection hits and flashlight saves because you would just warp to the basement.  How would this perk interact with decisive strike?
---
there's a running joke that Nea is actually a killer but otherwise i don't know. her abilities are fine, gameplay isn't character based really.
---
That's devotion, when you hit level 100 it starts back at 1 and you get a number under the level, everytime it happens it gets bigger
---
Homophobia is subjective. Some people are homophobic, some are not. That makes it subjective.
---
I fail to see your point.
---
I have hundreds of hours and I've only seen a few nurses lately on pc so doubt anyone will quit
---
Yum
---
why they wouldnt? nurse is boring af as how op she is
---
I hope to get as many self-cares on the enemy team as possible, those matches are usually much easier as I get more time to do my thing. They waste too much time and heal when they don't need to.
---
Yes, somebody has posted something like this before, but with a different image and less effort
---
no not really
---
well if the killer enjoys what they do, clearly they're having fun
---
Not at all. It's people who are well enough experienced in the game and want to play well but aren't try hard like red ranks and green rank players are not much better than yellow rank players
---
It's a perk. Perks counter some strategies. The perk that makes you harder to blind counters flashlights. This one counter body blockers.
---
Decisive would work before the teleportation takes effect.
---
These perks are amazing and they fit so well with her character.
---
I think keem should try to hide more than rely on pallets all the time, there is nothing wrong about being stealthy.

Thanks! I got a badge maker off of eBay and I just got a template offline for the size of the badge, then I get whatever pics I want make them circular, add them to the template, print, cut, and boom I have cool badges
---
Scary monsters....
---
...maybe
---
but I play nancy now
---
No one said you weren't but it still means you're a crap killer.
---
I think it is
---
Everytime, i just dont bring them or a escape cake because the worst usually befalls me
---
That sounds fun, might have to give it a shot
---
Run For Your Life was in the base game lol when it came out, I think having every vault be fast would be a bit broken again on a shorrt cooldown.
---
Still seems too strong to me man.  Gives you a lot of map mobility for pretty much no reason and always puts the picked up survivor into the weakest position on the map.
---
Slippery meat

That's actually inspired. Good job :)

Especially this season with all the noobs Dx
---
Killers are weaker than survivors, so I don't see the problem.
---
Joining a lobby was almost instant but getting all four survivors took usually the same amount of time it takes for me to find a lobby now, who usually starts immediately.
---
That sounds fun, might have to give it a shot! (I accidentally replied to the post and not your comment the first time, sorry lol)
---
Why
---
Pallets that you can loop without worry/ones that have such short walls around them killer can double back and ht=it you easily
---
Nothing wrong here, you just phased into a locker. Phasing is Spirit's _thing,_ y'know?
---
Tips to like this game? 
---
Ignore whatever toxic things your teammates/killer says. Play how you wanna play. Use the perks that interest YOU, not what everyone else says is good. Yes, there are meta perks that help a ton, and you can obviously run those if you want. But as a rank 1 survivor who has seen it all, the best way to enjoy this game is to just learn to laugh off the stupidity and not get salty if you die. Getting tunneled? Cool, my teammates can do gens. Getting camped? Cool, my teammates can do gens. Get hit from bs lag? Damn, that sucks, hopefully it doesn‚Äôt happen again. The killer is slugging everybody, making you feel helpless? Crawl as far away as you can and make him waste time looking for you, and who knows maybe he won‚Äôt find you and you‚Äôll bleed out, screwing him on points. You got out and the killer sent you a nasty message? Lmao, he‚Äôs mad cause he didn‚Äôt get the 4K, nbd. Basically, whatever bullshit is upsetting you about the game, try to reason with it. Look for the positive.
---
no one is gonna quit the game over one killer
---
never said i was a good killer either. i just enjoy playing killer this way.
---
Too bad this never happens
---
I've already been reported and accused of cheating because of server lag causing bullshit to happen. I hit a survivor and they didn't seem to react. I was confused. Hit them again and they didn't even go down. Suddenly I teleport maybe 15 meters away and they're downed. Then the end game chat explodes with "reported cheater" "get vacbanned" etc.
---
He‚Äôs not ugly enough
---
Some of the survivor rituals are faily easy. Complete x gens, unhook x times with y survivor, open the exit gates with y survivor, escape the trial with an item.
---
Yeah because you're too lazy and toxic to learn how to play properly.
---
I mean, I guess?  I think right now  the game is in one of its best spots in terms of balance in survivor versus killer.  
---
However I think a perk that automatically warps you to the basement when you pick someone up would be busted strong on trapper, hag, and leatherface and still a very strong choice for Nurse, Billy and spirit.
---
Happy 18th b day
---
&gt; and I've yet to see them get more than 1k. I'm sure it happens but idk.
---
you practically get 1K just by loading into the game as killer. this cannot be true
---
My mother was a fan of the first Evil Dead but thought the sequels got too comical. She's a fan of "Typical" Horror (Halloween, Friday The 13th, Last House On The Left, George Romero's various zombie films, 28 days later, Alien, etc.) and the later Evil Dead movies supposedly became less horror and more black comedy. I need to watch them eventually.
---
Well hey. Now you don‚Äôt need a blindfold for the challenge you (probably) always wanted to do! Playing DbD blind!
---
You're not allowed to speak on the internet, you should know this
---
The basement isn't that strong unless it's being camped.
---
Is this from South Park? I feel like it‚Äôs from South Park lol
---
You don't know what "Spaghetti code" is, do you?
---
Same thing happened to me , it was a game as I was about to hit rank 1 also and the game didn‚Äôt count I was so pissed.
---
Yup, but camping was an ez rank up. Camp one to death, down the other, camp to death aand you won. Wasnt the best...
---
Sort of but not really. You can still reach unlimited Tier 3, you can lunge to do instadowns, but as soon as you actually go up to someone and press M1 to tombstone them you go back to Tier 2 after you mori them.
---
You're right about his latency to the server and it should work like that with dedicated servers in any game in theory. 
---
However, OP is right about what he is facing, because as of now the hit detection and most actions (flashlight saves, pallets stuns, dead hard...) are coded client-sided in DBD, this means all the issue with laggy killer-hosts remains with laggy killers on such dedicated servers. 
---
Just to give an exemple, if a killer has a 1000ms latency to the server, he will appear far (1s+) in chase on survivors screens, but not on his screen, and as long as he hits survivors on HIS screen, the hit will register even though it clearly didn't connect on every other screens. So all the latency/BS hitbox remains for now. It also makes lagswitching (although very rare and way less used than people can claim it) still possible which is very bad in all honestly. 
---
Even in fair situations where both killer and survivors have good latency such as 40ms, and where the game will be most of the time enjoyable and a good experience, if a killer hit and survivor use deadhard at the exact same time (same frame), the dead hard will appear 40ms earlier than the hit on survivor screen while the hit will appear 40ms earlier on killer screen, which means the hit will connect on his screen and survivor will go down, without even triggering dead hard, while survivor will see a deadhard + a hit that didn't connect on his screen but still killed him. The issue remains the same as if the host was the killer as every hits is coded on his side and will still connect on his screen, and the higher the killer's latency is, the higher the amount of bs will happen on survivors screens. 
---
So as of now servers will help for connection stability and clear all the random disconnects that can happen when a host was laggy, and will mean dbd devs can actually take action against people that disconnect way too often as it will be clear it's done on purpose now. 
---
For all the hitboxes/hit detection to work well and to be fair for everyone (both killer and survivors) everything would need to be coded server-sided as most competitive games, but it isn't the case for now. BHVR still said they will look at it in the future on their forums, but it will sadly be in a long time. You can read more here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87216/
---
Uh yeah it is, it's a central location with a limited number of paths you can take out of it.  Getting a basement hook as trapper or hag is almost always a guaranteed snowball, camping or not.
---
You know, your experience with Killer will for sure help you with survior and vice versa.
---
I was the opposite I hated player killer, untill i kept at it and at it. 
---
Now i happily play both. Its okay to go down and die quickly, there's no loss in experience, you either win or you learn :)

ik this is irrelevant but on what platform are you playing? 'cause on console, purple ranks it's one of the worst experience ever
---
either players that are desperately trying to get into red ranks asap, the match lasting less than 5 minutes or players that don't give 2 shit and barely trying 'cause they wanna de-rank to greens

What happened to poor Hag üòÆ
---
That's so cool!
---
Everyone I know uses Dead Hard wrong or never plans for a killer anticipating and playing around it
---
PS4
---
Well. I‚Äôm not saying this is okay to do, and you‚Äôll definitely get a lot of hate for it, but what my bf does to farm bp... is.. well.. he plays leatherface and camps. He usually 4ks and gets at least 20k bp from it. The matches are usually pretty fast and then he puts his bp into his survivors and camps some more lol
---
Bloodlust 3 takes 45 seconds to build up. What the everloving fuck are you doing circling an unsafe pallet for 45 seconds?? Just drop it and run to the next pallet.
---
Thing about maps with unsafe pallets, they have 30 of em. You should be fine to burn through those pallets. Not like they were good for mindgaming anyway if they're so unsafe.
---
Safe pallets are pallets with little to no mindgame potential for the killer. The killer can only really follow the survivor in these situations and wait for the pallet drop or an opportunity to open up (which is rare against good survivors). This a survivor can run the loop around the pallet with little worry of injury.
---
Idk why I saw so much hate on this in the lower comment section. It‚Äôs absolutely amazing! Your mom did awesome, hope you had a good birthday :)
---
Can someone link me the video I can‚Äôt find it
---
Or both.
---
But that's against the killer rules, you're not allowed to do that.
---
The PTSD is too much
---
That is absolutely not why lol.
---
He's complaining about # of pallets, not the effectiveness of pallets.
---
True then I camp them
---
Depending on the map it absolutely can be.  Like the basement is literally in the center of rotten fields and wrecking yard.
---
Just... amazing
---
Yeah the key to my house is bigger than my hand. /s
---
A new survivor perk can just be added then. Saving someone from the basement teleports both of you to the surface.
---
Because swf can't abuse the system anymore.
---
I don't think the emblem system is the reason killer wait times are so long.
---
 This can't be real  
---
That only happens, babe  
---
On the movie screen
---
Nurse mains arent people.
---
I dont have a main Killer usually I rotate and play each killer, queue times are fast for me no matter what killer I use.
---
But it's great as it is it doesn't need a buff...
---
This has very little to do with dead by daylight
---
Does this qualify for a unexpected thanos?
---
I‚Äôd bet more people quit this game because of nurse
---
This is a console clip...
---
puppers on twitch he plays lots of different killers and I also recommend otzdarva as he is a genius on all killers except for maybe hag
---
if your idea of balancing a perk is creating another one that directly counters it, you're doing it wrong.
---
AMEN BROTHER HH
---
I feel like most swf I go up against at least one has an insta heal
---
also the nerfs arent even that big
---
ok cool and thanks
---
Good riddance. :)
---
:(
---
Ah. So it is...
---
Well I'm just bad I guess haha
---
Only two killers deserve the ‚ÄúOP‚Äù label. Spirit, and Plague. Keem should probably get someone to help him learn to play.
---
That's what they do with killers. Hag is countered by urban evasion. Doctor by calm spirit. Ect.
---
I wasnt around back then, but were some of the stronger survivor perks like DS, BT, and the rest in the game at that point? Even then, theres more bad players than good players. Killer is much easier at a low level than survivor is. Rank 20 killers can get 4ks just by w+m1 the entire match because rank 20 survivors aren't hard to catch, and will make poor decisions more often. As soon as you reach a rank where survivors actually know what they're doing that's probably when that percentage of dying survivors goes way down.
---
maybe i'm just unlucky and ranked too fast but believe me, purples is horrifying for me
---
but i can agree green isn't different from yellow at all
---
personally, red isn't that bad tho, maybe i'm just used facing the same tryharding swf or killers with the most broken add-ons
---
Otzdarva
---
So you're just making it diet adrenaline?  
---
How is this a buff, it's completely different from the original effect.
---
This is just sprint burst but nerfed.  Make it 5 seconds and it would be somewhat viable  but still way too situational
---
happy 8th birthday!
---
I can say with relative confidence that this is worse than what we have now
---
I would be ok with this
---
I think it's fine the way it is. Can't count the amount of times I'm in a chase and a gen pops and it made juking the killer so much easier
---
Spoiler! Ash is in it for like 2 seconds. The reboot that is.
---
Idc if there‚Äôs more pallets I‚Äôll just chase the person who overuses pallets and destroy the pallets
---
Its already a good perk. Especially with freddy
---
Those counter killers (i guess?) not other perks, and it's not like they released nea with the Hag.
---
Buffing an already very good meta perk?  NICEEEEE
---
Huntress should have a more complex version of her lullaby that would get more intense over the duration of the chase :)
---
They‚Äôre always live for the Switch due to it‚Äôs lack of DbD‚Äôs P2P system
---
The problem with Discordance is that the perk is more powerful at lower Tiers. So the first version is just a flipped version of the original perk.
---
There are also perks that counter other perks.
---
&gt;I'm trying to find good killer streamers/youtubers that play Plague, Doctor, Hillbilly or Pig extensively and well. Do you guys have any recommendations? Thanks in advance!
---
For Hillbilly you won't find a better streamer than https://www.twitch.tv/ryanpez69.
---
For Pig you won't find a better streamer than https://www.twitch.tv/scorpionz. 
---
Don't know about Plague or Doctor.
---
I wasn't reffering to the "Keemstar"-dude or whatever he calls himself but to Arilyde's statement of Killers feeling op when you're new at the game.
---
Thought that was kinda obvious to be honest.
---
It's a known fact that Discordance gets *worse* at it's higher Tiers. The first buff idea is flipping to so that the higher Tiers are actually better.
---
&gt;Dude fuck off it's just a meme jeez
---
Sure... sure.
---
Who buys the higher tier version anymore? It doesn't need a buff. I could name other perks who need one way more then discordance
---
Lol nobody cares about team work
---
Nice. Good luck, let us know how it goes.

That's because you didn't use "Head On".
---
There is also instantgaming where you can get steam keys cheaper, roughly between 20-40% reduction
---
Told a purple ranked SWF good game even tho they were toxic, and I was genuine they outplayed me. And first survivor says ‚Äúyour gay‚Äù and second survivor sends a picture of a monkeys ass. I replied have a nice vacation last time I try to be nice.
---
Matchmaking is actually nice,  you can only get 6 levels up or below your current rank
---
I didn't loop the pallet for so long. I looped it for like 10 seconds, dropped it and then the bloodlusting began. There was nothing else nearby and he knew that, so I was stuck at the pallet cause if I tried to leave it I'd get downed. If I stayed I'd get downed but I'd be able to delay it at least. He didn't mind game the pallet at all just held W. I spent like a minute running around and vaulting the dropped pallet, he missed like 2 swings.
---
The point is that it's a flaw that the Tier 1 version of the perks is best, meaning it should be fixed. And if you want more ideas just go through my account because I have thousands of different buffs.
---
DerpGoose223 already explained it pretty well, unsafe pallets are just pallets that Killers can easily punish you for playing around at, whilst the safe pallets are those where a forced drop is more or less requiered.
---
A unsafe pallet is no actuall threat to a Killer as it's quite easy to get that hit, even when you've to eat a stun for that.
---
Safe pallets, like the common loop-pallets, the god-pallet (Killer shack) and the typical T-wall pallets for example, are pallets at which the Killer can't play around by cutting ways and such. You're literally forced to run after that Survivor until you get close enough that they literally have to drop it or get hit.
---
Justice for Quentin
---
Okay, wtf
---
Killer with a knife? Must be dbd related!  This is garbage.
---
I know how bad old hag was cause I played her. And i don‚Äôt think balancing should work around the lower half of players. Low tier killers aren‚Äôt viable against good survivors.
---
maybe am but do i really care? no
---
Why did you add half of surveillance to it?  
---
Correcting how long the aura is highlighted makes sense but adding another facet to it doesn't.
---
Monto the one and only
---
I just stopped caring.  I play friendly killer and focus on hooks and BP.  Most survivors aren‚Äôt very good anyways.  It really comes down to map layout and how focused the survivors are on gens.
---
Just remember, either you have a good game or you die-pip.  It‚Äôs a win win.
---
Dbd invented the idea of killers with knives, didn't you know?
---
Then don't comment..
---
X2 :u
---
What happens after 99?
---
Literally incredible is that survivor dwight? And the killer behind him is trapper?
---
"18" she even put your rank in there! How sweet!
---
Considering it‚Äôs so difficult and takes 3-4 gens just to get to tier 3.... it‚Äôs pretty balanced.  Most games multiple survivors get out, but 1/5 games id say I have the chance to get the 4K but the last survivor just Dcs or jumps in a locker
---
100 and then u can prestige and go back to 1
---
You either die as Syka, or live long enough to become a Blyat. Dunno why it came on my mind, lol.
---
Otzdarva, he‚Äôs just a fuckin mad lad with pretty much every killer
---
yes.
---
I agree. There are a lot of names that could have been acceptable because there are 4 movies but Jed really isn't one of them.
---
$5 mask at Walmart, Knife was $3. All I need is the cloak and I'll be set.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll be sure to!
---
Personally I think they're viable with any killer but I've got 2.4k hours so maybe that's just me. 
---
But instead of buffing killers as a whole, let's just buff those specific killers. Killers vs survivors in general mechanics is relatively fair
---
You can sort of rank up like that but pipping gets more and more strict the closer to red you get.  I think he'd hit his lame stride around rank 10 and then it's all just ENTITY DISPLEASED or safety pips unless he learns to play the game.
---
It is
---
HMMMMM

If I had to give a rarity to how much I see them it would be uncommon not everyone has one but you're not surprised at all when you see one.

---
I was insulted for not using my chainsaw for every hit as LF
---
Just run lightborne 4head
---
He is much easier to learn than before the rework, but he still has a slight learning curve
---
More fun than getting trolled by survivors.
---
OmgImBlurry plays most killers (I think she just avoids clown and nurse) . It‚Äôs usually a pretty small stream too so if your looking for pointers she watches chat pretty we
---
I had a game the other day where as a rank 1 survivor was paired with a rank 14 killer. So the cap doesn't always work.
---
Yea when i barely started i quickly learned how to counter it
---
I'm 100% sure this comes from people not wanting to "waste" their perk. Which I get because sometimes I run Solidarity then another injured person starts healing me and I'm like "Wait. Stop!". Lol. 
---
But this damn obsession with survivors using perks just because they can. Self-Care and Inner Strength are great *situational* perks but some players insist on forcing perk usage in a game.
---
Happens to me frequently on the switch version
---
BHVR hire me
---
That‚Äôs so cute
---
Really dude... Xbox?
---
Agree wholeheartedly. I'm speaking mostly as a survivor main and I'm not a good player by any means even with 700+ hours. There's so much of a learning curve not just to simply play the game, but also for learning how to play well with other survivors.
---
I really wish that the devs could work on a way to rank players entirely by their devotion score. The devotion score seems to be based on your total play time from what I can tell. Total play time is all that matters in the end to be a decent player that can work well with others.
---
It would be great to have no devotion score to devotion 1 playing together to get an understanding of mechanics. Devotion 1-3 play together to kind of learn all the "unspoken" (DONT UNHOOK ME WITHOUT BT THE KILLER IS RIGHT THERE WTF CMON) rules. Devotion 3-god know what number people have reached all sit in a big (fairly knowledgeable) pool and play together. No more rank reset, no more sad times at red rank.
---
To be honest I think many Survivors struggle especially with decision making.
---
I agree that camping made pipping sometimes too easy, but that's not because of camping itself but Survivors misjudging their capabillities.
---
I lost count on the scenario where one Survivor was literally facecamped to death and 2 out of 3 remaining Survivors kept chilling around the hook and wait for a good unhook that won't appear in the first place. If they would've done gens instead, they could've easily got away with the Killer obtaining just one, cheap sacrifice.
---
Not my version üëÜ
---
Yes finally! The killer jumpscare perk I've always wanted!
---
LOOK AT THAT LITTLE TRAPPER OMFG
---
Tell your mom that she should open up an etsy because I wanna eat that lil cutie right up
---
I'd argue it's still wrong.
---
There's a lot more that goes into a 20 hour player thinking killer is OP than safe and unsafe pallets. Most killers at that range don't even know the difference.
---
&gt;No, I‚Äôm on PS4 but I am appearing off-line
---
When playing in SWF I rarely encounter this bug since my friends are usually hosting the lobby but, playing while offline on steam makes thing work somewhat buggy. 
---
When I am soloing this bug also happens to me. Maybe try to play a session without being offline to see if anything changes?
---

I don‚Äôt know weather to eat it or submit it to cake boss

---
Did he have a pallet smashed too hard on his head?
---
I thought I was losing my mind yesterday, when I started phasing in front of a locker I was stuck in place.
---
Considering they announced to make it so players literally can't be matchmaked when the rank-gap exceeds 6, I think that especially players that are mid-rank will get lobbies much faster. Simply because they're at the very middle.
---
Obviously they also have the disadvantage that the ranks of the players they get matchmaked with can vary even more, but when it comes up to just finding a lobby, the mid-rank players will have the easiest time I suppose.
---
new nerf‚Äîsurvivors have no head and therefor have no vision and constantly spew bloodtrails behind them. they also just die. balanced
---
Giving 150 Haste for **5 seconds** is worse than loosing your Scratch Marks for 10 seconds? Really!? I admit that this isn't a revolutionary idea, but at least the perk wouldn't be actual garbage.
---
They have it and it's a bad perk. Its resilience
---
those fuckin CROWS!
---
That‚Äôs what flashlights and pallet drops are for. So yeah it‚Äôs better, but harder.

Honestly I‚Äôm not sure

I‚Äôm guessing u play DBD and not much else lol

You could just open the Steam overlay while searching for a match, assuming you‚Äôre on PC.

Please tell me that is not real
---
Will that cake be eaten by daylight?
---
I like this one the best.
---
I never said that this was the one and only reasoning.
---
Obviously, players that are new at the game are just overwhelmed and tend to be much more cautious. A inexperienced Survivor that gets into the TR will probably immediately look for cover and stop progressing that gen, even when the Killer is obviously chasing someone else at the moment.
---
I can remember when I started this game when it just got out of the beta. I pissed my pants all the time I was facing Wraith, just because I wasn't used to the environment and atmosphere of the game.

That is so cool, your mom is awesome!

So with my aura idea, it would be mad annoying to have the visuals active for 18 seconds. So instead of how long the visuals being active for a long time, I added the same effect Surveillance has. If you have a better idea I'd love to hear it because that was the best I could think of right now.
---
Yeah but the hatch requires looking for the hatch and they have to wait for it to spawn. Both offerings are broken and tip the favor of the game towards one side or the other.
---
I run DS for two reasons. Tunneling killers and teammates who make shitty unhooks.
---
You don't need pallet nor need the killer to be looking at you for the perk to work. So it's better.
---
The old switcheroo
---
Happy birthday you got a face camping bubba
---
then i'm telling you, you are incorrect, you're philosophy will never let you improve, figure out how to rank up at that rank then adjust as you move up, saying this is unfair i don't want to change for this part, i'm SO MUCH BETTER is literally the same thing as, i'm only in this low rank because my teammates always suck.
---
Hanukkah came early
---
Chase music yes, Terror Radius tho...I don't know.
---
Remember when every Killer had his very unique hooks?
---
The reason why they removed that and made them map-tied instead, is because Survivors could immediately identify the Killer even when s/he hasn't even been sighted so far.
---
Sure, in terms of stealth Killers it wouldn't do much as their radius is tiny anyway, but I'm not sure if Survivors being able to reveal the Killers identity immediately just by happening to be in the TR is a good thing.
---
Doubt
---
No.  If you yourself have as little regard for balance as the devs, sure, but a guaranteed 4K is literally never going to be reasonable.
---
Nice edit bro
---
Yes! Oh sweet spider Cthulhu please let them hide this man to make chase music!
---
It happens when the queue times are long enough from what I've seen. We are talking about DBD here though, one of the most bug infested games in the known universe.
---
Its that a totem? How awesome üòÇ
---
Ahaha, yeah dying early sucks if you really care about rank. But on the other side you get to play the game for the full duration. You can tell your friends I looped a guy for 5 gens or this one
---
This is awesome
---
omfg that sassy lounging Hag!?!? Your mom has GOT it!
---
Objective fact is something that is statistically proven. Saying lvl discordance is better than lvl 3 because it gives you more notifications is not objective fact, it is subjective opinion. If you're old enough to play DBD, you should be older than 10 year old, grow up and stop that "if you don't agree with me then you are just wrong, period" nonsense. Have a good day.
---
I pointed to the door before this soooo I guess he just wanted to make me sad and kill me just as I opened it
---
I carried a Meg to a gate a while back, let her struggle free and she ran away from the already open gate to the other, unopened gate.  The EGC had started a bit earlier so I was like... what is she doing?  There's no way she has enough time to get to the other gate, open it and escape.  She did get to the other gate, she did open it, but she was killed by the entity about 5 feet from exiting.  I was just in awe.  And it wasn't like she was trying to do a daily.  She opened the other gate too.  I messaged her after trying to figure out what she was thinking and she just replied saying gg and that she was so scared and it was super intense so, hey, I guess she had fun.
---
This guy is on the verge of nutting every time he says entitled
---
Yep lol
---
Can‚Äôt help but smile at all the detail and effort put into this! Not only did was this homemade but she really went out of her way to create a cake based on something YOU love (and not something she wants you to like..) that women LOVES you and I adore this cake so much! I read a comment saying she wants to open up a bakery? Tell her I hope she gets that opportunity one day soon. Talent and the love that went into making this cake is not found everyday. Also happy birthday to you OP!
---
Hot DAMN that looks great!
---
Yeah, bummer. But you got out XD 
---
Rest of the team not so lucky lol
---
&gt; I feel like Im forced to drop loop pallets early because he can fake his charge with seemingly 0 punishment
---
Just run the loop like normal but focus your position on the end points of the loop to prevent Shred hitting you. I have literally never been hit by Shred at a loop before (I barely have been hit by it at all because of how fucking easy it is to juke)
---
And god forbid a terrible killer like Demodoggo (and he is fucking awful) have anything in its base kit like the ability to fake to help out
---
&gt; and he is also 115% even though he has map traversal and a gap closer ability
---
His map traversal via portals fucking sucks and largely sits in the hands of survivors
---
&gt; Am I just super boosted (Red Rank BTW)?
---
To be frank, yeah probably
---
Dedicated servers are fucking great, i have nice ping and lower queue times as a killer, no one is talking about it wtf.
---
Then just don't say anything, spam is pointless.
---
I don't care for rank and it still sucks to be tunnelled by a toxic killer.
---
Which begs the question "Why does it exist in the first place?"
---
It's the same with the DC button, why do we have it?
---
I know right .-.
---
This made my day again
---
there are more iconic scooby doo villains than this thing.
---
hhmm. I see. When I turned the game to all the down I reach over 100 for a bit. Guess I changed something else too. XD
---
Double PIP game too. Got me to my rank 4 lol
---
Nice haha
---
https://youtu.be/nUeI4RnT1KU
---
They probably wanted to save the person because getting camped is no fun.  The killer can literally just take you out of a game.
---
!!!
---
31 seconds in, AND WE HAVE REACHED THE PROMISED LAND!
---
I disagree
---
I would prefer those over this.
---
Cool idea, but I feel like it could be a little bit stronger then the devs would want it to be. One of the trappers main things is that he has to take time to get traps to place them. It would make the early game with trapper very easy to deal with as you could trap up the loops very quickly and move on to patrolling gens. Effectively removing the time that survs would normally be able to get gens done or find ruin etc. meaning build focused on gen slowdown could be super strong on him with this. It‚Äôs a interesting concept, but as someone who plays a ton of both roles, I just feel like it would be too strong. I personally love having to manage my traps as well as gen pressure when I play trapper. Makes him more fun to play. As for the default add-on of logwood, I think that is just broken considering what I pointed out already. He would move much higher up on the tier list if this were to happen. Perhaps just under spirit (perhaps, just my opinion) in strength if a good player is playing him.
---
TLDR: Cool idea but too op pls nerf
---
&gt; Only two killers deserve the ‚ÄúOP‚Äù label. Spirit, and Plague.
---
Ye spirit and plague... plague... lol.
---
I can‚Äôt type lmao it was supposed to say rubber banding
---
YEET!
---
Never go into the jungle jim (the two L) because you will get a hit 100% of the time and if you are at the shack..just throw down the pallet. He can be looped around short places, you have to understand how quickly he can do his lunge attack
---
It's just a build in a video game mate, it's not unreasonable to play a build, in other games wouldn't you push the meta? Certainly wouldn't -rep someone for it.
---
My ass is thicc
---
Nice read.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm just curious why he waited if he was going to attack you lol 
---
to be rude
---
Be like me.  Play David King to start with.  Use Were Gonna Live Forever.  Farm the other survivors.   Laugh as you unhook them in front the killer, doesn't matter you got your stack...  Muhahahaha.    I joke...
---
These buffs don‚Äôt make him Spirit tier at all. Logwood Dye is still noticeable unlike Tar Bottle.
---
survivor bad
---
Dont forget tony hawk
---
Tombstone piece doesn‚Äôt, but Judith‚Äôs Tombstone does
---
once i unhooked someone with WMI and they stood still so i thought they wanna be healed but they actually insta-healed themselves, i remained perplexed...
---
you said 3 seconds at first.  Running Sprint burst+current poised is actually a very good combo too.
---
Derankers gotta derank
---
You mean under? Maybe, I didn't get too high as a survivor yet so maybe in the higher ranks they do; but that doesnt make sense because then they would only get one kill and the rest would escape.
---
I'm pretty sure that's what the debate is about, nobody wants the unholy trinity of nurse, spirit, and Billy buffed. Just more diversity in high ranks.
---
Honestly? I thought at first it was supposed to be a dirty joke, connected to masturbation, but with the finger being salty it didnt make sense, since it wouldnt be salty then.. xD I didnt connect the the dots with salty as being emotions Kate felt lol.
---
Tell your mom that a stranger on the internet thinks she's awesome
---
Not good enough.
---
WHY PUTTING HIM DOWN
---
The camper isn't the blame as much as the teammates that aren't capitalizing on that time.
---
Spies from the Shadows gang rise up
---
 People saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard mode‚Äù hard mode always had benefits in like every single game..... having the bloodpoints buff would be great.
---
Still pissed about how bad the dream snare add ons are blindness??? Hemorrhage??? Seriously no exhausted or even mangled or an extra hindered effect no give us both of the worst effects
---
Wake up
---
&gt; I think the current amount of pallets is fine. Any more and bad survivors start extending chases way more than should be.
---
If ruin is down the shitty survs can already run pallet to pallet and the gens will be done before they run out.
---
No teabagging and no flashlight flicking. :3 I‚Äòm also a Killer Main (don‚Äòt Feed the Meme! I‚Äòm Spirt Main XD) and hate that behavior... no need for.
---
Happy Birthday Lewis!
---
Ah okay, figured as much. Thought it was because of the content i usually make
---
Two of the best loops are gone :(.
---
Good job but why even mention they had D strike?  It's not a toxic perk anymore.
---
Wouldn't Negan fit better as a killer? Whistling similar to Huntress and beating a survivor's face in as his Mori.
---
&gt; The killer is supposed to kill you, that's how the game is designed.
---
Pretty sure devs said they're going for a 2 survive, 2 sacrifice balance.
---
Shut up
---
Might be the move from the look of it.
---
These are all great ideas and the fact that people think these are to strong in anyway fucking baffles me it‚Äôs like those bozos that think making Bubbas chainsaw work with Franklins is op LIKE IN WHAT UNIVERSE IS THAT OP???
---
The instaheals are op
---
Imagine complaining about DS in 2019.
---
&gt; Can you share a video? I honestly dont think Ive ever not been hit by Shred.
---
I could save one next time I play against it, I guess. But I rarely see any Demos anymore. People stopped playing it within a day or two because he sucks so much.
---
He sucks so much that all the major streamers had their titles pointing out that people stopped playing Demo for like an entire week
---
&gt; Imo hes a top 5 killer right now. Emphasis on opinion
---
Utter insanity. No emphasis on opinion.
---
&gt; Destroying portals is a decent chunk of time and his traversal creates a lot of pressure on certain maps.
---
Without add-ons to increase the cleansing time it does not take long at all. Even with them it's rather negligible. And if a power's strength is map dependent, then it is not strong in any capacity
---
We'll see where it goes ! Thank you again for the support mate !
---
If I am correct, you used the burning splinter and still got into a game as wraith?
---
There are 15 pallets on a map, it's not that big of a deal
---
Have you seen him with his hag? He‚Äôs literally insane with her
---
Otzdarva, he's fun to watch and explains every action. Why he did ABC action that way, why hes running XYZ perks, the goal of running said perks, etc. He doesnt always run the same meta perks so you get to see multiple builds.
---
Its always a fun learning experience with him.
---
A nice nea.  God bless, we need more of em.
---
I have downed and picked up so many new players, trying to carry them to hatch and they just blindly run off. Half the time, they run back where we came from, and I KNOW there's no hatch, so I have to actually make them wiggle off somewhere where it might be more tempting to run where we haven't yet been.
---
I don't derank on purpose, the matchmaking's just fucked, and when I know I'm playing against a new survivor, I try my best to make sure they get the hatch if anyone
---
Who would you rate higher than demo? The only people I can certainly say are stronger are Nurse, Billy, Spirit, and Huntress. I dont play most of the other killers though.
---
Sometimes camping is the obviously strategically correct play though. I recently played a game where there were 2 hooks essentially in an alleyway of the map. I hooked one in the back of the alleyway and on my way back to the center of the map some dumbass was out in the open beelining for the unhook, INJURED. I downed and hooked him in the same alleyway. If I just stood there, easy 2k.
---
Dumbass number 3 crouchwalks towards me, in plain view, so now there are 3 people sitting here confirmed doing nothing and they haven't even finished 2 gens yet. I of course just camped it. First hook died, second hook went to stage 2, dumbass #3 got close enough to him for me to get a hit, and soon after I had my 4k.
---
Of course they complained that I didn't pull punches for their handicapped friends.
---
I got up to 7 playing bubba like that (fuck u btw ahahaha u mad bro)
---
People that say u cant rank up camping are wrong, u just wont double pip and will get quite a few safeties. 
---
I wasnt using addons but i bet u could go higher with charge speeds. 
---
Picked billy and double pipped all the way to 4 in cpl hrs, waay easier to rank up. But more people survived matches.
---
I said maybe :)
---
Real fact: If they keep dedicated server at the current state, people will start quitting
---
Fair enough though the original guy was saying that killers are incredibly underpowered and need buffs. Not weak killers, killers as a whole. 
---
Personally I've never had the diversity issue in my high survivor ranks in my experience (recently that is, pre 2.0 fair enough) though I get it's a problem for many so I agree. I hope the nurse changes help out with nurse, and spirit gets some respectful changes as well. 
---
Personally I'd prefer doctor and plague reworks but that's just me :3
---
Imagine mistaking them mentioning it as complaining.
---
Not op at all this would just make him high mid tier seriously this wouldn‚Äôt make him Billy tier and not even Freddy or Huntress tier maybe Hag tier at best seriously none of these things make him op he still has to place traps and take time placing them but now he doesn‚Äôt have to walk across the map to get them also the deep wounds is just added pressure is probably never gonna down someone and the traps being darker just means you have to keep an eye out on no wya are a couple small changes gonna make a D tier character OP
---
Survivor main making the meme, it's me
---
Not complaining bout it, just said it felt good, didn‚Äôt even get hit by it
---
Not really, I didn't even check who was the creator. I just have a really dirty mind, I make my own "content" xD so that's why i got confused ^^"
---
Bhvr is so wholesome. They could easily copyrighted this guy, but instead they came up to him to ask if they could share his song &lt;3
---
"Favorite Stalk Boi"
---
Ghostface: Am I a joke to you?
---
Imagine mentioning DS as if it was an op perk
---
Pulled a Jane off a pallet and they got stuck on my shoulder. The game thought they were only injured, and since I couldn't drop or hook them, I had to wait until the End Game Collapse. But here comes this bitch ass Nea who uses a key, keeping me stuck in that game. Nea, if you are out there, I hate you. 
---
(What was especially weird was that I came out of phase as spirit the moment a pallet dropped and didn't get stunned, then when Jane was stuck on my shoulder, I couldn't be stunned at all)
---
Failure is part of getting better. It doesn't help that it takes a lot of playtime to get better since being new to the game means you aren't familiar with tilesets, pallet locations, windows or even how to efficiently move, so you go down in no time in chase, meaning you get no time to practice.
---
Don't worry, it gets better the more you play
---
Jeez I hate black survivors
---
Please share your killers with me, I only ran into spirits all day yesterday :[
---
I‚Äòm often solo q‚Äòing, and that happens way too often
---
&gt; There‚Äôs no counter to her.
---
Except you know, looping.
---
She still has to catch you to m1.
---
Ye if you play immersed all the time, shes going to suck to play against but anyone who knows how to loop, even slightly, wont have a bad time.
---
oh, you are gonna get people crying in the comments because you said decisive strike lol
---
Cheeto
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddaxl3/so_like_a_glitch_happened/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Is there any cake under that playdoh?
---
Or because your teammate threw down all the pallets in a single chase, leaving you more or less defenseless between any stretch of windows
---
I dont know about that to be honest, I'd like to make totems more of a valueable alternative instead of an absolute must-do.
---
Simply because it doesn't "force" a new flow of the game but simply grants more options to play.
---
When a Survivor wants to sit on a gen for 2 and a half minutes, sure. When a Survivor prefers to do all the bones so the gens
---
can be done much faster later on, it's fine aswell.
---
Every totem locking a generator completely would cause Killers to roam totems 24/7 until they're done, which's the very same thing they're already doing with gens.
---
But I still appreciate the idea~
---
I‚Äôve been having the opposite. Rank 5-7 survivors when I‚Äôm rank 12-10
---
Yeah for 60 seconds against someone who ran into your trap so most likely you‚Äôll be chasing said person and news flash a downed survivor is t gain be effected by blindness to much the only way this can work is if you down someone and them immediately chase someone else into a trap but that doesn‚Äôt stop anyone else from picking him up they need to make it last for like 120 seconds before it starts even being slightly useful
---
The spirit wrecks everyone! It‚Äôs like a rite of passage type of deal. Things are gonna happen and your gonna have good games and your gonna have horrible games but it‚Äôs all a lesson. You need both the good and bad experiences so that you can learn from them and become better. You will also notice that your fellow survivors also fuck up here and there, we all do but just remember don‚Äôt give up, don‚Äôt lose hope and keep on trying. With time u will get better. 
---
Also don‚Äôt let the salty messages get to u, those will definitely come so prepare for those
---
I get rank 18 teammates as a red rank survivor.
---
Devs will refund you bloodpoints for lost progress I think, try submitting a ticket on their website.
---
DS is clutch when playing with low rank friends
---
I main Ghostface and Freddy at red ranks without Ruin. Purple and green are more toxic than red. People imagine red as this cesspool of toxicity and negativity, but the vast majority of the time it's "gg" and done.
---
4 minutes? Oi you've got it good

Known bug :p

Keemstar is a clown and not a good one at that

Funnest Killer to Play: Hag and Plag  
---
Funnest Killer to Survive: Myers  
---
\*I'm on PC.
---
Lobby dodging. Hmm.
---
You cant say self-care is crap and then suggest botany knowledge.
---
Of course if you bring a good medkit with good addons, that would be sufficient. But youre not going to have infinite good medkits and infinite good addons. Self-care is infinite and has no restrictions and no limit. 
---
You dont have to run up to a teammate, you dont need to make sure you have enough charges and you dont need to worry about how much self-care you have. 
---
Healing is a big thing. When youre full health you can actually play the game instead of having to play not risky. Depending on teammates isnt consistent and will usually eat up more time than self-care would have took. (SC is also safer)
---
SC is just the best healing perk. You use it right there and then. You dont need anything else, not even an item. Which means youre not restricted for your item slot. If you spend 40 seconds healing yourself and then get chased for longer than 40 seconds, your investment in time just tripled
---
If that killer was brought into the game I would cry if I had to go against him as a survivor..
---
Somewhere there's a game in this bug
---
It's disgusting since it barely has anything to do to his main power and you fall asleep every minute, in other words it's wake up and waste time or do the gen asleep and also waste time, it's extremely disgusting with stuff like Dying light or thanatophobia. I didn't even mention the Red paint box which doesn't allow people to wake up with skill checks and can be combined with the Swing chains. It's absolutely disgusting.
---
As opposed to games where you just get a 4k slug
---
I mean, you kinda lose any credibility when you try to say a low tier perk is unbalanced. There‚Äôs a reason you don‚Äôt see NOED ran by high ranks killers often, and that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a shit perk
---
I‚Äôll submit a ticket and tell you what happens, thank you for the reply :)
---
What about your matchmaking time as killer?
---
Ah, k
---
Yeah I kind of agree it would be cool
---
It doesn't matter that the other 3 crank out gens to the one getting facecamped.
---
Just don't let her puke on you lol
---
I suppose so, as I said I don't think it should be purple since it isn't that strong but I just think it's alright.
---
Ok then on the other side of the spectrum, how can you find a totem and let you clense it?
---
Unique chase music has been a wish the community has assumed was in vain. Now it's possibly happening for real!
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll be sure to tell her of you guy‚Äôs support :D
---
The reason people say they are underpowered is because quite a few are not usable at higher ranks without either using an extremely specific build, or by using ultra rates, which shouldn‚Äôt be the case
---
&gt; The reason why they removed that and made them map-tied instead, is because Survivors could immediately identify the Killer even when s/he hasn't even been sighted so far.
---
You can identify plague, pig, trapper, huntress, demogorgon, freddy, legion with certain addons, myers, nurse, billy and spirit all without seeing them.
---
I completely agree, green ranks suck bc killers can still pip just barely by camping so you see it every other game and red ranks suck bc killers are running iridescent king and prayer beads every match. I tried to depip from rank 1 but devs started giving me pips after I kept DCing.
---
Nothing more scary than not being able to see what‚Äôs behind you. Totally agree.
---
Should‚Äôve let him wiggle. RIP Dweet
---
I waited 20 minutes earlier today. 10-15 minutes is average for me
---
I meant unbalanced in a way of being just unhealthy for the game - killers shouldnt be rewarded for failing in their objective at least not to this extent like fire up could use a slight buff
---
Also thats totally not the target of the rant
---
Honestly it‚Äôs a pretty good strategy that works in many video games. Pretend you know where something is and then the enemy will run to it to defend it. Now you know the location of something, even though you were just bluffing.

It'd be neat but goodbye mind gaming loops and spatial awareness.
---
I play survivor mostly but that‚Äôs because I enjoy playing the game with friends more. I can‚Äôt say no to a game as my teapot boi though! :D
---
They  could do it like Dying Light so if you press a certain button you look behind you
---
Also don't seal portals unless you absolutely need to. If you can complete a gen and he has a portal near it then he can't move it. He gets them back when they get sealed.
---
Yeah, I don't get the love for pallets. Experienced survivors can usually identify the fake ones, and you have to break a lot of pallets to set dream pallets in realistic spots. Breaking lots of pallets = losing at high ranks. Freddy is much better off with Enduring/Bamboozle since the snares don't deal with jungle gyms that well.
---
Nice
---
I will keep him forever &lt;3
---
Fuck ups are gonna happen...your gonna fuck up, your teammates gonna fuck up...even the killer fucks up. Fuck ups just happen. As long as your not intentionally sabotaging the game for your fellow teammates you‚Äôre all good.
---
Wait till u get to the point that your notice that your fellow teammates fuck up much more than you. I‚Äôm a survivor main and have been playing since June and I‚Äôm now noticing that a lot of times my teammates are worse than I am so I take solace in that
---
If ruin is down they can get far more than 3 gens. There are a lot of pallets.
---
I'll usually give up chase if ruin is gone, since they usually create a deadzone on one side of the map anyway.
---
I‚Äôve talked about it to my mom because of all the licensed killers. Whenever I play she just asks what the screaming is about, and when I tell her she just says okay lmao.
---
I honestly disagree with everything in this post
---
Perfection
---
Lowkey true I‚Äôm honestly not very good and I‚Äôm still rank 1 survivor on console rn somehow
---
I will never get idiots.
---
Happy birthday!
---
Just look up Tru3 Talent . He streams and also post youtube videos a lot. He is really good with all killers. 
---
Hybrid Panda is also fun to watch and shouldnt be ignored lol
---
I have a controversial and shitty idea for you to counter Object.  Just tunnel the crap out of one of the other survivors, if they have D strike and they use it, then attention seeking object boy loses his fancy perk.  
---
Toxicity to stamp out their toxicity.
---
As opposed to games where survivors are competent in chases, split around the map so I can't easily down multiple people to snowbal and bring unbreakable. Sure if they all bunch up for whatever reason and are bad at chases then healing is good, but at that point nothing that they will do will make them win.
---
They don't have to play it risky, unless it's Nurse or Spirit they aren't at risk.
---
üòÇüëè
---
It's funny that you mention him... I've shamelessly used some his clips and I was totally inspired.
---
Most Gorgons know your going to drop the pallet just to be safe and try and get a bit more distance to the next one, or window. I find it better to fake pulling down the first pallet to see if they go through with their charge. If they do, then 1. you have enough time to get to a safer pallet 2. can loop that pallet all over again this time dropping it on their head because most will swing through it a second time.   
---
For the rest of the game he will start to fall for your mind games. . . This has won me many a game against the beast.  
---
The same strat can be applied to the window at an L T wall. The first time you know your going to get hit with an M1 anyhow, so fake the window if they are going into shred mode. If they go through with it, you now how time to get to the first pallet and you can imply the first pallet drop and do the same thing. 
---
If they lunge neither time they could be running enduring or they are waiting to read your first moves. 
---
I'm Also Red Rank, hope this helped a little bit.
---
How doesnt object of obsession counter stealth killers?
---
How do you believe its not borderline op with ser squads?
---
And lastly how do you justify DC in loading lobbies?
---
Got in 2 games, killer disconnected both time under 15 seconds.
---
Perks don't make you a good player but I will admit it does feel a bit unfair early on while you're playing.  
---
One of my internet besties has a P3 survivor but I doubt he could even break green ranks even if he only played in SWF.
---
Ok right back at you. Why are people defending things like insta heals and keys? Why are people so desperate for an effort free escape that they defend this? The answer to both our questions: Its in the game so we can use it. Neither side is pure of OP stuff that we use to win.
---
Necro but I came across this while playing basement security leatherface.
---
I think a perk that would grant killer interaction with chests would be a better fit. I.E. you could loot chests as killer to make them unlootable for survivor side, and maybe grant addons for use in that trial (You swap them out like with items found in chests) or you simply get them added to your inventory after the match.
---
Thanks I'll try that and letting one go isnt a complete fail especially if it's a choice and a nice gesture for the surv
---
You're right, i confused it with the 2 L but stil..you can't vault the window or you'll get hit
---
And mine was just a statement of what it couldve been and nea being the entitys child is more commonly heard than being toxic to the killer(s)
---
Its not about the recovery of the swing. It's about not getting a free first hit on the unhooker (who you can then commit to chasing and quickly down) thus potentially costing you a LOT more time than it took them to mend. Think of how much longer a good survivor can drag out a chase if they are healthy than if they start out hurt with the killer on their tail and they still have to make it to a loop. 
---
Not that hitting the unhooked person is never a smart idea, just that you need to read the situation very carefully as a killer. And imo the safest bet is to completely ignore the unhooked person unless they literally run right into your (and even then I try to wait 15 secs for BT to be over)
---
I never play against a killer that falls for fakes :(. Also I always run through pallets if I have room or can bait an M1, but then if they dont fall for it I feel like hes so fast and has his charge that I have to drop the pallet the 2nd time around. If the loops are small theyre unsafe, if theyre long then he has time to charge and hit you pretty consistently.
---
That's a good bottom line I wish I'd thought of it just gets very stressful seeing gens fly
---
At this point it just seems like he‚Äôs doing this shit to bait this type of behaviour to then use it to stroke his massive ego. What is this even proving? Everyone is different and everyone will always respond to things like Iri heads in a different ways. I know people who DC and I know people who just suck it up and play it out.
---
The fact after everyone DCs and he is all ‚ÄúONE ADD ON, NO PERKS‚Äù over and over just proves he‚Äôs trying to get people on his bandwagon.
---
Yeah I usually only cleanse if I have teammates with me, otherwise its back to gens.
---
He didn't get head from Robin either.
---
Camping is fair.........no 
---
Camping is only done by killers who either aren't confident in their abilities, are vengeful because a survivor gave them a hard time, or just isn't that great at securing kills. Even in my early days of playing killer, not once have I ever felt the need to do so because it's just lame for both sides.
---
Why is every suggestion to every strong killer make him 110??? Im not trying to be mean or anything but it‚Äôs really annoying when a strong killer comes out with even slight map pressure and people start suggesting 110% which we don‚Äôt need another 110% killer 110 is so annoying to play and trust me Demo doesn‚Äôt need a nerf he‚Äôs probably only in mid tier right now people just need to learn to deal with him
---
1 the risk is almost entirely negated since an absolutely optimal survivor always sees the killers meaning there is no mindgame potential so the survivor can just move from jungle gyms to pallets and so on, countering isn't bad - negating most of their power entirely is
---
2 seeing where the killer is at all times  gives you so much info the survivors can rush gens or run to optimal loops without even hearing the terror radius
---
3 you are just disrespectful, besides noed is a badly designed perk that promotes bad gameplay
---
I'll just keep playing Nurse, it seems to scare people so much they get a heart attack once downed and leave the game :)
---
I have yet to find the game
---
for me dedicated servers have been perfect
---
I personally would not use shack pallet to save someone, it‚Äôs too valuable
---
Beat me to it
---
I own freddy but haven't played him since day 1 of his buff. How often does teleporting to gens work out? Or is there a strat that helps making it catch survivors easier?
---
You threw it just too early, the killer has to be able to move for it to work properly. I used to miss shit like this all the time but you get used to the timing really quickly. 
---
I think it looked weird because you hit the pallet early and it moved the killer forward and then they started walking.
---
I dont really have a problem with killing survivors when i feel like it, i will take my nurse or spirit and stomp every game 
---
The problem is with my comfort in playing other killers, just kills the joy for me
---
Stoneftw is a small but good streamer he does killer a lot
---
Looking good!
---
Yeah, I emailed him and talked to discord with him aswell, he's pretty cool
---
leatherface‚Äôs chainsaw is already an easy instadown as long as they know how to hug walls properly why would you give him a faster movement speed while revving it up
---
Sound toxic
---
Nah the killer has failed when three or four survivors escape the trial.  The devs have said time and time again the average should be two kills and two escapes.
---
Im not necessarily saying he should be 110%, I just feel like if he's going to be 115% then his power should have a drawback to it, i.e. actually slow him considerably while charging OR make him charge his lunge slower. Those are just off the top of my head, obviously if Nurse can exist then I cant say other killers should be nerfed to the ground.
---
How does me wanting to cleanse equate to not being able to loop? I rarely get sick in the first place BECAUSE I loop her. But LOGICALLY speaking, why would you purposely run around in an extremely vulnerable state?
---
Well the thing that I have noticed is either the lunges are doubled or the sirvivoura are close enough to hit me
---
Multiple chucks dolls across the map, he can switch between them but can only move them when using them. Sabotaging them can temporarily deactivate them but failing a skill check when sabotaging them alerts him to your presence there.
---
You come up with the perks, I‚Äôm done.
---
Did you know that the original was an inside out Cpt. Kirk mask?
---
Hmm...That's weird, shouldn't actually be the case. Especially since Ruin doesn't matter against good Survivors. The high rank Survivors can hit GSC's pretty frequently anyway.
---
What Killer do you tend to play anyway? I just can't imagine that a Survivor is able to kite a Killer properly by instantly dropping a pallet and running to the next.
---
Like, Nurse and Huntress can punish vaults and pallets more or less all the time. Spirit has a pretty high skill floor so I wouldn't be surprised if Spirit was the one you tend to play. Michael has his obvious exposal, GF kinda sucks in those kind of chases but you shouldnt get into those anyway. LF sucks balls and should never ever be played to begin with. Against Clown it's almost impossible to sustain chases for a really long time. As Pig you kind of requiere that charge-hit as a chase initiation, I can see that. Hag gets fucked by that pretty hard as she benefits from Survivors not roaming locations within a chase.
---
So yeah, another reason why you're getting cucked by this so hard might be your preffered Killer choice. MIGHT.
---
*kicks chest*
---
that‚Äôll stop those pesky survivors from stealing my shit
---
Easy Insta down if in the open which this buff won‚Äôt effect bud if a leather Face is chasing any where near a window or pallet then sorry get ready for loop city this buff just gives him more options to deal with loops with his power instead of just turning into a normal m1 killer
---
Honestly that's just dumb. If that's how you wanna play then go ahead. I'd rather not be sick. At least then I have a better chance of actually surviving.
---
I understand that to an extent.  Once I get to rank 5 or higher I feel like I have to play Billy, Freddy or Hag just to keep up with the survivors.  If I roll out my fun to play but inefficient THICC GASSY BOI or BING BONG I get curb stomped.  
---
I feel like right after rank reset is the most fun because I can play whatever killer I want before I rank up to the sweaty survivors.
---
Omg such a bad parent Ghostface you never drop babies on the floor it will break their fragile bones
---
Orangeinal?
---
???
---
What are you talking about? I didn't call you anything. You just came in and started making fun of me for saying the community is toxic.
---
Then you start making baseless derogatory claims about me being "young" and "inexperienced" even though you don't know the first thing about me. 
---
You are 100% proving my point. You seriously think bullying me is a good way to convince me that this community doesn't have a bullying problem? Read your own comments again, think it over, and go harass someone else. This post was to ask a question for discussion not to give you a target to pick on.
---
Why is the survivor hooking another survivor
---
I'm thinking rather than you gaining an addon that match, you just gain an extra for your inventory.
---
He have two chainsaws what‚Äôs your point. Having pennywise would be massive for dead by daylight as he is one of the most known horror icons to date.
---
It's funny how people take this game so competitively even though there is little incentive to doing so. For what, really? To get to Rank 1? Getting to red ranks is really a matter of time, not so much skill or big brain plays. There is no reward for ranking up. There is no leaderboard. There is no player record. Nothing. 
---
The most valuable thing you get out of your matches is bloodpoints so that you can keep grinding. Think about it. Devotion might be the only thing that can motivate you a tad bit to play competitively. Even then, you're the only one thats gonna see it.
---
This game barely has any milestones or objectives that reward you for playing this way, yet most of the players act like they're competing at Esports. I mean play how you want, but it ain't my cup of tea.
---
I notice this every time like they know it's wrong but they do it and try to hide it terribly lmao
---
I understand this isn't going to work every time. That's not the point of this exercise. I am simply trying to use early game momentum to test the capabilities of the gorgon. You said it yourself, "if it's a good player", however this will let you know this players tendencies are and if they are an experienced gorgon player.
---
Soot and Coxcomb Clapper on Wraith. Ultimate spook!
---
Happens on switch all the time. I have to actively search for teammates not suffering from the bug.
---
Inner strength has been a godsend for preventing this.
---
I had a game as a rank 18 survivor where I got a full team of purple ranks
---
Well i'd rather lose a pallet instead of geeting hooked, i usually test how they play when i'm fully healed
---
The game **shouldn't be designed to be "scary."** It should be designed with solid gameplay as the #1 focus. If this was optional, no one would play this once they figure out how bad it is. 
---
Maybe for like, a first-person story mode or something, but multiplayer it'd be *terrible*.
---
agreed. But what we are trying to do here is feel out where the gorgon is comfortable at shredding and if they are expecting an early pallet drop. Both of these will help you later on in the trial. In this situation I am assuming you are running to an unsafe pallet while still in the uninjured state.
---
did you just censor crap?
---
1. mindgames are possible, the perk doesnt really do anything in a Direct Chase.
---
2. thats just the thing with coordinated swf in general, not the perk.
---
3. I disagree and honestly dont care if you find me rude
---
&gt; masicust 
---
Masochist
---
Clown does not have a mean anti loop at all.  All his power does is force medium vaults through windows and slightly slow down survivors who can just continue to loop and for some reason you slow down a little when you release the bottle and there's a little CD before you can swing.
---
Doctor CAN stop pallet and window vaults but only if you time it right and are within the correct distance.  The downside to doc's power though is you lose your stacks of blood lust when you shock them and you move at huntress speed when you have the shock hand up.
---
Allowing Legion to miss swings and stay feral is a big no no.
---
Thank you man I'll try my best and I hope you get some W's too.
---
All dlc maps are free to everyone
---
Flash light save = bully?
---
I‚Äôve run into some pretty solid Nurses on console but Spirit is definitely more meta
---
This is edited, but I agree with you. He low key ruined the community
---
god pallet is only god pallet vs things that  yknow, don't have instant gap closers. The only way to don't have to throw the pallet is when you go through window to the pallet door and that can only happen a few times in the loop.
---
Run.
---
Break line of sight but zig zagging and run. The closer you are to her the more deadly her blinks are. 
---
As soon as you hear her start blinking, turn 90 degrees and keep running. Never run back to her because she'll start undershooting.
---
Corn is your friend.
---
Try and be stealthy and just avoid her entirely. She sucks at tracking, so use that to your advantage.
---
If she misses a blink, you need to gain as much distance as possible. Just don't run in a straight line.
---
Are you on pc? Not complaining or anything, but my rank 2 killer games last about 15 minutes each. Maybe I suck. :(
---
Oh ok thanks
---
That's fucking dope, son!
---
Spirit is amazing, Plague is not. She'd go in the B tier for me. Don't cleanse, and she still has to M1 you. She has no way to shut down loops without her corrupt purge
---
Ah yes, just like my BackPack Bubba. I usually just don‚Äôt hook and either slug or chase other survivors while holding someone until they wiggle off. It‚Äôs hilarious and everyone has a good time
---
I guess I should have clarified; This should be done at the beginning of the game using early game momentum while in the uninjured state. I to, error on the side of caution when I am injured and in a chase.
---
I made a post about it saying that it was unfair for new players and included a clip of a Ghostface being a dick.
---
I just got downvoted and told it was role play.
---
To be fair my salt levels were pretty high when making it.
---
Sounds fun, doubt I'd get the chance to really use it though.
---
I do it all year!
---
If you have to heal 5+ times in a match, self care is the worst way to do it.
---
It isn't a matter of how many times you can use it, or how "easy" it is to use. It's about efficiency and time management.
---
Lets just use 5 as a reference: self caring 5 times is 160 seconds. Thats 2 whole solo gens, thats 1 person getting facecamped on first hook and dying and then some, thats the equivalent of getting all 5 gens done in an efficient team.
---
Your attitude about it being infinite making it the best healing perk is the exact reason why it's such a bad perk. If your mindset everytime you get injured is to just heal with the slowest heal in the game every single time then you are basically throwing the game for any decent killer.
---
When you have heals that can take anywhere between 16-8 seconds and sometimes even less, and remember that you are still able to play while injured, I have no clue how you think a 32 second heal would be the best.
---
Boob3 is in the right here
---
Yep, I've either won or there's one Gen at that point.
---
Or when you unhook while the killer is there and you got borrowed time, but the person you saved just stands there and gets hooked again.
---
I learn nothing if I go down early because the killer B-lines in my general direction the moment the match starts and always finds their way to me, even if I didn‚Äôt make noise vaulting, messed up gen, threw a pallet, left scratchmarks, hid in locker, etc. they always find me early on and 3 phase me no matter what, it‚Äôs my curse. This only occurs if found early one btw.
---
This would be nice as an extra game mode that's available every weekend.
---
Ya know
---
The only issue with Chainsaw Franklin's is where the line is drawn. 
---
Basically consistency. If it works with chainsaw hits, arguably that means it should work with ability hits. So Huntress Hatchets, Plague's Corrupt Puke, MAYBE trapper traps, etc. I know it actually already works with Legion Frenzy Hits.
---
I don't know if Sloppy Butcher works with huntress hatchets either. Think it used to but maybe not anymore.
---
Oddly enough IIRC speed limiter chainsaw still insta-downs with NOED yet not Huntress hatchets.
---
As I mentioned the big issue is consistency. 
---
One idea I saw I'd be fine with is simply giving Leatherface's Chainsaw built-in Franklin's.
---
i meant prestige
---
wow!! thats crazy!!!!!
---
imagine whining that gens, which already take little time to do, are *slightly* slower 
---
lmfao
---
What about something like this on Spirit? Some sort of fatigue state after leaving haunting and missing your hit.
---
And then wonder why you only play agaist spirirs and nurses, he was nice letting you to get some points and then you respond by using op shit
---
Your mom is awesome.
---
PvZ would like to have a word with you.
---
Pokemon Go would like to have a word with you.
---
Brawl stars would like to have a word with you.
---
Thanks! Salty is annoying, but that shouldn't spoil your game. I get pissed off too lol. But then, later some nice killer comes in, and instead (whether i lose or win) i ask him whether he wants any tips from my POV, where could he improve.  
---
Keep your head up!
---
Not really let‚Äôs say if he misses 3 swings in a row he gets knocked out of it so people don‚Äôt use the exploit t move faster
---
I agree with you on the first part about gens generally taking way too little time to do, but giving a flat progression slow to a single killer is flat out dumb and wrong. They should either rework gens as a whole, or not. We knew BHVR liked tp balance stuff with perks and stuff but this is getting kind of silly.
---
Both of them are better the LF Leather Face has nothing unless they are in the open
---
1: hook and go, never stay in one spot. Always look at the nearest wall when picking up a guy. 
---
2: bbq and chili with party streamers, pudding or hollow shell (if nothing else) as offering. 
---
3: save the best for last, bbq and chili, pop goes the weasel, ruin, noed, blood warden. ( I don‚Äôt have many perks).
---
I ONLY play reaper this way!
---
If they are in the baisment they stay in the baisment!
---
All of my games have been smoother on the servers, but it sounds like that is not the case for most
---
Weird, usually people have the opposite problem with killer being far more stressful.
---
Also, not every survivor is relying on you. You're all relying on each other, but it's really hard to lose the game for your team all by yourself. Do you have any friends to play with who could make you realize losing isn't that big of a deal and you can have fun while doing so?
---
Let the music play
---
Outstanding move!
---
Rip fat clown man
---
this is because survivors will just leave the match. If your up against a nurse main, you are better off taking the depip and moving unto a more fair game. This makes sense BPS wise as well.
---
Just... Move on
---
Okay don't address anything I said in my big post  I just made or anything I said before that and just repeat yourself again.
---
If this was a secondary effect of poised I could see it being okay.
---
Basically have any gen activating cause the scratchmarks effect and have doing the gen yourself cause both effects at once. This allows survivors to quickly escape from high risk gens that the killer is patrolling but also allow the perk to be useful when being chased all game.
---
Judging by flair you‚Äôre the most qualified person to comment on this post.
---
Clown can stop you making it all the way to a loop and force pallet drops 
---
Doctor has detection and again being able to stop actions is stronger then LF
---
I'm just saying that allowing him to have multiple attacks gives survivors no way to punish a legion for being trigger happy.
---
Happy Birthday and please remember to hug and tell your mom daily that she's loved and appreciated. üòÅ Might sound silly, but aim sure it would mean the world to her
---
Ah, nice to see you haven't stopped being a bitch.
---
NGL I thought I had a Meg flair and you were referring to me being dumb. Pleasant surprise \o/
---
Essentially everyone, really. Shred is only good for countering certain windows and the map presence via portals is really weak, as I said already
---
Wraith - free hits, high degree of map pressure that exists more in the hands of the player than what Demo has, ability to body block windows and pallets, can deny Borrowed Time. Better add-ons than Demo as well
---
Pig - Free hits, Ambush can counter some loops better than Shred can because you can control it, hats to slow the game down, hats can cause deaths, if you get hats on when 1 gen is left you apply a lot of end game pressure
---
Myers - free hits, gen grabs, quality instadowns that come with increased lunge range, can slug for a lot of pressure better than any killer save Nurse probably 
---
I could go on, but there's three
---
Not a good argument because Haddonfield is an utterly and completely broken map. It falls so far outside the acceptability of even the more unfair maps for killers like Disturbed Ward that it's just not fair to use it as an argument
---
The bigger problem is if you hit the unhooker, they run away, and now you have one person that only needs to heal once(And can even do it themselves), and the two others can just keep pushing out gens. You're buying yourself time, you're not actually trying to put the unhooked survivor out of the game
---
And if anything, survivors being wounded just makes them more cautious and less willing to run extended loops and instead drop pallets. If you have three survivors up and running, each pallet drop is much more damaging. It's usually a lot easier to get the first hit than the second hit if the survivor intends on staying alive, rather than dragging out loops as much as possible
---
I love that throwback prototype PS3 boomerang controller shape, even if it was most definitely unintentional.
---
That‚Äôs stupid first off Dead Hard and windows and pallets can make him lose it if he goes for a swing which is a stupid weakness especially considering how hard of a punishment you get on a fucking f tier killer
---
Want to know my pain:
---
I almost had 4 mori's with devour hope but the last survivor dc'd one second before the mori animation was over which fucked me over and I didnt get the 4 mori achievement üò≠
---
nea is the survivor you dont want on your team. She is not a CHAD. her abilities lean to player play styles that are cowardly and useless. You are better off with a jane ;).  
---
But in all seriousness , her perks do make survivors play poorly. urban evasion , while a usefull perk is relied upon too heavily and makes some players unable to do objectives and hide a good portion of the game. Because of this, alot of older players will say she is the TRUE killer in a game. Or she is actually the entity. Most of the time they are not wrong.
---
Truth hurts, I know
---
That's the lame thing about Haunted Grounds. When there's no Ruin in the game you literally have no incentive to cleanse and trigger it.
---
Even when the Killer might run Devour Hope, you'll just attempt to memorize the location and cleanse it once DH's been confirmed.
---
And then there are other hex'...Thrill Of The Hunt? Irrelevant as stand-alone, needs to protect another hex. NOED? ...No comment. To be honest I've never ever witnessed a game with NOED and HG being present at the same time lol.
---
Third Seal is powerful but lacks impact if you don't attempt to abuse synergies. If you're not fond of stacking too many hex', you probably won't run 3rd Seal either.
---
The last one being left is Lullaby. And to be honest, Lullaby has too many weaknesses which causes it being not even worth considering. The Perk slot is just too valueable for a impact lacking, late game oriented hex that exposes itself once a gen is touched.
---
Except the part where you focus on one survivor so much that the others get to fix all the gens uncontested in 4 minutes and you wonder how you got "genrushed".
---
I had a Dwight who was rank 20 get off the hook and i just let him get the hatch, i was mad impressed.
---
1. Don't chase a survivor for too long. If you can't catch up to them just break the chase and go apply pressure on the people repairing gens.
---
2. To get BPs fast I recommend playing killers that are capable of earning a high volume of BPs fast such as Doctor, Legion, Spirit, etc.
---
Also, always buy the 100% bonus bloodpoints offerings you may end up getting in your bloodweb. Aditionally, use Leatherface's perk called "BBQ and Chilli" for even more bloodpoints.
---
3. As for perks, I recommend looking up on google good builds suited for the killer you're playing.
---
We need perk for infinite hook sabo now lol
---
And a perk for exhaustion regen while running 
---
And also an Iridescent mori that allows you to kill people on the first down
---
/s obviously
---
Well if certain maps are worse for killers in general, why would it be weird to say that a killer is stronger on certain maps? It doesn't mean he is map dependent, I'm just saying that he will perform better on maps that are more suitable for his abilities.
---
Yeah but look at it from this perspective.  4 perks against 16 perks.  Killer perks have to be inherently more powerful or useful to compete.
---
But he's fast as fuck, booooi
---
Except the part where you sit on gens so much that nobody saves your teammates and they die on first hook or your team wipes and you sit on gens only to be cornered in the EGC
---
Bruh
---
Imagine if Michael had a tier 4 where his lunge made him into a fucking sniper bullet
---
Well I think Frank was the only one who actually wanted to kill a person
---
Enjoy your 1k.
---
I never meant to intend that you can only tap or cleanse but matter of fact is it becomes like pigs traps to where its heavy rng on how many skill checks you get and for some people hitting certain skill checks is rather difficult. I personally struggle hitting ones in the first half of the circle. plus i feel that this whole hitting good and then waiting is just a poor mechanic and kinda dull i would much rather it just take longer to do gens that have to after every missed skill check stop then start.
---
Usually if people havent watched at least 2 of these streamers you obviously havent been playing long- Samination, Truetalent, Ohtofu, Monto, Ohmwrecker(DBD content)
---
The reason i say this is because its a common fact that people will watch youtube videos of the game for experience, tricks, etc.
---
That sucks about as much as being through a vault and off running only to get hit through the window :(
---
My point was noed activating doesn't mean the killer failed. Easily countered and hardly used at high ranks. Ds doesn't always punish tunneling, it can punish normal play aswell. It's design is slightly flawed.
---
Better than the teammate teabagging in front of you.
---
Always run DS in solo or else you are done for.
---
Absolutely, I have run it multiple times myself with a few different builds with friends just to fuck around. But I don't think that should excuse the fact that it is an outright bad perk. I feel there is nothing wrong with giving No Mither an incentive to take the added risk such as 50% bonus BP on an escape since odds are with No Mither you'll die notably more often then you'll escape and overall gain less BP due to the deaths as is.
---
So did you just choose to leave Adrenaline or...
---
I get 3-4k every game with only exception being SWFs that are better than me or playing killers I'm bad at. But this rarely happens, so idk what are you talking about.
---
Imagine if the hillbilly could go through objects.
---
"In a match" 
---
I DON'T THINK HE'S IN ANY MATCH THERE CHIEF!
---
Well we can‚Äôt say they didn‚Äôt deserve it; maybe he looped the killer for a while or made altruistic plays. Either way, just because Freddy already won doesn‚Äôt mean op didn‚Äôt deserve it, since he got cocky and was punished for it. Also a bit off-topic, but survivors sometimes t-bag at the exit gates since they‚Äôve already won and that‚Äôs considered toxic-how is this not?
---
&gt; What strategy do you use for ending games quickly?
---
I don't think this is a good way to play really and it's dependent on the killer.
---
But in general you want to maximize pressure to keep people off gens while also getting kills with as few hooks as possible. 
---
So, hook someone, find a second target, down them, go back and defend the original hook. By having as many survivors as possible needing assistance from other survivors, no one will be doing gens. And by defending the hook they could hit second stage which means they're dead on their next hook.
---
The "hook and go" the other person is talking about is good for games where you want to maximize your Blood Points and double pip which means having a longer game.
---
For what I'm talking about, watch how Umbra plays - it's kind of a soft hook defense method. Not tunneling, not camping, but getting downs while making hook saves difficult.
---
&gt; Best ways to get tons of blood points?
---
Not through quick games. Quick games do not have high Blood Point yields. 
---
Use a killer you're good with and equip BBQ &amp; Chili and use Survivor Puddings and Bloody Party Streamers 
---
&gt; Can you list your favorite or most useful perks in the current patch of the game?
---
I run Save The Best For Last a lot. Haunted Grounds has been fun for me recently. It ranges from useless meme to epic snowball. Blood Warden is a lot of fun and can get you a kill or two more. Discordance is nice. Ruin for certain killers. Pop Goes The Weasel. BBQ and Chili obvs. Bitter Murmur is underrated imo
---
And that is why I tend to try to get the one who unhooked not the one who got unhooked. Though sometimes I miss and hit them, sorry bout that
---
Personally, I find Bubba EXTREMELY hard to land chainsaws with unless they're in the open and I am physically up against them before I start revving. Otherwise I whiff at the very last second. 
---
Compared to Billy, leatherface slows down below survivor speed during revving. (Billy slows to survivor speed) I find this often results in you losing more distance than you gain, even with charge addons. 
---
I also think turning reduces movement speed quite a bit without Chili addons, which explains why I often whiff even if I'm almost up against them and we're in a loop around an object.
---
I think Bubba needs a buff but his addons should be completely replaced with Texas Chainsaw Massacre inspired ones and not just copy-pasted Hillbilly addons.
---
Leatherface and hill billy are decently original characters, im not saying there 100% new ideas, but like... come on a killer clown? thats not even trying.
---
Avoid cleansing portals as much as possible. Demo has a limited number of them and they're super strong if he is able to set up during the final gen or two. A bunch of portals near completed gens or out of the way hooks is great for survivors.
---
Personally, I don‚Äôt view sitting on a gen when there is no pressure as gen rushing.  
---
When survivors sit on a gen right next to the killer or popping a gen in a killers face would fall into that category. 
---
Either way, Play how you want.
---
This is so sad
---
According to the lore he just acted after hearing Julie was in trouble. And the entity may have had a hand in that.
---
Mmm how do you define stuns being more effective? Increasing the stun duration? I think the stun duration is actually pretty well made, as it doesn't cause the Killer to lose the Survivor guaranteed, but also ain't short enough to hinder the Survivor from taking any oppurtunities.
---
Overall, unsafe pallets are just very hard to balance when there ain't any entirely new features that add more potential to them.
---
But I agree, there's nothing more bullshit than dropping the pallet as a Survivor but still get hit and receive a Killer Stun. Like, honestly, one of both, but not both at the same time. I don't give a damn about those 1k bp of pity when I get hooked and killed as a price lol.
---
Okay, whatever. I don't wanna argue about maps. It's just true that his portals fall in the hands of survivors (which is not good) and is not as good at all as any other killer with map pressure like Billy or Freddy
---
:'(
---
That's why you run ruin and HG
---
maybe they thought Dwight's wiggle bar is around 70% so they dropped him thinking he would escape from his grasp, sadly he couldn't
---
Is this a meme?
---
If I pull somebody off the hook with or without borrowed time and you decide to chase him for another minute instead of going after me, it's your problem when we get to end game without ever being hooked.
---
&gt; when I feel much more comfortable playing against her and therefore, see her as a weaker killer.
---
I'm just going to point out that you don't, apparently, have any reason to feel this way and did not attempt to even counter my points.
---
My mom when she saw me playing this one time said ‚Äúfrom an EMT perspective, no one would be able to survive that and just continue running around.‚Äù
---
She‚Äôll bloodlust you eventually
---
Ok im just going to add my 2 cents into this issue. Yes you should balance something towards one side but the thing that makes ruin such a weird situation is that its not used at lower ranks nearly as much. It creates a new mechanic in itself just like the doctor does wit h his insanity skill checks. It changes the game and makes it less fun and interactive in my opinion. Its a perk that changes the way you play instead of making it take longer. I feel most people can agree that its a different game playing with ruin and playing without at this point.
---
No kidding. I do everything I can to stay at purple ranks, because the moment you get to red ranks people start DC'ing at the drop of a hat.
---
Ah, that movie is so good!
---
I think its easy to argue that a stack of coordinated survivors is stronger than the killer. If a killer wants to tunnel a single person then yeah, theyre stronger, but theyll end up losing the match.
---
Not saying im not up for buffing survivor bp gains tho.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat tbf I just play a couple games and then once I have one awful game stop playing for a couple hours to stop getting so tilted. I‚Äôve seen a couple people say it should be based on playtime but that just makes it easier to smurf and to bully people who just bought the game, I think the ranks need to be changed but I think basing it on playtime would just ruin more people‚Äôs experience instead of helping it.
---
Nope
---
Except you can easily see if somebody has a key in lobby? Item holding pose + no obvious item = key.
---
Def dont give exhaustion to survivors who are sick. Its way to easy to get sick and cleansing is a horrible idea in most cases, being injured the entire game forces you to use your exhaustion perks correctly. also people already do super slow gen builds on her, and its really boring.
---
Legion is a big nono, 
---
Pig is RNG based and thats just how it is, i do agree with the set number 2 buff though!
---
How is Wraith the second worst killer?
---
Its a common bug
---
It's not even the equivalent of genrushing, it's like the equivalent of exclusively trying to do the one generator the killer is actively camping while neglecting the six other gens on the map lmao
---
Oh no please don't kill Dweet he doesn't know what he's doing
---
That's not what he meant, look at the picture.
---
Nice, there's nothing better but a perk that only shows value when being used with another perk. /s
---
No but seriouly...Ruin is already enforced enough, having a perk that's also more or less just valueable once you run it with an absolute meta perk...Kinda lame if you ask me.
---
It's not the killer thats at fault, it's the survivors. As a survivor main those DC's make me cringe. Survs cry all the time if they start losing. There is no Reaaaaally OP killer apart maybe from Nurse/Spirit, even then if you're smart enough, they aren't that OP.
---
P.s. I played against Iri huntress w friend. other 2 DC'd as soon as i got down and they noticed iri. Thank god killer was nice and we got some blood points. He let me go even though i pointed to the hook and wanted him to get some points too.  
---
If you cannot take an L as a grown up, might as well uninstall internet.
---
This is the first time it's happened to me since December.
---
Too bad I always do that and I've never suffered the consequences you described
---
He‚Äôs really bad I love him but he just doesn‚Äôt bring much to the table
---
Gen rushing means survivors are doing gens
---
I did actually have a fairly good game. Got two pips from it.
---
Once you know they have DH it becomes much simpler
---
The "I am afraid of people of color" gets me every time.
---
Ahh but I can play more than once as him
---
Depends on how you play him but that's just my opinion
---
but i will say that it is not comparable to the argument you offered
---
billy's saw is strong on all maps save 1 or 2
---
demo's portals are not good on almost any maps save 1 or 2
---
I saw the picture. Assumed you had a mediocre game because you were new, why else would you use the addon
---
Pretty sure it's the slash. In C, the slash goes the other way to indicate escape sequences. Escape sequences are important because they are used to tell the program to do something in a bit of text instead of simply printing it. In this case, it was probably intended to end the printing of bold letters, but was printed instead because of the wrong slash being used. Of course, this engine might not be in C, so I could just be a madman right now, but it might be using escape sequences  in the same way.
---
I literally just told you how to work through it man.  If you can't hit regular skillchecks when they are in the first half of the circle, that's on you for not having enough experience/practice and it's not an issue that needs to be reworked.
---
are you ready for the survivor rees?
---
Ik, that's the bug
---
Pretty smooth for South American servers, the norm for me was yellow/red lobbies every 7/10 matches due to the extremely bad routing we've got here. So yeah, I've been having a blast with green pings every match. Haven't come across any meaningful problems, funnily enough I've been hitting LESS trough pallets and vaults.
---
Unrelenting lmao
---
Why would you purposely cleanse so that the plague can use it on your teammates that are not near a safe place
---
What I mean is that killers being stronger adds to the fear factor,and getting a shit ton of BP when you win would make you feel way more satisfied.And Killers get a good amount for every victory.
---
Also,imagine a perk that makes any survivor teabagging at the gates die instantly.
---
That would be really funny.
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
This is also those survivors who freak out and throw pallets down of they so much as SEE a killer. Some killers, yes you can't pallet stun easily, and yes it's risky as shit, but if they're in right front of the pallet they have to walk around or break it giving you an opportunity to escape. If they're 10 feet away and not looking at you, then don't throw it. I've found so many people because of panic throwing pallets, I'll think I've lost them than hear a pallet go down. Its also why you think you might not "have enough pallets" because you wasted em all
---
TL; DR: A salty rant about dumb pallet usage, from a killer main no less
---
That‚Äôs why I became a killer main! 
---
Maybe if I had friends......üòûüíî
---
It was only rank 1 ruin. What was he expecting?
---
Congratulations on turning eight!
---
This is cute.
---
it is logic. because its betters to not give the plague a power that has a big ass range and a long duration. its easier to loop if you are a 1hit.
---
The only edge (not that it makes him better by any stretch Lololol) that Bubba has over billy is regarding the chainsaw.   Bubba can cancel out of it, either because you know you won't land it or if you want to fake out breaking a pallet.  Billy can't you either have to release the saw or wait for it to rev back down.  
---
Bubba doesn't need to be as good by hill billy, but I really don't think he's the worst killer in the game.  That's be Legion in my book.
---
I finally found some people of culture!
---
Im misunderstanding you then im confused.
---
I agree with both things that you said but I do think D strike has been deeply flawed since it's release but it's in a significantly better place then it used to be.
---
Pig now has 110% movement speed, she can insta kill with her traps so it is balanced ^/s
---
Idk maybe it comes down to what killer you are playing also. I main spirit and freddy, both of which are incredibly effective at ending a chase once the person is injured (spirit can hear you and freddy can trap you bc you will he asleep after 1 hit) so if I can get a free smack on the unhooker I am usually quite confident i will end the chase in less than 15 seconds. The unhooked survivor will still be injured and now I am snowballing pressue.
---
What did he say?
---
I gotta say, its pretty cool to see this. Regardless of how you feel about Keem, he's a big name in the internet community with a lot of influence and following. Him bringing attention to the game could help it grow a pretty decent amount and get a lot more new players in, a nice little bonus to the people who started because of Stranger Things. If he ever organized any tournaments for the game, thay would also be pretty awesome.
---
If you're low rank as a survivor, trust me:  your teammates probably suck too.
---
And if you have some experience with killer, it can give you an advantage.  You probably have a better idea of killers' strengths and weaknesses.   Also, every killer has been looped by an asshole who drops pallets on their heads.  Learn from the abuse they gave you as a killer lol...
---
It all boils down to staying hidden *while completing objectives and saving teammates* for as long as possible.
---
When the killer finds you, you're going to get downed more often than not.  The key is making them waste as much time as possible chasing you.
---
My ass clenched just watching this.
---
It's because the addon didn't actually work. OP is also at least devotion 1 so they're not new, maybe some people just don't own every killer and want to use a splinter to try out killers they don't own? That's their point after all.
---
"Fuck you xbox player bitch" or something like that
---
Oh, good, one of them wasn't enough. Time to get double stalked.
---
I was gonna make fun of the fact you play console dbd, then I looked at the cake and was like nvm.
---
Happy birthday dude and your mom is a real one
---
I've been Nancy maining and I do this. If you have we'll make it, ya it's a little dumb. But if you don't I can heal pretty damn fast in a locker and you can get other productive things done.
---
That's a bad change. You shouldn't have restrictions on friends playing with friends. At least remove that in a 4 man swf
---
I'm still searching how this is relevant.
---
I literally had this happen yesterday with a Nancy. I'm just frantically trying to chase her, and she goes into one of the basements. I think she's gonna work on a gen for adrenaline, but I completely lost her. Hid in a locker as the killer crawled around the house up top. Once the heartbeat left, we both stepped out of a locker. My We'll Make It ran out, and I was just...done. 
---
Still R.I.P and GG to that Nancy, she came back to save my ass and couldn't get out of the door in time- got stuck looping the Demogorgon. (Claudette had a hatch key and led me out like the baby low rank I am). She didn't have to, but she did.
---
But it's twice as risky. And for those other players who aren't that great at looping and juking would be at a serious disadvantage.
---
See? Again, in this reddit all the comments are all 50/50, so I guess they fixed the servers **just a lil bit**?
---
Very nice meme
---
Switch brutal for monstrous shrine then you have a true meme build
---
Agree. If they do that then they need to include a non ranked mode. I play this game a lot. One of my friends only plays when I‚Äôm around. So I‚Äôm always at rank 8-4 and he‚Äôs always 20-18. He‚Äôs not bad at the game he just doesn‚Äôt play very often.
---
Them not being in a safe place is just you being really circumstantial. So I won't get into it with you.
---
yeah but what about your team? that is possibly great at looping and juking? you will fuck them over. stop cleaning and think about your teammates
---
That's so awesome dude
---
Cherish your mom. She sounds amazing!! Happy birthday too!!
---
FYI going by DC sound is borked and has been for a few. I've had friends get dropped/kicked with a DC sound and vice versa even in 3.2.x when we weren't leaving intentionally. Since the dedis testing started we've noticed this being a hell of a lot more prevalent as well along with some frequent lag issues being the potential root.
---
I love how u call it soft hook defence. Umbra is an ultra proximity camper...lmao
---
i agree u should never want the game to finish fast, thats why in the sacrifice category is really hard to get 8k. u need 12 hooks overall and in order to get that is by ‚Äòletting‚Äô survivors to unhook. some survivors r even afraid to go for a rescue when they hear a tiny bit of heartbeat
---
Smallville! I haven‚Äôt watched that in ages.
---
Maybe read the rest of the comments before commenting yourself if you can't resist wild assumptions. He was camping all game and being a dick. He was also very clearly *not* letting him go and just trying to wait until the last second to hit him and give him false hope. You really think he thought, I was going to let you go but you used wasted your insta at the gate so nevermind, now I'm gonna try to kill you? Ridiculous.
---
1. Ending games quickly relies on ending chases quickly. This is why characters like nurse, spirit, hillbilly, Freddy, and huntress are so prevalent; they all possess an effective chase ending or shortening power. Time spent chasing is time survivors can use to accomplish their objective, so most success comes from being able to end a chase quickly.
---
2. BBQ and Chili acts as both a farming and tracking perk, so many killers consider it a must-have. Bloody Party Streamers, survivor puddings, hollow shells, and green wreath offerings also assist in racking up blood points quickly.
---
3. Perks in DBD can be separated into four categories: ‚ÄúChase‚Äù perks, which assist you in completing chases faster, Game slowdown perks to halt the progress of the survivors‚Äô main objective, tracking perks to find survivors, and snowball perks to gain momentum on survivors quickly.
---
Some good perks in each category-
---
-Tracking: BBQ and chili is by far the most popular tracking perk, showing you what distant survivors are up to and where you can intervene. Whispers is often called the most consistent perk in the game, since it will ALWAYS light up when you are within range; even if they‚Äôre in a locker, downed, on the hook, etc., so long as they‚Äôre in the game whispers will work. Nurse‚Äôs calling is quite popular as well; when survivors are within a certain range and healing, you will be able to see their aura clearly. Killers use this to deny healing and get efficient downs.
---
-Chase: Ending chases quickly is often more about the killer‚Äôs power than basic perks, though certain perks can definitely help. Enduring halves the stun you receive from pallet drops, and is often used in tandem with spirit fury (every third pallet that stuns you will break instantly, so long as you‚Äôve already destroyed the last two pallets). You essentially nullify the pallet; be wary though, good players and SWF teams will just drop pallets early to cancel two of your perks. Bamboozle is used to block windows and  it can shut down some of the strongest loops in the game, though many see it as a bit of a boring perk. Save the Best for Last reduces the Cooldown in between successful hits the more you hit survivors that are NOT your obsession, which can be very useful to end chases or spread damage out faster. 
---
-Game slowdown: The king of Game slowdown is commonly agreed to be Ruin, but at higher ranks it will go down relatively quickly. Ruin applies a regression penalty to good generator skill checks and grants no bonus progress to great generator skill checks. The presence of Ruin does have the effect of making survivors want to search for it, and doing totems means they‚Äôre not doing gens. Pop Goes the Weasel allows you to kick a gen for 25% regression after every hook, which can be very useful in delaying almost-completed gens.  Perks like Thanatophobia and Dying Light apply action speed penalties to all survivors; Thanat makes most survivor actions 4% slower for each one injured, while Dying Light applies a 3% action speed penalty for each time you hook a survivor that is not your obsession, and this penalty remains until the obsession is killed. Be wary though, your obsession will be able to heal and unhook others faster with this perk active. 
---
Snowball: While many consider Slowdown perks to be the most vital, Snowball perks tend to be the most fun. Haunted Grounds creates two trapped totems and, when one is cleansed, make it so that all survivors can be one-shot downed for a minute. NOED generates both salt and controversy, though most agree that it will assist in securing kills during late game, when your amount of map pressure can vary heavily. Make Your Choice applies the one-shot down status effect to a survivor when they unhook another survivor, so long as you‚Äôre a decent distance away. Most of these perks are not game-ending, they just help to apply pressure and progress your objective faster.
---
The best perks will widely depend on the killer as well. Stridor is great on spirit and nurse as it counters Iron Will and makes survivors louder, but you don‚Äôt see it that often on a clown. Save the Best for Last goes well on many killers, but it‚Äôs pretty much useless on nurse. 
---
Hope this helps, ask any questions you can think of!
---
Then you're making the assumption that you're making the most out of that fast heal. IMO, self healing is meant to be used when you can't get to a teammate safely. Or the killer has insane pressure at the moment.
---
In my case, it was a legion that wasn't doing too hot and it was the beginning so it was definitely a waste.
---
But of course, use your judgment. Having someone heal you through Sloppy when you can hop in a locker and save time is usually the move. It's just not as simple as time saved = good though.
---
And this wasn't directed towards you btw. Just anyone reading it.
---
??
---
DS are perfect in SA. Always 30ms or less.
---
Thats awesome!
---
Really not that bad
---
It‚Äôs cool, but I would prefer to not have a deafening boom while in chase
---
A mom who secretly plays DBD more than the bday boy
---
Camping is the reason new people wont get into this game.
---
Most killers on ps4 camp and tunnel all day, even when bringing in moris.
---
But it's all good, could still rank up doing 0 gens anyway
---
Well you need Borrowed Time in that setup, otherwise you can't really get your stack with current WGLF. But I shamefully admit I used this strat a lot during double BP when killer queues were extra dead. But I would always try to take the hit first, not just throw my teammate under the bus immediately.
---
Fair points. I'll adjust my play style a bit. Still learning.
---
All three of them, you listed free hits. Ill counter that by saying I have eyes and therefore don't sit on gens while killers approach me.
---
Wraith: All he has is movement speed with no terror radius, speed boost is decent and I guess does get free hits if hes not in a loop. Gets looped like any M1 killer otherwise.
---
Pig: Lunge is pretty bad, has good range but if its obvious shes going for it you can dodge it by leaving loops, since thats the only time theyre viable. Traps are controlled by survivor in the sense that they can take them off, then she doesnt have any left. Also apparently each hat is linked to a jigsaw box so if youre coordinating you can get them off basically first try.
---
Myers: Really weak when not in tier 3, save for add ons and specialized builds that reduce his terror radius as much as possible. I can see him being better than demogorgon though, I agree.
---
Otherwise, I still believe demo is nowhere near bad enough to be deemed trash tier.
---
Whenever I run devour I always make sure I have something to protect it such as thrill or trappers and hags traps or else I never get any use out of it
---
i like that a lot.
---
I love this so much. This has made my day
---
Better yet using no perks and op addons to confuse the survivors whether your tryharding or memeing
---
My only meta perk is BBQ. Other than that I use PWYF, Agitation, and STBFL. Fast as fuck boiiiii
---
yes
---
As a Freddy main, I agree to an extent.
---
Just fyi im not actually saying plague is op but most survivors dont know how to play against her
---
This. Most maps have some kind of big building to go to. Get there asap and don't go normal loop routes. You need to confuse her. I have played games where good nurses give up on me because I'm "looping" them through a virtual maze. A lot of people don't get that though, so be ready for plan b: find the hatch
---
Old Freddy anyways
---
Every time i use streamers i just think to myself, "welp, time to get in my shittiest match of the day."
---
Yeah, like I hit rank 1 a long time ago, now I sit around 15 since I only play occasionally with friends, who are all still red ranks. I may be rusty but I'm not rank 15 rusty. I enjoy playing with my red ranked friends
---
I know it‚Äôs a fucking edit. I‚Äôm saying that he was a toxic asshole one time when he lost in Sea of Thieves. You don‚Äôt think I know an edit when I see one?
---
*runs past two lit totems but the killer doesnt have ruin, thrill of the hunt, or huntress lullaby*
---
Oh hm, this doesnt seem suspicious at all.
---
I had a friend like that. Only played survivor with gimmick builds and would be the first to die every game lol
---
Anyone else misread his name a ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù.
---
I think Leatherface is weaker than pre-rework Freddy. This is coming from someone who semi-mained Old Freddy. OG Freddy had good tracking, (Allowing you to harass survivors and keep everyone occupied) stealth (Invisible, Small TR combined with M&amp;A being very useful on him) and stall. Together you can juggle targets, ambush people in dead zones, and constantly dis-engage and re-engage to cut people off making you very unpredictable.
---
In a straight up chase (Sleep survivor, chase 1 survivor at a time) he was helpless but if you "played dirty" by rapidly switching targets, sleep n' run only to come back, disengaging if you were being looped too long only to catch them once they move away from a loop spot, wasting everyone's time via sleep slow so you can get pallets down and destroyed, etc. Old Freddy could be surprisingly strong.
---
Freddy also had a very easy first hit since you'd often initiate the transition right next to them. Since they only see glimpses of you (or nothing at all with pill bottle) it was like a reverse spirit yet you can still see the survivors allowing for a mindgame or simply no good loop within 7 seconds. (Even as short as 3 seconds with Paint Brush and Z-block)
---
Doctor has good tracking, decent stall, and is very good at 3-genning. His zap can be used in loops to deny pallets or vaults.
---
Leatherface simply has an instadown that is very hard to hit people with unless you are point blank before revving. He's a shitty version of Hillbilly. He has no mobility and map pressure (OG Freddy didn't either but he could still sleep n' run to apply stall. With range addons he could sleep from far away)
---
Situations where Leatherface can hit people with his chainsaw are almost all situations Billy could have also hit them. 
---
However, due to the extreme slow when LF revs, there are MANY, MANY, MANY situations where Billy hits someone with his chainsaw, where Leatherface simply would not have been able to hit them. 
---
IMHO leatherface is worse than Clown (Who's not THAT bad.), DEFINITELY worse than Doctor, and I think he's tied with Legion. 
---
I'd actually put LF below Legion because even though Legion's power isn't exactly amazing, he can still easily get a first hit with Frenzy. LF's chainsaw is so hard to hit people with he might as well M1 only. 
---
The only advantage LF has over Billy is his chainsaw can hit multiple survivors, which only really comes into play if he's camping or the survivors make a major mistake. 
---
Other than that I have had consistently better matches with OG Freddy and Doctor than Leatherface.
---
I refuse to hit red ranks anymore on both killer and survivor. Wait times are rough and the teams are too sweaty.
---
They can still use it without being the obsession tho. How is this a counter?
---
G2A is my go to
---
I only killed one of them, didn‚Äôt even manage to get close to the rest and I was gen rushed, it really was that bad. Or I‚Äôm just a bad killer :)
---
I only get tunneled when i don't bring DS.  Fml
---
Diversion is a must have perk
---
This is terrible!!
---
That looks nothing like a PS4!!
---
Oh. PCs are indeed better, but that doesn't warrant such hate.
---
You made it so much closer by running into the gate after getting hit
---
thats why i dont play dbd when servers r up. i will get frustrated over bullshit hits. I prefer to get a week break and have a peace of mind
---
u havnt seen content cop from idubz then?
---
Just tapped her on the shoulder lol
---
Sweet cheers. Kinda disappointed thought I‚Äôd have a teachable perk to gun for.
---
Very well said
---
Booooo! Killers that quit like that annoy me so much.
---
I‚Äôm running a Trapper like that now and it‚Äôs so goddamn fun.
---
Ahh, I believe they stopped adding them a decent while ago. Can‚Äôt tell you exactly why, though most players weren‚Äôt particularly interested in them.
---
The timer is changed so juggling isn‚Äôt possible anymore
---
The best shit is replying gg to people who start talking trash.  I once told them gg have a great day and it shut them up so fast.
---
That‚Äôs in a perfect world you can do that. It takes one mistake to get downed, and not all of us have the amount of hours that you professional loopers have. It‚Äôs difficult to loop a killer that long, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect most people to be able to do that.
---
That‚Äôs called juggling, they have to keep doing it until either the 1 minute timer runs out or else the skill check keeps coming back. Also every time you drop someone and pick them up again, it adds like 20% to the wiggle bar which by itself would give you a good chance of getting away if the hooks not right beside you.
---
It was a bait m8 i didn't expected so many bites tho :)
---
Yesterday a Ghost Face led me (Nea) to all the Totems and the gens and whatnot and got me 2 achievements. The other two were killed and the 3rd was being scared for no reason. Best thing ever. Then the next game, The Wraith was super chill when I was the last one alive and let me go. First time it had ever happened and I was so happy. 
---
Until I went against The Wraith again. Really hard to see him.
---
wow thank you!
---
We talk english from time to time and we have no problem with it so let me know when you stop by and we'll go on with some english, just for you ;)
---
"That salt in your heart will lead you on the path of darkness my fellow survivor."
---
Well fuck, must be doing something wrong. I've only been playing about 3 weeks but I'm level 11 Survivor and still can't escape a killer for shit.
---
You saw TrU3Ta1ent's vid? Lol
---
I play on PS4 as well, you should get in the habit of cleansing totems before endgame begins to negate NOED altogether, and if you need more incentive to do bones, Inner Strength is a pretty good totem based perk. A good rule to live by is to just assume every killer is running NOED until you can prove otherwise
---
Well then,  gr8 b8, I give it 7/8
---
If it didn‚Äôt put you against them who are you going to play with? The game has too low of a player count for matchmaking to only put you with your rank. Purple and green ranks are basically the same anyway.
---
Fuck, I've been exposed
---
*Equips Mori*
---
I do love my spies from the Shadows.
---
That‚Äôs a fine image of otzdarva there sir.
---
I've had a streak of Michaels all last month but haven't seen a single Michael this month.....what the hellüòë
---
wait wait mate if u have the game on your account digigtaly u can share it with her and you two would be able to play together u probaly got the the digigtal verison in the free ps plus month right?
---
You can just get gud
---
Self-Care is good to run with Resilience and Spine Chill. Not meta but it helps you 99% your heals in case the killer is coming to you near a bad generator location. 15% increase to repair speed when injured + a toolbox to do gens super quick solo which is why you should use Self-Care over running a Medkit to 99% and you don‚Äôt risk using no mither and getting targeted as you can heal.
---
Omg I love when people think I'm going to tunnel as spirit so they body block me. i just instantly smack them, go into my power and 9/10 times down them, and now we are just trading hooks and snowballing pressure
---
Most survivors I have dead hard for distance. It fucking sucks when I mind game a survivor at a loop but then they get to extend the chase a lot longer with a simple press of a button. Dead hard is especially bullshit when playing Huntress.
---
Impossible! Each game has 4 survivors, assuming each survivor leaves one -rep (as they usually do), and dividing 48 by 4, that would mean you would have to get into, and finish a game every ten minutes. Everyone knows that queue times are at least twice as long! XD
---
Emblem system? What's that?

---
I would if I got more scratched mirrors and lerys map offerings. :(
---
Yes? Of course I have. I never said he wasn't an idiot.
---
Nothing to worry about. 
---
Not much you have to do to be a good survivor. 
---
Go for it!
---
Nothing wrong with using off meta perks but don‚Äôt knock people for using meta shit. Not everyone wants to have the sweatiest game of their life playing killer lol and some people just like meta perks nothing wrong with it
---
Keep in mind it takes her ages to get everyone purged, she also doesn't have the lunge that Myers does
---
What killer/killers do you use, and what methods are best for ‚Äúkeeping the pressure‚Äù i usually go 30 meters away let someone rescue the survivor then go back and beat the living shit out of both if not ive secured another hook easily and I usually go for the same person I originally hooked so its like a big fuck you to the survivors lol
---
By Ysmir he's right!
---
Could the legends be true?
---
sure i am, otherwise i wouldn`t have posted this.
---
hypocrisy is so hilarious, lmao
---
Not if they use it correctly

Then I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.

Then you don‚Äôt know how to use it.

Thank you!!!

Survivors have Adrenaline killers have NOED its simple really. Survivors get a second chance with hatch so killers get a second chance too.

Welcome to reddit :)

Watch me come in with brutal strength 3 and destroy this place
---
Thats the old DS though, the new ds doesnt let you juggle since the skillcheck pops up while he's picking you up
---
I mean... unless your playstyle is facecamp only then their playstyle is THE playstyle... they do everything then they need to do it.... they apply and maintain pressure... they do everything they need to when it needs to be done.
---
What an interesting idea. It must be tried!
---
I do that the whole game lmao I constantly do that i dont give people a remote chance idc if its swf or noobies
---
If theyre competent and injured, thats better than competent and healthy. The chases would take double as long and their teammates would have even more time.
---
Remember, if you self-care for 36 seconds and get chased after getting hit for just 12 seconds you already broke even. If you get chased any longer than that, thats great value.
---
If theyre injured theyll also have way less chances to help eachother. Playing it risky is when youre doing a gen, you hear the TR and you keep doing it. You would have to leave it to make sure you dont get hit right away (or waste a good pallet). If youre injured, theres no such gamble.

What I hate is that every time I bring haunted grounds the don‚Äôt cleanse a single thing
---
Survivors with bright clothing upset by tunneling: Yeah, this is smol brain time.
---
&gt; and the survivors are crying.
---
I'm just going to say that this is rather immature of you
---
&gt; A win to me is when i kill the whole team get 30k blood points
---
You don't want quick games then. Quick games will not yield that many Blood Points
---
I feel like you are just bad at killer...harsh, but it seems like it. Plague is strong as hell and leather is solid if you know how to use him and dont get chainsaw happy.
---
I dont face camp i camp when its 2 people dead 1 on a hook and 1 survivor trying to save the hook by playing peek a boo
---
Really? I've seen a lot of killers juggling recently downed players they've hooked recently. I usually play rank ~8 or so, so maybe they just don't know that.
---
Solo q is a worst experience than killer and that‚Äôs a fact
---
Play at rank 1, where there are far less killers due to how difficult the games are and you will be getting matches almost instantly
---
This also brings up another subject like "Rebuilding" of hex totems. 
---
I.E. if your Devour Hope is cleansed, should it just light another dull totem and have it's stacks reset? It'd still mean survivors have counterplay, but having a hex cleansed at match start would only mean survivors know you're running a hex of some sort and not you're playing with 3 perks out the gate.
---
This would only affect certain hexes IMHO. Ruin shouldn't require survivors to have to destroy all 5 totems on the map. Only if there was a delay like breaking Ruin gives a minute or two of relief before it comes back as another dull totem. Or the killer has to physically go over to a dull totem and do a longish interaction to light it.
---
I am having a lot of trouble chasing down high end survivors who just do basic loops with windows and such, if anyone wants to help a mid-tier killer in a custom game. I'm actually very good at hunting down people doing mind games, it's only the people who efficiently run away in plain sight I struggle with. I'm trying to avoid hopping on the Nurse bandwagon to artificially skip this hurdle.
---
Zauren on PC with the weird puppet face.
---
Just go with it and have no regerts that happens to me a lot
---
Happens to me literally every time I play with friends.
---
yea but it only lasts a minute, and if he uses the permanent add-on he still needs to feed on I believe it was 3 survivors at least to get it? also dont forget how easier it is to find survivors when they're injured and coughing, myers can make everyone exposed but if they're healthy they won't make injured sounds so it's harder to find them. and again plague not only makes them injured the whole match but also vomit, making them easier to find than a normal injured survivor. also if myers need to feed on that one dumb survivor, what about that one dumb survivor who cleanse themselves on the fountains too? cant the same be said for them? one survivors fucks everyone up cause they cleansed or feed myers.
---
Mine said I was sick for not only playing video games but watching them on Twitch as well.

And honestly I‚Äôve played for 3 years now and have never heard of any of the others besides Monto so your statement isn‚Äôt very applicable.

I prefer Puppers and Otzdarva(and sometimes Noob3) but point is, not everyone watches YT videos to get better.
---
After the face rework Steve is going to be jealous
---
To be honest I barely know any of the specifics of each level and I'm already a rank 9. Not saying this is good, but it is not hard to become a decent player.
---
Just accept that most killers will tunnel pe camp and plan accordingly ;)
---
It's a bubba so I wouldn't be surprised if the servers "Stopped working" miraculously.
---
I don't pay attention to that very often. I just play to shit my pants.
---
???? Have you seen a single tier list these two are almost aways at the bottom also  I play them and enjoy them but they do need some love but yeah fuck me right how dare I fucking suggest a buff to a killer that you think are okay I might as well quite the game I‚Äôm so bad

My most feared thing as a redditor... E M O J I S. :O
---
must downvote until fixed
---
Even in the low ranks people DC when the killer is Spirit, it's frustrating because it lowers every chance we had at surviving lol
---
I stand corrected- must've been a single pip. My bad, thought I needed two for the rankup. Still tho, that was my game to rankup to 4
---
Lullaby would be very high tier at that point.
---
Me after seeing bright clothing in the distance but nothing anywhere else: I‚Äôm gonna do what‚Äôs called a pro gamer move.
---
Me when I just hooked someone and I already hear footsteps all around me: *laughs in having zero reason to leave the hook because no one doin gens or totems or sabotaging*
---
I said old Freddy I dont try to tunnel with the updated version. I go for the weaker target. Plus, I said to an extent not full on.
---
I dont get why people hate slugging so much. It like like hating a casino player for raising in blackjack.
---
I just think the survivor should be able to knock me out of my lunge without getting smacked if they correctly predict which side of the pallet I‚Äôm going to.
---
Like if I‚Äôm waiting near a rock, and the survivor is at an unsafe pallet, and I lunge around it to the left, I think they should be able to run to my right and drop it on me and make it to another loop. That way they have a chance to get out of the death trap, but I can still punish them for running to an unsafe loop.
---
I‚Äôd probably have to draw it out to make it make sense, but basically the survivor should have a chance to force a stun so they can escape, and if they miss the stun then I get my hit.
---
Some pallets should also just be removed, like the one in Lery‚Äôs that has two open doors on one side. Those are bullshit, I can get stunned without enduring and still be on the survivor‚Äôs ass
---
Ok you've gotta be really low rank if you tunnel and never run into borrowed time lol. Or do you just get rid of your terror radius and camp?
---
That's a horrible strat.... your basically allowing the other survivor 2 minutes to find the hatch.
---
And your also losing alot of bloodpoints by camping a hook.... but eh you are only at rank 16 so survivors there arent exactly destroyers of souls yet, but you'll figure out what does and doesnt work with time.
---
I value your life than that of any perk.
---
Life is more important than getting a perk into a game.
---
Reading comprehension is at all times low here
---
I don‚Äôt have it unlocked yet :(
---
Thank you all guys! Forgot to mention that I of course am already subscribed to Otzdarva, it's impossible not to love him. I just meant a killer main :P
---
&gt;  Ill counter that by saying I have eyes and therefore don't sit on gens while killers approach me.
---
You can see killers with no stain or terror radius through walls? Rad!
---
&gt; Wraith: All he has is movement speed with no terror radius, speed boost is decent and I guess does get free hits if hes not in a loop. Gets looped like any M1 killer otherwise.
---
How is this any worse than Demo? Especially since Demo gets looped to hell
---
Okay, I just read through your Pig section and it's clear you're a newer player who has no clue what they're talking about because this:
---
&gt; Also apparently each hat is linked to a jigsaw box so if youre coordinating you can get them off basically first try.
---
is fucking lol worthy
---
I'm not going to bother with you
---
lmfao red rank, hilarious, you are boosted to hell and back
---
I had an injured Claudette teabag in front of my totem before attempting to cleanse it. ~15 feet from a hook. I was already up her ass, so she goes down, and after BBQ showed all 3 others making a beeline for the hook together, they were shocked, SHOCKED when I didn't fuck of and go on vacation across the sea. 
---
I down the hook swarmers one by one, and the rage from their multiple friend request messages was beautiful. they outright used the word "cheat" multiple times. I suspect they boosted their way to rank ~9. not a single one had Borrowed Time or Decisive.

Plot Twist:  Killer shakes head and goes after the hook farmer, tubneling and camping them and then resuming the game as usual.

Exactly! That‚Äôs a perfect example why you don‚Äôt hardcore tunnel!
---
&gt; Oh yes. The "freddy is bad" mentality that has plagued the community since his release until he was changed.
---
Anyone who says that they prefer the old Freddy over the new one has to either be paid to say such things or is trolling. The new Freddy is a top tier killer, only behind The Nurse, Spirit. Tied with Billy. It's not a matter of people not knowing how to play the older one, it's the fact that he couldn't do shit for 5-7 seconds at base and survivors could unhook right in front of him. That's pathetically  weak. He was a joke, a meme.
---
The new Freddy is a beast, his base is great and he has some good addons, map and gen pressure. You got a Rose Royce and are lamenting that a Pinto got taken to the junk yard? Trapper, Doctor, Pig, Legion, Plague, and Wraith mains would kill for such a buff. The Freddy rework is the best damn thing the devs have done in this game since the buffing of the Spirit.
---
Anddddd they can go right back to doing stupid shit if they fuck with the base of the Nurse. The Nurse's base does NOT need any touching what so fucking ever. Not one hair on her head. Low skilled survivor mains mainly complained about her range addons and extra blink addons. Not the fucking base. Only the worse of the worse survivors act like the Nurse's base can't be overcome. 
---
BHVR, don't touch the fucking base. The Nurse does not need to become an addon-dependant killer like your "new and improved" Wraith who is just as shit as he was before his so-called "rework". And do you know why he is still just as shit as he was before his so called rework? BECAUSE HIS BASE IS STILL SHIT. Do you know why Freddy is a great killer now? BECAUSE HIS BASE IS GREAT. It's not rocket science. The base of a killer is the most important aspect of the killer bar none. "Tweaking" it in any little way can fuck the killer over massively.
---
I mean clearly everything is a learning experience 
---
‚ÄúDestroyer of souls‚Äù ive played against way higher ranks because they all derank to play against ‚Äúnoob‚Äù killers then they end up in my game then i take a big greasy shit on them because they aren‚Äôt expecting to play against someone who actually tries.
---
That‚Äôs the secret, OP. Everyone is bad at this game and unless you‚Äôre in some super meta restrictive SWF it‚Äôs a game that has no stakes and no need for competitive meta play. Do whatever you want and just have fun. Even if it means running Slippery Meat and Up The Ante and trying to yeet off the hook.
---
Lol, yea, I took this game seriously at one time. Getting a 4K with all Iridescent emblems is exciting still, but now it's more just about pissing myself in fear when solo surviving or just trying to be entertaining as killer.
---
Honestly I'm a nice killer, as long as the survivors have given me all 4 of my bbq stacks I consider it a job well done. I'd let people escape more often if I knew a better way to communicate that I'm good after my stacks happen.

I actually thought that this was a screenshot from DBD for a sec nice job mate

Did you try to leave the exit gate while trap was active?

People complaining about them in the blood web because they have the same chance of appearing as other iridescent offerings, probably stopped adding them so that they weren‚Äôt the only iri quality items you got

Whats the problem with the colapse?
---
8 years old
---
Too bad you‚Äôve never left yellow ranks, then. Because focusing on one survivor like that only leaves the other 2, maybe 3 when there isn‚Äôt 1 saving the targeted survivor, working on gens
---
I did this and got tunneled by the same guy I killed a couple weeks ago -_- lol
---
Lol does that happen? You can literally look at the aura and witness them getting yoinked
---
Yeah, that was it then. Don't even get close to the exit gate
---
I dont think anyone likes insta down huntress man, i understand people want you to keep playing the game. but in all honesty i play enough OP addon killers at high ranks so i just dont even want to deal with it. If i knew they had no perks then sure but there is no way to tell
---
He's basically the only killer I play since my roommate bought me the Halloween DLC üòÅ

Haha I love how you're now descending into Internet Tough Guy Mode because someone said you should grow up after you acted like a petulant child

Why though when you can get into another game, pointless to play against such addons
---
He's called "The Doctor" and I HATE THE SCARY SHOCKY JUMPSCARES! ;^;
---
Legion's power makes it so you can vault pallets. If you stab a survivor while using it, and the others are close enough their position will be revealed to you. But Legions power was nerfed a while ago, so that you essentially get 1 stab per survivor and if you miss it instantly ends your power.
---
Is it with ‚ÄúL‚Äù? MortaLjL? I sent a request if so
---
They were taking the place of other ultra rare items, people were getting sick of getting offerings for killers they already own instead of decent add-ons
---
Why doe? Aren‚Äôt you kind of shooting yourself in the leg by doing that?
---
Yikes.
---
I hope you don't act like this in real life. It will haunt you later on
---
You're definitely not good if you can only tunnel to do it, let's see some of your gameplay if you think you're so good lmao. Also the fact you claim rank 1 tells me you either hide your terror radius cause you're not good enough to catch anyone again, or you're lying since you claim you dont run into borrowed time. Either way if you think you're so good I'd love to see some gameplay from a fellow red rank ;)
---
Wouldn't suspect people to get angry over a question.
---
Well there are a lot of things in this game that are unfun honestly: Instaheals, Toolboxes, Totem Spawns, DC's, Hook Farmers, Matchmaking, Instasaw Billy, Gen-grabber Spirit, etc. etc. etc.
---
If you DC from any of these things you might as well DC from 60% of all games!
---
But I also don't want to delete and repost and get pooped on lmao
---
Poised is crazy good on rotten fields. if you are getting chased and poised and adren pop you legit cant track that.
---
The only thing I can think of is being a dick with a locker? Like combining with head on and jumping in trying to troll him or something
---
not sure about the dlcs can you tell if she was able to get them ? because my friend didnt get them
---
I don't get players who purposefully act like dicks. If you ever see me standing around at a gate it's because I'm going to let the survivor go. I might down them to scare them a bit but I'll just let them crawl out. What's the point of doing shit like this if you're just going to be an asshole
---
Oh joy. He's been white and he has even became a female. Now he's everyone's worst nightmare! 
---
The Doctor is super annoying if he gets you. Not to mention the Skill Check pop-up be popping up in random spots.
---
i could hear the "wait, what?!"
---
That's a gamer word we don't like to see
---
We aint playin ice climbers boy
---
Ahhh. Ok. Good to know.
---
Plague just needs a mild rework. Cleansing should be an actual objective and not just an obscure way to grief your teammates and noob trap new players.
---
Noted. Just wanted to get some clarification.
---
You can't leave with the trap on, which is what it sounds like you did. If your trap is active you're only able to leave through the hatch. If it's not active then you can leave through the door.
---
Very true, you basically just have to hope you get fun games with none of this
---
Yep that's it, I'll accept it when i get home
---
You wanna act mature and shit then you act toxic yet you wanna call me out saying im acting toxic and im being an ‚Äúinternet tough guy‚Äù i hope you dont act like this shit in real life your the type of guy to mentally abuse your gf or wife because you got problems and cant handle your shit like a man so you keep running your mouth on the internet. Dying for attention typical fucking millennial.
---
Never eat thatüë∫
---
**You can see killers with no stain or terror radius through walls? Rad!**
---
If they get seen by anyone, free hits are gone. If they catch someone by suprise, now the killer is apparent and everyones looking out.
---
**How is this any worse than Demo? Especially since Demo gets looped to hell**
---
How is a conditional "surprise hit" better than actually having an ability that helps you out during chases. Demo isnt trash I already told you I don't agree on that, I dont know why that is your counter arguement.
---
**clear you're a newer player who has no clue what they're talking about because this is fucking lol worthy**
---
It hasn't failed me so far, so I guess im just extremely lucky huh. Ive got 1500 collective hours and reach rank 1 every reset, so I have some degree of game knowledge :).
---
**I'm not going to bother with you**
---
Was fun talking to someone open to new ideas and discussion ecks dee
---
I never really see DC‚Äôs against doc. he‚Äôs a lot more fun to play against than triple instahatchets, and really not hard to counter at higher levels. Lots of respect since Doctor is one of the most complex killers and still struggles on larger maps.
---
New addon: hearing doc‚Äôs laugh results in an automatic down and madness T3. In fact, this should just come with the power automatically. Give him a chainsaw too, now that I think about it. He earned it.
---
I had this the other day. Levelled a bunch of people up to 10 to do adept achievements, logged on the next day and they're all level 1 again. BP were refunded though.

Wow that's awesome. Such attention to detail it even looks like console graphics!

Jk I'm sorry pls don't yell at me, it's great, also save me a piece

Go put on your makeup and make your shitty youtube videos you clown. üòÇ

Probably Eat 4 Decisive‚Äôs per game as well
---
Can only leave through hatch
---
&gt; better than actually having an ability that helps you out during chases.
---
Because it doesn't. You're just boosted to hell and back.
---
like, people have stopped playing him for a reason. every streamer acknowledges that he's weak
---
*it's just you*
---
What honestly tilts me is its not even like theres a Ruin totem...
---
I did not expect you to enter into nuclear meltdown mode over the most mild criticism and advice possible, wow
---
I like when they say "GG EZ"
---
And I just reply "thanks! GG!" lol especially when the person who said that was the only survivor who escaped
---
Yeah... this happened to me too and the server had 70ms. It seems like there is a mild desync and you get hit wherever the killer sees you but the funny part is, he can only pick you up in the place where you went down and see in your screen.  
---
10 / 10.
---
Troll = playing how I see fit? Lmao, survivor players like you and guy above are jokes
---
Bait
---
Myers has some crazy fun add ons like tombstone/scratched mirror/jumpscare. But Ghostface is really fun too you just have to do more scheming. IMO I would go for Myers since he has the better perks.
---
Myers is better just in general.
---
Yikes, you need to chill
---
Myers has better perks. Ghostface and Myers are both easy to counter play. GF can get the jump on people naturally while Myers needs add ons. Myers is fucking terrifying while Ghostface is just startling. Both can insta down with their abilities. Ghostface has more cosmetics. Myers is more versatile with his playstyle. Take your pick
---
Aww oh no did I make you delete your post? Poor baby
---
Awesome looks like I'll get Myers first to play as
---
&gt;Anyone who says that they prefer the old Freddy over the new one has to either be paid to say such things or is trolling. 
---
I know it's hard comprehending the fact that people prefer different play styles, but it's a thing. If I wanted to play a trapping killer, I wouldn't have chose freddy as my main, it's as simple as that. Freddy is now a trapping killer. 
---
&gt;The new Freddy is a top tier killer, only behind The Nurse, Spirit. Tied with Billy.
---
Below Billy. He's not bad by any means, but he isn't on par with Billy. I think hag is above him for sure, and hag is more on par with billy. 
---
&gt;It's not a matter of people not knowing how to play the older one
---
I actually believe it is. If he was as bad as people said he was, people wouldn't have been able to play him at red ranks and consistently 2-3k, people wouldn't have been able to climb with him, etc. He just wasn't like the other killers, he required quite a bit of planning, and I think the main reason people didn't like him was because they couldn't adjust to his play style. 
---
&gt;it's the fact that he couldn't do shit for 5-7 seconds at base and survivors could unhook right in front of him.
---
Did you just ignore what I already typed? I don't have to go over it again, just reread what I already stated. You needed to change your mentality and prepare for each scenario, it's as simple as that. 
---
&gt;That's pathetically weak. He was a joke, a meme.
---
This is just typical. I already said how his kit made the trade off of waiting 7 seconds worth it, but you just ignored it completely. 
---
&gt;The new Freddy is a beast, his base is great and he has some good addons
---
He's good for sure, not really the point of what I was discussing. Freddy was changed, and freddy mains who liked him for his ability and not because he's freddy krueger lost their main. But he feels pretty "meh" to me. Every ability aside from teleporting to gens is something we have in other killers in some way (fake pallets, ability to slow survivors down by placing something on the ground). He just does it in slightly different way. I'm not saying he isn't good, but in my opinion, he lost what made him unique. 
---
&gt;You got a Rose Royce and are lamenting that a Pinto got taken to the junk yard? Trapper, Doctor, Pig, Legion, Plague, and Wraith mains would kill for such a buff.
---
It wasn't a buff. He was changed entirely, it was a rework. If trapper, doctor, pig, legion, plague, and wraith got the same treatment, they wouldn't feel like trapper, doctor, pig, legion, plague, and wraith anymore. The people who played them would either have to main them despite the possibility of not liking the "new and improved version" or switch mains, like freddy mains had to do. I think whether he is better or worse lies in who was playing him honestly, for me, I'm just not that good at him anymore. As old freddy I would dominate most of my matches.
---
&gt;The Freddy rework is the best damn thing the devs have done in this game since the buffing of the Spirit.
---
You consider the buffing of spirit to be "one of the best things they've done"? You must have a low bar. A lot of people hate spirit, while I don't mind her, if this was one of their best moves, she wouldn't be such a disliked killer.
---
&gt; Only the worse of the worse survivors act like the Nurse's base can't be overcome. 
---
This really isnt the biggest issue. It's just fundamentally broken, a killer who doesn't need to conform to map design nor survivor defenses is just bad for the game imo, feels like the chase isn't the chase. Though if you are a good nurse, you really don't need addons to crush survivors, even a good swf, and there is something to be said about that. Her addons just make it to where a god nurse can dominate a swf without any perks. 
---
&gt;BHVR, don't touch the fucking base. The Nurse does not need to become an addon-dependant killer like your "new and improved" Wraith who is just as shit as he was before
---
Bhvr please touch up on the base a bit. The nurse wouldn't be addon dependant, and I wouldn't say wraith is addon dependant either. His addons are great, but you really don't need them if you can get the jump on survivors well. In b4 you say "experienced survivors see you approaching" which I will respond by saying "approach from places where they would have a hard time seeing you like around walls"
---
Hmm, that's fair. Unique Terror Radiuses could be made a "once you see them" kind of thing where until you encounter them (whether that's measured by proximity or by having them on your screen ala Ghostface) they have basic TR, but gain their unique one once you already know its them.
---
Clearly you've never encountered a good one then
---
Yeah! If you don't wanna be tunneled, only play Claudette!
---
too bad I chase people with ds
---
Yup. Me personally its about immersion. I cant get into the game if the sun is shining through my windows and the birds are still chirping =/
---
Yeah legit lmao, this dude is crying for nothing
---
Could just be poor usage on your part? Idk, what rank are you? At one point  Killers will start to check if you're running dead hard by baiting you into using it.
---
Clown‚Äôs description: ‚ÄúYou will die seeing a hideous, sadistic serial killer enjoy the final moments of your life, his toxic gas destroying your psyche and lungs simultaneously as you writhe in agony.‚Äù
---
Clown in the game: ‚Äúhaha large man throw smelly stink gas‚Äù
---
Turn on public comments on your Steam profile
---
No one wanted to be the killer then, there was some serious issues going on, like teams running 4 BNP, no bloodlust so the bigger loops where fucking nightmares to deal with and insta-blind flashlights, DS, generators being done faster ... not to mention he-who-shall-not-be-named-but-was-banned and his cult of cunts.
---
I salute all of you that mained killers during those times, it was fucking bullshit.
---
I am so glad I am not the only experiencing this. I will time Dead Hard perfectly and still get knocked down. The exhaustion timer shows up too.
---
Been a major problem as killer lately that it DC‚Äôs as soon as you get a 4K
---
Bit of a necro but Father's Glasses gives you a built in bloodhound (Blood is bright) when phasing currently. 
---
I don't know if it's a bug or intended. Either way you can run Father's Glasses without needing bloodhound.
---
Dedicated servers probably.
---
RFYL could be reasonably nerfed with a longer cooldown, Game Over is an intentionally strong endgame survivor perk to counter the 3 gen strat, which renders certain maps all but unbeatable for non-SWF survivors. I think of it like unbreakable: in most games it does nothing but in some games it will be a lifesaver.
---
No, it also happens to me. There is something weird about the last patch
---
Keemstar playing DBD now?
---
You‚Äôre probably right
---
Just looked at the picture again. (I'm busy working) and I'm pretty disappointed with the glare and reflection of my dashboard. :/ 
---
If I'm in the area again later tonight I'll retake the picture.
---
I kinda wish there was a killer that could hide in lockers. For when there are survivors that REALLY want to finish a gen.
---
Our hatred of dedicated servers will be the thing that unifies the survivor and killer main community lol
---
 you use d/s but the killers would chase you anyway 89% of the time
---
I agree my username will be non offensive username I'm more annoyed at Sony for a week ban over a username
---
Hm, I don‚Äôt think I ever saw highlighted blood while using this Add-on without the aid of Bloodhound. It might be a bug for you but idk.
---
Also, how‚Äôd you find this post? It‚Äôs so old.
---
There's a reason you're getting downvoted. Rape jokes aren't funny.
---
It was a question, how am I complaining? Baby killers get so defensive whenever you say something about their precious NOED.
---
Anyone got the original image of the bottom part? xD I love how sad the clown looks!
---
'Pay to winner'
---
When I was wearing a much more visible than standard Doctor outfit
---
It is pronounced baby dweet
---
No no no this is all wrong. Biff would be a killer.
---
Remember when a 4K always double pipped you?
---
You're a godsend to this community
---
I love how his bio says he‚Äôs good at literally nothing, and yet in the realm of the entity, he‚Äôs a leader
---
the perk will rise from f tier to s tier
---
Ikr
---
Honestly KBM is ridiculously over-glorified in Dead by Daylight
---
Oh my god dude you are delusional. You ruin the game for everyone else because you're a sad little person who gets off on making other players suffer, you're the worst. Deal with how much of a piece of shit you are however you want kid. Punching morons shouldnt be illegal either. Knock some fuckin sense into ya.
---
This a bug.
---
They can't copyright strike him, this was an original track made by him.
---
Pretty sure he‚Äôs talking about bringing franklin‚Äôs with the sole intention of ruining the survivor‚Äôs lunch, not to counter strong items.
---
Elaborate? I personally find it MUCH easier tbh.
---
It would be optional so why would it matter
---
I'm here from r/all. This makes no sense whatsoever.
---
I find the best 3-gen from the start. I otherwise play as normal but pay extra attention to my desired 3-gen. As gens pop I get more and more defensive until I'm hard 3-genning. 
---
I try not to 3-gen from the start (I.E. I don't just sit there waiting as soon as I spawn in for survivors to finish all the other gens) but I do plan to 3-gen if I have to in order to win.
---
Holy shit, ranks aside those items/perks.
---
If you brought a mori just because you knew they were swf you made a good choice this time lol
---
Lol your idea is to hook camp and hide your terror radius? Clearly I know how to just takes 0 skill
---
Here's a question for you, since you think you're so amazing at this game why do you need to camp?
---
Look up game sharing, it is a feature on the PS4.
---
Thanks!
---
Alright killer... I shall go elsewhere for my pallets and never come back
---
It wouldn‚Äôt much because you don‚Äôt have to use it. But it‚Äôs just a very useless feature that‚Äôs not worth the time to implement and balance. 
---
The only mode it‚Äôd work in would be KYF for fun modes or a single player mode. Those 2 would be fine if it was ever going to be implemented.
---
Mirror Myers is pretty good on ALL maps I think
---
When I said I was camping? Lmao, you are funny, don't talk to me please or I'm afraid I will puke
---
You're right we need more Blendettes. Everyone loves those.
---
Moried 1 guy and all of them but one DCed. Lmao

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dddtel/nintendo_switch_party_system_is_not_working/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
My poor boy
---
I get this message after almost every game recently
---
Actually dude I'm gonna puke dealing with an idiot, why dont you cut to the point pro gamer and show us your amazing gameplay?
---
It's not all too bad IMO. Once they fix the unblinkable tiles and actually allow us to teleport to the upper floor it'll be a good map for Nurse since it's so small.
---
What's a spooky lunchbox I've never played at Halloween
---
Yeah but personal preference aside there really aren't mant advantages KBM has over controller, at least, not in Dead by Daylight. The only one I can think of is increased sensitivity and as someone who rarely plays Billy this sole advantage is pretty much useless
---
I was NOT expecting Clara's bully song to play lol  
---
As someone who recently went from playing Legion to Spirit, I feel this
---
I mainly play killer, its the vast majority of survivors who use it in the open rather than to a window or pallet that dont
---
You are complaining about players when you're a noob yourself. You can't make this shit up, folks.
---
Survivors are pretty much just skins, you‚Äôll be hard pressed to find that many stealth Bills though. Being the dedicated unhook with BT+We‚Äôll Make It+Babysitter is always fun, iron will is a strong addition to most builds as well.
---
Ok I guess.
---
The last perk is AWESOME. Would love using it to fuck over SWfs with keys
---
Does the item have to be on a ground for a certain time at one time or it can be picked up and timer goes on?
---
where  can i get a mom like that
---
It really is. Or when people DC before they get put on the hook for the first time.
---
Lmao and you're easily triggered and also most likely full of it =) and you do use ghostface so I know exactly how you play if you dont run into borrowed ;)
---
Very true
---
Maybe on yours, I've played for hours on end on PS4 and never had this happen or game get glitchy.
---
Thanks! That one was probably my favorite one to create so I‚Äôm glad you like it! I was thinking that the ‚Äútimer‚Äù would be constant so if it‚Äôs on the ground for a little here, a little there all the time adds up. I‚Äôm not sure if I made it clear but this perk also applies to items left in chests
---
The sound worked perfectly fine until halfway through the match when it suddenly cut out. The switch menu was perfectly capable of making sound throughout the game when I tested it. The glitch ended when I escaped and got the message "player disconnected from host."
---
Hopefully this glitch was either a one time thing or is very rare as it makes the game borderline unplayable.
---
I am new to the game I've had it for 2 weeks I am unaware of the meta and am still learning how to counter killers and better hunt survivors.
---
Even I on my first day was more aware and better than this tool. Honestly I wish Keem would just go away, the dudes an awful wannabe journalist who couldn't find his ass with both hands... and a map.
---
What kind of monitor are you playing on that you use this resolution? ü§î
---
Perk is made to counter bad killer habits.
---
But what happens when perk makes killer play bad? ü§î
---
Its so weird to see people say DS is overpowered or that they go after people who use DS intentionally these days. Lets be real, you were tunneling either way.
---
I didnt say the killers ruin everyone's fun. I'm saying YOU are ruining everyone's fun. And I'll keep insulting all I please, just like you keep tunneling all you please. You dont like being bullied? Cause that's exactly what you do in this game. Your arrogance and well as ignorance as astonishing and you give killers a bad name. And by the way, I play both, like a fucking champion, killer or surv. Not a douchey surv or killer main. Just an observer who is calling you out for being a twat. Not an ego trip either, it's a reality check, for your ignorant ass.
---
Wait! Is that what the update was for? No more level 20 every time I log in lol
---
‚ÄúI get soo much use out of self care! Such a great perk!‚Äù - injured survivor with 2 teammates teabagging so they can heal them
---
Theirs almost always at least 1 thing that people would like to figure out in a game because most likely they lack time to figure out on their own and some noobs that enjoy the game may want to see better players gameplay to learn tricks, explore new content they cant, etc.
---
 A little offtopic but does someone know why sometimes portal auras show up from survivors view with that weird sound in the background? What triggers that?
---
13th of every month.
---
The 13 every month I think.
---
Meg: "If it glows, it goes."
---
Me: "You idiot, I've cleansed the other three totems and we've already done 3 gens, it can't be anything else."
---
Meg: "IF IT GLOWS, IT GOES!!"
---
I helped a friend get it when we went up against a killer who decided to farm after killing two people.
---
It's very rare to get a killer willing to both help out a survivor AND kill 3 other people.
---
Trust me, I've sent my fair share of messages... might just have to derank after rank reset to try and get it.
---
Myers
---
&gt; RIP Demogorgon, we hardly knew ya. This is probably where my experience being an Xbox player may differ from those of you in the PC Master Race, but I did not see one single Demodog this entire weekend.
---
Not just you. It's an awful killer with only one serviceable perk so people stopped playing it
---
If I were killer though I assume you have bt or ds so I usually just go for the unhooker.
---
Overall, 6/10 meme. 
---
But if you imagine it in Morgan Freeman‚Äôs voice, easy 10/10, would upvote again.
---
"Baby dweet is hiding in that locker over there"
---
I‚Äôm on LF rn too. (I finished demo) I keep getting ruthless.
---
If it's actually every time it's a you problem, sorry
---
Honestly, I've never been in a match where Haunted Grounds didn't get broken; either as Killer or Survivor.
---
Even if it's the only Hex someone always cleanses it.
---
anyone was stupid enough to ever think they will make the game better, especially in its first days?
---
oh yeah it's baby survivor time
---
Yes. And awarding wiggle/recovery progress with bloodpoints would also help quite a bit.
---
When does rank reset occur
---
Was going to upvote, but you had 420 of them.
---
You can loop the fucking shit out of the chainsaws
---
Unless you're a pro streamer with an RTX 2080 Ti, you don't always want to record/stream in the same definition that you play in.  Also, you sometimes want your graphics on low just so that you can be certain that your framerate won't drop beneath 100 fps.  DBD's framerate optimization isn't optimal.
---
Sorry I should've been more clear. I meant when you just got unhooked and the killer knows it, and one of your teammates is looping, so you (having DS and head on) run to a locker in the middle of that loop and spam in and out a couple times to try and bait the killer for the grab. Then if he doesn't go for the grab (cuz he isnt an idiot) you use head on to stun him and you both get away.
---
It's not common but it does happen, an is an example of how you can use DS 'aggressively' when combined in certain ways.
---
Another quick example is if you know where the killers ruin is (maybe they are camping it) so you hop on their ruin literally forcing them to eat the DS or just let ruin get cleansed in their face
---
It's a medkit with halloween markings on it only available during halloween time. There's also a flashlight with an orange light and a ghost in the middle
---
clown and demo are both very rare to see
---
Good for you I guess?

Shitty college wifi caused the disconnect
---
what was your daily?

Sorry I can't hear you over your lack of understanding of the definion of the word "literal".
---
Best hide the username
---
One thing I am liking that has been happening lately, now idk if you have similar experiences but lately when or if i get rescued in front of the killer unless its a leatherface they will tunnel the guy that farmed me which its hard to tell if theyre just avoiding me incase ds or doing it because they know my frustration when it occurs but i think of it as they know my frustration because if theyre not tunneling because  ds its still a relief
---
He is. Yet he somehow remains a trusted influencer
---
Got it , prestiging Claudette ASAP.
---
I feel like there either needs to be more survivor perks that effect BP gain, or they could buff were gonna live for ever to give it a use outside of the bloodpoint gain. 
---
Killers have arguably one of the best perks in BBQ &amp; chili. Not only do you increase your BP gain but you get a tracking feature that ends most games. (No doubt it's easier to play around at lower ranks, but still)
---
You asked for the counter. That's it. (you can also juke chainsaws with 360s pretty easily) 
---
I should have known you weren't asking in good faith
---
Anything that has shards that is common - uncommon will be my commonly used for every character
---
I should have specified that I meant literally any other perk.
---
Shock therapy. After I completed it I guess he was the unfortunate one getting downed and then he disconnected me.
---
I thought those were extinct.
---
You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm taking it down.
---
I mean thats just bullshit unless you are godlike. Also, sorry for being rude. I'm coming off of this other thread and this guy is being a total twat saying tunneling is okay and all this shit.
---
&gt; You want to play? Mistakes have been made.
---
there is nothing i love more than internet tough guys. hilarious lmfao
---
Does that cause the HUD UI elements to appear in weird places on the screen when playing, or does the capture display those things differently than the screen used for playing?
---
Fuck off you stupid cunt. You obviously are a fucking dickhead with no actual input or useful information.
---
You‚Äôre okay with that, right? Just judging by your flair
---
I'm on PS4 and I can second this.
---
Unless 2 people get super immersed or I farm cuz DCs, either 3 people are dead or the gens are all done before the 8 minute mark.
---
I‚Äôm applying this rule
---
I have a normal 1920x1080 monitor, but I play on 1440x1080 to increase vertical field of view. It also just feels nice to be on stretched for me, since I grew up playing on an ultra wide monitor.
---
haha
---
you really have no argument at all. it's hilarious. you just suck and you don't give a shit about any advice at all
---
Rebuilding totems could make for some hilarious gameplay. I think there is room for more actions on survivor side as well. Maps like the game and Hawkins being interactive can be expanded upon, like having gens locked behind doors until another specific gen is done or levers that open one path and close another.
---
Mind blowing. Little cunts behind screens thinking they are invulnerable. You'll get yours kid.
---
No, I can run the game fine on 1920x1080, but I prefer to play on 1440x1080.
---
Holy shit these perks are sick i wish we would get atleast one of them someday
---
mate that still applies to like under rank 10. will unhook you in front of a chainsawing bubba just to get a few extra bloodpoints
---
i don‚Äôt want this to be nailed into my brain
---
Shit like this is why I don‚Äôt play survivor, bEhaviour gonna give a motherfucker a heart attack
---
Just not yours fucko.
---
Maybe do one of his weird elephant-like growls/roars.
---
Thanks. That‚Äòs a long story. We can talk about that private if you interested. But I don‚Äòt wanna start this here XD
---
There's the Rank One achievement.
---
Aww thanks, I‚Äôm glad you like them!
---
NOW THIS! THIS IS FUNNY! Shout out to all the Megs and Claudette‚Äôs with sprint burst.
---
You're a horrible waste of human space and obviously you're parents dont pay any attention to you or you wouldnt be on here seeking mine.
---
Fair lol
---
Don‚Äôt worry- even if you do fuck up, a vast majority of us won‚Äôt be that pissed so long as it wasn‚Äôt intentional.
---
Thank you. Shame it didn't get much traffic. Took too long to make.
---
not my fault you are incapable of doing something as basic as throwing a pallet to halt a one hit
---
Imagine this: lingering presence, surge, unnerving presence, ruin or surveillance on doc with obedience and calm notes in the game on a three gen.
---
Edit: lullaby instead of surveillance.
---
Using Lightborn to waste survivors flashlights
---
keep going. i'm shaking in my boots lmao
---
literally threatening me because i told you to learn to loop lmfao this is great
---
there's your game optimization +1 fps
---
But it is your fault that you act like a cunt, cunt.
---
up until rank 10 id agree. before reaching that threshold the game appears to be killer sided, once you pass that the survivors start to show how powerful they really are
---
i‚Äôm so glad they also added the endless loading screen back too! feels like i‚Äôm back playing it on pc ü•∞
---
No I'm not threatening you at all you idiot lol. You wish I cared that much huh. You need someone to care dont you?
---
"Blocking them from performing rushed actions" except for pallet vaults,  because we can't have that.
---
you're really starting to have a meltdown over vidya games eh
---
gamers rise up!
---
And kids that's why we dont check lockers
---
IM GOING TO STAB BITCHES
---
Forcing a sort of medium pallet vault would be sick and definitely push him up in the hypothetical tier list. Maybe strengthen his normal vault slowdown since it got weaker after the vault update. His main issue after that is map pressure but as long as his chase game is strong he will be an alright killer.
---
Need a hug pal?
---
Merciless victory used to be killing all 4 survivors before they changed how ranking up as killer works
---
Yes, there is no way to actually force the killer to grab you outside of being in a locker I believe.
---
I still wouldnt give the man negative 8 though, he just obviously hasnt been playing for a while which i would understand their are times when people stop playing for a bit and come back to a "complete" different experience-for those gonna criticize this note i put air quotes on complete meaning i was exaggerating
---
Or it's a console nurse
---
But if it's an edit that means he didn't actually play dbd so how would him being toxic affect the dbd community at all if he's never touched the game?

nintendo DS
---
Lol not at all sweet boy. Put your big girls pants on
---
I've seen a few killers purposely let people get it so its definitely doable. I got it that way and my friend did too, just gotta keep trying!
---
I play both sides, just because not a lot of people know how to use a free health state effectively doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fair or can be countered easily. The higher the rank you are then the better chance you find people that know what they are doing.
---
Ok.. i believe you, but do actually know if he is going to play the game? Or are you just making assumptions? Also i'm sorry, but you could've worded your original comment a bit better.
---
If we could loot chests I‚Äôm gonna be betting that every killer that wants to farm addons will just message survivors pre-game asking ‚Äúcan you bring coin?‚Äù
---
This is so fucking true
---
Is this Loss?
---
They want to touch her basekit
---
Man these are some really groundbreaking features.
---
I actually said another example in my comment lol totems. If you hop on their ruin or something they have to grab you.
---
I play killer almost exclusively but shut the actual fuck up you delusional brainlet
---
As a Nurse minor on controller in a PC world I don't feel like I'm at a disadvantage, I just feel as ridiculously over-powered as every other Nurse
---
As a survivor I honestly doubt there's a difference at all besides being able to moonwalk easier lol
---
**Insert obligatory Keemstar is a joke comment here.**
---
Keemstar gets too much hate. :/
---
That's true yeah, but having the gen done in like, 4 to 8 seconds later or almost not getting any progress at all is still a huge difference. In terms of micro management it could still affect something I suppose.
---
Ghostface, Pig and Wraith are ironically those, besides of LF, that suffer in the "drop all them pallets" scenario the most. So I'm not THAT surprised.
---
But speaking of which I'd like to repeat myself, make it so the gap between the tiers is smaller. I don't want to know that I'll win a game just because the Killer is Leatherface. Well, obviously not guaranteed, but I suppose you get what I'm trying to say. I like playing Pig and Wraith aswell so it always kinda hurts me to know that making them work just requieres so much more effort, rendering the game automatically sort of sweaty if you aint playing against donkeys.
---
Dont you think that's a little too on the nose? I dunno maybe it's just me
---
i strive to produce something as great as this
---
Oh well I‚Äôm done with the first quarter of freshman year

[https://imgur.com/a/LoUOOeT](https://imgur.com/a/LoUOOeT) here's a link to the after game screen, no DC 4k and enough emblems to pip up
---
What do you expect from a killer with no eyes?
---
A rank 4 survivor hooked someone?
---
The hitboxes have been terrible
---
I like to run STBFL, M&amp;A, ruin or something else to slow down the game and Infectious fright. For the achievement you'll probably wanna run both his ultra rare add ons but that means it will take ages to build up but you will have infinite mori
---
I wish Devour Hope lasted for 60 seconds after it was cleansed if you got 5 stack. Make getting and keeping those tokens more satisfying. Devour Hope being so strong also indirectly buffs Haunted Grounds since it is the reason survivors cleanse totems even if they don't notice any Hex effects.
---
Honestly, do you read what you write before you post? Cause this paragraph makes zero sense, and to be frank I would have thought you were a ‚Äúlittle kid‚Äù from your sentence structure and misspelling of words. 
---
But I‚Äôm confused, your second post was better, and I agree some people watch to learn small tips and tricks but I didn‚Äôt start watching until I played for 2 years or so, and I‚Äôm not a try hard.
---
It‚Äôs ok
---
Tunneling literally doesnt reward you above yellow ranks, all it does is get you hit with ds, borrowed time, and every other fucking second chance perk survivors have. If you ever made it above rank 12 you‚Äôd understand but seeing your other replies shows that you havent, so have fun living in your little world
---
Ah true, probably is harder as a killer on console cus the aim adjust is stupid and it's harder to correct when you're on a controller. Though tbh I still doubt you would need meta.
---
Talking about rape i heard some reports of him harassing girls on steam, it is a very strong acusation but the more i search about it the worse it gets

WHATCHU MEAN YOU PEOPLE

---
Killer, killed...Bad killer! GrrrreRrRRrrRrrRrR.
---
Ill solve your conundrum. Some people enjoy playing well and winning. While there are people that have fun by running around and doing memes or silly antics, others like myself enjoy putting our skills and builds to the test. For me outside of that there is no incentive to play a game.
---
Start healing. The second you start the healing process, hit LB, and it will insta-heal.
---
Is it?
---
Oh really, so if the killer doesnt down you within 60s you lose it? All this time i thought it activated once downed
---
Oh ok, thanks!
---
Why would you post a screencap of yourself being toxic
---
That's not being toxic tho
---
Entity fucking damnit
---
Pepperidge farm also remembers double pallets and the lack of killers with good chase potential outside of those in meta.
---
THIS is something I want for Huntress Lullaby since release. It's the only late-game oriented Hex next to DH, which only reveals itself once it's almost too late, and NOED, which doesn't give a fuck anyway.
---
Lullaby reveals itself immediately before it even had a chance to grow in power. This, in addition to the fact that it's entire effect is more or less unimpactful until you got the 3rd token..
---
I love the concept of the perk but it hurts that it is so ducking bad :&lt;
---
That's awful :(

i'm gonna disagree on Aftercare/Bond/Empathy, even with coms it can be good to see the *actual aura* of where they are as opposed to "coming from your left" or something like that (since it can take a second to get oriented with direction). it still provides a ton of game info, just makes it easier to access it, i suppose? certainly there's better perks to run if you're doing SWF, though
---
My guy legit slapped on a YouTube link to a DBD parody

Oh shit dude.

You're very welcome!
---
It might have something to do with how good his perks are and how they synergize together.
---
As soon as you get his teachables I suggest trying other killers with his perks escpecially Ghosface if you're enjoying the stalk mechanic.
---
&gt;!Wait I'm supposed to say fuck Ghosface because I dislike going against him!&lt;

---
Also brutality points. I can break like 10 pallets but still get like no bp from them. I can max everything else out but this? Nooooo
---
Yeah, I just find the quality of life great. Less downtime when attacking, easier to get the drop, just really fun.
---
You are a shitty person
---
How so?
---
You ever get a swf going for the flashlight save then just *UNLEASH THE MAD GRIT*

Dude it‚Äôs reddit who the fuck cares if you cuss instead of using ### lol
---
But I digress to the fact of your whole comment made no sense, I even read it aloud. 
---
But okay throw a tantrum if you want, honestly is just convincing me you are like 14 and ‚Äúlittle kids‚Äù means like 11 year olds to you. 
---
There‚Äôs a difference in not caring about grammar and spelling and everything you write coming out as jumbled words jumping from one point to another, it‚Äôs just confusing.
---
I love making a creative killer build because the strategy comes over time. And once YOU know YOUR strategy, it's a race against time for the survivors to figure you out before you can get them all. It's a real fun challenge
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Just happened to me lol
---
And then your team does the sensible thing and just stays on gens, and get called filthy genrushers.
---
old devour hope was better. I'd intentionally leave it at rank 1 so survivors couldn't tell anything was happening until shit hit the fan at 5 stacks.
---
Are dedicated servers live for everyone?
---
Admit it.
---
You fear the unknown.
---
Feels bad man. :(
---
So here's my take on when to hide portals: you only really want to hide portals that you want to keep the whole game. Think like, the main building in Ormund. It gives you good vision and is a good center point of the whole map. It's always going to be useful to be able to teleport here so you don't necessarily want the portal to be next to the gen where it keeps getting broken. Plus, you can see the gen from super far away so you don't need the information that Of the Abyss provides.
---
But now think about that gen that's all the way in the corner but you still want to keep for whatever reason. Having an activated portal on that gen puts slight pressure on it without you even being there. If survivors try to do the gen, you can press right click whenever you want and find them and interrupt their progress. If they close the portal, that's still a win because a) you know they are there and b) they just wasted time that they would have been doing the gen. And if they complete the gen and then break it that's even better for you because that portal was irrelevant and now you have the token back.
---
Same goes for using the portal to guard Ruin/ totems. You want to place that bitch right on top of it and activate it ASAP. You can keep checking it and tp over when you see them working on it. It's also really difficult to break the portal AND still have enough time to break Ruin, especially if you have other portals in the area. Plus it goes back to the same general rule: once ruin's gone that portal is dead to you, so why bother hiding it? You get way more utility of having it patrol the map for you. Just make sure you are constantly checking them and multitasking, the portals are by no means easy to use but they are very powerful. 
---
The only time you want to hide every portal is if you're using the addons that make him super sneaky after he comes out of the portal. You get a pretty large amount of time with no terror radius so if you place the portals a little far away and use tracking perks like Surveilance he can get a lot of free hits on gens until they catch on.
---
They do indeed suck.
---
To be fair. I default to spirit if I see a SWF group because I'm not about to get bullied.
---
Just a little more and we can make that +2 fps.
---
Man i just love how people fail to see to look at the different possibilities when I was literally just saying how it couldve been, i hope the ones that do are little kids because if not theyre really gonna screw people over in the future if they have power because one thing you gotta be able to do in life is look at all your options/possibilities
---
I thought Freddy's glove was god?
---
Red ranks, for me at least, are the no fun zone. It's the serious time, we don't play games here rank and I hate it.
---
BBQ and chili: uses Apple Pay for extra money. As an added bonus, each survivor has a phone and every time the killer hooks they use find my iPhone to track survivors

Really? Thats all you took? He was seeing and experimenting if he was able to have a normal game with the addon without anyone dcing  and without him using perks because if people played the game they would figure out that he wasnt running anything

Optimization is the PS4 has been horrendous since the ST update

Sure I will have fun in a red dark world called rank 1. If you don't know how to tunnel correctly, you will never go beyond yellow ranks.
---
When you will learn it, you will understand what I am talking about.
---
Happy 18th, my dude!
---
Interesting idea, I'll have to try that. I'm a bad killer and play skill check doc when I feel toxic, so the goal is usually to tier everyone up ASAP lol
---
It always seems to pull you in too!!
---
Judging by the salt I think you're probably not a nurse main so thank you my good man.
---
As a rank 1 survivor I think some of us get sick of getting destroyed by nurses that the second someone comes on with a difficult build and we manage to win we lose our shit.
---
In my experience in the post-game chat nurses defo get the most abuse / early DCs

They'll probably have to liquify their bones like Santana to squeeze inside of one.

Regardless of how bad things are as a killer in a match, I never disconnect. Finding a match takes too long and I‚Äôd like to get some bloodpoints at least.

Ah, I dig it, TBH, I don't have any of those perks, I just rely on strat of hooking someone first before treatment. I wouldn't know what's more dependable long term, I just know he ruined that SWF group, so fast.
---
That's what you get for playing spirit with prayer beads lol

No my friend just PC players

Lery‚Äôs or Hawkins. Gideon is also acceptable but it‚Äôs on thin ice if the survivors have a brain.

What if every survivor had a different idle animation?

Finally, someone gets it.
---
Shack isn‚Äôt that powerful against a good huntress though
---
I mean that‚Äôs really not the same, but I agree it‚Äôd be nice.
---
God forbid someone uses something for experimentation then its suddenly not fun when the rest of the crew is using meta perks against you, righto bud maybe you should go back to COD.
---
Can you easily control your camera like good survivors do? I dont see that happening tbh.
---
I'll field this one, Steven.
---
I just got done playing on Ormond against a Myers. If my lockers were untextured it would've been perfect.
---
No, I don't. In general, multiplayer horrors lose their sense of scariness and dread because it's an online game that's played over and over again. With each match, you continue learning how to play the game and gain a sense of confidence. In fact, the same goes for singleplayers, but singleplayer experiences are longer, scripted, and should be scary because, well, they're horror experiences that aren't replayed every 10 minutes.
---
My first match as survivor was terrifying. My 5th was not. The same goes for any other asym I've played. You realize that it's just another player coming after you and you have specific tools at your disposal to master so you can "combat" the killer. The unpredictable becomes predicable very quickly.
---
For DBD multiplayer, absolutely not. The top comment is exactly why it wouldn't work: "It'd be neat but goodbye mind gaming loops and spatial awareness." Sure, running from the killer in first person would be pretty tense and scary the first few times. But, like all horror experiences, you'll lose that pretty quick and begin to notice how crippled you are as a survivor. If you couldn't loop and look behind you as a survivor, 2 big parts of the survivor gameplay experience are cut out. Both are very important defenses that you use against the killer.
---
So essentially, I'm not saying it's a terrible idea in general. It's a terrible idea for the multiplayer mode because it'd be severely unbalanced, crippling to players, and is taking away big aspects of the gameplay. Make it an option for KYF, an exploration mode or something like the F13 Virtual Cabin, and it's just fine. I hope that clears up my point.

I'll see if the prompts allow it :)

 :')
---
Pretty good for me. Less latency problems resulting in BS hits
---
No, when you use it its gone, but you can have 2 chances in a game to use it, after being unhooked.
---
Whwn youre unhooked the timer counts down, use it when the timer is ticking and its gone, dont use it and next time your unhooked you can use it.
---
I can understand it but I still think spirit is inherently broken.

Listen man you can‚Äôt just say some shit like ‚Äúemoji bad‚Äù and not expect someone to say something! People can say whatever they want, and if they like using emojis so be it.

r/technicallythetruth
---
A bit of both, if you speak to a killer like that after  game you can ask and compliment them on directly avoiding a tunnel, seeing as killers get told to have their mother raped and murdered in front of them frequently, a compliment on them doing well and playing by the imaginary rules despite not needing to goes a long way.
---
Personally, when i just chase the unhooker, it still has its benefits and im good enough that i dont need to tunnel to do well.
---
Why can't they enjoy the game without you?
---
Been really smooth sailing for me on PC. Game feels way now responsive.
---
what's the difference? don't do gens when a killer is nearby and be a scared immersed blendette? Killer has all the power in the world to stop survivors from doing gens, how is it the survivors fault if the killer just want to mindlessly chase someone instead of getting Meg off the gen 2 feet from him? I mean you can even hear the gen being worked on. You're fucking kidding right lol
---
ok bye
---
Im so sorry, man. That hurts. If that happened to me id shut the game, switched my laptop off  and didnt touch it till the next day at least.
---
I wonder if you would've still made it out in time if he didn't hit you at the end there? Preventing you from getting a speed boost. That was too close lmao.
---
Major feels bro
---
Your thinking of why was it not obvious that it was sarcasm is that you knew that you weren't trying to be an asshole in anyway, and your mindset was that everyone knew that.
---
But the internet is the last place to think that anyone is meaning the brighter side of what they are saying
---
What I find the worst is how long you wait to find a lobby, it's ridiculous. With survivors I'm in a lobby in under a minute and it barely takes 3 mins for the game to start. Plus I like the variety of objectives,the uncertainty and the stress I have as a survivor. It's weird I know but most of the community seems to agree with me
---
And he still got looped for all of tier 3
---
I study bird law
---
&gt;Why can't they enjoy the game without you?
---
I take it you don't have friends to play with.
---
Dokkaebi as a killer pls
---
Spooky
---
I don't like that I'd tap Entity Nea
---
Dont you get points from repairs or I'm I just crazy 
---
But in general everyone needs more BPs I'd say just increase the amounts but I dont know how that would work
---
How did the match end?
---
Yes it sounds like hes a tunneler 
---
BUT Remember 
---
DS is active for a minute, when im killer i can sometimes get 2/3 hooks a minute, maybe more with a heavy hitting killer like tier 3 MM, i have been decisively struck plenty of times after chasing and downing a healthy survivor, because when DS is ticking down they will take the chase from someone else just to pop it off.
---
You arent always tunneling when you get  stabbed.
---
I'll have to play more, but so far, I haven't been impacted too badly by any latency.
---
Some people see a Disconnect more as their own skill rather than just general frustration at the game.
---
So what are you trying to say here? Are you saying I‚Äôm killer sided because it would be a lot easier to say so.
---
It‚Äôs just bad luck.
---
But you have it as a teachable perk right?
---
I am rank 1. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so frustrated. It‚Äôs depressing when you unhook someone and you know the killer isn‚Äôt nearby and they decide to run across the map RIGHT TO WHERE THE KILLER WAS ACTUALLY AT. 
---
People ask this all the time and I genuinely dont know why. Perks are RNG, thats all there is to it.
---
The search will expand over time if you don‚Äôt find a match. Eventually, it will allow people up to 5 ranks above or below you to be matched with you.
---
Nope, you are nitpicking and biased, I win, bye-bye
---
Pressing spacebar at a pallet compared to finding a survivor in good time, chasing them and while taking every measure to minimise the length of the chase also lesrning the map, prediciting movement and assessing at intervals if the chase is going to be productive or if you should chase a nearby survivor.
---
Yeah it's really not hard when you've been playing on controllers for 14 odd years
---
As the Survivor, I have literally done that single person generator on Badham Preschool on the second floor of the house, WHILST the killer was chasing someone on the same floor I was on, and they didn't go for the hit or the grab. The only reason I stayed there was because the killer was tunneling that player, so either they'd carry on tunneling + I'd get the gen for free (what happened) or they'd split off to hit me, and the tunneled survivor could get away. Either way it was a result I was okay with.
---
The killer called me a genrusher afterwards, as if he was completely powerless to stop me.
---
Head on :)
---
Always mess up with the timing. But its so much fun to get the killer stunned like this, how they avoid walking past lockers for the end of the match. And as the killer I never go mad at locker stuns, I smile like 'okay, you got me there', no hypocrisy.
---
Feels bad, I only pop it when there's no pallet.
---
It just seems so weird that I haven't been able to find tier 2 iron will in months. It feels bugged to me?
---
Maybe instead of going on a ‚Äúside‚Äù maybe you should play both killer and survivor and see the bs both ‚Äúsides‚Äù have to deal with.
---
Because for some people the enjoyment comes from playing with their friends.
---
I got this a few weeks ago thanks to a cool killer because my last teammate DC'd
---
Shut
---
That's not bad at all. Expecting everyone to be exactly your rank is stupid.
---
Enjoy but kills me? The Pebble(trademark pending) or Borrowed Time. Usually the random i get off hook is... dim and doesn‚Äôt take a hit so both of us can get away from the basement camping, people eating bubba who just tried to slam his mallet down on my skull.
---
I have a p3 level 50 Jeff who I have filled the level 50 blood web with over 50 times. He still has rank 2 after care.  Just have to pray to RNGesus for the good stuff.
---
*Initiate Cloak Mode*
---
Either way i‚Äôm gonna probably die if you‚Äôre better than a braindead squirrel.
---
You play on ps4 right?
---
No, even past rank 10. I‚Äôm at rank 4 and I get a mix of purple and red rank teammates, they‚Äôre all bad. Sometimes you‚Äôll get a good group of solo survivors but most times it‚Äôs just they‚Äôre bad but the killer is worse or didn‚Äôt play well enough. Survivor rank means jack shit, if you play enough you‚Äôll get to red ranks. Solo q is far worse than killer
---
If you play your best game as killer then you‚Äôll 4k, if you play your best game as a solo q survivor then you‚Äôll escape ONLY if your teammates do shit. But eventually time just runs out and people get closer to death hook, and then it‚Äôs GG
---
I sat in that last locker for about 5 minutes until the doctor finally figured out I was there. Tossed me on a hook while his little buddy spam unhooked me lol. Last I saw spectating was the Doctor trying to electrocute a tree while little fella failed multiple skill checks trying to fix a free generator. üòÇ
---
Noob question: what does haunted grounds do?
---
According to OP, that's not the case.
---
I'd say it's a tie
---
Yes! I had to repair 3 gens, but after equipping a purple toolbox and doing 3 full gens, I noticed it had changed to do 180 seconds of cooperative action. I assumed I‚Äôd misread, equipped Bond, and made sure to do actions with other survivors the entire match. No reward after match end, because now the ritual is to chainsaw survivors with the Hillbilly. It‚Äôs very frustrating!
---
It's one of those high risk, high reward plays for killers. Almost always gets found... But those few time when it doesn't is so satisfying.
---
I need to get a dev stream before halloween month is over so i can see the devs dressed up as killers and survivors.
---
Dang, haven't you ran out of perks to pop up on his web?
---
Is Quentins perks worse than other survivors or something?
---
Damn, did you report them?
---
Imagine complaining about "pallet camping" lmao.
---
They're here in casual staff uniforms but they seem to love my legion lol.
---
Fuck me
---
Yeah I'm skeptical lol that timer was cloooose
---
60 seconds is a long time after getting unhooked. That would mean you have been chased for a full minute off the hook, still injured. 1 hit in 1 minute. That is a long tunnel. 
---
If you have time to be fully healed, you are not being tunneled. 
---
The majority of DS use I have seen is not for tunneling but for strategic stunning a killer, usually to prevent someone else from getting downed by jumping into a chase or a locker as a decoy. 
---
I think a minor improvement to DS would be it deactivates if you are healed. You can still locker DS, but you have to stay injured for that whole minute.
---
If you're playing on PC then i think it's because of the dedicated servers but I'm not sure
---
I havent really played much since they started giving iut 4 perks a blood web so I'm sure I would get it of I took a little time. Just putting points in other survivors and killers atm. RNG is just spotty in this game.
---
Exactly. They love cosplayers(from what i‚Äôve heard) so why not try it out for themselves. Just imagine going into s dev stream about the next chapter or something and Mccote is Myers and his two ‚Äúguests‚Äù are survivors.
---
GUBBEY WE NEED CLOWNüò≠
---
Adapt and practice and not get caught in the first place if being seen is your weakness. Play more safely and earn your way out to better ranks
---
Yeah we should make a block of text to explain the meme to everyone who doesn't play the game the subreddit is about.
---
I basically only disconnect when the people in game with me are deemed not worth my time, even as killer, before edc when 4 people wouod be tbagging at the gate i would just pull the plug, cash out my score and leave the 4 animals with nothing.
---
As survivor, ill only dc when its obvious im being farmed by dickhead teammates or the killer is for no reason  a toxic prick.
---
Logic being, this is my free time, im not gifting it to people so i can suffer while they have the time of their lives at my expense. I wouldnt play soccer with someone cheating or elbowing people in the face.
---
I‚Äôd say survivor mains are worse because there‚Äôs a 1/4 chance to get a toxic survivor. 
---
Killers are one of. 
---
Toxic survivor mains can be 4 man 3 man 2 man or single person.
---
As someone who plays both, I would say survivors. I know I should say that both sides are equally toxic but survivors, in my experience, are WAY more toxic.

But also to be fair I feel like SWF groups are also broken. They ignore half of the things that would give the killer any edge. Half of the perks you can just ignore because oh wait I can tell my friends where I am.

Killers doing something? Everybody knows. Have a plan? No you dont you're playing against a SWF group. If SWF is broken, I see the Spirit as the hotfix.

Of fucking course, it's keemstar

Exactly this, imagining survivors actually feeling entitled to bring an item (even an event item) but not have to experience the counterplay (Franklin's Demise) is a horrible thought.
---
But it'll probably happen.
---
Nothing. Just play as good as you can to rank up. You will get better Teammates and also Killers that do not camp the hook.

Like I said. RNG. There are a lot of survivor perks.

I'm embarrassed at how many times I've watched this video today. I was also singing the song at work T.T Who's afraid of a buuuuuully?

Exactly. DS should be deactivated if you fully heal. This still leaves some strategy to be a decoy, but it comes at the risk of being M1‚Äôed and not being able to make it to a locker to force a grab. 
---
If you have time to be healed, you are not being tunneled.
---
Well theirs still little kids here and im a bit more mature than that and i try not to waste as much time on grammer but im talking to people who still have to criticize it because they have nothing better to do but whatever i guess i give up when im talking to people without lives it is pointless to argue with them even though, and forgive me if this wasnt the original topic, but when this whole argument was based off me stating a possibility of what it couldve been, not criticism, just exclaiming how i wouldve thought it would be setup better and the fact that no one had argued that my statement was incorrect(but now that i mentioned it you probably will), tells me you guys just like trolling others because not once did you correct my statements, you just stated that what i said on how it could be, is not what it is and pretty much telling me to shut up and being elementary bullies calling me stupid for not caring about how i type but whatever, if this is how you guys get entertainment when youre not playing, so be it
---
Must be a new killer. You ALWAYS check the sides of that gate first.
---
I swear I get 2 gens done by myself just ignoring the hex before they get it. They always stop on the gen as soon as they see hex

You forgot the swearing and accusations of tunneling in the chat after the game.

Having fun in this game isnt allowed anymore. It's just become the equivalent of an online shooter where everyone fucks everything up for everyone else and then talks shit.

---
Like the multiplayer map in conker's bad fur day? Fun times
---
&gt; it's because of the dedicated servers
---
Yes. It happens all the time to survivors. It's never happened to me as killer though.
---
Hmm. My local group has never had it take more than 36 hours for a reply. Though it's entirely possible there a backlog from DBW and the Dedicated Servers release, over a week still seems excessive.
---
It kind of is the equivalent of gen-rushing depending on your point of view.
---
All five gens can pop in 2 minutes (and it takes 156 seconds according to the dude who wrote up the last post to actually escape through open gates) easily, less than 2 minutes w/ toolboxes.
---
This is generally done in a fashion that makes the last three generators easier to complete.
---
So too is tunneling to make sure a survivor dies ASAP/before two minutes and make the last three survivors easier to kill, given that three survivors repairing means they escape in 156 seconds, you absolutely do need to kill one...
---
In the current balance/meta you need a survivor dead by the 60 second mark, ideally.
---
No, it happens also before dedicated servers
