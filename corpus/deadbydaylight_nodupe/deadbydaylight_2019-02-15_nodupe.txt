Crouching waste a lot more time than you think, I'd love if the survivors crouched around the map , scared of the traps. In a gen rush meta, that would waste heaps of time.

Dominate Strategy creates problems in any game. It stifles player creativity and creates an bland and unfun environment. 
---
If every single killer exclusively played nurse with only the best addons and perks. Along with practicing till their fingers bled every game making every match consist of a 5 minute game where they simply slugged everyone. Now  I assure you that you would be complaining about killers being too focused on winning and people would be using your same argument to back themselves up.
---
Instead of this we actually have a very wide field for Killers as many don't like playing the same killer every game. Some killers don't have gen pressure and must instead rely on their perks. And most killers cannot succeed as well as nurse in 5 minutes.
---
Some Killers just want to have a **fun game**. Where they. Get this, *interact* with survivors for longer than 5 minutes. A novel concept I sure, but one you certainly don't seem to understand.
---
The weirdest thing is that the core actual fun element of Dead by Daylight is the chase, doing a gen rush in comparison is holding one button then hitting the space bar every once and a while. And yet people do it as fast as they can due to the fact that the current grind is so god awful and they simply want to win, not to play the game.
---
Ew
---
Thank you, I would like to know how to play hillbilly better without getting too predictable?
---
I mean if that's what you think I just remember to say Ive been called a shitty for such and such dumb reason. I have 1650 hours so I at least have to have some skill on killer so I really don't care what other people say about it lol
---
Now wait until you enter the entity.
---
I PLAYED AGAINST A FOUR GROUP SWF AND THEY ALL TRASHED ME, FLASHLIGHTS, TEABAGGING ETC. NSTEAD OF LEAVING THEY STAYED ON THE MAP FOR FIVE MINUTES. I DCED AND GOT THREE DIFFERENT MESSAGES ABOUT HOW I RAGEQUIT, HOW MUCH OF A LOSER AND NOOB I AM AND THAT I SHOULD KILL MYSELF. GO FUCK YOURSELVES YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES
---
You don't have to take it so personally when your opponent rushes their objective, it's pretty cunty IMO to support the double standard, gens can be rushed but not killers, when it's each side's only objective. It's just straight up entitlement. Nobody likes being rushed out of a match early, but there's no difference between getting gen rushed out of it or kill rushed, just your level of empathy for each side.
---
"I think of myself as above the average person"
---
Cats on devs keyboards when they program at home.
---
Good idea.
---
&gt;You will have the Broken status effect for the rest of the trial.
---
Oh hell no. Basically makes you no mither but with no benefits once you're broken. If it was a timed broken status like Deliverance, that would be alright. But definatley not permanent. 
---
I personally don't think DS needs a rework since it has counters (dribbling, enduring, etc.) 
---
Ex console player here. The frame drops literally killed the game for me. Decided to move to pc. But it’s still a great game. I’m honestly eager to play the switch version while laying in bed with head phones. And are you running PS4 pro?
---
I meant for OS's in general. I know DBD isn't compatible with Mac, sorry for the confusion.  
---
Whiteface, in this day and age?
---
it’d be kind of cool if he could blind survivors with his helmet idk lol. it’d probably be a shit power but oh well 
---
Is this a joke? Hahaha...
---
... Oh wait, they're serious. Oh God. 
---
The other 75% of the achievements?
---
Every nurse head is already set up for that though...
---
Do you have stupid?
---
Pug as killer: camps with insta chainsaws and ebony moris. calls survivors bad. 
---
&gt;Tunneling =/= Gen rush
---
Yeah it does. A five minute match lasts the same amount of time regardless of how you were rushed out of it. You know you're not *actually* dying, right? It's just the game's aesthetic so I get the confusion, but surviving isn't any more or less noble than killing, they're just objectives so we should all try harder to take it less personally. 
---
This is hilarious omg how hasn't this been thought of 
---
Im open to ideas!  IMO the only nerf DS needs is to non obs, since thats the real bitch.  This change still gives non obs a fighting chance but allows the Obs to get off their DS
---
This would be cool and actually fut in really well
---
Insane defence.
---
Insane map pressure.
---
Ability to be many places at once quickly,
---
Ability to hit many survivors quickly.
---
Ability to counter any loop in 2 seconds.
---
Still able to soft lead players into loops.
---
Hag is mental. 
---
Having multiple independent witnesses for something *is* evidence. It's even good enough evidence that it would be admitted in court.
---
You say that, but I've seen many people confusing *your* and *you're*. It's not like he typed an extra letter or something, he wrote a different word. 
---
And you as a survivor can just go around 99%'ing each gen instead of popping them ASAP when you think the match is going too quickly for your opponent. That sounds dumb as shit though when I say it like that, right?
---
When the game came out, I played a few games with trapper. Since I started playing again, I only play huntress. I like her song. 
---
6 seconds comes with an extra hook progression state
---
Beast of Prey users wya
---
No
---
I think the wiggle speed is a surprise (to give non obs a fighting chance), but the killer will see that if the survivor wiggles out, DS will show in the bottom right, so they know the bonus wiggle speed is gone.
---
No. People are saying killers tunnel because its just them focusing on eliminating each player at a time. Im only saying its funny because it doesnt always work
---
Could you imagine a map based entirely in a mine shaft? That would so awesome! 
---
You'd be surprised how effective just looking away for a little works.  It can do wonders on the rock-loops on McMillan
---
Depends on the survivor's skill obviously
---
Which cosmetics, I cant find any that look good
---
he loves you too
---
When survivors do that though, they are not doing gens which is good, and also, the killer knows where their totem is. They know where they need to protect to keep it from being broken.

Won a game against a NOED Hag with this combo and it was by far my most satisfying win. I run those two perks on every survivor that I have both for.  Definitely tied for my favorite combo along with Tenacity and Unbreakable.
---
Fun? Winning is Fun. Also "interact with survivors"? Wtf? What's wrong with wanting to win ffs? Should I want to lose?
---
NOED is okay to use in general. It has the bad effect of rewarding victories that were for the most part undeserved, and unfortunately that encourages the kind of play that got into that situation, but that doesn't mean the perk is unfair.
---
The most recently released is pretty good for her, imo. The one with the green hair

Why not just run a dual boot system at this point?    You can boot windows to play games that arent supported in Linux and you can switch between OS as needed.

One time that happened for so long I just started selfcaring.

don't know why they downvote you

apparently boring to play against and no current counterplay outside of timed pallets stuns.

Okay okay, I’m a mediocre Billy at best. Hillbilly’s add ons can tailor his ability to hunt and kill survivors, etc Silent Billy, Quick saw Billy, and add ons to make steering a lot smoother. 
---
Hillbilly is a 4.6ms killer which puts him at a steady advantage in chases. Maps like Coldwind, Crotus Prenn, and Backwater Swamp can work at the Hillbilly’s advantage. While Lery’s is hated by the majority of Billy mains.
---
Predictability with Billy gets more or less countered depending on what rank you’re in, you can fake out your chainsaw, and use map control perks to expose altruism and destroy survivors in the open. 
---
I’m a rank 1 survivor/killer, and Hillbilly’s are extremely painful to play against, he has a really good lunge range, and I recommend taking extreme advantage of it.
---
I’m not too seasoned at Billy for gimmick/meta build advice, but the infamous BBQ &amp; Billy would be a great to start. MYC, Nurse’s, Spirit Fury, Ruin, Discordance, and Enduring are some good perks to play around with.
---
I’m really experienced with Nurse, Hag, Spirit, and Doctor. I’m learning the Pig right now! If you have any questions regarding them lmk :)
---
me either wtf this community is beautiful 
---
One of the strongest perks in the game becomes one of the weakest.  Even Bill's last man generator perk would be better.

I too, subscribe to Dead Meat.

I just picked up a monster gaming laptop and am considering getting this on steam now. I have it on both the X and the Pro and there isn't any performance issues that hinder the game. My problem is that there just isn't any players at lower ranks … it takes forever to find a lobby and I missed out on the event. 
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to argue to me. I don't think you correctly understood the point of my post. 
---
Drawing allegories between the two things doesn't accomplish anything. They are separate concepts.
---
We can debate whether or not the game goes too fast, or we can debate whether or not tunneling should be encouraged by the game mechanics. Pointing at an issue on the survivor side doesn't provide defense for a killer issue or vice versa. 
---
Like most incredibly broken bullshit addons, it’s cancer to face. 
---
I’m open to ideas, but saying it’s worse then left behind is saying a lot.
---
Survivors are actually in a slightly weaker spot rn so DS doesn’t need a rework right away, this is just a concept.
---
I’m open to suggestionssss 
---
My emotions went about as follows:
---
"Okay... Heartbeat... Injured person... **RUN BITCH, RUN!"**
---
Your argument is that they didn’t capitalise the I
---
That's the platinum trophy 
---
Not on reddit
---
Yes, which triggers only once you've completed the *base game* achievements. None of the DLC achievements have to be done for this. No Evil Incarnate, Skilled Huntress, Item of Obsession, Adept David/Laurie, Not Today, Deranged Pursuit. Hell I don't even know if console HAS Left for Dead or Taking One for the Team.
---
Also, a vast majority of console achievements are significantly quicker than PC, their "use killer power" achievements are anywhere from 1/3 to 1/10th the requirements (10 survivors pulled out of traps vs 100, 100 blink attacks vs 500) with the only exception being Skilled Huntress, which just got lowered.
---
Point is, why post a 'platinum' that's a participation trophy, post a shot when you get 100% if you *need* to.
---
Susie is fucking hideous

I rather autohaven than coldwind. So tired of coldwind

Yes on Reddit. If you constantly misspell words or else just constantly use obviously had grammar, I’m gonna think you either couldn’t even get a GED or else you just have a disability the keeps you from typing properly. 
---
1. I think that's fair, but is that more or less frustrating than getting hooked early, farmed for points, and de-pipping while your teammates rank up thanks to doing gennies after you die + farming you?   
---
2. Escape very calculatedly doesn't factor in here -- yes, you need to do gennies, but why are Survivors ranking up from games where no gennies got done to begin with?   
---
3. Obviously the only way to know here would be to test it out, but I suspect that saves wouldn't drop to zero -- in point of fact, you almost certainly are more incentivized to go for saves and make your saves smarter, since if survivors die early you're way less likely to have the time or space to pip. 
---
It’s reddit, nobody puts fucking effort into it you fucking grammar nazi
---
You’re totally right, the uneducated ones don’t put effort into it. 
---
Who cares about camping totems that is just pure salt. If they guard their totems then just do the gens, it only matters if the killer camps a hooked survivor essentially taking them out the game. 
---
Id totally pick him as my choice for next killer
---
How vile. 
---
she’s third with 17.3% :) 
---
I suppose with only 1 DS a game, a timed broken status is better 
---
How fucking un-experienced are you with the internet to think people give a shit about their grammar when nobody knows who they are?

[It has](http://puu.sh/CMmhR/4d5889eee8.png)
---
I know, and the best part is, next to two totems were two gens. (Thank you, totem spawns!) So why on earth would I even bother checking the generator across the map, pop it, I'm not wasting my time with it. Hag is slow and smol.
---
Why would you get banned for this?

OP took your advice

Nothing like trying to get all sensual rubbing her shoulders and my hand is sliced open.

I love this. I'm not tech savvy at all and wanted the wheel, but wasn't sure how to go and make one!  Now it's bookmarked. Thank you.

Good practice too as you start to notice the tricks, the behaviors and tells. Assuming you can stay calm and not rage.

I've seen every type of guy do this, except for Asian dudes.

Yeah that’s pretty obvious to see.

I literally just bought this body and head combo yesterday. I like the Chrome skull better with it though.

Not like you were in any danger. sprint burst for the win xd

Yeah, we used to play perk and killer roulette when we played kyf. We used to sit there and wait for the wheel to spin for everything then I found this one and it was great for the instant response.
---
Same if it wasn’t for you I’d have been duped
---
Damn, just about as toxic as survivors getting face-camped.
---
I bought this game on last winter sale,like on the first week?About 110 hours in,and I can easily tell getting higher ranks on killer is far easier than survivor.I played only survivor because I'm at a dorm so the wifi cant handle being a host,but I am at my parents for a month now and I managed to reach rank 8 in like 3 weeks with huntress
---
Nice try behavior, but if PS+ wasn't enough for me to try console DbD, I doubt the switch will.

Yeah of course. I mean she should've gotten a 90% at least

Actually yes, it was just a one letter difference that coincidentally made another word but you still understood what he was trying to say so you can leave it alone
---
Lmfao. You serious? Theres ATLEAST 10k of them.
---
I love this so much, thank you for sharing &lt;3
---
Well this is more for killer in general in case you don't have any teachable or not all
---
They changed it so that any movement cancels the heal. Before you had to hold the sprint button to cancel the heal but not many people knew so they made it easier to cancel the heal. You have to be completely still to be healed. Moving the thumbstick on the controller slightly or pressing W, A, S or D on keyboard will cancel the heal. 
---
I would slap my credit card on this so fast, yes please.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You're such a coward.
---
True true. Bookmark it for when you play kyf great.
---
This is a great idea
---
Brought an eboni into a match the other day and 3/4 of the survivors disconnected during the mori.  I was so disgruntled I gave the fourth one the hatch.
---
I always thought I was the only one who liked this movie my friends never liked it glad to see I'm not the only one who though that him in the game wouldn't be a bad idea.
---
I think we all knew the RBT was going to be in the box given it’s size. I still think Hoffman signalled the deathknell of the series though, because with both Amanda and John dead at that point, there was no one worthy in my mind to take up Jigsaw’s mantle apart from Dr. Gordon, and they word of god said he was dead when 4 came out (which pissed me off intensely when 7 came out).
---
But then they turned around and made... some guy ANOTHER apprentice in Saw 8. I get they were going for a soft reboot, but honestly, the series is dead to me at this point. Jigsaw isn’t John, but Tobin Bell in my mind. He really is what made that role work, and I doubt they’ll be able to capture lightning in a bottle like they did with him (even if he seemed to be phoning it in for the last couple films).
---
Don’t get me wrong, I loved these movies when they first came out, but at this point they really haven’t aged gracefully and the plots have become a Gordian knot of storytelling.
---
Up the ante is 3% for every survivor alive so 9% per up the ante for everyone if all 4 bring up the ante that's 36% luck for everyone that to your 4% now you have 40% luck. You can also add a vigos jar of salt lips which is 3% per adding up to 12% if everyone brings one. Add your 40% from earlier and now you have 52% luck or a 52% chance to get off of the hook or bear traps, if you add slippery meat you now have a 77% chance to get out of bear traps and 6 chances to get off the hook with a 52% chance.
---
I think allowing him to use lockers to teleport or messing with survivors aura reading abilities. Something like his terror radius can be decreased to 0 and it then emanates from a survivor. My Bloody Valentine is a murder mystery, so his abilities should keep survivors guessing as to his location. Kind of like The Pig, but with an emphasis of sudden, random murder sprees rather than silent assassinations/kidnappings.
---
No u

Respect for the lesser-known slashers out there! I love Harry Warden &amp; it’d be awesome to see a killer of some kind take reference from him or even BE him.

Other people aren't able to be pleased at all.

Start a gofundme to pay BHVR the expenses for a new Susie VA?

I only camp if their buddies are there/gates are powered TBH. They ate time trying the hook/if I leave they run off into the sunset

OH GOOD LORD NO.

Or just get Pig’s VA to voice her. It makes sense to me. And get Myers’ VA to voice Joey

Well, if you happen to be someone who is easy to please, perhaps you should acknowledge that and refrain from saying other people are too entitled for not wanting to get your ears raped whenever you get Haddonfield

Why decisive? It’s a free second chance, there’s no situation where you’d be worse off because you brought decisive.  Even if the killer juggles you’re still wasting their time

Ok that was kinda funny.

I can't believe people in here are saying this will be one of the worst perks LMAO. Broken doesn't mean jack, survivors don't heal anyway at high ranks. Just rush the gens.

God damn

Yeah, i dont necessarily think controllers are the problem. Its not like this game is an FPS, theres virtually no difference in M/KB and conroller for this game. The problem is, the console port of this game is awful. Glitches, bugs, awful framerate drops, all around lag/connectivity issues no matter how good your internet is, looooooooooooooong ass wait times, its hard to play killer effectively on console due to shitty hitboxes and framerate issues that cause survivors to be one place on your screen but another on their screen. Console is in desperate need for that "optimization pass" as they call it. We dont need it this summer, we need it right now. I love this game to death, but the devs seem to not care as much about us console players. 
---
I want the original video please link
---
I think people are taking the wrong message away from the Depip squad experiments, where out of 100 games the killer safety pipped or better 17 times.  So the top 17% of killers went even or better against the top fraction of a percent 4 man SWF squad playing solely to make the killer Depip.  14 of those killers pipped or double pipped.  I believe that may have even been just after the emblem system was introduced, before it became more lax on the pipping requirements as well (not 100% sure on that part though).  Of course that doesn't push the narrative they were trying to force, but the stats are there.
---
Most killers would fall into that bottom 83% of killers who don't live DbD and facing SWF groups like that isn't very fun.  Having everyone escape after getting looped for 3 minutes is frustrating, and makes the game feel far too fast for the killer to even stand a chance.  Facing the best case scenario survivors isn't fair or balanced for the less than top tier of killer players.
---
I actually think the game is more balanced than it gets credit for overall, but people always need something else besides themselves to blame for their loses.  Whether you lost from a 4 stack decisive SWF or from a tunneling NOED killer, you likely could have done *something* better.
---
Oh. So, I should learn to play properly when a random doesn't know to unhook? Sounds very fair. Spoken like a true killer main who doesn't know how annoying it is to get farmed by idiots.
---
Nice.

I wish there was an option to disable it entirely tbh. Some people have just... Not been very nice to me in end game chat. 
---
Wow all this hate because you think Orchido is funny. Makes me want to watch his videos just because of your guys childish reactions
---
I'm assuming you have most other killers at p3 already?
---
honestly, get used to laugh about it or ignore it.
---
But you dont see the Chat if you minimize it, so that might be what you want 
---
Never said I was. Only giving it as an excuse for others. There's nothing wrong with defending BHVR, some people are genuinely satisfied with a game. (Also some people on this sub are genuinely too entitled, but that comes with reddit and fanbases.)
---
Also Haddonfield isn't that loud, though maybe I have the game on too quiet. I will say it's admittedly louder than the rest of the maps, though.
---
So far I have Myers, Leatherface, Freddy, Pig, Doc and Legion to P3, with the others at around P1/P2

just you

Wow, well congrats again mate. Good luck in the fog

You too! Thank you!

Idk why you're being downvoted but hell ya

Against any killer that has a terror radius the injury music will be irrelevant because you wont hear foot steps or killer ambient sounds over the heartbeat sound anyways.

I feel like I need dedicated servers

I never made another one. :|

I once got five stacks via 3 survivors, and the fourth was the obsession, which I had just downed as I got my fifth. I cackled maniacally as I mori'd them.

No, you didn't. You use them for replacing connectives on a sentence or at the start of a list if you're speaking British English. Yours should have been a standard colon. Either way, it's the end of a title, so there should be no punctuation unless it's a question mark or an exclamation mark. 
---
Are you arguing because you enjoy it.
---
Or are you doing it because you want to win.
---
Most athletes play to win, but decide to play because they enjoy the activity or can do well at it. Athletes that continue on after their peak play because they want to be challenged. Or decide to become a commentator as they still enjoy the game and while not as good as they used to be want to continue their experience with it. The spirit of competition is important, and trouncing an opponent is much less fun than actually being reasonably challenged. Its even less fun when you don't feel like you're doing anything skillful.
---
Phyric Victories exist, and while they include winning most people that have them don't find them fun. 
---
Winning can become boring and if it plays out the exact same every time, it becomes stale. You're enjoyment will slowly decrease if all you do is win. By trying to mix up play in such a way that your opponent is able to provide a reasonable challenge, even if you lose you'll feel more accomplished than your last 20 matches that were pushovers because you abused a game design flaw to win.
---
But of course, there is no winning in this. For either of us. 
---
I'm certain I can't change your mind and you my. 
---
Then why do you even try.

If winning is not an option.

I have come across survivors like that too. Even if I don't play in a toxic way, they have tea bagged.

Plz send help, I can't stand the suspense.

You may be in the wrong subreddit for this. May I suggest this subreddit; https://www.reddit.com/r/GrammarNazi
---
As for the "getting bored of winning", nah not for me. True, it's better to compete at a higher level but it doesn't matter how you win, if you win then that's it. I don't see how anything other than winning can be acceptable. I'm not arguing, I'm just simply stating my opinion and my view of competition. Please remember this started with you replying to me...about gen rushing. In DBD. A game. 1v4 where the 4 want to win, and you had a problem with me wanting to win.
---
If you'd prefer to have fun and lose then that's all well and good, I'm aware those people exist - I just feel bad for them. I'd just prefer to win, no matter who it's against, no matter what level of competition. That's my stance on it, hope you understand.
---
god this subreddit is terrible
---
Fuck, yep. If I know I'm in a lobby with a 3 man SWF, I leave. They aren't going to help you and just treat you like their points pinata. Kind of like twitch streamers, you're not their team mate. You're just there for the entertainment of their loser followers.
---
You get your own dedicated server, hosted directly at your house

But why?

I like how when you were proven wrong you gave up and just went for a weak, provocative jab instead. Nice job :) 
---
Can I also get the exclusive feng min bunny skin?
---
Ignore them!
---
Already ended he disconnected 
---
I become excited because it might be a mori! Seeing them are like dying to a fatality, I rather that than the hook. But if you can't see my offering then chances is it might be a mori. lol
---
This is a short loop, so the survivor would be REACTING to any movements you make, therefore making the loop shorter since YOU are in control and not the survivor.
---
Wish every killer main and survivor main played the other side often. Some of the shit the makes say and do are ridiculous and toxic. They just don't realize it.

[&gt;also me, bringing an Ebony Mori against Survivors with 1 perk](https://i.imgflip.com/2gnnjh.jpg) (to be fair I had a daily and Ebony was the only Mori I had for the Killer 🙃)
---
Tea bagging and being rude in post game chat.
---
50 wasnt in rank one though theres a difference 
---
That would not be a bad idea. Although in my opinion small maps can get chaotic. If the map is built right, I would expect great fun.
---
They do it because they try to get a reaction. After face camping, they'll type 'gg ez' in the post game chat, hoping to receive some rage in response.
---
The best games are the ones where survivors just type 'gg' as well. The sweatlord killer just hangs around for ages not leaving, waiting for salt that never comes. Love knowing these sweaty morons are frustrated that they didn't get the negative reactions they so desperately seek.
---
Oh. Found the noob killer who can't get kills without tunneling. 
---
L E G I O N R E W O R K W H E N !?!
---
Imo it was more like someone trying to redeem on an obviously satire reply.
---
Love? Sure. We players may hate each other in this game, but I’m sure the survivors have bonded enough to care about each other through their trials. I doubt there’s dating in the traditional sense but I’d like to think they all care about each other very much.
---
Eh. Still somewhat dishonest I think. Rank 1 isn't that much different from the purple ranks, and I'm sure he spent a majority of his games in the red ranks.
---
Who is the one behind The Spirit? 
---
The point is to get a reaction. Same as leatherfaces camping and nodding furiously. They want the other player to get mad. Just ignore it and move on.
---
I like to run side by side with the survivor so I could telegraph their every move then slowly close in for the hit.
---
I'm glad you appreciate it. You have good day!
---
Never understood why people derank to learn new killers. You're gonna derank by playing a new killers anyways. Might as well start learning asap 🤷‍♂️
---
“Am I a joke to you?”-  Amanda ‘teabag’ Young
---
Wish granted. The feng min bunny skin is now exclusive to you
---
So true I just got face camped by a fucking Michael
---
I guess the fun is finding out which Mori it is.
---
It's everyone's fault but their own. Those types won't be happy until killers have weapons replaced with feather dusters.
---
It's mainly because I don't want to go up against good Survivors with crappy perks and crappy addons as a Killer I'm crap with. In particular I'm playing a Killer who's very different to what I usually play (won't say who) which is why I *really* don't want to play them at high ranks.
---
Your probably right
---
Eww running Add-ons or offerings as a killer ewwww
---
Just buy what you think you'll use and that will suit you and your playing style. Different people have different styles, so it's going to vary
---
Without correct grammar we'd be back in the Middle Ages, where people wrote differently depending on region or town. Go to another town and be unable to read the street signs or the restaurant menus. What a great world it would be with people who share your attitude in charge. You're just another fool trying to look smart by using the semicolon, with no idea how to use it.
---
Pharmacy doesn’t help you heal faster it helps you search faster
---
at that point id buy a survivor or killer because it's cheaper also because the killers offer dofferent gameplay
---
Monitor and abuse is decent if you play killer 
---
"Infinites don't exist"
---
it gets you a medkit, which makes you heal faster
---
Yes. Do your loadout and bloodweb before joining lobbies.
---
To be fair, Dwight is the unofficial "leader", as implied by his bio and perks. This implies the survivors have enough emotion to make a connection to another. But keep in mind love as in "Romantic" or having a "crush" would be nigh impossible in the Entities dimensions. Each realm is filled with dread. The backwater swamp that is disgusting. The Coldwind farm area that reeks of the sense of being uncomfortable. Keep in mind, none of this even factors the unimaginable terror of the killers. Stress and fear can have nasty effects on ones mindset.
---
*come eat avocado toast with us kate...*

I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE GAME FOR ABOUT HALF A YEAR NOW AND FOR 5 MONTHS OF THOSE SIX I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR BBQ TO COME UP IN THE SHRINE BUT EVERY. SINGLE. WEEK HAS THE SAME BULLSHIT. SHITTY PERKS WITH THE OCCASIONAL SAVING GRACE, (WGLF, SELF CARE, ETC.)  BUT HOLY FUCK JUST GIVE ME BBQ I PROBABLY WON'T EVEN USE IT FOR THE NORMAL PURPOSE I JUST WANT EXTRA BLOODPOINTS FFS. AND NO, I CANT BUY LF BECAUSE IM POOR AS F U C K. GOD DAMN IT WHY DID I SPEND ALL MY MONEY ON LEGION &amp; HIS COSMETICS. I KNOW IM A DAY LATE FOR THIS SHUT UP BUT I NEED TO VENT BECAUSE IM A DUMB IDIOT BUT SO IS THE SHRINE FOR NOT GIVING ME THE GOOD SHIT
---
She's probably trying to depip. Be thankful she's letting you play the match rather than straight up DCing as soon as she loads in.
---
I actually play survivor more than killer, but okay. My suggestion actually favors the survivor, as with it closed killers would no longer want to camp hatch. If it has to be opened like an exit gate, we now have 3-4 places for the survivor to go for an escape, and a killer can only be in one place at a time. If he opts to keep camping hatch, go do gens like normal. If he goes to patrol exit gates, come over and unlock it while he is away. Right now, if the killer gets to hatch first, he would just want to proxy camp; and why not? If the survivor manages to get there while you are away, it's almost an instant escape, but making it work like an exit gate means killers would be better off just searching for the survivor.
---
I doubt she was trying to depip since she finished the round with 18k bloodpoints 
---
This. This is exactly how you gotta do it!
---
eh depends like you dont want to get found but they want to not die too so its kinda like ehhhhhh
---
Needs self-care instead of Adrenaline and it’s A+
---
They mainly say that because children depicted in violence can get your game banned in some countries
---
Cover it with your hand and click 'leave match' as soon as possible. It's what I do, especially if it's a toxic SWF that you know is going to talk trash.
---
Alternatively, take as screenshot of what they said, report them via the in-game system, and then also report them through their Steam profile. Link screenshot in description of both reports. If you do this and provide proof they will get banned for saying something as simple as 'kys'.
---
I got most of the chapters a while back when they were on sale. Im missing spirit and Freddy 
---
[Got told by a Laurie using Defensive Strike at Rank 1 that BBQ, Ruin (and Whispers) were crutch perks.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/174410322050809857/545071183276670986/lolkay.jpg) She didn't have this exact build (no Adred and Lithe instead of Dead Hard) but she played like a potato and only ended the game with top Bloodpoints because she had one of the event offerings during the LNY.
---
I mean her username is the usual "Hex: Unfunny Meme" username and she could barely loop for 2 seconds. But nah fam I only won because I had the insanely OP top tier perk Whispers. 🤷
---
Imagine not wanting Huntress to be your mommy gf lole
---
PROBABLY NOT THE ONLY THING YOU CAN'T DO
---
Oh wow, we never had a thread discussing this topic before.
---
could get spirit she is pretty fun and spirit fury is amazing with enduring
---
Speaking of the balance team, how about they overhaul legion and complete rework him?
---
If I know I've done enough things to pip, I don't care what the killer does to me. You can say '4k means survivors lost' all you want, but everyone will interpret lose and win in a different way.
---
I'm glad they timed the event to be over just before the ranked reset.  Let's all the idiots who think Rank matters filter out and then complain about how bad the queues are.  
---
Shirtless Kate &gt; Rin’s ass
---
See I would understand not fully reading something if it looked like an AP Persuasive Essay but I wrote a quote and a brief paragraph so you have no excuse for not reading. 
---
At the bottom of the paragraph it literally says I understand that you can’t prevent someone from unhooking you and it’s not on you for that but the game should not be made easier so that people can make reckless choices without consequences. 
---
Also for Christ’s sake don’t call me a killer main because I think that people should learn how to make safe unhooks. It’s counter productive and if I were on a different thread saying that gens don’t go too fast killers just need to learn how to pressure then I’d have someone else telling me I’m a survivor main. I’ve been the farmed, the farmer, and the rehooker so I know it’s annoying for the guy getting farmed, but it should be on the players to realize that they need to improve rather than the devs removing any logical thinking from a critical aspect of the game.
---
It was a commercial aimed at men, what women do is utterly irrelevant. It's the same as the bajillion female empowerment "we can do better" ads that exclude men from the discussion.
---
YOU GO MY GUY!!
---
Gilette did a highly "progressive" commercial called "The Best Men Can Be" basically focusing on "toxic masculinity" and how all men should be better.  Basically made all men look like sex-obsessed misogynist pigs and was basically a call to action for men to not be sexists and so on, showing many negative stereotypes etc.  in an advertisement aimed at selling male shaving products.  
---
Idk but I’m returning to this game after a while, and he scares the shit out of me, that and I can’t loop him
---
Not much counterplay, discourages teamwork,some of his add-ons (Frank’s mixtape lmfao) are straight up too op and usually people who play him are toxic and will facecamp you if they feel like it,then say slurs in the chat after
---
You x The fiery pits of hell
---
there's no counter play. hes not necessarily Op (he is with add-ons) but hes not fun to play against.
---
Monitor and abuse if you like playing stealthy
---
Others I’d say no lmao
---
I do think Ruin is a crutch but not moreso than something like Self-Care or D-Strike. That’s why I never play any of them. I’ve found that Self-Care is actually really not good in the Mangled/Sloppy Butcher meta. Idk how people at rank 1 still play it.
---
Why are you downvoted? Lol I've been farmed and left to die by 3 man swf so many times, and plenty of times they team up with the killer to do it.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Not going to lie, you may see some things that'll scar you.
---
NSFW btw.
---
You wont learn by picking on new players and you ruin the experience for the survivors who waste time and offerings just for you to disconnect.
---
Just play the killer with less perks. You can make rank 1 with any killer without any items or perks.
---
I only see it used on Myers and Legion, otherwise I personally dont think it's worth a slot
---
Funny, if it was my preference to lose and have fun. I won. 
---
But if my preference was to win while having fun, I halfway won.
---
And if your preference was to win, you lost.
---
But if your preference was to have fun while winning your halfway won.
---
My issue was much less, you enjoy winning but rather you feel using the dominate strategy in a game to exclusively win to mean that you're skilled. 
---
Also, yes. It is a game. All of it. 
---
At the end of the day. I feel I halfway won.
---
Fancy boi wraith is in town
---
Wraith is hot af!
---
I loved it when I mori'd all 4 as Wraith and they all started yelling at each other at the end because nobody could find it. It was literally right next to someone I hooked early on (was on the opposite side of a rock next to the hook) and panicked thinking I fucked up. I just sat there in silence while they fought. 
---
Evidently not how people interpreted it based on our comment scores. Maybe explain yourself a little better next time? 
---
Bet the killer was a p3 Nurse
---
The spirit is a 10, let’s be real. Killer bod, complex as hell, sex hair whipping every which way. Spirit was robbed. 
---
maybe they thought you would actually try and save them rather than y'know, giving the killer the win so you could get your precious escape. 
---
I think you need 9000 shards to buy Spirit. You can't buy Freddy (or other licensed killers/survivors) with shards, only auric cells or DLC packages.
---
Oh, you found mine? I wondered why an address appeared in my mind...
---
Yeah I’m trash, garbage who can’t get kills without playing like an actual killer, I have to be nice to survivors, I forgot
---
Seems op if a survivor gets trapped. Make the survivor invulnerable when they are playing the game and when they free themselves either they get injured from the game or not they are invulnerable for 3 seconds. that way its a double edge sword were the killer has a choice to watch the survivor play or go hunt someone else.
---
They'd need a lot of therapy lol
---
It literally never gets old. You’re always guaranteed 1-3 kills a match. It’s insane.
---
At first I hated Legion cos they were simple but now for some reason I like being Legion 
---
Even though I never win as that killer .\_.
---
You should put NOED on and creep around the corner quick when they're teabagging at the gates! Sometimes you might just get one of those little shits and it feels good lol
---
I'm fairly certain she's never shown or mentioned to still be a heroin addict, in the first one when questioned by Tapp on her addiction she says "he helped me", in saw 6 John presents her to his ex-wife (a drug clinic doctor) as someone he's cured. 
---
Though really she moved on to being addicted to self-harm and hating her life even more. Poor lady, pretty sympathetic, for a crazed, remorseless murderer.
---
As someone who switches killers after every game, this is god tier. Thanks!
---
What about the original 80s film?
---
The only thing good about him is his P3 skin. They made him extra bloody.
---
I feel like that kind of map would be terrible for huntress though
---
No it wasn’t politics mods just don’t have a sense of humor
---
I see your point as by the time I realized on first hook that he wasn’t leaving, I didn’t understand why everyone kept trying to unhook me anyways 
---
More so than you, clearly 
---
I think they called it a butterfly knife because of the design on the blade, but yea. 
---
Honestly the more absurd thing is two slashes with a pocket knife can down a grown man lol. 
---
Then *why* are you defending yourself in a conversation that's not attacking you?
---
Also hours don't equate skill. Not questioning yours, just pointing out facts. 
---
I got hit by a train
---
language is diverse in the fact that you still grasped what he meant. you’re literally making a mountain out of molehill all to make yourself feel more educated. you’re not offering anything valid to the topic of the post so just knock your shit off. people thought it was annoying then and it’s still annoying to this day. people make typos big fucking deal man 
---
PREACH
---
Yes lol how can you tell damn?
---
it sure makes you fun at parties tho doesn’t it? get a grip 
---
i’m not even gonna bother explaining. 
---
Looks great, but spirits face is just a tad bit pudgy 
---
Yeah I didn't think you knew either.
---
I think they’re already dead but probably just go back to their normal lives with some fucked up memories, bar maybe bill whose already been through way more fucked up shit and Claudette because if the immersed Claud’s I get in my games are any indication her brain don’t work too well
---
the extra points would be nice! since they barely give up any
---
Thanks man &lt;3
---
She probably has 20/20 vison 
---
He’s annoying af. His power is basically press m2 for free hits 
---
Screw the pink perks people want these look AMAZING!
---
That makes sense, but I feel it has to do with devs laziness in the first place, or they just don't wanna rework a character that soon after he was released.
---
Any survivor with a brain won’t let you down them where they won’t fall to safety 
---
I kinda like DH a bit more because it's not necessarily an end game kind of thing but yes it's true
---
ty
---
He did it without sprint burst or adrenaline 😉
---
Because people think it’s funny. I tbag other survivors all the time it just looks goofy and if they tbag you at exit gates it’s them saying haha I escaped 
---
Please. Please this. 
---
Well that's debatable because I've gotten quite a few with it
---
I love this, Dwight and David make a cute couple 
---
Gonna take this opportunity to complain we havent gotten a licensed killer since Amanda, I know there was licensed character fatigue at the time and then there was the self publishing change, but now I'm kinda missing licensed killers. Ideally one day the court case shakes out and dbd gets to add Jason, but MBV would be dope too
---
That’s too true
---
Doesn't help they're getting five fokin directions at once from backseat gamers.
---
Though this is also why I use headphones for this game.
---
Doc can be really annoying just because of his power and his face popping up over and over. He’s not aids like Freddy and legion but it gets old after a few games 
---
My man I wish I could have saved you instead of Lori 
---
There’s bans on console now?
---
Fair enough. I didn't really pay attention to the ranks, but still disingenuous. That's all I have to say.
---
ruin is literally a crutch, and noed is easily avoidable. do we play the same game or are you just a rank 15 player?
---
ruin is literally needed for killers to have the time to kill anyone, noed takes less than a minute total to stop it from ever activating and gives points. not to mention all the terrified lil survs that just crouch walk until they are last alive and can hatch escape.
---
it is like surv mains have no clue that they have every opportunity to win a game easy, and their own ignorance, toxicity, and shit gameplay is the only reason they will ever get seen, let alone die.
---
That's too claustrophobic imo. I'd love something similar but without the low ceilings, like a Victorian London map with dark alleys.
---
Chattywindow's posts???
---
Check samination, those parodies are awesome
---
Survivors can already be blinded by firecrackers so it'd already be a working mechanic
---
Well atleast the entity will help you out and carry you away into the sky because you're having a bad game
---
YOU MAKE ME WANT TO STALK YOU
---
I don’t draw :(
---
[Source](https://twitter.com/vghu780/status/1095558327130451968) for the lazy
---
Lol nah man I play rank 1 killer and survivor every month.  You calling ruin a crutch is entitlement at it's best.  First off it only affects potatoes.  Skill checks aren't hard.  And it gets taken out early most games anyway.  NoED on the other hand is a no skill insta down killers unlock by shitting the bed and giving up all the objectives.  It's ran by wealthy killers who don't know how to efficiently end chases to crutch out last second kills.  And only swf takes out 4 totems.  Good luck avoiding noed proccing in a game with randos.
---
It's a good feeling when the killer is coming to you, and whoever gets healed takes the hit for the other. But I think even more satisfying is when the other player get healed and he screws you, then later in the game you ignore him when he's on the hook XD.
---
Which means they don’t have the brain power to stand at the actual exit 
---
Nice try Ballas
---
Also I'd like it if this gives me a reason to change my username to Hex: Devour Ochido. People in my lobbies seemed to really like that one.
---
Why do you breathe
---
Still funny though 
---
Can you believe we all said Jeff was ugly when he came out? The cutest bear 
---
shy and pure softies
---
OP ya forgot to cite the artist.
---
Anyways [here's](https://twitter.com/vghu780/status/1096005092191363072) the source. There's a lot more Amanda x Rin in there.
---
PERIODT. 
---
Yea, the weapons in this game are weird. Susie has a piece of wood and clown has a knife that’s about the size of the one I got when I was like 10 for fishing. Entity magic cop out aside David and Jeff look like they could floor a lot of the killers in the game. 
---
&gt; Tunneling is generally defined as one survivor being targeted throughout the game until they’re sacrificed. Is that NOT a thing?
---
The Killer's objective is to kill as many survivors permanently asap. Tunneling is just the killer optimizing their game to eleminate someone as fast as they possibly can. If you're ok with the term tunneling you have to be ok with killers using the term genrush because they both mean the same thing. 
---
Anyone who teabags at the exit has no brain power
---
I was told that Borrowed time is more of a crutch than NOED so I have no right to say NOED is scummy by a toxic survivor tho
---
Damn I just did this a little while ago not because I died but because it perfectly coincided with me wanting to turn the game off anyway. I literally thought, damn someone's gonna think I was being a bitch lol. There wasn't actually a correlation to dying.
---
Is it bad that I’m a p3 Laurie running Selfcare, WGLF, We’ll Make It, and Lithe, and still get called toxic by the killer in the end game chat?
---
Whatever you say chief 
---
What annoys me is that most survivors that disconnect seem to do it as a middle finger to the killer. But it actually only gives the killer a boost and punishes the rest of the survivors.
---
Which one is better to watch?
---
It’s pretty nice to put on if you see a whole group going in with an item of some sort
---
Some good advice about hillbilly~ if you’re right up on backs then when charging up your chainsaw, it helps to look down just a little bit so that you have a good view of the survivor as the chainsaw is revving. Your camera will adjust and you will dash forwards as soon as the charge is full so as long as you try to keep them in the center of your screen you will get that sweet sweet instadown! Good luck out there man!
---
Thank you man! I really appreciate all these comments!
---
Just FYI I think you're using a definition of crutch that nobody else uses.
---
I saw a lot of killers doing that. Smart but evil 
---
Borrowed times only really annoying when the user unhooks the survivor three seconds after the killer had hooked them. Other than that, it's only really effective at punish camping so I don't hate it that much. There are alot bigger crutches than borrowed time. 
---
I do wish Whispers worked like small game in that it pinged every 10 seconds or something, I don't think dead hard is a toxic perk either because it requires at least some sort of a brain/mind games to get effective use out of it. 
---
The amount of survivors I see use DS to good measure is in the single digits percentage wise, most use it only to be downed seconds later. 
---
There are better perks than overcharge, like surveillance and pop goes the weasel, for Gen control. Especially surveillance, you should give it a try! Iron grasp is not that useful, and i would say that the majority agree that agitation is superior (Virgin IG vs Chad Agi) and NOED doesn't work with frenzy, but you said for the memes, so...
---
Not a bad build overall, but there are better builds. 
---
Yeah nice catch there buddy. But at the end of the day, having Harry Warden as a killer in the game is just plain stupid because instead of having to go through the trouble of getting permission to use him, they could literally just make their own miner killer and on the plus side, actually be able to release cosmetics for him. 
---
So this idea is just bad no matter which way you look at it. My bloody isn’t even that popular of a movie, compared to all the other movie DLC’s released; out of all them it made the least money at the box office. 
---
My theory is dbd chat is some other evil being that lost its job to the Entity and has literally nothing left it can do other than neg on everything that can hear it in the mists
---
I’ve become so altruistic I will sacrifice myself every time for the unhook. Stand at he hook until the killer hits me and by the time the survivor is unhooked I’m on the ground and he’s sprint bursting away. Most of the time I get face camped lmao
---
Amazing. Try this build:
---
Dance with me
---
Lithe
---
Quick and quiet
---
Lightweight
---
Seriously, try it. It's amazing 
---
I usually just walk back instead of forward when I swing if they're 360ing. Its not a 100% perfect counter but it works most of the time. I also play in 80% sensitivity as killer, but thats my preference.
---
As for performing the 360. I suck at it so I have nothing that would be of use.
---
You are not the only one, this bothers me too. But, i hope in the future they add a real butterfly knife. I even had ideas like a swiss army knife or a toothpick with a razor, completing the prisioner set, wich looks like the typical prisioner from old school cartoons. 
---
I mean sure borrowed is a crutch because it's so useful against campers but then again it's against campers. Also there's perks like Dstrike 
---
Freddy can already wake people up of his own accord by hooking people (which is dumb because the game effectively forces him to shoot himself in his own foot by doing what it demands him to do). He can also force the second to happen again by giving up the chase and allowing survivors to wake up before going after them again, but again, that forces him to shoot himself in his own foot and waste even more time to get the same effect.
---
DWM + Lithe + Q&amp;Q + lightweight = Houdini 
---
This movie was so bad 
---
Who knows? Maybe the Entity does kill them. Maybe they died from something else. People die by accident all the time.
---
Just about to post it lol
---
Huh. never knew that.
---
Wait is dead hard a stupid perk? It's been incredibly useful to me but do killers hate it? I try to avoid hated perks like the plague and in my year and a half of playing I have never once equipped DS, but do I need to add DH to the list?
---
Balanced Landing is the strongest of the four js.
---
Ya know, your comment really changed my perspective on, “toxic,” players. 
---
I’ve honestly never looked at it like this.  
---
Do you mean not racist people?
---
No, it isn't. This is a known issue that's been going on for like a month. They even stated in the recent patch that they still didn't know what the problem is and are "Monitoring" it.
---
I mean honestly,most of the backstories are of them getting lost somehow and taken by the entity. I think according to the lore,if they lose all hope,they become lifeless and turn into a killer
---
Good shit. Link?
---
Meg for Adrenaline, Jake for Iron Will, David for Dead Hard and We're Gonna Live Forever (gives lots of extra BP, but does nothing else), Nea for Urban Evasion and Balanced Landing, Feng for Lithe. Those are the most "meta" perks I would say.
---
True but It would not be hard to hide his in game identity on stream, so...
---
Just do this moonwalk to the exit gates that way they dont get the satisfacton and puss out and leave.
---
original is better than the remake
---
there is one good scene in the entire remake and that is the grocery store chase. the rest of the movie isnt as good as that one scene and that scene isnt as good as the original movie
---
How do you exist in 2 seperate times within the realm? Like one form of you is in the entity's realm and another is in real life. Or are you like a glitch in the matrix and just teleport from each one?
---
Dead Hard, 
---
I didn’t realize how much I needed it until I started playing David.
---
Can confirm, we will be paying a visit to those who voted for the Legion.
---
It makes me feel so much better that the teams getting their funding from the same coffers occupy different sections of the same office. Thanks for clarifying for me brain genius. Your wisdom is legendary.
---
Oh my god this is too wholesome.
---
He can't wake them up voluntarily mid-chase.
---
He either needs to have already won the chase or have them wake themselves up.
---
I'm not talking about that. I'm saying he should be able to put somebody to sleep, go for a mindgame, then wake them up and try again, since that period during the dream transition is the closest thing to a "chasing tool" Freddy has going for him.
---
It’s my favourite perk in the game hands down so I ain’t disagreeing. 
---
Some people will defend anything i guess
---
What system? PC, Xbox, PS4?
---
You have to be where the prompt is on the killers screen plus there could be latency where the killer is able to press the hook button on their screen while you are body blocking on your screen
---
I’ll replace Lithe with Balanced if I’m using a map offering with drops. Other than that, Lithe is the move. There’s always windows.
---
I’m sure there are better ways of dealing with it but that’s what I always do and I do just fine with it. As for actually doing 360’s, I’d recommend you go into a kyf and just repeatedly try it until you get it right. Most players 360 slightly differently than others so listening to other people isn’t necessarily the best way to learn. 
---
If you camp and tunnel, I will quit the game. Or else I won't. Simple. 
---
I don't think my issue could be related to my PSU, it's very clearly the game client not making it to the game and freezing in between, and it's independent of any other programs running or drawing power.
---
Looks cool. But you need to learn how balance works.
---
Im just here to say Dead Hard is best perk, most clutch its like having sprint burst when u really need it
---
It's so sad when you have a "Mori someone with X Killer" and the only thing you have is a Cypress Mori, you offer it, play your match normally and the last guy either DC's or the 2nd to last guy Dc's and the last guy finds the hatch instantly.
---
I'm surprised but not at this point in my life
---
BBQ isn't really a crutch, it's just a way to maximize bloodpoints.  Not to mention good Survivors are able to tell when a Killer is using BBQ and usually act accordingly (running in one direction then running in the other; alternatively now hiding in lockers apparently works too).  Typically only immersed Survivors or newbies get thrown off by BBQ&amp;C.  
---
Ruin also isn't a crutch.  It can usually get cleansed within a minute or two, and there are ways to play around it as well.  It's just another perk that throws newbies off and _maybe_ gets some folks off gens to find/destroy it.  Not to mention it only really works well when you have other hex perks (Hallowed Ground, Thrill of the Hunt) that can help counter folks attempting to break Ruin.
---
Only real crutch perks for Killer are the ones that help save them at the endgame, which are basically just NOED and then maybe Remember Me/Blood Warden.  Even then it might only get you one kill you wouldn't have otherwise gotten, but NOED does regularly save bad games for Killers because of Survivors being too altruistic.  
---
BL is just such a godsend in so many maps that I can’t not run it. Of course there is the chance of getting one of the two bad maps but I’ll take my chances.
---
I also never don’t run BL. If I’m going to a map like lerys I run lithe and BL lmfao.
---
The Game + BL = GG
---
Why do you bother censoring their names? Let the world know who they are. Fuck 'em. If some reddit psycho hunts them down and murder them it's not your fault it's the killers for being a sperg.
---
I've had folks call me a hacker because I knew their location with BBQ and Chili... and it was because all they'd do is crouch in place after I hooked someone and never moved when I came close to them.  Which, y'know, makes it easy for a Leatherface to then chainsaw them down.
---
I play both equally. I am just not biased like most of you people here. I know the problems that each side faces. Take a noob killer vs a noob survivor. That noob killer will come out on top always. Take a highly skilled killer and a highly skilled survivor and the survivor will come out on top. But the amount of quality stuff that a survivor needs to implement is surely more than that the killer has to. 
---
Honestly wouldn't say Adrenaline is that much of a crutch.  It is most powerful in SWF when you can time it, but otherwise Adrenaline is a gamble perk that only becomes useful at one single instance _if_ your team gets far enough to where the generators are all powered up.  
---
It's like for every time Adrenaline produces a clutch save, there's several more instances where it provides a speed boost at best or is a wasted perk slot because you don't make it to the point where it gets activated.  
---
And even in the scenario of the DS combo, that requires a lot of factors such as not using DS before that point.  Adrenaline is certainly useful when it works and provides those awesome saves at times, but it's not _so_ good that it could be considered must-have or a crutch.   Especially since you'll still want to take another Exhaustion perk with it for every situation before the 5th gen pops.
---
This image looks really, uh, I dunno what to call it, compressed? I’m fairly certain it doesn’t look like this, look how blurry the text is
---
david
---
That's specifically the reason I don't bother with those 
---
Struck a nerve I see
---
I've had a lot of them over the past few days, before and after rank reset. Maybe one out of every 3 games I've had at least one survivor disconnect because they went down or they missed a decisive strike. Just play the game and get your bloodpoints
---
The thing is it depends on their actuall priorities. Sure, meanwhile they've a good amount of employees, but as there's still lots of stuff to do besides of rebalancing already existing Killers...Like, we're about to get servers this summer, the next chapter is most likely also already in work and discussion, people are still complaining about performance issues (especially on console) and they actually might even work on other stuff we don't know about yet (maybe 2v8 mode with the servers launching or whatsoever, just as an example).
---
When it comes up to Blizzard and Bethesda I'd actually expect them to be lazy, they've fucked up too hard with Immortal and 76 (and thus don't seem to care about their communities)...But BHVR on the other hand still has my respect. They're actually listening to us in most cases, don't attempt to rip us our cash with cheap tactics, and actually also give us as a community the feeling that we are the priority instead of 'emselfes.
---
So yeah, I think quite positively about BHVR in that regard.
---
I have been doing adept achievement lately and I got clown, hag, and huntress done only one of which I had ruin for oof
---
When I first started out, I didn't know you could lunge if held. I thought I was a trash tier killer and became a survivor main lol.
---
Then you don't pick them up enough. I'd usually have around 4 or 5 once I get to level 50 only because there are very little amounts in the lower bloodwebs but once you start going beyond 50 they're everywhere
---
That would have been so much better
---
you need to crouch a bit in front of it, not at the angle. 
---
I second my bae. 
---
Idk what to tell you, they never show up in my bloodwebs at all
---
Tunneling is the same as gen rushing. Its rushing through the objective if you cant understand that then you should probably sit down and think about it long and hard
---
You're a real post.
---
He's way too strong with the right perks and addons. There's no direct counter to him and if they're smart and running sloppy butcher or an equivalent perk you have to heal through two health states, the first one you have no choice or you're downed, the second one youll be mangled for, you spend a lot of the game either injured or healing in which case you've lost for time and oh god here he comes around a corner and i'm on my last hook.
---
r/dontdeadopeninside
---
i mean u came in swinging at me first and now youre playing victim andy...? kinda wierd man. u should be able to take what u give
---
That bee buzz sound for terror radius/chase tho.
---
If they're going to speak nonsense, just turn it around on them. "I wouldn't camp my totems if you weren't so busy camping yours." Logic will never win with those types, so you might as well make them think they're on acid. 
---
quite definitely. I will look in. as I said before, I am changing the perks if it is bad sounding as it is. I haven't played the game in a short while, I only came back after some new things were added.
---
Right? Because no matter what side we are on the other side will always be mad
---
And you know what? I think we appreciate that. 
---
...you can cut things out in paint?
---
Okay, if this sounds too broken, Ill try to make it a bit satisfying where it counts (AKA rebuilding and nerfing). until then, View it as a meme :)
---
i’m literally. so annoyed about it 
---
This is very true!
---
I would like to also suggest using a site like logicalincrements!
---
It basically provides an excel spreadsheet of computer part builds, organised in order of smallest budget to highest. 
---
I used it all the time when I was learning about PC building, and the list ensures that things stay compatible.
---
Nobody. Will. Take. From. My. C H E S T .
---
I already made a post about legion, but here I'll summarize it; fix moonwalking but give legion more compatibility with perks like nurses calling on mending(shouldn't be 28 meters though) bamboozle on pallets and token perks like remember me and save the best for last.
---
Frank's mixtape is annoying but personally I don't think it should be removed. Franks mixtape is just like any other super strong killer add on. However, they should increase its rarety to red and decrease fuming mix tapes rarity to purple
---
1080p 
---
I wouldn't exactly call a global UAV drone "balanced" but I definetly think the perk on its own is fine. There's nothing overly wrong about it as it just speeds up the search for new Survivors.
---
I’ll have to look into it thank you
---
Maybe they could put the guy that was haunting the chucky doll, Charles Lee Ray
---
I honestly have no idea, I assume that since the Entity is an eldritch abomination, it basically says "fuck you" to conventional space-time within its domain
---
Ah I see you are also a hero
---
It's a rough time. When I play Killer after a fresh reset it's like one match is a complete stomp with minimal effort on my part and the next one has three gens popping at once while one guy hits me with perfect loops. Difficulty whiplash. 
---
Ah well no dice you’re the power role (it’s a 1v4 anyways) and will eventually catch up to them even if it takes 2 minutes and blood lust 3, but in the process you will throw the match if you are not careful. 
---
Saying that killer doesn’t take skill to play because you will eventually catch a guy even if every single generator gets done in the process is a horrid argument (no offense) because you’re still losing hard that game and it’s quite likely that the remaining three will find a way to get him out as well.
---
Kate is thick af but her perks have down syndrome. I like David king for his backstory (shirtless skin) and I like meg for sprint burst and adrenaline
---
I mean there are some funny ones, but the usual "Hex: (synonym for devour) (synonym for ass)", "Hex: DC", "Hex: Genrush", "Hex: Decisive Strike" get old really fast. I forget which version this Laurie had but it was some sort of generic store-bought brand meme.
---
It was just me 😂
---
I list Sprint Burst as the obnoxious Exhaustion perk and people tell me Balanced Landing is OP.
---
I list Balanced Landing as the obnoxious Exhaustion perk and people tell me Dead Hard is OP.
---
I list Dead Hard as the obnoxious Exhaustion perk and people tell me Sprint Burst is OP.
---
The one thing that remains consistent is that people think Lithe is trash.
---
You could play Ace to get AITH to go with plunderers. The new update makes ultra rare items almost extremely common with plunderers, along with ace in the hole, it'll make you cream
---
I just now noticed that the Hag wears a beanie 
---
i had a game earlier where a david messaged me about hot bad i was for using noed and the tombstone piece on the shape. He had self care, d strike and dead hard. This was after I gave him hatch. some people man
---
Laurie life
---
Had a few games as Piggy with Iron Grasp, Agitation and Mad Grit against a few SWF teams.. so funny downing survivors while carrying one to the basement. Basement party!!!  Oink!!!
---
monitor and abuse is very good for most of the killers
---
Great first date, I hear he mixes one hell of a cocktail.
---
Oh, it's definitely looped alright.
---
Only the biggest of brains run multiple Exhaustion perks.
---
I'm aware, but the description of it was just a bit more brutal than I remember the film's depiction. Then again, it's been forever since I've watched it.
---
Idea for his mori: Sticks the pickaxe in the person’s chest, pries it open, and pokes the heart with the pick and pulls it out. I “Heart” you.
---
Couls you blame him for using a viable strategy?
---
That too! I really didn't give her enough credit.
---
Totally agree with you mate. I love huntress lullaby and enjoy using it soo much especially on doctor alongside distressing unnerving presence and overcharge. The problem with huntress lullaby is that it gets outclassed by devour hope and I mean, it's a hex perk. Combined with the shitty totem spots, it'll get destroyed easily.
---
Actually, I personally think it should not even tell survivors that you have it after they work on a generator. That'll help it not get destroyed immediately and it's pretty easy to tell if a killer has it because you'll find that the noise is delayed. 
---
yeems
---
Why do you need unrelenting? 
---
If you hit them with frenzy and the next hit is just a regular hit... there’s no point in using the cool down reduction when they are already on the ground. 
---
Iron grasp is not necessary unless you want a basement control build
---
I’m uncertain about NOED seeing as it doesn’t work with his frenzy power (last I checked). So unless you’re camping with NOED active I doubt it’ll be useful. You’ll probably have to frenzy up to someone. Go through frenzy stun, and then chase them and hit them to get them down... you’re basically playing regular... plus legion’s base speed is meh.
---
I know you just got legion but I’d suggest creating a build that’s centered around ending the game before the last gen is completed. 
---
Maybe ruin, monitor and abuse, discordance and bbq? 
---
Spies from the shadows is a good perk now too
---
"They're more like guidelines than actual rules"
---
I had a quick look online, at 1080p people are getting locked 60 frames at medium settings with a GTX 1050ti or equivalent. 
---
I'm terms of the site I mentioned, here's a link too, hopefully it helps!
---
https://www.logicalincrements.com
---
Do you want me to create the budget or you and lastly do you want it to just be strong enough to run dead by daylight at 60 fps or are you going to run more graphic/ram intensive games?
---
I... think it's just you..
---
Were you playing nurse?
---
Dang, that stinks. There is a dbd discord server if you play on pc. Always people online there.
---
Now that would be epic.
---
I might would try to run something like rainbow or pubg
---
Server's in summer, Switch in fall
---
Too bad she a sticc in game
---
So I was running survivor pudding and another guy ran bloody point streamers. I also had bbq and chili tier 1 (I can’t fucking see it in my bloodweb no matter how much I level up). Also the guy who used BPS disconnected
---
That would be epic.
---
I only gave this about 15 seconds of thought, so my bad if there's an obvious flaw, but why not give survivors a 5 second immunity window when getting off the hook (except when all gens are done)? You can still "camp," but instead of "tunneling" you can go after the person who saved (obviously you can still tunnel but at least they won't get smacked right off of hook which is really annoying)
---
Then it's not suited for your playstyle, but it's not a situational perk
---
top tier mindgames indeed
---
Yeah. I get your point. I guess you make a good one. It's harder for a killer for sure. Not doubts about that. 
---
On xbox, it's a known buggy achievement. Just keep at it, eventually you'll get it
---
How is it not situational?
---
But I need my worn out tools
---
(He also had voice chat and swf that dc so he could get the hatch)
---
you make a compelling case but i just can’t allow that
---
Tips for nurse? Been trying to get her and almost did but these people would not give up the hatch
---
True, but to me it's more about all players having the same amount of lag, not one having an advantage. Or at least have host be selected at random and have a host migration if it's a survivor and they leave 
---
you're getting downvoted for speaking the truth
---
He did 50 escapes...With the scales tipped heavily in his favor.
---
Agree. From a killer PoV Adrenaline is annoying but highly situational. It's also somewhat wasted against insta-down killers like Billy and Myers.
---
DS is a really badly implemented perk. Guaranteed extra chase/hit required in a game where time is critical. I'd happily see it balanced - maybe a longer stun time but more drawback like survivor remains broken for the rest of the match.
---
Optimization should be next month.
---
Wraith = predator.. but they did the chainsaw boys so who knows
---
Sure can do I will send this to one of my friends he's build over 15 computers for varying prices so and creates price lists for fun so I'm sure he can help you I will try to to get back to you in a couple days
---
Literally 3 people at once: to the right, no turn around, behind you, oh my gOD TURN AROUND, GO RIGHT!
---
Me, if I were among them: Alright, one person talks, everone else shut up!
---
Thank you
---
Is this the "proof incoming"? You logging onto your alt account and commenting in support of yourself? lmao
---
Today I started a match and this game named DC-ing= winning dc ed, so I farmed with the others and had a race. I killed Dwight cause he cheated in the race, he left to early.
---
possibly.
---
Borrowed time is the perk, the immunity already happens if you dont touch anything and wait for the killer to swing. 
---
No problem I will let you know how it goes
---
I wouldn’t say dead hard is the best perk.
---
It takes away their BBQ stack
---
It's not like this is a trophy hunting page. OP wanted to upload something he thinks is cool, nothing wrong with it. If your that into the game one would think you play a lot and, logically, that you enjoy the game. Why would you not want others to enjoy what you enjoy as well?
---
That’s not a terrible build at all, it’s simply not meta. 
---
As I said, I don't really expect them to add these things, its just fun.
---
Lol you watch James too?
---
ofc.
---
For Judith’s and Tuft of Hair? Yes, it’s a terrible fucking build.
---
Does that mean there no chance that we'll ever see Alma Wade added?
---
Because in order to activate it you need to be injured, so minus a couple of killers they need to hit you first meaning you have time to get near a pallet or window to make a play 
---
“Dwight’s Demise”
---
What killer is that
---
The clown is thicc😩💦💦
---
Could have been going for the trophy
---
So your excuse to use NOED is meme lol funny
---
This isn't Michael lol, it's the pig
---
Or they could just age her up.
---
Are you actually serious? Any time i try to use logic on this sub without bullying one side i get downvoted. 
---
Lol what do you mean? Tyler is 6'5, noob.
---
nea
---
meg and dwight. 
---
Well all i know is me and my brother ran that pig around all game she hooked me once early we fixed all the gens she caught my brother finally used her trap then caught him and moried him on the way out the door
---
If your main viewpoint on the supporters of the opposing argument is that they’re below you or that they’re simply poor players, then you’ve been doomed from the start at having a chance to adhere to reason.
---
They have a point about the whole genrushing vs tunneling thing, yet you seem to be writing it off as people unhappy and unwilling to take responsibility for losses they never mentioned. Being able to actually consider the opponents viewpoint as yours is a skill not many possess, and I don’t expect everyone to, but it’s a shame to see you go the other way and attack those who disagree with you.
---
Legion holds the karambit wrong! WORST KILLER EVER! &gt;:( 
---
By all the precious SWF babies no doubt.
---
(Mobile sorry) as killer (shape) I was told that of my 4 perks BBQ, spirit Fury, enduring and bamboozle. BBQ was a cruch I was so confused because I thought I was gonna get salt for having fragrant tuft of hair but no BBQ op whatever dude. I have played against him 4 other times and he's always telling me to get gud without BBQ and I don't understand how you can possibly enjoy only playing swf because of course he'd be in a full squad too. I'm at rank one and so was his whole squad and I don't understand how they can be that dumb 
---
I wasnt the one saying it's not a small feat to accomplish 0.0 I'm actually impressed that people have managed to platinum the game at all on ps4
---
This sub is filled with people who are ignorant to issues on whichever side they play less. I’m sure I’m no exception to this but I at least try to understand what both sides go through. 
---
Apparently one of the BHVR team is using it as an emote in the DbD Discord. How far my doodles have come...
---
That isn’t Michael, I’d suggest you try a little less of whatever you took next time. 
---
They really need to bring cross play into the mix. Dedicated servers are long overdue. Those two combined can help so much with wait times.
---
Nice job you downed all 4!
---
I mean it's hard to get objective points and stuff when your the one running the killer around I personally never worry about points that much as long as I get the pip and did my part
---
Doctor 
---
Probably Billy with ruin, bbq, iron maiden, bamboozle
---
I do to, in fact, as a survivor main, i got so tired of the camping, slugging, tunneling, and general toxicity. I decided i wanted to see how hard it was to get to rank 1 killer with my own rules. No lobby dodges, no one-hit perks, no tunneling, no camping, no hatch standoffs. etc. anything and everything i hated, only on freddy. I thought you had to be a heartless, cheap, turbo tryhard to get to rank 1, but it was mostly painless. Now it annoys me even more playing survivor cuz i see killers going overboard with the complaints, face camping while using the top tier killers with top tier perks and add ons, and so on.
---
I was going to defend the guy but then I saw his other comments. Yeah, agreed, he’s an unbearable cunt 
---
So I know a LOT of people aren't exactly happy about this, and I'm not trying to be a BHVR apologist, but this is why I'm so happy and excited about this:
---
1. I ride a bus for 30-40 minutes a day, each way, for work. With my unlimited hotspot plan I can actually play DBD on the go.
---
2. I really really really REALLY love the joycons. They aren't the best for everyone but they are so comfortable in my hands.....I just love playing with them!
---
3. As a PS4 player I'm not happy with performance and the launch trailer didn't give me high hopes, but it's so hard to aim for Huntress on PS4 and I hope they use motion controls with the joycons.
---
4. It's not just a bus ride. There's lunch at work, when I'm waiting in line for a movie screening, just other times when I'm bored for a long time without my PS4 and I am ADDICTED to this game.
---
If Sony made a Vita with actual L2/R2 buttons, as well as the ability to put a SIM chip in for LTE, I wouldn't even care about the Switch release and just rely on remote play. But right now I'm so excited for how much fun my days are gonna be going forward!
---
Simple solution: Put Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, and Dead Hard all in the same perk loadout. That's the true big brain survivor strategy.
---
Or iron grasp and agitation and take you straight to the basement and not leave until you’re dead.
---
Where did you get that from? None of those are correct
---
Y'all need real girlfriends
---
I'll respect it alright. I'll watch you do it, then respect you *to the ground*.
---
Julie looking like a snack there ngl
---
SICK! I just got it yesterday too!!
---
Pip shows you how usefull you were, and points do too most of the time. You just barely got your one pip. 13k while you escaped means 8k points in game. That is close to nothing tbh. I get more when I die most of the time
---
depends on which freddy canon
---
I'm a really big fan of "periods of low altruism," or times when everyone just works on gens the best they can.  There are sometimes situations that really call for this, and waiting for a second stage is OK, because you're able to pop 2 gens.  If you ever SWF, try doing gens all the time... See what happens when you spend every spare second doing gens... The game is over and won very quickly.
---
Didn’t you see? He read the spiderman 2018 comic so he knows how everything works /s
---
legion is by far the best at farming bp. I always get atleast 25k bloodpoints (if I'm trying and not messing around.)

Fair point, I meant high ranks as in good players. Mb.

why did you post this twice? XD

I have no idea who this guy is but the sound of a dark mine with this guy stomping around in it is terrifying.

Why are you watching/stalking his channel if you dont like him

I've actually been face camped 10 fucking times today. Why do rank 10 killers have the smallest egos in the world?

But... why is deadhard there?

Perk: Hallowed Ground
---
When broken, survivors can’t be put into the injured or dying states for 40/50/60 seconds.
---
whats so "asshole" about it though, not like its op
---
when im playing killer and someone does this to me at a window I cant walk around all I can say to myself is, "you won this round binch"
---
There’s rules? 
---
I have really wanted a plague doctor looking killer added to the game for a while. I am aware this is not it but he would be close enough so I am sold.  ~~Unless of course Jason could still be on the table~~
---
I agree, I think that it would be a fun sort of challenge, but I feel like 60/50/40 is too long, 10 would definitely be a lot easier, maybe 20/15/10? 
---
But this is pretty neat, I’m a fan!

"What's that? Ya wanted something like coldwind farms? WE'RE GOIN' TO THE GAME FELLAS, where my heartbeat radius will cover pretty much the WHOLE MAP. Suffer the agony of CONSTANTLY getting harder skillchecks, and end up hitting madness 3 even if I'm not trying to chase you directly, try to run away from that generator? I'll just overcharge it and it stacks with unnerving" etc.
---
Matches go on for ages, and when survivors make small amounts or progress I can easily undo it. 
---
to mock them duh

our club is slowly expanding 
---
this happened with a sfw when I was playing pig with a head popper addon combo, was quite disappointing considering they never got a gen done in order to activate the rbts.
---
THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY DETAILED EXPLANATION. I THINK I WILL CONTINUE LEAVING THAT FEATURE ON BECAUSE ITS VERY USEFUL WHEN YOURE PLAYING WITH FRIENDS, BUT THANKS AGAIN FOR TEACHING ME.

Had a game with an insidious leather face. I peek in then book it. End screen comes up he just types “GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ROOM IM PLAYING MIMECRAFT” then leaves.

And event points during things like the new year debacle
---
Do you still have perks popping up on your bloodweb?
---
I was just curious if he was still uploading videos after his ban on PS4.
---
Is there a way to see legion member faces? I want to see what the other 3 look like.
---
No but he was. Or did he blame you for it? I thought he was blaming soomeone else.
---
**TL/DR** : This post aims to add more diversity to the 3 perks named in the title as they've too much in common while all of them simply ain't appealing in their current state. Agitation enables a temporary and decaying haste after hooking a Survivor. Iron Grasp makes escaping literally impossible if it doesn't come up for your own greed or DStrike. Mad Grit heavily punishes bodyblocking Survivors.
---
not at all, remake freddy and original freddy look really different, remake freddy has the deformed skin of a burn victim that was based off of real burn victims to be "realistic" only problem was they based it off of SURVIVING burn victims (freddy didnt survive), whose skin healed into the deformity, while original freddy was more fleshy and looks like a dead burn victim, which he is.  
---
tldr remake freddy looks like a fish lmao and original freddy looks like a demon.
---
Many people in the commynity got to watch a video about him with some moee background information, I recommend watching that bideo by Ardetha: https://youtu.be/pBKEa3R1ru0
---
“If I’m goin down, IM TAKIN YOU WITH MEH!”
---
I do that to immersive Claudettes with 4k BP end game. Or the ass hole who keeps throwing pebbles at me. Lol
---
wait, did they intentionally choose remake freddy because they thought he was better? I always assumed it was because of price issues, god fucking damn it what FOOLSSSSSSSSSS.
---
He was accusing me of lagswitching. It’s further down in the chat and I didn’t edit the image so it’s only the one picture sadly. 
---
whenever people talk about tunneling with freddy they seem to lose full comprehension as to what tunneling actually means TBH, you can tunnel AND spread around sleep, its not hard. "b-but thats not tunneling" I don't fucking know bruh, like a man once said "it just works"

---
Why are ppl complaining about self care when its fucking garbo. Or the worst exhaust perk lmaoo
---
Omg b-but the killer rulebook says you're not allowed to use DS, borrowed time, adrenaline, and a purple flashlight OR play swf OR tbag!!!
---
Meg.
---
as a ps4 player, no
---
Don't cry, baby.
---
Are you trolling?
---
If you get 3-4 kills without a pip then you should stop camping.
---
BETTER THEN FREDDY!!!
---
but thats gay
---
Perhaps :^)
---
The original is way better imo
---
since when what lmao? noed isn't that common, found the survivor main bruh
---
I had a huntress do this for me. We both had trust issues but we got it done and i left through the hatch. 
---
Honestly I think a good mapdesign to model after would be something like the catacombs in Killing floor 2, subterranean areas with tunnels but actual wide open chasms for sightline purposes. if its anything like Lerys tho Id just afk til they leave, I just cant have fun on that map as killer
---
No, said the Killer.
---
r/DontDeadOpenInside
---
You're taking this all wayyy too seriously. 
---
Yeah because I don’t want another dlc with a great killer that has no cosmetics. Simple. 
---
Everytime there is a camper, i sacrifice my health so they can get out. Mostly because most of the time the killer is still gonna tunnel them when im down. Its just so they have a chance man.
---
Yeah. I messaged the killer afterwards a match (he was a camping doctor) and he said that It was a safe strat. The perks he ran were: Bbq &amp; chilli, Make your choice, overcharge and distressing. Don't know why he ran those perks if he was to camp.
---
But why not its a fair system espically for the killers because  they wouldn't  have to walk half way across the map for no reason  not with 4v4  its just my opinion something  i think should be implemented  into dead by daylight 
---
TBH, then the same would apply to killers who cannot handle a defeat and DC at the end of games when the gate's opened and survivors are running out.
---
Wait should my sensitivity be high for the nurse? (Thanks for the answer btw)
---
you did the math for a opened scheduled event that anyone can see on their website? man im impressed
---
I’m just gonna assume you’re either trolling or very new. Killers would win every single time in this mode. Every. 
---
Single. 
---
Time. 
---
Are you new???
---
Well balanced works when you exhausted too, also ded hard and balanced help in completely different situations. Either can save your ass. 
---
Also keep in mind that often times the people testing this stuff will bring this issues up, but it will be marked as non critical over other stuff and therefore not touched. Its the same thing that happens every update, the QA teams probably do pick up all the bugs we see in the game, note them down and gives them to the devs, but the devs have to prioritize the game crashing when you spawn in as dwight or trappers traps causing everyone to become stuck in the ground as such they don't have time to get to the Mangled particle bug or other aspects. Its no excuse but don't think that QA is probably not doing their jobs, whether a bug is reported and whether it is fixed are two very different things.
---
Nurse knocks down the doctor and kills him because there is only room for one medical professional.
---
&gt; The only thing that the survivors can do that the Actor can't is Emote.  
---
ah so the entire ability is worthless garbage, nice.  
---
making a disguise ability where you cant fully replicate who you're disguising is the most worthless thing in video games, what happened to the spy will happen to this killer, survivors will just "Spy check" each other by emoting, no one will EVER fall for it.
---
Nea before her killer transformation.
---
He sent his Twitch stream to go and witch hunt someone, would a good person do that?
---
I like it
---
Remember, survivors are balanced and the gameplay for killers is always fun and engaging and not running in a circle most of the time.
---
but hooked survivors activate whispers??
---
thats bs and you know it boi
---
Ayyy a fellow piggy fan!
---
Yeah, although the pig is in a good state, I think she needs some tweaks. Just like you mentioned, the jigsaw boxes should have a 25% chance of removing it. Also, the jigsaw boxes should be pretty far away from each other. Sometimes they spawn right next to each other, which is pretty dumb. I also agree with the add ons. She does have a lot of good add ons, and she has one of the best brown add ons in the game. But a lot of her add ons are meh.
---
But personally I think the biggest and most important change the pig needs is her add on rule set #2. That add on should be a base part of her base kit. The fact that survivors can see the auras of jigsaw boxes before the trap even activates is pretty dumb to me. When I'm playing survivor, I usually finish 2 jigsaw boxes before my trap even activates which makes the traps much less valuable than they can be. Having a survivor look around the map for jigsaw boxes without the aura does exactly what it is supposed to do;slow the game down. (just a lil bit) 
---
IT'S HILARIOUS TO SEE THEM HAVE A "OH SHIT OH SHIT!" MOMENT WHEN YOU JUST STAND STILL.
---
you again, smh
---
A good survivor will never be hit by a leatherface chainsaw. 
---
No  
---
But when I was playing SWF and we got a killer who was just standing around, we thought we might as well go for the hatch escape trophy. Turns out it was under hay or something on the Coldwind Farm Map. I think, we heard her but couldn't see and the sound was coming from the hay.
---
Or do what they nornally do and get rights to a different part of chucky. Like how they did Saw, Amanda Young in the pig costume and tapp both came from the same Saw game. Or how freddy and Quinten came from the remake instead of the Og series. They can try for the og childplay, or Seed of chucky, or the new remake if it crash and burns.
---
Exactly but what if the developer's  made it balanced for both the killer and survior  the killer they would take away there perks and add ons making them weak but not  op! 
---
Quentin.
---
And the survivors  idk how they would make them balanced 
---
I think Jake would go on backpacking trips with Dwight and Jeff in the wilderness, because they became friends and he can teach them some survival skills in the woods, as well as just hike around together. Nea and feng became friends as well and maybe would take some art courses together in their free time or go tagging together. Adam and claudette would have started dating by then. bill and David would occasionally meet up and do escape room games together for weird sentimental reasons.
---
Thanks very much for the detailed answer!
---
It's a lot better than most perks. Helps you get an edge on your basic killers with normal terror radiuses. I gotta say I'm a huge fan of blood hound, too. It's my favorite non-meta perk. If you're tryharding though, M&amp;A will do you better.
---
His chainsaw is unavoidable if there is no window or pallet. You can get 360'd, but that never happens. The movment speed ensures you hit survivors.
---
Why add another 7+ secs to a chase on the animation to wake them up and put them back to sleep, when they chase would probably end just as fast anyways. 
---
Once my friend and I were in a Coldwind Farm game and the killer was AFK (or so we thought) so we got all the gens done and then opened both of the exit gates. I had a daily ritual to escape with a new item and couldn’t find a chest so I managed to find the basement. I went down there just in time to see a Leatherface absolutely murdering our other teammate and I booked it out of the basement faster than I could’ve sneezed. It was truly petrifying. The killers name was “Guardian of my Domain” and apparently all he cared about was that one basement chest. I don’t go in basements anymore. 
---
I regularly do well as leatherface but the chainsaw barely gets any use. Its too slow to charge and progress. Its a campers wet dream tool and thats it.
---
The only time its any use is when a dumb survivior runs to a dead area. Even then youd probably down them in two hits easily enough
---
I figured no one wanted to play the map so they just said fuck it and went for the saves. Squeeze some fun out of a boring round.
---
I swear, if certain survivors get hit first, they just drop the game. They're usually the obsession too...
---
That speed boost will be negated by the slow down of powering the chainsaw. PWYF is already risky enough as it is. You have to fibd ur obsession loads for it to matter
---
I have a gripe with Hex: Ruin and it relates to how random skill checks tend to be. Especially if you've nearly got the gen completed and you get those random bursts of skill checks in quick succession.
---
Yeah, great skill checks won't regress your progress, but with how insane the timing is with the input delay on 60Hz screens I probably only land greats maybe 20% of the time. Whereas at a net cafe with 144Hz screens I can get great skill checks 90% of the time.
---
Freddy is unpredictable during transition, leading to potential mindgames.
---
If you chase normally you're likely going to get looped for multiple minutes, but if you can go invisible and sneak around them, you stand a fair chance of getting another hit. 
---
It's not enough to make him strong, exactly, but it might bring him up to par with Leatherface as a sort of "worse Spirit".
---
The saddest part about that is that they're not even trolling. They're literally just dumb. I mean, to be fair ok, when you're playing Nurse and Billy BBQ is a literall meta-golem enhancement, annoys me sometimes aswell but that's simply because they're already at your butt because while the aura's still displayed.
---
Every other Killer tho, can easily be mindgamed. Just head into another direction when the Survivor's been hooked or crouch behind a gen, not that hard at all geez.
---
IT'S TRUE, I'VE BEEN TRYING TI GET BBQ ON DOCTOR FOR 40 LEVELS AND ILEVEL TRAPPER TO 3 AND I GET IT
---
It's all old video.
---
I've never heard survivor rules.
---
Only rule I've heard is a killer one. Don't hook people who unhook themselves. Though that's less strict now that Deliverance is a thing.
---
Inb4 "omg Slippery Meat is crutch git gud".
---
Honestly meanwhile I'd expect people to say that. Salty loosers lol.
---
I don't feel at that is the case. The play with your food makes the slowdown not as bad, and instead makes the killer dangerous. PWYF is normally pretty bad, and it does require you to find your obsession. However my obsessions tend to be annoying people who want to get in my way so they are always able to be found and even when they are not, you got BBQ.
---
She doesn't have as much as most but she has quite a bit
---
Depends on the weapon, but yeah.
---
Considering he'd still a loopable 115% speed killer with no mobility, ranged attack, or instadown, I think it'd be pretty damn hard to make him overpowered.
---
This would leave his chase as a more disorienting but less effective version of Spirit.
---
Lore-wise, I believe the killers would try to attack each other. Devs mentioned it some stream a *while* back.
---
To be honest I don't understand why people are nowadays still running Selfcare. Like, for fucks sake, if you're running SC atleast also go for that Botany. Meanwhile people will waste more time with selfhealing than they're actually investing into gens.
---
Idk about you but personally  i love a good chase  but the game gets boring and no fun when a killer leaves because it is unfair for them 
---
Jake and David
---
Meg mains rise up!
---
every time i hear that dreadful bell ringing unexpectedly always scares me
---
Lol 
---
LMFAO😂
---
Welp i tried  but nobody seemed to think my idea was cool 
---
It was an accident ;-;
---
Depends where you live, if its not in us or eu yeah the lobbies can take even an hour,
---
Just pray dedicated servers come quick,i think this game will get lots more players with that 
---
To be fair, I built my first PC for under $450 and it crushed this game when it was in early access on steam.
---
I recently upgraded my wraith for the first time and once I used his speed add ons for the first time, it was the most fun in this game I had in a long time.
---
Agreed, that’s idiotic. I played a game tonight with leatherface and patrolled. 2 gens needed doing and all 4 were on the same side of the map. I caught people, put them in the basement, and went back up to slow gens. I got lucky enough that a Nea forgot I had noed because she butt danced by the door. For that reason and that I had bbq, I hooked her rather than let her go. She was the last survivor. 
---
Would that mean they’d get rid of his wings?
---
Dead hard is a bit more reliable, if you’re good at chases. Balanced can be godly but only on some maps. No sense running both when you could run something else to give information 
---
I certainly have. It is excellent. I usually run Ruin , Bamboozle and Pop goes the Weasel for my core build, and sub out a mix of BBQ, Tinkerer, Monitor and Abuse, Lightborn, Discordance and Blood Warden myself. Play with your food really can help, but it isn't 100% reliable and often I try to kill my obsession early (to remove D-strike from the match), so it doesn't fit my personal style of play, but I recognize it as being pretty fucking strong when it works.
---
Reading your several responses to the other two lead me to believe you don't understand the actual use and efficiency of the chainsaw.
---
If you can get in range to swing, you can use a chainsaw. That is very often. If there is a window too close or a pallet, sure, you can't use your ability.
---
I've hit "good" survivors and have been hit plenty of times. A single obstacle is not a guaranteed safe, even with a good survivor. Some areas, when expertly wiggled through, can let you outlast a chainsaw indefinitely, but those are few and far between.
---
tl;dr: Higher skill Leatherfaces know how to use a chainsaw and will hit you.
---
There’s no harm in learning how to play nurse though it will feel like a giant grind at first 
---
People really out here thinking dh and adrenaline are op
---
So much this 
---
Believe me, nothing will scare you anymore once you've that T-posing legacy Nurse who blinks onto you.
---
It doesn't need to get much use to be helpful during a match. A reason Leatherface is pretty underrated is his tool doesn't really get in his way, you don't need to use it all the time to get your kills. Knowing when to pull it out and when its better to go for a mallet is a big part of his gameplan, if I'm not running charge addons (which i most likely am, and you should too) the chainsaw wouldn't really come out until I've busted up the safer pallets.
---
This guy DBDs
---
The bare minimum way an idea like this would work would be a 2 killer/6 survivor and even then, that’s pushing it. It would be interesting to have the killers compete points wise in the match (with stipulations, of course) and then the winner gets like 1.5x bloodpoints or something
---
Someone's steamed like broccoli
---
Thank you.
---
There was a singular claim
---
Ace, Claudette and Adam. Just becouse i like their cosmetics

---
Or just go to r/Anarchy and tell them they don’t know what anarchy is, and that it isn’t comparable with socialism. Then, ironically enough, they ban you for breaking the rules. 
---
I could not say it any better.  Nothing worse than someone going down and then, one by one, all survivors disconnect.
---
The final 15 seconds have caused me to downvote. Damn, bro. Why you gotta do that?
---
Agitations sounds fun, but the speed buff should maybe work like Devour Hope and actually go away after a set amount of time rather than slowly go down. I remember thinking of adding the same secondary effect to iron grasp, cool to see someone else with this idea, not sure about the extra wiggle time added though, the wiggle mechanic already feels like it does jack shit with the hook placements, why make it 101% worthless? Mad Grit is just a weird perk, while adding something to it is not wrong  (since it does need a buff) anything added to it will always feel kinda forced and not fitting, i believe a small rework would be better here.
---
Haha I get! Survivor bad...toxic.......killer good...I
---
Upvotes pls
---
Idk i think it would be fair in a way cause he could be able to see where the survivor was idk how that would really work tbh but if he could fly for only a short amount of time id say it be fair cause remember he's using his power to fly 
---
I hate this sooo much....i was left alone as a survivor with 4 gens to go....the killer was nice though and showed me the hatch...was the best day ever
---
I get banned from subs just because of my post history in other subs and where I’m subscribed. 
---
Most killers are bad killers. Leatherface has an on-demand instadown that is easy to aim. This immediately invalidates such strategies as gen-tapping in a chase, stopping to try and blind the killer, taking a hit to protect an injured survivor, bum-rushing the hooks/totems in front of the killer, and other cheesy things because Leatherface is someone you have to respect in a chase. If they play greedy in a chase they die. If they play careful and safe, I can deal with that too, I've been playing long enough.
---
I'm not saying Leatherface is a strong killer. He is however, definitely not weak, especially when you have the right addons and perks.
---
Thanks, I needed some salt for my fries.
---
Yeah see like something  like that 
---
&gt;The thing is no matter what you're actually doing with her, Amanda will never be better than A tier.
---
So, not every killer needs to be nurse or billy level. Amanda still needs buffs and most of her add ons should be completely reworked. She probably wouldn't even hit A tier from that but she'd be a lot more fun and variable if 90% of her add ons weren't garbage that has an unnoticible, negligible effect on the match.
---
That would be really cool to see give it a nice change of pace

---
There is very little in this game that requires skill. 
---
He could use it like a killer’s version of balanced landing, I suppose
---
Most days I save someone and then barrel headfirst at the killer to get punched in the face and distract them
---
Some days I do that and the killer doesn't even touch me, running past to hard tunnel the guy who's already a mile away because I never unhook within radius
---
Feels bad, man
---
All Killets have the exact same hitbox for attacks. Same shape, size, and duration. This is what allows you to hit someone on the other side of a window or Haddonfield fence if they are close enough.
---
A number of Killers have differing lunge ranges due to mechanics (Shape is smaller in EW1 but longer in EW3, Hag and Nurse have reduced lunges after power uses) or move speed (any 110% Killer has a reduced lunge and a Killer with a speed boost has a larger lunge from the math of speeds effecting distance traveled). But all Killers use the same hitbox.
---
There is only one thing in the entire game to effect Killer attack hitboxes. Long bar for Billy and Cannibal. It makes their chainsaw hitboxes bigger.
---
Sounds more like: "Well yes, but I don't want to admit it because it is something I don't like".
---
Especially if they made the maps bigger and even had secret places that the killers had to find. Things like hidden generator that the survivors could see but the killers couldn’t
---
So in your logic I’m allowed to use hacks because rank doesn’t matter right? Because if exploits are cheats that can be used to gain an unfair advantage and in your eyes are completely fine, then hacking is fine.
---
Witch-hunting is fucking cancerous and sending your braindead legion of fans to go and mass report someone’s profile because he beat Ochido in a game is super bannable.
---
Him creating the cancerous survivor has ruined the game completely for most people. He uploads his shit content and all the assholes watch them and see what he’s doing, they’ll then do the exact same thing and they’ll spread the toxicity throughout the game and make it like LOL (gross)
---
He ban evaded like 2 perma bans by creating new accounts, then he got hardware banned. He then moved over to PS4 as another way of evading his PC bans. And now people believe he’s lurking in the shows on the XBOX version of DBD.
---
Absolutely. I made a [lot of suggestions](https://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a9o05l/pig_rework_suggestion/) recently and most people seemed to be pretty much in agreement.
---
It's nice that they have been looking at her and worked most of combat straps into the power, but there's no denying that a vast majority of her add ons are downright useless, and essentially have no noticible effect in game.
---
I’d love to see a killer VS
---
Man look how happy Billy is, it makes my heart melt. Very nice drawing.
---
X for doubt, but also
---
Pipping is easy, but what most people play for is a 4k
---
First time ever I did a Kobe, this pretty much happened. 
---
This was back when I couldn't tell the difference between Leatherface and Billy.
---
He camped guy until he disconnected
---
Yeah cause if the killers could see it it would be totally  unfair  i think this is a good idea 
---
Survivors cannot let go. That's why camping is so effective in DbD. Survivors cannot accept that some cannot be saved.
---
Mhm. They can see the other generators so why not let the survivors see the hidden ones
---
Oh absolutely, however, one exception is the hostage situation. Sitting 10+ minutes walking around looking for the locker-hopper is just a waste of life.
---
Oh boy, have I got a perk for you. Look up Deliverance.
---
Missing 5 trophies, both of nurses, doctors shock one (been getting adepts) one of hags and the all 4 survivors jump through hatch at the same time. 
---
Although his view isn't the best with Spirit's hair in the way... he's still rooting for his friend 😆
---
Yeah i do hope the developers do something  about something about this even if they don't  add like 2v 6 they should at least make it so you get hooked at least 2  times at least 
---
You can make a custom perk icon of this and make your perk look like that on PC
---
Yeah its pretty good on just about everyone but Wraith and Doctor.
---
It lets you get closer to gens before survivors hear you coming, which means less time for them to react and move away, which means more chases and those chases are started when the killer is closer to the survivor. Also really good synergy with Nurse's calling.
---
I got it awhile back, some of the trophies are a bit tricky but some of the hardest ones aren't necessary for the platinum since they come from DLC.  I'm all caught up for all the trophies until the next chapter. Good luck on joining the club!
---
If I’m right, I believe they helped develop (or they develop) a mobile game called Identity V and they have a 2 v 8 mode so who knows
---
When Myers released the Devs said his Terror Radius in EW1 is 8m, then 16m in EW2 and 32m in EW3. I've always remembered that easily because the number doubles.
---
Yeah that would be awsome but as far as killers go there's  this new killer called the ring master i heard his ability  he can shape shift into survivor's so id doubt they'd add jeepers for a while cause licence and all that 
---
Everyone calling Nea a killer, when it was Meg all along.
---
I thought the issue was going to be the Fake Pallets not showing up yellow. 
---
Or is that fixed now?
---
Oh damn, they’re gonna Hello Neighbor: Hide and Seek us lol
---
I'm pretty sure that this game wouldn't have become so popular is it wasn't for the toxicity factor and all those toxic youtubers with their shenanigans. The bming, toxic gameplay, killer bullying are all shunned by the devs but it was actually the thing that made the game so popular on Youtube. It's sad but you can't deny that factor having a huge impact here.
---
You could easily play it smart against the Killer disguising as an injured Survivor. Simply refuse to heal them until they follow you to a safe place, like a pallet. So if they do turn out to be the Killer you'll be safe before they get a chance to hit you (assuming it takes time to come out of the disguise and attack)
---
But shes the best hider in the game... 
---
I got lucky with the hatch one. I was playing with a group I’m SWF with the intention of getting that trophy and we had a killer that was AFK. 
---
You didn't tell us your rank.
---
Obviously, but you're the one acting like there was many super easy ways to counter the Perk.
---
Really hmm i wonder if it could  work in dead by daylight  they would just need to get rid if the killers perks and add ons ?
---
Ok thanks for explaining, now It has sense for me. 
---
I mean, is it really fair that you die at the very start of the game because you don't even get a chance of running away from the hook? It's a viable strat to get kills, but is it fair? My main problem is that people don't admit that they did something scummy, but I'm absolutely fine with them doing it since it's sometimes necessary, survivors have strats of their own that make the game feel unfair. It's like saying "git gud" in chat after using DS at the very end of the game right next to the exit gate, it just doesn't feel right 
---
I had a 30 minute one once
---
If they can do it in that game then they should do it dead
---
They’d probably just need to nerf them or give them random perks. I could see the Entity liking that kind of chaos
---
Nice! I only have the repetition ones to get but I’m a survivor main so it’s been awhile lol thanks!
---
I love how you pull some perceived fact out of your ass based on me saying three words. Lmao.
---
We had that once, it was set up perfectly but we had Kruger’s map and the hatch spawned in boiler room by the bed and all 4 of us couldn’t get the jump in prompt in time. This was when the trophy was glitched though so hopefully second time should work 
---
* Survivor used Object of Obsession.  
---
* Survivor get found in 10 seconds because of Object of Obsession.    
---
* Survivor gets downed.   
---
* Survivor misses Decisive Strike.  
---
* Survivor disconnects.  
---
The mods of the discord arent part of BHVR. The discord used to be community run but the devs offered to make it official and the discord mods accepted.
---
Where is the evidence about the underage part?  
---
What evidence is that video supposed to show anyway, that he is interested in girls?
---
Yeah like not make them fast but not make them slow either haaaa 😂 omg
---
Some QoL changes would make Amanda so much better. The hatch change is one I HUGELY want. It’s bullshit that it exists as a loophole in her power. 
---
Also I’ll throw in the age-old suggestion of “Jigsaw boxes shouldn’t be visible until the trap is active”
---
It's like this in rank 20 EU aswell.
---
I dc if I get camped and bodyblocked on the fucking basement.

After the 2 hooks, I don't want to be a dick to my team.
---
Yeah hopefully it works next time. We didn’t even jump in one after the other. Some one opened the hatch with the key but didn’t know that it made you jump right in and I was still searching for it! I’d say we were all in within 10-15 seconds though. 
---
Amanda wore the pig costume in the movie
---
The underage part i don't know about, but it shows that he was sexually harassing people online.
---
Nothing about this game is really "fair". It is an asymmetrical 1v4 horror game. It's not made to be fair. As long as it doesn't violate ToS it is 100% fair game, and I don't wanna hear it because the shit survivors pull is way more unfair and unfun then camping. People need to play with the assumption that if you get caught, there is a good chance you die.
---
I wonder what it would look like if the killers could mori each other after. I could definitely see a thing where the winner could choose to mori the loser or just walk off and each killer has their own little animation they’d do for each choice
---
Why wouldn't they be viable strats though? 
---
It's especially dumb that people think tunneling is super bad when it absolutely makes sense. Especially if you turn it around to the Survivor side. You see 2 Generators, 1 of them is almost done and the other hasn't been touched. It's obvious which Gen you're going to work on.
---
The reason they got amanda instead of John wasnt because of licensing, it was because John Kramer's morals are that everyone deserves a chance, which makes no sense ingame as he is disgusted by killers (ironic, I know) amanda was the only one who actually enjoyed killing others, and was most commonly the one wearing pig mask in the movies also, which is why she's in the game. You're right about the Freddy one though.
---
That is exactly what this and many other complaints come down to with this game.
---
I can tell you why. It's super easy to rank up as survivor. You need 4 survivors of similar rank per 1 killer for a rank 20 game. If your killer rank is 20 you probably just got the game, so you need 4 survivor players who happen to also just buy the game and join your lobby, and be from your region.
---
I've seen people DC just because they were found. Doing a gen. In the middle of a wide open area.
---
Were they expecting me to just not check that gen? It's the easiest one on the whole map for me to block, if you want to play in total stealth go do literally any other gen!
---
Because long que times are fun? A lot of people just want Bloodpoints...
---
Spain’s age of consent is 16.  
---
That would make sense but the design of the knife is based on a bird feather.
---
For real  😂 like cmon in honestly don't  know how that would work i mean he'd  probably  be a crappy version of themselves and you'd  be able to tell cause honestly  if that was the case it be wayyy to hard to distinguish  you're  team mates
---
Not half bad honestly. Mad Grit would be dope if the successful hit animation was lowered a bit too, you would just be an unstoppable carrier and nothing could get between you and a hook. It would still be situational, but it would be hella fun when it worked.
---
Isn't there a way to plug a mouse and keyboard to console?
---
Maybe like a light mist coming out from around them but if there’s heavy mist in the map, it’s harder to tell
---
Ehhh, not a huge fan of that. All the uniqueness and creativity of the Childs Play franchise is Chucky, Charles Lee Ray is just a muderer by himself, which is pretty boring compared to all the other killers.
---
&gt;Survivor uses OoO
---
&gt;BMs while doing it
---
&gt;They get caught
---
&gt;Saves DS
---
&gt;SWF misses flashlight save
---
&gt;DC
---
Alternative is them DC'ing in the basement.
---
Camping is only really a valid strategy at the end of the game when all the gens are done. There really isn't a reason to do it throughout the game. I try not to tunnel most matches, unless I have a survivor that irritated me somehow or there's an incentive to (ie trying to get use out of Dying Light).
---
We should always kill ourselves on hook because being able to be rescued from the hook is a crutch mechanic for bad survivors who can't go the entire game without being hooked once
---
 Eww running Add-ons or offerings as a survivor ewwww 
---
Nice troll post.
---
Good point but right now he isn't even an M1 killer. If you take away his ability and he can't even M1 anyone 
---
If you can come up with an original joke or play on words with one of the hex perk names, cool. Otherwise if you put one of those on you're just an NPC who repeats whatever lame jokes other people say. 
---
Adrenaline &gt; Selfcare imo
---
Tunneling is inherently worth. It's on the survivor for unhooking with killer nearby without Borrowed Time.
---
Camping is a lot more situational as it depends on how survivors play in general, if they are instantly there to be altruistic that will make me believe they are there every time forcing me to search around.
---
Seeing many people talking that his power should be blinding people whit his helmet. It's is nice and creative and people couldnt really Look behind them without getting blinded but I think He should be able to teleport to lockers, this would fit his mining worker theme and and give him good map pressour which I think is better than a lamp on his head 
---
Yes the most populous rank of active players probably isn't rank 20, but it still shouldn't take 20+ minutes to get a game. 
---
A leatherface is an m1 killer in 90% of chases. The normal terror radius means the survivor is in a strong position to lead a chase. Hes good at camping and thats it
---
Yep. Certain dlc trophies are much harder than the platinum though.
---
Like deranged pursuit and skilled huntress
---
This was me today. I am the basement guardian, guardian of the basement.
---
This has got to be the best thing I've seen in weeks. 
---
Maybe rebind the button to dead hard? I have mine on E and my vault/pallet on space
---
2 in the "jungle gym" downstair, 1 in the fridge zone, 1 in the security room, 1 to jump down near the pig mask and one near an exit gate i think. Something like that yeah...
---
How is that bs? 
---
You cant tank hits. Thats the only thing i agree with. Everything else no
---
I don't get the hate toward a lot of "crutch" perks, both killer and survivor side. It's super to help you. It's a *perk*. Also, all of the the ones people bitch about constantly have well known counters.
---
NOED? Do the totems, assume lower tier killers or killere who just seem unskilled will have it.
---
Adrenaline? NOED.
---
BBQ? Hide in a locker, Distortion, get in the killer's terror radius, or just run one one way for a few seconds after a survivor is hooked, then walk ing the opposite direction and hide.
---
DS? Enduring, NOED in certain situations.
---
Dead Hard? Just swing early on and bait it out.
---
* Flashlights
---
* Bodyblocking a hook
---
* Breaking Hooks
---
* Spamming pallet vaults to make notifications
---
* MAXIMUM IMMERSION
---
* Holding the game hostage when the gates are open
---
*SWF
---
And if we go back in time:
---
* Infintes
---
* Sabo
---
* Getting somewhere out of bounds
---
All of these things are valid strategies (Except SWF Discords and holding the game hostage, that's cheating/against ToS) but it doesn't mean they are fair or fun, camping is the same thing except you could just struggle on hook and make the killer lose the match for it. 
---
Well if you get bitten just don’t do anything. If he hooks you it’s a waste of time for him. And a waste of a bite
---
&gt;Now let's inspect Killer perks:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Ruin: just equip this perk.  
---
&gt;NOED: just equip this perk and wait for the endgame.  
---
&gt;BBQ: just equip this perk and do what you'd be doing anyway.
---
While you are right about how these perks work, I think we should be fair enough and give them the same treatment you used for the mentioned survivor perks.
---
Ruin: Can be either very strong or useless, depends on spawn location (can be hidden well, can stand right in the open), Depends on the genskills of the survivors: Hit great skillchecks (on PC definitly a learnable thing, dunno about console, seems like FPS screws you over there) and it will be a midtier perk.
---
NOED: Depends on the playstyle of the survivors: Gen rushing: this perk will have a huge impact on the endgame. Searching for totems because NOED is meta right now: It will be useless and will never activate. Becomes basically a free Anti gen rush perk even if you don't equip it, since there is a chance you could have it. Still: Get's countered by small game like DS get countered by Endurance.
---
BBQ: Actually, just like "We Are Gonna Live Forever" mainly used for BP. Aura vision is a nice to have extra, but the impact of that for the normal game is minimal for every killer that needs more than 3 seconds to travel to that location (or if the survivors decides to just stay in that exact same place for a few seconds)
---
Whenever I run 3's we make it our mission to try and get the random out. Last night we had a whole 3-man rescue operation into the basement to get that Nea out of there, and it worked. It's fun to have an extra side objective like that. Keeps it interesting.
---
massive blocks of text...? that take up maybe 5% of the screen? man your size perception is totally on point. wouldnt surprise me if u did the same with your dick size. also not my problem the music choice isnt your taste. its almost like people have different music tastes... bazaar right?
---
Not only that, they really enjoy camping the Hook. I can't go out and play the game when there are two of you right there forcing me to stay next to the hook!
---
chill out in what sense? your'e being an indirect prick looking for attention incredibly bad. you HAVE to be trolling. no one can be this stupid, i literally pray for the sake of the worlds sanity that youre trolling. so you KNEW u were coming across rude but have the audacity again to play victim? lmaooooo
---
I main nurse on console and do pretty well every game. Just play it man who gives a shit what people say 
---
That's what it seems like to me. I just don't get why they do that. Or if I knock them down once they disconnect also
---
Go for it, don’t really understand why you’ve come crying on here? 
---
If you want to play those two go ahead, no one said you can’t, just that precision isn’t as easy with the huntress and frame drops hinders console nurse players.
---
Games like Rainbow six siege are a night and day difference between console and pc, but you don’t see people saying “oh no you can’t play on console it’s crap compared to pc”. 
---
Get over it, either play them or don’t, real simple.
---
You make an account to post this poorly made video?
---
Those things have never ruined my experience. Camping has multiple times.
---
The key is to use frankin's demise as killer hit each survivor holding an item and dc.
---
That would be nice if it would be giving you deep wound state instead, so like BT. 
---
If you need to camp, it just means you're either too lazy to play or just suck at finding and chasing survivors ;^)
---
&gt;You don't have to take it so personally when your opponent rushes their objective, it's pretty cunty IMO to support the double standard that gens can be rushed but not kills, when it's each side's only objective. It's just straight up entitlement, if you feel that your opponent removing gens or survivors from the match ASAP is "ripping all the fun" or that they should be obligated to provide it for you. Nobody likes being rushed out of a match early, but there's no difference between getting gen rushed out of it or kill rushed, just your level of empathy for each side.  
---
&gt;Reply
---
Woah, calm down there.... i never said i tunnel or like tunelling. My point is that the owner of the post considers Tunelling a thing, he should consider gen rushing a thing aswell. Otherwise he is contradicting himself.
---
once an ass, always an ass
---
This was a great example of how not to even try to evade a nurse lol
---
Am I the only one who finds this amusing as a killer?  
---
It's funny and pathetic. 
---
I'm only need "where did they go" and the prestige trophys
---
So its your third? :) Doesnt matter man. Like I said. 150hours is nothing in this game. Ask anyone experienced, will tell u the same thing. I know it because I know how I was, and how my friend with 168hours is now... I dont want to discuss this anymore, but if you feel like you are a good player - watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5aUfbrZnN0  This guy has 1800hrs I think, and personally I dont feel at that level yet. Thats a good player in my eyes.
---
except he's had decent behaviour for the entire time he was on console 
---
He makes great content for YT no doubt but a terrible person and a cancer to the game,especially when he promotes his followers to do the same toxic shit he does.
---
i agree, Agitation would benefit low mobility killers more if it remained at full force for some time.
---
Yeah, good luck. BBQ has the lowest spawn rate of all perks in the bloodweb. Plus it’s also predetermined once you start/prestige that character, and you can get to lv50 and still get fucked. It’s not even that powerful of a perk anyway, 95% of the reason people run it is because of the extra bloodpoints it offers solely for progression. Tbh, they should rework WGLF too, so it awards for progression too.
---
I don't think that's how it works, you can't get a license from someone who bought a license. Amanda wears the same thing in the movies also and the addons are also from the movie. Amanda was just the perfect fit
---
What’s the perk to be able to blink twice?
---
Legend has it that they're still there to this day.
---
*gags*
---
Everyone is surprised when they first find out
---
SWF are the worst and can be the most toxic.
---
Worst experience I had with SWF was having my game held hostage for almost an hour by 3 P3 Claudettes after their buddy, another P3 Claudette, died on hook. I didn't even do anything remotely scummy. I didn't have Ruin yet, I don't like running NOED, and they all look the same so fuck if I know who I'm chasing. Whenever I found and hit one, they just DCed too.  Ended the game with 2 hooks (On the same person) and 3 DCs, and got called every flavor of insult in post-game chat. Now I just dodge the lobby when there's more than 2 Claudettes.
---
I'd say that's more toxic than camping ever will be. That was pretty recent too, about a week before the lunar event.
---
Mind explaining why Console Nurse is considered harder? Just a Frame rate issue?
---
Fyi, Huntress has 115% speed lunge. They changed this a while ago. Nurse and Hag still is the same with shorter lunge after power activation.
---
Wow it really doesn’t prove your point. I said go ahead and play them, no one cares if you do or don’t. 
---
What’s the issue if some say you can’t do well with them, if you do well good for you, just because some say you won’t do well doesn’t mean it’s true. 
---
That’s what I don’t get with your OP.
---
Plus, if I remember certainly Noob was only banned for hacking a legacy skin he had lost during the era of fucked up safe-files. I don't know but I personally think hacking a legacy skin isn't dramatic at all, if he gets punished then for the very fact that he hacked but not that he hacked a legacy skin.
---
But to be honest I never really cared about any "bigger personallities" in gaming communities. And besides of playing against Bahroo and with Ryuti I also never had anything to do with anyone of 'em.
---
Why not both? Just save two traps for end game.
---
Good meme btw :D
---
The kid is 19 and liked some 16yo girls. You would be surprised how many 18+ people have a relationship with people under the age of 18...
---
Frame rate issues (loving those 10 fps after a blink) and unpredictable freezes for the most part, then throw in there controller's sensitivity and you have more than a few good reasons to consider it much harder than the pc version.
---
A very dapper tree :D
---
I can even understand to a point DC at start of match (even then you are a CUNT that fuc*s over other 3 survivors I don't mind) but DC after 20ish minutes match .. Man I still get my win you just wanted 20 minutes of your life and got nothing to show for it ..., at least take that 3k BP you earned. .
---
Hope is the counter to NOED supposedly. Haven’t confirmed it but it does match the speed boost that the killer gets.
---
This is the very reason why I think it's important we've Killers with a huge variety of skillceilings. Just yesterday I said that it's GOOD that Legion is more or less effective but easy as fuck, simply because not every Killer should be on Nurse/Huntress level in terms of skill requierement. It's a videogame after all, people want to have fun and slowly but surely improve, not getting beat up and swore on until they simply don't want to anymore due to too heavy learning curves.
---
Regardless, I'm a PC Legacy 3 Nurse but I still respect folks that are actually doing that console Nurse/Huntress to 'emselfes. Keep going bro, don't give up. That's what they want after all. Adept, git gud, and tear these beasts apart.
---
Yeah although no add-on doctor is really nothing to worry about. 
---
It would be too easy to find a hatch then
---
Cool new meme format :D
---
Why not? If there isn't anyone playing at your rank and region at the moment, should the matching system toss in rank 1 players from a different region to your lobby just so they would leave after they look at the 300+ ping?
---
Wouldn't dare to say "counter". Investing atleast 2 minutes into attempting to spot and cleanse dull's just to deny the slim chance that the Killer uses NOED isn't proper counterplay imo. I mean sure, it destroys it. But the mechanic behind it is just dumb as Survivors have to invest time to participate in a gamble they'll most likely lose anyway.
---
Except it's Freddy or LF, then always go for the totems as these fellas are NOED onetricks anyway lol.
---
The idea of Agitation giving you a speed buff for a set time would just help give you a better value out of it, especially if you are playing Hag or Trapper that would benefit like crazy from reaching a desired trap location (or multiple ones), trapping them and then going off to disrupt gen progression without losing too much time. Yeah, the idea you have feels immersive for sure, but perks need to give a solid value to the intended player they want to help, if they don't do that we end up with a Mad Grit situation, which you correctly stated comes from fear (and i would like to add basic not understanding of what the games needs) of making a perk that power-creeps the rest.
---
I will say freddys aura and stall isn’t to be underestimated (it’s better than people think so long as you don’t just use it to tunnle) but this seems like an interesting idea
---
What you call counter, i call "A major waste of time, taking into consideration the undeniable fact that the game is not designed to have an actual functional secondary objective yet (there is not even  proper downtime in the game to warrant you spending some of that time looking for the totems) and so we have this band aid bull-piss of a perk ,that may or may not be in the killer's load-out, in a vain attempt to prolong games".
---
At least when killer DC's everyone left gets a escape and bloodpoints.
---
I've been playing with 100 sens since december. Since then I have been missing attacks MUCH less. It takes like a week but you'll get used to it.
---
I don't understand why there isn't something in place to avoid this, similar to, say, Overwatch. The game can perfectly track whether you deliberately press the "LEAVE MATCH" button or your internet goes dark (or you don't even load into the game because the game freezes during your loading screen). 
---
Why not give a 5 minute ban on the first deliberate disconnect, then a 10 minute ban, then 20 minutes, then an hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, until eventually you get banned completely? Have it reset every month or two or with every rank reset so people CAN disconnect from a game being held hostage. I mean, they do ban DCers on PC anyway now and then (I don't know about console tbh, but I think they started banning too?), so why not do it like this right away? People will think twice about DCing just to flip off the killer and screw their team mates over. I mean, that doesn't keep them from suiciding on their first hook and screwing their team mates over that way, but at least the killer gets points for that - look at me, Survivor main, talking here.
---
And yes, I'm perfectly aware this system would not do anything against people unplugging their LAN cable or turning off their router, but it would at least be a start. Right now, after rank reset (from 1 to 10), I have more games with DCs than games without anyone DCing.
---
I don't. It doesn't foster anything positive from killers ragequitting. 
---
Don't forget most Wraiths, also if a killer seems particularly bad at using their secondary ability and/or suck at looping they might compensate with NOED, also it's used by good players to go full overkill and.....this is a mess BHVR.
---
Hey no horseplay here
---
Can confirm, great on hag/Freddy/legion/pig/Myers also on nurse/doc if you want a difrent playstyle 
---
Hmm well in terms of Hag and Trapper I can definetly see that, that's a good point. Even tho those 2 are probably the only one's where it's relevant on, I'll definetly adjust. Would be a shame as Trapper and Hag are pretty underplayed anyway, I'd like to give them the support they deserve. I don't like that it's more or less copy pasting of Devour Hope with twisted values but as it appears to be the most efficient way I'll take it. Especially as I like DH to begin with, it's a well balanced perk and successfully snowballing it feels so damn good anyway.
---
forsenDiglett
---
Myers/pig yes. 8m tr on Myers and much easyer times geting close to gens to crouch as pig
---
Huntress is a no, as her lullaby is not effected by perks
---
A few of us actually suggested hardcore mode 2-3+ years ago,  no perks, no items for anyone.
---
What show was this. I remember it vaguely 
---
I wanna know the story behind this pic
---
MBV was a remake?
---
I'll have to check out the original.
---
Shadow dance green and windstorm green (or yellow I guess) should be baseline, they actualy make chasing useibg cloak viable
---
#BINGBONG
---
How did he leave from there?
---
It's just an artifact from an old idea from a time long forgotten, it just happens to not have been touched by the hammer of rework yet.
---
Until then, use it only for the end game memes of looping a killer to get a few extra BP before leaving.
---
So you are saying Ochido made "mistake" just once?
---
More than that

does anyone remember when freddie was nerfed would it be an idea to just go back to the way he was as people know how to play against him for anyone who doesnt know whatbthis was is bassicly when u play as freddie everything is darker for some reason
---
Nea
---
I’m gonna keep my low expectations and I understand why people aren’t liking that this port is being made but wouldn’t it make sense to reveal that the game early to just generate hype? I think this is purely just a business decision and not them shoving another console in our face that they’re not going to fix. Then again, the Switch port could be a whole disaster and PS4 will never be fixed. Idk what to think. 
---
Just watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBKEa3R1ru0) and you'll understand why a majority of the community doesn't like him and approves of him being banned multiple times.
---
I wanna know why they seem to act so chill about it. Like "Oh is it Friday? Jim's doing his thing again".
---
Hope is a decent perk but not worth running imo. Maybe if you like being chased and combine it with Adrenaline it may be more useful but personally I don't think it's worth it most of the time as survivors are rarely in the game for longer than a minute after the 5th generator is complete.
---
This is what i fucking hate about this game, perk abilities need to be limited so they don't benefit the already strong killers, this will continue being a problem until drastic changes are made to the game to either :
---
*Even the playing field for killers or 
---
*Give killer specific benefits from perks or killer specific perks (this change that would be the least desirable of the two, since nothing much will be done to change the overall gameplay, just patch some holes here and there.)
---
Why are you still defending this guy? He deserved his ban and i hope he wont get unbanned anytime soon.
---
Creative use of muppet pig to relate to the original format, this meme has more depth than what initally meets the eye.
---
Yeah the game doesn’t look anything like this on ps4 
---
If you blink towards someone and you don’t see them don’t waste another blink and don’t blink constantly cause that would be predictable 
---
Valid/viable? Sure. Fun or clever? No. 
---
That's it. That's all there is to say about it. 
---
That's my bad, I thought you were the guy I was replying to
---
I played as a basement bubba today and it wa just hilarious when survivors think you are afk but you aren't and chainsaw them.
---
Yeah but if your playing to a rank 1 standard for instance, it's not fair to go and start farming rank 15s to get points. Cos if your the killer and you belong at a higher rank, none of those survivors will have a good time. Think about other players maybe...
---
It took me a long while of scrolling before I realized that subreddit isn't a joke...
---
It’s also difficult because you cannot turn as quickly or precisely with a joystick.
---
Lery’s is a lot worse imo 
---
Honestly i feel like this can be said for alot of games and its sad
---
Yea got it, the nurse blink grab trophy is garbage. Most of the trophies are pretty easy even tho some of them are kinda grindy. And well the hatch escape thing can be super annoying if u dont have a group
---
The thing is at lery's it's much easier to catch Survivors offguard thanks to it being an in-door map. At Swamp Nurse can be spotted relative easily, especially when you decide to wear Legacy skins or the Sall'o Lantern. Plus Lery's has an absurd amount of vaults, which Nurse obviously can punish with ease.
---
And the very worst thing after all is that Nurse's worst weaknesses are stealth and mindgame. I'd dare to say Lery's also a good map to mindgame a Nurse, but in terms of stealth swamp is a worse pain in the ass in my opinion.
---
He hasn’t been banned 3 times, 
---
&gt; I wouldn’t expect a killer to give me an escape
---
Thats what most survivors expect on a 1-2 man survivor game tho. If I dont (which 95% of the times I dont) Im usually called a sweaty killer and told to KMS.
---
And lets face it, you doing that its a waste of time for both os us, you have not a slight chance of winning with 1 or 2 survivors only, so why even bother really, lets move on to the next proper match asap, thats my entire point.
---
I dont want to be stuck in an unbalanced match where I just cant lose, I dont like it, I want it to be over asap, if you think thats entitlement then yes Im entitled.
---
*flames in the chat
---
*it's kyf
---
"You have been disconnected from the host"
---
The only reason I hate lery’s more is because there are so many walls, and sometimes it’s hard to predict where a survivor is going to go, but yeah I guess the vault thing is pretty good 
---
Yea I’m on pc steam name is “FailStacks”
---
Forgot to mention I was on pc 
---
When i once tried it, we got the hatch open, 2 jumped in, third got stuck like halfway jumping in the hatch and couldnt move and the hatch closed and the 2 were left to open the gates xD the good old days with all kinds of bugs
---
Watch the original.
---
Real men use one blink Nurse on console.
---
What I love about being a console nurse is that people will believe your gonna be bad but then all that hard work comes out
---
I know, this is a huge issues that just ruins the game and any potential it can ever have to create memorable matches, full of intensity, sweet victories and bittersweet loss, since they have restricted themselves with not only creating those killers, but doing nothing about them for so long. Now i am not saying nerf them, that is an easy solution for sure, but they need to look at the bigger picture imo and that is the maps. The top killers need to be a force to be reckoned with sure, but not unfair due to them getting a good map selection (Nurse is just too overbearing on The Game for example) or in the other hand, getting severely crippled by bad map design. To add to this, maps that benefit these monsters make the game more playable for the weaker killers, while maps that manage to cripple the two just outright kill weaker killers in most cases and that is not fair. My idea to this is killer dynamic maps, the game takes into consideration the killer you go up against and makes suitable changes to it for both sides to take advantage of. You got Huntress? Cool, the map now creates more openings in loops for a good Huntress to snipe through while also creating some more rng placed objects to hide behind in a chase to avoid hatchets and some other areas of the map leave you exposed if you are caught off guard and also allow for easier far away snipes, also a lot of the loops are now shorter so they can't overly abuse her slow movement speed. Wraith? The map now by default spawns more fog and some additional objects/structures are placed in a such a way to give better cover to an approaching Wraith, some loops are now punishable by correct use of the speed boost from his power.
---
Or how about no hatches? (Satire in a sense) 
---
Could save em for the new Survivor/Killer coming in  a few weeks too.

ooh I don't know. i would say no intuitively, but I'm not well informed at all on that topic. i also don't have any licensed characters unlocked; but maybe someone who knows better than me knows the answer!
---
Thanks gonna give it a try :)
---
Funny
---
&gt;The hag 
---
&gt;the slag*
---
This. PedOchido
---
Depends on the survivor, some I imagine (like Dwight) would try to explain where he was for X time and be declared insane while others would just try to move on and have the constant nightmares affecting them.
---
I use;
---
* Make Your Choice (since I like going for the savior)
---
* Ruin (To slow the game down, just a little bit)
---
* Barbecue and Chili
---
* Nurse's Calling (Let's me spot people who heal in my terror radius for surprise attacks)
---
Sometimes I use Sloppy Butcher instead of Nurse's Calling. Sometimes even Franklin's Demise.. Depends on my mood. 
---
&gt;Age has nothing to do with having repsect
---
True, but it's most common that younger individuals show less respect.
---
Congrats! I'm trying to do it too, got 8 trophies left! 
---
Did you seriously call Remember Me and Blood Warden crutch perks. They both only have one function. If you don’t make it to endgame, they’re worthless. If they happen to work, the perk simply did it’s job. 
---
Well no duh. You get it from the main company that owns the franchise lol. And games dont always buy the licence, look at f13thegame. They were given the rights to use Jason.
---
100% completion gang rise up
---
Wow, what a bunch of crybaby quitters. Can't stand people who quit after they're downed.
---
It doesn't fit her character. Shes a depressed widow destroyed by her husbands death. There's no way she could ever love someone else. 
---
That sounds great! Why is this not already a thing?
---
Only 2 perks:
---
No mither &amp; Object of obsession
---
dunno if they are jelly or just a troll, their comment lost their value at calling this platinum "participation" trophy - like, really. Of course many of base game achivements are those, but there are some you need to actively work for and do your best to have a chance at them. No way anyone just playing the game without putting much thought strictly into getting achvement can get the platinum in this game.
---
Congrats on the achiv, it definitely is a long and hard road to get it and anyone who actually tried to go for it knows perfectly it is something to be proud of.
---
Speaking for myself I am totally jealous lol. Trying my best at achivs both for platinum and 100% but I got stuck at the hardest (nurse stuff, evil incarnate) or grindiest ones (like 125 pig traps or hillbily downs).
---
Spirit: BBQ, Ruin, Make your Choice, Surveillance.
---
Why Surveillance? Simple: put in prayer band addon to phasewalk silent. Go to yellow gens (where people are rn) and grab then off. Gg ez :)
---
People seem to forget the biggest thing working against most licensed killers that people beg for. NO FREAKING INTERESTING/VIABLE POWER IDEAS. Scream? Well other than the fact he is boring as sin and would not fit in the Entity's realm (yeah i know Legion is a thing, don't remind me) what would his power be? Phone calls to find your location? And if you can say that with a straight face, then explain how that would not be rivaling the annoyance factor of Legion and Doctor and also not be completely unviable at the same time? Imagination is good and all, but too many people try to pass unviable ideas as something good for the game in order to see their favorite murdering sweetheart in the game.
---
ohnononoNONONONONO NOT THE BEES OH GOD THERYRE ALL ARE ROUND ME HOLY SHIT RUN
---
Oh, there'd absolutely be counterplay to it, like for every other killer in DBD besides Legion. But I don't agree that an ability like that would be completely useless.
---
So basically you're saying that if the survivor is very good the killer doesn't stand a chance if they have d-strike because time would run out and survivors who face a better killer can't avoid noed. Means: if the survivors are better than the killer, they win.
---
And if the killer is better than the survivors he wins.
---
This is how this game is supposed to work.
---
If a killer is so good that survivors don't even find the time to do totems, the killer a) deserves to get his noed since he has protected all his totems and b) most probably won't even need noed because such a match usually doesn't even reach the endgame stage where all gens are done.
---
And if a survivor is extremely good at kiting and uses a perk slot for decisive to do this even longer he should also be rewarded for his skills and his risky playstyle.
---
The whole game is based on rewards and punishments and pretty balanced to me. 
---
Both parties can avoid dealing with those perks (doing totems or juggling) so I do think it's fair.
---
Just my opinion. I respect all opinions😊
---
Thank you, I try :)
---
Leatherface players do seem to be the shittiest people in RL, yeah. They all have little man syndrome or something, despite the fact LF does surprisingly well at high ranks.
---
This could be due to killer lag!
---
Well if you need any advice on any do drop a message and I'l help out 
---
&gt;My bad, haven't thought that through
---
It's okay, no need to get so apologetic. Chill
---
I wish grass didn't take 80% of my screen.
---
How dares he to break the unspoken survtards rules!
---
Absolute unit
---
If only Wraith were a bit more viable
---
I would like a killer that incentivises the survivors to turn on each other (The Pig kinda does that, but not really), but I feel like with this, the Servents could just NOT attack people and go get cured.
---
Ah, alright
---
Tunneling is only excusable when you know for sure that one toxic cunt will die next hook or dying light will prock
---
Ok but don't compalin about gem rushing then
---
lol Naruto Running Wraith. I'm hoping to continue these lil comics.   
---
I may have an official name for them. Doodle by Daylight. How's that sound?
---
Maybe we could do something like ifvyou dint gwt cured in a certain amount of time you die like with the pig traps
---
Well some perks were made a long time ago and suffer from the small percentage idea, Leader (before the rework), Resilience and so on. My guess is that in the older days they wanted to put emphasis on the tiers of the perk and how important they are (that is why old spies from the shadows had a 25% chance to work in 12 meter range) and hoped that getting a higher tier perk would be more rewarding.Now some perks that always had small numbers also boosted some effects that could be game breaking at higher values, we saw that with unrelenting when it was buffed and ended up being part of the "machine gun" builds. Other than that, i think the devs had a different idea for their game at the start, they might have meant for it to be slower and the perks you got only helped slightly, so your skills would be the thing to carry you through at the end and not a high number on a perk.
---
Ooh I see what youre getting at now. I thought you meant the Drake pictures were in the wrong order 
---
Blinding a killer ever is generally dumb. Leatherface can camp sure. Why would you ever be on a gen when leatherface has a normal terror radius, if its not safe you get off it if it is safe you can leave when he gets closer
---
Or when someone fucks up your deliverance and you fuck up ds. Willpower of gods is needed to not dc
---
I was tired when replying I replied to the wrong name lol
---
I dont think dead hard can be called a crutch because its completely broken at the moment. Half the time you use it youll still get downed AND exhausted 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aqv12x/just_clean_totems_to_avoid_noed/egis74y/?context=3
---
From this time on, I just copy this everytime someone says clean totems to counter noed.
---
\*laughs in locker\*
---
Tommy Wiseau survivor confirmed?
---
What's the deal with that bee?
---
I feel like the Spirit one of the few characters who doesn't need the Spirit Fury/Enduring combo, or at least doesn't as much out of it than other killers. Because she is so hood at chasing people down and performing mind games to trick survivors at loops  she doesn't really have issue with getting hit, and even then can just play around the pallet.
---
Oh no, that would just be silly haha
---
What
---
Yup, especially after that x2 BP weekend about a month or two ago.   
---
So many ultra rare items in my inventory. 
---
sad part is i would proudly run that perk
---
Gotta reinforce that us vs them mentality. 
---
maybe you made a convincing and fair argument there, but your punctuation and grammar is so bad I can't bring myself to read it. 
---
WHAT?! SPEAK UP
---
Never rage quit a game, sometimes you're gonna get shafted by a killer you don't like or a bad spawn that's not a reason to dick over everybody not in your position. At the end of the day you're all there to have fun in DbD and just because you've not had fun that match doesn't mean you have any right to make sure others don't have fun too.
---
Yep I know this I’m horrible at English 
---
Camping is the optimal strategy imo when two survivor clowns start dancing around the hook and little to no objectives are being done around the map. When this happens, that hook is THE MOST important objective. I'd easily trade one gen and a half for a sacrifice+the chase points from being around the clowns and the potential to get a hit or two on them. Three survivors doing nothing at any given time are no doubt a great scenario for the killer.
---
My favorite is when they try to rescue the guy in front of me and I interrupt and slug them. Happens more often than it should.
---
Survivors who complain around camping are 1) bitching even though they won, if  they did their job right or 2) bitching because they can't play the game properly and prefer to start a dance party around the hook than to pressure objectives.
---
Lol I got fuck all from that event. Mostly rares and an ebony mori or two 
---
Tunnelling is fair game, it’s up to the saved survivor to run away efficiently or for the other survivors to take hits etc. It’s a bit of a dick move cos it’s almost inevitable the killer will get the survivor hooked again, but you can’t expect the killer to *not* go for an injured over a healthy survivor. 
---
But camping is an inherently bad tactic employed by bad killers. The only time it is the valid play is if the exit gates are powered, and you can’t get mad at that if you’re a survivor. I don’t get how people can actually camp when there’s gens left, especially baby killers who facecamp the first person they get down with 5 gens left. It makes it an unfun clock simulator for 5/5 players in that game. If you do that then you deserve the toxic post game chat that you’ll inevitably get. 
---
I was expecting them to complain about it in the chat.
---
LOOSE
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/apsu5o/we_know_who_the_new_killer_is/
---
Can you please tell me what so bad about it?
---
I like how in the original Bee post I suggested that someone show it to Mcote, and he responded from his official Reddit account a few moments later and his comment currently has even more upvotes than the post itself. 
---
For Spirit - Nurse's Calling is a must.
---
The Entity horsing around.
---
I wouldn't exactly call it slim. More than half the killers I play against turn out to be running NOED. Whether they get to use it varies on the match but I see it all the time.
---
This is what I came to see.
---
Oooookaaaaay.....
---
Tommy &lt;3
---
When the Legacy guy joins in and you just stand there looking at him with your bloody jacket.
---
Wait, people complain about Sprint burst? Why? I don't see it often as killer and as survivor I'll use any of the others
---
Directly in front of the hook, make sure you're not under it
---
If the hex is in an easy to locate place I prefer to leave it for after the gates are powered up so I know where to start searching for that NOED.
---
I mean ideally you're working just as hard to get that last gen done with Adrenaline as you would be without it. No perk is inherently toxic, people can just play them in toxic ways. 90% when my Adrenaline pops it's because I finished the gen myself. Usual scenario is get a gen to almost done, hook rescue and take the hit,  run back and tap the gen and use the speed to reposition. Some people may benefit from it when they did fuck all during the match,  but obviously the fundamental issue there is them being a bad team mate, not the perk.
---
I think it's pretty possible. It's a game full of horror movie characters and such and Dead Meat made videos about those movies.
---
I play as Waldo.
---
Or just let the survivor get the hatch if they beat you there and move on with your life....
---
Glad you learned something from me
---
Why do you feel like you have to white knight him ? We hate him because he is a piece of shit and because of the cultists like you going on fucking witch huntvto defend your master
---
now you can also hide in a locker!
---
Look at the votes of your previous comment, they speak for themselves.
---
You can restart and dont loose anything.
---
But its really annoying
---
I do not disagree at all, the idea of addons had escaped my mind at the moment and they have shown how well they can design addons that change killer powers and give new strategies. It's unfortunate how few there are though. The true game changing addons i can think off right now are Michael's mirros that add aura reading and allowing for a better use of his smaller TR ( i will not include his  mori on demand addons since i think they border on overkill when used right and they change next to nothing in his strategy, but they are fun to use). The next best addons are the Wraith ones, these are fantastic and add variety to his arsenal, nothing game changing but still a great addition.Then we have the rest of the killers that have some ideas for game changing addons, but either have huge drawbacks or are not fleshed out enough, like the Hag's Scarred Hand and Waterlogged Shoe. And then we have the lazy addons design of having addons that just get progressively stronger with their rarity increasing (most of the Legion's addons are like this and it blows), this not only reduces your ability to balance a killer, since you have given too many things for yourself to factor in when changing them, but also lead to bullshit one-sided addons that just benefit the killer that has patients, like Red-heads Finger (not arguing all good addons need to entertain survivors, but why do the exact opposite?). The best thing they can do is go over all killer addons (like they had promised a long freaking time ago), from there they can see what the killer needs. They have parts of their power that could use a little boost? Give them low rarity addons that have a big impact on specific parts of their power (like Pig's pre change combat straps) and then work on the higher tier addons boosting the more powerful/interesting part of their kit but in order to use them they obviously have to part with their lower tier addons that boost a reliable part of their power for a new way to play and use that power.
---
I was only using it as an example 
---
Get bbq first so you can get the bloodpoint bonus and get your other perks quicker. Then get ruin, enduring, m&amp;a(m&amp;a is in the shrine for 2000 shards until tuesday).  
---
  
---
Get out of evil within 1 as quick as possible. Get evil within 3 to 99% and don't pop it until you're right behind a healthy survivor that you're guaranteed to hit. If you saw another survivor in that chase, try to down them before picking up the 1st downed survivor
---
Oh I thought you had a moment where someone actually complained about Sprint burst, that's why I was so confused because it's not overpowered at all in my opinion
---
why is my name lisa...
---
Scrap Gideon and you got it. 
---
ctrl+alt+del &gt; task manager &gt; close app  
---
It's been like that since they released the Legion DLC.
---
Ik, I forgot to read that chapter of the rule book!
---
self-care is a very touchy subject because in solo queue, relying on others is very disappointing.
---
Damn. haha, maybe you're the ultra rare item in the scenario, b/c everyone I know has an inventory full of high quality items. 
---
I'm sick of seeing this HD brainlet wojak image. I'm sick of seeing wojaks in general. stop posting frogs and wojaks.
---
Well, the sexual harassment was a big no no.
---
That's cause he is, look at Trapper holding him back.
---
Interesting if they said Gordon was dead around part 4, because if you notice in II when the man watches the key being planted behind his eye, you never see the surgeon’s face *and* he walks with a noticeable limp. A happy coincidence or planned?
---
The Gordon reveal in 7 is what made that movie for me. It was a reveal that made a ton of sense.
---
This movie is why I was so excited when the Hag’s red dress cosmetic came out.
---
I AM ABSOLUTELY SICK OF WAITING 30 MINUTES JUST TO BE PUT IN A GAME WHERE HALF OF THE LOBBY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DISCONNECTS.
---
The entities light strays further away from us everyday
---
No Jingle bells ?
---
Come on, they're 90s kids. It would be fat free frozen yogurt 
---
Could be DLC
---
You can get pretty strong builds for killers and survivor without buying a single DLC. So maybe get base game first, see if this is a game you'll put tons of hours into, and then decide on DLC?
---
Nice. Honestly thought he was just pretending to be afk.
---
Hey you're right. And now that you mention it, people can't ring a bell to turn invisible in real life... Something about these characters doesn't add up.
---
3) complaining about camping after the exits were opened
---
4) angry because they had no chance because the leatherface kept camping the hook even tough their teammates were all doing gens and while everyone else had an easy escape, they got a depip for only being on the hook. 
---
I feel like if the killer is within a certain radius of the hook and there are no teammates within that radius that the survivor that got hooked should get extra points. I mean, the killer already loses points for this, but giving the survivor extra points instead would have been nice
---
But that toolkit, left all alone.
---
You sound like you're from antique road show

Spirit i run spirit fury enduring haunted grounds and ruin. For huntress i run bbq whispers nurses and whatever perk i want to run
---
well look at the premise of the game, its all about torture, for the characters on screen to the person(you)controlling them...no one can escape the Entity touch.  He enjoys watching you get tilted and raging haha
---
As far as I know, then you buy base game you have only 3 characters. And they're look very boring
---
Yes but what about those perks the other side uses? I'm so sick of this sub being full of the other mains.
---
Then you're not getting your present.
---
Yes oink
---
&gt; pug
---
😂
---
All your reasons are agreeable but I just think that Sprint burst isn't that game changing
---
I bet you're the kind of customer to send a salad back because it isn't cooked enough.
---
*blushes*
---
I THINK NOT
---
2 ways: 
---
1) Buy Leatherface DLC, level up Leatherface to level 35, buy teachable version of BBQ&amp;C from his bloodweb, level up Pig until you get BBQ in her bloodweb
---
2) Wait (no one knows for how long) until BBQ is in Shrine of Secrets, buy it there, level up Pig until you get BBQ in her bloodweb
---
If you wanted "Barbecue and Chili", you could get it in two different ways.
---
The slow way is waiting for it to be in the Shrine of Secrets, which is a screen in which you can buy perks with the blue shards. However, the perks that appear there are random and only 4.
---
If you want to do it by buying DLC, you'd have to buy the chapter of the character that owns that perk. In this case, it would be Leatherface. After you buy him, you have to level him up until you can purchase it as a teachable, which will look like an orange perk (they appear at levels 35, 40 and 45). Once you have bought the teachable, other killers will be able to get that perk on their bloodweb.
---
Hope that helps!
---
As a wraith/trapper main I'm gonna have to disagree here. It's why the built windstorm into wraiths base-kit. It works against any killer but hard counters ambush killers. 
---
&gt;Dead hard
---
&gt;Reliable
---
Good one.
---
Ruin really isn’t a crutch perk... the totem is so easy to find and it’s understandable to use, especially if you’re new at killer, so idk why survivors would even complain about it. Though I have started to find perk builds that don’t require ruin. Of all killers tho, it is almost required for Myers to have ruin because it takes so long to get out of tier one
---
On PC you get Wraith, Billy, Trapper, Nurse, Huntress.
---
He would probably voice the killer grunts and hum a song for the terror radius. Nick Cage just loves doing stuff.
---
if you get that perk on the shrine, you don’t need to get the doc to 35
---
Gone by Daylight?
---
Ye, absolutely. Thanks!
---
Leaked Thanos DLC?
---
my build is DS, DH, Adrenaline and Borrowed. perks are just what they are... perks. you can use whatever it fits your gameplay better. i like to get chased , i like to keep the killer busy while people work gens, and the build suits that. killers cry about ds ALL THE TIME, while running NOED purple add ons and ebony moris as well. it's just how it goes, when people don't get their way , they cry. most of us can't say they haven't done the same tbf, i know i do on a regular basis.
---
prob afk
---
Good luck playing on LTE dude, even with dedicated servers i can’t see it running any less than 300 ping
---
My question is why? Seems like a waste of time, and the survivor ends up getting roughly the same BP anyway, and you could be in another game. Or at least looking for one.
---
it will show up like any perk will. it could be in your next blood web or after the next twenty.
---
Clown OP?  Now thats funny 
---
NAY
---
How about we pass the time with a game of Komi?
---
It’s pretty ridiculous. Had a Claudette that got salty with me in one match as Clown, got matched with her immediately again while playing Spirit, and she D/C’d the exact moment I popped out of haunting because I heard her healing and downed her. This wasn’t even a full 2 minutes into the game.
---
That clown is a spy!
---
I love using that rainbow sweater from the charit case for meg. It’s so obnoxious it makes escaping at high ranks so much sweeter.
---
depends how you use him. when i first used him i enjoyed the idea of being able to stop loops and i used it fairly well and usually got 3k games. but then i started to play the shape and well...that’s about that. 
---
It's called a butterfly knife cause it's pretty?
---
Or maybe he named it Butterfly?
---
I dunno
---
When you buy a perk from the shrine, it is immediately added to your perks that can appear on any killer bloodweb. You can confirm it by selecting the doctor, open the character info, and you'll see a check mark next to the unlocked teachable
---
Anti looper clown is the best thing ever.
---
Ok, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you!
---
It's underrated as hell.
---
Very strong, especially if you throw Q&amp;Q in the mix. I also like to run lightweight or urban with it as well. Disappearing is my favourite magic trick :P.
---
Also it letting you heal potentially prevents you being hooked or at least makes it take longer, meaning all the other 3 people don’t all leave their generators as soon/at all to come save your sorry ass. Self care is a great perk if you think about the bigger picture. 
---
Ace is best survivor ever
---
Everyone not voting wraith,
---
Bing Bong your opinion is wrong
---
We have a discord?
---
Wooden Horse - it's a common Nurse add-on that slightly increases blink range.
---
Upper mid-tier I'd say, below the top 5 tho.
---
I kind of fell the Clown is possible one of the worst killers in the game.  His power doesnt help slow the game down at all, he has lousy map control and its all that effective at loops as much as you think it would.  Ive play as clown a lot and against him, if you want a killer who can stop loops Hag is 1000x better. Plus she is shorter and can mind game better at loops as well
---
Now hold on, I think you're on to something here, *I don't think could teleport in real life either!*
---
Literally this.  It like works in the opposite way though because you get killers who just tunnel anyone with DS making your experience not a fun one. 
---
i 'member 
---
&gt;Botany doesn't affect Self Care
---
Big brain Pharmacy main
---
Jeff looks like he smells like nutsack and nachos.
---
Sprint Burst is an odd one. It's less controllable than the other Exhaustion perks, but if you're a stealthier survivor that never runs unless you need to, it can really save your bacon in a way that the others can't (at least, as easily).
---
No he's talking about their fictional characteristics and personality, not their fictional powers.
---
Stolen from r/playrust
---
tbh I agree it's just the most "second chance" of the Exhaustion perks. Also whenever I make these memes I always get told that the Exhaustion perk I picked isn't good and that I should've mentioned a different one.
---
Yeah, I've never seen the same character on the logs 4 times, especially not 4 P3 claudettes.
---
aaaaaaah shit
---
Alt's a good re-bind for a lot of action perks, I find.
---
I have a friend who runs both Lithe and Balanced Landing which I guess I understand. What I don't get is running an Exhaustion perk that can always be activated (Dead Hard / Sprint Burst) along with another one since you'll hardly ever have both of them.
---
Seeing how is the actual game policy about make profits and money with original content with a lot of overpriced cosmetics,  I´ll lose any hope about a new licensed killer in a short-mid period... it´s a shame, a lot of people knows about this game thanks to licensed content... I would kill for a Harry Warden licensed killer, furthermore the original movie was Canadian, just like the studio who created DBD.
---
You forgot Hex: Cuck :) 
---
If he is low tier now, then back then it would be an insult to the tier list to even have him no it.
---
The hat maybe. But not really.
---
I've also deducted . . .
---
That, this post right here.
---
Are you ready?
---
*isn't canon.* 
---
BUT IM NOT DONE YET
---
Im pretty sure it's also **fanart** and not anything official.
---
Clown is low-key one of the strongest Killers in the game. He's not on Spirit or Nurse's level, but if you can play him well you can zone survivors like no other. Very underrated IMO.
---
Yes, if its from a different company. Rights shift over alot. Like how F13 part 8 is owned by Paramount and Part 9 is own by New Line
---
If you want the best perks available for the lowest price: Base game + Leatherface. 
---
After that good chapters are Halloween (DStrike), Shattered Bloodline (Spirit Fury) and Flesh &amp; Mud (Ruin), listed in order of strength.
---
When you buy a DLC you can level the characters of said DLC, at levels 30/35/40 a teachable from them can be unlocked.
---
Once the teachable is unlocked it has a chance to appear in other characters bloodwebs.
---
Also since you're new I might as well give you the best leveling order for teachables:
---
Survivor:
---
-David King to 30 for WGLF
---
-Meg to 40 for Adrenaline
---
-David to 35 for Dead Hard
---
-Nea to 30 for Balanced Landing
---
-Laurie to 40 for DS 
---
Killer:
---
Leatherface to 35 for BBQ
---
Hillbilly to 30 for Enduring
---
Spirit to 30 or Nurse to 40 (Spirit Fury or Nurse's Calling)
---
Everything else is just preference, these are the best teachables possible IMO.
---
“Slim chance” hmmmmm
---
Speaking as someone who plays a lot of Wraith and played a lot of Pig during the last event Sprint Burst will stop you from getting a lot of kills. It also increases the speed of the game due to the added mobility (if you have SB you honestly shouldn't be saving it. If you want to save it take Lithe or Balanced). It's the most powerful of the Exhaustion perks and the only reason not to take it is if you're worried about consistency. It's also the only Exhaustion perk that I think is seriously worth leveling up to level 3 over other Exhaustion perks, as all Exhaustion perks work the same and when you have a mid-chase activation you won't really need the low cooldown. But using SB for mobility the lower CD really helps.
---
You can, but you first have to put your points from the Pig games to Leatherface until it unlocks.
---
I literally said my opinion on the topic, right after the grammar correction. 
---
Billy and Nurse are honestly two of the least interesting Killers for me. Yeah, they're strong, but they're not fun. Give me a bit of Hag or Trapper - or even Doctor - any day.
---
The hairstyle?
---
Theres too many variables in play to make this viable. What if the gens are nearby, how close is "too close", some killers can cover way more ground, etc.
---
I kinda love watching people argue in this subreddit about whose the worst blah blah blah , but at the end of the day they both have fucking annoying perks you just gotta accept that.
---
My bad on the error Chief, sorry you got downvoted.

Doctor is still inarguably exactly mid-tier or lower
---
But, I don't think escape should be literally impossible. When used with "Mad Grit", there is nothing you can do to stop someone hooking someone, and that would be seriously overpowered. I don't wanna be that guy, but you sound pretty sore, probably due to being pallet stunned and blinded when carrying someone. To prevent being blinded, theres already Lightborn, and I don't think we need any other perk besides that.
---
If you have we're gonna live forever its 1200 now thats alotta points
---
I main survivor and yes, it can be frustrating when killers camp, but I kinda get it too because survivors can be little shits with their tea bagging/taunting and all I'm trying to do is get my fucking killer ritual done and be on my way. 
---
understandable have a good day
---
I mean, if someone is going to intentionally camp, they're going to play Leatherface because he's objectively the best at it.
---
Camping has been proven to only be a valid strategy against people with brain damage. That being said I've never understood the notion that tunneling is somehow bad. It's not fun for the person being tunneled but objectively you should go for the target with less health, right? This means the person who is injured (obviously) or the person who's been hooked more. It's not fun to get tunneled I'll admit but from a Killer's perspective it makes the most mathematical sense.
---
So just stick all the people who Dodge and DC repeatedly in the same pool, WINNING
---
Got em
---
Hey I didn't give you permission to post gameplay footage of me. ~~Well I don't have those Trapper cosmetics lol.~~
---
Its always a loud laugh for me quickly followed with sadness becasue other survivors didnt deserve this.
---
Here you go, Susie has severe butt face though

From a gameplay standpoint this game is dumb and if you hold the game pseudo-hostage you'll be more likely to get a good gatekeeper emblem.
---
As for social reasons? Salt, mainly. I do this on occasion and it's mainly when I had a really trash game or set of games and am just sick of Survivors' shit. I know holding down Mouse 1 isn't that hard but sometimes I just want to be bitter and make the potato who was hiding in a locker all game do skill checks for once in their fucking life.
---
Good post....I feel the same way. There are times when I bring Small Game where I plan to do totems, but that plan quickly changes once people start getting hooked and you feel behind in the match. You simply don’t have the time to do it anymore. They need to make much more than just “prevent this perk that might not exist, and here is some chump change BP for your effort”. Bump the base value for totems, and as jentaru said, give an additional bonus to all remaining survivors when the 5th totem is cleansed. Now you have incentivized cleansing, and you won’t be looked at as a big time waster on your time by doing them. Maybe now everyone would actually do at least one, instead of running right passed it.
---
??? i don't think you understand how servers work
---
dedicated servers will make lag happen on *both ends* , so lag switching as a killer, or just being laggy in general, will do nothing except hinder you
---
and, dedicated servers, will make ping stable, compared to player-hosted servers that can lag at any moment because 9 times out of 10 it's running on wi-fi
---
so, yeah, i don't understand this
---
That was so good! :'D
---
I feel attacked.
---
On subject: this meme was posted a lot and then it kinda stopped. I posted my meme to laugh at a really entitled Survivor who called Whispers a crutch (I went for the more belivable alternative though) and it blew up for seemingly no reason.
---
i commented this before earlier in another thread , cleaning totems wastes waaaaay too much time you could be using working gens. the way i go about it is to memorise the location of totems i see, if it does come to a noed game, check them back to find it
---
Yeah tell that to the Rank 17s with Decisive 3, Adred 3, Balanced Landing 3, Self Care 3, and purple toolboxes with Brand New Parts.
---
you can spend the bloodpoints you earn from playing the pig on leatherface by switching to leatherface and accessing his bloodweb after a match
---
Nurses calling with M&amp;A is pretty damn good 
---
I had someone say hillbilly’s chainsaw was a crutch and said that he rather me use noed
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aqs9eq/going_to_be_playing_basement_defender_for_a_bit/
---
It will be great because everyone will stop bitching about not having them.
---
That’s a bug that was in the game... not a lagswitch and the chat looks more like they are being sarcastic and laughing at you for saying you were lagswitching. 
---
Who is top and who is bottom?
---
Ugh they need to sort that out -.-
---
Oh I was stood up? :s
---
I would be an intersting combination but i fell like nurse s would not be so good on the hag
---
Because it's 2019 and we're aiming to become LoL's Sidekick in Toxicity.
---
I thought you meant looping endlessly is being toxic. My mistake. I just mentioned it because normally when I make an opinion that’s pro one side, someone will always be like “well you don’t know what it’s like to be a killer!”
---
It's like i'm staring right at her
---
The wraith and Freddy ones will be great too!
---
Doesn't feel the same to be honest. I always have harder times landing normal hits with Hag, Legion, Huntress, and Spirit. Slower to get into lunge range is understandable, they move slower so it takes more time to run someone down. But slow Killers always have the highest odds to miss an attack for me and jukes/360s seem to work much better against slow Killers as well. In my personal gameplay and in random videos, slow Killers tend to be the ones with more difficulty to land lunge hits. 
---
It's part to why I don't really like slower Killers. They overly depend on their power and when (not if, when) that fails them for what ever reason, they have almost nothing to fall back on. If you get a bad map or can't get good use of your power, slow Killers just suck.
---
I know that lunge speeds are suppose to be normalized. But I just don't trust that from how often things bug out or are left to be broken for months at a time.
---
Look at Prestige for example. That is suppose to give better odds of higher rarity items in bloodwebs. Says that even in game in the prestige confirm screen. Doesn't do jack shit and hasn't since the game launched. The only reason to prestige someone outside of a cosmetic has NEVER worked, and yet Im to trust lunge speeds/distances are normalized even though slow Killers are the most prone to misses, jukes, 360s well after that change.
---
Dedicated servers will allow more players from all over the world to play the game, that's a huge plus imo
---
michael really has a snowball effect, most of my games there was 1-2 gens left, a good tip is to not worry about how many gens are left, keep a few gens unrepaired that are close to eachother so in the end-game it'll be hard to repair them.
---
I do them if I come across them in my search for a generator. I feel like it's a good strategy but sometimes if my teammates are awful or the killer is amazing I'm desperate for that time spent cleansing back, lol
---
The most used NOED killers I come across on PS4 are... Pig, Wraith, and Doctor
---
I don’t think a new player should rock Adrenaline and Dead Hard, as boring as it sounds it’s probably better to get something like Urban Evasion lol. 
---
Survivors still are on skiis after throwinga pallet. Its an obvious kbown bug but its been in the game since legion came out
---
The higher rarity only really effects the spawn rate of brown items
---
Spirit: Sloppy butcher, hex: ruin, bbq and nurse´s calling/thanathobia coming from a red rank spirit
---
Bloodweb by Vermin Supreme
---
No it's not, it may sound good on paper, BUT if you just keep Urban Evading around the map you will both be a hindrance to your team and will not actually get better at the game.
---
I love playing trapper when I play killer. Then having the advantage of playing survivor also. Knowing where survivors are anticipating traps makes it so fun. I place traps in places that I would never expect them as survivor and usually they either they step in it or I can lead the chase that way so they step in it.
---
I got all 4 survivors give me a gg the other day because my trap placement was so random.
---
no, no you're not
---
I wonder who was he going up against?
---
How am I not?
---
A fellow whore.
---
Nurse -100FPS that’s all you need to know
---
Survivors when the Dwight finally comes out of the locker to heal you, but misses 2 skill checks.
---
Like I said: the killer already gets a penalty: if he is within 8 meters of a hook, he loses points. You could do the same but instead of punishing the killer, you reward the survivors.
---
Encouragement often has better effects than discouragement
---
Hags a great killer on console
---
Last night I had a Quentin let both of his teammates died on the hook over a totem... He was in the dream world during all of this too.
---
What is NOED short for? 
---
Hex: No One Escapes Death. A crutch killer perk.
---
nurse isnt as good on console as she is on pc.
---
It'll allow you to keep swf lobbies even after the game which is reason enough to be excited 
---
Ty. Would you say that's worse for survivors than like Hex Ruin. Because I feel like Hex Ruin just forces me to spend the first ten minutes of a match looking for a totem. 
---
No your drawing is completely fine I have nothing against it, it's cute. I don't even mind the ship, my problem is when people say it's completely viable or that it's fine because the devs are making it canon when it actually isn't. 
---
Personally I ship the Doctor and Freddy which I know is a massive crack ship and would never be viable but if the devs made it canon I would be very very confused because it just doesn't make sense, just like Nurse x Wraith. 
---
Can’t wait for Dwight’s.....it’s going to be a locker
---
I agree
---
camping sucks ass but its much more effective to make the killer waste their time camping one person while everyone else does generators 
---
I know how servers work. I was just trying to make a joke, mainly because I think the servers would make connections the same or at most a little bit better. I could be wrong tho, and it is a meme pls dont hurt me ;.;
---
Seriously it's like an addiction lmao
---
Dedicated will allow many things and fix a lot. Dead hard will be fixed. Hits that shouldnt have been hits will be fixed. SWF keep their group. More game modes like 8v2 or more. So yes dedicated servers will do a lot to this game
---
I know they said they would never, but if they did add the creeper, I would probably just stop playing the game. Not going to support anything that a pedofile contributed to, fuck that.
---
He's one dreamy guy
---
kicking a gen and targeting a survivor to force them out of the game early are 2 different things 
---
Well, issue is that hiding is not what devs want, they want interaction between survivor and killer. Have to admit a 4 man claudette immersed is quite annoying.
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury, NOED and Remember Me/Blood Warden 
---
People are a lot more brave when they have their buddies to back them up. And a lot more likely to win when they are cheating. Its a very bad combo for toxicity.
---
I had a leatherface who was going to let us farm after the toxic flashlight ds user dced on first down. However, he hooked two of us close and chased the immersed claudette even ran away from her so she could unhook however we killed ourselves because it just looked like he was camping. Jsy hitting survivors on hook is not the same as hitting a gen to show you want to farm.
---
Dead 
---
Hi, OchiDO, nice to meet you. Not really, but still.
---
I wish I still had the recording but on PS4 I was the last survivor with a wraith. The hatch was inbetween two cars so the wraith was patrolling it. I started doing gens. On the last gen the wraith came after me got a hit on me but I managed to escape through the hatch! It took like 15 minutes because after every gen I would hide to see if the wraith would move
---
He’s still not really that bad, and quite frankly the framerate issues aren’t even that bad.
---
They all have something bad about them, I can see why that'd happen.
---
DH is what I've said already.
---
Balanced landing requires a decent map, if you get sheltered woods or rotten fields then you are pretty restricted.
---
Sprint burst forces you to walk around everywhere which wastes time.
---
Lithe is buggy af. and somewhat situational.
---
\*chokes on bill millers chicken\*
---
Nurse is #1 killer, Billy is either #2 or #3 and Huntress is #4 so you get pretty much the best killers with the base game
---
You are all rigt boah 
---
The "to me" in the first sentence is unneeded, and what should be what's (what is) the point of (of is better than in here) the hatch. 
---
So your first sentence should be What's (or what is) the point of the hatch? 
---
In the second sentence "it" needs to be contracted to "it's" or followed by an "is" and then an "a" so you have "It is a reward for bad teamwork" after teamwork you should have a comma.
---
After that I'm not even sure what point you're trying to convey so I'm not sure how to fix it.
---
As irritating as it is for survivors, the Frank's Mixtape add-on is probably the easiest way to go about this. Also, run discordance or some other tracking perk so you can go to groups of people. 
---
In general, if you don't run that add on, find groups of people, hit one, hit a different one to refill your meter, and then return to the first you hit, which should hopefully be enough to down them. 
---
Oh lol
---
I’ve been using detectives hunch for it, and it’s come in handy so much. If you do a middle gen, you pretty much know where all the totems are and NOED won’t stand a chance
---
What's wrong with Wraiths :'(
---
1. Flashlights aren't as good as they once were but are still useful.
---
2. Bodyblocking has no downsides if the killer doesn't have Mad Grit or Sloppy Butcher if you have 2-3 people around, as the killer can only chase one person and the rest can heal.
---
3. Breaking hooks can be done while the killer is in a chase with another survivor, and then you can just bust it when the killer is walking to the hook
---
4. Spamming notifications is not gonna make me chase you. I never chase the person that wants to be chase. All that happens is I do my current chase with BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM going on in the background.
---
5. Max immersion when the whole team is doing it is absolute cancer. I don't run spies or whispers.
---
6. I once had a SWF wait 25 minutes after the gates were up because they wanted to t-bag. 
---
With the exception of Spirit all other killers do show their problems when facing against a good SWF squad. There's a reason for the stale meta at high ranks. 
---
Doctor causes a lot of lag for both killer and survivors. As some mentioned, Nurse isn't great. Slower, more methodical killers like Hag, Trapper, and Myers all work well on console. 
---
Ok thank and sorry even if my first language is English I’m bad at punctuation and grammar so I’m sorry I’ve never use that much punctuation 
---
Well, camping has never ruined my experience. See how easy that is?
---
Running both Ruin and Huntress' Lullaby has worked well for me, given that the totems last longer than 10 seconds. With Lullaby, it's harder to hit great skillchecks as you're given less notice that a skillcheck is coming, or no notice at all, assuming you can get the 5 stacks.
---
As for the addon, I'm almost certain it only applies when you're out of hatchets, so once you're familiar with the maps and where lockers spawn, it'll probably be a useless addon.
---
Holy shit I actually didn't expect you to respond, but dang that hurts I was hoping to get some pig cosmetics for my birthday
---
Yeah I wouldnt use noed. Hag is already strong she doesnt need noed. Id advise bbq/nurses/brutal strength can be okay. Haunted grounds with ruin is nice. Whispers is a really good perk. If you do mint rag and rusty shackles i would use thrill/haunted grounds/devour hope/ruin. And trap every totem. Thats a really fun build. 
---
Especially when they're a Claudette with Urban Evasion and the hatch hasnt even spawned. I swear I get them every now and then, and they drag games on for at least 20 minutes longer than they should be, not to mention that they're never doung gens to start with.
---
Heavy Smoker Nurse is God
---
1. This is a matter of preference for most. Personally, I think Huntress Lullaby is underrated, but at the same time, ruin takes effect instantly. Lullaby you have to work for it, but the generators alert survivors that lullaby exists before it even takes effect, so they know to look at it. In general, ruin is usually better though.
---
2. It shows lockers ever when you're not out of hatchets, so it allows you to reload when you're only missing one or two hatchets. Personally, there's far better add-ons, since it's usually not hard to guess where lockers spawn anyway.
---
I see she's a fan of red light, green light.
---
Omg that sounds amazing. Its a clever name. I always chuckle when i see these posts. They are really good!
---
There's multiple videos of people trying to defend him too. 
---
🅱️ee
---
Spirit is the most fun killer and no one can convince me otherwise.
---
Billy is the most viable on console 
---
Why not just learn to use Billy with his faster saw?
---
Doc is still the second or third worst killer without addons.
---
He's so underrated. Sure, he doesn't have the best map pressure, but his ability to end chases is probably one of the best in the game. Run a good tracking perk + anti-looping/anti-pallet perks and so long as you're constantly on someone, chases will end fast and you win. I don't play him all too often, but boy do I hate going against a good clown. 
---
It's actually pretty decent. She already has a smaller terror radius, add on M&amp;A and you can get pretty close before they hear you, giving them less time to get to a pallet.
---
r/dbdLFG
---
This combo is my favorite. Plus, always disrespecting pallets means a lot of hits that I normally wouldn't get because I used to respect the heck out of 'em. 
---
At the moment i fell like noed is usless . It can be extremly clucth but most of the time i kill all survivirs before all generators are repaired and when they actually repair them the totem gets destroyed real fast and i basicly played with only 3 perks . Anyway , thanks for the reply
---
Ruin isn’t shit. I play at the high ranks. I almost always prefer lullaby over Ruin. With ruin, the downfall is that survivors will have immediate urgency to get rid of it, but they won’t have the same urgency to get rid of lullaby. It is much worse though. Coming from a guy that plays both sides respectively, NOED can completely shake up the game and save it for you.
---
This is like example footage of me playing killer. 
---
Honestly me too, the amount of times I get juked in a match is embarrassing.
---
Yes. In the config file turn off vsync and set your frame limit to whatever you want. 
---
Then you're most likely you unlucky as according to the last time we've seen NOED's usage rate wasn't even close to 20% of the Killers. It was about 14% iirc. But to be fair I forgot if that was for R1 or overall. Sure it might've increased but I personally doubt it went beyond 25% in total.
---
Removed please use r/dbdLFG
---
The Billy is the best one
---
Huntress hatchets are more inconsistent on PS4 than PC afaik. FPS also go down for me when I throw hatchets affecting aim and making her harder to play on consoles.
---
When people unhook somebody and do nothing to protect them, it's not tunneling.
---
I dont like this logic because it says, "I got 75%, so I deserve 100%." 
---
Had a clown do this to me yesterday, but I was able to lure him off after a minute or two
---
pallets are glitched since last update, they dont drop when you press r1
---
My favorite Spirit build is more for fun then success (though it actually tends to work very well in most cases.) And it's totem defender. Ruin, Haunted Grounds, Thrill of the Hunt, Devour Hope. Try and snatch people off totems whenever they touch 'em. This is helped by prayer beads. Get them on and you can snatch so many people. It's *great.* 
---
I subscribed to the Youtube channel. Great stuff.
---
Alright buddy, chill out is extremely common so I don't understand the "In what sense" clearly I was telling you to calm the fuck down. You're just playing stupid, or maybe you are.
---
Why Thursday
---
On the flip side, you're the one that dies first because I can see you from across the map.
---
Yah the GO GO Gadget Skates bug will probably never be fixed and I hope they leave it, it’s hilarious every time I see it! 
---
Platform: PS4
---
The loading screen is still doing the lovely infinite loading screen problem. After getting into a lobby and everyone greens up, offerings are burnt, then onto the loading screen that never loads and glitches out. I’m experiencing this 1-2 times a day! Either the game eventually crashes or I’m stuck in limbo until I close the App out and reload. 
---
Also have been noticing allot of rubber banding with different survivors and killers, not the clown or Kate but everyone, it randomly happens, seen fang do this a few times now. 
---
I've played Billy three times. And i quickly returned to my Trapper and Hag. No more Billy, i suck with the chainsaw xD
---
Besides, if they're the first one you see after the unhook, take what you can get. 
---
Some redditor making an attempt at humor.
---
Would you recommend Lullaby if it's at a higher level than Ruin? I already know the strengths and weaknesses of both but I don't know if affecting everyone with Lullaby is better than affecting two people with Ruin.
---
It's quite simple, as Nurse your biggest weakspots are mindgames and stealth (due to her fatigue and very low movement speed).
---
Meaning a map which supports stealth the most will also be the worst maps for Nurse. You've issues to spot Survivors from afar thanks to the stupid 2 metre bushes while you can lose a good Survivor after almost every blink due to Line-Of-Sight blockers being literally everywhere (huge bushes, obstacles, tree's, tile's in general).
---
Happens with discordance too. So if they keep tapping the gen on and off that someone else is working on, I hear that fucking sound.
---
Anything that involves more survivor BP is a plus. The game needs to be way more balanced in that aspect. 
---
I also like it when 2 people are hooked and the only unhooked survivor completes a generator instead of trying to unhook.
---
I cant believe they made P3 claudette a killer in the latest update
---
I mean obviously you're trapping shack window, but I usually try to find as many bottleneck intersections as I can before I start with the "fuck with 'em" traps. To each their own, though - all glory to the Entity.
---
Thanatophobia also encourages this behavior. 
---
tot3mtanz
---
When Victor Salva stops being a pedophile. So never.
---
Id have to disagree mainly because i keep getting moon ping killers. Good effort tho
---
Spirit is my go to for this. I think she’s a little better than the hillbilly with the right addons
---
Of course, nurse is the alpha and omega but she’s really fun to play for me as I’m still learning her
---
Honest question: Why take a picture with your phone instead of taking a screenshot? I mean, this is PC after all.
---
why have I never thought of this
---
Spirit at least has the advantage of being fun to play for some of her mindgames. The other two are just boring. Even against a coordinated SWF, I'd have more fun with Hag, Doctor or Piggy than I would with Billy.
---
Oh okay, thanks for clarifying. Again, please don't play if you're gonna ruin the game for everyone, as soon as you start having a bad day.
---
It doesn't ? Now that's embarassing for my part lol. To be fair I've never really used selfcare to begin with, even at the time when it was still really good in comparasion. If I remember certainly it did before the changes tho.
---
Couldn’t help it was so proud, that’s nothing compared to my full on laugh
---
I don't frequently run it, but I had Iron Maiden on once when a survivor tried this. I imagine it was an unpleasant surprise to hop out the locker and get that little alert, but boy was I *laughing*.
---
And Legion will be the disconnect sign.
---
so yes, we don't need 2 perks that shut down wiggling anymore then it already is.
---
Wouldn't be THE change we're all looking for but definetly a step into the right direction, I like it.
---
If you're running Ruin, try to get Haunted Ground ASAP. M&amp;A probably isn't strictly necessary on Hag - I'd go with a map awareness perk like ANC, Iron Maiden, or Surveillance if I had the choice.
---
Hope is more if you have tier 3, 7% vs 4% for NOED
---
I'm like 85% sure it doesn't. To be honest I haven't tested it, and searching around I've found about a zillion conflicting statements. I've seen videos saying it doesn't and videos saying it does. Threads on Reddit and the SCUD are ping-pong matches of people arguing over if Botany affects Self Care or not. The Wiki says nothing about it so TY Wiki.
---
I honestly have no clue, but regardless I probably wouldn't bother figuring it out since I'm not going to run two perks just to heal myself. Self Care is a backup and I'd rather have my other perks for not getting hit in the first place.
---
The one exception to early game camping: insidious doc pretending to be a hallucination. 
---
Oh. Kk nice- I’m just getting back and grabbing killers for teachables since I stopped playing around when the nurse was the newest killer. There’s so many to grab and I think after the pig she’s next
---
To play and learn 
---
Nurse is the one killer I can't figure out how to play. I would spend more time with her but I just get so irritated trying to figure her out. Every other killer is fine for me though
---
Why is doc so bad? 
---
New Killer?
---
I appreciate your logic but you still have a huge advantage over those without much experience. Not to mention that most survivors want to play the game and not just have a killer hide in the basement all game and let them win, depriving not just 1, but 5 people of a fun game.
---
Secondly, going by your logic, it would be immoral to play as any killer you're adept with when you have deranged and I dont know about you, if I was trying to train Clown, I'd need a game or two as someone else every now and then so as not to get bored. So eventually you'll be playing as a familiar killer at low ranks.
---
I do agree that individual killer ranks is a great idea. But dont think you should take the law into your own hands and deprive survivors of boldness and altruism points because you want to go afk for a bunch of rounds while you derank.
---
I think in all good consciousness, if you cant train your new killer at high ranks (I do sympathise with this as someone who cant play nurse to save my life and is too late to learn) then maybe just play as other killers until rank reset (like the one we just had), and then after reset, when you're at 10 or below, start training from there. Because I'd say rank 10 is low enough for anyone adept at the game to start training any killer.
---
I get that the game has terrible matchmaking and can generally have some pretty annoying flaws, but every player can help improve the community by just playing the game as intended.
---
Doctor+huntress lullaby+ ruin and no one will get gems done
---
Lol so did I actually until I read your post. 
---
There is a glitch where depending how you put your add ons on a new kit it could have less than it’s supposed to. If you have a charge increasing add on in the first slot and a charge decreasing one in the second slot, it will have less than a charge decreasing one in the first slot and an increasing one in the second slot. Not sure if this was intentional.
---
In fairness most internet weirdos who got famous are gonna ask fans for nudes
---
This is me [Rank 1] carrying my SWF group. While I do it I always say "sorry it is a *insert killers name here* they will probably have NOED"
---
don't feel sorry op, your artwork is amazing and I ship this😘 Please draw more sweet things
---
The killer and survivor are 500 each, however if you buy the dlc pack you get both for cheaper if you were wanting to buy both. If you only want one it is cheaper to buy it with 500
---
I'd only double up on Ruin and Lullaby if I were running full Hextress (probably Thrill or Third Seal and Haunted Ground). Otherwise there's too much risk that a survivor hunting Ruin will cleanse Lullaby first, and then you're out two perks.
---
Sounds like you just suck at killer
---
I'm gonna have to re-upload..
---
Its not on the survivor if the killer is just proxy camping and waiting for an unhook. These are the killers that completely ignore you when you try to take a hit so the unhooked guy can get away. Killers who play like this are shit and deserve to be harassed at the exit gate by anyone who escapes
---
There are people who play this game and obsess over a ghost being in a relationship with a pillowcase.
---
I chose the wrong game.
---
Given the timing of this update, the fact that it is applied psuedorandomly, and the nature of what it applies to, I would point to this "new matchmaking system" as the source of the infinite loading screen bug. Behavior, please go over this code with a fine tooth comb.
---
Oh, I see. Thank you!
---
And if bullshit hits are still a thing after the devs will prob try to fix things and no one can say oh it was just lag 
---
Ill be honest... I lose people all the fucking time because of this. Its one of the most disorienting things that happens to a killer... just a "uh... okay well I guess he's gone...."
---
Oh did the devs say this?
---
Hopefully now the gif won't just up and vanish for no reason. (Why would it? It's not NSFW and I do give credit to the original creator of the source who is Harry Patridge btw. And it is even in the proper flair...)

Lol there's a lot of things "we don't need". Go and blame behavior for having the nerve to introduce a third "fuck wiggle"-perk that does more or less the same than the 2 previous perks because they lacked creativity with Mad Grit. It's not like IG and Agitation would've been enough already (warning : sarcasm).
---
But to be honest, there are so much more annoying things than the possibillity to pick a perk and give your carries some more safety. If you actually think it would be too much of an impact the issue doesn't seem to be with the perks lol. IG hasn't changed much except of the stun-thingy. "Oh no, I've to wiggle 4 seconds more instead of 2, since the hook changes all the wiggle I do are so damn close to escaping anyway, that would totally deny my chances" said literally no one ever.
---
But ay, if you actually REALLY think that this would be too OP without any actuall useful reasonings except "We don't need it, that'd be too strong (spoiler : definetly isn't), we already have Lightborn against blinds." (which's actually even ironic considering we're talking about 3 perks here that currently DO THE ABSOLUTELY SAME THING)...You know where the door is.

Jeff!
---
Because I'm an idiot who loves memes and I love stupidly saying 'my name is jeff' whenever I pick him lol
---
Lol
---
The thing is he is week but he will end a chase. It might take an entire gen or two but streamers, (especially more unpopular ones) try to be a toxic ochido fanboy and loop the killer while t-bagging at the pallet.
---
Legion is a problem cause he ignores game mechanics, cheeses chase mechanics, results in boring uninteractive gameplay, has no skill level to play whatsoever and still after all that manages to be a shit killer
---
that's getting a big **h**oof from me
---
I mean he is OP when using the mixtape 
---
Just buy the chapters, the AC deals are basically a scam
---
Mid rank players ragequit a lot. They dont understand the game enough to do well against good players
---
Look, we aren't saying you can avoid NOED just by cleansing totems. We're saying that NOED is a sign of a game that went by quickly, or one where survivors are potentially rushing endgame because of pressure/strategy. When you are a solo survivor, the only strategy used is gen rushing (doing gens as quickly as possible) because that's what everyone agrees on. NOED is specifically made to fight that strategy. It has almost no effect on stealthier squads, aggressive rescue squads, and others. Also, small game is not designed to take you away from the game. Do what I do, I simply play with small game as per usual, and if it triggers, I cleanse. I get about 3 totems this way before all the gens are done, and I don't waste any time looking, just time cleansing. Then if NOED appears (because my team didn't get the other two) a simple tour of the map will give me the last totem, after which I can move in for a save, hopefully.
---
You can evade a nurses by twisting and turning.
---
These Survivors just didn’t do that at all. Haha.
---
&gt;Just play the killer with less perks. You can make rank 1 with any killer without any items or perks.
---
Nice of you to assume ones skills
---
thats why they need to buff him or tweak a bit, at least give 115% movement speed, i think it would improve the killer by a lot, and would make ppl play him in a diferent way, instead of tunneling
---
The Pussy Destroyer
---
This is the most appropriate way to respond to a nurse game.
---
Why would I watch someone else play their own video game while I helplessly run around praying you haven't practiced blinking without any counterplay from me whatsoever(minus breaking LoS/faking directions which won't work long if the nurse has a brain)
---
AFAIK, the devs don't consider that an exploit - just alter your config file to your desired FPS.
---
i think what makes him really annoying is that to play him in a very effective way, you have to tunnel people, and that kinda sucks
---
I just started learning her a couple weeks ago... and its extremely tough but SO WORTH IT.  You're gonna get stomped on for a good 50 games,  but then you start catching people... then killing people... then 4king every game... WHAT IS LOOP?? I SEE SURVIVOR I KILL IT WHO CARES ABOUT LOOP!
---
TGIF
---
A lot of Killers who enjoy the low ranks are probably DCing to keep their ranks low if they're faced with anything resembling a real challenge. 
---
On the other hand, a lot of teen-rank players are probably sick of going up against people who should be playing at red.
---
TLDR no deployment date so dont waste your time reading when they will just release the exact same statement but with more of an idea of official release. 
---
Two wrongs doesnt make a right, talk shit get hit.
---
I dont get how people can be surprised that when you shovel shit on people they might start throwing it back, he only has himself to blame. 
---
if your running a kyf play a peekaboo/tag myers 
---
scratched mirror and boyfriends memo 
---
along with a slug build on larrys or any small map you can hide behind walls and corners
---
I also only ran DS when I first played haven't ran it in a long time. 
---
Thanks man, it means a lot getting help. I play on ps4, but thanks.
---
Even if they were boring, I’d rather be bored than be bullied. 
---
hits the killer with a ds.....
---
noooo i lost all my super mario progress LOL
---
I would like to see some timeouts, like 30 minutes after DCing to often in matches and get longer if you keep doing it.  Im sure they could find a way to track it, other games do it.
---
He isn't "bad". He's mediocre. Pretty low tier. His ability often doesn't help him in chases because of how closely you have to time it to make it actually stop the surv from vaulting/dropping a pallet and getting that extra hit. He isn't bad, it's just that most killers are better.
---
In the hands of a perfect player - he was #2 after Billy in average kill rate and #2 after Legion in points in that 1000 games statistic recently though.
---
Low-tier DS isn't really the problem. If we're talking about balancing DS, we're really talking about DSIII. It's an Obsession perk, so it really *should* be stronger than other perks - but not so much that it's a must-take for survivors. 
---
So how do we balance it? Personally, I'd apply a bleed-out status similar to Borrowed Time. Congratulations, you just stabbed the Killer with a shard of glass or something. Now go and heal because you're bleeding out and the big scary monster is still coming to kill you.
---
But they're playing The Blob...
---
Add BBQ and Iron Maiden and you may just be unstoppable 
---
good point
---
Yes, doing nothing and killing yourself ARE also bad things to do, thanks for the pointless observation. And doubt all you like, but I've never thrown a tantrum and ruined a game for everyone before, no.
---
ahh i can tell you are a OG 2016 player.  DS was nasty as hell back then, DS and escape happened every match it seemed.  
---
larrys 
---
game
---
springfield
---
ormond
---
Or against incredibly altruistic survivor teams. If they’re pulling the dude off the hook five seconds after I hook them, then I’m staying nearby. 
---
Really? Personally I'd rather have a fun but challenging game than a "win" where I'm just bored 85% of the match.
---
Cloudette is having a standoff with MEG for the hatch 
---
\^\_\^ 
---
Precisely. It'd eventually deter killers from camping, since it'd not be valid anymore.
---
But it won't happen anytime soon. Not when survivors beeline for the hooks, expecting free saves.
---
It be like that sometimes lol
---
Trapper for smash
---
Sorry for the long rant, you don’t need to read it.
---
I may be wrong but I think that giving him 115% movement speed would be a bit much. Killers like hillbilly, even though he has insane map pressure and instadowns, can still be pallet looped, but can still do fine by normally pressing m1 and swinging through pallets. He can do that because he has a speed (4.6 m/s) far greater than survivors (4 m/s). While the 110% movement speed (4.4 m/s) May not seem like much of a difference, is much slower the 4.6 m/s. If legion were to be given 115% / 4.6 m/s while also having the ability to ignore pallets, would be almost nurse tier. 
---
It disturbs me how many of you voted for Hag. 
---
I spent all last weekend playing Spirit, and I love her. I thought of myself as a pig main. I played a lot other killers, (I even tried Legion) and billy can’t TOUCH her. I play Xbox 
---
i dont see the problem once its used thats it, unless you run into a 4 man with it lol 
---
Yeah, it is.
---
I am not a Michael player by any means but as I play any killer I typically as soon as a match starts I look at the layout of the gens and pick ones to patrol and some to ignore. The ones I typically ignore are one that are far away from the rest. Doing so these gens will typically get done and make my patrolling mid and late game easier. Ruin is good for any killer to give you a boost in the beginning to slow down gen process and assist you in initiating a chase and maybe getting a few hooks in the process (depending on how long the hex lasts.) As this pushes people to do something other than gens and will also help in locating people when they miss a skill check. Learning how to end chases quickly is crucial. Learning how to push survivors around and to anti loop generic things like jungle gyms, L-wall T-wall, and killer shack helps immensely. Remember the more time you spend chasing someone the more time everyone else has to do gens. BBQ is great perk as it helps with keeping momentum up as a killer and also blood points. I also find surveillance to be really strong locator perk as well. If you find a survivor early on who uses up pallets alot early on, follow them and break as many pallets as you can. This will make it alot easier for you mid late game in your chases. 
---
I like playing jumpscare Myers on The Game with friends.
---
Just a note, you say several times “survivors hate x”. Stop caring about what survivors hate. Survivors hate being killed, but you have to do it anyways. Face camping is one thing, but if you know there’s someone waiting around to unhook someone you’ve just hooked it’s perfectly acceptable to start walking around the immediate area to check for them.
---
Same with tunneling though. As a survivor it sucks, but if the easiest person to get and down is the one freshly unhooked why wouldn’t you go after them? If someone is injured and another uninjured person is trying to get your attention to get you on them instead, why would you switch targets? And of course survivors hate Ruin, but honestly having it is extremely helpful which completely outweighs their opinions.
---
You need to make sure this game is fun for you. Being a “nice” killer when it’s unwarranted (imo multiple D/Cs in-game) will likely decrease your bp gain in the long run if you pass on perks/strategies that work to your benefit. The survivors are the ones who need to be nice to each other and work together. You have no obligation to do so.
---
Just like the killers who use NOED. Lol 
---
^((stares at the t-bagging survivors standing at the gate))
---
Thank you for this post. Solo q is a fucking pain to play these days.
---
Everything except adept nurses
---
I wouldn’t call people who are good at nurse trashcans. People like me are trashcans, I play legion because every other killer requires practice to use his ability
---
“Thanos did exactly what he said he was gonna do”
---
I think it should just fill up the struggle meter a little faster, as a hard counter to Agitation/Iron Grasp. You could run it with Boil Over for some interesting results. 
---
Yup, I been playing a long time. I have to say though, despite the games short comings, I think its currently in the best state its ever been in. I had to put it down for a while because it was just a salt mine, but Ive been having a lot of fun with it lately
---
Lol i think its fine tbh from both sides. U get one chance to hit that skillcheck which isn’t easy imo. Atleast if ur killer is laggy as fuck. Also if u miss its ur loss imo. 
---
well man, thats truth, this is a hard killer to balance, 1 buff and he is nurse tier, 1 nerf and he is freddy, anyway, thanks for the response
---
Probably not since the two other survivors were sacrificed and not killed
---
Np, it’s just kinda annoying to see this game get filled with garbage.
---
PS4 
---
Whenever we are healing, mending, repairing, anything that brings up a progress bar. It will just stop even when we hold down the button. It's very annoying and it wastes time and sometimes it takes a few seconds for the button prompt to come back.
---
Throw on an overcharge and unnerving presence and you will see some sweet sweet DC’s
---
These are actually really good perk suggestions
---
&gt;rather have fun
---
Most people don't have fun being bullied, though. Getting endlessly looped, flashlight macro'd, and teabagged at the exit gates because you couldn't pressure gens and end chases can really start to get to you when you're desire is to rank up.
---
I don't care about rank anymore, so most games I'm just dicking around, and if I lose, I lose. When I was working for the Rank 1 achievements, however, basically feeling powerless to stop a SWF who all know how to optimally loop, and would taunt you on top of it, became irritating.
---
Zzz. 1 time use is too powerful. Killers are so lazy. 
---
Gotta spawn that hatch
---
Ok I’ll answer better. 
---
- Flashlights, easily avoidable, you can get free hits if you fake a pick up. Also someone flashligting you means there’s one less person doing generators.
---
- Bodyblocking, gives you free hits, less people on generators. In the end game, they can clutch an extra escape by bodyplocking the hook, can be annoying but getting one less kill doesn’t ruin my experience and it shouldn’t ruin anyone else’s. 
---
- Breaking hooks, less people on generators, if you can’t get to a hook, just slug them.
---
- Spamming notifications, can be annoying, they can also be used as a distraction, you can just ignore them, doesn’t ruin your experience. 
---
- Immersion, survivor doing their job and you can still find them.
---
- Just chase them out of the gates. 
---
- Swf, yeah the survivors have an advantage but you can still play normally.
---
Camping, literally not letting you play.
---
I play billy, but prefer Leatherface for his character. One thing Leatherface has over billy is he is unavoidable when he gets close, if you don't get tricked easily. This build makes that quality of his shine versus a billy. Sure a billy can run this build, but he will not gain as much out of it. Sure billy is still better and is the second best killer in the game, but this build makes Leatherman here feel like a freight train.
---
no, we don't need it because it defeats one of the major purposes of the game, teamwork and saves. a single perk that eliminates body blocking (with the 25% slower wiggle time, wiggle time is already very slow), pallet saves, and flashlight saves entirely is just very stupid. it's so meta breaking because it's literally better than every perk in the game. no point in running mad grit because the extra 25% slowed wiggling is already anti body blocking, no reason to run lightborn because it counters flashlights, no need to run enduring because you'll still hold on to the survivor when you get stunned, no need to run agitation because the wiggle time is equivalent to you going faster, etc etc. see what i mean? it's overpowered. and, you don't need mad grit in this scenario, it just makes it even more broken.
---
And it makes the person who did the unhook lose points for being stupid, while not necessarily resulting in the downed player from being re-hooked, still giving them a chance.
---
He's 19 and the girls are 16? Honestly then I don't know why he's being called a pedo- it is a little weird but not pedophilia
---
Yeah exactly
---
That was a good fuckin toolbox too. 
---
I don't know, boss - I don't feel the need to 4K to have a good time. Yeah, some SWFs can be toxic assholes, but if I'm limiting myself to the most boring gameplay to prevent that, am I really having a good time?
---
I'd rather have Survivors that can hold their own against me and have a good time doing it than play Billy for the kills and nonetheless feel like I've wasted my time.
---
You also get more cosmetics if you buy the chapter instead of individuals iirc. 
---
Where the fuck is the Nea option?
---
I wouldn't hide in the basement and do fuck all if I could just learn a new Killer at an appropriate rank. At least most people seemed to have fun with it (hi u/SomeGuy7000 who's been telling the story of me scaring the shit out of them in the basement) though I did get one group of Survivors who called me a "trash FUCKING CLOWN" when I was literally AFK and they died to their greed.
---
Generally if I want to play a Killer I enjoy / know well at a low rank I'll often run a lower-end build to compensate. I'm decent at Trapper but while at Rank 1 I'll probably run Iri Stone and some purple setting tools at low ranks I'd probably be happy to run Trap Bags and Trapper Gloves. I know this isn't universal for all Killers as some are far superior without addons than others (cough Nurse cough, though I don't play Nurse and would never play her at Rank 10- if I was actually good with her lol) but in general I try to keep it casual if I'm playing with players who aren't as good. Likewise why (when SWFing with my low ranked friends) I will often run No Mither (or at least not run Self Care) to compensate. There's no sport in stomping so I challenge myself.
---
Again: I wouldn't hide in the basement and do fuck all if I could just learn a new Killer at an appropriate rank. I really think that individual Killer rank should be implemented.
---
I did derank after reset (didn't even realize it happened lol) and I didn't drop down *too* many ranks. I still felt uncomfortable learning at Rank 10 because that's where the Rank 1s went, so I dropped down to about 13. Didn't go all the way to 15 because I'm way above that skill level, and also because AFKing in that many matches was honestly boring.  
---
Also the alternative to AFKing every match would be to DC every match, and I don't think anyone wants that. Including Behavior who supposedly internally track DC counts, though I've never seen it. :^)
---
Haaaassha 😂
---
HERE HERE!
---
As long as you're admitting DS is a crutch perk for trash players, whatever 
---
Tread carefully, my friend. You're wandering into butt-humping "dS iS fInE WuT aBoUt nOeD" survivor sided territory that this sub is so sickeningly plagued with.
---
Even having two people with it makes you have to rechase someone and chases already can go on for so long 
---
Nah, nobody who currently tunnels with Legion would stop doing it just cause his speed is increased. All that would happen is survivors would complain that Legions are still tunneling, and killers would respond that it’s a legit strategy. Nothing would change other than the tunneling being even more effective.
---
I don't know how it works but I get Gold and Iri Gatekeeper for going  AFK on the hatch. Something something Emblems need a rework.
---
Exactly, I never use either of them when I play sur/killer 😶
---
Lack of sunlight
---
Was reaching down to put a reverse bear trap on a survivor when she DCs. Weird bug occurs: The character is still in the game and everyone keeps healing her. I think they can't see she's a DC, and she does get back up but never moves again.
---
Felt like a sniper in a war movie using a wounded enemy as bait. 10/10, wish DCs wouldn't show and that all characters would persist.
---
What if  it was only 2 v 6 
---
Or 2 v 4
---
Fair. I'll take care. 
---
i think you just need to accept the perk needs a nerf bud
---
For real, and lets be honest, none of the perks are as big of a problem as people make them out to be. I main a killer, I do not love DS. Do I think it needs to be nerfed or removed? Absolutely not, they get the chance once a game, and I get stunned minorly for it. Once they've used it, they can go on the hook. I can't bitch about DS or Self Healing when I NOED and BW the end gates to a group of friends, everyone's gonna use what helps them win, that's kind of the point.
---
One person being actively useless by solo attempting to cleanse all 5 totems by themselves? The logic has never been to let one person cleanse totems, one person loop, and 2 people do gens. 
---
If each person cleanses a single totem at the start, that's 30-45 seconds invested as long as the totems aren't extremely well hidden which is likely. So then someone just needs to cleanse the other during the course of the game. Communication is an issue in a group of randoms, but if everyone just started to actively cleanse dull totems on sight, it really isn't a big deal.
---
WGLF is a great perk and Left Behind isn't, but OP was trying to make a build that is the hardest possible to survive and WGLF benefits you less than Left Behind does.  WGLF doesn't let you do anything you couldn't do without it, since it doesn't give you any bonus at all during the trial itself.  It doesn't let you unhook faster/heal faster, there is literally no situation where the perk helps you in a way you couldn't have pulled off without it.  Left Behind and those other very niche bad perks are very often not going to help you, but it literally is possible that they help you survive.
---
But... but my Basement! 
---
Nah, I think that's a fairly solid suggestion. The main issue is finding any sort of *hard* counter to Decisive besides location advantage. 
---

what if we make it like no mither and it shows the killer who has a ds   
---
it'd show the killer if he would need to worry about them
---
I TOLD YOU MYERS WAS THE CUTEST
---
Doing gens, u?
---
I feel ya so much. It's bothered me since the release of the clown. Other people have pointed it out, but I mean... Descriptions are NOT their strong suit. Is it at least correct in French maybe?
---
Léry’s or The Game. You might as well play scratched mirror which is an easy win on those maps most of the time
---
Or some form of punishment for a successful escape. Someone else recommended a Borrowed Time sort of mechanic that would give the killer a better chance for a reprisal. 
---
It may not look like much, but it’s honest work.

just like in for honour

Bald, bald, my eyes!

Nurse’s doesn’t work on mending though, if that’s what you mean by saying it could be a counter.
---
I think this is an interesting idea though, at the very least they should have broken status like Deliverance.
---
I took the plunge on both. Tips for learning...
---
Huntress - on your monitor or TV, put a see through piece of tape or something right where hatchets go when fully charged. After about 10 games or so you can take it off because youll know where they fly.
---
Nurse... just take the beating. Take it until you are destroying them - she's all muscle memory. Ive noticed people are a lot less "GG EZ" to baby nurses on console because she's so freaking tough. They get it, and youll get there.
---
lol no, ive been reading your other posts and you will not accept that the perk is unbalanced, it takes on too many roles and shuts down a vital part of the game. and yes, it is one of the most powerful perks in the game because it takes on so many roles.
---
about the blinding, most paths to hooks are straight lines. nobody is going to take your mouse and throw it across the room when you're blinded. you can still keep going forward when blinded, unless they body block you, which you can tell by the breathing.
---
agitation isn't better than IG, because going the same distance, just slower, it's still the same distance.
---
pallet stuns won't do anything because the extra wiggle time, the time stunned is completely negated by the extra wiggle time.
---
and yes, it does let bad play happen unpunished, read what i said. the one time where the "entire group" comes down on you still wont do anything because they cannot save the survivor.
---
i would keep restating my points here but you're just going to ignore it and respond with paragraphs upon paragraphs of not adressing my points, and instead talking about how your perk ideas "aren't overpowered' because of the rare situation the entire team throws themselves at you with flashlights and bodyblocking, and the even rarer situation where you run into 5 pallets on your way to your hook.
---
usually, when someone has a terrible idea, they'd realise it. but im not going to waste my time making you realise it. wanna know why? it's never going to be added. the reason your post is being downvoted is because they are terrible ideas. the reason it's never going to be added because the developers know its a terrible idea. 
---
keep calling me entitled and keep claiming yourself as an "experienced survivor", but you honestly sound salty about being blinded. i can't take you seriously when you suggest an omega perk that easily counters any form of teamwork that can stop someone from carrying someone to a hook. you know what it takes to stop someone from putting someone on the hook WITHOUT these perks? flashlights and 3 people body blocking. that already punishes the team enough. it's already hard enough to stop someone from being put on the hook.
---
but yeah, your ideas are great and aren't the perks that crawled out of the salty boosted killers ass when he got blinded over and over by a P3 squadette with flashlights. these are super balanced and not meta changing at all. these are very, very well thought out ideas and you handled criticism of them very maturely instead of saying "you're just bad" and "im better than you", right after effortlessly destroying my fragile, virgin points by showing me situations which never happen unless you're playing against a rank 1 SWF squad.
---
Well that’s the problem.  Freddy isn’t a killer.  You should pick an actual killer, like Nea.
---

---
Yeah, Doc without electrodes has shit range on Shock Therapy. It's not so bad when not moving, but because the Shock Therapy field doesn't move with him its range is effectively reduced.
---
My thoughts exactly. The Ripper (inspired) killer would be cool, otherwise I'd like to see Jekyll/Hyde. Since we have a doctor already, maybe have the monstrous Hyde instead and Jekyll be mentioned only in lore.
---
Imagine getting rid of bbq instead of whispers lol

Fair enough. PWYF just seems like a lot of work just to make use of the saw.

Yeah, no one is denying those are good players. Can I 360 a killer to show off? No, but that's probably just me because I feel like it ADDS risk. I can moonwalk and 360 but in some of those cases, it felt like they were gloating on purpose. Feeling like you're so good you can goof off in matches, that's not a "good" player, that's the one dude in our group who everyone hates because he's criticizing everyone for not doing it his way and acting like a know it all prick. 
---
Lol first off I'm a rank 1 killer not an entitled survivor.  I despise watching fellow rank 1's rely on an undeserved instadown they earn for playing like shit and giving up the gens they're supposed to pressure.  I take out every dull I find.  I cannot tell you how many games I've found 4 myself and still eaten a noed down by a nodding trashcan baby killer end of game because none of my 3 randos could be bothered to take out a single totem.  Finding all 5 yourself every game isn't reasonable.  And no those people also spend a lot of time hiding and being useless on map while ruin is up.  P3. Crawldettes anyone?  You bitching about infinite loops?  These don't exist anymore if you think they do you're just really really scrub at killer.  They took away the pallet vacuum and destroyed the building spawns for windows.  And there's not a single exhaustion perk in game that should give you this much trouble?  Good killers don't need to rely on donated instadown kills for sucking at the game especially at rank 1 or anywhere near it.  NOED is a crutch for micropenis users just like DS and apparently you.
---
The real problem with Legion is the giant disconnect between what the devs thought everyone would do with him, and what players actually do. His kit is clearly designed to harass multiple people at once with high movement speed and shanking a new person resetting their power. In theory that would provide pretty good map pressure as he could just zip around that map harassing survs off gens. In practice though  survivors are too crafty to just be knocked around like that and healing doesnt take enough time to really get anything out of stabbing someone and letting them go. This leaves him with only one real strategy which is to tunnel.
---
If you were to buff legion that wouldnt change imo. Killers would just use what ever buff given to tunnel easier. If you wanna fix Legion its going to have to take a complete redesign I feel.

I'd like to see some sort of mechanic where the hatch would start empowering either the killer or survivor. It's clear the entity knows they're both standing near the hatch and is getting bored. Maybe have some sort of random event to give one of them the edge to entertain the entity. 
---
Just spit balling. 
---
I never use noed, i never use ds. Both perks dont belong at red ranks.
---
Im glad you Saïd that any killer who loses the game in 5 min is a trashcan, cause thats what the topic is about. 
---
You will not win in 5 minutes with a camp, slug or tunnel. If you say otherwise i want too see your streams or vids, you Can watch mine on my twitch(ill dm you my name if intrested)
---
Proxy camping is bs. You're saying you want the killer to not defend the hook person at all, even when it's clear someone is going to try to save them. Go do a gen on the other side of the map instead of crying the killer isn't letting you get a free unhook.
---
Slow ass- you like wasting an unnecessary amount of time doing nothing before helping others. Unhook speed is 200/300/400% slower, if you cancel the unhook animation the survivor immediately enters next hook state.
---
I’m hoping for the best but I doubt I’d play killer away from home. 
---
Lmao what I usually think that when I see nurse (unless its mouse and keyboard) but billy is so easy to play on any console
---
Ok I didn’t say impossible. It just low. I have bbq 3 on my trapper lv47
---
Because  it was funny he'll  never stop being  a pedophile 
---
I try not to tunnel, even though it sometimes can't be helped. And I usually don't camp... unless it's that survivor that managed to pallet me once, then proceeded to tea bag before running.
---
Damn right I just tunneled and face camped him to death. 
---
There's also the whole, having just finished a game vs a SWF Squadette... so I just want to burn the world down. If you're the survivors in the next one... you're collateral damage.
---
Killers be like it’s tunneling time 
---
Next DC'er Ban wave When?
---
Inb4 Killer Battle Royale
---
I fucking love this picture 
---
Nurse gets really boring after you master her. You get a 4k every game because you have her blink distances down to the inch. There really ins't much "outplaying".
---
one of these things is not like the other
---
one of these things just doesn't belong
---
It can suck to deal with when multiple people have it in the same game. The players who use it are typically garbage though, so it doesn't really extend chases by much when I encounter it. I play a lot of Spirit with STBFL and Rancor as well, so I just ignore the obsession in many games then Mori then if it gets to end game. That being said, a full SWF with decisive and adrenaline is cancer. But how often do we realistically encounter that as killers?
---
- Hates ochido
---
- Gives him free advertising
---
Dbd reddit in a nutshel
---
Problem is, though, if DCs become more common, new players will think that’s the way it is, until no-one wants to play killer anymore. And when there are no killers, who will survivors tbag? 
---
Because it’s a lot lore common for the next day or two for good survivors to be matched with potato teamates, which just pisses them off so they dc 
---
Deliverance is probably a poor choice if the plan is to run interference for the rest of the team, since you're unlikely to get an unhook before you go down yourself without the killer finding a worse player first.
---
And the doctor was never heard from again!
---
I'd say over 50% of killers dodge swf. Which makes it impossible to separate people. Dodging a lobby isnt wrong at all, DCing is 
---
40% is too high by far. I feel for little Billy who plays by abacus and tins connected with string, but maybe Billy should get a better setup. 
---

Username says a lot about your opinion

I mean killers dc all the fucking time too. At least a third of red rank games where everyone gets out the killer pulls their Ethernet to deny points 
---
Convenience, I wasn’t home. I took a screenshot off some gameplay I had streamed. 
---
I have an idea to counter the pallet drops. Get Spirit Fury and Enduring, so when the survivors are forced to drop the pallets you still get them. Not sure perks you'd want to replace, but you use BBQ intelligently
---
You don’t even get a lot of blood points for camping tho so like why?
---
Nobody has that many moris, especially on a killer they don’t play ...

**GOMENASAI, I HAD BEEN ANALYSING SPREADSHEETS FOR 2 HOURS D:**
---
Thank you for your valiant efforts to control the quality of this subreddit!
---
I always see it on Trappers and Clowns, too. Sometimes Hags and Pigs.
---
That's like... half the cast. Maybe people should be doing dulls more often...
---
And that’s just as bad. DCing is lame and should have harsher consequences or the community as a whole suffers
---
Yeah its an issues, Ive seen lots of post on here from people who hate SWF and will dodge them all day long.  Think of it this way, (2) 2 man swfs in a match. They are more lethal than a 4 man swf, as they do not have a weak leak. those 2 man swf mean business man.  
---
Yeah, the ones bought with cells/shards only come with the base cosmetics, none of the alternates.
---
I thought you could stun her?
---
if she was being stunned she wouldn't be OP and broken, now would she? Every game needs one or 2 OP/gamebreaking characters and nurse is it for DbD since she ignores every game mechanic put in place 
---
she scores for ambush attacks.. but yes her "better" addons are a joke
---
They don’t even know who they’re talking to lol
---
I main legion, only because his power doesn’t require practice or learning
---
Feng. I run all her perks with Dance with Me
---
Assuming 2 hours a day at 15 mins per game, that is 8 games per day or 40 per week, so that player can DC in 15 of their 40 games, or 3 of their 8 games a night before facing a penalty. Then multiply that by all the DC abusers and you start seeing damage to the community.
---
Not gonna lie, in the few games I’ve played the last few days, there has been at least one DC in every single one. That’s a poor experience for me as a killer, as well as their teammates, who have to pick up their slack. 
---
All in all, this kind of thing can really screw a community up :(
---
With some minor balance tweaks here and there those perks could be awesome! Love the ideas! 
---
Yeah, the one I chase is the one I see. People give me too much credit.
---
Monto taught us to listen to the grass move around us to counter it 
---
because this subreddit is filled with children who dont know how to properly hold an argument against something they dislike so instead they make a meme and hope it gets enough attention because its the next best thing 
---
See for yourself! Here are the results: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aqz2l1/full_results_who_is_the_cutest_male_killer_survey/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
And that’s probably what I’ll do from now on. No point wasting the time or the mori
---
If the nurse can blink through solid objects that means she's immaterial/non-corporeal when blinking, so why would a pallet be able to make contact? That makes no sense.
---
As a survivor main A good spirit is awful since it's hard to predict her
---
Imo technician is underrated and iron will is a great perk
---
Tunneling is a term bad survivors use to excuse getting caught multiple times. Sorry your team wait was overly altruistic and crouched away, not gonna let 2 of you get away scott free
---
In what world would she not be broken if you could stun her? This situation barely ever happens anyways, and plus, good nurses wouldnt let themselves be stunned like that easily. This is literally just a small change to atleast allow some counterplay vs her. And i disagree that every game needs gamebreaking characters.
---
When I realise, the unhook I did wasn't as safe as I had assumed, I generally try to lob myself at the killer in the hopes, that the other survivor gets away. Doesn't always work, but I'd feel bad about it otherwise 
---
'It takes... serious concentration... to gently caress... this pile of skulls... for ten seconds...!'
---
I understand where you are coming from and we do need separate killer ranks. 
---
But we dont have them so it's your choice to do fuck all in the basement and give everyone a boring ass game. The minority may enjoy some free objective points but most people who play dbd want a killer to be a killer.
---
The reason they monitor DCing is because it ruins the experience. What you're doing does the same. 
---
If you still cant train at killer at rank 10 then the only advice is to just keep practicing and wait for the natural rank 1s to progress. If you're still learning then you wont so it's fine. 
---
I think you just need to train at rank 10 and dont try and get too low because nerfing your addons is nothing against a team of potatoes if you can use your power well.
---
As someone who can only fit in 1 killer and 1 survivor game in most days, I'd be pissed off if my survivor game was just boring skill checks all game and then leaving with half the points I could have.
---
Seriously, just play.
---
I see someone else finally got the empty entity bug. Were you trying to join a kyf game?
---
I'll play against 2 groups but I wont play against red ping, 0 reason that in 2019 people have 500+ping
---
Then why do you get the bloodpoints for the pallet stun during her blink? I thought if you get bloodpoints for a pallet stun you're supposed to actually stun the killer. 
---
Could I get a link to the original?
---
If you get a ivory (green one I think?) Its not horrible but it's not fun 
---
Bruh, you knew what the hell I meant
---
What happened here haha
---
One didn't load in so the other two disconnected?
---
In my opinion, if the killer positions himself in such a way that they get blinded they should be punished, also you barely ever get pallet stunned and all you have to do is check the area before picking up the person. 
---
That might've been me
---
That just makes me want Waluigi in DBD now. 
---
The same happened to me weeks ago. I did two gens and open the door, but I had to avoid the killer everytime because he kept going back and forth. My heart worked that day.
---
People aren’t gonna stop DCing against legion until he’s fixed no matter how many people play him 
---
True, killers should just blindfold themselves and walk away from the hook, and search for the uninjured survivor that crouched away somewhere while the injure survivor blairs airhorns crabwalking away 
---
I’m a nurse main, rank reset is literally the best time for me. People can unhook right in front of me and I’ll still go for the guy at full health while giving a chance for everyone to heal because I’ll still get 3 hooks on everyone. It’s to the point where i’m giving 2 people a free escape because they just have no chance. 
---
Only time I've seen Myers look anything like this when Laurie kneed him in the balls in H20.
---
LOL sorry, wasnt trying to be a dick
---
I wish the disappointment was just a little more exaggerated 
---
The survivor trying to take the hits WANTS the killer to do that, it is literally bait. 
---
You have no red stain, and you have 1.3 seconds of invisibility at a time.
---
You can hide behind walls for the 1.7 visibility intervals and pop out at the last second.
---
It was probably for overall. Last time I ranked down from green ranks to 1 I barely ever saw noed until red ranks, but once I got there if the killer wasnt nurse or billy they were almost guaranteed to have noed.
---
This is why I prefer iron grasp over agitation.
---
That's what I'm getting at here. If enough play Legion and the bans start hitting, then either players will have to adapt or stop playing. Either way, BHVR will have to do something about Legion, Or survivors will have to learn how to play against them better.
---
The only problem with legion is that he’s in the game rn 
---
So with you on this. Bubba I can manage. The perks are better for me and I can OCCASIONALLY hit the saw.
---
If it's not "Wraith bing-bongs your ding-dong", I don't want to see any DbD related Smash news.
---
They escaped for real this time 
---
exactly, it’s the only exhaustion perk that still helps while you’re exhausted, which means you can pair it with other exhaustion perks
---
Oh mate haha 
---
Currently, coordinated swf are still strong, meta perks galore with very little variety, and little reason to switch from the same 8 or so Meta perks. Flashlight addons don't seem to do much aside from the batteries and filament. On Xbox the red rank pool for both sides has been and still is small. On the plus side the small community seems to be getting friendlier with just a few outliers still determined to hook farm/sandbag etc. Would be happy to give more information as needed/wanted. 50/50 killer, survivor player here on Xbox.
---
I got nurse's in the shrine early on and couldn't really care less about her other perks, so Nurse remains eternally level 1 for me.
---
ur acting like its the first time youve heard someone crying about a killer 
---
Just stop lol
---
// thrill of the hunt activates 
---
Me: spends the rest of the game being chased away from dulls
---
Thats true, shitty survivors deserve to be facecamped tbh, but if its not the case, you could make use of that time getting more bp. Even when doing rituals, camping its just a waste of time.
---
(I dont really have a main side so Im not choosing a team or anything)
---
Nurse takes more than just space and W to down someone. Nurse is the most overpowered Killer in the game, but she's not as broken as Legion. All Legion consists of is bee-lining and vaulting every pallet and window the survivor vaulted. Miss a swing? Don't worry, you have Unrelenting 9000. Couple that with Frank's Mixtape and moonwalking and you have the most overpowered, uncounterable Killer in the game. Play Legion how he's intended/without broken add-ons, he is the worst Killer in the game.
---
Also, Huntress is easily the most balanced Killer in the game. She has clear advantages and disadvantages, and can be countered by being knowledgeable about what loops she's weak/strong against. Just because she can throw over pallets and windows doesn't mean she counters any of that. Legion is Nurse but without needing to predict Survivor movement, just W key and they will die no matter what, no matter the Survivor.
---
Theres no evidence. What we have here is the discount tru3talent posting a conversation of a girl saying "yeah he asked me for pictures" ...thats it. Theres no evidence of him asking for said pictures. This is just slander at this point and you guys cant even do that right. If anything, hes a hebephile. I dont expect the general low IQ of reddit to know the difference. So in retrospect we have a discount killer main using someone elses name to boost his video, a girl claiming ochido did something but not providing any evidence other than her own word,reddit further slandering the man but not even using the correct terms to do so. Im not saying one is better than the other but come on...if youre gonna slander someone at least have some wit about it. So many people judging a mans morality based on actions in a fucking video game. Complaining that he witchhunts when you all are guilty of the same thing, you've done it to ochido and jendenise. BTW im not an ochido fan...just someone with an IQ high enough to use the wonderful thing called logic.
---
I like that idea. Anything to convince teammates in solo queue to cleanse totems is a plus and would stop one of the issues people have with the perk. A notification or something similar to what you stated after every totem is cleansed instead of just the 5th one would be nice though.
---
The fuck? You can pip as killer with only one kill. It’s literally harder to not rank up as killer than it is to rank up as survivor 
---
The meme economy is booming. Buy buy!
---
You aren’t understanding. I’m not talking about one person baiting the killer so another person can go in for the save. 
---
Ok, so all the survivors should just let the guy die and do gens. Just  ever complain that gen speed is too fast if you condone and use this shitty style of play.
---
And this is exactly why i don't play vs Legion.
---
Everyone already knows how to play against legion, and the devs already know they’re a problem, they’re just taking forever to fix them as usual
---
Yea
---
Oh yeah, my last intention is to irritate other players. But I'm gradually learning that it doesn't matter if I want to win. As I climb in ranks, you have to be more annoying if you want to get those tasty bloodpoints, lol. 
---
I'll probably get downvoted for this but honestly if someone DC's at the start like that, I'll DC too. 
---
Sorry, don't wanna do a 5 gen 3 survivor game. It's not fun.
---
Yeah, I thought so too. I could have sworn it has worked before in my games, but you just have to time it perfectly.
---
haha well ya, hate those games where everyone is green but one guy is red and he readies up right away.  They are such jerks and the times when you wish you could just kick them from the lobby
---
Add in Brutal Strength and you’ve got my Amanda build known as Yummy Yummy Pallets in My Tummy. 
---
It's kinda lame. The Botanist completely destroys The Wraith's niche.
---
I hate the play style that Legion forces on killers but I don’t DC against him because most people I’ve played aren’t that good with them. Granted, I’m rank 10 - 13 on survivor because I mainly play killer so I don’t expect to be facing the best of the best. But I’m not particularly bothered when I see the deep wounds timer come up. I can’t speak about higher-level play though. I can usually get 3 or 4K with Legion at R1 without using Franks and I can tell you from experience that Legion can be hell to play against once you practice. It just sucks that Legion forces tunneling gameplay which most people agree is not fun to play against. But it’s kinda hard to change now that they fully developed and released a killer that mainly utilizes tunneling.
---
I actually wouldn't mind games like that, at least like that ONE person can escape. The Quentin I was with had like only gen done and that was because the Claudette that died first was the one who repaired it. 
---
I was the killer and I was so mad at him for doing that to the team, like one of the hooked survivors was literally just across the street from the totem while I was on teh other side of the map hooking the third survivor. smh.
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength and Fire up for the fuck your pallets build.
---
That is an idle animation. His whole body would move if looked around
---
Given that it’s expected release date is the same time as a chapter release they’ll probably use the trailer to also advertise the new killer and survivor. 
---
Also if things go as they have been it’ll be Chapter 13. 
---
I know they say we’ll never see Jason Vorhees due to the Friday the 13th game, but they also said we’ll never see a switch port and chapter 13 would be perfect for Jason. 
---
&gt; Nurse gets really boring after you master her
---
Nurse main here, i like to see hard work pay off instead of running ring around the rosie on certain loops/maps where X killers simply can't compete vs good survivors :)
---
Running the killer wow, care to abuse the game anymore? so toxic. Next time let the killer hook you and play fair.
---
that dam deep wound mechanic is the biggest cripe with him 
---
An injured survivor also slides 4 about 15 secs after pallet interacting also
---
Any should they be punished, they are just playing the game. And they are really good at it, so they become toxic because they are good. And you would not get punished for being good at a game 
---
Bming the killer is better than surviving
---
I've been trying to play killer, but since I'm real shit it takes like 30 minutes to find a match
---
Je saurai maintenant.

In my dreams I was apart of his beautiful alpha body, his abs, his face 😍 and his foreskin 
---
Ty 
---
i dont even bother using it strategically 
---
the best time to use it is to save it for when the gates are powered or in a hatch stand off
---
i just use it immediately and run cause i cant always counts on people to save me
---
Also do cutest survivor :)
---
Tbh i dont mind legion unless its legion with frank's mixtape. If he has that addon or he moonwalk to break chase mechanic i DC instanly. I dont care. I wont play against this bullshit. There is no counterplay to it and i cant do anything about that. Also this deep wound screen is really obnoxious and it gives me headaches. Its just too dark and there is too much blood on it.
---
Downed a Claudette who was running around a hooked Survivor like a doofus instead of waiting for me to leave. No nearby hooks so I figured I'd just tank the D-strike.
---
Girl immediately blinds me afterwards and keeps clicking her flashlight. Alright I'm blind but I'm not deaf - thanks for the free ecolocation.
---
Playing at a fairly low rank right now and the Claud quick switched to Flashlight D-Strike Claud at the last second in the lobby. Ochido fanboy spotted.
---
As a *intellectual clown main*, Billy is overrated. /s
---
Thanks :) haven’t unlocked much yet but I’m working on it :D
---
#ForeskinLivesMatter
---
Thanks :)
---
there is  HUGE diference between being good and something and being a toxic person, i am good at many things, yet i've never been toxic when someone else asked me for help.
---
I know a lot of people that are good at the game that aren't toxic at all and that are very positive actually. They can't really be punished anyway because that happens outside the game, as long as they are not toxic in the game it's fine. And it also depends on your definition of toxic and what could be punished. Teabagging is toxic but cannot be punished, same goes for facecamping. But insulting people outside the game, making fun of players etc, it should be punished, but it's outside the game, so it won't be punished. Now it's just a problem of mentality and ego I'd say, if you're being very toxic you probably are complexed by something.
---
Myers big ugly can’t even see his face smh
---
It's funny you mention that because I actually just had a group load in all 400 ping and instantly ready up. I'm dying now lol
---
Thanks. When I use nurses on her can I see auras while phasing?
---
I had a Dwight t posing at the campfire lmao 
---
Are you guys talking about blink stun or not? I thought this was common knowledge that you can't stun nurse during her blink. Of course you can stun her normally, im just purely talking about while she is in her blink. I got like 400 hours in dbd, and i have stunned her during her blinks many times, it has never gone through though, every single time she was able to blink again and even hit after the blink.
---
Those are highlights, I doubt hes doing that everytime he plays. But I agree that some of them are just showing off. For me I like to balance things out. I can moonwalk and do 360s but using them only when I dont have other choice. No pallets or windows close - I can try to 360 the killer. Moonwalk is just a fun stuff to do and when I learned it my fun lvl in this game went up a bit. 
---
...of the survivors maybe....lol.
---
There are simple solutions to this "problem". If they're breaking some rules, report them to the appropriate people. If not, then just don't support them by watching them, or commenting about them. If they are genuinely breaking rules and reporting does nothing, *then* raise awareness by actually naming and shaming them with proof.
---
thanks
---
For the survivors, not the killer
---
She can only be stunned in between blinks or before or after. For those who don't understand it means that she can be stunned before she uses let's go of M2, L1, or Lt depending on what you play on you will still get the points regardless of when the pallet hits her but only a perfectly timed stun will stop her from blinking and give her a stun time.
---
Every Hillbilly in the higher ranks run Ruin, BBQ, Enduring, and Bamboozle. Definitely not fun to play against especially if it’s on Autohaven or the Coldwind Farm. He’s definitely the strongest killer on consoles.
---
The way I see it the reason so many dc from legion is because legion removes all escapes. Survivors have been nerfed to hell and now the only half ass way to escape is windows/pallets (which both have been nerfed repeatedly) and legion goes over those faster then survivors, he moves way too fast as well. If there is no way to get away, why even try? Sure you will say to get better or adapt, and I’m all for that, but there is no adapting to legion. You can only hope he goes for somebody else. Why would people play something that is not fun? 
---
Alright, let the insults come rolling in. 
---
That sounds really op :D does that combo get used a lot? Can’t remember ever seeing that
---
A lot of things that ruin the fun for one side, makes it enjoyable for the other side, that's the point of an asymetric game. It's a game of tug of war usually.
---
Taking LoL for example, a lot of games are stomps, and it's always fun for the side winning, and most of the time unfun for the team losing. 
---
Yeah thats true, both sides will find a way to complain about the other side.
---
I know how it feels, I voted for him too D:
---
Fair. I've actually been using that Spirit Combo as well, it's awesome 
---
yea i really hate that deep wound screen. Its really obnoxious and i cant see anything.
---
Well I wouldn’t mind some kills :D but have to work on my aim with huntress first :D
---
I thank you for not play legion
---
Nah as a survivor main I don't mind moris. I think they're cool and if the killer gets me and uses it more power to them that's what it's for. I can think of worse things 
---
I feel like I'm the only person who plays Billy because I have fun with him and not because he is top tier. 
---
Really? That's unfortunate. But Agreed. Some negative status that isn't Exhausted, because let's be honest, that's lame. 
---
I play him because he's both fun to play and is viable in rank1
---
Just to clarify, I don't hate legion or the mixtape, I just thought this would make some of the more toxic players laugh.
---
A lot of nurses i seem to play against don't seem to be that good at the game so i find her to be really easy. Unless its one who knows their stuff. That shit is terrifying but the challenge is worth it imo
---
The most enjoyable killers imo are Michael and Billy 
---
Billy is still good even if you can't land the saw solely because he can get places quickly. Yes he gets looped but he has very little downtime hunting for people between loops when he's got BBQ or something scouting perks going. 
---
And Mad Grit over both of those
---
C:
---
What do you consider toxic? Pallet looping lol? 
---
r/canthold
---
***Squadette***
---
Wise words brother 
---
Aw hell no 
---
Mori are not balanced that is true. But I've lately appreciated as a survivor how they can make any game instantly threatening. Even if we're doing great getting 3 gens with only one hook, the instant that guy gets mori'd it's instantly "oh damn, is it pink or green??" And the game comes alive. And I think that is fun
---
Squadette falls before the multi hit chainsaw. They always cower in fear before me
---
Sole Survivor works pretty well with it, actually. If you're the last one in the trial, you can see the killer but not vice versa at all. 
---
Devs don\`t like Killers so don\`t bother....
---
Try the Legion Style of following a Survivor while walking backwards (this way you don´t proc the chase mechanic and the timer will continue while you still follow em). You can use the Bloodhound perk with mangled effect from addon or perk if you have trouble following survivors backwards.
---
They could make it that whenever Survivors repair a Gen the Timer for every Survivor with a Reverse Beartrap is reduced by 30sec to slow down the Game or sacrifce your Teammates 
---
You could argue that if you had smaller ban durations more frequently it might do better as a deterrent but I’ll have to wait and see like everyone else :)
---
LOL, thats good stuff
---
I dont own spirit, however I might buy her soon. Do you have any advice on when/how/why to use her power ?
---
Tbagging, meme builds, and other goofiness are like 90% of the fun now. 
---
Hatch won't even spawn unless you have enough gens done btw. Depending on how many people are left.
---
Unless it's trapper....or wraith....or hillbilly....
---
Found my doc build XD
---
Canada is my favorite continent 
---
Mori's are good for both survivor and killer, in my opinion. Killers are the stronger beings, and survivors need to be reminded of that occasionally. I stay on my toes when I know killers have a mori. 
---
Game bans doesn't work like that. "I'll pay you to get back"? Nah, that'd be too easy.
---
I’m a fairly good Spirit, and I run: BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher and Nurse’s Calling
---
If you want to play Nurse, then play Nurse.  I have a regular PS4 and can still do well with her at rank 1.  She's very unforgiving, and FPS/controller sensitivity are some real limitations but she can still be an absolute beast once you learn how to control her.  I'm far from the best console Nurse too, every few month's I'll end up playing against one that is insanely good and just shuts everybody down.  She's tough and has problems her PC counterpart doesn't have, but is still very good.  
---
Thank you I didn’t know it came out
---
Pro and base ps4 will perform the same. Both experience extreme fps drops when blinking. Just how it's going to be till/if they optimize the game. Of course you can still learn o play her and do well it's just going to be a lot harder than PC or using any other killer on ps4 
---
This also affects hitbox reliant items like the flashlight. For some killers you have to shine at their chest, others over their head
---
They'll optimize eventually, if only so nintendo will actually allow them to port the game. They don't give a fuck about our experience on xbox or ps4 clearly.
---
Hillbilly and Michael are some of the strongest killers on xbox, once you learn how to properly land your attacks, the fps works against the survivors more.
---
he’s still slightly underpowered
---
have you tried shocking someone with no range addons before
---
What's the connection? 
---
yeah i thought so too, but you can't give the survivor too many info. Just the fifth can be more like the "good surprise" of some sort
---
Not going to lie. Almost every time I've had a survivor miss DS or get re-downed after successfully hitting it disconnects.  I don't get their logic. Like.. you really only relied on DS to play the game?  Same thing for the skilled loopers who mess up and get caught.  Disconnected.
---
But same thing for killers. Can't get that looper? Disconnected.  3 gens done and you spent the whole time face camping? Disconnected.
---
Complaining about getting gen rushed but you literally spent the whole match chasing one guy?  Disconnected as soon as gates are powered.
---
This game in my opinion had the worst players in terms of a competitive community. It boggles my mind. Even at rank reset.  Why you disconnecting at rank 15? You ain't losing shit. 
---
Wraith is a weaker killer
---
6000 iq David 
---
Honestly if Lithe made you vault a bit faster (in a similar vein to Balanced Landing's reduced landing lag) it could actually be very good and on par with the other Exhaustion perks.
---
Dead Hard would still be the worst but honestly I think DH needs a serious rework.
---
yeah i thought so too, but you can't give the survivor too many info. Just the fifth can be more like the "good surprise" of some sort while still giving just a bit of info
---
What on god's green earth are you trying to say
---
Why does this one have so many down votes...
---
I am trying to say that if you are good and people think you are toxic you should not get punished just for being good and mildly bulling killers. 
---
Right, but what does that have to do with OP's post?
---
He is the god we need to pray for to get shirtless myers
---
I dont think so. Well he got banned for exploits, he showed them to the devs and it got fixed. He got banned for it but he didnt abuse it like every game... A lot of people watched him and a lot disliked. Like i dont get it if you dont like him dont watch him and ignore him. I liked him... Like if you didnt found the bug in the game... If you found it, you literally just used it. I saw it with my own 2 eyes he found it and stood there for like 10 sec. And then went off, so whats the problem... It got FIXED
---
I see posts about survivors being toxic all the time, but I have never once threatened any killer, especially with something as serious as a DOX attack. 
---
After earning an "undeserved R1" in 6 hrs of play due to DC's... Yeah, I either want this game to die for allowing such a thing to happen or I want enough awareness to be raised as to the overall problem... Which I can't decide is either with Legion themselves and their game-play design, or survivors being a bunch of mewling quims who will DC as soon as they have to change their tactics in the game instead of trying to learn and adapt to the new killer. 
---
If my proposal actually results in people leaving the game... then BHVR will HAVE to either give up on it, or fight to win people back. My hope is for the latter. Either way, the impact of Legion on the community will be decided, good or bad, and while wanting the best result, I'm expecting the worst, but am hoping for a good compromise overall. 
---
Literally no one is suggesting that wtf
---
*inserts a perk or killer that kills survivor vs killer interaction* 
---
Yes they are some people think that looping, flashlight saving and everything is toxic and that’s what you do when you become good at the game 
---
You clearly don't have an axe to grind lol
---
I’d pray in front of him but I don’t want him to get tier 3 
---
Not too much bothers me
---
when multiple people in SWF get out with a key is one
---
sandbaggers
---
the see through tiles in coldwind farm
---
that's about it as a general matter
---
for something particular, I lost a kill yesterday because someone had 35 percent DS and Adrenaline. that was tilting 
---
That's a giant assumption that he wasn't the killer. Also, the only person who would agree with this is the type of person to doxx. So basically, a human maggot that's not exclusive to killer mains. 
---
[He is cute and whoever tells me otherwise shall die.](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/thumb/a/aa/HB_charSelect_portrait.png/150px-HB_charSelect_portrait.png?version=f10472dd5349118f4841409bdfda5bd0)
---
Like I suggested in the past, the game should establish totems as an actual objective. ADD A TOTEM COUNTER
---
I have a GTX 1080 w/ Ryzen 1700X and have solid 60FPS on low @1440p.
---
I used to play on ultra (it stayed at 60fps most of the time, it dipped to 40~50FPS in certain spots like Badham's basement) but I noticed the anti aliasing is so stong you miss a lot of the details.
---
On low you have less shadows and you see better in general.
---
1 less thing to bitch about down, infinite to go
---
Can we agree to stop calling Dead Hard a crutch perk? If you don’t use it skillfully, it only works once. It’s hilarious that a perk gets such a bad rep when it’s literally countered by waiting a second. 
---
Damn you take jokes way to serious this is why you don't  get invited to parties. 
---
**As killer:** People who are *so* thirsty for the flashlight blind while you are breaking the palette they just stunned you with.
---
**As survivor:** People who let off hook the first time they are hooked and/or flat out dc on their first knockdown. 
---
we should also punish anyone who wins against me. how dare they ruin my experience by subjecting me to a loss. they should be punished for this.
---
If those walls were blinkable you could abuse it to blink outside the map, I know exactly what I was saying. 
---
- survivors being a bunch of mewling quims who will DC as soon as they have to change their tactics in the game instead of trying to learn and adapt to the new killer. 
---
Again, like I said. No one minds changing their tactics and I think people know how to play great against legion. They have learned and can adapt to a new killer. The issue is that people who choose to play legion know exactly what their doing to annoy people. People dont want to play not because they will lose but instead because it takes all of the fun out of the game. The chases are boring and not enjoyable because the whole fun is being able to make the right choices and outplay the other person (this is referencing both killers and survivors). If you take away all the options to enjoy the one fun part of this game theres nothing left. Then on top of not having fun chases you get to hold m1 for even more than when you are doing gens.
---
Your opinion is everyone needs to play legion to torment all of the other players to punish them. You are leaving out the option of playing literally any other killer and NO ONE plays legion. The devs will still see the stats for that except you wont be deliberately making everyone else experience shit. You know people hate playing against them so you're going out of your way to play as that killer. Then you are complaining about people not wanting to play against them. 
---
You think you are on the smart/good side, but that's deliberately going to stir the shit. Just play any other killer that you enjoy and just accept the lost $6 dollars for buying the legion. You are doing something that is causing the dc. Stop doing that and people wont dc. Easy solution.
---
&gt;When I say Sprint Burst is OP people tell me Balanced Landing is, when I say Balanced Landing is OP people tell me Dead Hard is, when I say Dead Hard is OP people tell me Sprint Burst is
---
Outside of the meme I do honestly think that Dead Hard is the worst Exhaustion perk in the game.
---
Any idea how I go about this? I’ve used the in game function, but I need to send a video too. Do I do that to an email? Usually I don’t report people and go on my way, but this was really irritating and now they’re all messaging me. 
---
Also on PS4!
---
Spirit: Ruin, Make Your Choice, Nurse's Calling, Monitor and Abuse - the spirit already has a small terror radius and M&amp;A makes it even smaller, pairing well with Nurse's so people won't stop healing since it takes longer to hear your heartbeat. You can see their aura and then phase to them easily.
---
Huntress: Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, Nurse's Calling - this build could be optimized, but this is what I used when I was learning her because I was missing hatchets all of the time and wanted to slow the game down as much as possible. If you still need practice with the Huntress, this is a good place to start :)
---
Discordance and BBQ are both great but I don't have them. You can also swap NOED in with both of those builds (swap for MYC or M&amp;A with Spirit, swap with Thanatophobia for Huntress
---
that's just the spirit
---
WAH!
---
Ok but why
---
The thing is, you either do All the totems or you do none. 
---
Nurse is definitely a harder killer to play. The thing that works best with me is to use short blinks while chasing a survivor. It closes the gap and they can’t just run backwards when you blink. 
---
Well it has a high skill cap. Use it creatively and you can buy yourself a window vault or pallet throw. Use it like an idiot and suddenly it doesn’t work anymore because the killer just times it. It’s definitely not OP, just whiny killers. 
---
The answer to DC is not in punishing DC, but in making the game right for the others. Ok your case, the DCing player should stay in game (is account stays connected to the game) and face whatever’s coming. THAT would stop ppl from DCing.
---
pretty petty
---
Every single totem in the Azarov map is placed between 2 sets of tires.  
---
This sure is a improved totem placement, and lets not forget they are placed next to a gen or a jungle gym.
---
Okay so according to you playing with your friends is toxic and people who were mad at you for being too much of a coward to save them. 
---
Got it. 
---
Yes, but you as Freddy have no idea when those intervals are. And that all goes away as soon as you're able to hit the person. Either way, there's not enough room for you to play with that unless you have pill bottle or you're some godlike freddy. Even then, is it worth the extra 7 seconds to be able to hit them again?
---
That's second place!! I count that as a happy result!!
---
getting unhooked when the killer is right there, leaving a match with 5k points.
---
As Killer: survivors that think they are invincible and ragequit after they're downed
---
As Survivor: other survivors that don't focus on the gens and mess skill checks everytime
---
Survivor - Complete the gens while doing any saves if necessary and staying alive. Once all 5 gens are completed, open the doors.
---
Killer - Kill the survivors before they can escape.
---

The first line of their bio, actually.

I switched to ds/balanced and haven’t looked back. Currently grinding for lithe and I imagine I’ll like it more than sb, too.
---
shut up
---
And this is one of the kids that were helping the killer. 
---
Nani!?
---
Can't believe I missed that, shame on me! Thanks for the heads-up!
---
Why would people be punished for being “toxic” which is using existing features in the game that “nice” players dont
---
fucking devs
---
well they must have changed it, go on the wiki
---
I'm crying lol
---
thats what I said
---
\*shoots him\*
---
Why would the killer do this?
---
Congratulations
---
I main main main the ghost. Main main fredson stedson. Main the huntress. Sometimes the witch. But after all i've seen how ppl play today and ppl play when you play freddy....yeah thanks no
---
I think it's 100% a bug. 
---
Gens still seem to go at the same speed and 2 people are definitely faster than 1.
---
well this is why anecdotal evidence isn't that strong, i personally dont see it too often, so uhhhhh
---
I can't read
---
i don't want to use 0.1% of my power.

I’m pretty sure it’s means an increase in speed

And with the amount of edits I had to make to the post to correct typos and other infos, it's safe to say I can't write. Don't worry :P
---
there are 2 things im afraid of in this world one is clowns and the other is this eye stealing freek idk if i can do both in dbd ughghg
---
ds takes no skill at all? It's a skill check, not exactly a challenge. 
---
When I have a doc ritual, I only shock and take every pallet on the map.
---
reminds me of when I plunged the car on Mario Kart
---
I play on console I feel that might be the difference.  I understand you don't have nearly as many campers and noed users on PC if that's where you're playing. I play on PS4 and 65% of our red rank killers run that babydick bullshit. 
---
That's the spirit
---
oh it must have been worked on when legion was new cause its complaints about how she is useless instead of complaints that he is to strong in a chase
---
You ever done a chainsaw just straight across the map? Its so fun, and it’s usually an instakill as a player ain’t about that shit. *Disconnects
---
This has been intended for a long time now but they only recently added it.
---
Basically it's because two people doing the same generator isn't equal to two people doing two separate generators, there is a (very slight) penalty to gen repair speed when more than one person is on it. 
---
oh no I play on ps4, could be a region thing, honestly idk man, maybe you're just remembering the matches that pissed you off more
---
S Q U A D E T T E
---
Me too
---
also you have recorded us without permission and put our public psn on a public server which i do not consent to so can you please delete
---
Lol. Enjoy the ban. 
---
Can't imagine how hard it would be to play Huntress on console.
---
Flashlight clickers
---
Campers 
---
Farmers
---
Survivors not doing anything 
---
Survivors that bring the killer to where I'm at causing me to get killed
---
People who just stand at the exit gates t bagging, doing emotes, and once again, clicking their flashlights 
---
&gt; Getting fat shamed during a chase,
---
I can't recall which one it was, but I got fat shamed in an Autohaven map at the same spot 3 times. I have no one to blame but myself for continuously doing it but it really doesn't look a spot you couldn't fit through 
---
THIS JUST IN: Joey is secretly Louis
---
spirit is fun and extremely viable, you just need to learn how to play her, it could be argued shes stronger than billy even
---
Noob here please elaborate. Does WGLF also adds bps to cleansing totems?
---
When you are working with another survivor, there’s a 10% penalty to each. I think the red bar is just showing that the penalty is in place. It’s still faster to do a gen with someone else than by yourself.
---
Most likely 40, but it usually dips to 30 when i run around objects. 
---
And they want to port it to switch...
---
Fucking consoles.
---
use headphones when using her
---
Yes. I am annoyed by it.
---
For harassment. You’re going across multiple platforms and harassing me. It’s against TOS and this is even more proof so, please, dig the hole deeper. 
---
RTX 2070 and Ryzen 7 2700 getting 50fps at ultra settings wtf
---
I was playing spirit, and saw the DS user jump in and out of a locker from across the map near an incredibly strong loop to get my attention thinking hes le ebic pro looper going to distract me for 5 gens, I downed him in about 30 seconds (spirit ftw btw), and hooked him denying his ds, he ragequit lmao.
---
Same and it even looks like the killer is lying down too. Those look like wraith legs.
---
David confirmed to be so thin that hatchets go through him?
---
No, he's garbage. Let's keep this virus from spreading.
---
Plus we all know Dwight is coming to smash 4head
---
Got rid of BBQ??? Heresy! Think of the bloodpoints!!!
---
Okay, I never use the perk object of obsession, so does that mean I am hearing a different survivor getting chosen? 
---
For the bee pee.
---
ofcourse but due to fps and the xbox/ps4 controller she is much more limited. she is still really good on console just not as good as on pc.
---
wtf? whispers? i get that its strong, but i never heard anyone complain that its even close to bbq, ruin or noed. some ppl just want to whine about random stuff i guess...
---
I like being mori'd, because its cool and funny
---
Never you dingus lol there's so many reasons why.
---
one being he'd destroy survivors because of his ability to fly, then the whole hollywood child fiasco 
---
The repair speed penalty has been there since the very beginning, they just recently added the red bar to indicate it.
---
Not a bad shout! 
---
Nope completely objective man.  It's astounding the sheer amount of NOED that is in my matches at rank 1.  And as a fellow killer I know how easy it is to rank up and get your 3 and 4ks without it.  The moment they took away the pallet vacuum chases became kind of a joke.  Optimal looping isn't enough anymore survivors have to open field juke you to make some of the loops now that they don't have the vacuum suck to safety.  That and looping most buildings is worthless now with how they reworked the window spawns.  Regionally I'm  East coast US.
---
Flashlight blinds after every pallet drop. You're not leaving the match alive for that one. 
---
Honestly, I’m not sure. I tried sending video with a report once and gave up after like 2 seconds.
---
Lmao sounds about right. 
---
Incoming (gray) message was from killer to a member of a SWF group. Good call on the human maggot thing though.
---
No tunnelling usually what will happen if I get caught and hooked after this kind of long looping. But a killer wouldn't have to resort to that if they didn't have that tunnel vision of just going after one survivor for multiple gens. 
---
the addons that increase phase walk running speed and the addons that decrease phase walk charge time are good, like the hair comb and the shoes.
---
Someone calling you a tunneler when they are the one who lived the game and you actually didn't tunnel and tried to go for the rescuer when someone unhooked. 
---
Mostly the framerate really messes her up. Harder to track people while fatigued, can't pull off some more godly flicks that great pc players can do, etc. While survivors on console can do anything that a PC player can do. But yeah I still think with all of that, Nurse is still the most viable
---
The Spirit’s older brother 
---
why
---
You still have to hit it. It’s called a SKILL check. A mori takes no skill 
---
If anyone, survivor or killer, runs any Obsession perk, someone will be the obsession and this will happen. It can be OoO or D-Strike, Rancor, Dying Light, etc. 
---
That’s so stupid... the exact reason why doing a gen with more people should be faster is because they aren’t doing 2 separate ones
---
Again, what are you crying about here? And you literally titled the video "tunneled by daylight" then in this comment admitted you weren't actually tunneled in the video you posted
---
lmfao
---
And the poor english. 
---
Yes, the new bee killer's pee is a new type of in-game currency. Once you accumulate enough, BHVR listens to all of your balance suggestions for the game, writes them on a piece of paper and lets bees pee on them.
---
When a survivor is being camped and instead of doing gens the whole team crouches behind something trying to get the save until the person dies
---
Killers with bad internet
---
Killers that camp the first person hooked ( I get it if it's the obsession but most of the time it's not)
---
Survivors who wont leave when the exit gates are open ( hopefully the devs will make a perk in the future that counters that)
---
When I'm in a chase and I'm running to a pallet and another team mate slams the pallet down in front of me giving the killer a hit.
---
When I am in a long chase and not one gen has been done.
---
Ugh thank you. It’s been bothering me for a little while and I couldn’t find any answers online :’D 
---
**Platform:** PC
---
**Type:** Visual
---
**Description:** Dropping a pallet and stunning the killer mid chase results in the survivor not having a walking/running animation and instead hover with their idle animation.
---
**Screenshots:** Don't have any
---
**Steps to reproduce:** Get stunned by a survivor. Happens a lot more frequently when getting stunned while reving up Hillbilly's chainsaw
---
**Reproduction rate:** I would say thre is a 1/10 chance every stun. Around 3/10 when charging up your chainsaw.
---
It was a feature during the howling grounds but people complained
---
You being so salty about a random person on youtube says alot about your opinion.
---
Honestly think DC's are worse
---
Counter point- refresh your dailies. They don't have a great excuse for d/cing but you outright admit to going for a daily that you're bad at with an ability people d/c over. Even if d/c was punished, no punishment would be a good deterrent because people already cater their d/c to specific situations. For instance, I could d/c every time I get legion as a hard rule and any punishment would be a slap on the wrist because I hardly see legion anyways. People would consider it worth the trade.
---
This is how it's been for ages now, it's only with the most recent patch that they've actually shown it as a slower action (previously it wasn't because of bugs).
---
What's wrong with that? It is a form of tunnelling. It's not like I intentionally loping him. I've made a couple of attempts to get away and it's not until the end that he stopped tunnelling my ass. 
---
Doctor and Trapper can just turn into m1 killers though at high ranks. Like yeah you found them, good luck ending the chase though. Not really fun imo. Billy and nurse, while strong, never feel op because of how strong survivors are, and the skill cap of nurse is always fun to me because I always feel like I'm getting better with her
---
U probably rite
---
Really now?
---
Her crouch ability is meant it ambush survivors but it's evident it's Pig as soon as you spawn in due to Jigsaw Boxes.
---
It could be used to mindgame but the loss of TR and obvious crouch animation along with the roar of the ambush attack makes it almost impossible to mindgame anyone, especially if they use an exhaustion perk as you activate it.
---
Her RBT are essentially game slowers and don't normally kill unless you have them trapped endgame and force follow them without chasing
---
Other than that, she's essentially just a 115% M1 killer
---
Yes? That is not what it means to be tunneled 
---
PS I couldn't find a version of the vine without the watermark
---
There's a clear difference between bolting back to the hook before the unhooked person has any chance to do something and coming across a player multiple times in your regular patrol. One is tunneling while the other is how games are supposed to work.
---
Where is this definition of actions in games are made if it's not because players make it themselves? 
---
I'd get it if he just chased me for like 1 or 2 gens but being a Stalker this long I will call you a Stalker or tunneler. I didn't find this fun, you know. I knew that if I got caught, I'd definitely get camped to death. 
---
So it wasn’t your choice to continue to chase the same survivor for that whole time? Or did the game make you?
---
Lol it's my reality every day but I'll tell you what I'll do I'll start keeping a log as of tonight and report back with the results just for you lol
---
For some reason , this reminds me of scps.
---
Nah this is impossible, this person looks attractive. There's no way it's Nea
---
Players did make this definition. Just because your widdle feelings wanna change it doesn't make it not so

---
thanks epic gamer man
---
Again, **that is not the definition of tunneling and never has been**
---
Tunneling in DBD has always meant focusing down and re-hooking one person until they die, ignoring other players.
---
It has never, not once, meant losing a long chase against one player. ffs running around the killer for 3 gens is what you want to do as a survivor!
---
Solid mid tier killer. Great at countering a lot of loops, but struggles with map pressure.
---
Then what is the meaning? Oh wise one
---
I'd rather smash Piggy
---
Stop responding to the same comment multiple times. I explained it to you in another reply
---
6...
---
Oh God why
---
Yeah, I only get the cells for cosmetics.
---
Joey’ll have to pass them onto bill so he can give them to Louis
---
Just fps cap. Maybe playing in exclusive fullscreen mode is a factor.
---
If the OP means survivors who sit at the exit T-bagging and trying to bait killer over to just rub it in that they won before losing I would say that is toxic as it's just poor sportsmanship, but I do agree the OP needs to be clearer on what they think toxic play is. 
---
*Louis bloodweb
---
Okay yeah, that sounds like a biggo cunt move lmao
---
Me when I pickup an event lantern 
---
It’s literally the same thing, if say you caught that survivor and hooked him and he got saved you would still continue to chase the same guy, the fact that you are making an excuse about you not being able to catch someone then getting called out by that guy for tunneling him you’re salty about it 
---
Its speculated (as to my knowledge no real evidence, only "victims" word) that he asked them for nudes and then if they didn't he would ban/remove them or shit talk them in his discord.
---
6 and Resurrection...why??
---
Just as bad  :(
---
I can never find the immersed players without it, and I'm so used to it now. Plus, Pig used to have a smaller terror radius than tier 3 Whispers, and I used that as a tool to set up ambushes.

But that's never what the term tunneling meant. It has always in its usage referred to victimizing one person in particular to get them out of the game.

That is not what's happening when the survivor leads the killer on a multi-gen chase. That's what you want to do.
---
Tunneling is something negative that the killer does to a survivor, it is not something the survivor causes the killer to do that's good  for the survivor team.
---
Like, I guess if the community wants to change the term, okay. But that's never what it meant historically 
---
Early days, noed can be a pretty big power swing for you, but I wouldn't recommend using it long term. It can be easy to get reliant on a perk like that, and beyond low ranks people will shittalk you ever game that it triggers. Your other perks are alright, I'm personally fond of Brutal Strength as it helps you gain a bit of time in a chase when you need to break pallets, and wastes less time when you damage gens.
---
For Trapper it's best to watch some video guides on him. In low ranks you can basically drop a trap obviously under a pallet and survivors won't think and run through it, but as you get higher it's a struggle just to keep traps from being disarmed. There's also a lot of points on maps to learn where traps are really difficult to spot (sometimes even sinking into terrain) that can be incredibly powerful.
---
In terms of survivor, if you're on console or willing to buy more DLC, I'd really recommend Feng. Her perks are very strong, or help out a fair bit while you're inexperienced. Alert grants constant information to you, Lithe is like Sprint Burst but with better control and doesn't force you to walk everywhere in order to keep it from going off, and Technician helps if you fuck up skill checks occasionally.
---
I'd recommend progressively working through survivors. If you're against Claudette (like a decent human being should be) Dwight or Quentin is probably a good start until you have the Bond or Pharmacy teachable in order to avoid being injured all match. Levelling one survivor at a time lets you build up their teachables, then the next survivor will just be adding 3 perks to the pool. It's cool to keep them individual, but overall it will weaken your builds and limit your choice if you don't have the chance at specific perks appearing. Remember you CAN avoid a teachable and acquire it later if you don't feel having it in other bloodwebs is a benefit (like Vigil for instance)
---
ok
---
This is why I Main Legion and Doctor. Ain’t nobody got time to find Solid Snake Crawldette doing the fusion dance with the Bamboo on Yamoka estate. 
---
I have and I am thoroughly disgusted
---
Are you complaining about getting a safety pip for hooking one survivor? Really? A survivor pretty much has to escape while doing multiple saves and generators to even barely get a safety pip
---
Found it. Thanks!
---
Chasing one person the majority of a match is never what the term meant. It has always in its usage referred to victimizing one person in particular to get them out of the game, because that was the negative aspect of tunneling. The survivor is inherently incapable of competing in the match.
---
That is not what's happening when the survivor leads the killer on a multi-gen chase. That's what you want to do as survivor.
---
all I see are a bunch of squares what is that
---
I mean, something is still edgy even if something else is edgier
---
Historically? are you serious? Look anywhere tunneling is when you focus on one person plain and simple no matter of the circumstances 
---
but like it was barely edgy at all
---
Platform: PC
---
Type: Visual (I Guess)
---
Description: Survivor Health status not showing correct information. When hooking a survivor their health status will show them having died on hook meanwhile a random other survivor who is on full health will have the hook bar beneath their health status
---
Steps to reproduce: No Idea has happened three times at random in the last two days, does however have something to do with hooking a character for I think the second time.
---
Fairly certain the fix was just visual but I could be wrong.
---
Well, it's not even really  that. Like, when someone loses me in the corn or something like that, I still think it's really cool! And, yeah, I know that if they DID act like slasher movie victims, it'd be pretty weighted in my direction, so that's fair. The other side is I have played survivor a few times, and think it's an excellent horror experience, although I imagine you're more 'productive' not treating it that way.
---
That's just simply untrue. Like, that is blatantly false.
---
it satisfies the common definition of edgy
---
Actually it is true, you historical comments are blatantly false, you are just trying to use the term historically to make your horrible points seem correct and factual 
---
Name-calling.  Nice.
---
And no, I believe I'm not the only one who thinks tunnelling should cover any attempt to relentlessly chase one and only one survivor.  
---
Lmao same 
---
600 bp &gt; all my friends 
---
lmao
---
One time I brought a survivor to the nearest hooks which were in the basement. The moment I got to the bottom of the stairs they DCed

His final smash will make the opponent fall asleep from boredom so he can kill them.
---
 I stopped reading at killers are underpowered 
---
im flattered you took the time to comment
---
Okay, what am I supposed to do, go into the corner and count to twenty? I know where at least two of them are, and they unhooked in my terror radius without borrowed time.
---
They're knly 16 aka 3 years younger then him. It's not right to ask nudes, yet there are so many couples irl from people who are 16 and 19, so calling him a pedo is nonsense imo
---
So do a ton of people, nothing to be sorry about. It pisses Canadians off though haha.
---
Tunnel visioned? Sure. Not really tunneling though.
---
you think the reason for the DC's is BBQ?
---
That’s cool why would we read a very long review you made on the game 
---
They had to long trials to much work :(
---
Seeing as they have trouble on PS4/Xbox, which are more powerful than Switch, I highly doubt it'll run any better.
---
I would certainly say Hag is better than Trapper. She has 10 traps off the bat and doesn't need to collect them in order to set them. Her traps can only be countered by crouch walking when you know where they are, or shining a flashlight on them, which means they're far harder to mess with than Trappers.
---
Rather than trapping/holding/injuring, her traps allow her to teleport and instantly be in a chase, meaning you're rewarded the more you predict where survivor will run to in a chase.
---
Overall I'd certainly say she's more *consistant* than Trapper and she always has pressure on the map. Even just dropping a trap under a hooked survivor either allows you to teleport when an unhook occurs, or at the very least waste 10 extra seconds as they slowly crouch for an unhook. New players also won't get it, and they'll trigger the trap 9 times out of 10.
---
She has the perk Hex: Ruin which, personally I avoid because it's destroyed so early in a majority of games that it does nothing except waste a perk slot, but many others swear by as the only way they feel like they can play killer.
---
Her major downsides are she's slower than Trapper, so you have to get used to placing lots of traps well and using them in a chase, or you'll waste more time chasing regularly than you should, and all of her unique perks are hexes, meaning they're able to be destroyed and while they're strong, they're essentially on a timer.
---
Well they all had Decisive Strike so...

I don't get upset at this.   And honestly if I'm getting farmed I appreciate you denying the farmer their safe unhook points.

Killers are in the best spot they ever been and i see that some people will complain about everything until they will get easy 4k 5 gen games every time. 
---
That is a punishable offense on PSN. Don't hesistate to report it if it happens to you! :)
---
GTX 1060 gets me solid 58fps+ almost all the time on 4k res with 60% render resolution, medium settings. Your 1080 should be able to handle 60 even at 1440p. If you have RTSS you should check if your GPU or CPU hit 99% usage to see if either of those is a bottleneck.
---
basement ?
---
I think I have a solution. Don't play Legion. It sounds like this is the common denominator to your DCing issue. Fortunately there are 11, soon to be 12 other killers that you can play to your hearts content. I understand you clearly favour Legion but the bulk of the community feels differently so perhaps it would be best just to shelf him for the time being and try your hand at someone different :)
---
Hayato 
---
I'm on PC. I did end up reporting the three and checked their steam profiles. According to the comments on them, that wasn't the first time they did it. Probably not the last. Hopefully they're either already banned or will get banned soon.
---
Man, this sub. I just love the lack of creativity. "But if I don't tunnel that means I have to go hide in a corner and not play." What?
---
The clear and obvious answer is you down the person who just did the unhook (maybe stopping to down the unhooked person to prevent the save bonus). When someone unhooks in this situation they are announcing that they are a terrible player and you've won the game. At that point you get to decide whether to win by being an ass to the person who got screwed over by their teammate or whether to win by not being an ass. 
---
While she's certainly not up there with the Billys and the Nurses, Amanda isn't terrible since the buffs. You can use Whispers to sneak up on survivors without sacrificing your 115% for map traversal (just crouch as soon as the icon lights up) and with her best addons (medical file and tape- a brown and a yellow!) you can usually get the dash hit even on sprint burst users. If the RNG doesn't screw you over, the traps usually buy you enough time. Amanda's also quite short even when standing, which lets her mindgame some normally safe loops such as the rocks at gas haven or Yamaoka residence.
---
It's also worth noting the Pig doesn't really have any broken addons unlike most killers, so she rarely gets unfair flashy stomps. It's probably one of the reasons she tends to land low in rankings, along with the RNG factor and pretty significant reliance on skill.
---
I see what you are saying now, you didn’t clarify very well in your original post
---
With maybe only one gen on the 3rd floor, that way the killer wouldn't be too spread thin.
---
that's how i imagine the wraith's stun noise looks like
---
Not really I’ve had games where I’ll pop out 3 gens save 2 not escape and barely safety pip as a survivor 
---
My favourite part was when the guy on the gene decided to let you get all the way up to the gen before running away.
---
Actually no it was when the bill ran in a straight line away from you keeping line of sight.
---
Accurate blinks I'll give you that but Jesus they made it easier than it needed to be.
---
I completely agree. I’m a Survivor main and if I’m facing the doctor,  I could be the floor above or below him and quite far away yet I’ll still be in his terror radius. You never know where he’s coming from.
---
I always thought I was weird for liking the Wraith and Daddy Myers most of 'em all. It's good to know I'm among equally weird people in this sub.
---
maybe read the post
---
Doesn't count, unless we're saying every map is two floors....
---
Definetely agree!! And that's why I can't stand it when people say Ochido is not funny as if it's a fact. It's still comedy, though obviously not everyone will like it. Just like I don't find Ardetha funny; But that doesn't mean he think he's unfunny
---
If they change legion hopefully they will let other perks actually work with their kit. The Bleed mechanic can be pretty dumb from time to time. However its like unique and has a lot of potential.
---
Although I'd prefer being stabbed multiple times than chainsawed or blinked on.
---
you can directly counter it either by entering a locker before the hook or faking out your direction though
---
With multiple spawns so it's not always in the same spot sure.
---
Yeah. Honestly this game just has too many possibilities for dick moves, so even prepping you gotta weigh your options. I pretty much always skip the mori daily because it's not worth my trouble.
---
True, yet you will still be surprised by how many adults don't have any form of respect. Especially on political facebook pages lol
---
But this is info swf already has...
---
And I meant that you can't perform a hatch grab on a downed survivor, i.e. a crawling one, belly in the grass and all. ;)
---
If the killer would let the survivor get back up by dropping them one too many times, yes, he could hatch grab them again once they're back on their feet, but the stun would allow the survivor to easily reach the hatch first.
---
It has counterplay but it (along with Ruin) are the two "mandatory meta perks" for a reason.
---
Just wondering are u still working on it? 
---
Just take my upvote.
---
Have you tried crate of gears since they fixed it?
---
*DC noise while camera still rotates around own character*
---
That pic is making me upseti spaghetti 
---
double xp is different from double blood points so ?????????
---
It was fixed about 6 months ago, right? Most of my time playing pig came after that.
---
well at least NOED can be cleansed or if you have a good team disabled before the last gen is even done.. UNLIKE DS which is for suvivors who suck at looping to get another chance to escape and used by good players to might get caught out of position another chance to loop the killer again for 5 mins. 
---
and don't say dribbling.. that's a shitty work around that is pointless if you don't down them near a hook. Only thing you can do is eat the DS. 
---
Early tunneling. Camping sucks too but at least it's clear what to do: stay up on the hook or do gens. tunneling though is the killer pretending to let you actually play the game then going "gotcha." It's frustrating as hell.
---
As killer the only thing I hate is when I screw up against a good swf team. Swf is the only time killers are at a disadvantage and messing up just compounds on it. Survivors quitting early is another I suppose, although it's simple enough to just hook everyone else twice and then let them all escape. Sometimes they don't get it though and don't work gens after I'm clearly done hooking people, or they don't go for the save despite me literally running to the other side of the map. Then again enough killers are shitty about early DCs that I can't exactly blame survivors for not trusting me.
---
Jesus Christ wtf lol
---
Wooden horse and spoon are my favourites xD So I would be happy xD
---
It takes 44 seconds for 2 survivors to do a gen.
---
80 seconds for 1 person.
---
How is there a penalty? 
---
I just imagine you might get tampered timer to work more often with crate/bag of gears since they increase time to search.
---
Seeing him coming from the distance like that is fucking horrifying, oh my god...
---
ya I just checked with task manager open and my gpu would usually stay around 75% and cpu would stay just under 3.6 at 20%
---
Im talking about stun blink. Ive done it before and have true talent do it aswell.
---
No one uses a 5 blink Nurse. It's gen rush suicide. I Nurse main and I've never done it.
---
0 logic
---
you cry about not being able to use perk when everyone DC's? theres no waste at all lul
---
if you'd talk about add ons..legit feels but a perk.. c'mon..new lobby and there you go
---
You’re right, but I usually find more success running tampered with rules set. You’re not very likely to get a head pop either way, but if you run tampered with crate they can just get it off before a gen even gets done and not have to worry about the timer at all. If they want to do that with rules set, they have to waste a considerable amount of time looking around the map for jigsaw boxes.
---
Ive only experianced this while healing but its a problem. It just randomly ends like if the person being heal had pressed the run button. It can fail skill checks and often stops right before someone is fully healed. Ive played in swf games and can confirm its not just people trying to run away
---
Unlike you I play the game for fun
---
Killer got dsed and survivors got NOEDed
---
You should report that killer mate, if a killer chases you for more than 30 seconds it's bannable 
---
keep calling out these virgin tunnelers 
---
I approve this.
---
Makes it faster to down people 
---
&gt; Because I feel like Hex Ruin just forces me to spend the first ten minutes of a match looking for a totem. 
---
well you can get good and learn to land your greats. Skill checks are client side so you can save your excuse "b-b-b-but Lag". 
---
Fantastic. And great perk! 
---
It would be trapper
---
doctors tracking is so ridiculously good that after i mained him for a while i went back to trapper and had no clue where any of the survivors were. it took them getting down to the last 3 gens before i started being able to find/hunt them effectively 
---
can confirm i constantly sing the jingle and it always works
---
Ebony mori overpowered? Please do tell why. 
---
bubba is the GOAT when it comes to over zealous squads and thats how 90% of swf's play. the second you get someone on a hook you can guarantee that sweet chainsaw is coming out to down a few bodyblockers 
---
And were you not chased at all? Because if they were safe saves thats minimum 3 silvers unless something terrible went wrong
---
It's not an agree to disagree issue, you're just wrong in your definition.
---
Tunneling is being gone after repeatedly, hook after hook, in an attempt to kill that player first. What you're showing us is a chase sequence, not tunneling.
---
I mean, by your definition you'd have to tell us how long a chase can go for before the Killer just has to look at his watch and say "Well, time to leave **the only guy I've seen in the last four minutes** just walk away".
---
Also, I find it rather silly that you're complaining about free pallet stun bp.....
---
Really?  Never knew that.
---
Alright, blame the killer, saying they're being an ass for furthering their goal instead of the farming survivor that screwed you over in the first place by unhooking you seconds after the killer hooked you, without borrowed time, and they don't even try to take the hit and instead leave you for dead.
---
I prioritize gens over unhooking. If I'm half way done and you're across the map and you get hook.. too bad so sad for you, you can wait. the amount of people I've had try to kobe in my face when I've run across the map or wait until i'm about there, force struggle and die on hook. I'm don't do the Ultra-Altruism, i'll get ya when I get ya if I can. 
---
You're not my real dad, don't tell me what to do.
---
Don't use Decisive and don't wiggle and the Killer will think you have it and dribble.
---
TBH I stopped using it on any Survivor after last Halloween simply because I see no appeal in a one use Perk that can be countered easily if I'm being stupid.
---
Which I am, someone help me. Entity take the wheel.
---
I’ve had games like that yes, where my friends get chased and I pop 3 gens and save them as they get hooked. At most that’s roughly 9000 blood points which I’ve seemed to notice you need atleast 12,000 plus blood points 
---
Thanks for the info. I thought it was [Number of generators left] = [Number of survivors alive] - 1
---
So I was running around with 3 gens left to be done with all 4 survivors looking for the hatch.
---
It is.  You don't get to decide what other players feel is a particular action directed to them.
---
That's what I call hardcore tunnelling.  What will happen usually after this kind of long chase, killers get so salty that they'll just either facecamped or proximity camped then hardcore tunnelling the guy until death.  Let's not pretend this doesn't happen frequently these days.
---
Free pallet stun BP?  I tried to sneak away but of course I am not going to let the killer to get any closer to me if possible.  It doesn't mean I had fun doing it.  I knew what could happen if I get downed.
---
Fuck all of you Billy is super cute
---
But then they just run up to you stop running and slice you normally!
---
It seems as though you are almost unfamiliar with the entire meaning of the term, as you're only seeing the end result of successful tunneling. 
---
On the DbD forums and the Steam community both, there are several meanings to the term tunneling. However, the one aspect that is almost always agreed upon is that *tunneling* is when you chase one survivor and one survivor only, no matter the outcome of the chase, whether you kill them or not. 
---
That being said, if you choose to chase *one* survivor for the duration of the completion of 3 generators, you *did* tunnel that survivor for that amount of time, whether they escaped or not. 
---
Perhaps you should stop making assumptions about what the entire community at large thinks.
---
Seriously?
---
You get hit twice, consistently, without going near a window or pallet?
---
Against good survivors it doesn't though lol
---
You'll just get pallet looped and you'll be forced to use your ability which ultimately makes healing useless. 
---
You find healing 1000 times in a single match fun? 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Doc gives me genuine fear when I'm against him
---
Thanks for the advice will try it!
---
Some fun u are
---
The only time I feel bad about using a Mori is when I get a three man game or BPS gets offered. Other than that I have no problems.
---
As a survivor I really don't mind at all. Ups the stakes a bit.
---
Okay that made me laugh take my fake internet point
---
As a survivor, I find huntress lullaby to be a clever little perk. I think the main benefit is that most survivors ignore lullaby for more of the time (unless, of course, they stumble upon the hex totem) than ruin bc it doesn't immediately stop them from doing their objective. Survivors will go hunting for the ruin totem right away. Lullaby starts screwing you over pretty late in the game, when it's more crucial to stay hidden and finish those last couple of gens. Unlike ruin it's a slow-down for later in the game, and it doubles as a survivor-finder when those gens pop. I always respecc a killer who uses lullaby bc it changes it up.
---
I agree, when I play Spirit, I notice that it is easier to get sacrifices than some other killers. I also like technician perk and iron will.
---
not if you play good and use the Zero cd build
---
No you use it when your already injured. The killer won’t swing once it knows you have it, that’s why it’s only works one time a match usually. Rarely are you in a place to where it’ll allow you to get to a pallet.
---
You commented so you cared a little. 
---
Yeah no.
---
Only a killer main would say this BS. 9 out of 10 games against legion, there are more survivors left if they hide and heal first before doing more gens. 
---
As soon as you realise they have spirit fury you would be an idiot to not drop it early. 
---
You should report it and maybe they will investigate it. When they had the loss of progress on PC, I talked to the devs at NYCC and in a week I got my progress back.
---
P3 Claudette’s are a cheat code, they deserve to be camped.
---
A lot of tunnelling accusations are invalid imho. It's not my problem if a survivor is bad at stealth or has a team mate unhook then under my nose.
---
Omg whispers it probably the most annoying perk for me.
---
Keep ruin and monitor and abuse. Ruin is obvious and monitor and abuse is great on the hag. She has a 24 meter radius and it makes it 16 which let's you sneak up on survivors. If you find that you reach end games a lot then keep noed but personally I'd replace noed with nurses calling. Most survivors don't heal in your radius because they expect it but with monitor and abuse you can reach them and at that point it's too late for them unless they're at a pallet. Make your choice is amazing on hag especially when combined with mint rag and rusty shackles. But you can replace it with bbq for the map knowledge and control+blood points. 
---
Fuck it, you clearly dont understand what I'm saying.
---
Thanks for downvoting all of my comments too, appreciate it
---
I think my issue with it is that it changes the aspect of the game where it favors one side heaivly compared to the other. Survivors don't really have anything like that against monsters. And to me they just aren't fun to me, it's less, "wow I'm skill full" and more "wow this is tedious". And I don't really feel that way with any other hex. But that may just be me I guess 
---
It's a shitty situation for the person getting farmed, yeah, but the killer doesn't owe you a free pass for getting farmed. If you get sacrificed, move on to the next game, take solace in the fact that games with a farmer usually end in a 4K anyway and you got out of there early. As for bloodpoints, you probably didn't get that much for the game, but you were probably only in there for a few minutes. At least you can leave immediately and get on to the next game. If a killer gets stomped, they're stuck there for the whole shebang.
---
Nah I’m always like “muhuahaha didn’t see that shit coming did ya meg?!”
---
"Hide"
---
found the rank 20
---
Interesting I’m a Xbox main as well. Anything you want to discuss I’m up for. In terms of community, I find more friendly survivors as a survivor than as a killer.
---
Rofl... it slows the game down better not try do gens at all and go do it is kinda the exact idea behind the totem. 1 person hunting gives the killer more time to do things.
---
Hnnnng gotta. Cleanse. Totems. 
---
"not if you're good and use franks mixtape, no cd, ebony, tunnel everyone off hook"
---
Devotion 20? Yeah sounds about right. /brag
---
I have the problem of getting hit farther away than that lol. Sometimes it is because of killer connection and causes me to rubber-band.
---
We were obviously talking about during blinks. It doesn't happen often, but I have seen it where it looks like the stun registers when I throw down a pallet.
---
yeah but you can tell if the icons still up when your far enough from the hook and its still lit, so you can immeadiately come back anyway
---
Because you only have to do it once. 
---
if you really are devotion 20 that's not something to brag about sweetie. For you to be devotion 20 you'd have to play 24/7
---
Angrypug isnt even devotion 10 and he plays this game every day for 7+ hours lol 
---
never said anything about any of those things except Cold Dirt and Joeys....maybe check your eyes...
---
I said play good
---
Lol  Are you assuming God’s gender? Lol jk. She can really be good if you know how to use her. I’m just not there yet.
---
Was just leaving the end screen of a game. When I got back to the menu the logo was pulsing at me threateningly and then when it vanished nobody was home :')
---
I'm so good
---
Spirit allows to some insane mind games, so nice to just stand there and watch as the Survivors don't know what to do!
---
can u people stop saying shit like this without explaining how
---
My duude. I’m sorry but you got it wrong. The notification shows up 20 meters away from YOU, the survivor throwing the rock. The killer gets the notif from anywhere on the map. 
---
Proxy camping and Definitely tunneling. When I’m running away and instead of going for someone else you come after me because I’m a one hit, down... it really frustrates me to no end. What defense do I have? And when I’m not the obsession and you still do it, that just makes me wonder who made you so mad in life. It’s the start of the game and I didn’t even get to do ANYTHING. So I get a little crabby. It happened to me twice, once it was a clown and then it was a trapper.  But a nice game with a Legion after that made it much better. 
---
Wait seriously? Oh damn thank you so much for telling me that, guess this post is useless now
---
Every day we stray further from the Entity's light.
---
Hexy or I think that's his name is a gay ass dick head, thats all ima say
---
You are welcome Nea.

Yeah np dude. Might wanna delete the post just sayin...

Okay see you I’m gonna delete it lol
---
I suck at Billy but I'm getting a hang of the maneuvering with his chainsaw. He's so faaaaast
---
Maybe if you're bad at nurse
---
Alright have fun!
---
That's fair haha
---
You too
---
If you play a game for a while it's not going to be scary 99% of the time, even if DBD is marketed as horror.
---

Yeah tunneling is very basically having tunnel vision on one person.

Because gamers are assholes.

Can the emergency Medkit let you heal twice or just once

Because one would assume that 2 people on a generator would make it take 80 seconds. It still gets done faster, but doing two individual generators takes less than doing two generators together.

There are multiple things on both ends that make the game less fun, though typically it is weighted in favor of Killer due to the nature of the game.

Nah he commented because it’s a post filling up the subreddit. You can camp whoever you want, you don’t have to tell the whole world.

You don't really need to know because tier 3 Spirit Fury only makes you break 2 pallets. That, in combination with brutal strength and enduring is a good Anti-Looping build (+ something like bamboozle).

I DC’d cause I went from rank 1 to rank 10 and had a lag switching LF who I 100% know wasn’t a rank 1 before the reset. I’d rather have sweaty then cheaters

I’m actually very similar; followed the game since beta, picked it up recently, and enjoy Trapper the most. Make sure to leave 1 trap set in the killer shack, either right underneath the window or in the grass by one of the doors. A lot of times survivors will predict it, but if the trap is armed, they won’t be able to loop at the shack. If they do try to loop there, they’re screwed. It’s really not worth it to put traps underneath hooked survivors, but placing them hidden nearby is worth it sometimes. Predict which way they’ll try to flee to when they get unhooked, and trap it. When they do get off, try to drive them that way.

When your the worst Killer in DBD so you try to assert your dominance to *OVERLOAD*.
