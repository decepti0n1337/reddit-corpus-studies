Getting killer ones out of the way before I have to do them and cry endlessly
---
---
---
What kinda of Tom fuckery is this?
---
Time for other killers to shine
---
How do you farm a teammate off the hook?
---
Hmm I wouldn’t use Freddy I use BBQ, Ruin, PGTW, Nurses calling
---

---
I love playing Freddy no heal Thanatophia, Sloppy, ruin and nurses
---
Not to mention that survivors in on-hit speed boost pass through killers. No collision on the killer has been in since the game first came out.
---
I brought dead hard , spine chill, prove thyself, dark sense and a green toolbox w/ instructions and a BNP. I did it against a ruin hag too lol 😂
---
[Dev Update](One of the main talking points is the difficulty of the first Tome. The first level of this Tome is fairly easy to complete, often taking only one match to complete a given challenge. This was an intentional decision by our team; we wanted to make sure that this level served as an introduction to The Archives so everyone could get an understanding of how the feature works.)

You did it with training wheels on, now prepare to put a little bit of effort into challenges.
---
Well I believe a lot of killers need buffs. There’s too many mediocre and bad killers. 
---
But yes I believe true is very one sided on his opinion and that he has bad opinions.
---
I'm fine with most of the changes. The only one I had a problem with was that they added a visible window vault animation. Since she has no more phase collision, she should keep the phasing over windows. I'm fine with the other  changes, it's just the vault one I do not like.
---
You say that, but I’ve seen far dumber things said here without a hint of sarcasm or irony. Some people genuinely believe your average Rank 15 game is an accurate demonstration of standard gameplay. It’s troubling.
---
You've clearly never played Freddy on Lerys or the Game, at any given time you'll have at least 2-3 survivors able to hit that fat yeet on your back
---
Same I’m doing the unhook currently
---
The art style is adorable and the messages of the comics are positive. Empathy is something that the world needs more of, and not just in the sense of the Claudette perk. ;)
---
The spirit has scratch marks, breathing, injured moans, and grass moving. Survivors have literally nothing to help them know where the spirit is, adding one tell for survivors would do so much. But right now spirit is just a guessing game for survivors.
---
You've got like 7 weeks to do the challenges. Can you not complain and just do the challenges? Or just pay for the rift if you're so impatient
---
Definitely did NOT get gutted at all. If anything I don’t think this will fix the actual problem people had with her. Which was that she wasn’t fun to play against and had no counterplay. Survivors still have no way of telling when she’s using her power and where she is while using it. It’s still a guessing game and she’s still S tier
---
me during killer dailies on tome 4: Okay, this is great
---
me during survivor dailies on tome 4: OH MY GOD IM GONNA FUCKING UNINSTALL IM SICK OF THIS BULLSHIT UNFUN GAME I JUST WANT SOMETHING FUN D; THIS IS BORING AND UNFAIR GOD DAMN IT *Throws brick at monitor*
---
I bet your wondering, what’s in the canister
---
yeah man
---
Yup
---
They should change all the Ultra Rare skins that were just giveway codes to Rare and put all the other Ultra Rare and Event cosmetic pieces in the Store.
---
THAT would be sick
---
Absolutely spot on mate
---
I was literally thinking about that scene, thanks.

Scott is def the person i agree with. 
---
Tru3 trys his best to prove spirit is balanced, but the guy literally just posted a video on a game he played on stream against a spirit, "Counter playing the spirit again, again, again~"
---
I watched the video to see whats up, And i shit you not, he got chased for like 45 secs THE ENTIRE GAME. the guy uploads shit like this where he just does gens or gets lucky, simple as that.
---
(also, yes he did die.)
---
We both love and hate their game’s mechanics.
---
Like I said very rare.
---
Plot twist he is the new survivor
---
I'm just asserting my opinion nobody cares about just chill man
---
i'm so mad about how hard i laughed at this
---
Some people here on reddit said that the entity promised her revenge on her father if she starts killing. Don’t know if that’s actually true though.
---
Yah she should keep it
---
[removed]
---
It’s part of yakamoa family map
---
Paying for the gift would do absolutely nothing? I don't see how that would help at all.
---
Cattle Decap rules dude
---
XD SAME
---
A lot of people liked them for them being unique and only available to those who participated and earned it in their respective events. But now that everyone will have them come chapter 14 its just a common now. 
---
Nothing about wearing them strokes the ego of a player, good or bad, friend. Though some might make you more visible.
---
No, I just don’t face her like ever so I’m big sad
---
Literally just play wraith with the addon that makes his bell silent/sound distant and the brown one that hides your red stain and terror radius for 6 seconds after decloak.
---
Decloak behind a wall near gen, they wont know direction/hear anything and wont see you decloak and wont hear terror radius. You now have 6 seconds to go for the grab
---
Just thought the same
---
All the puke
---
No0b3 he is survivor main, but plays killers too.
---
I wasn’t trying to sound sarcastic I thought it was a smart play did you know that key was and the hatch but I feel bad for that other teammate
---
I'm sorry can you say that a little louder for the people in the back? Thank you.
---
What I don’t get is the idea that just because someone is older than you or related to you that they’re entitled to your respect. That shit it just dumb
---
Yeah I was annoyed when I saw it. The sudden jump in difficulty felt a bit jarring. I mean I'll still do all of it, but it feels like I'm on tome III
---
Yeah but when the fuck will they get thier hotboxes working ffs
---
Passive agressive shitpost against spirit mains who are of the opinion of "spirit is balanced" or "the game NEEDS a strong killer" because killers flip their shit when any changes come their way, but nobody cares about survivors being changed.
---
But I don't want that, neither do the devs
---
wait wut
---
Should add Overwhelming Presence just so the flashlight burns out faster. Just to add on another layer.
---
 No, I'm not saying the audience is naive kids. I'm saying that maybe some of the people scammed were kids. Have some empathy for those people. 
---
They're not spitting in the faces of those who were there in the beginning. The fact that you think that is stupid. How is it spitting in the faces of those who supported them when part of this decision was for those who lost those cosmetics due to save errors? Or the console players who never had the chance to get them to begin with? They are doing for everyone.
---
Sure, you spent money to go to cons and you spent time grinding for those events, that's great. I did it for the Lunar new year Huntress cosmetic. You know what BHVR did. Put in the store. Am I upset. No. Cause now the new players who came after get to have that awesome cosmetic too. 
---
Exclusive items are nice. But when it comes to the community, especially those who are getting scammed, those things aren't important anymore. The community is.
---
Yes.
---
So you're saying the main issue is that you cant see where the spirit is while she is phasing.
---
"the main issue of hillbilly is that he can 1hko with his chainsaw"
---
are you listening to yourself?
---
Im quite happy too, esp happy they nerfed the stupid lunge range build, made bad spirit players punch far above their weight class and get rewarded for bad reads.
---
Very very happy its not nearly as good
---
you’ll know if it is working if the beam tightens. Once you actually get the blind, you’ll get points for it and “killer blind” will appear
---
Well, at least he's not playing fortnite ; )
---
*is complete
---
Yeah, it became a punishment playing as Jason.
---
If they up consoles sensitivity up the same as pc i guess it would be okay but id get stomped by the pc players. All in all I’d gain absolutely nothing from it other than going against harder killers but I guess some people might like it.
---
Barely. She still has her standing still "mindgame."
---
Know what really sounds like a personal attack? Asking if someone has no life and calling someone else pathetic ;) have a good day man
---
Barely any mind games then
---
But it will be at a certain point that's for sure. At the same time the more dlc that comes out the harder it will be to get the perk you are hunting when it comes to them randomly picking perks. You either buy it or wait it out for the free. It's not a extremely abstract concept.
---
Is this sarcasm?
---
MuSt Be ThE hItBoXeS
---
But seriously I feel you meng
---
Just ONE mindgame. There’s multiple times where I play 10 games in a row without doing the window juke. Probably her weakest juke tbh
---
Well this perk is a bad idea just due to the fact that higher level players are always hitting great skill checks, and so this perk will contribute to gens going faster than the incredibly high speed already do at higher tier of play. Apart from that, it’s not that interesting of a perk, other perks tend to provide new avenues of gameplay. For example, Prove Thyself for example encourages finding teammates to stack on gens with, Dead Hard allows for players to extend chases with good timing, this in contrast feels empty.
---
Legion was just awful game design. He’s still awful.
---
Nurse is awful to play as now. I’ve barely seen any since the nerf. Yes she was op as hell before and her add ons were problematic, but with the stupid tokens a lot of people just dont find her fun to use.
---
Spirit got off lightly....for now. Window vault didnt need changing though.
---
Billy could use some changes, not gonna lie.
---
&gt;Pretty sure its near impossible to do it without buying tiers at this point in time, unless you PTB'd massively.
---
The pre-existing tiers weren't from the PTB, devs said it.
---
When will this update release, end off tome event or earlier, halloween just ended and I can't wait for spirit balances
---
The best spirits can find you based on grass movement and running sounds, there are also a handful of god tier spirits who can hear you breathing if they phase past you.
---
Wont affect the best of the best in any way but makes her harder to play, which is a step in the right direction
---
Honestly, the one that caused the biggest stir (and then everyone subsequently ignores now) is that 4 man SWF only survive 9% more than a solo survivor. All the people who cried that coordinated SWF was the reason they lost every game collectively cried, then blocked the information from their memory, and to this day still complain about 4 man SWF.
---
If you want every day to be christmas, then every day IS christmas
---
If you read the notes you’d see they said they aren’t able to tell who had legacy cosmetics and lost them in order to give them back. Might as well just give them out for free now seeing as that’s what they’ve done with all these ones.
---
Best Myers moment. Guy hiding behind pallet. Myers stares at him. He teabags. Evil within II pops. He continues to teabag. Evil within III pops, Myes kicks down pallet. Oh Shit says the guy. 5 second chase ensues. Guy goes down. Guy disconnects. Manic laughter ensues from me.
---
Yup. I wasn't expecting the challenges to take this long on tome II
---
I think you should wait until you can test the changes out in the PTB. I'm sure she will still be the god of mind games. You just may have to make a few adjustments. :)
---
hahah a lot of the time I curse too, but I’ve adapted my cursing from Otz so I insult the survivors 90% of the time j 
---
“you dumb little bitch”
---
Not really tbh her window mind games have worked out more then you think and then all the other times survivors just walk away so the window change was unnecessary
---
No player character can push another in this game.
---
You can mindgames loops with every other killer
---
Fuck yeah!
---
This shit happened to me with Gears 2. Order here and you get the special Kantus skin. Then everyone got the Kantus skin.
---
Luckily I learned early.
---
Killer Perk:  **Unspeakable Evil**- Death and disaster are unleashed from your presence alone. Every time you gain a tier of bloodlust, all vault locations that were within your terror radius at the time are blocked by the entity for (3/5/7) seconds or until you lose bloodlust.  This perk goes on cooldown for (60/50/40) seconds if you down a survivor, and the cooldown timer is paused during a chase.
---
Survivor Perk:  **Gotta Get Back**- You need to stop the spread of evil before it has a chance to start.  Receive an audio notification whenever the killer gains a token on one of their perks.  When the killer gains a token on one of their perks, their location (not aura) is revealed to you for (2/3/4) seconds.
---
Gotta say, fuck the survivors in this one. How many of those little shits ran up there just so they couldn’t be hooked back before the upstairs hook was added? I had many run up there to bleed out last year.
---
It’s karma, and before anybody asks no I never went up there as survivor knowing I was going down because it was cheap as hell.
---
EaT mY aSs
---
There doesnt need to be downsides to them? Theyre rare add ons? Killers are supposed to be strong? They removed downsides to a lot of killer add ons a while ago?
---
Oh boy, you have a rude awakening coming your way, bud.
---
100% agreed. As a frequent Spirit player, I even think a few minor changes would be fair. Remove collision and rework Prayer Beads, fine. 
---
But I think the vault animation (or lack of) needs to remain as it is. BHVR, can we address the aforementioned major complaints before completely reworking every bit that makes her unique? If we do that and she’s still OP then by all means, try it. 🤷‍♀️
---
Totally true I understand that. But the people without these cosmetics probably feel like they are being punished because they didnt play the game at a certain time like other players. I honestly dont care about survivor cosmetics. Especially just clothes but if it's not exclusive qnymore you arent really losing much. You should be flexing your achievements like levels and experience and hours played. Not cosmetics. Feels a bit like gatekeeping to me idk.
---
Shhh, don't tell them that! Let them think it was the collision.
---
She'll be fine.
---
Aww that's an adorable dynamic you two have. Has she tried playing the game herself?
---
They could learn from the experience, there's always second chances, but, still, if they keep on doing it they don't deserve an account.
---
That boy is beautiful
---
They said that all tiers earned since a certain date were transferred.
---
Git gud
---
Template by /u/ZombieHuggerr
---
Ruin, BBq, this killer's perk, and finally a personal pref. much loadout
---
OP:
---
You say she’s supposed to mind game, says who? You didn’t create the Spirit, so who is to say what her main purpose is. Only the Devs can say that.
---
The beads are overpowered as it’s not fair on the survivors - they had no way of knowing when she’s phasing and they get pulled off gens without any warning - that’s not fair and I’m happy they’ve made it global.
---
I know tell me about. Same with the idea that just because it's a trend amongst young kids, that it's "cool" or "funny". When really it's just dumb as fuck.
---
I like everything in this, iffy on the event cosmetics but i understand that it's the best way to give them to the people who lost them so it's whatev.
---
One question I'm wondering is the Meg Deathgarden mask. Will that ever come to console via deathgarden coming to console or is it lost in time forever or Will it eventually get released. I'm just curious about it
---
It doesn't run great on my laptop and getting a great skill check is already a pain because the little bar is choppy and seems like it skips, is it the same on switch?
---
I don't care about cosmetics. I'm doing the challenges to make the game more fun. And getting 20 gold emblems doesn't add anything fun to the game, it doesn't force you to change your build or play differently, it just gives more insensitive to sweat.
---
It's still a coinflip simulator for survivors, hell not even 50/50 since spirit has so many tells on where a survivor is compared to what a survivor has. These changes are needed but she still isn't fixed.
---
&gt; like if they wanted those skins they should've just played during the events?
---
Sure, I'll go back in time and let myself know to buy this game called "Dead by Daylight" because I'll become invested in it some months later so I can get event-exclusive skins.
---
Yeah I actually really like them removing collision, now they can't body block for each other at the end of the trial giving me more time to try to get more points
---
Thanks buddy :)
---
Keep crying. Spirit will still be strong.
---
If you press it while next to them even if they're running it'll stop them in the healing animation for a brief second then cancel since they're moving but it usually sends the message
---
And Spirit mains can still play the game fine.
---
Man it's almost like she's completely brain-dead to play and the people insisting that she needs to be able to hear pained grunts while phasing have never gotten past Rank 10?
---
HOW MANY MARIJUANAS DID YOU INJECT? I'm calling an ambulance now just to be safe.
---
Spirit isnt about outplays its about deception, thats it.
---
You cant outplay a good spirit because she gets too much information for free and gives no information.
---
You either take a gamble and you live for a few more seconds or you get hit, often and depending on her addons, sometimes your choices have no impact and you will get punished no matter what you do
---
Ngl I feel good whne I can actually play spirit because I just get gen rushed because I picked a certain killer when I just wanna try and learn them all...
---
It's been like that for at least a year now, I figured that out a little after I started
---
&gt; for the average spirit player is huge nerf,as now you have to guess the survivor's location instead of blinding running the loop and collide with them.
---
So you're telling me you have to turn your brain on now? Wow, what a shame.
---
"Tunneling" is hitting the same survivor twice in one game.  "Camping"  is seeing scratch marks, hearing a survivor chugging like a freight train toward the hook, and getting there in time to hit the rescuer.  (Or not running off like a moron when there is one literally in sight waiting to swoop in)
---
Survivors are whiny little children; they're all assholes, and after teabagging, flashlighting, hook sabotaging, and being insufferable miserable little twats all game, unless you bow down and roll out the red carpet so they can all escape and bolster their fragile egos they'll call you a cunt and roll out the death threats.  Just tell em to fuck themselves and move on to the next game.
---
More people are whining about "Spirit mains" than I've seen Spirits bitch about the changes.
---
Same here lol

My chili recipe dies with me
---
Okay okay fair point :)
---
In that case, it doesn't sound too bad.
---
So basically the most notable change was that you didn't needed to time flashlight and pallet rescues. You could blind or stun killer during the animation and after the animation finished killer would be forced to drop survivor no matter what. Not even Lightborn could prevent flashlight saves at times.
---
Oh and pallet vacuums were still a thing back then.
---
As someone who plays both sides, no its not bad at all. Its completely understandable as there’s little else to do at that point, and normally the only reasons the other survivors havent run out of the gates is because they want the unhook. So why would you go away from the one place you KNOW the survivors are coming to?
---
Its one of the few times I dont mind camping as survivor. Another time is 1 gen left, 99% gen and a survivor on the hook next to it. I dont get salty because I understand the killer needs to make that play.
---
Camping is only lame when its the strategy of the killer right from the get-go, which is sadly 90% of low rank games.
---
Also insidious bubba....i’ll give this kind of camping a pass too for the memes lol
---
Yeah...no...
---
"Predicting" what she's going to do is just guessing and hoping you're right. At high ranks, where every spirit drains their entire meter in one phase going in a straight line, this works. But against a spirit who knows how to play her, your "prediction" is at best a 50/50 that buys you an extra 5 seconds to when her power recharges, because good spirits use it in tiny bursts. Injured without iron will? Your chance is now 90/10. If the counterplay to a killer is do something and hope you guessed correctly, that's not counterplay.
---
&gt;Billy could use some changes, not gonna lie.
---
Really? I always felt he was one of the most balanced kilers. What do you think needs tweaked?
---
Servers have just been fucking whack since the Archives.
---
I can’t even play Survivor right now because every short loop/short window vault is the death of me. Nothing more frustrating than getting smacked through vaults that shouldn’t have even been close to hitting.
---
I stunned a Legion with a pallet today, and he suffered the full stun-animation, and *then* I took damage. On the other side of the pallet.
---
Just a bad time right now
---
I love these topics since it's always the same five names.
---
You're blocked. You can stop flooding my inbox.

 Cringe
---
She was barely messed with. She'll be fine.
---
It ain't Rin's parents tho, it's her ancestor. So, I correct you by saying, "Family members".
---
Why bother playing when you can have a perk play for you?
---
20/25/30 seccond timer that pauses in chase or when downed. This will actually punish tunneling and make the perk healthier for the game.
---
Exactly - especially the new survivors are sooo loud, they make noises all the time - uuuhh, ooohhhh, eeehhhh. That is why I don't play any of them. And the only I time I rely on collision with her is when I use prayer beads for yoinks. Otherwise it is sound always. The change will help only when the survivors are uninjured or they run Iron Will. Still there is nothins really about using her power when chasing someone. Usually that is the problem. You can't really tell where she is but she can hear you
---
&gt; A powerful element of a kit does not determine whether something is OP or not
---
"Something being too strong doesn't mean it's too strong"
---
What?
---
Vocal minority then I guess
---
Jokes aside, working on a generator then seeing Myers just starring at you is scary, especially when you don't see him and he grabs you off the generator.
---
Yeah atleast EGC has a timer and they aren't forced to DC.
---
I don't wanna be THAT guy who says "it wasn't that bad" but when they started doing that shit I switched to Jason 7 because he could swing super fast and changed my tactics entirely. You had to play two different ways depending on the counselors. (not saying it wasn't annoying tho')  
---
The biggest problem was when there were 13 knives on the map at once. Thankfully they changed that... before the game crashed and burned.
---
But you can't get VAC Banned on DbD. Only normal bans work on it.
---
Why should it stay? What reasoning is there for her to deny survivors information with 0 cost to the spirit, besides "I liked it"?
---
The Game is an unorthodox map. It's an exception, not the standard.
---
Pretty much all the original killers started out as an actual person. Even among licensed killers, Demogorgon is the only one that was never human. If the new killer were just an actual demon it would be a major break in established lore. More than likely if it isn’t Spirit’s father then it’s almost certainly her ancestor.
---
Claudette lookin kinda thicc tho...
---
It takes half the time, but takes twice as many people. It's exactly the same amount of time from the survivor team.
---
It’s rank reset.
---
Camp, tunnel, NOED. The strategy of all killers. Meanwhile survivors just walk around aimlessly, camp pallets and windows so you cant use them in a chase, and hang around the hook while the killer camps.
---
All you can do is grind with swf until you reach red ranks where solo becomes acceptable again
---
The changes literally do nothing to how strong she is. People will still keep whining that she’s op
---
People see their favorite content creators doing it, so they think it's okay to get their friends together and do it too :)
---
No, no, no they do something alright. They let you waste your points on them. That's something.
---
Doesn’t beat the original but still pretty cool
---
*Fine. I’ll do it myself*
---
Introduce ways to increase BP and release this as a game mode imo
---
New Killer: ***horizontal slash attack***
---
Claudette: ***t-bags to avoid it***
---
who gives a shit do it anyway
---
So you want to heal next to a generator where the killer may find both of you? Or do you go to the generator and then lead them elsewhere, which also takes time and may leave scratch marks anyway?
---
No? I only use ruin on low tier killers lol why would that be sarcasm?
---
Sounds like they played the game? Lmao don't call it bullying because you can't learn to avoid lockers after the first one.
---
Meanie
---
Yeah I wouldn't mind that, or move the generator downstairs. It doesn't bother me if EGC is activated but it is possible for the killer to hold the game hostage.
---
Because all 4 Survivors get to use it. After you get unhooked, you have 60 seconds of virtual invincibility.
---
:( my huntress head
---
Not all.
---
...Ok yeah gen speeds aren't fair, yeah I know... What does this have to do with spirit?
---
Wish this happened to me. All I get is hate no matter what build I play.
---
Billy or Freddy.
---
Not gonna lie there are some things I dont like about them. I feel they could be changed to be more fun.
---
Thats why I personally didnt get why everyone was focusing on Spirit. Id take a spirit over one of those two anyday.
---
Yes there needs to be downsides. Killers shouldn't be so powerful that survivors would rather kill themselves than play against them. Especially when one addon had so many benefits. It's also not like Spirit is a bad killer that can't win with addons. So a strong killer with extremelly strong addons is not balanced and needs nerfed in the way of downsides.
---
No.
---
They don’t need to be given a secondary objective since the escape success rate is 30-40%.
---
Secondary objectives favour killers, who are favoured enough as it is and when a killer has Ruin it slows the match down enough. 
---
We’d be spending 5 minutes searching for the Hex and in that time, two of us will already have been hooked. 
---
That success rate will drop to 15%
---
True nostalgia pack would make party streamers brown
---
Seems possible. Honestly, I think a lot of people are holding out hope that the survivor we get is pre-Spirit Rin. The Entity can mess with time and space like that and being hunted down by your future monster self seems right up its alley.
---
So you are saying moving faster than a billy with chainsaw for over 1 full second after exiting phase is not imbalanced...
---
it let you charge for 1 second and instantly cancel to get a massive net speed boost so doing a loop is physically impossible and every safe pallet is by default unsafe, no matter what you did. No mindgames needed, no need to commit a cooldown on your power, just a free hit and very little counterplay mattered
---
Because spirit is currently either the strongest killer in the game or close to it (depending on if who you're talking to hates her or nurse more) and Freddy is also pretty close in power level to those two (again, depending on who you talk to).
---
They are releasing some of the exclusive cosmetics to everyone, I think they realized how much money people were making selling these exclusive items.
---
The devs have stated multiple times that Billy's base kit is the standard for balance. His addons are bullshit, but they're on the chopping block as well, as CTG/Thompsons mix is known to be broken. But Billy base kit is here to stay.
---
Judging from his Twitter, he’s not having a great time with the new Updates either.
---
This isnt hard at all, you just have to be on the gen when its finished lol.
---
I don't see how the players are bad and lazy for using mechanics and addons that the DEVELOPERS put in the game and didn't address until now a year later or so. Are those players still lazy if they used Stridor? You sound dumb.
---
Yeah I noticed that a week or so ago. I thought maybe it was a new glitch.
---
There are no actual infinite loops, there's just thinking you can get around faster if you back track and them banking on you resetting the distance by doing so. Additionally never freeze on a pallet if it's at the shack or a potential good looping spot, Brute force it or ignore him/her as they are no longer on a gen and probably ran away. Lastly get an anti looping killer, Trapper, clown, spirit, huntress, hag and even doc (He can shock them to tier 3 and leave them) Can handle loopers very well
---
It helps a lot when both gens are yellow so if I’m going to stop one I’m going to scare off the gen with multiple people so it doesn’t pop.
---
She was so nice I felt bad, so I apologized for the blind and she said not to worry about it ;-;
---
Pulling them off right in front of the killer, so you get the points. Mostly at the detriment of whoever is on the hook.
---
A lot of xbox players have them too. Weird thing is I already had for honor, and then for my birthday I wanted to buy myself a horror game and ended up with dead by daylight, chosen randomly. Now they’re just the only 2 games I play
---
I’m rank one both sides and yes I do play spirit.
---
It you have a usb you can save the videos to your capture gallery, upload them to a computer and post on reddit there
---
Did you play that event?
---
I never thought about window/pallet grabs! Nice catch (no pun intended)
---
I have never gotten a flashlight save in my life, but if you successfully blind the Killer it'll pop up on the screen and give you points.
---
Personally, i love the ghost face cosmetic. And im tempted to actually buy it (after i get ghost face of course)
---
*shrug* that’s why I’m saying it more of a angry rant.
---
F
---
*N S F W ?*
---
Same these were awesome
---
The main issue with spirit didn't get addressed, so yeah not that much got changed.
---
Perhaps... but perhaps my dog is better
---
Thankyou
---
And yet I’m consistently “guessing” right 90% of the time, and I’ve seen many spirits struggle to get a survivor down for multiple gens so its not just me thats doing it.
---
Funny how that works. Its almost like experience, knowledge and being good at the game gives you an advantage.
---
Okay I’ll just not chase survivors past lockers anymore, if they run past one I’ll break the chase since that is clearly the superior strategy 
---
/s
---
Both player-bases thrive on toxicity. 
---
Naah legit though, they are both interesting games that sort of stand out from the others in their respective genres, and are the “fun to pick up and play, insanely difficult to master” kinda niche.
---
Omfg if you were a few secs off it would’ve been game over. Nice!
---
yea but NOED do = bad player
---
What locker change do you speak of?
---
Hngghhh, entity, I’m tryna M1 after phase-walking, but I’m dummy thicc and the clap of my asscheeks keeps alerting the survivors!
---
No shit you wouldnt have a problem with it lol shit would be busted. Infinitesimal are significantly less of a problem now than they used to be (i dont think you would have done we with early DBD), and look away from the flashlights and viola, its useless
---
...and two is too low. It's me...
---
Awwwww hell yeah. Want some fresh No0b3 and Minto streams. Preferably with Puppers and Satt too
---
Well personally even as a killer main i think the changes are perfect. Prayer beads is fucking OP and a godsend because it removes your one tool to track him. Im in favour of stealth things when they are part of a specific build (like how im ok with jumpscare myers) but orayer beads was bullshit: the addon
---
If you’re facing survivors that have the ability to think you’re 100% not getting grabs using the prayer beads. Literally let go until the noise stops.
---
Funny how all the survivor mains now make out shes braindead to play because they read it online, yet when they do play her they’re absolute shit and this reddit used to be full of people asking for tips in how to play her.
---
At least they're actively attempting to fix them and even acknowledging their state unlike other dev teams
---
Not really, you are already finishing your phase within arm's reach of the survivor if you know what you're doing.
---
Then ignore it. BMing does literally nothing to you and responding to it by complaining, giving up, flat out DCing, etc. Literally just gives people who taunt what they want.
---
It's been in gaming for years, some games even incorporate taunts and give points and achievements for using them.
---
When you realize the worst a survivor/killer is doing when BMing is literally putting themselves in a worse spot (ex. Teabagging and wasting flashlight to waste distance and item charge, or knodding and smacking downed/hooked survivors instead of going to the next chase asap) it really isn't something to complain about. Especially to the extent that this community does it.
---
At first I thought survivors are skillful but when I step back I can indeed see the mini teleports
---
Rule #1: Never T-bag a killer who can T-bag you back
---
The theory is that it's one of Spirits ancestors, who is mentioned in the Yamaoka Estate flavour text as being a warrior who used a mask.
---
Lack of vault animation and having collision were legit issues. I agree that the core issue is left untouched, but I disagree that they didn't do some good work here.
---
Wait a minute, the blood’s receeding and the incense sticks are burning upwards. Thats either a references i dont get, or its a teaser for him/her/its power
---
Claud tbagged at the entrance to the gate since the beginning of the EGC and waited for me to run up. She obviously wasn’t ready for STBFL.
---
yeah she has played Hillbilly before, but she gets really stressed and nervous when trying to chainsaw somebody and when she tries to hook them hahaha
---
Iron Maiden. You're welcome
---
What’s there to be nerfed?
---
He gently nursed his way over that pallet
---
We need Jack Burton, Big Trouble in Little China as a survivor. Maybe the guy with the tall hat who floats around cutting people to pieces as a villain, and a street setting map. San Francisco China Town.
---
Close your eyes.
---
r/dbdgoeswild
---
we all do fam, we all do xD
---
A lot of exclusive skins like Dweard or purple pants for Claudette are becoming free skins avaliable to everyone.
---
Some event items like Hound mask are gonna be avaliable too.
---
The Dweard I got for free when I got the game for some reason
---
yes, love is very cringe my friend, you just gotta embrace it
---
Personally, i want rin to be a survior then we can pave the way for a DLC where we get the killers as surviors.
---
It is ok, its playing the game. It's an exhaustion perk, and theres a killer perk in the game that counters it pretty damn hard, so I dont see what the problem is
---
It is, since you know they have head on? Why would you run into it, instead bait the jump lmao
---
Otz, zubatlel, and noob3 are my go to.
---
Nah you’re all wrong. Its actually the alchemist reading his notes hes taken on rin
---
Punishes you how? You have your cosmetic
---
they’re just screwing over their loyal player base who grinded for those cosmetics and appreciated that only they got them for playing the game a lot, downvote me if u want but that’s fucked up and I don’t even have all of the event cosmetics
---
How could he not that pic of Feng is absolutely adorable
---
This is the very reason I stopped playing Nurse long time ago. At a certain point it just feels the same.
---
I still think that "audio tracking" is currently a too strong element considering it's almost like close range aura-reading when it doesnt come up to multi-floor maps. And even there it's really strong.
---
It might become better when they're simply toning down the Survivors' noises by 25% each (moaning and breathing). So you actually have to listen properly and not have a Meg screeching in your ear while she is 12 metres away.
---
Err what's wrong? Yeah she's fast but dude got caught out of position and literally led her right to him.
---
Stop running so much if you have no idea and definetely dont run without a diversion or fake out
---
Well... I got headpopped on my first match. I had no idea what was going on, while all my purple rank friends screamed at me. Good times.
---
This is hilarious lmao good shitpost
---
The freddy in dbd is the remake one tho
---
I know what it means.... i think its either a teaser for the power or we are getting rin as survior and having the killing ‘undone’
---
I have a feeling they’ll release the cosmetics under a different rarity, sort of like they did with the charity case
---
Did you get the Sprint burst bug?
---
RAH!
---
The only time I really consider camping to be "bad form" during EGC is if you ignore another down solely to keep camping. If you break chase with a survivor you would have downed solely to return to a hook to continue camping, then I'll be a bit miffed. Other than that, go wild.
---
They are fucking horrible. I'd hit a vault take two or three steps and then get hit and think "what the fuck" it sucks.
---
Depends on the persons perks, whether or not they have a meditation, all manner of factor, but if you’re dead set on healing yourself, bring a Medkit, not Self Care
---
Probably some upaid intern spilled coffee all over a keyboard.
---
Low key would love Sidney's House as a realm
---
You want her to be visible during phase?? Wtf dude. Do you also want trapper’s beartraps to glow in the dark? Do you want Ghostface to have his original 16 meter noise notification in stealth?
---
Probably. Hard to say. These tasks are nebulous as fuck. I have completed some and not known how.
---
I think she’s gonna be the new “dc” on sight killer, for many players. It’s bad enough people dc on the first down/hook. Now they’ll probably just hear her phasing or see her and dc.
---
They still treated him better than anyone else. In the Leatherface movie he basically turns into Bubba because someone insulted his mother.
---
Bro my favorite build in the game is spirit with STBFL, and her addons that decrease charge time and increase recovery rate. They nerfed the first and completely changed the latter. I just got blown the fuck out and I'm so salty, no one asked for this
---
Great. Now can we address gen speed and swf?
---
Cant flashlight blind me again if I hook the flashlight instead.
---
Nah I’m talking about the teabagging neas that do it when I’m breaking a pallet

You sir are a hero :D
---
I've played twice recently and done well so this makes me happy, since I never knew collision was a thing and am too low level to have spirit beads yet. 
---
I'm a Myers main because I like to jumpscare so you can imagine how much I love moments on Spirit and Wraith.
---
Her footsteps are already loud as fuck
---
Well I didn't pay attention to the time.
---
*taunts in Lawbringer*
---
Shes not the hardest killer, but shes certainty not braindead.
---
So good.
---
That states what rank it is with three tallies equaling Rank 3, the highest one.
---
I've never 7sed STBFL nor have I ever read the perk. Lmao.. what is it
---
How long ago was this
---
Is that confirmed? Or are you basing it just on the teaser we saw?
---
Freddy has never been called a deadite. In the comic they called Jason one though.
---
This is definitely one of the devs worst ideas and that’s saying something
---
Tally marks show the level of the perk. Each perk has 3 levels that are discovered and unlocked in the bloodweb
---
No they arent, not if your team is good.
---
Level of the perk. 1 tally=Level 1, 2 rally marks mean level 2, etc.
---
I got accused of camping as spirit during the endgame because I would patrol the two exit gates and the hook using haunting. Y'know. The only smart places to look.
---
Dude, *prayer beads* got a nerf, what do you mean useless???
---
You’re damn right I did
---
Damn, didn't think of the undetectable killers.
---
I didn’t say he was called one though....
---
oh ur being sarcastic :(
---
What, in your view, is the core issue?
---
I don't think so either, just an idea
---
I dunno... What if the spirit doesnt bring prayer beads? Survivors need to know when the spirit is facing or not
---
Agreed. Followed up by Ghostface.
---
When you hit someone that is t the obsession you get a token, each token decreases your attack cool down by 5% you can have 8 tokens at a time. Hitting the obsession takes away 4/3/2 tokens. It’s a pretty good perk.
---
i love this
---
I wonder why this happens with Sbeeves. I've seen it twice now
---
My experience too usually.
---
better than seeing the ten millionth survivor = toxic shitpost
---
I like a number of these changes (window vault animation, the amulet change, collision when phasing) but I feel like it doesn’t address the main issue with Spirit: you still have to frequently resort to guesswork against her, and no matter what, guesswork isn’t fun.
---
Don't sleep on my boi
---
Someone explain
---
I haven't seen your post. Besides, it's not that advanced of an idea.
---
The codes themselves are obviously not the problem they're trying to fix here
---
Pausing the timer while downed could theoretically work. Maybe make the timer slower while downed instead?
---
Wrong thing but cup
---
who hurt u
---
One RBT
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-xOsR1iVYs). But in the end you just have to play against spirit a lot to learn how they play, its not something you can easily learn because it is just skill.
---
Crazy to see so many Xbox users play this game.... Mostly ever saw PS users... This might make me buy an Xbox and just wait for PS5
---
100th repost
---
wut old left behind
---
Because Spirit is a much more pressing and easier to solve issue than friends playing together.
---
Fair to note, however, that Demogorgon set a precedent for them to continue breaking established lore. That's not a guarantee that they will, of course. It just shows they're willing to at this point.
---
Of course, of course.
---
Prayer Breed nerf - okay
---
Collision nerf - it's okay
---
All the other add-on changes - why? It's nerf enough!
---
Vaulting animation - that's, I loved her for that and now she is borring like everyone else -,-#

I got it, 2 of them were fully fresh, but one of them someone hopped on midway through with me, still counted. Best I can give you.

Not many yet but I at least saw people asking if the new killed was gonna be Shugoki after seeing the mask in the teaser.

I have a somewhat ok success rate with Unbreakable, but one perk I can never get to use is Adrenaline. I remember one scenario was I was injured looping a trapper around, last gen popped and I got adrenaline, then I immediately stepped into a trap and got sacrificed. I was very upset
---
They did do that with a lot of the exclusives such as Dweard and Iron Chuckles.
---
When the spirit is phasing you can hear her footsteps, not sure what the range is on it and they are very quiet but are still audible! Taking collision away will help the survivors out, I personally run Iron Will so I stop running and walk away, and now collision will be gone it helps sneak away rather than her phasing and trying to bump into me
---
Head crush for the mori animation (with the deep laugh at the end).
---
No killer moves grass or corn when I tried. 
---
It was hard to hear, but you could hear grass or corn moving as a survivor. You could make out when the sounds changed as they transitioned from open ground to corn or grass, but they had to be within lunge range in order to make it out. If you are that close, it doesn’t look good for you as survivor.
---
Dedicated Servers
---
But you still have the main weapon cooldown?
---
Yeah I wouldnt blame survivors on this one, IMO spirit created an "illusion" of balance when she got released since people didnt really know how to abuse her power and she wasnt that popular, besides at that time nurse was the one getting the most hate.
---
Now that nurse is out of the picture more people started playing spirit and her true "potential" was shown, so theres that.
---
Sidneys house?
---
This was a common bug in DBD several years ago. This is not in the current version.
---
Yes she did, her nerfs aren't even that big, her addons 100% needed to be touched. If you think otherwise you either have no sense of balance or you just don't care about balance.

As a avid fan of the series it’s a good thing. The aether story has gone on long enough. The new story was a breath of fresh air.
---
Lmfao at considering Iron maiden a good perk on anyone but Huntress.
---
Did they remove her twitch when shes standing still which was always used as a mind game when standing behind a dropped pallet ?
---
Galaxy brains do overhead heavies without feinting.  They'll never expect it if you keep doing it.  *taps forehead*
---
&gt;Why does being able to lose or win easily make the competitive nature of the game more appealing?

I'm not sure. I never made that point.
---
Damn it I had my volume up and now my roommates prolly think I was watching something a liiiittle different
---
*Reverse Trap Bear*
---
I'm fine with good Spirit players continuing to do well. I'm honestly fine getting outplayed by anyone. Some things in the game just feel more brainless and unfair, rather than rewarding skill, and ideally they get nerfed. Prayer Beads was one of them. MoM on release too. I hope the game gets fine tuned to reward good gameplay.
---
Instead of fixing the issue with people losing the cosmetics at random they are just going to release all the hard earned event cosmetics for free?
---
Kate best girl
---
Except for rare instances, chases are 1v1. The chases are intended to be long enough to give the other survivors a chance to do some objectives, but still allow the killer to get a down if the chase goes on too long. 
---
The war is 1v4, but the battles are 1v1
---
You have to own the game Death Garden. It definitely isn’t a legion mask tho lol
---
I run it during rank reset because these roaches cant get 1 gen done.
---
Whats redbubble batty boi?
---
You did the meme wrong
---
Tbh, she does have a fair amount of powerplay, but go off.
---
wow i main spirit and even i would literally never run that combo thats insane. i guess this is just an example of bad spirit mains getting hurt by the nerf (not referring to OP specifically)
---
I don't get it.
---
That was very heartwarming, thank you
---
Feelbadman when they spawn on top of ruin, and so three gens wind up popping in a min and a half anyways. I've seen to happen to so many a streamer. lol
---
Pebble the Killer while they're carrying someone for that sweet sweet 1 second grab escape.
---
Your not in the wrong. Why would you leave the hook if you clearly see his friends around? Even if it’s not in the EGC why would you leave the hook if there is survivors around? They are just salty. And as a person who has played the game since 2016 I can say I’ve had my fair share of me getting camped but I don’t really care because I can clearly see that there is survivors around so why would the killer leave the hook to let the survivors rescue me? Your all good and don’t let the toxic end game chat get to you, just say a quick gg and return to lobby. Good luck out there.
---
They’re giving it to everyone
---
It’s pretty simple, maybe you just can’t read mate.
---
Yes. They will be giving every single player the large majority of the exclusive cosmetics in the next patch. This will likely restore it for you.
---
Swap out NOED and Iron Grasp for I’m All Ears and Ruin, and the build will be solid.
---
How do you keep it closed? It's always open when you finish a match.
---
I agree. We need to balance the game around this post.
---
Why, thank you for the smile and chuckle, good internet stranger.
---
Only for 500 hrs.
---
5k total, 3k on trapper. You even play dbd?
---
4 seconds is pretty bad. That’s why I would not advocate for it. However think about it this way. 
---
Nurse has a base fatigue stun of 2 seconds and every chainblink adds an extra .5 seconds. A 4 second fatigue stun would be the equivalent of
---
 2+.5(x) where X is the number of chainblinks. 
---
If 2+.5x=4, then X is equal to 4. 
---
Meaning Nurse would need to execute 5 blinks for a 4 second fatigue stun. Now since Nurse has literally 0 lethality for 6 seconds after a double blink, let’s see how many blinks it would take her to reach a 6 second fatigue stun and you can tell me if it’s at all fair for 2 blinks to match that number. 
---
2+.5x=6. 
---
.5x=4.
---
X=8. 
---
For the current 6 seconds of Nurse waiting to have her 2 blinks back, she waits the equivalent of what an 8 blink Nurse waited to get through her fatigue. Does that at ALL seem fair? 
---
Here’s a better idea and an idea I’m sure many Nurse mains would get behind. There is already a cool down that inhibits Nurse from spamming her blinks which gives survivors more time to escape her. Expand on *that* instead of shoehorning an extra mechanic into her. 
---
Increase the fatigue stun from chainblinks from .5 up to .75, darken the screen more and dramatically reduce the sounds of survivors breathing while she’s in her fatigue. Make her unable to move at all during her fatigue stun. 
---
A 2 blink would then give survivors 2.75 seconds to escape. Where they can cover over 8 meters of distance where Nurse does nothing. Her screen is tremendously darker so that you can break LOS. And she’d be virtually unable to hear you while in her fatigue. 
---
That would satisfy the reasoning BHVR gave behind the basekit nerf by giving more of a tangible window to escape Nurse, it would inhibit her snowball potential, *AND* it would change her in a way that Nurse players do not have to reprogram their muscle memory around (which was the whole reason why we didn’t use addons before. Bc they fucked with our muscle memory)
---
What platform do you play on
---
The change made it literally impossible to grab off a gen unless the survivor is mentally disabled
---
Okay this actually got me to chuckle, bravo to you
---
I barely play survivor, so I'm rank 16, but I'm always out there looking for ruin. I've committed to always taking it down, and at that rank almost everyone runs it so I always look for the totem right off the bat.
---
Seem to work for everyone else.
---
Bloodletting still isnt free for everyone.
---
Pallet waste and you can just as easily GO AROUND once its dropped.... get the rank 20 pishposh outa the ball game
---
Oh no I have , I bought it as soon as it came out lmaoooo
---
How exactly are they trying to distract us?
---
I forget that there are actual people who play dbd mobile, like why?
---
It’s the level / tier of a perk. Each tally is one.
---
Not always accurate for me either.
---
I'll never understand survivors who have an ego to t-bag at exit gates. Just leave if there's nothing else to do.
---
Ya fuck all the people that spent hundreds of dollars and grinded intensely for these cosmetics. Infact, lets make Legacy and all Bloody cosmetics free too! Everyone loves free stuff!
---
No matter what killer I play any hex totems I have usually get broken in the first 5 Seconds so I'm not bringing ruin. I've also heard I'm all ears is garbage.
---
My man, as a survivor main, billy is perfectly fine. If your games are going like this against a billy, then I’m sorry to say that maybe you don’t know how to play against a billy. Timing is everything against a billy. You need to force him to choose between chasing and losing objectives. His chainsaw hitbox is also fine. Hit boxes as a whole in the game are screwy... anticipate that
---
You used to be able to see auras even in lockers but they changed it. Survs can now hide in locked from any tracking perk that shows an aura
---
If you are new to the game you might not have experienced watching a survivor hide in a locker via bbq vision
---
Thought he hasn't been playing cause he's in the process of moving house?
---
Fair play if it actually was him.
---
Immediately someone else commented it doesn’t work for them either so this is false
---
All I can say is that if the new killer is gonna be the spirits father, there is, without a doubt, 100% chance that someone will make a picture on the internet that people will hear banjos when they see it.
---
Oh shit, the new map will have a cow tree? Exciting!
---
Bad manners. T-bagging, clicking flashlights, etc
---
Ever heard of fhe print screen button?
---
This comment made me smile. Thank you.
---
It's just an idea man, why are you so upset?
---
I have never actually seen a prestiged spirit
---
That's totally fair. I wanted to make a build soon that used them so I might try comboing them
---
Inb4 it's an alt account xD
---
maybe you should learn how to formulate your sentences more properly mate.
---
 "And if so Freddy is a Deadite then we have Ash and Deadites." lol ok like what?
---
You won't see the auras of a survivor if they're hiding in a locker. That was changed quite a while ago though.
---
It's still extremely hard to get, plus I was rank 9
---
She'll still be in red ranks just as often, I'm calling it now.
---
More people should run iron maiden. With head on and nacys new perk and the locker buff survs are always in and out of lockers
---
Shit, I think you deserve it if you can hit them, it's a lot harder than it seems
---
The only reason I can't get it is because survivors dc.
---
You said if. No need to be salty bout it.
---
Oh, definitely. And I’m sure some low rank kills will camp for a night or two to purposely depip so they don’t have to face against opponents of their proper skill level...
---
But for the most part, an actual camper (someone who is camper out of ignorance, rather than purposeful depiping or malice against that single survivor) is taught to camp because overly altruistic survivors take the bait and reward the camp.
---
If I do something I know should be bad for me, but get constantly rewarded for it, I’m gonna continue doing the thing. 
---
Probably why I’m fat... Stupid brain releasing endorphins whenever I eat cake.
---
What they did was made it to now no matter where she is, you'll always be able to hear when shes phase walking
---
ps4
---
 I just told you I agree with you.
---
You really need to not let the left ctrl button offend you so much
---
You really think I care enough to have an alt account? 
---
Ok zoomer.
---
Oh shit yeah :)
---
BHVR are releasing a lot of exclusive skins to be free for all people since people are trying to sell keys at a huge up charge, people are angry because when that golden feng skin came out people bought it for $500 and now it's going to be free
---
Right, which means that if it's always 100% balanced for 1v1 the killer will *always lose*
---
My favorite aspect of Spirit is that she’s all about mind games. Prayer Beads didn’t take much effort. Time your phases right, phase til you collide with a survivor in a gen, and easy yoink. It’s isn’t as much about mind gaming as windows and pallets are. Take away her mindgame potential at windows and she’s got none left other than pallets. Yes I like the mindgames so of course I’m a bit biased but as someone who plays more Survivor even than Killer, I think Spirit would become very unfun to play as killer and just boring as survivors against her.
---
If I can't find someone and hear that a survivor is getting unhook, you bet your ass I'm going to turn around and try to get the person that unhooked. But what usually ends up happening, is the unhooked person will body block for the unhooker and I can punish that person that did the blocking because they usually have DS or borrowed time. Also DS popping when I chase another person hook them across the map, and find a survivor just running out in the open and can only slug them is just dumb and a time waste. Considering how quickly survivors can finish generators/heal its almost a total waste to slug.
---
I got it from a gen, super lucky, I never do that haha, I imagine a vault would work? You are interrupting the animation.
---
Yes it was actually really cute opened them up after the screenshot and got a bunch of good stuff
---
Why did it take you so long?
---
He is right. I've been in a lobby with a green ping and as soon as everyone readies up and the match is about to start the ping drops to red.
---
I’m a 27 year old guy. I am mid ranks but I’d be down to play, been looking for a group anyways. I’m on PS4 as well
---
I was lucky enough to catch the Nea right as the EGC was about to end, also found hatch before she did. Basically, just got super fucking lucky lol
---
I haven't tried it since the patch hit this afternoon, but I'd say it's probably comparable. I wouldn't say it's terrible for skill checks, but there's definitely some chop. I hope the patch today helped with some of the performance issues.
---
Yeah sorry it didn’t cross my mind
---
Her addons literally allowed her to get out of phasing and pretty much cover an entire loop with post-phase movement. That is stupid. That is the type of lunge that shouldn't exist.
---
Any specific kind?  I like to play Scratched Mirror on Game/Lerys.  I'll also play Tombstone if I get bullied on another killer.  "For this next game, everyone dies.  Even me."  *Entity Displeased*
---
Congrats! This was by far the hardest achievement for me to get.
---
Also I'm ready to eat crow! They released the patch today, so in my face.
---
Lmao. I love that
---
.... How?
---
\*Complains about facecamping\*  
---
\*Flashlight\*  
---
\*Claims to have been under the impression of farming\*  
---
\*1 injured, another hooked, and the last down\*  
---
\*X to doubt\*
---
I got the Donkey jacket and Hound Mask but my save file, and MANY other people, lost theirs as well. Getting them back would be great
---
Thanks! In my case it was almost entirely based on luck, lol. Hope you earn it too!
---
Dont tbag, good slam, but when theres a downed guy right next to hook, dont unhook until killer walks away, otherwise they can just walk straight to hook then immediately chase you guys 2 seconds after, also they might have agitation.
---
It was sarcasm. I basically just triple stunned you lol. Noob.
---
Wouldnt be hard to run next to the killer while they have someone for a free stun. Theres a reason each stun currently in the game takes skill.
---
Besides, pebble is already pretty good in the right hands.
---
The Tru3 gang is going crazy in the comments, holy it feels like a weird religion built over that boring guy
---
Well there ya go, theory disbanded. Fuck theories aye.
---
Yep that pretty much sums up my general experience.
---
An iconic stream
---
That's me when I hear him coming up on me when he's invisible and you just hear those loud stomps of his. Fucking terrifying.
---
Would be neat as a little benefit to bringing it
---
Neat
---
/#justtrapperthings
---
And everyone's going to say it's fair and needed but I can't see what addons are even really viable now. Haunting duration/speed? I hate those, they mess up my timing make me overshoot my targets and I'm fairly certain they make the recharge rate take much longer. I was using fast charge time and power recovery, why nerf them
---
Could be.
---
That's true, maybe make it so it cant stun the killer while their carrying someone

You've been outplayed
---
The fact you think 147 is good.... Lol.
---
Dear god no we already have to deal with light squads I don't wanna deal with pebble squads.
---
Most the the cosmetic I believe were items given away exclusively at events . The problem is people had multiple copies of the steam codes that gave these cosmetics and would sell them for extremely large amounts online.  Looks like they are just trying to stop people from making a market out of It.
---
Ok then it's on them to not bitch about locker builds if they're not going to run anything to counter it. It's like me bitching about Spirit when I didnt pick Iron Will and it could have completely changed things
---
Where's the killer?
---
All the time. Like, if you're right infront of the window then it'd make sense, but there have been some occassions where i'd be far enough from the window and i'd still get hit. It's frustrating.
---
Not sure if its due to connection issues or what.
---
There is a sub reddit called dbdlfg (I think). Everyone on there posts what system they use for the game as well
---
Well fuck me too I guess? I have some of the event cosmetics that took dozens of hours to get and I’m not becoming a blubbering baby over other people getting them. Anyone upset over this should just try to remind themselves that this is a game. 
---
Besides, Bhvr wasn’t selling the codes for hundreds of dollars so the money people spent for these skins is irrelevant as that was a conscious decision they made because they wanted those cosmetics at the time.
---
The whole panic around the Spirit changes had me worried they’d nuke her into oblivion (admittedly, Nurses rework was a lot tamer than I expected, so my fear was grossly over exaggerated), but this... I’m 100% ok with this. These changes aren’t even remotely as bad as I initially thought they’d be, and the Prayer Beads change is kinda legit, ngl—I like the idea of global phasing sound.
---
Wait, on what console?
---
Dbd announces Michael Myers. 
---
This guy: Fuck the devs!
---
I also like how instaheals were gutted but Moris are still untouched. It's literally a free depip if you are found first, hooked and then tunneled off hook, but somehow it was the instaheals that were a problem...
---
I’m with you, even if I get tunneled or camped on hook. Honestly I’ve just hit a point where I feel like everyone really just needs a positive moment in there day. If I can provide that then I’ve done my job. It’s vastly improved my gaming experience.
---
Yeah the portals are the issue, he requires too much setup for too little reward, and on top of that the cool down is ridiculously long.
---
Are there people who actually care about how exclusive a cosmetic is? I don't put on a certain cosmetic because it's rare, I do it because I think it looks cool.
---
I watch a lot of ScottJund, he said this won’t be enough so you’re not wrong.
---
I knew there was a reason I related to the wraith.
---
Lmao nice fuck ghostface
---
So that's why I lost my songbird Kate shirt? Darn..
---
Happenes to me once. Happy they understood
---
I knew he'd chase me to the pallet, only reason I waited for it and went for it. I'm not a waste, and I don't farm, I saw the play and went for it.
---
That bouquet offering will look very nice greyed out in your inventory.
---
Sadly don't have nurses
---
What's that? I'm new!
---
Love this artwork it look like spirit just heard me sneaking
---
Flashlight was from a chest in that match
---
Killer was allowing us to heal injured guy multiple times
---
Killer allowed me to blind him multiple times
---
Downed guy was an idiot
---
Doesn't  excuse the ass gameplay and ass rank system
---
147 is yellow tf
---
It's kinda weird how his portals work, I think removing the requirement of having to be on a portal to TP to another would be good
---
They are not very good but they are stupid and should be reworked(for example giving her Bloodhunt effect for 10 seconds after phasing out)
---
It's a fair point. I would expect that there will be some future counterplay added, like she makes louder footsteps, so that survivors actually have SOME form of information to react to. But as it is, they can't nerf 40 major things at once without people crying legion. Obviously they'll see how her trends go because collision, while a good change, won't touch most decent players at all
---
You would need to specify what you consider "toxic". This term is far overused.
---
Yeaaaaaa I did think it was Huntress xD, but I guess anything's possible yet impossible in the land of DBD
---
You misunderstand. I run past them - it still stuns you from the side. 
---
I’m saying one guy hides in locker while buddy runs past it. Guy in locker (who I am not chasing) jumps out to stun
---
I'm lvl 3 and already have the option to get purple gift box fml
---
I wish they gave out some nea exclusives
---
Um if my memory serves me correct then it’s right away.
---
It makes sense. If survivors have the hatch killers should have at least a free kill available.
---
Now time to level my nurse to lvl 40 (she's lvl 3 rn)
---
There’s toxicity everywhere and always will be unfortunately. Camping / tunneling killers, survivors with flashlights, pallet stunning and teabagging, survivors not working together and dying on first hook.. people are always gonna be offended by something. Best thing to do is try to find the few people you can enjoy the game with.
---
Yeah. I mean that’s just the meta for killers. Just like adrenaline and decisive strike are some meta perks for survivor.
---
Thrilling tremors is more of an information tool than any kind of stalling. It's garbage for actually slowing down gens
---
I make stuff:
---
https://www.bunboiarts.com/
---
Lmaooo oh brother
---
Decisive? Borrowed time? Kindred? All are anti-camp
---
Nice 5 gens
---
yeah in custom lobbies
---
Image spending $200 for a cosmetic item because your someone who likes collecting, and then it's suddenly just given to everyone. That would be very fustrating for that person.
---
I'm not against people being able to purchase the cosmetics from the in-game Store, but just giving everyone a bunch of Ultra Rare and Event cosmetics is the equivalent to just giving everyone Legacy or Bloody cosmetics.
---
It has been released for Nintendo Switch. I don't know if it's been released for mobile yet, I checked Google play store and didn't see it.
---
No ptb. We are going in raw.
---
you won't get a logical response, dbd community is literally handicapped so you'll just get a WE ALL DESERVE SKIN response, just gotta accept the fact the 100+ hours you burned on those events supporting the game early on were for nothing even though literally every other game has exclusive timed cosmetics for events and nobody cares then and accepts that fact
---
bends over*
---
I like pharmacy but medkits are the second-worst item you can get:
---
1. Keys
---
2. Toolboxes
---
3. Flashlights
---
4. Medkits
---
5. Maps (and broken keys)
---
This would be cool for like a card game. 
---
See if you escape or not.
---
At last. The donkey and untamed donkey jackets come to me!
---
People really are fucking children. "I WANTED TO BE SPECIAL!!! IT'S NO FUN IF HE GETS IT TOOOOOOO!!!!"
---
I'm just saying that just because a killer plays fairly doesn't mean survivor's are suddenly going to be sportsmanlike. The Killer is going to get BMed regardless of how he plays. So what incentive does he have not to take advantage of cheap strategies when circumstances call for it? 
---
In a community of sportsmanlike people (think early dark souls duelists), you're sort of pressured by the culture itself to be polite. In a game like dead by daylight, when surrounded by toxicity, why would you expect a killer to rise above their opponents and play fair? You can play that way if you want, but that's asking too much of others to do the same.
---
It's right away, but new stuff will always be more expensive in shards. It will stay that way until the next chapter comes out.
---
Why the fuck does Trapper not have Undetectable when placing down traps yet
---
Oh cry me a river. I paid 20$ for DBD and I've gotten 300+ hours of enjoyment from it. You're a crybaby plain and simple.
---
Fair enough, different ones were going missing every other patch
---
Thanks for letting me know. Have a good day!
---
well at least you didn’t go “empty handed”!
---
I mean at first they were awesome . There wasnt many ways to customize yourself , so you definitely knew who had money/connections and you really stood out with them . Obviously with the skin shop now . Most people will just see them as recolors and they probably felt it's not good business to let others sell a  meh cosmetic for 100$'s of dollars lol
---
Oh yeah, I remember when you Chicken Littles were saying "Last Year" was gonna kill DBD. And "Friday the 13th". Guess what, DBD is  a great game. There's a reason why it's still one of the most watched games on Twitch while the copies come and go.
---
ORE WA ONIWA GYOUBU MASAKA!
---
Bring PGTW if you have it. That's what I use instead of ruin.
---
ok
---
Ruin is the best, the problem is that it can be completely useless if survivors spawn near the totem. Corrupt isn’t as good as ruin but it’s more consistent. Pop is pretty good too.
---
Ruin,  pop, and corrupt intervention are the three best ones
---
Have another 🤷‍♂️
---
How dare u not use mike
---
Thrilling tremors and discordance together are the best info perks for patrolling gens,
---
Okie, have fun with that. Hope these perk suggestions were helpful for u.
---
Well he doesn't anymore
---
Hey OP! I was wondering if you could make character portraits in this art style, I've been wanting them forever and I'm sure everyone else wants them too! (Tbh I just want one for Bing Bong Boi and Ash)
---
Did this happened only for you or for all?
---
It was only for me
---
And that's why I play on console. So I don't get those poopy diapers of servers. :)))))))))))))))
---
That something shows loyalty to the game that soon will no longer appear genuine amongst all the people who didn't do the event but got the cosmetic anyway.
---
Ty for your help
---
Other killers have counterplay, Spirit didn't have. Y'all making braindead memes.
---
if only the devs focused on buffing low tiers instead of nerfing top tiers
---
So you have chosen... Death.
---
Or we could focus on the numerous maps that hurt killers, gen speed, or swf.
---
Oh damn really? Cause normally its 9k shards so it would be more than that?
---
Not many people in this sub are going to admit that
---
lol okay
---
No it really isn’t, the prestige and bloody cosmetics take millions of bloodpoints and are supposed to show a sort of mastery of a character, emphasis on “supposed to”. The event cosmetics just show you played an event and the stream/ code giveaway cosmetics mean you watched a stream. 
---
Bhvr wasn’t selling these cosmetics for hundreds of dollars before this announcement and they shouldn’t be monetizing them now just because some players chose to buy them for exuberant prices.
---
That's a very silly way to look at EARNED in-game cosmetics. They are literally, by nature, a reward for hard work. They are literally a badge to show other players "hey, look! I worked hard and earned these cosmetics!". No different than gold weapons in Overwatch or CoD. They are *literally* an aesthetic status symbol, and to see them handed out to people who never even played during the events they were worked for is a huge "fuck you" to people who put hours into earning them.
---
All the crews had to die to create a reality with no evil forces (is the REALLY simplified way of putting it)
---
Stonks
---
same boat, been playing since launch i'm honestly just tired of the game and every announcement sucks ass, just gonna delete it and move on to greener pastures at this point
---
you just blurted out so many wrong opinions that I don't even know where to begin
---
*Except for Wounded Healer, because it's broken and unobtainable, BHVR please it's been broken since May.
---
I agree but unfortunately we most likely are not getting anymore Chaos if rumors are to be true
---
Pop forsure , if you're good at hooking you can get a 98% gen mostly regressed in 3 hooks
---
The nerf isn't even that big tbh, which isn't a bad thing.
---
Ah, captain hindsight i see you've arrived
---
You have no idea what you’re talking about
---
You don’t got to be salty boy
---
Take NoEd off. Don’t care if it’s one of the fully leveled perks you have, you literally don’t need double insta down. Ever. Learn to 99% people at the least.
---
''some of'' means ''most of'', by the way
---
how you get a flair (im on a laptop,Chromebook)
---
Ghost Face Gang!
---
Not on my screen
---
Again, which is why it is supposed to be favorable for the killer, but FAIR to the survivors on a 1 v 1, with diminishing chances. 
---
If it was a certainty that killers can catch a survivor in 15 seconds, why would you play as either survivor or killer.
---
The core of the game is actually a 1 v 1 in chases. That is a fact. It is the point of a chase to delay the killer the best they can. 
---
Survivors should have a disadvantage, but should still have a chance to escape if they can outsmart the killer with the little delay tactics and tricks they have. The longer a survivor is not able to escape, the less their chances. 
---
Without the capability to fight back and a chance for escape (or at least delaying being hooked), it is not fun for the survivors.
---
The balance for Spirit is off because they cannot deploy smart tactics to escape or delay. They can only make guesses, and that isn’t what you want in a 1v1, even a lopsided one. It wouldn’t matter if the other side is a real person or NPC if all you have is guesses to try to escape. For a survivor, you don’t feel like you are using skill to escape or delay the killer, it just feels like playing a game of Rock Paper Scissors. For a killer, you could just as well be playing against NPC’s that randomly walk and run in different directions.
---
I mean the underlying issue currently is that Nurse and Spirit are like the only two killers who can handle 'skilled' players in the first place. Thats always been more of the beef with Spirit and Nurse changes, that when 90% of the Roster cant handle even halfway optimal survivors. Nerfing the two that can somewhat causes concern, yes the changes did not really do much, but its the precedence that they are willing to lower that top bar down, instead of bring the lower bar up.Killer were the butt monkeys for the better part of like 2 years in this game, you start nerfing or tweaking the Top Tiers killers, its reasonable we can get very nervous about that.
---
So don't really need more changes to make the Spirit weaker for skilled survivors, skilled survivors already have a fairly large lead. Let a few killers require counterplay that is not complete defined by how well you can loop.
---
But they require other players to actually interact.
---
&gt;Which shows how depressing the issue has become. There are just so many example of “toxic” behavior.
---
Not really, most of the things people consider "toxic" is just people playing the game so I don't think it shows anything. If anything, often times it shows inexperience when you complain about survivors body blocking, looping, etc. 
---
Now, post game chat offense it is indeed toxic.
---
I never said anything about playing fair. I said camping in general is an ineffective way to play, and when killers do it usually in response to survivors "being mean" or just because they don't know better, that doesn't change it.
---
I only started to play dbd again in the last month but I played a lot of Mike when he came out then I got the glitch where everything was deleted.
---
Well u should know this by now, dummy.
---
I got camped by a Mikey with noed today... he was in tier 3...
---
Ouch and same
---
I present to you,
---
[Three minute match](https://youtu.be/hxkk5sH6zRI)
---
Those sounds can easily be mistaken for something else
---
Touché
---
You act like it's impossible that they were running to help the downed survivors and they paused because the killer was picking a survivor up, and noticed the size difference. You're overreacting.
---
The only reason I use noed is for that little bit of speed. And I do 99% people. Also my ruin always gets destroyed instantly.
---
Agreed. And because there is nothing to do about it, it won’t stop.
---
Dbd is a ~~love~~ hate relationship. It potential to be the best horror game for a very long time but the devs are honestly holding it back. They know what they are doing to, theres a reason they stopped the dev streams
---
That’s an even worse reason to use it. Stop using it. Seriously.
---
Does rank 20 mean he's new or a veteran?
---
I don’t know if you knew this already, but her shards clearly glow when she is phasing. However this can be hidden by some cosmetics, so I think the devs should fix that.
---
But other than that, she’s fine.
---
I don't get what's wrong about this video
---
shes like the wraith and the nurse had a baby
---
What Huntress mask did you have to grind for?
---
Oh ok, thanks
---
*sniffles*
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Take this game way too seriously my dude.
---
i agree, it's amazing how long it takes the devs to create one killer and survivor and 6 perk ideas, on top of everything else they can't pull off or fix within a half a year time period. at least the guy in charge of perk balancing might also change 2 perks this patch if we're lucky, wowee
---
You're cray if you think people who play spirit can play just as effectively without scratch marks. MD ring is pretty meh, prayer beads were obviously the broken add on
---
yea yea I know I was just generalizing. Also even tho a Dwight isn't a baby Dwight, there are more chances for the killer to let you get hatch when you are using Dweet
---
I was asking because in the stream they said she was over performing and that was their reason in nerfing her , I was think what if there is a increase in billy mains it’ll be thing to worry or not
---
That doesn't mean shit. You think just because it's rank reset Killers magically face survivors 5 to 6 levels higher than them? That's not how it works.
---
No thanks
---
Still to op tbh. But the devs have to pander to the whiny killer mains. Being a survivor is so hard nowadays
---
God no
---
Exactly!
---
Or...or maybe all of us Dweets *are* babies and we just don’t know it...
---
It's kind of weird actually when ever someone gives me a rude message or just the normal EZ camper crap I always just reply with "thanks man gg!" And most of the time people just reply back with gg being nice in chat kinda does a 180° on how the people reply. And every now and then I'll get a message that's surprisingly wholesome and that makes it worth it.
---
The ultimate nerf is she being made a survivor
---
Sorry but no thank you...
---
Cross platform save?
---
I think billy is a good benchmark for what other killers should be adjusted toward
---
I think too many people whine instead of getting better at the game and the devs cave. Freddy is next
---
How exactly does one "abuse" collision? The Spirit is essentially blind while phasing aside from sound cues. If a survivor has Iron Will or isn't injured and is smart enough to stop running during a chase... collision is literally the only "sight" the Spirit has while phasing. I fail to see how that can be "abused" when it's being used for it's intended purpose?
---
Fuck keys man, it’s a bail out for bad survivors who lost to a killer (usually). Same with moris, bad killers get a bail except moris give shit points whereas survivors can still get good points with a key
---
Source for this?
---

*cough* Billy’s Tuning Guide *cough*
---
Can confirm, killer main here, double digits minimum.
---
Yup, it’s a lot but definitely doable. I have like 50K saved up right now.
---
I did see someone else here say that it could be an ancestor who is upset with how their line turned out and wants revenge on them for becoming failures
---
The thing is he _used_ to be great. I excel at Killer now using stats I learned from him over a year ago. When to break pallets, how to mind game certain things well, etc. The thing is, Scott is just way fucking better at those things. Tru3 is more of a beginner learning kind of person. Scott can teach Rank 1's new things. But I think people feel so attached to when they learnt from Tru3 that they can't move on. Plus you can just see, Tru3 is so burnt out on this game but he built his career on it so he can't really stop.

13 spooky
---
No, she will be a set piece in the Gideon meat plant. Just sitting there with a reverse bear-trap on her head that will go off whenever the gates are open.
---
Yes and no I personally don't use it but if your character is low lvl it's a hell of alot better than most other perks you may have. Like when I prestige my freddy the first time first 4 perks I got were deerstalker . Thrill of the hunt monstrous shrine and noed. And I shit you not it kept throwing these perks and other shitty perks forever. Was like lvl 25 before I got my bbq and pgtw
---
Oh, and Save the Best for last for Otz.
---
They nerfed the twitch when she's vaulting.
---
imagine if you got stuck on the rooftop
---
You’re only 12? Nice job man! I was terrible at drawing at your age. One thing I gotta say is- Don’t be afraid to use a ruler.  Professional artists use rulers all the time, drawing that many consecutive straight lines would be painful.
---
Something else is that it kinda looks like you drew the design of the mask on the shape of his face- next time it might be better to think of the mask as a separate piece.
---
(Also- not related to your drawing, but as an artist I encourage you to keep drawing full pieces like this. I only ever did line art and sketches when I was younger, and now I have no idea how to colour. Keep up the good work!)
---
make her go at spirit world speed always but only let her interrupt, however if she interrupts all gens get 10% progress
---
Maybe self promotion? Either way I don’t agree with downvoting that’s just silly.
---
Too op. Make it 1.5 gens.
---
Not what I said. But you can't argue that it isn't easier during rank reset.
---
**The Best:** Hex: Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel
---
**Very Solid:** Discordance, Sloppy Butcher, Corrupt Intervention
---
**Pretty Good:** Surveillance, Thrilling Tremors, Dying Light, Infectious Fright, Thanatophobia
---
**Meh:** Surge, Overcharge, Knock Out, Tinkerer
---
**The Worst:** Remember Me, Hex: Huntress Lullaby, Unnerving Presence, Coulrophobia
---
Just my personal thoughts on each reducing perk and aura/location-reveals to help reducing perks. Basically, Ruin and Pop Goes are the best.
---
Iron Will, Dance With Me, Quick and Quiet, Spine Chill. Boom. There's your "Spirit Killer" build. You will lose a phasing Spirit 90% of the time with this build, and when she's not phasing - she's the equivalent of a non-blinking Nurse; so you shouldn't have any trouble looping her or losing her if you're a skilled survivor. 
---
Inb4: "I don't/can't/won't use those perks". Alright, so there *is* a counter... but you just don't use it.
---
Oh that’s why it looks weird
---
Freddy isn't the killer though. The real killer is William Afton in the original Bonnie suit. Freddy is one of the children he murdered trying to get revenge
---
Considering I lost my Huntress, David, Hillbilly, and Kate cosmetics last month with no response from support, I think it's a godsend. I can't play my Hound Mama without my mask D':
---
Pig: Oinks
---
Mcote: So you have chosen... Death.
---
just remove insta saw
---
That's.. not how that works though. He still has collision when he stalks. Only time Survs can pass through the Killer is with a speed boost from being hit.
---
Yeah, but Freddy is a more recognizable face.
---
LOL I was just thinking about this because my boyfriend listens to me while I play survivor and he laughs EVERY time I tell a teammate that a killer “has barbecue and chili,” and thinks it’s weird that a killer could equip “prayer beads.”
---
Agreed. Although it’s not perfectly safe. But it’s usable. And more fun with mind games. Remember it’s 4 survivor vs 1 killer
---
And your argument is ?
---
Very true
---
Afton could be a survivor, possibly. I dont really know, kinda just trying to come up with ideas.
---
No. And I'm a survivor main, sometimes it sucks, deal with it. Move on to the next game. Honestly this post shows what's wrong with this community.
---
Or the Mom. Spirit and her Mom working together with The Entity to punish the Father forever in The Fog. Japanese lore loves scorn women Oni and spirits in folklore. But then again it’s most likely the dad turned into an Oni as punishment for his crimes.
---
Didn't have another way to do it patch.
---
Prayer beads was never the problematic add-on. The ring was.
---
Yeah but the game is not perfect so they should have a priority
---
🤢........🤮
---
I mean, I made the thing if I plug my stuff can I at least should be able to say hey I made this.
---
Sometimes it doesn’t count if the killer quits out real quick after a match. Other than that I did all of mine with survivor.
---
if you mean everybody will still disconnect, then yes
---
I was just going to point out that we’ve been matched up so much and we should play swf.
---
There he go
---
Well legacy for everyone seems fair as well.
---
When she is ready for some teir 3
---
the fact that more than half of killers aren't viable against rank 1 survivors without luck or cheesy tactics is a pretty severe problem
---
You shouldn’t rely on it like all the other baddies who can’t play without training wheels.
---
If there's a better way to record it lmk. I'll happily repost it. Don't just bitch.
---
Yay! Miss his channels and content so much. They literally brighten my day when I’m having a bad one.
---
I'm just a ho for blood points so yes to bbq
---
Yeah with collision change survivor can just break LOS and walk to any direction.
---
That's because you are bullying them, asshole.
---
That's not one of the things they'll be giving to everyone I don't think
---
This is actually the best time to play Plague. cleansing from fountains counts as healing yourself, and medkits can still be spent on downed people or paired with a stypic or syringe to quickly use up. Meaning she gets to actually use her power and have fun.
---
thats the only centurion i acknowledge
---
“I was the nicest one.”
---
It’s in[the devs patch notes for the upcoming update](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/103996/) . They are changing speed after phasing, adding a vault animation, removing collision, and changing a lot of the add ons. There’s more tweaks mentioned that I can’t remember rn
---
Billy is fine my dude. Plenty of counter play and plenty scary in the right hands
---
yeah, the bugs are a huge killer too, it's amazing how ones such as the wake up bug, legion bug, even the 2017 christmas bug where any killer could use the chainsaw was around for. for a company that has 500+ employees, it's disappointing to say the least with how long it takes them to make any decisions and get anything done just for it to be half-assed most of the time. 
---
also sorry for all the downvotes someone is stalking me because i said exclusive timed cosmetics shouldn't be given away earlier so now they've devoted their life to this
---
I just played Billy and dumped points into Hag. Billy is one of the strongest killers even with just vanilla perks. He is the killer I played to get better perks in general and is a strong choice to play for that reason.
---
Not really the case here...I'm beating the survivors usually pretty damn well. If I get them before they get gens done I don't get chase points. If I get chase points they get gens done...
---
I once had a salty post game survivor try to argue Bubba is A-tier. People really don’t like basement builds.
---
Don’t make it sound like I took credit for the whole thing I literally said that “I didn’t make/draw it I only edited it”
---
Ah ha
---
Sorry for spelling i meant not not now in the first part
---
Good thing I brought my Fragrant Tuft of Hair  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
OwO
---
Why did you tell him your age? Lmao
---
That’s exactly how I feel mate lol.
---
lol
---
Lots of survivors do it too, yet you're not complaining about it. Chill out, it seriously dosen't matter
---
People have lives outside the game, so those people who couldn't make it are no longer sol. Exact same thing can be said for legacy. Even if you were playing when they handed out event cosmetics if you hadn't don't the work you wouldn't get the reward.
---
Lmao
---
Cooking laza sights
---
Nothing like thoroughly getting my cheeks clapped by a killer who played well rather then tunnel and camping.
---
take 1 for the team was your last trophy? highly unlikely
---
If you've expeirienced the full package it is really angering.
---
You really have to intentionally play poorly and dickishly, if you want to speed up the time to get this. I ran Empathy, Borrowed Time, and Iron Will for the longest time just to get quick unhooks and hope the killer wouldn't tunnel. I gave up that strat as I got bored, but it certainly got me close to the 250 needed (no tracking, but I'd guess around 200 when i switched back to a normal loadout)
---
Just the main game or actually ALL of them?
---
I’ve always said it, half the killer have daddy/mommy issues
---
Bhvr wants to remove grey market code selling so they made most exclusives free.
---
Legacy accounts are sold for THOUSANDS on the grey market, so yhey should be free
---
Gotta say that as somebody who got the skins illegitimately, not buying them, and also grinded the fuck out of the event cosmetics I feel very down. At least I felt special for a few years I guess.
---
The the the the the
---
I appreciate that a lot! Thank you!
---
I'm pretty sure the new killer is going to be the spirit's great ancestor.
---
I had to turn my volume down real low
---
I have a game like this yesterday where claudet was the last one alive I knew exactly where the hatch was  Prior to killing her last teammate because it was at the point where it would spawn I was attempting to show her where it is in the only way I knew how my standing just out of range and throwing my hat in the direction I wanted her to go and then walking that way and walking back the other way so she would get the hint she just kept running eventually I had to give her the mean smack and carry her to it.
---
Tbf that was cool
---
Yeah I play both sides, you get used to it. People are gonna be dicks and that's that
---
Well now a killer can teabag back to survivors who already do it, we are NOT nerfing a mid tier killer
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, but that approach does mean that you'll all be injured vs an M1 killer and in certain areas of the map that can mean free downs.
---
Feral frenzy also has incorporated detection after you hit someone and as a killer information is very precious for your gameplan. You can also use it for mobility to block pallets/vaults, cancel it and get M1 hits.
---
Overall i wouldn't say the power is as weak as people think it is. Sure, there are more threatening killers out there, but legion can be quite deadly when used right, vs most teams.
---
THERE'S A LEEK IN THE BOAT!
---
Ugh just stop
---
Why are these not uncommon? Seriously
---
Dont worry about it m8. Most of my comments about dbd end in being downvoted
---
I dont join in on the "let's worship the devs" circle jerk so my opinions arent really welcome BUT idgaf because I know there are more that agree with me but are afraid to say anything. I sacrifice my karma so they dont have to
---
Nurse

“lick my rabbit mommy!”
---
For real? I haven't seen that in a long time
---
Get that ehp while waiting for lobbies son 💪🏿
---
That survivors refuse to learn.
---
Hot take: prayer beads was not the strongest add-on
---
 It was only strong when used with add-ons that gave you a fuckton of movement speed.
---
Yessss
---
selling green medkit 25k
---
Same rumors said Jason blundel was a drunk and leaked a bunch of stuff while drunk. Then was fired. Which he wasn’t. So I’ll believe it when I see it.
---
They shouldnt realease event items just as the bbq, and lunar event items, everything else is fine
---
Yep. It gets very very annoying. I’m gonna get downvoted by those people now, like it’s a cute outfit but if the devs say they have no way of making it work, then stop asking. Sorry lol it’s frustrating seeing it everywhere
---
Agreed. Lets also give survivors a crouch transition too.
---
We had a little thing going, don't pretend you've never in your life tbagged, even in jest...one tbag after a good move, I'm soooo toxic, see's 30 seconds of a game and I'm a bullshitting dick...
---
This isn't meant to be a kick in the face to someone like HIM, it's meant to be a kick in the face of someone who got a hold of one of these rare, highly sought after items and decided to gouge someone else of their money.
---
I have some of these grinded event items, but I think this is brilliant. Finally a Dev team cares about someone gouging their fanbase with this stuff.
---
the real fact is that that person is going to discover their own identity and feel happy and free and make all kinds of cool friends while just being theirself, and you won't be there for it. have fun in the "real" world bud
---
At rank 3 you get a 15% speed boost at full stacks. That reduces the time to complete a gen to 69.5 seconds. Which is a 10.5 reduction of normal repair time. If the survivor is using a brown toolbox it would only take about 61.5 seconds to complete a gen. If four survivors work on a gen it will only take 25 seconds for it to run. 
---
It would be a very powerful perk with those numbers
---
Yet people don’t complain about swing chains, or jump-rope
---
What is “overperforming”? I see this stat of 60% kill rats thrown around.. but 2 kills is usually a black pip *at best*.
---
I’ve been wondering about this. I thought they changed DS so it wouldn’t make you the obsession until after you used it?
---
It seems like this is a glitch for several people. Seriously hope they fix it soon.
---
we all know where this is going
---
and im ok with that
---
Knowing what killer you were facing based on the hooks
---
Small Game revealing set traps when close enough
---
...And Trapper being to place traps right under the hook with no option to side unhook
---
Wraith farmers bing bonging EVERYWHERE
---
Being able to repair all 8 gens even after the first 5 were completed
---
Waiting out the NOED timer
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Good times!
---
who on earth is complaining about spine chill? I've never had a game as killer and thought "damn, if only they didn't have spine chill"
---
juggling doesn't work anymore but ok
---
As a newer nurse main, I really struggled when the nerf came out. My 4ks dissappeared and I couldn't get anything done. I even refused to play for a bit. Since then, I have swapped perks and adjusted my playstyle some, and now am styling on survivors again. Top tier killers have been anticipating a nerf to spirit, but a weaker S killer won't drop below A or B+ after a single nerf. Nurse got an addon and base kit nerf, but she is still usable. Perspective people, perspective.
---
Not really the point of the post, which is why I said half serious. The spine chill thing is referencing lower tier killers who show promise and strength but no doubt will be targeted when survivors run out of actual targets like Nurse and Spirit.
---
If it gets me out of the house and maybe a beer I'm down to do it. 🤷‍♂️
---
Leave DS Alone, just go after someone else, and if you happen to kill multiple in short time frame just slug. It doesn’t hurt
---
I just left the for Honor subreddit to see this and I got severely bamboozled
---
You don't know how many times I tried to be nice to a fuck ton of survivors and them just t bagging the end like I was tuneling and camping the whole game
---
What's BM?¿??
---
That your argument is bullshit.
---
if the killer doesn't tunnel it becomes useless
---
When Mori's didn't need a hook first.
---
An oni could be a devil, ogre, troll. Many different translations and perspectives of it. The devs want to mislead us but claim no one had guessed right, could be a bait obviously. But I doubt they’d make it this easy for us.
---
That's why I was thinking you should just slug a few of them here and there because it might deter them from DC if you dont hook them right away. I dont know
---
My counterpoint is that your argument is bullshit. There are a number of reasons for them to do what they did, pointing at Legacy and whining "what about theeeemmmm" isn't a valid argument. Google what-about-ism if you want to learn more.
---
Bad manners. So tbagging, flash light clicking, tunneling. All that fun stuff.
---
Glitch? This used to happen with plagues corruption pre patch
---
Trimming tool boxes
---
Bro... he was stunned doubt he could see it
---
Oh, well literally just copying half of what I said and throwing in a random sentence in the middle is a poor way of doing so. 
---
&gt;If you were trying to do this, put a &gt; before the sentence.
---
And please explain how my point is bullshit.
---
When NOED was a wasn’t a totem.
---
Aww this is so wholesome and sweet :)
---
thank you, but don’t let this distract you from the fact that I’m a filthy spirit main! haha glad she’s getting reworked tho
---
Jojo! This it the last of my hamon! Take it!
---
Freddy having addons that slow down gen progression is an issue imo - I don't think any killer should have that as part of their kit, even if there's a specific requirement... Such as being asleep. 
---
Most Freddys run Ruin, PGTW and even sometimes Dying Light... All together with his addons - it is very much bullshit and extremely difficult to counter. Doesn't matter how good you are. Solo survivors suffer the worst too.
---
I think the gen progression addons should remove his ability to put survivors into the dream world when attacking them OR allow them to wake up at ANY alarm clock. Survivors spend a lot of time asleep and it's often not worth running to the other side of the map to wake up when he's got the addons on... Cause otherwise no hens would get done.
---
Right back at you bud. Let's part ways here and stop wasting each others precious time with bullshit that neither of us really care about. Sound good?
---
"The Lighthouse" power: is a fucking lighthouse bio: He's a evil scientist that jk still a lighthouse
---
All of us stepped into a trap(per)!
---
Probably a bug of some sorts, I've been playing survivor and the challenge is working just fine.
---
Okay buddy. Whatever you say.
---
No dats big brain time
---
I played a game earlier today where Ruin had been destroyed before I could even reach the center of the map. I swear they must have literally spawned with line-of-sight to my only Hex. Its ahy I almost never use the. - they're too swingy. Either I get no use out of it because it gets cracked near-immediately, or it spawns actually hidden and they never had a chance to find it.
---
Congrats on 43 prayer!
---
Where?
---
Because I run urban evasion and crouch walking is my natural state.
---
Also, if you're running Monitor, your TR is just small enough that if you crouch as soon as Whispers turns on, the survivors will never hear your TR. Monitor is a pretty good Amanda perk.
---
Thatd be a fantastic change! Much better than my idea tbh
---
I'm glad you understand now. I present a valid argument and you run away.
---
Not at low ranks though. Your bitch random teammates will cleanse, and you’ll be one hit and extra loud while she has corrupt purge
---
Huntress' mother was obviously alone at her time of death, besides Huntress herself, or Huntress would have had a relative come back and collect her. It seems like her mother knew everything Huntress had learned about hunting, so Huntress' only advantage in terms of performance would be greater physical adaptation to the practice. She doesn't have anything like snares or evidence she understands guns, like her mother likely would, nor can she figure out that other creatures need food to survive for baiting or keeping little girls alive, like her mother was able to.
---
I noticed that but we all have our killers we like, some of just have worse taste than others ;)
---
Doubt it. I honestly don’t see actually good Spirits. Just soundwhores and those that get collisions for downs. And those that used Prayer Beads.
---
ure very devoted
---
That's true, maybe dont give the trapper the noise notification if you do it that way? Plus you could knock out trapped windows or pallets during a chase that way
---
No, you just parrot the same bullshit counter back and I just dont have the energy to get into a pointless argument with some internet nobody. Sorry, but that's just how the pallet breaks. Have a good day, though.
---
hehe is this all u do here?
---
That kind of suits the lore. In Halloween 2, he walks around and slowly picks people off for the majority of the movie, but by his T3 period he goes from a basement to the outside of the building in about 20 seconds.
---
It's just the nature of the lower framerate on console as well as playing with a controller. The best you can do is practice getting very close to them but baiting a juke BEFORE you hit. Then tap the button, don't lunge, as long as they are somewhere on your screen and within hit range, the aim lock will get them, but it doesn't work with a lunge.
---
&gt;hehe is this all u do here?
---
?
---
Same.
---
BTW, don't you dare to chase the person that hit you with DS.
---
You're still here?
---
There are many things that can trigger me in DBD when it comes to incompetent teammates.  Running a Killer over to me and/or a teammate after an unhook is definitely one of them.
---
r/expanddong
---
Which is why she's the cutest killer.
---
Aw did I hurt your fee fees. Your argument is people earned legacy and didn't earn event cosmetics. Your argument is demonstrably false and complete bullshit. You really can't see that you are just wrong can you? All well can't fix stupid. Have a nice night.
---
He did that to me too lol.
---
It is tough sometimes because the fps seems to just drop sometimes making it hard to see. I've been on both sides of the situation, both juking and being juked. Maybe increasing your camera sensitivity a little bit could help. If you know a survivor likes to try and juke, back up before you swing in order to see them turn and then swing.
---
1. Get used to it. 1 killer can do it while all survivors can (and do).
---
2. You're wanting to nerf a killer's ability because you're annoyed by some Ghostface players doing something (spamming CTRL) that gives them no gameplay advantage. 
---
3. 2 SECOND TRANSITION? YIKES!!!
---
Maybe let's remove flashlight spam and fast crouching from survivors so they can't "be toxic?"
---
Again, get used to it. If it makes you that mad, DC. They're camping you anyway. What a ridiculous request.
---
Same thing with survivors for Adrenaline and DS.
---
Melee Resistance helps me be toxic on my loops
---
You have to get all 20 in a single game
---
Lol probably one of the most needed. You shouldn’t be able to just catch a survivor at the window with no feedback. Or anywhere at that. Spirit got the changes she needed thats all there is to it
---
Isn't that on the killers branch? Maybe it's meant to be for the killer, I'm on it now and will let you know if it works
---
Ehhh definitely not top 3
---
OG Michael is scary because he seems to kill for ANY reason, yet not NO reason except for the people he "marks."
---
So he chose to kill Laurie. He'd kill anyone and anything that even might inconvenience him in killing her, but nothing that couldn't. We don't know why he chose to kill Laurie in the modern continuity, though, where they're not related and he's not cursed.
---
Rob Zombie's was just angry. Not even Michael, really, just a normal serial killer who's on the quiet side.
---
If you have Legion he's an even better BP farm.
---
Okay boomer
---
I'm sorry you feel like you hurt my feelings. I thought we could just ignore each other amicably but I see it's just a pissing contest with you. 
---
You are wrong.
---
Legacy is a reward. Why isn't P3 just given to us, huh? I mean, I don't have it and want it so why don't the devs just give it to me? 
---
Please, grow up and get over it. You're honestly a little sad, pestering me over and over about something I said I no longer have any interest in. Get a hobby. Hey, go try your hand at the new archives challenges. They look difficult but fun, I'm sure that will keep you occupied. Have a nice day.
---
I think you misread his comment, he is saying spirit and freddy don’t need it
---
If u interrupt the locker entry/leaving yes
---
She scares crows though.
---
I thought surge was pretty good? I mean an 18% total regression that can hit multiple gens?.
---
Ok thanks
---
So it specifically has to be interrupting entry/exit and not just finding them in the locker.  Thanks for the info.
---
Gotta get that last word in huh. That's a sign of a pretty childish and/or petty person, normally, but hey I'd hate to make assumptions about you personally. Maybe go try the archives challenges, they look tough but fun. Should keep you occupied for awhile.
---
wait this is real? I thought it was a place holder or something
---
*Timer hits 3 seconds* 
---
*killer activates lag switch*
---
How do u get that flair? I want it lol
---
Ghostface isn’t next, they’re gonna start bidding killers
---
I mean honestly, that's like saying "Can we all come together to remove bad people from the earth"
---
It's inevitable. It's a video game. There's going to be people you don't like.
---
She’s good enough without addons. Literally a 176% speed killer when phasing bud. If you’re nothing without them, you don’t deserve them
---
ok boomer
---
In a game like DBD that’s so “onto the next one”, having one cosmetic piece among the hundreds is unnoticeable. Aside from Legacy clothing or the most recent releases outfits, most people either don’t recognize or care you had an outfit piece that would take longer to explain how you obtained it than the tiny bit of “oh cool” someone says after you’re done. 
---
If you want to appreciate your work to getting something, that’s totally fine. But if you feel personally attacked/hurt that everyone gets a cosmetic because not everyone was playing dbd when you got some random cosmetic piece and you somehow feel entitled to being part of some select club when in reality all you were was lucky/fortunate to be playing during a period of time, that’s on you for overvaluing a cosmetic. 
---
Unless you’re wearing that outfit in every single game, you’re not worried about the “effort” you’re just worried about about not feeling special.
---
Ghostface isn’t even OP, why would he be nerfed?
---
Theyre not that bad. I think people are more upset about the concept of “x killer is unfun pls nerf” and then jumping to the next strongest killer and saying the same thing.
---
I hope ghostface doesn't get nerf he's the only killer I love playign
---
*still here*. Lol I'll read your wall of text later, I promise
---
If you want to find totems easily, run a red map with double range addons.  You end up with something around a 16M range where you will see totems through walls with just a single charge of the map, and it tracks it all for you fairly easily.  If you need to be cheaper, a green map with the addon that lets you track killer belongings + Range up will get a weaker effect.
---
It's also just good in general with how many Trappers there are atm.  Can help you scout out for any nearby traps so you can clear em out or avoid them safely.
---
:/ you're pretty lonely huh? Do you want to have an actual chat?
---
Event cosmetics are rewards too. Your argument is bad.
---
Lurking in my comment history I see. Dude, get a hobby. Try the Level II Tome.
---
People, use Mindbreaker instead of Ruin. It cant be cleansed
---
Only bbq for me.
---
Yup, You can earn these as the killer
---
You honestly don't see that you are arguing on my side? The event cosmetics were an award. You want it so why don't the devs just give it to you. Oh wait they did. You argue for me lmao. Please, grow up and get over it. You're honestly a little sad pestering me over and over about something I said I no longer have any interest in. Get a hobby. How bout you admit you are wrong or quit replying to me? Who here replied to an hour's old post to argue with me? You started this shit with a bullshit argument and now that you are proven to be wrong you just keep replying. Go suck an egg lul.
---
When all you can do is try to insult me over and over. I thought you were leaving?
---
If you think they're going to actually buff killers now, I have a bridge to Mother's Dwelling to sell you.
---
Unfortunately, the reddit is used primarily to vent and to meme.
---
Any actual discussion is just met with barely any interaction, and don't even try to discuss builds on here (Since if it's not top tier meta, it sucks)
---
Nah, neither Spirit or Nurse are/were being nurfed into the ground. They're still playable and both will/can still do well after the adjustments. These overreaction posts are unnecessary and getting beat like a dead horse.
---
Reverse Tear Brap
---
Removed for oversaturated content
---
It does elicit an oh shit from me lol.
---
I've noticed that too.
---
waaah-let
---
Nurse is still the strongest killer in the game, for sure. Before and after Spirit’s nerf, Nurse post-rework is still undoubtedly the most powerful killer in the game, if you only consider basekits.
---
The cooldown to Nurse’s kit is annoying and a little unnessecary, but it did not make her fundamentally weaker. It made her harder to play, but her full potential is still the same as it always was. It’s harder to get to that full potential, but still possible.
---
She *would* be fundamentally weaker if, for example, she couldn’t blink through walls on the second blink, or her second blink range is reduced (or the whole blink range altogether), or her fatigue timer increased which gives survivors more distance.. Changes like those would make her fundamentally weaker (and those are absolutely horrible changes, I’m just using them as examples).
---
However, the cooldown didn’t change her full potential all that much. She’s still as powerful in her base kit, a 2 second cooldown isn’t that bad. Especially when it starts at fatigue, which already takes 3 seconds if you lunge at the first blink, essentially making you wait 1 second only if you lunge at first blink. If you lunge at second blink, the fatigue takes 3.5 seconds, 2 seconds per cooldown makes you wait 1.5 seconds for your first blink and another 2 seconds for your second blink, making you wait only 3.5 seconds. Does it make her harder to play? Absolutely. Is she weaker because of it? Absolutely not.
---
This is just my opinion, however. Having mained Nurse before the rework, after the rework and maining many other killers (Wraith, Billy, Nurse, Huntress, Myers, Ghostface, Freddy. I’m interested in playing Trapper, Doc, Hag and Spirit post-nerf though)
---
Aaaaaaaand here you are. Just can't admit you are full of shit can you? Fucking lol. Pathetic.
---
Personally with the chat thing I quite like talking to my opponents at the end usually I get quite nice people and who genuinely like and care for this game only like 1/100 is it a toxic jerk who spews hate like swear words out of a sailors mouth
---
There's literally nothing wrong with wanting that little hit of dopamine for feeling "special" when wearing an earned cosmetic in a video game that is meant to be played for enjoyment and escapism. Playing that down or belittling it is a shitty holier than thou virtue signal and is just as bad, if not worse, than being disappointed that your earned cosmetics are now worthless.
---
I'm sorry you felt like I was trying to insult you, but if you go back and actually read my comments I never insulted you. I was trying to have an actual debate but most of the people here dont want discussion they want a flame war. 
---
Also, still open to chat if you want.
---
How often do you play Killer?
---
In my opinion, DS should deactivate if you heal 1 state (or are healed 1 state), if you begin work on a generator, or if you sabotage a hook. I would also argue that it should deactivate if another survivor gets hooked, but that might be overkill with the other changes as well. And since the counter play to DS is slugging, it should have its time paused while you're in the dying state. If it's there to punish tunneling, then we should make it punish tunneling. Right now it makes survivors unafraid of killers, upsetting the Survivor/Killer dynamic.
---
cranky because you lost
---
That’s scummy dude
---
I mean usually slugs are left on the ground so the killer can slug/hook more people, slugging doesn’t really have a downside for the killer, that’s the point of slugging and why we wish there was a better counter for it. I’ve had to wait through a lot of frustrating slug matches, especially before there was an endgame collapse.
---
I mean his argument is my argument lol. He says legacy was a reward that was earned so it shouldn't be given out for free. Change the word legacy to event cosmetics and that's my damn argument.
---
Yes, I believe that in the lore the Entity fears Myers and lets him do what ever he pleases.
---
How is his leg bending like that!?!?!
---
That's nice to hear! I use console.
---
Happy Cake day!
---
Okay buddy. Whatever you say. The difference between us is I dont care what some random on the internet thinks of me. So I can see there is no point talking with you further. I believe I'm right, you believe you're right. It's an impasse, why chip a tooth banging my head against a wall when I can go have fun and not get heated over a random internet conversation?
---
Seriously though, have a nice day. Hope the weather is nice where you live.
---
&gt;I think chat should be disabled on PC

---
Unless you meant removed forever. Then no, I don't agree with this.
---
That’s why I’m not in a rush for unlocking it. I have CI, which I think is better because I don’t need to defend it, not do I have to worry about losing it in like 20 seconds. The downside is that it can cause survivors to come together to finish an unlocked gen if I’m walking too far from unlocked ones trying to locate survivors. It also becomes totally worthless after what... 80 seconds, while ruin can last all match.
---
I often give constructive criticism but it's very rare, There also needs to be actual effort in a post though, Lazy ones that aren't well thought out are usually targeted among any change to a killer/item/mechanic that's below par or "Fine" in their words.
---
It's almost like they're talking out of their ass lol
---
He's wearing platform shoes.
---
Nurse dropped from S+++ tier to around B+ to A tier.  The overall power of her kit went down a small bit, but her addons were all basically gutted.  BHVR for some reason thought that Nurse needed a Green BP generator addon that requires you to blink past survivors 25 times to just pay itself off was a good idea.
---
You still here? It's 10 p.m here btw maybe when I go to sleep you can get your last word in so you don't have to cut yourself tonight.
---
I guess the Terror Radius and Red Stain are the Entity screwing over the Killers and it just doesn't do that to Ghostface.
---
Sorry, the link isn't working for me. Can you give me the jist of it?
---
Most posts I've seen are just people talking about **event cosmetics**, even code cosmetics owners don't seem to be against it.
---
Wow that's pretty dark. Are you feeling ok? I work night shift so I'll be up all night if you'd like to chat about it.
---
Yeah, what's with that? Ghostface seems objectively better than Michael.
---
yuuuup. he's attempted to insult me and detract from the convo. Some people just can't be reasoned with
---
Good boy get that last word in. Go get it! Get it boy!!!
---
BHVR “that’s where you’re wrong, kiddo” (yeah I’m a little unhappy that I wasted time for those events too...)
---
Sure it does. And a good survivor will recognise the areas of vulnerability and either avoid them, or run early when they hear a heartbeat. Sometimes you do have to heal, sure. But against a base kit legion with gens left is not one of them, save for a few maps (the Game, for example, where the map is small enough that you never know if he's coming for you)
---
Yes, you can use feral frenzy for information, but against an injured survivor, why would you? Then you have to both give the survivor a speed boost and eat a stun solely to try to get information on other players that may or may not be in terror radius, while ignoring the survivor in front of you. You can use it for mobility, sure, but there's no pallet or vault loop that I wouldn't be able to just loop around again during Legion's FF stun. Against an injured survivor, there is basically 0 benefit to using FF, and vastly more significant drawbacks. 
---
I love playing Legion, honestly. He's really good at getting BP, and a STBFL build works surprisingly well on him, as you can double hit your obsession in FF for easy stacks. But if a team of survivors doesn't waste time healing and stays on gens injured, I have 0 chance unless I slug and snowball with STBFL.
---
Doesn't have to be that complicated. Give him predetermined nodes to "teleport" to, similar to Freddy or Demogorgon. 
---
As a rough example, he can target lockers to "teleport" to. The effect would be he phases out on his current character, and the killer perspective switches and jumps out of the targeted locker as another member of Legion. You can balance around the range and transiting time as needed, or even let him "mark" a set number of lockers he can do this to if a hard limiter is needed for balance.
---
This gives off the illusion that you're chased by multiple killers who comes at you from different directions, like the name Legion implies.
---
I don’t think BHVR are gonna give out auric cells for free. And imo it’s good for people who missed the events and weren’t able to get the cosmetics. In the end it’s just a game and everyone deserves to enjoy it.
---
Honestly, I see a lot of bitching about this topic on this sub. Maybe it’s because I don’t play swf a lot but honestly how often does this happen in your games? I’m willing to bet not anymore than once ever 10 games. I am a rank 1 survivor and it is Extremely rare for survivors to 3 gen and everyone escapes after the first death lol.
---
Like I said, I'm here all night if you want to talk. I'm genuinely curious to try to learn more about the person behind such pointless vitriol.
---
Who's a good boy? Yes that's right you are!!! Skit em!!! Get that word in!
---
Maybe they focus on camping generators? I’ve had plenty of games where I have a strong 3 gen setup and will hook someone in that area intentionally, because I’ve got 0 reason to leave. Lol
---
I mean spine chill is legitimately the only perk worth a damn to counter stealth killers now
---
Wish more cosmetics for certain characters were around Jeff has little cosmetics(good ones) same with Adam and meg and killers are also suffering clown and spirit I wish the devs would be more like TF2(old tf2) and allow more community skins  and have votes on which gets added when the new clown skin drops which I assume is gonna be next chapter I’m getting it
---
It just happened 3 times in a row. 
---
Survivors rush the first 4 gens. Then my telltale “you stupid fuckers” is heard once I realize they 3 genned themselves. 
---
Chase one survivor while all 3 gens are at zero. 
---
See both dudes jumping into hatch with BBQ. 
---
And commodity has little to do with imbalance. Just bc something isn’t overly prevalent doesn’t mean it is balanced. That’s like saying pink Moris are fine bc they’re rare.
---
Once keys become more balanced, they basically are good on items.
---
From the killer side (I've been playing a lot of killer lately), the stun is playing at the exact moment the hit registers.
---
Killers aren't exactly a fan of this either though.  Because while it gets hits that have no place landing, it also causes things like gen grabs to be 100% impossible.  Killer gets stuck in the grab animation while the survivor is sprinting away.
---
I'm just going to keep extending my offer to chat, if you're curious. I'm being serious about it.
---
What’s funny is that these accounts have lots of karma and I doubt he would take the time to make an army of alts that look believable
---
Yea perhaps when cross play comes maybe they would add a chat function for y’all
---
&gt;\*Edit - No0b3 flat out tweeted about how he spent $800 for Golden Feng
---
Makes me feel a lot better about some of the stupid shit I've spent money on over the years.
---
Yes you are!!! Never give up!!! Get em boi!!!
---
NOED's basically the late game insurance policy that lets most killers get something even if they pretty much lost the game at that point.
---
Corrupt Intervention lasts for 120 seconds at tier 3 if I'm not mistaken. I only JUST unlocked it and so can't say how good it is personally, but Otzdarva likes it so it must be useful. I've also heard of people using Sloppy Butcher as the poor man's Ruin since it wastes their time by making them heal longer, though admittedly it's less effective.
---
If you're trying to use CI, focus on trying to get a hook before it's done, and if you can chase past the open gens in that time all the better. Taking away almost half the available gens let's you apply pressure to them more easily. Ruin is just king because it artifically applies pressure to ALL gens at ALL times until cleansed.
---
I think this is fair
---
why tf it say sidneys house
---
&gt;Sorry, the link isn't working for me. Can you give me the jist of it?
---
There is an option to hide chat on PC.

That's the point of prestige... To have the symbol and clothing there's no other benefit but you still have a choice not to so it's your own issue if you do
---
&gt;Hex: The Third Seal  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;All totems will appear as dull totems to Survivors while under the effects of The Third Seal.
---
This is a really interesting idea that I'd really like to see tested on a PTB. It could be really strong because, especially paired with Ruin, it gets people on Totems right away and wastes a lot of time. However, that's also a downside, because you have people on your totems right away. At first, you'd think it'd be a great pair with Devour, but the second people know that they're under the effect of a totem, it's totem cleansing time and Devour could pop immediately, or whatever your totem is. It also may benefit you, I don't know.
---
Again, this would be super interesting to test, especially at mid and high tier. It could be a great game-slower, great totem protection, or neither.
---
Im pretty mad people downvoted this! It was amazing
---
Then don't Prestige, it's really simple.
---
To be fair, said hatchets also explode mid-air after hitting nothing because they went over a car or a fence or heavens forbid a picnic table
---
Are you really upset just because some cosmetics aren’t exclusive anymore?
---
I have about 7 alts (I got bored and kept making new ones). Each of them I used for maybe 3 months each, each of em have atleast 7k. Not that hard. Also, I was just messing with him. It's Reddit. Place is a joke.
---
Ty for your feedback, I will take it and try to use it.
---
Did I miss an ETA on the Dedicated Servers? I remember thinking actually going to release in a summer. \*CLOWN EMOJI\*
---
Aye but here’s this I chase and down and hook a completely healthy survivor move back to that other fella bam DS hits me and other fella gets off hook what am I suppose to do then?
---
The window infinite/super heal wombo combo.
---
God I felt bad for that and I said I'm sorry lol
---
Wait.. you want Survivors be able to 1v1 in a 1v4 game any killer?
---
Thanks for the insight, I thought it was an interesting idea as well!
---
I know but you don't always have a rainbow Matthew your disposal and most of the time we doubt not to mention sometimes there isn't even a hex on rare occasion.  But like I said that's why I've been memorizing the spawn points because if I don't have what I need then I at least know exactly where to look to have a chance at finding it and we have someone who builds specifically around finding totems

Have you ever heard the band Sun Kil Moon? Its lead by Mark Kozelek, and has its toot in western folk rock from the 80's. It's very relaxing and can soothe even a very angry person. I recommend "Young Love" off his album, Among The Leaves. A great piece of modern folk.
---
He is still posting here? Going to have to detonate this thread because my question had been answered and didn't see it for a playground for toxicity.

my constructive criticism for you is to STFU :)
---
chat cant be disabled on pc? thatd be brutal. ppl can be such a-holes
---
You have got to be full of shit. I mean I'm a killer Main and agree with you but come on, three times in a row? It's happened to me once in my last 100 games. The problem does exist but don't exaggerate it comes off as an obvious lie.
---
It’s not an exaggeration. I acknowledge it’s rare but this shit literally just happened.
---
Hope it helps. The biggest issue is how easy it is for survivors to just turn on a dime since they're in 3rd person. Maybe running shadowborn could help, so you'll still see survivors on the edge of your screen but...it isn't a good perk.
---

If you're going to instigate an argument over something, you should be prepared to talk about it, and *why* you feel the way that you do. The moment I challenged you; you began to call me names and make blanket statements about my argument, despite not being able to properly dispute it.
---
And on top of that, you say that you're leaving and you just keep coming back. You don't need to announce if you're leaving lol. Just go.
---
It means even though it was difficult to get through the end result was good and pleasant. Alls well that ends well. Took me a little bit to understand but it’s a great quote.
---
Flashlight. I asked for advice on how to accomplish this, and someone said aim for the killer's neck when they break a pallet.
---
As I thought but a chapter is generally a full package perhaps they will put spirit and this new killer in same archive since they will be connected
---
Flashlight
---
Wait, the killers have fun? I remenber that play killer was only stress swf, keys, the gens done in four minutes with out ruin, the gens done in five minutes with ruin
---
Yeah that could be a fun idea.  Maybe if they really wanted to go all-out each member would have different strengths/weaknesses so you basically could switch out characters based off of that.
---
Yeah man

Oh, maybe. Dude it's hard as hell to type on a controller though lol I have to use my phone.

Keys are super easy to counter.
---
Haha imagine buying a reskin of base Feng
---
Anyone else think of GlennOck?
---
I see less ebony moris but i still think they are a problem. It shouldnt be how often you seen something busted happen to decide wether or not its busted. Keys are busted moris are busted lets get them fixed.
---
If survivors aren’t expected to run Iron will or any other perk to counter Spirit. I should not be expected to run Franklins to counter a key.
---
Your comment is confusing me. The second part lol. Nice constructive criticism, kudos.
---
Please, multiverse daimyo only forward-dodge heavy so they can never feint even if they wanted to.
---
Shouldn't happen at all, ever, because it's complete bullshit.  Your entire team can skip the rest of the game because you brought /  found a completely broken item?  If killers could bring an addon that insta-sac'd the rest of the survivors after killing one, survivors would be screaming for a nerf / patch NOW 24/7.
---
I've been tempted to do that myself but I play more Survivor than I do Killer so I tend to be a nice Killer as a result.
---
Until I get that super sweaty Survivor team that doesn't allow me to have any fun at all.  Then I regret my decision to be nice.

So is wiki incorrect then? Wiki says that the survivor(s) inside her husk terror does not hear it, but everyone outside it does. Also nondirectional.
---
It should only be 9K per character. I bought Jane and Plague for shards shortly after they were released.
---
I just can’t ever aim when the time comes.
---
I've had people bring in keys my last 4 killer matches, only once did it actually get used before killing them all though.
---
Yeah welcome to the people getting pissy because they can't flex their "exclusive" dress up items
---
That's a lot of leaks.
---
As a generally nice Killer who mostly plays for bloodpoints I just take BBQ and then usually hold off on Ruin unless I'm really in a mood/want to be super serious.
---
Aim for the neck of the killer first. Then adjust for the eyes.
---
To save someone from being picked up, first aim to the side of the survivors butt. (Lol seriously, it works) Timing wise, if you have a yellow flashlight, you wanna start the blind right as they are hoisting the survivor up with their arm. By this point that should have just picked them up and stood up straight. The MOMENT they stand up straight is a decent time to try it. Do it too early and it won’t work. 
---
Also, the closer you are the less likely it will work. Don’t be miles away but put a bit of distance between you and the killer for blinds. It’s easier that way.
---
Lol this actually happened to me. First ever match I got the meat factory and about 10 seconds after I spawning and I hadn’t even moved yet I turn around to see Michael just looking at me. I wasn’t like Ralph though, I shit myself and legged it.
---
they dont care about consoles
---
big money come from pc
---
teabag is popular pretty much in any game that allows crouching, lol.
---
Ghostface is better than Myers in almost every way. 
---
The only advantages Michael has are (without perks and addons):
---
Increased lunge and vault in Tier 3.
---
More snowball potential. This is benefitted especially with Infectious Fright, but with just base power he can down multiple survivors a lot quicker in some scenarios.
---
But that's really it. Snowballing isn't something you can rely on every game obviously, so it's a situational advantage.
---
The rumors were that he was fired which is still a possibility as we haven't seen or heard anything from him in an extended period of time (I think since before Alpha Omega release) and Activision has lied about firing people before. The alcoholic thing was just spread by idiots and was honestly pretty fucking disgusting
---
Lonely is not an insult, I myself am pretty lonely at times. And if you notice in the same message I offered to have an actual chat.
---
Yes, I said you are whining. You are. Criticism is not an insult. If you think it is you cant grow as a person.
---
If you notice, _again_, if you read the rest of the message I say that I don't mean to make assumptions against you personally. I was serious. I gave my counter argument. I'm sorry that it isn't up to your standards but I gave it and moved on. You're the one who got so hung up on winning good boy points from an internet argument.
---
Sounds good to me. You already have the Tier 1 ones to start, so when you get to P2 you could start with all of them at Tier 2 and P3 at 3.
---
I just feel like they are picking and choosing items; with the same rules not applying to \*other\* cosmetics.
---
Why isnt bloodletting free? That's a code that is sold on the grey market too. (I own it, but this seems weird for them to say one thing and then not have it apply to all things)
---
Also codes have been sold for over 3 years. the grey market for codes is small and mostly dead now. they aren't solving anything by doing this; the codes were finite and almost out at this point. It's too little too late.
---
On top of this, the real problem has been legacy account trading and selling. they go for thousands. Way more than codes and yet bhvr doesn't apply the same logic they used with codes to legacy to stop grey market sellers.
---
this is just stupidly frustrating for no real reason.  the event cosmetics being given away is just a slap in the face to people who had the false pretense of earning an exclusive. it was fun
---
I think Chop Top would make an excellent killer
---
Yeah, I am successful when using CI. There’s just a lot of counterplay to it. Like survivors can just chill at locked stuff if you focus too hard on the unlocked gens. Or it can get too many grouped together for the unlocked stuff if killer goes to try and find them near unlocked stuff. If survivors just hide for the 80 seconds then do stuff when it goes down its basically a worthless perk. I’ve had matches where survivors have done all the above. Kind of depends on the aggression of the survivors.
---
And I’m not the biggest fan of sloppy. Healing seems so strong that it kinda isn’t worth it. I go for stuff like pop because it can set back gen progress so well, especially when you have a 3 gen setup.
---
Sadly I couldn’t find one. It’s probably just a random clip :/
---
And because my reddit is bugged I'll continue here: another good music alternative is Modest Mouse, which has a much more frenzied and chaotic sound but is split with a lot of reflective and melancholic chorus'. I'd reccomend their Good News For People Who Love Bad News album.

---
"Hell yeah, free gens for the teammates"
---
Does removing collision mean I now have to guess which side of the gen survivors are on if I want to grab them off?
---
Where have we found this out? Does this include Jake's sexy leather outfit?
---
Nah, a ton of exclusives still remain not on the list.
---
Prolly downvoting cause they wanna feel special too and wanna have all the cosmetics that they didn’t earn. But yeah I agree with your statement 100% like yeah I’d love the dweard cosmetic but I didn’t earn it and I’m okay with that. Getting the cosmetics now just feels like pity from the devs
---
yea it just upsets me for losing the dweard i worked hard for in a tournament. I took work off and everything to participate and now i feel like it was useless.
---
unless it's a horror singleplayer game, that there is a death wish.
---
Can't lose if I quit
---
Rank reset, what do you expect? I've played about 15 matches tonight and had someone DC in about 13 of those. I'm not even exaggerating.
---
I noticed lol
---
Honestly, I've been DCd on and cheated out of the whole kill button by making me swing, i think I've used a good 10 tufts of hair, and tombstone, overall 2/10 rating, hated the challenge, never doing it again
---
Ghost is better because I cant tell you how many times I've snuck up on people crouching and either grabbed them or spooked them so hard they bail the gen and pop it....lmaooo...leaning is amazing too
---
Spirit nerf was heavy handed. Should have made small tweaks first. I dont like the phase nerf.  Come on can we have killers that are beat by the exact same tactics?

micheal power has no cooldown
---
 with ghostface if you meet one bad player who dosent realize you are stalking him he get punished in micheal case the whole team get punished 
---
plus do you relaize micheal have faster vaulting speed? 
---
and 99ing with ghostface can be a bad idea if you 99them and then they realized you are there they can crouch in a good spot where you cant stalk and get you out of it or even get you out of at the start of the chance where you arent close enough to make a good pop micheal dosent have this problem

that lunge is a beast
---
without addon and perks maybe just maybe ghostface is a lil better cuz of the crouching but how many games have you seen killer play with 0 Add on and no perks
---
put monitor and abuse and dead rabbit and myers is almost 0 teror radius where you cant get him out of which can fuck you a lot mid chase
---

Most of the exclusive convention cosmetics were highly coveted because they were pretty rare.  As a result it led to resellers selling certain skins at exorbitant prices, and the Asian convention ones were the highest priced since, obviously, you would've had to fly out out to Korea/Shanghai/etc.  to get them.
---
Did You Feel Anger
---
Shine it in the killers eyes, it's not that hard to figure out
---
She thiccu
---
but mindbreaker does nothing related to gens...
---
If you don't want to use the perk that counters it, then that's your fault.
---
Honestly it's not a big deal. The only thing I can say its stop them from spawning in matches.
---
Premonition is str8 ass cheeks. You cant change my mind.
---
Are you refurring to the possible killer theory of the Oni being their first ancestor?
---
If so I love you and I agree.
---
Can confirm, I unlocked it soon after saying this and it definitely popped for just being on the gens when they finish, cause there's no way I got 3 generators worth done that match.
---
yeah i don't blame you, i cosplayed as Dwight and went to pax to their booth to get it just for them to give it away, it sucks and i feel you
---
I personally am between either the ancestor or her father. Either way
---
Rin's papa fucked up D:
---
*light light* MISERUM *light light* MISERUM *heavy feint* *light light* MISERUM
---
The survivors can't get a flashlight save if you're too shit to down anyone. \*taps head meme\*
---
Add ones for Meyers are more unique
---
Making trappers step in their tapa is probably one of the most satisfying things in the game though. They should just make him have 2 or 3 trap capacity by default
---
I might use this haha
---
Bloodlust
---
Dude are you prayer flicking? Damn thats cheap
---
As much as the idea of her father being the killer I feel like it’s too connected for it to work. I think the entity wouldn’t take them both at the same time.. and not to mention where the blood come from? Can the entity bring a dead man into its realm and resurrect them?
---
Ok, I have a question for you. Out of every 10 games, how many of those are Prayer Beads Spirits?
---
Press m2 to blind all survivors looking in your direction longer than 3 seconds (altered with addons). Survivors are blinded for 5-10 seconds. 
---
Power has no animation yet it has a load sound, which can and will be spammed.
---
Cannibal, nurse, doc just to name a few.
---
I haven't. I've been playing online for decades and I've never tbagged. It's just a douchebag thing to do. It was in Halo, and it is still. 
---
Tbag = toxic. Just because you think it's funny doesn't make it any less of a dick move.
---
get closer to them if they are in the open they will likely to do a 360 so just do a normal swing dont lunge if you see them heading toward a pallet or a window lunge and go slightly to the left or to the right if they still want to 360 
---
conclusion get closer to them dont overestimate your lunge it not that long and when You attack rotate with them
---
I.e people also lost those event items and BHVR couldn't individually return them
---
aka me, im people.  I lost my event cosmetics and would like them back, whether I grinded for them or not, could also care less that everyone else too if they did or didn't play the events.
---
It's not just losing or winning easily that makes it appealing, it's the silver lining of games being dynamic while still being fun.
---
It's more of a product of the game being assymetrical. Another thing to consider is if they did make the ranking system more firm and competitive like those other games, you wouldn't really be competing against the people you're competing against in a given match. If full on seasonal ranked play was a thing, to get ranks, survivors would be competing with survivors and killers would be competing with killers.
---
Clown has plenty cosmetics lol
---
Could the same be said about survivors who don't use Iron Will to counter the Spirit?
---
This is just for that one specific add-on, which previously removed the sound.
---
Well the entity was playing with Rin's dad. If the ancestor was so mad that his spirit came back, entity would take the spirit so we have 2 ghosts.
---
But what I think might be done is that the ancestor might possess Rin's dad and that's the oni. Have 2 forms, ancestor and dad?
---
Sad the face of dbd is so shit
---
BHVR doesn't care about veterans' and I think nuff' said. I lost my faith in them, you are right. They chose the easiest, yet wrong decision. They betrayed my heart for the second time and this time I'm not going to forgive them
---
Good ones? Only semi decent one is entertainer and the hallowed blight one elifun is gonna be good I hope
---
I informed a baby demogorgon that camping is generally considered bad manners and to be aware that this is something that will probably make the matches really uncomfortable. Poor bebe left chat immediately, I I felt bad
---
Please read what I said. Literally the situation I explained.
---
It's fairly real.  I saw it and I think at least one other person did.  Might just be random bullshit to fill space on the board, though, just hoping no one notices
---
Yes.... impossible skill check doctor is such a nice change of pace...
---
&gt;If killers could bring an addon that insta-sac'd the rest of the survivors after killing one, survivors would be screaming for a nerf / patch NOW 24/7.
---
This is 100000000% true. Wish I could upvote this 1,000,000,000,000 times.
---
Ok ty, I will take into consideration that they may 360 me and don’t lunge at them.
---
I honestly hope the H20 mask stays exclusive to him and him only
---
Decisive and borrowed exist as counterplay, not as punishment. Complaining about "camping" and "tunneling" is bullshit survivors do because they get mad when they lose.
---
&gt; It's not fun to get.......
---
Oh really? It's also not fun to get looped for an extended period of time and get royally fucked by tile spawns.
---
But wait, that doesn't matter right? It only matters what makes things fun for the survivor and gives them the strongest possible chance of survival. 
---
Killers just have things *oh so good* and can give the ol' Thanos snap and BAM! it's a 4k, right?
---
Maybe at rank 10 or rank 15.
---
This bullshit only ever works one way. It's always limiting the power of the killer and forcing him to play in a way that survivors find most palatable. The minute entitled survivors start being willing to stop their looping after a killer-set period of time and surrender themselves for being hooked, the minute anyone will take you guys seriously.
---
Until then, you're just sore losers acting like brats.
---
&gt;So theres only 3 things I would do to fix trapper.
---
according to you*
---
As an unending console player, I 100% strongly agree.
---
That would be cool..
---
But I like the idea (I heard it in a YouTube video, if I find the vid again I’ll link it) that the father may have killed himself. And his blood was absorbed into the mask as it is in the trailer and the Oni was summoned. Because apparently an Oni can only enter our world when someone vile is killed.
---
And I think the idea of a demon being in the entity’s realm is so much Cooler than a ghost. Like we have never gotten a demon and imagine the killers we could get if demons are allowed in the entity’s realm!
---
Either way it’s gonna be a badass killer.
---
Unless he gives his permission to distribute it. 
---
As for now it is still exclusive
---
I’m willing to bet they’re just mad after realizing they paid hundreds of dollars for nothing. But the truly sad part is that they think they’re more important or “dedicated” because they have a skin. Others can love the game just as much if not more without having to pay for what they can’t afford or do things they don’t have the means to do to unlock them. If you were able to get a skin, that’s great and you should be happy to have it and happy that others are able to as well, not unhappy for the shallow reason that it makes you less of an elite.
---
Had this a couple nights back. Killed a guy and was searching for the others and heard the sound of the hatch and was confused then realized they had a key to see the rest of them jumpy through
---
Either way, we get neat stuff :]
---
Once I figure out how to up my fps, ima slashy everyone
---
If only you got the shards with it
---
Can I say the same for survivors who don’t run Iron will against Spirit? Whenever I hear “just use IW” I also hear “I shouldn’t have to run a perk to counter a killer”
---
You got suggestions or are you just going to one line?
---
It’s a horribly childish game with typical *deep edgy lore* and it’s shoved in your face everywhere now. I can’t even walk into a GameStop without racks of plushies/T-shirt’s/funko pops/pencil erasers/keychains/backpacks/hats with FNaF on it.
---
It was a decent game, but in no way deserved the publicity and popularity. It was a point and click game that Tumblr Kids and furries glorified to every fibre of its being. 
---
Doesn’t belong in Dead By Daylight though. FNaF is more of a kids-Horror than anything, and Dead By Daylight has a pretty good reputation with iconic Horror characters, from adult films.
---
I think trapper needs this: 
---
1) Ability to reset traps without having to pick them up.
---
2) Start a trial with all his traps in bag
---
3) Fixated escaping chances (for example 20 seconds to free yourself but 5 seconds if somebody else frees you)
---
I think we all know that Nuxia's face is the single most terrifying thing on this planet
---
Ok thanks :)
---
The new Micheal outfit brings a new meaning to Daddy Long Legs
---
I like it
---
What killer do you main?
---
I can't say why Bloodletting isn't in there; I think there's some Feng shorts/shoe combo that isn't part of it either, and I can't fathom why it wouldn't be.
---
Account trading isn't allowed by the Steam agreement, and if you get caught doing that you can get the whole thing banned, games and all. Not much BHVR can really do about THAT that Valve isn't already.
---
As for the Event Cosmetics, honestly I did both of those events, and have all those items. I don't really mind more people having them, but I am surprised those didn't just go up into the store the way Blight/Chinese New Year 2019 did.
---
Using DS makes it more likely you’re the obsession. If you’re not and you use it, you become the new obsession
---
I'm a filthy legion main, please have mercy
---
1. I could be okay with but they’d have to modify the add-ons so that trapper doesn’t have insane traps to start with.
---
2.  Reloading at locker could be okay if none spawn on the map and he can only resupply from deployed traps or lockers and there was a finite number to acquire.
---
3. Don’t think it’s necessary, most maps have decent enough places for traps.
---
Exactly I even have exclusives and I see no problems with their decision i think it allows more variety and fun for console and new coming players. People need to get off their high horse. But with this community that will mever fucking happen
---
While I would like them, I understood why I didn’t originally get to have them and accepted it. It’s just bullshit that some people:
---
- Literally paid up to hundreds of dollars for some of them and cannot or will not be refunded for this.
---
- People who earned Legacy STILL TO THIS DAY WERE NEVER GIVEN BACK THEIR LEGACY. 
---
- People actually worked hard for some of those (like Legacy) and now their work is just obsolete. 
---
I mean come on, at least give people their feckin Legacy back.
---
&gt;You got suggestions or are you just going to one line?
---
Plenty. I posted them on multiple threads regarding Trapper, can't be bothered to do it again since someone will likely make another thread soon™. Just use the search bar to find existing threads and you might find one with my comment on the matter. 
---
The point is, always important to say "according to me" because just because you think it would be a good idea, doesn't necessarily mean it is.
---
Uumm 
---
Santa
---

---
Lots of knives including a straight razor 
---
Hallowed blight
---
And elefun on the way, compared to like Freddy who has nothing and I know about licensing but even Michael only got one costume
---
those aren’t blood trails, those are smoke trails
---
I’m not a legion main but I am very very toxic with them, I mix my killer up between Trapper Demi and legion.
---
Why do killer freak out when their baby's get changed, nurse and spirit where minor balance changes, chill.
---
not may they will 360 the closer the better dont forget rotate with them oh and when they are flying around just stop for a second and lock your aim then swat them like a fly
---
who says you can’t see that as is
---
You must not have played both sides for like a year since MOM isn't a problem anymore.
---
I use to be a trapper main, until I bought legion. Demogorgonmaborgon is fun too, guess I'd say 2nd main
---
Spirit's use of her phasing power should also complete one generator each time she does it and award each player 5,000 Objective points. That would just about be fair.
---
The codes were mostly not even events or anything, just different people in the community being given cosmetics to give away at times I believe. Like I might be wrong but when AdmiralBahroo played a lot of DbD pretty he was given a bunch of codes to give out.
---
Also the reason they're getting rid of these and making them free is in all honesty not just fair, but an authentically good reason. Those codes still exist and people sell them for insane amounts as well as people scamming by selling fake codes. Simply just making them free for everyone solves those issues as well as the fact console players never had the chance to get these skins.
---
You also can't? 3 survivors left means you need 4 gens done to make the hatch appear. It's always one more gen complete than survivors left, except for with sole survivor obviously.
---
Is it really broken? I have the counter at 23, which seems a little low, but it looks like it occasionally triggers. (Im on PC if that matters)
---
Happy  cake day you beautiful person
---
KENSEI YOU BITCH STOP SWIFT STRIKING
---
What is your steam name? I'm pre preemptively reporting you for tunneling
---
I apologize lol 
---
The roadmap says that it is supposed to release on mobile alongside the next chapter.
---
Problem is they actually do have a way of doing it, they are just too lazy and incompetent to.
---
VIVA LA BUNNY FENG DAMNIT
---
Im confused, why doesnt the trap go off when trying to get out?
---
Isn’t this the definition of tunneling?

Do what you must, *Claudette*

It only takes 1,000,000 bp to get to level 35 in bloodweb. You can essentially get Ruin in 8 hours of playtime. No need to even play hag it's 1 million bp and it was just in shrine so if you're new you gotta earn perks
---
Rip Pallet Vaccumes. 
---
I miss you so much buddy. 😭💔
---
btw, here's the Feng thing I'm talking about.

https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1008150114446807875/6E98AE6AD397B08E19135E4639DD52BC042C5394/
---
It says un-released...does that mean it isn't in the game, then? Or that they had this, and gave it away because it was unreleased?
---
Also, their heads turn back along with their camera. If they're looking back at you, that most likely means they are getting ready for a juke so you can anticipate it and be ready to track their movement to the best of your ability.
---
  
---
However, if you're chasing them but their head indicates that they're looking forward and not at you, you can pretty much go ahead and lunge (provided you're in lunge range).  
---
But don't stress too much over it. The first thing I did when switching to PC was test if the same "jukes" would work there as they do on console. On console you can basically mindlessly zig zag left and right and often the killer will whiff because they can't keep track of you, they get confused (and I've been there too). This hasn't worked once on PC for me, killers just have good framerates and mouse precision, so it doesn't fly there. Killers on colsole have it tough and it takes some time to get used to it.

adding "strategically" before something doesnt mean its different. Its tunneling, is that a bad thing? maybe.
---
I thought it was post game salt at first.
---
*gets hit by DS*
---
"Survivors and their crutch perks!"
---
Shit really pisses me off.
---
How?
---
Guess what t-bagging is fucking funny and any streamer does it too. Stop bullshitting yourself.
---
It's...supposedly still be worked on. SUPPOSEDLY.
---
It's not exactly cancelled, but as you said it isn't released either. I think there was some concern over legal hot water if they actually DID release it...but I really hope it gets out there, somehow, some day.
---
I would leave the traps all over the map but would have them all spawn active. It makes no sense that the "trapper" would not pre set traps.
---
yeah i like it too but the community mostly love the movies killer and put them as a priority first
---
Not gonna lie, I teared up a bit reading that.
---
No you can't dude. The hatch spawns based on how many survivors are left. 
---
* 1 survivor - hatch spawns and opens.
---
* 2 survivors - hatch spawns once 3 generators are complete
---
* 3 survivors - hatch spawns once 4 generators are complete
---
* 4 survivors - hatch spawns once 5 generators are complete. 
---
An entire team needs to do everything but open a gate to escape via hatch. Even 3 survivors still need to have done 80% of the generators before it appears 
---
It's just as balanced as any other rare item.
---
No, immediately pursuing someone right after they're unhooked and refusing to relent even when other opportunities present themselves is the definition of tunneling. 
---
If I see a Claudette I've hooked twice and a Jake on a gen together, in what fucking universe would I go after the Jake? 
---
The game isn't a game of Go Fish where you have to ask everyone in turn "Got any hooks?" before trying to murder them.
---
Except he does have cooldown if he hits a wall or misses so there’s literally no reason to change anything. Billy doesn’t need to be nerfed in anyway not even a small one
---
I thought all this time that the phasing sound was globally heard so long as you were not within the husk terror radius.
---
So does the phasing spirit actually emit the sound non-directionally? With a range, so if you are across the map, you can't hear her phase?
---
They did a few unreleased cosmetics. Like claudette had shorts to go with her brazil shirt.
---
Also with bloodletting I think its still exclusive because it was originally sold by bhvr with fewer codes, where these ones were all given away initially. I meant to resoond with this earlier.
---
What skill? Survivors run in a circle around umindgamable Loops. What skill does that take?
---
Survivors do circles in corn where the killers terrible field of view make it impossible to properly track, what skill does that take?
---
The multiple broken loops on every map that take 45 seconds to complete if a Survivor is in position. These Loops tend to be very close to most of the gens. Can you find me the skill in that equation?
---
Let's not pretend that there's some Mastery on the Survivor side, the Survivor roll is so easy that you don't have to be that good at the game to beat red rank Killers, hell you just need to have a set of headphones and one friend. 
---
This is why when we talk about killer perks or powers (new and old) we always have to have the caveat of "this is really good [except against organized or skilled teams because you actually have no chance with most Killers against these teams, but we all know this so we just pretend it's not a problem]"
---
I've been playing Survivor for 3 weeks now, pretty much since the archives came out. I used to think there was some special skill Mastery involved, that there was some level of play that I wasn't aware of. And I got to say even into purple ranks I don't see any of that. Survivor is just easy mode. I've never broken a sweat once playing and if I get killed it's because of an extremely bad play by me, or an extremely bad play by another Survivor. 
---
I'll play against Killers I typically don't use and see how much better at that killer they are than me, it doesn't matter. I just whooped them into Oblivion and if I ever even one other good Survivor on my team (I play solo so it's a toss up) then I know at least me and someone else are going to escape.
---
I've had consistent trouble against nurses, I've never run into a spirit I couldn't just walk away from pallet and juke. And that's before the Collision nerf. 
---
I just don't see the skill-set you're talking about, I haven't witnessed it. It seems to me the biggest skills on the Survivor side is just knowing how to find a good Loop and abuse it. If you can see the killer there is no mind game, period.
---
Windows are an automatic safe zone. When I'm Survivor, I know that if I have a window that the killer can't touch me. There's no mind game because once they start going through the window I can get to the next Loop and waste more time, then the game is over. There is nothing a killer can do to surprise me if I can see them. So there is no mind game, so I don't understand my survivors are talking about a lack of Mind Games when survivors have *no mind games*. You just run in circles around a loop until you decide to drop the pallet. Where is the mind game in that?
---
So I ask you again, what skill-set are you talking about? Because everything I do is Survivor is an order of magnitude more simple then what I have to do is kill her to even get half the success. It's so laughably easy to abuse the small field of view and disappear when you're standing right next to a killer. You can play extremely poorly as a Survivor even against good killers and be pretty okay by end of a round point wise.
---
I guess I'm just disappointed because I thought there was some cool thing I could learn by playing a Survivor, and what I learned was that this game is just imbalanced (skillwise).
---
It seems like Survivor just overcomplicate what they're doing, and then call it still. There's no mind games, just running a circle find the pallets. The killer will give up and Chase someone else or take 1-2 minutes to down you.
---
Then I got to come and see a very fair balance change for the spirit that address problems that people had with her. Only to see people still complain about it, the same survivors who abused non mindgamable loops all the time are upset because they can't abuse one of the killers.
---
If you want all killers to be as mindlessly beatable as they always have been then I guess we just want different games.
---
nick young confused meme
---
They just released an update. Hopefully its getting just as good as the PC version because I might get it one day.
---
More like survivors anytime they get down and cry for nerfs.
---
Nah all the reasonable people left a long time ago now its just people who play survivor to fulfill their god complexes and people who play killer do fulfill their masochism.
---
yea no. Tunneling is focusing one survivor when you have the option to go for after another, mostly after unhook. 
---
If the survivor does not have BT, sure down them quickly and slug. but its still tunneling
---
My whole post went over ur head
---
Wait but this is the definition of tunnelling lmao. Going out of your way avoiding others to go for one specific person is tunnelling. People just don’t like to be labelled tunneller or camper.
---
🎵what kind of fuckery is this🎵
---
It's a rare and powerful magic called 
---
"FRIENDS ONLY MESSAGES."
---
so are you saying spirit and nurses changes are bad?
---
Tbh I didn’t read it all, I skimmed through and wasn’t read for the amount of whining.
---
I would say Ghost Face is better if we ignore addon and perks but Myers is probably better with his optimal kit.
---
I managed to stun her while she was chasing me. Twice next to the main path on the MacMillan Building, once in the trees on the path
---
Look at legion, he likes it, he’s smiling
---
Mate did u even read my post? Like.. I.. idk wha-
---
I got camped for it tho
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure someone is just mad they got called out for tunneling
---
Adepts for killers haven't been just 4ks since shortly after the Emblem System was implemented.
---
Survivor players when the killer gets the slightest advantage in a patch in an asymmetrical multiplayer game
---
I think it won't matter much at red ranks and against spirits with a lot of hours, but at lower ranks where the majority of players are I believe it's a huge difference. There are a lot of players who play with music on, or have bad headphones, or a number of other reasons for why the audio queues that a lot of us take for granted aren't as simple to use. In my mind, this change means that newer spirits won't have this fallback to accidentally find survivors.
---
this isnt that bad though, you are practically the same rank
---
Literally no one has said they have any monetary value. It's ALL emotional value. Which, again, there is nothing wrong with; and if you assert otherwise then you're just virtue signaling about people feeling emotions regarding digital content.
---
Lol
---
Billy: (chuckles) Im in danger
---
I think a part of it is that this game is more intend to put people into the shoes of the characters they play rather than equal opponents as in other online games. Because what you do in this game is so realistic, direct and brutal. You feel like survivors are laughing at you when you get looped, rather than realizing it is just the other player trying to win the game. You feel like the killer went out of his way to target you, wants to “kill” you, when he just want to win the game. Other than that, just like every other ol game, people may be having a bad day and want to let it out in games so...
---
No. Your post was too long.
---
Teabagging has been around long than video games, let alone DBD
---
I know no one is going to see this, but I’ve been sweating for this trophy for almost a month now and if this game didn’t give me a double pip then this system is complete garbage. Plague shouldn’t get punished against her Malicious Emblem because of survivors healing at her fountains. That’s her power for fucks sake, she’s getting punished for using her power.
---
Some of the codes for them were exclusive. People purposely got them and then didn’t use them but sold them for ridiculous amounts. That’s really unfair, because they took advantage of the exclusivity. They shouldn’t have been allowed to sell them in the first place.
---
You aren’t remotely responding to what their post is about
---
I got a gen one so idk, I was ghostface and made a temporary alliance with a Nancy. She let me pull her off a gen then I dropped her next to it and ran the fuck away let her get up then resumed the match
---
Unfortunately I was short on Malicious cause of cleansing survivors. For one reason or another the emblem system punishes Plague for survivors cleansing and giving her corrupt.
---
No, you get a 1% increase each prestige of a greater chance of better items
---
&gt; I’d like to play killer more but I can’t bc anxiety
---
Just do it. You will lose plenty of games. It'll make you more resilient if you accept that you're frolicking around an asymmetrical murder dungeon in the stomach of an Entity that feeds on emotions.
---
And turn off messages except from friends. No reason to have those on, as I believe you've seen.
---
I used to do races in KYF with some old friends. The killer would be trapper with addons that reduce your chances to escape from beartraps. The last person to free themselves and crawl would get a cypress mori. Fun times.

The misconception is that tunneling has variations to it that take away the "Tunneling" aspect of it. Wether it's strategic or not Tunneling is tunneling. The only defense would be "it was the only thing I could think of" as denying a tunnel after tunneling someone is just lying with no shame. It is a good strategy, But it's also hated
---
Ahhhhhhhhhh thank you so much. I was operating off incorrect understanding this entire time, thinking that it was global outside the TR in base-kit Spirit.
---
Oo counter fire i like it
---
I think survivors bitch too much,  maybe a few add ons could have been tweaked, but making her a wraith clone was dumb.  Now every survivor can run the same build and react the same way to all but 1 killers.  Vault pallet loop repeat.
---
Did anyone think it was weird when the first teaser for spirit was a woman crying before getting executed? It always seemed strange to me that they would introduce a killer that way, considering it was the dad slicing people up. And I remember being initially disappointed when it wasnt the dark male voice we heard in that trailer. 
---
The whole rin's dad thing has always felt like a big loose end.
---
* Play killer you like to earn bloodpoints
---
* Level killers you want teachables for
---
* Repeat.
---
It's really not that bad. Takes just over a million (about 1.1m) to get a character from 1-40, which unlocks every teachable. Buy the ones you want, leave the character alone (you may want to try them later on and it's nice to have a stack of good offerings and add ons), and then level your main (or prestige) to unlock the new teachables you want. 
---
Also play some survivor. You can get mad BP out of their challenges in the Tome and then dump it into the killer(s) you are leveling.
---
Full killer perks: Ruin, Thanatophobia, Dying light, BBQ
---
I find it awesome that these characters in game are so close, but we are so far apart - in our rooms, behind screens, but in game, we feel connected. Wholesome.
---
Just leave the match and find a more entertaining killer. Thats the counter. No point in playing a match against a killer that is actively trying to make your life miserable. 
---
Just like hostage doc or old legion with broken blades.
---
You have to buy them 6 times, that’s not a big deal. It’s genuinely the least of worries. Especially with the new bloodweb system, before that’d take 6 levels which could be 300k at lvl 50, now it’s only half
---
R u the asshole that commented second account?
---
Santa is okay I don’t personally like how his eyes are just black no explanation for it my bad when I say entertainer I did mean child’s play my bad knives are cool the hallowed blight is a good skin for clown loves it the most
---
Of course people will complain she’s a killer. 
---
 
---
Half jokes aside according to some the devs didn’t nerf what people found unfun in a chase against spirit
---
#GROOVY
---
I think the key is balanced. Its spawn rates in chests are extremely low unless you run plunderers and it is on the more expensive end in the bloodweb. The only time i see it as broken would be in a swf situation where the survivors would have a general idea on what theyre going to do.
---
Why do you and so many other people on here constantly complain about the rift? "It takes so long" are you seriously expecting to complete it as soon as it drops? I dont get it. It's not like we have 1 week to do the entire thing. We have more than 2 months to finish it all and people still complain. Makes no sense to me. How about take your time with it. It takes ages to level the rift in the first place so why does it matter that it takes a few games to complete some challenges?
---
Flair does not check out &gt;_&gt;
---
It makes sense. You have a better chance of "living forever" if I can heal you quickly
---
&gt;Unfortunately I was short on Malicious cause of cleansing survivors. For one reason or another the emblem system punishes Plague for survivors cleansing and giving her corrupt.
---
Just pretend you are a Wraith and M1 nonstop.
---
oh, i read it wrong. yea im just dumb
---
DANNY(Jed(Ghostface)Olsen)JOHNSON*
---
No. I'm the asshole that only has one account.
---
If anything, they should adjust how the reveal mechanic works
---
Thank you for replying normally and actually giving this a read. Ur the type of ppl I appreciate in this game.
---
It genuinely feels like getting a participation award, like a 35 year old soccer mom lifting you onto the 7th place podium and saying "it's okay sweety, maybe next season you'll get one of the big bou trophies!"
---
Yeah this is a super sweaty build.
---
&gt; I'm doing the challenges to make the game more fun.
---
Self-caring 2 times is more fun? Equipping a perk you never use (noed) is more fun?
---
are you really comparing spirit to wraith... after minor changes... did you even read this post
---
The only problem with that is then getting her Deviousness up which is an incredible pain with plague as her scoring events are incredibly minor.
---
It’s not that I get anxiety about losing, I’d be the killer that gives the last person hatch. I get anxiety when gens pop or when I can’t find someone in along time.
---
Are you fucking kidding me? I spend som much time grinding those cosmetics. I did unfung challenges to get them. I play your game since 2016, but this is too much. You betrayed your early supporters. Who was tortuted as killer main in 2016? I am going to uninstal your stupid game. Players lost legacy skins without refund. They spend so much energy to get something exclusive. Now it is all wasted.
---
Actually, since they killed my Nurse, i am yet to change it but haven't figure out how to do it yet. :D
---
Clown has some of the best killer cosmetics, I would say all of Trappers suck except for his Miner costume.
---
Honestly it doesn't matter how you get it. I did it within the first minute so it didn't ruin the match for everyone but if you want it legit then by all means go for it man
---
Wait...so is griefing getting the killer away from someone?
---
Some people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.
---
I saw this while waiting in the lobby for my Shape daily.
---
I laughed. I didn’t take it seriously.
---
God damn Fractured Cowshed.
---
Maybe you should avoid cringeworthy meme names while trying to make a legitimate argument, for starters.
---
Playing killer will help with that. It's a lot like the first time I tanked in MMORPGs - it's terrifying, but it fades quickly with practice. There'll come a time when you don't even remember what it was like to be nervous about it.
---
&gt; when I can’t find someone in along time.
---
Doctor is _fantastic_ for this. Everybody screaming and screaming and screaming. You'll lose your fear of the immersed pretty quickly, and in the meanwhile you'll learn where those folks typically hang out.
---
I didn’t, I’m not on PC. I literally never had the chance to get any of these. And yeah I know why they are doing it, doesn’t make me feel less bad for them. Sorry for having sympathy.
---
It is overly ridiculous to spend that on a digital item. It's not even something you can tangibly hold.
---
*been playing for a couple months*
---
Feels good man.
---
Nerfed is a strong word, technically it was a nerf, but was it really? it was a change. they are still top tiers
---
Laughs in trapper main!
---
They said the items would be added to the shop later for auric cells. It’ll be cheaper to do the rift now than it will be to buy them later
---
You need to be on the other side AND 2 -3 steps away
---
Whoa partner you got a problem with seaside psycho? Cause if it’s a whoopin your a-wanting
---
No
---
You can apply good gen pressure and still not have many hooks.
---
Survivor: unhooks teammate in your face
---
Killer: knocks the person back down
---
Survivors in post game chat: omg you tunneling camper you only won cuz you slugged
---
You are not wrong and they’re still good killer mains are overreacting
---
It only goes off when you go in the exit gate with an active trap. Hatch doesn’t set off the trap, even if it’s active.
---
Holy shit who the fuck would spend something like that on a cosmetic. Woooowwwww
---
He says I pallet blocked him, which is stupid since every time I dropped a pallet, I had hag chasing me.
---
At least you can't kill three of those in the first 30 seconds.
---
You can have sympathy but there's literally no reason to feel bad for someone who willing spent too much of their own money for cosmetics and not even really good ones at that. Aren't some of them literally reskins of free ones or am mistaken
---
Thank you for the awesome tips, I’m gonna try to play some killer now, I just hope I’m not too hard on myself sometimes. &amp; thanks for actually reading my post haha.
---
If thinking/doing this makes me a clown then im happy to be one
---
Fortnite bad dbd good
---
100 points off from a perfect game and no adept??!!! Why are killer adepts so broken compared to the survivors?
---
* I know at the end of this I'm gonna see Entity displeased****
---
I still go after the guy who unhooked. 
---
Even if I hit them while attacking and they go down, I leave them on the floor and chase the other one. Usually they get revived. 
---
But it's not tunneling to later recognize the hooked person and attack them instead of the guy who I haven't seen before.
---
Be free my slugs
---
I play for the killers, anytime a new killer releases I'm hyped, and it's so well spaced in my opinion, I just don't stop playing. Yeah I'll take my two week breaks or something, but I always keep myself updated. Some powers are just really satisfying to use in my opinion
---
What's really bad is encouraging even more DCs and purposeful deaths. Just because your gens take a few extra seconds longer is not a good enough reason to ruin the game for your team mates or the killer. With how fast gens can go with even a semi decent team, i really think you should try to get over the pouting of "my objective is slightly longer so ima quit". 
---
No ones forcing you to play this game, the least you can do is not ruin it for the people who do, despite how subjectively "boring" you consider it to be.
---
I play killer like 80% so when I se allies T-Bag I body block them so the killer can hit them.
---
If they were to add a fake passive phasing go through windows animation, I'd be all for it.  But right now it just takes away one of spirit's tools while looping.
---
You really went above and beyond for that hit.
---
As a proud owner of Hound Mask, I was a little upset as well but BHVR gave a reason to why they are doing it: 
---
&gt;#WHY UNLOCK THE EVENT COSMETICS? 
---
&gt;Unfortunately the way these event cosmetics were stored made it possible for certain players to lose them at random. They would need to be returned manually, but doing so ran the risk of causing further loss of progress.
---
I recently lost my event cosmetics (which they gave it back) so at least they have a reason for it. Unless they manage to prevent progress loss altogether (which I don't think they can), this is the right move. 
---
Not only as a owner of Hound Mask but I also loved when I encountered one in game when playing as survivor, it automatically meant that player was a veteran-ish. Now it will mean nothing.
---
Legacy also does that but a lot of people hacked them so is not the same.
---
Not exactly. The number 13 has always had its place in superstition. If I’m correct, it has to do with Judas, being one of the 13 apostles (he was replaced after his suicide, so it went from 12 to 13), betrayed Jesus. Therefore, the number 13 is unlucky.
---
If you’re confused, know that I am too. That reasoning for the number 13 being “unlucky” makes no sense.
---
The challenge. It is an easy game to learn but difficult to master.
---
You're right, seaside psycho is pretty dope I just forgot about it, we need a beach level to go with it though.
---
Im so disappointed that in the japanese version of for honor she dosnet say that.
---
"A few extra seconds". 
---
kek
---
Holy fuck actually?
---
I yearn for him to call me a cunt and/or cutie again. What a great guy.
---
I’ll be honest I really want a deep sea diver killer or an updated seaside psycho with a full divers outfit like captain cutlers ghost
---
Slugging is just downing them, right?
---
Yeah, it’s optimal to slug if there is only two survs left
---
Survivors just like to be salty. Even to their own kind
---
***M E G A N ! ! !***
---
You done?
---
If there's one thing the developers really excel at, it's making interesting original horror themed characters that could genuinely be the star of a quality film.
---
Golden Feng is. And that was one of the most expensive ones. Personally didn’t see the appeal but. The only difference was the emblem on the back of the shirt.
---
I play both sides and agree with you. Tunneling is going after someone right after they're unhooked, not 5 minutes later when you come across them again. If they get farmed by a teammate that isn't tunneling either, that's their teammates fault
---
Yes, I also have the Hound mask! I also got the Donkey David jacket from the same event :). I always felt very special about the Hound mask specifically because a lot less people play killer, so it was even more special. 
---
&gt; when I encountered one in game when playing as survivor, it automatically meant that player was a veteran-ish. 
---
I didn't mention this in my original post, but very true. I always had a small head nod of respect and a warm fuzzy feeling when I noticed stuff like this.  
---
I suppose that reason you pointed out makes me a bit more okay with this, but it doesn't entirely take the sadness away. It's good that you got your cosmetics back (though even if you didn't, I guess you would get them now lol.)!
---
Then see. Why spend a hundred or more for a different colored emblem?
---
Adam's uncle
---
Holy shit that was close
---
Ive had so many dc's in survivor and killer today, so annoying
---
That's her kit, taking away every mind game tool she has would ruin her.  You're basically asking for another pre-change freddy or post-change legion.  
---
And the problem with them is that you never feel satisfied winning against them.  If anything you feel bad for them.
---
It's important for killers to feel fair, but remain powerful.  I as a spirit main agree with most of the changes, but nerfing into the ground is not the goal.
---
&gt;Then learn to hit greats. Its been meta long enough you should know how to deal with it. And it is seconds, its not adding minutes dude. It only takes 70-80 seconds and adding a 20% long debuff to it is,literally seconds. Youre just being a baby, crying about one specific build on one specific killer you dont like.
---
zZzZzZzZzZzZZ
---
^Freddy ^inspired ^reply.
---
Happens sometimes was he able to heal? Those bugs usually go hand in hand
---
There's the thought of having alternate victory conditions, which as of now we only have the trap door. Imagine an offering which after destroying 5 totems you can go to the basement and start a ritual. On completion of the ritual a portal opens up and you can escape.  
---
The idea is to have the option to go for a different primary objective. Secondary objectives are very situational with their appeal. But there are good ones like reverse beartraps. Do you really want to be doing gens when you have one?  
---
Another alternate possible primary objective would be when you are the last survivor, if you can sneak up behind the killer you kill them. It might require finding and opening a chest to grab a knife first or taking a perk or something.
---
Nah, I healed em and he couldn’t move, he was stuck in the healing state
---
I've tried playing games without Ruin and it shortens the game a bit in favor of the survivors. Maybe running corrupt intervention can be a way as to get off the ruin teet. BBQ though for those points!
---
Yes but every time I do that some random Claudette emerges to yoink it when I decide to come back.
---
i saw jakes studded jaket is being released. im on console and i think we already have it? or does he have multiple leather ones?
---
I actually thought I was om r/Sekiro
---
I dunno why the fuck you people expect me to play against new killers like they're infants chasing me in a game of tag. They're not my little fucking cousin, I'm going to loop them correctly and drop pallets on their ass. If you whiny ass babies want to complain about me being an asshole you're a little to soft to be playing a skill based game.
---
I've tried using them together, but don't know how to take advantage of it.  And I've never seen any streamers use those add on.  
---
Can you give me some advice?
---
Its just funny how you claimed I had no point to my arguement but you're the one resorting to childish comments. Have fun and happy cake day.
---
I've seen these listed for like 900$.
---
Sorry for your loss @ you playing all three.
---
Patr raeb esrever
---
Yea I feel that! For me personally? I just enjoy playing Killers that seem the most fun! Clown and Legion are definitely some of my favorites. As for survivors I've started to take a real liking to Jeff and Ace!
---
So a situational perk to counter a situational perk?
---
I highly doubt anyone would run it unless they're doing an item hunt or they just want to keep the med kit that they even used an offering to keep it.
---
I know there's other perks, but frankly i don't mind them. Hell I'm more accepting of noed then Franklin's because it's always run when I bring an item, it's always run when I go searching for items, honestly i just want some security for my sole med kit. Like please
---
It's just Steam PC with Microsoft Store PC crossplay for now.
---
Let's not pretend that the devs only cater to survivors, shall we? Killers complained about Decisive Strike and it got reworked, they complained about MoM and it was nerfed to the point you actively need to throw the game just to potentially get it to proc, they complained about original exhaustion mechanics and Sprint Burst and they were changed, etc.
---
Were these things rightfully broken and deserving of a nerf? Yeah, but so were Spirit and Nurse, and don't pretend otherwise. There are bullshit things on both sides, and only looking at the opposite side and complaining about theirs is hypocritical.
---
sad days man
---
/r/agedlikemilk , few hours off
---
What a sad cunt
---
See I say perk because then you still have to use up a perk slot just to counter a perk that may or may not be in play.
---
It would make my item hunts and whenever I decide to bring an item less frustrating.
---
How about ghostface? Kind of easy to sneak up to somebody on a generator with him and grab them.
---
Just the first time or can the action be repeated?
---
As a trapper main my ass is loving it
---
Haha it was my friend was asking me what was going in the basement and I had to take a while to explain it.  
---
I let him attack me and hook me but he let me go so I just started trading a yellow flashlight for one of his chest in the basement.He was going from one side to the other.
---
I love legion, that's my main. Post Nerf legion is hella fun to play as!
---
It wasn't necessarily the strongest, it was just the most miserable to go against. Only thing you could do to avoid being grabbed was run Spine Chill and be paranoid as fuck for the whole match.
---
removing collison, changing her most broken addon and giving her a vault animation sure is
---
Never run into Franklins but I’m definitely doing that lmaoo. Also I never understood why it’s even possible for killers to see what items a survivor brings in. Doesn’t seem very fair, especially when killers have items too but survivors are left to guess what they are or if they have any.
---
"What do you mean Frank only got a safety pip? This is outrageous!"
---
u/poopooeleven coming in with the big brain comment: ''What a sad cunt''! I gotta go with the classic response for this one..
---
no u
---
Thats not what they mean, but go off.
---
Not needed.
---
Playing killer for the challenge and Survivor for the team work. I never get mad when I lose at Survivor but man I have trouble not getting pissed when I get run around for 5 minutes buy 4-man swf and barely get two hooks.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dwme0r/has_anyone_posted_a_video_or_screenshot_of_what/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It may not be needed, but i frankly really want it
---
Mettle, instaheals and DS are all dead from what they used to be, so no argument there
---
Plunderers sorta counters now letting you see dropped items
---
&gt;Nobody knows the answer because they haven't released any info yet. It was merely a question on the survey they just put out.
---
They literally gave all the answers when DBD launched on Microsoft Store. They posted on twitter and discord the link leading to a Q&amp;A on forum.
---
Damn this would be so fun as some sort of April Fool’s update or something lol
---
They said it so many times... it’s between pc anc pc (steam and windows store)
---
It is. As well as the con exclusive stuff they’re giving away lunar new year and summer bbq cosmetics.
---
And it's literally because of BHVR's shitty coding again. Wonderful.
---
Isn’t that available in a pack? There is an Ohmwrecker cosmetic I unlocked via one of the cosmetic packs.
---
I got this achievement today. corrupt purge does not count towards chase. in fact I wouldn't even use vile purge to prevent them from healing with the fountain or the possibility theyll be broken all game and take from your chaser medal. I would reccomend slugging the 3rd survivor and finding the 4th survivor then going back to the one you slugged and hook them both. corrupt intervention is good to help with gatekeeper and you can use infectious for quick chases or to know where to go next. I would just use her as an m1 killer and maybe use the vomit to discourage them from touching gens. her and trapper were my last 2 and I got them both today, good luck on finishing your adepts, it's quite an achievement
---
one. "Mindgames" at vaults.
---
Two. phase speed makes things more fair, collision was cheep and took literally 0 effort for a free injured state, her addons where broken. 
---
If you think about it, almost no killer in the game is unique. almost Every killer they have released is just an easier version of top tier killers or just a combo of two or three.
---
Demo is Hag/pig, Spirit is babys first nurse, clown is babys first huntress, GF is pig/myers, ect. 
---
Even though i agree she isnt original since she is basicly just another teleportation killer, she is not like wraith at all.
---
being a spirit main (at least when I play killer) I think all they need to do is make it more obvious when she's phasing
---
Honestly, I just use it to spook survivors. I do a lot of jumping around corners and walls in ways they wouldn't expect as well as getting extra close during chases. I love to see them panic as they try to figure out what I'm gonna do next - the passive phasing just amps up the chaos by 10x.
---
Well that yeah. I figured he was asking because of all the talk recently due to the question on the survey.
---
Killer hooks weren’t highlighted when someone was hooked
---
Exhaustion would cool down while running
---
Brand new part did an insta-repair
---
Three kinds of map offerings
---
Hooks didn’t turn when pulling someone off
---
Multiple moon offerings
---
You could teleport when throwing down pallets 
---
Borrowed time saved you and them, 1x use
---
Wraith had like 6 bingbongs and started the match uncloaked
---
Urban evasion was slowww as fuck
---
Perks were displayed as 4 in a row
---
Brown med-kits didn’t even heal fully
---
Pallets would float away when broken
---
Pallets everywhere 
---
Daily rituals that wouldn’t load
---
Daily rituals that awarded shit points
---
Tinkerer would affect other perks
---
Great for healing yourself once, maybe twice.
---
Figured he was asking because of all the talk recently due to the question on the survey.
---
It starts off with that loud ass generator explosion then they all scatter.
---
As long as I'm properly credited give'er! Its a fun one, we tried it tonight and got bingos round one. Hahahaha
---
Yeah of course you can. Survivors bitch too much anyways.
---
How many times are you being forced to heal in a match?
---
Ill usually smack the unhooked guy if hes right infront of me and then chase the rescuer so either he has to be picked up by a third survivor or go mend. Just to keep as many people off gens as possible.
---
Who ever said that? So you'd rather a game (that's financially struggling and losing players) have exclusivity on items that have long since been owned by players that have gotten plenty of time with them not put them up in a shelf while not taking them away from the people that previously had them? And I'm being called entitled! ((Not that I really care about random people's opinions mind you))
---
Hey hey! Glad to see you guys appreciate them. Nothing wrong with the other killers! I just find those two more my style. Ace is a great survivor though!
---
Billy is the definition of balance. Everything above him is OP, everything below him is UP.
---
Welcome to forever Freddy. I can only imagine someone keeping Freddy busy while the rest of the group does a gen together as being spread out will just lead to a slow game that Freddy wants. Bonus points for the looper being the obsession and getting tunneled since (sadly) their death will take away Dying Light. Just got to make sure everyone is healthy and awake, too.
---
and do killers do anything different? All you do is chase, hit, down, hook.
---
Congrats, you found out how new DLC works. you cant play against the ***MORE THEN 5 TOP TIERS*** the same way you do with the rest of the killers. 
---
Spirit was busted, they changed her slightly to allow survivors to have a more interactive experience.
---
The channeling ability on top of portals should stay as is though, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve found survivors I otherwise wouldn’t have by flexing on my interdimensional buttholes.
---
Ain't that the truth huh? It's fun to learn new things and techniques in the game that you didn't know about! Or silly/fun builds that spice things up. Truth be told of course I follow the meta for the most part...Always a bit too afraid to stray away in fear of being gen rushed right off the bat so. Idk. BUT! I agree with ya pal! Always fun to learn and become better! :D
---
I approve of them making these things available for all players, but I dunno, they should probably just be put in the shop as purchasable.
---
Not that I mind getting them for free, of course. It just seems like putting them in the store would make them a bit rarer and make BHVR more money.
---
And you want to make a change by posting a reddit thread. Sorry, it doesn’t work like that
---
Nobody does that cunt
---
You're just incapable of seeing the game designed in a way that doesn't promote toxic game play. Maybe if you understood that you'd be capable of understanding what game play criticism is.
---
Currently you automatically think I don't recognize that there is some behavior survivors have that is problematic. You assumed that and asserted that. Your bias shows, and it's gross. I simply stated that the devs try to patch game play issues with perks, which is de facto true.
---
So when are they gonna address the matchmaking queue issue? Do they even recognise that as an issue? It takes ages but they don’t care?
---
They should just remove ruin and increase the gen time to compensate. Looking for ruin, especially on some maps is ass you shouldn't have to memorize every totem on every map for a fairly common mechanic, unless it's a relatively lower impact perk that maybe it will snowball if you don't look for it like Huntress Lullaby or Devour Hope. And it just limits what killers can choose for perks. But gens go so fast without it, it becomes mandatory, so why not just make gens slower
---
Yeah it’s pretty bad and people are praising it.
---
Maybe but I feel like people wouldn't like an offering countering their build and the survivor still runs all the meta perks.
---
This way the survivor still has to give up something much like how the killer would need to give up a perk slot aswell. A slot for a slot
---
The pallet stunned Ghostface, causing him to drop Bill.
---
Imagine being a troll, but go off.
---
Uhhh... Where have you been?
---
I've been both in twitter and here and I have not seen many survivors complaining or wanting more
---
Actually the complete opposite, everyone seems pretty satisfied with it
---
Ok boomer
---
I don’t like it how spirit is in the corner and has other killers above and to the left of her.
---
You can only win this one if she has ruin, hits you with noed, facecamps you and dcs when you get unhooked
---
I'm glad you were able to get them but I'd rather the game have another selling point to keep the engine running rather than some people having cosmetics that nobody else can. I'm not even going to buy them, I have no interest in that; I haven't even bought any killers or survivors, I'm just speaking from a place of logic here. It's financially a good idea to offer more selling points to new possible customers; if anything I'd suggest to give a legacy trinket for veteran players to display on their survivor hip or killer hook ((if you want that proof)) 
---
I still think it's selfish to have the mine mine mine mentality for something you've had for a long time ((and aren't losing))
---
I was stalking a rank 14 Meg and when I tier 3'd she ran to a pallet, so I moon walked once, downed her and she dc'd
---
Fiddy Cent?
---
Play swf, have everyone bring a green key. Watch the killer waste a perk slot. BOOM!!!
---
I don't see how unless you play like 1 or 2 games a day. I consider myself pretty crap at survivor and get to green ranks like the first weekend after reset playing half the time as survivor.
---
Playing super immersed with toolboxes wins games but you won't double pip a lot. Is that what you're doing?
---
Hell yes
---
Tru3 is one connection, actually. he got me into both while he was still doing the culling
---
I hear it all the time when I wait 15 minutes for a lobby lol. I find it pretty funny hes mocking the games load times.
---
Reading these comments makes me want to cosplay Plague by vomiting all over the place. Such a circlejerk fest.
---
Well, you still have legacy as an exclusive outfit ;D
---
Wait, what if Rins father becomes a new skin for the killer Spirit. And a new killer, obviously the original Yamaoka, versus Rin as the survivor. Now THAT would be cool.
---
Maps go to the bottom no matter what, without add ons they suffer bad. 
---
Flashlights at least have even the smallest impact on the killer
---
Cool concept of move around some stuff because mutiple rows aren't possible due to multiple killers in the one row
---
Truth hurts ,what can I say? :(
---
People love bitching just to bitch.
---
It might also be the Red Forrest map. I’ll have green ping going in and then the second the match starts my ping jumps sky-high and I have to hide in a locker until it settles down again.
---
Why do I get the feeling you would like a giant meaty cock in your ass just through the way you present yourself in written computer text.
---
He may be a killer but he’s still a gentleman. Didn’t want to ruin your shower lmao
---
It was, the shack was a joke it the spirit abused the fact that she had no vault animation, you had to play coinflips everytime.
---
The problem wasnt us needing to hear her, it is her hearing us
---
&lt;3 Spread the love &lt;3
---
Snail race
---
That is true, they've really vowed not to make those available ever again. Sadly those are the most obviously commonly hacked ones, but eh :). And as I said, I'm not opposed to there being a chance to get an exclusive cosmetic given that there's work behind it, I'm just upset that literally everyone will have them.
---
Exactly, unless I hide the item in the corner of the map (and at that point why even bring one in) some person is either gonna take it or the killer if they got Franklin's is going to just keep smacking it back out right when I get it
---
It looks like you're playing an MMO with all the debuffs.
---
Well you can’t flick with a controller
---
Never understood why Nurse was considered a strong killer. Idk if I’ve just never come across a strong Nurse main, but mind games are so easy with her
---
On default spirit skin, her hair stands straight up when she phases, some skins, like the school girl outfit, don't have any telltale like that, just make all the cosmetics equal, and it'll be fine.
---
^Hahahahah ^iwannadie
---
The emojis added nothing to the post.
---
Plague too op in solo queues and weak against SWF. Needs a buff and a nerf to balance her
---
He says it if you wait for a long time instead of starting a match
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
Iron Will is already meta and doesn't need a buff.
---
Or both.
---
LMAO that's not a cooldown.
---
If he hits something he stuns himself - for not very long. If he misses he has a VERY small animation and can rev up his chainsaw again immediately afterwards.
---
She was nerfed, the whole point of her phase is to keep you guessing. You’re so entitled.
---
Really doesn't fix the problem but normally when I do get a couple friends on i don't run items because I'm the one usually either pumping out gens or running around pallets the entire game
---
Get your survivor main buddies to cry and bitch about it, if you do it enough BHVR will do whatever you want.
---
And you can see her shards of broken glass shine but it's very small and hard to see. They need to make it obvious.
---
Its bc she has literally nothing stopping her, survivors two resources to stop the killer are ineffective against her
---
I think they need to add a new quality special for them : very. Common.
---
Instead of saying funny he sent an emoji.
---
You all are so childish it’s crazy
---
What resources are you talking about?
---
Never payed attention to if it’s happening on sordid maps. I’ll keep an eye out for that. So far no more games like this. Even just had a friendly pig let me crawl out the hatch I was camping on while my team was too busy t bagging the exit to escape for me to open it. Games not always bad haha
---
What?!? I would have been fine if her other spots werent changed. Just a better indication of her phasing.... you mist be so used to using that word ‘entitled’ too easily.
---
Yea, but I just want something to keep the item in my hand. I don't care if it still gets the standard depletion it'd normally get on hit but something to keep others from grabbing it or me losing it forever because anytime i go near it is death.
---
Finding the item is never the issue unless it's indoor maps
---
I am 100% with you, I dont have any of those cosmetics but I feel like giving them free for All the players is too much.Maybe as a reward for getting to Rank 1 some can Be earned or through events
---
Yes the animationa are the “cooldown” those are perfectly fine as is and don’t need changing.
---
You had your time, now it’s our time.
---
LOL no. Keys are a survivor item. Mori's are next on the chopping block.
---
You already get 1000 bp when unhooking someone plus an extra 500 if you unhook safely. I don’t think babysitter giving altruism points would increase the value of the perk what so ever with this change
---
so sweet
---
I agree with you, but after getting into multiple discussions about it with several killers 
---
 I can say it's because of how this affects how many bloodpoints a killer can get for a game ending too quickly. I disagree with that idea though, if I lose that fast as a killer that's on me. 
---
What I will say though is that if you gen rush until hatch spawns, find the killer and teabag you are being toxic; I'll stay behind and give him some farm for that BS.
---
I love you
---
I love Ghost Face 😍
---
Not financially struggling or losing players. 
---
You might want to fact check what you spout. 
---
And yes, you're still entitled lol
---
me too! :D &lt;3
---
Why is it called bungo?
---
Tome 2 has way more survivor challenges anyway. I liked how Tome 1 was about 50/50
---
Ooooh, okay, thank you so much for your help!
---
I can see that, bit most of not all spirits use headphones, so they can hear you directionally and if they bring strider which a lot already do, well it won't really work. But with the collision gone you can't accurately judge if you're right on the person or not
---
Every second is valuable when playing as a killer.  Trying to mind game means making a less than optimum choice to bait a mistake from your opponent.  Every killer does this to some degree. Going backwards through a loop, then turning around and swinging.  If the mind game works, the hit lands.  However if the mind game fails the survivor may be at another loop entirely.  This is true for spirit's mind games as well.  It's just that spirit mains have gotten very good with using the options that they have available.  And she probably had just a few things that put her over the top.
---
I used to main Spirit but stopped after all the controversy about her power got so much attention. I'm wanna play her but not before the Nerf.
---
https://prnt.sc/px7za2 As i can see from the previous comments you have made on other post, you are a spirit main.
---
She isnt predictable at all now, survivors have no idea when you are phasing or where you are. they added a window vault animation which is a good change. 
---
If you honestly think pretending to vault a window when there is no visual Q is a "mindgame" and that one "mindgame" makes her top tier, then thats just sad.
---
Her addons where OP. simple as that. you shouldnt be relying on addons when you are playing the most unpredictable killer in the game.
---
 If you think the collision change was bad, then thats even worse. Nothing about running into a survivor while invisible took skill or effort, it was a free hit regardless. 
---
https://prnt.sc/px7z70 Here is another post you made, Are you actually going to give up your main bc she is harder? she is literally the same killer, she just isnt as easy as she was before (Dw though she will still be super easy.) Its sad that you proved that you only play/like spirit bc her ease of use.
---
(and before you say anything, i found one comment on a different post, THEN decided to check your history for a moment)
---
What about being slightly slower then the killer making it impossible to get cause if there is a pallet or window anywhere.
---
Def not dead
---
Yup what would work. Or what if the her hair is usually horizontal to the ground but floating as it does now but when she phases, it raises up fully. That would work
---
Pretty good
---
The prayer beads nerf sounds incredibly bad. If you’re trying to mind game a survivor at a pallet and run prayer beads they’ll instantly know you’re phasing. Hopefully they reduce it to a bronze color addon.
---
Spent about 3 hours working on this while watching people play DBD.  After all the hours I've played, I figured I should start making fan art for my favorite video game.  
---
Hope you like my rendition of her! \^-\^
---
...i would hope only good nurses could destroy like that LMAO, are you a console player? thats not an insult im just wondering since nurse is worse on there
---
Otz wants to know your location
---
Yeah thank god collision is gone.
---
You're right the new changes are insignificant for a good spirit, imo she will still be pretty good, although i kinda feel bad for the phase transition nerd in and out i liked running the broch and the white ribbon. :(
---
Could be a red herring tbh, I mean BHVR already owns the rights to wraith so they can use his image without any copyright issues. Likely just an elaborate joke
---
Cuz people only know how to loop and if that doesnt work they cry. Nurse has so much counterplay to her shes actually my favorite killer to play against but ive only played against one nurse since her nerf went live.
---
oh yea same, when legion was nerfed i got downvoted to hell when i said she was the worse killer in the game now. 
---
Oh and if you want to see people reacting like that, go ahead and check every comment on this post.
---
I love shit like this in dbd
---
He gave multiple good reasons and yet you say no reason? Billy shouldn’t have his power up 100% of the time for how crazy strong it is. 
---
That being said I’d rather have others killers buffed but even if others got buffed billy would probably still be overplayed.
---
Yeah I’m console. Ig that explains it them
---
spirit always *lacked* map pressure? sorry, but she definitely did not, her phase walk had barely any consequences for using it to travel and it is very fast. not to mention how the sound of her phasing can put survivors nearby on edge. nurse just isn’t the #1 killer anymore, people play to have fun and nurse just isn’t. though, her addon reworks and power rework did add some interesting new aspects to her
---
That offering,before the nurse update, was common so that is why you got it
---
Now it has changed rarity making it ultra rare.
---
:) I as a HUGE Bubba Sawyer Fan approve
---
Lol Trapper, Nurse, and Huntress are my favorites to play against because they’re all potato’s whenever I play against them. Idk if it’s because I’m console or what
---
Just pick the item back up. Dont worry the dude has to hit you like 7 times to fully deplete it. Or just dc and say its unfun and has no counterplay, that seems to get results.
---
This is the result of playing trapper after rank reset lol. You have no idea how much annoyance someone can get from winning until you get survivors stepping in horrible traps over and over. (See my most recent clip prior to this one for refrence)
---
Basically if you hide before they hook and wait a few seconds you never pop up on their vision
---
In general sure, camping is a bad tactic to default to. But that's not to say that camping is useless. Camping or proxy camping is *the* counter to very altruistic survivors (which is the playstyle of a lot of SWF groups). Sure they might do gens instead, but if you feel like this team is more likely to rescue than do gens, why not camp? 
---
*Especially* if you hook someone between 3 gens. If I can manage to hook someone in the middle of my patrol route (3 gens), why would I not camp? I have no reason to leave the area around the hook at all. Chasing a survivor to the other side of the map would just be falling for obvious bait.
---
Its a compliment because OP made him laugh.
---
Its on ever post but the moment someone uses an emoji it’s invalid
---
haha yea, im gonna warn you bud. Start taking notes on how to play against god nurses before cross play is added.
---
Your first time is always... dear god...
---
That means nothing to anyone, emoji or not.
---
I just got it tonight tho. Like 10 seconds before i recorded the video
---
Legion button makes me shit myself everytime
---
I remember seeing this glitch awhile back. I guess its still not fixed.
---
Oh hey razor
---
Yeah I mean
---
I run BBQ and chili and have whispers.
---
I know when they are near and I'm not gonna just pretend like I don't and leave.
---
are you implying that it was completely predictable that these exclusives would become non-exclusive, after the most the devs had previously budged on them was making look-a-likes? I mean, if you actually predicted that, I'd be impressed.
---
4 minutes is quite rich dont you mean 2 minutes?
---
Vacuum vaults
---
Donkayyy, memes are like onions, they have layers!
---
The sleeve covers half of the screen
---
Nerf all the killers and enjoy the seven year queue times. Like isnt it telling that since there are 5 people in a match you would need 20% of the player base to consistently play killer in a given region for queue times to be the same for survivor and killer. But killers have instant queues and survivors have to wait meaning less than 20% of the player base wants to play killer. But nah its cool i cant imagine why less than 20% of players wanna play 50% of the game, killer is fun and fair.
---
Tbh I just think a lot of killers have the old freddy syndrome, They're just not fun to play against, I actually thought old freddy was cooler but new freddy is better (though i wish there was a limit to blood pallets, he spawns those things everywhere)
---
The fact that the killer most known for camping is also the killer native to BBQ and Chili is so fucking stupid
---
If he was touching his other flashlight then I would had enjoy it
---
Survivor mains already crying and downvoting this post. Always to be expected when I post in here
---
No but go off.
---
BLOODWARDEN TIME
---
That sounds good too but won't work because of multiple hair skins she has. 
---
Can also go with facial expression or body gestures she has.
---
I feel like my best games I lose 3 pretty quickly but am able to lock down the remaining gens pretty well. Also it's water off my back sometimes its 0k sometimes 4k, usually 2-3k
---
It’s the plague, the killer I hate the most(would’ve much rather seen a nerf to her than spirit) her adept was pretty easy from what I remember. I’m also on the PS4 btw
---
I'm not in favor of this. This will punish players for botched last minute rescue attempts and punish killers for attempting to secure at least 1 kill during the end game collapse.
---
If I don't have borrowed time, the gates or open and it's just you and I left and you're on a hook... I go in for a rescue attempt hoping you have something like D Strike, Adrenaline or Dead Hard but you don't... and the killer decides you're tastier than I am, should I be punished for at least trying to save you? 
---
If the killer has no kills, manages to hook some and the gates are open, I don't think they should be punished for attempting to secure at least 1 kill, considering there are plenty of options for survivors to escape that situation.
---
What are you talking about?
---
See, when cross play comes out I’m just gonna use my 5th perk: DCing ;) 
---
All jokes aside I’m very excited to play against all the god-like killers from PC (not 😢)
---
Literally what I fucking said?
---
We need those two subs to do a collaboration.
---
I dont think you should trust BHVR's word when money is involved, and if this shirt never gets released to people, then those people with codes will just upsell them - its almost like BHVR didnt actually release the cosmetics to "stop scammers" or "be fair" to console, but for a different reason... darn, I wonder why they did it.. 🤔
---
There's a major difference between people you don't like, and people that tell you to kill yourself in post-game chat
---
First off, that's because legion is the worst. Even pre nerf because there was no real core balancing the devs could do to fix the way legion works. I really do hope he gets a rework...
---
I should also mention that I was sarcastic about the reaction. I wouldn't react like that unless it was completely unnecessary (which I don't think its the end of the world for spirit)
---
You mean teachables? I did Agitation challenge playing Leatherface just because I had a daily for him.
---
Yeah I'm not sure what caused it, My friend triggered a trapper trap and healed me on top of it next to a pallet. I could still vault the pallet until it got broken, yet the end timer couldn't kill me. I wasn't about to dc though, I was too busy laughing while the trapper stared at me confused as I beat the entity.
---
You’ve just been against trash nurses, people that really play nurse on console are pretty rare.
---
Just did.  It's 1.
---
That's cute, my experience after rank reset was a bunch of survivors with OoO flashlighting me every possible chance they got
---
There are people that have won tournaments to get such exclusives, including me. I'm wondering what have you and other casual players have done to deserve them?
---
Leader &gt;	 Spinechill &gt; Premonition. Even though Premonition is still a top notch beginners perk
---
Jokes on them, can't BM away my BP
---
Got it. It’s weird - I didn’t have that problem playing. But I’ve seen streamers with it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
And I’m one of those rare ones so I know what I’m talking about.
---
Hitting a survivor in any way (being m1, huntress hatchet, speed limiter billy or leatherface, or corrupt purge) all give speed boosts. But hatchet throws have a greatly reduced cooldown as too the m1 blade wipe, its not that survivors don’t get a speed boost, its that you don’t “fatigue” from the hit for as long.
---
Yeah, I finally got informed I will get my Jacket for David and Hound mask for Huntress back with the patch release.
---
No, no, no, no. Thos subreddit doesnt work like that. You need to post killer friendly posts to get upvotes you silly!
---
Yeah being blind is super easy. Forcing survivors to adapt is too cruel.  They should just be able to use their tools to counter fast killers complexly unhindered against slower kills. Im sorry if a spirit ruined you day but sure troll my history.
---
Nah friendo. Keep on doing your best and I assure you. You're gonna get better and see the results. It's a difficult game to get really good at. It ain't you...It's just a steep learning curve pal! Keep trying and you'll be fine that's a promise! \^-\^
---
We live in a society where everyone is told they are special and are given participation awards, what did we expect.
---
You monster
---
Brand New Part instantly completing a full gen in seconds.
---
People complain about 'gen rushing' now lol...
---
That's the problem with maining only one side and (while you didn't mention this) balancing for only high or low ranks. You don't see the big picture.
---
I was a pure killer main for a while but switched to survivor because the frame rate was killing me when playing console. It made me realize shit like how looping is a bitch, while it looking so easy when playing killer.
---
I used to think people who dead hard into walls were dumb, but that basically turned out to be a common theme with me. So I guess I'm the king of being a dumbass.
---
Also only balancing for high or low level of play is an awful idea. If you only balance for high ranks, the game becomes massively frustrating to new players (especially survivors.) if you only balance for low ranks of play the game will become to easy to play (again mostly for survivors.)
---
TL:DR This game has a lot of problems for all players and its extremely bad when people just ignore the other side because they don't play it.
---
BHVR posted a dev update on twitter. And yes, the studded jacket is going to be free too
---
One last thing, there is a perk called "Unrelenting". It lets you recover from missed hits more quickly, I think you would find it helpful now and later as you figure it all out you can ditch it.
---
He lacks lethality with only slow down perks, you need to not get asleep and looo him as much a possible (dropping pallets early to not get hit) and hope for the best because freedy its incredibly strong
---
Here is goes, from down temple!
---
It's GOOD!
---
Do you watch Rick and Morty while waiting for lobbies?
---
Thank you for the kind words!
---
It's not ineffective until you reach competent survivors.
---
Haha, no need to be sorry. Just a passive agressive remark by me. 
---
Just for next time :)
---
Just finished a match myself
---
My trapper was also level 1, but i started playing him for shiggles just before finding out he has challenges
---
I think the changes are fine enough
---
Is this pic for real? Or only the killer?
---
I like the idea of making Lightweight quieter your footsteps while walking/running but sound from falling, assuming you mean the yells, would make already strong balanced landing maps stronger. Quieter steps would be much appreciated though.
---
Knowing when Spirit phasing requires good game sense, and I’m assuming you have none because you’re asking for a princess pass to know spirit using her phase. Just like any gamer would say, get good.
---
tunneling is chasing someone imediatly after they get unhooked, because at high ranks if you hook everybody and don't kill someone or at leas have 2 people on dead hook you are gens are gonna fly and u will not have a chance
---
That really doesn’t justify spending $500 on a single cosmetic item....
---
It’s just a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a cosmetic item. I personally think it’s stupid but of course people can do whatever they want with their own money.
---
R/deadbydaylight is just a bunch of spirit mains circle jerking against their nerf
---
Its like hide and seek, in a way. A classic game with a decent spin on it. And these a myriad of different ways to improve.
---
Get locker timer down, hide in lockers. Exit and walk for 10s then go back in lockers.
---
Rank system probably isn’t helping the garbage queue times.
---
I’ve seen nurses destroy at rank 1-4 on console
---
I’m slightly sad that the event stuff I worked so hard for everyone is now getting lol but legacy is still exclusive for ppl so that’s cool for them
---
It was like that for me earlier. I would get three disconnects/errors for every game I tried. Took me 20 minutes to actually load in when I would find a match in 3.
---
decrease the amount of lockers by half and lower the time u can stay in a locker by half
---
All the exclusive cosmetics like “science fair Claudette” and “street Meg” are becoming available for free to everyone
---
Jesus Christ there really are people like you guys. I thought the Billy next things were just memes but holy shit.
---
Like it or not Billy is extremely balanced and what people who complain about him seem to forget is his power has three easily obtainable counters. Cutting a corner, dropping from am elevated surface, and windows. On top of that endurance tanks the saw and you can earn that status effect with a medkit add on and multiple perks. Also also of you use dead hard or other exhaustion perks the chainsaw stops and swings through the air and he has to recharge.
---
He is easily reduced to an M1 killer if you know how to loop or just got a lucky map such as the game or lerrys
---
Why did he have to dc? He could have just let EGC kill you
---
Tournaments are a good point too, I've attended a few in hopes of collectables but haven't won anything thus far. I have a tournament I'm attending tomorrow too actually, and they had gotten the codes to cosmetics for multiple top players, but now that they've announced this the codes are pretty much useless and only 2 prizes are available (bloodletting codes) :/.
---
I hope mori’s and keys both disappear. I also have more mori’s than keys. Just saying
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Ahhh yes you’re right. Forgot about that.
---
There’s a 10 limit at any given time, problem is that on some maps 10 can feel like too much but on other maps 10 is fine. I think it’s fine as is because it’s not too hard to keep track of real pallets most times.
---
holy fuck im in tears laughing at this thread. best description ever
---
Na man, ds anti tunneling its fine, but the unhook person doing gens in front of you chase you and bodyblock you is completly wrong, the 60 sec are to much, you down someone else hook them go kick a gen down someone else and they ds me and i don't ever rember hooking them, plus on endgame its just stupidly strong
---
I got killer DC before the free space (ruin)  
---
what a time to be alive
---
I can't see myself playing this mode as a killer. Sounds extremely boring
---
They’re both bullshit tbh
---
If I didn't get enough BP from a tunneling Myers with this, I'll DC.
---
queue times be like
---
These skins are different colours of  previous released skins. These colours are unlikely to be available again as its suppose to encourage u to playing the season. Is it worth it? Depends if u like skins. The freebies are probably not worth it and premium is only worth it if you play a lot. I'm playing free and if I max free I'll convert to premium. That way my game time dictates if i buy the extra pass or not.
---
Survivor mains wil complain aboit anything
---
What counterplay does spirit have?
---
Removed we ask you take part in this sub first before advertising thank you
---
Isnt it crazy how people have more then one sense? you can actually hear things! with your ears!. you are not blind, you have so much info just given to you with a bow and a kiss on the forehead. You can see scratch marks, and blood with an addon, thats FAR from blind.
---
Adapting is when you stop hugging walls against a curving billy, or when you hop into a locker to counter the PGTW freddy with BBQ.
---
Adapting is not, Run iron will, or die.
---
Tell me about it. I was in queue for like 15 minutes one time and after restarting the game I got in a match 5 minutes later 🤦‍♂️
---
The only nurse I’ve seen destroy at those ranks is me. Even with the nerf but dam I can only play about 4 to maybe 5 games before I just can’t take it anymore
---
Yeah, I’ve been doing that since the tunnel/slug meta started
---
No it’s not, tunnelling is going after a specific person when others are at an easier position for you. Doesn’t have to be off hook, if there are 2 injured people and one you know is death hook and you go after them when they’re at a infinite rather than one that runs to a dead zone for example.
---
Hard F.
---
Slug races are my absolute faves to participate in
---
I'm trying to give someone a key for the hatch. And for the love of god... would. you. stop. running!?  I'm trying to be charitable.
---
I’ve disliked billy for a long time don’t put me on that bandwagon. 
---
My problem with him is most billys chainsaw away after hooking and then when you get unhooked they come right back immediately. Unless you have sprint burst you can’t really do shit on some maps to counter that. 
---
Dead hard wouldn’t work, why would a billy try to chainsaw an injured person? His “recharge” is much shorter than bubbas.
---
Yes he can easily be reduced to an m1 killer as long as you’re not caught in the open, but he still gets into chases faster than anyone else can, doesn’t matter if he gets the 1 shot or not, he’s still just better at applying presser than most the killer roster.
---
Why would I play demogorgon when I can play billy? I can cross the map just the same and the demogorgon lunge is just straight up worse than the chainsaw in every way but the charge time. Demogorgons cross map potential also needs a set up and can also be counter by being cleaned.
---
Why would I play Myers and have a god awful early game and have to set up my 1 hit that only last a minute when I could just play billy and immediately have map pressure and 1 hit potential?
---
Why would I play bubba when I could play billy? Bubba is also worse in every way with the only upside being that he can down 2 at once which never happens.
---
Getting a inside map or bringing bringing an endurance medkid aren’t valid arguments either conserving you have no idea what killer you’re about to match against.
---
You know you could be less condensing when having a discussion right? It’s not like the first guy that commented was just like “billy bad nerf now” like most the idiots on here. Before you assume shit too I’ll just say I play both sides red ranks.
---
I am having the same problem, I've watched multiple people just run through them like they don't exist, it's lost me a few games :(
---
I see nothing here... business as usual, yes?
---
Go survivor and use we are gonna live forever... you wont get as much BP but still a decent anount and it will be less boring!
---
I seem to be behind, is Ghostface getting nerfed?
---
in defense, his skill has got me out of a few bs jam like surviors just hook swarming to try and win. He also has some of the best perks in the game tbh.
---
The think the pig's traps can be fixed a little to fir better with some thing.
---
I would just let Demorgorgon go to the upside down and let him see survivor or red line while walking thou it..But,then again I like old pre rework freddy
---
So,I am..well,me
---
Don’t worry GF will be getting nerfed too.
---
Shelter Woods? Isnt that the biggest map in the game?
---
MAD LAD
---
Well thanks for the input! I went with a stylized version of her mask for sure. Her normal one is absolutely unnerving but also very pretty. Thanks for the compliment :)
---
Brutus as killer with a perk that locks gens for some time after he kicks them, with a perk that spawns a zombie or something to shamble towards players
---
Richtofen with perks that increase the speed he drops pallets, opens chests, and does other interactions (speedcola), one that stuns the killer if dropping down from a height near them (PHD flopper), and one that gives you one extra hit at the very start of the match that is lost once hit for the first time (Juggernog)
---
Calm spirit actually doesnt show a notification. It seems to work the other way around. The scream still plays but there is no notification.
---
Keys are such stupid items.
---
Cornfield but you can still stalk through props due to rendering issues.
---
This gave me depression
---
Now she’ll probably get nerfed a second time
---
I’m having the same issue as you. I wanna P3 my Kate but playing killer can be boring for me. I just end up messing around and farming with survivors. It might be more boring for you but the survivors being all happy in the end game chat cause we farmed is a nice feeling lol
---
I am a Clown and couldn't care less.
---
To counter spirit, you go on the forums and complain until they nerf her.
---
Usually if I get bored of normal play, I'll look up some fun perk/addon builds online, but usually those require having perks from multiple killers. Other than that, maybe do games where you use only your powers to kill? (Only swing after phase on spirit, chainsaw only, traps only, etc.)
---
What is fun or unfun is really subjective tho. many people I've seen complain because they cannot loop like any other m1 killer, which is dumb.
---
I found her fun, especially playing against since is way more satisfying when I outplay her than just running in circles and drop a pallet
---
If she gets nerfed again because people cannot adapt (sounds familiar?) It's their fault. I adapted, I play her so I know how to counter her as well, and many other people do it too against me
---
Play the other killers, even of you dont get double points it breaks up the monotony
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dwnauj/scarred_hand_isnt_working_as_intended_on_hag/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I'm looking at unreleased Brazilian Feng Ming shorts.
---
Or just go to the next jungle gym? If you stayed there was your own fault
---
Yes, but you still get a guaranteed hit on a Survivor at least. It lessens the amount of time to chase them.
---
You should make an edit of this with a song in the background
---
If only Dead 'ard.
---
This mad lad  is the Symbol of peace we need
---
It's nice to be able to connect with other killers.
---
The reason to chose the other killers is for fun. Of you argue like that it sounds like you care more about winning then having a good te playing. The dead hard things an example of something that works it's not something you'll get to use often of at all to dodge a saw. I honestly don't know what to tell your.redranls bit if you're having thisich trouble with a Billy them sheesh he's balanced as he doesn't need tweaks he already has a lot of counter play what else could you want. Also I'm a red rank on both sides top it's nothing special to be there the ranks are meaningless
---
Yeah i tried to 3 gen but the gens were so far away that I made a mistake and would say lost the game there but noed came in and got a 4k
---
Yes dbd enough nerfs. Buff the trapper
---
Best dev in my opinion
---
As long as they change the blood web back to the original state and removes all generous bp offerings I'm ok with that, otherwise no.
---
Yeah that's kinda the point. Prayer bead were over powered and unfun to go against. This is a good change for them
---
Lol was chatting with OG ghostface after the match and I told him. Cute gown. Lol
---
Run Prove Thyself, Botany, Empathy, Detective's/ Small Game. Stay with a teammate, keep each other awake, try keeping everyone healed, find the totem
---
good idea! my brain just automatically dismissed we're gonna live forever for some reason
---
I find farming with survivors just ends up being even *more* boring than actually playing killer, and not everybody is up to it
---
These changes literally do next to nothing but nerf her best add-ons. They didn't even address the real concerns
---
It was literally impossible for people on consoles to get them this is fair
---
is it not possible to have that many?
---
No, it shows that you're a dedicated fan to the game...those cosmetics are years old, and they were a fucking grind and a half to get. No average fan would have them all...
---
The problem with the powers only games is that they overlap with my need to make the most points out of the match. If I do that, I'll have played a full-length killer game *and* not gotten as many bloodpoints as I could have.
---
and it was possible for anyone to get the event cosmetics if they put work in it
---
Perhaps. All I know is my game crashed after a killer DC'ed from a match and when I relaunched, my David was wearing the default jacket. Sure enough, my jacket was gone :/
---
That's what his period pools are for and some Freddys use gen teleports/fake outs in chase.
---
The events weren't on consoles they were before the console games came out
---
Won't it overwrite phasing not happening in the terror radius in the prayer beads update? It mentioned it happening map wide. Bone clapper on wraith is heard map wide
---
Even if it does break the monotony, most of my other killers are on level 1, so I'll be playing near perkless and addonless against purple rank survivors, I'll get destroyed and not even make any points to show for it
---
Honestly lmao, it makes no sense. 
---
Exclusives exist in almost every single popular multiplayer game atm. They're proof that players have worked through something or been apart of the game for an extended time or supported the game during a certain stage.  
---
Why the hell would that just be given away as freebies? It's not like they don't release constant nice cosmetics anyway that aren't worth a buy.
---
It almost tarnishes the differentiation of players and the game as a whole.
---
Imagine if games like Overwatch just mass released Noir Widowmaker or League of Legend's "Silver Kayle".
---
Some things are just meant to be inclusive for EVERYONE. You want to look nice in this game? There's literally a shop LOADED with cosmetics for you to purchase.
---
This change is wack imho, and the only players that are excited about it are the ones who grasp freebies at any opportunity. You want free things? Go to your local mall and collect samples ffs.
---
And that's wrong- you can literally view steam achievements that show when you prestiged- if it was before the date
---
The only issue I have is the reveal mechanic but other than that I don’t think he’s broken at all.  I enjoy going against GF it’s just I hate facing like 5 in a row.
---
Ive had loads of people whod take a hit for me when i got off the hook and instead of chasing that guy whos closer he decided to go for the hooked guy.That is tunneling
---
Go fuck yourself indeed. I don't even play Billy you can tell by my flair but, I don't want him touched. Idc if he's overused because he's good let him be good. He's the only one of the top three everyone sees (him, nurse, and spirit) that at least imo isn't hard to play and that's a good thing high skill ceilings are a turn off for a lot of people myself included. With billies strength comes a lot of weakness as well and I already went over the counters. If you actually have such a bad time against someone as balanced as Billy then you frankly just need to get better at dealing with him. Unless it's an insta saw Billy on sheltered woods I don't think there's any way he can be OP. If the really good killers keep getting nerfed we will most likely see less killers in general y'know there were already posts about people leaving if Billy is touched.
---
Why is there “spirit” in the last one?
---
People bitched and moaned about infinites being removed. Took out the one glitch spot where you could get on top of the map where the killer could not possibly get to you, and there were riots in the street. Sprint Burst got put on exhaustion, and I was told I deserved some very graphic things that I can't repeat because I said it was for the best. Trust me, it's not just killers who pitch a fit when they get the hit with the nerf stick. Haven't been there in a while, so there is a slim chance it's changed, but the Steam forum used to be a pit of absolute despair for both sides.
---
Depends on how many teatchables you have unlocked
---
Damn that's tough
---
Billy is the model killer, clown is annoying but doesnt need nerfs other then the change of Exhaust addons, Freddy is just annoying, plague is just annoying, legion is also just annoying.
---
People confuse annoying for good, ignore them. Its not even close to being a loud minority
---
COME HERE FENG!!!
---
I’m sorry but if you paid hundreds of dollars for golden feng that’s not on me that you’re dumb. also isn’t using codes to unlock cosmetics you didn’t earn also really shitty anyway? I’m not exactly gonna care that they got scammed
---
Deal with it
---
Just imagine if this game had VOIP.
---
Killer: Line up ya cunts, ready, set, GO!
---
I mean I heard why they wanna not do exclusives anymore was to prevent people from getting scammed and what not though spending 500 on a cosmetic is ridiculous in the first place but whatever, so I can see why they are doing it but I’ll agree it does kinda suck for those who had them.
---
Many people lost them and they couldn't track who really had them or not. Plus a new market to sell these cosmetics came up
---
I don't really care about them but that's really a good move to get rid of these flaws. Still, would try to give to whom actually earned it something, I don't know if they can really tell since they had issues with this stuff before. Anyway, many of these are just recolors so.. idk
---
Steve's arm doesn't change position when holding a flashlight or a key so you can just equip/unequip the items fast while his idle animation plays.
---
With all your complaining I'm gonna keep assuming you just can't beat a Billy and get a little too tilted everytime you hear his saw. I literally don't know what to tell you besides he is the model killer and lots of other think that too I  shouldn't have to explain how simple he is for all parties involved. I cannot understand you people thinking he needs any tweaks.
---
Wait what? It surely wasn't always like this
---
I try not to.
---
Its just annoying, you cant really see anything and he can just spam bottles constantly.
---
He isnt very good but i honestly think most of the lower tier killers are made to be annoying.
---
Also it doesnt help that every clown i run into as a red rank survivor is just the worst. i never run into clowns that are enjoyable people to play against
---
oMg U uSe SpIrIt? Ur So BaD!! /s
---
Just a copy of Sir Rodion’s video 
---
https://youtu.be/k-Tm0h0Wxfs
---
that's what happens when every viable killer gets nerfed. The other killers are just inconsistent against swf so you are forced to go with the only viable ones.
---
Me...
---
I feel they should make it so that its like searching a chest when opening a hatch with a key, maybe like a 3/4/5 second timer so this doesn't keep happening.
---
First, I don't think they paid millions for that license. Second, one thing is buy a license, another is make a p2p game into a dedicated server one
---
I guess that makes sense.
---
&gt; You unironically linked OhTofu hahaha one of the most bias people I know
---
calling a killer main with 5.5k hours biased is absolutely rich lol, thanks for the laughs.
---
and saying that I, someone who has dumped more hours into killer than survivor since day 2 of beta, and has [historically advocated and explained why killers need buffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7r2tss/predicting_it_now/dsu6pe9/) is also rich lol.
---
Crybabies..
---
I'm not sure why it was extended to some of the event cosmetics, but for the ones that were accessible by a code it makes sense. There was sketchy 3rd party stuff going on causing people to be scammed and they wanted to put an end to it. 
---
At the end of the day its just some pretty pixels so its not really a big deal.
---
Because it removes your status and dedication symbol. It showed that you were a dedicated fan to a much older version of the game and that you actually put in the effort to work the insane grind for them. Now it means literally nothing. It's not even just in the store...which I would be much more okay with...it's given to everyone. Literally people who got this game for free now get the cosmetics I spent hours and hours to obtain years ago. Doesn't that sound bullshit to you?
---
How often do you play killer? 
---
40m Whispers when survivors don't have a reason to be in a certain location (gens/totems/chests) is basically "there's a survivor in this half of the map". Just imagine you're standing in the center of Lery's. With 40m radius you're basically "hearing" whole map. Sounds useful to you? How about Gideon then?
---
As a ghostface main from the beginning of the dlc I'm pretty sure the new cosmetic has some part in the sudden rise of ghostface's.
---
That’s very true, i have noticed that. Well the good thing is that with these rift challenges we have another way of earning bp
---
30 seconds is quite rich dont you mean 2 nanoseconds?
---
What a pathetic response
---
Thrilling Tremors is better for that, especially with Pop
---
Reply me to one question. You thinks its a ok if a survivor get unhooked to do a gen in face of the killer or just chase him to fet your attention from of the killer? Or having everyone downed basically already won but you can't 4k because, thats not tunneling
---
she’s only op to bad players. you gotta remember that humans are playing as her not AI
---
I put enough points in him to prestige him like seven times or more of possible lol
---
I’m a killer main, so I’ll take that as a compliment &gt;:)
---
Yep, been happening for over a month now. Disconnected and can't spectate after I die.
---
Hope they learnt something!
---
For Legacy there is no way for them to validate that people owned legacy. Everyone could claim they had it.
---
I still say that window vaulting change was completely uncalled for.
---
Well. Every change aside from collision and prayer beads was uncalled for, but that one stings the most.
---
If, for whatever reason, someone only plays killer. That's the killer's version of Forever Freddy. Hits the exact same. Just. *Fuck*
---
People don’t enjoy going against her yet bhvr didn’t change the main complaint people had about facing so people are still going to complain.
---
Also I’d love to know what their standards are for “over preforming” or at least show the numbers.
---
Basically since this nerf was small there will still be complaints for the same reasons so then they’ll probably nerf her again. 
---
They’ll go after GF (or Freddy) after they’re done with spirit
---
What sorta bothers me is legacy get to keep there exclusive just not anyone who spent time on any of the events
---
She was nerfed more than Nurse was, but she won't feel very different as a survivor.
---
She's still going to be really fun to play, unlike Nurse's clunky/finicky ass.
---
i would *LOVE* stretch as a survivor!!!
---
Try restarting your ps4. It fixed my problem
---
Damn the new spirit rework looks dummy thicc
---
They are not ditching all exclusives ppl with legacy can keep it so those will go way high in price
---
I tried that when I was stuck loading into the game so maybe it’ll help it again? I will try it and hopefully it helps
---
Nurse is so far from dead I wish I could assume you are being sarcastic.
---
I say just remove hatch and make exit gates spawn further  but idk, fuck keys i never use them
---
Stupid cute Huntress.
---
The event ones okay but how is getting lucky with a getting a code *hard work*
---
Hey me too lmao
---
Them playing the game isn't bullying
---
Ps4 is down
---
If that doesn't fix it then maybe try turning your internet on your ps4 off then back on again. It's a weird bug that happened a few times on ps4 already
---
"She's a top 3 killer" isn't a super high bar, just because most of the roster is just *really* weak.
---
Nurse is godly (if unfun now).
---
Spirit and Billy are very good.
---
Huntress and Hag are situationally good.
---
Everybody else ranges from mediocre to awful.
---
Did it stop you from comprehending what they said?
---
The system? Or just dbd? The killer section is working just fine for me
---
Killer queue times have consistently been significantly longer than survivor queue times for at least a year. The ratio of players queueing as killer to survivor was closer to 1:2 than to the 1:4 ideal. The main thing that changed anything about this was the recent queue system change where if a killer dodges a lobby, the survivors get to keep that lobby, with a priority for other killers to join. Survivors that are still looking for a lobby to begin with thus have to wait longer to get into one.
---
It is true that survivor gameplay has to be four times as attractive as killer gameplay for killers to be able to find games consistently at all, in theory. Something to keep in mind.
---
The only killer that was nerfed is Nurse. After years of being unchanged despite being overpowered and having ridiculously overpowered add-ons. There was no major, widespread, constant call for Nurse nerfs by much of any stretch. People just knew she's OP, and pointed out as much then and again. She is still the strongest killer in the game now and still a broken design.
---
Spirit will receive a few changes, but her strength will also barely be compromised by the changes, as they do not address many of her main problems, just like the Nurse changes didn't. They are more on the "quality of life" side of changes for survivors facing her, rather than substantial nerfs.
---
All killer characters statistically perform better than survivors at all ranks, on average.
---
I don't see any noteworthy amount of people complaining about any killer or requesting nerfs in any way that could even remotely be described as "collective". Not even Spirit did. Where are the countless "nerf Spirit!" subreddit threads with thousands of upvotes? This is a pretty paranoid victim mentality thing, as far as I can tell.
---
Why do you think people can do a gen in front of the killer if they have DS, just slug them. Do you even play this game
---
The system not game. Guess this game still works then that’s good but as of now no one on ps4 can make party’s and look at friends list lol
---
Currently doing this now. Thanks, OP!
---
This format is the best.
---
I think the devs are in love with the perk seeing as how I got it to tier 3 before I even hit level 20 on most of my killers
---
Many other ways to get rid of DS, only wastes 20 seconds max if you go after someone new
---
No it's not. It's extremely useful but is not the most effective in every single game.
---
You can't outplay a good spirit, you have basically no way of knowing what she is doing. It mostly just depends on how good the spirit/her headphones are.
---
Discussion doesn’t mean argument, learn the difference. You’re toxic cause all you can say is I’m bad. You’re surprised that treating people rude makes them treat you bad? You have a lot to learn dude. It started as a discussion but you made in an argument by being an asshole, you realize that right? 
---
Never said I hated billy, just that I dislike how he’s overplayed but hey you really like assuming shit don’t you.
---
If you think my comments an essay you must just be bad a typing. Are you bad at typing? I’m gonna assume you’re bad at typing just like you assume I’m bad at the game. 
---
You’re living proof that this subs filled with people that never go outside and don’t know how to treat people nicely. You see someone with opposing views and immediately toss words like “argument” like normal discussions just don’t exist. 
---
You could have been less condescending and treated me nicely as I would treat you nicely and we coulda had a civil discussion on this topic. Instead you choose to be an asshole, guess what I can be one in return.
---
Old BNP would like a word
---
Darn, that sucks. Hopefully they fix that soon, can’t play anything if no one can play survivor
---
You get it ! Ash is a savage
---
Lol agreed man I almost got done with all my damn 2 tome stuff
---
That's actually a really good point. As a survivor you HAVE failed twice already. But at least if you die you still get blood points, although not as much
---
He just vibin tho
---
The two sort of go hand in hand. The other 14 might be more powerful but if the top four were busted then people would still gravitate toward them.
---
Damn.  Guess I made some people angry.  If you can run the killer, being immersed is futile.  Maybe I should rephrase it.  If you can run the killer well, you won't really need spine chill.  It's helpful, but not completely necessary.  I used it when I didn't know how to run the killer.  Then I started to take the training wheels off such as spine chill, self-care, urban evasion, etc.
---
Adreanaline doesn't work against Broken? - Plague OP
---
Dead Hard can't be used against Instadowns? - Ghostface OP
---
Borrowed doesn't work when the killer has no Terror radius - new Freddy OP
---
SB is useless against a killer jumping after you at mach 5 - Demigorgon OP
---
Sure this may be overly exaggerated but so many killers recieved nerds shortly after PTB just because too many people could just wait a damn week in live before screaming for nerds.
---
So true
---
Damn, a typical sweaty swf lol
---
Pretty much this - also i dunnow most killers are not as useless as people make them out to be. Legion maybe yea but many of the others? Killer is supposed to be stressfull you are in a 1v 4 scenario - spirit &amp; forever freddy is just for people not that great / lazy.
---
just run both
---
I heard it a lot when me and some friends were doing a custom lobby and I was taking long with perks cause I don’t play the game enough to know most of them lol
---
Give me the counters to spirit that done rhyme with "pyron bill, bine brill, or natch carts" bc all of those arguments are flimsy at best
---
I like your ideas, but her movement speed is still kinda broken, making it 3,2m/s would make her at least a bit more balanced.
---
yeah swf can kind of kill that but you're still invisible
---
Yeah bro, it sure is the only joke cis people have to mock us with.
---
There’s no way any of these killers could handle jack tho
---
You should go to Tru3talent's youtube channel
---
Yeah, everyone is angry. It’s not that you said some dumb shit. It’s that everyone is mad.
---
Surely that's balanced, I might as well upload a video of my 4k with a ebony...
---
&gt;Imagine if games like Overwatch just mass released Noir Widowmaker
---
You mean like with Demon Hunter Sombra, who was given out only to Blizzcon attendees but then later made a free unlockable?
---
I think Ghostface is better. If you don't stalk as ghostface the survivors don't know you're coming until you are near them. You can also remove your stain on command to make mindgames very favored towards you. Yes, ghostface has a cooldown and michael doesn't, but Michael is way easier to detect and loop if he's in any given tier. If you use add-ons to reduce ghostface's cooldown you have it available as soon as you're at a pallet and when you hook a survivor. (NOTE do not activate your power when near a downed or hooked survivor since they can still reveal you)
---
I notice some killers be doing this which is cool, but also kinda like, dumb lol.  But i'm not complaining.
---
I’m very insulted that the whole song wasn’t played, talk about cucked
---
Ahh wasn't thinking haha
---
I've never been hit with a Billysaw that wasn't a clean hit, unless the lag is making it go 5 frames a minute. Personal mileage may vary, though, so I can't really argue against that with only personal anecdotes. 
---
Low Rank is not, and should never be, an arguement for or against how strong a killer is, and especially not in the same sentence as "after rank reset". Wrath looks good against low rank consistently, and any half decent killer is gonna have a good time if he's only up against one decent survivor trying to carry the team. Billy looks strong against low ranks because they don't understand how to play against him; hug obstacles and stay out of LoS, and you're golden. He used to be able to counter this, but his flick was already nerfed and hardly anybody has complained about him since.
---
Billy crosses the map quickly, with an admittedly short cooldown and charge. What balances this is how it's difficult to control and steer, how loud it is, and how it interacts with obstacles. All of these are mitigated by addons, but that's kinda the point of addons. Plus, in contrast to your point of "he's so powerful even if you don't know how to use him", you're not gonna be able to make any real use of his addons without knowing how to use him well. A Silent Billy is terrifying, but you're not gonna see a Silent Billy in the hands of someone playing him for the fifth time. Even if you do
---
No, they wouldn't make a killer like Billy today. For one, his niche is already filled. Map control with an instadown is pretty specific. For another, he's pretty basic. Everything that's similar in vein to him is focused on mobility but better. Also, not sure if it's just me or not, but BHVR seems to be focused on bringing in killers that drastically affect the game through their power. High speed smackage is a lot less involving than the plethora of debilitating debuffs that have been put into killer kits.
---
And, quite frankly, if you've got somebody down in 10 secd or a snowball game like what you've described, then you're playing with awful people and I will have to ask if you've played against him with anyone above rank 15. You hear a chainsaw, you find cover. Just like that, nobody's down in the first 10 seconds. If you're caught in a wide open area as your starting point, you've either been designated by RNGesus to die and that's not on Billy, or you're in corn and thus perfectly safe so long as you're not running OoO or walking into his path. If someone's getting picked up by a Billy, you make sure there's at least a tree between you and where the downed aura was. It may not be enough to save you completely, but it'll turn an instant massacre into at least a bit of a chase. Given how looping is the way to play, there's only short opportunities where the chainsaw can even potentially be useful, so he basically becomes a standard m1 killer with a few opportunities to one shot you if in an unfortunate area (if we're talking basic Billy, which is what balance discussions should be based on).
---
Almost every killer can change the game in an instant, and especially at low ranks. A trap in tall grass cuts a chase in half. Bing Bong, you're now body blocked into this corner, cutting this chase in half. Myers grabbing someone off a gen. Nurse grabbing someone off a gen. Spirit grabbing someone off a gen. Plague spraying an entire heal squad at once. Huntress throwing a hatchet at a random generator and injuring a survivor. I think the only killer that probably can't actually have a "the tables are now firmly in my favor" moment of satisfaction is the Clown, and that's because he's quite firmly low tier and needs to be tuned up.
---
In short, I disagree on practically your every point. He's in a good place against standard survivors, and nerfing him in practically any way - especially by removing his instadown, around which his entire toolkit is built - would simply make him an absurdly shittier Nurse. He'd arguably be worse than Wraith, who wouldn't be as fast but would have the benefit of better mobility. And Wrath, as much as I love him, is not a good comparison for where any killer should be after being "balanced".
---
Unsure why they decided to nerf Spirit immediately when Hillbilly is overperforming for years. At least they didnt gut Spirit completely...
---
Neat, which ones did you get
---
y i k e s
---
I'd bet on keys being the next survivor nerf as they're the last problematic item survivors have. I don't think they'll make them totally useless, but they'll probably require more conditions to be met or maybe only allow the one survivor to go through the hatch. 
---
Moris I have no idea, but I wouldn't be surprised if at least eboni moris got looked at some time in the near future.
---
I just want her power to have a sign it's happening there is a faint faint FAINT glow but u can't see it
---
But it's stated in the survivors rule book for killers vol.1
---
Take Franklin's? You can see the survivor's when they have keys you know. But keep complaining. Survivor's have counter play to mori's with a perk right? Oh wait...
---
Dats what I called karma. xD
---
Killer Main salt. Love it.
---
"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!" 
---
- William "Bill" Overbeck
---
I don't know why rank 20s make the choice to play Huntress. Out of all the free console players, Hag and Wraith have it so easy in grey ranks. Billys too if they semi know how to chainsaw.
---
Yeah, infinite load for like 5 minutes, tested network and psn settings, good there, survivor menu WONT open, game freezes. Close application, restart DBD, try as killer, still sitting to this day and wont make a lobby
---
Why should we put ourselves in the shoes of people getting scammed? They made their choice of paying a ridiculous amount of money for cosmetics. I don't care. They knew they shouldn't have been trying to purchase them in the first place.
---
Thank you!
---
Fuuuuck it's so annoying. When I play Killer, I wait an extra 30 seconds before I leave so people don't have to deal with that
---
Fukkit. Im gonna KYF if i need to
---
Top left to bottom right hahaha
---
how about if you are trapped whilst injured YOU GO DOWN
---
Why oh why does that exist.
---
It did not, but it did take value out of the alreay stupid argument made
---
And then meg uses her sprint burst
---
Killing someone down to make it a 3v1 early on is how I win games as a player who focuses on gens rather than kills. You just can't juggle the gens with 4 people alive sometimes.
---
Brings a whole new challenge to the game, besides, it doesn't automatically mean you'll die to a Mori.
---
I'm actually excited, I always hated the idea of exclusive cosmetics. I like to have the ability to wear whatever skin I want
---
"Must be done in a single trial"
---
Bro. It is a horror game. She still has counterplay to an extent and now the double works better cause no collision. Every killer is supposed to be unfair. It called a horror game for a reason. They just need to buff pig and hag.

---
Note some were changed from Tome 2 like Mori one survivor, etc. 
---
Also I am NOT looking forward to escape without being hooked with spine chill. Expect an influx of Blendettes running Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Distortion/Sole Survivor and Left Behind + a key simply waiting for everyone else to die to grab hatch.
---
&gt; But players bomb you for doing pretty much for anything.
---
Dang, too bad other players get to dictate what matters to you.
---
Edit: Oh wait
---
With an ebony, you only have to hook everyone once.
---
With a key for 2 people to get out, they would've had to do at least 3 to get out. 
---
One sounds a little more unfair to me and I play both sides evenly.
---
No. The way you use spine chill makes it less useful i guess? 
---
You can use spine chill and still run the killer aroundm it give you the notification that the killer is close and looking at you. I dont know why you woild consider this perk training wheels, especially against stealth killers my guy. I literally just got out of a game where i destroyed the killet with jukes and i was using spinechill. Wdf
---
-14
---
As someone who grinded for all the event cosmetics, I don't mind, I just wanted more choices.
---
XD
---
That implies it loses effectiveness. I doubt it does to be honest.
---
Well he may have done sports though, one of hours cosmetics is a varsity jacket 🧥.
---
As a Killer Main. We hope that you will once go against me in game. You seem the type of player that Killer's love to go against
---
I'd suggest not running object at all. It's a good perk but killers will usually tunnel down Survivors that use it.
---
Nothing puts you off of playing killer when you catch someone fair and square and they disconnect straight away, 
---
Had it happen where i caught a Claudette after she walked into me and she just left instantly, was mainly going for a slug anyway
---
The Spirit's red stain extends when she vaults, it's easy to tell in the shack
---
Mories and keys are both insanely unbalanced, I also play both sides but having 2 or 3 kills just get stolen by some bullshit key is far worse than getting tunneled morried off a hook imo. 
---
If people don't see a problem with both of these things they are delusional.
---
I never even got mine even though I did the challenge for it. Same with the Hillbilly weapon. Kinda happy it's coming free to everyone so I can finally use the shit I earned. It's also cool that people who missed out on it have a chance to use it.
---
Im more concerned over boring killers then OP killers. Clown needs something sick like a toxicity system. Or different potions to throw. 
---
Make Hag have different sets of traps. Like laying down a pentagram layout of traps, so if a survivor runs into the shape, they pop out every direction you run in.
---
I dont think killers are bad. I just want more like Ghost Face, Doctor and just, at the top of the tier list for things to do in-game, Gorgon(survivors gotta cleanse as an extra objective, killers just amazing gameplay wise).

Them losing their legacy skin has nothing to do with you not getting one in the past. It's like saying: 'People who won the lottery, stop complaining they didn't give you the money you won. I was thinking of participating on the lottery aswell, but I didn't and now I also got no money. It's how it is'.
---
YES! Its working right now, just popped on
---
I'd like it if the keys were really broken. Meaning more than one teammate would have to have the other piece/s. Or you'd have to find the other piece on the map itself. You'd have the handle only.
---
Lmao I hadn’t laughed this hard in a few days
---
Honestly why I hardly play survivor nowadays
---
Dwight goes into a locker
---
I was just under the assumption the vault was a natural benefit. Spirit is scary at windows, dont dick around near them.
---
Taking that away is actually a huge bummer and I dont even own Spirit. It changed how survivors played windows. Its spooky, something this horror game really needs more of.
---
U literally said the main objective of the killer in a game, do survivors do anything different? All you do is loop, hit skill checks, repair, escape
---
Claudette hides in a Bush
---
Well, "bad" is very subjective on the context. If a killer only gets 1-5 hooks and no sacrifices/kills during the repair phase and then 4K's with NOED, I would say they're kinda bad.
---
If the killer manages to get 1 or more sacrifices during the gen phase, the 2 more with NOED, I'd say they may be decent.
---
I struggle with achievements like this because the second I start to kill people they all just DC
---
Did you even lose yours or are you just feeling offended for no reason? I was just trying to say "Thats live, stop whining". I wasn't always writing post all over the internet telling people how miserable my life is cause I don't have the legacy - it was just an example
---
Hillbilly is considerably more balanced than Spirit, and IMO has a much higher skillcap than she ever will. As a survivor, you can clearly see and hear when he is about to use his power, you can see him coming and plan accordingly to juke him. Using his power also slows him down, and everybody in the map will hear him revving the saw. He is also loopable, but an experienced killer can still avoid being looped if he knows how to curve properly, which does take practice and skill. Overall, a fairly even matchup between survivor and killer, with the killer obviously having the advantage and the threat of the instadown, but still having to put in effort to get kills.
---
Meanwhile with the Spirit, you don't know when she uses her power, you can't see her coming, and with PB, you can't even hear her coming either. You can't really loop her, not even at the shack since she doesn't currently have a vaulting animation on the live server, and because the passive phasing is often confusing. So as a survivor, you have next to no information about what she does at any given moment, but she on the other hand has literally all the information in the engagement. She can hear you, she can bump into you, she can see your scratchmarks and even see your blood if she brought that addon. This obviously leads to comically short chases, sometimes even shorter than those of Billy despite not possessing any forms of instadown herself. Overall, i'd take a Hillbilly game over a Spirit one any day of the week as a survivor.
---
Adding gen time would hurt the already boring survivor objective. They need another objective, besides being afraid of NOED.
---
I myself am a Killer Main. Barely play Survivor.
---
If i do, Its for rituals in which i have no time jumping into hatches.
---
Seems like psn kinda shit on itself for a bit
---
It’s a Pucca copy
---
Idk what’s going on. Getting mad tired but I can’t stop now
---
Thank you Keanu, very cool
---
Why the passive-aggressiveness then?
---
I literally couldn’t find any videos of him saying more before it lol
---
How would you at least not kill 2 before a key came into play?
---
Just letting you know it maybe back up now
---
[Oh yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXWRTEbj1I)
---
Mori? NOED? Ruin?
---
Get over it and don't DC
---
Consider to behave yourself next time, you decide whether to be a "troll" or not. Respectfulness is always appreciated.
---
I handle him just fine on ps4 the detection can be a little glitched though
---
I had this happen to a Feng I was trying to kill, 30 minutes of youtube later and I won.
---
Oh boy, you haven't gone against many key wielding swfs have you?
---
Spin Chill is one of the best perks on the game. Pretty much completely destroys Ghost Face and Sprit who are two of the best and most common killers. As a bonus, also wrecks Wraith, Pig and Mikey and to a lesser extent hurts Nurse, Hag, Huntress, Demo and Freddy. Even for the other killers it still has some benefit 
---
Premonition is awful on the other hand
---
They do just kinda hit the floor. Blam.
---
Gf is broken in general, you can be looking directly at him to break him out of stalk and it won’t trigger the reveal for a couple seconds

That’s why I only get used to his base kit and it’s all I use, anything that changes charge time is no bueno
---
That's the funny thing about huntress hitboxes, they're so infuriating on both sides. As a survivor you still get hit round to corners and behind a massive tree but as huntress you aim high and somehow hit a tiny barrel.
---
He takes some getting used to, but he can be countered once you figure it out. You just need to be more stealthy than he is. Breaking his stealth mode is tricky at first and can't be done if he's leaning, main this to remember.
---
It's also a lot of fun when you're on a level with high vantage points, because you can break his stealth from high up repeatedly and really piss him off haha
---
I mean, you’re wrong but how is leader even related to spine chill or premonition - they have completely different effects?
---
Yo honestly survivors only have one objective to do gens, so if they slow this process down by cleansing some totems, it adds more diversity. Idk, i personally hate games that last only 5 mins because they start with toolboxes. That s just my opinion tho, i m more of a survivor main anyways and i really don t mind killers who use noed. The same thing with DS, don t tunnel and u won t get DS ed, easy.
---
And then you can use the fountains to waste her time by cleansing in dead zones.
---
I'm literally not even arguing with you. Yes its shitty. Bhvr has called it a legitimate gameplay style. Dont get caught and you wont get camped. That's the point of the game. Run. If you get caught you're at the mercy of the killer however that killer chooses to go about his goal which is to kill you. If he camps and kills you, his goal was accomplished.
---
Yep, happened to me too. A dwight unhooked me and tried to sabotage the hook straight after, then started to heal me but i broke away and started running exactly like that in the video.
---
Are you for real? Becuase if you're talking about behaving and respect on the internet, it's quite sad.
---
I feel your pain fellow player. I wish dbd gods shall hear my prayers and make your communications unsuspended.
---
Its really easy to break him out, sometimes you can break him out through walls, and if he does expose you, he is still a normal m1 killer, and most of the time he exposes only 1 survivor at a time, unlike MM, who exposes everybody, has a longer lunge and vaults windows faster, in my opinion ghostface is just a worse myers. I play on console btw
---
If you go to the flair tab you can edit any of the flairs to be whatever you want. Like mine, for example.
---
Its almost impossible to hit him out of it when you try to on console. I've tried multiple time and I've even been hit by hit through walls when I tried to hit him through walls hes too over pwered on console
---
Demon Hunter Sombra was once exclusive yes, but then it wasn't automatically given out to all players as a freebie, it was the very last reward as part of an event.
---
I think that's why it's important to play both sides, or at least have an understanding that servers are fucking up things on both sides. I absolutely hate playing a loop perfectly as survivor just to get hit, but then at the same time I hate getting stuck in the grab animation, or watching my Billy saw clip through a survivor but not register etc.
---
First time? :)
---
Vladislav, baby don't hurt me
---
Grow up.
---
Debatable for ruin too
---
Doc has really good game slowing and you can apply good gen pressure with nurse because of how fast she traverses the map
---
Personally I feel that, since they were originally exclusive, some of them should be behind a shard or auric cell purchase instead of given outright. 
---
but I’m not complaining, I’m personally excited to get my grubby mitts on those Ace outfits
---
And you may think this is an isolated incident, you are wrong. Ever since the dedicated servers huntress has become the single most over powered killer thanks to her hatchets hitting the GHOST of your hitbox thats left behind for a solid second if not 2 seconds. There was no chance to react to this, if i dead harded that close, thanks to the servers, the hatchet would hit me anyway, at least if she were looking at me i woulda known to move differently. Huntress is a complete joke in her current state, fuck nerfing Spirit, we need killers, STRONG KILLERS, for us red ranks, but we dont need killers like huntress, that can hit YOUR GHOST HITBOX seconds after you have moved, giving you absolutely 0 counter play.....making a compilation of this ghost hatchet shit so hopefully the devs acknowledge it.
---
Why wear a jacket when you can wear nothing?
---
Ok boomer.
---
I play on console... Like i said, just need to figure out his weakness', just like the other killers. I hated him at first because he was difficult, now he's one of my favorites to play against.
---
To be fair, it's BHVR. They don't have a good record of making sense :P
---
When a Huntress starts throwing hatchets around like that, I know for a fact I won't make it.
---
yes THAT hatchet was, the video is mentioning the fact that the huntress was looking at the meg and yet threw the hatchet at me, i then went on to explain the biggest issue with huntress and why she needs to be looked at ASAP instead of spirit.
---
Oh is this the start of nerf freddy spammer?
---
I like it because it'll separate the good spirits from the not so good. People who were good with her will still be really strong, people who relied too heavily on collision and stuff wont.
---
Then it was in your bloodweb before the update
---
You could quite literally take all of your questions proposed and apply them to any other game holding exclusive content.
---
&gt;Okay, so what is the actual impact on the game for people to have access to a few cosmetics? How does it actually affect the game besides making a small number of people mad because someone else got a cosmetic they have? Why does it bother you that someone else got a copy? Why does the perceived value of it matter so much to you?
---
What is the actual impact on the game for people to have access to Overwatch's Noir Widowmaker, League of Legend's Silver Kayle, or COD's Damascus? How does it actually affect the game besides making a small number of people mad because someone else got a cosmetic they have? Why does it bother anyone that someone else got a copy of these skins? Why does the perceived value matter so much? 
---
I guarantee you if you proposed/suggested unlocking these exclusives in these game's subreddits, not many would side with you expect those who want free handouts.
---
1. The secondary market argument is somewhat void as all of the games listed above have secondary markets for accounts with exclusive content or content codes. They didn't handle the situation as simply let's give out all the codes and exclusive content to everyone for free as they have integrity in the sense that they know players attended events or grinded in-game events for these items.
---
2. Why is it even an argument that console should have the exact same 1:1 ratio cosmetics that were released for the PC version? The game started as a PC exclusive, shouldn't it have some sort of PC exclusive content that doesn't need to be widespread to everyone and every console from here on out? 
---
3. Continuing with #2, does the upcoming phone version of Dead by Daylight ALSO need to give everyone free cosmetics because there's a secondary market for them already and everyone should have a right to the exclusive content the PC version has?
---
Propose your asked question to any other exclusive content in any other game and you will find the answer as it's fairly obvious. Exclusive content should remain exclusive.
---
Pretty good job so far intensifies
---
Wraith, trapper, hag, and F R E D D Y all used to be trash tier killers, and they've all been significantly buffed in the past. Your entire argument is invalid.
---
I'm currently doing the 15 safe unhooks challenge and all of a sudden I'm getting every benevolent Killer on the planet.
---
I know the clip doesn’t show all of it (the full 5 min game is a highlight) but tell me what you think of the survivors running speed as well. 
---
I’m calling hacks at this point
---
Aka latency
---
i just got a message back from support on the same matter after 10 days of hearing nothing i get that shit back their reasoning is so bad aswell cause if that truly was the case then what about legacy skins the real reason is they are to lazy to go get people their actual stuff back i would rather just get my david king jacket and huntress mask back and not get any of the ultra rare items than getting it all and then have the jacket be worthless
---
You've just had a fraction of a small taste of what it's like to be a killer main :)
---
You're thinking early 2018 gameplay. Playing the game now, it's so much more balanced, with a lot more situations where the match turns into a one sided slaughter in favor of the killer.
---
The worth they had was the reason they didn't want them to have any when dbd doesn't have a market there should be no reason for people to try to sell these skins which could ultimately pump out more hate to the game bc they think the devs allow this
---
Just imagine a Drake &amp; Josh chapter!
---
“This is my worst birthday ever.”
---
“Why, ‘cause we are being tortured by the Entity?”
---
“No, ‘cause it’s a little humid… YES BECAUSE WE ARE BEING TORTURED BY THE ENTITY !”
---
Megan could be be the killer!
---
"Such evil in such a little girl..."
---
Which dev thought that creating maps made by only corn would be a great idea with first person killers? It's common sense lol
---
I wouldn't say that, assuming on average each game is 20 minutes, it would take over 3 hours to earn this reward. That's not the same as having it injected into your inventory out of nowhere for free. 
---
Take 3 hours in a working wage and and that's already a good chunk of money one can spend on a game. 
---
There's a difference and it's kinda alarming you don't see it.
---
I don't think keys or moris being broken is the issue. The issue is that they are unfun in normal games.
---
Ah you mean double edged sword but the edge at your side is the size of a great sword
---
&gt;This is a thread about how we, the community feel about this.
---
Whats wrong with all the other threads that already discussed this?
---
Red moris?
---
So ........ They get camped ?
---
From the hag part of the comment, I highly doubt you have any idea how to play her. You can already archive the same result to what you described with a single trap and with a lot less setup.

Yep. That's the one that has taken me the longest too. I had we'll make it and empathy and in the majority of the matches I couldn't even save anyone from the hook cuz ever other survivor was already there immediately.
---
Killers dont host the lobbys anymore. this is common now. Also i feel like less people play killer atm. When i play killer i get instand lobbys but i gotta wait for survivor games
---
However Demon Hunter sombra was never sold as an exclusive it was always made very clear that it would be coming back again later next year if you bought it still thinking it was an exclusive that's on you
---
Yea it's not new it's dedicated servers meaning it's not the killers lobby
---
Ghostface stealth and its hide and seek for keeps.
---
How dare you dc during the loading screen because the killer brought a mori! Shame on you! &gt;:( /s
---
Thanks! What's helped me is picking the challenges that would take the longest. In the previous tome, I did all of the survivor challenges first before moving on to killer. This time I am mixing it up and it's going a lot better. Decided to get the 20 gold emblems one out of the way as I felt like that would take the longest.
---
Yes you got to learn to handle hard skillchecks. Especially on maps like lery's or the game searching for ruin is not always an option and can take way to much time, so you rather try to fix gens with ruin. Ruin will also help you to get better when you have to deal with overcharge or use ds for an example.
---
Pretty sure they fixed that a while back. Acceleration is the growing speed bubba has when he starts swinging his chainsaw.
---
They are still asking for more nerfs, so..
---
The book is actually titled "how to not be an asshole", and includes good manners examples for both sides. Exploiting a survivor DCing is wrong, just like how SWF groups exploiting match making to bully inexperienced killers is wrong.
---
He jammin'!
---
Another survivor who only knows looping m1 killers and nothing else
---
Amazing
---
Just use bt and it’s always a safe unhook
---
I think that would be better in theory than in practice. It would make it less ominous if he was constantly tilting and untilting his head during a chase
---
At least most of the killer challenges can be done in one match, pretty much all of the survivor challenges take 3 or more matches.
---
I play both Killer and survivor , when i play huntress for example i can assure u that a lot and i mean A LOT of dead on  hits didnt Register so no , its not only a  survivors problem
---
Spirit gets adjusted after a few moths of complaints...  
---
Ironworks of Misery/Rancid Abattoir/Haddonfield and more BS windows exist in the game for years :)
---
Lol nice find
---
I assume you haven't watched the DBD animated parody series by Samination. The book I mentioned was a gag in one of the episodes
---
No man I mean I'm not even getting other survivors hooked.
---
Look at her hand...GOTEM!
---
Excellent job. She’s adorable!
---
As someone who plays next to no survivor, I have no idea why people like playing against myers/ghostface. I just like playing them to scare survivors.
---
If then they are stilll not fixed just read u/LionelJHolmes comment again.
---
Like BHVR said they are tweaking things ever time without forcing us to update the game while collecting data on stuff they are aware of these problems and are working to fix it.
---
This is how I think before with P2P it was randomly bullshit to the point I never knew what to expect some times everything was perfect and other times killers had the range of 20 feet but dedicated servers have made it more consistent maybe not consistently good but considering the past it's consistently okay and I now know what to expect and when in getting hit
---
I don’t anymore with these challenges that just take time like 13 sacrifices
---
aim for face when they break pallets or pick people up but be prepared to be tunneled and camped
---
Just fyi, it's 4Head or 4HEad
---
"SWF group survivors who intentionally bully rank 20 killers are not toxic, and are in fact only using the matchmaking system for the best chance of team survival". That's the equivalent of what you're saying. 
---
If you go out of your way to kill off a single survivor as fast as possible, you're a cunt. Plain and simple. Do whatever you want when there's only 1 gen left, but don't "strategically target" a single survivor so you can kill them off at 4 gens left.
---
Sounds to me like you are getting easy games 🤔
---
No u but thank you
---
20 seconds of one person slugged, yet time for another chase and to apply pressure,regress gens, clear pallets. Only a waste if you make it a waste
---
Nice job as always bun boi
---
You're a baby, tunneling, ruin using, moriing, yada, yada, yada. We all got a message like that at least once
---
What about the "Tombstone Piledriver"?
---
The hitboxes will always seem weird at some situations but its way better then it was before. I dont have to worry about bad connection caused by my host anymore.
---
Speak for yourself please.
---
The poor thing didn't even know that the hatch prioritizes the killers closing action even if standing above...
---
Ahh bbies..
---
Please do not act like a douchebag because you feel like the other side doesn't deserve any common courtesy. The Survivor "Rules" are suggestions for fair and balanced gameplay.

Survivors don't want to be tunneled down and killed at 4 gens left, and killers don't want all 5 gens done in 5 minutes. Do whatever you want when there's only 1-2 gen(s) left.
---
Freddy and ghost face are definitely meta. Freddy is 3rd or 4th best in the game right now with gf being close behind that.
---
Exactly. BHVR wasn't going around PAX handing out codes to players and saying "oh btw, later this will be released to everyone completely free, so you might as well toss this out"
---
Holy shit im jealous. I just dont do my dailys anymore because it takes around 7 minutes to get into a killer game.
---
https://youtu.be/nvVABjafCp0

The key word that a lot of people forget is "sometimes". If you kill rush in every single match, that's toxic. if you have reasonable suspicious that you're going to get genrushed, that's a lot more justifiable.
---
No U aRe BaD!! /s
---
*sobbing* please don't eat my ass, Spirit!
---
What do you mean by Wrong? And I just wanted to comment about something. Sorry to get on your nerves.
---
I think cuz leader is used in the meme above
---
Killers don't host lobbies anymore. It's been this way for months.
---
It was sarcasm from my part. I thought it was obv
---
Yes I know, that "joke" has been the running gag on this subreddit ever since the video came out. People took it seriously to describe 100% of survivors, when in reality it barely describes 10%.
---
Actually it would be really fun if characters got lines, that they would say or wisper to each other when they meet, loudness od the voice would depend of the proximity to the killer, that would allow players to estimate how far the killer is even if he was cloaked or reduced TR just to counter those inbalances. Like some strange 6th sense perk
---
On PC, survivors just jump into a locker lmao.
---
Valk mains: I don't speak japanese
---
Only reason I got it because 2 absolute Chad Dwights sandbagged a toxic nea after I already killed the meg, and then let me have em after jumping in and out of lockers for 10 minutes.
---
Idk why youre getting downvoted, prolly cuz they dont have anything exclusive, like, i get them releasing "code" related cosmetics, but why event ones? I did unfun challenges and worked hard to get them but suddenly, devs be like "fuck u lel"
---
Quality content
---
here i was thinking there was some art to grabbing that me failing to grasp let people run off while i stood staring at the air, stunned, while the survivor pissed off into oblivion
---
There was talk of doing this months ago, but it didn't gain any steam until now
---
I mean holding M1 on a gen... You have a lot of skill there as well...
---
tbh it's frustrating to play a stealth killer and effectively have a terror radius against spine chill. I think a *very specific* nerf it could take is that it wouldn't activate if all 3 of these conditions are met:
---
1. the killer is undetectable
---
2. you're out of the killer's FOV
---
3. you're not in a chase
---
that way you could still sneak around as a stealth killer without scaring off survivors, but spine chill would still warn you if you're being stalked.
---
Hey, for the dark sense challenge, did you need to farm that or was it just 3 gens to be completed?
---
You do know that when he brought it up you weren't able to hear any sound generators or survivors made through a wall right?
---
Gonna get downvoted as always, despite me playing both sides like the supposedly community wants, but Noed is complained about and survivors do nothing about it, such as running small game to help find dull, and even ruin totems, which I run pretty often. 
---
It even helps counter Freddy (Fake Pallets), Trapper and another killer I can’t remember off the top of my head.
---
If you know killers are running a lot of one perk, run another to counter it.
---
Survivors have plenty of time to cleanse totems, and it punishes gen rushing.
---
It can reward bad killers, which is a downside as it’s too easy to use, and mostly bad killers use them.
---
I personally don’t enjoy running Noed, and would rather blood warden, but instead of solely gen rushing, survivors should go find totems.
---
Devs have even introduced inner strength to reward cleansing totems to heal in only 6 seconds.
---
Imagine complaining about DS after the nerf.
---
I genuinely enjoy when  survivors are that salty that they are giving me tips on how to play killer after a 4k
---
*Tunnels every survivor right off the hook*
---
"why are these survivors complaining about tunneling lmao so toxic"
---
Once I let two baby survivors live, like even let them heal in front of me and such. One of them tbagged me in front of the exit gate and I still don't know whether she didn't know I let her go or she didn't know that more like 2 crouches or so is considered bm and actually used it as thanks. It still keeps me up at night.
---
Do you have a link to him saying Spirit needs buffs?
---
Last I heard he was advocating for it to be more obvious to survivors when she is phasing
---
ayyy nice
---
Oof..2 keys in a row is heavy..
---
OH SHIT, TAAAANK
---
What you do is give them the best last moments they could ask for. 
---
Let the dwights run free from their lockers, let the Megs sprintburst freely through the fields, let the Claudettes rest among the tall grass, and let the Neas burn in hell where they belong :)
---
Unless I'm completely misunderstanding your question, it's Dead By Daylight. This is the Dead By Daylight sub...
---
No lol
---
If you follow his twitter he keeps up to date about the move and other bo0b3 activities
---
Everyone knows it, but its  a good meme.
---
I was running my p3 meg with botany knowledge, self-care, decisive strike, and balanced landing on The Game going against the hag
---
Nurse, Spirit, Hillybilly, Freddy, Demogorgon, Huntress, Myers would be my guess.
---
Lol it's always a bit odd as to how easily you can diffuse the situation at times. 
---
I'm not good at it as killer, but as survivor just asking what's wrong and let the killer vent a little bit works wonders!
---
Tenacity is a performance-enhancing supplement
---
**Oh, my heart.**
---
Got it! I'll add it to my list.
---
It might take a while, but I'll make sure I'll do bing bong and Ashe first ;)
---
This is true that we need to buff from the bottom tiers. But spirit needs a nerf for sure.
---
And what map were you on?
---
Beware, that skin is a killer magnet. Prepare to get tunneled a lot (talking about experience).
---
I'm fine with the spirits nerfs. But can we start buffing low tier killers now?
---
I was..... that’s the whole issue with the picture
---
The game
---
Killer problems: The reddit lights up like a chirstmas tree. Survivor problems: "lmao salty survivors" *-50*
---
And nobody was complaining about the Roof out-of-bounds exploit on Crotus Prenn getting fixed, don't kid yourself.
---
aww man, sorry to hear that :(  
---
I personally LOVE playing against doctor, but I guess more immersed players don't like it as they can't hide :/
---
I won every cosmetics in the events since 2017 and till the store arrived and the only one I was ever using is the wolfie mask for Huntress. Winning those was funnier than using them.
---
Ah I see. i’m a tank 18 killer just because i can’t be fucked searching so i gave yp
---
sir this is a wendys
---
No (you can play on a map from DLC you don't own)
---
Yes
---
Some
---
I do think dull and skeleton keys need to be more different than aura reading ability. 
---
I don't use the aura reading ability on the keys at all. I find it pointless.
---
I do however, think the dull key should only work for the survivor that uses it and the skeleton key should keep the hatch open for everyone (until the killer closes it)
---
They're probably just focusing on the more popular killers rn. Honestly how often do you run into a Trapper? Especially at red ranks, but we do need some buffs for alit of killers.
---
I main Spirit and imo it is not enough. Collision nerf imo shouldn't be a thing, now you can just stand still and she wouldn't be able to find you.  
---
She needs a sound/visual cue when she's activating her power(maybe make her moving her hands also visible for survivors). She also needs to move grass/corn/bamboo when phasing to give at least some feedback. It will also make skill cap a little higher for playing her(you can mindgame survivors by disturbing grass from one side and instantly moving to another or just avoid grass etc). 
---
But I'm really happy with addon changes, i was actually saying that prayer beads should be making global sound for like 6 months and I'm so happy they did it.
---
Turbo!!!!
---
Well done, rambo
---
Jake finishes sabotaging the nearest hook
---
&gt;I main Spirit
---
Irrelevant
---
&gt;She needs a sound/visual cue when she's activating her power(maybe make her moving her hands also visible for survivors).
---
She stand still. It's a big visual cue, plus if you play spirit you know how to counter her as survivor. Already done it and many others too
---
&gt;She also needs to move grass/corn/bamboo when phasing to give at least some feedback. It will also make skill cap a little higher for playing her(you can mindgame survivors by disturbing grass from one side and instantly moving to another or just avoid grass etc). 
---
That don't bother me if was introduced but won't be enough for the people who cry about her. They wanna loop spirit like any other m1 killer
---
&gt;But I'm really happy with addon changes, i was actually saying that prayer beads should be making global sound for like 6 months and I'm so happy they did it.
---
Yeah. That was fine, after all you can still have it by equipping distressing and whispers to gen grab
---
Genrushing is what happens with u either get bad spawn RNG or just forget that u should apply nap pressure pallet looping is how survivors like survive 
---
Is this a meme?
---
“Eat my pipe”
---
Wholesome
---
Thank you very much.
---
At the very least survivors should get an auto safety pip if the ping is above a certain amount for more than 50% of the game
---
David king dead hards in to a tree

What the fuuuuuuu.....

I haven't played in a year, so I have no goddamn clue what I just saw.

Is it a killer perk?

FROM DOWNTOWN
---
Wait.. this whole operation was your idea™
---
I have actually, 90 percent of games I play is at least a 3 man SWF and 1/3 have a key. I always kill at least 2. Even if I have to slug.
---
You did not make this 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ16IFZEcQg
---
Pallet looping well yes and no. Please don’t bitch about pallet looping unless of course you mean infinite’s which I would say about 90% are gone.
---
come on, his not that dumb. obviuosly was sarcastic
---
There's only been one challenge per tome that requires traps, and neither of them have been mandatory to complete the tome. You'll be fine if you play at level 1; it just might take a couple tries.
---
That being said, levelling Trapper a bit could make future tomes easier. Can't hurt, you know?
---
Hahahahahah this was a great clip, thanks for sharing. And... Sorry for your shitty game.
---
Hahahaha!
---
I don't know how it's now, but 2 years ago 3 generators were already complete before the killer is able to down first survivors. So he has to both secure the kill and search other 3 survivors before they start 2 more... It was physicly impossible to achieve a complete victory if played against competent team of survivors.   
---
So i wonder if anything changed in this matter.
---
Freddy doesn’t need chasing perks, he’s fucking Freddy and will just snare ur ass.
---
Yeah, healing ten health states has been a pain.
---
Keys are fair and balanced
---
When the gates open a timer begins if you don’t leave before the timer ends you die
---
If it's console versions then perhaps them reports are investigated but the PC ones are probably thrown in the trash
---
So the good Spirit players who never relied on her bullshit addons or vault mindgames are stil going to destroy SWF squads like they always did, they just need to take Stridor every game to make sure they can't lose people who use Iron Will because there is no collision, other than that, not the changes we wanted but at least the trash beads abusers are irrelevant now
---
Alternate between Killer game, survivor game, killer game survivor game, and so on. 
---
When you do your survivor games use a perk randomiser to choose your build. That way you’re constantly mixing things up after each killer game.
---
That’s the way I play
---
Pretty simple, it's a site where you can upload your work and they can print it on products and sell it! You can choose a markup and that money will go to you. They put it at 20% standard, but I adjusted it to 10% so it's a little cheaper now.  
---
With my boop the snoot post, some people asked for stickers and since I don't have any fancy printers and such, redbubble is probably the best choice \^\^
---
Thank you, that seems like a good solutions.
---
Ever heard of flicking?
---
Literally just played a game as the trapper where I didn’t even need to lunge half the time to hit survivors that were not close to me at all. I ended up letting two of them go because I know how aggravating it is to get hit even though the killers swing is nowhere near you
---
Happy cake day and I'm surprised you didn't bring you list of other threads with you
---
Gg mate ggq
---
Out of curiosity, what made you decide to main survivor so early? Have you tried killer and simply didn't enjoy it (if so, why?), or is it something else entirely?
---
Unless this is intended to be across multiple games some of these lines are unwinable! Mainly the one with “everyone dies no gens done” which also has “hatch escape” and “4 adrenalines” cool concept tho
---
Why would they even release it like this?
---
True.
---
Are those perks still can only be gotten from random event like before?
---

*Laughs un dropping 15 pallets while in a Chase challenge*
---
But moris are 😁
---
bruv you cant be this dumb....SHES LOOKING AT THE MEG THE WHOLE TIME, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE THROW. The server sent the wrong data to my client.
---
Unbreakable isn't unreasonable. It's as simple as not slugging if you don't want to risk it. Besides, they can only get themself up once.
---
I mean, these challenges make me play in an unfun way. 20 gold emblems? I don't have to change anything in my playstyle (which is fun for me) to get it done.
---
I guess we have different definition of fun
---
Repost or at least an overdone meme.
---
I thought more of a shitty bootleg Charlie Brown, but go on I guess :/
---
You need to be on 3 gens as they pop, with dark sense equipped, in a single trial, that’s all.
---
Yeah I don't get why they are saying they are turning their backs on exclusivity, just after releasing a battlepass. Do they have no foresight?
---
I'm not thrilled with BP's but a big part of them is paying for exclusive content that you grind out at the time. Does this mean all of the cosmetics we pay for and unlock will just be given away a few seasons down the line because they start demanding rare prices?
---
It's like fortnite all over again. I don't really care if they do make them available for all - but it doesn't look like that is the plan.
---
Got to call bullshit on this 'no exclusives' though because of it. Exclusives are incentive and incentive is $$.
---
So you are saying that killer is able to chase, capture and fully execute (not just hang) one survivor before 3 gens are started by other 3 survivors? Because before he wasn't able to do that, and if all survivors knew how to play, it was impossible to kill all of them, no matter how good killer were.
---
Probably had a Retard Moment again. Sorry about that. Also about your other Question, I Refrenced leader in connection to Premonition and Spine chill because of the picture
---
Don’t hurt me
---
Lol good luck doing that when pretty much 90% of survivors run Dstrike. 
---
Nowadays "tunelling" means anything from extended chases to simply hooking a person three times before the rest, no matter how exactly you played it.
---
I always get PTSD when I hear that noise when they hit you
---
How did ds work before the nerf?
---
They did say they were going to look into Haddonfield once the next chapter comes out
---
I always get PTSD from from that noise when they hit you...
---
&gt;everyone bitches about her being nerfed
---
I haven't seen a single reasonable person bitch about her being nerfed. Seems like the vast majority of people think the nerfs were justified.
---
Boomer humor
---
Sadly yes, rip for all the ghost face mains... :(
---
Yes the old mentality of entitled survivor mains. DC when the killer is doing something you can’t just loop out and/or gen rush the shit out of him. People like you make this game pretty shit
---
Idk I also feel your pain
---
Yeah, this is the thing. I've mained killer since around just after Freddy came out. While things still aren't perfect and probably never will be, I'll never understand the logic of killers only ever get nerfs - on the whole they've received almost nothing but buffs since 2.0. Legion, Nurse and Spirit get changes because they deserve it. Nurse has always been too good, Spirit has very little counterplay and old Legion was just a disgrace.
---
People who pick up and start playing killer these days will never have to endure insta heals, pallet vacuum, hatch standoffs, old brand new parts, old Decisive Strike... If only they knew how grateful they should be.
---
There are alot of them Idk all of them but the best one is Hex: Ruin you can either unlock them by levelling up a killer or buying them from the shrine with iredesent shards
---
I'm suspended for 2 weeks. And I'm pretty sure it's from people who were mad at me for stating the truth. Whether it be angry survivors or killers I'll disagree and argue, but don't use actual insults. I usually say what I want to say after they've said what they needed to then block them. I guess they spam me after I block them and get pissed when I don't reply.
---
Okay, now put Crab Rave in the background
---
Mori ?
---
Iri heads?
---
Yeah haha we spent minutes laughing about this while I was singing Britney Spears
---
Throw in a fantasy kiss in there too and I’d be happy as well
---
... Maybe that's a bit too far
---
People ridiculing keys tend to get shit on in this sub for some reason, I've seen it a ton, especially lately.
---
I have legacies im already targeted
---
Dude every time I’ve tried this nobody ever joins. The killer always understands but the other survivors just keep crawling and don’t try to race
---
I'm sorry to hear that :(
---
For me? I used to see DBD as a horror game. Now I see it as a video game.
---
No. But you disrupt the survivors by hooking another they come to rescue and the more of them that come the better for you
---
Woah, Darth Maul?!
---
Base game with good survivors, no. 
---
Run ruin and good killer, yes.
---
Wow. I feel your pain. One time, I had a survivor open the hatch and escape. Then, the person I was chasing ran to the hatch and got out. I shut the hatch which triggered the gates. I found someone at the gates and hooked them for their last hook. The hatch opened and the last survivor immediately jumped out.
---
Either Judith's Tombstone or the Tombstone Piece will allow you to kill survivors in T3.
---
Not luck but ok haha
---
Also acceptable
---
Yeah right now I main Michael Myers. He’s such a fun killer. I’ve only gotten to Rank 11 with him but I’m not a killer main I’m sort of 70/30 survivor sided. I really only play killer for bloodpoints and occasionally when I get bored of survivor.
---
Sounds like something ash would say...
---
If the only reason you wanted something was that no one else had it, you really didn't deserve it in the first place.
---
These cosmetics are still going to look good, so there's no fear of them suddenly not being worth using, and a lot of people are still not going to use them because other skins come out. I guarantee you that a bunch of people are still going to run around as Shirtless David instead of wearing a jacket.
---
But it literally costs you nothing for other people to have it as well.
---
Lmfao hahaha
---
Adorable
---
He had Franklins sooooo...
---
I'd say well deserved
---
Dedicated servers need work, not to go.
---
And have you not seen the Tome? You get bonus bloodpoints for using Trapper's perks and catching people in Traps, so of course people are going to use him.
---
An absolute unit of a killer who just manhandles survivors is a great idea. It’s comical yet also very imposing knowing that you can just be suplexed at any time during a chase.
---
Noed is just reverse ruin, CMV
---
Gorgon* sorry that Gan killed me.

They are both cancer for the game wtf are you on about moris have nothing to do with keys. They just grant a free win

&gt;People took it seriously to describe 100% of survivors
---
No, nobody's thinking that.
---
&gt;it barely describes 10%.
---
Which is exactly the point. 9 people drop a "gg" and leave. That 10th person, crying "fuck you killer why didn't you give me hatch bitch ????" spoils the broth.
---
Also worth pointing out you'll run into 10% of survivors about 1 in every 3 games.
---
The point of spirit is that she is guessing killer that’s her power you have to play smart and think against her
---

Coward giving up your team like that

There are definitely hacks in the game on PC within the last year and a half. About 3 months ago I went against a killer with wallhacks. My friend was like "they're wallhacking" and I just assumed they were salty about being found hiding... but nope. 100% wallhacks. After the killer killed my other friend they teleported me and the remaining two survivors WITH THEM INSIDE THE EXIT GATE (there were 4 gens up lol). This killer had hacks that allowed them to not just teleport themselves, but to teleport all the other survivors at will. I'm so glad I recorded that shit. They were also proud of hacking in end game chat.
---
I also just assume it's easier to hack on killer without being noticed than survivor, since it is genuinely hard to tell if someone has wallhacks or not. I'm sure I've gone against a few other hackers as well I just couldn't be 100% sure because it wasn't as obvious as being teleported around.
---
Atleast you understand it's just a joke lol. I might have to delete it. It's in the negative and I am scared. Karma on reddit is very important to me.
---
how does someone sell outside steam?
---
Just do bones
---
... Meanwhile, ebony moris allows you to ignore anti-tunneling mechanics and remove survivors from the game twice as fast.
---
Yeah I had to do three generators challenge and I hated it but you bet your ass I did it at the expense of my team. Luckily I'm SWF so they all knew the gig when we got into the match.
---
Since when Clown is low tier ? Ive been away for some time but pc killers used to kill it with clown as far as i know.
---
saw 2 survivors with medkits chasing another injured survivor around the map who just wanted to self care... while I was on first hook... with one gen left to do... and the killer nowhere to be seen...
---
long story short - I died on first hook. the 2 chasers died and the self carer got the hatch...
---
I see a lot more ebony moris than successful key plays. And I think moris are way more of a problem because while a key is often wasted, an ebony mori is almost a guaranteed 3-4K in the hands of a capable killer. So putting them on the same level is kind of a false equivalence to me.
---
**But** I do absolutely agree that both being reworked would be good for the game.
---
Welcome... To Jurrasic Park!
---
\*Video plays\*
---
Steve lets out a girly scream
---
No, but I don't want a killer that survivors have no chance of surviving in chase.
---
same here
---
What OP is saying is that if the spirit ran prayer beads and was a in. A loop with someone in a set group people outside the terror radius could tell them if she’s phasing or not
---
Can you complain about them jumping in the hatch right infront of you when you had franklins?
---
Yeah this, i basically just play normally if theres 1, and if i thrash them and they show they dont deserve it i dont 3 hook them, if they play well regardless then its game on.
---
I play it normally and if they give it their all after they All have been hooked twice I let them go
---
I understood that when saying what I said. The add-on change makes it seem like it'll be like bone clapper doing the sound while in terror radius or not
---
Yes it does lol but the joke wasn't clear man
---
The pre-BNP nurf days would've made people now have an aneurism lol
---
Easy countered with Alt+F4
---
What if the survivor is waiting for you to pick up their friend to flashlight save them? That’s exactly what happened to me while in my game.
---
I call it "baiting the hook". They wanna take the bait, that's on them. I have turned a 1k into a 3-4k because they took the bait. Let them be mad at their own hubris.
---
Check with the search bar first, and thatll tell you.
---
If you are the obsession, when the killer down and picks you up for the 1st time, the skillcheck will prompt and you can use DS right away. If you're not the obsession, you need to wiggle to around 30% to get the prompt. It was so busted and bad for the killers, since a good survivor can practically loop you for ages. The only way to counter this is by juggling them to the hook. But even this doesn't work against swf or very altruistic team because they'll body block. The DS after nerf is way better imo, it prevents  tunneling. If a killer get ds-ed, it's their own fault now.
---
THIS SERIOUSLY JUST FUCKING HAPPENED TO ME.
---
keys are simply as unbalanced as this game gets, funny thing is that most of this sub denies it and pretends they're a normal part of the game.
---
they lose bloodpoints for staying by the hook
---
I believe so, as long as they have the PC version from the Windows store and you both enable cross play in the menu, you should be fine.
---
Maybe I could’ve been, I just thought someone would understand it’s a joke and not that I’m completely stupid. 
---
But then again it’s reddit, you really don’t know sometimes lol.
---
Yay! Thank you very much! &lt;3
---
The shard crap has been disproven so many times. And even if it was there, you're still just gambling that the direction you're walking in is gonna be the right choice. I just want something like what she has to figure out where you are, literally just seeing her move grass would add so much room for counterplay.
---
Ahoy... ladies...
---
Just don't cry if they bring a key.
---
Well it's not funny, that's why. Personally I never use mori's.
---
Fixed? Wrong word and secondly he only got the rights to the remake so no he can’t us the original.
---
The original is most likely hard to even get, I mean why do you think the producer went behind Wes cravens back and made the remake anyways lol.
---
Well that and also how braindead easy he is to play. No slowdown for setting pallets or snares while every killer gest slowed and some has to aimt as well, but freddy doesnt have to think in that regard sadly
---
Then u fucking hit them and bait them to come back resulting in a easy down
---
Lol I don't think you're stupid, just hard to make jokes without body language sometimes you know :D
---
They left snail trails because they thought you were so hot.
---
survivor mains downvoted you but I got you
---
I just hit the survivor down for pressure and then chase the other person because otherwise gens start flying
---
17. Extremely Negative
---
Why?
---
His insurance refused to pay for his plastic surgery. Therefore the Doctor won't fix his face for him.
---
keys are fine, they get their guaranteed win if I get mine
---
He wouldn't have to if everyone used the search bar first.
---
I play killer at red ranks, looping takes skill, knowing when a killer is mindgaming a pallet and playing around it is 100% outplaying. Baiting a respect on a pallet or baiting an early swing for another loop is skill based counterplay. Also... a killer moves fast enough to where you can only vault the ironworks window once without lithe.
---
After the blind, count to 1 then do it again. Two blinds really quickly.
---
Nurse just got reworked and all you have to do is dodge her first two blinks and she's a lot less intimidating.
---
Yeah, I think exactly the same. Also I play Survivors more too since is way more relaxing
---
"When you play against russians"
---
And have the killer camp the exits with no other way to escape?
---
Yes also things like that, although i think that  something like the red gravestone is in some way balanced but one hit axes are definitely not acceptable!
---
Yeah welcome to r/deadbydaylight
---
90% of the people on this sub are just survivor mains reposting and posting video clips of them ds’ing the killer at the exit gates. 
---
If you talk about killer balance or spirit you will get downvoted and shit on.
---
Like you said, it was created behind the back of the creator. So I’d say broken. And that’s no ill will to Haley. Plus it’s just my opinion so no need to fight about it, but there’s a reason it never got its planned sequels. Just sayin’
---
WGLF+we will make it+ borrowed time+exhaustion perk....
---
Man I can’t wait to finish grinding and be able to play better builds... but there so much perks to unlock...
---
Have a up vote litle one
---
I bought Golden Feng Min about 2 years ago for like $450. I was angry at first when I saw the update, but more at myself since I had a feeling back then this would happen eventually (keep in mind this was before any cosmetic store, and Feng Min was my main). In my defense, that was money I had saved up and had absolutely nothing to spend on (yeah, I kinda have a spending problem). At least now, I'll get the event cosmetics I earned but randomly lost, and I'll want to play other characters (felt obligated to play Feng because of sunk cost fallacy).
---
I played a couple of killers up to rank 15 then switched over to survivor and never even thought of going back. I think it's just the team aspect of survivor that appeals to me. As survivors go down the game gets harder and harder and you become more reliant on each team member which creates real tension. 
---
I found the opposite to be true with killer. If you can pick a couple off early on the game seems to be pretty much over. But obviously I'm only speaking from the perspective of someone playing at a very low killer rank.
---
It's not that I don't so much enjoy killer I just find it a bit monotonous. I'm sure I'll go back to it at some stage when I better understand the game.
---
Honestly all they need to do:
---
\-Short "unlock", which can be interrupted, but is short enough to be used in a pinch. 3-4 seconds is fine.
---
\-Allow the killer to grab a Survivor as they are jumping again. There was no reason to take that away in the first place since you need to be extremely close to the survivor to grab them anyway.
---
\-Dull Key opens the Hatch for yourself, but it closes right after. Skeleton Key opens it for everyone, like now. There's just no real difference between the Purple and Pink variations. Extra time for the Add-ons sure, but 99% of the time they take it for the hatch escape.
---
This would only impact the people who get cocky and jump right in front of the killer.
---
Yup still the same
---
Yes but fixed would have to mean there’s something wrong with it and there’s not.
---
It never got sequels due to it being very pervy in a bad way and it also had horrible actor choices. Also the script sucked.
---
It is double sided because some survivors are just being chased the whole map after being unhooked and no one can stop the killer. On the other hand, i agree with you, sometimes you don t tunnel and still get DS ed. I don t know what would be a good fix for this, but it is not as frustrating to deal with as it was before the rework.
---
And thus making stridor a pointless perk. You're viewing this only from the survivor pov dude.
---
Y'all use the weirdest meme templates I swear.
---
I dont get?
---
Bad English I guess?
---
must*
---
Yep, it would be a total slaughterfest with 4 console survivors against a Pc Nurse. Would honestly make killer just too easy
---
I think the devs intended it to look like that. At least you actually get to see the cosmetic, huh.
---
You’re not a clown you are the entire circus
---
Tunneling OoO is fine.
---
Strategically if they’re in a SWF so long as they’re alive they’re constantly able to communicate your position to their teammates. Therefor it’s just smart tactics to eliminate that source of information.
---
If they aren’t in a SWF they’re probably just looking for attention so it doesn’t matter if you give it to them.
---
He said Spine Chill was better lmao. You never learned greater than/less than symbols, did you?
---
It is broken, at least on PS4. The game doesn't track it properly. It's one of the few trophies in the game at 0.1% earned, which doesn't make sense as it's a trophy you'll get pretty naturally.
---
Every single time I have tried to boop to snoot I have been stabbed and chased
---
Yep
---
It’s nice to see a positive post about this game once in a while
---
Thank you for acknowledging the truths pro Pain hammer was really easy to get lol
---
Anw, I’m glad I can make someone smile.
---
id be happy if they just made him taller. would make him look a lot better and that way his hit boxes would feel more realistic...
---
The amount of blood on the floor, holy shit
---
My team mates don't even save me most of the time
---
lmao imagine spending more than 3$ on a fucking skin
---
Probably because stalking aside the corn maps are notorious for having bad map design and bullshit infinites (the window on torment creek, the window in rancid, rotten fields being the biggest map and if you’re not billy you’ll get gen rushed) 
---
Corn maps are fine until you get a full sweat rank 1 team that knows how to abuse these tiles. It’s miserable.
---
Thank you! Figures as much but wanted to be sure. Glad I never took the tutorial now.
---
I’ve never not 4k’ed as Burger King Myers, and I don’t run PWYF.  Lery’s Map offering, Devour Hope, Ruin, Haunted Ground, Thrill of the Hunt.  All totems lit buys you the time you need.  I honestly thought that was common before yesterday and someone told me “oh well good survivors will destroy you.”  I mean, that statement could apply to literally any scenario lol.
---
I thought they are giving all the stuff for free including our event ones if not then my mistake
---
Doctor? Really. 
---
Michael also? Sure Michael was just a normal kid that turned into a killer quickly and that’s about what makes him more menacing.
---
If it's Ghost face you may want both just to be sure. Too many times I moved away from my location but noticed my SC did not dim, turns out the fucker was not where I expected him to be. If I had both this would not have happened.
---
Nope I don’t play on mobile but that’s my best suggestion for now, you could wait till others give you better ideas or you can scour the internet in search of someone having the same problem you have to find the fix that way.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dwq8f0/credit_to_ueszrok_today_i_found_what_trapper/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
While I have nothing to say on dedicated servers, to answer your other question, Trapper has Agitation, and one of the rift challenges is to hook two people on the basement hooks with Agitation.
---
Ik im saying the devs could easily put a opt out to be matched with pc users
---
Agreed, but I think the changes make her more viable to play against also
---
I'll be honest, I read $5 instead of $500 on the original post and was like " that's not really that bad.." now I see my mistake lol
---
*surprised Pikachu*
---
Whilst i am a Killer Main who goes out of his way to not use it, I have been playing a lot of Survivor recently mainly because I’m done with only reliably being able to do good with Nurse/Spirit but also because Steve Harrington is a sexy mofo. So basically I always cleanse a dull totem whenever I see one simply because it gives BP, Contributes to the Lightbringer Emblem and gives me a break from rushing Gens. It really is not hard to counter which separates it from old DS. Old DS only had juggling and that was really only worth it if the hook was close. NOED is also a lot more balanced then you’d think since it’s more of an Ace in the Hole of the Killer because you only have three perks for the majority of the Match and since it can be countered before it’s even Active. I think it’s a dumb perk but it’s really not as bad as old DS.
---
Precisely! Hopefully this will please a good chunk of the community!
---
Pig’s ability to T-bag slowly: “Are you challenging me?”
---
Just mori after second hook
---
Ya ik id be pleased I’m fine with playing with Xbox users and even switch users
---
As long as that’s a thing I’m all for crossplay then. As long as it’s a decision to not be put in with pc players. But as I’ve never seen that option in a game yet I’m hesitant to think this will be a thing.
---
Guys just go play COD or something if you want a symmetrical game.. this isn't it, it's literally in the description.
---
The nurse changes were definitely not just minor balance changes. She plays quite differently and is weaker than Spirit now (Much better than hillbilly and below though lol). All her add ons were changed too.
---
I don’t think so.  Top survivors are still going to keep doing their thing.  Mid and baby survivors will stop.  And she’ll be giving away the add on, like before, but info that survivors can use
---
Doesn't really work here
---
I thought fortnight was like that and also rocket league? In any case there is cross play  for the windows store and steam version and you can enable it on or off if you want don’t see why they would not add that on console
---
He’s edited the order you fucking mong
---
Don't worry, they already started cross platform with windows store and there is an option to prevent being matched with em
---
They would sell the codes on ebay usually.
---
Killers wouldnt do it tho, why not have an easier match and an advantage, And what killer would you go against when you are playing pc and your friend ps4? You both enable ps4 only, you have an advantage, and when you enable pc, your friend has a disadvantage. So it doesnt matter how you put it someone will always have an advantage or disadvantage.
---
Was that to correct me or your own opinion ? In both case I want to specify the tag Shitpost/meme. This post is just a joke \^\^
---
I didn’t want it to feel drawn out
---
At least I didn't buy that silly cosmetics like the rest of the troupe.
---
Alright then yeah they got my vote.
---
*looks at Jane*
---
What perks?
---
BITCHIN
---
I haven’t played either of those games. So I didn’t know that was a thing. But that’s good to hear.
---
Lol ffs.
---
For some reason to me it looks like a hybrid between feng min and laurie strode
---
Nah.  Keys and Moris end games so prematurely.  They don’t belong in the current state of dbd
---
I don't want to nerf survivors I just want every killer to be viable at rank 1 assuming you use them correctly...
---
Gameplay favorites: Legion and Doctor 
---
Gameplay least favorites: hillbilly, huntress
---
Lore favorites: legion and clown
---
Lore least favorite: wraith
---
Why does it matter what a killer on pc picks? If ppl on survivor opt out then they would never get matched up with that killer.
---
If you are willing to play with a pc users then you should be forced to play with a pc killer for it to be fair for the killer just like how fortnight does it. But that’s my opinion
---
Fair enough, I can't very well see that, can I? My bad for assuming. Also go fuck yourself lol
---
Holy shit your history shows you're literally obsessed with the guy. Poor soul
---
Killer: trapper
---
Perk 1: Iron grasp
---
Perk 2: Agitation 
---
Perk 3: Deer stalker
---
Perk 4: Hex Ruin
---
At this point I'm pretty sure I've met at least one killer main who thinks ebony moris should be normal and that this is legit counterplay and unfair to them
---
That would make it useless
---
I mean, like, every video game now has an old Japanese and Oni theme, so, would not at all be surprised
---
BHVRs solution: new killer perk “locked in” - waste a perk slot to prevent hatch from being unlocked by a key
---
Also BHVR: *big pats on the back* “I think we nailed it this time everyone”
---
Remember when everyone actually likes the old Hallowed Blight objectives and they added something else to do in the game?
---
Well:
---
Future Events
---
Recently, we’ve changed the way we handle in-game events and wanted to take a moment to explain why we’re putting elaborate objectives on hold. Unique event objectives take a huge amount of time to create and test, taking up time that could be spent fixing bugs and creating new content that’s available year-round. Going forward, events will be focused around extra Bloodpoints (through Offerings and/or Blood Hunts), Archive challenges, and event-exclusive rewards within the free track of The Rift. This allows us to focus our efforts on game health, which we ultimately feel is for the best.
---
It isn't tunneling if you´re talking ¨Stalking¨
---
I'm fine with the hatch, the end game would be boring as fuck if there were one survivor and three gens. Sure, they might get lucky but that's the game man.
---
I'm ok with addon changes and no collision but window vaulting was gd before it made her more unpredictable which is her whole shtick
---
Moris and keys are fun and balanced.
---
Bruh it's a bug. Invisible Freddy was moving the grass and corn before and other killers too and I'm not marasmatic. So I'm pretty sure Spirit was also doing it too before.
---
I wonder why my suggestion voted down, and "the game" and "what map were you on" got upvoted? :D I not really care about my points, just wanted to understand people's brain :d
---
Correct.  If somebody wanted to make a comic or a movie, they would have to get a license from bhvr to do so, legally
---
Huntress is a top 5 killer with the most broken add-on in the game. God forbid all killers are huntress good. I personally think killers like Ghostface and the clown have the most optimal difficulty levels.
---
Not tunneling if you mori them on their first down 😉
---
I'm thinking x amount of time killers arent looking at the survivor makes the timer tick down from 30 seconds? If they tunnel the timer will stay full, of they leave itll drain
---
If he looked slightly to to his side...JUST SLIGHTLY you would've gotten shower fucked
---
I think adding back killer grabs would just bring back 15 minute long hatch standoffs again
---
And people say NOED is unbalanced
---
I’ve only played Bubba a handful of times but one time I did face camp the first person for like 15 seconds just to make them think I was a face camping Bubba.
---
Wow, someone didn’t get hugged enough.  “So fuck off”?  And oof, SEVEN HUNDRED HOURS!!!! Wowwwwwwww big man
---
Then just decides to give the killer head
---
He’s lying
---
lol I don't give a fuck either way. I was beinf a smartass. They got hostile. I even admitted I was wrong for assuming. But fuck you, too
---
The only infinite i see anymore is Ironworks. love that map as survivors even without BL.
---
I'd like VC if only so i can hear that one kid in the lobby who plays baseboosted music through their mic.
---
No Comment
---
Thank the lord. I barely missed those when i joined.
---
Thanks for explaining the placebo effect to a physician who just had no idea.  BENEFIT is the key word.  Maligned better describes what the person I was talking to, meant
---
He lied to you.
---
Clearly you were just outplayed and outmatched by the 200 IQ game play tactics. Get good or go home scrub
---
&gt; since it can be countered before it’s even active
---
You're absolutely right about NOED being able to be put out of play before it even enters play. But unlike old DS, where you, as the killer, had you and you alone to rely on to counter it. In the case of NOED, countering it is usually a team effort. In last night's game, I spend almost the entirety of the game being chased by Ghost Face. I literally had no time to look for totems. I barely even touched a generator, but I got punished by NOED regardless. I usually always cleanse the dull totems I find. But apart from giving you BP, cleansing totems doesn't bring you any closer the final goal, opening the exit gates. So if you're going out of your way to prepare for NOED, while hoping your team does the same, all that time you spend cleansing totems, is time not spent repairing generators, or saving teammates. Therefor NOED almost always gives you *some* value as a killer without any thought on the killer's part. Either by giving one or more undeserved kills, or stalling the survivors as they spend precious seconds cleansing the totems.
---
If you don't cleanse totems and the killer has NOED. You could be in serious trouble. So you have to cleanse totems in preparation for a perk the killer might not even have. I think that's just not good perk design. Maybe if NOED's activation requirement wasn't straight up partywide Exposed status, and something else instead, then it might be more balanced. What if exit levers took longer to open, or was "blocked" for a short while NOED was activated? Or the killer got a higher speed boost, lower attack cooldown, vaulting speed, all or none of the above? Just some suggestions. I just think it's not in a good state.
---
You can argue it isn't because in order for a survivor to get away from a hook and heal to be in this situation the killer must have already switched their objective to someone or something else. He could have hooked 2 other people in the meantime and still have a choice between a non-hooked and hooked person. I would be very reluctant to call it tunnelling in this scenario. You had your chance. Too bad for you that you're the better target.
---
I once wrote "Have a nice day" at the end of the game (no sarcasm / irony).  
---
The response: "F\*\*\* you" xD
---
How dare you people, being nice to each other and stuff! Shame on you. /s
---
There is a catch - do you see 4kill constantly against full rank 1 premade teams with mics, or rank 20 teams of randoms?
---
Damit, I rank away so gens could be done. Stop trying to flashlight save me, David, I'm on my last hook!
---
Pc can't play with console. At least not yet.
---
Yeah, he is meta as fuck right now. Best M1 killer.
---
Which is good, the rework was awesome, feels way more fun to play as and against him than Spirit or Nurse. Even Forever Freddy. I'm maining Freddy, Myers and Doctor as killers and I have a lot of fun as Freddy and Myers at red ranks... Let's not talk about Doctor.
---
No not visible like any other killer they have a very obvious "I'm using my power now" spirit shards of glass do glow when she activates her power but u can't fucking see it that is something they should fix and make glow brighter
---
Last one i remember was huntress. Don't they have in-game descriptions though?
---
I enjoy watching and participating in slug races lmao
---
It's been a little more frequent this last week with lag issues I think. I've clearly vaulted through windows or pallets and have enough distance to not get hit. Then Billy teleported.
---
I hate noed cuz it rewards the killer for losing
---
I let every ash w/ ashy slashy go as long as they're not toxic
---
It's a baby huntress
---
I take it as a free pass to not care who I'm downing/hooking. Can't be accused of tunnelling if you can't tell them apart!
---
If they took some time to use/played an animation of the survivor unlocking the hatch that took at least 6 seconds they would be fine imo. they should also allow the killer to grab you if you opening or jumping into the hatch because  your escaping it should not be instant or easy.
---
Bruh he had Franklin's
---
Indeed, especially when you realize Spine Chill works against stealth killers.
---
i havent seen this one or the format and i browse daily. so idk what that dudes smoking
---
It was, but they also need a lot of time to do that. If you stick around and guard - survivors will just repair others. If you leave - they just stop the decay progress.
---
Jesus Christ, that is NOT a placebo effect.  Placebo effect refers to a POSITIVE EFFECT/BENEFIT that is perceived because of X, where as X has zero evidence to cause such effect.  People biased to a greater negative effect to only a slight negative, is not the same thing.  You are using a term incorrectly to describe a phenomenon.
---
Downvote me all you want fuckers :-). It’s a fact though 😇
---
You forgot the /s. Ppl don't think you were joking
---
You can't see it because of the mask, but Myers is very sensitive to post-game chat bullying.
---
Don’t forget the Jane. I let her drop a couple pallets on my head
---
In the universe were you have BBQ and want 4 stacks above a kill.
---
You are mistaken. The stuff they are giving away for free are not from game events but from real events like from PAX as a example the golden Feng outfit.
---
The survivors who behave like this are so stupid they don't even understand that they are insulting themselves even more. If a killer killed all of them and, according to them, he needs to learn how to play, how worse can they be if they ALL lost again a player who hypothetically doesn't even know how to play?
---
Yeah. Often Times losses can be traced back to bad teammates.
---
Slender man. Would be interesting but idk seems very bland and boring and I wouldn’t want him in the game. Just as bad as someone asking for a fnaf animatronic. 
---
But idk slender man even though he’s a horror icon just doesn’t seem like he would make too much sense on how he already works. And even if it did I just don’t find how he could be cool in anyway at all.
---
The format is old but this meme is fresh
---
He jivin'!
---
“Yeah just mindgame her back and pretend like you know which of the 6 strategies she’s going to use” just shut up honestly lol
---
Jokes on that universe, I don't like Barbeque sauce.
---
I’m not sure if “demogorgan is OP” or “Freddy is now trash” is worse. 
---
Demogorgan is anywhere near OP and Freddy is light years better than he was. That rework was well done.
---
🤷‍♂️ His power is that his projections will randomly appear when you turn and if you look at it he will be alerted to that location and can teleport to it.
---
That would make killer queues just way worse than they already are. And when you only make it a survivor option, pc Survivors would have an advantage over ps4 players. With the windows store players it isnt a big deal because they still use mouse and Controller. Sure would be a cool feature to play with your ps4 Friends, but the disadvantage would still be there.
---
Oh then yeah I feel that should be 100% special and not for everyone then.
---
God dammit, I had exactly the same feeling.
---
I wish they made slenderman inspired killer
---
People always forget about those sick BBQ stacks. I’m with you brother.
---
No nothing wrong with choncky ghostface i think it quite funny how you have the stealth killer and you can make him laaner and CHONKY
---
no because you can close the hatch even if survivor is standing on top of it
---
Legion is broken to the core, they'll need to Freddy it the next time they rework those poor teens. Which is going to take more dev time than those quick Spirit nerfs, so I get why it's not on top of the priority list.
---
Also, Legion had its time to shine relatively recently, I'd prioritize Doctor and Clown for instance, if I was them. Then maybe Pig and Trapper.
---
I wonder if this is a huntress lullaby bug. Did you happen to see what the perks were at the end?
---
Also are you on PC or console?
---
Yeah, Doctor is pretty sad. I main Clown, I hope both can get a rework
---
Tombstone is broken, but at least it's fun to play against when it's obvious they have it.
---
So basically find the killer harsh him or her preventing them to play their hex just like it a team is on top of a trapper 24/7 his traps will be disarmed and useless
---
Have not seen a killer yet that moves grass or corn. 
---
If Freddy used to do it, then he and no one does anymore.
---
Seems like this would be wasting a lot of time for the killer at the start of the match.
---
Plus, survivors could just do what they do now, see where the killer goes at the start and go there to cleanse their hex...
---
Isn’t Medic broken too? I’ve been playing hard since January and don’t have that one either. I heal people all the time.
---
DC
---
and also he had Franklin's...
---
Hound huntress? Pro pain Billy? Kate's shirt?
---
I think considering the other changes they're making, they shouldn't really need to tweak anything else, but we'll see how it pans out
---
What if you want to run 2-3-4 hex perks? How will you choose which one to place first? How will you place Haunted Ground?
---
I would say them rushing the hatch should give it away. I get the first one not knowing but after that if I see them rush up you would have to expect it.
---
Haven’t seen grass or corn move since then from killers.
---
because there is Franklin's and btw OP had it
---
I swear I heal someone and it feels like they chase the killer right into me every time
---
May have missed those if that’s the case then that sucks.
---
I personally would like first bubba  to get reworked, he was my first main  and really wanna see what they'll do with hi.. Maybe trapper after too but only time will tell
---
Everyone did. There even was a funny bug when killer was moving in the basement and the grass above was moving. With visible killers it just wasn't relevant in other cases because, well, you don't look at the grass when you see the killer
---
Would it make you mad if I told you I got it my first tombstone Myers game? It was on the game map, 2 survivors trapped a kate at the spawn and the other stood by, t3'd immediately and killed them pretty quickly after they ran off.  Red rank game too
---
Doesn't change the fact that keys are plain stupid with little to no counterplay, just like ebony moris
---
That means exlusive. If everybody have it, then it is not excluseive. That's why something worth more when only a few exists. It is really alarming if you not understand this.
---
Add in Lithe and you can do it during chase.
---
The challenge after that is no fun. 
---
2 killer stuns with pallets, everybody’s wasting all these pallets how am I supposed to stun them.
---
Oh is that why he isn't in the newer ports?
---
Time is already a huge deal in this game. The idea is decent, but not realistic in the games current state.
---
I thought I did too. But have not seen it since I tried testing for it. Maybe they fixed it recently, or maybe it had to do with a specific set of video settings that it was bugged and still may be
---
Lo and behold:
---
[Spirit in 2018 moving grass](https://youtu.be/3-kGA5KyQuk?t=200)
---
Sorry but I don’t think you understand what I mean so I’ll try to explain more clear. 
---
If say a pc killer has the option to play with ps4 enabled then they can be matched with anyone on ps4 that has it enabled as well. So I never said it would only be a survivor thing so killer times would not be any worse.
---
I play a little game of hot potato where I'll half ass one person until another does something I dont particularly like
---
There’s a big difference between feeling entitled and feeling like you earned something.  That’s all I got on the topic
---
It was always active I believe
---
Some people loved it but others blindly shat on it because it wasn’t aether. I’d say 50/50
---
I would imagine that the killer could wait a bit before placing their hex, could even potentially trick the survivors into thinking they didn't bring a hex. For example, the killer could wait until 2 gens are completed before placing his Hex: Devour Hope or Haunted Grounds. I'd imagine that you wouldn't need to place your hex at the start of the match necessarily. I am not 100% on this idea but i'd think it'll make the hex's feel...less RNG?
---
They can spend their money however they like. Not sure why people seem to care so much. The part that sucks is that they bought these codes after the devs said the codes would be exclusive. If you should be mad at anything; be mad that the devs lied. 
---
Regardless, while I personally wouldn't spend hundreds on virtual items, it's no reason for me to judge a person. I'm sure we all spend money on things others might consider pointless.
---
I hate them. I do not feel they are needed and I hate the recent trend towards killer nerfs.
---
If the killer doesn’t play nice I just kill myself on hook or DC too. I don’t care, someone else already ruined the game, I’m not going to try and have a real one where I’m at a huge disadvantage.
---
So fun and most importantly *fair*
---
Am I the only person who doesent have a problem with her
---
I would say remove them all together, making them ultra rare doesn’t really do much as I usually get 2, maybe 3, ultra rated every new bloodweb at level 50
---
Oh yeah bubba too definitely. 
---
But they'll need to be careful, he is in a bad spot currently where he can be a fucking beast in the right hands with a PWYF build and completely trash in other situations. Will be hard to balance around.
---
Yeah i understand that, it's just the worse feeling to bring Hex: Ruin only for it too be cleansed instantly because a survivor spawned next to it. I wish it didn't feel so RNG.
---
Ah ok, I have a feeling it'll be Gen Rush city for a while.
---
I'd imagine it would go in order of your perk slots. So if you had Haunted Grounds in the first slot it'll be placed first.
---
Exactly having ruin be in shrine so soon after switch's release was amazing.
---
Most of my random teammates are capable at either doing gens or finding the totem in a timely manner now.
---
Favorite lore is probably Wraith. Dude straight rips his bosses head off. Can relate.
---
Least favorite is Trapper. They are dicks to their maggots. Dick maggots if you will.
---
Your last paragraph is very confusing. Some people have to go away like firefighters for example. This is oddly specific and I'll have you know most firefighters have generous amounts of free time sitting around the base. I agree tho I earned those limited time cosmetics and giving them out to everyone makes me wonder why I should even participate in future events.
---
Hell I've played MMO's where ive done boss fights with less debuffs
---
Ya I remember back in the day we was pretty unfair how he could put traps right under hooked survivors so they could not be saved without setting off the trap lol
---
I mean, when the devs say the skin is "exclusive" they essentially lied. I feel bad for anyone who bought a skin under that false pretense. 
---
They even made free versions of most exclusives (dwearder to dweard) to make both code owners and non code owners happy. If they didnt intend to keep their word, the devs shouldnt have called their items exclusives
---
Ehh I turned off messages from everyone except friends because of those damn bots and because of that message virus that was happening
---
BBQ with huntress is fun just for that stuff. Trying to make God like shots
---
wtf? nerf crawl rate bhvr jfc
---
Is it bad if I expect the mobile version to be this way by default?
---
Thats the best thing about SC is that it works with stealth killers. Of course I usually run Dark Sense and when I pop a gen and don't see the killer I know its ghost, Michael or Wraith.
---
I swear people act as if they poured sweat and blood into getting it
---
Don't blame you. It might be worth trudging through the salt mines to find those rare, cool players but that takes the patience of a saint sometimes.
---
Gen rush and heals too lol.
---
Don't get me wrong, I do think all the nerfing is a load of crap. And now the spirit is being done the community will band together to get the next "unfair" killer nerfed. It's always going to be the case. I LOVE the spirit how she currently is but I can make the updates work.
---
Lmfao. Killt.
---
Lies *sadnoises*
---
“If you go out of your way to rush three gens while the fourth survivor is looping and baiting the killer, you’re a cunt. Plain and simple. Don’t “strategically distract” the killer so you can knock out three gens at the same time”. That’s the equivalent of what you’re saying. 
---
Survivors min-max all the time by gen rushing and running from safe loop to safe loop. Killers should be able to min-max by taking out one survivor as fast as possible to even the odds. 
---
Full disclosure, I’m a former killer main who plays more survivor now just for short queue lines. Slugging is cancer. True tunneling, where I just decide fuck you in particular is cancer. Playing killer to the most efficient strategy so I can win isn’t cancer.
---
I'm 200% sure it's a recent bug, because killers moving grass is printed on my neocortex, as well as Prayer Beads Spirit that can be seen by grass moving.
---
I’ve been to a firecamp I’ve actually worked at one for 2 weeks. About no TVs or anything there mate.... they basically sleep all day then go and work a fire for about 12 hours or more. 
---
My last paragraph is to just say that it sucks that some people miss it.
---
“Slightly harder”
---
The hex is high risk and high reward if killers could control the totem location then there would not be much risk unless all spots are bad
---
Ohh ok thanks man
---
Looking for Jane 👀👀👀
---
Variety? They have hundreds of cosmetics in the store.
---
There are free alternative looks to the exclusives. This isn't about variety
---
It's ironic. If you prestige, you get rid of all of em.
---
I mean, yeah, but at that rate they could just release an actual butthole for a skin and people would buy it for variety lol
---
Won't somebody PLEASE think of the firefighters!?
---
What do you do
---
Every now and then I'm messing around playing kinda memey as killer and then get a hate message, makes me feel like arya stark repeating the name to myself so I can play them properly if i see them in a lobby.
---
What do you mean?
---
So the ranking system might work, if people were actually matched with others around their rank.
---
&gt; thing about Thanataphobia
---
You're thinking about Thanataphobia as if it's making actions take 16% longer, when it really decreases action speed by 16%. BHVR often alternates between the two, which can make things very confusing. In reality (pretty sure, but with BHVR you can never tell), the total healing time would be 16/0.84, or 19.05 seconds - adding 3.05 seconds total. For reference, Sloppy Butcher decreases healing speed by 20%, which only adds 4 seconds, yet it's a meta perk. You have to take into account Self-Care, which doubles the amount of time wasted, and that even a Survivor being healed by another is wasting time as they have to sit there.
---
Though none of that really changes the fact that Ruin and Pop tend to be vastly better. But if Ruin gets cleansed quickly, Thanataphobia can potentially save more time than it (up to 76 seconds on gens alone, assuming none are kicked).
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; massive flaw of a Killers ability being tied to a particular add-on
---
Yeah that's why she's in the "*Maybe* Viable" tier, along with Huntress, whom people often talk up due to her Iridescent Hatchets. And you were just talking about how popular Video Tape was on Pig (cuts charge time of Ambush by 50% and miss cooldown by 25%). Killers in general rarely run without add-ons, and rely a lot on them. Hell, even Nurse needs an add-on now to get her third blink back.
---
[Otzdarva has a wonderful video displaying the power of the apples.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhs_5tM6l6A) Corrupt Intervention makes it hard to spread, and Infectious Fright + Whispers makes it impossible to hide.
---
&gt; thing you don't see about Legion
---
Something else about Legion, is that his tracking only works inside his terror radius. It also only gives you 10 seconds to run to the next Survivor, and takes 20 seconds to recharge. A Survivor only needs at least a 10m headstart for you to not be able to catch them in the duration, not even including obstacles. God forbid they have Spine Chill and know you're coming from 36m away.
---
Legion benefits a lot from Killer experience because he's a Killer. Every Killer benefits a lot from Killer experience. Also, pretty much everything you said applies to Wraith as well, except he takes 3 seconds to uncloak, 1.5 seconds to cloak and get the speed boost back (1% higher than Legion's Frenzy), can maintain the speed boost for an infinite duration, gets a sprint after uncloaking, has stealth, and can see scratch marks and blood.
---
&gt; Michaels 99'
---
Well yeah he can get looped, that's why he's at the bottom of Tier B. But so can Ghost Face, and Ghost Face doesn't have the extra vaulting speed and lunge range. And Michael has enough juice for 6 Tier IIIs; if the game has lasted that long, you've probably either already won or already lost.
---
Like I said, Ghost Face is the Killer Croquedead knows the least about. I do agree he should be higher, and one thing I didn't consider was that he can still stalk multiple people at once, and significantly faster at that. Though 99ing is harder because you have to wait for your power cooldown, and if you hit someone you lose all stalk progress on them.
---
&gt; you'll fake the dash to force the Survivor out of position
---
Croquedead made a good point that that only works if there isn't a window nearby, though if it's an open loop then there's not often going to be a window right there. 
---
Instead of replying earlier, I was bingeing Otzdarva, and I noticed his effective use of the moonwalking technique. It's something I admit I have yet to utilize myself, but it still is something that helps all Killers and not just the Pig.
---
&gt; but simply because there ain't many, it doesn't mean that the Killer is bad
---
He meant the opposite of that: that Pig was underestimated because she was difficult to use properly, like Hag. Which is why he had put her in A tier - not sure why he brought her all the way down to E tier.
---
Now that's old
---
She really wasnt that hard to loop. You just couldn't loop her the entire game like you could with the rest
---
*looks at the pig*
---
It's even better if you destroy the team.

---
Yea it some of those when I play survivor it’s frustrating that we outplayed the killer and didn’t find a hidden totem on the swamp somewhere and get downed but at the same time I do see the argument that don’t gen rush and do totems to neutralize it.
---
I've been having the same problem with Lithe where I jump through and sprint and get hit and teleport back to the window
---
CSGO, TF2, Dota 2, LoL, WoW, Runescape, Overwatch, etc.
---
People spend money like that on shit like this ALL THE TIME. Their justification? They want it. Not for you to decide that. That being said at least many of the high ticket items in other games are actually unique and not just a recolor of a base outfit item despite whatever metallic color they chose.
---
Yah. My friends where wondering what the hell I was doing.
---
That was an example I was quickly coming up with.
---
“omg u gei faccamper n slugsr i hop u die lol”
---
At the very least i think they should make it so that a survivor can't spawn right next to a Hex Totem.
---
Where is this at? I'm sure in places like California and Australia they stay busy. I'm work on an ambulance tho and the fire department in my town hasn't gotten a single call in the last 2 days I've been here lol. Why no TV? I bring my ps4 and tv to work with me.
---
But the advantage would still be there. Why not enable playing against ps4 player and have an easier match
---
Such as the tome 4 challenges.
---
BHVR are making the exlusives free to all so that they can stop this issue, People who bought shitty exclusives THAT THEY NEVER EARNED for $500.
---
You have A right to be mad IF you earned it.
---
I never say gg, not because I don't have sportmanship, but because true "good games" are very rare, and, even in that case,  people don't care about my personal opinion of the game quality (good, bad or whatever). When i truly enjoy a match, i type " \*handshake\*".
---
Last I checked you can only play 1 legionary at a time, and from what I see, most people play Frank or Joe.
---
Why do you have friends that lie to you?
---
Then it’s the ps4 users fault for leaving it on? As long as they have it opt out they would not be facing pc users
---
No it’s far from it, plus there are almost no pallets on that map. Also there is almost no place for balanced landing to be used.
---
That I can agree with lol
---
I thought the “Get 200,000 bloodpoints” was pretty annoying because it doesn’t factor in BBQ or and other BP offerings
---
Well when I play against her she always rotates faster than I can unhook. 
---
I wouldn't call it camping but once someones hooked she always seems to make it back before i can unhook
---
I meant that they would do generators in front of me because I can’t touch them
---
"all killers are the same"    " "demogorgon op"    "Freddy is now trash".  I'm just genuinely baffled.
---
My favorite is when they DC after getting downed once and they all joined the lobby at the same time.
---
That one was a pain in the ass I’d admit
---
Not a fire department, I’m talking about like the care fire example and at a firecamp, I could’ve specified that is my fault. 
---
The big fires where your offtime is sleeping in a tent or on the ground, sometimes they do that so it’s less gear to pack up. 
---
No tv because it’s 12 hour shift of fighting a fire and then going back to the camp to eat and sleep. 
---
I was at a multiple firecamps as a corpsmember in the California Conservation Corps. 
---
You could do research if it interests you.
---
Pc or console?
---
Not really. First of all, keys can be found In chests. Secondly, the only counter to items is franklins, and even with franklins they can still pick their items back up. It’s not as effective as you argue
---
Wow mapwide. Whats next hitboxes that lasts up to the next game?
---
How do you get it on mobile? I looked it up
---
Not really when compared to other games
---
You’d be a disadvantage if they died too? I don’t understand this mentality.
---
That's hilarious
---
People just get their PeePee hard because they got a skin that not everybody can get, it's a weird flex but ok kind of thing.
---
Never considered that people didn’t know, actually.
---
I mean yeah mobility is her focus. But she has no way of finding survivors so if you play stealthy she will phase away and you can hop back on gen. I played avknst a prestige 3 50 sprit with the blight skin. And all I had to do was play stealthy and predict her movements. Also iron will is a GODLY perk against her.
---
No not really it's dbd after all
---
I ended up stunning a Spirit 3 times mid-chase and got camped after I DS’ed her to get my 3rd blind
---
Holy cow it’s the real flaming kitty u mad? And he is still the one that’s mad?  
---
Today is a good day.
---
Or they just want us to buy battlepass levels because the tomes are the only decent way to get levels.
---
Don't think that's what he means.
---
Yep. Whenever I plau survivor with friends and they do gens too fast, I tell them to slow it down and look for totems.
---
My hunch on whether the killer has noed through playstyle and skill is correct 95% of the time, so I’ll usually do them.
---
Everytime someone deliberately use mori to tryhard instead of meme. I imagine them having the microest of the micropeni
---
We need music to it :D
---
&gt; if you had Haunted Grounds in the first slot it'll be placed first.
---
Which one of the two? Real or fake one?
---
No more like “ashy slashy this isn’t real go back”
---
All ranks mate.
---
Nah I was just curious where it was that fire actually worked haha.
---
If an injured survivor comes my way, best believe ima tap it.
---
I exclusively run Skill check doc as my main killer. I love how crazy those games get.
---
Unnerving, Distressing, Overcharge/Pop, and Huntress Lullaby.
---
&gt; the issue with the perk is that it's inconsistent
---
Which is why Leatherface and Wraith are in trash tier, though I don't know why Wraith is below Leatherface.
---
I actually thought Play With Your Food was trash until a few days ago, when I saw [Otzdarva's video on it](https://youtu.be/Fz4mLX_D5Zo). I had thought it was too much of a massive waste of time, but I didn't consider how much time it would save in chases. 
---
&gt; everyone thinks you're stupid
---
Amen to that: the moment I see it's a Leatherface my perception of their intelligence immediately drops.
---
I do think Leatherface should be lower simply because, even though he's the most effective at facecamping, it literally drains points from your emblems and ranking up simply isn't happening. Might be why I often see people picking Leatherface when they're trying to derank.
---
Also, two of his add-ons - the chili ones - do literally nothing, and this has been confirmed by the devs.
---
If he's talking about steam x windows then yes there's cross play
---
It works for totems, bear traps, fake pallets, and hag traps.
---
Its funny cause keys use to have an unlock time similar to exit gates
---
Play nurse for an extended amount of time until u forget what a pallet is then go back to a normal killer and witness how scary pallets dropped on u are
---
I can't remember what the rest of the perks were. I didn't save that part of the video.
---
It happened on PS4.
---
Doing it with friends, it's not very difficult to track down and keep track of 5 totems. Solo play, or with any randoms? Good fucking luck.
---
Look, if I see a survivor, I'm gonna hit a survivor. Not my fault if you ran a way that was easier to see.
---
This is me but replace 2015 with 2012
---
Quit crying about franklins we heard you the first 7 times
---
Probably if the gens don't go so fucking quickly I wouldn't have to equip ruin.
---
I play solo play quite a bit, it’s not too hard with small game at all.
---
I remember when I used to main Freddy. *Old* Freddy. I feel like a boomer.
---
Fuck mate Highschool went by too fast. 
---
It’s like childhood years are fucking slow. But once you hit Highschool and sometimes mid Highschool it goes by fast and then adulthood goes by fast as well. Satan.
---
Fools, Legion mains laugh at your petty fear of nerfs. We were born gutted, molded by it, we didnt taste an easy 4k until we were already a man
---
They noted that a lot of people lost their exclusive skins for no reason once their accounts got reset. There’s some people on here that had exclusive skins and lost them in a reset.
---
The situation got ridiculous because OP didn't M1 them. But he could kill at least one of them if he did.
---
But also it is ridiculous because of it's rarity. I never had situation like this in 2 years of playing this game
---
But yeah nevertheless I agree you shouldn't be able to open the hatch right under the killer's nose
---
How much?
---
Still didn’t get back my legacy Claudette from when I lost my save file during the first time a ridiculous amount of people lost theirs as well. .-.
---
I love how your arms stop going up once you realize she just downed someone 80(guesstimate) yards away.
---
That's the endgame collapse. After the timer runs out, which takes two minutes at minimum, all survivors that still remain in the game die.
---
I just got out of my SWF with Mcote, he said that the hitbox fix was supposed to go live today but a basement guardian Buba kept it in the basement chest
---
It’s a latency thing. It’s hard for me to explain, but survivor actions have a small delay to killers. So while you were there, the killer might’ve seen that you were closer. And since the game saw you were in lunge range to the killer, it counted. Also, you sure you weren’t right next to the window? Killers can swing through them.
---
50k for doing both
---
To be honest I played killer first and I bombed at it because I didn’t know you could upgrade characters so here’s my level 1 trapper ass playing again 2 rank 18 dwights, a rank 14 meg and a blendette whose rank I forgot. I didn’t kill anyone that game and I only got 5 hits off
---
It should be Dolta
---
*"Oh my god how dare these people decided to have fun in their own way and not have fun how I want to have"* ~ OP
---
The reports really can't be automated in this game. People send in way too many false reports when they are salty.
---
Gg pos
---
tbh even if he m1'd, they only need a few braincells to quickly pick up the key before he recovers from the m1 and they still escape easily
---
Just remember; Spirit bad, Key good :)
---
Don't know if you've heard yet but they are changing them so that instead of making no sound, the sound can be heard across the whole map
---
I would say that there’s nothing you can do and that new players gravitate toward Bubba, but that guy had a face equipped. He’s not new. He’s just a fucking asshole. At least when I play Bubba, I give people a chance before brutally butchering them.
---
I was in the running motion and fast vaulted the window, the killer even said on their screen they shouldn’t of hit me. It’s dedicated servers and I have had a solid internet connection too and so did the killer
---
Hex ruin is the most effective at the start of the game though, it prevents that first gen pop of multiple people on it if they miss the great skill checks it can still it infinitely.
---
Later in the game ruin still is helpful but its not as dire as the start.
---
Ohhhh you just helped a noob yeah thanks
---
When are these all dropping next week?
---
"What is looove ?~"
---
I do however think running it on Spirit and Nurse is cheap as f**k
---
NoTofu was playing a match of DbD while he said it if I remember correctl, thank you for all of the help!
---
Do people still think that it's her dad? how stupid are you guys?
---
also, this font is unreadable
---
"the next killer 18 akinto re-heating"
---
Some people think it’s the first Yamaoka, which is why the mask is center of attention and the first katana is gone
---
I prefer the killers to always play to win. It's a waste of time and boring when the killer lets us escape easily.
---
God how do you go through life being a debbie downer
---
I turned it down and it is still lagging i have a rtx 2080 with 16.0 GB of ram
---
Play however u want, dont give a shit about gameplay policing
---
Yeah. I partially understand giving them to console players but why give them to all PC players, some of whom didn’t grind the event to unlock the cosmetic? I know some might have not played the game back then but ...that’s the price of exclusivity? I would love to get that Victorious Janna skin in League of Legends that you were able to get if you were ranked Gold and above in Season 2. But...I didn’t play the game back then. Why should the value of the skin diminish for those who played back then just so I can get it now? I like the Huntress skin BUT I didn’t grind for it during that Lunar Revel event and I simply shouldn’t have it then.
---
BUT in all fairness I’m glad they’re doing something about code resellers/scammers. My point only specifically refers to event skins that you were able to grind for in game, not getting them through being at a tournament or buying them on a website. Though it also sucks for those who actually attended the tournaments.
---
I call it Window Ninja.
---
Definitely a more interesting idea being her ancestor rather than just her dad
---
"Guys, let's choose the same cosmetics so the killer won't be able to tunnel us!"
---
In the next mid chapter they have to rework moris and keys
---
I see what you mean but none of them where injured so m1 would just give them a speed boost to hatch.

BBQ stacks with a side of ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
Human race.NICE!
---
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
---
I’ve only ever made like 3 hatch plays in my entire time playing the game. I guess it’s because I’m usually solo or swf with one other person but even then it’s always our goal to get everyone out if we can. Keys aren’t the problem, it’s the selfish play style they promote that’s problematic.
---
Lore: Huntress it’s just sad and makes me feel kind of bad for her if i wasn’t getting hit across map by her hatchets
---
Gameplay: Doctor or Demogorgon one for stealth shutdown the other for shred
---
Surely the problem there is that is possible to easily loop bad killers for an entire game
---
Mob rule doesnt make you right
---
I’ve been wanting to run OoO too. I just gained the teachable. And I’ve tried it on kyf. I’m hoping to use it soon. Gonna prestige my bby Steve and hopefully give it a whirl (-: I’m glad you have in this toxic environment
---
Usually in my circumstances 2 people DC to give the last dude the hatch. In which case, nope, fuck them. They’re gonna abuse the hatch mechanics, I’m gonna abuse their chests with my hooks.
---
What exactly is that outfit combination
---
It does change, just on a different timescale I think. I make jokes with my friends all the time about how it looks like he's slicing his own neck with the key.
---
They went around the window after they got the bullshit hit lol
---
+1
---
How much Survivor do you play?
---
She's almost as strong as Nurse, but is much easier to play as. Plus, there is so little information players can use to potentially counterplay her that hits often feel unavoidable.
---
These changes make her harder to play, as Killers will now be dependent on either sound or prediction to land hits.
---
Also, "trend of Killer nerfs"? Look back at the game's history, Survivors have (rightly) received far more nerfs than Killers have.
---
Lmao wait why'd this get so many downvotes?
---
The DS user would be free to body block for other people to prevent that happening, or go straight from hook to gen even more fearlessly than they already do.
---
DOOOONG!
---
A 3v1 at the start of the game is too free. I always play nicer when that happens.
---
Don't know what to tell you, bud. Sometimes you just get outplayed, no reason to remove a whole portion of the game.
---
As much as they could give less of a fuck my biggest goals for the game is to buff or rework the mediocre or weak killers. 
---
And buff or rework the mediocre or weak perks. 
---
Just doing this would breathe more life into the game and make everything fun and interesting for everyone. 
---
New builds and maybe not meta builds but just good builds better builds for memes. More killers that can die well against Swf so they are absolutely playable in high rank etc.
---
Yesterday I was killer against 2 dc’s, I was Michael with tombstone so I killed one dude and let the other get the hatch, gotta get at least some points when my add ons are going to waste.
---
Now this is slug racing.
---
I don't, 3 gen hostage doc or 5 gen hostage Freddie. It's a close contest.
---
The second time I ever played killer (I’m a survivor main) I got a team on Neas who constantly flashlighted me and and tee bagged me. They also refused to do gens and just hid and when they saw me would just tee bag again and blind. Being super new to killer I was so frustrated with how toxic they were, so you bet your ass I tunneled the worst one and killed them. I never understood killer mains saying “toxic survivors” until then. I totally get it after that and it made me even more aware of not being toxic.
---
I see stuff like this all the time, even as a survivor.  It’s always super “fun” watching something like this go down with Empathy while you’re doing a gen and thinking “can’t wait til I have to unhook all three of you in approximately 30 seconds.”
---
PSA: unhooking someone at the beginning of the timer and unhooking them 2 seconds before struggle is identical.  You can afford to wait a few seconds for an actual save.
---
No...it’s definitely keys. 
---
The fact that a group of survivors can make the mistake of 3 genning themselves and escape thanks to a key, is completely unfair.
---
The Brazilian Claudette has already been sold for more than 2000$.
---
This is a hot clip
---
Not the way they did it tho. Only if they all rushed it together, but if they did OP could close the hatch before the one who dropped the key could escape. If lucky enough.
---
But it's really a very weird unlucky situation, it's so I would honestly just meme around
---
Wait what does this have to do with dbd? Lol
---
I just started playing a week ago before the rank reset, but I had watched some of my friends play for a while so I like to think I learned some basic manners from that. I don't face camp. I don't tunnel. I try to hook everyone equally because what I need right now is blood points for teachable perks. So, I'm playing Bubba because BBQ and Chili seems to be the way to go.
---
I've picked up on the fact that the tbagging flashlight survivors want me to chase them around the map, so I ignore them until the end. Then if they were jerks I'll try to ensure their death after the exit gates are open. If people were nice and I happen to down them, I'll usually just carry them to the exit so they can escape and thank everyone for the blood points. 
---
Then I do my best to be polite in the end chat. I can't do much about SWF groups who escape and tbag in the exit door,  other than point out that they managed to escape a rank 17 killer with 2 perk slots,zero teachables, and 8 hours of time played. Most people tone down the trash talk after that.

---
Keys absolutely suck 99% of the time, Unbreakable is easily counterable, SWF is countered via playing good and Dead Hard is so bugged that it can hardly be used. Coming from someone that plays both sides, so I don't have a problem with any of these things, and if You have a problem with DS - it most likely means that You tunnel people that are unhooked, otherwise You wouldn't face that problem.
---
I am rank 16 and the only Killers I have with all slots unlocked are Doctor, Trapper, Ghostface and Wraith and I have no teachables. I feel ya
---
Youd be surprised how many of those people have even less money than sense and still buy it.
---
And you don't have aura reading perks as a Survivor... same with Killer...
---
So both of you are stuck knowing where that last random is because you're trying to help each other. Also had a game where Killer was immensely frustrated so he had to hook me because he was getting tired of this. Alternatively sometimes I get pointed out why "my" friends left the SWF group except it was a solo queue on my side.
---
"Made by PC player" I got a bit hasty on the title there
---
nope
---
It made me never want to play killer again. I was so frustrated and did not have fun. I just started playing killer again thanks to the rift and now I’m enjoying it more...but with rank reset I’ll wait a little before I go back to killer..I feel like I’ll get bullied.

My idea 
---
Chapter: Ball Play.
---
Killer: The Player. 
---
Bio:
---
After all the years of torment, it was time for Payback. After the injury he purposely caused, it was time for that sweet vengeance. 
---
Survivor: Charles Marston 
---
Map: Abandoned Baseball stadium. 
---
Abilities;
---
• “Home Run!”: The Player can destroy pallets faster for 10 seconds. 
---
• “Pitch perfect”: The player gets the ability to throw a baseball which would stun the survivor it hits for 5 seconds. Max limit of balls: 5.
---
Killer perk: 
---
• ball play: it increases the number of balls by the perk’s level. 
---
Survivor perks-
---
• Awareness: The perk increases the aura of the killer for 5 seconds. 
---
• determination: even when in a downed state, the survivor can fix a generator. 
---
Mori: “Batter up!”: The player would break the survivor’s knees then swing the bat sideways with such force that it decapitates the survivor.
---
Rip
---
Thanks!
---
I try to play with more people but they end up being too busy, I wanna play with people who know what their doing and who don’t rage quit

All your drawings are adorable, keep it up❤

Getting downvoted from one post to the other LMAO get a fucking life dude maybe you wont cry about losing so much
---
Bill's picking himself up
---
Please yes
---
As said with a comment above, Try to ignore the toxic one(s) and try to play normally. If they BM you too much, you have the right to tunnel them as much as you like.
---
Gotta nerf claudette too since she goes invis with a small patch of grass /s.
---
The only thing I’d be worried about with the global phasing sound is that it might be abused by SWF with voice comms to tell the person being chased when she’s phasing
---
thank you for your help

---
The sarcasm in this post is palpable.
---
Keys are in place to give a survivor that last ditch effort to escape, similar to noed for the killer once all the gens are powered, not to mention 1/3 keys already being useless for escaping anyways. Maybe if the key itself had a use timer on it? Like the purple key takes 3-5 seconds to open a lock, and a pink key is the only insta unlock, or perhaps up to 2 seconds. This would also help with altruism because if the hatch has spawned and there's still at least 2 fully abled people in the game, using a key for 5 seconds gives people a chance to see you, including the killer meaning you have to be wary at all times. Alternatively make it so if the killer closed the hatch, keys could only open it after the EGC gets to halfway. Or, behaviour could really troll people, and give hatch "remember me" stacks, meaning it takes you however many stacks the killer has to open it, and the pink key could act like obsession or wakeup and it's not effected or even faster

You got it. Took me a while to figure that out myself.
---
The devs never lied. None of the codes were intended to be sold, and none of that money went to the devs. Many people lost their exclusives in glitches, and many people were scammed when buying these. bH could just sell these cosmetics for 10$ each in the store, but instead, they are giving them for free. The devs never asked anyone to buy the cosmetics, so it’s not their fault.

Alternatively, learn how to play against her

Oh, yea, probably!
---
Ok thx
---
Page 1001 in the survivors rule book for killers states that a killer MUST be kind to the survivors after one of of the survivors DC’s. Activities include letting the other survivors gen rush, pallet &amp; flashlight stuns,  giving them all the hatch. Teabagging is essential during this as a display of appreciation towards the killer for being so kind 
---
Healing allies isn't an objective, but it increases your chance of winning drastically, despite being time not spent on Generators. Bones are the exact same thing.
---
Also, if you're running the killer around bad enough that all four Survivors get killed by NoED, you were doing good enough that you could spend some time doing Bones.
---
I usually hit them like 80% of the time depending on what skill check I get and I only miss when I am not warmed up it sucks

“Mr. Madison, what you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.”
---
or, tldr, that person is a moron and has no good argument for you
---
I’m guessing they’ll invent a new character that’s related to the Yamaokas in some way. Maybe a samurai who killed or was killed by rin’s ancestor, or the boss who fired rin’s dad. A survivor who lived and died long before the others would be really cool, as it would suggest the entity was stomping around back then.
---
I don't understand this love affair with legacy skins, I mean, they really aren't anything special and if anything are detrimental to stealth in-game.

Inn' that literally what perks are supposed to do? On both sides?

Hatch rewards the Survivors for losing and they don't even need to use a perk for it.
---

Take a break, go outside, do some exercise, read the news, call your mom, see something new, cook something, reflect on the inherent duality of man, etc. 
---
If you're bored of the process it means you need to go do something else as to not waste your mind. Leave your comfort zone and get inspired so when you come back, the game will feel new again
---
(I know it's not the advice you came for, but hopefully it'll help you enjoy the game more later down the line)
---
As of right now, it feels inconsistent and good survivors can really deny the power. Even if you're peakeing a cornor and/or super immersed as ghostface. I would probably try to adjust the window you can spot him at by distance (the further away the more you have to adjust. And adjust how he collides woth survivors because if a survivor tries to look at them and they're too close, the camera won't reveal gf due to the survivor being in the way
---
just don’t open the locker..? or don’t tunnel? easy counters.
---
That has nothing to do with my username. I just don’t like religions due to no proof and he hypocrisy of it all. Like that one sick catholic joke we all know. Or the fact that they will be rude to anyone that’s different like gays.

Also I’m under Satanism which satanists under that are atheists lol.
---

---
I feel like this may be just a Killer DLC, similar to Ghostface or Bubba, but it wouldn’t surprise me if there was a survivor.
---
This may seem scripted but it was not, we we're farming with that Wraith and the thing just happened haha
---
I was playing ghostface, when a survivor saw me he immediately DC’d and the second one did the same, then I just killed the other 2 remaining.
---
It would be nice if they gave away Legacy but still gave some sort of reward to veteran players. Maybe something like 200 Auric Cells for every piece of Legacy clothing you acquired originally. That way it wouldn't be a total loss.
---
So don't tunnel, nerd.
---
Can you explain what happened to me this is the first I’ve heard of a golden feng

Honestly I choose the broken dedicated servers over the McDonald's wifi shitty laptop that we use to have for killers any day.
---
The thing is, they never SOLD them. They got no money out of making them, or giving them away, and never endorsed sales. This change literally only harms people who were getting them illegitimately.
---
I've got Daddy Jake (cos I like the skin) and I don't care that other people are going to get it.
---
Better yet, play trapper/hag. Stick down a trap and let the survivor ferment like a nice wine in their own fear
---
Lmao haha i'm LiTerAlLy cRyInG
---
do you really think that you counter DS by not activating it? then they'll have it as a free escape tool in the end-game.
---
you counter DS by eating it.
---
my friends playstyle is "lmao imma top heavy". which works scarily consistently
---
&gt;just don’t open the locker
---
Giving them a free escape
---
&gt;or don’t tunnel
---
Like it or not, the ds timer is way to long as you could down someone and hook them and by the time you find that survivor again they could still have ds. lso slugging isnt tunneling
---
Aim the puke to the right a little bit of what you're trying to hit.
---
Wait those things are exclusive?
---
It is not about tunneling, it is about allowing people to do uncounterabke shit:
---
say I got two people in the basement which should he game over.
---
One gets saved and gets inti a locker while the saviour runs off.
---
Now I have to give this person a free save because of a broken mechanic.
---
That's just dumb
---
On the survivors side I agree however as a killer main, who rarely plays spirit anyways, I'd much rather them buff pig or rework plague/ doctor because then that would give me more killers I can play without having to try hard whenever I want to play and not get destroyed.
---
It happens often, and usually I'm decent enough in a chase to bring the killer right to them.  I fucking hate people playing this way.
---
I do! I used it for a few days and my kills tanked because best michael is also high-viz michael. I guess that's the price a boi pays to look his best.
---
It's a long slog and people will still be jerks. It's a shame there's no kind of catch up mechanic for new players,  but we'll get there eventually.
---
Agreed. The perk is fine as an anti-tunnel perk but when people take it as 60 seconds of invincibility to do stupid plays like repair gens in your face or jump in lockers to bait grabs, the perk becomes so stupid.
---
please for the love of god, don't use "DH" for Hex: Devour Hope. Just say "Devour"
---
DH is for Dead Hard.
---
&gt; If a killer get ds-ed, it's their own fault now.
---
On paper, yes, but if someone gets off the hook they have a minute of actual immunity. So they can just sit on a generator while injured with no repercussion. DS wasn't nerfed, just changed, honestly. If you actually wanted to balance it, have it deactivate if someone gets on a gen, so it still punished tunneling but isn't just a free minute invincibility
---
Blasphemy you have to nerf every killer so people don’t play killer and you can complain about long queues
---
You just want your opinion validated. Looking at this entire thread, you refuse to listen to anyone that disagrees with you.
---
The vast majority of matches, even with slowdown perks, do not last 30-40 minutes. I use those perks. I've played against those perks. Matches usually last around 10-15 minutes.
---
What you're complaining about here is a non-issue.
---
I'm done here.
---
You had Franklin's perk
---
stealth is a boring playstyle anyway
---
Not this dead shit again, it wanst funny then and it isnt funny now
---
All they said (implied) was that they take away counterplay.
---
Lmao ‘betrayed’, these comments are so funny to read holy shit. You played the game to have some exclusivity over a few skins or because you liked it? Uninstall if you want (but we all know you’re still gonna play).
---
As much as I love the people I play SWF with, I hate the times when they complained about a killer getting a 4K, like get over it and move on.
---
All the event exclusive I earn in 2017-2018 were for no reason :(, I’m a console player so I’m talking about Chinese New Years and Summer BBQ.
---
$$$$$$ cash grab, plain and simple for BhVR
---
I guess it will be a female survivor prob also like adam who xame with spirit not an asian type. Without counting the stranger things dlc there was only 1 female survivor in the last 4 chapters. We will see.......
---
Because having to rely on guesses to counter a Killer was so fair and balanced /s
---
Bleeding all over the floor like a gusher is my new favorite sentence from this sub.
---
I don't know why you're being downvoted. That is a interesting change idea.
---
As someone who always gets a ping of 27ms on dedicated servers, I can say I never get bullshit hits tbh, EXCEPT hits after vaults and hits when I've Dead Harded. Those are absolutely aggravating and need fixing the most.
---
yeah, i'm afraid i'm gonna have to remove smth useful like adrenaline but its the price you pay for bp
---
Premonition is much better. Knowing from which direction the killer is coming is OP.
---
But they didnt die, they killed themselves or DC'ed, they shot the team in the foot basically
---
perk randomizing for survs actually sounds super fun, even for not farming
---
Eating DS isn’t really a counter since it accomplishes the point of the perk; wasting the killer’s time and preventing you from being hooked for a minute after you’ve already been hooked, which is, in many situations, tunneling. If anything eating it is more effective than using unnerving presence to make the skillcheck much harder, but at that point you need to have enough time and space to do so without the wasted time costing you something important.
---
Do bones, gens don't get done. Team sucks ass.
---
What’s worse, a survivor maybe escaping for free even though they’re losing, or the killer maybe getting 4 free kills even though they’re losing
---
Whats your build just now? Adrenaline can come in clutch but if you just want BP its probably not needed
---
What if calm spirit was buffed to help you overcome the panic of dropping items? Would make it alot more useful compared to not screaming. (Sorry if someone already said this, I'm too lazy to read all the comments :P)
---
Then chase the saviour DS can’t activate if you don’t chase the same survivor after an unhook if DS even activates it prob means your tunnelling
---
That was some toxic shit my guy
---
thing is i dont own those perks (they're michael myers' arent they?)
---
Lord 😂
---
Awesome haha. Feel like ridescant head for huntress should be on there too.
---
Thanks, exactly my point.
---
I even wouldn't mind it if you could DS after both your first hooks. I can play around that as a killer.
---
But DS shouls not be the star upgrade from Super Mario
---
Thanks. I know that it looks stupid, but there were many arguments about "DH being overpowered" where some people were talking about Dead Hard and some about Devour. I just want to limit confusion
---
Want to have fun and not get killed or camped, learn how to loop mate. You do that and you’re fine.
---
wven then his mallot magicly went through feng
---
You're welcome.  Flair checks out.
---
I hate this thought process, as it leads to slot of things being overlooked. The powers should be looked at from the point of view of if a person is good at using them, as discussed elsewhere no decent spirit relied on the collision so the same things people complained about are still present
---
As it stands after these nerfs spirit with stridor is just as strong as before while negating iron will completely which was the only real counterplay perk they had to stop being injured a complete death sentence
---
how to rotate text in ms paint
---
I think Satan and God are different from the religion tho. Like there are religions that tell you you'll get to hell if you are gay and there are key symbols of human worldview and it's interpretation, and I don't think gods and demons are concerned about gays too much - at least Greek and Roman gods certainly didn't. 
---
People are concerned about gays and they want some sort of undeniable proof that their concept is right or wrong. But yet again I don't think God and Satan themselves into this discussion. If anybody it's Satan who would like people hating each other over sexual orientation and stuff, but who I am to say for Satan right? So I won't say it, forget I did.
---
Do you play on console? It might be the frame drop that can come occasionally when NOED/devour applies the status effect to everyone.
---
OK, so the Golden Feng cosmetic was an exclusive cosmetic that was only available at an event in China, the way it was distributed was with Steam codes, now people who were unable to attend event and wanted that skin could go out into the market place and buy codes from people who had them.
---
Now people were charging ridiculous amounts of money for these codes and people were buying them. The problem is, is that you didn't know if you were getting scammed or not.
---
So imagine spending a large amount of money on an in-game cosmetic from a third party seller, then for a year or so later it gets released for free in-game from the actual devs. It's laughable really
---
Franklin's is a good counterplay. If somebody joins your lobby and has a key it's probably a good idea to take them out first. 
---
I don't think keys themselves should be removed. It is only really toxic when used in a SWF group. They should come up with constructive ideas to lower the effectiveness of keys like put in a timer or decrease the chance of getting one with Plunderers if it is really ruining the game that much for people.
---
How do you loop her when you have no idea where she is exactly?
---
My favorite is when the killer try hard after two one hit DCs
---
I do enjoy the game, but as a survivor
---
I'm only burned out on killer. Thanks for the advice though
---
Yes.  We play on PS4.
---
I have no problems. Just learn to loop the killer.

Not anymore since the End Game Collapse
---
As a killer main I agree
---
I only use is on a whole team of claudettes that a lot obviously SWF or This case rare occasion. Our if I have a challenge then I'll use it after a second hook
---
1) run decisive strike if tunneling is a big issue
---
2) try different survivor characters and builds to mix it up
---
3) play killer! you said you don't like it but it's so different than survivor that it'll feel like a fresh new game
---
4) make friends off discord and play with them. it's a lot less immersive when you can use voice chat to coordinate, but it is way easier and can be fun.
---
5) take a break from the game. come back in a few months and *the love will be back.*
---
The guy above is technically correct at best, the leg shards sort of glow but they intermittently did that anyway plus that's literally only the default skin all the rest hide it
---
In no way is it a reliable tell
---
From the creators of the ebony mori come the ebony totem
---
Thank you, OP. This is the most honest thing I've read regarding her changes. I can clap cheeks as the spirit without add ons, and I don't use collision to find survivors. I'm kinda gonna miss window meme'ing with her lack of vault animation, but it won't make much of a difference. +1
---
Thanks for reminding me that I’m in fact a smart boi

Before I starter using a timer, I can't recount the number of times sombody gets unhooked, I find them on the other side of the map doing a gen fully healed, down them and still got DS'd.
---
Your argument also falls apart when there are 2 survivors left.
---
If I don't camp the hook but go Pop on a gen or look for the other survivor, they save. I go looking dor them and onlu find one, what am I supposed to do when they get into a locker. Twiddle my thumbs for a minute?
---
I think "what is love" would fit better but this is also ok
---
I'm the same way. I'll hook everyone twice and walk to the other side of the map. Then at the end I'll hook one person and let the other 1-2 escape typically. Unless you start being a teabagging little bitch, then I show you that your not God's gift!
---
In all fairness he could have played it better. He literally had Franklins.
---
Stop with this argument, it doesn’t work. You acting like Killers don’t have a weapon to murder the Survivors.
---
Why do I feel this guy is a rank 21?
---
I usually walk away when they jump in locker, try snd bait them to leave it then get a free down and they are my slug.
---
Totally off topic but they should really update their tutorial, have them include multiple killers and survivors with a wide range of perks to use. Something like what Apex Legends did.
---
bo0b3? xD
---
Baby survivors get mad at the killer, big brain survivors get mad at shitty teammates.
---
i really want it to be rin's father, actually. lore-wise it makes sense and is really cool, and we also don't have a middle-aged adult male like that other that i can think of.
---
The “nerf” thing was just a joke, he’s trying to bring attention to a bug. Not really a meghead move
---
I don’t believe in god in the first place almost no satanists does and to be a satanist under Satanism is to go against religions and they’re beliefs. Especially the very negative one, to be a satanist you are free yourself and have choices to make you aren’t stuck under a choice just because you fear you are going to heaven or hell. 
---
And I’m not talking about free like mass murder or anything like that because that simply goes against Satanism, as a satanist you are to merely respect others and try to unlike religions in general. 
---
And then it goes into the whole multiple bible versions and each gets twisted and twisted. Some change in the years to change with how humanity is evolving which Christianity is the biggest one to due that. 
---
The whole Hail Satan thing is to just go against Christians and merely piss them off. Because even if you explain it differently religions will put propaganda against you and say you are under the devil. So why not be “under the devil”.
---
I can easily double pip almost every game in the yellow ranks and some in green too, but at some point people are just too good, so I just stopped caring about rank altogether
---
I can’t even get mad when I get killed with one of those lol he stalked the team forever and we had all day to do gens.
---
Welcome to DBD
---
I usually give the hatch after 1 DC. But that doesn't mean I won't play the game out normally. 
---
Sucks for the survivors, but I do try to give them a fair game, without tunelling and leave the hook after hooking...it's pretty hard to go for the unhook after a DC if the killer wants to guard it.
---
I always try and close hatch immediatly, f that noise
---
If you get a 4k by camping then the survivors are bad. And its just a meme about toxic survivors dont look too much into it. And he never said getting a 4k means he is good at the game.
---
most satisfying shots in the game
---
Oh right I forgot about that ugly bunch of pixels. God bless.
---
Franklin's was added... what in patch 1.7.0? or 1.6.0... whatever. Keys were added in 1.2.0. Keys existed longer than Franklin's.
---
So? It's a game bud. Literally no reason to care at this point.
---
I like discussion about things. Lol. But hey man we all have our own philosophy or our own way of looking at things. I don’t really care what you believe in as long as you’re a good person that’s all that matters to me. 
---
But if you are in anyway curious of what I’m rambling on about go ahead and pick up the Satanic Bible by Anton Lavey. 
---
If anything it would be a interesting read and something you could build more of how you believe off of that. 
---
If anything this was a nice conversation. Lol. 
---
Anyways if we are done then, have a good one mate!
---
New billy cosmetic, Billy run with a toothbrush yelling “BRUSH YOUR TEETH”
---
that only works for leatherface.
---
Good. I don't know why survivors think they should "like" facing someone trying to kill them.
---
I also really wanna get into killer, my biggest problem is like, whenever I get BP’s, I wanna spend em on survivor, I’m also stuck on which killer to play, I have the base people then bubba,Michael,Freddy,ghostface,demoG
---
&gt;you could just wait by the locker if u rly want that person
---
Effectively wasting your time which in turn gives survivors 60 seconds to complete a gen
---
&gt;where you can chase another survivor and then down them, and then find the original person and chase/down them in a minute, ur doing good enough that eating a ds shouldn’t really bother you.
---
Actually no, i hit someone as they unhhook, i catch up and down them abd hook them, thats about 30 seconds. At that point ds still has 30 seconds meaning they couldve healed by then and could be able to safely take hits, bodyblock, or simply escaoe through gates.
---
It also doesnt help that now perks like enduring no longer effect ds with it still being one of the best survivor perks
---
Im just glad we have dedicated servers now. Killers always having the lowest ping was a big issue. Hopefully fixing hitbox issues is next.
---
It was all based off connection, thus why the killer (the host) got priority. Now, whoever has the better connection to the server will probably get it.
---
Umbra! &lt;3
---
I like this new meme.
---
wait until the weird hit box in this game mess you up
---
Saw a youtube video doing this a few weeks ago
---
yea i know there are good killers out there, but majority of communiy is toxic, so i did nerfs in mind what toxic people would do with these very powerful things.
---
some toxic swf could just do 5 gens and rush the hatch, for free escape, even killer with franklins couldn't do much about it
---
You definitely have some point here, but I can't catch it because we aren't playing 1.2.0 in 2019
---
Yeah no problem mate, Fungoose on twitch can uh explain things and teach you how to play that’s his thing so I’d recommend checking him out. He’s a good guy. 
---
For example don’t camp pallets and run as close to the object as you can. Don’t make wide turns and make sure your body’s touching the thing basically. That small amount of time can really help. 
---
You can check out Ardethas YouTube critique videos that people send him so you can get a better idea as well.
---
2 people would be interesting. But I think all 4 is fine with your initial downside
---
No he’s not
---
Are you the trapper who let me live after 2 dcs yesterday?
---
I was hoping to see those old chestnuts. Don't forget to add "frustrating to play against" as if that isn't the point of a slowdown build
---
Hatch is fine since you can just easily slug but keys are stupid.
---
You use perks to counter survivor items. Franklin's counters all items, Lightborne counters flashlight blinds etc. It is a part of the game to utilize your perks.
---
Matches with an eboni mori are much rarer than game where someone brings a key that can open hatch though.... 
---
A change to ebony mori that might be fine would be 1 kill per gen completed. Imho keys are more of a problem though so they should change first. Either each survivor needs a key to escape or once the hatch was closed a key can't reopen it.
---
Why’s everyone obsessed with the lore It’s kinda weird, it’s just a game
---
Running perks that let me see my teammates' auras usually makes me want to DC. Do you know how many people react to being injured by hiding at the edge of the map?
---
Most people don't notice too and this is why Spinechill is way better but the music changes when killer is looking at you
---
Being an item, keys already have ways to counter them with perks and one killer power. Hatch is a fair mechanic so that the last survivor doesn't just auto-lose especially now that the killer can close the hatch. There is one aspect that I hate about the game when it comes to this now.
---
EGC has ruined so many aspects of the end game, it took away the 2 gen minimum requirement for hatch to spawn. It encourages the killer to always go slug heavy when 2 survivors are left if they want a 4k, not to mention how it butchered end game plays in general, and it always brings up the chance of a hatch no matter how good the killer performed. I feel like that is what brought out the complaints about hatch a little more than usual lately, with the only problem being solved about it is hatch stand-offs.
---
The entire design of the hatch is to give the last survivor, in rare cases survivors, a chance at escaping and with the achievements, items, and perks specifically designed for this mechanic I don't see how it can exactly change in a major way. I really don't see an issue with it's imbalance.
---
How I feel looking at my Huntress Hound mask
---
the PC versions are using dedicated servers, that is how they can cross play. Consoles do not currently have the dedicated servers and are currently only able to play internally with themselves.
---
please for the love of god dont say they need to buff hag.
---
she is fine where she is.
---
He's not undetectable. Its oblivious. Those statuses actually work differently. If you're going to cry about something, at least know what you're talking about.
---
Everyone sees the killer when they're within the range of the hook and the killer isn't in the undetectable state (Pig crouch, ghostface night shroud, Freddy, Wraith cloaked).
---
Every player can see every player, regardless of distance. Since the last update, whenever a stealth killer is undetectable, no survivor can see his/her aura for any reason, this includes kindred
---
completely neuters keys, literally makes a terrible change to moris that barely reduces its effectiveness and punishes survivors that are doing well.
---
both ideas are terrible
---
I want this I love this sound like a Scooby Doo killer I love cool idea
---
Truth!
---
It's a way of showing people that you've been with the game for awhile.
---
This has seriously become the most overused joke in the community.
---
It's even worse when survivor gets the hatch spawn and gets smug.
---
Got accused of camping when they kept unhooking before i could take 2 steps.
---
Like stop kamikaze unhooking and maybe I won't get both of you.
---
I hate that everyone said the nurse was "oh so dead" but she's still a super strong killer. This is gonna be the same exact thing. Changes that will make her more fair, just less annoying to deal with.
---
You are not allowed to die anytime soon, black metal Jeff!
---
with initial downside mori would be only hurting really mid game, you can't hook survivor early then tunnel them again to kill them, i think 2 is better
---
Shouldn't the designer who made this be credited?
---
Premonition used to be the call when there were 3 killers because knowing the direction they were coming from was advantageous.
---
Now, with all the 0 terror radius stealth killers, as well as spirit being meta, I'd say spine chill is better.
---
right, no way you could abuse that with trying to wiggle 3 times then not struggling
---
perfect thank you, just wanted to get the specifics of it from what I read.
---
lock opening animations would just hurt survivors that rush hatch in front of the killer really
---
I was in a game where all the other survivors DC’s. The killer brought me to the hatch. Sometimes you do find a nice guy.
---
I like the idea for the keys. Would be great if they actually needed to do a short Animation. I would even say let them do at least 2 hard skillchecks otherwise the key is lost. I dont think i like the idea for the mori only beeing usefull when the generator progress is 80 % done. 4 survivors alive 1 gen left thats a lost game for the killer. Im only useing moris after the second hook anyways. There is not really a difference between moriing a survivor or putting him on his 3rd hook. Maybe a few seconds faster for the killer but i dont think you can complain about that.
---
appreciate it thank you!
---
Freddy isn’t undetectable
---
Because fun is subjective, deal with it. I love how you act like slowdown builds are dirty yet survivors using items and perks to speed up their objective progress is fine.
---
i'm angery about the event cosmetics mainly, because goddammit i worked for that untamed donkey jacket.
---
i guess the benefit is that i'll get the normal donkey jacket and the pro-pain hammer
---
True XD
---
Yeah I've read about that stuff a bit. It's a performance act that I personally don't buy which I tell everybody who asks.
---
But yeah.
---
It was random and we kinda discussed some discussion stuff here, yeah.
---
but that 80% of gen progress was to neuter the killer's ability to hook survivor early then tunnel them for an easy kill
---
The hate train has to start anew somewhere, since we just left the Spirit station.
---
This could be rectified by making it so that the depip is only avoided if the survivor waited the entire duration of the hooking, obviously not by instantly offing yourself
---
Hatch has always been made as a last resort (my head canon is that it gives survivors hope, thus making them tastier to the entity), and ever since 2.7.0, it's never been a massive problem for killers. If you complain about the hatch, toughen up.
---
Complaining about keys, i understand that though.
---
Right?
---
I'm just curious who the next "op pls nerf" killer will be, will it go back to nurse, or will we see a new killer rise to the top even if they haven't been changed in months
---
If you get a 4k by doing XYZ you made the right plays and survivor complaining doesn't matter one iota.
---
They could make it so it only prevents depipping if you went the full time without wiggling and while struggling until death. EZ fix
---
I am ignoring everything else about this thread because this is my new favorite indult.
---
Playing against Spirit currently is like playing poker with 3 of your 5 cards visible to her. 
---
Sure, you can still bluff over those last 2 cards, and can still win the odd hand here and there, and if the spirit player is a bad poker player you can abuse that, but over a few hands, the disparity will be obvious.
---
Any half decent killer won't get looped all game, even as leatherface.  Just force pallets down then drop chase, eventually the dead-zones will mean you can get downs. And no you can't loop any spirit that has a brain, as they'll use their power. Guessing what the killer is doing isn't looping them, its a coin toss and mindlessly acting.  If you think Spirit isn't hard to loop, you must not have ever played an even half-decent one.
---
"Step" dad saw me using NOED
---
What if hatch only appeared either when all gens have been done or there is only one survivor is left?
---
* Max capacity is 2 by default.
---
* Already injured survivors cannot escape by themselves (Honing Stone effect)
---
* Trap spawn is centralized and never around the edges of the map.
---
These simple tweaks would be super easy to implement and would already make a massive difference.
---
Whenever I get annoying clicky survivors, I save them for last. A) because I take the wording of Save The Best For Last seriously, and B) because ever second of them clicking and chasing me is another second that someone isn’t doing generators. So it’s basically free pressure
---
They do, but you talked about not having the game downloaded so it might be useful.
---
The characters that came after the huntress (I think) was: 
---
The Shape (Michael Myers, able to stalk people to make himself stronger) 
---
The Hag (a wendigo/witch who can teleport)
---
the Doctor (CIA Doctor who shocks people to make them insane),
---
The Cannibal (leatherface, he just swings his chainsaw around, he’s the worst killer in the game imo)
---
The nightmare (Freddy Krueger, used to be terrible, got reworked into one of the best killers)
---
The pig (Amanda Young, able to crouch and conceal her terror radius, as well as place reverse bear traps on downed people)
---
The clown (fat clown able to throw bottles of tonic gas to slow people down
---
The spirit (Japanese ghost girl able to phase around, I would explain it but it’s complicated)
---
The legion (high school gang of 4 people, able to run fast, vault pallets and windows, chain hits to different people and apply the deep wounds status effect. Currently the second worst killer in the game)
---
The Plague (Babylonian priestess, able to puke on people and make them sick, forcing them to cleanse)
---
The Ghost Face (Ghostface, able to sneak and stalk people to be one shot)
---
The Demogorgon (Demogorgon, able to use a leap attack and place portals around the map)
---
&gt;So they can just sit on a generator while injured with no repercussion.
---
If you are that worried about that survivor then you can just slug them. DS as it stands is very balanced.
---
Next killer sonic?
---
It's so satisfying when this happens while playing trapper. Just quickly place a trap in front of the locker and let the fun begin!
---
This is cute! But yeah I started playing DBD not too long ago and I’ve already had my fair share of toxicity
---
I don’t understand upvotes at this point
---
Its like old school black ops all over again
---
I'd say pig just cause she gets me all the time. One second i'm doing a gen fine, and then BAM!!! She is right there and i'm like OhSHit!
---
Man, my experience is different then because just last night I got tunnel-mori'd twice in over an hour.
---
The problem is not killers really, it's just that survivors have become so efficient with running the killer and doing gens it's... kinda scary. The problem is: you touch survivors, you piss off 50% of the community. Remember when they (from what I remember) barely touched survivors and they got fucking *review bombed*?
---
Yeah I can understand the thinking to just not nerf survivors too much or buff killers too much.
---
And that is exactly why they need to fix the bug where some skins dont show the glow of the shards. On the base skin you stand there at the pallet staring at her and you are close enough and not moving it is pretty easy to tell when she starts phasing
---
Either we farming or I’m dying first hook no in between.
---
Ye
---
Please don't do that if you're playing against a tombstone. Just play pallets my man, the locker shit is just as annoying as people with DS jumping into lockers.
---
Rank reset brings out the potatiest, farmiest of survivor players.
---
Sure, unhook me infront of the killer while hurt, I wonder if he will down us both  or give me mercy because you are little piece of sh... and down to the ground we go.
---
Very true! And well good you didn’t do anything suicidal mate lol. 
---
Yeah thank you, It’ll be nice to see you again in the future lol. 
---
Have a good one mate!
---
Meant this https://youtu.be/1V7j3eWVsHw
---
But you messaged first
---
oh hell yeah buddy
---
fuck you it's funny.
---
For me it depends on *when* the DC is. If it is right at the start, I play nice, but if it is after that person's first hook, then there is no change in how I play
---
Tunnel can very often be a waste of time since the others can keep fixing gens. It's fine if you happen to find them again first, but if you see them get unhooked, it's unsportsmanlike and potentially stupid to not go after the rescuer instead.
---
I'll tell you why, as I started the game playing huntress and missing every hatchet, you dont care of pipping but you care to learn how to play the game and mechanics, for me huntress seemed op if I could land the hatchets so after practicing I got better at it and now I main her, you could say the same to a rank 20 nurse who will eventually get 4ks everygame in red ranks.
---
It's a good perk that has it's uses which I bring when I think it's needed and obviously OP used it for the same reason. So it's a bit of a far stretch to say that *nobody uses it*.
---
But you don't even really *need* Franklin's against people who have keys. For every four matches I see a key somebody escapes with it maybe in one match of those. But Franklin's is certainly useful to prevent hatch from being opened.
---
More than that. With Franklin's and STBFL there's a chance of you completely reverting the hatch situation in your favor.
---
That said, I also think BHVR should tweak a bit with keys and hatch opening stuff. But Franklin's is no joke, pal.
---
Then pull them from the locker and hook them. Nobody wants to be moried and the killer isn't owed that.
---
And the DS locker thing may be annoying but it is a good counter to being slugged.
---
I usually play solo at red ranks and its depressing. I run bond and I see my teammates play like rank 21
---
Yep. 1 in the chamber is completely fair.
---
I literally had a survivor a couple nights ago get mad at me cause I wasn’t using my own original build on ghostface. While he was running adrenaline and DS
---
Then make it so that if it’s a swf, the depip will only be avoided once the killer has been in your area, with no chasing for a large percentage of time (let’s say 80%). If the swf try to initiate a chase around the killer then it will be at the risk of them being hooked as well, and the depip being given
---
Or just heavily nerf all 3 of them so we can then see all 14 killers :)
---
He was hard tunneling,i even sandbagged him to stop a hit, he didn't even hit me and ran for the other survivor he was tunneling.Btw i was in his field of view.
---
Yeah but it’s still true
---
I'd be cool if those who got those cosmetics originally got some special version of them.
---
I got called a filthy tunneler for getting stacks for pwyf from my obsession..
---
this would be a terrible idea, 100% would be abused, but this makes me wonder what a zero tolerance community would look like. Like one report, boom suspended  
---
I know it would be abused and wouldn't work at all, but just to like see how people acted with a system like that
---
Yeah honestly don’t care I usually DC next and get to the next full game.
---
assuming ur going to even be at the hook when someone unhooks. not all of us play like pricks when they play killer bro. u can’t take the exactly perfect circumstances for the perk and call it op, when that’s not what happens the majority of the time. the person who unhooks could run u longer, as well as the person with ds. and yeah, what’s ur problem with someone escaping through the gates while ds is active? are they supposed to just stay? you are inherently playing wrong if you find ds to be this big of an issue. the reason it’s one of the best perks is because of people with ur logic.
---
i mean they can't finnish they off yealy now.
---
the situation when they find the survivor early, then hook them and tunnel them, is neutered as you said (lmao btw) 80% of gen progress is at least 64 seconds and thats when they immediately work on it.
---
so now minimal time to eleminate a survivor with mori is 64 + \~10 seconds of carrying a survivor to hook,
---
lets say \~20 seconds for other survivor to unhook one, competetent survivors will not unhook if killer is face camping so another \~10 seconds for killer to catch that survivor
---
whooping 104 seconds or 1:44 minutes, when earlier was \~60
---
It’s just constructive criticism to be discussed. There’s a lot of ways we can discuss improving the ranking system to make it more rewarding and balanced, and I just want to open up one potential path of evening up the system
---
Nah, I have 1800hours, dont have legacy, dont want it  + I dont want to see rank 20 noobs using it and bringing the level down.
---
If you have legacy it means something. Usually its very skilled players.. Gives respect :)
---
But this is the entire reason killer can see survivors in the lobby. This argument works for survivors but it makes no sense coming from killers, they get to see what items the survivors are bringing in and can counter them with perks and strategies.
---
Okay? So, basically the options are “both teams are bad” or “the survivors were bad and salty.”  Neither scenario makes the survivor players non-toxic, just that there’s a possibility both teams were toxic.  I don’t know why every single thread about toxic behavior on this reddit has to be filled with boring Whataboutism.  Toxic survivor behavior is not justified by toxic killer behavior.  Toxic killer behavior is not justified by toxic survivors.  Not every complaint/meme has to come with qualifications.  Toxic behavior is toxic behavior and arguing about how “maybe they were both toxic” just lets people justify continuing to act that way.
---
Then they drop you down inches from the hatch, stomp it close, shake their body "no" at you before hooking you and repeatedly stabbing you until the Entity pulls you up into it's cold, dark embrace.
---
Groovy
---
[am i a joke to you?](https://twitter.com/No0b3_tv/status/1192593194963197952)
---
I'm not sure I would see that in any instance or it would be rare. If you have four rank 1 SWF players who are on Discord or some other app its going to be really fucking hard to 4K them.
---
Its almost like its for survive with friends ;)
---
Ok, got it. I will save till then to check if it happens.
---
Well i mean if you unhook 2 seconds after i leave, am i just supposed to change targets to make you feel better? If your teammates suck at unhooking thats your problem not mine.
---
I mean it is more variety, the number of skins avaliable increases.
---
I want my bubba changes. Also when it comes into the doctor I swear to God him and the pig need a buff really badly
---
Wglf needs changes. Unhooking teammates and body blocking shouldn't be the only way to gain stacks. If you're stuck in a chase all game, no one gets the bonus.
---
Something like getting 20% extra for each gen completed while you're alive would be better.
---
We should make the killers less op by removing the ability to hit survivors
---
dang...so id get to stay in the game for a whole 45 seconds longer..after waiting 10+ minutes for a game...and alll just because i did a gen and the killer brought an offering. not even a perk. didnt even have to use an add on slot for it! just a single offering that is extremely common and appears in one form or another in almost every single bloodweb a killer gets. now THATS what i call a fair and balanced(and FUN) gaming experience
---
Oh no, yeah, I agree with you. I was just pointing out that they never actually said anything about removing keys or moris etc. Although to be devils advocate I do kinda hate the rare times I 3k before a single generator pops and someone who hid in a corner when their team was hung escapes. But that's mostly because I feel bad slugging the 3rd one down.
---
Not really, considering I main doc and there hasn't been much changed with him. Give some love to the other killers man.
---
It's a bs way to prevent being slugged. You're just abusing the fact that your're basically invulnerable for 60 seconds. Just try to loop the killer, they'll be more likely to pick you up when they down you and you may actually be able to use DS. As for Myers and tombstone, what if you're going for the achievement? Oh shucks, I sure got outplayed by this survivor who won't leave the locker, better luck next time I guess? Oh at least one person is doing it the next time? Darn, guess they're just better than me. It took me so many games to get that achievement, solely because 75% of players would just jump into a locker the instant I was close. Try to rely on actual mechanics to evade the killer, not playing like a bitch.
---
I actually made an entire post about the grind in the game, this was actually one of my suggestions to fix the grind a little, I really hope decs are planning go do something about the ridiculous grind in this game
---
I see way more matches with moris than keys
---
Yeah I know I didn’t wasn’t to offend anyone by picking controversial picks in some people’s eyes
---
"Yeah, I kinda have a spending problem"
---
Imagine being jerk, spending $450 for bunch of pixels instead of giving money to the charities... lol.
---
Yeah I think a lot of people just have the thought of “ruin is required” because they are low key not great killers. I had a super toxic SWF against me the other day I still got a 4K. No ruin and I played trapper. :) my build was agitation, pop, sloppy, and whispers.
---
Newest cosmetic for Myers: a single tear shines in the night on his mask as all the people run away from him when he just wants to admire their outfits. Sad boi Myers
---
I don't mind killers playing on like normal after dc's, but I've had a few that's literally after 1-2 dc's left a crawler so I can't get the hatch etc. That's gotta be real tryhard given the situation but idk.
---
But he has no map pressure
---
I'm sorry? Clown is just annoying. Definitely not overpowered in the slightest.
---
I assume you might mean The ultra rare pinky finger add-on that makes you exposed, for like 4 seconds I believe.
---
Oh and he has to hit you directly so yeah.
---
people who still complain about ds make me cringe. it’s literally not a problem the majority if the time if you play half decently. hypothetically, yes. you could hook the savior and then find and down the person you had hooked. but you can’t balance around the top of the perk, because the majority of the time that’s not what happens. the perk is fine, it suits its niche. if you truly see it as a problem, maybe consider changing ur playstyle before blaming everything else.
---
I made my case, I think.
---
Wow! You can get a second chance four whole times and ignore the rules of the game!
---
...wait a second this isn't nurse.
---
survivors literally pick up the item in a half a second animation where they reach the ground with their arm to pick it up, killers wipe their weapon from blood or just do something for 2 seconds.
---
So you saw the keys in there hands?
---
I find ruin useless because of how luck based it is, but i dont play at red ranks (and i recommend no one does either with how much of a tryhard hell that place is.)
---
The only times i'd actually run it is if relying on luck for a little bit more time is worth it, like tombstone tuft of hair myers.
---
Awesome
---
Dwight the snack
---
or we could just keep ds the way it is instead of nerfing it again
---
Especially after I was the only one who did gens, 99’d the gate and unhooked you with BT just get downed by NOED and you all run for the gate and tbag instead of trying to save me
---
Keys are godlike almost always. If it doesn't get hatch for you, someone else will pick it up and escape.
---
Sweaty SWFs are just naturally at a higher rank, so telling a rank 5 killer to just play better vs what are typically rank 5 survivors that decided to go full sweat, doesn't do anything.
---
"Just don't tunnel lol" stupid argument and I don't know why anyone with a brain still says this.
---
Not gonna lie, I will be playing this with my mates.
---
i never get mad if killers still kill when theyve got ultra rare add ons and we’ve had dc’s. mostly i just feel bad for them if they dont have a black ward
---
&gt; If you want to "progress your goal of killing them" then just eat the DS and rehook them. Nobody is stopping you from doing this besides you.
---
Ah, so lose the game because you spent an extra minute chasing someone? With the pacing of the game, a good 75% of the time I escape is because someone ran the killer for a minute, got downed, D-strikes, then ran for another minute.
---
&gt; The person hooked has no control over this.
---
Neither does the killer. If I hook walk five steps away, and they get saved, it makes zero logical sense to go for the healthy survivor. That's not 'tunneling', that's basic logic. DS 100% prevents tunneling, but do you know how many times I've downed and hooked one, sometimes two survivors only to get DSed by the third guy unrelated? That's not Tunnel prevention, that's free immunity, yknow?
---
I was very happy with the nerf tbh, I’m just glad they didn’t nerf her to the point of being completely useless. She seems like she’ll be a lot more fair now but not terrible!
---
You do know you also get punished if you hook people too fast right? I never tunnel and there’s times I get hit by DS because I down people too fast. If you don’t see a problem with DS in it’s current state, I really don’t know what to tell you. It’s a very annoying perk that rewards survivors for playing stupidly
---
I play killer. He had Franklin's. There was literally no reason for this to have happened if he just hit them normally when they all made a rush to the hatch. You can see keys in the lobby and you can see them in the game when you're chasing someone.
---
He was probably trying to get his daily done with 4 chainsaw hit but when situations like that come up you have to change your playstyle up a little bit to adapt to the situations in the game. He didn't. For some reason he went for the chainsaw hit instead. However I'm not sure this was the case. 4 gens done, 1 kill and entity displeased. Plus he's bubba. He might have been face camping the first dude he got on the hook. I'm not saying he did but there's a high probability that's what happened.
---
complaining about downvotes is basically just asking for more
---
When someone dcs early game i just let the killer hook me. Not even worth to try a 3v1 against a spirit, with 5 gens left
---
I prefer spine chill too. But I just wanted them to fit the look of the meme lol
---
All good points, Im just Putting My own perspective out there - Thanks for posting Your own too, I'll keep those in mind!
---
I like that the Spirit will have a vaulting animation now. Small detail, but that makes a big difference. I love playing as the Spirit!
---
Lol 5 seconds damn bro will you even get to use it ??
---
I try to give hatch when I can everyone gets a lot of bs in this game lol
---
Jane when she isn't injured sounds like Dwight, Jane when she is sounds like Steve.
---
Not exactly a "nerf." I removed the timer so that killers can't just wait it out.
---
male killer “DBDGoneGay” thank god !
---
I wish there were Myers challenges and other killers but obviously it has to be fair
---
I want an animation of this where the other survivors join in and then the killer joins in and completes the vibe
---
Wake up,heal -sandbag the obsession- and boom
---
Bustin Bustin Bustin Bustin Bustin Bustin Bustin Bustin
---
I still play normally even when they're just 3 because gen speeds are still too op and even with just 3, gens still just fly like crazy and some maps are too damn huge. 
---
I'll play nice when there's 1 or 2 gens left cuz at least I'm in control at that point. You play nice at the start and then suddenly all gens are done and you cant catch up and now you really have no choice but to be nice since they just steamrolled you regardless of the DC.
---
Unbreakable plus ds cannot be countered the survivor can literally just run you and no matter what you do either they get back up or ds you. DS by itself is fine and unbreakable by itself is fine but together it's definitely not
---
Both are bad, but the fact you seem to think that one person deserves a free win but another doesn't is extremely telling.
---
NoEd only results in a 4K if the Survivors are being overly altruistic. It's the Survivors fault that 1 down turns into a 4k 9 times out of 10...
---
it’s really simple bro, just don’t pick them up within a minute of hooking them lmao. I’m sure ur so good and get a 4k within the first minute every game, but maybe consider not just chasing the same person over and over again and you’ll see much less ds. as I said, if it’s really that much of a problem, take a look at ur own playstyle before u blame others.
---
ok but see here's the thing. many games have a system where if one side is completely raping the other side the losing side gets a bit of a bonus. an edge to help them turn the tide or at least slow the speed of their defeat. dbd literally does the exact same thing. survivors gen rush the killer in 4 minutes and what happens? they get their shit slapped with noed. killer is killing too fast? sucks bro ur finna get slapped with a fat ds. and anyways if youre doing as well as you say you are(which is what ds ruins right) then it doesn't even matter that you got ds'd. just like if survivors do incredibly well and stomp you noed wont help you. if you see a problem with ds in its current state i dont really know what to tell you. its a very stupid perk that rewards killers for playing hastily
---
Yeah when I'm killer and someone disconnects, I just want out of the game and into the next one so I'm just going to try and kill everyone, I'm not interested in farming I don't find farming fun.
---
Similarly when I'm survivor and someone DC's I just want out. I don't want to farm or meme around with the killer, I want to play the game.
---
Removing collision in phase is a really nice change though, the others are the icing on top
---
Another valid point, thank You for sharing! &lt;3
---
Top killer streamers get hit by at least one DS most games, even though they weren't tunneling... so it's not really an issue rare enough to disregard.
---
I'm not blaming anyone here, I'm simply making a suggestion that makes the game more fair for both sides.
---
 i used to do that xd
---
Yeah most times I just play to get the match over with, but if it ends up being a good match, I’ll give last survivor hatch
---
What people don't realise is that Ruin's effective because people will genuinely drop everything to find it. I've gotten to the point of just powering through it. I've genuinely had games where literally everyone but me is doing gens because of Ruin. It's a good way to actually keep track and focus on doing greats.
---
Yeah,I agree. Add some more objectives like clearing totems or completing 1 full gen state as well.
---
People DCing when you down them early is really odd. Like, you had two more hooks till you die. Don't you think you can play out the game and not screw over your team?
---
Already did this too haha. Keys are also hidden from killers in lobby
---
It's not as if it's 1v4, not 1v1. Survivors are the team side. If you have a bad team, you're supposed to lose.
---
At that point, it wasn't NoED that caused you to lose.
---
&gt;Darn, guess they're just better than me. It took me so many games to get that achievement, solely because 75% of players would just jump into a locker the instant I was close.
---
Well to be fair being able to insta mori somebody just by getting close to them, even if they've never been hooked doesn't take alot of talent either. They don't want to be mori'd so it's reasonable for them to do what they can to avoid this. Sure, it sucks for you if you're farming the achievement but achievements are earned, not handed out (unless you friend the survivor lobby before the trial).
---
&gt;Try to rely on actual mechanics to evade the killer, not playing like a bitch.
---
The lockers are there for a reason. The dev's made it so that the lockers can be used to avoid his mori, whether intentional or not it is a part of the game mechanics. Don't get upset with survivors utilizing the tools at their disposal. 
---
&gt;It's a bs way to prevent being slugged. You're just abusing the fact that your're basically invulnerable for 60 seconds
---
Don't tunnel. Go after a different survivor for the 60 seconds if you cannot slug them before they get to the locker. If you're really desparate for them then just camp the locker or eat the DS. You're not required to go after the survivor after they have been unhooked within 60 seconds. It is not a fun experience for the survivor to be downed right after they've been hooked and then slugged until their timer is up. It's perfectly reasonable for them to try to avoid this.
---
Not really?  The hatch should still open for last survivor etc.
---
But you know what sucks?  You’re playing a fairly evenly matched game, you’ve gotten several hooks, a kill or two, and survivors have been making gen progress.  You’re keeping an eye on the final gens... and suddenly the match ends because every survivor left through a looted key you never saw.
---
It doesn’t matter how rare that scenario is, that’s a *shitty* match.  And what about when you’re leveling a killer and don’t have Franklin’s yet, so you see a key but you can’t do shit about it?  You have to kill that survivor (“Tunneling trash”) and then one of the others might pick it up anyway.
---
Replace Keys with Lockpicks.  A channel with a skill check for every survivor still alive/takes longer based on how many survivors are still in the match.  Fairer, has counter play, and allows a skilled survivor to still utilize the mechanic while stopping bad survivors from lucking into an easy win.
---
The only one of these that makes sense is the being healed.  None of the others should count.  If I slug, hook you first and you get unhooked while Im getting the other slug, A. Im definitely going after the injured person infront of me B. Its right after unhook, so honestly it is a bit of a tunnel.  
---
For the lockers, if youre a smart DS player, you'll jump in a locker while being tunneled to force the killer to respect your perk.  Otherwise a good killer might leave you slugged until the timer runs out.  
---
As a killer, DS is extremely easy to play around, and I almost never get stunned.  As survivor, I feel like it's useless most of the time, so I don't even bother running it.  If you really wanted to balance it, the match would start without an obsession.
---
Fuck that entitlement. Welcome to the thunderdome mother fuckers I’m taking everyone to the basement
---
No. Not down, *hit*. I *hit* her with feral frenzy and they DCd. Like lmao what
---
But a 4 key game is just a nightmare.
---
Not really. At least it’s not any more accurate than a killer complaining about gen rush, keys, etc. 
---
At this point, it’s simply used to discredit any complaint a survivor may have, regardless of the validity.
---
top tier streamers are at high ranks, and usually get bullied by 4 man swfs. Incase u forgot, that’s not the majority of the playerbase. and most of the time, the streamers know they are about to get hit by it. they could avoid it, but they don’t.
---
This, I’ve encountered in my matches far more Survivors who are altruistic and immediately hatch a plan to rescue a survivor, when one comes over and starts an unhook, especially with a flashlight, it immediately turns into a game of everyone rushing to try and bombard me to desperately unhook a survivor when it’s no longer remotely worth it. They end up throwing the match because naturally I kill them all, there’s only so much back and forth they can do attempting to save the Hooked before I catch them.
---
Rushing killers as a group is a surefire way to fail, camping works when facing this ideology because they all fall right into your hands and the match ends in two minutes. I had one recently where I didn’t even intend to camp, I hooked a survivor, ran over to their generator and damaged it, when I came back someone was unhooking them and targeted the Hooked again, everyone came over and tried blocking the hook so I started stabbing them all, ended up downing two, hooked the struggling survivor, they DC’d out of spite, then I hooked the downed, took out the last survivor charging head on with a flashlight that kept missing me and they all DC’d completely to just throw a tantrum.
---
All that because I made two simple moves in a match and they all flocked right to me.
---
Rin the first survivor and killer
---
It’s relative to how long you’ve been alive so that makes sense lmao if you’re 10 years old, 5 years is half your life already
---
It’s hilarious reading this comment chain, you start out cocky and progressively shut up more as you realize how much of a clown you are.
---
Ima fuckin alcoholic call it what ya want call it but don’t put no extras on it.
---
Its a pretty common tactic. Usually employed by swf but in red ranks, people do it to help the last guy escape. Doesn't bother me. Just means i need to find the hatch fast. If there aee two DCs right at the start, I'd probably DC myself so I can find an actual game. Farming bp is kinda boring.
---
Yeah, cause that’s actually a test of skill, like Myers or hag’s ultra rares. But if you have almost the same amount of hatchets but you can insta down with them it’s just unbalanced.
---
Good huntresses running iri wouldn’t care about the restrictions on numbers tbh, because they only need one hatchet to secure a down most of the time
---
So another exclusive cosmetic... Which puts us back in the original situation haha.
---
If anything, give those who had the cosmetic before a special charm, it's small enough that nobody would truly notice or care.
---
no. its a nerf. because the killer CAN still just wait it out. because theyll do exactly what they do now. theyll slug the person and go find someone else. which still favors the killer. because the survivor is still in a position where they can do literally nothing for themself barring unbreakable. but now even if the killer gets lucky and finds someone else asap and downs them within 20 seconds and rushes back to you to immediately rehook you, you don't even have your one minute of protection. regardless of how many people bitch on reddit about ds, it is STILL a waste of a perk slot in a solid 60% of the games i play(and i always run it btw) this change would make it like literally every other survivor perk outside of the meta: a gimmick. a perk that forces you to run other perks to support it or it's not worth running. so yes. it is a nerf
---
This is how I act, even as killer. I just want to get into a normal game sooner, man

---
Wow thank god I wasn’t around
---
This is why I'm thankful for the dc punishment system going on soon. Less DC to be had.
---
Happens when gates open and when hatch closed. It's to stop survivors wasting the killers time.
---
idk what rank you play at, but any one whose been around for a while knows that no one sprints at an unopened hatch without good reason to. Either they have a key or they are waiting for someone else to leave/dc so they can get it. You don't let them touch the thing, and if you have the chance to get that crucial first hit on their way to it, you take it, because if they are running THROUGH you to get to the hatch, that hatch is about to open
---
So I’m kind of confused, did everybody get these cosmetics? I haven’t been able to play yet and I’m curious. Do we have to purchase/download them or are they already in our inventory?
---
Sorry, I thought NOED was against the Survivor’s Rulesbook for Killers? Was there an update where NOED is ok to use now? Will survivors stop bitching about it and stop spamming this reddit with “plz nerf NOED”. No? Didn’t think so. Also, very few people use NOED at the red ranks. Maybe you get hit by 9/10 times at the green ranks, but it’s not used by people who know how to play the game. Plus, NOED DOES have a counter. 
---
It’s so hard keeping up with all of these rules
---
If you don't get an early lead you'll lose. Survivors willingly throw themselves in front of the killer and get hook traded because they know hooks are useless unless it's your 3rd. Getting each survivor 2 hooked doesn't mean jack shit. 
---
That's 8 hooks total that didn't do anything meaningful until the very end where they're all threatened by death hook, but they've won at that point. At the very least have 1-2 people 2 hooked midway through the match rather than each guy being only 1 hooked.
---
Camping is the dumb play that makes you lose games. Tunneling can sometimes be the right play. Tbh it's probably almost always the right play if you don't care about survivor happiness and only care about yourself and getting a 4k.
---
Cause it wasn’t really his falut
---
I dont get why survivors bitch about BBQ, I legt had one person yell at me for using "such an op perk"
---
No, if anything you're giving the killer an easier game by not doing gens.
---
Play however the fuck you want. Don't care what anyone else thinks.
---
When I saw tome 4 had trapper-based stuff in it and tome 1 did too I assumed that they all did. That this chapter was about trapper and Claudette. I had a level 1 trapped and I dropped all my blood points from the harvest into him and got to 48.
---
Doing gens is toxic to people
---
they get stuck for a second or two
---
The only change on here I can agree with is the unhooking yourself part being removed.
---
Decisive is fine otherwise.
---
Asymmetry and randomness are two completely different elements: asymmetry makes balance hard to measure (like in R6 Siege) and randomness makes balance sometimes irrelevant (like in TCGs when someone scoops from a bad hand or someone draws a perfect hand) depending on the game. While both can technically exist in a competitive game (i.e. games that people compete in), games with random elements strong enough to win games by themselves are significantly less competitive (i.e. conducive to the sport of PvP competition) because you inherently have less ability to compete against an opponent that has a chance to randomly have an overwhelming advantage.
---
I don’t know what you mean by talking about the ranking system in DBD being more firm and competitive. While it could definitely be improved, it is very specific and strict at high ranks.
---
Comparing survivors to other survivors and judging them based on their performance in game is basically the same thing, so I don’t get your point there. Comparing killers to other killers makes killer ranking unnecessarily complicated given the differences between them. Having an individualized ranking for each killer would be better to better measure such differences.
---
I’m really slow here but want does communications mean? Like messaging? Can you still play the game?
---
You'll notice that you focused on the Roof getting fixed, and yet didn't mention the abuse of infinites getting fixed. Probably because it was whining about removal of infinites was so widespread, it's laughable to try and deny it. You honestly think that the same people who cried about one exploit didn't take it personally when their next unbeatable "tactic" was taken away? Don't kid yourself.
---
&gt; If I slug, hook you first and you get unhooked while Im getting the other slug, A. Im definitely going after the injured person infront of me B. Its right after unhook, so honestly it is a bit of a tunnel. 
---
The injured person had more than enough time to get away in that moment you went to get the other slug. Also, the unhooker should be trying to protect the injured guy regardless of DS or not.
---
&gt; For the lockers, if youre a smart DS player, you'll jump in a locker while being tunneled to force the killer to respect your perk. Otherwise a good killer might leave you slugged until the timer runs out. 
---
Yes, but it can also be used to force killers who AREN'T tunneling to respect your perk. That's what this suggestion attempts to solve.
---
What does POS PPB mean? Context: I was using the insidious build for letherface and was staying quiet above the basement in a small side room
---
Piece of shit and idk the wnd part lmao
---
Keys should require a successful skillcheck to open. That way, you cant open it in a chase if the killer is right behind you. Failing it/getting pulled off/getting hit makes you drop the key, and you have to pick it up to try again.
---
Moris should be after second hook. Killers still get their power fantasy, but it hardly affects the game. Also, add alternate moris to the store.
---
thanks
---
Haha really?! Oh man, I really am thankful for their constant efforts to balance the game. It’ll never be perfect but it’s better each year.

The deal with moris is you give up hook pressure and some time to remove somebody from the game. With keys, you just have to hold that L.

idk what to tell you bro. play less well? survivors get punished for doing their objective too quickly. the same happens to killers. sucks to suck bro.

Unfortunately I see this too. Even though I enjoy watching most of these streamers, seeing people preach their opinions of game mechanics like it's gospel is rather annoying.

Even worse when they cite these streamers like a source thinking it makes them credible.
---
The b stands for buckaroo

Yeah, I hope that there will not be any chance to. This is more like a warning than an advice, if you don't want to buy it, it's perfect! Save your currency for anything you need soon!
---
not to mention with literally NO incentive for playing those much harder games, people just stop playing. There is no "competitive dbd league" or ESPORT based on this game. No one is scouting for talent, and no one cares in general. You hit rank 1, two, three seasons in a row and just get sick of it. Its too much sweat and not enjoyable, and for what? So you find yourself dropping the game until rank reset, then you play till you hit that red rank 4 and then stop again, because you just don't want to deal with it all for nothing. If you got like, idfk, 100 Auric cells or some shit for hitting it in a season, then it would be worth. Or like, you have to reach it using a specific character to prestige them, or something. But as it stands its just not worth playing at those levels
---
You can clearly tell in this first video you mentioned that the spirit is phasing by looking at the red stain.
---
That's on Xbox's end though since you're using their system to chat to the people. I'm meaning more along the lines of that BHVR can't block your communication on consoles since you use the consoles chat feature which has its own set of rules and standards. Sorry about being unclear with what I meant
---
Depends on the map. Yamaoka's Estate is a freaking jungle. I think they broke it somewhere around this Spring, that's when reports of grass not moving started to appear
---
Well, as a console player I feel like they have to go out of their way to do it since there isn’t an in-game chat
---
To give some context - ace after getting a save on jake in game (comrad) hid inside these presumably unreachable spot in the wall - i could hit them there but i couldnt pick them up - jake decided to come out after a while but Ace (Ivar the boneless) decided it would be fun to grief me and her teammate Kate - who was just as suprised as i was - i already filed an official ticket and a report in game
---
Your comment is the equivalent of going against a very good top SWF at Rank 1 and losing and receiving the text “GG EZ”. Get good i guess?
---
I've been running intonation few survi6doing the same thing. Makes me laugh when I catch people doing it and they start running. Makes me think of Homer catching Bart doing something and then chasing him screaming "Why you little!!!!" Play however you like (without teabagging and staying after the gate is open and everyone else has left) and have fun. Too many people forget, it's just a damn video game

Did you know SC procs on T1 Myers if he reveals your aura?

Unsportsmanlike is a reportable offense and Tunneling isn’t reportable.

Imagine being a jerk and spending $20 on a video game instead of giving it to the charities... lol. See the problem with that logic?
---
And to even it out make Survivors unable to move. P E R F E C T L Y B A L A N C E D
---
Exactly. That’s what it’s supposed to be. It has a niche purpose that u won’t use the majority of the time, but it fits that purpose to a tee. It has a counter that can be done just by changing how u play. its literally the same as say, discordance. there’s no inherent counter to that, but you can play different by not stacking on gens. I don’t get why people can get mad about one of main skills of this gam, that being adapting. Every match is inherently supposed to be different. You have different maps with different windows that are open and shut in different games, many different perks, different items. You get different killers. It’s all about playing around the situation ur put in, not complaining because u don’t like it.
---
You're so salty lol
---
Spirit  with stridor? Uncounterable? Nothing wrong with that.
---
I'm scared now
---
Here we go. If anything Stridor actually makes it a bit harder to pin down a survivor since there’s a wider area of effect for the injured noises. If anything it’s just telling you that you’re close to an injured survivor, not on top of them. I use it sometimes when not using headphones.
---
No inappropriate language. I already learned the first time this system came out 'cause I do have a bit of a sailor's mouth and got suspended quickly. However, now I just send a GG and block anyone who sends anything mean spirited instead of engaging. I just saw I have 30 different reports on my profile. 25 for unsportsmanlike behavior and 5 for cheating, so I'm guessing after playing plenty of DBD, enough players called my GG unsportsmanlike. Given, I never had this many reports other than when I started playing this game
---
I'm pretty sure I remember getting yeeted by the server and losing my progress
---
Should probably remove the names from this post
---
Fifty fifty. And considering that Nurse has just been nerfed, I must disagree with you. It took better than two years for hag and trapper to get a minor quality of life buff in terms of trap setting speed. Spirit is just about a year old and getting nerfed. Freddy took two years to be brought to a viable state, and he was severely crippled almost immediately after his initial release. Keys still exist and so does decisive strike.  Meanwhile the one solid way killers have to get extra time is a GD hex perk.

Shred doesn't even work with instadowns like Haunted Grounds since it's not a basic attack...no idea what OP is on about.
---
The most efficient way is to complete the tome challenges, which offer Rift fragments, and then to play 10 minute games (the point at which you max XP).
---
I guess if someone wants to do the math they can, but a rough estimate if you're getting regular games would be about 1800 - 2000 XP an hour, with a 600 XP bonus per day (if you play both killer and survivor). The rift is 560000 XP. Of course, the tome challenges reduce this required XP.
---
Here comes the "DEAD 'ARD" (pronounced it with Tru3's voice)
---
...did you forget your sarcasm tag? Is this supposed to be satire making fun of what you think an entitled Killer main would say? Or are you legitimately this delusional and/or didn't actually read the dev notes?
---
I play Spirit quite a bit and was concerned about the upcoming rework, but—like just about every other Spirit player who has responded—these changes are mostly pretty reasonable. In particular, they made *literally not one single change* that effects her mind game potential, so that claim is utterly ludicrous.

The problem with the Internet is you can never be sure who's trolling and who's just an idiot...

How do you check how many reports you have?
---
Those are not their steam id's - i dont see the problem
---
2/3/4people escaping with 60/80/100% of of the objective done vs 4 dead with 33% of the objective done. fair comparison
---
You're Spirit, ROFL. Git gud and grow up.
---
You missed the point of my post. 
---
When I meant see her phasing, I meant see her HUSK glow. Not her body. Not a wave that lets her see her. Just an indication on her HUSK that she is INDEED PHASING.
---
you also said I should learn something other than pallet looping. Care to tell me what else a survivor can do? Either I’m the big dumb dumb here or you’re the one bc Survivors can only do gens and loops. Occasionally land the DS if they get tunneled. Survivor don’t have a sword or a knife to defend unless you pallet loop the killer.
---
Also, if you don’t mind teaching me how you quoted me? That would be excellent. Never knew that was a feature
---
I totally agree. She is the one killer I have prestiges. She is an absolute blast to play as. And challenging but entertaining to play against
---
Bring it.
---
Fools and their money are easily parted.
---
are u sure he wasn’t just glitched or something? lol
---
Means you’re better than survivors. Those survivors got outplayed and yet try to tel the killer how to play. It’s laughable
---
Question: wouldn't the survivor have enough time to pick up the key and get to the hatch before he recovered from his attack?
---
No way, your the first one to find this /s
---
Losing four gens with spirit
---
By the time he picks up the key he eats the second punch
---
I can't talk to my friends on Xbox via my headset or otherwise or anyone else for that matter including messaging. I can still play the game, but I worry that if I do, I'm just going to eventually have my profile banned. I was hesitant about buying this game 'cause I had read the playerbase will report you into oblivion and other players have lost their accounts in that manner.
---
Sorry, I didn’t realise this was about critiquing my gameplay, I’ll happily admit I’m a trash Spirit if it makes you feel good.
---
ok but it literally removes any chance at countering the spirit.
---
yes because jake was in the same spot - but came out of there - ace just did a few spins and came out and in to show how "smart" he was
---
*past
---
Ye, lets just rework Wraith for 200th time, change some numbers on something and pretend that we did a lot. Trapper? Pig? Doctor? What is this? They absolutely fine and dont need any changes to be done for 3 years
---
&gt;Yep, but blame on the idiots that save in the killers face. 
---
That isn't going to help that survivor.
---
&gt;Also lol @ "Remember who has DS and what they look like". That used to be a legit argument when only the Obsession could insta-DS. Now anyone can have it and use it immediately, and the Obsession aspect of the perk is meaningless, since the obsession doesn't even have DS guaranteed
---
Just remember who you have recently hooked and keep track of how much time has passed. If you're still not sure then slug them for a few more seconds. I play the game too and have never had too much difficulty dealing with DS. You just have to adapt.
---
&gt; guess the smart strategy is to either camp or slug everyone so I don't lose the game because of DS. 
---
If you absoultrly need to tunnel off of the hook to win a game then there is probably a much deeper issue with your technique. Explore other perk builds, different killers. DS doesn't ruin the game anymore.
---
Thats how I see it as well
---
okie, that’s fair. I just like to hope the best of people.
---
Can I have the template?
---
If you yourself admit you’re bad at spirit why do you think your opinion on balance specifically related to spirit is a good one to share?
---
(I don’t mean to attack you or be rude, I’m genuinely asking)
---
Just kinda grind as much as you can in the archives to get the rift fragments and try to keep your games at around 10 minutes long because you get rift fragments for a certain amount of XP. You earn about 1 XP per in-game second and then it caps off at around 10 in-game minutes.
---
It is interesting about the these shards - it is the first time I read today about it and I still have no idea what this is. I have to find some more info about.  It is really funny when you have 700+h in the game I still learn new things/super important ones/ just now ... One thing I really hate about this game ...
---
Hard to swallow pills:
---
All killers can be played effectively. Quit bitchin'.
---
It gave me the option to check my reputation once I went to investigate my suspension. It showed I had 8 commendations and 30 reports, so the bad heavily outweighed the good.
---
you also see kate on this picture - going inside the same spot
---
Infectious is great.
---
People think bubba isn’t viable at rank 1 and OP dbl pipped.
---
Lol youre just grasping at straws, dying to mention it yet you dont even really know if its a repost. “Oh well its still overused format so still shit” whateverdude
---
You're dumb lol
---
This is like the sixth time I’ve seen this same joke on this subreddit. All of them always feature Claudette, for some reason
---
1 gen left with 3 alive. You might get one more kill since you didn't have NOED. Moris you can immediately remove a survivor after one hook while keys need the game to be played out for a while for the hatch the even appear. 
---
If taking away keys means updating the requirements for a Mori then I'm all for it. But, they're not really comparable right now.. especially since you can see when a survivor has a key in the lobby while moris are "guessed" on the offering screen. 
---
I think this game you just got beat (even with ruin and sloppy, mind you) and the survivors just sped the game up.
---
The third eye is open they’ve ascended!
---
And for good perks
---
Template?
---
Have you ever played killer at red ranks? Survivors will either force you to eat it by being aggro right after an unhook, or will run unbreakable so slugging them is a waste of your time. I cannot count the number of times I've hooked one guy, chased another and hooked them, next person I find is the first person I hooked, now fully healed and on a gen, I down them fast and they still have ds. That's not tunneling, that's just bs. Saying lockers are there for a reason is ridiculous. They're made for hiding, not avoiding moris or forcing ds. If you honestly think Myers' tombstone is such a broken add-on I don't know what to say to you. The only time Judith's is viable is if you run fragrant tuft, and then it requires so much time they'll have 3-4 gens done, if not all of them, by the time you get ew3.
---
Keys and Mori and both annoying to fight, as they unbalance to the game. But since both killer and survivor get these things, 1 if you change 1 ulti would have to change the other. 2 if one gets removed the other should also get removed
---
I love that man.
---
 explain
---
You keep saying game sense but the only times you can tell if she is phasing if you walk away and see that her body isnt moving during a chase. 
---
Its not about game sense. Its an easy fix. 
---
Pressure wise, she can still continue to do so since her phase is not yet butchered (good). She can still run away and phase back for an unhook before either survivors get away. 
---
So, again, you said having 5k hours doesnt prove anything. You right sure. But I guess you have watched either of any of them. True is far from being the only good one here. Otz is either better if not the same. Otz plays more technically which True uses things that already exists and works successively.
---
Both Noob, Puppers and Monto have played the game and can loop killers for 3-4 gens if not all. They arent big dumb dumb people. They understand the game and how it works from 3 years of playing it. Undermining these youtubers isnt a good way to disprove me
---
Haha yeah, thats true. Maybe only if he's staring at a survivor on the hook while the final sacrifice animation goes off.
---
But then they’re out of character
---
wait... I dont understand what are you saying...
---
VIBE CHECK!
---
no you lose progress
---
I feel ya, I’m 80/20 killer sided, in my case I only play survivor with my friends. Being rank 18 survivor really discourages me from playing solo queue.
---
&gt; like Demogorgon,
---
????????
---
New Cosmetic Leaked?
---
Jumping into a locker when facing a Tombstone Myers is just plain cowardness and toxicity to me too. It's already really hard to get to T3, and it's even harder to close the gap, that if you get caught, you're just bad and/or the killer outplayed you. Stop being so desperate to escape and accept to lose.
---
" I havent seen anyone point this out yet " ..everyone is talking about it, memes about that masks in the front page
---
Meh. I'll just DC everytime it spawns survivors on my totem. Fix the game or I'll pick and choose. 😂😂🤷
---
"it really looked cool tbh and wasn't an issue imo"
---
Um, not being able to know if a killer is vaulting is a bit of an issue
---
Good. Ive been trying to get my 13 sacrifices and with the constant DCs im getting 1 or 2 a game..
---
Pretty sure too, just say it to all the analbeads spirits out there, and they'll laugh their ass off
---
You definitely lose progress, they're an idiot.
---
I mean, it's still true.
---
Survivors have a laundry list of things killers have to do if X happens and god help you if you don't.
---
Someone answer him I’m also confused
---
Well currently it’s just a game winning offering. Basically “I win” the second you bring it.
---
How can I get it?
---
Legion is fine, hes a strong killer in red ranks. Annoying AF and not fun for survivors but hes not weak. Spirit is OP and needs to be nerfed a little. I see no problem with prioritizing spirit nerf over other changes. Bubba has no map control but I see red rank killers use him and get 3 and 4 Ks all the time, hes just not OP like Billy or spirit or Nur..mmmwell not nurse anymore. Lol
---
Nice
---
I did the hook 2 survivors in the basement with agitation and 3 of them ended up DCing later. It didn't give me the completion so I would hope survivors aren't either.
---
Sounds like youre havin a tough go about things, how ya doin?
---
What perks are you expecting to see in your web?
---
No, it's just frustrating that people just post here making unnecessary work for mods. Ffs some random guy posts links to all the dipshits who cant utilize a simple feature of searching before posting. Be considerate to the community and use your brains
---
His chainsaw ability is pretty spooky, gotta watch out when he goes into stealth mode too.
---
If I ever see a toxic New (Neon cosmetics and obviously purple flashlight) I will go out of my way to Mori her if she is toxic, if she is just good. I wait to Mori. (Unless if there is an obsession, cause fuck no I am not eating that DS)
---
no but you could find it online by looking up glowing phantom im pretty sure
---
For me it's the year I graduated high school, that always feels like "only 2 years ago" (it's 14 years ago now)
---
you got all the perks. congrats
---
Do you have all of her available perks maxed out?
---
Are you fine with the game being designed to punish players doing too well? I definitely am not.
---
Oh ok I think I heard of that thanks
---
So what did you mean? Care to elaborate?
---
Even better though cause I main Legion
---
*Uh-oh*
---
Sorry Laurie.
---
* How in the world do you know that? Not every person that plays bubba is a camper, the video doesn't show him camping. And we didn't see the whole match, just the end of it. you're assuming he's guilty of something based on a stereotype. All we have is what is presented to us.  I can agree he had franklins and got greedy. But the hit animation is so long they defiantly would of had time to pick up the key and open hatch. even then he would have to hit them again and they would of escaped anyway.  And you don't know if all of them brought them. 2 could of been brought and 1 was found. hell even 1 could of been brought and 2 were found. OR 3 could of been brought, the guy that died could of dropped it and the one without one could of picked it up. WE DON'T KNOW THOUGH. You don't know enough about the match to make that deduction. You're just assuming he's a camper because bubba's the unofficial mascot for face campers. All in all he lost because he was ill equipped for the situation. My problem is the assumption of guilt and deserved it based on inconclusive evidence.
---
When the next patch drops, a list of the cosmetics they are releasing for free can be found here:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/103996/](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/103996/)
---
It could be norton and yes this is the only game i am having issues with
---
Legion beats people all the time. He should be deleted because his mechanic isnt fun for survivors at all though. Most would rather be shit on by an OP spirit than be annoyed to death by Legions shit mechanic.
---
Yeah I still try to control the match after one DC, but I'll make sure I don't sacrifice anyone and let them all live at the end. Down to 2 players and it's meme time
---
yea actually i am ok with that. because it's two sides and neither really likes being completely raped by the other. so they give us tools to help stop it. but of course a nurse player wouldnt have any problem with winning every game with little to no challenge
---
He had Franklins, so all he had to do was hamma slamma them.
---
Can you internally count to 60 while playing a video game because that's either bonkers or else I'm the weird one. And the rest of what you said is still implying that DS only happens in response to tunneling while ignoring the other dozens of scenarios that exists/I described etc etc, but yeah. No one said DS ruins the game, etc etc etc. My technique is leaving the hook after hooking so I will stop doing that when I play killer. I know I prefer to be camped and slugged more than tunneling. If you can't evade the killer after being unhooked, the problem is likely with your technique. I play the game too, and I've never had difficulty with being tunneled, you just have to adapt, etc.
---
Im not tryna argue or disagree with you or anything but if you just play the trial good enough you’ll naturally get your 4 stacks regardless lol
---
Ok thank you
---
And killers have a laundry list of things they will always complain about no matter what: gen rushing, SWFs, Totem placements, etc. Works both ways.
---
"You guys are getting saves?"
---
Saying "gg" after every game is just plain stupid (are you a parrot or something?) and sometimes can be even offesive.
---
Do I really need to explain that? The easiest example goes like this: one of my teammates DC's two minutes into the match, then another one attempts to unhook self and dies, then you slaughter the rest of us. Do you really think it was a good game for me? No, it fucking wasn't. Seeing "gg" after such a match like this feels like adding salt to injury (no pun intended).
---
As a Killer you clearly see if the game was fun for Survivors or not. And by "fun" people mostly understand "a lot of meaningful interactions" i.e. chases, hiding, sick saves. Note that I am not putting "escaping the trial" here, because escaping per se has little to do with a good game.
---
its so predictable when a killer has noed they play badly
---
Still it’s kinda scummy to call them out on their steam names
---
$20 is not too much like 450. Atleast I spend it on "video game" instead of stupid cosmetics ikr, you like flexing
---
I get more aggressive when people DC.
---
and halloween costume slong with it
---
Meanwhile I don't even have DS and am completely relying on the killer making an assumption.
---
I'm going to head on you into oblivion though.
---
Only someone quilty will feel bad - and if you are devious enough to ruin someones game when you are loosing - you deserve it anyway
---
Bold of you to assume I still play Nurse because of my flair, but ok. Have a nice day!
---
prayer beads is getting nerfed anyways
---
If only that map...
---
Its worse when they unhook you as the killer is chasing them
---
bold of you to pretend you wouldnt have changed it if you stopped playing her. you too mate argue with you another time.
---
I’d rather go against a sabo squad them a gen rush squad.
---
A video about this spot has been posted like a week ago
---
Okay, you named one survivor problem, and plenty Killer problems
---
That's what I did. First try, everyone had Spine Chill so I ended up waiting by the gates 'cause the match was a waste of my time. Second try, I got a grab in the first 30 seconds and basically just played super-chill for the rest of the match because I'd already achieved my objective... So I got a "gg ez" in post-chat. (At least it wasn't from the Meg I let live just to avoid being a tunneling asshole, but from some random player I barely had any interaction with.)
---
I fucking hate Survivors sometimes.
---
Spine chill is better than premonition, change my mind
---
Demo has a secret m3 ability where he kills everyone instantly
---
1 dc = go a bit easier, you're not a real killer here
---
2 dcs = okay just give it to em
---
Thats how I roll at least
---
The Nurse was a server-clearing machine since the game's official release, so a couple of years of waiting is not that impossible ;-)
---
Joker as Killer?
---
I'm sad this movie is like almost 20 years old now. I'm old. Cut my legs off and turn me into a walrus using my femurs as tusks.
---
Its because if they buffed a killer right now, even a weak one, the survivors would go fucking bananas and BHVR would get backlash lol. Everyone is too sensitive these days
---
i thought it was new to be honest
---
Honestly, I wait and see if survivors are expecting niceness. I've had survivors do their best after an early DC or death. If they run when they see me and don't attempt to do any farm signaling, I play as if the game was normal too.
---
Her* lol. Glad I’m not the only one wondering!
---
Had a survivor that every time I chased him he would run towards other survivors. First time or two could have been an accident but it was every time. He even looped them. Finally figured out he was trying to get me to go after them instead so he had to go. I normally play survivor and I hate it when a rando does that to save themself.
---
The picture looks amazing. Which TV ? I just bought a 43 inch 4k HDR Vizio but idk how I feel about it
---
Yeah. Normal one and untamed (CNY themed) one.
---
I actually don’t. I looked it up and I’m missing a few
---
Nope
---
I disagree
---
Freddy has the oblivious effect, not undetectable.
---
It looks awesome, but I’ve always wondered how the explanation of this goes. Do you explain the game to the teAcher? Like “ it’s from a game where a dude is trying to kill me while I desperately repair generators?”
---
They did say they were nerfing ghostface.
---
I don’t have borrowed time or the ones I bought through shrine of secrets. I was just wondering if this was a glitch.
---
I found mine. 3 cheating reports and 1 unsportsmanlike report. I say gg after most games, win or lose. You must be coming up against some shitty people. That sucks :(
---
I used to accidentally hit the “help and tutorials” button all the time when I was trying to hit “survive with friends” and sometimes even now when I’m trying to go to the archives. I always feel like it’s the game subconsciously telling me I need some extra help learning how to play, even though it’s been over a year lol.
---
Great lighting
---
But an Xbox
---
I’m down for this. I would actually start running it if this change was made, since it wouldn’t feel like a crutch anymore.
---
D/c in less than a minute

Blendette
---
Slug race
---
Nurse is still top tier. Anyone that tells you otherwise is bad at Nurse.
---
That's not a qol change. It's a straight buff.
---
You ignore quite literally every single killer change in the game other than the Freddy rework and trap buffs.
---
Not saying the changes weren't needed, but come on:
---
Bloodlust, pallet vaccuum removal, global pallet reduction, medium vaults, exhaustion, removal of every basic infinite, general better totem placement, wraith buffs, etc.
---
honestly this screams of voice dub.
---
Borrowed Time requires that you level up Bill to get the teachable - have you done that?
---
Think of it this way: the more people playing survivor the faster the killer queues.
---
Different idea for D strike
---
It lasts 10/20/30 seconds but automatically turns off if someone else’s D strike activated, the timer doesn’t go down in killers terror radius unless your in a locker and it doesn’t go down when your in the dying state no matter what unless as I stated before another survivor gets theirs active so only 1 can be active at a time.
---
For how slow is vaulting, not really
---
Lol legion is fine no need to bulldog legion players... You don’t see people complaining about him too much and you made a poor joke, so shut up plz
---
What’s the punishment?
---
I did that yesterday and the 4th guy got the hatch. He called me a POS. If you have a mori, your skills instantly decrease from 100 to 0 and it also means you can’t get kills without it (at least that’s what survivors think).
---
Thanks. Makes me feel a little better. All the DCs are making me not want to play. Maybe i need a break... shits so stressful and toxic..
---
Conversely, if you get mori'd in 3 minutes, you can say fuck it and just go queue up again and instant pop as survivor.  
---
If you run around like an asshole for 10 minutes as the killer, think the game is winding down and you have your last 3 gens on lock and can maybe pull out a few sacs, then suddenly the game boots you to the score screen cause the 3 survivors all jumped out the hatch on the other side of the map and you get to go sit in your 15 min queue again.  
---
I'd rather be the survivor in that scenario lol
---

---
Just don't bother messaging people man, it's always more trouble than it's worth
---
Try to complete all the challenges
---
Spirit is the problem, if I can't literally loop a killer with my eyes closed they need to nerf that killer.
---
Survivor Skills ftw
---
Yah I dress up as that off brand Pennywise for Halloween you seen the picture the morph suit as a joke
---
Tho was it hex ?
---
So many trappers cause of tome.
---
? You mean reply with 3 huge fallacy which I'm not interested to dive in? Yeah, I won't waste time with that and explain to him which he used 
---
Plus.. who TF are you? Or you're just an edgy kid who wanted to reply calling me a clown without any reasoning?
---
The best solution to moris is removing the offering and giving moris to any 3rd hook survior
---
Remember guys the devs support disconnecting
---
I still think Nurse is #1, but you are right about the rest. Tru3’s way of playing Ghostface is very fun and effective. I used to hate playing as Ghostface but now he’s my fave
---
What do you mean "voice dub"? Like I recorded the voice separately? Cause if that's the case, I can assure you that I do NOT have the patience to rewatch and do commentary over a video while just sitting there not playing it
---
Basically the same. The moment I don't feel pressured anymore I stop sweating it. Might as well do everything possible to give survivors a reason for rescues to get more hook BPs, means target switching, leaving a hook, etc.
---
I’d rather depip and let the Entity starve than leave Bubba unfed.
---
That’s not a katana
---
Look here you entitled killer main, keys are a Good item, more to the bad side because you will rarely get them, and the amount of matches they are actually useful is about 1 every 50,and all of those survivors would have escaped if they wanted, they just decided to waste their key/milky glass, you obviously never tried to use a key in this game, down vote me to hell reddit, but atleast read what I wrote before doing it
---
I love this image
---
Spine chill would've looked better
---
Dude he is so much fun. Tru3’s build is soo effective.
---
Also if I didn’t mention: Need BHVR to add it to all killer passives to find survivors within a 6m range. New update frigged with the game. Hard to hear survivors move grass, moan, etc.
---
Yessir! I am a survivor main, but like playing killer every now and again. I have been playing her with no perks or add-ons (cause I'm dumping all my points in unlocking all survivor teachables,) and I have a lot of fun with her!!!
---
yes that's the pick up animation.
---
Presumably... by daylight 😎
---
I read the meme as in the survivors are becoming killers now
---
Imagine crying about bubba, what a clown
---
Awesome. We get any of the cosmetics?
---
I myself, only have Demo and Legion, and played Freddy and bubba once with a splinter add-on... I would love to play Michael, because he is so fun and has nice perks, bubba for the memes, and the demogorgon.. aiaiai... level him up with different perks bc his suck... Freddy is also kinda fun...
---
Also a thing to note, is that you probably have killer rank 20 since you don’t play killer... I would just play a match survivor, use the bloodpoints, I prefer Myers, and play him! You already mastered survivor so you probably know how to mindgame
---
Also you could try all killers, and see who you like and play maybe 2 or 3! Also, killers most of the time have longer matchmaking AND you can come across toxic people 4-player SWF *cough cough*
---
Exposed cancelling your stuggle and killing you doesn't make it OP, it's a bug.
---
Had to put my messages in private after receiving 3 messages from survivors calling me all kind of names and insults a n 1 message from the one survivor calling me a noob and telling me to lern how to play killer, after i gave him the hatch. All 4 messages after the same game
---
I was unintentionally singing billie jean as this happened. It was a bit short tho
---
I still think about 2004 like that. News flash, it never stops.
---
Yeah, I basically never play Trapper—only recently leveled him enough to even have all perk slots—so it took me a couple tries to get that challenge, but I was amazed by how well it went when I finally did. Once you have one Survivor hooked in a well-trapped basement, it's like a domino effect. I ended up with what could've been an easy 3K—*after* getting gen rushed and nearly all gens being done before my first hook (if I hadn't been nice and let one go because he started the dominoes falling and I was just doing a challenge). Though some of that was potatoey Survivors—Ace, I barely had time to stand up from setting that trap before you jumped into it from behind me, WTF did you think you were doing?
---
I'd feel bad for you if you didn't have franklies equipped and atleast just M1'd the Claud or Nea lol
---
hey wassup! i too am looking for more people to play with, my swf group are all kinda of and on players (so me too bc of that) so i dont get to play as often as i like! if u interested send me a pm and ill answer it when i get home from work! ill put my discord in there and from the looks of it a few guys already gonna play some tonight!
---
Im not trying to start shit, but can we stop saying Tru3 invented the build for gf? I ran the build before he even used it. Not a big deal, it's just weird.
---
Anyway. My top 3:
---
Nurse, Spirit, Pallet Freddy and Billy for 4th.
---
I like pallet freddy more than snare. (I know it's debatable, it's my opinion)
---
Spirit is still strong, the nerfs were w/e imo. 
---
Billy is Billy. Great map pressure and insta down. 
---
Nurse is Nurse.
---
Again, not starting a fight, I like tru3 (to an extent, his ego bothers me). And those are my top 3 with honorable 4th
---
How is Ghost Face top 3 when Billy exists ?
---
I'm aware it's not OP.  It's not easy talking about bugs without the post getting removed.
---
so then everyone has been lying great
---
Rip, but ewwww level 1 whispers?
---
I love that strat. I will have to try that next time! Thank you
---
Oh yeah i know what you mean :)
---
Nurse still reigns supreme on the killer tier list. The recent nerf didn’t change the fact that she ignores any and all obstacles in her way, an ability that is simply unrivaled as of now.
---
Spirit still holds strong in second place. The “nerf” really didn’t touch her base power much, instead it reworked some of the more unfair aspects of her power, making her more enjoyable to play against while letting her maintain her ability to absolutely dumpster some survivors.
---
Freddy comes up in third for me, maybe a controversial pick for some. Freddy comes up so high on the list because of the sheer number of tools in his kit. His teleport gives him incredible mobility on a respectable cooldown, his snares/pallets give him the ability to end loops effortlessly, and the slight glow survivors give off when asleep even adds a tiny bit of tracking potential if you have keen eyes. All this adds up to one pretty solid killer, however there is one more aspect of his kit that elevates him a bit higher, and that’s his absolutely insane slowdown potential. Freddy has the strongest gen slowdown potential in the game, able to slow gens to a screeching halt nearly effortlessly. All in all, an absolute force to be reckoned with, arguably on the level of spirit, if not right below her.
---
Honorable mention: honorable mention: Billy Boy. The OG instadown man, an unstoppable pain train in well experienced hands, Billy can make for a rough survivor match if the killer player can use his kit effectively.
---
Hopefully not.
---
Ok, i guess i will not play for a bit maybe Behaviour sees something
---
Keys are a broken mechanic, but I don't see survivors asking for a nerf. Instead, they mock the guy who recorded because he didn't notice that all of them had keys. This community sucks.
---
Have ever heard of crows
---
Every time I’m playing against a face-camper my teammates always hang around the hook just hiding and not doing anything productive. It’s like no one knows that by doing so they’re helping the killer by not denying his blood points. And idk if it’s just my rank, but I usually hover around 10 or 11 so I feel like people there should know what’s going on
---
No it did not. 
---
The 4th sadly DC’ed on purpose as I was going to let him get hatch. It made the sound for him
---
Reminds me of Mad Clown from Super Punch-Out.
---
I haven’t actually, I like Huntress and Myers too much. I play Spirit often too but she isn’t as much fun. I think Freddy will be my next purchase, I think there is a sale coming up for Black Friday so will get him then.
---
Why would you play on Controller? plus Billy on Controller is still almost as good.
---
Yes I am a bad nurse. Specifically I am bad at the nerf nurse. I was adequate to good at pre need nurse with no addons except form the blink fatigue cool down. The nerf to nurse has directly impacted my ability to play her well at red and purple ranks. Because of the blink charge refresh she is now actually slower than a 115 killer, directly impacting her ability to put pressure across the entire map. An intense chase game is only part of the formula, because map pressure is just as important against the three survivors you’re not chasing. 
---
I would actually now put Billy as superior to nurse in map pressure and only very slightly behind her in chase ability. For all practical purposes I would consider them roughly the same
---
This comment is 👌
---
The very same reasons why I love those killers and think they are on the top! :)
---
I probably play her more than most. Arguably a Hag main. She's the only killer that I can have 2 games in a row where survivors don't get a gen done. You have to be super disciplined to not chase iutside of your territory and know the maps extrenely well.
---
Made me smile
---
Do you know what is a console ?
---
This is a good point about video games in general—someone out there is always better so gotta get used to losing sometimes.
---
skill checks are just vibe checks
---
No, it doesn't. Moris are for the power fantasy. Not to give killers an advantage.
---
I try to explain the farming or going easy as people who confuse the game mechanics and game goal. The goal of the game is simple: compete, win or lose, have fun. If you expect farming or other rules during dcs, events, party streamers etc., that is you adding a new mechanic.
---
I don’t think it’s your connection I have atleast one silent dc a game though I’ve never seen 3 at once but when I do play survivor I get booted every now and then
---
Literally the only problem with hatch is when you have a beautiful 3gen setup in the end game and the 3 last survivors just houdini out with a key. I feel like both keys and moris need the instaheal treatment asap.
---
If we didn't have it at all, the survivor experience would be considerably worse, and the EGC update already put the late game scenario with 1 survivor left in the killer's favor (as it should be).
---
I knew he would get added to dead by daylight
---
A lot more than moris
---
For sure do! He is just a good killer to juggle with and apply constant passive map pressure with your teleportation. People don’t know this much but I sometimes teleport to a nearby gen, throw off the person I am chasing and then hit them outta nowhere since the dream lullaby is not directional. If you wanna have fun games, highly recommend Freddy. Also, I wish I could use Myers. He’s at times too loopable at high tier games
---
Yeah, I only enjoy outplaying spirit after all. That bait is so god like that the haddonfield infinite is a joke compared to that
---
..god damn you people..
---
I’ve never had problems finding survivors against swf.  Sure they can coordinate to try and lengthen the chase but I’ve learned myself how to counter those by changing my play style.
---
It was found in the family yakamoa files
---
Agreed, I play survivor and killer, and have only had a few instances as a killer where someone has actually escaped using a key. As a survivor, I rarely bring keys to a game unless I'm playing SWF and someone brings a map. I've probably used about 5 keys total
---
Slenderman himself probably not but I can definitely see a killer being inspired by him
---
Wow that’s actually the first time I ever seen a key play work. When I play survivor and bring them my boyfriend and I almost always die with it and lose it. They should definitely make it where hatch can only be opened twice by key, kind of like how they have a vault limit for windows and such.
---
Yeah no. If 3 out of 4 dc I'll let the last one go. But the one DC expectation can eat my ass.
---
The one change I'm disappointed by is nerfing the amulet into the ground. That was her best add-on (that you could run without being an asshole, I mean). It's purple, it should be strong—if the numbers need to be nudged down a little, cool; but they didn't do that, they nerfed it into the ground, to the point it sounds almost detrimental. That was my favorite add-on to run and after the rework, there will be no reason to ever run it again. It's like they turned it into a meme add-on or something.
---
I think all the other changes are good/neutral and nerfing one very rare add-on won't effect me much, since it's not like you get to run purples regularly, so it's not a big deal. But that one change is definitely disappointing.
---
I never said it was balanced. I just think the idea of needing to 2 hook them all especially with an ebony mori will make the offering ultimately useless.
---
I'm all for reworks of things, but if the goal is to just destroy it and make it a joke to even use, why bother then.
---
agreed
---
Yup and a salute to you for that. Its extremely hard to play her. You have to be sweaty regardless of circumstances to play her unlike while playing the other top tier killers. Knowing the map, knowing when to quit chases and time things is harder than people think. If someone lacks those, they can’t play Hag for sure! I definitely recommend sharing gameplay on youtube, twitch and here of hag plays so ppl get inspired.
---
Inb4 this encourages p3 blendettes to hide in a bush in the corner of the map until the cooldown is over thus adding no value for the team
---
Well... that is kinda chode-y
---
Your numbers are wrong 2  survivors 2 gens done
---
 3 survivors 3 gens done
---
4 survivors 4 gens done
---
I agree, it needs to be changed, but destroying the whole concept of Mori offerings isn't the way
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dwtoqb/glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I just always do this unless they toxic / 3 man swf
---
Take bbq and brutal. Bbq will allow you to teleport near a quick chase. Brutal is obvious. 
---
I run Brutal, PGtW, Bbq and Ruin. All your choice obv.
---
This is my patented build btw. If you ever use it, refer to it as Zacks build.
---
So the next killer is Farfetch'd?
---
Any build survivors complain about, you'll have your amswer. Thananthrophobia for sure has to be in there because "cleansing bad".
---
I had another game which I forgot to mention. 
---
3 people DC’ed half way through. I was confused and it did not make the sound.
---
Mori’s and keys are about the same level. Insta heals were bad but keys and mori’s have to be to touched at the same time.
---
I don’t play survivor anymore for a reason, that reason being that my damn teammates are either toxic cunts that abuse the poor killer or I get stuck with absolute morons who have not a damn clue what they’re doing. 
---
I switched sides because my own side was unbearable lmao
---
The game is already killer sided.
---
Survivor don't need to get nerfed at all.
---
Have you tryed getting good instead of crying about getting gen rushed ?
---
Like there is litteraly many perk to avoid getting gen rushed.
---
Ex : 
---
Pop goes the weasel
---
Ruin
---
Thanatophobie
---
Dying light 
---
And many more.
---
What else do you want ? 
---
A nerf not allowing survivor to do gens ?
---
Well, Servers are set so that if it hits on the screen of the killer, it hit. Period.
---
That way you don't get strange bullshit like hatchets flying though people, or puke not making people sick, or swings on going though. This is why people get hit 5 steps after the window.
---
So while on your screen your hit around the corner, you weren't in their eyes, so it was a fair hit.
---
The hit box for the hatchets isn't massive, they are just structure magnets.
---
its quite clearly in a sarcastic comment chain... how dumb must one be to have taken my comment seriously. go get a life man, you’re wasting both of our time.
---
That sucks you have my sympathy for all that's worth
---
Lol after tome 1 came out, I made a point to level trapper in preparation for the next 3 tomes
---
I'll only play nicer than what I usually do if there's at least more than one DC, and if it happens very early in the game.
---
At only one early DC, I consider this a disadvantage for the Survivors, but not an unwinnable situation, especially because I already tend to play relatively nice against a full team. And seriously, even when not pulling any punches, I ain't that good at the game anyway.
---
If at least a second DC happens later on in the game, I will consider the game is advanced enough that it isn't that big of a disadvantage.
---
I found it quite to see tbh. I’ll try and look closer when I get a spirit, I’m really interested to see that.
---
I was saying this for the arguement that gen rush forces a killer to use a perk to counter it , it’s the same argument to use iron will against spirit . It’s just a suggestion , I wasn’t whining or anything , just a bit concerned .
---
Yeah its not official mechanics, but I think as a community its something we can do to combat the dc problem. 
---
Selfish DC’n ruins the game for all of us and I think we can appreciate good players that don’t dc when screwed by it. Letting them get enough done just so they won’t depip is fair imo. The good players shouldn’t take a penalty if we can help it, yeah?
---
Stupid cute huntress appreciates you. :)
---
Yeah these all made sense, good points. Slenderman inspired tho sounds cool
---
No one says that it‘s actually her dad
---
Omg no way
---
I think she’s been fairly balanced. Some of the main complaints people had (Prayer Beads, Window animation) were addressed, but they didn’t gut her main power. She’s still strong but significantly more fair. 10/10 good balance BHVR
---
No I noticed. You can see the sleeve on the skin when you buy it. It’s p obvious that it’s going to be on your screen when you use your power. Nothing to fix. It cover MAYBE a fifth of your screen.
---
If someone helps me with a tome in randoms ill let them go
---
OHHH but its a 4v1 game not a 1v1, chases should last 5-8 seconds each Tru3Head
---
You’re very nice and well done, huntress night have you as a snack. :) lmao, thanks
---
A year later
---
I'm resigned to the fact I will get told I'm camping and tunneling by salty survivors whether I am or not.
---
People try to tell me how to play killer when I’ve downed three of them and only one has escaped, like they just mad I managed to stop them at the gate because they got cocky.
---
Take my love, affection &amp; hatchets! You’re wonderful thank you for liking this :)
---
More than likely it is your average group of survivors who only play baby and low tier killers
---
You just repeatedly equip and unequip an item
---
I did it twice in row, but then when I had to do it the last time to escape, I didn‘t manage to do it,
---
I reaaaly don't need that BBQ on a Hag... But Hag farms BPs so easily, why not double it... To hell with it, i can spare a slot for that.
---
Thana, Nurses calling, Sloppy butcher.
---
The 4th perk is up to you and your game play style:
---
Ruin - if you want to bank on luck they don’t find it, run Ruin. Better in lower level game play but at higher tiers players find it almost immediately sometimes. Super either in their favor or yours
---
Corrupt Intervention: blocks all gens in the beginning. Gives you amole time to find survs and cause early game havoc which they can’t recover from. More dependable than ruin but wears  off after 2 mins 
---
Game style: slow down the game with sloppy and all those perks. If they don’t heal, you can gen grab or take em down with GF ability that hides red stain and everything. If they heal, its slow so not worth it. If they don’t heal, thana slows them down. If they heal, you find them with nurses.
---
Cause the bubba was practically standing in place, ROFL.
---
Don’t forget she also had no scratch marks and could pop gens solo in ridiculous time.
---
Love the people who unhook and go out of existence, and the injured guy is like: 
---
Que?
---
I kill anyone who remains, not my fault if the healthy can’t take a hit.:.
---
It's a small change but we will see if it will make her more balanced. I guess they don't want to go overboard and make her shitty.
---
All i ever really wanted was a phase collision removal so this is better then i expected
---
Who are you going to draw next maybe baby Mikey or Baby Ghostface
---
Lol. Guess every survivor should just drop when we get a DC, since fuck killers that think like you.
---
I think you misunderstood ? I'm saying there are way more potatoes than the other guy thinks there is.
---
If anything that would mean I am much more unlucky than everyone else to be getting significantly more potatoes as teammates right.
---
Well the goal of these nerfs wasn't to stop her from destroying so...
---
Right? Haha so crazy how close we were on some elements. And thank you!!
---
Oh boy, Im stupid for having an opinion. Gotta love this sub
---
Dead hard is the best exhaustion perk in the game besides maybe adrenaline.
---
KeYs ArE BaLaNcEd.
---
To bad
---
the challenges are a good idea - and it's fun to have meta-goals to work toward.... the issue is having ones that must be done in one game and everyone have the same ones. It creates bottle necks and situations where players are playing to check their goal box and thats it. Wish BHVR and thought this through a bit more.
---
Oh yeah my b, didn’t comprehend that right lmao
---
 There's more problems with survivor than just keys. And not all of them are because they are negatively effecting the killer. There's still the queue problem which is a problem on both ends. which might be helped with cross -play maybe. There's still little punishment for dc's which effects both sides. There's some unfair hit boxes for on windows and pallets due to servers. There's been problems with some perk combos being used that were/are broken as hell. Auto aim will go nuts sometimes and completely dodge the survivor. Survivors have at least 1 if not 2 exhaustion perks on them if they can have them. There some maps where there's so many long loops next to each other where's it's completely survivor sided. There's plenty of stuff that's wrong with game. I wish the game could be perfect but it's not.
---
If you don't want to put yourself in their shoes, put yourself in BHVRs shoes. These cosmetics were never meant to be sold. They were given out for free. Now people are using their products to make money off of people. And BHVR doesn't even get the money from it. What better way to screw over assholes than giving those cosmetics to everybody for free?
---
The people who spent money on these (anywhere from $50 - $2,500) made they're choice. If they had the money for it, obviously money wasn't a problem. But the people getting scammed shouldn't have to lose out because people are trying to make a quick buck off BHVRs game.
---
Gotta get some relief from the "When you play both killer and survivor" one I guess
---
Wait, is there are other ways to earn those auric cells except paying for season pass?
---
Never mention that film again.
---
keys are basically moris for survivors though..
---
The game kicked them out. I did not mention it in the post, but it did not make a sound when they DC’ed.
---
That might be slight overreaction. We have to wait and see just as all good players have mentioned. Her nerf def needed to happen for sure since collisions ruined survivor games and her vault animation was non existent. I still believe Spirit players can adapt to the new Spirit (slightly buffed in other ways) and demolish still. Now more experienced players have the upper edge since they can adapt quicker to the new character.
---
I've seen that happen before and was with friends, they didn't DC. I was the only one left.
---
It's fine lol he was saying less than 5% of people better than rank 15 are potatoes. I was like what???
---
More like 25% of people at least. Even at red ranks
---
I don’t think anyone deserves to have their steam names called out over a video game. Not trying to defend the actions of those survivors.
---
I think that's more indicative of the random nature of matches, matchmaking, and the playerbase's playstyle than anything.
---
You'd need an obscene number of ranks for rank 1 to be that small of a population. Even if rank 1 survivors were 0.1% of the playerbase, there'd be no way to maintain that rank because 1) you'd have to play with specific addons, perks, and in a party nearly every game and 2) the playerbase couldn't support the matchmaking.
---
I thought your point was that randomness was good in the competitive ranks of this game. Of course the ranking system is ineffective, it is in just about every assymmetrical competitive game (r6 siege as my main example).
---
Surge has 8% reduction.
---
No I just said it’s from a video game I play and he just asks if it’s appropriate and I say the game isn’t but this design is and he was fine with it.
---
The problem is you need 4 people to play a match when you queue as a killer. As a survivor you need 3, and  SWF you only need 1-2. If the survivor side of the game isn’t fun then less people will play. If killers are strong less people will play survivor take it’ll effectively kill the game.
---
It’ll always be easier waiting for 1 killer to queue up. But it is much more difficult finding 4 willing participants to get killed again.
---
They will never properly balance this game because they means less survivors will play. And unfortunately survivors are the lifeblood of the community. The game would be dead without things like SWF and weak killers

If it was a connection thing, the trial would’ve instantly ended. I’ve noticed that a lot of people have been DCing recently, so the most reasonable answer would be that you’ve just been encountering some toxic SWFs.

Exactly

That'd probably be because they got tunneled and moried? Reading comprehension has left the chat

Gotta hug those walls and not take the wide arcs. Every second is precious.

Do we know the name of the new killer? I hope it's called 'The Samurai' and he will have an awesome katana and armour.
---
Forever Freddy. Freddy doesn't need nerfed. This build needs to be gone. Freddy is plenty good without any slowdown. Toss all the hate you want at me but I will never again play against him. It's not hard. It's just not fun. I'm not going to spend 45 minutes holding m1 just for him to pgtw everything and I'm not going to give him the benefit of stack of anything off me it just encourages them to continue to ruin 4 people's fun 1 match at a time. I won't spend my free time being bored as all hell. I'll take my depip and be on my jolly way to a match that is fun, aka literally any other killer or build.
---
*Rule 1 of the survivor rulebook for killers states that once a killer hooks a survivor, they are to walk to the opposite corner of the map, giving the survivors sufficient time to get a safe unhook and a full heal, as well as enough time for them to continue working on a generator before the killer can return.*
---
But Ghostface’s add-ons are perfectly fine. What is there to nerf with Ghostface? The only thing they need to do with him is fix his reveal mechanic.
---
i think you mean latency and not hit box in that one box. when you get hit from far away its not the hit boxes fault. the hit boxes are completely fine. the latency is the one that does it. here is a post about it

Thanks for the Idea, gonna Play it with a few Buddies, all though with Changed Tiles. Gonna Tell You later how it Turned Out.
---
OK, but if the killer plays like an asshole after a DC, the survivors probably aren't having fun.
---
*Cue Windows 95 startup jingle*
---
Let the sad toxic kids hate. OP made a funny video. I laughed, god forbid 😂.let them get excited about virtual likes. It doesn’t bother me.
---
Oh wow, I didn't know that. Ghost Face has been out for a while though, I would imagine it'd have been on the shrine at least a couple times.
---
Yes, the issue still stands that, if you're injured, you're pretty much dead if you don't have iron will. And even then footsteps.
---
According to leaks there may be a sale coming up around US Thanksgiving. The details indicated 30% off outfits released prior to Stranger Things DLC. Character DLCs also looked to be on sale.
---
Ok then. You wanna revert the changes?
---
I remember my first survivor game was against Myers. I jumped on the first gen I saw, and was looking around for the killer and saw him standing still staring at me and my thought was "God this guy doesn't even know he's supposed to try and stop the survivors from finishing generators." I sure felt like a fucking idiot after that match when I learned he got tier 3 from me being an idiot.
---
Yea the Support for DBD told me to uninstall and then reinstall when I get home from work today. So I will try that but thank you very much for the response. Like I said I played as The Hag, Doctor and The Huntress last night but the Og 4 didnt even appear on the screen. To pay to play characters were all there buts it's as if they dont exists on my game lol.
---
I think it’s the demon that drove her father mad Iam pretty sure
---
Gens fly too fast? If you know how to pressure properly this shouldn't be as much of an issue. If they are SWF then yeah, it's gonna be harder
---
People are only running DS because they're getting tunneled to hell every match.
---
Thanks For the info! It's just what my friends and I called it
---
Exactly, if im just trying for achievement then ill goof around if one person dced. Or do what I call hard farming. Its just where I play like normal but never 3hook them and never let them loop me near a hooked person.
---
Keys: only work once survivors have done all the gens, or if some/all of their team has been killed off already. Basically a last glimpse of hope to escape. 
---
Moris: Hook one survivor and tunnel them down as soon as they are saved. They are now out of the game. 
---
Not really the same thing at all.
---
Killer perks and add ons are of course going to be more powerful when it’s an asymmetrical game. Survivors can bring four, the killer can only bring one. And if you dc for any reason you’re a little bitch, no excuse.
---
How many games did you encounter this type of people? Im rank 8 killer right now, and honestly, I only get this swf you're talking about once in every 10 games. In a full comm match, yes the survivors will have the advantage since they can coordinate properly, but even if multiple survivors have DS up, how long is the 1st one have left? If 3 survivors have DS at one time, chances are, the 1st guy only have 10-15 seconds of DS left, which you can play around with. Playing around ds timer is a good tactic by survivors since their goal is to finish the gens at all cost, which include distracting the killers. If you kept finding these swf groups all the time, which I doubt it, put on enduring and stbfl. Overly altruistic swf team is stbfl wet dream.
---
Goodb ye*
---
Na I have fun bullying killers now, t-bagging and doing to make sure they don’t pip.
---
In order to use a key, survivors must earn the hatch by completing gens. A four-man escape (which is extremely rare considering people almost never use keys) would require all the gens to be completed, and at that point, the killer isn’t likely to get more than one kill anyway. All the killer has to do for a mori is hook a survivor at the beginning of the game and then tunnel them down once unhooked for an easy game. The requirements to use each and their effects cannot be compared.
---
Thanks for the info, though I will take it with a grain of salt till it’s confirmation but knowing how lots of things go on sale round thanksgiving/bf/cyber Monday I can believe the devs will do some kind of sale again
---
That's pretty ok by me. One DC is still playable (if it's not after first down and no gen done.
---
Two DCs in an early game just means game over.
---
If I was toxic, I would think it means piece of sh*t, p*ssy punk b*tch.
---
Without conditions? Have you ever played Leather Face there’s quite a few conditions for you to be able to insta down people
---
Incoherent babble from a mental patient
---
This happens in a lot of games. My strat is too wait it out until a lot of people get pass a few of them. I then can do it with out hurting the gameplay experience.
---
It's still the rules of the subreddit.
---
It can be tough in solo queue because of the lack of communication. In SWF it's easy to say hey yeah just leave me and do all the gens, harder to get that across with randoms
---
You’d be surprised lol
---
if they can close the hatch and grab, then survivors are double fucked due to not being able to use the hatch when the killer is near (ie getting chased)
---
This meme format is getting old
---
I have done this a few times where I kill every one and once I drop the last one I hear the hatch and I just take them to it
---
There are so many perks that sometimes perks don't show up for a long time. I think it's been over a year since Make Your Choice appeared, yet some other perks have shown up a number of times (since its not a rotation).
---
Additionally, newer killers and survivors won't have their perks show up for a while because they don't want Shrine perk purchases to cannibalize DLC purchases.
---
I don't really change my playstyle at all because a game with a DC is boring so I just want to end it as soon as possible.
---
*Maybe* if they find my Ruin right away I'll let them farm, because I know they can work gens quick and we can get it over with quicker, but typically I'll just pull out all the stops.
---
In the trailer the guy says you’re blood belongs to the Yamaokas’ so it’s a fairly good bet it’s someone else in the family
---
That's how social standards work. You can violate them and you won't be officially punished, but you will be called a shithead. A lot of life works that way, where the consequences of bad behavior are entirely social.
---
Killer good survivor bad post n° 265
---
The Pig is surely not as bad as Doctor or LF.
---
It's because you can't be DSed if you slug, and due to the hatch changes you have to slug for the 4K.
---
And even if you don't care about the 4K, rank says you have to.
---
I suspect they will too. I'm hoping to pick up the remaining DLC i still need, and maybe another cosmetic.
---
Laurie's just Dessicive striked the killer.
---
Yep, but to some survivor mains he’s just “too strong” and he doesn’t take skill. After him, who knows who would get targeted next, probably Freddy. It’s ridiculous.
---
1 DC is winnable, two just straight up isn't
---
Ouch, one time my teammate lagged out and got DCed by the game and the killer just went at it and became the most aggressive thing ever 
---
within 10 seconds 1 survivor down, one injured, then within the next 10 seconds after that, one hooked and one downed 5 meters apart from each other
---
I DCed manually for the first time ever, it was barely a minute into the game and already the entire team relied on me-
---
felt bad
---
dance
---
As annoying as it is, its fucking hilarious.
---
In a Hag game I would tp into a chase, then TP into another chase with who I though was the same survivor, and then again back to the first survivor thinking absolutely nothing changed. Other times they would juke and become a different survivor.
---
I was wondering why the hell this post was on r/deadbydaylight
---
Could you be specific on the playstyle of the killer? Like holding game hostage or trying to hit them on the hook? Because any playstyle that isnt against the game's goal is ok to do by definition
---
Great! Now we're getting somewhere! What does the words MIGHT and PROBABLY mean? More specifically, the following statement was made before those words came into play; "I'm not saying he was but."
---
I'll wait for your next novel while I deliver this food.

Yeah when I play survivor, an early DC usually means I emotionally check out of the game. I'll stick around for a mid-to-late DC, but 3v1 from the start just isn't worth playing.  I don't care about my rank or points, I just want a fun game, so I'm pretty likely to suicide on first hook to move on to the next game. I'm not expecting kindness from the killer, I just want out.
---
Mori alters a game for all 4 survivors every time one is used effectively. Keys are situationally good and very rarely benefit anyone but the person using it without comms and swf. I do not think they are on the same level at all.
---
I know that, but it was the most accurate format I could think of
---
Oh, I'm not entitled. I play both sides thank you very much. That's why I can say there's problems with both sides. the killer wasn't equipped for this situation and that ended up being his downfall. But in this particular case with 3 survivors one after another getting hatch is insane. the killer has barely anything he can do even with franklins because of the hit animation preventing more hits. I have used plenty of keys before and escaped with them. I don't escape every time mind you, but I've escaped quite a few times with them. and the add ons for keeping the key even after death DO show up more often than keys so they can be used way more than once. And there's both the purple key and iridescent key that can be used to open the hatch so that's more chances to get an item that does the same thing except one has more use with other add ons.  Anything else?
---
Yah I main trapper to happen to all of us, wait I just though of a little Billy or leatherface being tiny and trying to chase a survivor with a Their tiny body and a huge chainsaw okay i let you get drawing
---
So all of them!! :P in your own time of course 🤣
---
Latency
---
That's a kate but still those are hacks and you should report her. Even though she probably has 70000 more accounts
---
they should add more environmental actions then just dropping pallets and vaulting
---
consider getting good.
---
Its one thing to have a newbie friendly killer, thats called wraith. Simple ability, gets fucked on by people who know how to play.
---
Then theres spirit, simple ability, no counterplay.
---
Imagine if wraith uncloak was 1 second, and there was no shimmer in his movement. That is a worse spirit since spirit doesn't even need the 1 second to come out of invis.

Do you really have trauma from people crouching and uncrouching
---
spirit is barely being touched lol
---
Soooooo.....it's not going to be any different than the usual dbd game then.....?
---
I literally run that combo because of bad teammate saves in front of the killer. If they repect ds it gives me a fighting chance, if they dont same thing. I hate wasting two perk slots for a second chance I may necer need but when I don't it seems like I have a big farm me sign on my back.
---
Ahh yes, tbagging because a killer is missing their swings isn't toxic.ok bud
---
This is an old post. Stop reviving nearly 200 day posts.
---
Snare Freddy is a fucking beast man.  No addons no problem lol.  He can stomp red rank swf groups if you're a good player.  I actually like him above Billy at this point since he can't really be looped once you know how to play him SNARES &gt; Pallets.  I like to bring him out against 4 toolbox lobbies.  He's so great at gen pressure.
---
Wait really? Finally, I am loved!
---
~~but go off~~
---
Outplayed
---
Mob rule or votes based on opinions. So you agree that tunneling is limited to only if you go after them straight away off hook. Exactly be quiet
---
Makes sense she was released in the Plague DLC. Killer is down with the sickness, survivor is down with the thiccness.
---
I had nothing else to do, I was blocked and stuck in a corner
---
I agree with everything except your last statment, because that is the counter play to ds, however I also understand you can't just let stupid plays go unpunished.
---
After reset? I ran into like 4 or 5 3-4 man swfs out of 10-12 games I played as killer. Given that I mostly play huntress, enduring and stbfl are mostly useless. And as for ds, how tf am I supposed to keep track of every survivor I hook and keep a mental timer of how long it's been since they were unhooked? DS should just deactivate after the killer hooks someone else, if it's supposed to actually be an anti-tunnel perk.
---
People like you ruin the dbd experience for everyone. I sincerely hope you get permanently banned from dbd. You should try thinking about other people instead of yourself.
---
If the are givning away event stuff, then people that earnt it during the event should get a special version of it.
---
I’ve played against more legions and ghost faces today than the least 2 weeks... it’s bullshit
---

Hahah house to post again soon! Drawing powers activate!

Might I point you to Tusk
---
Silence! We don't speak ill of Billy here! He's protected! Nevermind the fact that he's never left the top 3 most-picked high-rank Killers  and can fly across the map and get 1HKOs with no cooldown!
---
He's a a-game character, so he's untouchable.
---
Go go drawing power drawing little cute killer

Lololol I wasnt toxic. I had nothing else to do. I'm a killer main and I wouldnt even consider this toxic if a survivor did that to me. Are you that fragile that you see a teabag and immediately just go "toxic"?
---
Or jumps out of a locker that you didn't even know they were in.
---
honestly it’s stupid, I’ve played games on rank 1 where I’m the nicest killer ever and it’s like muscle memory for them to PM me “tunelling toxic camping killer” as soon as the game is over
---
I've played against you and you lost your Ebony Mori with 0 kills on my team as Pig, so?
---
Exactly.
---
If I’m the last and the killer gots me I don’t even struggle anymore. It’s their choice now
---
I run both because if seems people always unhook me in front of the killer. Trust me when I say I hate using two slots for this but I'm sick and tired of getting farmed off the hook.
---
Im on xbox. Since the rift, DCs have been out of control. Probably averaging 1 per game at the moment. Its making completing my challenges a joke. Really feels like people are DCing yo prevent your progress. Im currently doing the 13 sacrafices challenge still, getting 1 or 2 a game because of DCs. Yet to 4k even though i should have a few times and i should be well past yhis challenge by now.
---
Not toxic to killers I could see your teamates being annoyed though since they're essentially carrying you through the trial since they're essentially 3 manning the objectives.
---
Lotta people want to sink some firm, solid long things into her body while she cries out.
---
It's not clear that guy is saying tunneling is bannable... unsportsmanlike is a real adjective that real people use...
---
that SWF is working together anyways, it doesn’t matter if they safepip or depip let’s be honest. They would make matches harder for lesser ranked players in a way that says “this player should not be this low” at the end of the match with how effectively they played.
---
Thats my two cents.
---
Killers can only do two things to piss me off: **camping hooks** and **tunneling survivors** and this doesn’t sound like either of those
---
As a noobie, I'm happy. I hate time-gated exclusives.
---
Not sure exactly but that seems very possible
---
To me, it seems like most people complaining about keys want them removed outright. And tbh, I can’t really think of a way to ‘balance’ them and satisfy the killers without removing them.  (Obviously I’m against removing them).
---
And yeah, the guys that hide in the corner all match are super annoying too.  Slugging the 3rd is annoying, but if the killer really wants that last kill, it might be necessary.
---
Yea i feel bad sometimes when survivors get farmed in front of me
---
Lol when people call me a trash killer I say "Exactly. I'm designed to kill trash, like you!" that usually makes them super mad.
---
I made a full version, but I didn't wanna steal your meme, so [here](https://imgur.com/pVsVUgW)
---
You always kill at least 2? Funny, you got 0 with an Ebony Mori when we played LOL
---
Coin flips both ways. Last night I was like "hrm lemme try some different add-on and perk combos for Spirit to prepare for the upcoming nerfs, it's only rank 13..."
---
Nope, bullied by 3 SWFs in a row abusing Haddonfun/Ormond offerings, balanced landing and ultra-altruism. After that it was an hour straight of Yakuyoke/Beads with some instasaw Billy thrown in for good measure.
---
Man this is straight up racist, a lot of players are tryhards, a lot of players are toxic, the country they were born or the language they speak means nothing
---
I have some of them,  that mask for example and the David jacket that I really like and it's the only cosmetic I use for him.
---
I got to use it like 1 year before the rest and I don't mind sharing, I don't need to feel special because I have them.
---
This person is obviously a teenager don’t even waste your time
---
&gt; It’s like childhood years are fucking slow.
---
The reason why childhood years are slow is because you are learning all new stuff. So your brain is remembering all new stuff you have learned from that day.
---
But as time goes your brain will get used to usual stuff you are doing every single day and that you are not experiencing anything new which means that some memories are blurred and put into one.
---
That is the reason why time flies much faster when you are getting older.

I second this. My roommate is probably one the nicest people you’d ever meet but damn his inner toxicity comes out in his dbd matches
---
I thought of this too and would think so.
---
They should remove Moris from the game along with killer power addons, offerings and killers.
---
Might I interest you in a human centipede at this juncture?
---
Oh Larry's and I do the same when it comes to a nearby unhooking [less then 10m] yea it's their faults for staying so close together.
---
Thank you 😭
---
#bufflegion
---
(Also my username checks out)
---
This is the 100% truth and comedy gold.
---
No, but if we have to base ourselves from the changes..it's quite a nerf. Basic phasing nerfed, phasing addons nerfed, Prayer beads nerfed, collisions during phasing removed, vaulting animation added. 
---
She will probably be still powerful, but these are definitely not small nerfs guys.
---
You learn something new everyday kids! 
---
But thank you. I mean now that you said that it sounds like fucking common sense lol. Have a good one mate!
---
Honestly if survivors dont like the slugging and how long it takes to die, just dont fucking hidr. Ive sern so many people complain about bleeding out for a 4k ehen they hide in high grass 5 miles away from the downed point.
---
Aaaaw, Billy looks so cute .\_. Who would Tbag such a beautiful creature?!
---
And the key is way more useful for other than just the hatch. Seeing the killer and your teammates for a good amount of time. and you increase it's use time as well.
---
Why is it bad that she is a s tier killer if she is fair to play with mindgame potential?
---
yeah I used to main billy but have been getting bullied lately now that I am rank 1, (rank reset now I’m at 8)
---
Honestly, always having injured people run into me, and of course, the second I down them I'm a "tunneler" and a baby killer. Same thing with hook patrolling, like if I see you get unhooked by a healthy survivor, then I'm going to swing at you, it's just common sense
---
It's disgusting. I'm rank 13 with my friend and we faced a spirit with prayer beads, ruin, bbq, noed, haunted grounds, and an ebony mori.
---
*angery as fuk squawking from circling crows
---
I tend to have a lot of American opponents and they are usually toxic. What does this mean? Oh maybe it’s every fucking country has toxic people lol.
---
Not really. Both are stupid and need tweaked, yes, but mori's are worse. Keys at least require the survivors to complete most, if not all, of their objective before coming into play. Mori's lead to a first hook, tunnel, dead. Means de-pip, and hardly any BP. 1 hook and a second down isn't the same as doing 5 gens.
---
Yeah I know that we learn something new everyday but it looks like that brain just doesn't give F about it :D
---
Maybe with more studies we will learn more about why is this happening.
---
yeah, all you have to do is stay near the survivor and get a new chase on the killer so the other survivor who got picked up or unhooked can go heal and do gens
---
If anyone does anything that doesnt help win them the game (tbagging as killer/survivor, purposefully blocking path indefinitely, exploiting, taunting, etc.), that is "being an asshole". Killer or survivor doing things that is unfun for the other team is not. It is a competitive game, you do what you think is good to win. Complain to devs on improving balance or mechanics if you think 1DC equals to killers letting people go.
---
Yeah but it’d just be a waste to not use em after spending bp on em
---
And i quite enjoy watching The Demogorgon eat their heads
---
Eh just list off the survivor issues, those are relevant to the point you're trying to prove chief
---
Oh sweet now I can destroy an extra pallet AND I can chase someone lol!
---
You threw down every fuckin pallet for no reason (dont throw it down until its able to stun him
---
Yeah I’m gonna look around for my teammate and look for crows when the killer finds me lmao
---
I ran that way because my teammate I just rescued from hook ran a different way. I didnt know that was blocked off, I dont have the maps memorized. I was running, got stuck in a corner I wasnt expecting and the pig was swinging and missing and I was just trying to survive. Really... get over it. You're saying nothing about the killer body blocking which is just as toxic as "teabagging". I was spamming because I was trying to get out of the corner the killer was forcing me to be stuck in, and that didnt bother me. I was trying to escape, he was trying to hit, he missed and I did whatever I could to try and escape. Again.... not toxic. Spamming crouch itself isnt toxic, the context of which that is being done is what makes it toxic. You really need to get out of that black/white mentality.
---
Nice reference with the immersion box.
---
Leatherface and Demogorgon are pretty on par imo
---
You still hear the woosh sound but if you’re close enough then yeah you could probably get a grab.
---
Forget the game play, are you playing on a gameboy or a calculator????
---
If someone DC's I slugg more than I usally do. So they don't die so early but I can still make points.
---
One of my favorite pastimes is for me and my friends to all go Hobo Jesus with the same outfit and name ourselves "our name Jeff"
---
Also works if you want to be the aces of spades/clubs/hearts/diamonds (bonus points if you coordinate with the colored hats)
---
ghostface kinda vibin doe
---
Ghostface's is pretty much on the same level with this one in my book.
---
I don't like Demo's at all
---
Because of the Iron Will issue.  She requires that perk in order to keep the counterplay that exists against her when injured.  Mindgames go out the window the moment she can hear you crying.  If they use a headset your ass is about to get got right quick assuming they aren't potato.  I still don't think that's healthy for the game but I went into the rework knowing they can't really touch her ability to hear survivors midphase so I knew it was here to stay.  Ultimately I support the changes but her biggest issue for me is still here to stay.
---
It's more obvious than ever that these devs don't play their own game.
---
That's the kind of survivor that bullies rank 20 killers and wants you to let him and his team escape after all
---
That timing couldn't have been literally any worse
---
This meme has nothing to do with dead by daylight
---
Oh I was speaking about myself like I just learned something new today lol sorry I wasn’t trying to be a smartass or rude. 
---
The older the brain gets the more it’s harder to you know grab knowledge. And when your young you don’t have much of any knowledge so it’s easier to learn. That’s pretty much how I perceive it. 
---
It also has to deal with people just not wanting to learn or tired of learning.
---
If you want my opinion? I think the mask contains a spirit that feeds on blood and caused rins dad to go crazy
---
WAIT, I'm not the only one?
---
they'll get bored of it too, eventually
---
I'm sure this guy sees a russian name and automatically assumes he's gonna be toxic wtf
---
Someone used strode realty key with hex:piano

The killer body block is somewhat toxic but that's completely your fault for going over there. You may have not known the map but you have eyes and you could have looked to see that it led nowhere.
---
For whatever reason the crows never appeared, id check all the lockers near the hook &amp; they'd be empty too
---
I understand the feeling, but I also have nothing wrong with spirit though. But also I have to use two slots for a niche thing. If I don't get tunneled or teammates dont make terrible plays ots two wasted slots

Oh I misunderstood that. I thought that you are trying to tell: We are learning our whole life which is true :D

hahaha that’s so true man, especially after rank reset you start to see every survivor bring a map offering with swf to bully killers

You are barely reading her changes

Shit now the Russians know the secret. Name your character with a American type name like xxxDankmemelordxxxx lol
---
Moris are supposed to be worse, power-wise, because they're used by the 1 of the 1v4. That said, we're agreed that they're both bullshit either way.
---
Thats it, Leatherface is getting nerfed.
---
This is why i quit PS4 and went to PC
---
The killer can play the game and win, and choose to not be an asshole while doing so. Or they can playt the game and win in a way that makes them an asshole.
---
Their choice.
---
No date as far as I am aware.
---
yeah, my country has some toxic players but whenever i meet a russian theres a high chance of him being scummy
---
When the killer is just behind the wall and Head On hasn't activated yet.
---
I actually did a drawing of what I tough was going to be his appearance, I’ll maybe post it tomorrow, it is really related to the blood. But I mean, everyone is making memes of BHVR introducing someone from Rin’s family in the game, so I tough this idea might be fun
---
You want OP to but a XBOX?
---
:(
---
Yes, it is my fault for going in that corner, but it isnt toxic for me trying to escape. I was trying to get out, I couldn't. I ran in a 1x1 little block, spamming crouch to avoid getting hit so I could escape. That's not toxic, that's trying to survive. You're inability to recognize the difference is astonishing.

I had a 2/4 match a few weeks ago where one of the survivors was super salty (likely because I was Demogorgon and I lunged at him while he was teabagging at the gate, and actually got him before he could crawl away) and I acknowledged that I'm not a great killer, but I'm trying to get better and the only way I can do so is through practice.
---
He actually told me to "go play the tutorial".
---
It's like, bruh. Have you played the tutorial in this game? It's nothing. It's absolutely nothing. It does nothing to prepare you for what the game is actually like. It's not going to make you a better player.
---
What are the nerfs? The prayer beads being a global thing and the collision being taken off right?

I'm actually busy working and after you reading both of those definitions coincide with exactly my original statement. Reading comprehension isn't about your ability to read what is said. It is about understanding what you're reading. Clearly youre still at a 4th grade level.
---
Good for you, but if you care so little why did you comment on a post about someone that as you said you give 0 fucks about instead of downvoting and moving on?
---
What? Spirit will be still top 3 after the patch and legion is one of the worst
---
I never tunnel, and if I happen to, it's only cuz the unhooker hid and I had no idea where anyone else is, where I just leave them on the ground, unless it's the end-game
---
I still get hit by it a lot, cuz hooking 2 others survivors is not enough and it's still tunneling
---
That's not true I do it all the time it's not hard unless...
---
Escaping/Winning shouldn’t be the **ONLY** fun part of playing Survivor, though. I know it’s basically the only goal, but after 900+ hours of this game over a span of 2 years I’m just glad to have something else to do. Even if you end up being sacrificed and losing, having that Rift Progress and free Bloodpoints is still a nice bonus to have. Pressing M1 on a Gen over and over gets pretty stale. I like the idea of having little personal challenges and hard requirements for them, because it gives you something else to look forward to. It’s basically what the Daily Challenges should have been like.
---
If you’re upset about people not trying to escape, I’d try to make a SWF group so that you at least are able to sync up what you guys want to do.
---
If you want to use them just do it after 2 hooks, that way it still feels like the death hook but cooler. Or just don’t use them since moris or boring for killer and survivor
---
If they're relevant why wouldn't i use them. most of them effect both which counts as a survivor issue.
---
Hag is the best, sorry buggy
---
First, I did not downvote you, other people did.
---
Second, There is nothing to respond that I haven't already said on my comment. I personally don't think bH messed up on giving people their things back, as they can't go account per account giving people their items back because a lot of people were affected by the save loss glitch.    No one was asked to buy those, they were always 
---
supposed to be free and exclusive to those present in the conventions. If people then resold it for exorbitant amounts, and then people bought it is not bH's problem.
---
Yes it makes me slower, but what does speed have to do with being stuck in a corner? I'm going to try to change my hitbox location instead to survive. You're really trying your hardest to try to make this toxic. I was panicking and just doing whatever I could to survive.

* DC to make a point. I Know the killer doesn't care. But I am usually playing with friends and if the killer does something extremely unsportsmanlike. I'll DC on principle as the game goes on. I'll wait long enough that I know I'm dead though. Like third hook etc.  
---
And those cases are extremely rare. Like, maybe 1 DC every 20+ games. Last time was when I got hard tunneled. Through DS and everything. Didn't matter what happened. The ghost face just came after me continuously. Regardless of if someone else was there. I was the first, 2nd, and third hook in that game. So I DCed before the 3rd hook just to waste his time.
---
Prayer beads being map wide is a big nerf to it, since you know when she phases..she can't surprise you anymore. 
---
Vault animation is really good, now you can tell if she is vaulting and wont have to flip a coin and   
---
 to know where to run. 
---
The zoom out of the "cloak" makes her more of a skillful killer, now she is punished for phasing in the wrong direction and wont have a stupid burst that makes up for your mistake.
---
These are needed changes to my eyes so she is not as braindead as before
---
Can we get an F in the chat for this boomer
---
You thought it was Amanda, but it was I; Anna!
---
did I say that? No.
---
But these changes dont actually fix the issue with Spirit
---
Drives me fucking nuts. 
---
Three dipshits crouching around like they're looking for change in the fucking couch cushions while I slip lovingly into phase 2.
---
exactly
---
What bloodpoints? Where you getting blood points in this economy!?
---
If you are on pc and find yourself board you can look up the skillcheck emulator.
---
Moris were merged. At game start, you could mori without a hook. You go down, you die. But Instas and BNP were left alone.
---
I never said anything about it being a banable. What I meant was hooking them not just downing them, but I should've been more clear with that.
---
They’re both
---
I've gotten zero doing a gen solo before, didn't even realize Ruin was there until my second gen. RNG is a bitch.
---
OoO is useless against him now tho why would he camp
---
First time?
---
True you shouldnt get those if you have that killer
---
The next Killer we will get in mid December, I think he will be released about the 17th (maybe +- 7 days)
---
I’m solo and I start off doing gens. Once someone gets hooked I will go for the save to get my Deliverance. It’s usually after my team stops doing gens that I go full sabo on the far side of the map from the basement.
---
Not always the case but I understand where you’re coming from.
---
I’d say rank 8 to 13 is like a limbo of both good players and potatoes. I see both in a lot of videos I watch. It’s the predicting if it’s a good lobby is what’s interesting.
---
Down bruh
---
NOED users really want bones to matter.  Saying “you need noed, so, survivors do bones” is....ehhhh what? Whaaaa? Bu whaaaaa?
---
Bones aren’t objectives.  Yes, you can break them to counter noed (or, keep track, break ones by the exit gate...you know, efficiency).  However, countering noed is not an objective.  Getting out, and, preventing people from getting out, is.
---
How many games have you won for survivors escaping, but keeping 5 totems up, and vice versa?  
---
I play both sides.  I don’t care to argue about NOED itself.  Adrenaline is rewarded for completing your objective.  NOED is rewarded for failing to complete your objective.  As killer, I’ve never played and said “omg adrenaline on everyone? Ugh that’s bullshit.”  I don’t get mad about NOED either, if you needed a win that bad you lost the game to get your 1, maybe 2 kills, that’s cool.  
---
I just don’t like that it’s given to players, and not earned.  
---
If you want it based on totems, as a person in a twitch chat I was in stated.  “Have NOED come with tokens for one hit per unlit totem.  If survivors break totems, your counter goes down.”
---
Imagine playing a 3 men
---
I don't think you understand how unbalanced the game was when mori's were added.
---
Word. Got pissed the other day when the killer brought in a mori, I ended up being first chased and eventually downed, and while I’m hooked one teammate gets downed. The stupidest jake comes in as other teammate is being hooked right nearby me and pulls me off hook in front of the killer... with we’ll make it. No BT and jake didn’t even try to take aggro or a hit, just ran off as the killer promptly chased me down and killed me. Thanks a lot. /s
---
no if you get mad easily yes if you're a masochist
---
dead hard saved your ass
---
In short: it’s not complaining about NOED.  It’s complaining about the unearned, training wheels that it is.
---
Wholesome!
---
Why are you so obsessed with alt accounts and dislikes, does that get you off? I don't know the the guy that made the comment, but I'll say this one last time, yes, unsportsmanlike is possibly a bannable offense according to the DBD reporting system, but it's also A WORD THAT PEOPLE USE. 
---
“It's fine if you happen to find them again first, but if you see them get unhooked, it's unsportsmanlike and potentially stupid to not go after the rescuer instead.”
---
I don't see any mention or imply's in that comment that tunneling is bannable. I know tunneling is not a bannable offense, now go jack off over getting dislikes and attention.
---
What do you mean by this like people are mean? Not welcoming?
---
Spinechill
---
Everyone has that one perk they wouldnt be caught dead without, mine is spinechill.I originally put it on because it increased vault speed and now I cant be without it because of the sheer amount of killers it counters
---
Ghostface
---
pig
---
myers
---
spirit (when the perk dims you know they are phasing) 
---
And the rest of the killers too to a much lesser extent
---
TL:DR dont like stealth? Use spinechill
---
I think it may cancel out some pallet stuns while either in phase or post phase.
---
I swear to God I always get shit on by Legion. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG
---
Yea just tried my first game and everyone was like level 16 plus I felt so bad I died and let my team down
---
Explain it to me, what do you mean with "she can phase to a new area"?
---
what are ya guys smokin' that y'all consider legion to be a top tier killer? gimme some!
---
Riiiiggghhhttt? It's fucking crazy. I'm scared I'm gonna find a splinter for a killer ON that killer. Hasn't happened yet, but I'm not very confident that it won't happen.
---
I feel like if you go to say something that stereotypes a group of people it isn't necessarily racist. If you judge every single person you encounter with a preconceived idea of what they're going to be like based solely on stereotypes then you're racist.
---
I don't think it's racist to describe how your encounters with a specific type of people and create stereotypes. Stereotypes don't exist purely to create rumours ot subject anyone to be offended, many stereotypes exist based on certain ways that groups of people behave. I feel like the best way to think about this scenario would be that his own experiences with Russian people has been negative, not just assuming all Russian people behave this way.
---
I'll use an example you might be able to understand since I know a large part of the Dead by Daylight community lives in The United States of America and you might too. In many European countries North American tourists are often encouraged to wear something with the Canadian flag on it. American tourists have created a stereotype over time for not being very good tourists so wearing something with a Canadian flag helps separate American tourists from scrutiny. 
---
Another example of stereotyping against tourists is with Chinese tourists. In a lot of urban areas in densely populated areas of China, public restrooms are often hard to access and Chinese people (especially young children who can't hold their bladders as well) will relieve themselves in public areas and there has been massive scrutiny against Chinese tourists doing this in other countries where public restrooms are easily accessible. 
---
I think calling someone racist for simply pointing out a negative experience they've had with a person of another race or culture is just bewildering. If we weren't allowed to say anything about how certain groups behave one might say that we shouldn't have gotten upset at Cuba becoming a Communist country due to the way America manipulated certain trading exercises with them. Just because Cuba became Communist and I point out I disagree with it, doesn't mean I'm trying to upset any Cubans who aren't Communist at all and are all for democracy,  my comments against Cuba are a generalization, not an attack.
---
Went up against a Spirit running two green addons who lost me in a chase about 5 times even though I made no attempt to juke her out and was playing loud-ass Jane Romero without Iron Will.
---
Spirit still feels the need to drop me by hatch to close the hatch in my face, and then spends half the In-Game Collapse to down me after my Rank 15 teammates threw down all the pallets.
---
Also still feels the need to hit me and nod at me on the hook.
---
Hex: Escape! Cake
---
Eachtime a survivor completes a generator, heals a teammate, protection hits, or unhooks a survivor, gain a stack. Each stack grants 400% increase in bloodpoints of all categories. Stacks cap at 24. Bloodpoints will be awarded in the post game menu.
---
and that means he wants the points, so it proves my original point.
---
::hits pan:: confused screaming!
---
I’d say watch some streams or videos for each of the killers and pick one that suits your play style. All of them are pretty good in their own way.👍
---
I think they’re fair.
---
What do you mean bullshit? This tome isn't hard
---
get David King and farm with We're Gonna Live Forever. same basic premise except you get tokens for safe unhooks AND protection hits
---
Careful, if we use FGC terminology around here we usually get yelled at.
---
Multiple moderately known streamers have argued with me over what is/is not a mind game, and all of them brush off FGC comparisons as "not applicable" and "irrelevant" (including re: mind games and such)
---
These changes are so minor. She's still going to be amazingly strong. Chill.
---
I have a feeling no matter what I say, you will be combative. Ciao.
---
I agree with your point. Good spirits are just too powerful. Last night I was playing against a swf in rank 5 (I think it’s pretty good survivors since this is right after rank reset). Anyways I was using praying beads and the emulate cuz I wanna use them up before the nerf. My perks were BBQ stridor distressing and beasts of prey. The two perks for bp cuz the add ons were too strong. I had two gen grabs right off the bat. And they quit the game. Post game chat were salty af. And then I ran into them for another match. To prove a point, I didn’t use any addons and simply changed beasts of prey to ruin. This time they didn’t quit, but I got 4K before they can get to gen 3. Post game chat were even more salty but I think I got my points across. Spirit will always own survivors.

what, you want walking skillchecks?
---
Someone crashes? Sure I'll play nice.  
---
Someone rage quits? Nah dawg, that's a kill. Thanks.
---
Well, you did call it banable by calling it unsportsmanlike.
---
That’ll happen a lot don’t feel bad just keep playing and watch some videos/streams to try and understand some of how the game works and you’ll soon be as good as everyone else.
---
She is in the same position as Nurse. Still strong but not braindead easy to use anymore.
---
The average Spirit player, will struggle, yes. They will probably move to Freddy
---
Where did they say this?
---
I’m pretty chill I’m not mad. I just feel like the mind game isn’t their anymore.
---
Yo would you mind posting a screenshot of that outfit?
---
So if I complete a challenge and it turns gold and such, I have to redeem it? I can’t stockpile completed challenges? Working on a lengthy one now so not super privy to risking testing it on this one.
---
Maybe I’m a little confused about Tome levels/tiers but I finished Tier 1 and am looking to basically do this for Tier 2. Then, when Tier 3 comes out, I’ll redeem if I have to in order to progress on Tier 3. Just wanted to try it out.

Freddy is the one killer I hate in this game.
---
Excuse me sir, logic is illegal here. Gonna have to ask you to stop it and pick up a pitchfork.
---
Bringing back the classic telefrag with style.
---
Is this game easier for the killer or survivor?
---
That's not reliable. It is a small Nerf.
---
I added a new thing to help with this problem, once the exit gates have been powered, Bad Omen will no longer increase. This way Killers can secure at least one kill if they had a bad match.
---
I literally asked what you mean, how am i combative? You came up with a sentence that doesn't make sense at all

Yes, absolutely: but in a hypothetically world where they were to release the Legacy skins to the public I'd be for veteran players receiving an additional award. I have Legacy Dwight and part of Legacy Nurse, and I'd love to get the rest of them but I don't want my work to be in veign. I don't understand why you would downvote my suggestion when I'm in favor of giving something back IF this was to happen.

can’t wait for when we get level 4 and have to do multiple flashlight saves in one game as well as getting 3 safe unhooks after end game collapse has started and the match is basically over.

Welcome to Xbox. I got banned for asking why events make people play like assholes. I didn’t call anyone in particular an asshole, just asked why some people play like it during events. Because the ban is 24 hours you aren’t allowed to appeal it, so it’s stuck on my record now. That means that because I got wrongfully banned by an automated system it takes less to get me banned in the future.
---
Why don't you have more upvotes
---
Exactly, I love the game and don't mind playing differently, as for the healing challenges I had some fun with full healing build, but that's more in your control than trying to speed up the game

If unsportsmanlike is a banable offense then maybe don’t say tunneling is unsportsmanlike? Since the game says unsportsmanlike is banable and the devs have said tunneling and camping aren’t banable. 
---
I bring up alt accounts once lol. I brought it up because your account is almost 200 days old with Barry any karma and your last interaction was 25 days ago. Seemed odd. 
---
Before you argue “People say unsportsmanlike to describe mean things”. I never said they didn’t.
---
That's literally impossible vs Bubba
---
I could see that, especially if there is any sort of lag with the servers, which let's face it there definitely is. But I can see getting nma pallet slammed on your face only to come out on the same side as the survivor, or better yet just getting stuck in pallets for an easy GG while they slam out gens and you are stuck in place.
---
The mind game is definitely still there, you just have to pay a little more attention
---
Okay? It’s a tab to ban people in this game
---
Oh I'm working too. I just have a job that lets me be on reddit as well a work. As long as i get my work done they have no problem with me being on reddit. And reading comprehension only works if you're able to read. Which you're only half doing. And those definitions definitely don't work in your favor. Which you would know if you could actually comprehend what the definitions of the words are. You're not using any arguments that support your claim and all this has dissolved to is name calling DUE to the fact you can't come up with a good argument. Have fun in your land of make believe where you PROBABLY live in. And have fun at your deliver job where you MIGHT be making minimum wage at.

If you already have the perk it’s 250k BP instead of 150k tho

What minigame? Touching players in phase, cause that's not a mindgame.

Well glad to hear it!

My teammates when im survivor: Quick and quiet, urban evasion, hiding in corner immersed all games

Survivors when im killer: 4 BNPs, do 3 gens instantly through ruin because they always hit great skill checks, 1 of them runs me for 6 minutes and its 4 escapes.

Ok calm down Satan
---
You just might have a bad connection or Nat type. Also possible that the survivors struggled to connect to your host.
---
Fuck I could actually see that being a huge problem. As is she gets knocked out of phase on a stun. If the collision isn’t there to move her to one side of the pallet during the stun animation she might get stuck. A lot
---
Well she now makes sound right even if your in her terror radius. So that means she can’t trick you by standing still and all you have to do is walk in a unpredictable direction and depending on the map your gone.
---
No she doesn’t; re read it
---
Yea but it's still nice. My old TV was shit. You can see some pixels on the outlines but this TV is crisp. LG ?
---
Ok will do
---
I intensely dislike sprint burst.
---
I followed Aether from the WAW days, never felt so fucked by a story. There's a close 2nd but zombies is the worst.
---
No not that
---
Well yes butt I mean like there’s a lot of perks on many different characters that you will need to do amazing and some are dlc characters etc.
---
it’s generally gonna be impossible in general, all things considered. if the killer hasn’t killed someone, they will generally be super defensive if they get a hook. there’s also the stipulation of safe unhooks, we have to account for the fact that you’re teammates could’ve been hooked twice. you literally can’t go into matches planning for this, all the planets and stars have to align in exactly the right way for u to even get the chance to do this. could u imagine the feeling of trying for this for so long, and then fucking it up cus u miss a ds or something? I’d cry.
---
I just used it because most of my friends play cod zombies (what image is from) and dbd so I thought it would be perfect for them
---
Same if i was that pig, yikes.
---
Edit: to not be a dick
---
I have to grab somebody off a gen. Not looking forward to this.
---
Probably gonna try Michael Mayonnaise for this one.
---
Survivor 100%. 
---
I’d give killer a go so you can feel the difference.
---
oh good it's the funny cat meme again
---
Jesus so do I. Same with freddies soubd when you are asleep.
---
Oh my God, you're hysterical. Ok, you caught me. Show's over, I'm the OP's alt account, even though I never interacted with him before. Congratulations, you win the argument by deflecting everything and making up stuff as you go. I want to be as cool as you, where I pretend I don't care about downvotes, but proceed to downvote all comments because I lost a small, stupid argument over the interwebz. GGEZ, right?
---
Angry spirit cause she is being gutted by the devs lmfao
---
I would play a bit of both because it’s hard to say which is easy it more personal taste.
---
I like that slight pause. Like “oh shit I hit that”
---
I'm a simple man. I see Judge Caprio, I upvote.
---
Which means you take longer to land that one hatchet than you would to land 1/3 of your hatchets. It would balance itself slightly
---
I’m standing by the spirits. Hers is so angry that it’s satisfying against that especially toxic survivor
---
Not if you're just trying to play with your friends lol. I now have to wait for my friends to die.
---
And they could require like a second or something to push over instead of just being instantly thrown down. But in exchange for making them a bit more dangerous to throw they could be put in places that fundamentally would change the layout of the map like for example  say throwing a bookshelf down in lery's instead of just cutting a path off, it also snags a  cable which yanks the object down and crashes through some boards opening a new window in the vicinity. And other things of the sort.
---
One time I had none until I decided to run.
---
The dark sense challenge doesnt require you to fully repair a gen, as long as you are working on it while it reaches 100% then ypu are fine
---
I don't know but thank you!
---
Uh, I didn’t say you were OPs alt? I was insulating that you were downvoting me with alts because as soon as I commented I had 2 downvotes lol
---
Well shit. I’m sorry dude I read it wrong.
---
The “actions” in justifying here is literally the killers only objective. I’m not out here advocating shitty or toxic ways to play.
---
I’m not going to tell you how to play but for me, whether or not strangers had fun isn’t a priority.
---
 What were they?
---
Not really, even with infantry you would usually take a little bit longer to get that hit and have 2 more ready to go without having to reload.
---
Exactly I feel like this one is either you get it stealthy, or trick a survivor of being nice for it.
---
Ignore the mind game part that’s my bad
---
Maybe they are actually real.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/103996/developer-update-november-2019#latest

I mean it already happens in game, although very rarely, but I can see it being a huge problem for her.
---
I see this as a win, now the changes don’t seem nearly as bad right?

 Now this is peek comedy

You're such a saint

it's neat but i think you could have chose a better font imo
---
Moris are just as bad
---
Don’t worry about it
---
Well waking up will half the amount of debuffs you have but other than that i dont know what else you can do other than also letting the obsession die
---
nope :3
---
TBH she's apparently one of the strongest killers right now, but I still have a hard time getting 4Ks and my internet service hates DBD in particular and doubles my ping compared to every other game.
---
Its not so bad w swf, but horrible solo. They need to make them difficult but not borderline impossible solo. If these ones are too hard you might as well give up on thr 3rd and 4th levels, they are much harder, and it's a shame it's like this.
---
Dude are you 11 years old? What the hell are you even trying to type
---
Why is using noed a bad thing? Almost every survivor i encounter use meta perks. Why cant killers do the same?
---
That helps a lot, but it still looks like it is controlled by the killer, the challenge in itself is not impossible, just annoying to have it in your mind while running the killer and being aulturistic.
---
Then dont do them. That simple.
---
Yeah seriously. So many survivors think it's tunneling when you follow the guy sprinting out in the open towards the hook. You don't just get to unhook for free that's not how this works. If I get a chance I'm going to smack the injured person too assuming I can trigger Borrowed. I think this mentality comes down to survivors not understanding what it's like to play killer (vice versa obviously exists too for killer-only mains) but hopefully Archives helps expose people to the other side.
---
What are the nerfs?
---
Holy Shit, if this isn’t bait, i feel bad for you,
---
I’m a survivor main and think the spirit nerf was good enough
---
Happens every time
---
Sick killer moment starter pack: ruin, pop, bbq, spirit standing still spam, mori, purple addon spam, getting mad at me accidentally pressing ctrl key once while I was reaching to scratch my leg LULW
---
Earn four times as many bloodpoints.
---
&gt; ^^"lol ^^here's ^^an ^^extra ^^10k"
---
It is possible it picks one at the start, but noed will always pick an unlit totem of available. If all 5 totems are broke, it does nothing
---
That ain’t going to do shit, keep being a salty crybaby cunt.
---
I used to full on give wins when someone dc'd but now I've started just letting the last survivor go if it's only one dc
---
This is pathetic.
---
*^yikes*
---
Run around the map (avoiding the killer of course) once you finish a gen, using bond find a gen that is being worked on by a survivor and help them out until its done. Repeat until third gen is done and huzzah!
---
Idk if that would work never tried it :p
---
You obviously don’t need to play this game
---
&gt;There was no mass call to nerf nurse or spirit.
---
Well, if there was, you should have no issue whatsoever showing that mass call to me, since it should basically be impossible not to find due to its very nature.
---
I have certainly seen many people argue for and against Spirit being overpowered and needing changes, she is certainly a controversial character. But "mass calls", concerted efforts to get her nerfed? That is actually pretty delusional. There is not a single mass-upvoted thread that actually calls for Spirit nerfs on this subreddit that I could find. (You will on the contrary notice that this subreddit is notably killer-biased, and many of the mass-upvoted things here follow a "killer good; survivor bad" tendency.)
---
\&gt;There are still just as many nurses running around or should i say slowly floating around since her nerf.
---
I don't have numbers to verify either way whether Nurse now sees more or less play, but my point was more that Nurse is still ridiculously powerful. I do know for a fact that the players that were good Nurses before still demolish with her now.
---
\&gt; queue as killer and immediately coming to as i find a lobby 
---
I explained that there was a recent queue system change that has indeed improved killer queue times, to the detriment of survivor queue times. Killer queue times had been notoriously bad for months and months before, and they still absolutely are at times. I queue faster as survivor at night than as killer, for instance. The introduction of the Archives has obviously also led to changes in queue behaviour.
---
\&gt; at rank 1 i see so many wraith, clown, and doctor players
---
Like with Nurse, I wasn't really talking about frequency at which these killers are played, but the frequency at which they kill survivors if they are played. Which is over 50% for all of them. This to argue against the notion popular on this subreddit that killers are weak and get beaten and bullied all the time, implied in your "fun and fair" remark. Statistically, things appear to actually be unfair for survivor players, even in red ranks.
---
Waking up would only take one debuff away, swings is on whether you're asleep or awake
---
BHVR fucked up a lot of stuff over the years. Whoever came up with this ranking system is in a league of their own though.
---
NOED... im sorry but... NOED 1 shot down and speed boost? Might as well say, you dont know how to play, youre really boosted and bad, couldnt catch anyone all game BUT here’s a free kill. 
---
Not to mention Rancor. Literally my first game against rancor, no hooks... all chases went really well. Not one survivor dead... last gen pops she comes for me and mori... free kill
---
Diffrent platform player i guess
---
Spain.
---
nothing. But i like it to much not to give it a like
---
And that is being his ability? Weak spot: tier 1 myers stab distance
---
Or legions button

Well then they have to win the chase- find a nearby set of pallets and windows, get the killer out of the advantageous position, then get back to the hatch with plenty of time to hop in after using your key (it's quite a fast animation). The whole point of closing the hatch is denying survivors an effortless exit, which keys defy; a punishment for extremely poor key usage would give them at least SOME semblance of skill and give killers a tiny bit more control over the game (something that anyone not named spirit or nurse desperately needs).
---
The entitlement of survivors with their 306 made up rules that you have to follow is ridiculous these days. Above rank 15 if you don't let them escape no matter how fair you play and avoid camping/tunneling, they still can't handle a loss. They'll still use borrowed time and destrike and cry about noed too.
---
Maybe ninja works for the family, xD JK
---
Then in that case you completely rely on your friend or randoms, witch is less fun for solos
---
It isn't far fetched to assume if your parents raise you a certain way and teach you acceptable ideas that you'll run with it. I don't think you should judge a person based on the country they're born in, if you had read what I said than you'd understand that stereotypes are only logical because you're shaped by your environment and the demographic that you're a part of. 
---
Russian people tend to have shorter tempers than others,  that isn't to say that's all Russian people have short tempers, but that's something you'd likely have to deal with being a tourist in Russia or in this case playing games with Russian people that fall under this stereotype. 
---
Your race is a defining feature of who you are, and you should always wear that with pride. The stereotypes that come with your race were created by years and years of history, and there are some cultural behaviors that deserve ridicule. 
---
I believe that the way women are treated in Saudi Arabia is something worth giving ridicule. I would say it's safe to say that some men from Saudi Arabia have been particularly awful to women in their country. I also believe circumcision should be a choice and that Jewish people deserve some sort of ridicule for this practice. I would also say it's safe to say that many Jewish families circumcise their children simply because that's the way they were told is a normality. I think it's wrong that uncircumcised boys in Israel are bullied in school because of this cultural issue.
---
I don't base my social interaction with anyone of any race based on my beliefs or stereotypes I've learned. I base it on who they are as a person. I have friends that have circumcised their kids, I'm friends with men who's wives wear abayas and hijabs. I don't think sharing how you feel about a stereotype and experiencing someone behaving a stereotype is racist at all.
---
A lot of the survivor challenges are just "play like a rank 20 idiot"
---
Okay, so saying that I'm not gonna go easy on survivors because they lost a player, and that I'm picking spirit to make the most use out of the 2-3 good killers we have to try to even the odds a little bit at least is toxic... But your constant sarcasm, and projecting isn't? On top of that, you're trying hard to strawman as well (which isn't really working). 
---
This reminds me a lot about the whining in post lobby when survivors get mad because I killed them.
---
Also, I wasn't being rude, it's not my fault you're so hypersensitive, and you're the one who jumped in to my comment, so you're basically putting a target on yourself, so if you can't handle it, you shouldn't have hopped in. My comment wasn't directed at anyone spesific.
---
I don't "only remember the ones who are bad". It's even so rare, that on my stream we have a small reward system for anyone who actually do say gg, if it wasn't rare, I would be ruined by now. So once again, you're making shit up and projecting.
---
And theres a wild difference between running up to the killer suiciding, and abusing the fact that you can genrush, have a coordination of a fucking swat team (there's a reason there's no voice communication in the game, because it's op as fuck), and then straight up holding the game hostage because you don't like the killer. The fact that you're denying that there's a big favouring going on In DbD says more about your knowledge of ability to be objective. I know that spirit is a bitch to play against, I have no issue admitting that. My problem is that every time behaviour actually does listen to the killers issues with the game, they solve it by adding a new problem. The nurse was added to lighten the chace, the clown was added to counter infinite loops, ruin was added to slow down the genrush. Never have they actually dealt with the issue directly. They add shit that limits killers even more. Ruin is almost mandatory on every killer, taking away a perk slot. And other killers are practically useless in low ranks. But when there's a slight upset about ONE killer, behaviour doesn't add something to counter it, nono, they go straight to the source.
---
Why is that? Well duh, favourism.
---
The fact that you can't even admit that, and start projecting, being sarcastic, strawmanning and calling my complaint being toxic says more about you than anything else.
---
Nah you’re just entitled. Any killer can run whatever they want. It’s your job as a survivor to... survive. If you lose, make better plays. Run better perks. You’re not always going to win
---
All you need is a school starter pack
---
You forgot -- "The killer is playing Legion"
---
Is it certain this is a hacker?  After a vault yesterday I ended up with an amazing speed boost.  I'm talking circle the map edge in 3 or 4 seconds.  It's a bug.  A lot of people have already reported it, along with myself.
---
I have a better idea delete your account and delete the game form your desk top then suck a dick you cry baby bitch boy
---
There are indicators, music, footsteps and her animation. Git gud scrub.
---
I feel like nightmare freddy would fit better.
---
Maybe
---
Try prayer beads spirit
---
You sure? Last I read it only worked while asleep, in that case yeah you could also let the obsession die although I personally wouldnt do that
---
Incredible hit!
---
Yeeeeeeee
---
Spirit: "I came here to escape you! Why are you following me?!"
---
Family: *cat*
---
Very accurate!
---
The fear vomit sound is the best
---
Could be a part of his username
---
It would counter ds
---
That’s the cross play sign, you’re playing with someone on the windows store.
---
It's not a side effect and not unexpected. The archive was designed for this very reason.
---
Sweet!
---
Me no play spirit me no care
---
or have the ability for survivors to pick up weapons and use them aganist killers like in ft13
---
Honestly, it feels like the changes touched everything *but* her one major issue, which is a massive over-reliance on Iron Will to facilitate any form of counterplay.
---
Running through her is lovely and will stop the occasional free hit, but consistently good Spirits are still gonna tear just as much ass since you're still just as easy a target while injured as before.
---
Additionally, the Prayer Beads changes are good, but their lethality and prevalence are overstated as **fuck** on these boards by every lazy asshole who wants a little free karma with a "gee, aren't Prayer Beads bad guys?" shitpost. Mother-Daughter Ring still fucks like the government, and the minor changes to her charge time are inconsequential compared to the massive boost in map pressure and chase potential you gain.
---
Dollars to donuts the complaints about Spirit continue just as strong post-patch.
---
I don't see how I'm entitled for not wanting to face an ebony mori and annoying perks at rank 13. I never said they can't run certain things. I'm just upset that it's not fun to play against.
---
Usually when it’s 2 I just end up patrolling the gens neither of them can really leave unless those are complete or through the hatch and if they manage to go through it.. can’t do much about it.. I mean if getting that 4K is what you thrive for then just do you I guess
---
My favourites are Legion and Ghostface the brutal stabby stabby energy they have just makes me happy
---
This is why I stopped running Kindred. It makes no difference if your teammates are potatoes you'll still get farmed or stage 2 on first hook.
---
It’s definitely killer dependant, you have to have either a fantastic movement ability or massive map pressure for it to work. I don’t run it on Freddy and i still annihilate. And the other 2 as said. Possibly hillbilly too. But any single note killer that doesn’t have a shit ton of pressure but easy counter play needs it. Leatherface, huntress, clown, ghostface (imo), trapper, legion. Obviously some can use corrupt as another alternative but they’re very easy to gen rush most games. However it actually makes the games more enjoyable overall, as it increases the gameplay time, and no one like a fast ended killer game where the generators go by extremely quickly. This is why it’s needed, ruins not needed necessarily but it just makes every killer twice as viable as it gives you sooooo much time.
---
Damn that’s not really a nerf, just a rework that makes things different. Spirit mains will still be just as strong
---
oooooooooooooo
---
Have you ever seen Spirit from the killer's prospective? it's not a teleport
---
Pop doesn't counter gen rushes as it only effects one gen and requires you to down and hook a survivor.
---
&gt;survivors complain about how a killer plays because the killer CAN control that, but chooses to play in a scummy manner when there is a DC.
---
This is exactly what I'm talking about. It's not my fault someone DC'd and I don't intend to play any different because it happened. Yeah it sucks for the survivors but that is quite literally not my problem but for some reason survivors feel entitled to get free farm because of it when I just want to play the game I queued for.
---
Yeah I mean killers are all runnab... oh nvm it's Freddy
---
If a survivor dcs I may be nice but I'm sure as hell not farming, I'm gonna get into chases and play normally. Maybe I'll just keep slugging and never hook anyone, or at the end just give the last survivor hatch.
---
"You never learned greater than/less than symbols, did you? "
---
But HE started to be hostile ! Not me !
---
Grow up
---
Legion is punished for using his power
---
If they made the glass glow more easily noticeable itd be an improvement honestly
---
Ok boss. we'll see how many people will play Spirit after a month from the ner
---
So it's a social standard I have to stand around for 10 minutes and let people drop pallets on me because someone disconnected else I get called out for it? 
---
No, fuck that farming as a killer is boring.
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
“KeYs ArE OKaY”
---
Because its not likely to happen again this is most likely a one off so you should still participate instead of being sour over it
---
Get hooked, see your teammates auras....
---
They're all crouching at separate corners of the map.
---
"Guess I'm dying on my first hook"
---
Completely agree. I don't need a match handed to me on a silver platter, and it's pretty pathetic to punish a team for something out of their control. Everyone walking out with some BP and a good time isn't too bad a trade off for not getting to wank myself off about how good I am for merking a 3-man team.
---
Honestly, I wish there was a mode in Custom Game that allows survivors to practice hitting skill checks. It would help playing against Hex Ruin or a 5 token Hex Lullaby.
---
Hey yo why you gotta call me out like that. :;(∩´﹏`∩);: yet again you aren’t wrong. 🤷🏽‍♀️
---
At what fucking point did I say Teleport?
---
"Forced"
---
It's needed because gens are too fast.
---
Every fckn time....
---
Ok but are you an EPIC GAMER?
---
What's the legacy?
---
Best comment I've ever seen
---
Entity Displeased? What in gods fucking left ass cheek were you supposed to do god I fucking has keys like imagine being able to leave the game before doing all the gens being seen as a fair and fun mechanic
---
**reworkthenbufflegion**
---
not my fault you can’t hide lol get back on your hook
---
What’s wrong with Doctor? This isn’t a joke or anything, he’s my second most played killer and I’m just curious.
---
Now this is the DBD of my dreams.
---
Okay, then they release all the legacy cosmetics. See how THAT goes.
---
Not an asshole, sure, but don't kid yourself into thinking you're anywhere near remotely skilled at the game if you need your competition to be kneecapped just to score a kill.
---
Let this meme die, Please god let it die
---
Healing, probably.
---
Don’t forget Clown.
---
I wish we could get some "universally" (within reason) understanding that spamming the start of "attempt escape" while on hook meant stay away and go be productive.
---
The entire flow of the game would need to change to support that. Games of DBD move a lot faster than games of FT13
---
I haven't played her yet but I'm just hopeful the fanbase will simmer down about her. She's one of my favorite character based on lore so it's really sucked seeing much hate because of how her game mechanics shaked out
---
Personally I'm a little bummed I can't use Yakuyoke for a full kit boost, and I'm surprised that the Wakizashi lines got minimized because I never saw those as competitively oriented perks. I will miss the sheer pantshitting jumpscares of a good Wakizashi Spirit
---
Imagine defending keys being able to do this he shouldn’t need to stop keys because keys shouldn’t be able to do this
---
Is that Theo von
---
&gt; Free Space (Ruin)
---
I love it.
---
This one wins. We can stop with the meme now.
---
Seriously though how many times did you start laughing while drawing that?
---
It happened to me too.  As Nea on MacMillan, I vaulted right as Adam got hit by the trapper next to me.  Talk about some serious speed!!!  Killer said I was cheating.  I told him my userID and that I was sending in a bug report and asked if he would too.  No response.
---
IIRC there are more bloodpoints to earn. Hardly a great reward, but it’s something.
---
Firstly what music and animations. Lighting up shards dont do much because of several skins and when u can hear footsteps she is literally up ur but so with her sprint burst after you wont do much omegalul
---
Nah I’m a casual gamer, just above average
---
She now has a vault animation, no collision while phasing, and comes out of phasing similar to how wraith comes uncloaked now. Most of the best addons also got their stats nerfed.
---
Exactly, I said it would balance itself slightly
---
I always run franklin's.   It generates more salt than noed.
---
What? You get 50%/75%/100% extra BPs in all categories just for playing the game. That alone is a good reason to use it. People can run whatever perk they want for whatever reason they want. Complaining about it will only cause more division in this community.
---
Oh shit theres a dark sense challenge, I'm gonna start using rancor to scare survivors
---
yeah don’t play nurse on console unless you want the feeling of never playing the game again. Because that is how bad you will be bullied
---
As a person who leveled up trapper for this my ass is also loving it
---
You realize how slow tapping the gens is?
---
Reminds me of this game I had when I was leveling Bubba for BBQ teachable. Had this Ace running a item hunting build and every time I found him I'd just knock whatever new thing he had out of his hands with Franklin's. It was like I was beating up a Doable 3 treasure goblin.
---
I remember during the pre game chat I told everyone in the lobby that I needed to heal them for the archive mission and EVERYONE said "ok" so when I go ingame there was one guy who wouldn't let me heal him and he kept healing himself. In the post chat, I asked him why he wouldn't let me heal him and he's like, "oh I need to heal myself for the self care challenge". I legit smh and hit my desk because of how stupid this guy was. He legit said nothing about it and then what was worse is that he called me an idiot for not realizing he had the challenge.
---
It's like you say she is op because you dislike Spirit in the first place. That's not a good way to counter an argument about balance but ok, goodbye.
---
That's not the point I'm getting at. The fact that the end portion of a winning killer game 9/10 times HAS to turn into slugging the 3rd survivor to find the 4th and/or hatch to guarantee a 4k is one of the most boring aspects of the match from both killer and survivor perspective.
---
That would be neat, but keep in mind that Trapper isn’t always carrying a trap, so his mori can’t involve traps.
---
Post-game chat: GG EZ  get rekt noob killer.
---
But they dont lit up xD. And yeah music i think i would have heard the difference
---
"why do they struggle"
---
"why do they run across the map when I'm gonna give hatch"
---
"god survivors always try hard when I'm clearly being nice"
---
Also Killer Mains...
---
I implore you to go back and read our conversation. I think you have me mixed up with another person.
---
I'd be good with that.  It's just way too often that you know a ghostface/myers is camping around a corner waiting for the unhook and there's no good way to make them stop coming after you.  
---
I had a match the other day where leatherface hooked me in the basement and then sat around the back wall with Insidious and ended up with a 4K in the basement as 1 by 1 someone came to rescue people and got chopped down immediately.
---
I LOVE THIS
---
No next chapter
---
I bet it’s because people think you’re being toxic and mocking them. I say GG all the time on multiple games and get hate responses back or threats of reporting.
---
Those are some mad skills
---
Getting some serious Lamb Chop's Play Along vibes xD. 
---
This would be a dark fkin episode though.
---
I dont u all want to kill people play nurse jeez she s at least fun to play against a  bit
---
That’s because she was taken by the Entity a moment before death. And if you don’t like killers that look dead, stay away from Nurse. She’s pretty much just a levitating, slouching corpse that occasionally moves.
---
I really hope the actor is working with them to make Quentin actually look like him. The actor is cute AF.
---
Yeah, Hag and Doctor come free with the console version. Same with their respective survivors. Idk exactly why they made the choice to give them away for free but they did.
---
This great and all but one problem the Clown is not T H I C C enough (no this is great job)
---
The game should take these types of missions and add them naturally to the game. For example, if you can manage to not spend bloodpoints and for each 200k milepoint you will be granted an extra 100k bloodpoints.
---
Huh.
---
You absolute cunt
---
Why do you argue about balance if you don't even play the game? what are you trying to prove, that you are a good player because you can make theory based on what's in the wikipedia? everyone can do that.
---
That was 200IQ but I cant help but feel sad for the  boy.
---
Unless it’s on first hook
---
Oh so with her father (at least that's what people have been saying
---
They instahealed everytime they were hit
---
Totally outgamered them right then and there
---
Haha nice eye it could be more of a shitpost
---
Every game in a nutshell
---
NOED is punishment for Gen Rushing.  
---
Simply put, if you ain't cleansing dem bones, you run the risk of NOED. Clean bones, no NOED.
---
I wouldn't bother with these two anymore, Zargoss. What you said was fair, logical, and an overall great explanation for the distinction between stereotyping and racism. It's difficult to say why they're so quick to jump the gun and establish the high ground. Lack of education? Lack of a logical thought process?
---
We'll never know, but this post isn't racist by any means. At no point did the OP say "all russians, no matter who or where they're from, are toxic". He said, "based on my games, this is my experience so far". Massive difference between speculation and outright prejudice.
---
They are objectives if you want to be sure to counter NOED.
---
It was a generalized idea, I said "something like" as if not to be a definitive reward. I thought 200 Auric Cells per piece would be alright, that would mean I would make 1,000 Auric Cells totally for free, which would mean a free Rift Pass. The days of infinites are over, it was rough, but the game has changed to be far more fair and while it still has it's problems I think we've been rewarded plenty just by this game living on and becoming something greater. Seeing the potential early and looking past all the unbalanced stuff in the beginning in my opinion isn't worth much, I obviously didn't spend the time grinding for all the skins because I didn't want to play an unbalanced mess of a game. So I'd be happy with what I suggested, perhaps it should be more, but I'd be content with having the Legacy skins come back. I think it would be ideal to allow further prestieging beyond prestige three and have the Legacy skins behind that, so you'd essentially have to spend double the time getting them.
---
Wait a few days, or try to rank up. All the facecamping baby killers will be dropped into rank 20 eventually.
---
The devs do dumb shit all the time, lets be real. They're barely competent half the time. Also when did I say anything about a 4k? Sounds like a whiny survivor main who thinks everyones out to get them, sit down.
---
If you have an opinion that most people have the polar opposite of, your best bet would be to not state your opinion as fact. People tend to be more willing for discussion or more willing to listen that way.
---
I agree, but calling toxic people idiots will just make them more toxic and harsh.
---
Story time: I was playing Myers yesterday and got into a pallet standoff with a nea. I managed to 99 my tier 3 and stared at her a few more seconds to mindgame her. Managed to get her down and her idiot friend who tried to pallet stun me when I was still in the animation. I ended up getting pushed into her and got her as well
---
We need more optimists like you in this community.
---
Owe I didn’t know this! I retract my last statement!
---
You could always ask the other survivors to join you. You typically don’t win sabo games, but they can be fun and new for both killer and survivor
---
Does anyone have the source to the planned doctor changes? I've seen a couple posts about this and am interested in what was said.
---
So toxic!
---
I like the logs that you can vault over on the swamp. It's essentially just a window but it's adds more visual variety which I really like.
---
Pig's base kit is really solid.
---
Her add ons are absolute garbage and need a rework. Half of her add-ons are for making hatted Survivors easier to tunnel, which is the last thing you want to do.
---
I tested in both corn and grass and no movement. Not even with wraith. Wonder if it is a bigger issue.
---
You didn’t give me enough info to work with, but it sounds like a console problem. Specifically with *your* console. How old is it?
---
What’s the song name? I’ve heard it before on VRChat but never found it.
---
also it would be cool if we  could actually sacrifice survivors by hand rather than just placing them on meathooks. Maybe after the sacrifice meter on hooks is complete than the killer would have to manually place them off the hook and mori the survivor . of course this would require other changes to balance it but it would give it a slasher movie vibe rather than some gamey sacrifice process.
---
This made me lol
---
I only think cross platform would be good between xbox and ps4
---
Look up MC Mental on YouTube, you should find it pretty quick.
---
So? That proves my point, you're not supposed to 4K every game, and no, survivors' perks, even if they are 4, don't suddenly multiply because they are 4.
---
If they also reworked it so he's like Hag, Freddy, Pig, and he just starts with all his traps, and always has one on his belt for mori use, that makes it simple.
---
what the hell are splinters?
---
I must sound like a shit player. I think I’m better than most players but often fandoms will make choices that I think....why? Or...that wasn’t smart.
---
That’s why I said code wise
---
The taller locker is actually top of a little mound of dirt that is hidden by the grass. It always spawns like that on this map in particular.
---
Not every killer needs map pressure, and the game is going to get boring as shit if everyone gets a teleport.
---
Clown doesn't need map pressure, he needs to be scary as shit in a Chase.
---
Ok I agree that these latest updates have fucked the audio though. There is definitely a problem with the sound. But when it's working, then Spirit becomes very easy no?
---
Sick, ty. May your crops be bountiful my friend.
---
No it wouldn’t? It would still activate against stealth killers, it’s just a little less forgiving.
---
Pretty sure it's supposed to be done over multiple rounds
---
What has skill checks been added onto?
---
Most Legions run Sloppy Butcher/Thanataphobia. By the time you're done healing they're right on top of you again with an easy free hit. If you're already injured their power is worthless.
---
Wait what? I thought the context of the real story was something else.
---
I love Freddy the way he is except for slow progress Freddy. Holding M1 for longer isn't fun or engaging as it already is. Understandable for some slowdown, but Freddy's is crazy.
---
I love that he has tools to aid in chase in a significant way and a teleport.
---
I like that Borrowed Time is actually Borrowed Time against Freddy. If in the basement, run your ass as far away from the basement to prevent the same situation. Only Wraith and Ghostface can really have the same effect as Freddy against Borrowed Time.
---
Yet another reason to not even bother with stalking as GF
---
I've ran across tons of cool ppl killers giving the hatch or just letting you escape cause you were the last person. Its rare but i always appreciate it . I haven't seen gestures like this in other games &amp; its refreshing.
---
Im guessing the addons that let you play DLC characters without buying them for a game.
---
Its not my console.Evetything else runs great.Only this piece of shit runs like garbage.Everytine I press a button to continue or exit a menu or pressing triangle to get into a game the screen freezes for a few seconds.Aside that I get unknown errors,NAT errors,internet errors and every kind of error this game has.
---
It is not the console.Every other online game runs great no problem.But this is atrocious.
---
He even says in his videos his way of playing isn’t effective
---
It pretty much forces the killer into tunneling the obsession or else the massive amount of info it gives will utterly destroy their chances of victory. ESPECIALLY if its a SWF.
---
I am NOT looking forward to the "Escape without being hooked with spine chill" one in level 3. Expect a shitton of claudettes running Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Sole Survivor, and Left Behind + a key literally just hiding (never rescuing, healing, or touching a gen) and waiting for everyone else to die to grab hatch. If the killer finds them they'll just DC and jump into a new match to try again. 
---
There's also a hook 2 people in the basement at the same time with Monstrous Shrine. It's as if the devs are too lazy to find a way to buff Monstrous Shrine so they'll just make a challenge forcing people to use it, and it'll go from one of the least used perks to a semi-often used one (for the challenge) so the devs can claim people are using it and it doesn't need a rework. At least basement bubba mains will be happy.
---
Hex: No one escapes disconnects

Okay, fr though. Try lightweight, don't sprint everywhere but move around, don't go for unhook until she's used her phase or is far away, and keep healed. And if she does use her phase in a chase, stop sprinting, hide and don't make noise. Premonition/spine chill help too.
---
hag, strong killer with one of the strongest perks in the game (ruin)
---
I mean, doing the cat was kinda funny xD 
---
And seeing how the face of the meme fit so well with the Spirit was something I didn’t expect
---
I never thought Doctor needed a buff, mind you though, last time I played him was October/November 2017 just when Freddy was released, so not many Killers were in the roster
---
I tried playing him the other day for a Daily, he's actually terrible. Like, base kit has no range. He gets looped, HARD. even when using his shock properly, his shock feels like it has little mindgaming.... Nothing happened with him either, he just fell off hard (always knew he was worse than others but boy, he wasn't that bad in 2017)  
---
I need Doctor changes and buffs, stat.
---
I like how you downvote every comment i do without any argomentation just because you are mad at me for being right. I find that funny lol, karma points and reputation on reddit is more important to you than being honst with yourself. Stay low rank and keep making memes, thats where you shine probably
---
No it wouldn’t? It would still activate against stealth killers, it’s just that it would be less cushion-y.
---
She is the most common survivor so more likely to see 4 of her than anyone else
---
Iron will actually. Until they lower her obscene volume when injured I’m never taking it off my load out.

Has A Flashback while in Mid Chase with this Myers and then it hits again!

“FEELS LIKE IM WEARING NOTHING AT ALL,  NOTHING AT ALL, NOTHING AT ALL”

With the image of Flander/Myers ass moving back and forth again...

Lmao true
---
healing against legion is generally seen as useless because he can so easily chain hits to injure EVERYONE.
---
.-. It's just a meme about how just about everything has em' and that they aren't exactly all that great not that anything new has them. Although I'm sure something will pop up soon enough. They always do.
---
Nope, new objective is get the game finished as quickly as possible and escape from this dumpster fire of a match.
---
Gotta admit, they suckered me in, then that small edit took it home in Grand style. Well done OP
---
Maybe the updates somehow corrupted the game for you. Have these problems been happening to you for a while, or did it all start within the past few weeks?
---
That's the issue, more killers would be popular if they were stronger. I just want to be able to "expand my portfolio" without getting slapped in the ass at rank 1.
---
If there's a dc and ive smoked some weed, you know your boys gonna meme with some survivors
---
Pc exclusive.
---
Jesus how fragile can someone be because another player pressed a button multiple times in a game?

That baby Dweet drawing is adorable.

You know they were out of ideas and thought the web looked a little empty....

Figures. Thanks mate

I can't remember the last time I was called a camper. Usually whoever the 4th person I killed and maybe one other just says gg.

Haddonfield is only one thing. What's the problem about closing BS windows on Irownworks/Suffocation Pit/Rancid Abattoir/Torment Creek etc
---
Swf is countering playing I am stupid I never think in that
---
This morning I asked a Claudette why she suicided on hook after getting found first... she just replied .. ez... so yeah, 9 times out of ten you’re just dealing with morons.
---
It was always pretty bad but I got used to it being the great game we all love to hate but it got so much worse with the archives.So many errors
---
Right now, it is only if your in their terror radius (you can hear a heartbeat)
---
Sick mask. I wish I could hand on it
---
Standing still is not a visual cue, because she may be just standing still ;)

One thing about keys needs to be changed, and that's that closing a key opened hatch powers the gates. Other than that, I think they're fine.  People overreact to keys so much, because they think they're somehow getting kills that they "should have gotten" stolen. IMO, if one or two survivors escape with a key then that's whatever. If 3-4 escape thru hatch, it's because I failed my job as a killer, not because keys are broken.
---
Then don't miss
---
Every time someone DCs, the killers I get facecamp. It’s better to just leave the match altogether once it happens.
---
You actually only need to complete 3 gens meaning you can do that by joining a gen at 99% and completing it. Do that 3 times and you got the challenge. I did it like that.
---
Because you're not holding an item when you die.
---
White Ward brings out whatever item you're holding when you die. Franklin's counters it since you can't hold that item when you get hooked.
---
So basically you want more killer perks that rely on losing the game rather than perks that prevent all the gens from being done before all the survivors are dead. And you want them to be perks survivors can easily counter, especially at higher ranks where the majority of players do totems when they see them.
---
Please make new posts I'm begging you guys. I'm not disparaging your opinions I'm just SO tired of 'killers whine too much' followed by 'survivors whine to much' followed by 'killers whine too much' followed by 'survivors wh-
---
i agree! it really goes well since its so feral and unhinged, my 2nd favorite is ghostface’s mori. it kinda makes me wish that more moris were this cool
---
With Instasaw, sure, otherwise he's probably the worst killer in the game
---
Can't throw out what was never there
---
Which give you more time to get more distance ;) you know her power isn't infinite right?
---
About.. 70% of the speed of a regular repair if done right
---
There isnt....
---
From the sounds of it no killer moves grass rn
---
I refer to the killers as my brothers or sisters lol.
---
Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying. Unless the killer is tunneling people off hooks, there is no reason for survivors to be rushing gens beyond normally "just doing gens"
---
I'm talking bring Prove thyself and a toolbox to every match and cooperating with your SWF buddies to finish off 1 gen at a time in 30 seconds
---
If the Survivors aren't out the gate, you haven't lost the game yet.
---
As a ghost face player, I can confirm it’s hell.
---
He stayed and played the rest of the game. Just didn't get us again. One of our teammates just kinda did the "I'm gonna hide in the bushes and not do anything rate of play" So we decided to find that player (Claudette) and pulled a "Good Luck Frieza" and took off!
---
The Killer got theirs!
---
You're good my dude, it wasn't an issue. Complaints might be from how common it is or from people who don't know its counter are my guesses.
---
Time to farm
---
The 2nd and 3rd perk need to swap names.
---
If the bps grind wasnt so terrible people would stop using bbq. Its just too bag wglf doesnt also offer some sort of survivor benefit like bbq does to killers.
---
Holy shit a random Umbra appears
---
Thought*
---
Are you sure it's not confirmed?
---
Also, I like how people are taking this seriously.
---
God I want susie to mori me
---
Are you sure about that?
---
Is it really unknown?
---
You sure?
---
How many points did ya get?
---
Since the rerank the other day, I’ve been getting people who just try to unhook themselves and then don’t tap when they need to struggle. Others are just DCing outright or going AFK.
---
It makes it impossible to rank up in some cases because those are two hooks you can’t save and end up losing points on.
---
Why don't you downvote every comment i ever made? It's a good use of your time, Ciao btw. Yes i'm italian, buonasera
---
Tbh when I see that happening to someone, I stop chasing and give them a head start
---
Remove Legion :)
---
I'd give it a nice out of ten
---
Depends, can you teach me how to talk out of my ass like you can?
---
it's a shitty and forced meme. it has funny at the start when people used it to describe the 10% of actually whiny/ brainless survivors but it's long past it's expiration date, especially since people with &lt;200 hours come here thinking they know everything
---
Did you find what you was looking for?
---
These are the matches where I usually get the killer who literally is like ''Time to sweat like Jane Fonda in the 80s."  and every survivor has like 1-8,000 points at most and the killer has a near perfect score.
---
Well you got a chuckle out of me good meme friend
---
they didnt farm and I got bullied because my ruin got destroyed but I got 170k with bbq
---
If I see a key In that hand, I’m face camping, no question
---
Damn. You're right.
---
I wish they'd specify that better. Thankfully I completed it that game but damn.
---
I've put &gt;1500 hours into this game, I'm not stopping now. Especially not with a community this ignorant.
---
You should've seen the OTHER perk ideas I had!
---
Haha haha survivor bad and entitled, killer gud haha
---
But if the work to get then was similarly difficult I don't see a huge problem with it. I understand that facing Survivors against infinite loops and other nonsense like that no longer exists so it wouldn't be nearly as difficult, but if it was the same grind and you had to get say the same amount you had to originally then I feel like it would be okay. You sound like you have all of the skins, I only have some of them, but if you're someone like me who has supported the game and been through hell with the rest of you, but to a lesser extent, I don't mind having an opportunity to get the rest and opening up that challenge to the community.
---
I don’t know I thought the use of spongebob and Patrick kept it pretty fresh. 
---
I mean it’s a talking sponge dude
---
Considering how quiet Ace is when injured, Jane has NO reason to be as loud as she is
---
I keep getting those even though I have every killer. It's honestly super frustrating because I'd much rather see a perk or Mori in my bloodweb over a splinter
---
I'd rather see more Survivor perks that incentivizes cleansing totems, if I'm being honest.
---
I'd rather see something like Thrill of the Hunt that grants Survivors 20 percent bonus bloodpoints at the end of the game if you cleanse a totem, and has a counter that tells you how many totems are left.
---
&gt; I always hate the "us against them" mentality
---
So... should every game be the killer and survivors working together?
---
I mean , it helps your killing claudette. But naw, hag all the way.
---
No killers should have a hard counter. All killers should have an advantage. An asymmetrical game requires different balance. In a game like this, it should slightly favor the killer.
---
It's an older meme, sir, but it checks out.
---
You must be new if you think these are anything other than very overpowered lol
---
He already has a lot of chase potential though
---
Can we get an F for this dudes spicy cheeks? I haven't seen this much butthurt in a while.
---
Always harder under pressure :(
---
I thought “10 years ago” meant “1990” for like 8 years 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
As i said I play her a lot and it's not hard to catch up with addons.
---
I get it. I'd be butthurt if they just released OG legacy outfits.
---
The allure is the rarity of it and the proof you progressed a lot when it was significantly hard to do so. If they just gave it away, both those things would no longer be true.
---
lmao wtf
---
Watch Otzdarva for the power of trapper, He's one of my favorite killer mains on Youtube. With the right perks/ addons, wraith is pretty strong too.
---
Pig is actually a really strong character, the traps slow down the game a lot and give you plenty of momentum, but I can't say much for legion, clown, or cannibal.
---
In a way, yes. But let’s clear one thing up here. Survivors haven’t “won” yet once all gens are complete. The game isn’t over. The goal of survivors is to escape and they haven’t won and the killer hasn’t lost until that happens. And yes, these perks are easily to counter but that’s the point. Most survivors don’t counter them though right now because only one perk activates when there are still dull totems and because it means investing valuable time into cleansing  them.  What these perks would accomplish is creating a deterrent even when none of them are being run because the threat of them is too large to risk them activating.
---
Ahaha, thank you anyway 😁
---
That's the thing that gets me the most. Bubba needs above or a rework the Pig needs an outright rework... the doctor severely needs a buff
---
the best thing of his mori, is that u can infinitely stomp a survivor head and hear his screams LOL
---
See, that's not bad at all.
---
I feel no hatred for those so beneath me. All I can feel is pity.
---
I don't really see the need to rush the challenges so I'm just kind of playing matches normally and trying to do bits when I can.  
---
At least before I get to the next Master Challenges.
---
Because it only protects something that you're holding, Franklins makes you drop items therefore there's nothing to protect when you die
---
Just buy a new flashlight
---
I mean trash design not power level.
---
KKonaW
---
Thank you have a nice day
---
How is it fun to play against when you’ve been kicking ass all game and you depip because a survivor had a key and two got out.
---
Eh,  it was just a concept. Gaining extra advantage at the expense of others. A really dumb concept. But you know what they say,  good ideas always start as shitty ones.
---
No it fine no one can draw the magnificent thickness of the clown no but seriously it really good it feel like artwork for a new cosmetic and your artwork fit in with the clowns map
---
When rule 34 says everything has porn, they mean everything.
---
and my point is that it's fine to do that as long as it's not the start of the game. If survivors are struggling to do gens and you're still focusing down the unhooked survivor, you're not doing it to ensure a pip.
---
Youre not in phase 2 hook, right? It only works if you havent been hooked yet.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
I agree the human interactions are always amazing and keep the game funny and enjoyable. I pallet stunned a ghost face picking up a killer and pointed at him and he shook his head up and down and I started dying laughing😂
---
&gt; for me huntress seemed op.
---
That’s all you had to saw
---
Great job!
---
I see, I assumed you were taking credit for it because of the "fan content" flair. My bad
---
Uh what? I only focus an unhooked survivor if im close enough to actually get their in time. Other wise obviously i want to patrol gens
---
r/DBDTrade
---
Did you buy the killers with auric cells instead of the actual chapter? I heard that those still appear when you do it that way.
---
That's a really Scotty McDirk thing to say...
---
Cross play hopefully soon it will be between Xbox and ps4 that would be dope
---
See I do this, and it works one killers at my rank \~15. Then I try it when SWF with my buddy who is 4-6 rank and um, they always get me.
---
Thankless job. I can't help but give hatch if I feel like the game was totally in my favor. Like hex ruin stayed up the whole game. If I suspect a baby survivor I'll drop them at hatch. The best advice I could give to Survivors to not wiggle last hook of match. Every time they don't struggle I think about giving hatch. I try my best not to tunnel but eventually survivors will start to take advantage of my generosity and start unhooking 5 sec after I leave hook.  Basically if the killer is treating your team with respect and you treat them with respect then the killer will play more loose and not so try hard. I always appreciated when I get TY GG for playing fair.
---
No hatches given. Never have, never will.
---
Yeah, I’m a potato and I wasn’t even aware they all had keys if I knew I would’ve just gone for M1’s the whole game :(
---
Here comes the trapper, don't step into his traps
---
When was this recorded?
---
Killers shouldn't have a lot of "endgame" perks because the killer shouldn't and isn't supposed to let the survivors get all the gens done. Current gen speed is a whole separate issue, but ideally the killer shouldn't get rewarded for the SURVIVORS completing their objective (essentially rewarding the killer for being bad). Survivors getting end game perks makes sense because they're being rewarded for playing well.
---
Killers should have more early game perks, because theres only really like 2 right now, Ruin and Corrupt Intervention.
---
People don't often get in lockers, and even if you don't plan on going after them, knowing where people is is a pretty strong tool to have. And the bloodpoints, my god the bloodpoints. 
---
Also every time people complain about BBQ, I just remember that it is promotes leaving the hook more than any other hook, save for maybe Devour Hope.
---
Dedicated Servers at their finest.
---
On the bright side at least everyone has to suffer with the issues, it's not just the Survivors being a slave to the Killer's connection.
---
Last night around... I'd say 10 PM pst on xbox
---
Well ofcourse, you can't attempt on the second hook...
---
Yeah, the whole game has been wonky since the release of "Stranger Things." SWF groups take 20 invites to get in the same damn lobby, then you get booted out after 2 matches, and dashboarding constantly. It's ridiculous. 
---
It feels like I'm playing Friday the 13th: The Game. Please figure out and fix, devs.
---
Actually, I like that addition. Now I can get behind that. &lt;3
---
I wasn’t aware they all had keys and yeah I probably should’ve went for more M1’s
---
It's only 15 seconds to open a gate. If you have at least 2 survivors left, a gate will get opened. If there isn't, then you don't need endgame perks anyway.
---
I need this template
---
That depends for me, if someone is farmed off the hook right after I hook them then I'll go for the farmer, no use punishing the poor bastard who did nothing wrong lol.
---
I could see it returning to normal while in a chase
---
Why u smacking your keyboard 🙄
---
This was on Xbox. I thought dedicated servers were just on PC for now
---
They also nerfed a few other addons like the Wakazashi which was needed.
---
had this problem too. 2 times. only quitting the game solves it. sad. hope they fix asap. ):
---
So at what level is it cool to use ebony mori? Also how can we know ahead of time which perks you find annoying? I don't want to ruin survivors games so i'm trying to learn what I can run and when.
---
You’re exactly right I just wasn’t paying attention stupid me
---
I know you are an epic gamer just for that username
---
Oh then they probably had a horrible Internet.
---
Do not thins so think it has to be a gen pallet or window but try
---
Ah. It's doubly confusing because the Complete 3 Generators daily ritual uses very similar language but the ritual instead requires cumulative repairs of 3 full generator progress bars.
---
I don’t know if this is still a thing or not, but I’d heard a day or two ago that you don’t actually need to heal yourself for the Self Care challenge. Apparently, as long as you have Self Care equipped and you get healed twice, it counts, even if you get healed by other people
---
It is only triggered if in the killers terror radius and that IS effected by any killer terror radius changes. Freddy for example does not have a terror radius for anyone that is asleep, so to trigger BT against Freddy, wake up first.
---
It's a very small step in the right direction, but yeah, the things that make her most bs to play against are still there in the game. But small steps are better than huge jumps just to make sure adjustments are being made the best way.
---
You would be surprised how many people do not know that. I have no advice for you then, unfortunately. I have never had the perk not work for me when I equipped it.
---
PARTY!!!!!!!!!!
---
\*Insert 2012 quality mw2 reaction to a trick shot\*

You're probably hearing the guy wiggling and not me but if the only thing you gotta say is that the keyboard is loud then mute it lol
---
The longer you live, the shorter time seems because each day is a smaller percentage of your life. When your 5, one year is 20% of your life, when your 20 then 1 year is 5%.

It's quite buggy sometimes....

I too sometimes find myself in situations where it only works on the third attempt or not all

xdddddd i am so funny xdddddd

Billy spirit  freddy and wraith with pink add on that was my day 0 ghostface

Yup ^

buff legion, cannibal, pig and clown

No platform is really a free speech platform.
---
Free speech applies to the government silencing you and nothing else.
---
That’s like saying that survivors shouldn’t have perks that activate when they are injured, hooked or downed. Say goodbye to unbreakable, deliverance, decisive strike, etc. Even if you’re a god at killer, survivors are going to get all the gens done a good portion of the time, it has less to do with how well the killer plays and more to do with how the survivors play. I’ll also say this again, the point of this post isn’t to say that killers need more tools to help them win after survivors finish gens, I’m saying that killers need a way to deter survivors from completing all the gens without cleansing totems.
---
Do u get broken status effect when u succed on the third one?
---
cus otherwise ur just lucky and gets the 4%
---
Fair enough
---
Nope, you're the one who's wrong mate. The hatch appears when there is 1 more gen completed than current survivors.
---
FYNNY FUBNY FDUNNY FUNNY I AM GOING TO LAUGH
---
Why do people complain about bbq? It’s not op it’s just Good and balanced
---
Oh awesome thank you! I haven't had a chance to play in the past few days so I didn't realise.
---
Simply uttering the word ‘Darn’ causes Freddy to stand completely still in stare into space for ~30 minutes, flashbacks of the endless number of tier lists with an ‘F’ Tier specially for him.
---
Due to unforeseen consequences
---
They need to do something. It's absolutely ridiculous.
---
Haunted Grounds.
---
Do you have a sudden fascination with fingers
---
Yeah, I’m more of a survivor main. I don’t have much for my killers haha
---
Yeah, i know. I have been playing the game for a lot of time, and I know devs delays anything they can. But now that it is being done at least, let us support them
---
What about it?
---
I mean a "Not funny didnt laugh" would have been enough, now you look like you had a seizure while writting this
---
You're welcome, as soon as you're level 47 in the rift you get all the serum you can earn.
---
I actually 360d a person while falling out of a window yesterday while thinking about highrise from that game LOL
---
A big hoe?
---
But enough about Kate.
---
I feel like keys aren't overly unfair. Because they require the hatch to spawn, which requires a certain amount of gens to be done. 4 players still alive, they need all the gens, plus the key, this seems pretty. 3 players need to do 4 gens, which again doesn't seem to bad. And with one person left the hatch always spawns to give them a chance to escape no key needed, which I think I totally fair, and can be countered by slugging when two people are left to deny the last guy hatch. 
---
The only case when it feels cheesy is with 2 survivors left. Getting 3 gens done against a good killer is still pretty easy as long as your team is ok. And if you happen to have a key you can get a really cheesy escape. Though I feel like this isn't overly common.
---
The obvious advice to deal with people who bring keys is to run Franklin's, but I guess that doesn't counter chests.
---
You'll be k
---
shit's gon be annoying as hell! RIP to our mental health lol
---
Lmao. LoOpinG tAkEs SkiLl
---
Some loops yes, but many in the game are utterly braindead and require zero skill.
---
This is the survivor hypocrisy. Spirit takes no skill yet most cant win with her but running around a pallet is MLG level play.
---
You’re only fooling yourself
---
Yeah, when I looked back at this clip I realized how dumb I was lmao
---
DemonCat looking extra smug.
---
It's understandable if you're new, we all learn from our mistakes. :)
---
lol.
---
It's actually 21 sandbags being filled.
---
And then the match gets cancelled.

HOLY SHIT

It was a coincidence? Or can I predict the future?

Yes. This image is an instant ticket to tunnel town.

That's true. I should probably have used unfair instead to avoid confusion. But is it a banable offense? Seems like a bit too harsh punishment in this case.
---
ur right. the fastest way to lvl up is completing those rift challenges... and i want so bad that lvl 4 charm. just to show that i got it lol but damn, those challenges are REAL CHALLENGES. they're not playing LOL
---
I agree on it being good and balanced.
---
I was making a joke about the fact that BBQ's auras are good but not vital, but the points make it a staple in many builds, including my own.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dwwwan/is_interupting_survivors_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Ghostface can Gen Grab too.
---
But no one cares about poor Ghostface.
---
And now on the survivor side, standing still so she phases through you is considered a mindgame. Funny how that works.
---
Nurse is not fine lol you obviously have no experience with her. The spirit changes arent so bad but nobody finds nurse fun to use anymore and running in a straight line which used to mean death is now one of the strongest ways to prolong a chase against her
---
KONO SPIRITS' DAD DA
---
It seems like it's going to happen come Chapter 14 with the new Killer, which is probably going to be in about a month or two. That being said we might have a patch instead who knows? :)
---
FUbnyn FUNNY COMEDYHU LAUGHING FUNYE
---
First one, instead of making you 5% faster make other survivors 5% slower.  Troll perk.
---
Third one,  add you can not see survivor auras.  any time you heal or unhook another survivor this perk is disabled for the rest of the match.
---
2nd one, remove the aura reveal.  Add you may not exit the match unless three other survivors are dead.  You are intangible and invisible to the killer.  Your repair/heal/sabotage/totem speed is disabled and instead you only get impossible skill checks that cause regression and noise.  Should all remaining survivors have this perk active, endgame collapse triggers. (Or something to this effect)
---
DS is too good to counter one thing tho. If it was Anti-Tunneling, it wouldn't have worked in the end game and would turn off when other survivor gets hooked.
---
Sorry meant that to be a reply to something else. -_-
---
An asymmetrical design for an asymmetrical game....
---
Ah, that one got me.
---
We've all been there!!! Sometimes we're just gunning for the daily so we're selfish for a match!! But now it's ALL THE TIME
---
Yeah thereu made it this way on purpose bud
---
What the hell am I reading
---
You’re not wrong, just because the survivors are winning doesn’t mean they’ve won. But they are at an advantage if all the gens are done regardless of the perks someone is running. The reason NOED is one of the few perks like it is because it’s a last resort. 
---
I would rather the devs work on fixing things like dedicated servers rather than perks that aren’t very strong in the first place.
---
3 hits that should've hit missed, and the one hit that hits should've missed.
---
A lot of killer perks are pointless at endgame, yeah. As is Freddy’s TP.
---
just found a list of all challenges.

Context on this image?
---
I threw a pallet down between me and a Kate the other day (not in a chase) because she wouldn’t stop trying to heal me and I was trying to get the self heal challenge.

That being said it's more engaging than just holding down Mouse 1.

The crossover I never knew I wanted but now know I need
---
The entire trap part of her kit needs a complete rework, it's completely rnp reliant and hardly does anything other than keep a single survivor busy for a minute or so.
---
I do if I see them b/c 1000 free points.
---
Dont let me die.
---
🤣 🤣 🤣 No doubt!!!
---
Unless those perks become part of “the meta then survivors won’t run them.
---
Nowadays ngl at any rank youll be gone in no time. And rightly so playing killer without ruin can be aids
---
No, absolutely not. Noed is a buff that you get for doing nothing. By all means, end game perks, sure. Noed is inherently a terrible concept.
---
Fully commited
---
So u can use it when ur not in dream state but if they hit the survivor that was on the hook they get put into dream and mending state and his lullaby dosnt count as terror radius so it just ticks down he just has to follow u don't matter how well u loop u have until u bleed out he just has to follow u

Tunneling is focusing one person down no matter what. If you want to call it tunneling when that person literally always runs in front of me fine, but it isn’t my fault at that point. If people want to do safe unhooks, they had damn well better be willing to take a hit.
---
Now you gave me some ideas, thanks :)
---
I feel like since I bought this outfit the killers have been merciless.

I was reffering to pallet loops like the ones on jungle gyms, which most of those actually require skill and there are a finite amount of. Spirit "mInDgAmEs" are mostly guesswork on both sides, and on pallets experienced Spirits will always win. I play killer and survivor at red ranks so don't try and pull that "uR jUsT a SaLtY sUrViVoR mAiN" crap. Spirit is just unfun to play as and against.

Yes, they are made by Geistra. Super talented.

---
BO4 shot itself in the foot by bloating itself with Season Pass/Battle Pass/Lootboxes/Microtransactions/Pay2Win Guns/etc. As a result of BO4’s horrible reputation, profit margins and bug-filled release, Zombies had to suffer.
---
Look at how much love was put into the Blood Of The Dead Cutscene, or even IX. And then look at the lazy, rushed pieces of crap we got towards the end. All the budget cuts affected Zombies more than anything because their main focus was Multiplayer and trying to steal the FortNite Customer base with Blackout.
---
They did our Aether Crew so dirty by just ending it with *”lol they all suicide and live happily ever after”*. No Dr.Monty, no Great War, nothing.
---
You see everyone, when someone has a stroke, they may attempt to speak, but it may make no sense, or simply be gibberish.
---
We're gonna live forever should be based on on actual objective and I'd use it
---
The other problem is that achievements don't show the fact that I personally had 6 legacy cosmetics, not just 3.
---
But at this point after years of patience, I think the devs should overlook what characters players got legacy on and allow them to chose 3 legacy cosmetics for 1 character if they got p3, for instance.
---
Either that or they should let me give them all the proof I have about the characters I had legacy on, including steam screenshots, videos etc. Let me show them the video that I recorded when I lost all my cosmetics.
---
Or as the title suggests, AT LEAST take a look at my steam achievements. The data is there. Just let me get 3 legacy cosmetics back at this point, PLEASE! It's been years!
---
I feel like most GGs I get are just shittalk. Someone used an ebony mori, or I tried playing a killer I know I am bad at for fun and everyone got to run circles around me and I get flooded with 'GGs'. Like, those ideal GGs you mention where someone is having a good matchup against you and the game feels great and fun are rare. They're usually toxic. Not to mention, I hate having that crap blow up my phone, the notifications, etc. If you want to handshake after the match,go play chess, MTG or yugiho.
---
New prayer beads dont sound great so expect everyone to be burning their current prayer beads over the next few weeks ;)

---
Thanks, i should probably start watching these dev streams to be updated with the game.
---
The wonders of being rank 17
---
Is there somewhere I can find all this lore surrounding the spirit? I'm fairly new to the game
---
The feng running isn't a hacker, It's a bug. Happened to me after a unhook. 
---
The kate tho...
---
Careful these people dont like it when you speak the truth.
---
It runs great for me and I’m not sure whats going on because I dint have any of the GPU effects enabled, but the game looks far better than it did on my old 970. Its brighter, cleaner, and it looks like its supersampled...even though it’s definitely not.
---
He moves the same speed as any other killer, and the saw is pretty shitty outside of preventing unhooks, though Huntress, Myers, Nurse, are nearly as good as that, and their powers are useful outside of standing by the hook. I’d say he’s potentially the worst killer, outside of maybe no add on wraith.
---
Front row seats :)
---
I'm a low rank killer still learning to use Huntress even at lvl 43 lol I was bullied by a bunch of (pretty sure) SWF players, but I finally had enough and equipped [**Iridescent Head**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Iridescent_Head) **and** [**Leather Loop**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Leather_Loop) 
---
Match starts, Feng Min runs up to ME and starts flashing me, and as I'm going blind, I throw my hatchet and hear her yelp, and when my vision returns, I hook her. The dude behind her DCs lol and a second one DCs after she tries to pallet stun me but I catch her with a hatchet to the face. 
---
Match was over pretty quickly, and I smiled thinking, damn... This game really is unbalanced.
---
Yeah, unsportsmanlike is for teaming with the killer. So I think it’s fair but can be confusing as to what constitutes something to be unsportsmanlike. Luckily, the devs came out and said camping and tunneling aren’t banable. Which was probably the leading cause of reports.
---
Lmao, jus saw the killers perspective as well
---
Thanks so much! I've been using the 90s perk pack for so long so it'll feel good to switch it up again. Love the look of these!
---
Who is the next killer
---
Because seeing toxic survivors cry their eyes out post game when they use a white ward and you take their purple flashlight from them is by far one of the most enjoyable things in the game.
---
It’s just a fucking flashlight lmfao

She will still be strong there mostly just changing add ons

I'm just gonna say that I personally don't believe that. That's just me, but it seems kinda sus that you had a flashlight, someone was down, and another was injured.

I’m the same these days. The grind in the game is just too damn big to not take it. I look forward to the days when all my killers have good perks and I can afford to not take it.

damn boy. i was almost sure that they would return... ):

No one in this game ever had 9 games of sfw claudette in a row, let alone in a week lmao. If you say you did, you are lying.

---
Challenge Master
---
Each survivor who has a challenge gives you a stack at the start of the trial. Sacrificing a survivor makes you lose a stack. Survivors sacraficed while you had a stack have their challenge complete. If you have a stack left, you can choose to give it to a survivor or give it to yourself to complete a challenge.
---
*"No challenge is too small for me." -Rank 1 killer
---
it’s reddit, nobody is serious on here. i see more trolls and shitposts than serious discussion
---
I think you're the only one here using alt accounts bud, gotta keep that karma, right? Also, do you have dementia?
---
beats me idk, just extremely unlucky RNG i guess
---
Yes, because survivors should totally be entitled to something that just makes the game frustrating for everyone involved except for the person using it and rewards them for not doing their job. That's how balance works.
---
Incidentally, this does go both ways. Moris are dumb too. Neither are good for the games health and neither should be in the game.
---
You need to take David’s jacket off for the bloodweb to refresh.
---
But Ghostface only has a cooldown if he's revealed, and he's compensated for being revealed by a free Survivor marker, Michael has to CATCH everyone in the time he's a threat to everyone instead of getting individual timers, and in exchange for his increased lunge, Michael becomes a full M1 killer.
---
So which of them am I allowed to use then? Or are all of them banned?
---
Nope, karma doesn’t mean anything. Why are you bringing up dementia?
---
That damn challenge for throwing down 15 pallets has made my teammates noticeably worse than usual.
---
Well, I'm glad I did those challenges in 3 or 4 nights right after release. Except for 4k.
---
That’s what I figured was it has to be from WB to begin with. I thought about the likeness thing but that could be debated due to it being the character and not the actor per say. Granted I’d imagine Robert would be on board honestly. Same how Kyle Gallner tweeted about making Quentin look more like him finally. And I know it’s based on the remake, and I figured that was due to rights ownership at the time wanting that over the original.
---
You forgot "the Meg getting downed .001 seconds before dropping a pallet for a challenge"
---
&gt; Also love the fact that someone above is bitching about Haddonfield offerings and balanced landing, and gets upvoted, but someone complaining about killer aspects they find unfun is getting torn apart.
---
I have absolutely no problems with any of these things. I'm trying to understand what specifically upsets survivors so I can avoid these things and make your games more fun.
---
True. Get rid of Bills name and put borrowed time there and leave the perk icon alone. It’s really difficult to balance an 8 letter word with a 4 letter one against an existing symmetrical image.
---
It seems like the concept is having trouble penetrating that thick skull of yours. 
---
You can use whatever the fuck you want, but don't act like they're completely fine and healthy for game-play.
---
Bruh of all the waste pallet drops o saw if this doc was good and went around you woulda been fuckkkkkked. Many of those pallets can be mindgamed anywwy.
---
what does this have to do with the comment you replied to at all
---
Does some piss in your cereal everyday? I couldn't imagine not nice atleast once in a while. Obviously not saying you need too btw, just I personally don't get that mind set.
---
Pretty sure I've actually played with you before, cause that tag is hella familiar. Ever had a dumbass Feng on your team?
---
right but "unsportsmanlike conduct" is like one of four reportable things so people should be more precise with what they say
---
No, this is the first I've ever heard of Killers having different base vaulting speeds. Although Ghostface's cooldown barely seems like a threat. You get a warning it's coming, so pop the 100% before it does. Or don't, because you never lose progress and can just let your stalk come back while you chase.
---
Michael doesn't have NOTHING going on; his lunge and addons seem to be his greatest strengths. I just feel like Ghostface comes out almost objectively superior, so maybe Michael should be able to switch back to Tier 1 or something.
---
If you're being genuine, there's very few things survivors don't find fun to play against. 
---
The list of things I avoid when I play killer are pretty much limited just NOED, ebonies, and completely busted addons like iridescent head or prayer beads.
---
dude the legion is honestly so good. you just need to know how to use him and what add ons and perks  to use. legion is really good.
---
I don't like the idea of killer balance hinging on addons.
---
aw man you gotta credit the original artist ya goofball
---
Yeah never say never! 😁
---
Dude, I know it gets frustrating but come on, you just want a 4k every game you play, how is that balanced? If the game was truly balanced then the average kill count should be two per game
---
Great now I can think of[is this](https://imgur.com/7CIf1TN)

Personally I think its pretty cool we can now distract from "winning" and doing objectives to do those challanges. To focus on something else, fool around, have fun after all as we are supposed to do in a game, to stop tryharding for a survival because for a moment it isn't your main goal. Maybe it can be selfish sometimes but hey you can be selfish to. Those challenges are really rewarding, dont you do them yourself?
---
a bunch of neckbeard losers who find their identity through epic video game pixels have been having a meltdown because some formerly exclusive cosmetics are being freely given to the overall community

Say hello to franklins lol
---
Sure, hit me up whenever
---
I feel kind of bad a killer was about to get 4th kill but somehow I escaped by myself and the way he looked at the exit gates was so sad I wonder if he wanted to complete that challenge 😞
---
It doesn’t but ghostface has basically no add one that change up his power it’s all just strict bonuses to cool downs
---
How did people lose them?
---
Respect points +10
---
Just deal with it ffs instead of crying about it. It's the same shit every month. Quit crying about resets.
---
Because giving someone the hatch isn't a "nice" thing to do, in my opinion. It's the opposite of fun. I don't give people rounds in Street Fighter, I don't let my opponents get a free kill on me in shooter games, why am I going to give someone the hatch? It's more fun to race to a survivor to the hatch not knowing who's going to get to it first. If I get to it first, it gets shut. If they get to it, they escape. If they're already down then they get hooked because that's what the game is all about.
---
Here you go :  [https://twitter.com/HellOnEarthIII](https://twitter.com/HellOnEarthIII)
---
I miss Highrise and Terminal T_T
---
Except you also can't see the survivors, so it doesn't need its own animation. The "animation" in this case, is the red stain. The mindgame is whether you are moonwalking, or faking it. It's like going for a heavy, then cancelling the heavy and parrying. You trick the survivor into doing what you want so you can punish them for not reading you. If there is no animation (or tell in general) then it isn't a mindgame
---
There is a degree of guessing for both sides, you aren't staring at the survivor while vaulting while they think you are just standing there.
---
Rank reset should only happen every 3 months imo.  Only reason to keep it at 1 month is so that it's harder for people to pool in the red ranks.
---
I imagine he’s gonna be neutered on the PTB to avoid this exact situation, then buffed a bit before going live. Either way I’m glad it’s an OC killer, power should be very interesting.
---
BHVR making things less annoying, that is some wish you have...
---
Yea, it's pretty bad, like Postal 1 but everything is worse, even the controls
---
Google says it the game was released June 2016, so its a time span of 6 months. They should just give it to everyone who bought DBD in that time frame. 
---
It’ll piss off people who actually grinded for it but at least it’s something.
---
Yeah, I trust she’s not gonna be unfair to go against anymore but also that her base kit is not useless either
---
My main issue was vaults and fucking prayer beads as a survivor, and as a killer a) I suck, b) I never used prayer beads because they make my soul hurt lmao; so I’m very happy with the changes
---
No, pig needs to be nerfed /s
---
Good luck finishing 3 gens with dark sense when not in a SWF.
---
That's true, but the gens can only be within 32 or 24 meters of you when you down a survivor in order to work. Plus if a survivor is working on the gen that Surge is applied to, then they can easily stop that regression instantly. But other than that, it's an okay perk I guess, I'm just not that interested in it.
---
You husband now.
---
Why you gotta do me like that
---
So she slows doen when gettimg out of phase?
---
You're doing Entity's work, lad. Great job!
---
&gt; but don't act like they're completely fine and healthy for gameplay, and anyone who dares even complain about them is in the wrong.
---
Well then tell me what is not healthy for the game? Why are you calling me thick skulled for trying to understand your perspective and be a better community member? I have not said anything you are doing is wrong. I have only been playing this game for 2 weeks and somehow I'm supposed to know what perk/addon combos are unhealthy for the game?
---
Well know soon enough lol
---
In a vacuum that seems very strong, but in practice, his saw is not very good against competent survivors. Whenever he revs up his chainsaw, he slows down a ridiculous amount, which means he can’t actually use the chainsaw very effectively while a survivor is at a loop. Out in the open it’s great, but if a survivor is playing around window or pallets, it becomes much harder to use, and generally a survivor knows that it’s better to not be in the open in general if they don’t need to be. Combine that with no movement ability for map pressure, and no ability that slows down the game, he is very underwhelming.
---
Rule 3 states that once a survivor is downed, they are to be immediately be picked up again, even if they may have Decisive Strike. If there are players with flashlights, the killer should face said players when picking up in order to allow for a flashlight save.
---
I am moister than an oister
---
Hag's ultra rares are actually meant for gimmicks than skills. In fact, they hurt her.
---
My main strategy after the gates are powered when I know the killer has rancor and I’m the obsession is panic, run, and be a dick to my teammates by leaving them the moment I open a gate
---
Idk what else i can do so please tell me lmao
---
If you can still do 1 while 2 is available. The Tome releases just allow people to do more challenges.
---
No one knows. We just know it is going to be related to Rin’s lore
---
Grabbing a hook rescuer appears to work as well though it’s quite toxic to camp. But if you have crazy altruistic survivors going nuts over their own challenges and insta-saving, then what the heck.
---
Biggy oofy.
---
Eh.  They're annoying but they're also pretty situational and similar to Moris it's just a tool to end the game faster at the expense of bloodpoints/emblems.

For any killer they buff they need to give Pig a nerf. It's a rule at this point.

I love Steve’s screams. Always make me laugh regardless of what I’m doing in-game.

You are awesome!
---
Also as doctor you can grab while you're in shock therapy mode.
---
Seems like a toxic channel if you ask me.
---
I'm not arguing that he's amazing, but he is underrated. Coupled with the fact that survs often disrespect Bubba. You can't always help whether or not you are in the open either. He's definitely better than Wraith, Fapper, Pig, Legion, etc and a good Bubba can be difficult to deal with.
---
Hang in there, brother. I was lucky enough to start playing killer the week BEFORE reset and had a total blast. This week has been absolute hot, toxic garbage. I definitely would not have stuck with the game if this week was my first experience.
---
Hmm. How come? They can bait it, but survivors can wait for the bait. They can use lightborn, but lightborn is pretty bad seeing as how it just wastes a perk slot. They can look at a wall, but there might not always be a wall..
---
Aww f for Billy
---
i’ve just remembered the url at this point
---
Yea she is the worst killer to pip up with. It sucks because I’m a Plague main and if I get a 4K I still black pip because the system doesn’t understand how Plague’s power works.
---
Nothing bad can happen
---
Yeah, true, but they can be powerful if used correctly. Going to any trap in the map with good tracking perks is godlike, and bodyblocking is useful with basement and some buildings
---
I don’t play hag much tho anymore, so I may be missing some things or wrong about some things
---
My point is that strong add ons that change a lot of a killer’s base power should have a strong drawback that cannot be trampled/ignored with another add on
---
But i'm a gay demo/oinker :c
---
Thiccweb more like
---
Jokes on them - me being garbage at the game is enough to keep me from pooling in the red ranks, regardless of time between resets!
---
I was listening to Mystery Skulls while this happened, nice.
---
Rank reset is my single most hated thing about this game. They should implement a sane, rank decay system. If you don't play, over time your rank slowly falls. That way queue times never become impossible, and you will see less fresh red ranks with baby players.

Ruh roh
---
I fully expect the spirit to have her phasing be bugged please if you’re in the ptb test out phasing into a survivor
---
I’d agree he’s better than legion, but Trapper, pig, and wraith all are ok with addons. Leatherface just becomes slightly less worse imo. I’ve never really found him difficult to deal with outside of camping, and if they’re doing that, then you just get free gens.
---
I've measured it before, if you're doing it well you can hit 80% consistently \~
---
Just make it so his chainsaw doesn’t slow him down when charging and he’s basically perfect
---
What I’m saying is, even if it’s not easy, NOED has an actual counter. Keys, however, are only countered by Franklin’s demise, which isn’t a perk that a lot of people run.
---
Talk about heavy rain
---
I think its way too instant and free. I think once the hatch is found, if you have a key it should take some amount of time to open it or something and then maybe shouldnt be able to be reopened with abother key for a certain amount of time. Anything instant in this game is super powerful on either side.
---
Excuse me, that is clearly Michael Myers
---
Perfect game

I don't know man. I have like 300 coxcombed clappers since my wraith had been P3 over a year before his rework. Bubba ain't got shit on that.

Plot twist: it's just KYF

interesting, umbras clip is from the same day as mine; maybe its the same guy

Hatch Bug?  I just had a game (I'm Killer) where the last surv had to find the hatch, I found it by chance.  The hatch was already closed and had no noise, I thought we were both trapped in there!  Anyway, even though it 'looked' closed it let me close it.
---
Has this happened to anyone else?  I tried to post but it got removed my mods.  Not support posts etc..

You want forgiveness? Get religion.
---
You didn't specify a limit to the amount of time perk 2 could be used.  If there is no limit, then you could never be sacrificed without a Mori, Rancor, Devour Hope, or Pig, because you could just keep popping yourself off the Killer's shoulder every time he picked you up.
---
Disagree. The cypress is actual garbage and not worth an offering. I'd rather run rancor. The only mori worth running is ivory, since ebony moris are for scumbags.
---
You must main survivor to think that cypress moris are worth anything.
---
exscape mye deude
---
That's because you haven't met me or my colleagues in the fog yet. We do exist though, I promise.
---
lol nope. The cutscenes look like a slideshare. In dbd its the same but has more animations. Also, many frames of the ending cutscene of tag are reused from alpha omega. And the ending itself sucks.
---
I know it's disruptive to normal gameplay, but I find survivor so much more fun when I have a secondary mission like these.
---
You found the only Windows Store Buyer.. now you can die peacefully
---
When players first launch DBD, they have to accept the EULA. However, the EULA reappeared for players with hundereds or thousands of years. There was no getting around it, everytime the player logged on they had to accept it or would not be able to play. 
---
Restarting the game would not get rid of the message and you had to accept it to play the game. So, players that accepted it lost ALL of their progress and legacy cosmetics. 2-3 years later and the devs have still not returned the lost legacy skins.
---
So not only was I underrefunded bloodpoints and had to spend days and days and days spending them, but have not been given my legacy back that took AGES to grind for and lost due to a bug.
---
“Shadowborn op gives buff for nothing” like dude, that’s what perks are for. You select your assortment of buffs. The only perk that comes with a downside is no mither
---
Yeah, because she's the current reason survivors are wetting themselves. That's always the most urgent.
---
With how annoying these challenges are currently I’m scared for the future archive levels that open
---
no i'm really asking. what in the dev post made you so sad you had to make an epic meme?
---
I was going to wait for the next gen but my 980ti is getting frame drops in the boiler room on badham when playing on ultra :()
---
I dunno why but I still love this format!
---
Today, I ran into another room and the Huntress still got me with an axe, even though she was in the hallway.
---
Killers without map pressure don't get played outside of potato ranks. Period.
---
Should be open with sound, but it's closed &amp; silent.  Anyone else had this?
---
Kinda quirky 😳😳
---
Just like nurse is semi countered by iron will and can be much MUCH harder if someone has this perk especially on hard maps like lerys and nurses often run stridor because its a good perk on them like on spirit - just because she is strong doesnt mean she needs to be nerfed
---
*Congraturation. You have been completed Dead by Daylight*
---
Yeah, i do the same, if i see someone not get rescued all game until after they go into struggle state, I'll give them a chance by not downing them , or if I do down them, then I leave them on the ground for someone to pick up
---
David is 100% free. Shouldn't need to buy him or huntress for money or cells.
---
The Entity decided for you that the last person was unworthy of the hatch.
---
That's cool, I'm a killer main. Just so you know, whispers 3 is really good but whispers 1 is almost useless because the range is so large.

Don't play retardface then!

Imagine being butthurt about a dress for your virtual character.

I did you don't need to do them by yourself 100% you just need to be on them when they finish
---
If nobody cared about pipping and ranking up, then the system wouldn’t be implemented...
---
Were you one of them? Lol
---
I'm not too optimistic that you'll understand where I'm coming from, but take this into consideration: 
---
I don't have much time to play due to having two jobs, so I think being at lvl 43 Huntress doesn't mean much or I truly do suck, but I could've sworn I was hitting more with my thrown hatchets last time I played. 
---
Keep in mind I was hitting shit with my hatchet throws, then add to the fact, I still lost 1 out of the 3 final games. Nearly all  the survs I was playing against had a full set of ultra rare perks. I think I'm justified.
---
It seems like it, with a different name. The way they were playing and cheating seems to be the exact same.
---
never played, im sorry if you misheard that, was mainly aimed at the survivors, sorry.
---
Ghostface seems to attract all of the edgy kids who used to abuse Legion before Legion was nerfed.
---
Mc Mental in the background, this is God tier
---
Yup I'm definitely doing that. Will sacrifice anything to complete the challenge.
---
for killer? no fucking way. badham 1 still sucks for killer and the realm sucks for Huntress in general
---
What?...... my guy I know that but when I’m being chased you can’t focus on where your teammate is and look for crows when the killer is on you XD
---
survivor be like: \*confused cave sponge meme\*
---
Can confirm. I don’t know the specifics of how it works, but I was surprised to see I completed it without ever self caring the whole match. Brought self care along planning to do the challenge, then forgot about it during the match and ended up finishing the challenge anyway somehow.
---
That's still incredibly hard. If you have good randoms, you are fucked. If your randoms are obsessed with getting sacrificed, good luck getting 3 gens done on your own.
---
All I said was that they were balanced. I never said they were worth anything.
---
Being a new player isn’t an excuse either.  When I started playing late 2016 the worst things I did was leave immediately.  You don’t need experience to know crouching around the edge of the map isn’t useful.
---
Still being fairly new, but still getting the concepts and practices of each, I still always get taken out by Myers, spirits, but mainly the Doctor is my biggest rival.
---
I’ve never gotten away from a Doctor if he was using his full range of abilities.
---
The chapter David comes from is free so he doesn't show on the store, neither does The Huntress
---
but while Michael is an M1 killer, he's still hella scary because of his terror radius. all Michaels are running M&amp;A, bringing his terror radius to 8m.
---
Ghost Face has either full or none terror radius, Myers is always sneaky
---
Bubba can be very good with PWYF (especially if the obsession doesn't catch on to what you're doing)
---
A dumbass Feng? Basically every game, gonna have to be more specific haha. Name sounds familiar too so probably played with you a couple times.
---
To quote michelle visage. Its a piece of (virtual) fabric.
---
See, I was going to say skill check doc on the game is worse, but I realized something. You can still be good enough to just ignore the downsides of that build, even if it's annoying and a lot of survivors can't. You can't just ignore the slowed action speed from Freddy unless you somehow manage to gen rush before he gets any momentum at all. It's really obnoxious.
---
Gens, hook sabo, team heal, self heal, snap out, trap sabo, ds, pig box, demo portal.
---
They're everywhere dude. Each individual action is it's own thing. Also htf are you gonna forget 3 killer powers? .-.
---
There are a few spots on different maps that are currently glitched and the hatch doesn’t open in those spots. I remember reading it on some patch notes or known bugs list.
---
Thats what you get for playing leatherface.
---
Nancy never had legacy, she came out this year.
---
Whenever this happens I always imagine that we’re both in a competition to survive and just rooting for the other to die first lmao. The worst part is that I’m always the last person to find the hatch, so I end up spending the whole match running around while they’re hiding. Sometimes I lead the killer to them, but it doesn’t always work lmao
---
HAAAAAAAAAAXXXXXX
---
Black ops 4 zombies
---
MUM GET THE CAMERA
---
No he gets notified to the killer and might be an easier target
---
So it's true, women's cycles do synchronise...
---
wooosh
---
I try to be understanding. My opinion isn't the only one out there and people have their reasons. I just want to look at things from whatever perspective I can.
---
How is there a joke there? It's not even on the tier of a dad joke.
---
Wow that sucks.
---
I mean, even if only one Survivor was cleansing totems, that's still a 100% slowdown of the game. That means when the Killer starts chasing someone, they're only at 200% on gens, rather than 300%
---
It's an awful feeling..
---
An example, a few days ago I saw that GTA V was released in 2013 and I would fucking swear to you it came out 2-3 years ago.
---
Oh my God I missed the italics lol now I'm laughing a little too late.

Just because you cant loop her in infinite circles like everyone else doesnt make her OP.

Learn to walk around corners and hide, even if she finds you she now has a cool down allowing for a loop
---
Even with my brightness in-game set to 100% and my phone turned all the way up I can barely see anything until I'm a few meters away. Galaxy S8 .
---
The collision was an excellent change. Prayer Bead nerf was also needed. But why the fuck did they change her vault animation?
---
Huntress and Ghostface are both considered high tier killers, so both are viable in different ways.
---
I'm not saying that map pressure isn't extremely strong. I'm just saying that not every killer needs to be everywhere at once.
---
lol @ spirit doggo
---
I wonder why you're getting downvotes for telling the truth
---
right, and then what about those not using Franklin's every single time? pretty sure I cant randomly pull a mori out of a chest btw.
---
I’m glad they’re doing changes that will actually do something to an unfun killer. Let’s face it. The legion add on buff isn’t going to do anything but make some of their add-ons usable. They’re too stubborn to fix any of Legions actual problem
---
"Used my free time" oh boy, that whole minute it took (not even) 
---
Do it now! Before prayer beads go. This archive challenge is the one and only time I won’t give prayer bead players shit
---
Noed punishes survivors for doing gens fast. Ds punishes going after the unhooked person. So does bt. Unbreakable counters slugging. I honestly dont see how noed is so different. And yes i admit noed is stronger than any surv perk but you gotta keep in mind. There are 4 survivors and 1 killer. Is 1 noed better than 4 ds?
---
Ya maybe i choosed wrong Categorie
---
that's not fair.  most new survivors are immersed, especially those that don't watch twitch.
---
GRAB THEM
---
Right lol, if you die just get into a new game
---
shots fired
---
not to mention the fact that when survivors get hit, they're rewarded with a speed boost. its funny how this game tends to punish killers for success but reward survivors for failures. like how survivors can now get a free escape through the hatch even if no one ever touched a gen and 3 die in the first minute.
---
Some vapor wave or some loud dubstep.
---
All of them
---
Pretty sure it’s supposed to look like this, the game usually forces my brightness to max if it feels like it.
---
They aren’t even crazy nerfs. Spirits will be fine, and if they give her the old vaulting animation she had on her first ptb, she will still be fucky to fight
---
This made me instantly envision the Doctor running after you, only to reach the gates with you storming through them safely; and him halted dead in his tracks staring at you with a pouty look on his face.
---
Made me really get a good chuckle when imagining how he holds the weapon in his hands! Hahahahahaha 😆
---
Honestly yeah, I’d take swf all day if it means more playtime
---
Wait why the hell is there an ultra-rare medkit? I think that might be the problem.. (don’t forget to submit a bug report)
---
take a joke
---
I dropped out with the gladiator and shinobi got introducedand they refused to communicate about upcoming patches for the stun locks. So about the same time that the majority of the player base bailed.
---
I think it'd be fine if keys no longer spawn out of chest at random. Moris cant do that. 
---
someone else suggested making the purple key only open the hatch for 1 person too. I can get behind something like that, since there's no real difference between the red and purple one, while there certainly is between the red and green mori.
---
Right...the survivors are the ones crying...
---
Prayer beads won’t save her now
---
If you’re consistently chasing survivors off gens and corralling them so that they’re 3 genned at the end. If you’re spending all your time getting looped by a survivor you need to break chase and apply gen pressure.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
yep you're right. you're actually incredibly well adjusted
---
[obligatory](https://youtu.be/kxopViU98Xo)
---
I don't mind it being reworked. However if I could choose I'd rather have the indoor maps gone, or reworked (ofcourse this isn't going to happen). Those maps are annoying for me for aswell killer as survivor. Thompsons house is really annoying for killer, but fun for survivor
---
Survivors have been asking for a *long* time now for additional objectives instead of just doing gens. Well there you go.
---
Ooh haha, my mistake. Still, submit a bug report, it might be enough to make sure this doesn’t happen enough.

Is the hair actually on the mask? I’ve been seeing hair on all these memes but don’t remember seeing it on the mask. Was there a reveal?
---
Really struggling so far with dropping 2 pallets in a single match, a lot of the 2nd time seem very grindy compared to the first set too.
---
This exact situation happened to me yesterday. I had to do the self care challenge and a Claudette was t-bagging so she could heal me
---
Thank you! It’s a bunch of finger pointing. I’m not blaming the killer for not playing nice, but you can’t expect me to not kill myself on my first hook or DC after I know already that there’s 0 chance for survival and fun. I have 1,000+ hours, I’m not naive anymore
---
I accidentally sandbagged an injured Bill last night trying to finish a medkit him... let’s just say I forgot how small Michael’s TR is with M&amp;A
---
keys aren’t broken kappa
---
Survivors asking for new objectives aren't the ones complaining about that I can assure you.
---
I did the 4K challenge first try by doing it the best way I know how.  That's by playing Nurse with META perks and an Ebony
---
That's not what I said, and insulting me isn't making you seem like the winner of the argument.
---
Men of big culture
---
Oh she definitely needed what they did to her though with these changes.  It's hard to argue against any of them.  They're extremely fair while keeping her place on the tier list.  All they really did was raise her skillcap a little bit so you actually have to know fundamentals of playing killer to use her moving forward.  A lot of those mechanics they're changing were a bit cheesy.
---
I gave you reasons why her nerfs were enough, and counter plays for her.
---
if you still disagree 
---
GIT GUD
---
What? How could people troll your challenge? It’s not like they know which ones you are working on.
---
Lmao, I did it with Myers which is probably why it was difficult
---
People who dont stalk with ghostface are playing him wrong and deserves bm at the exit gate. The perfect way to play him is to do both. Dont go out of your way to stalk but take the oppertunities you get.
---
I was wondering why the challenge got completed, though I only self cared once.  No complaints from me
---
Survivors have been complaining for a long time that they wanted another objective to do besides just gens. Well here you are.
---
Ah, I see your a (pillar)man of culture as well.
---
Rn I’m the cat
---
The best part is dropping a pallet on his face before the chase actually begins.  Wasted a whole game and 3 pallets this way
---
It has already happened.
---
Peak*
---
Hahah yeah *totally not an ex-claudette main*
---
Just to add the the bunch, here. If you're trying to complete the 15 pallet challenge, it doesn't count even if you drop the pallet on the killers face if he wasn't chasing you prior. GF was chasing a Claudette, so I waited around the corner and dropped a pallet on him. Did that twice in one game and it didn't count either
---
I checked that dude and... wow. Pure madness. I loved it!
---
I respectfully disagree- true Badham 1 ain’t great, but keep in mind there are 5 versions for a reason. I don’t know why, I just have a lot of fun on Badham in general- also, I don’t play Huntress, so maybe that contributes to it.
---
How did you get that from what I said? I message people back who message ME first. unless it's saying GG and complimenting how well they did.
---
*WAUGH*
---
Please don't pretend like that's an issue for an even remotely competent Survivor.
---
# &gt;:(
---
Yo dude i wanna run faster then spirit, hag, and huntress when i run that perk and hope
---
This is really satisfying to do when survivors are teabagging you at the gate and get too cocky.
---
I think they reworked Badham as it fit the killer that they were reworking at the time.
---
Ngl that be me sometimes
---
Good , anyone that supports a 3rd gray market selling should leave the game.  I'm sure most people who bought their codes off ebay are pretty pissed atm lol.
---
YOU'RE SO MEAN TO NEA
---
LOL! This is too true! I even have the screenshot of my nea with it, before I lost it to that save garbage. I wonder if they keep/have track of support tickets from when I reported it. I know I have the email. While I know they'll never give it back it's not MY fault your shit wasn't working properly...I almost quit too when it happened. Christ!

I tried the basement 4k just to test how feasible it was. Managed to kill 3 of them in the basement but the 4th wedged herself in a corner where I couldn’t pick her up and stayed there until she bled out.
---
There’s so much that can go wrong with this challenge
---
This is true though. I hate getting face camped or another survivor being face camped for looping the killer well without BMing while doing it. As killer, if I'm being looped for too long, I switch targets. It's not worth throwing a game just to down a person.
---
"The boy believes in santa," the s isn't saying plural it's just the verb in present tense
---
Huh weird
---
Yeah but I’m sick of just crashing into pallets and not breaking them as billy, p2p was better
---
Yeah it’s a glitch in the game
---
So you're telling me it came conviently less than a day after your response?

Let it go!

---
Very low effort.
---
But TBH I got a 4k on the most boring survivors ever they only got one gen done they were too busy leaving scratch marks throwing down pallets too early and healing in plain sight. Rank reset geez. They also kept trying to do sacrifice plays only for me to get both. Actually pissed me off how boring they were
---
I’m trying to practice Demodoggo, my worst killer. I’m getting the most tryhard and bullying survivors ever. One legit made me cry because they just messaged the nastiest things to me... I hate rank reset 😭
---
I had a glitch for the self care challenge. I never healed myself that game, but i got the challenge?? Idk why.
---
&gt;completely healed, hide in a locker, or another survivor is hooked.
---
I've seen this idea before, except it didn't have the added "hide in a locker" and "completely healed" part, and now I dislike the idea even more. 
---
Second wind, inner strength, anti-hemorrhaging syringe. Both of these perks and the add-on makes it possible to heal mid chase. Actually, we can even throw in "we'll make it" because it's entirely possible to heal someone off the hook to full health in the time it takes for the killer to walk back to the unhooked survivor and start tunneling. Camping and tunneling aren't the same thing, so it's possible to get a heal off.
---
The hiding in the locker part is unnecessary in my opinion. Just get slugged even longer.
---
But I care about that last part more. "Or another survivor is hooked". Seriously? I can't tell you how many times someone's tried to get a killer to stop tunneling me and ended up going downed because of it. What if someone comes in for a flashlight save, gets baited by a hillbilly, goes down due to a chainsaw, and gets hooked while you're slugged? Just because you're on the ground and not INSTANTLY back on the hook doesn't make it not tunnelling. You got tunneled. But guess what? The perk that was suppose to defend you from it got deactivated bexause your below average random teammate got downed while you were downed. Having your perk stripped away from you because of your teammates bad play sounds terrible.
---
Decisive is fine as it is. The only issue I see with it is in the end game, where exit gates are open. That makes them almost impossible to get unless they are really far from a gate or miss their ds. This can be avoided by going for the unhooker, hooking far from exit gates, or eating their ds earlier in the match. If there's ANYTHING that should be changed about it, it's that. Otherwise, leave the damn perk alone.
---
I never said that, I said rank 20s dont care about pipping, they want to learn the game, if they want to do it with a no m1 killer thats fine too at least from my experience, they will stay in 20s till they improve, and thats fine
---

---
Good concepts tho.
---
It was pretty amusing playing Cannibal last night and sawing a Claudette who tried to jump a palette + breaking that pallet in one go.
---
honestly that doesnt help. Its way 2 smooth, the one in game skips around 2 much.
---
it also seems to change the ways it skips around depending on the game. Its either kinda smooth, or super unsmooth.
---
Steam achievements are easy to get/fake so they can't be considered proof of anything, sorry.

I don't camp but my first match there was a meg teabagging the entire time when I just wanted to enjoy wearing the new outfit and have fun, meg knew where hatch was the whole time btw.
---
You have your bridges id?
---
Forever Freddy actually, ya know, slows the gens down enough so the killer can actually kill and not get genrushed in the first 6 minutes. There's actually not that much wrong with forever Freddy as it has counterplay, but some survivors like to moan cause they can genrush and get an easy win.

I wouldn't put it past the Entity to feed off emotions from everyone having sex.
---
I don't think it's her father. He was driven to madness by something and I think it is that something
---
Do you know the percentage of how much the survivor is slowed? Normal slows like using thanatophobia and dying light is normally like you know typical 15-25%, those are normal and slow gens enough, there's a difference between enough and Overkill. But go ahead and tell me those counterplays
---
That's what I thought. It makes the most sense. Release the badham rework with Freddy rework
---
But then it'd be easily the best exhaustion perk. ATM it's only a good perk if you're a a new player who urban evasions everywhere they go.
---
Wait they are?
---
You cant fake steam achievements, so yes, they are reliable proof. Sure picture editing is a thing, but Behavior can literally access the steam account you used and see the achievements completed.
---
Hopping in a locker is a way to force a tunnelling killer to pick you up. Otherwise, every single time you to down, you'll have +60 second wait time to getting picked up. Id rather not have this
---
It’s like sprint burst plus dead hard. I wanted to try and make it different by adding the short immunity.
---
I just bought clown but I just reached purple ranks for the first time so I didn’t want to use him just yet. I waited until rank reset and get red rank (yes already) survivors. 
---
I &lt;3 matchmaking :’(
---
It's a bug that can sometimes happen. I've had someone waiting on hatch while I killed the 3rd survivor, and then when I go back to hatch they're just sitting on it while its unopened and everyone else is dead, sad enough.
---
The inevitable douchey "you dont know how she works" comment. I know exactly how she works, I just dont find her fun. Just because I think her playstyle is boring, doesnt mean I dont know how to use her.
---
Perhaps, but I always get all the asshats and cunts so no mercy!
---
using a plunderer's  + ace in the hole + pharmacy  build currently so i feel less guilty about rank reset matchmaking
---
I linked the patch notes, read the time they came out and look when you asked, so yes. 
---
I wouldn't go as far as to call it convenient, more of a coincidence because the update has no bearing on what I said two days ago.
---
Sorry for not being able to see into the future... My bad.
---
My nerfs?   You sound a bit confused.  I didn't propose a single nerf anywhere on this thread.
---
It is when you start playing it.
---
Naturally, yes. In this case, they were using keys. Hatch spawns when 1 more gen has been completed than the number of survivors still remaining alive in the game. In this case, 4 gens were completed and only 3 survivors remained. Each survivor in this video had either a purple(very rare) or pink (ultra rare) key to unlock the hatch. This is an extremely unlikely scenario.
---
This meme is more for the killers who complain that survivors don't basically teleport on hooks and that loop
---
Just....google it. How is this sub more equipped than google?

Didn’t eBay. Earned legit. But thanks for your concern 😉

Looking for swf I have a headset around green ranks now but dont really care who I run with but please no little kids that try to save me even if it will kill the whole team not the greatest but atleast I'm working on something 95% of the time and dont rush to a hook as soon as the person is hooked sit on a gen for a little I mean come on..... unless there second stage. Got lvl 40s claudette and nea
---
If it's not in the code, it doesn't happen. It's a placebo effect. You have been *told* that her shards glow, so you *believe* they do.
---
I have yet to see any video evidence.
---
Ah. Looping really does make you feel like you're less than 115% speed
---
Equip  Franlin's Demise and stop whining!
---
As far as I know about what the game calls an interrupt, no it shouldn’t count. Not that dead by daylight is consistent, haha.
---
I like the positives of bringing cross progression but I gotta admit, I'm gonna be a little sad if it does happen simply because of the difference between my console account and my pc account, and I probably wouldn't be able to do any sort of "merging" and would have to stick to separate accounts anyway. Would've been really useful when I originally made the switch
---
Thats...not what the placebo effect is but sure. Its been working just fine so ill keep using it until it fails me. Everyone can belive what they want
---
Don't be a dick.
---
As a GF main what the fuck
---
I play Xbox fammm
---
So you do them every single game? All of them? And what if you are not swf? How do you even know if you got them all?
---
i would feed off the emotions of everyone having sex ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
 keep practicing and you can growl at them from beneath the hook! :)
---
It's latency, not hitboxes.
---
In other words, fix your internet.
---
Wait...so you're telling me I can play survivor and let my team mates die and it'll count lmao ?
---
There are literal Archive challenges that consist of cleansing totems now. 
---
Don’t reward killers with another annoying perk to “incentivize” survivors into cleansing. They either will or they won’t. 
---
My group of friends an I are avid totem cleansers. I’ve literally told friends to shut up and hang on the hook for a second while I cleanse a totem and then to get over it because it’s important.
---
A little more time is worse because botanic knowledge give 33%.
---
You don't need to apologize, you weren't wrong to ask here. I have 150mbps internet that I pay 80 dollars for an will occasionally randomly DC from a match. Idk if it actually is internet cutting off for a second. I literally considered the prospect of it being a DDOS and posted it on here because it was after I looped a Spirit for 2 gens. People told me it was probably a problem with DBD. The servers aren't great. At least on console.
---
Hybristophilia
---
I would like to know as well cause i dont know gow to counter, first it tells you where everyone is, second the obsession is literally one shoot and dead even if you Have dead hard, ds, unbreakble... useless
---
Just google it or call your isp.
---
Please finish your thought
---
Oh no! You dirty looper! You were trying to survive because you're a survivor.
---
Like seriously if you can't get smebody in a reasonable amount of time just break the chase and hitch slap the Claudette(I'm sorry my child) that was hiding in the corner all game.
---
That’s toxic
---
Oh shoot. I should change those numbers then.

My experience has been endless prayer beads spirits. People using them up while they're still broken I guess.
---
You seem to be forgetting the fact that closing the hatch starts a 3 minute end-game timer now. Didnt used to do that before.
---
That's one clumsy football team that the killer had to chase after...
---
I need 10 heals... 3 more to go out of 5 games
---
How would they be rank 17 and not know what a pallet is
---
Which is weird, because when they rolled out the new policy they specifically said trash talk is fine. I was under the impression that as long as it didn’t directly insult someone it was allowed. I think the issue is that it’s an automated process, so when it’s too short for you to appeal it you’re screwed by it
---
Nurse still has the ability to traverse the map quickly and to ignore every defense mechanism survivors have. She ain't weak. It's just that her blinks feel stubby without her old range add ons, and her recharge mechanic feels clunky as hell.
---
Spirit, is getting hits to all her best add-ons, is losing her potential to play the killer shack for hits after the pallet was dropped, and can no longer tell when she's run into a survivor in phase (which is a much bigger deal than it sounds). Despite all that, none of these nerfs make Spirit *feel* any worse to play.
---
Nurse dropped off the face of the earth after her nerfs, even though she's still the strongest killer in the game.
---
Spirit is gonna stick around.
---
Nerf pig?

Bruh, ultra rares on survivor are pretty stupid as well. Gens already go way too fast with toolboxes and then you slap insta percent with BNP on it? Insta-blind flashlights? Old insta-heals? Just....no.
---
Sure, some killer ultra rare add-ons are broken as shit as well, but at least it is only one of them instead of 4 BNPs on commodius toolboxes.

Placebo Effect (noun)
---
A beneficial effect produced by a placebo drug or treatment, which cannot be attributed to the properties of the placebo itself, and must therefore be due to the patient's belief in that treatment.
---
In other words:
---
The placebo "works" not because it does anything, but because you think it should.
---
So in this context; you "see" the shards glowing, not because they are actually glowing, but because you think they are glowing.
---
I guess it's easier to just say "WAAAAAAH THERE'S NO COUNTERPLAY PLZ NERF" instead of learning the matchup lol.
---
Why do the challenges rely on sandbagging yourself or you team?
---
Want to play together? I can PM you an steam friend code and we can hang out together and “try” to have a good time, haha.
---
I love all the perk ideas though, my personal favorite is Cat's dead, details later.
---
I was fucking back to camping pallets like a rank 21 with that challenge and the "pallet stun the killer 2 times in one game". What a disgrace lol.
---
Hell I just popped syringes and styptics. Instant depletion!
---
The joke is that there are people like you out there who eat it like a whole onion.
---
Oh wow I didn’t expect to see an actually joke on this subreddit, certainly welcome, got anymore?
---
My philosophy when i watch content creators is, if i would get annoyed playing with the person in chat- i probably won't watch them.

Gen repair noises can be used to hide loud sounds like healing, though, so maybe they won't notice it.
---
I don't think Otz is that similar, he plays rough, but he gives explanations and his whole gameplay is like analysis, critique, and improve. He teases too, its an interesting balance.
---
You kinda just proved my point , there is no way they can tell who got it legit or who bought or is selling them. Better to just give it to everyone :)
---
Rancor should be great on stealth killers now hey?
---
For a starters you need to either A) all tag team one gen, which is risky because he can TP to it but it gets the gen done the fastest. Or B) heavily split all gens on the map making sure you don't 3 gen yourself. This makes it borderline impossible for Freddy to intercept all of you on gens. You cannot have an in between, its either you tag team one gen or split them. In my experience option B has worked most reliably.
---
Of course for this to happen you need to take advantage of your early game where none of you are asleep (unless RPB) and maximise gen speeds. Make sure to be having long chases and wake up whenever you can.
---
If ur on that gen and can’t see that totem u blind and deaf
---
Yup - It's a mess out there.
---
There is something pure about that
---
I still feel like I'm in my 20's, I'm in my 40s though. Fucking life man.
---
Hell yeah it’s 270 time boiz
---
I own it as well. Why do you care so much? ^But ^muh ^exclusive ^cosmetics
---
I really like trapper tbh, pick 3 gens and gradually set yourself up around them cutting off all loops.
---
Otz is the most wholesome and informative killer main ever: Hes the best!
