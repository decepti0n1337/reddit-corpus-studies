I really like solo queue DBD because it makes you feel isolated and alone and the fact that survivors don‚Äôt speak and just scream really enforces it. SWF is just not fun to play with/in/against. I play both killer and survivor and every time I‚Äôve been with a swf group I‚Äôve hated it. 
---
---
---
Watch out, you might get someone offended
---
DS and NOED are a part of the game, but they aren‚Äôt fun to play against. 
---
Damn, nice to have you back, your videos were one of the most entertaining to watch! 
---
Couldn't say it better, Spirit doesn't necessarily need perks to terrorize the survivors, but in the other sense, she can make use of many perks to make her even more terrifying. 
---
Yeah I'm rank 5 I didn't include that. I'm in the midwest too. 
---
those are some weirdly huge uvs. Is the gen texture atlas packed or something?
---
Seriously how did you do it I ended up trashing it because it was going up like 1 second for the past 3 weeks and I‚Äôve played quite a lot in that time?! 
---
[removed]
---
Would be good if the survivor that cleansed the totem got cursed in some way throughout the rest of the game.  Nothing too major but some kind of hindrance, a random one to spice things up for the survivor too.  I feel there needs to be some kind of risk to cleansing.  There should be something scary/risky about messing with those things.  They do look kinda creepy but that's all...
---
Lmao oh Mikey. They nailed this chapter so well
---
Never stated survivors Only, I said mostly. I play with them and I do pay attention to their shit. I play with killer when I feel like it (though am a beginner as killer) and again I see their bitterness poured on you for anything you do in that match.
---
I never got a message from a killer telling me I was an idiot, stupid, newbie, that I suck and what not because I couldn't dodge him, he got me, he mori-ed me, etc ( in my early days). But when I play killer I sure have a full chat on PS app, telling me how bad I was in the most unorthodox way. My experience and what I heard/read from the others tells me the survivors are the majority toxic.
---
Right, but you said, matter of factly, "I reward the ones who rat out the ones hiding in lockers." Does this not imply you reward *every* snitcher, not just ones who snitch on useless teamates? I can get it if the teammate is tbagging, putting other survivors at risk, etc etc-- but you stated ALL. Even the ones who ratted on an innocent player. 
---
Legion gets it for free. 
---
I am rank 6 and it happened to me. I haven‚Äôt played the game for two days because of this.
---
Don't count on one until an important holiday of some sort happens.
---
Not interested in your biased opinion Scott. If you think it actually matters to anyone because you're good at a video game, I think it speaks a lot about who really needs to grow up.
---
easy fix, killers move slower if they are walking backwards for more than a few seconds. (so they can still use backwards walking for mind games around pallets)
---
Ok. Thanks. 
---
You're a smartass for hiding in a locker so you can get an easy, safe unhook? Since when?
---

---
Do whatever you wanna do as long as you literally don't *praise* the person who snitched. If you were so kind, you would even *ignore* it, but, seems to me you wouldn't do that kind of thing.
---
I think you have that backwards. 
---
Yeah I've just been playing killer until whatever is going on is fixed. 
---
Rank 5. 
---
I wouldn't think that would be an issue this far into the season though. 
---
Better than shit talking people on a live stream, huh. If I'm toxic I wonder what that says about the people who I think are toxic.

Leatherface‚Äôs addons work. 
---
As a survivor main who runs DH I'd never exploit a unlimited use glitch ;)
---
Same amount of time does not mean same amount of work. The killer has to be there all match while the survivors can get out first and hoop in a new match
---
There are so many bugs after the unreal engine update. Hopefully they will be fixed soon. 
---
Yeah hope so, this happens every few games
---
I would say rework Frenzy and up his base speed to like 115. Y'all know how in order to get Michael to t3 ya gotta stare at the survivors. Make Feral Frenzy kinda like that. Now instead of like staring at the survivors, it could be called like a "rage" meter. Everytime he loses a Chase, gets stunned, a survivor is healed, etc he gets closer to using his ability. For example, lets say "3 pallet stuns = 1 full feral Frenzy charge." His frenzy would still work the same, he could run around stabbing everyone. 
---
Now survivors might say "yeah but if it takes that long for him to Frenzy, and deep wounds are no biggie, wouldn't that be a big boy Nerf?" Well to that I say that survivors can mend themselves to 75% and they will need a help from a friend to mend completely. "But Kenny, the legion could walk backwards and do the dirty to me." Well bucko, what if you could hold a button to stop the mending going down? That way you could still be in the chase and not worry about the Legion doing you dirty like that. For example you're in a Chase and he turns around. No worries, they should make it so you can hold idk LB or M1 to stop the mending timer from going down as you're running. If you're already injured, and got rid of the deep wound effect, next time you get it will have you at 50%. Then the next will have you at 25%. Any other time will get you down to 25% on the timer.
---
Those are my thoughts. Given I'm no expert, feel free to add/change and all that good stuff. 
---
Oh! And his add-ons could help with hi rage meter. From it lasting longer, him running faster in Frenzy, getting the meter charged all the way, etc. 
---
Can the killer see the blood too?  That's pretty wild!
---
Hardly say that‚Äôs obsessed
---
There's a tutorial for a reason.

I have never, and never personally had, the 4% respected. I don't think increasing the chances of it happening will make it get respected anymore. 
---
Yea ...NO. Franks mix tape 2 hit moonwalk would like to have a word with you.
---
Again, get yourself a decent headset. Your flea market Chinese knock off obviously ain't doing what you need it to do. I can literally hear exactly where everyone is at in this game as both killer and survivor. This also isn't about being a survivor or killer main so your flippant remark about that is also as pointless as your argument.
---
Same thing happend to me. Tried to get adept Dwight trophy on ps4. so I lvl‚Äôd him up to lvl 15 but the trophy never pop‚Äôd after 3 escapes I gave up and today when I logged back in his lvl was reset back to lvl 4.. 
---
bamboozle is one of the best anti-loop perks of the game. 
---
This aint no competitive game
---
So that‚Äôs why everyone has been getting one hit downed by my pig after gens are done lol
---
i'd recommend watching [entoan](https://www.twitch.tv/entoanthepack)'s stream. I've played against him a few times and he has really strong map pressure. 
---
In a recent stream I saw, he was talking about how sometimes its faster to slug than to bring people to hook, especially if you know they have DS, because every second counts. Dribbling is probably the worst you can do, because of the time it wastes. I think slugging with a purpose can be really effective in this way. (ie only slugging 1-2 at a time). 
---
As a survivor, I don't mind slugs like that because it's a fun challenge to figure out how to heal the person, if I can. 
---
what would be the point in moonwalking with frank's mix tape
---
LEATHERFACE (tm)
---
While LF isn‚Äôt a chapter per say, I‚Äôd say getting him since he‚Äôs 4 bucks, pretty easy to play, and BBQ and Chili is one of the best perks in the game. 
---
Now, it depends on how you wanna play. 
---
SAW CHAPTER 
---
- If you wanna sneak around and stall the game just a little bit, Pig is good. (Has a problem with looping tho) 
---
- Her bear traps can even get you some kills, distract survivors from gens, and also fun fact, survivors can‚Äôt leave through the gate while they have the bear traps on. Free kill! 
---
- (Maybe also I‚Äôm a sucker for the Saw movies.) 
---
- Tapp has some underrated perks but not the best survivor around. I have a soft spot for cops tho! Plus Tapps are pretty good teammates. 
---
CURTAIN CALL CHAPTER 
---
- Clown is a bit boring to me since he‚Äôs gameplay style isn‚Äôt changed up much. Throw a bottle (mind gaming a bit), slow them down and hit. Das it. 
---
- (Personally I hate him because clowns freak me out, his cosmetics are gross, and the gas makes me nauseous. Personal bias I guess  Whoopsies). 
---
- If you like a straight forward killer, he‚Äôs pretty good. 
---
- Honestly Kate is the prettiest of survivors and her perk Window of Opportunity is good for newer players who don‚Äôt know the map yet. Quick and Quiet go pretty great with Dance with me to escape the killer. Locker jukes. 
---
DARKNESS AMONG US
---
- Fuck legion. You will get DCd constantly and also fat Jesus Jeff is probably one of the loudest survivor in the game. 
---
- Up to you on that. Legion can cheese hard, is annoying to play with/against, and overall everyone hates him (for good reasons)
---
SHATTERED BLOODLINE CHAPTER
---
- Spirit is so much fun to play, and enduring/spirit fury is one of the best perk combos in the game. 
---
- The sound bugs tho have made her kinda hard to play as since you can‚Äôt rely on noises as much so I haven‚Äôt seen her in forever. 
---
- Adams deliverance can sometimes make or break a game. Plus the pebble is kinda funny. 
---
- If you love mind games, gen grabs,  and scaring the crap out of survivors, spirit is your gal. 
---
OF FLESH AND MUD CHAPTER
---
- Hag is fun but not too much mind gaming. You kinda more a long the lines of predict survivors routes and where to place traps. 
---
- Ruin is a great perk, Devour Hope can be funny, and the other one is meh. 
---
- If you like satisfying grabs, Make Your Choice kills, and overall sneaking up on people, Hag is great (her phantasms always jump scare me). 
---
- Don‚Äôt know too much about Ace since he isn‚Äôt used a lot and his perks are also somewhat meh. 
---
SPARK OF MADNESS CHAPTER
---
- The doctor completely kills stealth by making survivors scream and revealing their locations. His laugh kinda makes me laugh when he shocks survivors. 
---
- His treatment mode can also prevent survivors from jumping windows, throwing pallets, and most overall interactions. However, survivors don‚Äôt get madness when in lockers. 
---
- He isn‚Äôt too mind gamey but mostly shines with preventing survivors from doing much. The three gen doc is one of the worst things to go against. Expect DCs. 
---
- Monitor and Abuse is used for really stealthy builds (weird for a killer that needs a terror radius but ok), overcharge is ok, and overwhelming presence is ok as well. 
---
- Feng mostly gets played cause of her goofy cosmetics, but her perks aren‚Äôt awful. Lithe is used sometimes, technician is meh, and alert is also meh. Either a great survivor, or a shitty one. No in between. 
---
OVERALL!
---
Hope this helped and sorry it‚Äôs a bit long!
---
Sometimes the end screen is just bugged and it says you‚Äôve de-pipped when you haven‚Äôt. When I‚Äôm back in lobby, I check my rank and I still have my pips.
---
lmfao
---
So the killer using their ability for what it‚Äôs for is ‚Äúbroken‚Äù
---
Fuckin survivor mains 
---
;\_;
---
So now what
---
THAT ZOOM IN SCARED ME!!! 
---
and it‚Äôs probably because myers is one of the killers that scare me the most...
---
I still love it because it's from you
---
Huntress is required 
---
I do it to stop the screaming if i need to hear.
---
Ah yes, the Mortal Kombat 9 Versus Logo, very nice.
---
Yeah, I know, but that's why I'm complaining, bc even on lobby I'm still de-pipped. :(
---
I know what im going to be doing as Legion now ;)
---
Fucking killer mains. It's broken because you arent allowed to attack in that state, why should you be allowed to grab someone? As far as I know, the wraith isnt able to while cloaked.
---
 Can‚Äôt prove it happened, you obviously photoshopped this image
---
‚ÄúWho does that?‚Äù
---
Haha u wish

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/act27v/streamers_deranking_on_purpose_and_then_are_toxic/
---
The dude abides!
---
I could just imagine the sneaking your way through a trial, and then you spot Chucky in the distance slowly dragging a half-dead survivor across the ground. 
---
&lt;3
---
They have less health to deplete after two hits with franks mix tape and a legion following out of chase.
---
The perk is overrated. The most annoying thing about Ruin as survivor is seeing other survs spending 3 minutes trying to find the totem instead of just pushing through it. The perk is really dependent on the survs just overall being bad. 
---
Laughs in restraint addon. 
---
sweet! can't wait to see them. Good Luck!
---
*laughs in disruption*
---
Makes legion viable 
---
That would be different because the Wraith, if standing still, is essentially totally invisible.
---
The logic to get to the point where grabbing can only be done from the mode where you can also attack must be really something else. 
---
Please, lay out explicitly how it‚Äôs unfair. Because ‚Äúhurr durr you can‚Äôt hit in treatment mode‚Äù is not remotely good enough

I'd rather play against a 3 time prestige nurse with omega blinks than play against legion. Killers that think he is weak dont know how to play him. There is no counter to legion and he is zero fun to play against... To the point that I'd rather just dc. 
---
I hear Kate Mains are toxic but I beg to differ. I wouldn‚Äôt say I ‚Äúmain‚Äù Kate but she is the one I play the most, second being Adam. I think Kate mains are just casual players who aren‚Äôt extremely toxic or extremely laid back, just kind of in the middle. 
---
Tier 1 should glow yellow when 2 survivors are on a gen
---
Tier 2 glows yellow with 2 survivors, green with 3 survivors
---
Tier 3 glows yellow with 2, green with 3, blue with 4
---
Or something like that.
---
from the article it says these events occurred in 2014 and 2015, doesn't excuse there crime at all but it was a while ago
---
Nah, it's literally just that. Take Bloodhound and you'll never lose them.
---
I was thinking maybe people are just taking a break after the event. But I've never had this problem the whole time I've been playing this game during peak hours. I think it has to be a bug or something. 
---
I like the challenge of going against a 4 man swf. 
---
Gonna have to hunt some of that down for my collection, thanks.
---
the hag was just the best dlc in the game in my opinion. Hex totems add so much to the game compared to any other kind of perk. Even if they are only there for the purpose of getting destroyed and wasting time, that still adds a tonne.
---
Play both sides so you understand both, teaches you how to play against both sides real well too. Try not to be part of the toxic side of this game albeit small but it is still there. When you're a survivor try not to attempt escape from hook right away let your team help you. As a killer you may have trouble at the beginning finding survivors use the perk whispers as it's great at finding them. Most importantly have fun, best thing about this game is so many different builds and ways to play and many unique killer abilities. There's some good content creators out there you can learn from like HybridPanda and tru3talent among others those are just two of my favorites. Have fun bud
---
Battle mullet David üòè
---
Yep I finally got it yesterday  and got a trophy for completing it lol. Luckily I had two sphincters for teammates who spent the entire match leaping over pallets so the killer spent the whole time going after them. Didn't know it was that difficult that it had a trophy 
---
Yeah, I've been looped for 4 gens by a survivor literally just throwing the pallets down immediatly on that map. So bad if not spirit or nurse
---
I‚Äôm not respecting the 4%, you should respect my hook.
---
Nope, if it was bugged and or glitched they should disable the perk or god forbid fix there shitty game. But they wontand as far as I'm aware the perk works the game is just shit optimized. Like I said not my problem :) 
---
ah that's true I dunno how I didn't think of that! It really is annoying to deal with because it feels really cheesy
---
The freedom to use feral frenzy and to run around really fast and stab multiple people a bunch is what makes them a fun killer in the first place. Making it usable less would make much less fun to play as and make it incredibly situational, being forced to be pallet stunned/letting survivors escape and heal just rewards playing poorly.
---
Map control is key for killers. You want to be sure you‚Äôre applying pressure across the map so survivors don‚Äôt feel super safe doing a gen, even in a distant corner. Do your best to patrol the gens regularly as they will try to spread them out and make it harder to monitor them. 
---
As you do, periodically stalk and try to get some off each survivor. As your gauge fills, don‚Äôt be afraid to stall it just before you hit Tier 3 and save it for when you‚Äôre on a survivor to insta-pop that EW3 and down the unlucky victim. 
---
Perhaps, the toughest part is knowing when to end a chase. If you get a frisky survivor that‚Äôs really tough to catch, stay mindful about those gens as they will often try to lead you away from their friends making progress. 
---
If you are able to, try to get the Doctor perk ‚ÄúMonitor and Abuse‚Äù for him. It allows you to practically walk up to survivors unnoticed and adds a lot of fun to the game too! 
---
Good luck and welcome to the Fog! (:
---
Ohtofu has some great tutorial videos on YouTube there are a couple more youtubers that have them as well. It really helped me when I was just starting. 
---
You got the perfect score but not the perfect quality üòÇüòÇ
---
&gt; Every little bit helps when you're not the type of person to farm everyone off the hook. That and coop actions rewards the most points.
---
But that category caps, and quite easily too from my experience. I'm definately not a top tier juker (TM) but if the killer spends a decent amount of time tunneling me I'm more likely to get my 8k BP in that category from a few pallet stuns and the chase itself over some flashlight blinds while they're stuck in the pallet breaking animation.
---
&gt; that's just what they do because you get fuck all for points doing anything else.
---
If your motivation for flashlight stunning at every dropped pallet they break is maximising blood points, consider the alternative of just running away after getting a pallet stun (1k) for an additional 400 BP if you can break the chase long enough to get the "escaped" event, which can help you get to another pallet and repeat the process.
---
Other alternatives include taking Small Game and removing totems. For every 2 flashlight stuns you could get more points from clensing 1 dull totem. Heck if there is a hex on the map active that's 4x the amount you'd get from one flashlight stun. As an added bonus, you get to laugh at any killer that takes NOED and never gets it because you've removed the totems beforehand. 
---
More often than not the "incentive" for flashlight stunning while a killer is breaking pallets is insult to injury rather than trying to get 250 bloodpoints.
---
&gt; It also does help in some situations escape the killer. 
---
I quote "Sure the flashlight **can** be useful in that situation", I never claimed there was no use for it while they're breaking a pallet. (Which appears to be the situation that's being described with this very meme)
---
*Laughs in Doctor still*
---
Spirit and Nurse are the only killers I don't play (Nurse due to the fact that I play console, Spirit because I haven't gotten around to practicing her). Autohaven is okay for pig if you abuse the ambush for mind games, but yeah, pretty good job so far.
---
Yeah they could, but there are instances where the killer stops paying attention because they think they got the win secured. One time my either was playing and he was trying to kill himself, but ended up getting himself off the hook, and escaped (the killer walked him by the hatch on the way to the hook)
---
I've only seen it twice.
---
I think most people would say get leather face for bbq and chili. One of the best killer perks in the game and it's only been in the shrine once since he came out. Using that perk will help you get more blood points so you can level everyone faster and it's a great tracking perk. 
---
this is somethig im gonna work on ASAP.
---
hey you better take that back don't do david like that or david might just do you
---
To be certain, there's a difference between something being in the game for a reason and not being a good one,and someone just not wanting to play against something. I believe DS is the former and NOED is the latter.
---
I‚Äôm on twitch, and often do this. But I don‚Äôt keep TTV in my name in any capacity. If I‚Äôm playing it ain‚Äôt to promote.
---
Lol at survivors who cry about the game being broken. Just fucking lol
---
Pallets being nerfed? The vaccuum was absolutely broken as fuck and looked ridiculous.
---
Sprint burst nerfed? You mean exhaustion changes? Yeah because doing multiple speed boosts during a chase wasnt bad enough was it. You can still loop a killer long enough now to make them lose the game. 
---
Nerfed windows? You mean you need to approach them in the right way now? Rather than just being instantly safe no matter whether you messed up the loop or not?
---
Survivor is fine now. The only thing that ruins it is camping. The weaker killers in the game still struggle against good survivors. Some people just want it back to the level where any baby survivor can 5 gen loop a killer though.
---
She is one of my favorite killer, luckily she is free on console.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. I deranked to 10 and find instant lobbies now. Frowned upon but it works.
---
more like as soon as i see them across the map I dc, or if i see the deep wounds bar I dc
---
not wasting my time and depipping is great.

I‚Äôve heard about that! Definitely sounds strong (and delicious). I was also wondering, if the Spirit good?
---
People are gonna do what they‚Äôre gonna do fam. 
---
Alts my guy.
---
Yeah, Hag is part of my killer setlist too. She became really playable after they reworked her trap speed.
---
LF is great for BBQ perk as said and it‚Äôs quite invaluable for tracking and BP gains. 
---
As for fun, I say the most fun DLC killer is the Spirit. She is marked as ‚ÄúHard‚Äù in difficulty but I think she‚Äôs actually quite easy to pick up and it is so satisfying whooshing around the map to gens. (: 
---
There's well and truly no point. It would just be a lesson in futility. The argument that you could slip by a killer that isn't paying attention is invalid, because the only reason they stop paying attention now, is because they know you can't get away. The only way you'd make it out is if you were playing against a newbie killer who didn't know any better. 
---
That meme with the kid wearing the boot on his hand.
---
"That survivor that gets pallet saved 3 times, flashlight saved 7 times, wiggles out once, and still gets death hooked before the 2nd gen is done." 
---
Learning how the blood web works is the best thing for new players to get all the perks  and whatever else, just play you can improve naturally. Although 2 tips I can give one for survivors is to check pallets and window loops so you know where to go when you start getting chased, and for killer try to learn the maps and cut them off a straight chase can last an eternity, also always break pallets they will come back to haunt you.
---
Wait... is that Showstopper?

Found the Survivor main. Spirit Fury is the exact same as all the other bullshit perks in the game that are meant to paper over cracks in the game's design instead of actually fixing the game.

I play both, and when I go against a particularly good survivor, I see what he does and copy that into my ever-growing book of strategy. I watched someone mindgame the fuck outta me, letting their whole team escape. I later used that strategy I got from him to outplay a killer to let my entire team escape
---
It's not about him being overpowered, it's about him being the worst killing ever disgned, 0 counterplay if he is not shit and decides not to hit everyone like is intended to, OP addons, not caring about survivor skillcap, and if you really want a nice explanation just see the video on my comment here.
---
only good on nurse
---
god I haven't used crows as a killer in forever. I think this is okay if it gets done.
---
ya it is
---
That's why you're always supposed to wait. I don't do a damn thing until the killer reveal themselves in some fashion then I hop on gens. If I hear a chainsaw then it must be Billy or Leatherface, if I hear a screech then it has to be the Nurse, Michael has that jingle, and the silence tell me it might be Wraith, Pig, or Freddy, but Michael falls into this category as well.((Though Freddy has a jingle but you don't hear it until he's close so I rely on seeing someone fall asleep to know))  
---
This is why I'm a cowardly Feng Min that stick to the shadows unless needed. Lol
---
It really is helpful tho 
---
Thanks all. Forgot about the obsession
---
Definitely the most fun to play against.
---
I rarely seem to play against him these days :( 
---
My man needs to switch to his hammer üòÇ
---
Go troll someone who cares.
---
Michael's the best licensed killer and the only one whose playstyle fit his character so well.
---
But it's fine because we gave you yet another knide wielding killer.
---
Holy shit... I only discovered him the other week and thought he was a pretty humble dude... this is fucking crazy
---
This format wouldn't be bad if there weren't Giant fucking white boxes everywhere.

Unpopular opinion my ass. You just using Reddit buzzwords?
---
It's like getting a mini Tinkerer proc but multiple times per chase. And when you pop up from your trap, you have zero terror radius, and they don't know at all that you're coming. 
---
I thought you were never going to let the developers forget their transgressions; you're still playing this game???
---
"my opinion on SWF has jack shit to do with its popularity." 
---
I've already spelled out my reasoning to you on this, and if you don't understand it by now, I doubt you ever will.
---
"That's extremely pathetic."
---
But not as pathetic and continuing to post here, acting like you'll somehow 'win' by being annoying enough. 
---
"killers are meant to have the advantage in this game"
---
And again, you make it clear that you don't want game balance. Got it. 
---
"A slight edge doesn't mean OP."
---
If it's so slight to you, it sounds like you can do without it. But no, you're still whining about it. Kind of like... a baby!
---
"I don't "shit talk about balance""
---
Yes you do.
---
"For that matter, you act as if the killer being allowed to see your items is the end of the world."
---
I'm saying it's an advantage they don't need, plain and simple. Go into a game double blind. Even playing field. You're the one continuing to whine on and on about how much you want the advantage anyway.
---
"I don't facecamp (lmao) and I don't want "an ez win""
---
You won't change my mind on that simply by saying otherwise. 
---
"Once again, like your replies before, you're assuming shit about me just because you don't like what I'm saying."
---
No, I'm making my observations based off how obviously one sided all your comments are.
---
"I'm done talking to someone who's as immature as you. I have a game to play."
---
LMAO. "I have a game to play.", like this somehow wins the argument for you. Like you aren't gonna come back and read every single word I've written. If you were somehow so much more mature than I, you wouldn't have stuck around this long buddy. But we're several messages in now. If you didn't feel like you lost before, suddenly declaring your 'win' like that is the same as waving a big white flag of surrender. 
---
If this really is goodbye, and since I know you'll read this no matter what, I'll say again: May your queue times for playing killer remain long and boring.
---
Let's see if your lack of immaturity can hold out, or if you'll come back with more BS. 
---
I'm a Legion main and they really need to fix that exploit. It feels ludicriously unfair to down someone who escaped you because of poor game design.
---
That's not how this format works, but I'm picking up what you're putting down.
---
To be honest, it's not uncommon for people to keep that tag on.
---
He looks fly as fuck. I'm still waiting for my hair to get like that.
---
If you pause over the downed survivor and look around chances are you will see one of those three musketeers rushing for the epic save and you can then chase them while slugging the guy who's lying on the ground.
---
If you don't like slugging then sure, I can understand that. But you can still smack them once before coming back to the downed person.
---
But there isn't a 4% chance of survivors spawning next to your totem, that's like a 73% chance.
---
/s
---
I just hate his whole kit. I wouldn‚Äôt mind his stupid run if he wasn‚Äôt able to miss 3 swings in 2 seconds and hit his fourth without any fallback. Ugh. His vaulting is the fun in his kit, I think they should play with that more to make it less unplayable.
---
That's on everyone AFAIK. It's happened to me on Spirit, Doctor, Legion, Hag, and Shape.
---
This meme is so old it thinks Wraith is overpowered and that Spine Chill is mandatory
---
And Auric Cells.
---
Ok
---
Further proof killers in this game are all sadistic pricks.
---
That and Injured survivors start with 1/3rd of their bar gone.
---
Is that a bottle of Hawaii punch in the car back there? Am I being obvious or am I crazy?((I mean I am crazy, but you know))
---
I was coming to the conclusion it was just casual players who weren‚Äôt very good and wanted to be the ‚Äòprettiest‚Äô  survivor lol. Nothing wrong with any of that of course, but I can see where survivors would get frustrated. But I‚Äôve also had some pretty tryhard Kates on my team so idk.
---
I love playing spirit. Her lunge is kinda short though and messes me up sometimes. 
---
Go comment on every single post in a sub where people care about what you have to say 
---
me? I dont really care, if so. Reddit means little to me.
---
They do. It's that big-ass list you don't read in the patch notes.
---
Like tbh if people play legion like that, I‚Äôd say just play someone else. I play legion and try to do the full 28 stabbing shit 
---
I think I‚Äôll have to buy her, she looks great
---
I thought it was a cool idea. I wish people would post more killer ideas.
---
damn people really get butthurt about the n-word meme even tho im not actually saying shit
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Lmao I was so confused. I kept doing gens with other people to get this up and it never happened
---
So is he garbage or overpowered? 
---
Really?
---
Spirit feels fair. Nurse does not.
---
You can still loop spirit at certain spots, and many make mistakes at pallets. 
---
With nurse if they know what they're doing then you're fucked, and they teleport though walls.
---
What gets me the most, is the sound he makes when he chainsaws. It makes me so angry for no reason.
---
He is just garbage. if you want an good explanation you can just see the video I linked in the comments
---
Was it wreckers yard? That has to be the worst. Hundreds of pallets, and multiple jungle gyms right next to the shack.
---
I got wretched shop later too which had the extremely close (under 14m) pallets but wasnt as bad as wreckers yard can be.
---
I've been grabbed off the basement chest twice by scratched mirror Myers before I knew who I was facing, scared me so bad 
---
Lol that's a stupid idea. You could block killers for any reason then. Good at the game? Block!
---
As a killer main I tuink this would be pretty neat, it could change the meta (hillbilly) however when it comes to the "god pallets" it would be incredibly difficult as a killer to manuver around that pallet (ex the killer shack pallet)
---
Adam's high top is included as a new survivor
---
Same here, rank 8 survivor on PS4 and cant find matches after the event. Apparently nobody wants to play killer in purple and red ranks due to the FPS. I switched to my secondary account (rank 13 survivor) and i was able to find lobbies in 30 seconds. 
---
*Sees this*
---
"Oh haha funny joke?"
---
*Sees your name*
---
"Oh... Oh no."
---
I actually feel like I missed a comment where he said what you accuse him of thinking, because from what I can see, he just made an absolutely valid point that basing your entire opinion on someone off on how they act in a game is pretty immature.
---
Also, why say that his criticism of your comment is invalid because he is biased? 
---
I would have made the same point, biased or not. 
---
Lol exactly. No idea how he arrives at the conclusion it's "fair".
---
You get banned for using third party programs to gain an advantage...except voice comms, thats totally fine.
---
Now before anyone tells me I suck and I need to git gud, I don't have an issue as much with good killers, but when Pig has a stealth feature to sneak up on survivors and they use voice comms to tell their buddy when you enter the building they're in, there's no way in hell thats fair. It completely nullifies a killer stealth ability.
---
Funnily enough I didn't even do that. I was farming BP so I wanted to stab people 4 times. In total one guy had his deep wounds tick down after I was palletstunned and it wasn't the saltbag who commented. 
---
Poor sweater boi. Too many people booli my main ;-;
---
Agree. Flashlights used correctly are horrible but the other side of that is many survivors can't use them properly and either waste time or get hit in the process.
---
"Drinking alcohol, you?"
---
I can‚Äôt play against the hag. I need to take my headphones off for that match so I don‚Äôt get the shit scared out of me, and even then I basically just try to die as quickly as possible to end it
---
3 of those are edited out and replaced by me, can you guess which one wasn't changed?
---
You need to diversify. If all you do is unhook and heal you aren't gaining any points in some emblems.
---
I'm not as far as him in saying that it's super easy to pip... but it isn't difficult. Do gens. Save people opportunistically. Win chases.
---
and i still hold the belief that presentation and how things look can help the game, half of this game is psychological after all 
---
Would be great if there is a timer. If the gates are open you have 3 minutes to left. Then the game ends and the survivors don‚Äòt get the escape points. Hatch should stay closed if gates sre open. Many people also don‚Äòt know that the hatch doesn‚Äòt spawn if there are too many gens left. They are searching for it even if there is nothing...
---
As a killer main I agree with this message.
---
True. Billy's won't like their ability to YEET across the map to be disturbed. The thing is, killers have a perk to break pallets faster, and survivors don't have any perks that affect the strength of the pallet. Though there's an alternative idea where it takes more than one attempt to break. Still gives the survivors a bit of an edge but doesn't make the god pallets so godly for those seconds. Something like... if you're chainsawing or if that quick pellet breaking perk, it takes two attempts, but a normal break takes 3. As long as it's done with with either timing to get the token, or giving tokens at the start of the match, so it's balanced well. 
---
"Mrs crab warned us about them!"
---
well, we can  also Change it by saying, survivors who want Camping, tunneling, noed, slugging, juggling gone are just bad.
---
but I agree
---
modern problems require modern solutions
---
Prepare to be constantly covered in crows...
---
Getting it on survivor
---
Quite impressive. Out of curiosity, did you have one perk/character you mainly used?
---
I feel like julie is really unrepresented so i appreciate this
---
I think Kate‚Äôs is pretty well written. Beyond that I agree. 
---
It was the huge map. Think that's wreckers right? I pretty much threw the game to get that one survivor. They weren't even good as looping. Legit just threw down every pallet on the map while others did gens. They we're untouchable playing like that. I was wraith
---
Was a fun game, I don't normally get too excited about plays made, but really enjoyed this one and wanted to share.
---
Classic survivor main, when confronted with logical statements he turns to his most basic form a ToXiC sUrViVoR. Grass still rustles and what not but footsteps are the busted thing right now. It's a legitimate issue regardless of whatever nonsense you prattle on about.
---
Plus hag! Her traps always scare the living shit out of me.
---
Holy shit that's horrifying sounding. 
---
When your team mates d/c...
---
You forgetting brown shirt Claudette? 
---
Go figure it was a bait one lol. 
---
Wait what?  I thought Legion was underpowered as fuck.  I don't play Legion or survivor, so I never get any experience with him, but this sub had me believing he was unusable trash.
---
I just like the bp multiplier. The aura reading helps but the free money is where it‚Äôs at üò©üëÖ
---
Leatherface and Billy have nearly identical addons, but they don't even have ultra rares and very few purple addons, so I wouldn't say either of them have addons that are OP. Both of their reduced chainsaw charge time addons can be very strong though. Leatherface's chili addons are fairly strong too.
---
FACTS
---
Lol no its effective and has no counter , super toxic especially with franks mixtape.
---
After two htis and franks mixtape you have about 1/3 if not less health the bleed out is a about 10 seconds moon walking. 
---
Or they could just run out of the gates... I don't see what the point would be in hiding out of spite and losing out on the BP for surviving when the reason they want to find the hatch is... more BP. 
---
Agreed, plus with mass hook campers your simply helping them kill you faster. I think it should give you an adrenaline style speed boost or maybe reduced scratch marks. I mean most of the time the escape attempts fail so it barely worth trying
---
You're Not wrong dunno why the downvotes. When he isn't proxy camping a hook as killer to get at least one kill he is being the most immersed claudette main out their. But he is a streamer so gotta say he's good.
---
I meant bug wise like not working
---
Julie‚Äôs female survivor walk is still the scariest thing in this game for me. Nothing more unsettling then the ordinary 
---
May I introduce you to our Lord and Saviour Silent Bell Wraith?
---
Oh I figure you meant broken as in OP lol, I haven't seen any bugs with them sorry.
---
Meg players.
---
Or they suddenly come outta nowhere and find u mending but u can‚Äôt stop mending cuz you‚Äôll go down anyway
---
So Adam is cosplaying him?
---
But the charge add ons are broken lol
---
afaik Ardetha mentioned someone recently that the idea with Claudette was to make all her clothes somewhat bright to nerf the camo effect. They never did.
---
Monitor and abuse + scratched mirror boi
---
But he already wears a sweater all year round!
---
That‚Äôs what I love so much about the Legion! A lot of the other killers feel like ‚Äúfiction‚Äù, but they feel eerily realistic and close to home.
---
I mean gen tapping with ruin exists and so does juggling with decisive strike. I get what you are saying, but I think calling it an exploit when these are things that were brought to the dev's attention when Legion was added is a bit much. No one says survivors are exploiting hatch mechanics when they initiate a hatch stand off with killers.
---
And even inconsistent about writing in white boxes.
---
Story: Normal game as usual. They are knocking gens out pretty quick. I hit unlimited EW3 and start bodying them left and right. Eliminate first two players really quick. Third player I down is Jeff (playing as Jake). I realize there's one left and I haven't seen them all game. I leave Jake bleed out for now (no hook) and go look since the hatch game is something I always lose. Nothing. Nada. Nowhere to be found. AFK? Nope. I'm all over the map looking every nook and cranny. But then I realize they probably know where the hatch is and Jake is about to bleed out. So I run back to Jake, pick him up at the last second, let him escape, he finds Meg, and Meg is just standing there with a WTF expression. I pop the corner and down Meg. Jake is tbagging her bad. I let him. This goes on and goes for quite a while. I accidentally misclicked and kill Jake and since he was almost bleed out from last time, he dies instantly. :( I wanted to let him escape. So I go and hook Meg and wait for the postgame salt.
---
Lesson in point: Don't be selfish and let your teammates bleedout when killer isn't around because you found the hatch and want to escape. This is something I live by. I always go back for teammates. 
---
seems fun, ill try it !
---
Doctor laugh auto wins cause its the best laugh together with Billy the puppet.
---
i thought took longer then that i guess your right then, a dedicated surv who really wants to "beat" the killer and not die can just hide and move every so often and stall out the game,  yes you get extra points for at least trying to escape but some survs will reason oh hes playing hillbilly i wont even try its not possible to escape lets deny him a win and get a tie,
---
 theirs also the factor of game ending if the killer is about to win like 3 mins are up and killer is about to hook you killer is denied a win that doesn't feel good, game should only end once chase ends i think if 3 minute timer ends
---
survs main will complain killer gets extra points and not them its a good solution, there cant be solution that favors killersurvs will complain and since they are 4 and killer is once their complaints will win 
---
look this solutions works just not perfectly if its this or nothing i like the change
---
Yep! It is so satisfying to complete it and to see that gate open though.
---
Dora x Huntress crossover.
---
p3 claudette  or a insidious billyü§†
---
They are neat.
---
The other posts have gotten the gist of it, but something else to try is this, when you do get Evil Within 95-99% stalked up, don't just immediately use it on that survivor your chasing. Feel free to just down them as you normally would. 
---
Once you get them on the hook, using your Evil Within 3 to hinder altruistic plays is game changing. If you can catch someone on the way for the save and just instantly pop it and get them on the hook as well, you've put the survivors in a real bad spot.
---
Of course, context is everything. Sometimes you'll need to charge it up and pop it all on the same chase. You'll get a feel for it over time.
---
Frank's Mix Tape drops hits you need to 3, there's no point running the meter down when they're already in one hit range. 
---
Looks quite cold to be honest.
---
Detective's hunch lets you see important objects in a 64m radius when you finish a gen. This includes totems
---
Cheers, tbh idk why people even claim it shouldnt be allowed lol
---
Nicely done!
---
When I started the game I had no interest in killer, so only played it for dailies and funneled all the points into my survivors, after a while (it felt really easy at low ranks, like, stupidly so) I started trying to see how far I could get on level 1 killers alone.
---
Highest I got was rank 8 before the x2 BP event came along and I felt bad wasting the BP's and levelled some killers.
---
Have you considered trying this for killer side as well? I'd be curious to see how far you could get, and which killer you'd use to do so.
---
Just another day in dbd. Toxic people complaining because you didn't let them win. 
---
A three survivor match. I would have just given you the hatch.
---
Mike is one my favorite s
---
Why are the 3 rank lines green on the left?
---
I agree, but tbh hook campers who literally will not be baited from the hook is frustratingly stupid and cheap way of getting a lot of easy points. So maybe there should be some changes made there
---
Rare case where the killer and the survivor actually got along.
---
It probably would however probably backfire and increase the nurse and spirit meta and encourage counterplay characters in pallet looping (clown, trapper, doctor-ish) and hillbilly would prob be impacted by this (ARGGG KARMA!)
---
Survivors just don't like going against him because he leaves no room for counterplay. You're either a good legion or a really bad legion. Add-ons like Frank's mixtape make him very strong. 
---
You can't really get away from Legion since he can just vault whatever you vault. 
---
In my opinion, I love playing him, I think he's really fun but most survivors hate him simply because he can't really be countered. 
---
So he's Adam? You warned him to stay away from trains right?
---
Alternatively, punish the killer for camping by actually sticking around so your three teammates can work on gens for the duractipn of the struggle.
---
It is because they are all tactics that if used correctly win games. Both sides think they are entitled to win and so make up rules for what the other team is or isn't allowed to do so that it is 'fair'. When in reality 'fair' just means totally one sided towards the team with the made up rulebook.
---
I know it breeds a lot of shit. But t bagging is a great way to keep that killer distracted and on you instead of gens.
---
one kill hook camping is ~9-10k so even if they dont chase they still get plenty. if they chase one or two survivors theyll get enough for pips and ~15k, if they hook and kill the second guy its around ~25K. if you have noobs who try rescue them the killer often gets two plus or even a win which is at least 30k and rank up
---
Simple point is its a very rewarding cheap way to farm points - ive even seen guides recommending it (camping as leatherface etc)
---
I think today was their first day back
---
Yea, plus I have that issue with losing rank sometimes too I‚Äôll leave on 6 and come back at 8. Fucked
---
Fuckin' Phil... 
---
Sweeeeeedes b√∂rk b√∂rk
---
Yep killer is easy, maybe hot after rank 8 but i haven't bothered going further than that yet - killers much easier than survivors because you rely on your own skill not the skill of 3 randoms
---
If your a decent survivor you should be aware of what perks or add-ons a killer will run and how to react to these. 
---
e.g. hex:ruin find the todem asap
---
Killer would be very hard imo especially the higher you get to ranks. Survivors with full perks and items against one level 1 perk and no addons. If you are mediocre to good with nurse, you'd be able to get pretty high, maybe rank 5, and if you are god tier then you can get rank 1 easily. Other killers that have a chance are hillbilly and maybe, just maybe, hag because of distance camping and ruin. As for me, I'd use hillbilly and go as far as I can, but I doubt I'd get rank 1. 
---
I‚Äôve been having the same issues on PS4, except the other way around. I‚Äôm a rank 1 killer but get yellow and green ranks sometimes. I usually think the survivor(s) is just a potato until after the game and I see their rank
---
This is so cute.
---
So is Legion actually considered top tier if you use this strat?
---
Yes! I don't understand why more people don't do this. Punish campers by giving them less kills struggle until the end and if you see someone being camped go do gens!
---
Use the edges of the map, ppl don‚Äôt really look at  the outer walls while scanning for the killer. Stalk from as far as you can peeking around a corner, when you hit tier 2 there is still no heartbeat and you can 99% ur EW then go in and pop it next to them. Myers needs no perks, he‚Äôs the shit. 
---
Why should they do this? They would lose points.  I‚Äôm playing survivor 90% of the time and never stayed that long just to piss others off. Also you lose a game feels the same like dying. You lose your item, get no points. Waste of time for everybody. And you could go further. If the killer gets you in the three gime period he gets extra points. But to be fair survivors who left the game as soon as they activate the gates should get more escape points. It works for other escaping games why shouldn‚Äòt it here? 
---
And considering that balanced landing is pretty useless on most macmillans, auto heavens and farms, sometimes I had no perks lol
---
started playing a week ago and in my games more survivors were salty than killers. played mostly survivor with friends, but the few games i played killer they complained a lot like "hard camp" etc. which wasnt even true. that game i hooked someone. ran away, searching for other survivors and they suddenly almost bumped into me, because they were tunneling on the hooked person. ignoring me completely. how is this camping when they run into me? same with people trying to unhook other players, while i'm chasing them. 
---
does dbd have this kind of community? or does it get better at "higher ranks" (dont even know how the matchmaking works lol).
---
Default Hair Feng or I uninstall Kappa
---
And by the time an actual game loads there's only 3 players yup. I'm seeing all of those. 
---
Or maybe I should just pretend to be an NPC character that runs around attacking people rather than trying to "win" per se.
---
Agreed. And keep their safty pip. 
---
That‚Äôs actually really cool
---
Ok there‚Äôs nothing wrong with doc fam if you can‚Äôt play against doc you just need to ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù
---
It 100% is. Those tags are meant to come off. They are purposefully sewed with a thread call basting stitching and are meant for easy removal. They use the same thread in the pockets, and that thread should also be taken out. 
---
This coming from a rank 1 killer, I don‚Äôt think that camping a survivor once the exit gates are open is a big deal. Facecamping I can‚Äôt endorse but just patrolling the area is fine by me as long as the exit gates are open.
---
But that‚Äôs the only time I would warrant camping a hook. During the start and mid game camping isn‚Äôt fun for anyone, especially the survivor. While I can‚Äôt deny that I‚Äôve done it before to a survivor that was driving me insane, I still take no satisfaction in the act of camping, just the toxic player dying. 
---
Once you‚Äôve hooked someone I‚Äôd say leave them alone though. If they get unhooked instantly or shortly after you leave then go for the prick that farmed the guy on the hook, not the person you just hooked. Tunnelling is equally as unfair for the survivor as camping, so avoid that too.
---
Really their should be no need to camp at all if you‚Äôre a good killer and smart about how you choose to chase and down the survivor (whether that be using the killers power properly or mind gaming the survivor). Doing solid throughout the game will ensure that any survivors still left alive at the endgame will be on at least their second hook, preferably their last hook. 
---
Really you just need to get familiar with how the killer works, in particular the one you use the most so you can end chases and move on faster. Camping gives the survivors adequate time to do plenty of gens, so moving on to other survivors as fast as possible is key.
---
being 40+ m is patrolling id say being stationary &lt;25m from hook for 2-3 minutes
---
I don‚Äôt agree that you should always go back for your teammates no matter what. Excessive altruism often just gets you killed and what was a 3k for the killer suddenly becomes an easy 4k. Don‚Äôt get me wrong if I see a chance to help my teammates that‚Äôs not just going to get us both killed I absolutely will take it but you have to weigh the risk involved. Unlimited EW3 Michael is intimidating as hell so I don‚Äôt really blame that person for not rushing to the rescue. I do agree that the way they acted in the end chat was uncalled for. Let‚Äôs be real tho, lots of times when killers slug a survivor they don‚Äôt go far because they‚Äôre hoping to catch out the altruistic person and more often than not it works which is why they do it.
---
A really similar situation happened to me during the blood point event. I was up against a Michael with unlimited evil who slugged my teammate to try to lure me out and when I wouldn‚Äôt take the bait he picked her up before she could die from bleed out. Thing is I could see him patrolling the slugged person so me charging out there and getting one shot was going to benefit no one but the killer so I didn‚Äôt do it. He had it out for me for whatever reason tho, probably because he never managed to hook me and I used fire crackers to escape him at one point (tho if he‚Äôs got unlimited evil I think it‚Äôs fair for me to use fire crackers) anyway long story short my teammate was going to betray me so I just gave myself up. He hooked me and let her escape. It angered me at the time but I wouldn‚Äôt change my decision. 
---
yeah this is trash 
---
Killer then rages at you for looping 
---
Killer without any of the meta perks would be *rough* especially since you start facing meta survivors starting at low teens to high single digits. If you‚Äôre running a no addon/no perk killer at that point you are going to have a hard go of things to say the least.
---
Technically its only advance to the rear 
---
Why you throwing out an opinion like that if you've never played at the highest level, lmao? 
---
But removing them takes so much time that worrying about it hurts you since not all killers run noed. I don‚Äôt run noed since survivors usually don‚Äôt get 5 gens done so anyone thats cleanses dulls is hurting themselves. There‚Äôs no skill involved in noed unless you‚Äôre defending dulls somehow.  Ds has a little skill in hitting a semi small skill check.
---
shoulda looked at the wall.
---
Im assuming you spent bp on killers since you only have 200k
---
I‚Äôve had matches where an Ace or Dwight will just come up drop an item at my feet and it‚Äôs like ; oh thank you fellow survivor friend ( ¬¥ ‚ñΩ ` )
---
"Dwight, you ignorant slut!"
---
Same here
---
Well played.
---
I need to pay more attention the subreddit, I thought OP was a *really* bad surgeon.
---
It looks a bit like if shes pouting.
---
Killers too easy right now. Spirit and nurse give me consistent 3-4ks with a few escaping at hatch.
---
I think it is weird that the hatch does give extra points. Getting out the main gate should be the one that gives bonus points, not the hatch. It is much easier to get a hatch escape than a main gate escape.
---
Find a buddy to play with, that's what I do. I felt the same way as you.
---
Removed. Keep it civil.
---
Which means that the timing of the flashlight save will be ruined and they will not be dropped, which is what happened in this video
---
If only it was Jeff instead of Bill...
---
Fun fact: if you hold sprint you can get away from the chest without doing the 'closing' animation
---
I‚Äôll never like people that play the game this way. 4 stack your group and then all run the nastiest build you can find, and then sit there on stream and act like you‚Äôre good. When you‚Äôve gone to every means necessary to stack the odds in your favor your victory isn‚Äôt worth very much, and your losses are just that much more disappointing. I don‚Äôt get why BHVR has her as a fog streamer with the way she acts.
---
You are impressive when it comes to avoidance of responsibility, I haven't bothered to point out that you simply have no clue about my headset whatsoever and you yourself are assuming but please oh mighty and conveniently enough, Rank 1 bloody pig main who gets 4ks in five mins. Inform me of how you yourself are not toxic, how its not an insult and how you are blameless once more XD
---
This is why I've become a killer main, I can't stand needing to rely on randoms.
---
I kept getting stuck at rank 10-8 an couldn't push any futher due to my teammates just not doing enough/anything.
---
Now a days it's not so hard to solo rank up because of how easy it is to black pip and single pip, but once you play killer for too long solo survivor just feels like a chore lol
---
Hex just needs a rework
---
I bet she doesn‚Äôt kiss ya
---
Doing everything they could in preparation before the game even started to provide the worst experience possible for the killer, being rude on stream to the killer (even if she couldn‚Äôt hear them) and then getting super defensive and acting like the victims when they were called out on playing like pricks.
---
Yup
---
Ohhhh. A player walked up to me once (I was trapper) and did this. I didn‚Äôt know what the heck they were doing so I just hit them and they ran away. 
---
Saw Tofu do Sabomither Squad. That shit is tilting.
---
I got that once and was killed trash and garbo in post game. I mean it‚Äôs true, but 32k is 32k
---
Using perks is NOT bullying! If you want to say it‚Äôs a ‚Äútry hard‚Äù build or whatever, fine. I don‚Äôt think people understand what bullying is. This killer is clearly a whiner if they are crying about even dead hard, come on. Also by this logic, if using the best  perks means you are a bully, does this not also apply to killers? It certainly should. Strongest add ons....ebony Moris sure as hell make the killer a bully.
---
Make sure you always back out to the main DBD menu before quitting the game. And quit it correctly, don‚Äôt just shut down your Xbox. Someone gave me this advice when it was happening to me, and I have never had an issue since. 
---
Yeah, he's a really salty player in general. I've never had him not bitch in my post game lobby.
---
Rainbow Maps with the purple add-on that I cannot recall are the perfect NOED/Totem/Hag counter.
---
Get looped till daylight 
---
Survivor isn‚Äôt as interactive as killer as well, I find killer takes a lot of my focus constantly and is stimulating, some people would call it stressful but that‚Äôs the part that I enjoy, it takes a lot of multitasking and making sure you are keeping the pressure on. Compared to survivor where you can either sit on gens all game or you get chased all game because you are getting tunneled to death. Not fun.
---
Ok so you dont want to try to prevent it, that's fine. But it's still entirely removable after activated. Smart survivors will just hide or leave until they find it after knowing it's activated, so at most you get one or maybe 2 insta downs. Only 2 insta downs is already shittier than Make Your Choice (Unless you think that's OP too I guess)
---
Thanks for the insight, I definitely am interested in Micheal!
---
BIG CHUNGUS XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Postal 2 is i.deed an amazing game! One of my favorite  ofc
---
Careful he'll come in his thread and say to @ him.
---
I thought it was me. I‚Äôm on the one x too and the other night we couldn‚Äôt find any games. 
---
They're kind of like Freddy. Clearly underpowered, but still feel annoying and unfun to play against. They'll probably get only one kill, by tunneling, and the unlucky sod that gets chosen doesn't have much room for counterplay.
---
The GeForce colorblind overlay is pretty good. Not perfect, but you can use sliders to get yourself into a good position so you don't wash out the colors, but still give hard-to-see objects the saturation you need so they pop out more.
---
i can play against him just fine, he's just boring as fuck.
---
‚ÄúPlaying like pricks‚Äù....by using perks!
---
Have you ever watched Ochido? Please do, because you may get a better understanding of what bullying actually is.
---
Having the same issue on ps4. Currently waiting for a lobby. It takes about 5-10 minutes to find a lobby and if I'm lucky everyone stays. 
---
My bf couldn't even access his bloodweb earlier! 
---
I agree with you, but I feel like there's more fun to be had on the survivor side. Overall from game to game I find Killer more enjoyable, however when I have a really hard match of mind games an close calls playing as survivor it gives a bigger sense of accomplishment.
---
Where as a killer I either had a good match or a bad match an it is rarely in between.
---
I hope to one day find out how enjoyable a 4 man SWF can be an not just for the tactical edge it gives but so i can listen to my mates get jump scared an make fun out of shitty situations.
---
What crutch perks can't be countered from survivors? And it is completely fair that survivors can get NOED out before it even pops because you spend a lot of time looking and doing totems which could be spent on doing gens. It stalls the game out for so long. 
---
Guys he said he just started playing killer, so the majority of the perks you are suggesting he won‚Äôt be able to get or use.
---
You weren't holding the game hostage, thus this is not banable.
---
Laughs in freddy 
---
Something something bodyblocking. Real dick move but whatever, do what you gotta do. Pretty sure it's in the "griefing / trolling" category of report. If you're on console I'm eighty percent sure they can't do Jack to you. 
---
I had a match the other day where a Dwight ran Pharmacy, Plunderer‚Äôs and Ace in The Hole. He ran around the map getting all the chests, brought all the items down to the basement, got my attention and brought me down there and showed me all the items. I killed him and he messaged me that he‚Äôs sorry and he‚Äôll bring better gifts next time. I felt bad so when I ran into him the next game I let him live and get the hatch. 
---
you should honestly  make a youtube video, like seriously, your stuff is amazing. I've been thinking of making one myself but I don't know the first thing about making the mask. I would love some pointers if you can spare a minute. Love your work and keep it up
---
Gotta get those blood points some how üòÇ
---
No you can't leave without penality. Quitting gets rid of the blood points you gained during the match
---
In what way is that trolling or griefing lol. Dont make things up.
---
That post history tho...
---
I just wanna point out in PTB y‚Äôall were saying ‚Äúthis killer weak AF.‚Äù I‚Äôm not disagreeing but the change is nuts lol
---
nah what he did is 100 percent allowed. the devs really need to explain better on the report what each of them really means
---
Yeah bodyblocking is in there as a bannable offense. We‚Äôre you preventing them from playing the game by trapping them in the basement? Yes you were. Therefore yes it‚Äôs bannable. I get the strategy. It‚Äôs a smart strategy to try to win. But yes it‚Äôs technically holding the game hostage because they couldn‚Äôt play the game for a good two minutes. 
---
I just remembered reading it under that category in the report menu
---
Oh okay disregard me then. Oops. Thanks for clarification
---
You'll lose BP and lose two pips. 
---
There really isn't a punishment for leaving unless you leave more games than you play (I think thats what the devs said).
---
Atleast you know I'm not bashing on people with 10hrs at rank 20. is basically all you should really pull from that.
---
Oh, that really sucks. I don't camp at all, I hook and go back to checking generators as the chase is the fun part. I noticed these two guys weren't the nicest of folks when they let the other two survivors sit from first hook to death...
---
I came back to this game after seeing it had so many new killers and planned updates. This really spoils my interest.
---
Unless they drop down in the big room in front of the washroom and walk straight towards you. Then it becomes either a game of 'can I get to the pallet in time' or 'musical lockers.'
---
They're ultra rare. So they're supposed to be ultra good.
---
3 survs, body camps the hatch. What a winner.
---
It gets both better and worse the higher the rank. The best/most fun players are usually rank 13 to 7. Any others are usually try hards or people who have no idea how to play
---
I always DC. I have no shame.
---
Jesus you are pathetic. 
---
If you play legion properly without addons, he‚Äôs garbage. If you play legion the cheesey way, again without addons, he‚Äôs fucking broken. Just an awful killer all around 
---
His "toxic" series is laughable.
---
He is not toxic in it at all, and in fact plays pretty nicely.
---
The most toxic he has been is the legion one, and only because its toxic by default to use the broken Strat. 
---
Edgar can be a cool dude. I enjoy the positiveness that happens most of the time during his streams. But when he plays SWF it's like he forgets hes a killer main. The dude always runs the most crutch builds, and the VOIP. As for Jen, I steer clear of her stream. I have nothing against her on a personal level, but I do have an issue with how he acts during her streams.
---
The de-ranking to stay in green/purple ranks to bully killers, constant VOIP SWF. Literally every time I have tried to watch her stream I couldn't because I don't care to see constant SWF vs killers with less skill. Then you have the toxic comments about the killer, or excuses for being downed. This video alone is a good example of why I don't watch her content. She promote toxic behavior and her viewers emulate how she acts. I don't see why she is a Fog Whisperer when her content has so much toxicity in it. While people like TRU3 who promote good sportsmanship and overall better health for the game are passed over.
---
It‚Äôs more just clickbait, and it works. I admit it‚Äôs fun to just watch somebody wreck survivors when you yourself can‚Äôt play that well on every killer. 
---
OchiDo since bans(early spring) doesn't really do bad things either, you know. 
---
he plays PS4 with a full swf and flexes on killers. he does say stupid ass shit but he doesn't really do anything bad anymore.
---
the only difference between him and n00b3 is that he actually changed his explosive attitude(he's a Spaniard after all, they're famous for short temper), kept the toxic shit his audience like and just makes videos consistently. like an actual adult youtuber. 
---
n00b always suffered from "lack of ideas". his videos, almost half of their time, is a shitty attempt to make those longer by inserting absolutely unnecessary edits. other dbd YouTubers/streamers never do this. I mean there is an edit here and there but they're never long and more like transitions instead of 2-3 minutes of poorly edited bits.
---
tru3 never actually uses killers, you know. instead of unleashing their potential, actually using their powers, he turns them into skins somehow with different animations =\ his builds are almost always the same: the ones that help him in chase. he's very efficient but he doesn't use killers properly, he never plays on their strengths and never uses perks to remove weaknesses. boring. 
---
Monto and Ardetha are the ones to actually be educational. they do use proper perks for proper killers. they explain everything and very careful with their opinions. besides, no one on Ardetha streams removes any hard questions or bans people who voice their(different from them) opinion. questions are never actually answered by tru3. he likes to ignore donation questions too where people ask legit things just because those contradict to what he just said. he's like an old professor with massive ego who just ignores everything that is not his opinion. not trying to argue or think or, god forbid, agree when there's logic to it. 
---
Any item ideas? I‚Äôd love to hear them. 
---
Thought I could add text with a picture, whoops.  Short context: great sportsmanlike people, made a good game even better. Never had 3 survivors defend my honor against a 4th salty one before.
---
I just mlga block legion players and suicide. I disconnect if they're slugging. Fuck that killer and people who play him.
---
You played smart. Nothing wrong with that
---
True, it is needed to slow the game down
---
For some reason I get the aura of Charlie Brown looking at the little huntress
---
No that's on the survivors for leaving a cluster like that, then not adapting. 
---
Rank 15 survivors_irl
---
How does that work? You have to set your mouse movement to q and e?!
---
thank you for your feedback
---
Noed needs to be nerfed
---
Nah those survivors just dont know how to play the game, so they seek a snapegoat lol
---
People wanting others to be banned for looping is stupid but at the same time it's ridiculous to stay at the same pallet the aim of the game is to get away from the killer not run around in a circle
---
Nope. That is 100% non reportable, non bannable. They're just salty they got out played and lost, lol.
---
&gt; and the fact it takes her about half a gen's worth of progress to refill her power is pretty shit
---
it absolutely does not take that long lol
---
The added bonus of having two on one gen is pretty minuscule. It only really has actual value later in the game 
---
it also only takes 15 seconds to recover Yamaoka's Haunting 
---
Well unless they‚Äôre *looks around to see if any survivors are around* if they‚Äôre ahem bitch‚Äôs
---
Legion is the only killer I leveled up to 50 so far. so I kiiiiinda am.
---
Probably cause there are too many Survivor only players tbh
---
It is a toxic way to play honestly. Camping those gens is fine but refusing to ever chase anyone away is lame. But just like tunneling and camping, there‚Äôs no rule against it. 
---
No, he's pretty damn wrong. Tru3 is a very good player and just by clicking to the end of any of his videos you can see him 3-4k, or escape with a pip. He doesn't seem to play claudette either so your info is just wrong all around?
---
Survivors are just "skins", and I think the Survivor perks are all in an OK spot ATM.
---
I read it was 20. Guess it either changed, or it was the wrong information.
---
Either way, 15 seconds is still a lot of time to basically be a Huntress with no hatchets.

---
Nope! Just game experience and word of mouth, but you saw hole stupid fast this guy got blinded inn the video, not too unbelievable, eh?
---
Remember when people said Legion was the worst killer?
---
I wish they would add custom music to each killer instead of heart beats. Or maybe have an add-on that silences the heartbeat and instead just vibrates your controller.
---
The next event you can farm and stuff should be lunar New year in February I think. As for the actual bloodhunt those are rare and happen only a couple times a year
---
Mom! Mom! I‚Äôm on reddit, mom!
---
Don't worry, it's only most of the community that is like this.
---
Yes 
---
Gen rushing isn‚Äôt toxic. That‚Äôs what survivors are supposed to do. Get gens done. 
---
Nice
---
Legion at base sucks ass, which i think everyone can agree on. But the problem is, that this killer has the most broken and cancerous design gameplay wise with absolutely no counterplay or skill to it, and some of his add ons like franks mixtape makes him a braindead nurse.
---
...That sounds familiar in more ways than it should. 
---
Way to screw over your teammates. 
---
This is the shitpost equivalent of drawing a dick on the teacher's whiteboard before class, come on man.
---
Again, I'm on console, not PC, but I'd imagine you can bind turning to the keyboard without changing it on the mouse. Killer is first person, so camera control and turns are the same thing. And back when i still played PC most games allowed for multiple keys to do the same action. Might even be set up that way automatically.
---
Pro tip: trash it and they give you a new one.
---
I binged killer during the event, now stuck at purple/red ranks facing teabagging Claudettes with purple toolboxes every single match. Tried to take a break from toxicity by playing survivor but waiting 20 mins for a match I'm just taking a break entirely.
---
Moonwalking is useful to get them into one-hit range while also keeping your power charged for that last hit. Frank's Mixtape puts them in last hit range right from the start. There's no reason to wait out the chase break and also wait for the bleed out when you can frenzy again and get the last hit.
---
I don't like it. I love it!
---
Did anyone dc ?
---
That's when you equip the franklin's demise and laugh while they are forced to drop their flashlights.
---
She's strong as fuck when in chase and at loops though since you can fake power activation and force them into unsafe situations or have them double back on you just standing still. 
---
Deja Vu
---
She can be strong in chases, but scratch marks can bug out at times and end up throwing you way off of where someone actually is, and the sound bugging out can also end up being really confusing.
---
Also, you can mind game Spirit as well, and then it becomes more of a game of gambling than straight up skill in certain scenarios.
---
Good stream man, keep it up!
---
Nice to see a positive attitude! 
---
I would hold off on the Spirit, since audio is broken playing her at her best is near impossible.
---
I think the way it works is that you usually ping for a game and also in that message let people know you prefer players in the singaporean region but are willing to accept other players since there may not be many players from that region in the server
---
Sick, would be awesome to see some of her other killer friends like this!
---
Or less playing killer. 
---
i think the game is slowly dying on console. almost no one wants to play killer. i switched to PC form ps4 because i kept finding matches in like 20 mins and I'm not planning to spend more time in queue than actually playing the game. if i play on console then only with friends and we still find 1 game in 1 hour and then the killer insta leaves...
---
i have 300+ hours on ps4 really good perks for survivor and killer and was thinking really long about switching to pc and i have to say it was totally worth it.
---
Yea I wait 17min waiting for survivor's I finally got one and one of them leaves üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I know there‚Äôs footage of Matthew Cot(e with the weird ass mark) playing hag and getting destroyed. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure about anyone else
---
I usually just hide and let someone else get caught then start working on gens 
---
SWF with voice comms is bullshit too, and that requires 0 perk slots.
---
He still is but he has 0 counterplay and no skillceiling making him the most cancerous matchup in the game. We also have franks mixtape which makes him a braindead nurse.
---
Once played a Myers and I turn a corner and he deadass was standing there and we just kinds stared into each other's souls for what felt like eternity. Took off running and he got the Kate I was with c:

You did your job.

Serious answer: they did it to themselves.

Fake going into phase to see what they do then act accordingly and Stridor is a big help.

Basement corridors are designed intentionally to be too thin for survivors to get past a killer for this exact purpose. The concept called holding the game hostage is a bannable offense which involves preventing the game from moving forward by any measure the other players can take. Standing in the basement corridor could be an instance of this, but in This case, they had traps on their heads. The game was progressing, just in a way the players can‚Äôt prevent. It was a dick move, but no different than putting someone on a hook and facecamping them effectively. It was simply a good play by you to capitalize on the survivor‚Äôs mistakes by getting down there in that position.
---
enjoyment? dead by daylight? those two words should never be spoken together 
---
Thank you very much for your time wicked, be sure to draw and pitch the contortionist!
---
why would anyon complain about that
---
who the fuck doesn't have an adblocker
---
Hit them once with NOED tho
---
The best tip I can give you is to experiment with all the killers as one that sounds lame might be your next favourite. The next one is to check out some youtubers who specialize in the game for little things you‚Äôd never think of otherwise. I personally like Monto because it‚Äôs mostly entertainment with some learning sprinkled in. 
---
The doctor is free, or is on console anyway. 
---
Well it is, because he can get off the hook ezpz and run to a loop or get in a locker, whilst the rest of the team continues to do gens, not slowing them down in the slightest 
---
It really isn't, why as a killer would I put myself at a disadvantage to move away from the gens that the survivors need to come to? THEY are the ones who put themselves in that situation not the killer so why should the killer have to pay for the survivors own mistakes???? There is zero valid answer to that question other than feeling like an entitled brat. Not calling you one personally but that is the ideology behind your statement
---
As a killer main I don‚Äôt have a problem with people looping it‚Äôs a viable strategy we are all just trying to do are part in the game to win but hook blocking fuck that shit 
---
That meme would be more accurate in 2016.
---
Try making lobby again?
---
Usually I just leave asap since that the most effective means of survival 
---
Add Iron Will and try to juke - backtrack - break line of sight as much as possible.
---
Not only this is very time consuming for the killer, as everytime he looses you even for a few seconds you gain a lot of distance, but you are able to use much less pallets.
---
(don't do unsafe jukes tho, like faking windows or  crouching behind corners unless you have no other option)
---
Also sometimes in some loops with tall walls if the killer is hiding the red glow it's better to stand still and wait until you realize where he comes from instead of running blindly.
---
And just walking away is more effective then you'd think, even at red ranks.
---
Anyway the **best** perk to win a chase is hands down Iron Will... Exaustion perks may help you survive and prolong the chase but with Iron Will you can much more easily loose the killer.
---
They've said a little while ago that body blocking isn't a reportable offence. 
---
2 minutes for my other 3 fuckheads to realize there's a leatherface in the basement (people won't touch a gen until someone gets hurt or they find the killer, could take way longer) 4 minutes of them fucking around the shack, and then the rest of the game them getting facecamped and being angry at me for having to solo gens through ruin/finding the ruin etc. 
---
Legion is trash unless you use ebony + ultra or very rare addons.
---
This new Laurie cosmetic looks weird ngl 
---
this was hilarious, the dude asked him "How do you feel?" after getting teabagged and blinded 1000 times and matt said "not so good". 
---
None the less it still pisses me off lol
---
This sub is filled with weirdos with made up codes of honor. Ignore them.
---
If I play the game regularly... At least twice a day
---
What annoys me more is getting facecamped while my team mates stop and stare. The fact that I get camped is alright, whatever, but knowing that I'll die for nothing cause nobody is using the time to rush gens, triggers me
---
Tbh its ez and i usually complete it in 2 games
---
Lmao I obviously pissed off none dwight mains, mission accomplished.
---
That's why noone wants to play solo at red ranks. It's so frustrating... 
---
It‚Äôs because you play a lot of survivor. Devs have it set up to give you more rituals on whichever side you play the least to try to build empathy between killer and survivor mains. The idea is that a killer main will realize the challenges of a survivor and vice versa. It‚Äôs a pretty good idea imo but can be pretty annoying when you just want to play a specific character. 
---
Down voted for making me cringe.
---
A while ago, I downed someone right next to the hatch. I was about to get a 4k, then the controller I neglected to charge died the second I picked him up. By the time I got it back on, he just got off and got into the hatch.
---
I really do love it when survivors try to body block. I just simply drop the person I am carrying, and then kill everyone trying to body block.
---
Their attempt to stop my one hook turns into two hooks and one down, with nobody on generators since the last guy is trying to heal everyone.
---
The reason a lot of people derank is because queue times at red ranks are ridiculous. People just want to play the game. I don't see the negative impact on the individual deranking at all. And that's the fault of the game design having insane wait times at red ranks, not on the players.
---
What is this post. Seriously, I don't get it.
---
What rank are you? I'm still getting lobbies in 5-ish minutes in mid ranks.
---
I hope he's not planning on taking the train home...
---
Speed limiter, makes it a two hit down but adds bonus bloodpoints in deviousness category. 
---
If you have been waiting for one single match, it's because the lobby might be bugged. Exit out and try again. If you're having trouble finding lobbies and are continuously making lobbies, then I have no idea what to tell you other than the game is busted and BHVR does not care about their game or their players.
---
Been happening to me with legion a lot for some reason
---
I'm glad that Jake went from a one trick pony with his busted day one Saboteur, to a decent stealthyboi with Calm Spirit and Iron Will
---
Agree, that's teaming with a survivor and should be punishable.
---
It‚Äôs annoying but true

4 on survival and 5 on killer

Hate that guy with a passion top disliked killer he just drains the fun out of the round 
---
You say scratch marks and sound bugs aside, but that's literally the only thing the Spirit has to play with. Before the update, she was top 3. Now, she's not as good. But, the biggest nerf that came was the sound bugs for sure. So, that's probably why you're having so much trouble.
---
Was originally 20, got buffed down to 15 in one of the multitude of changes that took her from C tier to the 3rd best Killer in the game.
---
I personally love playing Legion, as someone who‚Äôs rusty from time away, they are fun to play and most of the time I forget to add the add-on‚Äôs. I‚Äôve had games where I‚Äôve slaughtered the team and times I haven‚Äôt or anywhere in between. I have had games where I‚Äôve outdone legion many times but I‚Äôve also taken some L‚Äôs from them as well.
---
Legion can be annoying to play against but I still enjoy playing as or against the Canada group of killers. They aren‚Äôt terribly bad but I wouldn‚Äôt call them broken, but that‚Äôs my opinion.
---
That's just one reason that people give for it, and if people from both sides didn't derank, then the queues wouldn't be as bad as they are, barring the (now seemingly) fixed matchmaking. 
---
At this point they may as well put every single person in ranks 1-10 into the same pool for matchmaking.
---
Indeed! I cannot loop high rank killers for any more than 3 loops, it's difficult. The only thing that keeps me up here is my immersion. :(
---
Probably doesn‚Äôt count for much but legion carried me to rank 11 without exploits
---
Tyyy
---
Awesome
---
Aww I love this woman that constantly murders me in my videogame :3 
---
They've totally banned multiple, popular streamers before, so I don't know if your last point is true.
---
But you're perfectly fine with looking for a match for 30 minutes only to afk/dc immediately to lose pips?
---
Your logic doesn't add up. You could actually play all of the matches you intentionally lost in but you chose not to you're using an excuse.
---
I get that a lot of people look down on deranking and I understand why, but personally I just don't enjoy playing this game in a super competitive way anymore. Red ranks is full of people on both sides who are using nothing but meta perks with top tier addons, offerings, and items. 
---
Its totally fine if that's the way you want to play the game, but me personally.. I just want to mess around and do things like seeing if I can make the killer check a locker by throwing a rock at it. 
---
I try to stay in the high green range so its not like i'm at rank 15 bullying newer players, I just don't want to be at that top end where you need meta perks to have any fun. 
---
It would be nice if we had some kind of casual mode that both sides can go to to use stupid perk builds just for the fun of it.
---
There's hundreds of 360 tutorials on youtube
---
i'm a nurse main and this happens very frequently that i just got used to it
---
Op means you start with one perk slot and get one more every five levels
---
My mouse is broken so I have to work for it
---
Blame queue time. I watch many streamers a lot and believe me watching lobby simulator is not very fun especially when streamer finally got into the lobby but he need to close the game with task manager due to infinite loading screen. I dont blame streamers for deranking to make stream more interesting and active i blame BHVR that they cant fix their shit since 4 MONTHS. Its ridiculus.
---
if the survivors are dumb enough to leave the last gens in a cluster, it's their fault. leaving the 3 gens to get looped is taking obvious bait, intentionally making a stupid decision to help your opposition. in any other game it would be considered idiotic to do such a thing, why is that different here?
---
t. survivor main
---
Dude...you derank before you get to red ranks. So, that way, you don't waste time like you said.
---
I think ebony moris are the dumbest things ever put into this game.
---
Read again what you wrote and think about it...
---
Your rank, the time of day, and your geographical location matter when searching for a match. If you're in the US and you do not find a survivor match within 5 minutes, make a new lobby. If 10 minutes as a killer, try again. 
---
I find games within seconds on both sides on the west coast in the evenings. 
---
It's fine, so long as you're not an asshole who finds a cluster and makes sure nobody touches them. The only probably I see on your end is Leather Face, not fun to play against, especially when the game decides to spawn all the survivors together next to the killer.
---
Is this for ALA?
---
I had one game as soon as I hooked the first person the other 3 immediately started humping me and tried to save the one I hooked. This gave me 2 free hooks giving me a free 4k. If they had just waited like 3 seconds for me too leave...
---
Yesss
---
Especially those running Urban Evasion. :‚Äô)
---
Yea the sound bugs make her unplayable. Did they say when it's going to be fixed?
---
Nice! You‚Äôll see DBD cosplayers there, I saw a Huntress last year.  Have fun!
---
Susie??
---
Just don't save those kinda people, simple
---
Title says "entire game with UE" UE is urban evasion..
---
If you are joking, make sure to say /s so people understand you are being sarcastic.
---
I think a lot of your issues stem from a place of inexperience or misapprehension. People derank for the reason I discussed, and it's because of a flaw in the game design. That's it.
---
My entire team was doing it..
---
Whoops. When you reddit half asleep feelsbad. I swear I do this way too often. üò≠

---
Found an ue user xD
---
Can someone explain this? I thought he was underpowered af, I have played many legions recently and have not had that much trouble 
---
The amount of times I've successfully lost the killer, online to crawl right into them...
---
Yo I find Blood Lodge the real pallet town. 
---
That's not just for you, that's been in the game for years. 
---
Why put that, they‚Äôre not funny
---
I didn't say die, I just said gets stuck
---
‚ÄúFor some reason‚Äù
---
You hit the nail on the head,and I wish I can upvote this more than once
---
We all start somewhere.You‚Äôll get there .Survivors are the real killers ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Getting found first can be a good thing, you know the map is full of pallets by then and if you know how to use them correctly, you could waste alot of the killers time.  
---
I'm not a killer main, but I'm not a survivor main either. I have a main on both sides of the coin so I figured I'd toss my two cents if it's worth anything:
---
Survivor: When I play survivor, I'm usually in a SWF with at least one other person. We always treat the people we play with as if they're in our SWF group, and try our damnedest to play altruistically for them without fucking them over. That said, even though we play with this in mind, sometimes we get survivors who would rather die on a hook than help us with anything--- oddly.
---
Killer: When someone farms someone off of a hook in front of me, I usually go after the person doing the unhooking. I've also noticed if someone is unhooked with me right in front of them- as in they followed me to the hook- I'll see them run before the unhooked person so I go after them automatically. 
---
SideNote: Dunno if many other killers do this but if you're farmed in front of a killer (I main Huntress and Spirit on killer side) and you crouch immediately under the hook, I'll be able to see the sandbagger easier. I've done this as a survivor and it's worked a few times.
---
If you leave you lose all your points. Be aware. Don't let people bully you by taking the game hostage in that way. :C
---
okay, I've got a few questions, you give us no proof with the post first of all. second of all, how can you be dev 12, you need to get a life clearly if you get that high, and also, wow did he find the time to be a criminal and also be D12?... 
---
I like the word anti-claudette I want the killer t-shirt skin, where are the killers have like a crossed Claudette on t-shirts and every time you buy these u have less odds to play against toxic tryhard survivors
---
The daily is to hit four survivors with the chainsaw, if you face camp then you might only get 1 a game.
---
Priorities, mate.
---
Rin's jiggly bits &gt; Fredster's sleepyboi power
---
Ah gotcha! Thought he was referring to the overall pero unlocks. My bad 
---
Trust me, people want to save
---
do you see the question mark afterwards indicating that i‚Äôm unsure of whether or not it‚Äôs an unpopular opinion? i don‚Äôt read a bunch of dbd threads so idk how people feel about this &amp; given that this thread is mainly killer mains, i suspected anything that benefits survivors would be shut down. 
---
thanks for the saltiness though. hope your reply really enlightened the rest of your day &amp; made you a happier more positive person overall. 
---
Killer main here. I am a god at intentionally playing like I‚Äôm really bad for the whole game, then actually try when there is 1 gen left, then proceed to punish the extreme altruism 
---
Other than making the brown flashlight a yellow (because there are no brown flashlights) I think that this is a great idea. Very balanced and fun killer power idea
---
O O F
---
Why not ? 
---
Same thing happens to me. I'm also getting error code 8014 (cannot connect to online services) is anyone else getting this?
---
I'm chill with Tombstone though. he takes time to level EW and also if you mess up the click, you just down them. 
---
That is pretty much what you said.And you said you still wanted your teammates to die in your previous comment, so don't go back on what you said now
---
And hook camping or tunneling are the easiest ways to snag sacrifices as a killer. Just don't be toxic. No one likes it
---
Unpopular opinion, but I really think the only bad design of Legion is the bleedout of the Deep Wound. A killer that can end a chase by not chasing you or just looking away from you but still staying close by is just silly. However I have only encountered one Legion that actually played like that, and we all still escaped anyway.
---
Second, I just don't agree with the idea that you can't counterplay Legion. Legion has limited field of view while using Frenzy, so breaking line of sight is easy. It's just like the Nurse, you can counterplay her, it's just really different from the other killers.
---
I just don't agree with this community's stance on Legion. I think he's fun to play as and fun to play against. It's a different type of threat that you have to adjust your playstyle toward. You can't expect to use the same tricks on Legion that you use on the other killers.
---
Got a two man game earlier it was pretty thicc when the only other guy dced
---
Since my computer is real shit and my framerate is ass, I have a lot of trouble with skillchecks. I usually just claim that missing them is an "intentional diversion" when playing with friends though.
---
Yep. Currently dealing with invisible killers, no directional sound, and the inability to interact with anything in 70% of my games.
---
Because they‚Äôre not funny
---
Dude, not even joking. I have the same exact doctor setup with those SAME level perks. Tier 1 BBQ, Distressing, and Ruin, Tier 2 Sloppy Butcher
---
Ironic
---
Haven‚Äôt got that one, but half the time right as I join a game (not bloody cosmetic or anything so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being dodged) it says host disconnected
---
That sounds about right, I found some random new player and was teaching him tricks and perk combinations, but we had to wait like 20minutes to find a match, really sucked
---
yeah but shape has way faster base move speed and his ability is awesome, hillbilly has a chainsaw but hes got insane mobility and map presence, ive found leatherface/cannibal really doesn't have any mobility at all
---
Sorry dude the aim was not to spend blood points as i know hes not may play style (as hes super immobile)
---
woot? I tought people said he was bad? And the counterplay is to palletstun? Just wait till he goes for him to click M2 then wait a sec and he will run at you amd you stun them. I feel like this killer works best for tunneling to at least get 1 kill but it takes ages to down someone with them compared to Nurse or billy. 
---
I was using it to try to get the "kill four people in one match" trophy. It's one of the few I don't have.
---
Flashlights, keys, insta heals and decisive strike aren't enough, huh?
---
Force feed it to them later.
---
And why ? One is a fat deformed rabbit and the other a bad animated guy who says : Thats how mafia works
---
Dunno whats funny about this
---
I'm saying tbagging to "distract the killer" is a shit strategy because the killer can also just tunnel and camp. I'd also say visa versa, if you're tunneling and camping expect to get tbagged. 
---
honestly don't worry about it
---
nobody wants to be rank 1
---
dbd is a fun party game, not a competitive game where a high rank means anything, it just means you get put against iridescent head ebony huntress more often
---
That‚Äôs how mafia works
---
The best buff to NOED: delete DS from the game... with NOED.
---
Behold the missing apostrophe, now im screwed 
---
they genlocked themselves rip
---
They should just re-do the entire system again and replace 1-20 with a skill rating similar to shooters like overwatch. Then give rewards for climbing/progressing in a system where you'll likely never reach the last reward unless you're unbeatable.
---
You‚Äôr screwed mate
---
This hurts my soul
---
Basically every perk in C and D tier on [this list](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/survivor/) could use some love. They are all either too situational or provide such little benefit that other perks simply overshadow them.
---
That's how mafia works
---
*You're too mate 
---
Same here (PS4) a day before the event ended the matchmaking went to shit again :(
---
No you‚Äôr is the joke. Mafia city made an ad where they actually used you‚Äôr
---
I am going to call a bounty on your Wraith just because of your words against Saboteur.
---
And now we go from one offensive comment to another.Sigh.not going to argue with a child who needs to see Dr.Phil
---
Last day i tried to play a match with my friend... 40 minutes wait and nothing...(rank 14)
---
Its definitly not the joke 
---
Wait isnt this the 50 no escape* guy? God damn lol
---
*exit gate escapes 
---
I don't think ELO system will be good for DbD. Because of SWF. Both in terms of advantage it gives and the cases when newer players are in a team with veterans.
---
In my opinion (very unpopular, as far as I can tell), there should be 2 pools of players - ones with less than 50 hours on particular role, and others with 50+ hours. Make it impossible for players from one pool to be in a game with players from other pool. No ranks, ratings, ELOs. Just pure "first in a queue, first in a game" matchmaking with ping limits.
---
Do you hear that?
---
That's a woosh, bud
---
Killer op nerf sharp hand Joe you can't escape from him
---
What am i supposed to hear ?
---
I agree Ebony (and Cyprus) Moris should be removed, as they break the flow of the game and offer Survivors no counter-play.
---
That said, their removal would have to be accompanied by the removal of Keys, as they have much the same effect as Moris; ending the game prematurely and unfairly.
---
The sound of the joke going over your head
---
Glad to hear its not just me having these issues. On Saturday we really just got off of dead and played something else since we couldn't find a game after 30 minutes. Sucks because I really like this game.
---
What joke ?
---
*Spits soda back* Small game
---
Nice shitpost.

Those are very hard to indentify you know ?

You‚Äôr

i love how whenever i see a pallet now i immediately think of dead by daylight
---
It think they already did a PTB-Internal update back on Dec 20th. These are really the signs for the PTB hitting soon.
---
And now what ? Haha you got me with you'r and now ?

Oh
---
You admit I‚Äôm right 
---
I agree mori need a rework, but don't agree on BNP. The old brand new part was busted, I think reworking it and reworking Tinkerer were good decisions. 
---
I don't think there should be any items that just let you skip portions of the game, myself.
---
Shadow nerf to SWF?
---
Hey look, it's a delusional survivor main. 
---
I guess its 3 hours
---
Busted? Nut.
---
Can confirm, outside of broken mechanics/killers, the game itself is just a complete buggy mess ever since the legion came out.
---
Avoid red ranks, depip if needed. Trust me, not worth it.
---
Ahh yes make a suggestion without actually offering how to perform said suggestion
---
I do it constantly, and still try to do my part with altruism. There are dozens of us!
---
Someone please tell me what Noed is. I'm new.
---
I got every perk with legion on winter event. I only player the legion during the event aswell.
---
Without Franks mix tape, you cannot be competitive. 
---
People saying there is no counterplay, havent learned yet.
---
You can pallet vault when he does it, you run away when you hear his heartbeat, or someone is getting frenzied, you dont heal and genrush with Some OP survivor perks,...
---
There is plenty to counter, smart survivors figuren this out already.
---
Genrush games are common at this stage, he fits perfectly in the game with the right addons
---
I had a match against a streamer today (playing legion) where no one could mend, talk about no counter-play, once he hit you that was it..
---
Me and my friends have been waiting 30 minutes so far, it's absolutely ridiculous.
---
This is a gold one :')
---
You have to be right up on them, like literally on their back and then start revving up the chainsaw
---
Aside from Iron Will there really isn't any decent counters to her because the sound alone is useful enough when tracking.
---
Unless the sound has changed since the engine update, I haven't played the Spirit in a while.
---
Massive big dick energy is shitting yourself when you trigger a hag trap with the addon that makes it so the traps have terror radius and her real one goes to 0 for like 5 seconds
---
I like the idea of the perk, maybe change the name because i thought this post was about changing Bloodhound
---
I think that one is Azarov's resting place.
---
That always comes up when I use slow killers, so I have to do a 3 gen strat and then survivors cry I'm camping. There's no point in not though because messing about going from one side of the map to the other without Hillbilly or Nurse will cost you the game.
---
And yeah a number of survivors get inflated egos but really its just lucky spawn of pallets. Many are so safe you have no choice but to drstroy them.
---
I decide to work on a gen instead of saving. BAM BAM BAM 3 gens done but now the hooked guy is on second stage. Decide to rescue end up getting hooked then get rescued someone else is hooked  5 gens left. The struggles of soloing, I wish I could at least see auras of survivors within 40M range of the hook to know when and when not to save. 
---
If they dont like being looped they can go play nurse 
---
&gt;Survivor perks are all in an OK spot ATM.
---
Wake up!
---
This is not happening
---
Prove thyself
---
Left behind
---
Vigil got hit hard with exhaustion nerf, not that useful anymore
---
There's probably more but those are the few that just pop into my head. All of those (except vigil) are either so miniscule or so situational (left behind) they rarely get use
---
eBonY mOrI
---
"Best console killer ps4" was his stream title for awhile and I don't think he was being ironic lol
---
It's a hex totem called no one escapes death, it's a perk.
---
Lol you don't need to mindgame Freddy or Pig, you just stay on the other side of the pallet and there's nothing you can do.
---
Doc can shock them once a pallet is down which stops them jumping back over it. Requires timing but it helps.
---
Pig can do her charge on short loops and run around to hit them.
---
Watch truetalent play both, you'll pick it up. Otherwise just go for stronger killers.
---
Also don't feel bad. I remember when I had 100 hours I was going up against people with 1500 hours. Some people have a lot of experience with the game.
---
Killer lobbies are fine for me but survivor takes about 10-20 mins on average. I can't speak for anybody else but I usually play both, 70 killer/30 survivor but since the last update playing killer on PS4 is horrible. The frames drop every time you swing or lunge to the point where it's super easy to lose survivors even if you hit them, as well as problems with bloodlust frames etc etc. So I started to play survivor more to actually get a relatively smooth game, just wondering if other people have done the same, resulting in less killer lobbies available?
---
I got you
---
The charge addons are one of the few addons that dont seem broken. From what i know, the chili's either dont add enough value or are completely bugged
---
DiScOneCT
---
Do people actually watch these guys? I'm a survivor main, and even their level of toxicity/complaining about a killer's play is fucking ridiculous like holy shit.
---
Why are cowards playing a horror game?
---
Agreed 
---
That's why it's so fun to play him
---
https://youtu.be/YeSnIzH7OEQ
---
What is pallet camping?
---
Except it is? Sloppy is clearly bugged on Wraith, which makes the game run at like 2fps for survivors.
---
 At that point is basically abusing.
---
And OP, its hard suggest perks if you dont tell us what else you have. 
---
Looks like something outta LEGO Star Wars 
---
They're saving Spring Burst or don't want to leave scratch marks yet
---
The devs are infamous for being bad at the game, or at least its the ones that are often speaking on behalf of the development team that are bad. I remember there was a stream of them playing together and they were god awful at playing.
---
step 5: be called an asshole in post-game chat because you are an asshole
---
It's a shit strategy but some survivors are idiots and get really overly altruistic. If you can get under their skin you win. And sometimes that's just one way of doing it.
---
Shit ones. I'll tell ya that. Not one the game anymore but just know the only other options I consider worthy is NOED lvl 2 and bitter murmur 3. 0 teachables since I just moved to PC from xbox 
---
And the cycle never ends. Only sometimes one thing just starts before the other.
---
gg
---
Shouldn't have insulted chungus like that, if I see you in the fog you gon get facecamped
---
Only reason theres an influx if ebonys is because of the event. 
---
I might try that out. I'm playing wraith at the moment mostly because I want his bloodhound teachable on before I start leveling anyone else. 
---
I think you misunderstood my point. I'm only "toxic" if the other side is. Hence teabagging when the killer is already tunnelling/camping, leading them to swap their focus on me because they're angry.
---
But tunnelling/camping and whatever the fuck isn't inherently toxic. It's just that people are sensitive. Camping results in a kill. Tunnelling results in efficiency (lol). Teabagging only works when the killer is so sore about it.
---
I'm horrible at juking, stealth is usually my got to when I am in trouble. But depending on the map, I could be pretty creative.
---
Thought I was the only one crashing every day lately. It's not even a crash. It just freezes. Its often when a mori is used too so it makes me look bad.  
---
LOL LIKE ALL OF YOU WERE SAYING HES TRASH PRE RELEASE WHAT??? XDDDDD
---
Seriously, the game becomes not fun at all at the lower ranks. 
---
Story of my life,
---
"broken" doesn't mean overpowered. It means impossible to balance without an actual rework.
---
Legion is in a state of either unusable trash or completely broken, but he's never fun to face. 
---
Normal Legion: useless
---
Frank's Mixtape: OP
---
Upcoming buffed Legion: OP
---
All Legions: Unfun as shit.
---
SWF breaks the matching making, never would it put a rank one in a lobby like this. 
---
People were also saying they're unfun to face.
---
SWF matchmaking is broken at the moment. 
---
Both of those are Meme-Tier.
---
its fucking amazing how they can turn a blind eye to it. 
---
Personally I think mori‚Äôs should only work on death hook,
---
Ebony was never a problem before the event to be quite honest. 
---
any player to level their killers during event, myself included, got a fat portion of those. sometimes I'd get 3 in one bloodweb with the boxes. which was actually sad cause I don't use them and was only looking forward to better add-ons which I didn't get so much D: unlike pink moris. 
---
as much as I think Ebony should not exist at all, the event was the problem. previously you'd never get so many killers using those. I don't understand why they even put them in the boxes. or at least why they gave them such a huge drop rate(in my experience higher than purple add-ons).
---
and, yes, I do agree the amount of killers using pink moris is very annoying. guess we can only wait when they're out of them. 
---
(like for the comparison, I play a lot(almost devotion 7). especially before the last chapter. and maybe in 2-3% of my survivor games I'd get killers using pink moris. now it's around 30% of survivor games which is insane, boring, frustrating and imbalanced)
---
Same, I block almost all Legions and if it's Frank's Mixtape I DC.
---
No I never want this cheesy killer in this game. 
---
I main spirit. I think she's more OP than fair tbh. As survivor I do love playing against her. I'd need to play against her more to know for sure. . . But she's certainly easy to 4k with.  
---
Winning = fun btw
---
Saving SB
---
Same here. 
---
jUsT bReAk ThE cHaSe AnD hIdE
---
i usually disconnect and then msg the killer that he should die. Then rinse and repeat &gt;_&gt;
---
In the eyes of angry survivors you're always in the wrong
---
Ah, the old "Off the Grid" build
---
but BNP was shit. only hardcore survivor mains could enjoy those. it's a way worse imbalance than Mori. because to use Mori you still need to down someone twice and hook them. while BNP is just few easy skill checks to finish a gen within few seconds. I still remember the times when i, baby killer back in the days, would get 4 gens done within first two minutes because of swf where everyone used BNP. that's just... you know... 
---
That‚Äôs the survivors fault for not spreading the gens. 
---
Tbh survivors are just skins once you get them all maxed. Kinda silly. Wish they had some kind of unique power like killers. 
---
You don't want another m1 killer with a slightly different knife?!? Don't let the community hear you say that.
---
This dude is also abusing a bug, there is no way to justify even having 4 gens done.
---
Seeing an anomaly format on this subreddit is a surprise for sure but quite the welcome one.
---
There are tons of other games that use ELO instead of forced ranking and they are free. And can easily have unbalanced teams. 
---
Well, I can't blame you survivors. You need something to run from us, it's a strategy. I am however a sucker for a good chase and don't mind letting the others do 5 gens, if it's a fun chase. When it's " all the time running in circles, pallet down, on to next circle, repeat" it's straight up boring, making me want to mori you lol
---
My hatred for legion knows no bounds 
---
And the shards? Cosmetics for killer?
---
True killer main.
---
I deranked to have more randomness in my games, then Legion came out and I wanted to prestige em so now back at 7 :/
---
Come on, everyone knows cosmetics and visual appearances are more important to BHVR than an actual mechanic in their game! 
---
Works so much better on us poor console peasants. 
---
Have you considered gitting gud bb killer? /s
---
rofl yeah. The only thing I'm impressed by is rank 1 survivor, I just can't reach it
---
So much worse on consoles.
---
Erm, highlights over the last year and half. Not initially realizing there was a lunge by holding the attack button. Having no idea how to use secondary action on insta med kits and wasting them. 
---
Thinking I was a God by saving team mates even when I was being chased. Was a bit old Macdonald back in the early days.
---
Forgetting every single time I bring a mori into a game probably wasted about 90% of my lifelong mori offerings.
---
Forgetting to look after hooking someone when I'm running BBQ.
---
The list is endless really. I'll have a few derp moments every time I play. These days my main derp comes in the form of running right into the killer when trying to loop and constantly looking behind me rather than in front. 
---
I don‚Äôt know literally any of the people I was in the game with lol that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so stunned by the difference in ranks
---
Why on earth did you buy him if you weren't going to play him or level him?? Now you're stuck with getting dailies you don't want to do. 
---
No this is just her super saiyan state
---
It gets worse. I'm beginning to wear down playing anything but kyf because it is just a salt bath and so many random survivors just looking out for themselves instead of working together. If I have to watch one more teammate run around checking chests the whole game I might mori my damn self
---
Seriously felt bad for the dude, he didn‚Äôt stand a chance. No idea how 3 purple ranks got matched with a rank 20
---
Though I agree it‚Äôs kinda satisfying to finally give the survivors some broken bullshit after all this time they can feel what it‚Äôs like.  
---
Urban evasion can‚Äôt lose against the doctor if you just dc 
---
glug glug
---
I haven't really found this to be the case in my experience, people really love altruism, to the point where nothing gets done because the majority go for saves and the game just becomes a cycle of hooking-unhooking-healing-hooking etc. Because of this unless I'm close I always focus gens when someone gets hooked, because it gives the team a much better chance of surviving on average.
---
Some killers who can gen patrol quickly, like billy and nurse, can catch you early game if you beeline to a generator. Personally, i walk to near a gen if i hear the chainsaw or blink and hide nearby so they dont see that the gen has been worked on, then they leave. I walk so i dont leave scratch marks to follow.
---
I dont think either of them are OP that being said, I think that perks that reward poor play are terrible game design
---
He streams the game from time to time
---
I just hate how long the matches either playing as or against him take.
---
Ok I'm going to invalidate your argument because you are comparing an ebony mori to one brand new part so of course the comparison is going to be wildly in your favour.
---
If you're comparing it you need to compare it with four survivors using brand new parts to the killer using an ebony the game is a 4 v 1 so equipment that killer uses has to equal something that 4 survivors can use.
---
Well I do think the ebony mori can be really overpowered. I don't agree with comparing it with something that's clearly not a worthwhile comparison just to make your point seem more valid
---
NotQueen does aswell iirc and while she isn't great, she is far from bad as well.
---
I think it‚Äôs an interesting discussion and one worth having. I just wish people could talk about it without getting defensive and personal. Whatever your opinion, the people who disagree with you probably aren‚Äôt pathetic no life virgin idiots, they‚Äôre just people who disagree with you. 
---
I personally think that deranking is bad for the game, but I don‚Äôt think that the people who do it are bad people or something, I think they probably just have different experiences than I do and therefore have different opinions. Ultimately it‚Äôs just a game and it‚Äôs not worth insulting each other over. 
---
Yeah, understandable you dont want to spend any blood points on him, but with BBQ and Chilli, you will easilly get those blood points back, plus, its one of the best teachables in the game for killers. I would highly advise just leveling him whenever you have a daily for him. Completely your call though.
---
Reminds me of the "just dodge her spears" argument for Nidalee in LoL. Yeah I can just try to break the chase against Legion, doesn't make it any more fun to play against them.
---
Plz Cease is my spirit animal
---
You do know what survivor disconnecting already screws over the killer's points.
---
The bonus you get from somebody disconnecting is not even is less than the amount of points you get for one hook
---
I think this sub cares far too much about what other people are doing.
---
Strange unless it literally couldn‚Äôt find anyone else for this killer to face.  
---
Blame the game, not the player.
---
Seriously, even though they are crutch perks, you can't just expect people to not do it because they are bullshit. It's a legitimate strategy to run them and it is the game's fault for providing such powerful strategies with (most of the time) no counterplay. Just because some (I say some because it looks like most of the people who play this game are casuals rank 10-20 which don't play hundreds or thousands of hours and don't get tired of it, which isn't something bad really) find them bullshit, there's no reason not to use them, specially since you never know what you will be against.
---

It‚Äôs inconsistent but I feel it more in a technical sense than I do in a gameplay sense. I‚Äôve had matches where I‚Äôve had ‚Äúghost‚Äù hits as killer. These are hits that should connect based on the games‚Äô conditions of what‚Äôs considered a successful hit but for some reason isn‚Äôt due to janky hit boxes and/or auto-aim. This effect is more so prevalent on huntress due to how her hatchets work, but it‚Äôs also prevalent on other killers like hillbilly where they‚Äôll sometimes get ghost chainsaws where you‚Äôll play the animation of successfully downing someone via chainsaw but not actually downing them. Even on the survivor side there are so many technical issues with exhaustion perks not working properly, such as dead hard not activating even when pressing the associated key and putting you into exhausted, lithe not activating due to how lenient chase mechanics are, being hit seemingly through walls, etc. it‚Äôs honestly infuriating. 
---
The comms part of the swf isn't fair I should have clarified that what I meant by fair is playing in a party together because it's a part of the games begin. Obviously being on comms isn't meant to be a part of the game and puts the survivors at a significant advantage.
---
I never run noed and i see atleast 1 ds EACH game. Rank 1
---
I did this both solo and swf. Mostly solo though. I'm the first few ranks I played boldly since it was easier to get away from killers and get easy iridescent evader. As for higher up, I was being stealthier and stealthier. Playstyle, at first, as I said above, I was just taking the killer around and letting others get gens. But higher up I became a gen jockey. 
---
Cause this subreddit even accepts to most stale, least funny memes as long as you make them remotely relateable. Or to put it simple: Lowest common denominator.
---
I'm devotion 44 with almost 70 hours. I think I've only spent shards on that, lemme go check

If you're playing rank 20-15 or with boosted players then sure, they'll get close enough

Killer: downs survivor after tunneling all game. Adrenaline
---
I will just comment twice on this cause this didn't get enough appreciation. Very cool drawing &lt;3
---
I wouldn't really say this fits. Since it actually is applied to stuff that is "slightly infuriating". Not getting this achievment you have to work your ass off to get and waste a bunch of rare addons on is a huge pain in the ass.
---
It's his power. Evil within. He can look at the survivors and stack evil within tier up till tier 3. At tier 1 he has no red light in front of him and his terror radius greatly reduces to the point where it is almost non-existent.  But he is really slow in tier one. At tier two he is just like any killer except that his terror radius is rather small. At tier three he becomes faster and can down survivors in one hit.
---
I had this on pc
---
Original format please? Haha
---
I find it really dumb that killers can block the jump in command.
---
Can someone send me the image without words on it? I wanted to use it for a meme.
---
Background : we loaded in with only 3 people and 4 gens. Got decimated easily. I was left with 3 gens and no hatch. Powered up a gen then this happened.¬†
---
Fine work!
---
That‚Äôs how all memes are, really. You don‚Äôt exactly know who was the original poster of it.
---
Trapper!
---
Just about all of these ideas are bad but the removing lockers one is completely terrible, especially if it gets stacked. It's a necessity for the huntress's reloading mechanic, you are directly negatively effecting a killer's power with an offering. Terrible terrible idea.
---
You must be tough. Please keep your large cock away from me
---
Was there seriously a episode of Spongebob where a guy was about to skewer himself?
---
Just a typical surv main.
---
If you look at the game files someone uploaded to Github, you‚Äòll find that Artifact rarity is used for exclusive cosmetics given to very specific persons such as streamers, tournament winners, and the BHVR team (that Nea ‚ÄûCrew‚Äú shirt should have it).
---
No :(
---
He could just leave thru gate ...
---
Totems aren‚Äôt the height of a generator though... They‚Äôre not easy to find,even worse if you‚Äôre solo queuing
---
I was the laurie lol I had no idea wtf was going on when I got killed right away then I looked at your add ons lol gg
---
Think I'll go unhook that survivor...
---
 *Invisible skill check*
---
Good to know this is a common bug. 
---
Oh sorry, next time I will wait so you can put me on the hook right away.
---
I made rank 8 with level 1 Trapper as a new player, so I'm thinking an experienced player with Nurse could potentially make it. Probably need to SWF dodge, but as you said securing a single pip (or at least preventing depip) should be doable with a powerful killer.
---
This was on PS4, but no I don‚Äôt think so. 
---
Hope they do. I've always loved idle animations. I'm a slut for that stuff.
---
You‚Äôll probably DS me even though I won the chase anyway 
---
It is very uncommon. 
---
I messed up my first mori kind of the same way. The last survivor hid in a locker in the basement and I grabbed him and couldn't figure out how to drop to mori. Mashed buttons and accidentally ended up hooking them. Got so mad. 
---
Pretty good job so far :)
---
*taps forehead*
---
Oh thanks
---
Most added content maps have a achievement like that. Finish the generator in Myers‚Äô house, finish the generator in the chapel, one in the resort, etc.
---
The chili adding gives you a lil burst (and I mean little) at the very start, whereas the beast marks make you faster throughout the saw. 
---
I would saw his best add ons are carburettor tuning guide, beast marks and the grease.
---
Yeah, I will. Just like you use NOED. 
---
The gate was closed and doing a gen often kills you in that situation (if the gen is far away from the hatch). None of them are at fault
---
Can't she get burned like the Wraith while uaing her power?
---
The perk that gets nullified easily ? No thanks, while I have to exploit and juggle you 
---
Do you have any friends?
---
they loaded in with only 3 survs 
---
Why tf is everyone getting downvoted in this thread
---
Don't worry, I do tend to keep my cock away from children.
---
Can I just ask, have you ever played survivor before?
---
I mean I'm pretty downvote happy myself but these are just getting downvoted for no reason
---
Oh man I can imagine haha. It was my first time trying tombstone piece and I honestly thought I would mess it up and not get any kills. I was chasing Jeff for a couple minutes and then you just happened to pop in at the wrong place and the wrong time. It was just too perfect, esp with dying light. Gg! 
---
Right here

Hes literally the same move speed as billy? Idk why you think hes so slow

---
Huh? Leatherface and Myers both have 115 movement speed.
---
It kills you.
---
Impressive. Nicely done!
---
But... You can do that. You just have to time your press correctly. If you can't time it correvtly, then revert to spamming. 
---
The whole thing was a funny coincidence. Laurie as the obsession against Myers on Haddonfield. You used the strode key offering right? 
---
I can do it with no problems.
---
I did lol I love that map and love playing against myers so I had fun for the few minutes I was alive
---
Wasn't aware of that. Good call on uBlock Origin, thanks.
---
I don't D/C because that screws my teammates but it really is no fun playing against them.
---
SWF games definitely take way longer like 20+mins for me. I've noticed when my friend is hosting (green ranks) we get into games faster. 
---
Yeah... I got survivor rank 4 once with a like 75% survival rate on the way, and playing that much in one month got me so sick of the game, I coudln't touch it for months. I actually prefer rank 12-15 where people aren't completely dumb but not nearly as sweaty and obnoxious.
---
I feel you, I started playing off-meta perks and doing my own mini-challenges to keep myself entertained. Most of the games it's basically one person who gets tunneled, so they're having a bad time and the rest are having a boring time too. And it's not like a "hurrdurr killer players be like" post, I understand why killers want to reduce the number of survivors, but it certainly makes me to just want to disconnect from those matches instead of trying to do 5 gens as fast as possible. 
---
I guess. Its either that or OP's a spineless liar who's doing some photoshopping.
---
That‚Äôs similar for me, I usually get to around rank 8 (thanks to the limited time I have to play) and my friend doesn‚Äôt like to play because of the lag and frame drops so he‚Äôs around ranks 16 right now and when he‚Äôs hosting we get games almost instantly
---
Looool that's true. It is very sad. It's like your heart drops when you see Noed icon appear.
---
Jeesus Christ bud.
---
I mean I too dislike the perk but you don‚Äôt gotta bash people for using it
---
This is why I main Doctor. No one on console can hit a Madness 3 Unnerving Presense DS. I just pick up my obsession and wait and watch them start wiggling. 
---
Also if you want to piss off DS players really bad, run Rancor and ignore them all game. Wait till endgame and just deny them all interaction till you just insta them. 
---
Also if you‚Äôre still complaining about NOED let me remind you we have two perks and two items that can solve this issue even if you run solo. If the killer is so bad you can do gens with no contest, maybe take a few seconds to scout for a totem. 
---
How?
---
I've seen Hag with this build and Terror Radius moves to triggered traps, but Had doesn't jumpscare you. At first I couldn't understand wtf was with Terror Radius
---
Same i feel bad when someone dcs ao i either farm or just afk and let them go
---
Instead of: 360
---
Say: Rotating
---
&gt; You could have the game last for hours if all you do is walk back and forth between three gens.
---
How is that the killer's fault though? The survivors created the generator configuration the killer is working with. Are they just supposed to hand the survivors a free victory at any 3 gen setup because they forced the killer into a position where he's "dishonorable" if he makes the smart/winning play? That seems like an arbitrary line to draw to say the survivors are playing the game at that point but the killer somehow isn't.
---
Gotta love that Nea that crouches through the whole map and just runs when theres 1 m to the gen, activating every single Hag trap
---
Y2 days ago I bodyblocked in the exit gate for an injured survivor
---
I was injured too
---
They left without me
---
But I played it cool
---
You are correct, I mean any person that complains about the killer playing the game properly is most likely toxic
---
Strategic outsourcing of hits killed me XD
---
You can't be asking people to change their playstyle man. That's like blasphemy here, you may as well kick a baby over a fence.
---
drop them into a wall, bodyblock them, set them over basement stairs, set them over a trap, get them as far away from any loops you see as possible, juggle, run a soft counter perk etc.
---
Don't lie to yourself in saying there's nothing you can do.
---
First off, you did nothing wrong OP. You saw opportunity and seized it. Not getting baited by a fruitless chase was very smart. As for the survivors, know and understand that people who play this game can and will be upset over anything. Don‚Äôt take them that seriously. Players with good map awareness will know how to naturally avoid 3 genning themselves and if you ever are curious how to notice that pattern, there‚Äôs a perk that hardcounters it, Deja Vu. 
---
There is such a thing as soft counters.
---
This exact thing happened to me yesterday. I feel your pain.
---
Well maybe you could ask them nicely why they do that And convince them that they are playing not efficiently. We don‚Äôt need more salt in this community than we already have.
---
Or you were playing with throwers.
---
Blinding at pallets is a total waste of battery and time. Any good killer will just follow you through the blind and you'll have less time to gain distance.
---
Wat? Yea I didn't wanna pay for everyone again, but I still made it to rank 1 without spending any points. I think I'm tok dumb to understand what you mean man
---
Your comment is a goldmine of cringe, thank you.

&gt;Newsflash fuckface most "professional streamers provide their "content" for 8-12 hour 6-7 days of the week every week. 
---
I like how you put content in quotes because it really is dubious on what sort of "content" they provide. You're acting like they're working hard for 8-12 hours sitting on their asses playing video games.  There is no "fruits" of their labor. 
---
There is a reason why youtube "content creators" that made their living on youtube are sweating bullets and hyperventilating anytime youtube makes any changes to monetization on their platform. You're beholden to one employer. Soon twitch will have to do the same thing and every nerd and thought who never developed any **actual skills** are going to be wondering "oh no, what will I do now??" Because nobody is going to hire them if there is a huge gap in their career history and all they ever did was "uhh... play video games and talk on a microphone. Hahaha I'm so charismatic and create so much content."
---
Yeah. That's not going to fly.
---
These people are not content creators, they are content commentators. 
---
Sitting around playing video games and streaming it for eight hours is not a worthy profession if anyone can do it. It's so bizaar how you defend women who put no effort into their content commentary and depend solely on their looks. Especially women who do [shit like this on a platform where there are minors on.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsg44tFATOY)
---
I know you'll defend them because you're a lonely loser.
---
&gt;Maybe once you actually grow the fuck up and get to participating in the adult world you'll understand. Until then I guess keep being a twat and calling people on the internet "thots".

Coming from a guy that calls people names on the internet as well. It's not surprising you're not aware of your own hypocrisy. 
---
All of those are what to situational though no ? I have to down them in very specific places

This is so good!

As of now that‚Äôs all they are good for, rather make them better or give us another item for saving.

Tbh i'd Love to Verse a Good leatherface. Or a no-m1 hillbilly. Those are so fun to play against.
---
All I know is haven‚Äôt been flashlight saved against in months considering you can just mash the drop body button to avoid it. 
---
Been done before. Marth88 did a rank 20 to rank 1 perkless and no addons for all killers. Fastest one was hag believe it or not.
---
I'll agree that exploit should be fixed. I rarely got saved against before the pick up change so it's not like much changed there besides making time better for the killer.
---
&gt;Killers not able to pull survivors out of hatch
---
The hatch standoff is already survivor sided enough. The hatch awards bad team play. You failed as a team, it makes no sense to be awarded with a free escape AND extra points. 
---
Lmao
---
My comment serves no purpose
---
Legions power is to give you a timer that when empty downs you but that timer is paused when the game counts you as being ‚Äúin a chase‚Äù. By not looking at you the legion can make the game think that he lost track of you and that you are no longer being chased so that the timer will start to go down even though they are still following you using blood and scratch marks. It‚Äôs just a cheesy way to get around the downsides of his power. 
---
Toxicity existed before the internet. Like my mates who would yank my controller out of the N64 if they were losing at Mario party or some such nonsense. So this theory you have about "not talking about it because toxic players love control" wouldn't fly.
---
You say people need thicker skin. That's fair. They do. But nobody is forcing you read these toxic stories either. Filter them out like I do and revel in the terrible memes. This posts that complain are almost more irritating than the posts they complain about.

Is it just me or are there an oddly large number of Kates running Saboteur?

---
Diversion. S+ tier perk if used correctly 
---
What do you like about their design ? The design of the power or how they look ? Apart from how bad the power is, I find it underwhelming and kinda boring how it's just making you faster and going over palets. And I don't really like their look either, their look is too simple, especially after we got Spirit.
---
This gets more amazing the more i observe it
---
Just because certain perks arn't used doesn't make them weak. All it just means is that there other perks, such as DS, Sprint Burst, Self Care, and Adrenaline that are so strong that there isn't a point in using anything else. I think that's more so a problem than anything else. 
---
If we didn't have situational perks, there would litterally be only about five or six Survivor and Killer perks, and where is the fun in that? 
---
Also, "OK" means you can pretty much use any perk set up and still win if you're a decent of enough player. Take Monto for example. He can play with all those perks you mentioned and still survive the trial. Granted, everyone isn't on Monto's level, but you get what I'm saying. Shoot, I'm a slightly better than average Survivor and the only strong perk I use is Self Care, and on occasion Adrenaline if I am looking to play distraction for a game or two. I'll use just about anything just for kicks because I don't rely on the big four Survivor perks. 
---
theres a new legion perk which counters hook blocking, it even gives you more time than it took to recover from an attack.
---
Everyone complaining about Legion having no counterplay all of a sudden like Nurse hasn't been a thing for years.
---
Rework Lightborn and flashlights are fine, you basically can't get a save if the killer has it.
---
Pig with M&amp;A and Whispers, and go for gen grabs.
---
Who hurt you?
---
2018 Remake Clips! :D
---
Yes, by all intentionally using the most meta and crappy perk loadout to play against, (4 DS and 4 adrenaline? They didn‚Äôt want to give anyone a chance. oh and don‚Äôt forget the six second swap on top of the massive advantage of having a 4 man swf.) I can‚Äôt speak for anyone else but I‚Äôm not saying she was playing toxic like Ochido, but having every possible advantage over the killer they could give themselves is a pretty shitty way of playing. And then ofc they got all defensive when the hag girl called them out on it post game. The whole stacking all possible odds in their favor thing is the ‚Äúbullying killers‚Äù thing people are annoyed about. 
---
(You‚Äôd be annoyed if you had to face a 5 blink ebony mori nurse with Ruin, BBQ, Nurses, and NOED. You‚Äôre not gonna make it out of that, and the match is gonna be painful as hell to play.)
---
Repost?
---
What a cutie bing bong boy has become!
---
Great work
---
Well I made it so no
---
Had a friend who went up against a Twitch Streamer doing a "1 perk to Rank 1" challenge using only Self Care.
---
0 perk to Rank 1 seems like the next logical step lol.
---
https://github.com/PsiLupan/MakeLobbiesGreatAgain/releases/tag/2.2
---
Honestly it's the fist result searching on Google.
---
Download the .jar file and you're redy to use it.
---
Why do I need to compare it with four? BNP‚Äôs were and still are far more rare to find than an Ebony. 
---
Either way, doesn‚Äôt change the fact Ebony is still broken and spawns way too often in the bloodweb.
---
Funny how Urban Evasion is actually a very good counter to the Doctor (crouching slows down madness buildup and make it regress when outside the TR)
---
I don't know. Ever since the last event, I've been running into killers with insane powers. As someone who plays with randoms, it doesn't help
---
Know your killer.
---
Is Kate the new Feng?
---
Killers have some broken add ons and can use moris. Survivors can play SWF with insta heals, toolboxes and DS. Most games won't be that bad though. Sometimes you're at a big disadvantage before you even start the trial. That's life.
---
idk what rank you're on but UP + Madness 3 DS happens to me often. Maybe 1 in 5 miss
---
Well. Normal heal time is 16s (if being healed by someone else/healing someone). Self care is 32S. But w sloppy meta it‚Äôs 40s. 
---
Some people argue being healed by someone else is more time off of a gen so not very optimum. Personally, I‚Äôd heal/or like to be healed by others. I haven‚Äôt run self care in forever. And also since I run Aftercare, it‚Äôs great to get that bond with someone else. 
---
Also, you get altruism/someone else gets altruism. So more points! 
---
Myers is INCREDIBLY weak early game. You should always be able to complete at least 1 gen if your team isn‚Äôt braindead and 2 if your team is fairly competent
---
If he has infinite tier 3 then it takes an extremely long time to get from tier 2 to tier 3 giving you enough time to do another 2 gens.
---
The trick is to look around your surroundings and immediately break LOS when he‚Äôs stalking you. If you do not do at least 3 gens by the time he hits tier 3 (for infinite) then you‚Äôre going to have a very hard time escaping. 
---
If the myers is gen camping then just move onto another gen, if the survs in your game don‚Äôt spread the gens then they fucked themselves over to be honest
---
Darn
---
Or four Claudette‚Äôs, etc.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm completely fine with that. Add franklins just to piss off the 4 flashlighters
---
nothing is unfair in a game of cat and mouse, not from the cat and not from the mouse
---
Accually really like this
---
I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but I play on PS4 and even before the event, Ebonies were played way too often. Now it‚Äôs even worse.
---
The last update screwed the audio fyi. Most of the time it's as if survivors has Iron Will.
---
prova
---
Please tell me how!!! It's really blurry!!!
---
Survivor would be dead af without SWF.
---
The big "disadvantage" is going against killers who spend all their free time gathering BP for addons. Games like this I wish they implemented loot boxes
---
Holy shit, nice job
---
Of all the stuff in this game, moris don't even bother me. BNP was just too strong and I feel they are at a decent place. Maybe ebony moris only allow 2 kills? Or perhaps 2 hooks are required? Again, moris dont bother me, but bringing back a clearly broken mechanic would not alleviate your annoyance.
---
Essentially if they don't heal you have an inbuilt Frank's Mixtape addon.
---
Camping and tunneling are the easiest ways to get sacrifices as the killer, but they're rarely the most efficient way of sacrificing everyone unless you have a game plan to go along with it (tunnelling your obsession for the Remember Me or Dying Light bonuses, camping to bait overly altruistic groups of survivors etc.).
---
That, and then complain about the hatch standoff.
---
Blinding killers at pallets just wastes time, because you can't make as much distance if you have to spend 2-3 seconds pointing a light during the stun period.
---
I'm not saying instablinds should be brought back.
---
You've never been able to save mid-animation.
---
I always try to mori survivors out in the open to flex on them.
---
1. The meme is change my mind
---
2. As you're starting the unhooking hold crouch as it'll register the crouch and dodge the trap, unless they patched that
---
Knowing lockers are a counter to his power he could have just did a little effort and open them. Blocking the hatch is just being lazy and forcing a standoff.
---
What's their use? A surefire way to get dodged/tunneled/franklin's'd/mori'd?
---
You can use no perks and win as killer and survivor, doesn't mean all perks are okay. Fired up and thanatophobia are garbage, they need to be fixed. Prove thyself is leader but even worse than leader, just because there are great perks like ds doesnt mean the weak perks should be left to rot, and it doesn't mean the strong perks should be nerfed (that's a bandaid fix to make terrible perks look better while staying terrible).
---
Situational perks are not bad, the problem with bad situational perks is that they're a wasted perk slot most of the time. Left behind for example: not only do you have to be the last survivor, it really only gets use if killer is camping hatch/there are 4 or 5 gens left, even then a 1v1 where you need to complete 1 or 2 gens is so much in the killers favor, that even with the bonus left behind will provide, you will have a good chance of losing unless you get lucky.
---
 Bloodwarden for example is not a good situational perk, it is very useful when it actually does something, but swf hard counters, and even then putting the doors 99% then waiting for a survivor to get hooked and then opening the doors counters bloodwarden, and bloodwarden has such a short timer that will probably be wasted in the amount of time it takes you to reach the door combined with a good survivor looping you. Bloodwarden probably shouldn't be buffed though, because it isnt as bad as other situational perks, as it can be quite powerful in end game builds, but in regular builds that dont have noed it isnt that good most of the time.
---
This might be toxic af but one time i was in a 4 man swf and we knew michael had infinite tier 3 but we had 1 person hide the whole game so he could never get to it. Ik its not a nice thing to do but niether is being 1 shot the whole game.
---
Haha I‚Äôve never seen a kate with it but I see a lot of Claudettes running it. However they usually don‚Äôt 99 it and just destroy it right by the gen I‚Äôm doing.
---
Because there isn‚Äôt a little hillbilly in the corner. 
---
Well they did already nerf it this autumn with the healing change.
---
Isn't it already slow enough? With sloppy butcher it takes 40 seconds, that's half the time to repair a generator...
---
True 
---
Damn, you got me there.
---
Have a bit more respect when talking about King David, please. 
---
Had the inverse, ran We're Gonna Make It and they still run away when the killer was nowhere near
---
He's not been proven guilty and already people are hoping he rots  in jail? What happened to innocent untill proven guilty?
---
Looks that way, but people like to jump on the "definatly guilty" bandwagon.
---
If this happens to you often, I would recommend the following:
---
Use Doctor
---
Perks - BBQ, distressing, ruin and... IRON MAIDEN.
---

---
How would you know he left them so close together?
---
Survivors are the true killers of survivors.
---
Dbd pixelated version on phone. I would play that.
---
As a killer, Legion is super fun. Easy and gives a lot of points, even if I lose. As a survivor? Boooooring. No way to outplay aside from wasting some of his time juking.
---
You're garbage at the game and blame your incapabilities on the killer, who is literally doing his job. 'Gen camping', get outta here toxic kid.
---
Guys let's not forget he's only allegedly criminal yet.
---
Whoever did those stuff is certainly a dirty pervert tho.
---
You can't have every perks be usefull, just like you can't have every Killer be usefull. You're thinking from a competitive stand point, and that's ok, but you also gotta understand that there is always gonna perks that are less popular than others. 
---
Just because you don't use it, doesn't mean it's a waste. I can't tell you how many times these "bad situational" perks have turned the game in favour of those using them. 
---
Just have fun with the game and don't take it so seriously. I used to try and play this game competitively, but soon realized this is more so a causal game than anything else. This is the game who play when ya wanna feel a little bit of competition, but still be able to sit back on your sofa and eat some food. Get what I'm saying? 
---
Camping is on about the same level as excessive looping, both are at heart pretty of boring (unless you're getting swarmed) but potentially very rewarding - except that camping (the particularly stationary kind you describe, as definitions vary) is significantly easier to counter.
---
Those perks work against each other...
---
i‚Äôve never encountered someone else who uses that phrase for non-sexual things they enjoy. i can‚Äôt explain how many times i‚Äôve told people what a whore i am for a good book or peanut butter filled pretzels. saying i really like the item doesn‚Äôt do it justice, yknow? 
---
Speed limiter hillbilly with no M1. This is my derank build.
---
Good meme but i cant support a scammer
---
It was broken because you could potentially finish 4 gens in under a minute. While sure, killers can easily mori, it also required them to catch/hook someone. I see your point but the response is off. 
---
I‚Äôll admit legion is hell on survivors and absolutely cancer to play against, but man, I love playing them, something about his cosmetic designs and the satisfaction of hitting multiple targets I love about them.
---
As a legion man I apologize for how broken he is and I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôs fixed relatively soon
---
Crouch
---
It also keeps the survivor pop alive, so ye, voice comms really strong huh
---
I wish there was more emphasis on stealth in this game. Stealth perks to boost bloodpoints gains would be a good thing. I feel like the killer should have the heavy advantage when in the chase more and the survivors should want to stay hidden. More tools like the firecrackers and stuff to disrupt the chase to get away and less reliance on wierd things like 360s that would never work in an irl chase. Humping the killers leg just doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea to get away but it does work. I want more deadly killers and survivors to have better ways to deal with them.  Maybe setting traps like tripwires or barricade pathways to slow the killer down. Slow down repair speed on gens to make things like this more valued rather then gens being so fast it‚Äôs pointless. Idk now I‚Äôm just brainstorming and off on a tangent but yea
---
Taking powerful perks, playing in a swf and deranking on purpose to get less experienced killers might as well be considered toxic behavior. As many have stated they could have easily won if they really wanted to. They have the audacity to complain about Franklin's when not only they take the best perks in the game but also the best items into the game, it's just all mind boggling. What's more mind boggling is that people not only watch her in masse but come to her defense as well even if you watch her streams for a couple of minutes and see that she shit talks the killers constantly, just not in post game chat hehe xD. She is a really good player and I can't take that away from her though.

There was this cheeky Nea I hit while she was on the last gen &amp; she decided to finish it in my face because she had adrenaline. She immediately dc‚Äôd when she realized noed kicked in

---
What are the sound bugs?  I've just bought her,  had a few games and think she's fun.  Jus wanna know what I'm dealing with.  Thanks
---
Based on the OP's text, he is fairly new to the game, and when I first started, I saw alot of Survivors leave the last three gens together alot often so I assumed that's what happend here. I could most definitely be wrong, but I am not sure I am. 
---
Thankfully, I watched alot of Monto, Tyde, and No0b3 so I knew how to play when I first started, but not many people have prior knowledge before playing.
---
Ebony mori‚Äôs really aren‚Äôt that rare at all, especially for an ‚Äúultra rare‚Äù item. If you have all the DLC, it removes ultra-rare Splinters that let you play as other killers. That literally just leaves the Ebony Mori and whatever ultra-rare add ons the killer has.

Yea it's supposed to happen they can get past you once you hit them
---
no legion is a she because susie has the best design
---
It‚Äôs for balancing, if you hit someone they get the speed boost and can go through you. 
---
Wont that fuck up my normal movements though?
---
Where's Lightweight? Those three used to be my holy trinity on Jake as my first ever leveled char blissfully unaware of Whispers, still love that build though.
---
Yea imagine trying to move out of the way of someone attacking you?  So un-immersive.
---
Lol almost had a mini heart attack when I read it. How many thousands of hours do you even need for devotion 44!
---
When you hit a survivor they can pass right through you.. this to allow him a chance to escape and not be cornered.
---
It's designed that way, survivors get a speed boost and lose collision with the killer on hit. 
---
A.U.H. Always Upvote Huntress

Lots of people don‚Äôt have four other friends who also play dead by daylight. 
---
But it looks like he was cut in half and the top half was reattatched backwards.
---
Love them all!
---
Rank 2 but thanks for that anecdotal explanation. 
---
*thundersound*
---
Not knowing "strats" is toxic. Camping killers are not. Makes total sense.
---
Literal Meme-God-Tier. 
---
You can't win against that Myers build if he has Monitor Abuse, Tinkerer, BBQ Chilli, Noed or Ruin. 
---
He will just sneak behind you, stalk for 2 sec and instantly kill you thanks to the addons. He will then just snowball everyone else.
---
You can't win against a Hag if they have that build with Thrill of the Hunt and Noed. Infinite damn teleporters. A mori with that will just be adding insult to injury.
---
The reason for the comparison is it's a 4 v 1 game the ebony mori is an ultra rare that is meant to compete with the fact that it's against a four survivors.
---
While you're comparing something that's meant to compete with four people against a single item the comparison doesn't really fit.
---
In the same way an ebony mori can dominate a game four brand new parts or at least the old version of them could practically almost end the game for the killer within 20 seconds.
---
Not Jeepers creepers
---
Grabs have been very broken for a while. Unless the survivors don't react very quickly you won't really be getting them too much.
---
Forgot the shitpost flair
---
Until totem is broken.
---
Stop sucking and just do the totems. IDK why everyone complains about NOED. I do every totem I find just in case. They're there to slow down gen rushing a little bit, might as well get some ez points too.
---
It's useless. How often do you have the opportunity to mori the last Survivor and *actually* remember to do it? Lol
---
Just be some who can 1 shot.
---
...and insta medkits/ez mode flashlights?
---
Legion is the weakest Killer why DC?
---
If you're talking about the old brand new parts it did not take that much skill. Especially with an add-on to increase skill checks it was easier than hitting a regular great skill check.
---
 You only have to do it for about 20 seconds with a skill check every 2 seconds so you basically got 10 very easy skill checks as long as you are competent enough to hit a good skill check you should not have had any problem with brand new parts.
---
However if you're talking about the new version of brand new parts I at least say that requires more skill
---
It's not OP, just rarely comes into play. When it does, you forget you have it.
---
WAH!!!
---
Looks great! You should do meg next :)
---
Plus why would anyone want to watch sweaty rank 1 games thats trues channel its good but he makes it good they thrive off missplay and people love that content so why change it its just a couple of games its the devs fault the rank system is shocking if it was such an issue have ranked and casual and have the game based off an mmr system to combat it
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozfGeGYe-lY
---
No they weren't. I even found a flashlight tutorial from December 2016 (before flashlights were even TOUCHED by the devs after their release) and it says to time it right otherwise the killer would be blinded not stunned. Don't be so disingenuous.
---
dbd 2016 tutorial aids, but it checks out: https://youtu.be/skXC3E2Yz2w?t=61
---
In the movie he actually spent a pretty big deal of time staring at him before it got to this point so....
---
Okay, new question. How do I unhook a teammate when there's a LF revving the chainsaw in his face?
---
I really love playing him and going against him. Legion is overall my favorite killer. I respect everyone hating him although I dont understand why.
---
I usually don't even notice survivor's names until after the game started as killer, lol.
---
Perk: Convalescence. "Your time spent injured has taught you a thing or two about survival. Your recovery in dying state adds 10/15/30% to your wiggle meter. Note: Not compatible with Decisive strike. *"Dwight, wiggle that booty, the killer is coming. Wiggle Dwight"* Feng Min.
---
I think we have a situation in which you took my post a little too literally - which is my fault. 
---
I'm aware that it's 1 out of 10 (most likely), and that it isn't every person (which is why I said "large majority"), but my point was - this sub is over-saturated with crying now. I can understand whining about the game's bugs and weak killers/survivors, bc BHVR sees these posts. But crying on this sub has become way too common (nor can BHVR do anything about it). I just wish for it to be less abundant, by people reducing the number of "toxic player" posts.   
---
I don't think this post will fix anything, but I do think my post is needed to snap people out of their "funk" of crying and realize it's just a game and the internet shouldn't be a means of back-patting or catharsis - even if it's only a hand full of people. They need to learn to 'get over things' and 'get some thicker skin', b/c the toxic players aren't going anywhere and crying about it is what they want, because they love laughing at it and the control it gives them.   
---
Don't believe me? (not that you personally don't believe me) Go check out how many "toxic player" videos there are on youtube, or how many "troll compilations" there are. Its the celebrity gossip column magazines for the new age.
---
Lemme get on that list please!
---
They cut his default trap setting time in half (from 5 seconds to 2.5) and gave him new add-ons.
---
I would rather have a bot killer than no killer. These queue times make me want to play something else. 
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Don't forget the meg who can't hit skill checks and doesn't do anything.
---
This is something I tell everyone. The only thing that would make it better is some type of alert to let you know all of them are cleared.
---
Ruin slows the game down because you are gen rushing. Noed punishes you for gen rushing. Long story short. They punish you for ignoring totems.
---
Oof.
---
Well, at least the Killer can't hook you and make you watch your gen regress.
---
That's the ultimate form of torture for me when I play Survivor.
---
You kind of get troll gameplay videos in every game, but i do take your point that it is especially prevalent in DBD. I believe the biggest reason for that though is that both killers and survivors have communally created a victim mentality and entitlement to their particular version of a fair game.
---
The definition of what is toxic to the other team is so broad that basic mechanics such as pallet looping are called toxic. Merely having perks in your loadout and using them exactly as the devs intended them to be used is considered toxic such as NOED or DS.
---
With such broad and inconsistent definitions of what is or isn‚Äôt acceptable behaviour, it is only natural that animousity between the two sides perpetually rises into a state of tribalism. Tribalism breeds fighting and fighting needs visions of the enemy acting in an unacceptable way to keep the fire stoked. 
---
It is unfortunately the natural conclusion of something that traces back to a problem with the core design philosophy of DbD. BHVR took a party game that was never supposed to be balanced for fairness but rather be balanced for fun and cloaked it in a disguise of competition. The ranking system honestly is the the source of the rampant toxicity in this game. Taking it out wouldn‚Äôt help much now, but it‚Äôs implementation set standards for the game that were never part of the design philosophy.
---
cute lil bing bong boi strikes (my heart) again
---
Same. It‚Äôs not lack of player base it‚Äôs broken match making. During non peak hours matching even swf is fast. Peak east coast gaming times it actually takes much longer to get a game.
---
"Fun" is objective, "winning" is also objective.
---
You know what my "fun" is? "Winning" with not so optimal perks. Proving to myself that I don't need good perks to win, just my own skill as a player.
---
The team that does visual design is a separate team from the team that fixes and maintains the actual game. (The coders for each area are not interchangeable) Sucks but at least we get some cool stuff.
---
It literally becomes impossible to flash save when they use that exploit whereas looking up only works if the timing is wrong. If you can‚Äôt counter flashlights without having to exploit even after they‚Äôve been nerfed to shit hen you‚Äôre just bad
---
Doctor is slightly annoying to deal with but in my experience 99% of doctor players get looped for days and don‚Äôt know how to use his shock to cut off pallets. I hated going against him at first but now I love it

Yeah I know it was a joke lmao
---
0 BP 
---
I like playing kinda silly when I'm killer just like this guy. Moonwalking as Myers by the exit gates and whipping bottles in the air as the clown. It makes the game fun for everyone. 
---
I love how you magically overlook how massive of a game slow that is. Find all 8 dull totems and do no gens while the killer YEETS across the map. 
---
You can‚Äôt get a single kill before all 5 gens are done, but you expect survivors to find and destroy all 8 totems. 
---
Yeah, there are definitely more pressing issues currently in the game. Still, I would like to see some at least some changes down the line, maybe even as far next year if necessary.
---
QuItTer boNuS
---
Let John Carpenter also follow him in the game when the music is playing 
---
It's only possible with play with your food but I always waste tokens accidentally smacking people. 
---
There are only 5 totem friend. This just shows you have no idea how the game works, and are probably rank 15. Good try tho.
---
Oh wow. You can‚Äôt be serious. 
---
You have this mega powerful perk that you can use IN EVERY GAME and your whining about the use of very rare items? Or a perk that‚Äôs only usable once per match?
---
Reevaluate your life. 
---
Only makes the dab S T R O N G E R
---
That's what memes are for though. 
---
Mistype. Doesn‚Äôt matter. Still a massive game slow. 
---
Gesundheit 
---
If you think at red rank you face the same 3-6 people every single game you have never been to red rank and you are just a sheep to some shitty behavior that is tried to made look ok by a streamer with even shittier reasons.
---
Considering how fast survivors do generators when they are even slightly coordinated, im okay with slowing the game down. Just a little bit.
---
Yeah, they were deranking all the way down to ranks 2-6, what a bunch of bullies.
---
That build screams Claudette
---
I took off Franklin's for noed because I had a bad game. The survivors didn't get all of the gens and one of them used a key to get out of the hatch. I'd have gotten a merciless if I had Frankie's.
---
Mystery boxes are the reason for your sadness 
---
What is the gen camping that survivors do?
---
Buying the DLC doesnt seem to actually remove the splinters. The other day I pulled a glass splinter on the pigs tree.
---
I totally agree with extra life, they have a lot more tools than killers 
---
First off, you're assuming. Check yourself. I play them both equally. Always have.
---
THERE ARE 4 SURVIVORS, SEE A TOTEM. FUCKIN DO IT. EASY PEASY. It makes you dumb if you know the current meta is NOED and still refuse to do totems.
---
My bias is how powerful gen rushing is, especially on large maps. I can run a good killer around for a solid minute or two. 4 people that are good at running, c'mon. Who was it? The streamer who got 3 friends, and named themselves the Depip Squad and won 50 games in a row. Shove off mate. I've played this game since the beginning, rank one more times than I can count as survivor and killer. No bias, just experience.
---
LOL. Wanna talk about broken? Instant 50% completion on a gen for just pressing a button?
---
Details please 
---
Man, that would be sweet 
---
They hated Jesus because he told them the truth. 
---
Yes, this is so annoying
---
It was okay before Deliverance. Now it's just outclassed.
---
I never refused to chase people. I got several hits on the three remaining survivors I just never let them try to take me far away from the gens. The game eventually swung to my favor when one of them ran to a nearby border wall with no pallets or windows in/around the obstacles. It fell apart for them after that.
---
Jen Denise don't send hate tho
---
So BHVR releases a weak killer, the reason being they aimed for a fun killer... But instead released a weak Killer who is unfun to go against? Sounds about right
---
People who D/C to depip are the worst. But this guy... He's a little above the worst
---
America here, can take upto 10 minutes to get a match as a survivor. Almost instant as a killer. Playing on Xbox One X. 
---
See so far I thought leatherface is kind of bad compared to the base killers you get (except trapper). I do feel bad though because the game did spawn a survivor only two gens away from where I spawned. It was their lowest ranked player who was running no mither and ended up dying first.
---
How? 
---
 Play Freddy, if people are alive at the end and gates get powered - go inside the survivor who is opening the gate and see. Terrifying stuff!  If you dare..!

---
And then in post game chat they flame the killer for camping and tunneling when they were the one who gave the killer the free kills
---
Wow really! You're so insightful! Thanks. you ignorant cabbage.
---
Infinite EW3 Myers had to charge for a while, off multiple people, usually all 4 or 2 and the Obsession with the notebook add-on.
---
This was very avoidable.
---
Are the mooing cows on Coldwind Farm still alive? üò≥
---
On a more serious note, why do people unhook me right in front of the killer so often? Is it really worth the points? I feel so helpless when they do it.
---
I think a lot of killers think survivors gen tap, when in fact, they just hit the skill checks.  The skill checks are not that hard to hit unless of course, you are new to the game.  Hence why i think Ruin is more of noob perk
---
All you have to do is commit to the gen. If there is ruin someone will eventually stumble upon it since totem spawns are so bad lol. 
---
I don't see an alternative to 360s here...
---
Was doing a Huntress match and wound up on Springwood because of a burnt offering (because I can't play Huntress without winding up on a cramped map.)  I unfortunately wound up letting a Rank 2 Dwight that did almost everything on this list go because, well, even when NOED activated I just couldn't hit the guy.  360s were on point, he dodged every hatchet, his connection was JUST iffy enough that the little skips made me lose and miss him every time.  I'd already managed to hook him once earlier in the game, and it was very obvious he was just buying time for the other remaining survivor to open a gate...so I got him to have me chase him close enough to the gate I knew was the one, broke off the chase, downed the other survivor as they tried to run in, hooked them, and chased the Dwight out the door.
---
I hate letting toxicity and use of exploits (and yes 360ing done properly is exploiting a flaw in the game's aim assist coding) go unpunished but sometimes...you just gotta appreciate that yes, sometimes it really is a "Tactical killer-diversion."
---
Hmm that's usually what I do but I always end up getting caught in his sleep thing even if I'm not the one he's chasing.  I know about failing a skill check to wake up but it's usually easier said than done.
---
How so? I feel like that‚Äôs something that could be said for any number of new item ideas. 
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs your fault you tried to escape, you filthy scum. 
---
Really nice, love pixel art. 
---
As a killer main, neither of these things that you are trying to address are a problem.
---
Yeah, I rarely see gen tapping &amp; when I do, it's always confusing to me since it takes substantially longer than just hitting good skill checks. This "fix" would slow down something *that's already slower,* which is not going to prevent people from doing it.
---
well he was right on top of the hatch so it mustve been pretty loud
---
Jen knows the killer is going to be worse at the game then her at any rank, she has 7k+ hours in the game, she can win at whatever rank she wants and that should be obvious. The only thing that gets me annoyed is seeing her against killers who don't even have all 4 perks, which is not that often, but still, whenever it happens it's shitty.
---
This whole thread acting like Jen is a piece of trash because she abuses the awfully desgined and implemented ranking system of DbD is a little too much. 
---
That is actually better than my idea.
---
Yeah, I got accused of gen tapping once vs a Hag when I just literally *did not get a single skill check* until the gen was already 80%, then I hit a Great &amp; didn't get another skillcheck for the rest of the gen. I can't force the game to give me skill checks, I don't know what she expected me to do.
---
It might be the sound made when the obsession is decided at the start of a game. I don't know if it makes the sound if you're not the killer/survivor chosen as the obsession, but that may be what you're thinking of
---
Rank 1 sucks. I'm at rank 1 killer/survivor and the games are so repetitive and boring. Can't wait for the 13th. For some reason killers really want to maintain their rank so they use ulta rare addons constantly. And on the flip side, Rank 1 survivors loooooooove to be as toxic as possible running multiple instaheals, d-strikes, flashlight spam and teabag to the max. Bring me back to rank 15 please on both.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work, the amount of times I‚Äôve used deliverance and had the trap set off is astounding lol
---
Well, he just demonstrates his incompetence and pettiness. Very explicitly.
---
I can assure you, it does. I was going for the 50 unhook achievement with deliverance and came across many hags and can confirm, you still set them off.
---
you might be talking about the obsession sound, there is an audio cue when the obsession in the match is chosen. it happens a few seconds after the match is started, like 2s after your camera stops spinning around your character, you don't hear it every time because not every match has someone with obsession based perk in it and the obsession isn't chosen unless there is such perk in the game
---
it's also the way killers recognize that there is decisive strike in the match, because its the most commonly used obsession perk 
---
That is pretty scary, but its so hard to get 5 tokens on devour hope especially on tier 1, but with rancor, its not a totem, its Unavoidable.
---
Probs gonna get downvoted but couldn't you leave one up if you don't know where the last one is and hope it lands on the one you know of?
---
Not sure if sarcastic or not but if NOED is such a problem for survivors then surely destroying the totems IS trying to escape. Not doing the totems is just lazyness and NOED is the possible consequence?
---
He was definitely Tier 3 at this point. 
---
The only audio cues I can think of at match start are either "you have an item" (a high-pitched ting) or "you are the obsession" (a kind of hollow quake-y sound of doom.)
---
that's why it says "no one escapes death". because you wanted to too much. if only you'd just take some time of your busy schedule to cleanse, you'd have more chances. 
---
LOL, your response got removed by a mod/auto removed, but I can still see it on your profile and quite frankly, it just shows your ignorance/limited mentality so I'm done with this little chat.

Mhm
---
LMAO DO ALL THE TOTEMS. LMAO. jUST JUGGLE DECISIVE. LMFAO
---
Lol I like David just lingering around in the middle of you two love birds. 
---
No you don‚Äôt hand them a victory. You chase them down and hook them. Hooking someone and then returning to gen patrolling is not the same as refusing to chase someone and staying by gens. This isn‚Äôt a hard concept to grasp. 
---
Fuck Marth88 honestly. I played against him in Last Year and when he won all he could do was just talk shit and the moment someone joined and opted for killer he left instantly.
---
Also his experiment was an extreme version of what people do. SWFs don‚Äôt always play with the goal of winning (with the exception of a few groups)
---
Sure when they remove DS and Adrenaline, then NOED can go too.
---
I hardly think the name of the perk is relevant at all in this conversation. 
---
Maybe I‚Äôd have more chances, maybe I‚Äôd be giving the killer an easier win due to gens not being completed fast enough, maybe the killer doesn‚Äôt even have noed and I‚Äôve just wasted time and helped the killer out rather than my own team. It‚Äôs not as simple as you and so many others consider it to be.
---
&gt; Though I agree it‚Äôs kinda satisfying to finally give the survivors some broken bullshit after all this time they can feel what it‚Äôs like.
---
Yeah, because Omega Blink Nurse (or Nurse in general), Insta Saw Billy, Iri Head Huntress, Double Purple Spirit, all + Ebony Mori is so balanced, really, survivors don't know how it's like to deal with broken shit. But poor killers, having to deal with the "shack infinite"...
---
In single player yes.
---
In a 4 man swf lol no it barely impacts the game at all.
---
I bring in Botany or We'll Make It and am always thinking, "yeah you see these fast heals?"
---
this gave me the motivation to do it, thanks b 
---
I have any more levels and hours on killer tho, that's why I'm kinda bored of playing them atm haha
---
I agree.  Leveling up devotion is actually worse for me because when you hit 1 again you earn less shards
---
Between that and shit memes that get spammed and reposted *cough cough* this one *cough cough*, yeah. 
---
Camping does exist. But your allowed to do it regardless of what people say
---
Thats not camping at all. Dont listen to them there just being salty
---
I mean do what you want but don‚Äôt be upset when you come across a 4 man immersed Claudette squad on swamp.
---
If you don't try to cleanse the dulls, you don't get to complain.
---
I've never had a clutch moment with this perk. You're lucky you got any use from it. 
---
It still gives me the same error unfortunately.
---
&lt;small dick enery&gt; LMAO....dude, that made my day. 
---
Also howdy Panda
---
Ds can be countered and adrenaline can too cause then they are exhausted and cant use whatever pther exhaustion perk they have
---
Concerns are always good to have. 
---
During the blood rush, I had a Nea come up to me while I was in a gen. She got mad that I didn‚Äôt instantly stop what I was doing and help her, so she hopped on the gen and purposely kept missing skill checks until the killer came. If she‚Äôd just helped me finish it, I‚Äôd have healed her right after. The killer had gotten too many fast hooks and I was trying to get a second gen on so SOMEONE could escape. 
---
Just like crackers, I image it could be possible that without an add on, the horn may also deafen a nearby survivor for a few seconds. I dunno. This is just a thought of course. 
---
Do I have to use Decisive the first time I‚Äôm picked up? Like if I don‚Äôt press the button at all and start struggling after, will I still have a chance to use it next time? Sometimes the killer has me in a good spot and I don‚Äôt wanna use it but I do anyway because I don‚Äôt wanna lose it. The only time I‚Äôve been able to use it on the second hook attempt or pickup is when I was hooked before I had a chance to on the first one. 
---
Ahaha yas! I dont rly run WMI because I‚Äôm not altruistic! But Botany does come in handy!
---
It takes about a 1-2 mins for me and my friend to cleanse all dulls, if all 4 survs wanted to it'd be less than that easily.
---
Yeah I hate that there are only 2 perks with bp gain if I remember correctly and one of them encourages for lack of better words farming your teammates.
---
Because of his inability to interact with survivors until he sleeps them. For the first part of the game, he‚Äôs pretty much useless. The reason he does so well at low ranks is that survivors don‚Äôt know how to play against him, which isn‚Äôt your fault. Freddy is the worst killer for so many reasons that he‚Äôs getting a full rework of his power. Countless buffs and reworks have been suggested but we still have to wait for a rework. 
---
So to answer your question he‚Äôs bad because:
---
1) He can‚Äôt interact with survivors until he pulls them to sleep
---
2) his power doesn‚Äôt help him in the chase
---
3) He can‚Äôt camp at all (which I know is considered ‚Äúbad‚Äù but sometimes you have to camp to secure kills). 
---
However, there ARE some things that he can do fairly well. For a whole bunch of strategies, I‚Äôd suggest watching some YouTube videos on him, Bricky‚Äôs casefile on him does a pretty good job. 
---
Freddy is probably the best Stealth killer. Being completely invisible makes him the best stealth killer. Tracking perks makes it easier to sneak up on survivors and sleep them. 
---
Freddy‚Äôs addon Class Photo makes Freddy pretty viable. Basically, during the dream transition you see all survivors aura‚Äôs. Pretty much all Purple addons make Freddy somewhat viable. He‚Äôs really only good in lower ranks though. 
---
Right, I was joking. I think it's a valid strategy. The worst part of being camped as a survivor is that your teammates dont do gens OR try to save you either
---
Are you playing as killer or survivor? Because if it‚Äôs killer then that means the Entity chose an obsession, and if it‚Äôs survivor then that means you‚Äôre the obsession. 
---
bingo!  Camping does not exist. I mean there are no tents in the game/  Another thing which doesn't exist is gen rushing, which has to be the stupidest term I've heard used in this game. 
---
1-2 minutes isn‚Äôt exactly a short amount of time in dbd... now that‚Äôs also a number you would no really see with good spawns and high totem spawn knowledge which many players don‚Äôt have. 
---
And what would you suggest for solo players who don‚Äôt have the assistance of a +1 to find them quicker?
---
Oh sorry. Too used to steam forums XD. Yeah i agree its damn annoying. And nobody knows the wiggle thing anymore
---
Yeah I make sure I'm not the one to open the exit gates when I'm the obsession with rancor unless I know another survivor is keeping the killer busy. It really isnt hard to survive rancor. I dont think I've died to it yet and wouldnt be salty if I did.
---
But you didn't answer my question about what crutch perks can't be countered. And that is not true at all lmao. It doesn't take less time because they are 4 man. They still have to find the totems and then do them. That still takes a while to do. And if you can't capitalize on that you have no reason to complain.
---
DS can't be countered consistently. Luck plays a hig part.
---
Nobody cares about the speed boost from adrenaline lol the big thing is the instaheal which can't be countered.
---
1 runs killer, 2 on gens, once takes dulls and goes on gens.
---
If all you try to do in a match is do the gens and get out ASAP you deserve to get hit with NOED.
---
Right. I agree. What sucks is that even if gens are finished quickly as a survivor it still feels like forever to finish a gen. Maybe they would make skillchecks harder and more frequent. 
---
Only time I get disconnected is when player's drop when I use Doctor.
---
noob as in, it only really effects new or inexperienced players.  IMO....
---
The wiggle thing?
---
Deactivating no-ed takes team effort. I don't want to get fucked because of laziness of my teammates. I want to be punished because of my mistakes.
---
But seriously, it's happened to me a lot lately.
---
Agreed
---
No tunnelling does exist because if you‚Äôre actively ignoring other survivors and only focusing one person then that‚Äôs tunnelling. Doing generators fast isn‚Äôt toxic, but chasing and harassing one player throughout the match and actively ignoring others is toxic.
---
bring back the 3 o clock skill check :D
---
Interesting. It wasnt like this before. It drops for me before the game even starts and before we know who the killer is, i usually play as survivor. 
---
When your being camped you wiggle on the hook but dont jump off to tell everyone "im being camped dont save me". Everyone used to do it but not anymore
---
No, you can save your decisive strike for any time in the game you‚Äôre picked up. You don‚Äôt have to use it the first time 
---
You can also just run Enduring and eat the DS than down them again. That's what, and extra 15-20 seconds at MOST? 
---
Never seen more than two DS get used in single match, even if they all had it.
---
Adrenaline can be minimalized if you're Huntress, Hillbilly, Nurse, decent add-ons with Wraith, decent Hag trap placements, decent Clown intoxication throws, and possibly Spirit, but it too, is usually only used by one or two people per match. 
---
NOED has a possibilty to be disabled EXCEPT almost no one seems be breaking totems unless it's already glowing like a bonfire so it tends to work most of the time.
---
 
---
You're too focused on the rare SWF that all have the great Survivor perks except you forget that they only appear every few dozen matches or so, and half the time they are boosted beyond belief by their perks that they crumble under any decent Killer. 
---
I run bubbas basement. I also have mine leveled and territorial on him. One I hear the notification I go back and chainsaw down the stairs. 
---
Im a rank 1 survivor (PS4). I would like to think that i am pretty good at most aspects of the game, except chasing. I SUCK at chasing and i dont know how to improve so any tips would be appreciated   :)
---
I think the spookiest is scratched mirror Myers on Lerys. 
---
Aw thanks so much!! I'm so glad you like it! 
---
Yes all the time. I notice when I play killer (a rarity) everyone loads in at the same time. I‚Äôm guessing they assume SWF and dodge it. Which isn‚Äôt true 99% of the time. 
---
it's been getting worst yes, for me at least but i think it depends on the "host's" connection not yours, so if you play as a survivor, the map and everything runs on the killer's servers, does that make sense, that is why when you click on killer it tells you to create a room, and if you hit survivor, it tells you to join one instead. not sure if it makes sense, but if you get a lot of lag is probably the killer who is at fault, not your internet provider, but his. 
---
Panda I like your videos, but I‚Äôm gonna have to disagree with you on this one. 
---
NOED is a ruin 2.0 as you‚Äôre forced to stop doing the main objective of the game to look for small objects on the map because there‚Äôs a small chance that there‚Äôs gonna be a perk that punishes doing the objectives. The perk rewards bad killers the same way DS rewards bad survivors.
---
Using the ‚Äújust cleanse totems‚Äù argument can be applied to DS by saying ‚Äújust dribble‚Äù or ‚Äújust slug‚Äù. The argument of ‚Äúyou have a perk that tells you where totems are‚Äù is an invalid argument as you‚Äôre sacrificing a perk slot just to prevent a perk that might not even be in use, it‚Äôs like saying ‚Äújust use Enduring to avoid DS‚Äù because you‚Äôre sacrificing a perk slot to counter a perk that might not even be there (although Enduring actually has a use if the survivors don‚Äôt have DS)
---
Her too, but the rigs addons are fixed. though her addons are all pretty crap in comparison to the croching/ambush addons, because of how base ambush/crouch so bad. 
---
I think if they ever give her the clown treatment (buff the baseline ability and bring down the addon for ambush) we'd actually have a reason to try out her 18 other addons.
---
Repost
---
I saw this post a few days ago... 
---
Off meta stamp of approval. 
---
How is this hard just have friends and work on gens. Gg ez
---
The rest are "doing gens, you?"
---
And on top of that, redo the OG moris. They're kinda boring
---
He‚Äôs a huge douche 
---
In reality you just get camped when you run a killer around more than a minute. 
---
This is why i run small game tm
---
This will never get old. 
---
Enjoy a non blurry game!
---
I hear the rumors last year about Jeepers Creepers, I really wanted that killer to be added, but devs don't want to pay the rights to a rapist
---
It always happens when I run remember me like I just want to see the survivor try to open the door for 5 hours
---
Somone on steam said the thing. I knew that would win thats why i changed it to stuff myers does as mirror or just tier 1
---
Wish granted! But for survivors...
---
but their power is the reason why they are unfun to play vs
---
&gt;It's your fault you got Decisively Struck because you picked up the Obsession
---
Ignoring completely how stupid both of these arguments are, if you're not in a SWF and you decide to clean dull totems you are completely useless for at LEAST 3-5 minutes to counter a perk that the killer may or may not have.
---
Thats so true. And that claude is a great example of whats wrong with thia game XD
---
Everyone comes along at least 1 totem. Takes a few seconds to get rid. Hell I normally see at least 3 per game.
---
Its nothing to a 4 man swf lol because it takes jo time.
---
That's the way to do it honestly. If they are doing gens quick I will always try to protect 3 to 4 ge s that are clustered and it makes it really easy. Sounds like they are just kind of whiny.
---
Holy shit that's a dead meme right there
---
I was told to kill myself because i ran noed after i sacrificed everyone.
---
Noed didn't proc because 2 gens were needed to be fixed.
---
Love the quality of the game 
---
was going to say the same, it should go back to the old exp req from lower levels but keep the 300 or so shards per level as a reward for devotion until you get back to the 4200exp req.
---
&gt;Also good for if you want to BM a toxic survivor, just swing over and over while carrying them to a hook.
---
The only reason to run this perk. Play pig. Carry survivor to hook while swinging. Proceed to teabag after hooking. 
---
All troll potential aside I completely agree with your last point. This perk will very probably do more for you than Ruin ever will in its current state unless you play a campy killer.
---
 \*Removed the ability for Survivors to view the Killers perks, add-ons and offerings in the tally screen during an on-going match. Killer information will be revealed once all Survivors have exited the match. 
---
Hell yeah, no more SFW ruining end-game perks
---
Love being a r1 nurse main :)
---
True words
---
Look for posts by the user named Skemoo, he is the gatekeeper
---
Happens a lot with swf
---
As a r9 Legion main I can‚Äôt relate
---
Killer mains rejoice!
---
PIG SCORING ADJUSTMENTS
---
*Initiate dash attack: increased from 50 to 100.
---
*Hit during dash attack: increased from 250 to 500.
---
They finally gave Piggy the BP she deserves!
---
Welcome back to 2006
---
Totems, healing and sabotage do not count as objectives and are optional. You can play an entire match without any of doing any of them and still get iridescent lightbringer, you‚Äôre clearly out of touch with this game if you think healing is an objective.
---
NOT Claudette ;)
---
Its not hard. I reached rank 1 with Freddy only (no addons or perks), from rank 15.
---
&lt; *All status effects that are timer based no longer stack or automatically reset the timer, but rather, take the highest remaining status timer and ignore the other.
---
So exhaustion addons are still broken. Good to know. 
---
Every few dozen matches? No lol not being funny but its really not.
---
Adrenaline isnt about the speed boost. Nobody cares about that. Its the instaheal thats the problem, especially if you've played how the survivors want, 2 hook everyone and now have multiple survivors left at end game. You've got 20 seconds to down them all...not gonna happen when they all pop that instaheal.
---
Enduring and DS....it depends entirely on the killer used and where the survivor goes down. Sometimes it can be 5 seconds, sometimes the survivor goes down right next to a mega loop and the DS buys them the time to reach it.
---
Plus notice how you need a perk to counter DS. You dont need any to counter NOED or Ruin.
---
Even bbq - distortion can counter it but now you also have within 40m, hiding behjnd gens or hiding in lockers.
---
Killers get the raw deal as always.
---
NOED is not op, its frustrating.  
---
Same as Legion actually.  
---
Perk isn't imbalanced and too strong.  
---
Perk makes you feel bad and cheated on.
---
Thanks!
---
Jesus christ, that scared me
---
I really wish it was still possible for solo survivors to see perks... i just want to see what the killer has without waiting for like 10minutes
---
&gt;Leader: All action speeds, with the exception of repair speed, are increased to 15%/20%/25% instead of 3%/6%/9%. The effect now persists for 15/20/25 seconds after the perk owner is out of range.
---
I was excited but then the "with the exception of repair speed" part then sunk it. I get that having those numbers effect repair speed would be maybe too strong, but still.
---
It looks like Adam
---
L is for legion, he‚Äôs so bad lol
---
Maybe by killers filled with babyrage. I respect any survivor who can loop me after all these nerfs.
---
Why am I suffering from success then fool?
---
Keep in mind this affects vault speed as well.
---
It shows.
---
Does the killer have any objectives beyond killing? How is complaining about generators getting done any different than complaining that killers kill? Tunneling is just complaining that killers are doing their job.
---
And also, totems and healing could easily be considered secondary objectives, especially because that gets you altruism and boldness points.
---
It‚Äôs called a wired connection, try it
---
Considering the fact that Freddy has been a laughing stock for well over an year now,I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Learn the map layouts and identify the spawn patterns of safety pallets, windows and jungle gyms. It takes time and playing a few matches as the killer every now and again will help you identify them. 
---
That sucks. I imagine you got like 8000 objective, but basically nothing in the other categories?
---
Survivor really needs a bp overhaul, it should be as rewarding as Killer IMO without forcing you to run a perk just for bloodpoints or effectively 1v1 the game.
---
Worst kind of survivors. Glad you gave them no quarter.
---
I literally just run an anti-pallet build on Trapper. I guess you could say the closest thing I have to an endgame build is that I put traps in front of the gate switches with coil add-ons so that it takes longer to get them open.
---
It's broken. Mine's been stuck at 53/180 for about a week and doesn't advance no matter how many co-op actions I do. It's just a joke not to trash it at the moment lol.
---
Not true. Its 14 seconds to cleanse it. Which doesn't include the time to actually look for it. So to cleanse every totem it would be 70 seconds, assuming one totem gets done at a time. This can also be extended by 10% with Thrill. And this also doesn't include the time to find each totem.
---
A gen takes 80 seconds to complete. So my point still stands that it takes a lot of time to do and if you can't capitalize of them doing basically another generator then you have no reason to complain.
---
And cleansing, unhook, and hatch jumps. Leader might not be the most meta perk but it's unique enough its worth running on cooperative builds.
---
I hate it when I get  franklin's'd 
---
Removed the ability to see killers perks and addons once dead. NOED intensifies 
---
&gt;* Self-Care: All healing action speeds are reduced by 45%/35%/25%. This action speed penalty replaces the previous Self-care penalty (-50% speed) and applies a flat penalty to ALL healing actions. *DEV NOTE: This is a change we are trying out for the PTB. It may not be included in the final release.
---
Ok, if I'm reading this right, this means if you want self-care to heal yourself, you now also heal everyone else slower as well? Helluva interesting drawback. 
---
I'm actually conflicted upon first reading this and it's kind of exciting. Because now self-caring versus sloppy butcher is no longer an exercise in torture but it's going to come at an expense of being altruistic.
---
Personally, I have found the biggest difference between being good and mediocre at chases as a survivor is whether or not you plan out routes. While looking for gens, take note of loop and pallet locations. While on a gen or other objective, plan out multiple routes you could run away depending on which direction the killer comes from.
---
Rescuing from leatherface is pretty rough. You'll probably need one person to distract and another to unhook, and/or a blind or stun. It's generally better to just let them camp and rush gens, though.
---
How often did you get out of the basement during it? 
---
To the people saying that Ghostface is too cheesy, Freddy is ten times more cheesy with him using stupid gags in the later films with cheesy one liners. Only thing that's cheesy about ghostface as a character is his clumsiness which fits dbd with the amount of pallets thrown on his head. If Jason or ghostface isn't the next licensed character I'll be disappointed
---
I hope they go with self care change. After last update healing takes forever. 
---
Hits with franklins the moment before DC
---
I agree with the other commenter, before you start the gen just look around for what route you will take, I usually look for the nearest window/pallet. Loop them around the pallet as long as you can until you need to drop it, then run to the next pallet/window and continue to try looping them. In my experience, 360s are a last resort and usually don't work out. 
---
The best you‚Äôll find is yellow pings but they‚Äôll still be playable af
---
wait so you only get -25% speed on healing yourself and healing others?, no penalty when others heal you?
---
What‚Äôs a crow bomb?
---
Gate opening?
---
If you're not having fun playing as Legion then you're not playing him well. 
---
Beat me to it.
---
Anyways here's the things I want to mention:
---
* Bamboozle: Updated text to reflect the perk does not work with pallets.
---
&gt;Crying Legion mains.
---
* Spies from the Shadows: Increased the chances of a visual notification to 100% for all tiers. Added crow in Loud Noise notification. Increased the notification range from 16/24/36 meters to 32/40/48 meters.
---
&gt;I mean it's still worthless but at least it works now.
---
* Surveillance: All generators start under the effects of Surveillance at the start of the match. Increased repair hearing distance by 8 meters. Regressing generators will be highlighted by a white aura. Once regression stops, generators will be highlighted by a yellow aura for 8/12/16 seconds.
---
&gt;Wow it's about fucking time that this perk got buffed. It's still shit tbh but for certain Killers (Pig, but also more stealthy Killers like Wraith and Myers) this is actually not a horrible perk anymore. It also debatably has some use for more mobile Killers like Hillbilly. Actually not a terrible buff. :)
---
* Increased (Pig's) Terror Radius from 28 meters to 32 meters.
---
&gt;Literally why tho.
---
* Leader: All action speeds, with the exception of repair speed, are [increased to 15%/20%/25%](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/026/913/excuse.jpg) instead of 3%/6%/9%. The effect now persists for 15/20/25 seconds after the perk owner is out of range.
---
* Prove Thyself: Increased repair speed by 10% for each other survivor working on a generator within a range of 4 meters. Gain 50%/75%/100% more Bloodpoints for coop actions. Only one Prove Thyself effect at a time.
---
&gt;So Prove Thyself is a farming perk now? We did it Reddit, because I swear I saw this suggestion on Reddit. But now it's strictly speaking better than Leader. (Say for the lingering aura of Leader and Leader's new OMGWTFBBQ buff for cleansing totems.) I still don't think PT beats WGLF but... this is interesting.
---
* [Removed the ability for Survivors to view the Killers perks, add-ons and offerings in the tally screen during an on-going match. Killer information will be revealed once all Survivors have exited the match.](https://youtu.be/H1miD_iNEGo?t=70)
---
* PTB KNOWN ISSUES - Permanent heavy bleeding when the Wraith performs a Surprised attach with Sloppy Butcher AND the "Blind Warrior" - White add-on. Perk and add-on were fixed individually.
---
&gt;I mean Wraith literally crashes games with Sloppy Butcher so uh...
---
* Self-Care: All healing action speeds are reduced by 45%/35%/25%. This action speed penalty replaces the previous Self-care penalty (-50% speed) and applies a flat penalty to ALL healing actions. *DEV NOTE: This is a change we are trying out for the PTB. It may not be included in the final release.
---
&gt;Uhhhh no. Please no don't do this. This is literally the worst change they could do to Self Care. This will make players even more selfish than they currently are please don't go through with this change.
---
No sign of Sloppy Butcher being fixed yet.
---
Looks like the other thread got nuked? Either way, copy/pasting my comments from there:
---
 &gt;Self-Care: All healing action speeds are reduced by 45%/35%/25%. This action speed penalty replaces the previous Self-care penalty (-50% speed) and applies a flat penalty to ALL healing actions. *DEV NOTE: This is a change we are trying out for the PTB. It may not be included in the final release.
---
Ok, if I'm reading this right, this means if you want self-care to heal yourself, you now also heal everyone else slower as well? Helluva interesting drawback.
---
I love this update!
---
Man, that Selfcare change is gonna be weird. If I'm reading this right then at max level you can now heal yourself at 75% speed (as opposed to the original 50%), but also only heal others at the same speed? That means its faster for 2 people to self care than to heal each other (as opposed to before where it was the same speed either way)
---
pretty sure hes not a bad killer, and his design isnt poor. it stops gen rush like its designed to do..your a super intelligent human being!!
---
Some really good changes here
---
So Sloppy Butcher still isn't being fixed yet. How annoying.
---
Isn't this how modern day "soft" censor was born?
---
They ruined it
---
Shit really? I'm rank 91 as well, had no idea it that happened when it reset
---
oh please
---
After people complained that survivors are too strong they straight up just buffer survivors more. 
---
Self care buffs, leader rushes gens quicker, no momentum loss while vaulting.
---
Meanwhile, unless you only play legion and pig, the only thing killers get are some (claimed to be) better totem placements and hook spawning(which I think nobody really had any issues with).
---
Those seem like some nice killer buffs imo. Spies actually seems like a good perk now. I don't really play killer though so I could very well be wrong. 
---
Some nice survivor perk buffs too. Seems like a pretty good patch all around
---
Yea, from how it reads it sounds like you can now heal yourself, but at the expense of healing others. If another person doesn't run self-care then they'll get full speed if they heal you.
---
I'm assuming you're referring to the wraith bug? In which case it's under "known issues" and the perk, as well as the addon have been fixed individually, but still bug when used together.
---
In the context you used it appeared you were only talking about the text in the meme. Perhaps use your head a little bit lmfao
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit personally but you seem pretty salty that someone didn‚Äôt understand your poorly made post lol
---
I‚Äôm doing it out of spite at this point 
---
It's just friendly banter umad
---
Nice ribbons, I really like themüòÄ
---
If you ever are in moment full of adrenaline and panic you have no idea how weird your brain works. When I came to my friends yard her huge dog was running to me, was always a friendly dog and I was about to meet him with my arms open, but instead the dog decided he wanted to have a taste of my stomach and bit into sides of me, my friend saw it and was running to save me, she tried to hold her dog but barely could, I was running to the gates and couldnt open them, my hands were shaking, my mind was blank, like literally was unable to open gate and just climbed over it. Never trusted her dog again and also realized how weird it is when you're in full panic mode, the gate would had been super easy to open, but idk what happened to me.
---
Same deal with third seal (though to a lesser extent since it reveals when you're hit). I use that perk on the Legion and I feel like it's always the first thing that gets done. No gens but hey, all my totems are gone... Yay...
---
Yes mad grit it‚Äôs not bad but it still sucks that I have to waste a perk slot just to counter hook blockers when it‚Äôs actually a reportable offense in the game 
---
Not sure how I feel about it. I don't use Self-Care so it's gonna suck being healed by everyone else at a slower speed.
---
Nurse is tough to start. If playing on PC all you need is more practice. If playing on console same thing but... good luck
---
Yeah, for the first couple of levels, you make less than 100 shards. But you do level up quicker (for the first couple of levels) . Its just an inconvenience to me. 
---
Unfortunately I think that was the intention. Self care was a bit too strong tbh.
---
I always assume they dont run it and try to heal them but they run away even though its safe.
---
It's actually true though, lol. The only survivor buff that has been released that actually meant something was the invincibility frames added during the un-hook animation.
---
Best perk combos in the game.
---
I guess many Pig mains will be quite happy with these changes. I know I will
---
Removed - Use the Megathread
---
Is it me or the new Surveillance changes seems to be very powerful for someone like a spirit/nurse/billy? Basically a better Discordance
---
I bit the bullet on Laurie Strode and have her at Prestige 3 with everything ‚Ä¶ so when I Prestige a character I got back to her and earn blood points to use on other characters. I typically do it after about 200K, and hope I get the perks back. 
---
When I took Kate to prestige II I did not get self-care the entire time.  
---
Get better at being chased then. 
---
That spies from the shadows buff got me spo0ked.
---
Gonna be forever until I get used to it.
---
4 kills. Sacrifice or Mori all survivors. 
---
I believe you‚Äôll use the perks you play still. 
---
The crowa return!! Im so happy to see this. This is actually a great patch for everyone
---
You can't have 4 insta d strikes...can we just clarify that? 4 d strikes isn't that bad. I rarely get the surprise d strike. Hooks are like everywhere now. 
---
4 kills, all the survivors died.
---
Yes, unfortunately you get no perks or add-ons. Makes the offerings kind of unrewarding for being ultra rare, they should at least let you use the perks you have currently equipped.
---
Was the weird wraith blood spurting thing fixed ?
---
So you just want everything way stronger?
---
first i use all offerings and items i can and save as much bp as i can, then i prestige.  but i only did to feng min for the 3 achivs from reseting your character
---
No, it says the infinite bleeding is fixed
---
Yea I‚Äôm confused. This isn‚Äôt a nerf to anyone except the team mates of people running self care. 
---
nurse is one of the last killers you should play with, she is the hardest to learn since the mechanics of her are not visible, you have to learn the distances in the game fist, she is also the top tier on PC, but not on PS4, you can try one of the others who are easier to learn first, like the hillbilly, it's like riding a motorcycle, you don't know when to make the drift changes, but you feel it, so the nurse is the same, you won't know your distance travel until you can tell how far she will travel and how long to keep it pressed, and the direction you are going... it's just a bit too much for someone who is barely starting playing. 
---
I'm reguler fps games  and  ƒ± try it few killer, unlock few teachables but newer satisfied me and  try nurse and ƒ± love it.Because ƒ±'m  super agresion type player :S
---
Pretty much. All these perks are either way too situational or just bad. 
---
same but with billy
---
Still no freddy buff but hey, at least they're doing something.
---
Perma tier 1 with no terror radius or red stain. 
---
are you playing on PC or on PS4?
---
Some of your suggestions I think are good, but some seem a little too powerful.
---
Pc
---
?????????????????
---
If he has the mixtape, which most will have if they're playing Legion to win, he taps you twice, waits for a power recharge and will down you in the third hit. There is no "getting better" or "outplaying" a Legion in that situation. "Doesn't mean you can't dodge hits" 
---
????????????????
---
Im talking solely about the Deviousness change, which is Overall pretty useless. Community been asking for ages that bear traps will award points based on how long they stay on someones head, which is a much better change.
---
If you are not running VT you never use ambush anyway so you still not getting any deviousness. 
---
Which ones might I ask? 
---
The pretty good cosmetics salesman.
---
Blood warden is the least needing of a buff out of all these
---
Actually wait what am I on about, Fire up is op, needs nerfs
---
Why is body blocking toxic? I love body blockers. Free delicious hits that almost never benefit them. If they have d strike, I'll take 2 free hits for 1 down survivor. 
---
If body blocking Is that annoying to you...they have perks to counter them. 
---
Never said you can have 4 insta ones, but if you play your positioning well/run to a corner whenever you‚Äôre about to get downed,!you can almost guaranteed filling up enough of the wiggle bar. (Especially with the new PTB patch that moved a lot of hooks to the center iirc)
---
Just say you're salty and rank 15.
---
 Technician: All tiers reduce repair hearing distance by 8 meters up from 0/-4/-8.  so i am not getting something here or they just removed the "prevent explosions" part from the perk, aka the only reason to even use it?
---
I was shook
---
Both perks are very strong, yes. They also both have counter-play. Just adapt and put this tiresome discussion to rest, already.
---
What if I told you 
---
That noed rewards shit killers
---
Do you even English?
---
The killer tier list from that site reminds me of tyde‚Äôs tier list.... ew
---
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Why should the killer have to respect it? It takes literally no skill to unhook yourself. Just luck. 
---
And why should it be buffed? Dont be dumb trying to unhook yourself while the killer is still right there.
---
As for camping, freeing yourself is just stupid. Theyre gonna hit you immediately so wait for someone with bt to grab ya off or just wait it out so your team can do gens. Trying to unhook when theyre camping is just killing you faster, which screws your whole team
---
isnt technician being nerfed? its the same bonus from before but without the prevent explosion part, or i am not getting something here
---
Let me put it into survivor terms for you: Get good. 
---
Blood warden is just way too situational. The exit gates have to be open which sucks but I doesn‚Äôt need the buff as much as other perks. 
---
Also nerf Surveillance please it‚Äôs too powerful. 
---
My thoughts...
---
- Hiding killer perks. LONG overdue. Now Bloodwarden will be worth it.
---
- Vault changes. Guess this is due to survivors crying now stop. Meh, if it stops Billy from chainsawing me through windows then its ok I guess.
---
- Self- care. So its important to note that this change is a test and not final.
---
I fucking hate it lol  HUGE self-care buff, but screws over the rest of your team. Given how everyone takes SC and most people are selfish....yeah this is gonna be annoying. 
---
I liked the healing changes the past few months. It had everyone healing each other and working together.
---
Wont this just make it the same time to self-care as it would be to be healed by someone with self-care? That sounds stupid and takes away the team aspect.
---
They've been bonkers with healing. I don't think they ever needed to do anything with it in the first place. IIRC correctly it was about slowing down the game, but that was not what was needed to do so, and now repair speeds are getting buffed. Insane.
---
Reddit Killer btw.
---
you‚Äôre bad lol
---
Dodging hits against a killer that has no attack cooldown AYAYA GOOD ONE
---
dont know, but maybe that .1sec will prevent from being hit after i am already at the other side of the window either that or dedicated servers will fix that
---
I mean, if you say so. 
---
Yes
---
I think that part of the perk stays the same, they just added the -8m hearing distance to all tiers so it‚Äôs a small buff.
---
Little man
---
Then don't play how they want. Simple stuff. Take control of the game, and if that's too hard for you, than Killer may not be your forte. 
---
I have been DS'd using every Killer (except Legion cause I don't play him as I find him boring AF) and 9/10 times I down them about 10 seconds after they get off. Spacial awareness is thing ya know, and most of the time, if you are near a "mega loop" there is a handy hook nearby. Only time there usually ISN'T a hook nearby is in open areas, which also means no "mega loop" for them as well. 
---
Notice how DS is a one time use perk? Also, even without Enduring, its only a 5 second stun. 5 SECONDS. Cool, now it takes an extra 15 seconds to down them instead of the 10 you'd have with Enduring. Big whoop. 
---
Bruh, BBQ is one of the best Killer perks in the game for a reason. And using your "reasoning"... "Plus notice how you need a perk to counter" BBQ? As for your "Hide in lockers/behind gens/you can just be within the 40 meters..." Well guess what? You can also just leave the DS guy on the ground like Tru3 or just take the DS and move on. Just gave ya perkless "counters" to DS free of charge. 
---
Dude, I personally play both sides, but I am more so on the Killer side because I enjoy it a little more than Survivor and I am confident in saying Killers are NOT getting the "raw deal". Espeically not after the NOED buff, blanket exhaustion nerf, and the Self-Care nerf. If anything, Survivors have been getting the "raw deal" lately, but they needed a slight adjustment anyway, so now the tables are pretty even between Killer and Surivor in terms of "balance." 
---
Reddit killer btw.
---
oml I‚Äôm actually sorry I didn‚Äôt know, someone on instagram sent it to me (if I could I would give you their @ because I believe they posted it with no credit) 
---
I think thana percentages are a little too high. 9/12/15/18 are more moderate
---
Beast of prey should just be a longer timer not unlimited until you hit.
---
Blood warden, if you get the ability to have it proc whenever then the timer should be like 30-40 seconds. The perk is situational but being able to hook earlier and the timer doesnt start is a pretty huge buff for that perk. So last gen pops hook someone then just go patrol gates and whichever is open you have 60 seconds seems too much. That along with noed would give you the game on a platter. It should be a challenge and I think that kinda takes the challenge out of it.
---
Thank you devs
---
Ambush is now usable in Loops pretty much all the time now that Combat Straps aren't a necessity, the change is fine.
---
&gt; If you are not running VT you never use ambush anyway so you still not getting any deviousness.
---
Maybe I play her differently, but ambush IS useful without VT.
---
From the assertions that I read it's apparently sticking around a gen once a killer has kicked it? I always thought it was silly so I never really commented on it. It came across as newbie killers not time managing well, because by that logic the last gen could just never be done if the killer's recently kicked it or something.
---
It was such a weird complaint to see, I immediately remembered it when I saw this post, actually.
---
This happens every time I run NOED on Legion tbh
---
Did you get the perks you wanted on another character before you started prestiging Laurie or did you suffer with less and/or bad perks? 
---
Sucks for us solo players though. I wish they'd make a change so it doesn't affect those who queue solo. But if I know these devs correctly with their spaghetti code that will never happen.
---
Legion &lt;3
---
I got right in sooo idk im on ps4 as well. 
---
If they‚Äôre SWF and have 3 people all body blocking you, lots of times the survivor can get off the hook even without d strike.
---
What perk are you talking about.... what, iron grasp? Either way, great. So I can use a perk that affects one of the few games where you have a SWF 3 man body blacking group. Might as well run slippery meat on survivor just in case there‚Äôs a trapper too. 
---
I wanna prestige for the achievement. Thx ill try. 
---
this change might push autodidact into the spotlight, slower heals means more skill checks which means more tokens
---
You can dribble d strike as well. Countering noed can require a lot of time. Extra time every killer gets even without noed bc the survs never know if he has it or not. 
---
Dude, if a legion is committed to chasing you, you will go down. It‚Äôs not a question of surviving as they will get you unless they are complete garbage. 360‚Äôs are not reliable enough if that‚Äôs what you mean by dodges and if they are running franks mixtape then you will go down in 2 frenzies or around 35-40 seconds without fail. 
---
Have you even played against a legion before? There‚Äôs a reason they are so hated right now and it‚Äôs not just that they aren‚Äôt top tier.
---
&gt;"No attack cooldown."
---
&gt;Feral frenzy has to recharge.
---
&gt;Feral frenzy isn't always active.
---
Johnny Johnny.... 
---
Freddy + Swing Chains + Remember Me.
---
I watched a Kate open a door for 2 minutes once.
---
I wonder what Prove thyself, all 4 with leader and wake up do to gate opening?
---
because wake up is 15%, leader is 9% per person (27% total), and prove thyself is 9% personally.
---
every 5% is one second off the 20 second opening timer.
---
the total effects off all three perks are 51% which is basically the old exit gate time.
---
9.8 seconds.
---
I don't know if this actually works I tried something like this once in a public match instead of private testing, and one of my teammates died early and the killer had blood warden.
---
I doubt he‚Äôs ever even played killer let alone legion lol
---
Right now im getting all the teachables I want, but when im done I dont wanna prestige my main and play with shit perks. Maybe its worth it instead of getting all good perks on one character and then start prestige. 
---
Interesting drawback - will still run it though. I end up healing myself way more often than others. It wont stop me from healing teammates. I assume tier 3 is 25% which isnt terrible compared to how long it took to self care before...
---
Still nothing for console issues...not that it would be on the PTB I guess...
---
Never? High tier Pigs use the ambush all the time. You can mind game lots of loops other killers can't by crouching at the pallet and faking the direction of your dash.
---
Nothing cheesing about that. I'm just giving you a taste of your own medicin
---
I SWF'd with 4 Americans the other day (I'm in Europe) and while most lobby ping was either yellow or red, as long as they were stable, I had no issues with lag whatsoever.
---
Because you're following the blood instead of playing as intended and you think that's "success."
---
&gt; HUGE self-care buff, but screws over the rest of your team
---
The meta is going to change to essentially how it was before the original healing changes where everyone ran self-care, but it's going to be even worse, and coupled with the gen repair buffs, that fucking blows. Devs sped up the game considerably 
---
I suffered through it. I was lucky with Laurie. I got all "my" perks rather quickly. The best time to do it was last week during the blood point event.  I really wish they would have more of those. It helps new players more and this game needs new players on consoles. 
---
I guess it's an added benefit, other than its old function
---
I‚Äôm not as I have no perks on legion
---
Who is the most enjoyable killer to play as while still being decently strong? I‚Äôm new and looking to purchase a killer.
---
Of course I've played against a Legion before. That's why I'm wondering why you're all having such a hard time. 
---
The main Objective is to Live, not amateur gen Mechanic sim.
---
also my friend sent it to me from an account called toxic.nea I have no clue if that is you and I‚Äôm really sorry 
---
If a survivor triggers a trap after I rescue them when they see me clearly crouching AND they would have seen where the trap was placed then I NEVER rescue them again. 
---
Happy happy oink
---
You are playing against bad survivors then. Baseline ambush is too slow and give plenty of reaction time. 
---
When counter looping with it, survivors will have enough time to get away from it or simply not fall for your mind game (incase you 180 ambush) 
---
 Outside of loops you are better uncrouching and hitting them normally because its faster, quieter, doesnt have TR and you can try some cheeky grabs off gens.
---
No joke about hiding killer perks, thats a good 2 years over due LOL
---
the vault changes I feel is good, some hits, especially with lag were pretty bad. My Billy saw has amazing reach, never once did it amaze me when i hit someone thru a vault when I thought 100% they got away.  
---
Jury is still out on self care, but if you look at it one way. It is self care, not heal others...so maybe it should only slow down healing others if you have it equiped?
---
i used to like using urban evasion bc i could go round shorter structures without being seen, but now that ive seen how many ppl use it to just.. not do anything the entite game......
---
Yeah I liked everyone working together with heals. Now there's no point, you're no worse off healing yourself. Almost everyone seems to run SC so expect it.
---
Its also just undone the healing changes they made.
---
Before you had 16-20 second heals depending on sloppy, and 32-40 second self-heals.
---
Now its (if everyone has SC) 20-25 second heals no matter what....if im working this out right.
---
Which means nobody is at a drawback for self-caring and nobody gains an advantage from working together.
---
I play an aggressive survivor and have made it to rank 1 each season.  It makes me so mad when I go straight to work on a gen and a teammate just crouches right by me and doesnt help.  Its like wtf are you even doing then? 
---
If you say so. 
---
Just because most people don‚Äôt opt to play that way doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist
---
I swear these patch notes read like riddles in some sections. If I understand it correctly, you won‚Äôt be able to see if the killer has a mori along with their perks? 
---
The thing I like most about dbd is the matches are not too long. Making gens longer to fix or increasing healing time makes it so boring. I still see players healing vs legion and it‚Äôs just annoying. 
---
To be fair the third seal is a steaming pile of shit against any player with decent map knowledge and those that pay attention.
---
With VT, sure. Without it its way more unreliable. 
---
I thought it was an addition to the old effect, which wasn't that great to begin with to be honest.
---
Video please?
---
This is bait, lol. 
---
Not going to disagree with you there, but when it works I find it hilarious.
---
Ugh I dunno, I have no issues hitting them on PC or on PS4, yes PS4 with its lovely fps.  Its all timing based, and easy to learn...unless you get a lag spike, then you are screwed either way
---
As a pig main im screaming like a little girl, god im so happy
---
No we seen lots of pink hair nea. We need to see blue haired nea!
---
Well, to be fair, a lot of people in this game are out for themselves and only their enjoyment. This is a problem on both sides, not just killer. It's ESPECIALLY BAD against red ranks on console with survivors, but it usually starts around rank eight or so for PC. It's less shit that's said in post-game and more things that happen during the game.
---
Example being: Was watching a friend of mine stream while I was sick over the holidays. She wanted to reach rank 1 by new years which was an easier task for her at the time as I recall she was rank.... five when she decided this. 
---
Rank 2 game, though, all she needs is two pips [IIRC] to get to one. She gets into a game with a Nea, a Claudette and a Jake. Nea leads the killer to her, Nea gets her off the hook. Friend runs to the basement to try and find a medkit to heal with because that Nea fucked off. Lo and behold, Nea comes back with the killer, points her out to the killer, and is downed. Friend is downed, they have a basement party. No one wins.
---
Now this is just one example of bullshit that survivors do to other survivors, but it's happened to me too.
---
Good time to start running leader I guess? 
---
Body blocker hag all you need is the scratched hand addon and pair it with either the waterlogged shoe or the turtle egg you can‚Äôt teleport to your traps but they have collision so they can cut off windows pallets and loops very fun 
---
&gt; Legion has questionable design choices for sure, but he can be fixed. And if you seriously think that Nurse, who ignores every single Survival mechanic in the game, is better designed than Legion, then I don't know what to say.
---
Well, atleast I have fun trying to learn Nurse and get better with her, and it actually feels somewhat satisfying. Legion, on the other hand... I stand by my opinion, and honestly, if Nurse was a worse desgined killer than Legion, she wouldn't have survived p much untouched (not really, 1.9.x actually buffed her) like 2 years in the game, while Legion was released like a month ago and eveyone is DCing against him and saying he (they actually, whatever) is their most hated killer. Is Nurse stronger, more broken than Legion? Absolutely. Is she in general more fun to go against/ to play as? Imo, yes.
---
Super cute!
---
I start the trial blinking close to gens but not directly to them, listening for progress and checking the obvious hiding spots.  Blinking around until I find someone I'll usually want to try to get the first hook as soon as possible then start getting hits on survivors using bbq to find my next target.  I will go for the farthest survivor if they are working a gen or close to one.  Down them if possible but dont waste too much time chasing.  Run nurses for finding them as they start to heal and get them down from there.  Wear good headphones so you can hear which direction they take off after a hit and keep applying pressure to the survivors working on gens.  If you can have one on the hook, and one in chase for most of the match you should be good.  I go for max hooks on nurse so I'll try and hook each survivor at least twice and I dont camp hooks to encourage saves. 
---
I end up with around 50k bpts with bbq and black pip even if all 4 escape.  Hope some of this helps. 
---
Great changes!
---
&gt; have no perks on Legion 
---
...do killers not have their teachable perks from the start anymore?
---
Because only survivors get a free pass to be toxic.
---
They just didn't mention the no explosion part, I'm sure it's still a part of the perk.
---
That being said, this is not really a buff, since Tier 3 doesn't change at all.
---
Who gives a shit? Survivors aren't just gonna run in a straight line to their deaths, they're gonna try to actually get away.
---
None of the tracker perks** I don‚Äôt play as intended but I don‚Äôt use that scummy bloodtracking tactic
---
Petition to rename this perk to Selfish-Care
---
&gt; 4 survivors bring toolboxes
---
&gt; gen rush doesn't exist
---
&gt; You are playing against bad survivors then.
---
Most of the player base is bad (on both sides), just because there can't be too many good ones :)
---
I still haven't managed to find the exact game this is from :( I know its from the 50 escape marathon... but thats vague.
---
Good legions play with their ears and can hear when you do this, they also have eyes... if they don‚Äôt see you running the loop they will go back through the window. 
---
This only works against brand new killers who don‚Äôt rely on sound at all and even then that‚Äôs the most overused ‚Äújuke‚Äù against legion and every legion will learn to counter it after one or two matches as the killer. 
---
Care to provide something substantial and not wrong?
---
He in there, he just smol.
---
So the correct play now is to just not run self care and be altruistic with your teammates, potentially with the new Leader.
---
Immersed Claudettes crying rn
---
I felt this. When I first started playing I didn‚Äôt know Noed existed so I was being toxic to this trapper and noed hit me at the exit and I was so salty and confused 
---
You're probably joking, but for anyone not aware the actual issue is that it's bugged and only co-op healing counts. You only get progress when you and another survivor are both healing a third survivor.
---
Given that co-op healing only takes 8 seconds, you have to co-op heal 23 survivors to complete this daily. Yikes!
---
It sure as hell is now. Is this real? Did it finally happen?
---
Wow  no word about further optimisation. It seems I have to stay pessimistic. 
---
It's more consistent with other killers and she already has an ability to get close to survivors without being noticed.
---
Yeah I just thought I‚Äôd clarify bc honestly with this community I never know if someone‚Äôs sarcasm is in good or bad intentions. 
---
Why is it frustrating for solo? You gain nothing by knowing their perks, and you can just wait if you‚Äôre that curious 
---
Agitation is a great perk. More likely to get basement hooks. Quickly get hooks done, chase survs and down them as you carry another us always hilarious... comparing it to slippery meat is ridiculous. 
---
And ya, I rarely, rarely ever get body blocked to the point where I lose the surv. Check your surroundings first. If they get a wiggle off, hats to them bc it rarely happens. If this is consistently a problem for you then apparently you need to take agi, ig or that new legion perk. If it's not, then why are you acting like it's not fair? 
---
got ya fam https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MvbUqOVJic

---
idk if u wanted the actual stream or nah
---
Until everyone has either died or escaped. Can't see them until post game.
---
Sweeeeet!
---
you said it yourself, that has nothing to do with the PTB
---
Im gonna say the same as with most discussions here, you should just ignore some of those comments. They dont represent the entire survivor or killer camp, whether its a discussion about DS, NOED or anything really. Personally I dont care for NOED, if I would care I would do all the totems. But A, thats a huge waste of time, unlike some people who claim in this thread its done within a minute or every survivor cleanses one and then only 1 more is left thus only wasting 12 seconds. Thats not how the average survivor game works, so many people including me play solo, it would take way more time to run the whole map hunting every totem. And B, I dont mind that killers run NOED. If im the one going down ill accept my fate that ill die and in return the remaining survivors are warned and can choose to escape or hunt the totem and make a play. Every perk is part of the game, whether you like a perk or not. Same applies to DS, if I were to believe every comment here people run 3 DS per game and always go down near a loop and run the killer for an extra 2 minutes. On average I see less than 1 DS per game and 8/10 times that person goes down within 15 seconds. This is not some MMORPG where you permanently lose stuff, just move on to the next game, how hard can it be. Its the same how some people assess win or loss in this game, be it survivor or killer. If I die as survivor with 25k points you damn right that was a gg in my book. If I get 0 or 1 kill with 25k points as killer thats a gg in my book. People should enjoy the game more instead of focusing on weird ideas of winning or losing or what is an ethical set of perks to run. Everything has a drawback. How many games have you had where noed, DS, adrenaline, blood warden was useless because it didnt come into play, either because the game was over before the gens finished or people escaped. In the end its up to you how to fill your perk slots, everyone knows so many perks ran end up not being used in a decent of game being a waste of a slot...
---
yeah get fucked people who play this game for fun with friends... yikes buddy lol. Swf keeps this game alive
---
Smol Billy is too smol for us. 
---
It depends on where in the us. In the Far East, you get only like 120 ping. But that's really far East. 
---
As a Legion/Pig main, this patch looks pretty good. Even some of the survivor changes look nice, and I don't have a problem with them as a killer main. 
---
More deviousness points. They were bugged for her before and it was nearly impossible to get 32k games.
---
The pig TR is probably just to make it more consistent. Either 32/24/16. Having it at 28 was kinda weird
---
FENG MIN OMG &lt;3
---
Personally, if I‚Äôm alone and die with 3 gens or so left, I just want to move on to another game. With this change, I won‚Äôt be able to see what perks the killer was using without staying until the end of the game which may take 10+ minutes. 
---
From what I'm reading you have to do a total of 3 minutes of co-op *healing another survivor* for it to actually advance.
---
That's why M&amp;A + Whispers is a popular pair.
---
Seems like a needless nerf tbh. Now you need more distance to crouch, which means walking slowly, which means less map pressure.
---
Its also a nerf to NC on her.
---
(the TR fade out change is great tho but im not sure if its enough to make up for it) 
---
Feng Min finally getting another skin! ‚ù§Ô∏è

---
Thanks, console player here 
---
Ty
---
Yeah I feel M&amp;A will be way more needed on her now to make sure you dont lose as much time crouching. 
---
I'd actually have to buy that 10 dollar pig skin.... what a shame it will NEVER HAPPEN.
---
It's a step in the right direction.
---
Have her trap values been adjusted? Where can I find these patch notes?
---
The weird thing is when I read the patch notes earlier, through a link in watching Morfs stream...in the notes was a 10% penalty to each survivor when multiple are working on a gen. Unless I‚Äôm blind, it appears to have been edited out now. 
---
If you're first to die? You won't see perks/offerings/add-ons. Only rank, name and blood points
---
I just don‚Äôt see why you would care what they were running. And usually you can tell what they‚Äôre running during the match. It‚Äôs only gonna matter for stuff like NOED, Blood Warden, Remember Me, shit like that. And you‚Äôre dead so it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway. It‚Äôs a fantastic change.
---
As someone who doesn't run self care, I love being punished for perks other survivors are running.
---
It's stupid. Why should I have to be healed slower for them to heal themselves faster?
---
Yes it is.
---
Really? Sucks for solo survivors, now we‚Äôre even more defenceless against being farmed. :/

---
Right there
---
Her other changes are basically:
---
faster crouch
---
Boxes spawn further away (this is a bit further down in the notes)
---
And her terror radius was increased (for some reason)
---
Thank god it was tier 3. 
---
yo.
---
Male streamers get just as much hate dummy, it's just rarely sexual because that doesn't bother men like it does women. Everyone gets shit online, not just girls. 
---
I knew it. 
---
Not bugged, just really low. It will still be impossible to 32k with her 
---
Seriously. I prefer playing solo but with all these changes, what‚Äôs the point. Just makes you want to crutch to swf more than ever. 
---
There's no reason this shouldn't have happened or be added.
---
That said it probably won't; BHVR just brushed aside complaints about the Legion's cosmetics during their last dev stream and I don't think there are enough of us who care to make them care.
---
Nope, just ambush aka useless
---
Yes, because no girl counts on that it's always accidental 
---
"Good legions play with their ears."
---
That's a valid point when the patches haven't got the sound fucked up. As someone who plays Legion, I can say that not all of my prescribed advice works perfectly unless you work perfectly. 
---
You seem really invested in being right about this, so I'm just gonna tell you that you're wrong, you're in need of some coaching, and that you can assert arguments without ad hominem slights.  From my rank 21 fingers to your rank 22 eyes. 
---
Didn‚Äôt see anything about it in the patch notes, but did the ‚Äòending insidious noise‚Äô go away yet when she dashes?
---
I was really excited for more Spirit cosmetics but I didn't expect a Yandere Spirit. Looks interesting but It's not really my favourite cosmetic. Looking forward to seeing a rendered version of it, it might change my mind certainly!
---
If they're healing themselves, the change makes it so it's faster now
---
I don't know a math for PTB, but on live build you can start crouching as soon as your Whispers lights up and by the time your heartbeat gone silent, you're still outside M&amp;A-3 TR.
---
If this still works with PTB changes, I'm kinda indifferent about TR changes.
---
Can we also get a fix for hex ruin always spawning in the same area for some maps? Knowing where something that is supposed to be hidden is kind of ruins the point of it and the perk itself... 
---
Isn't this like when killers camp and tunnel and mori cuz fuck it? 
---
Glorious! Maybe that's what the devs meant with the Nurse and Wraith having a "connection". They maybe went to the prom together?
---
Looks gorgeous and I am looking forward to seeing them rendered/ingame.
---
Thats why I always say it's not worth it to go out of your way to find dull totems, at least when playing solo. Just do the gens and try to note mentally where the totems might be.
---
You still gotta hit 4 times. Thats pretty uncommon in general more so without VT.
---
Most killers dont have that much of a hard time capping Deviousness even without the 2.5k from 4k, so thats not really accountable (guess it is if we talking about 32k games and not just 8k deviousness) 
---
Meh, playing around DS is often worse than just taking the hit and moving on.
---
And mori?
---
What do you do once they break the NOED?
---
Konoichiwa, spirit chan, Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
I‚Äôm actually very thoroughly pleased by these updates again. BHVR has improved a lot over time.
---
Birdbox my man, birdbox
---
I forgot about that
---
500 auric cell pack is 15.50 brl (brazilian real) on psn, I think the price is the same on steam even if steam has cheaper dlcs compared to psn (3-5brl cheaper)
---
Just adding mine to the chart. 
---
So....do they do the frick-a-doodle-dandy when they‚Äôre not in the trials? Are they off snuggling in the woods during campfire time? Is Wraith all like ‚ÄúSee you soon babeeee‚Äù? Does Nurse wheeze in bed? 
---
I need answers. The lore of this game is important to me.
---
Yeah thats very true!  I think the self care change is due to all killers running sloppy butcher now.  I dunno about you, but spending what seems like a minute healing is boring as hell.  I wonder if any killers will run Spies from the shadows. Cool change but ugh, I dont think the perk is worth running at all.
---
Finally the Schoolgirl Spirit we all needed. And those Wraith, Huntress and Nurse skins looks sweeet
---
Always my thought.
---
I think if they gave players more of a reason to dash it would be better because unless you actively try to get them it will be hard.
---
Honestly I know NOED can be a bitch, but the trade off of swf not being immune to certain perks by knowing the killer has them is much more worthy of a sacrifice to make.
---
Nurse‚Äôs hair looks an awful lot like that one for Meg and I love it
---
Probably to make up for having hook immunity and then a new buffed BT once you get unhooked. If a killer wants to punish a greedy unhook they have to 1.) let the unhooked guy literally go 2.) not get bodyblocked 3.) then deal with a buffed BT to down someone.  
---
This change makes it so its not buffed bt+unhook immunity+exhaustion perk
---
That Nurse lower face reveal though
---
Is this actually a change they‚Äôre making?
---
There from one of his videos were there works from shenpai he mad a video about it
---
Killer is the more demanding role and thus it rewards more bloodpoints, the killer is not competing with anyone else for kills, whereas the survivors are technically competing against each other for saves and gens if they want points. (What I mean by this is that because there are four of you, it is possible to do next to nothing and escape as a survivor if your teammates do the work. If you are constantly invested in the game by doing gens, making saves, buying time for your teammates by getting chased, etc, and you literally have a match with little to no downtime, then you will make like 25-30k. However, what usually happens when you don‚Äôt make that much is that you sat and did gens and played the m1 one game, or you literally got chased the entire game and the killer didn‚Äôt really do anything else because of that. The killer must do everything and be completely engaged for the entire match, as they have no one else to split up the work with, and thus generate high BP for every good match they have, and moderate BP in their okay or underperforming matches. 
---
If they were not given at least an okay amount of BP for not getting too many kills, then you would really only be motivated to play killer if you intended on winning, as that would give you more BP for your time spent. This would discourage me from playing killer in a friendly or easy going manner, and would definitely discourage me from taking mercy on anyone. Try hard killers that tunnel and try to win my any means necessary are no fun to go up against, trust me you don‚Äôt want all your match to go like that. 
---
A side note: survivor queue times are horrid right now anyways, plenty of people (me included) end up waiting like 10+ minutes or more when I try and play swf and even if I solo queue I‚Äôll still be waiting about 5. My queue times as a rank 1 killer (not staying rank for entitlement but bc the queue times there are significantly worse) last like 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes. The devs have stated before that a lack of killers has been a prominent issue from time to time. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if the recent game breaking update has convinced people who usually play killer to stop or go play survivor since they fucked the audio and some peoples frames are even worse.
---
It being????
---
No gen rushing does exist because if you‚Äôre actively ignoring the hooked survivor and only focusing on gens then that‚Äôs gen rushing.
---
FTFY
---
Huntress has a phat wardrobe 
---
You gotta find Ruin first. 
---
As long as they make it so you need base Joey or Susie to get there bloody clothing. 
---
For reals tho. SWF's playing hard having that one bit less knowledge on the killer is great! Some people on this thread don't realize how major this is for killer mains
---
Removed - Spam; datamined content is restricted to the Megathread
---
I dont think they really ban anyone, if they banned everyone who was toxic, there wouldnt be  playerbase lol
---
Thank you, those look pretty good (except for her TR increase, but that's whatever)!
---
Just a meme guys don't get too salty :P. Last time I made a ds meme I got downvoted to hell lmao.
---
Hopefully they don‚Äôt go that hard with Self Care, because I like the forcing altruism that the nerf gave. 
---
The nurse and wraith skin art seems to be a play on the Phantom of the Opera. 
---
The obsession was the 2nd to last to die, also :P  He was pretty stealthy, so that perk basically never went into effect.  Haven't had good luck with that perk so far.
---
It‚Äôs just a game relax
---
and the maximum is 6000 or 12000 auric cell pack?
---
I want to replicate this so bad
---
Hmmmmmmmmm. You're right, it's gone. It was definitely there before, I copied and pasted it for my comment... I wonder why?
---
I really don't understand how people can feel proud after chasing someone for 20 minutes. This amount of wasted time would be enough to fail 2 games and you finally got that survivor only because other was doing nothing. Thats not really a showcase of killer skills man
---
How is getting 3-4 kills or escaping with a pip indicative of skill? You're delusional I'm afraid :)
---
Yea that David perk. That needs to be changes to safe unhooks 
---
Yes, so if I am standing near you or running by with Leader and you're healing or opening a door, you'll get a 25% boost for up to 25 seconds. Repairing will stay at a max of 9% bonus. 
---
Yah I‚Äôm just tryna make it a little bit less of a mess when I can. 
---
P3 is shorthand for Prestige 3. You can chose to reset your character completely, once you hit level 50 on that character. Doing so will remove all items and perks, but will grant you one bloodied cosmetic item (first shirt, then pants, then face). Once you've gone through this 3 times, you will be a P3 Claudette, because you've prestiged 3 times.
---
The running joke (and fact) is that Claudette mains are usually very immersed and blend into the shadows more than any other character.
---
Ah thanks. I think I might have played noob3 at the BP-event. I had one nea called remove legion. And only saw that name once. Didn't bother to check since I didn't knew thats his name.
---
I just do it as soon as I get the option. Probably wrong of me to do, but I honestly don't care.
---
You could have farm unhooked the random since you were at full health, triggering a rehook and insta-death, then jumped for the hatch. 
---
But... It's pretty much common knowledge that you run to the hatch and crouch until you get hit AND THEN jump into the hatch so you don't get snatched. That was all you.
---
This entire game is in my head exclusively the creepy pasta from back then. There exists no other version of it.
---
It's a map addon survivors can use, they can leave a beam of light for other survivors to see, useful to marking important things for each other.
---
Right? Like way to be a good teammate... üëÄ 
---
Survivor main: WHAT U MEAN GET OF A GENERATOR??
---
Yes, yes it is.
---
Yes.
---
If you click the patch notes link here, it says it was edited! That had to be the edit. Also in the Miscellaneous section after the edit, there‚Äôs a note about fixing repair penalty on gens to the proper value. I‚Äôm wondering if it was just a fix to a penalty that already was supposed to have existed but was bugged? (And not a NEW penalty added)
---
yeah its just.... so frustrating. when youre getting chased for like 3 mins and no gens pop and you just know. your teammates are slowly crouching around the edge of the map to gens and hiding even at the slightest hint of the terror radius
---
As a killer player I love this. As a survivor that plays with my friends, my guessing/prediction skills will have to be sharper. Hypeeeeeeeee
---
Haha hopefully I helped you out then. Don‚Äôt worry the first person on the hook isn‚Äôt going anywhere trust me I learned that once I‚Äôm on the hook I‚Äôm kinda confined to that one spot lol. 
---
Except that it's a change to prevent swf from cheating if one of them get sacrificed.  Get fucked cheaters, does that sit better with you?
---
Lmao I‚Äôm living in 2049. 
---
omg that's crazy it's like 75‚Ç¨ D:
---
I assume you are either new to the game or this is an /s and a r/whooosh on my part.
---
That is a marker. A marker is a map add-on. You place the marker so teammates know where you are. You can use it for a variety of reasons. I use it mainly to find the hatch and mark it.
---
It's a map add-on that allows you to place a marker (that glowing light beam you see there) that your teammates can see. It's used to mark important locations like the hatch, exit gate, dropped item, etc.
---
Cool. Going to suck with survive with friends! That‚Äôs the whole point though. 
---
Correct. Its really fucking dumb. Sometimes killer can hit you mid air and you are downed again. Sometimes you can walk for 2 seconds, get hit and still have the immunity on you.
---
Such "punishment" for tunneling only would occur if you were using Swf or for some weird reason personally warning the remaining players via steam after dying. The first of which is effectively a nerf for swf parties and not solo queuers and the second nerfing something that is very rare. This is inherently not a problem.
---
On the other hand this inadvertently buffs Bloodwarden, Spirit Fury, Shroud of Separation, Save the Best for Last, Several Addons (Shape Kill addons, Doctor's Iridescent King, Amanda's Letter, etc), Iron Maiden, Haunted Ground, Remember Me, Devour Hope, Territorial Imperative, Lightborn, Nurse's Calling, Stridor, Bitter Murmur, Discordance, Dying Light, Insidious, Make Your Choice, and Whispers.
---
Perks that are usable and kinda fun vs randoms and near useless vs swf parties due to the prior system. 
---
Meaning that whining about this change is either you being much to invested in other people's fun playing swf or instead that you have your hand so far deep into the swf pot that you feel apt to complain about any motion to turn the pot's temperature up a single degree. 
---
Sounds like it'd be beneficial for the game to list if you were on a team or not then.
---
We're in the endgame now
---
D-Strike and Insta Med kits reward shit survivors. Goes both ways, and I hate it for both ways, even so, do totems.
---
I am just so happy for the pig changes. After 84 years. The sounds phew. The dwight buffs are interesting. Self care change is a choice.
---
how are they suppose to know "waving your arms" means dont get me? people have been  trying to get others to know this since launch is hasn't worked
---
He says dark souls is shit.
---
Yes its on the ptb.
---
Also Trapper thicc as fuck in this edit holy fuck
---
I mean, doesn't the afterpiece tonic just slow survivors down for a bit? So it can slow survivors enough for the hit, but you won't technically hit them when they're affected so it doesn't count.
---
A shard refund system could be abused. Imagine you buy a killer or survivor with shards and flood points into them for teachables and refund the purchase. If they limited refunds to cosmetics, it would be mostly unnessicary because the whole point of cosmetics is you have to be sure you want what you pay for and that‚Äôs why we have the are you sure final screen. 
---
Loves you to xD
---
Been seeing a lot of people saying this, the big thing though is that you waste two perk slots on that combo
---
Despite your obvious frustration, admit it, your adrenaline was pumping and you were on the edge of you seat the entire time. That's just one of the many things that makes DbD so fun dude. I know this game can make anyone wanna throw their keyboard/controller through the wall, but aren't most games like that? 
---
Do what you want, but I recommend taking a few days off of this game then coming back. Sometimes taking some time away is the best thing to do. 
---

---
Only if it means I get Brenda (yes I know she's not actually from the scream movies).
---
It‚Äôs so easy as a solo survivor. Unbelievably so.
---
It's better to just get DS out of the way then it is to juggle unless you're going to camp. Not giving me a taste. I don't do it.
---
As always gorgeous skins especially for nurse, huntress, feng and spirit :D
---
I also play both 
---
or you could just keep lobby dodging instead of improving your skill as a killer. 
---
i think the same thing people be really dumb sometimes
---
That's a little annoying. Like why not just have the auto banning not apply to those specific png's? doesn't seem that hard to do, but who knows
---
This place is pro killer so I wouldnt expect any of these people to see it from a survivors side. 
---
This is my favorite thing from this entire PTB stuff lol.
---
run self care to adapt then, you pretentious idiot
---
Why would I want to wait any given amount of time to see the killer's perks? That's a waste of time. Who doesn't want to see what the killer used? If that's the case, why show either side what was used? This comment makes no sense. 
---
You're right.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of satisfaction in Myers Hilbilly and Clown. All three feel really good to use and absolutely terrifying when played well. 
---
Legion with Franks mixtape 
---
I'm a big fan of Huntress. Her hatchets are incredibly satisfying to land, and she's decently strong. Also pallet mind games get way more intense because if you're charging a hatchet as they throw the pallet that's a free hit.
---
Spirit can also be fun. She moves fast with her power, can mindgame pallets well, and can get gen grabs.
---
fucking legendary
---
Tuesday or Thursday. 
---
Awww pig and Bing bong are so cute ^_^
---
What is the survivors side? Being able to cheat? 
---
I would take that as a win in my book.
---
How do survivors cheat? Bye. 
---
To my knowledge Botany Knowledge doesn't affect Self Care speed.
---
I think technically it's only 1000 if they get downed within 10 seconds, so if the killer is really close they won't get as much. Still, it's worth a lot and WGLF makes up for it.
---
Good spot. So it instead says: 
---
&gt; Fixed an issue with generator repair efficiency for multiple Survivors working on the same generator. The efficiency debuff (-10%) should now be applied at the correct rate.
---
So I think you‚Äôre right - this is a debuff to coordinated generator repair that was supposed to be applied previously but wasn‚Äôt. So coop gen repairs should now be slower? I hope someone is able to test it and confirm, I would but I don‚Äôt have the game on PC. 
---
A tale as old as time itself.
---
I agree! It baffles me why they don't let you play with the killer's perks equipped and nothing else
---
I mean like verbal abuse, not the legal toxic stuff
---
It does. 
---
It's mainly to stop SWFs calling out killer perks, ie killer has nurses, survivor dies early, tells everyone else the killer has nurses so they know to be careful healing, or killer has noed and they tell everyone to break dulls. Basically a nerf for SWF
---
I think it depends on the situation. I wiggle desperately if the killer is nearby. The thing is, there are times the killer leaves, even injures another survivor ( which should be a cue for the other mate to unhook me), yet no one proceeds to the rescue. Then i start getting nervous and wiggle a little to get their attention. 
---
It may not be the right thing to do, but it is frustrating to see another survivor not giving a shit and keep repairing 20 m away from me while im about to go phase 2 and there is an opening for rescue, so it seems like the only way to get attention.
---
While it does suck for solo players, I can see BHVR's reasoning being that a solo player could still send their teammate's messages.  The chances very slim, but the possibility is there.  As a survivor main, I'm all for killers getting this change.  Lord knows me and my SWF group abused this.
---
No, they'll never do this because it just means they have more numbers they need to balance and playstyle will be restricted with survivors instead of people playing their favorite survivor with whichever perks they want.
---
Happens 90% of the time I try an endgame build if I don't intentionally dick around.
---
Still love the last time I got salt for using NOED. "You only killed us because you had a crutch perk! Trash Killer!" Bitch, no. I could have had all of your asses 3 hooked with 4 gens still left, while basically perkless. I had to actively try *not* to kill you're slow incompetent asses for nearly 16 minutes so that I could get use out of my NOED, Remember Me, Blood Warden, and Rancor.
---
that is also true, unfortunately
---
I‚Äôve heard a lot of good things about Myers, I may have to pick him up. Thanks!
---
oof
---
I‚Äôve got huntress, I‚Äôll have to give her a shot, thanks for the help!
---
That's unfortunate. I believe it was the first thing I purchased in the Store.
---
inb4 post removed for not having smol billy or dbd-related content in the image
---
Really? Lmao killers can see what survs bring in and what character they are. Survs have killer specific perks and don‚Äôt even know to equip them because they can‚Äôt see the killer. When they remove that then maybe we can talk. 
---
"i'm gunna get'chu"
---
I love it.
---
I just want old tinkerer back. Insta saw and machine gun hatchets were so fun, even if it was a bit op it always gave me a rush when i played surv and was just fun to use as killer.
---
The chase music is too loud so you can't hear footsteps or breathing. I loved to play her before it came to that but now she's shit.
---
I mean unless the survivor you're tunneling is shit, or the rest of the team doesn't do gens, then tunneling is super suboptimal, as you're just leaving the other 3 survivors to do gens. I see plwnty of games at R1 where killers try tunneling a survivor who is half decent and run them through loops, and by the time that survivor is hooked twice or dead the gates are openes. Tunneling really isn't optimal at all unless the survivors are bad or rushing hook.
---
You honestly think that being able to see what the Killer has for perks, offerings and then tell the other teammates that isnt cheating?  Solo players cant do this so neither should SWF 
---
Easy there, they didn't target you personally. the meta game will be changing, we will adapt 
---
It's just a slight buff to levels 1 and 2 so it's always 8 meter reduction in noise 
---
Change your username to  basementface equip insidious and sit in the basement
---
Nea vs Nea, the ultimate sayan fight
---
I guess that's kinda the point. You want to be a teamplayer or you want to stay alone? I think it's interesting.
---
I dont think they ban anyone. You are further ahead to report them to Steam/Sony/Mircrosoft because they actually police their platforms. Ive seen other people posting that they got some action taken doing it that way.
---
IMO you should only Prestige in 2 scenarios, to get the skin for camo, or when it's pointless to put any more points into the bloodweb when you already have all the perks you want.
---
It's my favorite "hail Mary" in situations where I know another survivor is on their death hook. Either that or I'm in a position where I know I pipped, then I go killer hunting. 
---
Thank you, I also found [These](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SFxvlJ9ia-7sTJJcIOlf0ZpVH081DNac) By [Shenpia](http://pikaiscool.tumblr.com/)
---
I mean, if you want to use self care but still be altruistic, you can use Botany Knowledge with it. Or We will make it, it has a great action speed bonus
---
Shiiiit! Thanks! Prefer them haha
---
I‚Äôve thought about this but I feel like it‚Äôs better that people choose their survivor based on their appearance/back story and not about competitive advantages. Could be interesting though
---
I think the perks are pretty strong but you also basically reduce yourself to not running a fourth active perk for most of the game, so you handicap yourself until an event triggers that gives you a substantial power spike upon the triggering event.
---
     I find NOED to be a risk/reward perk, and that perhaps it should even be considered for becoming an obsession perk or something, allowing everyone but the obsession to be exposed, or at the very least giving the killer and survivors something to consider and plan around. 
---
    I can‚Äôt offer any exact solution but perhaps giving one player the opportunity to avoid becoming downed more easily and even boosting their stats in someway allows for trade off. As it stands NOED and DS offer counterplay, but really in many skillful ways. It feels like sometimes as killer you just have to tolerate someone who can reliably escape with that skill check, and with survivor, it feels like NOED makes the game woefully unbalanced for a killer who has underperformed. I think the key to balancing these perks is allowing for more intuitive and strategic counterplay from each side.
---
I'm not saying is a bad idea... but... the thing is that it would be too unbalanced, I used to play identityv, in that game some of the survors had powers like one could put a hex and teleport somewhere else, but with the visibility here and the way you can follow a survivor, it's just not good for this game. 
---
Very well could message my team when solo and give them heads up on your warden and noed. This solves nothing but giving a fuck you to swf. The killer can see who they‚Äôre playing against, what survs bring in, and can adjust accordingly. When survivors can‚Äôt get even a hint as to who they‚Äôre facing against when a good portion of the perks are killer specific. Like stop acting as if killers are abused babies. Players who main killer are just as rude. 
---
Yeah, and it‚Äôs fully updated
---
is it actually? :O
---
pls tell me ur not lying
---
This is getting downvoted, but I agree that matchmaking seems pretty broken on ps4 right now.  Since purchasing the game I‚Äôve never had to wait more than a few seconds for any match, but this week it‚Äôs often minutes and has put me with lower-connection killers than I‚Äôve ever seen it match before.  Have had multiple matches where the rubber banding was constant and unplayable.
---
Ah i was wondering why he ran to the pallet instead of hook rescuing, i see at the end of the video why now LOL 
---
Because then they'd have to go around and make a bunch of little exceptions for a ton of different things and frankly, that's not their job.
---
Why not just make GF an actual character? I don't think it would worth all the trouble and dealings just for a cosmetic.  
---
They can't get Jason because he already has his own game. They were also denied the Scream license, which is why Legion is why Legion is original content now.
---
imagine spine chill + Resilience + 3 new leader + new vault changes, it will be insane
---
Yeah he may walk like he‚Äôs constipated but trust me he moves at 115 movement speed, the same as Myers or hillbilly
---
Yes to all of the datamined cosmetics! 
---
Doing it on pc
---
In what way? So, you thought you were against 4-man SWF and found out you weren't... what benefits do you get from that info?
---
As someone who mostly solos, I agree and am certainly not going to want to wait to see everything. Instead of preventing solos from seeing it, why not do this - 
---
If survivors go in as SWF, upon dying, they skip right to the spectate screen and do not see the tally screen at all until their entire group has finished the match. 
---
Of course, sure, it isn‚Äôt NECESSARY for solos to see killer perks, but I know I like to either for inspiration for my own killer builds or even just to see what the community is running. When I get owned, I like to learn what they did. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
Does this look *dangerous* to you!?
---
Where is the original picture from
---
Map marker.
---
I‚Äôve never played against legion, so I don‚Äôt firsthand understand the complaints
---
*Getting*
---
I get that but to be real if your about to hit struggle I mean odds are you‚Äôre going right back on the hook anyways so you‚Äôre going to be struggling one way or the other and then forget it because once you‚Äôre off the hook a second time you have an instant target on your back. Also if you‚Äôre on the hook long enough to hit struggle on your first hook then that doesn‚Äôt apply to what I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm talking about when you have an instant where two hooks are relatively close to each other and the killer hooks survivor A then immediately hooks survivor B you shouldn‚Äôt be hitting within a 15-20 second span of unhooking survivor B first unless you‚Äôre trying to 4% which then that‚Äôs your own issue. 
---
Nope, we did not. A lot of fan art depicted her as blonde before this though.
---
There‚Äôs really no point  though because if they‚Äôre gonna make a bad save they‚Äôre gonna make that bad save regardless and they‚Äôre gonna make a good save they‚Äôll make the good save regardless. You not saving people because they‚Äôre wiggling isn‚Äôt going to do much of anything 
---
Yeah bro just spend half the match, of every match, running around being useless, not doing objectives and instead cleansing dull totems for the small chance they might have noed. EZ counter play boys, case closed.
---
1.Why nerf aspects of the pig like that? Nice to see they buffed the bloodpoints though.
---
2. Ah, finally, Dwight getting some love. Shame they nerfed the main thing that people use Leader for, gens, but this'll be a nice change. Prove Thyself is also FINALLY useful.
---
3. They've changed hex spawns? Finally. Maybe they'll be sneakier, I can finally use Ruin now.
---
4. Technician buff? That's nice.
---
5. Spies from the Shadows and Surveillance probably won't escape a top 5 worst perks list, but they probably won't be on any top 5 useless perks list anymore. Surveillance, the way it's written, even looks like a good tracking perk, perhaps surpassing Discordance in utility. Will work great at higher ranks with Overcharge, damned if you do damned if you don't style.
---
6. Blood Warden: Very good to have, but not a MASSIVE buff.
---
7. Legion buff. Small one, but this is a great way to make Legion a little less brain-dead and a more possibilities for tactical plays. Also punishes injured survivors.
---
8. They fixed the Indoor Spawns for generators! Finally.
---
9. The self-care change is...interesting. It makes Self-Care go from a must-have perk to a trade-off perk. Will people still use it? Yes. Will it be more useful? No. It forces people to take that Self-Care 3. Makes me regret not getting self-care to level 3 on some characters...I think it'll be interesting, making Autodidact and Botany more useful, while still keeping SC on the level it's at as self-help perk. I think this'll cause some controversy among a lot of survivors, though. At level 3 it's practically a built-in Sloppy effect from that survivor.
---
Well they should know and if they don‚Äòt then they probably will after they died due to me not rescuing then when they were wiggling.
---
I know it‚Äòs a shitty thing to do, especially for new players, but that is the only way that we can show them. Also i‚Äòd rather have no one save me than for my mate to run across the whole map just to unhook me right infront of the killer putting me into the struggle phase/killing me because the killer‚Äòll just hook me again.
---
What else am I gonna spend my BP on 
---
That's adorable
---
I love this feature. I always hated how they were seemingly stuck in time in the background. Now they move and it feels more alive!. Love how they‚Äôre giving survivors more life in general. Have you guys noticed that Jeff has animated eyebrows? It really adds more character to him with expressions.
---
You only need 2 people to get it
---
WHERE IS MY FREDDY REWORK?
---
Honestly, it should just reduce the healing received from allies... or increase the drain rate on medkits by 35/25/15%?
---
30 seconds? Even if that were true that's still nearly half a gen per survivor. So assuming all three survivors, without toolboxes, are on gens that's three gens that are half done after the ds is picked up + another 30 seconds to catch the ds after + 10 seconds to pick them up and hook them. Even if the killer makes it to one of the three in 10 seconds (Unlikely) that's still basically three gens completed for a single hook.
---
this is the best thing i've seen since Quentin came out
---
shame his perks are still garbage
---
I feel like Michael shouldn't have any. He's completely emotionless and his whole thing is stalking from afar while being utterly still.
---
Sorry if that came out like I was being a dick or rude or trying to start an argument with you I‚Äôm not. Just stating my opinion. 
---
it's just the same character all over the comic what does it mean?
---
Yea but that kind of forces everyone to run self-heal, which is super lame..
---
30 seconds is HUGE though what are you saying 
---
How do I live if I don‚Äôt mechanic sim?
---
So screw solo survivors right? Not their fault their teammates don't cleanse.
---
Same here. Tagteamed 3 gens in one game and didn‚Äôt see a second of increase. Threw that daily right into the trash.
---
It's fixed on the PTB. Just wait for the patch to come to console. 
---
Exactly - solos can‚Äôt do it but they shouldn‚Äôt be penalized just because SWF can. 
---
I honestly think it‚Äôs a fair change against SWF but it sucks for solos. Many solo survivors enjoy playing killer as well and like to see the builds they go against.
---
You got farmed before being hooked. Get over it
---
I know right? He is my favorite but everyone seems to hate him ;-;
---
Not to mention if the killer was already looped for 1 or even 2 gens before they got ds‚Äôd  now that‚Äôs more looping time unless the killer gives up on them but then they just gave away 1-2 for free
---
What do you mean the same character ?üòÇ Its pretty self explanatory , just read it right from left starting at the top 
---
You start the match injured and can't be healed but you can recover fully 
---
[there you go](https://youtu.be/ZK-C9J0ngk0)
---
dont listen to the haters
---
quentin main big brain
---
I love doc... doc is love... doc is lyfe......
---
Thats my point. Unless the ds is really bad 30 seconds is not the normal looping time.
---
Have they changed??...
---
I like the idea they should make the game like that could bring in some new players
---
I'd love more maps! And new survivors and new killers and new cosmetics... But you know... I've learned not to put my hopes and dreams on BHVR.
---
Kinda, but it means that Leader slows down gen rushes heavily, making it more team-focused than gen-focused.
---
I've been running Iron Will instead as well. I often signal people to do gens but they want to heal enough to just crouch spam for 10 seconds instead of being useful and then run away. It's frustrating at times.
---
whatever you need to tell yourself to feel better. 
---
‚ÄúWell they should about this thing that I just made up and if they don‚Äôt then they are bad players,‚Äù 
---
K. 
---
i'm really surprised that anyone actually likes mount ormond, or thinks that it's innovative. to me, it's just a snowy red forest/macmillan estate and nothing else. am i missing something with it?
---
Can you not find it on his youtube channel? If it's not there he probably deleted it. But his first ones where he bullies twice streamers and cowboy Jake were the three he uses jake the most.
---
But they nerfed over all healing. That's not enough. And over all this is a net loss for survivors. Blocking the killer perks, having a penalty for multiple players on gens, nerfing tech. Meanwhile, tons of buffs for killer perks. Plus auto surveillance for gens? The last time they released stats for the game it showed survivors made it out of the matches less often than they were killed (something like 40~% VS 60~% kills) and that was before all this "balancing" started. So many nerfs to pallets and survivor perks and items later the game has to be further off balance and we're all going to sit here and act like we don't already know this. 
---
I tried skimming through just about every one of them. I can't remember what cosmetics he has on jake in that video
---
Instant buy, would buy Aces too if had him
---
It's only easy until you mess it up and die
---
This is a screenshot from a video. [\#1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ylacjdu66j5tye/CuteDBDPack.rar?dl=0) Has everything up to Spirit. [\#2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SFxvlJ9ia-7sTJJcIOlf0ZpVH081DNac) has everything up to Legion.
---
this is litterly the first time i heard someone saying killers complain about looping and pallet camping (what is that even?)
---
A solo player can still tell the other players, I get chat invites all the time when I solo queue
---
Yea I was gonna say the you‚Äôre playing with some really lazy survivors but yea BT will bail you out. 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt get it. What aspect of this update is a fuck you to survivors? The change to exhaustion not resetting after being hooked sucks, but everything else seems fair to me. 
---
You mean you want it to heal completely in the time it takes for a killer to recover from a missed swing? Because it could in the past.
---
This sounds very pointed. 
---
I typically leave obsessions on the floor. Its as good as hooking them sometimes. 
---
Resilience and Spine Chill do not affect vault speed any longer. Is this the "fix" for Dead Hard? I'm disappointed.
---
The perk "buffs" don't come close to making up for this, either; another round of too few, too little.
---
It's a pain in the ass
---
Unless they changed it when they released the healing nerfs, SC is affected by BK
---
I see what you mean but what how about we nerf freddy and come out with some new Claudette outfits instead? Ya know just speaking rationally as a Dev.
---
&gt; /Probe Thyself
---
I know it gets lonely out there sometimes Dwight but uhh.....
---
But yeah, buffs to Prove Thyself might make it more worth running as it seemed pretty "meh" to run it currently, especially with Leader existing.
---
Time to level up my Dwight I suppose.
---
Survivors don‚Äôt need any buffs. Anything that buffs them makes SWF unbearable. 
---
I know solo survivor is hard but that‚Äôs just how it has to be.
---
What's up with the bright yellowish light that spawns sometimes in games all over the map randomly? It even has it's own audio cue when coming near it. 
---
Yeah, I've ignored Self Care post tier 1 since it didn't make a difference before. Now I'll actually need to get the rest.
---
Impatient survivors are the wooorst. When I'm hurt I always focus on the gen first *especially* to get the last gen done that is required for the hatch. 
---
The more I have thought about it, the more I like your airhorn idea. Good killers seem to rely on their hearing a lot - its one of the reasons I got better headphones when I started playing killer more. 
---
#CEASE.
---
Because Legion is basically just Ghostface. I feel like releasing Ghostface would give us another Hillbilly/Leatherface situation, so offical liscensed cosmetic would just be better.
---
I mean... it's not a movie. It's a game. The enjoyment of each is different with each
---
You play killer how you want. I don't believe in any made-up honor code. At the same time, however, I personally want everyone in the game to have fun... so I don't tunnel, I don't camp, and I don't try to taunt as killer. Because it's not threatening to the survivors... it's a game, not a horror movie to them. I'm just going to make them annoyed, which isn't the goal of either horror movies or games.
---
wheres the "pulled off a generator" one.
---
Event version: vuvuzela 
---
It was a normal thing back in 2016. I was used to it and I will also not get ppl when they are wigglling. 
---
It'll be a bit sad that Survivors who DC when they miss their Decisive Strike can't cry about OP crutch NOED on Reddit afterwards without sticking around to see the perks but I think that's a small price to pay for SWF being considerably less cancerous to deal with.
---
I clear them every match. I run small game. 
---
Wut
---
No then it‚Äôs still easy you just missed it, which happens of course because ya know humans
---
Is here nobody who understands, that there is also the possibility of a difference between short wiggle and long wiggle? 
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
Whatsso cool about bill on the ptb?
---
not a fan of mori's, instead after the second hook, a killer should be able to outright kill someone
---
Nice, thanks.
---
Fraklin stop the fugde flashlight add u slot 
---
I've had people blind me from behind before, but other than that I agree they're fine since instablinds are gone.
---
And they say this game isn't scary.
---
He's cosplaying a dweeb that forgot to cut the tag from his sleeve. 
---
Blocking the killer‚Äôs perks isn‚Äôt a nerf, it‚Äôs removing an unfair advantage. And I might be wrong but I don‚Äôt think Technician was nerfed, it was actually buffed for tier 1 and 2, tier 3 remains the same. 
---
You might be right about Surveillance, I can‚Äôt play the PTB so I don‚Äôt know how it works now but it may turn out to be too strong, in which case fair enough. Something needed doing to it though because it was literally useless before.
---
Been really mad at this
---
I agree, I have said this before and i'll say it again, The Team who does the maps and develops new maps need to be increased in numbers AND they also need to get more creative.
---
Ormond Resort should have had actual snow, that left footprints.
---
Oh, my frame rate didn't go down when that happens...
---
Its so swf cant take advantage of one dying and telling killers perks/addons to the others.
---
What's it called when the wraith goes invisible and stands next to the hook the whole game? Or a crouched pig or insidious leatherface? What would you call it if not camping?
---
I use NOED and i kill them all before the last gen pops. I take NOED off and the fifth gen pops before my game loads in
---
üòÇ
---
Relatable
---
Sweet, extra 5 seconds of my totem before its destroyed!
---
Any Meg cosmetics that are not garbage?
---
Well you just gave 3 examples of perks that were made terrible by playing against SWF. This change will allow for more perk diversity for killers. 
---
No problem, follow me üòÅüëåüèº
---
Using 25% of my perks to one of the survivors 20 tools (16 perks and 4 items) is never a good recommendation
---
Because SWF is a thing. You kill one and they tell their friends exactly what you have and suddenly a bunch of perks are worthless.
---
It's big real, big boy
---
In my experience, there is a lot less DCing than what a lot of others in the sub have experienced... idk if it's due to rank, killer, region, etc... but it's still pretty noticeable. I probably get at the very least one DC per 10 matches... maybe more if I'm playing Doc.
---
Totems are always going to be kinda rng, no amount of changes are going to change that
---
I was typing something similar, but you already said my thoughts pretty well. 
---
I'm not actually a killer, I'm a grown ass woman (I also use this reason for why I don't "teabag" as a survivor - "I'm a grownass woman with a job and health insurance!) I try to out play the survivors, but I also try to play in a way that we're all having fun.
---
Whats ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù here?
---
Enjoy being blinded literally everytime you destroy a pallet or try to pick someone up then. If you are 3/4 flashlights in the lobby it's bassicly guaranteed to be a like that.
---
Now this is epic!
---
Blocking the killer's perks is a buff to Noed and a nerf to SWF which is one of the only things keeping this game alive. Solo players exist more on console than PC and console is dying from the lack of optimization. And for everyone crying about SWF, having friends isnt an unfair advantage you should try it sometime. 
---
As a console player I am slightly jealous of all the customization pc players can do to their game, but isn't that technically bannable? Seems risky for some pretty colors, but you do you.
---
Impatient survivors trying to heal me are the worst. Sometimes people try to heal ASAP when the killer had NOED or a chainsaw, and I need to be able to use my Dead Hard. Being healed defeats the purpose. 
---
Gueass hit one covers thay
---
F
---
Well at least they wont be sleeping
---
Yea here‚Äôs my guide...
---
Just play Hillbilly.
---
Given the potatoes I consistently play with I would much rather use 2 slots and not alert the Killer to my location than have someone else stab me three times.
---
Alternately, I was also thinking this for the Rescue Perk:  
---
Gain 150% movement speed for 3 seconds when within 36 metres of a hooked survivor if not exhausted.   
---
it is still part of the perk, i just missed a skill check (on purpose ofc) BUT the sound-reduction is bugged anyway so who knows.
---
No they haven't. That's why they asked the Devs to redo them. They're pretty basic compared to the newer killers' animations.
---
Except now swf are gonna look even harder since they cant see your perks and will always have to assume you have NOED.
---
Its a game, its cool to not be a total dick to the other players. 
---
AH!! This is so good! I'm using it to make my phone a new wallpaper. 
---
Yes. All of this. 
---
I guess the fact the they escaped?
---
No way. I think the Spies from Shadows buff will make it a lot better. If I miss seeing a survivor and move away and they run the opposite direction, I'll get a notif and be able to follow scratches
---
It use to be so much worse, it use to turn the whole screen white, blinded in game and in real life!
---
It‚Äôs up to you, but some of us just want to play a fun video game with a glass of rum after work, not be tortured. 
---
To be fair it's similar to Iron Grasp vs Agitation. Agitation is a teachable and is strictly better than the non-teachable Iron Grasp. Same goes for the teachable Deliverance vs Slippery Meat
---
You are in the minority. Games are way too fast, currently.
---
Is this David?
---
Before it was 100% 
---
LMAO XD
---
Billy is better is every way, so id just play billy. Leatherface is good for facecamping and thats about it
---
Running Botany Knowledge and Empathy rather than Self Care + Whatever is now even more preferred. 
---
Nope, no new Meg cosmetics.
---
I love how he jerks awake and it looks like Kate is singing to herself and tapping a beat.
---
Just use no mither
---
&gt;Unless I‚Äôm blind, it appears to have been edited out now. 
---
No, it is still there under Miscellaneous
---
"Fixed an issue with generator repair efficiency for multiple Survivors working on the same generator. The efficiency debuff (-10%) should now be applied at the correct rate."
---
All of the survivors have unique animations on the main menu now.
---
He got a perfect game as survivor.
---
I mean, I got my achievement doing that sooooo, if you say so.
---
Trick question, im a console player and bill doesnt exist! Ha
---
You don't do one thing the entire match. 
---
And it got nerfed for a reason
---
This has to be satire right, there is no way you actually act like a 12 year old over a game? 
---
Hilarious footage though
---
Most people do it because it's better for you to get tunneled but have a second chance. 
---
Letting you marinate on the hook to 50% and not having another opportunity sucks. Also a killer is likely to patrol two hooked survivors. 
---
When a killer picks up and hooks that 2nd guy that is your best time to be rescued imo. I say this. Not to you personally but in general: don't fuck up so that a killer downs two survivors quickly, like in 10 seconds. Try and not make silly mistakes that can cause a snowball effect for the rest of the game
---
It's too bad now. It should be nerfed to 50%
---
It was normal when there were fewer people... since then, the game has gotten a lot of new players, many who made up their own lingo.
---
Now about 1/3 think that wiggling means "stay away!" 1/3 think wiggling means "Get me now!" and 1/3 think wiggling is taunting/annoying/distracting the killer or just something to do for fun. So I don't assume anything when they wiggle... I just scout the area myself to see if there's a killer. :)
---
It's kind of ridiculous, OP, to just assume that A) everyone knows the OLD usage of wiggling on the hook, and B) should just follow along with your usage just because you... what?... mandated it? On a subreddit that maybe 10-20% of the playerbase bothers to use?
---
Lol I have friends, they just don‚Äôt play video games, but thanks for that. Playing with your friends is one thing and I think it‚Äôs good for the game overall, but knowing every detail of a killer‚Äôs build is an unfair advantage any way you look at it. You still have every other benefit of a communicating squad. 
---
Yeah.. pretty much. Then I start actually trying, blink directly on them to force dead hard then down them with the second blink every encounter after that.
---
[Sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhPtRA7zieE)
---
Really? Do tell!
---
Because the game doesn't presently track SWF post lobby formation. Maybe once the Dedicated Servers Update hits, we'll get something like that, but it's just not in the engine right now.
---
Ever play the mobile game called Identity V? Its DbD on mobile (there are many mechanical changes to distinguish it from DbD), but with survivors that come with abilities and drawbacks to balance out having those abilities. A consequence of this is that survivors are now classified into roles: looper, repairer, rescuer, etc. Which has lead to a tier list of sorts...but I don't really pay much attention to it when picking a survivor. 
---
For some reason, playing dbd isn't the first thing that come in my mind when I'm high. Seems good tho üëå
---
It does kinda seem like what they‚Äôre doing is disguising survivor nerfs by buffing some perks, but the buffs are just offsetting added penalties so in reality it‚Äôs a net loss. 
---
"Everyone"
---
ooh this sounds fun
---
Are you talking about the "haha-yeah boi"?
---
[Still no unmasked Susie cosmetic](https://i.imgur.com/Ptbw9yH.jpg)
---
No. Like hehehehehehehehehehehe
---
Survivors complain about that kind of stuff all the time, but in a game where it's 4v1 and the killer is fairly underpowered, how are you supposed to do *anything* without a hook strategy?
---
What many survivors would say is that you were supposed to leave the basement and let them escape, but... that's just letting them win.
---
I think ya mean buff. It definitely could use a little help but definitely not instant 50%
---
By that logic, SWF deserved to be "nerfed" in that way. SWF shouldn't know any more information about what the killer is running than anyone else, even after someone died.
---
Also, saying people don't like SWF because it's about playing with your friends is an extremely laughable attempt at distraction from the real problem: voice comms. Blocking the killer's build from being seen by survivors until the entire match is done stops SWF from being able to relay what build the killer is running to their friends over voice comms. It has absolutely zero to do with playing with friends.
---
&gt; I personally think it‚Äôs unfair that they recently nerfed the lockers so now when I hide in a locker after my BT runs out I fall right out and make the most damn noise . I used to hide in there down until a survivor came to help me I can‚Äôt even do that anymore .
---
is this satire?
---
"it's so unfair that my exploit was removed"
---
i also love how you just ignore that BT got a buff and killer aura reading got a nerf
---
I think the devs  just recently got back from their holiday vacation! 
---
And they say that the killer is the scariest part of the movies.
---
Step 1: Down somebody
---
Step 2: Put them in the basement and camp
---
Step 3:???????
---
Step 4: Profit. 
---
No... don't go... please... -_-
---
Yeah, exactly. It‚Äôs definitely not a priority, but if they get to a decent place where they can work on such things, it would be nice
---
No I meant nerf from 100%
---
What exactly does it mean when people say a character is ‚ÄúImmersed?‚Äù
---
Nah someone told me it was minutes and it seemed reasonably believable 
---
MY two favourite killers in the game are Myers and Clown. They are both on the higher end of mid tier imo, so they can definitely be strong if played correctly. 
---
And in the case of Myers, he has a ton of fun builds you can try out, so he almost never gets boring.
---
Escaping is fucking easy
---
getting a score like that? monumental achievement 
---
I'm sorry I meant in game not over all. I dont assume players of this game are friendless but rather that they don't have friends on dbd per say. So for that I apologize. But really if you're having a great game you and your friends dont die so nobody sees the perks someone dieing and seeing the killer's perks doesn't turn the tide as much as you think it just helps with Noed or blood warden which are BS perks. If the game has gotten far enough for those to trigger then those kills aren't earned they were gifted by the devs. 
---
Hmmmm, not entirely sure whether the free add-on slot for piggy is worth the extra terror radius and quicker fade in (which I assume will make grabs very difficult now?). Guess we'll see!
---
No you don't. You still get a shard for roughly 14 exp no matter what level you are. 
---
I actually find hes okay to win with if you dont use chainsaw, hes just like a trapless trapper. the chainsaw seems to make him super slow for ages
---
But if the killer gets gen rushed, what does that say about them that they have to run NOED?
---
Yeah the wording is word.
---
I think this time The Killers are supposed to destroy the vessels instead of putting survivors on hooks? Maybe that's why its worded like this.
---
They‚Äôre too busy adding diverse white survivors.
---
Says killers complain too much, complains as survivor.
---
I once ran a Blood Warden, NOED, Remember Me, and Devour Hope build because I wanted to derank.
---
I got a 4k with 4 gens still standing. I was disappointed.
---
Yeah. Some only one, but most have 2
---
bloodwarden will actually be useful against SWF now 
---
lmao git gud, nerd
---
Spinr chill and leader do not effect vault speed
---
Do you play pig ? Just curious? 
---
exactly 
---
Honestly ace looks like a fucking DADDY in the banner art. 
---
Does the Huntress refresh her hatchets when she opens a locker and finds somebody inside?
---
It‚Äòs the best I can do
---
If you have a swf group in call and still think noed is powerful lmao
---
Again however, as soon as the second survivor is hooked he darts right back. Odds are your not getting close to 50% in an extra 10 seconds it would take to bring him back to hook 2 especially if you have to competent survivors not hooked. I totally agree I generally don‚Äôt look for situations for that to happen and generally when it happens to me it‚Äôs because a survivor brought the killer directly to me and I didn‚Äôt have a chance to dip out right away. 
---
missed the whole point .. üôÑ my first time complaining , they do it all day and will continue to.
---
Aren't the TR changes a little to hard or nah? I'm still learning her so I don't know. 
---
&gt;Increased Terror Radius from 28 meters to 32 meters.
---
WTF why???
---
What if your facing a killer with a terror radius smallee then 28 meters 
---
I mean, if even some slightly "boost", it would be good. I agree, everyone should have some favorite survivor, but you won't play it all the time, do you? I am long term MOBA player as well, and even there, I never stick just to my favorite champions/heroes, every change has its advantages. And as I wrote in the post, I didn't mean that "powers" should be even close like ones you mentioned in Identity V game (which I haven't played), but like ones mentioned above. It won't change the game THAT MUCH, but it would be still small change that might come in handy. Or maybe even adding additions to both sides. Like example for Doctor (first thing poped in my mind), "When you hit the survivor, increase the amount of madness on them by 50% of regular shock therapy", because like this, game will come to the point (or already it is) where only changes we see are new killers/survivors. Big patches are part of every big title. :)
---
There is never an in between. 
---
R.I.P.
---
‚ÄúHey does the killer have NOED?‚Äù
---
You should have died years ago
---
How long it takes to blind someone
---
The increased gen speed is the thing that made leader the most worth running. Without that it's kinda bad tbh
---
Yeah. Pretty much. Unless someone is already hooked or the survivors aren't doing gens, it's not worth completely shutting down the entirety of your momentum. Unless you're nurse, in which case you can 1-blink to instant down them lol
---
Wait are these changes actually happening or is this just for the meme? If they are I am going to be so happy.
---
Meh, most of their BS will still be there. 
---
....you classify reading perks after the game as cheating. Are you ok? 
---
ikr
---
I‚Äòm not saying nor am i assuming that everyone knows that, but I‚Äòm gonna do all I can (even if all I can is just to not save people when they wiggle) to make sure that atleast some players know that and yea i didn‚Äòt mandate it, it used to be the standard when the game came out
---
She's been through this shit before, I feel like her and fish face gcgee over on the right are constantly on high alert since they've encountered supernatural and deadly forces before being pulled into the Fog.
---
I mean by that logic friends can't talk during games? Should we all only be allowed to play alone from now on so we don't know who needs healing etc? All multi-player games are usually subject to comms. This wasn't new when devs put SWF in the game. All survivors have really is info. Killers are already OP and are growing more so as devs keep tieing survivor's hands behind their backs. Besides having the info on the build isn't innately detrimental to the killer's game. Killers are more likely to get a 4k than 0k. Really this is just something they want to make their games even easier. But really it's hard to be a good killer when survivors stop playing this game. 
---
Yeah, he's the only killer who scares me anymore, on the off chance that I do play survivor.
---
Then you die 
---
When there's a killer brother who can sneak up on you without you knowing, you'd be worried too. Haha
---
Not even vinesauce? D:
---
I'm thinking it should have snow falling from the sky. It doesn't need to be super pretty. And any time you offer the thick mist burning, the snow would increase in severity. Instead of seeing 25ft away, it would only be 15ft or so. 
---
I wish that Kate could play on guitar here like she did in DLC trailer
---
So if you use the new Self-Care in concert with Botany Knowlege you would theoretically be able to heal both yourself and others at 108% speed since the 33% healing speed increase on Botany Knowledge does not state that it raises it to a maximum of 100% (like We'll Make It does).
---
its for meters, in the reduced crouch time you move faster with the .7 seconds taken off and with 2.6 seconds of the TR fading faster, you basically get no penalty on those miniscule 4  meters, as long as you use your crouch consistently
---
Love that they did nothing whatsoever to fix the issues with deep wound, that 20/30 second timer change only makes it worse.
---
That‚Äòs what I was trying to say with ‚Äúso the animation only begins‚Äú I use short wiggle when i want to get saved and long wiggle if I don‚Äòt
---
as a fellow quentin main I'd love you, but you *ware beenee* so its no from me.
---
Stoned DbD sounds great.  I‚Äôd be terrible, but I‚Äôd definitely be spooked.
---
It takes 1.3 seconds with all flashlights now 
---
i don't know why you're not running self-care in the first place. YOU are being the hindrance to the rest of the team by not running it.
---
Okay yes obviously not everyone, but the majority did, and the majority used the wiggle as a way to signalise that the killer‚Äòs camping
---
Well then distortion would stop you from dying
---
I'd like to see Kate playing on guitar there like she did in DLC trailer.
---
Yeah but then freddy will get him
---
Better beanie than quilted shirt
---
It take's away from the randomness of your teammates in public lobbies...
---
And "Nea is a killer" 
---
Hey, I think you gave it the wrong flair. I think you meant to click on "shit post".
---
If not, then my god how do you not realize that you're literally the survivor equivalent of "killer's complain a lot"
---
Yeah. I suppose they need to comfort themselves somehow after I left one them slugged 4 separate times, ignored multiple chases to break pallets, and even stopped crouching (was playing Pig) so they'd no I was coming and to try and hide, all so I could get to the end with everyone standing to have some endgame RBT chaos fun.
---
Nah, it would stop you from being revealed though 
---
[Oh is this how I get the new outfit for Feng?](https://imgur.com/XLxwn0H) Glad to see they're still doing free event cosmetics.
---
Ah, fair enough. I took the least charitable interpretation of your comment, sorry about that. 
---
NOED is a bit of a bullshit perk, I agree, but I don‚Äôt see a problem with Blood Warden. You‚Äôre giving up a perk slot for something that‚Äôs really situational and not particularly strong, and previously SWF could just stop it ever activating at all which is really unfair. I don‚Äôt think a kill someone gets through BW is unearned at all, personally, and I honestly never see killers running it because it isn‚Äôt that strong.
---
I‚Äôm hoping that in the long run, the devs are nerfing SWF and buffing certain killers so they can give all survivors a bit of a boost (I think built in Kindred is my favourite idea for this). The closer everyone gets to being equally strong the better. Maybe they‚Äôll even nerf a couple of the stronger killers eventually.
---
How does that happen with the scoring system though? I‚Äôve been playing for a while and have never made it past rank 8 or so, but I can‚Äôt imagine someone could rank up especially that high if they don‚Äôt participate in each category? 
---
There is a lot you can do in this game other than heal if the killer is pre-occupied is more my point. I understand this buffs Self-Care but I'll still opt to run a medkit if I really want the ability to heal myself because then I have an extra perk slot for whatever I need instead.
---
I experience about one dc every two matches, and yeah, it sucks for everyone.  When I‚Äôm killer I‚Äôm disappointed because it kinda invalidates my win/I feel bad for the remaining survivors, and as a survivor it sucks because you miss out on an entire two minutes of that killer having to worry about their hooked survivor while you work on gens.
---
i could give him a shot, didnt know he played it
---
Oh thank god, trapper and footstep fixes. Except for self care I like all the perk changes, and is it possible? Spies from the shadows might be strong? I love that perks are now hidden until the game is over and it‚Äôs nice they somewhat addressed pig deviousness gains. Even as a killer I‚Äôm glad chests give better items. Anything to reduce the grind in this game.
---
Didn‚Äôt see anything about doctors pallets though, not even in known issues. Wonder if maybe him not seeing fake pallets is intended now. Hope they can manage to fix wraith at least before this goes out.
---
And now whats the point?
---
Uhhhhhhh... I‚Äôve never seen that in my many hours in dbd.
---
I want a fat stay at home mother named Peggy who waddles when she runs
---
i mean, the whole point of self care is to be able to patch yourself up without having to rely on others or scrounge for a medkit.  the name itself implies a certain selfishness.  
---
:)
---
yikers don‚Äôt take it to heart bud üíÄ I literally complained ONCE , I usually go with the flow . Tyvm
---
Check out ardethas guide on youtube. Its the only current one i could find and is pretty helpful
---
Almost every rank 1 survivor is garbage 
---
Copied and pasted from my response to someone else earlier: Before you start the gen just look around for what route you will take, I usually look for the nearest window/pallet. Loop them around the pallet as long as you can until you need to drop it, then run to the next pallet/window and continue to try looping them. In my experience, 360s are a last resort and usually don't work out.
---
Despite how my post made it sound, it was actually very fun! It was almost like playing Until Dawn because it felt like I was watching a horror movie as I played.
---
I had forgotten my golden rule which was always assume the killer is Michael until proven otherwise, which led to Michael grabbing me off a gen and scaring the shit out of me. That whole match felt like I was in a Halloween movie, which made it feel so captivating and exciting.
---
People still wanna witch hunt in 2019. Maybe people are the same since Medieval?
---
Interesting. You have some very coordinated solo queues. Almost as if they are swf. 
---
"Everyone‚Äôs human tho man, it does suck to lose hard but you cant put your anger on the other side because your anger acts as a catalyst in the process of dehumanizing the other side. You get so angry that you don‚Äôt look at your opponents as real people, you look at them as animals and inferior ones at that." I agree, but complaining about it on the internet isn't human. That's a learned means of catharsis. They need to find other ways of letting out their frustrations. Or at the very least 'start' to find ways and stop flooding this sub with the whining. 
---
I'm not going to say the old "I come her for (blank) not (blank)" b/c it's subjective. But I know I'm quite sure in my presumption that nobody comes here to be flooded with sob stories about the time some dude was mean to them on a video game. 
---
Were these made for Streamdad?
---
If he does he gonna die so he can‚Äôt 
---
Oh but he alrwady has the bbq so it goes pretty fast
---
Yeah
---
Few things.
---
\&gt; Beast of Prey: When starting a chase, your stain is hidden until you hit the survivor. Has a cooldown of 30 seconds. 
---
That's a nerf. it procs when bloodlust is active and lost when you lose bloodlust. unless you're getting looped at a god pallet, it procs faster now and technically lasts till you hit a survivor (or lose the chase, break pallets, use a power). I like your idea though
---
\&gt; Thanataphobia: Increased percentages from 6/9/12/15% to 12/16/20/24%. Affects dead survivors. 
---
I think the percentage increase miiiight be a bit much. Just a bit. I've always wanted it to stay effected when a survivor is hooked or dead - pseudo dying light, if you will.
---
Something I wouldn't mind seeing is Bamboozle being token based. Hook a survivor and receive a token at max of 1/2/3 that regresses 25%. Something like that. Shout outs to Space Coconut. 
---
Huntress' Lullaby already not giving survivors a skill check warning and instead, hooking increases the regression, say like hook for max of 3/4/5 tokens and each token being worth 1%. bit ridiculous that it tells the survivor its existence before it does anything and getting popped before it does anything.
---
Unnerving presents removing great skill checks so its not helping the survivors since that's all it does at high ranks. Might make ruin a threat, also, if paired with it.
---
Whispers to not proc off of hooked survivors (that might be a bit much)
---
Y‚Äôall got it good asf with y‚Äôall add ons and perks and still complain cause y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt kill everyone.
---
Me in school lmao
---
That means those survivors are trash. Drop someone and by the time you down someone else the other 3 should be fully healed. Or try to pick them up again and the bar is going up 33% so eventually you'll end up with 4 injured survivors and no one on dying.
---
Not really. There are other perks than self care like pharmacy or iron will which have their own upsides. Being injured usually works well as a distraction to take the heat off another survivor, if you know what you're doing. Plus you can use the time you would have spent healing doing a quarter (or more) of a generator, getting a totem, opening the gates etc.
---
I rarely ever ask for heals when I'm injured, other players want to do it. I'm frustrated because not only do you have to deal with people freaking out that you won't let them heal you but now if you give in it'll take even longer.
---
I don't think people should have to run self care at all. It's definitely a good perk but it doesn't suit everyone's styles.
---
1. Every survivor defines it differently but its basically the act of targeting one survivor over the rest. This can be done both tactically to remove a survivor from the game faster when they're on death hook, or just to annoy someone.
---
2. Honestly they both suck. Bond does everything that keys can except open the hatch and maps are useless once you learn spawns. I recommend doing a SWF. One of you brings a Rainbow Map with the bead and odd stamp addons, the other brings a purple or red key. Find the hatch with the map, place down the marker for the other person and pop it open.
---
3. When the survivors only have one generator left to complete, it means three are left on the map. If they're very close together and easy to patrol, the killer is able to 3 gen effectively, even more so with perks like Overcharge and Pop Goes the Weasel. 
---
It wasn‚Äôt even that normal back then. A big chunk of the player base didn‚Äôt do it and that hasn‚Äôt really changed.
---
They'll never nerf killers but I like your dream. Still don't agree about the other stuff though. Noed deserves to never trigger. 
---
You piece of shit 
---
I‚Äôve been had
---
He is right...
---
Why is this game so fun to play with friends?
---
whew chile some of y‚Äôall taking this rant to heart .      
---
The whole post asks what the community would like me to run instead with my shitty choices or unprefered choices since I wasnt aware of the bug until someone told me post chat. But looks like I'll just run NOED and still get triggered post chat so oh well 
---
Hmm, do I classify using third party programs to bypass game mechanics and obtain an unintended advantage as cheating? Yes. Yes I do. I'm funny like that.
---
Just because it's your first time complaining doesn't change anything. I'm sure it's other people's first time too. 
---
Have you ever even played killer? Whenever I hit someone when they vault it's their fault, not the games.
---
I've had one situation with Myers where the survivor was completely past the window and got hit, but Myers is pretty buggy that way.
---
Pallets aren't supposed to be a heavenly, 100% escape free card from killers. If you are close enough to the killer where he can hit you, you played it wrong.
---
Also, both survivor and killer mains complain. It's just a little biased because most of this subreddit is composed of killer mains, but that doesn't mean one complains more than the other.
---
You definitely should give it a shot - It felt like I was experiencing everything for the first time again.
---
I‚Äôve always thought this so I usually yeet the second hook and then the first.
---
It's balanced for casual play insteqad of top level play. That's what they want looks like to me and it's their game so only thing you can truly do is complain and maybe stop supporting them.
---
I don't understand anything in this.
---
Al "touchdown" Bundy next and he must have 2 outfits.  Polk High jersey and a NO MA'MA shirt....end

She looks like she's challenging me to a dance battle. I'm gonna lose. Nice job!

So to fight this trend you make another post about it.
---
A very good art piece, posted on a bad time though :P
---
That's how mafia work.
---
I'm calling the police
---
Kinda sad Bill isn‚Äôt on console now 
---
YES GET FUCKED SOLO Q, WHAT WE NEEDED, MORE SHIT FOR SOLOS BECAUSE OF SWF, THANKS BHVR!
---
Yeah I believe both would be 108% with the penalties applied to the 33% for Botany.
---
Were you saladqueen7 and toxic meg all swf a few days ago?
---
Pretty cool clip overall.
---
And what about calm spirit? Sometimes I still scare crows off when Im using this perk... 
---
I like that they have more character here now
---
Claudette looks scared and figity, nea looks angry, adam looks thoughtful and bill looks almost bored.
---
Im assuming some of them have reused animations but what are the other survivors doing
---
That means you got max blood points in everything, including protection, chase, unhooking, healing, etc... was the killer farming?
---
Because his teammates are getting fucked by him not doing gens and instead doing full totems
---
Wtaf...
---
Haha, I wanna try it
---
I sometimes purposefully lead survivors into leaving the last 3 generators close to each other. It's gives me 4/4 kills every time, 90 percent of the time. 
---
Survivors are still far FAR stronger than killers. A well experienced survivor team is going to crush majority of killers, nevermind if they are in comms revealing perks. This game was nothing but killer nerfs for a long time, BHVR is finally shifting the balance back to where it should be which is right down the middle.
---
I mean, you can do it with Steam.  It's objectively not cheating, Steam messaging was there when they conceived of the game and when they released it.
---
I just want an option to see how many totems have been done in the match while I'm being chased for 3 minutes. Cleansing totems is easy and is on yourself if you are in an swf. In solo, I feel like I'm playing a game of roulette. 
---
Not only does it take time to find the totems and cleanse them, but then you have to look for totems that may have already been cleansed with no real way of knowing. Give some transparency or better incentive to cleanse and then there will be no excuse to complain.
---
Look at lil sleepy boi Quentin 
---
I don‚Äôt think so, cause it sounds like the killer needs to destroy them for points, while the survivor needs to collect them. I don‚Äôt see how you can really farm that? It‚Äôs not like a killer letting you collect nectar and then you letting them hook you on the event hook
---
More spirit r34
---
Ok you bring up a good point but they should make it so you have a limit amount of how refunds you can do
---
I'm not saying that BT is bad. I'm just saying it was buffed, which is good becasue it was previously useless. Whining about a perk that was recently buffed is very petulant
---
Wild Wraith appeared
---
&lt;Flashlight&gt; &lt;Run&gt;
---
But Bike Messenger is for Dwight...
---
Oh wow, so you are fine being a filthy slugger huh? /s
---
But seriously, how many people would be bitch if the killers actually did this to avoid DS. Opinion on this oh great and all knowing Panda?
---
Kate has barely any :(
---
As a Dwight main who doesn't run urban evasion and usually ends up doing 3/5 gens by himself only to die anyway I feel personally attacked right now
---
At the very least, they should downgrade the rarity of the new, shitty version of BNP
---
Yeah, why would he need to probe himself? David is right there!
---
They are made by wholeYEETrye if you find his twitter you may find a link.  Sorry i dont have the link right now
---
‚ÄúAFK‚Äù no *hides there for a sec until another survivor revives me * it helps to not get caught and hooked üôÑ and I have a few things to moan about I‚Äôm not gonna get into right now unless you wanna
---
Im assuming this is to account for the momentum youre now keeping.
---
Nah it sounds better to me, because now both sides have to do something else. The Halloween thing was stupid because the survivor had the extra objective and the killer got to just play as normal basically. Sounds like they‚Äôre actually on the right track with this.
---
The hound mask was exclusively for the year of the Dog last year. We'll probably never see it again as an event item that can be earned.
---
Doctor can gain stupid amounts of Bloodpoints due to his power slowing down matches and makes it much more difficult for Survivors to hide.
---
Distressing is a must due to it makes your Terror Radius larger which you want for his power and you get extra Bloodpoints which is nice.
---
BBQ&amp;Chili for the extra Bloodpoints and reveals Survivors which is nice.
---
Then whatever two perks you want to use to help you slow down the match as much as possible (You're going for points, not Sacrifices/Kills) to give you more time to gain Bloodpoints
---
Or more likely everyone runs self care and no one heals anyone else 
---
Idk I get why it‚Äôs a thing. It‚Äôs a perk to give them some power end game. I play a lot more survivor then killer and I can say we bully the killer if he doesn‚Äôt have it and manages to get a down. It‚Äôs not ok. The killer should always be the power player in my opinion. I wanna be afraid of the killer that‚Äôs why I got in the game to begin with 
---
I take it as . Y‚Äôall are killer mains taking it to heart lol it‚Äôs legit just a rant and y‚Äôall got y‚Äôall panties in a bunch
---
What? Jeff got added literally 2 chapters ago
---
Well, if you wanna keep farming downvotes, be my guest.
---
If they're shit, then it shouldn't be a problem eithwr way
---
Not whining about the perk lol , I‚Äôm mad about the locker nerf
---
There is only five totems on the map, and they usually spawn near a gen, if you are doing gens you can pretty easily get the totem that surely spawned nearby.  Noed is easy to counter, it doesn't break the flow of gameplay, since totems spawn near gens, and are fast to break. 
---
I'm pretty sure it's unintended since it wasn't mentioned anywhere in the patch notes. 
---
I'm like 90% certain it's to do with the debuff changes, where only the longest duration will take effect. I'm GUESSING that the spaghetti code just gave you a 0-1 second duration exhaustion effect and left it at that, but with the changes, that'll just get ignored since you've almost certainly have a longer duration exhaustion effect in place.
---
At least that's my assumption.
---
I think you mixed nurse and Freddy up /s
---
The truth come out... does is David bottom?
---
I 4K with Freddy, so he needs a nerf amirite
---
didn't see a single Indian or Jewish survivor/killer though. 
---
I demand a Jewish killer. make Jack the Ripper a Jewish refugee doctor from Eastern Europe. and for survivor - Indian spice salesman who witnessed one of Jack's murders. they didn't find Jack cause Entity took him.
---
A Mexican called Pablo.
---
Perks : ‚ÄòThe Wall.‚Äô
---
You have an uncanny hatred for people going against your will and confining you to an area. When the killer it within 10 metres, press a button to summon a pallet directly on top of their head, stunning the killer for 2 seconds. Can be used every 50/45/40 seconds and recharges when not in a chase.

---
I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd feel about a ranked mode with stuff disabled, kyf is basically casual mode already.
---
Also... survivors bringing in OP stuff will make it hard for killers? Uh... yet it‚Äôs okay for killers to bring in OP stuff against survivors that don‚Äôt have OP items? 
---
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a ranking system. 
---
You shouldnt feel guilty even if they didnt run DS. It's a perk there for you to play your game. Run the perks, play how you want , and have fun! 
---
Like what I hear. BOTH sides having a second objective is exactly how it should be, and how it needs to also be if they ever want to slow the game down some. 
---
Kind of them to give 3 outfits away for free. Thanks devs. 
---
Dude what? Third party program? It‚Äôs literally in the game. How are you bypassing a game mechanic when it‚Äôs literally in the game, intended for survivors to see and read.
---
oh, my bad then, move along people
---
Wow sure great story. 
---
Most people that play this game know wiggling on the hook means you are being camped. You are extending that to also say "don't save me at all". I'd agree with this since I enjoy running Deliverance, which gets wasted when a teammate still comes to save you.
---
By popular opinion, I haven't...
---
If only people would see Freddy as the tracking god that he is.
---
He doesn't need to sleep you to know what you're saying about him, and he feels every insult. #PrayForFreddy
---
Survivors bitch and moan at me for not LETTING them unhook or escape.
---
Laurie and Michael are not related in the lore of DBD, though, since they were lifted from the first movie and their sibling status wasn't established until the second movie.
---
Self care got BUFFED for Immersed Claudettes. They heal themselves faster, but other people slower, but how often do you see an Immersed Claudette healing other people?
---
You didn't.
---
lmao
---
God aren't you a special little snowflake who can't stand the killer having some fun once in a while. 
---
I think it means they hide a lot and urban evasion around the map instead of running or walking. 
---
Oh weird i was with you and those 2 a few days ago we were against a legion on an autohaven map. 
---
He did.
---
Most of the time you'll get to the dead hook before getting full stacks because either they didn't get healed or didn't get saved before the next hook phase.
---
You sound like a typical virgin, holy shit if I ever heard one. Good thing you uninstalled. One idiot less.
---
There's been well deserved nerfs to SPECIFIC killers (Billy flick, trapper trapping below hooks, nurse going from 3 blinks to 2) but overall, killers don't seem to ever get blanket nerfs.
---
Definitely not bannable, and it's something I've done. Their tears are delicious, and I bet you once they do get a report and see the replay, they laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh. I know I was. 
---
Small chance? If it's nurse, wraith, trapper or pig I am 100% crushing totems (unless I can figure out all their perks). Totem locations aren't hard (except for brand new maps) and if you have trouble, grab detectives hunch. Even if there's no noed, it'll help you learn the maps and may even catch out other hex perks. I have no idea why you'd think it's invalid to use a perk to help you survive, but it shows inflexibility. Adjust your playstyle to the game not the other way around. I used it to learn totem locations and now I don't need it. It's pretty common to have other survivors do at least 2 dull totems and they're easy to spot while being chased, hiding, looking for gens etc. So it shouldn't be a time sink once you're no longer new to the game.
---
And when I do play killer, not only do I not like noed (don't like to rely on survivor mistakes), I frequently use enduring (as do a bunch of killers) to deal with DS. I don't usually slug or dribble unless it's about to be a clutch ds (near open exit or something) since it's not worth the time. 
---
Wasn't that released just after the Halloween event? Some people don't play like they normally would, during an event.
---
&gt;Constantly fighting
---
&gt;Has a bunch of bruises 
---
&gt;Cusses a lot
---
Yup, fits the power bottom criteria. Sorry fellow gays, I don't make the rules.
---
So, ive been on the shitter trying to squeeze a turd out. This made me laugh enough to push it out. Thanks friend.
---
Yes they do, but leader not did yourself 
---
excuse me?  Feng Min is the only one who can have big brain because she's Asian.   
---
True but this requires leveling and is hard countered by survivors not being altristic and doing generators instead of basement diving
---
I am not butthurt when I play killer. I am butthurt from having to play with little selfish shits who abandon you after you've done all you can to save them. 
---
you're saying it's your first rant as if you see same killers bitch every day *shrug*
---
yeah, of course killers will vent more. cause as killer you are getting literally bullied by 4 people and then flamed in end chat. the mechanics game has makes it so survivors are not the innocent victims but someone who you need to punish. as killer, you don't feel you're one. because people ain't scared, fam. cause the Devs made it so and called it horror while horror is literally in the fact that 4 little people can bully a huge killing machine with nearly unlimited evil power. 
---
bye I‚Äôm not only on Reddit so stop using that as an excuse . I didn‚Äôt say they complained more or that they were the only ones to complain . MY POINT is that they complain a lot and they have everything to help them ! 
---
Im over  rank 10 so no one hook dives to save people unless the gates are open
---
Well now you have to heal against a Legion or risk getting 2 hit downed.
---
So that's fun.
---
PTB
---
Strategic outsourcing of hits blew my funny fuse 
---
That's why it's funny
---
I'm confused on what this means.
---
thats true. i though i got bbq and chilli with iridescent shards which saved me a fortune of blood points
---
lemme say it once more for ya .. slowly . 
---
I‚Äôm upset because I can‚Äôt sit in a locker after BT runs out it POPS ME OUT OF THE LOCKER ONTO THE GROUND TO BE FOUND .. tyvm
---
Sooo...no love for the Pig in an event made for her year?
---
What do you mean play the bloodweb right? pick cheap ones?
---
DLC was 50% off so i got them all lol
---
You can't get good against his power. He sets the chase on a timer before he just gets a win. Double stab with the power, and then stab one more time with OP mixtape, or twice without. He deletes skill and fun from the game, with no counterplay to his power.
---
I assume you are talking about NOED. Technically DS is removed once activated and if close enough to a hook can also be prevented by dribbling.
---
Jake and Spirit are Asian too.
---
They can have their fun I just aint gonna be a part of it
---
Just get within quick attack distance and don‚Äôt hold it for too long and you‚Äôll be fine. 
---
Agreed hes so noisey its like hes insanely clumbsy or unco.
---
Did the other guy end up dying?
---
Make your blood webs as cheap as you can, after rank 25 two perks will appear per web. Buy a perk and the entity will spawn and eat the other perk, there‚Äôs a great video by TydeTime to look up if you‚Äôre confused about bloodweb spending. Good luck gamer 
---
Its so cool
---
My go to build has since been Kindred and Autodidact because with everyone running Sloppy Butcher to slow game speeds, my favorite thing was running around being the amazing heal machine. One skill check with a fully stacked autodidact meant just blazing fast heal times. Some killers thought I was running purple medkits too. 
---
I think the decreased terror radius fade in time will make gen grabs very difficult now? I assume that's why it was changed in the first place.
---
I would take that deal. We could however eliminate the hatch &amp; noed so there isn't a reward for bad play. 
---
Shout out to surveillance buff. I'm a recent p3 pig and I'll finally use that perk for the first time!
---
Imo, I thought old brand new part was pretty nerve wracking. I honestly don‚Äôt think many people perfected it. I‚Äôve been in many games where me and my friends brought in BNP‚Äôs, and it‚Äôs rarely successful, if ever. I mean yeah it still gave us an advantage but we never 4-gen‚Äôd it. You act as if the old BNP is always a 100% success rate, and it definitely wasn‚Äôt. t doesn‚Äôt take much to slip up, even with the grip wrench. Yeah, the new BNP is more difficult, and relatively useless for that extreme difficulty.
---
I love this so much. 
---
You wanna punish survivors for doing their objective? If you get gen rushed, you arent playing well.
---
Couldn't of spoken better "we will adapt"
---
Where is the image from? I need a source please. I really hope this is real
---
I mean being able to actually run Blood Warden or any other end game perk is pretty nice. You shouldn't be able to counter perks with a sentence.
---
Yes/no. He spent the whole time trying to find noed because we were on the meat plant. He had a door opened but wanted to find it so he could‚Äôve gotten out but didn‚Äôt in order to educate himself 
---
I‚Äôm gonna go die now lol good sign tho but I put voice cracks in while reading it and....
---
yeah but you said killers complain a lot while they have all the help in the world. which literally isn't true. though it is easier to kill after Curtain Calls, it still doesn't mean you control the game. meeting 4 survivors of your skill level makes them the game masters. power is still on survivors' side if they play how it supposed to be played - working as a team.
---
still by now your best chance as killer to get kills is for survivors to make mistakes. if no one does horrible mistakes, everyone escapes. 
---
-rep for camping on your profile on steam, an angry msg on console.
---
"it kinda RUINS the point of it"
---
Everything is working as intended. 
---
Survivor gets caught in locker "friggin noed!"
---
The mini mazes in it makes me interested as being open enough for killers but having good escapes for chases
---
if they insist on changing exhaustion and healing every patch, can we please get some vigil changes. :'(
---
I think you're delusional if you think you're ever going to get a consistent meaning throughout the community for what wiggling on the hook means. 
---
No, let's not agree. I like using and going against both perks.
---
It wont be better than Whispers I dont think. But Calm Spirit is now worth to take. You counter Spies and counter doc so its not as terrible
---
I've liked this idea before. It levels playing field for swf and solo groups
---
Yeah Kate would be cool but I‚Äôm seeing a distinct lack of Jeff r/34
---
But it's an extra 8%. Don't that percents matter? It's roughly a second and a half with botany knowledge with that extra 8%. Perhaps it's just the UI making it white, not the speed changing.
---
Although I wouldnt use it, that's a pretty cool idea.
---
Anyone else pissed that they promised us a legion buff and gave us . . . This, instead?
---
orang man bad
---
Okay in my experience kill-billy is better. his mobility is much higher, he still 1 hits with chainsaw, once you learn to use him he can be super easy to win with. 
---
A good hill-billy is godtier
---
Wanna show me an example of her being needlessly mean to someone?
---
exactly or other killers, but no, they want survivors to just hook themselves
---
pretty much using pallets as intended
---
did you ever play Hillbilly on red ranks?
---
It‚Äôs not guaranteed but what I do is a count to 1 after you come out of phase walk then attack. I find it helps but the survivors have time to react
---
Probably not. It's still a stupidly easy perk to counter.
---
Most survivor perks feel too situational generally
---
Mmm yes they are. NOED can turn a trash killer who should get 0 kills a 4 kill game with no skill at all. 
---
DS stuns you for 4 seconds, gives the survivor a free escape, and all 4 survivors can use. 
---
They are bullshit and should be removed. 
---
Because of how the chainsaw works, especially the bug where the chainsaw is completely silent, because I can't even tell you how many times all of the survivors randomly spawn together in a corner just a little bit from Leatherface to down all of us within 30 seconds of the match starting, and because out of all the Leather Faces I've faced, I've encountered only 2 that weren't tunneling assholes who simply camped hooked survivors.
---
Good for you. 1 minute tops for all of them, right?
---
Except killers have reason to complain. The anxiety you can get going into a match and knowing you‚Äôre going to get relentless smacked around and tbagged by survivors, it can really get to you when playing Killer. 
---
Me too
---
You mean when they wait at a pallet till you are in stun range then throw it down? If so, I didnt even know that had a term
---
Am I the only person experiencing problems with scratch Marks? Ever since the legion update I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble finding survivors and I don‚Äôt see any mention of it here in the patch notes. 
---
This is such a nice touch
---
Oh I'm not denying that it's not annoying as hell to deal with but for the most part it's a fallback strategy and not something you want to really rely on.
---
The majority of the time people the strategy is a situation you can't even really call it a strategy it's almost always because the survivors don't spread out the gens effectively and cluster themselves. 
---
Since the killer was playing normally the team is pretty worn down over people have died order on death hook meaning you can't exactly apply the necessary pressure to the gens that you wouldn normally need.
---
Downvoted because you are an asshole.
---
Umm, what's Tapps new animation?
---
~PS4 Tapp main
---
Done that a few times, it's fucking ecstatic when you're cleansing the last totem, and the last gen pops, and it turns into NOED, then bam! Cleansed. I've had that happen twice in the last week. It's hilarious, and the killer is saaaaalty.
---
I run We‚Äôll Make It so I can heal you right here, right now. I don‚Äôt run it so I can chase you halfway across the map and heal you in a corner. If someone runs away for more than five seconds when the Killer is nowhere in sight, I‚Äôm not following you. Go self care somewhere else.
---
Max survival points? Is that possible?+
---
Most of them are fine. 
---
But survivors who aren't total idiots can get 2-3 gens popped *very* quickly already, and now you're going to see a lot of Self Care/Prove Thyself meta that's going to make it even worse
---
r/whoosh
---
Yea but at the same time gens are done so fast already idk if we wanna encourage these quick games even more
---
lol, thought it's other post I'm arguing in.
---
look, I'm a rank 1 Freddy main, okay? Bubba's fine. no killer, when a player is skilled, needs good add-ons or perks or dirty play to get good kills.
---
BHVR themselves don‚Äôt mind, but if steam‚Äôs EAC detects these changes and bans you for modifying game files, they can‚Äôt do anything about that. Essentially just do at your own risk. 
---
You‚Äôre watching the wrong streamers then 
---
Nope. Just knock'em out as the game goes.
---
that doesnt work as it slows you down to a crawl and takes ~10 seconds to power up without addons. 
---
Sure it can be very situationally avoided, but you have to get lucky like that 3 times. And if they used it, the damage is done, that's hardly considered removing it. In all honesty I don't really think either are OP, a majority of players just really don't prepare for either of them and they are both very punishing to the unprepared. 
---
But I do think NOED is significantly less powerful that DS because of how easy it is to prevent or remove. I often go get most totems myself in a minute and a half or so, because I know totem spawns very well. With friends we all just get them if we see them and prevent it by default. Each survivor doing a totem each (plus one obv) takes very little time, it's like 10-15 seconds.
---
I would have struggled too if you were to leave on the hook like that. 
---
If this is bannable, I‚Äôm all for getting the hammer.
---
Both of them kind of suck now
---
Damn you just spoiled me the movie
---
Well, that's the risk of running No Mither, I run it sometimes myself, you need to be very sneaky, but the issue isn't whether Leather Face is a good or bad killer, it's how the majority of the Leather Faces I see play him, which is W+M2, hook a survivor, and start their camp fire.
---
They buffed self care.....
---
I don‚Äôt think you promote your YT channel here...?
---
He‚Äôs ok. I still don‚Äôt like the concept being the legion tho. The only reason they called him that was to do skins for them. I would rather have the killers power be reflective of that not his cosmetics
---
but you need add ons as its a long power up without them and you slow to a crawl so any semi conscious survivor should just run when he crawls towards them revving
---
It‚Äôs not really a good perk because by the time you kill the obsession, there are only 1 or 2 gems left most of the time. Although, it does feel good if you get it to actually work.
---
I wanna play with that surveillance perk for sure. Idk if the crows will be used tho. I‚Äôve always just ignored them
---
Please note that no malice is intended towards our friend Nea, this was just a totally hilarious moment and I wanted to share it!
---
Then you'll love this ‚Ä¶ keep in mind it's not an official build.

---
rank 9 killer. ive seen him teamwipe on low tier survivor games when hook camping, but at that high up no one suicides to dehook they just do gens and escape
---
But why does it punish _everyone else_ who had no choice in what perks you brought in?
---
If anything it should make it much slower for _others_ to heal you. 
---
That's what animators do when they get bored
---
Well other scores are cut off all I would guess farming game? 
---
Distortion doesn‚Äôt work if you are hurt? Hmmm I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing. Discouraged self care 
---
No one will deny Legion might be the most entertaining and unique character with his properties...But that won't compensate for the lackluster power. Yeah it's fun to chain stabs and be a general pest, but it's not fun when your power is just wiped away and has minimal effect on the game overall. 
---
Where do the survivors go after they‚Äôve been sacrificed? Back to the camp fire? Where are they running at the end of the match? 
---
This is amazing, exactly what the community was asking for ;D
---
Wow I just posted it lol, I didn't even see it. I love it tho. https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/adz2qd/give_tapp_a_blanket/
---
lol don‚Äôt take the tea bagging to heart hun . If you could tea bag the survivors that were on the floor  after you downed them I‚Äôm sure you would . And ‚Äúsmacked around‚Äù I assume you mean pallets . You can avoid that you can respect the pallet and trick them or go around and double back or whatever the hell you wanna do lol
---
This is delicious!
---
I like the self care change.
---
Quality post, thanks OP
---
Ace is canonly from Argentina tho! (ace mainz big brainz)
---
The idea of changing the appearance of pallets (bookcases and what not) has been floated before and the general consensus is that it would be harder to read quickly what you can throw down and what you can't. There's different arguments to make there (like people learning over time, using a consistent color scheme etc.) But that's generally where it's at. 
---
Multilevel kinda screws with some mechanics (terror radius and nurses blink for starters). It can give some killers a much much bigger advantage than others. While it's not unheard of for some maps to affect killers differently (playing Billy on the farm vs hospital), it creates a lot of design headaches since you don't want to make that worse.
---
Having said that, I wouldn't mind a bigger variety of maps, although I'm not unhappy with what we have. 
---
Missed opportunity not having them interact with eachother.
---
I think that's a dumb reason to adjust it, but I'm sure that's the reason why. 
---
Moonrise event?
---
The new Leader/Prove theyself is crazy. Gen rush is back XD. also maxed out after 2 gens
---
All I can say is use the Chili add ons, and the charge time speed add ons. Use the chainsaw as much as you can, if you think you can hit them in time.
---
You‚Äôll be close to 35 with that amount of bp
---
Surveillance makes it so when you kick a gen it will appear in a white aura, and unless its regresses to 0, or a survivor works on it. That can be usefull. Probably will benefit stealthy characters more.  The Extra hearing distance can be great for stealthy characters like Pig, Myers, Wraith, Hag(with right addons) and such to know if someone is working on a gen from farther away.
---
It‚Äôs not a glitch it‚Äôs a lack on killers (I think someone already said so I won‚Äôt restate what they said) my best guess is part of it is prolly due to how broken killer audio and other stuff is right now. The devs will get to it eventually, they‚Äôve had to respond to a lack of killers in the past so they‚Äôll fix it eventually. They just got back from break tho so give them some time and see what happens.
---
Quentin tried to sleep but then jolts awake, seen [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/adx6y4/quentin_needs_a_nap/) There's also Kate, making a beat on her knee, and Jeff... doing what Jeff does...
---
That's really fucking cool. I've never seen that.
---
hm
---
yes ;(
---
The obsession is always the P3 Claudette who is never seen or the P3 Nea who has been power crouching everywhere never leaving a mark.
---
imagine downvoting my response on a 3 day old thread on an account you made 40 minutes ago lmfao
---
‚ÄòSmacked around‚Äô not in the literal sense, genius. The survivors have so much to use against the killers, and after all that and the survivors decide to be knobs and tbag, you really think that‚Äôs not going to piss killers off? I assume you don‚Äôt play Killer much, but if you do play Killer for extended amounts of time, it gets to you.
---
And a killer that can tbag does exist, and though I do use her I don‚Äôt like tbagging survivors. Why? Because I don‚Äôt see much of a reason to be a dick to the opposition. Clearly you see differently, and it speaks volumes.
---
For consistency, she moves at normal speed. The smaller radius were applied to most of the lady killers were done because they had slower movement speed. 
---
She doesn't need a smaller terror radius anymore now that the fade and transition is faster.
---
Quentin falls asleep then abruptly wakes up and shakes his head
---
Right but I think that the post I replied to was stating people were hiding in lockers doing nothing to get that rank, which seems impossible due to the scoring system. 
---
Oh no this isn‚Äôt my psn lol it‚Äôs just for here . My survivor main is nea 
---
I mean, what can killer do aside from equipping demise if they see flashlights? Also why can't killer see cosmetics? What can they gain from knowing who has what cosmetic other than maybe they could tell who their obsession is a tiny bit easier.
---
Leader does not increase repair speed, just everything else. 
---
Ahh ok i see
---
Thanks, will give it a go :)
---
I mean im sure the odd person will run it but its still pointless, knowing a gen isnt regressing any more is good for cancer doc builds and basically thats it. You know survivors will be near gens being worked on anywhere, whispers is ten times more useful and does everything surveillance does 
---
Here you go

More fun than Freddy
---
The "killer mains" here are little cry babies. As a killer main that reaches rank 1 consistently, this was not such an advantage, i am not saying it is painful when you need noed to get a four kill and YouTube dont have it. If you relay on noed to kill people you should reconsider being a killer main. And judging by this subreddit lately, playing a videogame with friends is cancerous.
---
agreed 100%
---
True but people could still spend $$ 
---
Dead Hard becomes predictable as shit if you know the survivor has it. It's really not that bad.
---
We have Ada Min. Now I want Kate and David Redfield outfits. 
---
What if I told you it wasn't wasted if it got you 3 mins
---
Surveillance will be good on certain characters and builds really. Like maybe Hag with teleport to any trap build, and low terror radius killers like Pig, Wraith and Myers. Even a spirit with the quiet shifting add on. Honestly alot of kilelrs could use this. Billy because well he moves fast and Nurse as well.  Probably not a "good in any scenario" Perk though,
---
Jeff just makes a lot of noise while running
---
They're buffing Legion little by little instead of going forward with radical and untested buffs so that they don't end up being totally wack-ass busted.
---
I mean that during the halloween event, most survivors didnt play dbd, they just got nectar. The killer 4kd every game because no one was trying. Its probably one of the worst points in the games history it was so dull
---
And if some of them is somewhere in the Lery‚Äôs or behind some barrel at the Game? So easy 
---
I just ran it in a game and it was awesome, 2 of us were running prove thyself and leader after 2 gens we maxed points and they got finished so fast!
---
Yah it‚Äôs just compensation for the lost sacrifice points which should go to sacrifice in the first place. Only thing is idk where you‚Äôd get points as a survivor for a disconnected team mate. Survival category?
---
Just remove the ranking system, would fix the problem.
---
Rank 1 survivor here after like 100 h and i'm not even that good.
---
The system is broken

Towards the campfire to be sent to another trial.

Ps4 wait times in the past few days for me have been around 5 mins solo, 10+ in SWF at around rank 10.

dont do this to me
---
I think this is a Bug when wraith has sloppy butcher and after he hits you, you are squirting blood even if you are fully healed.
---
It's already been old for week but a'ight.
---
Agree and with some more game modes, it‚Äôd be lit
---
&gt;There's a shitload of better cosmetics for her now anyways
---
That's subjective so I don't think that's a good argument here. 
---
Pharmacy is fine, what are you talking about? Guarenteed you get strong healing when you need it, and you search chests really fast on top of that. Vigil does need some love though.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
I get facecamped pretty routinely when I do
---
Lol @ genius . To think i was being nice smh You‚Äôre anger speaks volumes üòÇ you‚Äôre sensitive asf and yes I do play killer I have gotten tea bagged many times before , it‚Äôs not that big of a deal just go kill them and if it‚Äôs at the end of the game while they are at the exit gates welp ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è fair game you can‚Äôt be mad  Bye. 
---
*tea bags you üòò
---
he knows
---
your going
---
to have
---
a bad time
---
If you take two perks just for healing you should heal fast I dont see a problem with it. The fact that right now I take two heal perks to still heal slow as fuck is bizzare. 
---
Well after testing it out this update is garbage. The new hook placements have ruined the game. Decisive Strike is damn near guarenteed now the hooks are so far apart. God help you if you down 2 survivors in the same area too.
---
Fuck the devs, I can't play this shit anymore if this is how it's going to be.
---
Does NOED proc with Feral Frenzy?
---
What about Exposed survivors? Are they downed when stabbed during Frenzy?
---
If it's in the game to use, then use it. I killer main but have my own strategies against the looping. If pallets are too much for the killer, then they should change how they play.
---
Btw, when you play Huntress the pallets are only good sometimes. Just throw an axe over it. Ez
---
It's meant to prevent basement blocking. But anywhere else is dumb. 
---
For me it depends on time of play, i find a lot of red ranks in my region play early so i play then.
---
If i play later i end up playing with a lot of greens.
---
I feel like match making is done via level and if that doesn't match then it matches via Ping
---
Something I've noticed when we SWF who ever starts the lobby his rank will be closer to the killer. don't know if its placebo but we find it pretty accurate.
---
Quicker fade in shouldn't hurt grabs too much and the bigger terror radius is only bigger by 4 meters. If anything you can use Distressing to switch between having a massive and then tiny terror radius on command.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsEkLGQthMk
---
Expect another cluster fuck. I'm also pissed that it looks like the badly needed secondary objectives are going to come in the form of an Event rather than being part of the base game. Great. 
---
So it's another "fuck you" to Killers. "Fuck you, use Ruin to slow down Survivors and/or use Billy or Nurse. We don't care that Survivor can get all the gens done in 4 minutes and the only reason you might kill 2 of them is that there's going to be one guy who plays like a retard. We don't care. Buy cosmetics. Buy the next Killer. See you next event."
---
Sad. 
---
&gt;team mates
---
This has never been a team game. Yes, you tend to profit more if you work together, but altruism is a choice. This highlights it.
---
I see at least 1 DC in most of my matches. It really screws us other survivors over and it's cost me a lot of games. I always feel like I have to apologise to the killer cause they get robbed of a game too. Most of the time they DC after being downed the first time. Like, there's loads of the match to go yet, why you quitting so soon? Losers.
---
I'm hoping dedicated servers will be able to punish people for this kind of behaviour.
---
totems spawns will be more diverse + we won't be able to see the perks a killer is running while the game is still happening are HUGE wins! those are two of the biggest complaints i've seen on this sub, so kudos to the devs for addressing them. 
---
y‚Äôall can stop replying lmfaooo it‚Äôs getting boring it was a bait post üôÑ. I could feel the heat coming from the post üòÇ  y‚Äôall easy ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è just want y‚Äôall to know. 
---
Insanely unfair but still get beaten on the regular when the Survivors are coordinated and know how to play.
---
Another Freddy nerf nice 
---
T-Bagging a T3 Myers at the exit gates vs when you get Tombstoned 
---
Exactly lmao. 
---
Ah, I used that in SWF a lot, that's understandable. I'm happy that's happening.
---
I have to ask, how do they avoid Blood Warden if they know about it? Genuinely asking. 
---
Ive recently started maining spirit, i love it! Being able to "teleport" keeps great pressure on the survivors, and they seem to have no idea how to escape me. Fine tuned my hearing too lol
---
She seems pretty neat I haven't seen her that much in survivor matches only the occasional spirit so I don't know much about her but I'll go look at her kit.  But a question when she uses her ability it says that she's blind does it mean that all you can see are scratch marks and nothing else or can you see the scratch marks and surroundings but just not the survivors?
---
Took me a month to do, I‚Äôd work on it every dat after school.
---
Lmao says killers have lag switching like it‚Äôs an in game mechanic smh. 
---
You could say she's a bit... Obsessed 
---
I only play against the occasional spirit but she definitely seems neat I'll go look at her kit 
---
EXACTLY!!
---
Well completely honestly, Freddy is one of my favorites in DBD. Im insulting him as much as stating facts. I‚Äôm excited for his buff.
---
When I‚Äôm playing survivor (usually SWF) a pet peeve of mine is people getting hooked and DCing when someone doesn‚Äôt start charging across the map instantly. I wish folk would have patience.
---
Ohh ma gaaad
---
:(
---
It has to fill up completely but as you know your movement speed is slowed while charging it so unless they are trying to spin juke right in your face you don‚Äôt want to hold it for any longer than you have to. It is very important to note though that people will often try and spin around in your face so that you release it when yo I are facing the wrong way and won‚Äôt be able to catch up to them before your attack ends. General rule of thumb, get within quick attack distance and start charging it, if they keep running forwards you‚Äôre still going to be right behind them so just let it go as soon as you can and hit them with it, if they try and spin around you then hold it until you have a grip on where he is and go hit him. And when I say quick attack distance I mean the survivor should be technically blocking you from moving forwards because he is touching you. If you get that close and have the skill to keep your camera on him then he‚Äôs not getting away unless he can get to a window or pallet before you start swinging because yes it slows you down but if you‚Äôre touching him when you start charging then you should be within a distance where your chainsaw hits him as soon as it starts because he‚Äôs still that close to you. It really feels like you don‚Äôt even slow down at all if your touching him, trust me.
---
Oh my stars, wasn't that Botany Knowledge?
---
Pokemon X and Y reference :P
---
Is that a perk?
---
Thanks dude.
---
I'm still doing terrible with him. he feels so clunky. lol.
---
Maybe not my type of killer.
---
they wont let you crouch in .3 seconds
---
SC change can go fuck itself, everything else seems good.
---
Non is the usual code (view up then down)
---
It‚Äôs same in low rank too??
---
I booted pd4 yesterday (usually pc for obvious better plays)
---
1 leaver,
---
Done 2 gens myself (solo gen as well)
---
Looped wraith for minutes because farm window infinite and jungle gyms
---
Eventually gets downed (despite 5 successful 360 in a row lol)
---
..then died in first hook as I see the remaining 2 survivors are getting chased by the wraith...like if one of you is chased.,rescue me maybe??
---
I pip obviously but I can‚Äôt vent my salt anywhere on PS4. Goddamn
---
Nah, feral frenzy hits don‚Äôt apply the exposed effect sadly. Legion would actually be quite a bit better if they did.
---
To my understanding, the front person is always the last survivor you had selected. The other three are random. 
---
As killer, 2. As survivor, 3. 
---
What does your personal experience have to do with the people I encounter? Are you just peacocking just cause you wanna be praised? 
---
Ebony Moris are not more common that green items. That's ridiculous. It was never a problem because I never encounter Ebonies when I play Survivor. I have a 5 stack on most Killers and I never use them unless I'm having a bad day.
---
I want this so fucking bad.
---
I want this so bad.
---
I never thought of it before but you make a good point. It is especially rough for those who got the game recently. It also seems more likely to get a dlc perk rather than a perk from a free "OG" character. I cant really complain either way I can see both sides, but I would like to see more perks in there. That or make it 3-4 days instead of 7 for resetting
---
KInda. Leader doesn't increase gen speed, and Prove Thyself can only work on once per gen. SO if im reading it right if 2 people with prove thyself are together, only one prove thyself would take effect.
---
What ? Am I missing something ?
---
That wasn‚Äôt even an opinion.
---
Will need another buff for sure to become meta. There's like almost no chance this replaces something like Enduring/Spirit Fury/Ruin in a meta build
---
Say whaaaat
---
Like I said, get in melee range and they can't outrun you
---
Sure does
---
or when you follow them to heal them and they just self care into sloppy butcher. like. okay.
---
Hmmm
---
As a rank 1 in both categories, I complain indiscriminately!
---
That's why the post is titled as Salt.
---
I finally got tired of all the bullshit from the game the past month and sorta let all my rage out
---
HELL yeah
---
*HEROIN*, adrenaline is a perk already
---
Never said they should? Just said it lowers the value of my previous favorite addon on her. Just stating an objective fact. That's all friend. 
---
Hitting on a gen while nodding your head usually indicates farming. You can additionally moonwalk with myers, keep bing bonging with wraith, keep setting on and off traps with trapper, teabag as pig etc. Success rates of the latter 4 might be low but first one is the general consensus of farming.
---
If a survivor gets downed by noed, they arent playing smart or just had bad luck which sometimes happens. A good killer can still down someone who uses DS. Just learn how to track. It's only 4 seconds if they have tier 3. If 4 people are running DS, 3 of them have to get the wiggle meter to 35-45% i believe and with iron grasp with is commonly used makes it a wasted perk slot with all the close hooks added into the game. A lot of people who bitch about these perks are trash. They arent bullshit perks, actually more situational. They just pay off more when the situation works out.
---
Meg is Spirit confirmed 
---
You‚Äôll eventually get it.
---
Here's hoping the update makes it to console
---
I mean, there‚Äôs like no tension or stress when playing as him, so I get why you would like him.
---
Until you get ganged up on by a 4 man SWF P3 Claudette group with 2 flashlights and 2 instakits :)
---
im only playing lf to get his bbq perk asap since this guy gives me like double bp of what i normally get lol
---
but yeah your right, billy seems better
---
Happy for you
---
This is only a slight tease on how the event is going to work, I say we wait for more details before assuming the worst. BHVR knew that the hallowed blight was a flop, i expect improvement
---
You don't know the coding that goes into the UI, though. Once again, it could just be the bar changing color because of the small speed gain. You wouldn't notice unless you timed it.
---
However, I agree with the rest of what you said.
---
Are his perks on console, or replacement types?
---
The patch notes said this is being tested and is likely not to make it into the game with the rest of the PTB.
---
Sure you do pal.Every game indeed.
---
? U think Sprint Burst was bad before? It's the best exhaustion perk lol
---
Hey, holding W takes a lot of skill.
---
It's surviving, easier than being a killer.
---
Also STILL buggy and dependent on ping. So many times lately I get hit and still see the exhaustion pop up
---
It's more of a joke and karma grab then me actually saying wow look at this badass all in good fun
---
Wonderful change, but it will probably not make it to the game because SWF mains will complain.
---
At least its balanced out by the fact that they're gonna be slower at healing their teammates
---
It might not even make it to the live version anyway
---
Jake's American
---
Ok just find literally ANY post about DS and NOED and see how wrong you are. I don‚Äôt want a big ass thread about it so lemme tell you to educate yourself. 
---
I think that's just because it's 3 images stitched together imperfectly
---
Once you get the gist of the spawns, yeah. I bet when you find those spots, you remember them, right?
---
I‚Äôm confused now. At first I thought that with the new changes they would remove the repair bonus. Is that true or no?
---
Sprint burst doesn‚Äôt relieve your exhaustion, it causes it. Also, as an ultra rare item, giving you that extra edge? Not so bad. 
---
Are you retarded or something?Who tf asks these questions?
---
And this part goes here....
---
-explosion and the killer appears out of nowhere- 
---
What have I done.
---
Legion doesn't need any more buffs lol. If you made it so that you had to heal against Legion they would probably be almost as strong as Nurse
---
You forgot smol billy
---
Actually, you're wrong. Use of third party software for an advantage is against policy and is bannable. The devs had to go out of their way to specifically white list comms **because** they constitute as cheating. Check the ToS posted on the official forums sometime. Comms are specifically white listed in the section on third party software because they classify, but BHVR has no balls. They'd rather rake in shit tons of cash from boosted SWF scrubs than protect the integrity of the experience and make a bit less money because some of the lazy casuals left.
---
And it literally does not matter what you consider cheating. Facts don't care about your opinions.
---
Now, I do feel I should clarify a few points. I don't mind SWF. I don't even particularly mind comms. My issue is with the individuals who abuse it. The ones who aren't just having a laugh with some friends but are constantly relaying information to each other that they *should not have.* Person A on the one edge of the map should not know that Person B on the other edge is being chased and just ran passed the Killer's Hex Ruin without use of in game mechanics. Shit like that is 100% cheating, period.
---
Their own fault for 3gen-ing themselves
---
NP, devs are gonna make it part of the base game soon, I mean, like over 50% of survivors use it when they want to tryhard, no reason not to, it gives you independence from other survivors, now it gives you no reason NOT to use it.
---
A survivor can be downed in less than a minute from a bad spawn. I get it will make the match quicker, but doesnt bbq do that with letting the killer know exactly where you are? Yes I know you can walk a certain way for a few seconds  and then back track but they still know your general direction. Pair that with whispers and there you go.
---
What in this clip was "bullshit"?
---
Its just babyrage that you didnt get the hatch imo
---
I'll just clear this lit Totem, Hope the Killer isnt near...
---
*Hex: Haunted Grounds*
---
Why are they buffing Legion? The character already has literally 0 counterplay if played properly, you cannot loop them like Nurse but it takes 0 skill to play Legion. Every "small" buff they give this killer just pushes them further and further toward being absolutely horribly unfun to play against
---
Yep is bbq, ok is reasonable to play lf but sincerly, he is not complex at all, he is just be on the back of a survivor very close and use chainsaw, his gameplays are not interesting at all so, what else can i say, u can run wharever perk do u want and its okay. 
---
Mate, it will be so nice to have bbq in hillbilly or nurse
---
Are they tailored for each survivor? Because if so, that‚Äôs super cool
---
Would be cool if the keys could be burned over totems and chests, not the exit gate though
---
"Totems aren't objectives"
---
Gets mad when NOED activates.
---
Naw, it'll make it in. It's just fair.
---
You forgot my hex totem, spawning next to a survivor
---
I can only hope.
---
Spine Chill does affect vaulting speed. With the buff to Leader, if anyone on your team has it and you get close to them it will apply a 25% vault speed buff for 25 seconds. Which is nice if you get chased off a gen and jump through a vault you will do it much faster.
---
I can't, I'm only rank 15.
---
You're misunderstanding i think, the change says "with the exception of repair speed, are *increased*" which means you still have your leader repair boost but everything else got boosted more.
---
&gt;Probe Thyself
---
Go on... ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Your delusional. If they WANTED in match communication they would have ADDED in match communication. Your argument is fucking ridiculous.
---
Hope is the perk that increases your running speed by 5/6/7% after the last gen is finished for 120 seconds. Hope is actually a very good perk for chases in the end game.
---
The perk that makes your scratch marks disappear 1/2/3 seconds earlier is called ‚ÄúLightweight‚Äù
---
Ask over on r/dbdgonewild
---
Perks will keep appearing until you get them.
---
Why?
---
Thought this was gonna be a meme about Whispers and how it's just as much of a time wasting perk as it is a good tracking perk.
---
Yeah I always mix them up for some reason. I'll edit it out, thanks. 
---
replacement types exist - they dont reference bill in anyway and the perk icons show a standard face rather than bill's face
---
I've literally tested both leader and spine chill in a KYF match. They do not increase vault speed.
---
I reached rank 1 the other day and really fucking regret it
---
Hopes his fans swallow it and defend him? What? Have you ever watched his content? He‚Äôs one of the most logical content creators we have right now. He mains killer but he understands the balance for both sides. Even if I didn‚Äôt like him, I would still find myself agreeing with most (but not all) of his suggestions. Because he makes sense and argues points to improve the overall enjoyability for both sides. Most other content creators only fight for their own side and it‚Äôs absolutely cringeworthy. Panda is realistic. 
---
F for the Freddy changes that were supposed to come last summer
---
Not when everyone is running SC...  
---
  
---
Now everyone heals themselves faster than if they healed each other, no reason NOT to use it.
---
I want acknowledgement that I earned them and didn‚Äôt fork over my neighbors stolen credit card. There should be a slight difference to differentiate between credit card gamers and those of us who are real gamers and earned it. 
---
This is amazing! Before you post any more, you might consider offering your services to a well known DBD streamer. I'm sure someone would love to have one of these animated guys on their channel.
---
Fuck you asshole.Have fun playing with 1 survivor when the rest dc.
---
If a survivor uses it, it is removed which was your point in the first comment and leaves them with 3 perks the rest of the game. Just because you get most totems doesnt mean the majority do. You cant base what other players do off of how you play.
---
It wouldn't make much sense otherwise, but hopefully it won't matter soon enough with buffs. Firecrackers can be seen as a wraith nerf because of the burn and he was once a weak killer but nobody cares because he's good now.
---
New graphics update changed the mist rendering system, so yes sort of
---
Might as well stay there. You have toxic slime ahead of you. Camping killers. Horrible survivors who farm each other then scream for 20 min in chat how the other is bad and should die. Death threats for using certain perks. What joy. And I swear the lag is worse. Maybe that's how killers rank up.
---
I will be an unstoppable force 
---
Frenzy applies no Exposed effects and we should be thankful it doesn‚Äôt with how easy it is to land a hit. 
---
No it doesn't. They removed the 9% boost for reparing gens.
---
As a survivor main that plays a lot SWF I think this is great, part of the fun for me at least is trying to figure out the perks the killer runs without someone telling me.
---
Yes, they are.
---
And seeing how you were downvoted a lot shows that the majority do not agree with you meaning what you say isnt automatically the truth.
---
I couldn't think of a more fitting name lol, especially when obviously taking inspiration from L4D
---
Self Care is a huge buff. Slap botany and you heal yourself at full speed. This is a BAD thing. 
---
Verbal abuse is absolutely toxic, and is what often gets players banned in other multiplayer games moreso than cheating.
---
I don't get why people are so excited for this, most decent survivors can tell what impactful perks a killer has fairly early on. The main difference I can see is SWF not being able to tell if a killer has noed until it procs but even then it's stupidly rare (in my experience anyway) for people to then go round and destroy all the totems before it does.
---
may I add it works on opening doors?
---
unless they changed it.
---
Wh what t does your personal experience have to do with others? You've been downvoted repeatedly, clearly others dont agree with you.
---
I'd love to see that, can you record? 
---
I love her 
---
You Loop him till he quits it or Hits it.
---
I prefere the way self care is now. You should be able to just take hits for no reason every 15 seconds.
---
if you hit them with the mallet, but if you rev the chainsaw they can get out of range easily because of the movement slow - thats why it need addons to be near instant vs. 10 sec wind up
---
I wont becouse its true
---
Yup. Its my favourite thing to do in the whole game. I focus on jumpscaring people.
---
If people are in the basement i just stand on the stairs arounsd the corner and give people heart attacks.
---
I once watched someone fully heal behind a wall then jump scare them as thwy camw out of it.
---
I totally agree, have the cosmetics have a small detail different between the earned and bought version that's still noticeable 
---
with all these changes, most importantly the Prove Thyself bonus BP addition, I'm kinda surprised they didn't give No One Left Behind a little love
---
Have you tried inviting them to VC or DMimg them? üëÄ 
---
Missed an opportunity to Rick-Roll
---
Ah, fair enough. It's just that message and match left an impression because they were some of the *worst* players I've ever met (as Killer, at least. Seems to be all I get as Survivor) despite all being purple/red ranks, and I had to go well out of my way to get to the end and *still* got salt for a 3k. Like, what? 
---
Was a mother's blessing map too, and yes, that's a nice instaheal they also have right there.
---
Oh, Hatred will haunt you for the last one on Tunneling.
---
You really ARE a Brave Lion
---
what else is new from the ptb?
---
BEST BOY GETS THE BEST ANIMATION HELL YEAH
---
Get in melee range, don't swing. Rev up your basic chainsaw and you will hit them if you don't start sidestepping. 
---
An important detail is to *almost* always hold only W and move only your mouse to direct yourself. 
---
Of course, don't be in the very edge of melee range. Get just a meter closer and I guarantee you can hit them. 
---
Waiting for DStrike...
---
Missing ur DStrike
---
Oh, that's good to know. I thought it's an overall image instead of cut and paste job.
---
Equip Deerstalker and slug the last two and find them that way. 
---
Of course he does. Hes been awake so long. Got to stay away from Freddy...
---
Let your downvotes educate you. Look how the top comment is about people tired of this arguement. The people who hate these perks are usually either trash or do not know how to deal with them. 
---
Awesome. Quentin has a sleepy animation, Laurie has a paranoid animation, Bill is grumpy
---
Cause fear is better with friends. 
---
You mean at any rank? 
---
Self-care is *mandatory* after this.
---
Self-care healing (old): 1 survivor busy for 32 seconds -&gt; **32** seconds total time spent healing.
---
Regular healing (old): 2 survivors busy for 16 seconds -&gt; **32** seconds total time spent healing.
---
Self-care healing (new): 1 survivor busy for 21 seconds -&gt; **21** seconds total time spent healing.
---
Regular healing w/ self-care equipped (new): 2 survivors busy for 21 seconds -&gt; **42** seconds total time spent healing.
---
Regular healing w/o self-care equipped (new): 2 survivors busy for 16 seconds -&gt; **32** seconds total time spent healing.
---
If you make your teammates heal you, you are wasting an extra 11-21 seconds of the team's time. You may as well walk up to a gen somebody's working on and blow a couple skillchecks in their face. And the more people run self-care, the more important it is for you run self-care, because if they're running self-care that's when it costs the team 21 seconds instead of 11 seconds.
---
This is one of those awful changes that reminds me the devs really don't understand this game. Self-care worked because it didn't affect the total time spent healing, it wasn't punishing either side, it was just an option for people to heal without grouping up or coordinating (important for solo queue). Now self-care is one of the best time-saving perks in the game, everyone should run self-care and never ever heal anyone else.
---
This new surveillance tells you when survivors touch a generator. There is no timer involved, just "if the generator is regressing then you will know when it's touched." Not only that but generators start the game white, which means the moment someone touches a generator you'll be on their ass. It's gonna be strong.
---
Good idea
---
Who even uses DS in 2019? 
---
*this post was made by the No Mither gang*
---
They should have PS4 and Xbox exclusive characters, then.
---
"Snake had a bad dream..."
---
I'm with you. Any change that encourages teamplay on survivors is welcome in my book.
---
I literally only play high. I smoke dabs though alot stronger than an edible. Needless to say I don't get scared or paranoid because of the tolerance to the game and the thc. Helps keep me relaxed and relieves my motion sickness. 
---
Two survivors using Prove Thyself will not stack, so only one survivor can benefit from that speed boost at a time.
---
I've been out of the loop. What were the changes to Surveillance?
---
Currently a Rank 1 survivor (ps4) and I was surprised at the camping killers. I figured Rank 1 would be a land of amazing games where killers hook you and go after other survivors instead of standing there staring at you. Boy was I wrong. I guess to get to rank 1, some people have to camp. 
---
You should check out Laurie, she looks so paranoid in her animation.  Poor girl really got spooked by Myers
---
That's why i main doc.
---
Just because they don't know they're siblings, doesn't automatically make them not siblings.
---
Yesssssssss. Sometimes I‚Äôm in DBD and try to look at the team roster by pressing TAB too. 
---
Nope I don't. The game was pretty enjoyable at 15-10
---
So you can hit a difficult skillcheck. Congratulations. What my experience has to do with others means nothing because I wasn‚Äôt saying my experiences meant anything to anyone else. Your first reply insinuated that my rank has anything to do with peoples ability to hit a small skillcheck as if people don‚Äôt make mistakes. 
---
Thank you! 
---
My only problem with the perk is that it can really make the game entirely different by the end, i think they need to make a change where maybe you can hit one (two if its leveled up) survivor(s) in to the dying state but it really ruins the game if your someone who likes to run the killer around. It makes it so if you did good at that you can sometimes be cucked over, in my opinion it just sorta puts a negative feeling at endgame because if you did really good all game, it could all be ruined by insta downing.
---
Oh yah
---
The time itl save is minimal. Youll he checking gens anyway as killer. Thats where you are already looking. I cant see it being a good replacement for any meta perks
---
Maybe a dumb question, but is it random who shows up on the main menu? Can you pick? I‚Äôm on PS4 so I‚Äôm probably a couple weeks away from finding out myself :(
---
It'd be nice (though difficult, I imagine) to have a Match History option that can update with killer perks post game. Satiate my curiosity to know killer perks without having to wait for the whole game to end (or hatch stand üòí ), do another game, check back later. 
---
so self care with botany and leader gonna be 90000%?
---
Nah Peter Parker 
---
Leaning? Isn‚Äôt 3rd person view enough?
---
And he's rank 14.. 
---
Text posts get removed
---
Yeah also a nice ruin, nurses, and bbq ur running there lol 
---
What was changed?
---
What is sandbagging? I think teabagging is hanging around the exit like a douche to tease killers but I don't know what sandbagging is. 
---
If the leak is accurate and there's only one Killer costume then the Killer side isn't going to bother to grind too much. Especially if you don't use Huntress at all. I know I don't give a fuck. 
---
somebody in the PTB post said that this change is to offset them fixing the bug where the 10% repair penalty for coop repair wasn't working, so in the end there actually isn't any repair speed difference between live and PTB.  
---
This would be good for people with less than 200 hours but once you have a main survivor and a main killer bloodpoints become a nonissue, I think the biggest issue is ranks 15-4/3 have a casual more laid back experience while ranks 2/1 play like a completely different game with everyone constantly and consistently running the same perks/add ons
---
I wiggle to entertain myself so you're argument is invalid.
---
Rank 1 is easier than rank 5
---
C H A N G E M Y M I N D
---
Yes he‚Äôs tired of the conversation, they are still bullshit. Even top tier survivors and killers get cucked by DS and NOED. 
---
Blockig a fellow survivor, throwing pallets in front of them.. Anything basically to get another survivor killed
---
Yeah then Franklins and LightBorn would be completely useless not every survivor nerf to survive needs a counter nerf for killers the starting screen gives need info also this survivor nerf isn‚Äôt that big and taking away something that big for a killer and only taking away something small away from survivor is pretty unfair 
---
What do you mean
---
We need MORE animations like this, more reasons to play a survivor outside of how they look.
---
yeah lemme just uhhh spend several minutes looking for all the totems and destroying giving the killer what is essentially a free ruin and thus probably better than if they got like one down off of noed before we find that one specific totem we need
---
Do u play on ps4, xbox or pc?
---
No one good at this game runs self care anymore anyway, it needs a buff 
---
Lol seriously your whining about toxicity when people literally just down voted a post 
---
The only change I notice people doing purely by seeing players and items is Franklins Demise and Shadowborn if people actually run that unironically. Not seeing the killers build and giving that information to your SWF group is a very welcome change because unless you have already figured their build out, that unknown perk/addons can still allow for reactive play that without that info, they wouldn‚Äôt make a move. 
---
Probably the best Nurse cosmetic so far
---
Not trying to argue but wasnt L4D on console as well? That's really confusing why they wouldnt put him on there. 
---
Cosmetics?????? Yeah fuck you killer you don‚Äôt get to see Nea‚Äôs new outfit. 
---
It was on Xbox 360 tho right?
---
McLean has said they're still coming. In Chapter 11 or 11's mid chapter.
---
It seems like the console commuties are dying slowly
---
They wouldn't have to do any licencing to use the mask though.
---
The whole reason that mask was chosen was because it was generic and easy to get. They don't own the rights to the mask.
---
Not whining - making a statement. Your comment is an example of the toxicity. Thanks for proving the point. 
---
What rank? Also with the ptb out rn normal que times are gonna be longer because of split playerbase
---
Yeah and PS3 I think but not PS4 and Xbone
---
now that's cool
---
as is your right 
---
(Sad Clown Main)
---
Normally we'll have 4 people in a group so we don't have to worry about inviting someone in
---
If that‚Äôs a legitimate rank 14 player my name is Mcote.
---
HAHAHAHAAHHAHAH OMG people need to do these kinds of memes more xD
---
They cancelled the ds nerf. They didn't like the stun in place idea they had so they gave up on changiit.
---
Its not that great in lower ranks but at high levels its amazing. With perfect survivors and perfect killers, wasting 15 seconds breaks the game
---
I‚Äôm surprised yet happy they were able to do this for the licensed characters. I can‚Äôt access the PTB so I hope someone posts some of the others.
---
Got it. Thanks. Survivors are douche bags lol. Or maybe the % of douche bag players is equal  but there are. 4x more survivors so it seems worse. 
---
That's so stupid. Especially considering 90 percent of 360 games are on xbox one now. Although i love pc console needs some love from valve too lmao. I used to play that shit daily with offlibe coop L4D
---
What kind of argument is that?
---
"This part of this game isn't very fun and I am otherwise enjoying myself"
---
"DON'T HAVE OPINIONS JUST PLAY THE GAME IN SILENCE, PRETEND THEY DON'T EXIST AND DON'T GIVE FEEDBACK BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO READ IT ON THE REDDIT"
---
But requires another perk slot.
---
No ptb on consoles
---
Going after the important issues
---
Well, seeing as the sibling storyline wasn't even thought of when the first film was made, I like to think that Myers was just a serial killer who'd go after anyone. 
---
It really depends on which storyline you want to be cannon yourself. I prefered the 2018 movie over part 2, so in my favorite timeline they're not siblings.
---
I hope you are joking, lmao.
---
Im rank 5 now after taking a break and my friends are 1's and 2's. But rank doesnt matter in this context because there is a GLARING difference between when the ques are working and when we have to wait 20 mins for a match at normal hours
---
Regardless, it will be very strong. 
---
Also keep in mind that this is an experimental change. If self care ends up being stronger because of this, they most likely won‚Äôt include it in the update. Self care is already widely used, so people won‚Äôt care about healing teammates if healing yourself becomes the stronger choice. Also keep in mind that if people are healing themselves, they won‚Äôt be together, not only making healing more punishing for the killer, but the killer is less likely to find multiple survivors in one area. 
---
I can see what they tried to do with self care but they haven‚Äôt gone about it the right way.  
---
There's actually two survivor costumes- Ace and Feng Min get an outfit. 
---
They're focused on making him fun to play as so they can sell more downloads of him.
---
Yeah ikr
---
The survivor closest to the camera will always be the survivor you had selected in your survivor menu, just like the killer.  The other 3 are always random.
---
Dedicated servers are coming. Hopefully that‚Äôll fix some of it. 
---
Which one? I'd be happy to make some gifs of these animations!
---
I posted some more if you would like to see
---
we need more perks like DS so killers get punished for killing survivors
---
But they aren't bullshit.
---
It will die if these que times dont get fixed , its not the player counts its something this company making tons of $$ off cosmetics cant seem to fix. Bet your ass theyll have another cosmetic next week though
---
I'm not basing what I do as what others do. I am saying what people should do (and what rank 1 actually do) to avoid NOED. Yes the gang mentality on Reddit is that NOED is OP and unfair, but it's really not if you actually prepare and predict it, and then react to it instead of repeatedly getting insta downed and crying about it on Reddit.
---
I‚Äôll give it a day until someone makes another SWFs is unfair post... 
---
Where did you find Resilience and Spine Chill no longer affecting vault speeds? I didn‚Äôt see it in the ptach notes listed here.
---
My addiction to BP is stronger than any salt I might have from getting looped.
---
Looks like calm spirit just got that much better 
---
Checkmate, SWF teams.
---
It takes a lot of time to rank up. If you pipped every game, it would take 85 games to get to rank 1 from 20.
---
If every game is around ~15-20m, we can easily say that it takes anywhere from 20-60 hours per month of playtime to get to rank 1 (depending on if you started at rank 10 or rank 16 aftee a rank reset). 
---
For someone that doesnt play the game consistently, this can take long enough that the next reset hits before reaching rank 1.
---
They were working though , its like its off and on. When i get on and join the party first question i ask is are the ques fucked up tonight? "yea they are " - friend 
---
Don't play with friends? Solo queues are instant for me. It's only an issue when i try to group up.
---
Pc post game chat would like show you true bad sports lol
---
I'm not saying run everywhere but these kids are getting rank 1 just crouching everywhere and not helping teammates, they clearly dont understand the mechanics, and when to run.
---
It's worse than you think.
---
The new self-care is 21 seconds. Being healed by a teammate takes either 21 seconds or 16 seconds depending on whether or not they have self-care. But self-care only wastes *one* survivor's time, being healed by a teammate wastes *two* survivor's time.
---
New self-care saves *the team as a whole* 11 seconds over healing your teammates without self-care - and that's 11 seconds per health state healed, the entire game. 4x self-care is worth 1-2 generators.
---
Self-care is probably the best survivor perk in the game after these changes.
---
Thanks
---
Either matchmaking is bugged or there aren‚Äôt enough killers at high ranks on PS4 currently. I keep running into the same killers so I‚Äôm tempted to say it‚Äôs the latter, but that‚Äôs purely anecdotal. Considering how poor the PS4 killer experience is at the moment I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised though. 
---
some people had it since forever, they never got banned so you're probably fine
---
That or removing the speed boost would probably get rid of most of the salt actually. Then it's just the folk who'll never be happy. 
---
Nice. Thanks for posting a screenshot! 
---
It would be so damn great if they add facial expression to survivors depending on the situation.
---
I've got bored to see my detective tapp with that same face that he makes while working on a gen and hanging on a hook
---
Nea:Hey claud, what were you up to?
---
Claudette:DoInG gEnS, yOu?
---
Nea:*looks at the claudette
---
Adam:*also looks at the claudette
---
I got facecamped for simply saving two of my teammates from the basement :/
---
What a shitty suggestion , I play this game to play with friends not solo que. How about this company fix their shit que times. 
---
losing. you shouldn't be rewarded for losing.
---
you got caught out of position or couldn't find a loop in time? DS, then run to that loop.
---
you got genrushed because you tunnel-visioned that one survivor all game or you got genrushed because you never even tried to mindgame and just broke every pallet? NOED, then get like 2 kills off of it.
---
Well of course I was downvoted, the gang mentality of r/dbd on Reddit is that NOED is unfair and OP. Regardless of what I say, that will probably stay the same and a lot of Redditers are sick of the relentless NOED complaints. 
---
That doesn't dismiss my argument that NOED is actually quite preventable if you predict NOED and can be easily removed after triggered if survivors just look for the totem. 
---
People will say I'm wrong though, because they want to continue believing NOED is broken. That's fine.
---
Yep. Like, you can guess some perks during the match, but not all. And some, like Discordance, you can't be entirely certain of. And then some rely on being a surprise. NOED, Blood Warden, Devour Hope, etc.
---
Sadly not always true. I had it where the only way to win was to go back and find the hatch. Thankfully the killer let me out
---
PCMR
---
All i'm saying is see if you get fast solo matches before blaming the devs.
---
Its not that i promise you , there is a huge difference when the ques are working and when we have to wait 20 mins for ques.
---
Or when a group of 4 people has to wait longer to find a killer than a solo que which makes 0 sense
---
Naw Legion just hops over it nbd
---
&gt; don't end up being totally wack-ass busted
---
I mean, the can't make them more busted than they already are.
---
Devour hope ruin thrill of the hunt and either haunted ground nurses or sloppy butcher better than Billy any day

*All survivors* : become Cole Phelps

I agree with this

Rank 11.
---
It's not Rank 1 but still.
---
1 upvote for you to fight off the swf downvoters coming.
---
That makes sense. You don‚Äôt start hating the perks until you get to around rank 6 or so. They are beyond infuriating though. 
---
Love Bill's position
---
Lol that doesnt even work most of the time, if survivors do that they get hit 90% of the time
---
Include an example
---
I give all the thanks to a killer who is chill, more respect to all you killers out there that have let me escape or give apologies for the horrible ones who DC on the killers.
---
Respect for something you didn't really need to do üëç
---
Probably, but I still don't think it's broken.
---
They don‚Äôt like reposts either
---
How does it suck for solo? Once you're dead there's no benefit to knowing what perks and addons the killer had.
---
The correct play now is to 4x self-care and never heal anyone else ever.
---
Self-care: 1 survivor, 21 seconds, 21 total seconds survivor time.
---
Healing others w/ self-care equipped: 2 survivors, 21 seconds each, 42 total seconds survivor time.
---
Healing others w/o self-care equipped: 2 survivors, 16 seconds each, 32 total seconds survivor time. (Incidentally, this is also the time healing took before - 1 survivor self-caring, 32 seconds; one survivor healing the second, 16 seconds each, 32 total seconds).
---
So 4x self-care and "altruism is for noobs" will save your team 11 seconds per health state healed. Needing a teammate to heal you is like joining someone on a gen and then blowing a couple skillchecks in their face.
---
but healing speeds are doubled too  
---
Use it to lock another survivor in a locker
---
As a Bill main, I never understood why survivors think the killer has to let them go &gt;_&gt;
---
Stay at your rank though. High ranks is nothing but cancer and long queue times. 
---
I see where you are coming from. I think the question that needs to be asked is what should the average game look like? Whether it be a 2k, 3k, or 4k. The game should be fun for all. I think they need to figure how to incentivize both sides in a way that is fun gameplay for all. But that is the impossible there. My main beef with it is I enjoy survivor the most, but if I want to grind bloodpoints I play killer cause I seem to make way more points.
---
Having spent some time mulling this over, no: I do not have any ideas. That said, you are correct: green keys are useless.
---
So terrible for him to run 4 meta perks to the 12 he's up against üôÑ
---
I usually wiggle if I‚Äôm bored and waiting to get unhooked 
---
Old self-care was 24 seconds. It's now more powerful than ever.
---
How do the devs consistently come up with such bad ideas?
---
WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELDS MOTHERFUCKER
---
- Any survivor who steps into corn immediately gets moried
---
The prove thyself change might give the chance to fix that tho.
---
Thanks for the compliment 
---
Shrine is in one hour afaik. 
---
It might be that there aren't enough Killers on PS4 because every time I can get a game instantly as a killer on the PS4.  Survivor I know I'll have to do some waiting.
---
Why the downvotes? Ur right, sprint burst was already really really good. 
---
Maybe find something that's not on the sub yet?
---
While it is a lot more fun for you, it's still very unfair for the killer. 
---
I really like the impossible skill checks. Distressing, unnerving presence, hex: ruin, and overcharge.
---
Addons are entirely personal choice, however the calm addons work the best to me
---
killers cant play without their crutch noed anyways
---
Yup... Sigh... 
---
Well DS is overrated by killer mains, they act like it‚Äôs an unstoppable perk.  I regularly stomp people with or without DS...bring on swf, I ain‚Äôt scared 
---
This is where you got to have situational awareness during the match, if the killer isn't messing with you all that much during you fixing gens.
---
They just might have NOED, plan accordingly.
---
So let‚Äôs say if there‚Äôs no voice com just game chat what happens if their friends die ? 
---
doesn't matter, killers cant play without their crutch noed anyways
---
Snipe Doc. Ruin, Devour Hope, Haunted Grounds and Thrill of the Hunt. The add on that turns your shock into a beam and the other add on whatevee you prefer. 
---
Three scenarios 1 killer has 500 ping and gets a 4k without skill 2 the killer trash and chases me the entire game 3 the killer is actually good and gets multiple hooks instead of one kill at the end
---
Would you mind if I used this as my discord avatar ?
---
who needs more cosmetics when you have the best jacket in the game
---
more shitty reposts/recycled memes
---
So basically I suffer from teammates being selfish, even if I bring shit like pharmacy or bond to be more efficient
---
I mean, I only did like 2 ambush hits, so that was kinda expected
---
No they mean when you escape or die, you can‚Äôt see the killer‚Äôs perks in the end screen until the actual match has ended. Pretty much a nerf for swf
---
The only way to get max survival is to self care or snap out of madness 3 atleast 15 times
---
Quentin mains unite!
---
Legitimately wondering, what's wrong with crouching when moving to gens and losing the killer
---
Its nothing special
---
For prove thyself is it only repair bonus where one person gets the points or is it the coop bonus points as well?
---
"the name itself implies a certain selfishness."  
---
I don't see how that's in any way selfish. You're supposed to put your well being first before you do anything for anybody else. 
---
Wait times are crazy ling for solo too. I had to wait about 20 minutes only to have the killer lobby dodge right away. I'm not even in red ranks currently and it seems everybody I've talked to has this problem, no matter what rank they are. As soon as the game got reverted back from the winter solstice, matchmaking was suddenly fucked.
---
You gotta pass them the good shit somehow. 
---
More like they don't want to piss off the crybabies who use their DS crutch. 
---
Yea
---
oh i play with you often, im assuming youre us west as well.
---
Killers have always gotten games quick or instant on ps4 . 
---
You can tell its an issue because as a solo que or with 1 other person you get in a match quick but once its 3 or 4 it takes years
---
This pleases me.
---
What were they trying to do? Because I don't see it.
---
When a survivor dies and goes to the end match screen, they are able to see everyone's perks, including the killer. This is unbalanced with SWF groups because if one person dies, they can tell the rest of their teammates what perks or moris the killer is running. The change with PTB no longer allows you to view killer perks until the whole game ends. 
---
yup

I'm on Xbox and I'm working fine.

It‚Äôs weird no one is talking about Leader + Self Care. I run both commonly and now will have 25% faster self heal and no penalty to others heals. 
---
maps are good, the worst thing to get from a chest is a broken key
---
Tapp mains IRL
---
I know, thats why I asked for this game  specifically and how it decides to ban.
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
It looks like they wanted to make it a perk that gives you a reliable self heal, but makes you heal others slower than you normally would. It would become more of a selfish perk to take, sacrificing altruism for self preservation. They tried to give it a downside for its strong effect but the downside doesn‚Äôt really matter because it‚Äôs technically just a stronger self care. 
---
It happens with almost all of her top cosmetics that don't go past the shorts. I think the forgot to add in a bit of stomach when designing the cosmetics, which is a shame, because you can't conbine the shorts with a lot of cosmetics because of it..
---
I mean even if that were true, and I'd disagree strongly that it is, that doesn't change his joke? Like even if 1% of the population were the ones complaining about noed it's still easy to understand who he is mocking.
---
Like you can easily say his joke is dumb, but this just makes you look silly.
---
Fair enough
---
Just 99% the self-care bar.
---
Not unreasonable if you do it yourself, as I do.
---
Green key is definitely the worst. Green map at least gives 150 points for each Gen you find. Green key does nothing. 
---
BACK TO SPIES - IRON GRIP - AGITATION - BRUTAL STRENGTH TRAPPER JUST LIKE OLD TIMES

ahh sorry thanks i didn't know about this. :&lt; And yes on PC.

Why am i an asshole now?

Good god that would be so overpowered. If it were like that and nurse‚Äôs calling worked while mending then Legion would be the best killer in the game. 
---
&gt;The pig TR is probably just to make it more consistent. Either 32/24/16. Having it at 28 was kinda weird

I asked the Design team and that is exactly the answer I got. Good one!

---
What does Laurie Strode do for her animation?
---
I don't know why, but I read that in a flat robotic voice. 
---
Yah that‚Äôs true. 
---
And majority of survivor mains can‚Äôt play without their clutch perks of either self care, adrenaline or DS
---
That's a good change! Now we need the killer not to see if the survivors take items
---
Punctuation
---
You wouldn't be able to boot the game if those files were included in EasyAntiCheat's scan. 
---
Well I Urban Evasion everywhere because I don‚Äôt wanna use my Sprint Burst unless I have to lol. 
---
Exactly. See?? I knew it was an act. There's no way some one who could feed themselves without help could honestly be stumped on how third-party voice programs are competitive advantages. 
---
Someone‚Äôs used up brown medkit/toolbox
---
Look around paranoid 
---
Dull totems are objectives as well, and trust me a 4 stack of good survivors will get 3 or more out in very high % of games played at rank 1 and even more at lower ranks.
---
DC. So he should probably avoid the trains regardless.
---
Of course.

Praise!

I noticed that when a survivor failed my overcharge, they got the same blood effect as when failing a skill-check to wake up from the dream world.
---
and well I actually play on ps4 so I don't use third-party voice, I just use party chat on my console. 
---
Alert doesn‚Äôt reveal Freddy unless you‚Äôre in the dream world, but I‚Äôm fairly sure it does show the location of a cloaked Wraith or a crouched Pig (unless it‚Äôs changed since the last time I used it).
---
Who is fighting anything? It's just to be ironic. Appreciate it or dont. The end. 
---
They changed self care to address the sloppy butcher meta. Now healing thru it is actually viable. 
---
Kate's and Laurie's have been uploaded! I feel so bad for Laurie, she seems the most scared out of all of them.
---
 I think the question that needs to be asked is what should the average game look like? Whether it be a 2k, 3k, or 4k. The game should be fun for all.

My main beef with it is I enjoy survivor the most, but if I want to grind bloodpoints I play killer cause I seem to make way more points.

P3 Claudette is the final form of any survivor. The truly invisible element, acting from the shadows, healing your victims, repairing your gens, all hidden in plain sight against a garbage can right in front of you
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ady6lx/laurie_is_worried/) you go
---
That is fine. 
---
But watching someone that knows everything about looping, positioning, tactics, killer's power and most of their addons and tactics which still is playing at rank 15 is just pathetic. 
---
It is like kicking around a kid because he can't fight back to show how powerful you are. 
---
I mean my swf group usually calls it before I inevitably die first because I'm fucking killer candy. (No really. Every swf game. I am found smacked and hooked first. I'm CURSED) 
---
Yeah because voice comms aren‚Äôt in the game it means it‚Äôs cheating to use it except the devs have never stated so themselves? And if it was cheating it should be a bannable offense and i‚Äôve yet to see anyone be banned over it. They literally made swf to cater to people that want to use comms and here you guys are trying to claim otherwise. 
---
You can‚Äôt claim the post game screen is meant for survivors for one purpose only and can‚Äôt be used for another when that hasn‚Äôt ever been the case, nor stated anywhere. They‚Äôre only changing it with this patch. 
---
Just to be sure the kick of a gen makes it white UNTIL it‚Äôs touched right? No more timers?
---
I just started with killers in the game so I may not get the whole case against SWF, I do have met some and sometimes it's a toxic fest and sometimes I get okay matches against those. But let's hope balancing comes faster than this change came!
---
Any tips on how to play spirit?I just got her and I like her ability but I just don‚Äôt know how to correctly use it and make the most out of it.

Doesn't proc enough to be useful at all. Just played a few games as killer and that 48 meter limit is the death of it.

I always wondered why they have such a small shrine with so many perks, yet they feature overcharge and alert every other week
---
Wow if this is true then its a lot different from the meta on PC
---
Where does it state that? 
---
Oh, so the shorts are the main problem? Well, that's weird :o
---
Sony PartyChat‚Ñ¢ is third-party, though it's ease-of-use is probably why it's easy for BHVR to turn a blind eye to every voice app.
---
I mean that's your opinion, but I don't really agree with you. I'm a survivor main, and I avoid this sub most of the time cause of all the shitty survivor main bias here.
---
Which of us is right? Impossible to know, but neither of us should act like we do.
---
we are all quentin on this blessed day :)
---
Lol I dont take what strangers on the internet say personally. 
---
I'm trolling you, xD 
---
Lol
---
Cute
---
Yup, it happens with her crop top from the gipsy set as well.
---
The wording is a bit confusing. From what I can tell it sounds like you get the action speed on top of the repair speed, but I can't say for sure. 
---
This could be abused in so many ways it scares me. Appreciate the effort tho.
---
AAA Feng Min‚Äôs outfit!! Condragulations, you‚Äôre the winner of this week‚Äôs cosmetics.
---
yeah, just like people counter other perks by cleansing all dull totems or running in different direction/hiding behind gen after a hook (they don't)
---
also if you're injured at the gate you don't want to leave it at 99% on the off chance that killer might be using bloodwarden
---
and it's a Freddy perk, it won't get popular that fast outside rank 1 even if it becomes meta for some reason 
---
Thats a good one
---
I dont play the game because of the terrible fps on console but when i did the same thing happened to me its like most of the rank one players have massive egos for no reason and you get hate mail if you use any perk they deem as cheap, im a freddy main and i use noed and the number of players using decisive and complaining that i use noed is unreal
---
Clearly you don‚Äôt understand what trolling is. Can‚Äôt wait for the day all these 13 y/o‚Äôs reach puberty lmfao
---
Increased repair hearing distance is going to be a massive boost for killers. Imagine Myers/Legion/Hag with Monitor and Abuse being able to hear you before they‚Äôre even close enough for you to hear his heartbeat.
---
They clearly want Ambush to be used more often, the buffs there are nice, but they comes at the expense of The Pig's already-poor map pressure since they increased the terror radius and you'll presumably be spending more time crouching. 
---
Another stealth survivor buff. What a surprise.
---
I have to say I've just had my first survivor game now and this feels stupid. At one point me and a Feng - both injured - found each other. I thought about healing her and then realized there's literally no point. We might as well just stand there and heal ourselves. It was so bizarre to get used to.
---
I think there needs to be a benefit to being healed by another survivor as its harder to do.
---
It's treason then
---
Im glad all these changes are PTB. Some of them are gonna be super broken and hopefully get adjusted before the final patch.
---
You should, they're pretty good. Or if you want a cut down, kill countier version of the saw franchise, look up "Dead meat saw kill count " or something like that, they're pretty good too 
---
I'm loving this new feature too, they seem to be making Killers/Survivors feel more ''alive'' recently, as Clown was the first Killer to have facial animations and then the Spirit took that and made it even better, I didn't knew about Jeff's eyebrows, that was an interesting detail!
---
Kate must be hating how she lost her guitar... At least she can still sing though.

So if he didn't spend any money on a already paid game, he shouldn't stream it. Wow, you're rude as fuck dude. Also, you're*
---
So alleged guilt is just enough for wishing somebody to rot in jail? 
---
Voice chat. A killer cannot compensate for voice chat at higher ranks. And if you don't try to kill four why are you playing killer? That is why the game is "toxic" because people like you insist that the killers have to play by a code and that despite paying their money to have the game you insist they play it your way.
---
Perhaps you should stop moderating other players behavior and look at yours. If fun is the survivors always "winning" then you have a poor idea of what the game is about.
---
DBD
---
As a killer main i feel more fucked over tbh they removed my blood lust and my thick fog. Though its mainly bloodlust im upset about as a wraith its the only way i can beat loopers
---
Jake is Asian American though.
---
Not sure about the SC change. The Survivor side of me is loving this change because I also run BK.  The Killer side of me, however, is hating this change and praying that it stays in the PTB.
---
Why was Iron Maiden nerfed? Did it really need the location reveal to be shortened?
---
How are the new hook placements? I‚Äôm worried that if I down multiple Survivors near a hook, I will not be able to hook one of them. 
---
I‚Äôm really liking everything else, nice job BHVR! 
---
So first you need to bring a nearly useless perk to counter a perk that might not even exist in the game you're playing, then you need to do absolutely nothing but flawlessly sneak around the map, getting every single totem without being seen, while your teammates all get gens (and not getting caught, because that would cut your workforce in half), and then survive to endgame to make sure that all you work actually mattered.
---
Am I right?
---
Report the guy, what he did is bannable so yeah.
---
I uploaded links to every survivor here: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/adys7r/the_new_campfire_idle_animations_are_awesome/?st=jqoexyay&amp;sh=89ec4b73
---
Not every killer is for everyone.
---
I stick to Myers, Pig and Leatherface myself. Don't really touch many of the others.
---
We all have our preferred playstyle. Just gotta find the killer that befits yours :)
---
Killer is an uphill battle? Lol really?
---
Nothing too exciting in my opinion.
---
She must have lost it when she was dragged into the Entity's realm, she probably still can sing though.
---
Adrenaline (this) + Adrenaline (perk) + anti-hemorrhagi syringe + putrid serum + deja vu = drug overdose
---
I love a good challenge. Sometimes its quite easy to figure out what the killer is running though. Just gotta really pay attention. 
---
Such nice animations! Make them all seem more alive.
---
Have you watched how easy it is to troll killers and bombard them? It's not hard to make a game miserable for killers. The worst annoyance killers can do is drag the game out for longer. Even then it's variable, and sometimes amounts to less than ten seconds in game. But sure, be tone deaf.
---
If the entity‚Äôs willing to provide the survivors with Christmas firecrackers you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd have the decency to get her a guitar, huh.
---
Is it just me or is this PTB... not that big really. 
---
It fixes bugs and adds new ones as always. Couple minor balance things. 
---
Only thing that is worth testing are last 2 things. 
---
The devs literally designed this game to be played between people who can't communicate, they've stated so themselves. Plus, they put in SWF to stop people from complaining that they can't play with their friends, not to give people incentive to use voice chat. 
---
In case you haven't noticed, voice comms aren't in the game. Which leads to the next point: the post-game screen is meant to tell individual people what the killer and other survivors were playing. Not for one dead SWF to read off what the killer has to his or her buddies. Full stop. That's always been the intention, the devs are only just changing it now to force SWF to stop relaying the killer's build to each other.
---
It makes me so happy too! It makes them all feel so more alive.
---
The new spirit outfits jc... I can't handle it 
---
Benedict stuck his hand into it and it didn't burn him so IDK how Tapp's gonna get warmth from it 
---
Why are the imgur links always linked incorrectly?
---
That outfit looks so beautiful. Easily one of the best in the game
---
Good changes, but I'd also like to see tweaks to the RBT. 
---
I had a similar instant, let the guy crawl out, he replied "I juked you while crawling, hahahahaha"
---
Next time ima just hook em 
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah especially at high levels you know it‚Äôs gonna be a mix of the same 5-7 perks so there‚Äôs no guesswork there. 
---
Is it really taking advantage if you lose one of your teammates? Now you're at a disadvantage as the survivors.  -\('-')/- something something strength in numbers.
---
Noed
