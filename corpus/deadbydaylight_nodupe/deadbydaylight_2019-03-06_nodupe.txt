Nope, she is 115% fam.

---
did they died?
---
It was indeed a joke. It has no relevance and that's why I said it, thus where the joke part comes into play.
---
you are making me cry again :c

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Reminds me how the ranks are bugged at the end screen showing you the rank you would have if you got the pips again you just gained.
---
That‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not each individual legions fault... I just don‚Äôt see how dcing is the way
---
I find many of the killers annoying as hell, but I‚Äôm not going to selfishly dc just because I get downed once. It‚Äôs not good for the community I have an excuse of ‚Äúlegion is boring/unfunny/bullshit, so I can dc ‚Äú. 
---
It ruins your teams chances (or drastically reduces them) and the killer still gets points for you, so you‚Äôre not really hurting them, only making their life easier. But sure people will be people and stay selfish because they have an unfun trial, I guess? 
---
Appreciate the comment btw, respect everyone‚Äôs opinion, but I can‚Äôt get behind a dc, for the survivor and killer sake
---
It's not about anger, just that Legion isn't fun to play against
---
You have the same nose, holy cow. See nothing wrong here. 
---
On one of the devs twitter they have stated when the survivors are fully sick they are injured and have the broken effect. Also a bunch of tidbits of info too, such as being continually hit with the vomit speeds up the sickness, etc.
---
I've played more Spirit than any other Killer and I had no idea that's how the audio effect worked. Does that mean that perks such as Monitor and Abuse actually be bad, or at least suboptimal on her?
---
After years and years of skinny ass surviors we are excited ok 
---
The Cloak
---
The Cowled
---
The Diseased
---
The Healer
---
The Pox
---
The Purifier
---
The Repenter
---
The Plenty of other shit to call him, not that I necessarily want a Plague Doctor as I don‚Äôt find the concept particularly interesting.
---
This picture makes it look more like a closet. 
---
That doesn‚Äôt excuse dc though... 
---
I mean I guess they can do whatever they want, but it‚Äôs silly and very selfish. 
---
Many people I know hate facing Freddy or doctor as well, should we dc every time we fight one of them as well? 
---
They have to be killed. I'm pretty sure the only thing that doesn't count is a DC
---
Yea and that‚Äôs fair I‚Äôm just p3 hag and huntress so I understand them really well also why did I get downvoted?
---
Which is why I questioned whether or not it was, either way that should let you know it was an unsuccessful one. Honestly I still think it wasn‚Äôt and you‚Äôre backtracking solely because I brought up the possibility. Thanks for clarifying though.
---
Drop all levels please. It was already an issue what value to change on different levels + a level 50 character will actually be almost perked out. Give rewards for those who already grinded them.

That oatmeal got nothing on her.
---
Lmao
---
You forget crouching with pig at an exit gate with BloodWarden = let's get 'em.
---
Thank you! Yeah I was mimicking the style they used to draw the perk. But that is a pretty fabulous pose so... maybe it is a closet? *wink wink*
---
Well they definitely make ‚Äòem OP and then nerf them. This one comes with 115, anti-gen, and a projectile ability. So yeah, I agree, it certainly looks that way. I think she‚Äôll be The (Plague) Doctor 2.0.
---
What's the wooooshing radius of the spirit in phase walk?
---
I think you are mixing up thot with god 
---
This is amazing I want this!
---
These are so cute, especially the Pig (I might be slightly biased on that one though since I think she‚Äôs ridiculously adorable to begin with). Well done!
---
Is there usually a sale on older dlc b4 release of new chapter? or am I waiting needlessly 
---
I think it would be fine because your radius increases in chase (which my mind game example you would be in).
---
And the sound effect itself isn't directional as far as I can tell (at least not easily) so even if a survivor heard it, the odds they successfully find the right angle to hide is slim imo. 
---
I‚Äôve seen many times where the killer has gotten 4k‚Äôs from camping. Especially against over altruistic swf. There‚Äôs also many times where I could have easily stomped a team if I were to have just tunneled the already injured player. Idk, having stats would definitely be intriguing but I‚Äôm not sure if keeping stats would fall in line with how this game is played 
---
I am a survivor main but trust me I know it's wrong to balance around kills, finished chases might be a better idea. Also you need to consider when nerfing survivors that the reason they have a better time is that non busy survivors can just afk on gens. What I'm trying to say is don't touch the chase mechanics, change the objectives for the ones that are not in a chase first.
---
If you‚Äôd stream on twitch I‚Äôd be more likely to watch
---
You are pretty,she is not XD P.S This in my opinion
---
Did I miss something? All looks normal to me.
---
You‚Äôre talking about a different perk.
---
That was a piss poor implementation of side objectives.
---
Can you elaborate on that point? 
---
F
---
Yeah, I was being cheeky. It is fantastic and an amazing rendition. 
---
Thank you very much,  I appreciate it ^_^ 
---
Is the bottom one blood warden?
---
It makes coming out of the closet so much BETTER!
---
I mean, god forbid they just have carnival stuff be the focus of the map rather than 5 of the 70 tiles lol
---
Cursed image
---
Adrenaline is a solid perk to get you some clutch plays and to speed to the exit gate after the final gen - it's a great perk if you can make it to the end of the match most of the time
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs one sided. I‚Äôm saying, and have commented to my gf, the game design illicits saltiness all around to the point where you have to go out of your way to not upset someone.
---
Exploits are exploits and anyone who uses them will always be considered a dick. That‚Äôs a given. But using things intentionally meant to be used in game is just the nature of all competitive games. At this point I expect NOED and DS. It‚Äôs just more to play around. Idk, maybe my stance will change as I play more. I‚Äôm a level 10 survivor and the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù killer behavior tends to go down the higher I‚Äôve gone. Aside from that Leatherface who hooked me in basement and sat there, while it sucked I mean he got genrushed and everyone else got out so it‚Äôs whatever. I‚Äôm level 11 as killer and it does feel incredibly more annoying the better the survivors get, but it‚Äôs just game design.    
---
Yeah, they've added things for survivors to do that aren't gens and everyone just complains that they're taking time away from doing gens. Totems for NOED, legion mend, doctor madness, etc. I bet if healing from the plague's vomit takes too long people will complain that that's boring, too. The majority of people just *say* they want more things to do.
---
And trust *me*, ask any killer if they feel better about getting 8 evenly spread hooks and no kills or 6 focused hooks and 2 kills, they'll all take the kills. Intentional or not, everyone who plays killer thinks the goal of the game is to get kills. 0k and 1k games just feel like shit no matter how you slice it.
---
Go to McDonalds, buy like 10 Big Macs, and eat them back to back. You‚Äôll be juuuust like JaneüòÇ

---
Are you looking for tips and tricks? Or summaries on the game, survivors, etc?
---
If you're looking for tips or info on killers I think Brickyplays on YouTube did a very good job for his casefiles series. OhTofu has some good videos as well like learning looping, how tiles work, etc.
---
this is genuinely a very cool drawing, the shading &amp; colors are just so pleasant to look at... great job! :)
---
People used to. When I streamed I'd have to stop playing with certain people, they would DC every time they got a killer they dont like. 
---
Yes it's silly and selfish, but if I only have so much time to play after work I want to have fun. I assume that other people are playing to have fun too
---
For some reason people hate rational discussion of complex topics here. Sorry they downvoted this post so much, I had planned to say something like this too, because she obvi looks OP. Even though nobody here has actually played her yet, anyone who watched the Twitch stream and has a functional brain should be like, ‚Äúhmmm, I‚Äôm a little concerned.‚Äù Healthy doses of skepticism fortified on corroborative research that has undergone vetting (which is currently inpossible in this case) are wonderful but unfortunately they don‚Äôt seem to be that contagious.
---
It‚Äôs bamboozle.

Ok thanks for sharing.

---
Is bamboozle worth it 
---
Unless you‚Äôre talking about licensed killers every single killer or survivor realistically fits in the time period they are from unless you‚Äôre referring to their powers, which are almost always granted by the entity. They aren‚Äôt going to change things drastically from real world history, the Babylonian plague, government electro-torture/experimentation, psychic wards with nurses that go mentally insane, and so on are all realistic. As for the supernatural like Hag many movies/shows delve into the occult but still retain historical accuracy. I said they are trying to remain somewhat realistic in terms of historical accuracy not 100%, which nearly nothing in entertainment ever is. 
---
Bamboozle has already been on the shrine a few months ago.
---
Let‚Äôs go. I‚Äôll take my 150,000 blood points thank u very much
---
Bamboozle and Adredaline, those two are pretty good. 
---
Are you 12 years old?
---
I‚Äôm not a thikk Freddy but I somewhat pulled it off
---
That‚Äôs true, but even then I think people exaggerate about not having fun... 
---
I won‚Äôt quit and ruin 4 other people‚Äôs fun because I‚Äôm a selfish prick who only wants MY fun, even if it‚Äôs a little dramatic to say you don‚Äôt have any fun at all when it‚Äôs a certain character.  If it was that serious, I would just stop playing all together... 
---
Why are you arguing with someone that's trying to be helpful and answer your question?
---
üòÇ exactly everyone gets offended by me giving my opinion, also what's wrong with a discussion about if she is op or not, until she releases nobody knows but I find it ridiculous how people react to be honest. Anyway thanks for the comment and I took the downvotes for you üòâ
---
Adrenaline and bamboozle are not shit. 
---
Like I told the other guy, Bamboozle has already been on the shrine a few months ago. Plus, Adrenaline is a perk from a free survivor. It isn't worth wasting shards to get it.
---
Shhhhh just enjoy your meem
---
Once Billy gets to the right level, it will appear on every Bloodweb until it's learned. If he's over the level and it's not appearing, you've already learned it. You can check this on his character page.
---
For everyone else, it is purely luck. Don't learn teachables that you won't use to keep the pool small and increase the chance of learning perks you want.
---
Heh.
---
I have her body but not her face... or clothes 
---
I seriously thought you were making a Sarah Palin joke, apparently I was mistaken...
---
You're using tombstone piece and you find the obsession.
---
You‚Äôre just playing on hard mode. 
---
Not a bad perk, shuts down loopers at twalls
---
Yes. It'll shut down the shack loop, and jungle gyms if you play it right.
---
Why? Why does their ass size matter?
---
Is it like a little kid thing?
---
I dont DC, I make the effort to get a gen done or a hex totem but usually I die on first hook. I honestly dislike legion and I think he needs some work before people are happy with him. Plus, the point of people dcing was so that the developers would see that they're unhappy and make some much needed changes since they aren't great at listening. I'm not saying either side is right, but everyone has the right to play how they want

I was slowly scrolling when I saw this and i thought the flashlight beam was a carrot.

Bamboozle was on it, doesn't mean everyone could get it. And i dont want to waste my time on Meg, i do enough work on the survivors i own already dumping points into them. This can be very nice if someone hasn't gained either. And i am not going off of how to obtain them, im going off the perks themselves.
---
Is this fucking shit an actual thing?
---
It‚Äôs completely worth it. Some games you may not got a ton of use but most of the time you will save a shit ton of time if they‚Äôre at a good loop.  
---
I love how we often portray the killers as close friends. Like we got the plague infested avatar of an evil deity and homicidal floating nurse painting each other‚Äôs nails while the group of murderous teenagers try to teach the tortured hate-filled spirit how to do the floss. Or how everyone just unanimously agrees that the wraith (bing-bong-boy) is a cinnamon bun.

From the killer's side, I was playing Myers with rancor against a survivor who's name was "MoriMeMyers&lt;3", they  were the obsession. You better believe I only had one goal that game.
---
Thank you... that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying

Sure they are free to dc and do what they want, but it doesn‚Äôt make it any less shitty

Does tinkerer suppress nurse blink noises, Billy chainsaw and spirit phasing noises?

Original comic: https://www.mrlovenstein.com/comic/1034
---
You sir made someone happy. 
---
Not necessarily what you asked, but I've found it's easier to farm BP on survivor. Since your add-ons get used up as a killer, you're basically betting on making more BP than you're spending. On survivor, however, you can do quite well in a match without using any tools or add-ons and stockpile BP to use unlocking add-ons for killers. My farming survivor build is No One Left Behind, We're Gonna Live Forever, Dead Hard, We'll Make It.
---
Yep, actual trading cards
---
*cue Hello Zepp*
---
Oh hey that‚Äôs me with the blue hair! Lol that was a fun game
---
Literally any alternate mode would be welcomed at this point.
---
Can someone explain me why are there 115% and 110% killers and why 110% killers have a smaller terror radius and they are all female (except Legion)? I understand the nurse (90%) because she is supposed to use her power, but I don't get the others.
---
99% of the times
---
I completely get that people like to play against some more than others, like i can't stand going against doc, but i'm not gonna blame the guy for playing doc. Same with Legion.
---
Go straight to hell, boy!
---
Because they‚Äôre abilities are either:
---
Ranged
---
Speed boosts (spirit and legion for example)
---
Teleportation (Hags traps for example)
---
Congrats, you beat someone who probably has had this game for two days. Shit‚Äôs gonna come at you fast. 
---
Haha nice try behavior i'll save my 35k shards for new killer tyvm 
---
What downfalls are they then? Because her strengths outweigh her weaknesses by miles and I am confident to place her second best with ease
---
meg's still superior, so is david
---
I remember having Valerie. Jesus, I‚Äôm old.  
---
Good shrine but not really what I'm looking for.

I resemble Ace in that one skin where he has the shaved sides and back of the head. 
---
Maybe next time consider being a little more professional in your email. I wouldn‚Äôt take this seriously either. 
---
I asked about strategy. If the answer is yes, awesome. But basically saying "get gud" didn't answer my question.
---
Such a shit mentality to have...
---
My idea of fun isn‚Äôt running into traps, my idea of fun isn‚Äôt finding jigsaw boxes, my idea of fun doesn‚Äôt require me to crouch walk because a hag trap will activate, my idea of fun isn‚Äôt having axes thrown at me, my idea of fun isn‚Äôt wall hacks, my idea of fun isn‚Äôt being stalked and insta downed, my idea of fun isn‚Äôt being insta down chainsawed, my idea of fun isn‚Äôt being gen rushed (lol), my idea of fun isn‚Äôt being body blocked/flashlighted by swf, my idea of fun isn‚Äôt getting chased by an invisible dream man with X-ray vision, my idea of fun... doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm still a selfish bitch if I DC and ruin my teams chances.
---
Sure if I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fun, I COULD dc, but it‚Äôs a punkass move and a really dumb way to play a game. 
---
Legion isn‚Äôt THAT bad, people don‚Äôt even try to learn him anymore, he‚Äôs obviously not a strong killer, but because they can jump pallets and windows, it‚Äôs soooo unfun... cry me a river please... 
---
What‚Äôs MORE unfun, is to have 1-2 people dc on your team and then have to try and do 5 gens... selfish, entitled  playerbase 
---
I found all the Claudette‚Äôs from your higher res one but not the wraith. I originally thought he was in the top window but that was her. 
---
Exactly! 
---
Thank you :) 
---
It‚Äôs so silly 
---
tie a concrete brick to his leg and throw him into a deep lake, then forge a suicide note
---
Yes, you can get it as a killer. Your chances of doing it as a solo survivor is slim
---
Are you as skilled at locker escapes?  Jane must have been stuffed repeatedly into lockers in high school. 
---
Thanks for the comment. Much love &lt;3. Thank you for your time and making sure you go out of your way to comment on all of my posts and comments.  &lt;3

---
They said before the end of the week, but no official date.
---
Yep, that'll show him, casual racism is always the answer
---
I feel bad for anybody who has emetophobia after this update, like I feel like its a huge oversight when they were making the killer
---
Puppets looks like Dwight lol
---
Now you have to switch which survivor you main. thems the rools
---
Once in a chase, it is more efficient to catch the survivor than abandon them and find another. Other than chasing more survivors, watching videos can help a lot. DamnNoHtml has tons of good content, but I definitely recommend [this one](https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ) for this issue. 
---
I look like the plagues vomit. 
---
If only I had some way to do the same to toxic killers as a solo queue survivor.
---
Its too op it counters tier 3 chainsaw iri heads etc etc
---
What do you mean? Can't you just crouch past Hag traps?
---
If noed is active ill look for a totem. If the person hooked was tunneled all game i will look and save
---
Thanks for that. I tried complaining in a different way https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/axptws/god_creating_adam/ and just got ignored. ‚ÄúWinning‚Äù here with OC is way harder than Dead By Daylight.
---
Just gotta learn when to stop chasing someone. If it‚Äôs taking too long then split.  Break a few pallets. Eventually, they will run out of options besides windows and depending what killer you use, you‚Äôll get them
---
Who do you use? 
---
I can't really speak for everyone obviously but I can say that while yes this game is changing its not for the better and after playing it to rank one for three seasons in a row it got old and the game is going to keep hemorrhaging players to games like APEX. The writing is on the wall for this game unfortunately. 
---
Most likely Thursday, but all they've said is "sometime this week".
---
most new players i get against would just hit the guy and he did whatever he could to try to grab me off hatch
---
I give him a + on that one
---
I finally got him to hit me when i went to the hay where the tractor is
---
wow. Pro moves. 
---
I just leveled up my Clown. I'm offended.
---
Ruin(no explanation needed)
---
BBQ(tracking and bloodpoints)
---
Enduring(ds and pallets since Freddy can't do much about them)
---
Brutal strength(again, Freddy can't do much about pallets so breaking them as quickly as possible is great)
---
Monitor and Abuse(you said you struggle with tracking, this will help you even more. Freddy has a 24 humming radius, m and a makes it 16,literally sneak up on people)
---
Sloppy butcher(wastes survivors time healing, giving you more time)
---
Knockout(Freddy has built in deerstalker, combined with knock out is pretty nasty)
---
Noed(Freddy sucks, so endgame can happen a lot)
---
Blood warden(again, end game can happen a lot)
---
What point are you even refuting? That survivors have no limb hitboxes or the reason it was reverted? You're wrong on both I just want to know which one you're wrong on.
---
üòÇ
---
or a hot jane
---
Yes u have to pick ur battles and try to catch them off guard. the most effective and really only true other way is to use nurse
---
yea they sold out so fast that no one ever knew
---
Is there anyway to check your hours played on the console version? I don‚Äôt see anything on the menu or in settings, so I‚Äôm curious if I‚Äôm blind or maybe there‚Äôs another way to check. 
---
I either get tunnelled or sandbagged when I play one lol
---
I don't think it'll be too hard for survivors. It seems she's really good at slowing things down temporarily so survivors just need to play chill and go unseen for awhile til her vomit wears off and stuff. I'm excited, though!
---
A+ beauty üëçüèª
---
Hello friend.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs bamboozle.
---
Any chance you can level leather face? Been itching for BBQ.
---
The problem is, other killers need to be able to dictate the flow of the match as well; they're killers, after all. However, fine tunings would need to be done to ensure nobody else becomes Nurse tier.
---
They really missed the opportunity to just release the boomer with bill 
---
Stop, Pebble time!!
---
If you own him, yes. Luckily I got BBQ from the Shrine the first and only time it was in, but at this point it doesn't matter because my LF is level 45 now. BBQ is worth it, and since it's only been in the Shrine once, I'd just buy and level him.
---
You should probably chase them off the generators. Committing too much time to catch one survivor will inevitably lose you the game in the end. 
---
The way to catch the good survivors depends on a lot of factors like perks, what map, add-ons etc. 
---
Generally speaking m1 killers benefit nicely in the chase with the spirit fury/enduring combo. Having nothing to fear from pallets is a huge advantage for the killer.
---
Other killers like the hag or huntress have to use their abilities to catch survivors, as their base movement is speed is lower making them easier to loop.
---
My favorite killer streamer to watch is ZubatLEL. You can learn a ton of absolutely disgusting mind games by watching him. Good luck
---
I never bought a horse, I wasn‚Äôt *stable* enough 
---
Her smacking their face with the burner as if shes slapping them would be awesome enough for me.
---
Can a killer see the aura of the hatch?
---
When you're cocky enough to tbag, but dumb enough to not know the basic rules of the game.
---
You must be a fun person to talk to. 
---
Nope, it's a hunt to find it for both parties
---
I believe there is a sale on other dlcs when the new one releases, not positive tho.
---
Fuck I never thought of that
---
[removed]
---
hopes that BHVR sees that im pumped for chapter
---
Delete this. 
---
This goes against the whole survivors dictate game flow crap.
---
Play how you want. Part of playing survivor is experiencing different killers and getting interesting/noteworthy games. At the end of the day, it's their job to play around you, you don't need to conform to any "rules"
---
One day, my friend! One day.

---
killer main spotted
---
Go to the store right now and prove yourself wrong. You're thinking of Iridescent Shards. 
---
What totem change?
---
Monitor and abuse for that reduced 16m terror radius, BBQ &amp; Chili, whispers, and sloppy butcher or agitation. Do pretty well with this setup at high ranks. 
---
That‚Äôs been happening to me with Spirit grabs, window grabs, and vault hits. Sometimes they‚Äôll register, then the game will go, ‚ÄúJust kidding‚Äù, pause extremely briefly ,and the survivor will Just scurry off. 
---
Is that Lando? 
---
And then who do they either get killed by tier 3 or noed Jesus noed on a Michael how sweaty can you get with him 
---
the Plague
---
I literally got the Clown AN HOUR AGO. Well, won't have to level him up though 
---
Damn, you right. 
---
well i wasnt the killer i was one of the survivors and the favt that everyone ended up having ue (i only noticed this after the game finished) was hilarious to me. especially when i realized no one had ds either
---
That's not what the flair is for though...
---
Nice enthusiasm but you should probably remove the flair.
---
You got bamboozled.
---
its definitely useful against the hag when youre trying to avoid randomly placed traps but dont want to move like a turtle
---
THE PESTILENCE  
---
Yes you make very valid points but im sure they said the purge doesn't wear off and the longer the survivor has it the worse its effects are, the only cure is the fountain and using it makes the killer more powerful [didn't say how]
---
Omg well I AM Italian üòÇ
---
They mentioned during the stream that there was a totem change, however they didn't go into any specifics.
---
But... im on console....
---
Did you use to do ASMR videos, you look just like this girl AMALZD i used to watch.
---
Say what you want, I'm not the only one that feels that way. Nothing you say will change that. I'm a killer main that wont even play legion. I have my beliefs and you have yours. Enjoy your DC's every game. 
---
Except I'm a survivor main with 1000 hours and not trash at using Dead Hard like you
---
I pretty much only use Legion to farm BP, not win, but using your power liberally is the key. The problem with legion is that you sort of don't need to mindgame when you can wololol at them and just smack them over and over again until the fall down.
---
OR you could be an ass, end the chase on purpose and follow the blood while attempting to avoid seeing them so the deep wounds timer runs down while you gain on them. IE looking at the ground
---
...
---
so far these are the main things ive seen it used for:
---
1. high speed crouching vs the hag to avoid traps
---
2. while in a chase you can stall the killer with one pallet then lose them immediately by slinking away quickly yet less visibly (a very conservative method)
---
3.  sneaking around near the killer but not slowly so you can keep your distance
---
Shouldnt leatherface addons be in the locker of reworks and Phillip be Michael?
---
Guess the Trapper must be glad he brought Insideous.
---
WAAAAAAAAAH
---
Well, a lot of those BPs had to have come from offerings. The sacrifice is really low.
---
yeah, the more games i play the more i see UE and the less i see DS
---
when the killer wants to farm with u
---
Jeff :)(
---
It's not about the thicc in your thighs, it's about the thicc in your heart.
---
BIG MOOD
---
someone thought the deadhard glitch worked still. 
---
Oh, on the picture I have of it, the little light blue dot on the left side of Michael's head is white, idk why, it's normal on the post tho
---
I legit have an anti-vax friend who likes DBD. If you see this Colin, I'm gonna fuck your dad.
---
Outdated? Not at all lol. Plus his add ons make him into a real terror. 
---
Really? What a waste. 
---
Make a glowing brain meme and have the last one be a pic of the shocked brain 
---
It isn‚Äôt but from what you said it just seemed suspicious so we had a laugh. Spanish. In Spanish words are feminine or masculine. If there is no specific sex you go for the masculine. Surprisingly I‚Äôm from Spanish origin.
---
i dont know why but i was imagining theyd be permanent like lockers but this makes way more sense. im stupid
---
Frickin beaned me
---
I won‚Äôt say that Myers is bad at all, but honestly the drop from killers like spirit, billy, nurse, etc. to the average m1 killer is pretty big. Myers is strong because of he can potentially end a chase very fast, but that isn‚Äôt always easy to do against competent survivors, and also he probably will have to give up a gen at the start of the game while he is stalking up. He similar to clown in that he can quickly end chases but in between he has very little map pressure, and still has the potential to be looped, so a survivor with a strong loop like cowshed or shack with nearby loops can waste a good bit of his tier 3 time.
---
Does anyone notice the michel in the window
---
I‚Äôm a Santa clown main so yes lol. Myers is not A tier tho... maybe with purple and pink add ons then definitely but other than that he‚Äôs a straight up m1 killer with a limited insta down that only ends up getting used situationally. Even with that, he doesn‚Äôt have anything that helps him in the chase
---
What a cunt. 
---
i really enjoy spanish &amp; that makes sense!! sorry
---
Myers is A tier. It's pretty obvious why this is, stealth, instadown, 115%, long lunge and fast vaults at tier 3.
---
Clown has slightly better chases.
---
Slippery meat tier three upgrade
---
C mon. I did good in everything accept getting the actual sacrifices and didnt even get one blip. I maxed out almost everything in that match. That's ridiculous. They dont want killers to camp but there is literally no reward not to.
---
You got 50k BP but you didn‚Äôt pip?? We don‚Äôt believe you, you need more people!! üòÇüòÇ
---
Dydros, why?
---
Risky click of the day 
---
oh, yeah of course u can be thick and in shape. i just love that they didn‚Äôt make them skinny 
---
I want them to get on their knees like bubba mori, then she pulls the chain around their neck and pulls it as hard as she can until the survivor dies 
---
You have that over the hedge woman look
---
That'd make people even sweatier tbh. 
---
How good is Bamboozle? Planning on getting it.
---
Enduring, spirit fury, bamboozle, sloppy butcher
---
Dude, the point is that the game is fun for everyone, not just killers.
---
IM CACKLING
---
I had to take a deep breath after reading that sentence. 
---
I‚Äôm a very thick wraith
---
Show him the damn post
---
Wasn‚Äôt this posted yesterday? I feel like this is some gaslighting stuff. 
---
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about. I mean if I get off the hook and you camp me and don‚Äôt let me play that‚Äôs annoying.
---
I prefer the left
---
Uhhhh...
---
Yuh.
---
Please play Michael then get back to me on this ''no skill" B.S.
---
Only Legion can arguably be classified in the ''This takes no skill to accomplish" category.
---
Against good survivors Michael can even struggle to stalk and you're utterly miserable the entire time.
---
Is this a Violet Chachki reference?
---
Make maps darker 
---
It would be a lot more than 0.75s, the killer loses line of sight, has to turn around and figure out where you went, sooooo probably about 1.5 seconds.
---
What is the clip from?
---
Already doing it with the nurse 
---
i ain't about to start walking 2 miles in -15 degree weather just because my friend is a sensitive moron
---
Is that a motherfucking Jojo reference
---
found the survivor main.
---
Smh he isn‚Äôt a killer.He‚Äôs just curing those poor diseases D-Class inmates.
---
I don‚Äôt get why people are angry about it, he map looks beautiful and it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a reskin
---
even if killers host. its not like surviviors \*cant\* have bad connections. i got 50 down and 25 up. surviviors still rubberband around alot. 
---
Also the look of the map doesn‚Äôt change gameplay so y‚Äôall better stop whining
---
Why do some people don't like "The Legion"?
---
Insidious 
---
Idk why people are complaining, it looks beautiful and they did it with clown, so why not plague?
---
Plz don't give killers a bad name
---
\*unthicc 
---
Lol asthma for the win
---
Survivors go into the basement way more often than I realized until I tried it out.
---
There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs default Microsoft font. I just prefer something that doesn‚Äôt look like a high schooler who aspires to be a graphic designer wrote it.
---
Colin can take a joke just as effectively as his body can fight off obsolete diseases
---
I did this to a Hag once and we genrushed her to hell (none of us were in swf). The match lasted two minutes and then she dced
---
Both ;)
---
Hey! :) feel free to add me! I‚Äôm not always on but I‚Äôm English and live around French people we could help eachother out! :) My Psn is LilAmBurger 
---
 Is anybody else getting worried about the recent upsurge of the anti-anti-vax zeitgeist? In 35 years i have never met an anti vaxxer yet now they are apparently so numerous that they could present a problem
---
Let's see who this user REALLY is....
---
&gt;ADOOOOOOOO
---
Sometimes while casually searching for survivors i'll get a pallet on my face and have a mini heart attack. 
---
Don't blame killers for people readying up when they have red ping. 
---
I dunno, her father worked at a company with a "defective production line", sounds more like a corporate issue than a tragedy one.
---
I did. I posted it before as a joke about how female killers are typically 110% (or even slower)
---
I usually gave them 15 seconds to do the slow exit of shame, otherwise I go in after them.
---
Stop fat-shaming
---
Dr. Hamm has something to say about that. Oh wait he was tuned into an instance of SCP-049-2.
---
There's multiple reasons why people hate legion but the main reason is the moonwalking or looking down trick. You hit a survivor with frenzy, break chase by moonwalking or looking down and the survivor will go down. There's 0 counterplay to that and survivors can't do anything about it other than just run in a straight line 
---
Also have colorblindness issues.  Also cannot play rotten fields.
---
I had a morning where that was the only map loading for me.  Put in ruin and lullaby to MAYBE buy some time for points.  Both totems spawn in open corn hell.  Both taken out before the first gen was done.  Playing against 2 tan sweater lauries, a white shirt Kate, and a beige Jake.  
---
For the first time in 3 years, I DC'd on purpose.
---
Got 3 messages (PSN).  Each one claiming I was salty, or a scrub, or whatever.
---
Explained the colorblind issue.  Apologized for wasting the round.
---
They never responded.
---
I ain‚Äôt fat shaming, i love Jeff 
---
We are going to complain about a killer who isn't even out yet but we are going to ignore nurse?
---
Thanks, buddy.  Do you know if the buttons (besides the ultra rare) are any decent?
---
This is more Ace with his glasses. 
---
Is this on the switch?
---
Don't worry about it my man, save the money to save Colin from polio
---
I agree with you, however half the time the bad internet starts mid game
---
Ooohhh fuck! Double meaning!
---
Elaborate?
---
They don't, except when you try to cross those two pillars at the exit gate.
---
i know how to nerf it. survivors start the trial in the dying state and cannot be healed, also their auras revealed to the killer forever
---
I look like Adam if he was lighter skinned and was a teenager yet I dress like Joey.
---
I always thought an "Alien Vs Predator" type gamemode with survivors caught in the middle would be pretty entertaining
---
Hahahah I love that
---
The thing that makes her so good is because her blinks entirely cancel out her lack of movement speed, because not only is she faster when using her blinks (not as fast as billy with his saw but still very fast) she can also disregard the maps structure, something other killers and the survivors are restricted to. The only good part about her 90 movement speed is the fact tbat she has to blink to hit survivors, unless she wants to bloodlust and wait for them to use a pallet to make it safe to hit them with no possibility of missing the hit, but thats just a bad nurse. Point is, I don't think we should be saying how strong this killer is without even seeing how she actually plays out, especially in the regards of her being "broken" when we know the most broken killer probably won't be fixed for a loooong time. I think she looks top tier, but id still say below nurse and spirit (might change when we see her in action for the first time)
---
:0
---
I'll give you that, but I know my isp and when I can safely play without hindering anyone else, so when a survivor starts stutertting I know its not my connection. I cant say this for everyone who plays killer but can I say it's the killers fault if someone lags? No as its p2p which means everyone has to connect to make the game
---
it's definitely lag. It had happened me a lot of times and i get stuck on the grab animation for minutes
---
This game is losing players not because of "they released x killer who is no fun" but because all the constant dcing  :(
---
The only survivor I will not complain about that teabags me
---
What a snuggle fest 
---
I‚Äôd be down, definitely would increase the scare factor! 
---
It‚Äôs Kate and Claudette, and The Entity works in mysterious ways with its creation. :) 
---
That‚Äôs a bug
---
add me!! iisaustin. feel free to add me as well u/LilAmBurger!
---
Mans really took one for the team
---
there doesn't have to be any sexual implications here; someone's just homophobic

The actual link has pictures (OOOOOOOOh pictures) and may be a gateway to learning, WikiTextBot, thank you, though. 
---
Essentially some people can't receive vaccinations (anti-vaxxers opt not to have them, not because they can't, but because they think they shouldn't due to an erroneous report from ONE doctor who was trying to spread fear to push his alternative vax method), and those people are protected by having people who act as shields around them.
---
Sneezing can pass sicknesses we can try to make vaccinations for (like the flu vaccine) but it doesn't matter if you're vaxed or not for those.
---
i'd love a Halloween cosmetic like this!
---
Push for the ptb to start so we can ;)
---
Because Myers in Evil Within III has a 32m terror radius, increased movement speed, and can one hit down everyone that shows up close by with an Infectious Fright proc.
---
Legion doesn't belong in the game and I'm not just going to sit down and take it. A high DC rate against Legion will bring attention to the devs. 
---
I've gone through a few periods of acceptance and played out Legion games without DCing, but there are too many toxic Legions. I get too tilted and it sours my mood for the rest of the day, even outside of the game. For the sake of my own mental health, for the sake of my enjoyment of the game, I stick up for what I believe in (he should be reworked) and just DC. 
---
Killers can dodge "op flashlights" and P3 claudettes all they want, I just wish I could dodge Legion.

There you go man the link to it

And that communication of information can result in being lesser or stronger versions of perks that Solo players can't reliably assume is going to be in their allies loadouts. Instead of running Empathy/Bond/Aftercare you can just tell them where you are. It completely negates things like Knockout or Hex: Third Seal. Also someone can preemptively tell their allies about perks like Franklin's Demise, Spirit Fury, Sloppy Butcher, other specific power addons or warn others to search for ruin while one person powers through the first generator. 
---
Most importantly, being in communication while one person is on a hook is just like Kindred. You don't ever have to worry about 2-3 allies trying to crouch around you for a save and if the killer attempts to patrol or camp, everyone else punishes them by just doing gens and the killer gets no value. (If a killer is camping while no one was around anyway, they still wouldn't get value, but alerting your team ahead of time saves that time people would spend investigating. 
---
Even semi-niche perks like Alert and OoO can be turned into constant tracking perks that keep everyone filled with knowledge that they couldn't possibly get otherwise. 
---
Play SWF in open comms is hella stronger than playing solo. Is it across the board overpowered? No. But the number of perks you don't have to bring, can easily counter, or can strategize against is very real. 
---
Yeah, and?  Its better than DS now, it'll certainly be better than the nerfed to shit DS to come.
---
it's bad and has no benefits whatsoever but it's still better than CS:GO's ranking system
---
It's normally on a Thursday so most likely then
---
True, I didn't think of that 
---
Is that a mothafuckin JoJo reference?
---
I didn't say it would be better, I said it would be redundant.  Doctor's static field does essentially the same thing as Infectious Fright, albeit less reliable, but doesn't take a perk slot.
---
I can‚Äôt remember tbh, which is funny with the amount of hours I‚Äôve played. I‚Äôm pretty certain you can on a slow vault. 
---
YOU SIR, HAVE WON. fuck almost made me laugh my ass off in class
---
T3 Meyers . . . With this, knockout, deersralker, and the new obsession perk.
---
GG.
---
so she loves curry?
---
maybe your shit connection made them lag to stay there? Aiming doesnt mean shit in Dbd look at noob3 videos of hitboxes
---
Only played him like 6 times I had a lot of offerings and decided to waste it but sure 
---
In other news Legion is broken and water is wet 
---
Thank you! This has always bothered me!
---
Hex: Devour Ass incoming?
---
Pretty much the last scream is Kate getting moried.
---
Yes and killers who dodge are pussies just like people who dc. Get over yourself
---
This won‚Äôt change shit, just ruining your teammates time.
---
I‚Äôm sure the devs already know about legion anyway, so stop making bs excuses for yourself 
---
I like you better \*\_\*
---
Even just the sound from her getting hooked. As a killer I usually just slug her, hoping she‚Äôll just die on the floor. My ears can‚Äôt take that AND the music when you start Haddonfield map 
---
Fan Theory: Michael Myers from the Halloween film series was the inspiration for The Shape. 
---
I hope for a totem counter for both sides sometimes you think you got all totems then there is that hidden 1
---
I think Freddy was based on Sharp hand joe imo
---
I‚Äôve had a David named ‚ÄúMori Me Daddy Myers‚Äù and since my name is Daddy Myers, I obliged with a green. 
---
laughs in trapper or wraith
---
I look like leather face 
---
Time to whip out the ol leather wallet.
---
hoping calm spirit counters this right now only good thing for it is the doctor part
---
I thought they were Nea and the pussycats! 
---
Ooh baby
---
Spirit Fury Bamboozle Enduring and Fire Up (or BrSt if you‚Äôre being serious) on T3 Myers
---
The real no one escapes
---
Yeah but same energy though
---
~~Can I get a 'Nice' for getting 69^th comment thank you god bless~~
---
Cut them some slack- they were practicing for Head On timing
---
Understandable, but just so **you** understand, we need to keep Quentin away from you. 
---
Lol that perk is going to make everyone locker camp.
---
What are those big metal things with lights on all the maps? Is it safe to go near them? Or should i avoid them?
---
It is ridiculous how much shit they put as """""""""""bugs""""""""""'" and hide under the wall of miscellaneous
---
No you can hear yoir terror radius when its on you and other survivors. Not the killer.
---
Gay Myers, okay
---
Rank 11. Add the fact the doctor is the easiest killer to loop since he gives you free loops and generally kicks his own ass in a chase and you think having to camp is the solution to your own inability and poor choice in killer selection? His only purpose in the game is to farm bp. That's it.
---
It‚Äôs the worst map in the game, be thankful.
---
Same thing happened to me, got a clean hatch grab then the game just ended
---
Seems pretty situational, I believe it says that it only works on m1s. I hope they change it to work on downing someone overall, so that hatchets and chainsaws work with it too.
---
But the blue stuff will keep him awake. It will save his life, even. 
---
Maps act weird and I honestly believe there‚Äôs some algorithm to them. It can‚Äôt be complete RNG.  Otherwise, the chance I‚Äôd get Ormand Resort six times in a row, and 7 out of 8 as a killer, is astronomically low.  This happens way too often. 
---
Have you seen him?  Boy‚Äôs got himself a little bit of a problem. A little sleep might do him good. 
---
And then that one anti vaxx/science/health rando comes and fucks everyone up and before you know it everyone's the killer.
---
it would probably be good on the new killer and Michael, also nurse and the rest of the m1 killers

I like it on Myers, get into tier 3 with 3 stacks of play with your food and your pretty much a death missile
---
beautiful
---
Most likely Thursday just becauss they release major updates tuesdays and Thursdays 
---
This time the killers would actually want you to teabag.
---
A while ago they were talking about making it so it checks for line of sight of survivors before it spawns totems, that might be it.
---
No worries, friend. Playing DBDs resident Large Lad of Laughs is its own reward. 
---
It seems to never not be Coldwind Farm, honestly. I can guarantee that I'm not the only one who's had to deal with that stupid map more than any other. 
---
You asked "where do they stream? is there a recording?"
---
I seem to get Coldwind on a streak like that. 
---
5
---
You're barely 18, you might be an adult in the eyes of the law but in no way do you  get to pull the "I'm so much older and wiser" card
---
That usually means the killer is laughing. 
---
Did he let you escape afterwards?
---
Bill: "FUCK!"
---
The crossover from DBD and RPDR are alwyas fun to see 
---
Oh huh.. OK I was about to call bs but then I saw your tag. What else can you tell us? 
---
what?
---
Yes, and he provided a link that is not sticked to the front page, while you provided nothing.

For sure, their patchnotes are one of the worsts I've ever seen.

---
I don't have any of these problems 
---
That's right! You actually have to kill two in order to pip. You can safety given enough points otherwise, but complete sacrifices count towards "Devout", the emblem with the most actual value. 
---
Not gonna lie, I've had a blast playing him, so I don't have any regrets. Worth the time for sure.
---
k dude
---
The correct answer is spirit fury.
---
I don't mean for this to come off as creepy, as any kind of compliment can be seen as some type of fishing for attention from a girl or woman, but Nea is not very attractive, and OP is quite pretty. So I'm not seeing the Nea at all.
---
This sub has its fair share of issues, but I don't believe shitposting is one of them though many of them do get repetitive and if you have a certain niche, you're not going to be pleased here. 
---
How dare you. You don't even know what you're saying. He's actually one of the funnest killers to play as and against. He's thrilling. He's terrifying. He's a meme. He's hilarious. 
---
Not to mention, Myers mains tend to be pretty relaxed and wholesome. 
---
I know but why is this a post? Its just someone using Spirit Fury
---
We need to have a mom like character for the build.
---
What‚Äôs your rank?
---
How dare you sir how dare you hehe yea they are relax cause hes ez to play as and you don't really need to try I'm gonna try and get the offering for me to play Michael
---
Xbox or ps4.? 
---
I am on PS4 and it literally takes me like 5 -8 minutes to find a lobby, plus barely anyone disconnects, but then again, I am a rank 7.. 
---
Freddy, anyone? Such a manlet...
---
I do see some people run both Lithe and Balanced Landing, at least that way you can always get the boost but BL also has the passive affect of reduced stagger on falls even if exhausted. Tho this does take away 2 perks, some people swear by it.
---
Oh right. Probably just surprised by the lunge through, combined with enduring and spirit fury. Probably the first time they've seen someone invalidate a pallet.
---
Lol your in trouble buddy
---
Don't forget flashlights üî¶

Players: ds is annoying when the non obsessions are able to use it
---
Devs: lol just make everyone the obsession fixed

Almost positive it's bamboozle.

üëçüèª
---
oh yeah, I was thinking that but I don't have all the perks for it on a character that would be fit for it.  
---
Maybe meg with one of her cosmetics I guess
---
Got outplayed in the most skillful part of the game. 
---
Survivors have gotten everything they've wanted from the very start so they can have a game that favors them. 
---
If they can't deal with a God-Tier Nurse, it's their fault. You stay skilled and kick every last ass for us killer mains, yeah? 
---
Arkham_knight50 (:
---
Those are generators, you must complete them to escape. Because of this, it's very safe to go near them. Just be mindful of where the killer is, so they don't pull you off.

Take it easy, we all make mistakes sometimes.
---
Firstly, I completely agree with you that pronouncing 'mither' with a 'y' sounds awkward.
---
That being said, ['tither'](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tither) is another word that fits the pattern and is pronounced differently.  
---
"It‚Äôs not fun for the survivors."  
---
No one could ever provide me proof of this. What the fuck doesn't want to win? I could understand the frustrations of being gen rushed since I mainly play killer, but I never understood that.
---
Legions are always sweethearts to me, since I seem to be the only one that actually makes the effort to play with them :'(
---
Holy fook I‚Äôm shook 
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs groundbreaking
---
whats with all the downvotes on post xD

Congrats!

Ding ding ding! You're right! I tried to be friendly to see if he would but he just went straight to hooking me... oh well

I agree! and in that same vein:

After spending an entire weekend grinding to upgrade meg, adrenaline is in the shrine. So salty
---
Are you sure about this? I thought it was already concluded that The Shape is actually based off a square or a triangle. I don't know man. 
---
Of course! If nobody stays quiet, we will be revealed easily!
---
Easier to find games for lower ranks cause there‚Äôs more low-rank players. I never had queue problems when I started but now do at purple surv.
---
I though he was from, Silent Hill 
---
If someone dc‚Äôed and the hatch is open, I‚Äôll let the last one go. If there is more than 4 gens left, I would rather just get into another game.

What kinda alpha thot move is this?
---
I wish you luck if shes a gagging, retching nightmare.
---
I'm hoping they give her a huntress treatment, where you can hear her chants before her radius, with coughing and gasping laced throughout.  If she straight up gurgles and squelches when puking, I'm sorry man.
---
Dwight is the chad now
---
I know for me personally with my 4K Samsung tv the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù settings for gaming for HDR makes DBD REALLY dark, I‚Äôve been playing like this for awhile until I tried messing with the settings and there was a HUGE difference in brightness.

But yea for the past 2 years survivors have been near invisible out in the open for me on my TV

I just got stake out lol rip üòÇüòÇ

A survivor perk slot gone just to counter a killer perk that might not even be run? Sounds good to me.
---
Dead hard because I can use it for get hatch or a pallet
---
It always warms my heart to see the survivors fuck each other up.
---
Nah but you straight gorgy.   I like
---
Lol so what you're saying is that my only options are to play nurse, huntress or billy or to not get any pips for doing my job as a killer. This has nothing to do with the killer I chose how I played. You should not be able to acre 50,000 blood points and simultaneously not get a blip. You are not a developer and I am sure that his only purpose in the game isnt to farm BP. Though he is clearly very good at it.
---
I'm wondering how useful infectious fright will be though. So you scream and your location gets revealed, then what? Nine times out of ten the killer is still going to pick up and hook the downed person and by the time he/she goes to where you were revealed, you should be long gone.  Could be meta if killers start running a slug build because of the DS change. I'm excited for the new chapter.
---
Lemme guess the SWF group cut out as soon as they saw the pudding? Game needs to stop showing the offerings but guess it don‚Äôt matter I haven‚Äôt played in a week now.
---
That would be perfect example 
---
Unless someone is running Prove Thyself, then probably separate generators. If two people work on the same gen, then each of their repair speed goes down to 90%, making the total output 180% repair speed. 
---
We'll Make It. Just so powerful
---
that new perk isnt even that good, ita gonna fall out of the meta right quick 
---
Source?
---
i'm a guy
---
Swap Urban with Distortion. That's a gen jockey build. 
---
Are you bragging about escaping from a newbie with 1 perk? Gtfo lol
---
I'm solo rank 1 survivor and the only thing that really sucks is the frame rate dropping when I'm doing skill checks and struggling or lag for example clearly exiting the basement on my screen only to get hit and teleporting back into the basement
---
It‚Äôs a meme on the subreddit
---
Ah, my b
---
I can see Michael making use of it to make his snowballing more efficient.
---
I already use it on most of my survivors because I hate facing Doc so I'm already prepped.

Toxic legions be like: ‚Äútunnel time.‚Äù
---
yeah to show the expose status right away would be fine I guess. 
---
But the smoke not so much 
---
That way they would immediatly know WHICH totem to destroy and wouldnt have to really look and destroy all of them and find them, sometimes they are spawining in nasty locations
---
But then you're in THEIR domain... and you won't be coming back out
---
Fun fact: D-strike is a one time use perk and the billy has enduring so it won‚Äôt even help much
---
Fun was never an option just as death is no escape in this game :D   
---
Only to harvest and produce more salt :D 
---
The game is utterly in the worst state it's ever been on console. On top of long wait times in queue as survivor? 
---
You get into a game and good luck if the killer doesn't play scummy, or good luck if your teammates just aren't the biggest sack of wet dead potatoes.
---
Killer? A survivor basically just has to run at you at this point and you're going to miss a hit you should've really hit in the first place. 
---
And then you also have the problem of the same potato survivors just making the game unfun as killer because you did your job so fast that it didn't even feel like you did anything at all. 
---
And if they're not potatoes? 90 percent of survivors do the stealth gameplay option and have no interest in interacting with you at all.  Which can make the games soooo boring. 
---
Frame rate and the broken matchmaking causes both sides to have a miserable experience of ''I should have hit that" and ''God why did that hit me." 
---
And don't get me started on how unfun Legion is, but that's a thing with every version of the game.
---
I use to be able to play for damn near 8 hour stretches. I've gotten to the point with the performance of both the game and the console community that I can barely stomach 3 maybe 4 games a night on either side.
---
You misunderstood me, in my idea ALL of the totems start to smoke, since any of them can become lit.
---
Good for you for spreading a bit of positivity. Happy birthday!
---
I agree but don‚Äôt go full sicko mode on me if my teammates abandoned me. 
---
Good perk incase need to migrate
---
I thought the reverse bear trap timer didn't count down while slugged or while in chase. (I know both of them tried to leave and that is why it triggered but why is the downed David's trap beeping and red like it is ticking down?
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs better to leave the person slugged. You can get the other person and create more map pressure cause someone‚Äôs forced to pick the other up. Or at least get 1 hit off. I can see myself using it 
---
I did :D Thanks for teaching some stuff and being nice despite different view points.

Rare on this Reddit to get a normal, decent discussion :D

r/shitpostcrusaders I, SPEEDWAGON, SHALL ALLOW NONE TO HARM THIS GENTLEMAN!
---
I played against a Spirit not too long ago and Looped her solo for at least over 6 minutes.
---
 
---
Any time she would Spirit Walk I would just Urban Evasion away, and essentially ‚Äúreset‚Äù the chase. I ended up hitting her with like 7 Pallets. I felt really bad.
---
Whereas I was just recently chased by a Wraith and got the BIG oof in like 1 minute.
---
Also different heights, which is noted in the Killers bio now thank god.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
I think it'd be cool if every other bloodweb you get a "wild card" perk which allows you to pick what perk you want out of the perks you still need to get.
---
Yea PS4 around rank 7 now. Legit takes 10+ minutes just to have a high ping lobby or someone dcs on their first knockdown. 
---
I used to main him when I played killer. 
---
Lmao you right. Team = Free BP
---
I think were missing something
---
that's actually not a bad idea
---
People don't bitch about Nurse because she's punishing if you screw up, and it's very easy to screw up
---
Damnit. 
---
I mean if you don't tunnel you won't get DS used on you. So just don't tunnel
---
What ya mean? Its just a design that I think would be good if Dead by Daylight does a werewolf chapter. Since they won't alter the main human skeleton in anyway for a typical werewolf.

They even drew her thicc in the icon damn
---
Still got my vote for Ms. Universe.
---
Happened to me with Clown yesterday for 2 minutes. At least you didn't get stuck in a palpatine pose unable to move while a teabagging Quentin with flashlight blinded you every 5 seconds.
---
&gt;im stupid
---
Are you tho? I mean, it wouldn't be the first time that a new killer introruced a new prop type that spawns on every map. The Hag brought totems with her.
---
The differemce is that the totems were linked to perks, which meant that all killers had access to them, the fountain on the other hand seems to only have any use on a specific killer sinse I assume that you can interact with it when you are sick.
---
They did say that it heals you, so, maybe you don't have to be sick to use them, but either way, I don't see these fountains being used when other killers are selected.
---
As for map placement, I assume that it will be able to spawn in the same spots that jigsaw boxes spawn
---
(Can we please call the fountain magical spider juice in this community)
---
Dio next killer Pepega
---
This is true. It's also very helpful on Myers with the Judith's Tombstone + Fragrant Tuft of Hair combo
---
Try it now maybe? Should be there now. 
---
The person in the Halloween uses a knife, the shape also uses a knife. 
---
Didn't you forget about a specific new perk and a certain survivor that is totally only doing one thing all game?
---
Idk I'll check it tomorrow on pc
---
Not true. You can grab them in the healthy state when they vault over windows, just like every other interrupted action. 
---
MY LEG
---
Go to Badham preschool using the offering.
---
The map is good for survivors in general and the hatch spawns 90% of the times in the pre school lower floor.
---
I know it's quite obvious but you gain no advantage from using a skeleton key over a dull key to open hatch. (unless you put addons like blood amber on).
---
For me it took 2 tries on that map to get it. Good luck.
---
Just boop the snoot and your good!
---
Holy crap! I was totally thinking "This looks like something, but I can't quite put my finger on it.."  
---
I love you, whores!
---
People that do this are just making up for their inability to properly pressure a team, so they go for a single guarantee instead. I do wish this was more strongly de-incentivized somehow. The only semi-counter is Borrowed Time, and there's a good chance Bill will just replace you on the hook due to having to run up to the killer first to unhook you.
---
Here is a helpful guide for doing this

Thank you for coming to my TED talk
---
Im not saying you had to drop anything in regards to her current design, just, as i said, integrate the smoke into her bile power. If not swapping it out completely then having smoke and puke mixed together, a thick black smoke and the sickly green bile that erupts from her mouth. The entity gave the Doctor his shock power and the Wraith the bell and the Nurse her teleportation, its not too far out of the realms of possibility that it also corrupted the Plague's power, While the Virus she had was dangerous and contagious, it still was limited, so the Entity boosted it.
---
Mixing the sickly mist of the realm and her urn in the lungs, with the infection and bile of the stomach, together giving her the deadly range and potency to her attack.
---
Bruh you're fat
---
But I use a knife
---
Just go try it? I have literally done it so many times coming from both angles of the window. Or maybe just Google it really quick? Pretty sure you can find a quick video. You just have to be right up on it and tap m1. 
---
Who said thot is gender specific?
---
...but making the coffee takes like 3x as long as making coffee normally.
---
For killers it depends on the killer but generally hex:ruin and bbq and chilli are pretty good
---
For survivors you generally are gonna want self care and one of the exhaustion perks(sprint burst, dead hard, lithe, balanced landing,) but some builds might use neither of those, depends on playstyle.
---
Yes please
---
I thought it was a random cosplay until I read the comment and reread the title. You look better tho üòÇ
---
DS has been brought up here on this subreddit where people spoke of it as an issue many times. I now know that you weren‚Äôt the killer, but saying ‚ÄúGuess which perk is about to replace decisive‚Äù and cropping out the status of the survivors at the end of the match made it seem like you were complaining about another perk you considered OP because you lost to those using it
---
i've only heard it directed towards women
---
I played against one earlier with a Nea with a key. I was healing the Nea in the lower section of the small 2 story enclosed section on backwater. As I was healing her, the Huntress shows up and starts trying to hit through the wall then starts coming up h stairs to cock her Hatchet at us. Just as I finish healing  the other random did the 4th gen and the hatch spawned right in front of us. Nea ran out and used the key and I jumped in after her. The best was the random then came, then got hit as she was going down and then dead hards into the hatch!
---
You still look hella cute tho just sayin 
---
EVEN SPEEDWAGON USES DS!

It‚Äôs just always a safe bet to write professionally if you expect to be taken seriously. Whether it‚Äôs just a game, a resume or a government email. If someone sent me an email that had bad grammar and spelling, slang and whatnot I would just gloss it over and send a cookie cutter response if it warranted a response. And I reckon that‚Äôs exactly what you got back. An automatic cookie cutter response. 
---
kIlLeR ToOk tHe gAmE HoStAgE, WhY dIdNt hE JuSt LeT mE wIn?
---
Alternate translation: tunnel me please. 
---
If they took every single email they received seriously then they‚Äôd have to hire a dozen extra employees just to read through the emails. I‚Äôm sure they get thousands of reports a day and honestly just don‚Äôt have time. If I were them I would breeze through them. If someone cared enough about an issue I would be able to see it in their writing. If it was hastily written with grammatical errors, spelling mistakes and slang, with no format, I would just say ‚Äúoh this is just another spur of the moment angry report. Next.‚Äù
---
Funny because Nurse has more counterplay than Legion. 
---
The puking is probably useless, imagine this: it takes 3 seconds to remove the plauge on that's highlighted and around every corner, puking is uninterruptible and takes 7 seconds, the survivor will be able to run half the map on that time, it probably looks cool but you'll realize it is a waste of time after the 3-4 games
---
The meta will not change because the gameplay stays the same.
---
I‚Äôm not ragging on you or anything man. Just giving you advice as a guy who has worked in positions where I had to shift through my fair share of emails from strangers. 
---
And hopefully no more dogshit spawns. It‚Äôs horrendous when ruin spawns in direct line of sight right beside a generators the survivors spawned by. 
---
The downvoted comments here are equally as sad as they are hilarious.

I just prestiged my michael and he's now P1 lv50 but I still don't have bbq or monitor and abuse on him :')
---
Would be useless if less than a minute.
---
I literally never get hatch grabs because this always happens to me
---
Yeah, had this happen to me twice in a row, it never feels good. I'm essentially just very slowly getting deleted from the game and it's super off-putting to continue on with matches after.
---
I remember the Devs talking about a "hope" meter that would drain less if the Killer was close to you, not sure what they did with that idea.
---
I can't find something about the new killer and it's super important. Was the new killer's stun  voiceline revealed?

Freddy is really good ,just reduce his dream time a bit by using add-ons and with basically wall hack ,you just need good m1 perks on him

I use enduring and bamboozle to end chases quickly and you can use some other perks too but I recommend these two

I think Adam and ace should switch, Adam is helps people and ace has his gambling thing, making him kinda chaotic.

That's why you never spend shards for BP until after you know the week's new shrine perks.
---
Yeah. Solidarity is the only good survivor perk here. But at least Jeff's perks were all good
---
Oh god that's scary
---
You fool, this perk wasn‚Äôt made for dwight, because that requires him to come out of the locker!
---
Every Dwight main now has an excuse to come out officially
---
I would hate another doctor, we already have one. I also hate leatherface because we already have a hillbilly.

Leatherface is the most 2-dimensional killer to play.

---
*unintelligible screaming mixed with chainsaw noises*
---
It looks like she was thrown by the killer and blonde feng ducked to avoid being hit
---
Wow the nose and make up are basically identical wtf.
---
what subreddit is that
---
If I had to classify all the Survivors by the people who play them:
---
* **Dwight** - *True Neutral* - I have met toxic Dwights, I have met friendly Dwights. I have met Dwights who are great players, I have met Dwights that do fuck all. Dwight is such a generalist character that it's impossible to truly pin down the type of people who play him.
---
* **Meg** - *Chaotic Neutral* - Megs are almost always a little on the toxic side but you can never really be sure how good they are. Sometimes they'll be a great asset and other times they'll run to your gen, blow it up, and then run away.
---
* **Claudette Morel** - *Neutral Good* (unless they're P3 where they're Lawful Evil) - Claud players (who aren't wearing Prestige clothing) either like Claud for her good perks or are trying to unlock Self Care. They usually care about their team but it's unclear if they'll be looking out for them completely or just trying their best to get out of the match alive.
---
* **Jake** - *Chaotic Good* (in the meme) - Jake mains are such a wild card but they'll always try their best. Sometimes they're complete garbage players, other times they're on gens, and other times they have every hook on the map sabotaged at all times.
---
* **Nea** - *Neutral Evil* (in the meme) - Generally toxic. Genereally willing to sell their allies out for some bloodpoints.
---
* **Laurie** - *Chaotic Evil* (in the meme) - Never met a Laurie who wasn't trash. Never met a Laurie who wasn't toxic. Never met a Laurie who didn't DC on first down.
---
* **Ace** - *True Neutral* (in the meme) - The only consistent thing about Ace mains is that they're usually far more chill than everyone else. But sometimes they're toxic, other times they're sweet.
---
* **Bill** - *Lawful Good* (in the meme) - Every Bill I meet tries his best and cares about his team.
---
* **Feng** - *Chaotic Neutral* (leaning on Evil) - Most Fengs I meet are at least modestly toxic but overall they're just complete wild cards.
---
* **David King** - *Lawful Evil / Chaotic Good* (depends on if they're farming you or not) - There are two types of Davids: the type that will farm you and the type that will "GET DOWN MR. PRESIDENT!" and take a hit for you when the Killer has NOED so you can escape, even if he dies.
---
* **Quentin** - *Neutral Good* (in the meme) - Quentin players are such odd-balls, but they're almost always consistently useful and rarely toxic. They kinda just exist and appear when you need them. They're like magical faries that appear to loot chests for Green Medkits or unhook you before running away.
---
* **David Tapp** - *Lawful Neutral* (in the meme) - As a Tapp main I don't know why but our kind is just *absorbed* into generators. We will ocassionally come out of our cocoons to unhook a Survivor or loop the Killer but for 95% of the match our body is merged with a gen.
---
* **Kate** - *Chaotic Neutral* - Kate is like discount Feng in terms of players. Some of them are toxic, some of them are nice. Some of them are good, some of them are bad. They're wild cards, though I find that they're usually not that good at the game. No offence to the local Kate mains.
---
* **Adam** - *Chaotic Neutral* - Is helpful and kind until suddenly while you're minding your own buisness a *fucking pebble alerts the Killer to exactly where you are.*
---
* **Jeff** - *Neutral Good* - Jeff players are usually kind souls who will unhook you or take a hit for you before disappearing, ever to be seen again. You'll maybe watch them with Aftercare but you'll never meet face-to-face after that first fateful interaction.
---
I find it strange that Plague is speaking Babylonian (I‚Äôm assuming) yet Rin is still speaking English and not Japanese. 
---
Still lovely art though~
---
Fucking bullshit. I hate you guys with your dumbass theories
---
I can already see it being a new meta. You know how sometimes when a killer chases you down, you jump into a locker just for shits and giggles because you KNOW you‚Äôre going to get downed? Well now just hop right in and stun that bitch. I can‚Äôt wait for this perk. I know that when I play killer, locker‚Äôs will be hell. Enduring will help though.
---
My personal favorite from killer mains when facecamping is brought is "I don't have to care about your fun" yet they are angry when survivors return the sentiment.
---
But that's just a theory a GAME THEORY And.....out!
---
Source Filmmaker, friend. 
---
Yes. You can destroy them by shining a flashlight on them too.
---
As a Jeff main, can confirm. We appear when needed most, then disappear.
---
I thought it was a trapezoid
---
Adrenaline is highly worth it, but tbh if you play Meg or just level her up you can save yourself some shards. Meg is probably one of the best survivors  to play anyway.
---
He was quiet. Guess that means satisfaction. 
---
Legion players are the saltiest. Change my mind.
---
I'm pretty sure The Hillbilly is based on Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
---
None of the new perks on either side seem good enough to replace meta perks. The only thing you could make an argument for is the gen blocker one but it seems really hit or miss, and its really reliant on the numbers. Since Infectious Fright only works on M1s its basically only worth it on Myers or Nurse.
---
The survivor perks suck except for Solidarity. 
---
And hot take - the Plague seems like its going to be another tunneling killer. Its like an ultra combo of some of the most annoying killers in the game. Pig, Doctor and Legion. Vomit effect sounds similar to deep wound in that the longer it stays on you the worse the effect gets. It also is similar to the pig because of the Fountains which are just reskinned Jigsaw boxes. Then it has an element of doctor of just slowing survivors down and being annoying. This isnt even mentioning the spreading effect it has or how that the power gets ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù when you go to a fountain that has been used. It *sounds* cool but also has the potential to be really unfun and boring to play against. Tunnel hungry bad killers are going to love the Plague.
---
If the survivor was anti vax the clown gas would kill them on the spot
---
You break line of sight vs a nurse more easily, and so it's easier to mind game.  A nurse can't run after you at 120%.
---
User flairs. You can set them up
---
I wouldn't get adrenaline like these people are suggesting. Meg is a starter killer and if you ever want quick and quiet or sprint burst, you will be levelling her anyway.
---
It also works against clown bottles, so I suspect it works against anything that makes the survivor scream
---
Survivors within range scream.  Legion lights them up when he stabs.  It's the same thing.
---
In the exact same boat here my friend, I just seem to be getting lobbied with the absolute bottom of the barrel wannabe trolls and such, following me round, purpose dropping pallets and failing skill checks etc, then I always seem to get the killers who will just camp and tunnel hard, might have to leave it alone for a while I think
---
It's not.
---
1. That's not the perk we are discussing
---
2. That's not why frenzy is hated
---
As an ace main i agree, im a lil toxic but only 'Just a lil bit'
---
How would they puke with a plague doctor mask on though?
---
About 3 feet higher and you've found the sweet spot on the oversized spirit hitbox.
---
Imagine killer gets the most broken, game breaking perk that makes even freddy better than current nurse without this new perk. Then when you complain about it, I use this argument. ‚ÄúYou want us to make it easy for you to SURVIVE?‚Äù
---
How do i counter 360s as killer on console? i have max sensitivity but i always get 360  even tho i try very hard to keep survivor on line of sight.
---
I may just play the hell out of Jane when she comes out, depends on how badly her injured sounds and screams are. Please for the love of god I hope she‚Äôs not like Kate and Tapp
---
To reiterate: what.
---
[Looks more like a cargo container to me](https://www.cargos.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cargo-Containers.jpg)
---
It was a killer so I doubt. FTFY
---
Yeah, but I lose my offering, my pip, also the wait times are already high as a survivor, have some empathy and at least let me do 2 gens before hooking me. You Killer mains always complain about Survivor main behavior but constantly pull shit like this without even thinking.
---
1k or no... Fuck.
---
Goodnight
---
Stand still and just swing, don‚Äôt lunge. That‚Äôs about the best advice I can give. 360s on console are nasty.
---
That‚Äôs not the same as killers crying about DS. It wasn‚Äôt broken at all. 
---
Sure, but normally being caught in a locker is an automatic down so I‚Äôll take the hit personally. Hell, it‚Äôs a perk that makes lockers not totally useless against the huntress, so it has that going for it.
---
Also heard if you hook everyone in the first ten seconds you get Shirtless Myers. My friend's dad works at Nintendo and he told me.
---
Imagine getting pissy over a joke that a million people before you have already made.
---
I'm SALivating.
---
First hit has no cooldown and refills, chain it with a second hit right after. Do the math.
---
No bjing bj√µng sound paired with supressed terror radius for a few seconds makes him as sneaky as michael myers when he comes jumpin' around the corner to wack you
---
THIS IS NOT EVEN MY FINAL FORM FOOLS!
---
I'm pretty sure it's only one time use. Which is pretty bullshit
---
4? U sure? 
---
I main trapper it almost never happens to me
---
BHVR is scared to actually nerf camping cmv.
---
You're not playing the game. You're not trying to put an end to the game. You're not actually doing anything the game intends you to do(The game does not intend for you to completely neglect generators and hide in an attempt to make the killer rage quit out of pure salt). You are holding the game hostage, and that is a reportable offense. 
---
No, the killer killing you is fair because they don't want to wait for 4 minutes for the game to end when they could do so instantly, and with more points, and hiding for 20 minutes is literally against the rules in said scenario
---
Edit: Also, last time I met an idiot like you, they ended up in my lobby three times in a row after they hid in the basement for 10 minutes straight. I camped them to death. It's just fair, right? Don't make the game an intentional chore
---
It depends what killer you use. BBQ and ruin are run by most killers.
---
This is such a shitpost I can't even
---
Should have used his fog traveller head gear, the one with the beard and Fedora.
---
I mean, you and all the trash survivors can tell yourselves otherwise, but Lightweight is a trash perk.
---
You're dumber than dogshit if you believe that, but whatever makes you feel better.
---
Don't think there's any MTX that actually transforms or changes its model in this game. Closest we've got is spirit's hair, which I think is just a bunch of paper thin strands that move on top of one another
---
Maybe some small indie movies that no one has ever seen.
---
Oh hell no
---
I really like doctor , the hag and clown, ( and im gonna start playing the new killer too) 
---
That'd alter the silhouette a lot, I'm not sure they'd do that.
---
I‚Äôm literally switching to a killer main, just so I can chase Ms.Jane
---
Be happy, you shouldn't waste your shards on teachables that you can unlock. 
---
It's five hits. The only way it's 3 is Frank's.
---
Devour Hope. It rarely lasts enough to activate, but when it does it's the most satisfying thing ever. 
---
Level Meg, she is best girl and you can also get her other teachables.
---
Have you ever seen the two of them in the same place at the same time 
---
This!
---
The only other perks that affect Bloodpoints are Beast Of Prey, Distressing, No One Left Behind, and Hex: Thrill Of The Hunt. However, these perks only give more Bloodpoint gains in certain categories. Barbeque and Chilli and We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever both give you up to double the amount of Bloodpoints in all categories. So, you could use the other perks as well but they can feel like kind of a waste of a perk slot when BBQ and WGLF give way more.
---
For doc and clown, try bamboozle/ spirit fury and enduring. For hag, make your choice and sloppy butcher (gives you time to place traps)
---
Nope.
---
"While you were doing gens I was studying the blade!" 
---
As clown I run BBQ, ruin, nurses and noed. 
---
As doctor you don't really need aura reading as you can find people easy. So I run distressing, ruin, brutal strength, overcharge
---
How dare you not get rid of that white dot. I am bewildered that you would even present this to us with it there. DOWN VOTE! 
---
U suppose you're right. With the ds changes, you will have a lot more freedom with which perks you want. If you'd like some fun perks, try shadowborn, agitation, save the best for last or a haunted grounds and devour hope combo.
---
Up next: people who finished a bloodweb.
---
They work for the leader. The locker man
---
No ma‚Äôam 
---
If it's your first down, you'll have no pressure, and only that person is wounded, meaning the people will continue humping gens. Even worse when you denied them an infinite, only to have to resort to slugging. It can be really situationally strong, and even when it's not, you still spend around 8 seconds picking them up, as opposed to 4, and most likely another 10 seconds chasing. That's nearly 45 seconds of generator repair split amongst the three other players, and might turn one generator from popping, to three. As little as 14 seconds could make that much of a difference. 
---
If you spend more than 10 seconds? Well, every second is three in the eyes of the survivor, so the math's not hard
---
Noed can be countered, not like DS. Look all the survivors with DS at high rank and compare with the noeds. In every single game at high ranks there was a DS (or multiple). Noed is not used a lot between red rank killers. 
---
There are other reasons than suspected SWF to dodge a lobby, but once the new matchmaking system goes live killers won't be able to tell if the survivors are SWF based on when they load in since they will always all 4 pop up at the same time regardless.  Sure it sucks to have increased queue times for something that ultimately doesn't matter much, but I prefer lobby dodging than the killer pulling the plug mid match and forcing everyone to lose their items/offerings for 0 points.  Plus it would be very hard to enforce at best, since there are other valid reasons to leave the lobby.  Heck, there are many players who disconnect frequently despite the devs not being okay with it and still very rarely get punished for it.
---
Funny how it looks like you are the one that deserves an r/woooosh
---
Either making it possible to close the hatch or remove the grabbing. I don't care which of these two, but it's the only possibility i see.
---
Maybe a third option that isn't so much killer, or survivor sided, the killer can close the hatch, BUT a chest spawns at the map with a 100% chance of a dull or skeleton key.
---
[Disconnects do count](https://i.imgur.com/DwjkXBy.jpg)
---
This ain't fucking instagram.
---
Those are clever tips. I used to trap gens but they always get wise to it. I started trapping new places like walk ways going to a gen.That worked. I like trapping pallets before hand so once a loop starts they get caught usually. Im going to try implementing what you said though. Thanks.
---
Um legit tempted to try this in a week or so.
---
"Playing stealthier" and "Hiding without ever touching a generator for 20 minutes straight" has a very fine line separating it. One's still trying to get to the game's end, the other is intentionally wasting time to be a salty dickhead that can't just accept that the game's lost, and wants a petty feeling of revenge over consequences that the killer wasn't even in control of
---
*Runs past Dwight and inadvertadly vomits in real life by listening to his gagging noises*
---
Survivors hate everything that isn't a free and easy win
---
No. Because only 1 killer can be on the map at the time. But it is suspicious.
---
Hmmm, the chapter she's in is called "Demise of the FAITHFUL"
---
On PS4 there's no way to check the playtime. Which sucks.
---
I watched. I may have missed it. Maybe I'll rewatch it. 
---
I'm a white bald male claudette
---
Pebble a locker, Dwight uses head on from said locker, tea bag killer, get moried
---
I‚Äôm honoured as a Bill main :) I feel like we‚Äôre the only ones who actually run ‚ÄòNo One Left Behind‚Äô
---
Interesting but requires too much set up and...its an exhaustion perk and only a 3 second stun. With how prevalent Enduring is well its not looking too good
---
"Better rev up those generators!"
---
Not going for the injured person usually helps me with pressure. When i'm chasing the unhooker, the just unhooked is usually self caring in a corner somewhere, that way there are 2 people not working on gens. But if i go for the unhooked the unhooker can just go work on gens
---
‚Ä¢ Adjusted the algorithm for hook spawn distance. Killers now have have hooks in each orifice.
---
I think this will be one of the best basement escape perks
---
I'm pretty much blonde quentin, but less goblin-like
---
I think it's fine. Its not always useful against competent survivors. It lets you know if its on after the last gen. Cleanse the totem in case someone gets hit and escape. 
---
I personally enjoy running into a jungle gym, turning a corner in an unexpected way, and completely throw off a legion 
---
I mean technically you're right but most of the time 2 out of 3 people are just sitting around like ducks in dry water looking for a Totem (sometimes even without Ruin) or Chests like the greedy Gremlins they are.
---
That being said I feel like I usually get pretty lucky/trick them a bit because a lot of people can be pressured into using DS early. Sure it sucks, and yeah if everyone's Gen dedicated it stinks but there's still tons of counters to it and with everyone running Ruin (which I do) those times can be countered.
---
As I said, maybe I get lucky with lobbies but I've never had an issue with DS because most players I go against just don't give a fuck about Gens until they realise "oh. He's killing someone".
---
I‚Äôm still going to do a 4 man swf basement party with head on 
---
i do all of this and never really realised lmfao
---
You're not, though. You're just a Steam user.
---
or dark sense even
---
I wouldnt mind wario. Maybe a mewtwo. Mewtwo could be scary. 
---
this looks like a mix between dwight and the new survivor. was that intentional?
---
BBQ/Ruin/Enduring/Spirit Fury. This is a basic build where almost every killer can use except for like 3 (Nurse, Hag and Huntress). This build lets you disrespect pallets and spend less time chasing while slowing the gens down.
---
And then there are flex spots depending on the killer you‚Äôre playing. Like clown would probably rather just run Brutal Strength than Spirit Fury. Huntress would prefer Nurses+Whispers over the pallet disrespecting build. Spirit would be better off using Sloppy Butcher/Nurses since her chase game is already so strong. M&amp;A for Myers and Freddy
---
But its undeniable how strong this basic build is on M1 killers. You almost never want to respect pallets because it allows good survivors to run you for longer so the Enduring+Spirit Fury combo really helps with that.
---
While that is true, games should be balanced around high skill gameplay either way. That nurse takes skill to play doesn't make her ability any less bullshit. Legion might have a boring ability, but he isn't viable at high skill play
---
Being stealthy IS fun when you do it properly, just as much fun as a good chase. Heck, I love doing both. And being able to be stealthy and also be able to manage a chase makes you a real asset in any team.
---
Everyone should work on both their chase skills and thei stealth skills imo.
---
Soon(tm)
---
I was thinking the same thing myself. I can see a SWF using this to get an extra stun on the killer mid-chase or even up to 3 times if they are coordinated enough. May not happen often but I can certainly expect to see it happen to a point where I foresee new rage threads of it being broken.
---
Well you better rewatch the footage and find out if they said something. And find out you are wrong.
---
Whats up with reddit always saying ‚ÄúTHIS *insert trash perk/add on here* WILL BE META WHEN THE NEW KILLER COMES OUT!‚Äù Just because Calm Spirit counters Infectious Fight does not mean it will ‚Äúbecome meta‚Äù. Its not like an ‚ÄúIron Will and Lightweight hard counter Spirit‚Äôs entire power‚Äù sort of thing, its a ‚Äúwow calm spirit, an absolute garbage perk, will counter Shit your pants, another garbage perk. Therefore Calm spirit will be meta.‚Äù yeah just no.
---
Why do you think it‚Äôs bad? 
---
I really feel the stealth people. I can play a match amd never even see someone. I guess its a play style. Its just annoying. Say there are 3 gens left. No one is ever at one because they hide as soon as they are in radius and you know they are going somewhere because you have to damage the gen again. I mean it farms me gatekeeper points so i cant complain too much. 
---
Answer you are looking for ‚Äî‚Äî^
---
In this thread: Survivors complaining about one of the (If not the most) underpowered killer in DbD: Legion.
---
I was constantly getting rank 20-19 killers when playing with a friend the other night. It was actually so boring. 
---
Well they would puke with a deathgarden mask somehow anyway... 
---
The perk is a meme, the exhaustion effect needs changing to a cool down.
---
Almost every single killer on console hardcore tunnels one person the entire match because they have NOED and know that it will at least get them another kill they dont deserve.
---
Once you approach red ranks and you have one piece of bloody clothing or a DLC outfit on, get ready for the ebony mori spam. 
---
Survivors are immersed and its a total snooze fest, as killer and as a survivor
---
Queue times are shit.
---
Frames are garbage on a game with PS2 tier graphics. 
---
Its unacceptable.
---
It depends if the killer is annoying or not
---
We're not worthy
---
What's this about?? 
---
Tekken by Dwightlight
---
Imagine thinking Urban Immersion is better than Lightweight.
---
*2
---
wait, it says "new killer michael myers" but he isn't in the game, only "the shape" does this mean... that "the shape" is but a shadow of the true evil within?
---
...this got really deep for a second.
---
Only 11k? Get those grab points and breaking gens,pallets and hit points.
---
&gt;head to head with Head
---
Well actually, all 4 survivors together should be as powerful as the one killer.
---
So it makes sense to nerf certain meta‚Äôs considering 4 people without any form of communication, other than a teabag and a point, have not only a chance at winning, but can also dominate if coordinated correctly.
---
Its 4 on paper, in practice its 3, with franks on paper its 3 and in practice its 2.
---
Hey, 2 people aren't doing gens now, maybe 3 people aren't. We also don't know it's effective range and purposefully running right next to a locker is gonna look real obvious
---
I personally find it easy to lose a Legion, because of him being 'tired' (Like the Nurse 'Stun') after he applies his second Feral Frenzy hit.  
---
After him doing so, he's power bar is depleted and usually you'll need a while for it to recharge + you've been 'stunned' for a brief moment + you end up just being a 110% killer in that time.  
---
This is enough time to lose/juke him.  
---
But that's just my opinion.  
---
Maybe all those Legions I went up against were just straight up bad, or I was better than them.  
---
But I don't see Legion as broken; Just as severely underpowered.
---
Dwight was always the chad. Shirtless Dwight when?!
---
*best perk by far in the shrine*
---
&gt;this is shit ok then
---
and soon depending on the plagues sickness powers, both legion and nurse mains will be like that
---
The Switch version looks great!
---
Just wait for her res addons
---
I mean you can kind of say the same thing about killers 
---
Except you'll be leaving bloodstains and have to stand still to mend, and only bad Legions won't be able to track you back down afterwards. That's what gives them no counterplay. Stay in chase, they just stab you 9 times and you go down. Escape, you have to mend + then they just follow your jam trail and stab you and you go down (or you try to run and get downed cos your deep wounds timer ran out)
---
Ironic, he could woosh others but not himself...
---
This is a high quality meme right there folks
---
You need to be in the locker for a couple seconds before it‚Äôll stun so you can‚Äôt just jump in and out 
---
r/wooosh
---
The Pig is from Charlotte's Web dude. Fucking terrifying as a child.
---
Lol im rank 4-1 and there is noed almost every game, and ds could be countered but not hard counters  
---
Sad is slowly looking down and turning around. 
---
Actually did this after missing 2 hatchets on a close meg, she just stared at me like "really?"
---
The issue with the key idea is that it becomes the exact same thing after a while. The killer will then find a chest (maybe they notice one that wasn't there before), and camp that. The whole camping thing is what makes hatch stand offs so boring.
---
  
---
Personally I think the idea of the killer being able to close it is awful. Whenever I have a situation with 1 survivor left looking for the hatch I find it before them 99% of the time. I think a better option would be to remove hatch grabbing but have a radius around the hatch that is a one-hit down. That way it's a bad play for the killer to wait ON the hatch because they won't know what direction the survivor will come from. It also gives the killer a way to outplay it, and it's fair for the survivor. Also, it doesn't take as long as the chest situation, it'll be over a lot faster. 
---
I'd say because you can throw a bottle over the pallet to hit the survivor and quickly break the pallet so you can get the most out of your bottle 
---
all i reccomend is a add on rework (and remove extra blink ones and make fragile wheze ultra rare) and maybe reduce her blink range by 2-4 meter and blink speed is slightly reduced and she should be fine
---
Nothing OP, he's just generally boring and unfun. 
---
Considering that nearly eradicated diseases are coming back bc of anti-vaxers, yeah they're becoming numerous enough to present a problem.
---
The killer would still camp it to prevent them coming over to open it. 3 seconds isn't long. That doesn't really solve the issue except potentially just prolong the problem and make it easier for the killer. They need to balance it so both have a way to outplay it. Letting the killer simply close it isn't really fair. 
---
Survivors, so far, have hated *every* and I mean EVERY killer.
---
How about Freddy‚Äôs bitches
---
Robert E. O. Speedwagon!
---
&gt; only bad Legions won't be able to track you back down afterwards. That's what gives them no counterplay. 
---
I think same could be said about Freddy, as soon as you enter the dream state.  
---
"He gets Wallhack. Only a bad Freddy won't be able to track you down afterwards." Still there is a lot of counter play involved.  
---
Like I said - and downvote me all you want:
---
&gt;This is enough time to lose/juke him.  
---
But I don't see Legion as broken; Just as severely underpowered. 
---
Your dick is probably going to rot away immediately, but hey go for it, live your dream
---
I feel like getting stuck on things has become more of a problem in the last couple of weeks, otherwise it's sheer coincidence this has happened to my friends and me several times recently. I got stuck inside a jungle gym (those little alcoves where totems sometimes spawn) and my friend got perma-stuck on a random rock and couldn't move till the killer downed them. Hadn't had it happen before :S
---
lmao I leveled up Quentin first, 
---
Meg and Claudette were the last I leveled up.
---
More like 3. 
---
It needs to be based on a certain amount of time. Otherwise the killer could just vomit on everything on the map. That would be way too op. 
---
It takes forever to farm so most just prefer to kill and move on.
---
Because they are bad, and they spent the entire PTB whining about how bad Legion was, so now that they're losing games to him all the time they can't say "he's too strong, plz nerf", so they have to come up with some other bullshit to justify to themselves how much they suck at the game.
---
Looks awesome! I‚Äôd love to pay you for a commission!
---
Why are you wooshing? I can't see anyone not understanding the joke.
---
I'm a big fan of thanatophobia and surveillance 
---
You tried, I guess. 
---
wE lIvE iN a SoCiEtY
---
But she's a Babylonian priestess. It would seem...very strange
---
Your perception does not change what the numbers are.
---
It's her normal 24 metre terror radius (modified by perks like Distressing), centered on her husk. 24 meters from the husk, no wooshing. Further away: wooshing, unless you're running prayer beads.
---
im tunneling and face camping when she gets released shes just so thicc 
---
But wont you try and disrespect the pallet anyway ? Or is it different with him
---
I know it's a meme, but it's sad that this happens so often.
---
My first surv match of the day today I literally spawned on a totem, killer physically couldn't make it toe before I cleansed it. Feels bad. 
---
I mean i usually disrespect but i guess its incase they stay or they throw it early 
---
This is me whenever a huntress has insta hatchets 
---
i only play legion when i have dailys and can confirm people dc when they see legion i dont even have 1 level in the bw
---
You say that but I still see people complaining about it lol
---
"Survivor main at rank 1 btw".
---
Its still kinda confusing me _just a little bit_ , ive seen many clowns run it instead of enduring
---
but how do ya'll get those buns to stay up cause I have tried a thousand times and I always end up with a floppy ballsack within 20 minutes 
---
Yep I got them too. According to the net it's because  I got the slim version 
---
Oh my god, this can't be real. I'm litterally shaking and crying right nowüò®üò∞üò∞
---
4K is definitely a loss, you did not receive the huge bonus by escaping.
---
If you die but pip and 2 make it out, I would consider that a win/draw and if all 4 escape, you demolished the killer 
---
The numbers are that first hit with feral frenzy has no whipe and replenishes your metre allowing you to follow up with a second hit easy. This makes the first and second hit the same hit in pracitce.
---
I suppose the TR also shrinks by 16m once the survivor gets out of chase
---
Her body shape is viewed as sexy out here in the US and Canada(maybe, Canada‚Äôs kinda weird)
---
Link to the original image, please?
---
Americans love their fatties. 
---
Bill real Dummy
---
Still don‚Äôt understand why ? Nurse is way worse. 
---
I thought so, but it is cool that they are bringing more body types into the game.
---
Cant access my pc rn, whats the new shrine ?
---
Game doesn't end the chase before you down them (you'll see your points on the side when you exit the chase during blood wipe). Pretty sure you'll have the TR boost from MAA
---
For me it happens only when my pc overheats or I have too much stuff in the background running. So id say its a performance thing
---
Ooh right. 
---
OMG THANK YOU AND THANKS TO EVERYONE NOT DOWNVOTING 
---
PETER CAN SEE BETTER WITH HIS SPIDER ABILITIES AND THATS WHY HIS SIGHT IS BLURRY WITH GLASSES ON
---
The survivor that comes with The Shape is named Laurie Strode, much like Michael Myers' sister. I think you should try and look into the survivors lore, maybe that'll give some clarity?
---
If you want successful endgames then it is since his power is so weak. 
---
Had this in my last game, we walked into each other, had a moment of silence and stared off, then followed by the familiar screech.
---
But it all changed when he activated Iron Maiden
---
Most likely it‚Äôll  work as you said, but I wonder can we use the power without fully charging (like Huntress hatchets) or do we need to fully charge and keep holding M2 until we want to use it (like Leatherface).
---
That must mean...hold on.../u/Arachnid1 is The Shape?!

---
yeah calm spirt prevents you from screaming
---
Oh yah. However i see the best potential of this perk after you down someone to slug with coulrophobia. If you're chasing someone, why would you want to change your tr by like 10m? But this perk might be completely useless if it's duration is really short but we'll see
---
Wow that's really sad...just keep trying and you will get it eventually! (and lose all bloodpoints because of that)
---
(Laughs in Arrested Development)
---
Because after a few years, teabagging at the exit gate is just... [disgusted noise]
---
People don't understand that it's probably very easy to bait out the same way you bait pallets (because once killer does action on locker you can't rush out, so it's like trying to pallete stun a Myers with tombstone)
---
Add to this all the people running enduring, making perk completely worthless.
---
Been playing this game since it came to consoles. I used to experience what you're talking about until I upgraded to the Xbox One X. Since then, I don't experience any of that. 
---
Myers: so do you know what the problem is?
---
Clown: *hitches pants* weelp, see what y‚Äôgot here is is a standard case of dwightrot.
---
Myers: oh no mr clown is it serious?
---
Clowns: shucks son call me kenny and given time it might be. See these pizzaboys love to get up in all the damp, enclosed spaces and just sit there leaving all kinds of mess behind which only brings in more vermin like crows and such, y‚Äôleave a dwight in a locker long enough you get yourself a case of the Head ons and hoo boy i got a client down and the auto wreckers and he had all kindas troubles with dwights infesting just about every locker he had! Some folks just refuse to spay and neuter their dwights i tell you what
---
Its a legion too! Grest gaming experience 
---
If its not a joke, then Ill answer. Make sure you played the full tutorial before getting into a game, it will teach you the basics. Generators are one of the central pillars of this game
---
*disconnect noise*
---
Um..
---
People catch on really quick when I bring my "give survivors free blood points" nurse build. The hug fest in the end game chat is always fun, but there's always that one guy that wants to play "normal" and ends up hooked. I won't force you to farm, but if you don't want to participate I'll gladly escort you out.
---
Not Latina enough
---
You need to be in the locker for a bit before the perk stuns the killer I am pretty sure 
---
jeez, you missed the joke to the joke my dude.
---
Question: why didnt you grab your friend with borrowed time let him take a hit and you all run out?
---
Good to know... I also got those for drops as surviver sometimes for some reason 
---
Arthritis: Age and overuse has weakened your knees. When you crouch at least twice in rapid succession you are afflicted tremendously by hindered/mangled/exposed until you complete a mend action. Each time you break your knee caps the mend time increases by 10 seconds. If you have a medkit you can use a secondary action to eat the painkillers inside of it, giving you a third health state but making you unable to work on generators. You're not supposed to operate heavy machinery while on your medication.
---
*Tsssss... Ahhhhh.*
---
Thicc is big
---
How tf do you get thicc from sporty girls lol
---
I get so mad at some people when they DC just because the killer finds them first. I appreciate when the killer lets me finish a gen and take the hatch when my mates DC. It sucks for both of us. 
---
Found the person that ruins the fun even MORE for the other survivors
---
Yeah I plan on doing survivors next
---
Nah, that can't be truth. 
---
It's not the community as a whole, here are lots of killers and survivors who despise camping.
---
Found the gen jockey
---
By lifting weights.
---
Probs not entering the meta to the point if BBQ or Ruin,  but I could see Shit your pants, or, depending on duration, intervention being pretty popular
---
I actually love this idea as a separate game mode. I think it‚Äôd be super fun and hilarious. The proximity chat could apply to both the killer and survivors. I would absolutely love to fuck around like this; it would be realistic and hilarious.
---
Imagine being a killer and you‚Äôre walking around and you hear a faint squeak to your right and there happens to be a locker there, and then someone screams ‚ÄúFUCK NO GOD PLEASE NO‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm 12 at heart and would make sex sounds whenever the killer was near me. 
---
Unfortunately though, while a game mode like this has the potential to be both fun and hilarious, it also has equal potential to be toxic. You‚Äôd have SWF groups who would just insult and bully the killer the entire game, and would ruin it for everybody else. 
---
Would still be fun to see it implemented. The possibilities are endless.
---
"1 single game" "90% of the time" Yeaaa sure 90% of 1 game was an annoying killer. Good job with the numbers mate.
---
I actually left shortly after the legion came out haha
---
Anything new besides that?
---
Thats also true. Guess both our points are right in a way
---
Fun Fact: The role of Laurie Strode was originally played by actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who has since stated publicly that the ‚Äúbest screen kisser‚Äù she has ever worked with is actor/comedian/extraterrestrial contactee/former Ghostbuster Dan Aykroyd
---
Oooh I definitely know what you mean, I love using windstorm and swift hunt, it's like softcore hillbilly.
---
We Canadians good sir are more into strong lumberjack women! Good day sir
---
My question is how long does the infection last on objects or is it permanent
---
&lt;3
---
Confirmed kill
---
I like your thinking, though I have amendments:
---
 At base, being fully Infected will only cause you to vomit, but vomiting will interrupt actions, like when you scream as a result of Madness.
---
Status effects will come as a result of add-ons. Speaking of which; add-ons will include:
---
Brown/yellow/green/(possibly) purple - charge time reduction and infection buildup increase.
---
Yellow/green - status effects e.g. Mangled, hindered, blindness, etc. Also increased time for Survivors to cure themselves.
---
Green/purple - fewer fountains. 
---
Purple - Infected Survivors are Broken. See aura/notification when Survivors vomit. (separate add-ons) 
---
Iridescent - Infected Survivors are Exposed and (separate) every X seconds, one fountain becomes corrupted.  
---
So much for sportsmanship then
---
It seems others aren't understanding your question. I'm not 100% sure, but i think its around 16 meters. It is less than her 24 meter terror radius
---
Yes. Any perks that say ‚ÄúBonus to a category‚Äù in them will only contribute to the in game 8k cap. So Distressing, ToTH, Beast of Prey, Prove Thyself, No One Left Behind, all of the offerings for bonuses to a specific category will only let you reach its cap faster. The only way to have a bonus in the end game is by using BBQ and Chili and WGLF. 
---
You're bang on
---
What else could it possibly be? 
---
Alright, thanks
---
Nah... none of the killers are connected to the movies. I mean like the movies dont a bloody Claudette in the bushes and every time a closet opens in ANY movie a Dwight doesnt come out. 
---
The shape does have some insperation from the Michal... but is Myers a proffesional moonwalker in the movies? No.
---
Also, anytime the lights flicker in a house... there's no gens any where. Its especially unbelievable an hour into the movie because gens dont take that long! 
---
Mabey very broadly take inspiration. But not really...
---
If the gates are powered, what are they supposed to do?
---
If there a more gens left, then they‚Äôre shit killers who can‚Äôt get kills normally.
---
Well from my experience, there's usually someone ready to unhook nearby. So I'll do a few loops around the hook looking for anyone, then I'll leave, looking back periodically.
---
Hey guys, just got to level 2 on my Claudette, please be gentle it‚Äôs my first post on here also shirtless Myers xD
---
The only way to win is to stop playing.
---
I'll take that over a team of four chickenshit pussies any day.
---
Good job!!!
---
Now we need that the skill checks in game stop going 15 fps XD
---
Shirtless myers xD
---
New killer xD
---
Dwight locker xD
---
Jane thicc xD
---
Decisive nerf xD
---
Trash spirit, a good spirit would have realized you urban evading by suddenly not seeing scratchs marks and not hearing you run thus immediately turning and omae wa mo shindeiruing you.
---
This is what happens when you leave a Dwight in a locker too long.... he weaponized the locker now!!! 
---
I can‚Äôt wait to use the new d strike and see legions get hit with it over and over again when they try to continually tunnel like they do literally every single game I‚Äôve played against a legion
---
Surname of the new survivor
---
Agreed, many a Bill are the last to leave after helping their fellow survivors out.
---
Off topic but sorry to the Bill whom I put a RBT on and downed after the gate was opened. Just doing a daily sir. 
---
Rlprequelmemes is leaking
---
I say just make it a proximity 1st thing. If its open and survivor is first one there you jump in, no grab. If the killer is there, instant mori or grab. Done deal. If the killer is camping you know very well not to try so back to a generator and hope it draws them to you once its done (or blow it up)
---
Id argue this new ds is weaker than the current ds but okay
---
I thought it was based off of that one Ed Sheeran song.
---
I see your point, but take marth, ardetha or true, they never miss and never get counter played, once a nurse is a certain skill level your not winning. 
---
Legion requires no skill to play so any schmuck can pick this junkie up and make a team miserable. Meanwhile a nurse is like the fucking Jedi of killers. Months to years of thankless labour only to whiff at a P3 claudette. Leave Nurse be. She's earned her spot.
---
HAHAHAHAH totally!!!!!
---
Yeah but how much time am I supposed to invest in her. This is by far the most frustrating experience in this game. 
---
WOW OMG 
---
That's stupid. That's the worst theory I've ever seen. The shape is based on the many different polygons he's made from, the nightmare is named after what it's like to play as him and the pig just has a pig head. No idea about the cannibal though. He just seems like a ripoff of the hollbilly
---
I didn‚Äôt even know there was one, I thought it just stood you up and did the other animation
---
She is not fat. She is curvy!!! 
---
She is meant to be a "normal" person. By normal I mean not a runner, not a teenager, not a bodybuilder... Just a mom with a nice body.
---
DS+Head on
---
Against tunneling killers? Absolutely not weaker. Each survivor with DS immediately becomes the obsession when unhooked so even when someone has to farm you off without borrowed time, you get the chance to hit DS before the pickup animation begins so that the killer can‚Äôt just put you right back on the hook.... it gives you the fair opportunity to escape at the very least which is denied by camping/tunneling killers who can immediately down you following an unhook
---
That is genuinely a cool fact. Lovely
---
The nea stereotypes are only modestly true, but I am one to leave once the gates are open even if there are teammates on the hook
---
It‚Äôs a mind game at blind loops. You have to predict if they will keep running or double back. Keep playing and you‚Äôll start to see a pattern in survivor behavior and how they try to dodge a nurse. 
---
r/wish
---
YO HOLY SHIT I KNEW IT THE CANIBAL WAS GROM THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DED! I KNEW IT!!!!!
---
People complaining about it is inevitable. Thats why i said "Most" and not "All".
---
For sure there was someone nearby or the gates were open. If theres not the case, then the killer lost because get genrushed
---
yeah, they have similar problems... kind of, but nurse requires you to actually learn her and learning how to blink precisely takes a while imo. especially those ultra long range blinks. while legion is... whatever. there is no big difference between a good legion and a beginner legion (assuming both players are equal skill)
---
nooooo really 10/10 no idea whata theory
---
-be bhvr
---
-nerf ds
---
-introduce perk that¬¥s similar but just with lockers
---
I don't think downvoting a simply stated opinion is necessary really, but I also haven't been able to understand (yet) what your ambition with this statement is. is your motive to discuss everyone's possibly very diverse perceptions of her body type? because if so, some will find her physique aesthetically pleasing, and some will not. some will find the term 'fat' insulting, some will take it simply as an adjective without any negative or judging implications. maybe you can clarify?
---
useless? they still get the notification
---
Bing Bi√∂ng
---
I don't get why you're being downvoted. It was obviously going to be a Dwight meme. Lockers = Dwight
---
It doesn't reward killers for being bad, it enabled killers to come back from a bad generator game IF the survivors ignored the totems. Even then, it usually only nets a single kill. It's really not that strong/bad as most people make it out to be. And it has mutliple counterplays.
---
Most people seem to dislike it because they think that as soon as the exit gates are powered, the killer has "lost" and is not "entitled" to get another kill. But NOED is just like other endgame perks in this regard. The game is not over until everyone escaped. 
---
Up until then: be careful!
---
How is it irrational to have an immense fear of those 2 things? Like Coulrophobia is irrational because clowns aren‚Äôt dangerous but those 2 aren‚Äôt.
---
Made with mematic
---
Well yeah, if you‚Äôre going to get mori‚Äôd then you‚Äôre going to get mori‚Äôd... nothing will ever stop that from happening, and I don‚Äôt have a problem with that. You just have to accept it when you get mori‚Äôd and move on, unfortunately. I‚Äôd much rather have that then get continuously put on the hook and die without the killer having to use a rare offering to kill me with. Also, how many times have you seen a camping/tunneling killer use enduring? They usually steer clear of that because they‚Äôre bad and don‚Äôt realize how good of a perk it is. It‚Äôs funny how many killers camp with bbq and nurses. And yeah, if a killer absolutely wants you dead then in the end they will get their way. Nothing can change that. The old DS didn‚Äôt change that either. The new one, however, does a better job at that
---
Camping happens at the lower ranks. It doesn't happen nearly as much at the higher ranks. You get wrecked as a killer trying to camp at higher ranks. As for you idea that killers have better perks, that's subjective and not worth arguing something you've made your mind up on. FWIW I play more survivor than I do killer, but I am a rank 1 killer (on console).
---
I mean no one likes having their offerings or items wasted but that‚Äôs some pretty heavy entitlement right there mate...
---
We can have, "The Cure" Ya know? 
---
This is a repost.
---
Jesus. At what point do you call that poor design. Having to sink hundreds of hours into a single killer to get decent at it when you can master all the other killers in probably the same amount of time. 
---
"The crow"
---
I prefer Claudette personally, but I won't deny that Jane is thicc.
---
This is very accurate 
---
So...she‚Äôs could possibly be a priest, historian, maybe?
---
Oh wow, I did not know this!
---
I'm planning to create that game mode next week. Thanks for your feedback!
---
Hmm. I actually always suspected that the shape could be Michael Myers, but im just not sure.
---
I agree on everything exept for the range reduction becouse the main skill required to play nurse is muscle memory on the blink, so changing it would make all the time and practice some players put into nurse wasted.
---
As for the extra blink addons, I agree 100%. Maybe keep 1 extra blink for ultra rare but that's it. It takes no skill to hit someone with 3 blinks. 2 is more than enough to get the hit in and offer counterplay
---
Fine swine! Wish she was mine!
---
The survivor Jane Romero was described as basically being DBD's Oprah.
---
Ur ok.  I was just trying to be sure.  
---
I thought the shape was from Texas chainsaw massacre
---
Okay now I‚Äôm P3ing her ü§£
---
Do you think the legion is based off the legion or disconnect franchise? 
---
R u ok, Feng Min?
---
Yeah I always go for the unhooker anyways as it‚Äôs more efficient but I just like poking fun at the devs
---
Also no matter where you go everyone is chanting that's thicc. So it's really great that she's not the religious one.
---
We need more killers like this. The amount of toxicity pooling in some lobbies is insane
---
That's a good thing.
---
OH MY GOD, what a discovery you have here!
---
Another reason to P3, please, keep talking!  Btw is the PTB even out yet?
---
I shouldn't have watched this at breakfast.
---
Well you‚Äôre on console lol. I main Nurse on console and I tell ya he‚Äôs wrong. It took me 24 hours to learn how to consistently get 4ks like other killers. If you are trying to learn Nurse here are a few things to remember. Have a warm up game, never blame the game for a missed blink, (you‚Äôll get angry real quick) tight loops are bad so make distance between you and the survivor, you don‚Äôt need to use your blinks all the time, (If you can mindgame something or just land a hit do it, don‚Äôt blink) and finally, survivors will think you are bad from the beginning. Use this to your advantage. Punish cocky actions and make sure to not wear cosmetics. It‚Äôs like wearing electric pants with Claudette.
---
Captain Kirk DLC confirmed
---
Lmao yeah I thought about this.
---
I hope you get fat.
---
If the PTB is out yet, nobody's told me about it. All we were told is that it would be released "this week".
---
You know what disgusts me? People who expect others to sacrifice their own experience in order to abide by your imaginary ruleset, and people who cry lagswitch in a game with horrid netcode 'cause they can't ever take blame. 
---
Just stay gone then.
---
It is actually considered holding the game hostage but they ban on a case by case basis. They won‚Äôt up and ban someone straight away, but you send them footage of the match and a screenshot of the aftermatch scoreboard and they‚Äôll determine if it was intentional / how long the person did it. 
---
If they determine that the person was experienced enough to know they were hiding to be a prick, and they hid for a significant amount of time, then they will issue a temporary ban.
---
It‚Äôs worth noting though that as long as you actually try to do a gen then you‚Äôre in the clear/safe from being considered holding the game hostage, but if there‚Äôs 4 gens left and the killer sends in a clip of him patrolling all the gens for like 5-10 minutes and none of them get touched then the survivor is likely to get a small temp ban.
---
Okay cool, reaaaally wanna play this new chapter.  Been the most interesting one since Curtain Call imo
---
This goes deeper than we thought.
---
I plan on trying it out in a "Chaser Freddy" build with Bamboozle, Enduring, and Brutal Strength/Fire Up. I rarely chase or loop with him and prefer to just ping pong between targets when 3-4 survivors are alive. 
---
So with ultra rare add ons it's kind of viable...
---
You‚Äôll know you‚Äôre good at nurse when you get consistent DC‚Äôs
---
That's a weird way to spell Claudette, but I know what you mean. Though since I main Jake I fully expect him to have a deafening wail when he pukes.
---
Is the speed the exact same or did you approximate it?
---
You need to be in the locker for 3 seconds before you can use Head On.
---
There is actually. Downing the unhooker was always easier since the BT nerf.
---
Nah, David and Meg just bought a house together. 
---
"Ok so I was thinking we could put the table here"
---
1) The sliding is a bug in the game that will probably (?) be fixed in the new patch.
---
2) Those are farming killers (bots) who are doing that for whatever reason. They modded their controller to press the same button(s) over and over again so they keep getting to play lobbies without actually being idle. They do it to derank or to gain some extra BP when the survivors want to ‚Äòabuse‚Äô this. I believe this is what you meant
---
Well i'll try
---
I thought p or hated Legion because of the annoying mending thing and then he can just track down another one after hitting you.
---
WOKE
---
Hope it works my dude
---
Because this Subreddit is filled with entitled survivor mains.  
---
I used to post here regually a long while ago and it seemed balanced.
---
People giving constructive criticism. People giving feedback. People shitposting; Just the usual.  
---
Then I took a 6 months break from this reddit and DbD as a whole, and after starting to browse this subreddit again I am not sure what happened.  
---
Underpowered killer, who is strong in 1 particular thing - but SUCKS TRASH in every other aspect.
---
People on this subreddit:  
---
"This one particular thing is broken. NERF THA THING."  
---
People still complaining about DS. (Downvoted).  
---
"Well, uhm. You got NOED, don't shu?" (Instantly 100.000 upvotes)  
---
Killer have been sucking for years.
---
Of course not, but the entity doesn‚Äôt let time go forward. I can‚Äôt imagine she could have survived down there for very long, so I still think she‚Äôs very young, definitely not past a young teenager. The transformation aged her body, but likely not her mind.
---
Holy shit i just realised, this truly is high quality
---
That doesn't make any sense, try harder if you're trying to insult somebody lol
---
Proof? 
---
is this a fucking ochido video
---
Pretty much the same. If I go down, I go down because the killer is good or I messed up big time. I juked a great nurse player and she immediately adapted to it after the 3rd iteration. That deserve a props and a ggwp for me even if I died that game. 
---
where is this from tho
---
I really wish I wasn't broke or I would give you gold. 
---
Just some attention-hungry e-girl, report and move on.
---
^241th
---
No. They literally said exactly that the killer would be able to hear it during its duration. 
---
I thought it was that one movie where the woman hooks up with a fish.
---
Its edited in... 
---
It‚Äôs easy to loop nurse if the killer can‚Äôt control her
---
The legion and nurse hold power over who wins the chase and does not rely on survivors making mistakes in order to catch them because their power actually gives them the tools to counter to absurd amount of flexibility survivor's have when getting chased. 
---
Update: this wasn't supposed to be accurate or serious. I was just excited to get a survivor with dark hair and eyes that wasn't Feng.
---
Is that pedo still alive 
---
Are you trying to get something on r/whoosh
---
cant put in M2 as the skillcheck key :( - need to rebind my mouse to use it - apart from that, like it
---
shatners movement speed would be an easy 130%. all that fidgeting in the captains chair has made him super agile
---
It also counters Iron Maiden (you don‚Äôt scream when leaving a locker) so it‚Äôs likely to counter this since we saw the scream animation on the dev stream
---
That would be a cool idea, it will be added in the future, thanks for your feedback, now I'll just have to add New Brand Part and work at the Overcharge perk
---
The only people that steal from me are Neas when I only try to say I have a Key. Fuck Nea :( 
---
Awesome info!  What do the rulers do, btw?  It really bothers me that for a killer considered ‚Äúbrain dead‚Äù to play, I can‚Äôt grasp shit on. 
---
Whenever I play Spirit I change my Name into "Spirit(ed away)" and my Profile Pic into this :

I love these stupid memes xD
---
The bloodweb expands indefinitely (yh u can)
---
Christ you‚Äôre dumb.
---
The rulers increase the rate at which your frenzy refills, so you wait less time before you can use your frenzy again (you‚Äôve probably seen that it needs to fill to a certain point before you can use it) and if you need it to fill a good bit of the way before activation, then you spend less time running around normally in a chase.
---
The addons themselves don‚Äôt give a crazy numbers tweak but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a pretty underrated addon for people who don‚Äôt moonwalk.
---
On all the posts they‚Äôve made, flair has been missing. 
---
that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and if youve actually watched the halloween movies, you would know that it's impossible. 
---
so the only purpose to prestige is to get achievements or get bloody clothes?
---
Balance Landing. The builds depend on your playstyle.
---
Sure, I already worked at mouse binding, after I properly test it, it will be added. In the future I will add support for controller too
---
Everyone also knows that a semi-decent nurse with a head on their shoulders is just as miserable to play against. And killer who ignores certain game mechanics is a bad time. For the survivors at least.
---
You mean perks? Personally I'd go for Bond, Balanced Landing, Prove Thyself and Urban Evasion but that's just me and my gen rushing build
---
So the shape was not Will Smith?!
---
I knew they were familiar! 
---
Missed opportunity to say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get out of it until I was# HEAD ON#‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve avoided rulers to this point, but I‚Äôm definitely going to give it a shot now. I don‚Äôt moonwalk and it seems like the ruler would have helped in many scenarios 
---
Also a Nurse-main (well she's one of my mains) after 5 games it started becoming easier and easier. 
---
Also you dont balance around skill, Nurse is broken in an out, more broken than Legion, Legion is just newer. 
---
Wow, thanks matpat, that is an interesting theory, seems hardly believable tho... I myself thought Shape is based on Sans the skeleton from popular game Undertale, since both of these characters have white faces and their names start with S.
---
Wow was the spirit super predictable or something I main spirit (when I don‚Äôt play survivor) and I gotta say I‚Äôve survived maybe a minute before I got down by them
---
\-Remove every extra blink add-on
---
\-Reduce her post-blink lunge
---
\-Redo the way range add-ons apply their effect
---
That is the bare minimum. 
---
Still going on the merry go round called a loop with that 110% movement speed killer, take a guess
---
Apparently you get better perks more often but I've never prestiged anyone
---
And as a killer I ignore the teabagger 
---
Yeah i like to do gens more than pallet looping so is this the best build?
---
I can't sass that. 
---
Legion has many reasons to be hated my guy
---
Nah man huntress boar costume
---
That would be a pretty hilarious situation. 
---
i dont want to click on this is this real
---
"Nobody escapes Death. Except that guy. He's okay, I guess, but the other 3 definitely don't get to escape it. Probably."
---
Huntress x Feng Min porn.
---
Couldn't complete a single gen. I would prefer it if i could bind it to m2.
---
Good eye, friend. Though I'm on a phone and it was hard to see until I zoomed in. Still, super quality meme.
---
Very thank
---
I hope you're being satirical
---
I play both as well, and I have to disagree on the "poor sportsmanship" defense.  "Fair play" is using everything at your disposal to achieve your objective, as long as it isn't outright cheating.  A particular tactic being pissing off a survivor/killer is, honestly, irrelevant IMHO.
---
One day one day 
---
Oh hey it's the sad edgelord. Nice.
---
LOOOL I‚Äôm fucking dying, take my upvote sir
---
I said I'm buying a pc for multiple reasons, a tiny one of them is for dbd. That's if you even read what I said
---
You're smarter than most killers then. 
---
If there was no 8 trap limit then trapper could literally trap every single square inch on ground on the map until the game crashed. Same reason why hag has a limit.
---
Uhhh urban evasion, bond, sprint burst or dead hard and uhhh iron will would probably be better then it's inevitable that you will get chased eventually but this should help you live your gen jockey life :)
---
No dude, you are wrong. Shes actually from the movie Babe
---
And what about prove your self
---
Nurse is a very strange killer. You can get her movement down after a couple hours, but you need to be able to read the survivors and mindgame to get real success from her. You have to be able to tell if a survivor is inclined to double back or turn right more than left and such, which is just something that comes with experience. Some survivors are easier to read than others, so you'll end up with varied results from your games. Practice makes perfect, so you're always improving whether it seems like it or not! 
---
Some women, no matter what they do, have wide hips and larger gluteus muscles. It‚Äôs called genetics. Her stomach doesn‚Äôt look big, and who knows, her BMI could be perfect, but her weight is spread to that area, thus making her look larger than she really is. I like the change - just like Jeff has a bit of a belly and huffs when he runs.  
---
Also, depending on the map, it can be very difficult to stay on someone after you go into fatigue as Nurse, especially after hitting someone and giving them a speed boost.
---
Some kid the McMillan Estate maps have so many boxes, after you look down, it is extremely frustrating to re-find someone you blink hit, at least for me.
---
I added that in because sometimes traps fail to catch people, and in that instance Trapper‚Äôs power is now working against him and he is blocking himself, which shouldn‚Äôt happen. A killer‚Äôs power should never work against them like that.
---
Are you sure? Hmmm
---
I‚Äôm not usually into conspiracy theories, but this one is pretty good. 
---
You never have to prestige if you don't want to. However, to get all perks you have to be around level 140 on your character, so yes, you can go way past 50.
---
Well yeah, that's my exactly my point though haha. Add-ons while farming feels like a waste of BP to me, which is why I farm on survivor. Rarely use reddit and was just popping in to give my 2 cents. Wasn't looking for an argument.
---
I've noticed the same thing, Fengs in general are the best survivors at running the killer around. 
---
&lt;breathing intensifies&gt;
---
Okay, so a killer who refused to go protect gens while someone was hooked would get punished for it by being looped by a survivor near the hooked survivor.  
---
By not camping, the hooked survivor would be unhooked anyway, so the killer is the one wasting their time and screwing themselves over in this situation, by, you know, protecting the wrong bloody thing.  
---
So, with all that said, how was this mechanic problematic, exactly?
---
Fair enough, have a nice day :)
---
Distressing, Monitor and Abuse, Shit Your Pants?
---
I think you might be onto something here
---
Dead hard?
---
Why would I need to change your mind from a popular opinion?
---
This subreddit is full of basement goblins, I swear. This was just for funzies and people take it so seriously. If I wanted attention then I would have less clothing on LOL. Thanks dude. 
---
More broken than Legion? How, yes her power is OP but only if you know how to use it. It is easyer to mind game a nurse than a Legion, Legion can avoid pallets and windows, I know the nurse can do that too but if a nurse is at a pallet and blinks to the other side the survivor can just vault to the other side as well Legion just does the same thing as the survivor so you can't mindgame him at a pallet or window and you can mindgame a nurse at a window and pallet.
---
He got his hand stuck in the passenger side window of his mom's minivan.
---
Seems farfetched but I'm open minded.
---
As survivor or killer I don‚Äôt like doing that when everyone dc‚Äôs. Feels like a waste of time
---
Survivors don't scream when Legion uses frenzy.
---
Guys wtf I‚Äôm shaking and crying rn this can‚Äôt be real
---
An actual r/whoosh has appeared! 
---
I rarely see any Jake players, but that's probably because his perks are meh other than iron will 
---

As a adam main I can confirm that we are the most helpful in all matches unless we have terrible teammates 
---
Heresy
---
That's fucking adorable
---
Thanks, you too!
---
*chuckles in deci-* **Oh Wait**
---
Alright, Nurse needs nerfs because hiding is boring. Let‚Äôs say we nerf Nurse. You know what survivors need since they can win 100/100 times against a killer without any counter play, because the game is over in 2 minutes? Nerfs. Just because something can be unstoppable doesn‚Äôt mean it will be every match, also god tier Nurse players don‚Äôt play Nurse every game.
---
Huh. Now that you mention it... I thought something looked familiar 
---
kphoto11 
---
Its black and white in some sort of bridge  or photo of a duck
---
Lol
---
The mechanic was problematic because some killers would move to leave the hooked survivor only to see another survivor rush in for a save. They would then chase this new survivor and the end result is a chase within the range of the hooked survivor slowing the hook kill timer while everyone focuses gen rushing. 
---
It wasn't a problem of "killer was refusing to protect gens" it was a problem of a killer leaving for gens and then barely walking away when new challenger came to them.
---
White knight
---
Can we stop sexualizing fictional characters please thank you...it's weird 
---
Yeah I think this perks not going to be that great. For sure enduring will shit on it, so I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôll be good for risky basement saves
---

This is a shitpost, in case you didn‚Äôt get it. I just forgot to tag it as such. 
---
New Trapper add-on:
---
The Rusty Nail,
---
Uncommon
---
Survivors who don‚Äôt have the vaccine add-on will have a timer and if they don‚Äôt go to a hospital in time they will die skipping the downed state, if the survivor uses the essential oil item it will half the current progression bar.
---
And the point of your post was just to say that? Or to get downvotes? Have mine then
---
Only if you stop doing it with regular people. 
---
It‚Äôs the pants that make her ass look big
---
But the nurse is hard to play tho...
---
I keep switching between range increaser add ons. And i dont have problems, so i doubt 2-4 meters would hurt
---
Damn. How did you even notice that!
---
Git gud.
---
My tactic , the left down- up right works... until she runs at me and I start to eat garbage and expect a blink :,)
---
who of them besides Panda is big? havent heard of any of them
---
Nice suggestion, glad to see people who also think trapper needs some love. I think if they aren't going to do a lot about trapper, they should give him 2 base traps without add ons(it never made sense to me why he only has 1 base trap and can carry 1), or give him the ability to carry as much traps as possible. They also need to increase the amount of traps in the map (not sure how much exactly but I think there's like 8 traps in the map and you only end up using like 5 of them in most games) trapper can be pretty strong with a few band-aid buffs. Not that he's weak right now but he could definitely use a buff
---
dbd battleroyale
---
*oh no*
---
Panda is mostly youtube, isn't he? The rest are all streamers, so that might be why you haven't heard of them. 
---
I think, they are joking or just messing around. Or BR stands for something else than Battle Royale.
---
Tapp main, can confirm
---
cause after 3. they went downhill. 
---
not my opinion. just stating others 
---
Damn, Jane out here double cheecked up.
---
Now stick "Left Behind" to it , sandbag all your fellow survivors and have an epic 2 Gen 1on1 with the killer. Would take urban evasion and pebble to finish the build.
---
Does the 20% bonus from Brutal Strength really make much of a difference?
---
They're all big enough that Behaviour invited them to the studios this week. Cahla and Morf were two of the original fog whisperers and Morf and Tofu had cosmetics in that Charity Case pack.
---
maybe, tbh I only know of Noob3, Pupper and that Talent guy as Streamers 
---
All I can say is...Vink gonna get ya! 
---
Beans Royale
---
Very accurate! (For the most part)
---
No, because then he actually has to come out of the locker... 
---
Can confirm the Jeff thing. I'll appear out of nowhere, unhook you, then disappear to do more gens. I'll die at the end to make sure you get out if necessary.
---
Been posted

Vink?

If you ever start having trouble with Legion I've got a guide here: [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49959/a-guide-to-legion#latest](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49959/a-guide-to-legion#latest)
---
Self Care, Adrenaline, Sprint Burst &amp; Bond is my go to build 
---
YO HELP ARE ANY OF THESE PERK GOOD FOR MY BELOVED HUNTRESS ? 
---
You shouldnt be playing with your third world connection
---
A survivor rushing in for a save isn't contributing to the objective, though, meaning you can just ignore them for the time being.  
---
The more pressure a killer puts on survivors that are actually doing the objective, the better.  
---
If a killer focuses on the wrong thing for too long, that's their own fault, and thus they deserve the loss.  
---
So, again, how was this mechanic problematic?
---
Nice best girl art
---
Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt a rhombus?
---
Legion is just easier to cheese a kill out. You still need fundamentals to be good,  but people find it unfun when they get tunnelled. Which is easier to soon legion.
---
Vinc3ntvega!  
---
I agree, together they form an impressive piece of artillery. 
---
Have you tried not staying at position 2 drooling on the ground while staring at the nurse arriving at position 1?
---
The T-Pose,
---
Rare The Shape Perk
---
Using this ability within 5 meters of a downed survivor will instantly charge you to your next tier of Evil Within,
---
Can only be used once per match.
---
Yeah yeah people keep saying that BUT look how fabulous and sassy he looks. Maybe it's his time to... come out?
---
Fucking hell if you think NOED competes with DS you're a moron.
---
DS has no solid counters at all.
---
NOED can be removed even before it can come into play.
---
No. Jane is a goddess, how dare you sully her finery!
---
Without a doubt a joke.
---
Vince also has his own cosmetic. 
---
let me Google that real quick 
---
Legion, if played to the strengths of their ability, doesn't require skill to play, and has little to no counterplay. Frenzy-stabbing someone over and over, or yet, breaking chase state and following a survivor in Deep Wound while intentionally keeping chase state broken, are tactics that both do not require much of any noteworthy amount of skill or thought.
---
You can try to stealth-juke after vaults or on loops, but that is unreliable and even if it does pay off, usually only buys you a few moments before being re-acquired. And you can try to pallet-stun Legion out of Frenzy, which is also unreliable given killer latency advantage, wonky registry through pallet drops, and both of that coupled with Legion's movement speed and weird Frenzy stabs that are full lunge range where the animation is merely a slash.
---
Nurse does require skill and thought to play and at least has some more-or-less reliable counterplay. There is more interactive and engaging gameplay happening as and against her, which in comparison to Legion just means, any at all. Nurse is an imbalanced design and people have known and said as much for years. Any somewhat-good-and-above Nurse quickly adapts to the ways in which a particular survivor behaves, and chaseplay turns into a series of 50/50 scenarios on every single blink, at best, which eventually just ends the chase - and usually in the matter of seconds. Additionally, even if you do out-move her well enough to gain significant distance on her, she can be back in 1-blink distance in no time.
---
Legion needs more of a rework. The Deep Wound timer certainly should not be tied to chase state, because it is an exploitable mechanic in that form. Tying it solely to proximity would be an easy solution. And the Feral Frenzy mechanics need to be adjusted to allow for counterplay. Why is there no cooldown on the slashes? Missing a slash should be punishable. A cooldown would also help with the fact that currently, spamming slashes gives you more distance out of your Frenzy duration. Additionally, vaulting pallets and windows should consume a certain extra amount of Feral Frenzy, making it so that duration management requires thought and timing, and that survivors actually gain something from out-moving Legion on pallets and windows, forcing them to have to vault multiple times and depleting Frenzy.
---
Nurse certainly needs adjustments, as well. First of all, some of her add-ons are downright ridiculous and need to be rebalanced. Her range add-ons do not only stack and increase blink speed on top of range, but their intended downside of decreasing "blink accuracy" is not actually a downside, because it doesn't do anything. Her range add-ons should not stack, and the blink inaccuracy stat should actually do something. Add-ons that add additional blinks should either be reworked completely, or come with decidedly more impactful downsides.
---
For base Nurse, I think removing her post-blink lunge would go a long way to make her a more strictly skill-based design. Her lunge is like a built-in, short-ranged third blink, allowing her to pause post-blink, trace a survivor and correct any mistakes within that radius. Giving her this extra safety net, or confidence interval, to correct for any imprecision in her blinks is just silly, especially given that you can simply hold M1 and flick your mouse, and will regularly connect on a survivor without needing much of any fast or precise reactions yourself. Taking away the lunge would require the Nurse player to be more accurate with their blinks, more speedy and precise with their reactions, and give survivors more chances to out-move a Nurse post-blink. If removing the lunge altogether turns out to be too much of a nerf, the post-blink lunge range could be scaled to the blink distance and amount. That is, the further you blink (i. e. the longer you charge the blink for), the shorter the post-blink lunge range; likewise, the more often you blink, the shorter the post-blink lunge range.
---
I had this happen once to me too. It's pretty amusing.
---
let me Google that 
---
Hey guys I see that white masked man out my window like in the back of the image lmao
---
Oh ok my bad bro...there are some people who do it unironically and those are the ones I'm mainly talking about
---
yes
---
Bet
---
Jane x hag
---
Here comes the Trapper!
---
Yes it‚Äôs true, lockers also hide you from Freddys dream world aura. 
---
Ik in the back of my mind that he looked like someone ik from a horror film i think you're onto something!
---
Bamboozle helps killers vault faster and blocks where you vaulted, agitation increases speed while transporting bodies.
---
Yes. It‚Äôs very noticeable. When you‚Äôre used to the slow kicking of pallets as every killer, getting that bonus speed is hella nice. I indulge myself in Super Sayian God Ghost Pallet Busting Wraith. Brutal Strength, Fire Up with Double Shadow Dance addons. No pallets are safe. No pallets will exist. 
---
Is this a r/wooosh bait
---
I don‚Äôt see it
---
Jane x Cupcakes
---
happy cake day 
---
This guy lol 
---
After reviewing the match I think he honestly didn‚Äôt understand how nurse‚Äôs calling works. ‚ÄúHello BHVR? Yeah she always knew where I was healing!! Ban her!!‚Äù
---
I thought the Nightmare was based on that episode of the Simpsons with willy the groundskeeper????
---
Ummm....finding real people attractive is way different  and way better than a fictional character so I don't get your point 
---
As a David main I completely agree. Sometimes I'm both in the same game.
---
Nurse takes a lot longer to master then hag, the hag is trap placement, the nurse is habit and mindgames, two different animals.
---
hey Girl wanna touch my scarf'  
---
Juggling....isn‚Äôt....a....counter?
---
Enduring isn‚Äôt a counter?!??
---
ü§î 
---
You watched Monto say it, didn't you? Lol, that's how I learned about it when I watched his most recent video. 
---
Yeah! Invisible killer? Spirit phase walking you by or with prayer beads? Stealthy pig? No problem! And the action speed is great in certain situations. I just really love the perk! 
---
Although it might be better for it to stay underrated or else people would be calling for a nerf lol. 
---
I am sure you got the point in the last comment.
---
de-throned 
---
Watched a squadette SWF pop haunted grounds in my face and had them all downed within a minute of the match starting, laughed my ass off. They might have learned to not pop a lit totem in front of a spirit
---
S i g h
---
Up to you really, never been big on doing gens with others it's usually better to distribute them i just feel like there is better perks you can take personally i forgot premonition or spine chill might be good too if you want to have a headsup too hide
---
Yeah, but I never tried it out lol
---
N o b o d y.    C a r e s
---
Bamboozle I don't think will be good for her as vaulting in front of her will be one hit and I don't know about agitation as I have iron grasp 3
---
Sprint burst is also really good in that build
---
Jeff and Kate have some chemistry and you can't deny it :( Also Jane really looks like she could have a cupcake like Dwight, but that's just my opinion (?)
---
THE HAG
---
I'm a thicc jake
---
I always new miguel myers looked alot like micheal myers
---
Hey imsuperhungry, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
My anti-chase build as Freddy is STBFL, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring.
---
While some killers view their objective as delaying gens (Myself included) many and arguably the majority of killer mains see their objective as killing survivors. While most people have the common sense to leave the hook after hooking someone, almost everyone will attack and chase people by the hook as it is a free survivor found and hit.
---
The problem was that the mechanic was turning non-campers into campers. You could have an honest killer hook somebody and try to leave when somebody just runs in. No sane killer will give away a free unhook and will give chase. This leads to the looper dragging the killer around a loop by the hook while the gens get rushed.
---
It let survivors use common sense to keep killers near the hooks so the timer would stop letting survs rush gens and then mob the hook to rescue the buddy.
---
This is a problematic because it lets survivors keep the killer near the hook to buy extra time for a gen rush. Will all survivors do this? No. However, some bad apples spoiled the bunch and now the mechanic won't be used. Time is a sensitive mechanic in DBD so the devs won't let hook timers be paused for anything.
---
Regarding Infectious Fright, it says "while another Survivor is put into the dying state with the basic attack" on the website. I guess it means that chainsaws and 1-hit-hatchet will NOT proc the perk. 
---
EVERY DAMN GAME HAS A DC! 
---
PLAY KILLER? HAVE A DC! NO, HAVE TWO!!
---
PLAY SURVIVOR? OTHER SURVIVORS DC! THEN THE KILLER DC'S!
---
I'm not OP, but I'd guess it's because you have to find a friend for Prove Thyself to help. 
---
Because Bond helps you find friends, it will always make gen rushing faster since you can just look for another gen jockey to be your pal.
---
bad bot
---
 I agree. Together they form a truly impressive piece of artillery. 
---
Nurse is the least fun/most annoying to go against imo. she just takes away the basics off chasing the game is about. makes you play a whole different game, which i'm not really keen on playing. majority of people dont mind vs nurse, as they play way too immersive anyways, so they end up doing better vs nurses. I see people all the time going on about 'You need to master the blinks which is really hard and takes a lot of time', which is correct, but i dont see anyone mention that nurses main don't even bother to know how to play structures, mind game and looping, which also takes a lot to master and also takes a lot of time. plus, the % of players that dont know how to play vs nurse is thru the roof. same cant be said about the % of players that know how to loop and play structures. Legion is annoying but i rather vs a legion than nurse anyday of the week.
---
I‚ÄôM MAD BECAUSE I DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT TO SAY THAT MAKES ME MAD, WHICH CAUSES ME TO BE MAD SINCE IT SEEMS BHVR ACRUALLY DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR AND IN THE FUTURE (EXCEPT MAYBE NO BBQ &amp; CHILI FOR SHRINE. INSTEAD, WE GOT THE WEAKER VERSION TO DELIVERANCE!)!!!
---
That's his best skin
---
WAS HELD HOSTAGE ON THE BASEMENT STEPS FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES WITH ANOTHER SURVIVOR. WON IN THE END WHEN HE TRIED TO MAKE A DEAL TO HOOK ME AND LET THE OTHER SURVIVOR ESCAPE. HAD DELIVERANCE READY TO GO AS SOON AS THE OTHER SURVIVOR ESCAPED AND GOT OUT THE GATES BEFORE THE KILLER COULD DOWN ME AGAIN. HAHA, FUCK YOU WRAITH!
---
Oh so its just normal then, afaik gen rushing is getting a lot of people to finish a gen very fast. If I understand your explanation bond helps finding other gens so you dont stay with others
---
personally, i like chubby over ripped so don't get yourself down
---
I CAN'T PLAY DEAD BY DAYLIGHT THIS WEEK BECAUSE I PLAYED TOO MUCH DEAD BY DAYLIGHT AND MY HAND HURTS. REEEEEEEE

I‚Äôll never get that high :(

Ooh, never realized he had a stream. I recognize most of the others, but that's because I devote a large amount of time watching DBD videos and streams lol

You're still a dick anyway mate.

If you donate only 5 shards a month, you too can keep my mate at least 20 meters away from all pallets for the rest of 2019.

It‚Äôs called playing survivor with WGLF

Low effort

Even with the map or a key ?

I'm not a big fan of Sprint Burst myself. Might change with Poised, but for now, I'd rather rely on Blanaced Landing or Lithe (even if, I know, Lithe isn't the best one)

WHY THE FUCK AM I FACE CAMPED FOR RUNNING A KILLER AROUND FOR 3 GENS?? I DONT TBAG OR BM IM LITERALLY JUST BETTER AT MIND GAMING! AT RANK 1 BTW! ALSO, FUCK YOU HAG 
---
üëå
---
I mean you can pop yourself out of chaotic evil into chaotic neutral by not running D-Strike.
---
yikes
---
They've confirmed that's not how they want the interaction to work and are planning to fix it in a future patch, probably by disabling seeing auras while you're in a locker, a sort of of "you can't see me and I can't see you" sort of deal. 
---
So I guess enjoy it while you can, probably doesn't have much longer to exist.
---
Your rank must be 14 because that doesn't work past a rank 6 killer.
---
&gt; how is that fair on the survivors when you guys already have more Buffs than we do
---
I'm guessing you're a new player?
---
Even with all the nerfs, survivors are absolutely the power role of the game still (in high level/experienced play). In any case this game is not about "fairness", this is supposed to be a *survival* horror game: If you go down, you go down and the killer can do whatever they want as long as it's not against the actual game rules no matter how shitty it may feel to you.
---
Camping is an awful "strategy" and will guarantee a loss for the killer as long as survivors are not dumb and know to do gens when someone's getting camped or have perks (or just good teamwork) to get you off that hook vs a camper.
---
You don't give much details like your rank (since you said "majority" i'd assume newer killers do pointless camping more often), does the killer know there's someone around the hook, are exit gates open etc etc... So many possible scenarios where a killer has no reason to leave the hook.
---
And ya know, some people are just assholes ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I highly suggest playing both sides so you'll understand 100% of the game instead of a biased view like many seem to have. Makes you a better survivor/killer too if you play the opposite role.
---
No that wouldnt work cause they dont own the Halloween movie so how make halloween killer?????2)2)$/)/!
---
Thanks  
---
~~I almost misspelled "Thanks" as "Thanos".~~
---
This has me thinking about the new locker stun perk mixed with dance with me????? How would that work out?
---
Maybe you burnt a bridge with him. He hates getting flamed
---
I don‚Äôt know... she seems a little too successful to be into Jeff since they said she is the ‚ÄúOprah‚Äù of the characters
---
tell that to the rank 1 legions i did it to, lack of scratch marks can be more than you think
---
Oh I hate running DS, I prefer good old Sprint Burst and Self Care
---
Yeah I didnt mind getting out if that game as fast as possible
---
It‚Äôs not bad sportsmanship- it‚Äôs bad strategy, but it‚Äôs well within the rules of the game, just like the nonsense killers complain about. 
---
As long as you‚Äôre within the rules of the game- BHVR‚Äôs rules, not your personal set- you‚Äôre a good sport. It might not be fun for your opponent, but most experiences where you lose aren‚Äôt.

thanks for thinking of us controller plebians! :D i don't have a mouse since i play on a laptop so it'll be nice to practise outside of the actual game.
---
And Enduring. 
---
I think we all did really
---
I noticed that my ability to hit great skill checks again improved when I changed my settings to have more fps.  Didn't know it went back down again.  The simulator is great, but doesn't simulate the delay associsted with different killers as host.  
---
Staying in the basement, switching from locker to locker repeatedly to avoid crows is definitely not moving the game in any direction. You're essentially stationary, no progress is being made towards meeting an end goal. Survival by itself is worthless if it's the equivalent to staying in lobby forever. You are intentionally prolonging it as much as possible, with no other intention than to annoy and as YOUR best bet, get the killer to disconnect, which is refusing to participate in normal play.
---
&gt;Holding the game hostage is when only one party has the ability to move the game state forward, but chooses not to. 
---
There is only one person ATTEMPTING to bring it to an end. The other player is actively avoiding any game mechanics in favour of prolonging the game as much as possible, which really moves under the juristiction of 'Holding the game hostage', more so than anything else
---
Nobody's going to care if you call them a dick, because they get that enough already with this kind of behaviour. Unless we treat it as something reportable, nobody's going to give a shit. And honestly, if you spend 20 minutes of a killer's time because you can't get a shitty free escape you may not even have participated in acquiring, then you deserve a ban
---
Can't the traps disappear from the map until the trapper gets new ones from lockers again? If they spawn from lockers there shouldn't be a limit to how many traps can spawn in- only a limit on how many can be present on the map at once.
---
You're a big guy

6pm for UK peeps

\~ gives Ruin and BBQ all tier buff \~
---
I use Manga Studio
---
Wow they buffed all killers perks and nerfed survivors perks again
---
I'm willing to help others, but not at the price of my own skin or if they sandbagged me. I wonder what alignment this makes me.
---
10 am PST
---
Oh yeah I hate sprint burst, but if my intention was to do mostly gens and avoid the killer, sprint burst is a good perk for that tactic
---
Even if they're just scratching their ass against various objects looking for ruin, that's still extra time you have to invest, which you could have used to apply pressure, and is now spent wasted instead.
---
On the other hand, the people that spend minutes looking for ruin and doing no gens aren't usually the ones where time is an important factor against. It's the ones that know that 'Hey, let me look for a generator and hold M1 on it' wins games
---
This is the most excited I've been for a new chapter in a long time. Can't wait to see how it plays out!
---
Goddammit, I had a feeling someone else thought about this before me! I even double checked to see if anyone  posted this already. 
---
yep this works well on smaller maps, add left behind who says you need a team to get gens done lol 
---
I played this one game as the wraith and 2 of the 4 dc after I down them both and I felt bad for the other 2 survivors and decided to let them do the 4 gens and escape. I don‚Äôt like it when people dc, although it is pretty funny seeing where the body‚Äôs end up.
---
Honestly whoever designed Legion needs to be fired ASAP
---
**No skins - Own title**.
---
T1 and T2 Ruin AND BBQ got buffed, oh boy that won't cause any controversy.
---
Noice, I get out of class at 12:30.

LMFAO that's your opinion sweetie.

HOW HAS NO ONE FIGURED THIS OUT ALREADY?!

As someone that played around 10 games and met nurses in 4 of them and billy in 3 of them yesterday, I have a very great distaste for nurse currently

WAIT HOLYSHIT‚Äî THEY AREN‚ÄôT ORIGINAL CHARACTERS????? HOLY FUCK I AM SHOOK

Really cool idea, thanks for making this

SHE TAKES SKILL ITS OK THAT SHE IGNORES ALL CHASE MECHANICS DONT WORRY

I‚ÄôVE GOT THE FUCKING FLU AND I CAN‚ÄôT  BE ARSED I WANNA PLAY DBD AND OTHER GAMES BUT EVERYTHING HURTS SO MUCH I‚ÄôM RESTRICTED TO MY FUCKING BED I‚ÄôVE GOT SHIT TO DO NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE ILL FOR FUCKS SAKE

You can counterplay a nurse(To some degree). Legion? He's just going to stick on you until you die. There is no counterplay, period. Once he latches on, either he finds a new survivor to prey on, or your days are numbered, and your moves are limited
---
Nurse is the one killer I can stand survivors complaining about.
---
I kind of skipped the first one because the launch was kind of um, bad.  Wish i would of stuck it out, as they turned the game around quite well.  I played the Division 2 beta, and I see what you mean by the hard learning.  I'll at least have another game to play when i get pissed off at DBD
---
Feels xbox man
---
I prefer third over second. 4 and 5 were garbage.
---
I do not understand why people keep saying that. You cannot juke a legion. When in frenzy he has built-in Unrelenting and save the best for last. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you juke, 360, or dead hard four hits. You‚Äôre going to get hit on the fifth. It‚Äôs literally impossible to avoid being hit by a legion in frenzy except in situations where the frenzy was initiated far enough away from you that he can‚Äôt catch you before it expires. But when the Legion is in Chase with you and initiate it from close range it‚Äôs just a matter of time. 
---
The fact that you‚Äôre acting like you can get consistent pallet stuns on legions in frenzy is pretty hilarious. Legion players respect the fuck out of pallets. As they should because why would they eat a stun when they can just respect and if you dropped a pallet vault over it in frenzy or if you don‚Äôt drop it frenzy and hit you. It‚Äôs like spirit or nurse. They just have no reason to ever walk into a pallets stun when their power gives them a way to deal with it whether you drop it or don‚Äôt. 
---
I can only conclude based on your statement that you either play at very low ranks or very bad players or both. Playing against even the least competent legion player is an exercise in futility. Eventually you will go down to matter what you do even if it takes a little bit. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not fun because your normal defenses as a survivor are stripped from you. You can drop pallets, vault windows etc. and it doesn‚Äôt matter. With Frank‚Äôs mixtape especially you literally get walked up on frenzy hit frenzy hit again and then all he has to do is wait for his power to come back and hit you one more time and you‚Äôre down. Literally zero counterplay. 
---
I would love to see montage footage of all these sick jukes you‚Äôre pulling on legions though. 
---
I cant wait to judge the killer based on other people opinions before they're even released. 
---
I was actually, thanks :) I forgot it made survivors scream too
---
As a Dwight main..... I will ascend 
---
I'm on console, but yay, all the DBD youtubers and streamers will be playing! I can live vicariously through them!
---
Those don't make you scream like Madness does
---
Lithe now works if you're not in a chase. Yes please.
---
Would be nice if they actually buffed some of the survivor perks, they gave buffs to killer perks.
---
Thanatophobia getting buffed while Legion doesn't get any nerfs/adjustments to fix the moonwalking issue. :\
---
Nice but hips don't look wide enough. Very cherry style though.

Yes, it is possible, but first I wanna get done the version for desktop first.
---
There's also the new plague perk that will 
---
RUN. *trigger music*
---
thanks &gt;w&lt;  
---
next time I will make sure to make her plumper x'D

"LOL I'M NOT EVEN MAD BUT HOW DID YOUR LUNGE GO FARTHER THAN MY SPRINT BURST LOL NOT MAD THO!?"  
---
Good times. 
---
what map
---
aside from failing skill checks when healing
---
there's the scream from iron maiden
---
Traps triggered from trapper and hag cause the survivor to scream
---
screams from across the map tend to be caused by doctor and the clown
---
Oh my, speak of the devil, eh? This is excellent news!
---
I see 3 lol
---
&gt; gives Ruin and BBQ all tier buff
---
Tier 3 are the same as before
---
Please don‚Äôt give the Devs the idea of making killers cost 30K shards
---
Ah, I see. Thanks for the heads up. I feel much better now :)
---
Hex: Ruin: All tiers affect all Survivors and apply a penalty of 3/4/5% regression on a good skill checks.
---
Barbecue and Chili: Auras are revealed from 40 meters for all tiers of the perk instead of 52/46/40 meters.
---
That's the joke Sherlock.
---
Potentially slowing the game down more with the new perk let‚Äôs super aggro builds come out with less punishment and end game builds have a bigger window to be relevant. I‚Äôm excited to see how this pans out.
---
sad thats more bound to happen than the cosmetics dropping in price... F to the gaming industry
---
Yeah was playing normal game got dsed catch him again then dc. but hat this one guy who laged a lot he dissaperad in front of my eyes so yeah endchat he is accusing me of lagswitching or admitting to it. 
---
The other suirvivors didn't lag it was just him
---
lol
---
Hey this guy is getting tunnl'd -&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
see nobody cares :stays on gen: 
---
Clearly!
---
Thanks, I really appreciate
---
&gt; Are you sure about the survivor main part 
---
Yes, I would bet my life on it.  
---
&gt;  because there are a shit ton more killer mains here 
---
I 100% disagree.  
---
I've read the last posts about the DS change, NOED, killers like Legion and I am honestly just baffled how survivor mains are sucking each others dicks off.
---
People say the DS change was needed --&gt; Getting downvoted.  
---
People saying NOED is OP --&gt; Getting upvoted.  
---
People saying Survivors need buffs and they have been "nerfed over the years into the ground" - while killers are the 'overpowered power role' (Which both is honestly fucking retareded) ==&gt; Instant upvotes.
---
People below are calling it bs ==&gt; Getting downvoted.  
---
Like I said. It baffles me.
---
If its 3 DCs throughout a game, then a hook is fine.
---
Hooking someone with 3 DCs in the first minute or so is just silly.
---
Empathy was nerfed WTF?
---
A buff. Action speed is increased even more than it already is.
---
All survivors are affected in every tier.
---
Funnily enough, it's now live on the PTB that this will no longer work. You're rendered blind and can't see auras while in lockers. Nor can your aura be seen.
---
Why do you think it's fun?
---
i know that station. didn‚Äôt realise they were on pornhub
---
They have also buffed Kindred to make it even better against campers. It will now show all survivor auras at all ranks and show the killers aura when within a larger radius of the hook.
---
It aint a surprise, thats how mafia works.
---
:) still great job. Do you use a drawing tablet or hand scan? 
---
Ooh ty! 
---
Idk man, they don't like giving survivors buffs.
---
Sorry for the outdated meme
---
Yeah no problem. When it first came out I thought it gave an aura of the survivor, but after testing I found out it is just a scream.
---
I don't like how skillchecks are so badly affected by FPS onn maps. I mean, of course they would be, but some maps I can easily skillcheck through a Hex Ruin, but Moung Ormond's skillchecks are basically a slideshow.
---
I'm about to blow everyone's minds
---
I'm a Dwight main who legit has never used a locker
---
&gt;tell you from personal experience that if I were to bring mori into a game and someone hit me with the current DS perk then I would purposely tunnel them off their first hook and mori them
---
So basically someone uses a good perk on you and you take it personally.
---
&gt;So updating won‚Äôt change whether you get mori‚Äôd or not
---
The fact that the mori is already powerful and causes an insane snowball effect and can now bypass decisive strike will change something. You need to hook someone to use a mori, current ds can be dribbled yes but dribbling takes time as well, and if the survivor lands it, they delay their death and reduce the amount of power a mori has by causing that effect to happen later in the match where it may be too late for it to snowball into "you and your team is screwed" so in a way, yes the new ds does make more slightly more powerful when compared to people running the old ds.
---
And your experience is not a show of what happens to everyone, you may not run into a lot, but there have been times I ran into 3 moris in a row
---
Also I'm more concerned about the ebony mori. The green mori is fine, as I can see it being necessary for some builds. But the pink mori is obnoxious
---
\*rolls eyes\* read.
---
Learn to read 
---
Thank god Spies in the Shadows got changed. No more endless bird notifications. Most annoying thing. 
---
Also wow, a BBQ + Chili and Ruin buffs. Didn't expect that one. I'm expecting survivor salt lol
---
It wasn't really nerfed. If anything it makes tier one actually useful now. I don't think many maps are longer than 128 meters. 
---
Knew people would confuse screaming with survivor injury noises. Just gonna delete this thread now. 
---
It'll either be a 1% buff total to 15% instead of 14%.
---
Or it'll be a 15% buff total to 29% at 5 gens instead of 14%.
---
wait.....
---
Thats Illegal
---
&gt; Making it easier for newbies to pip up and get slaughtered by people with 100x their play times seems so very counterproductive to encouraging growth.
---
It'll be harder to pip, re-read.
---
Riot Games said something wise on this subject some years back; something along the lines of "We have a champion who can be thought of as playing a piano keyboard with your QWER keys. Should we allow Sona to instantly win the game if the player is able to do something extremely difficult, like play Moonlight Sonata? Just because something is rare does not mean it is balanced. It just means that it is less frustrating."
---
See Brand New Parts, Moris, many, *many* addons, and a skilled Nurse.
---
Agreed- 45 seconds needing to be within terror radius is ridiculous. They could give it a fixed cooldown and it would be fine. 
---
Agreed 
---
Fair point. I thought it was minimum distance. 
---
If you mean the one with shades that looks like a twin of Pitbull then yeah it's an amazing skin
---
Wish spirit was a survivor
---
I just remember it's 7 or whatever people who disagree, just 7! Now if it was like -100 that's different, but screw am if you have a question
---
Meme builds are how I keep going after all these hours
---
Yesssss
---
A buff to ruin. That wasn‚Äôt expected
---

---
Lol so true man.  90% of the Myers toddlers I play these days run NOED.
---
I think it's the one ace skin I own and I'm proud to own it. I named myself Mr. WorldWide for awhile while playing him
---
DALE!
---
I had written that in the first sentence of the post 
---
Edit: never mind the patch notes form the PTB now say survivors in lockers get blindness, so no aura perks will work anymore. 
---
You dont need to be rude about it. I was answering.....
---
(Cries inside)
---
Last night as Nurse, I spawned in and noticed my Ruin totem looked awfully close to the furthest Gen from me. I immediately started to rush there, and it blew up right before I got there. Fucking totem spawned literallt right next to the gen, and was impossible to miss if you went to the gen.
---
Honestly, a lot of these totem placements are still hot garbage, even after the patch.
---
Some spots are amazing, but other times it might as well be a lighthouse for survivors.
---
The bottom of the mask could be broken for "realism." Or made to not be solid.
---
Thats the point of the legion power
---
Realism hasn't stopped them before.
---
I've only had that issue on my PS4 but since playing on Xbox One with friends everything is much smoother. 
---
I love it :)  
---
Maybe overcharge as well?
---
Congratulations
---
You get nothing.
---
Lord knows that the YouTubers are going to make several videos about it.
---
M c o t e c l a s s
---
I can't stand these Ranking changes. It's now going to be excruciatingly difficult for Killers to reach, and remain at, red ranks. This means that Survivor queues at those ranks are going to be loooooooooooong...
---
On top of that, red rank Killers can't double-pip if a Survivor gets out via the hatch (for which there's no reliable counter). It's the bloody Victory Cube all over again!
---
Reposted, stop bullying low ranks.
---
Same as you with legion, and it also happens to me with the huntress.
---
If you know very well the killer against you're running, because you play it, well... you know what really fucks him/her off.
---
Ok good to know thought you were serious
---
It‚Äôs fine as is, just do totems. NOED is one of the few perks that can be nullified before it even activates. 
---
Just because DS got nerfed doesn‚Äôt mean NOED should be nerfed 
---
Haha yeah I'd be extra careful in this minefield of a comment section
---
Eh, I have tier 1 or 2 on some killers I only play here and there because I didnt want to burn through bloodwebs on them. I am super happy with this. Kind of like when they changed NOED like this. Love it
---
Yea, you can only opt in when it goes live
---
More like progression change, makes more sense this way
---
ALAS!!!
---
Give this man a beer.
---
&gt;ntu
---
But what if the legion is using the new perk Dark Devotion, then goes after someone else after he hits the obsession? (guess that would be the point of legion anyways)
---
I hope they do, because I don't like going through 100+ bloodwebs just to finally get a single Tier 1 perk.
---
Since they're both teachables, this won't negatively affect low ranks. Meanwhile, it reduces the perk grind somewhat.
---
I'm okay with this.
---
Pretty sure its saying a tiers have the distance value of bbq tier 3 and the bp bonus is still 15/20/25 percent, so yes it is a small buff
---
DS is not a good perk, it‚Äôs a crutch perk that everyone can use and is unlike any other perk because there‚Äôs hardly a counter to it. Saying just use enduring is incredibly ridiculous because why must I waste 25% of my perk slots just to counter a single survivor perk, that hardly even counters it anyway. And i agree that ebony mori is obnoxious, I think using mori in general is unfair and can ruin a game, though it is still a cool game mechanic but I never use it because it ruins matches. So your thought is that you just never get hooked at all because you DS and escape every time, I actually find that even when somebody does DS me or somebody on my team uses DS then they end up getting caught anyway. You‚Äôre gonna get hooked sometime or another during most games so it‚Äôs ridiculous for you to think otherwise. Even if killer is not using mori, your argument that you get an escape after getting downed instead of getting hooked after getting downed (losing a chase) proves how ridiculous of a perk DS is and it needed a change 
---
You're right, I had it in my head the only way to double pip currently was to get a full 16 points and thought they were making it slightly easier to skyrocket through the ranks. 
---
IIRC they were talking about scrapping tiers, so maybe these changes are just a step in that direction.
---
Excellent training to take on all those Hex: Ruin out there.
---
The amount of times I had to run into line of sight to get my lithe to proc, love this change. 
---
What's rude ignoring the text of a post in which you're trying to help. I'm being rude because you were being lazy, simply read the title and thought you could help out. 
---
&gt;  So why spike the difficulty up so much if there isn‚Äôt even any reason to try?
---
Because people have been asking for more meaningful ranking regardless of whether or not you get anything from it for fucking ever now?
---
she sucks!! Worse than Legion. Save your money.. 
---
/s
---
They‚Äôre giving legion mains a bad name :(
---
Specifically, this is the Cypress mori. There's also Ivory (green) and Ebony (pink) moris. This mori allows you to kill the final survivor in the game without the hook. The Ivory Mori allows you to kill one downed survivor at any time, and Ebony allows you to do it to every survivor. A survivor must be hooked at least once for you to be able to Mori them.
---
Granted. Diversion is now an Exhaustion perk. That's still the same as a cooldown, right?
---
Head On simply allows Dwight to utilize the true power of the locker. 
---
How does that affect gameplay? Who cares for rank in this game?
---
Also why would you want to pip in this game? You get slower queues and less enjoyable games.
---
But couldn't  they make it impossible? Like what's the area that the stun takes place
---
It is more of a buff to the lower tiers.
---
Sorry to hear that mate as a killer main that ain't honorable with so many d/c 
---
generators always worked like that tho, they just gave us a visual cue to tell us whats happening
---
While I welcome the change to emblems for killers as a killer main I'm not understanding why survivor emblems weren't changed as well
---
What?? Why?
---
That‚Äôs a nice change 
---
You‚Äôre welcome. 
---
Not sure if you have to censor other people's screen names, unless it involves them being salty / toxic, which could lead to harassment. But maybe I'm wrong.
---
I really hope the new killer doesn't trigger my sympathy puking or I'll be dying quickly
---
Because I use Q&amp;Q to fast vault more often. This Lithe change stops me from being able to do that without wasting my Lithe.
---
Damn that looks to good to betrue
---
I did read and i was clafying it was both. Being a dick to people trying to help isnt cool. Grow up. Its also hard to read when you deleted it. 
---
Welcome Activatable Sprint Burst
---
1/3 still isn‚Äôt the best odds.
---
Well done!  
---
I know exactly how that killer feels. 
---
Wtf happened to Dwight? He looks so old in this.
---
But killers already have a lot of good perks, and to make matters worse they didn't even buff the less used ones (save the best for last, beast of prey, teritorial imperative, surveilance, monstrous shrine is GARBAGE, etc.) only buffed those that were already pretty popular (ruin, bbq, devour hope).
---
The reason you see various builds is because people are just bored of running the same things (Adrenaline, dead hard, balanced landing, borrowed time, unbreakable, deliverance). There are so few perks that aren't meme quality it's just sad to see them not get buffed at all.
---
Yeah it's called the kobe squad strategy. Everyone uses Up the Ante, Slippery Meat, and luck offerings that benefit all 4 survivors. It's been around for a long while now, there are probably videos of it online.
---
Hmmm interesting.  But if you‚Äôre not in a chase why fast vault anyway? Just move around it
---
Skill checks sound so cool sped up
---
Emblems change is for both sides.
---
Because seeing this happening was too funny I couldn‚Äôt even think straight. We were all dying in Discord. 
---
I never really found ear-rape memes to be funny so I don‚Äôt find this particularly amusing either. Loud, staticky sounds =/= humor. 
---
Just slow vault when you are not in a chase. Doesn't seem too difficult to do. 
---
Saves time.
---
Yes
---
They have to make money so they make it that expensive so you would pay for it with real money.
---
Pretty sure you just have to hold shift 
---
I've had maybe 1 of every 20 matches not have NOED after the tier buff. A significant portion of the community doesn't have everything, we're not all hardcore gamers with that kind of time. 
---
It's not a buff at tier 3, but ruin will be even more prevalent now, as before tier 1 &amp; 2 weren't worth running. Especially against newer survivors, where ruin isn't needed. It honestly seems like the devs don't play their own game. Killer is already very strong above rank 10 or so, adding additional buffs that only power up weaker killers isn't going to help anything. 
---
Empathy and wake up nerfs are a weird decision.... I mean both wernt used all that much.
---
I really like this, played with it a little bit and it certainly is what it described to be. I'm sure you have a lot on your plate, but if your taking suggestions, maybe have more "events." Similar to 'The killer is near you' and the 'Hex: Ruin found', one such example for a new one could be 'Another survivor comes to help repair' and the generator gets repaired faster as a result.
---
I mean, the change would only make it so the Pig can't soft tunnel you while preventing you from taking off the trap off your head. 
---
They changed "unlimited" to "128m" at Tier 3. Considering the fact no maps are longer than that, I bet it has always been 128 and they just decided to make that clear since "unlimited" doesn't really *fit in* with any other perk descriptions.
---
sorry should have formatted this better I was responding to the first half of your comment
---
I bet anyone that does this is the first to cry about hook campersüòÇ
---
Slow it down just a little bit 
---
I wish the maps would be a bit more different. I'm kinda sick of all these same looking woods with a 2-3 different new structures in it.
---
Loved the Halloween and Nightmare maps because they were so completely different. And the Asylum and Saw map of course.
---
I would agree with you in regards to competitive style games with proper ranked modes and ongoing tournaments. The ranks in this really only account for time played (less so for killers, but majorly for survivors). As for tournaments i only remember the one attempt which was a gong show best forgotten. This is really just a casual game and should be balanced around that. If they want to try again at getting a competitive scene they should do so after they at least get their servers up and fix their matchmaking.
---
I'm on EU. I get fairly mixed results, between really good and absolutely horrendous survivors in purple ranks as a survivor myself
---
Same as a killer. Some games they are potato, other games they just ram through generators like they were paid to do it
---
Some highlights in my mind:
---
* Chaser Scoring: The proximity penalty has been increased. The longer a Killer stays within a close proximity (16m) to a hooked Survivor, the more points they will lose in the Chaser emblem.
---
&gt;Oh so now we're actually punishing camping. Nice.
---
* Barbecue and Chili: Auras are revealed from 40 meters for all tiers of the perk instead of 52/46/40 meters.
---
* Hex: Ruin: All tiers affect all Survivors and apply a penalty of 3/4/5% regression on a good skill checks.
---
&gt;https://giphy.com/gifs/editingandlayout-the-office-thank-you-michael-scott-5xtDarmwsuR9sDRObyU
---
* Hex: Devour Hope: The perk grants 3/4/5% speed boost with 2 tokens, Exposed status applied at 3 tokens, and Kills are available at 5 tokens.
---
&gt;So does this mean it'll always come with an instadown? Also is the speed boost constant, or only after the hook (like it is currently)?
---
* Thanatophobia: Tier values are incremented at a rate of 4/5/6% up to a maximum of 16/20/24%
---
&gt;üëÄ Actually not shit. Remember that Dying Light 3 causes a 25% game slow down. üëè Legion üëè Thana üëè Meta üëè Boiz üëè Time üëè to üëè DC üëè
---
* Pipping Thresholds: We have made some changes to the Emblem system that will affect the difficulty in which players rank up and subsequently maintain their rank.
---
&gt;It's about fucking time to make Rank matter.
---
* Lithe: Removed the chase condition. Lithe now only triggers on rushed vaults.
---
&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9iYm9PEAHg I have literally asked for this for [YEARS!](/intensifies)
---
* Kindred: All Survivor's auras are shown at all tiers. If the Killer is within a 8/12/16 meter range of the hooked Survivor, the Killer's aura is revealed to all other Survivors.
---
&gt;So Kindred level 1 isn't worthless anymore.
---
The survivors I play with are nice too! They called me a camper because I attacked someone who unhooked a survivor 3 seconds after I hooked them, they are so nice.
---
I was expecting a Rick roll, but that was kinda cool.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but I was either editing my comment in the middle of you writing yours, or else I didn‚Äôt see your comment pop up before I decided to edit my comment.  In either case, the line you brought up was removed, and replaced with one that I think better articulates my concern.  That this rank change will actively hurt matchmaking and make rank even less meaningful than it currently is, because it will just clump everyone between ranks 7 and 4 regardless of their actual skill level which will lead to more imbalanced matches.  There is an argument to be made that the current pipping system leads to everyone clumping up into rank 3-1, but to be a shitty player in such ranks you at least need to have played a lot so that statistics could carry you up that high, meaning that most of the players in higher ranks at least had a fundamental understanding of the game‚Äôs mechanics and basic strategies, even if they sucked at everything else.  This is not at all guaranteed by clumping everyone into the upper middle ranks, where there will be a far greater range of skill levels.
---
Time to become a Killer main. SWF is still at greatest advantage, but looks like solo queue is about to become painful (more so than it already was.) 
---
we are all looking forward to see how you do on that class next year!
---
*teabags a killer who doesn‚Äòt camp or tunnel at the exit gate* 
---
NOED activated
---
*gets hooked and cries* 
---
It‚Äôs really bad, SWF‚Äôing is basically lobby simulator. I guess there‚Äôs just way more survivors than killers
---
Procrastination is the best thing in the world ;)
---
Hayato
---
Can you send a fresh invite, this one is expired for me
---
I think 3 is still a gem, 4 is kinda okay, and 5 is a disgrace.
---
Lol, I like you
---
Nurse can be juked and when she misses a strike there's a good cold down giving the survivors enough time to escape. Also there's no "mending" but hey what do I know. I'm a survivor main who's out of his fucking mind. 
---
That‚Äôs a good point, would the killer still see a red gen from a distance?
---
I always thought the only annoying part of the new Spies wasn't how often it activated, but the loud ass BANG noises every time it did. The only change i wanted from BHVR for Spies was to change the audio queue from bang to a crows cawing sound so that it would be less annoying, and easier to differentiate from failed skill checks, pallet slams, and vaults.
---
Ah its meg she definitely gonna die
---
Thank you
---
That's another meme strat to add to the pile of when I want to dick around.
---
* Hags
---
* Legions
---
Hag and Legion are cancer with Franklin's because they can get the first hit on you so easily.
---
Vomit, vomit everywhere!
---
i only get annoyed when the killer is camping and tunneling on 3 person games.
---
This
---
You don't even need to get to the endgame. Play your midgame fine and you'll be just fine. 
---
Less toxic universe?
---
*Eric Andre gate meme*
---
What does that mean?
---
I doubt it was intended as a nerf, i figure "unlimited range" was causing issues.
---
thano on Freddy is gonna be sick
---
Wouldn't really fit her thematically imo.
---
I agree but with how buggy the chase mechanic is I welcome it. Lithe just straight up wasn't activating most of the time. Of course, I'd be happier if they fixed the issue with chases so Lithe worked as intended in the first place.
---
Wait a minute, in the recent Halloween movie a closet was opened and Michael Myers popped out attacking the person. Is head on dwight actually Michael Myers?
---
Lmfao yeah, I‚Äôve only had 3 dcs over all on legion? I‚Äôve had more as doctor ffs.
---
Notice he said he uses quick and quiet
---
Super good for practice, would be something I recommend to new players before hopping in if they're not sure how skillchecks work or want to learn without getting into game first. 
---
I main Jake and use the username Peasant. I will deliberately spend the whole trial plagued just for the dank medieval memes. I love this new killer!
---
It's hard to do that with Freddy. 
---
She's actually in every horror franchise you just don't see her in the real grass. 
---
Fire up buff is godly. Also, Ardetha asked McLean about fire up and he said that when the exit gates are powered you get 7 tokens instead of 5. 
---
Id like to now too. Apparently im a homophobic because i dont ship Trapper and friggin Michael Myers
---
Lithe + DANCE WITH ME + Quick and quiet + Urban Evasion =  SMELLYALATER 
---
I love this!!!! Have you done other survivors or killers in this same style? She‚Äôs so cute!
---
The healing thing for sure isn't movement based. I'll be in swf and they're not even touching their controller and its happening.
---
Having some in game files to help you would make this seem less far fetched 
---
Old Than 3 was +14 seconds to a gen IIRC. The new Than 3 makes a gen 99.2 seconds, so that's a 5~ second buff. All this assuming it's 1 person working on a gen with 4 people are injured.
---
I REALLY WANT KILLER EMOTES, I CAN'T EXPRESS MYSELF WITH THWACKS ALONE. I HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF FEELINGS BHVR, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO FISTBUMP DAVID WHEN I ESCORT HIM TO GENNYS AND GIVE NEA THE MIDDLE FINGER WHEN SHE TEABAGS ME AT THE EXIT GATE.
---
AND NOT JUST BY KILLING HER WITH A SURPRISING TOMBSTONE.
---
No one is going to use because you can just use discord... and who plays solo at high ranks? The majority of my matches are against SWF.
---
I HATE HOW PEOPLE PLAY ANY OTHER KILLER APART FROM FREDDY, FREDDY SHOULD FUCKING BE PLAYED MORE, HE IS LITERALLY THE BEST FUCKING KILLER IN THE ENTIRE GAME, HE IS SO GOOD WHEN CAMPING, HE COMBOS SO FUCKING WELL WITH OVERCHARGE, ITS JUST A BIT BETTER THAN BAMBOOZLED NURSE AND A LOT BETTER THAN INSIDIOUS FACE CAMPING HAG, OVERALL EVERYONE PLAY FREDDY. NEW FREDDY META
---
Her ass propably blocks the Gens aura from the Killer.
---
Apparently I need to use a VPN to get better teammates.
---
reveals position, ultimately serves the same porpuse , at the end of the day both reveal nearby players location

Wife is a CNA, we recently had a baby boy-&gt; wife is pissed she hasn't lost 20 lbs in 4 months even though she works 16 hour shifts can confirm pregnancy messes people up

---
Wrong sub
---
why the hell they nerfed empathy??
---
bhvr devs you are so worthless
---
They keep trying to balance perk's tiers which is good. The same perk at rank 3 shouldn't be tremendously better than the perk at level 1, also helps with the bloodpoint grind since more perks are usable at rank 1 and 2!
---
how long is the map?anybody knows?
---
is empathy nerfed?
---
OK. I get the bottom bit, but I don't get the title, who's, we. What don't we get surrounding bbq. Pls help
---
They put Decisive Strike in the shrine before, so it would be more than fair. I want the BBQ
---
Claudette isn't even that good, IMHO. I just had to use her for a daily. I actually hate using her. 
---
They stated they have done something balance wise with legion internally. Weird that it's still not ready to push to the live or PTB servers. Same with Freddy rework which we have to wait for even longer now.
---
I liked it.
---
The system will require both sides to be more interactive at high ranks. You won't be able to pip if you don't make saves or can't make saves. Killers will depip alot easier at high ranks. The skill level is going to shift at red ranks. Getting the 4k won't result in a double pip. 
---
Nurse actually takes skill to use though
---
In what way?
---
Is anyone else sad about the spies nerf? No more bird paths leading directly to survivors :( 
---
Bhvr be like: *nerf noises*
---
TBH only thanatophobia got a buff and spies actually got a nerf. The other perks just got more usable at rank 1 and 2 but tier 3 (the actual perk) stays the same.
---
I also wish more perks would get a rework/substantial buff, on survivors and killers side (looking at you Monstrous Shrine).
---
Same
---
Took some time, but we can now call this game balanced. thank god this op perk got cocked harder than a whore in the evening
---
Ardetha is now on suicide watch.
---
*Laughs in Megalovania*
---
You should learn to read. It literally states that tier 3 stays the same as it has always been on all of those perks except for thanaotophobia.
---
THE LINK DOESN'T FUCKING WORK
---
im not good at being funny i was trying my hardest bc i thought this was hilarious üòÇ
---
I (personally) would love if diversion was changed to an exhaustion perk. We definitely need more diversity other than just speed perks and I'd love to have a stealthy exhaustion perk. Then it'd actually see some use because you can use it to actually divert the killer away from you trying to hide rather than having to wait so long within a killer's terror radius before you can use it. Having it tied to terror radius also makes it difficult to use against killers with m&amp;a, or no terror radius.
---
Really ?
---
I slightly disagree, it‚Äôs good to run on any killer with good map presence. However, you‚Äôre right about other perks being way more valuable if we‚Äôre talking about a killer that doesn‚Äôt have strong mobility - Clown, for example
---
Oh. Well in that case, sorry for killing the buzz
---
Srry for the bad quality
---
And by the time I saw the lights of the generators they were nothing to me but BLINDING
---
So the totem changes they talked about were related to just the hex perks? I can't find anything else for that 
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted, because your complaint is valid.
---
If people aren't fast vaulting their windows, they're being immersed. If you aren't going to do all actions as fast as possible, then you aren't being optimal at genrushing.
---
PTB IS OUT IN HALF AN HOUR
---
Right now Thanatophobia on legion applies an almost constant debuff comparable to anctive Dying Light.
---
This is going to be nightmareish. :/
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
You don't even need to be a professional player to stomp on people with nurse, just pump like 50 to 100 hours into her and there is nothing survivors can do to escape you. Games should still be balanced around higher skilled gameplay regardless of it having a competitive scene or not. I don't need the game to be perfectly balanced or anything, thats already impossible with all the items and addons, not to mention the horror that balancing an asymmetrical game is, but perks and killers should not become overpowered at higher skill play, and Nurse is just that, operpowered at higher skilled play.
---
Maybe it's just me but I'm glad pet now works on the clown. Was always one of my favorite perks (pro tip if you grab the obsession off a pallet or window vault you don't lose a stack, you actually gain one) and was sad that tossing bottles removed stacks despite not doing damage. I thought it was intentional though. 
---
Until all 5 gens are done, the perk is a few % worse than before. If all gens are done, then it's 1% better than before.  
---
Thanks BHVR, very cool!
---
She makes me want to vomit! So disgusting!
---
At level 1. At level 3 it's still the same I'm pretty sure.
---
Which one of these is the current one?
---
This is also a good opportunity for survivors new to Ruin to learn how to power through it, or find the Hex
---
Nope, 12PM :)
---
Haha you're not wrong, it can be a little crazy when people scatter. Once I had all four people run in different directions and they must of hit every bird on the map. 
---
That fact is false. I play Trapper often, and I have no need for NOED because the survivors never get that far,
---
Good. If the killer is waiting at the top, other survivors are repairing gens. Let him wait. 
---
You use noed don't you
---
Oh man this is great, I always accidentally swap before the match starts.
---
Oh. Nice! I get home from school at 1:30
---
Not pointless at all! You can practice going for excellent skillchecks without having to worry about screwing your team over by missing too much. It's a training tool!
---
Professionals have standards 
---
They said that survivors can get rid off the dying light debuff when the obsession changes with DS so that's definitely a nerf to an already bad and really situational perk.
---
What a bold statement
---
Looks great!
---
Me too. Literally every time I set my controller down. One time I made it halfway through a match and realized I was Adam instead of Kate. 
---
Thank you.
---
Can't tell you how many times I've started a match only to realize I'm Trapper somehow
---
This makes believe they'll add a new status effect where your aura reading range reduced
---
So you‚Äôre a Legion main? üòâ
---
Ace looks cool
---
What do the ‚Äúpoints‚Äù mean in the popping changes? What is 0-8 points, etc? Lol I‚Äôm confused 
---
I love it! Really looks neat.
---
I WISH THEY'D FREAKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT GEN RUSHING, BUT INSTEAD THEY NERFED RUIN AND ARE NOW PUNISHING KILLERS FOR EVEN STAYING AROUND SOMEONE THEY HOOKED. RUIN IS JUST A BANDAID ON A BROKEN BONE AND THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS I SWEAR
---
Can you draw "real" versions? Idk how to word it lol
---
I think he meant these old [livestream summaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/search?q=flair%3ADev%2BStream%2BSummaries&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=deadbydaylight&amp;utm_content=t5_3cb2g)

They used to be pinned every time they happened I think. It's been a while.
---
*SNAP SNAP GET CAUGHT IN MY TRAP, NOW LET ME JUST WALK OVER THERE AND.....* ***OH FUCKING HELL HOWD YOU GET OUT IN ONE TRY?***
---
hahah yeah, last night I was using my Meg and it swapped to my very under leveled Claudette and I only managed to survive because well... Claudette.
---
Still a 150% chance
---
&gt; now Legion players will find a group of survivors, stab them all, and just tunnel the last one but while also slowing the game down more
---
Thank you devs, very cool!
---
I'D USE HIM BUT DLC
---
Ah ok! I hope you‚Äôre right because it would actually be worth taking now.
---
Ace and Dwight main. I do it for the epussy
---
I WISH I DID. EXCEPT I WENT DOWN AND GOT MORIED, WOOHOO
---
I mostly play jake because I can sympathise / identify myself with his lore  &amp; perks to a certain extent. I feel as if he represents some aspects of my character the best, that's it really. 
---
Imagine running pebble against scratched mirror M&amp;A Myers.... lel
---
Whenever I use it, ruin gets broken in 3 actual seconds or less. Is this an easter egg to the joke that Hexes always get broken instantly?
---
WHENEVER I PLAY TRAPPER, EVERYONE GETS OUT QUICKLY AND I CANT DO SHIT
---
That picture is haunting
---
That made me sick urgh
---
Can someone explain the points thing about earning a pip?? What points???  Lol 
---
All platforms take longer to find games at Rank 20-15 (I'm presuming you're still there since you just got the game on PC)
---
I probably read it wrong looking at it again and it probably is a nerf or minor upgrade, but I hope it becomes decent at least.
---
HAVE 3 MEN GAMES FOR LIKE 3 MATCHES STRAIGHT AND ITS ALWAYS CAMPING NURSE OR BILLY WHO HAD TO CAMP AND TUNNEL THE INJURED SURVIVOR TO END THE GAME.
---
YOU KNOW WHAT, I‚ÄôLL GIVE YOU THAT. HAVEN‚ÄôT BEEN PLAYING TRAPPER LATELY BUT IF I DO AND THIS HAPPENS, I‚ÄôLL REMEMBER THIS
---
Lithe, Kindred, Wake Up all got some very good additions and buffs. Also this new DS is much more powerful with other perks for synergy. 
---
Alt+tab and enjoy the internet 
---
I main Nea. I just dig her look. People just pick who they most relate to, look up to, or like. I'm gonna start maining Jane because I like her character. I'm like this with killers too. I most relate to legion and they are my favorite. But I'm playing nurse until Legion gets a balance patch because Nurse is a dope killer as well.
---
But what about basement  Trapper?
---
I didn't even notice that. 16/20/24% instead of 4/5/6%. Wtf.
---
Someone can probably do the math if they want to mess with all the multiplicative bonus/debuff stacking and what not.
---
* Self-care : 50% penalty
---
* Jump Rope / Swing chains: These provide an extra 20%/25% penalty bonus to the base dream world effect, which totals out to 60%/62.5% total penalty. However I don't know how they'd interact if you stack them.
---
* Dying Light: 25% penalty
---
* 3 stacks of the new Thana (since the 4th player is dead) 18%
---
* Sloppy Butcher: 20%
---
* Coulrophobia: 50%
---
So yea, butt load of debuffs but I'm pretty sure  BHVR once mentioned they fudge the numbers so you never end up with something like 99% reduction in action speed
---
good news if you havent seen yet but the ptb is set to come out today at 1PM EST
---
On PS4 there is a much larger ratio of Survivors because playing Killer is harder due to the low framerates. Therefore Killers find a match instantly while Survivors take ages. PC is the complete reverse, there is a much higher ratio of Killers which make it take ages for them to fill a match.
---
It would be cool if they could enable PC Killer/Console Survivor crossplay to alleviate the wait times.
---
Kindred can reveal the killer at unlimited range and it still won't stop claud from hiding in a bush and Davis from farming you in front of them. It's not the perk that was issue just how selfish teammates are.
---
No, new DS is not more powerful at all, I don't know why you think it is. 
---
It has a shorter stun that still gets affected by enduring, it can be waited out either by running the killer for a long time (punishing you for doing well as survivor) or by slugging. It only works for 60 seconds after getting unhooked, making it purely an anti-tunneling perk, as opposed to old DS. 
---
DS didn't even need the rework in my opinion. All it needed was an indicator for non-obsession DS.
---
I agree that the Lithe change is good, at least it fixes some bugs related to it.
---
Kindred isn't that good of a perk honestly, it's only useful when playing solo and even then in my experiences people still ignore the auras and don't work with each other. While the buff is nice it's not gonna impact anything.
---
Wake up change doesn't buff the perk, only makes it easier for people who are still leveling their characters. 
---
The pipping adjustments still feel pointless, at higher ranks it should be win or lose and not lose a little, didn't win or lose, won a little, or won a lot. Make green, purple, and red ranks -2 -1 +1 +2, a safety pip has no business being in a (would be) competitive ranking system, either you win or you lose, make red ranks mean something.
---
WHERE ARE THE FUCKING PUNISHMENTS FOR KILLERS WHO WAIT FOR A FULL LOBBY AND THEN D/C?  
---
Thanat just became easy a tier, wow 
---
Download finished boys, 300mbit was worth it's money
---
No it's always been [4%/5%/6%](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Thanatophobia) but the max used to be 15% at T3 with 4 survivors injured. It's not max 24% at T3 with 4 survivors injured. Basically it used to increase across tiers at 3%, it now increases across tiers at 6% per injured survivor.
---
WHY THE FUCK DID ZOU WASTE 45 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE JUST TO SPITE A STRANGER? DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORTH IT!
---
If diversion was an exhaustion perk then I would have to stop using it.
---
Can someone please explain to me how the PTB works?
---
Like, you can play with the new killer/survivor/perks without having to pay for the dlc?
---
Do you need to spend BP on the killer/survivor to get the perks?
---
What happens if I play on the PTB but then don't buy the dlc?
---
Yes the perk is still ass, but the change isn't negative.
---
That nerf to spies though.
---
When it was finally good. -.-
---
Wow using 2 insta down perks, you are something special
---
r/notinteresting
---
r/hedidthemath
---
Oh, you mean Adam Francis and Detective Tapp as well? Cause I can do the same shit with them as I did with Claudette along with any other survivor. Dude, don't be an asshole. It's not neccessary. 
---
Its on live already? 
---
It dosnt show the option for me at the moment.
---
Well it prevents potential alerts from different survivors so I consider it a nerf in some way.
---
Let's go! I can't wait to see what happens?
---
If there are few crows then it's not like they are gonna run into another crow after the last one. 
---
On Lery's this change helps as it has A LOT of crows.
---
what do the numbers mean 
---
For killers, this just means that you have to intentionally play sub-optimally to pip up in red ranks.  Slaughtering everyone in 5 minutes with 1 gen done and all chases ended in 30 seconds will net you nothing, and may even hurt you, so allowing yourself to lose survivors, allowing gens to pop at a steady pace to drag out the game, going out of your way not to punish unhooks so that survivors aren‚Äôt hesitant to go in for the save and offer you more chase/hitting potential, etc.  A system used to determine skill that requires you to play less skillfully to get the most out of it seems like a poor system.
---
I‚Äôd argue it even encourages poor play from the survivors, since they can‚Äôt afford to take even one measly down if they want a double pip, so they‚Äôll act excessively cautious and will refuse to take any serious risks, preferring to let their comrades take all the heat and then just swooping in at the last second for easy healing and co-op score like vultures, leading to less activity rather than more.  Also, more disconnects from salty shits who get downed first.
---
Obviously this is all just speculation.  If the new system works, I‚Äôll be happy to be proven wrong.  I‚Äôm just saying that I‚Äôm currently very skeptical and apprehensive.
---
Console pleebs: ok 
---
Their clothing isn't as dark as Claudettes.  She's the hardest to spot.  Just saying raise the bar bro.  What you did is stupid easy this isn't a post.

---
currently posting on reddit HAHA
---
I highly highly doubt you consistently 4k with every killer in the game. You guys are absolutely missing the point.
---
Well sometimes you get an alert in front of you and another one somewhere else and if that happens now within 5 seconds you can't see the second alert.
---
That's not how probability works.
---
Is anyone streaming PTB right now?
---
Finally, some good fucking update.
---
lmao
---
Wow that BBQ buff is really nice. So many of my killers have few teachables unlocked and I'll usually even run BBQ rank 1 just for the blood points
---
*cries in console*
---
It takes your progress from the game and transports it to a different "server" with the new content. You get to try everything out for free. If you spend and BP/IS/AC it wont take them from your main account. Any progress you achieve during your time on PTB WON¬¥T be transferred back. Its just for you to try stuff out, you¬¥re not required to buy anything before, during, or after.  
---
Bastet will be streaming soon. He is Portuguese but he speaks English if you ask him things : )
---
Everyone's probably still downloading it 
---
FUCK ALL THE PEOPLE WHO THING TRIGGERING HAG TRAPS AND UNHOOKING WITHOUT BT IS A GOOD IDEA; FUCK THE PEOPLE WHO THINK TUNNELING OR FACECAMPING IS A VALID STRAT RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO (THATS WHY YOU ONLY GOT A 1K YOU LAZY BUTT)  OR WHO THINK THEY'RE ENTITLED TO ANYTHING. SURVIVORS ARE ENTITLED LITTLE SHITS BUT SO ARE KILLERS; IF I DOWN YOU EVEN AFTER YOU HIT DSTRIKE YOU FUCKED UP. IF I ESCAPE YOU WITHOUT DSTRIKE AND DO TWO GENS BY MYSELF AND FIND THE HATCH BEFORE YOU YOU BETTER FUCKING BET I'LL ESCAPE. YOU DON'T DESERVE A 4K BECAUSE MY TEAM WAS DOGSHIT. AND FOR THE SAKE OF FUCK, FUCK THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY ARE ENTITLED TO ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT CRUTCHES. BOTH SIDES HAVE THEM AND IF I WIN I WIN, FUCKWIT.
---
I FEEL SURVIVORS NEED TO EARN A BIT MORE BLOODPOINTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT FEELS DUMB TO BE PUNISHED IN POINTS FOR DOING A GEN AND LETTING ANOTHER SURVIVOR UNHOOK. ALSO WE NEED A 2X BLOODPOINT WEEKEND AT LEAST EVERY MONTH GODDAMIT.
---
I think they realize they just goofed up Legion's design at a fundamental level and need to rework it entirely. Legion is nearly unanimously despised by the community. 
---
Why would you waste an hour? Just dc.

This is a bit of a stretch

---
&gt; The intensity of the Terror Radius is now scaled based on the vertical distance (in addition to the horizontal distance).
---
*Cries in Jigsaw Doctor*
---
Ooooohhh yeah, misunderstood that, thx
---
Juggling isn't a solid counter as it needs to be done up to 3 times on the obsession and would be extremely hard to predict on a non-obsession. Juggling can also be countered by a Survivor body blocking.
---
Enduring only softens the blow. You've still been hit with DS and, with how most maps are, they are still likely to get to a safe place just like if you didn't have Enduring.
---
Nice try though.
---
I don't think so. You just have a different opinion. When I play survivor, I play with the full intention of finishing generators as fast as possible. No time for slow vaults.
---
FOR FUCKS SAKE, THANK YOU
---
Ardetha is about to flip his shit
---
Good one, but do you have scientific proof?
---
You could have gotten like 300k BP in 1 hour of gameplay vs 1 daily. I never understand these posts. Why waste that much of your time when you can DC and just do something more productive. This is a complaint about the people, but it was only your ego that kept you there.
---
Downloading PTB here 
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I like playing Jeff cuz he has almost no negative stereotypes, he's fun and goofy, and I don't really care for playing immersed lol
---
Holy shit, this is actually fantastic!
---
I highly suggest you post this on the oFFicial DbD forums as it is more likely to get Dev attention there.
---
I don't have the game on steam,can I still test on ptb?
---
WHY DID YOU BRING A TOOLBOX IF YOU ARE JUST GONNA HIDE IN LOCKERS!!!!
---
Well what perks do you use on him?
---
&gt;Devout Scoring: The scoring thresholds have been modified. 3 kills now also result in a Silver emblem, whereas 4 kills results in Gold. To earn an Iridescent Devout emblem, you need to perform 10 or more hook events and sacrifice all 4 Survivors.
---
Can someone explain the devout scoring nerf to me?
---
Why the hell should I get punished for either: a) getting an earned, b) the survivors making stupid plays and handing me a 4k, c) survivors that suicide on hook, or d) a survivor quits.
---
Even if I hook every survivor twice and get a 4k I won't get an iridescent devout emblem? And if just a single survivor chooses the quick way out and dies on the hook that means that I have to manage to down each other survivor and hook them 3 times to get the 10 hooks for devout. And if any survivors dc then you probably won't be getting devout at all.
---
I get the idea behind the change but 10 hooks is way too much and puts too much of the killer's pip in the hands of survivors either quitting or giving up. I think 8 would at least be reasonable so you only have to hook each survivor twice, and would at least be obtainable if a survivor quits before you can hook them.
---
Gen tapping is terrible lol, you're basically giving them Ruin for free anyways if you tap
---
Only Jeff should be exhausted throwing a goddamn pebble because he thicc.
---
I wonder what the map sizes are? How much actually worse is that new limit on empathy?

You're right, the survivor will spawn on the other side of a wall where the totem is next to the gen. ;-P
---
[yup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Nv8bJqeAhOTllIqDx-2fNBaxZnTEsD-iNJAMeD5RJM) 
---
No one is missing the point and I do consistently 4k every match. Playing killer is boring. You're missing the point no one else is. Youte bad at the game and assuming you need instant downs or the ability to teleport around the map to be any good at it and you're wrong.
---
It's really not that stupid of a suggestion. They have a stupidly massive advantage.

What the actual fuck.....?

Jokes on you, I use devour soap.
---
Not true. If you're a single person doing a generator by their self.  
---
At 100ms You need fail every great skillcheck 3 times with a "good" to match someone who taps from start to finish.
---
If you're on a generator with others, you lose even more time with a single good skillcheck.  [Learn your facts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm2FBVvu2ro).

There are a bunch of places where fast vaulting with Q&amp;Q saves a lot of time. A few are: killer shack, garage in gas heaven, freezer and office above the bathroom in the game, the silo in the farm, yamaoka house, haddonfield fences, preschool fence, ect. I never bothered vaulting before but using Q&amp;Q made me aware of the time saved by quietly quick vaulting!

It takes a copy of your account a week before the ptb.
---
That‚Äôs very fair mate. But I‚Äôd argue this change out weighs the cons with its usefulness. I‚Äôd take being able to use lithe anytime over saving a second or two, when it‚Äôs not that game changing to run around the building or slow vault and continue running.

Squeaky wheel gets the grease.
---
Hopefully.
---
Stupid request but can someone copy and past the entirety of the patch notes below this comment? My work blocks the forum site. 
---
Honestly the fact it's based on number of hooks at all is baffling. If survivors don't bother to save each other (or if the killer can juggle them enough that they can't) why should they get punished for that?
---
Holy diver.
---
With new DS, there is no indication that the person is running it until after they‚Äôve used it. Unless the killer is running an obsession perk, and even then, the obsession may not nessicarily have DS. 
---
With the killer having no indication as to who is or isn‚Äôt running DS, if they tunnel, they get punished and if they think someone has DS then they have to waste an entire minute of slugging, which can be countered by Unbreakable or you can just get picked up by an ally, otherwise they have to not hit you down for that same 60 seconds and that‚Äôs the killer literally disadvantaging themselves because they think you have DS. If the killer wastes 4 minutes to tunnel each person because they are scared of DS, then holy hell that‚Äôs a free game. 
---
In terms of Kindred, if your teammates are bad and don‚Äôt use the information it provides, that‚Äôs not the perks fault your teammates are cabbages. It‚Äôs still stronger at all tiers and even reveals the killer from a greater range. 
---
If a low rank killer needs to camp to get a kill they dont belong down there lol 
---
So dumb, and the survivor scoring din't change anything, besides being the easiest to pip.
---
They should of made a sand map. üôÑ
---
They also said no religious themes ever... things change haha
---
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not really meant to be understood anyway... is it even a real language? 
---
Punishing for screwing up 3-5 blink nurse you can't run from unless they are a potatoe
---
when did it change from public test build to player test build?
---
Now that she talks? Can we please include talking in Freddy's reworking? Because let's be real a mute Freddy is one of the weirdest fucking things in existence. 
---
&gt;  Also double pipping as a killer is now extremely difficult as anything less than a 15 minute long 4k is going to be at best a single pip.
---
Three gen Doctor builds are going to see a giant increase.
---
I would love if the killers spoke during a chase every once in awhile 
---
They hide for like 10 mins when they don't need to then eventually they teabag and leave it's a waste of time..
---
I WAS THE ONLY SURVIVOR THAT LOADED INTO THE GAME. I STARTED A GEN AND THE KILLER GRABBED ME FROM IT AND HOOKED ME RIGHT AWAY. THANKS TO MY ESCAPE CAKE, I GOT 1160 BP. 
---
What he means is that it's annoying to waste your time going back and forth between gates getting people to leave. Obviously you can hit them out.
---
Yeah, the new system is terrible. I just did a quick survivor game. 3 gens solo, never went down, won the only chase the killer gave me and got 2 saves. Safety pip. Oof.
---
Killer side I'm worried too. Queues have finally be fantastic at red rank for the last few seasons. No 20+ waits for me anymore, with this new system good luck to me finding survivors once I climb up there. I guess on the bright side, it'll be a long pipping process each season and not exactly a "Welp, I played 1 day and am red again". So I guess that's a plus.
---
I chainsawed one of them I was so happy lol
---
Since it's harder to pip now, there'll be less campers in higher ranks too
---
It is the noise of when the new killer asorbs a contaminated fountain and powers up her vomit. Her vomit for a limited time will injure survivors.
---
Accurate
---
Exactly!
---
Wow my internet is crap, I'm still waiting for it to finish ;_;
---
I read this entire thread wrong lol
---
I thought you guys meant low rank as in 18-20s low rank
---
I didn‚Äôt realize you actually meant low rank, as in 1-5 
---
If someone vamps hook at ranks 1-5 without a good reason, they are bad. But 18-20 I can understand as they don‚Äôt know any better and perhaps just try to get 1 kill 
---
Yeah, it's interesting that she talks! But it's in another language, so it's an exception, I guess? 
---
If ur sick and wash yourself in a fountain,   the killer can use your dirty water to buff herself. Sonif youre hearing a loud sudden "TUNGGGG" Thats to alert you she has buffed herself.
---
Even if I hook and go across the map to find another one that doesn't stop the survivor from trying to kobe and then suicide on hook to make it very difficult to get an iridescent devout emblem, and then assuming the next one doesn't do the same thing which then makes it impossible to get. (1, then 1, and even if you manage to down and hook the last two 3 times then that's still only 8.)
---
It will slowly build up and soon makes them injured, broken, vomit which i think is like a stun, and makes them sperd it around until they cure it. 
---
The infection doesnt do anything until that point. 
---
Thanks for explaining it even though we all agree shes the most T H I C C ;)
---
Did he already complain about survivors being too op and killer being too hard to pip?
---
Hello there... according to reddit you stole this post from me as I (the OP) recieved a message claiming that...
---
I have never posted anything remotely close... wtf Reddit?!
---
No limit to the number of things you can poison at once though? 
---
The problem with rank in this game is that it's just another experience system.  It basically tracks how much you play and how often you perform a few simple tasks. 
---
If it was a rank system, it would be comparing players against all other players before assigning a rank.  
---
If the NFL was set up like dbd, every team with a record 8-8 and up would be in the super bowl. 
---
"she sprays on the face"
---
Yes she did Tru3, yes she did... 
---
Disagreed. If I don't care about my rank and just want to BM someone out of the game, I want to facecamp.
---
if you're on console no
---
She is. But if he doesn‚Äôt like her, he shouldn‚Äôt get downvoted
---
\[Laughs in Overcharge\]
---
You need 3 golds and an iri to pip now. So you'll need to do around 2.5 - 3 gens, escape, get 3 safe saves and win multiple chases. That's the requirement for a pip pretty much. To double pip you need all 4 iri's.
---
Or you could try remaining within the spirit of this thread an actually answering the question... just sayin
---
New killer map... There's still water fountains, but you REALLY don't want to drink out of them. 
---
"Walking backwards" which takes a hell of a lot longer to down as apposed to any other killer in the game. 
---
You have no idea. I played like 5 games now and they are all much more selfish than ussual... no saving, DCing on the sight and no map, powers and perks change exploring... they just wanna finnish the game as soon as possible and leave and if they cant they dc... welcome to ptb i guess...
---
Thank you so much ! &lt;3&lt;3 i'll upload a new one soon c:
---
Me before watching the clip: please don‚Äôt vomit someone to death
---
Me after watching the clip: fuck
---
*SPOILERS* she does indeed vomit someone to death. I‚Äôm actually scared for the contents of my stomach when the dlc comes live. 
---
That‚Äôs at red ranks i‚Äôm assuming? 
---
The killer one....holy shit. I‚Äôm laughing. 
---
Game map mechanic: 
---
The Loo: There are restrooms everywhere and you need to get to those before your timer runs out, if not you'll poop your pants and get a speed penalty for some time and you'll walk funny. If you get to a toilet you are met with very tight skill checks to not make strong sounds and get the killers attention. 
---
Not a problem, especially considering how white she looks in-game
---
Thanks! It took a while to do them ;-;
---
Isn‚Äôt it basically the same though? I don‚Äôt think any map extends more than the 128m or whatever the new change is.
---
That Devour Hope buff. \[*kisses fingers\]*
---
I dont think so since its only a limited time. 
---
yea but it's weird and confusing they should've kept it as it was (maybe even change wake up to be infinite too)
---
I'm sorry, friend. I don't find vomiting to be particularly triggering myself, so I didn't think about it really bothering people. 
---
3 is actually my favorite, but I understand I'm in the minority there.
---
Yes it is - you shouldn't be punished for playing with your friends
---
F12
---
Windows key+print screen
---
Aw thanks &lt;3
---
Cant play it since im on console but it will build up until you are injured and broken so you cant heal. Until you cleanse. However if you do cleanse the killer can go to the fountain and power up and use her power to injure survivors immediately if i understand correctly. Also obviously if you are infected any pallet or person yoy come into contact with also becomes infected
---
Thank you ! &lt;3
---
This would mean more if there wasn't always one survivor licking the walls nearby, and circling like a vulture for the save instead of doing gens when an actual hard camp is occurring.
---
All they're doing is preventing the camping penalty from happening , tanking their teams chance for success and giving positive reinforcement to the killer.
---
*tunnels survivor off the hook*
---
"they can't handle my mind games"
---
Lol that‚Äôs cool
---
I could see that really messing with survivors though if it ever comes down to a 3 gens game where the gems are close enough the killer can run around them. 
---
Going to be fun though, can‚Äôt wait until she comes to console 
---
This isn't even a "Get Good" scenario. You can be a god and still get a participation ribbon if this goes in place on live build. I'm also dreading getting red rank on this system and never finding a single survivor because well good luck with these requirements! They had to tone down the first emblem system to what it is now because queues got so bad and literally nobody was ranking up at a good pace. This is far more brutal.
---
Just turn your volume up then
---
I‚Äôm just waiting for a youtuber to post a video about it lol
---
She seems ok though her power is hard to aim. 
---
quentin‚Äôs perks continue to be danced around with while not actually getting a buff lol. how hard is it to put medkit efficency on pharmacy?
---
Be that as it may. They will need to be chased. They will need to do gens. They will need to make saves. They will don't need to live. Just live long enough. 
---
I'm getting the infinite lobby loading screen bug again which I haven't had in about a month or two. FML
---
You get more thirsty by the minute, but you must resist.
---
I feel bad already.
---
Helicopters and machine guns?
---
It's not like actually everyone is trying it out, very few are. 
---
That‚Äôs cool
---
How do the fountains work? 
---
Nonono, if you put a picture of the Nightmare next to a picture of Littlefoot, you can‚Äôt tell the difference. Do it.
---
Yea no penalties so they can DC as they wish
---
Hearing Freddy not cuss or be a smartass is weird.
---
Jane is fat and she looks good as hell! They're not mutually exclusive
---
3% for each gen done, that is mega nerf
---
I always saw her as being based off The Harlem Globetrotters.
---
On pc. Can I?
---
The spirit and the Legion both had brand new maps. Only this killer has a reskin of a map. 
---
I hope the next chapter has a brand new map.
---
Is it? I saw that corrupt purge puts injured survivors into the dying state and it didn't seem too hard to aim it and it seems OP
---
Disagree tbh, Surveillance is great for killers with good mobility or map pressure.

I actually find many things (even common ones, especially connected with food or eating) disgusting, so I guess I‚Äôll just get used to the killer and the mori. After all, It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs on vr or looks hyper realistic. I‚Äôll manage :)
---
what platform are you on?
---
He complained about it being harder as a killer which it is. Survivor is ridiculously easy to pip.
---
And I get that and it definitely feeds into their goal of having the killer and survivors constantly interacting with each other. But having it at 10 hooks is ridiculous and puts way too much power in the hands of the survivors that you (the killer) can't do anything about. I also get that if survivors quit, or give up then I shouldn't get a free double pip but why should I be punished for something I can't control. If a survivor gets mad that they were caught first and quit why should they have the power to make an iridescent devout emblem impossible for me to earn from the rest? And even if they don't quit and suicide on the hook then I'd still need to down and hook the rest 3 times which will probably be highly unlikely since they will probably just try to kobe as well.
---
Yes there should be a goal, but it shouldn't be 100% in the hands of the survivors. And actually, why the hell would hooks even be tied to the devout emblem, they have their own emblem...
---
Jane is cool but I would have much rather had Brenda as the new survivor...
---
Locker perk could have been called "Out of my face! Out of my face!"
---
Wowww seems like a major nerf to survivors. 
---
ok?
---
It sounds a little like Italian to me, but she hasn't been available yet long enough for me to know.
---
I mean it makes sense given her ability, but... I'm triggered there is no effect of face melting (or something) when she does it and the fact it goes through survivors head just like that...
---
That makes sense, but there have been several chances they could‚Äôve used it for that by now. The nurse double stun from a while back for example. That was ridiculous. 
---
The problem is, I do play for fun. I naturally will get red rank even with these requirements and I'm going to have no players to match with if these requirements stick. That's a massive problem. The first version of emblems had strict requirements (not as strict as this) and queues got screwed until they loosened it up.
---
Thats praobly why they made her tall. 
---
Seems to be so. I don‚Äôt understand the point of some of these changes. It seems like a major nerf to survivors. 
---
Putting an actual value number kind of gives me anticipation that there could be a map bigger than 128m one day. 
---
Finally someone ghetts it
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs pros and cons to the height and I‚Äôm overreacting and maybe those trucks on wreckers yard won‚Äôt be as annoying with this killer as they are with mama bunny. We shall see! 
---
There's a few perks that should be baked into the game because they encourage good play or discourage bad play.
---
WGLF and BBQ should be part of the default kit, as it encourages survivors towards altruistic actions, and killers to leave the hook to hunt for other survivors.
---
Kindred too is a solid candidate to be part of the default since the 16 meter range is straight in line with the new chaser scoring.
---
If it's too loud, you're too old, Bill.
---
It was a feature not a bug 
---
Vomit on your midterm
---
Where did you see it was nerfed...?
---
You naturally need survivors to level at a slightly faster rate than killers to get each ranking pool populated. Remember, you need 4 survivors for every killer. You restrict the flow of survivors to higher ranks, the killers queuing up will have nobody.
---
PTB.
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY
---
ALSO WHY IS IT ALWAYS MEGS AND NEAS THAT DO THIS?
---
My brother was playing his first few games, and unlike me he doesn't enjoy playing killer as much. I have a natural affinity for catching people, so I was giving him tips. this one game deadass lasted at least 30 minutes after it should have ended, because the survivors refused to leave until my brother chased them out. but of course I had told my brother "just sit somewhere on the map and wait for them to leave, don't give them the satisfaction." 
---
Long story short, I left and came back almost a half hour later. he's still in the game, the survivors  refused to leave until he saw them t-bagging at the gate. I had never seen anything like it, usually because I catch all four before things like that happen 
---
They said an ADDIONAL they didnt nerf it?
---
From what ive seen she is very effective. Puke a bunch of survs. Aquire blood puke. Be huntress with hatchet hose.
---
luck only affect things that has a possibility of failure like unhooking yourself and escaping bear traps. noting to do with chests. 
---
Is she breaking her neck with the chain there?
---
It is stackable. But it used to be that way too.
---
How was it nerded exactly?
---
The greatest feature, and they're taking it away from us
---
Imma do this and show my brother as a prank 
---
Id personally be ok with DLC killers/survivors costing that if you want to not pay the money for their actual DLC.
---
I thought that was the silo from the Coldwind Farm.
---
What killer got the plague doctor skin 
---
Or Rancor, which is more common in my experience. 
---
It used to be 
---
2 tokens: 6/8/10
---
3 tokens: 8/10/12
---
4 tokens: 10/12/14
---
And now its just flat out 2/2.5/3 per generator.
---
Hehe true
---
"longer m1" stuff is not what the game needs right now
---
That just means there‚Äôs worse to come
---
No I complain when I get told by killers that they facecamped me because I looped them or when I get told by a killer that he facecamped me because he didn't like that I used Unbreakable and ruined his slugging (real story btw).
---
I don't BM unless it's after the killer has played dirty during the game and I'm in the gate before I run out without letting them hit me.
---
I did the math. Its acaullty better overall when using the teachable version as its 3% more then before.
---
While I do agree you have a very good point, I still find it weird how the OP's argument is because killers need bad survivors at high rank so they can keep their killer rank
---
Basically saying they don't want to play against good survivors 
---
Except the directional audio is really bad in this game. See the hillbilly
---
It stacks more now acaullty. 
---
Alright nvm then.
---
what people wanted was like bp bonuses and shit
---
survivors get bored of back to back really good killers playing nurse, billy, and spirit
---
only if you piss in the bowl before you pour the cereal 
---
this is witch hunting. maybe they were dicks but not worth breaking rules
---
The Doctor.
---
Does this mean I can buy the dlc today or it's being tested 
---
? Why
---
You can't loop her when she has the corrupted vomit. She hits you once and after a moment she hits you again. Plus, she doesn't need to aim like the huntress because her vomit is like Clown's tonic
---
^ someone fill me in?
---
Lol.
---
‚ÄúRather than approaching me you‚Äôre coming closer?‚Äù
---
‚Äú...‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOh ho well then come as close as you like!‚Äù
---
Surveillance is actually very good right now, and def worth running on certain killers. It can put some ridiculous pressure and scare survivors off of doing gens so casually
---
Yes but last gen gives 2 extra tokens, at least it should according to McLean. So when exit gates are open you have 21% bonus action speed
---
Wait.... They buffed BBQ and Chili? OBJECTION!!!
---
I love that bitch slap at the end 
---
Once per charge, and you have multiple charges and it doesn't take long. But in any case, so what? You're saying blatantly false things about how the power works 
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about the Fredster. 
---
Am I missing anything addressing missing audio when Leatherface revs his chainsaw? It doesn't seem to be addressed or in known issues.
---
You want people who get zero points and leaving to get banned?
---
Why?
---
There is nothing lost in high ranks, there is nothing that you can't get back again in a game or two. Why would you ban anyone for ragequitting then?
---
Unless they introduce some actual rewards with high ranks they shouldnt ban anyone for ragequitting.
---
Kinda wish this had a spoiler tag *feelsbadman*
---
Only if they make an option do disable vomit sounds. Otherwise I will instantly DC against the new Killer.
---
Meh, kind of figured vomiting in the face would be part of her mori but once again the mori seems to tame.
---
Causing a bug and then fixing it. Good job dbd 
---
Hmm...I think maybe...But ehhh...maybe not maybe the DVD movie can fit in the ps4 sucker that goess "Neeeeeeh" when you put the game disc in. so maybe it can fit in game. God bless.
---
This is awesome. Good job.
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight
---
Did they say anything about nurse because that = DC no matter what the add-ons or perks?
---
You better be joking
---
I live to serve you.
---
Presumably. Really I just want to use it to annoy survivors more. Hopefully they hear the terror radius and music like they're in a chase. 
---
Also if they DO gain madness it means the survivor hit will be gaining madness as if they're right next to me even if I break away from the chase. Madness gain rate depends how close you are to the doctor, so having the terror radius on you pretty much means for 20 seconds or whatever you'll be gaining madness over time if you escape.
---
Not sure if I should.post this question here but does the ptb mean they are also testing the new characters before they release them or are they available for purchase now on all platforms? 
---
*Feelsamazingman.*
---
So made up?
---
Well i am totally psyched now! Thanks!!
---
What's your motivation? Why do you care?
---
No im not. I said that it can damage once per cast. 
---
Shes also slowed when charging it. And it relies on them curing them and where the fontains on. 
---
:(
---
I also love the fact that I can vomit in dead by daylight too
---
What‚Äôs the original video? I‚Äôm late to the party
---
why would anyone want to play survivor
---
BBQ AND DISTRESSING BUFFS! 
---
Okay, now this is epic 
---
Because you can‚Äôt play killer now ;(
---
It's on the ptb
---
Same here
---
Thank you!!
---
That mori kinda looks weak, I wish the vomit was acidic. Btw that back hand at the end of the mori is hilarious
---
Omg thanks man
---
Isn't that basically what he said..?
---
yep. never mind going to the root of why people dc
---
I still can‚Äôt see it i am sad
---
Corrupt internvention tier 3 is 2 minutes, 
---
Thats 2 minutes of having the map shortened for M1 killers, In other words, Map pressure!
---
Map pressure &gt; Gen stopper. Killer who have map pressure are Top tier, killers who have gen stopping powers are mid tier.
---
yes you can use them both, but no need if you are an M1 killer.
---
right after the Clown's belly giggle was nerfed 
---
Every fart noise you make is an audible/visual ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù to the killer and can follow your visual scent trail for a short time. 
---
The new map is fucking ridiculous. I was in shock looking at it in action. The maps are getting worse and worse for killers
---
I disagree on the power. I haven't played yet, but I've been watching Tru3 and he just swipes it back and forth during its whole duration and it hits people, easy
---
How did you get steam to look like that?
---
You're legit trash at this game for face camping lol me and my boys would have fun with you with our anti camping builds lol get gud 
---
How am I suppose to intimidate survivors without my jiggle!?
---
I started maining Meg with bob cut because she reminded me of Sydney from Scream 2. In my head canon she‚Äôs a final girl. Also I like that her backstory is about her zooming everywhere with Sprint Burst.
---
Welp it‚Äôs gone now :P
---
I 100% agree
---
There is more than one person somewhere getting off with a vengeance to this
---
Y'all already out here attacking Tru3 lol
---
These are awesome. Hopefully the long hair Jane and Meg's cool new outfit release soon!
---
You know I had to Dead ‚Äòard em
---
Girl you had me so **shook** at first
---
Does Jane's backside jiggle tho?
---
The exact killers who don't need it lol
---
It's just a stupid error. Happens to everyone and doesn't mean anything. EAC sucks
---
Reptile‚Äôs new crush. 
---
Clown's jiggle is all right, was the first thing I checked after reading about Kate's terrible fate
---
I know Puppers will be later!
---
I mean, it was never very good to begin with. Now, sure, it has more overall power once the last gen is done, but unless you specifically have an end game build going, then that's kind of worthless. At least the live version has a bit more power throughout the game. 
---
I don't understand the Fired Up changes. Is it better or worse now?
---
You misspelled ruin.
---
THE TAR BOTTLE IS FIXED!!!!!
---
as a trapper main....THANK YOU
---
Yes, i agree that's annoying, but you shouldn't be banned for it i don't think.
---
Just maybe give them a cooldown on when they can play again. First DC a 5 minute cooldown, then 20, then an hour and so on. Just increasing that. And maybe reset daily or weekly.
---
They want rank to mean something.
---
I like browsing new
---
Surprisingly balanced. Her ability is good for map pressure since it forces survivors to go and cleanse before they start causing problems for themselves and their team, but it can also be an excellent chase tool as once it builds up enough survivors go into the injured state and are unable to be healed.
---
I have yet to see any survivor actually infect another survivor, but I could see how it may punish overly altruistic survivors.
---
Biggest downside is that survivors get a full heal when the cleanse at a fountain AND if all the fountains are corrupted they revert back to clean, which sucks but I sort of understand.
---
All in all I feel like the negatives and positives offset eachother well. I have yet to try her with anything more than green addons, though, but then again any killer becomes broken when you start adding in rares and ultra rares.
---
I would of liked her holding their mouth while holding them down with a choke and puking down the survivors mouth until they choke on it (probably a bit too graphic though)
---
This patch sounds fantastic, real excited to use thanatophobia finally
---
Tougher than most killers, maybe, but when you figure his playstyle, you can do it. 
---
And using any of the range addons makes the game easier almost exponentially. 
---
I wrote a pretty indepth guide a while back if you're interested in upping your Freddy game  :D
---
hmm, okey. Doesnt sound amazing to be honest, not sure. Did they make a video? Or where did he talk about it?
---
People will appreciate it a lot more than essentially any doc build with Devotion, I. E. "Automatic 3 Gen strat" 
---
Dbd relation?
---
I'd say not getting banned off the bat, but the punishments over time like you suggest. But if you DC consistently over a long period of time, then you don't *really* want to play the game, do you? Might as well ban you lol.
---
IF YOU ARE THE LAST SURVIVOR AND I AM PASSING HOOKS I AM TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE HATCH. STOP WIGGLING BECAUSE IF I CATCH YOU AGAIN YOU ARE GETTING THE HOOK.
---
ALSO IF I GIVE YOU THE HATCH BE POLITE AND AT LEAST SAY SOMETHING IN END CHAT. I'D TAKE AN INSULT OVER SILENCE.
---
I'm fine but thanks anyways. I usually stick to endgaming with Freddy. I kill one midgame and the rest at endgame. 
---
Perk But Wait There's More:
---
Allows the survivor to put an additional add on to an item, making it three, of common/uncommon/rare value. 
---
Its better then the teachable version. 
---
Im genuinely uninstalling.
---
Ardetha private messaged McLean on stream and he told us that Fire Up will go to 7 tokens. It‚Äôs bugged on PTB but it‚Äôs what McLean said
---
Guess you'll need to stick to sucking on fingers :P
---
I bet those two are hell to hook. 
---
High effort, no pay off.
---
I think the prayer and voiceline is a bit weird. Sorta like kills the pacing
---
WAS RUDELY REMINDED WHY I AVOID WATCHING THE STREAMS OF PEOPLE WITH "TTV" IN THEIR NAME WHEN I PLAY AGAINST THEM AS KILLER. HAD A FUN MATCH, BASICALLY 4K'ED (ONE DC'ED ON FINAL HOOK) GAVE A "GG" IN CHAT, DECIDED TO CHECK OUT THE STREAMER'S CHANNEL. 
---
OF COURSE, THE ENTIRE GAME, THESE TWO NASALLY PRATS WERE TALKING SHIT ABOUT MY PLAYSTYLE, CALLING ME TRASH BECAUSE I WAS USING MY TIER 3 TO ACTUALLY DOWN THEM (**WHEN THE FUCK ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO USE IT?? WHEN IM KICKING A FUCKING GENERATOR??**) 
---
THEY MADE NO ATTEMPTS TO JUKE ME IN CHASES, ACTIVELY AVOIDED SHACK PALLET, FELL FOR THE MOST PREDICTABLE MINDGAMES IN THE BOOK, AND LET ME STALK TIER 3 OFF OF THEM ABOUT 4 TIMES. (HEY, IF YOU DONT WANT ME USING MY TIER 3, THEN PLAYING RING-AROUND-THE-ROSY WITH ME AND A STACK OF TIRES WHILE I FEED OFF OF YOU ISNT THE BEST WAY TO FUCKING DO IT.)
---
**ALSO, TWO DECISIVES, BOTH MISSED L O L**. BOTH WERE RUNNING SELF-CARE, DS AND ADRENALINE, BUT OF COURSE **IM** NOT ALLOWED TO RUN META PERKS. WHEN THEY SAW MY LOADOUT, ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE. HOW DARE I COMBINE RUIN AND BBQ!!!
---
THANK FUCK I DIDNT GIVE THEIR NEA THE HATCH. I NEARLY DID, I LEGIT HAD A FUN GAME. BUT WATCHING THAT STREAM RUINED IT FOR ME.
---
System is fine quit whining and get better
---
They should buff his fingers.
---
Did they nerf ruin?
---
Merchant of Mirrors killer when?
---
So you're telling me that escaping without getting downed once all game and getting chased for at least 3-4 minutes doesn't mean anything? 
---
Peach skin for Meg! 
---
THANK YOU DUDE/DUDETTE!
---
Did you say he reposted mine?
---
WOW so many killer perks got buffed and so many survivor perks nerfed. What the fuck BHVR, I‚Äôm so close to throwing away this shit. 
---
LMAO
---
RIOT.
---
Someone got triggered.
---
Black Jesus casts the first stone.
---
That is completely and utterly meaningless.
---
The "Teachable Version" is the Tier 1 perk, and the only tier of any perk that matters is Tier 3.
---
Is this all the upcoming skins??
---
Feels like there is some cosmetics missing compared with the previous chapter
---
**TEH FOG TICKETH**
---
So you know why people DC?
---
[Template for others who would drop their pants for Dwight without glasses](https://imgur.com/a/X8xUOYu)
---
It's not worth running over other perks that are stronger, you will get better results with them.
---
Can you get the banners too?
---
To each his own
---
You said it's hard to aim. It absolutely is not. And you never specified once per cast until pressed.
---
Love the billy miner cosmetics
---
How can I get better than escaping without getting downed all game and getting chased for 3-4 minutes? Please tell me wise one. 
---
Porn
---
Now OP you have to make another one, but Dwight over dios face!
---
You can use custom themes for Steam.
---
When?
---
ON BEHALF OF KILLER MAINS I'M SORRY. I DON'T TUNNEL - EVEN IF YOU ARE A TEABAGGING JERKWAD.
---
I HAVE STANDARDS.
---
I ONLY CAMP WHEN YOU'VE BEEN SANDBAGGING YOUR TEAMATES OFF THE HOOK. I ENJOY WHEN THE OTHERS COME TO POINT AND WATCH YOU DIE.

&gt;t a plague doctor skin

This one ----\^
---
I fucking love everything about this.
---
Black...FTFY
---
So David didn‚Äôt get anything??
---
Th killer doesn't
---
Lol. Buff to ruin and chili....why? Killer main btw lol.
---
Wait is this real?
---
Very nice
---
Aww thanks
---
i dread noed
---
That‚Äôs an absolutely terrible idea. The killer would  exploit that to see if the survivors are close to them. 
---
I ain't a silly salty rage quitting survivor main who whines about ranks. I could not care less how you do it.
---
I will! 
---
I think they might have misinterpreted the joke of fire up being op.
---
So you didn‚Äôt do any gens, Help heal, unhook or any of that? Why should you rank up then
---
Unfortunately no. They do not appear to be in the files yet.
---
Damm
---
Then explain  Nea (jk)
---
Tf yay more m1ing. Thanks devs!
---
Yeah I wanted it to be stricter, because as it stands now on live, you can sneeze and hit high rank. But, on PTB, the difficulty is definitely going to kill rank 1 queues.
---
Thx for this my friend! Now Im 100% sure Im Jane main lol 
---
It is. 
---
Skinny jeans plus a nice skirt. Loose hair too. Now I want a Latinx killer and a day of the dead outfit for mamacita.

You know I gotta pallet stun em

I would, but I like the more recent Claud skin with the gray jacket and jean shorts more, so I'm probably sticking to that lol
---
Monty! No!
---
Professionals HAVE standards 
---
I Moried a survivor who had just been running around aimlessly and decided the best place to heal was directly in front of me.
---
Got a message which simply said "I deserved that"
---
THATS FAIR.  I SUCK AT KILLER TOO.  AND SURVIVOR.  I SUCK PERIOD. 
---
I did a gen and a half and opened an exit gate and got gold in that category.
---
I got a heal or two I think but the killer didn't down anyone all game so I couldn't get unhooks. 
---
What's your name in game? I'd love to try my damnest to match up with you and puke on you game after game. You DC, oh cool I guess I will too. Oh hi, we're in another game together. Over and over. Until you get a 5 day ban üòÇüòÇ
---
Thiccn't*
---
Is she now officially the first character in the game to speak? 
---
NOBODY LEAVES BUBBAS BASEMENT
---
Who are the tux and black pants between Kate and Ace for? It looks like David because of the taped hands but there's no head piece that corresponds with it.
---
Like I said, I become physically ill from the animation and sounds of the vomiting.  I guess I'll go add some years to my life in addition to the 38 that I already have in order to not sympathy puke?  Thanks for the good advice.
---
YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE, BITCH
---
I want to know what she says.
---
As someone who only speaks English and Japanese, it sounds like complete gibberish. I doubt it's based on anything
---
It‚Äôd be cool to see a werewolf or vampire chapter 
---
If you don‚Äôt count the huntress, then yes.
---
Yea, play killer for week, you will probably scream ruin needs a buff lol. I also hate ruin, but was learning the spirit for past week, and without ruin oi boi games end fast. Especially if team is not a complete potatoes.
---
I just wish the maps had a better rotation. I'm sick of getting corn or cars 5 games in a row.
---
What level do you play at where you don't run into SWF groups on console? It's almost all I see at rank 1.
---
I know, but I‚Äôd rather have a better perk than save a couple second of running... 
---
Its good though. Dying light really encouraged a toxic playstyle, and its good theyre moving as far away from it as possible until a rework comes in.
---
Aaaand killer lobbies are super long again :( 
---
She‚Äôs really flexing those nails 
---
a killer should only get 1 kill from NOED. If he get 2 or more kills its the survivors fault. The killers job is to kill, your job is to survive. Once you see the killer has NOED gtfo.
---
Someone seems a bit bitter about survivors lmao "salty rage quitting survivor"
---
I'm a killer main and the only reason I'm playing survivor rn is cause finding a killer match is taking 10,000 years. Although even I'm not salty enough to call every survivor I come across a "rage quitting survivor main" lmao the bitterness just oozes out of you it's hilarious. 
---
Omg so cute 
---
Nobody ever thinks about the Fredster unless it‚Äôs to point out that he‚Äôs the worst killer. üò¢
---
&gt; I become physically ill from the animation and sounds of the vomiting.
---
Aww boo hoo :(((
---
You're playing a game revolving around murderers that involves loads of different grotesque sounds, get a grip.
---
Le surprise. Killer whines again. Not everything has to benefit the killers. Survivors also need to counter them out there will be no game. 
---
Lol nope rank 1 killer try again man.  Trash crutch for trash players.  We don't need it.  Killer is in a really good place right now balance wise.

They'll probably release more over the next month or two like chapter 10.
---
My bad! I forgot the full set and head pictures for it. It is for Jeff.
---
I think it‚Äôs crazy people still compare DS to Noed, not fun getting hit with Ds  multiple times, and the counters (dribbling and slugging) weren‚Äôt fun for survivors. You want to compare a survivor perk to NOED? Adrenaline both completely ignore a health state

I have been wanting to have a Werewolf chapter for so long, even if they do this kind of design for him. 
---
Oooooooooohh!!! That's so cool.
---
I was totally confused because I was like... *"but if I invest in her and not buy the dlc... do I get a refund or something?"*
---
So they "copy" your data when switching servers, but that progress is totally irrelevant from the "main server".
---
Awesome. Thanks for helping me!
---
:'( fucking Jeff. Thanks for the reply though!
---
At purple ranks you'll need 4 golds or 3 Iri to pip. GL with gen rushing.
---
I mean i only say that when someone Sneezes. I don't see why I should for a burp. 
---
My welcome what?
---
Well if you think about it cannon-wise, after being hooked repeatedly over and over for years on end, you'd get used to it and your screams would become shorter and shorter
---
Can we get Pete as a Killer? 
---
Wtf, no David is not dad Ace is. David is boyfriend or fuck buddy. 
---
Jane looks so cute in her skirts. &lt;3
---
Hag also looks great.
---
Kate looks trashy as hell and like she'd give you a STD by just looking at her.
---
Usually is because killers tunnel and camp, making it impossible for the survivor to even play the game much, 
---
I think the ruin buff is okay (I never run it) but I don't get the chili one at all. Also a killer main who always runs BBQ.
---
PLAGUE DOCTOR SKIN YES BITCHES
---
Agreed, am I reading something wrong? Survivor is so easy to zoom up the ranks. Killers didn't need it to be harder on them.
---
Thank you for answering my question. You have a nice day. 
---
Nah, Fredster man can moon walk. He can‚Äôt be the worst
---
I wouldn't rely on this being the final product being released.
---
When The Spirit was on PTB, she had The Nurse's voicelines during her Mori and when pallet stunned.
---
Dio would make a great killer tbh.
---
r/lostredditors? 
---
I have a question about PTB. Am I able to play any character or only the ones I already have + new characters? 
---
Im a trash player,  why is this op? 1 hits and faster speed are nice, but you still have to find those little shit chlodettes hiding in the grass. 
---
Agreed. They really treated us after the disastrous Legion patch.
---
I think it is for Jeff honestly
---
Mildly hilarious that one of the first perks to show up in the blood web for him was noed and the first tier 3 I got was also, noed. My trapper is only level 17.....
---
Patch not dropped for poe yesterday, just a lot of reading.
---
&gt; survivors get bored of back to back really good killers playing nurse, billy, and spirit
---
You want bad killers/survivors at high ranks?
---
Is the instaheal mecanic in so it doesnt turn into a leigion type problem? Where no one heals cause its so easy to be injured.
---
Im just now looking at the ptb so I still dont really understand her power
---
Thanks for this.  Isn't there usually a big sticky with the datamined stuff at the bottom?
---
What‚Äôs funny is that I can‚Äôt remember the last time I won against Fredster. So anything that makes him anything but the worst killer makes me feel that much better.
---
No its sort of a buff. Everyone is affected by it, the regression penalty is just different each tier.
---
I think it is good for newer killers to you know - slow the game down just a little bit.
---
Like the ones who pop tier 3 when they're chasing an injured survivor? Happens way too often i swear lol
---
I love the jane cosmetics, the emphasis on her boobs though lol
---
Would Fire Up be better if it started @ 5% with 0 gens done and then increased by 2% per gen completed? This would be a buff at early game, while only being 1% behind when there are 2-4 gens done then finally 1% above when all gens are completed.
---
So it would look like this:
---
0 gens done.
---
* Live: 0%
---
* PTB: 5%
---
1 gen done.
---
* PTB: 7%
---
2 gens done
---
* Live: 10%
---
* PTB: 9%
---
3 gens done
---
* Live: 12%
---
* PTB: 11%
---
4 gens done
---
* Live: 14%
---
* PTB: 13%
---
5 gens done
---
* PTB: 15%
---
I'd honestly love it if when someone DCs, their bloodpoints get equally (or as equal as you can get) distributed to the rest of the Survivors still in the game.
---
If everyone DCs then the Killer gets all the bloodpoints.
---
Interesting questions! I'm looking forward to test the things ingame.
---
this is so sad, can we buff leatherface
---
Thats not a werewolf. Thats a demon from hell 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt like the mori...  feels cheap in my opinion. Great killer and concept/ mechanics. Only thing that doesn‚Äôt do it for me is the mori. I‚Äôm probably in the minority though. 
---
Puke should've been red instead I think.
---
Buffed version green or any other color.
---
Survivors puking blood seems more fitting.
---
Too many 7's and 3's. Patent fake number generation failure.
---
hahahaha
---
Physically ill because of sounds btw
---
I was saying he's right
---
Jane's last outfit tho 
---
I mean, it's still immersion breaking
---
Yeah, you sound like just another toxic survivor main. We are not obligated to play "fair" to you. If the idea of losing a game is that traumatizing to you, then please leave this community. The last thing we need is more crybabies.
---
Fire Up gives a movement speed bonus now?
---
Sure do you have links I could copy? 
---
I haven‚Äôt updated mine since the friend redesign because it broke my old skins, but now I see I need to get metro again
---
Can't play from phone, 1/10, literally unplayable. /s
---
Well how about for a toxic Nea build where you‚Äôre running around fucking with the killer
---
Omg rude af. Take that back immediately.
---
Which is punishment in a way as you are the reason everyone escaped yet you don‚Äôt have anything to show or gain from it. It‚Äôs poor design. 
---
But it stacks now it didn‚Äôt before or did it? 
---
So ... I must have been dreaming when survivors DC because of the map, or because the killer finds them first and knocks them down before even first generator is done because they suck at evading the killer?
---
I did this a year ago but EAC did not let me play due to the change of the intro so I had to replace it with the original one. 
---
Nurse.
---
If they‚Äôre bad, it‚Äôs not too bad. A bit boring maybe. 
---
If they mastered it? I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs any real counter play, and it‚Äôs 0 fun. Some argue that since it takes skill, it‚Äôs fine, but that logic is flawed. Just because it takes skill doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fair or fun to play against.
---
There is a plague doctor skin for the doctor in the new PTB
---
I also find him fun to play, but he is sort of objectively poorly designed. He doesn't take much skill, just tap frenzy and you're just straight up faster and just as agile as survivors, so chases are on a timer in a way.
---
And moonwalking is basically stabbing someone to start their bleedout timer, looking away from them to "break" the chase so their timer starts again, then "chasing" them while facing away so that the timer keeps going down until they drop. If the surv stops to heal, you hit them. If they don't stop, they fall down.
---
Honestly I'm not surprised you haven't heard of it, for all the hubbub about it on this sub I've literally never seen it used before, not even once, and I've played about 100 hours since the DLC release.
---
I mained him :,) good times
---
well yeah it doubles your bloodpoints. even if it didnt have the aura revealing part most people would still use it
---
You say that and used "boi" in the same sentence. Irony 
---
Jeff is Davids hubby &gt;:(
---
Who cares tho
---
You mean like when killer also DC on maps? The latter happens but not as much as when the killer's tunnel them to oblivion.
---
"No one cared who I was until I came out of the locker"
---
They need to keep their viewers entertained, and that's an easy way to do it.
---
Watching a stream now and this is almost literally what the streamer is saying.
---
What do you mean it's silly?
---
1. Time and time again I always wonder if the devs tested this as survivors as well.
---
2. I think I have more problem with the corruption screen on survivor.  It's like Legion's deep wound effect.  Fix that too please!  I can't see anything
---
3. I don't notice this but I'll see if I notice it next tie.
---
4. I kind of like it.  &gt;\_&gt;
---
The only meg outfit that matters was the curtain skirt. That whole outfit is a look.
---
Don‚Äôt try to sidetrack we are talking about survivors here and how it is always - in your logic killers fault - that survivors DC
---
Done.
---
I can feel him joking because of how The Plauge makes people vomit which would be the equivalent of a scream from doc
---
But somehow still has a thigh gap...
---
NOED is like the rules parents make up for the youngest sibling who is upset they can't compete in the big boy game. 
---
If you can't win the game within the confines of a normal match -normal speed, 2 hits to down- and the Survivors pop 5 gens, you now get to play with Baby Rules, where you get extra speed and 1 hit to down.
---
If people want to use it while they get better at playing Killer more power to them, but so many NOED users either think they're good because they got NOED kills or insist certain Killers need NOED. Let's not pretend it isn't a pair of training wheels.
---
No he doesn‚Äôt but go off.
---
Same, but alas I'm on console so now PTB for me lol
---
Reddit is so fucked. Why is "i enjoyed this" downvoted to hell. Why is reddit? Why do? Why do anything?
---
__*PWYF__ now works on The Clown*
---
A blessed day indeed.
---
Omg this would be fucking hilarious, imagining seing a random survivor thrown at you out of nowhere
---
I guess it depends on how you look at it.  I grew up on noes, f13, Halloween, and all that, being a kid at the time with 3 older brothers.  The first movie I ever saw was when they forced me to sit and watch Pumpkinhead late on a Saturday night.  To me, having a silent Freddy really blows and authenticity he would've had.  Myers and Jason make sense for that, but Freddy was well known for his banter. 
---
No we're talking about cause and effect. In majority of the time survivors DC because they feel they have no chance to even play the game at all,which mostly induced by the killer's action, which the devs never bother to address. 
---
Im sorry i dont get the dwight/locker relationship. Am i missing something?
---
Yes it has been done before, it feels like I just gotta look at the top 5 posts see most of DbD subreddit's content for the day because it feels like everyone is repeating eachother
---
nice
---
You say that like it is a bad thing. 
---
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD KILLER IS SO DIFFICULT YOU HAVE TO TUNNEL. ITS A LEGIT STRAT.....IF YOURE A BITCH.
---
" The "corrupted purge" after purifing a fountain should work only one time. I had a match where everyone died in one second because she could hit us from metres away many times. And in a chase, I got caught in 2 seconds because of that. I can describe this problem as "a overpowered Huntress" "
---
If this gets changed, the healing effect of drinking from the fountains should also get removed.
---
It makes abandoning an infected and hit survivor pointless, since they'll just heal at the next fountain...
---
Well ranking up is also harder now. Thing is that studies were done before and it's been proven that you basically need to hump all 4 Survivors on the hook until they die for the anti-camping emblem to take effect.
---
thana is not buffed, its still shit.
---
Never knew i needed this
---
Probably not since the description says, "The survivor will emit a terror radius while your terror radius is reduced to 0" but who knows
---
Twitch gives anyone the ability to broadcast their play, creates big ego's
---
Nerfs to survivors in that they majorly buffed Ruin, BBQ, and Thanatophobia and nerfed DS. I understand DS is frustrating to play against, but I would just leave them on the ground or dribble to a nearby hook. DS is no more toxic than NoEd. 
---
Totem spawn is a good change. 
---
I understand the blindness in lockers because if lockers block your aura from the killers and survivors, why shouldn‚Äôt you be blocked from seeing outside auras? Goes hand in hand, I feel. 
---
Happy hunting everyone! Remember to bring your vomit bags and look out for the fountains, because there are no preventative  measure in the realm against the plague.  
---
I'm just saying it seems like an unrealistic thing, but sure maybe...
---
uh i dont have anything to rage about...
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
Nuuuuuu 
---
Spirit, seems like I rarely escape against her.
---
On the opposite spectrum, love games against Huntress and Nurse because I'm a console gamer
---
its the samething in high ranks (1-5) all I go against is Billy, Nurse and Spirit.
---
I envy your experience, then. I realize that I'm making a blanket statement by addressing all twitch streamers, but this is honestly the behavior that I've been conditioned to expect from these people. It happens so often.
---
Not liking the new emblems either. 
---
What got nerfed? Empathy still covers the entire map and Lithe is finally better. 
---
Same, one even let me join his Discord. 
---
Mmmm vomit
---
Tasty
---
Myers isn‚Äôt OP. You just have bad luck dude, I get the best killer variety in those ranks. Red ranks consist of Billy, Huntress, and Nurse if you are on PC. Otherwise Myers on takes her place.
---
In fact McLean just confirmed in chat of a stream I was watching that it's not any different and while the text has always said unlimited it has been 128m in the code the whole time
---
We wait for release date like all platforms. 
---
Nice
---
Nah man it‚Äôs a game. That‚Äôs that on that. Chill lol
---
[stares in confused Stake Out]
---
It sucks because people run me around near the hook and make ME lose blood points for a stupid survivor running me around the hook and then they mad for camp
---
Yo dude whats this Steam setting you are using?
---
I know that it was supposed to be scary but even when I first watched it I smiled. (After the initial scare)
---
But in Spanish, if you‚Äôre generalizing something that‚Äôs both feminine and masculine, wouldn‚Äôt you just say it‚Äôs Latino, as that‚Äôs how you would say it in Spanish?
---
Spirit is the most fun to go against in my opinion you never know where or when she'll pop up or if she is even in her soul form (minus the whoosh)
---
Metro skin for steam
---
RvB memes
---
Next patch notes:
---
Jane's ass reduced in size as too many players stare at it. 
---
Nurse because you play on console. Do you only play for no challenge lol?
---
*justifies disconnecting and leaving the lobby so the players have to do 5 gens*
---
Can I be the first one to start ~~bitching~~ giving feedback: Why am I able to kill 4 people during a pretty drawn out match with a lot of action and still depip? (No, I didn¬¥t facecamp)
---
That can¬¥t be right.
---
You didn't earn the pip because the game was too easy. You don't deserve to pip if the killer sucks ass, which is by design.
---
That is so shit
---
am i the only one with initialization and server connection problems here? :/ am in germany btw
---
B
---
Need piercings cosmetic 
---
Irony is a cruel mistress
---
No I mean does anyone know when it comes out for ps4
---
The new Pip system seems terribly designed. Just saw a Survivor streamer get 2 unhooks + won a few chases + multiple gens and was not even close to a pip
---
No it's actually from a web series called Red Vs Blue! It's taken from here: [https://youtu.be/I0grFFAxySw?t=97](https://youtu.be/I0grFFAxySw?t=97)
---
Dwight just got himself a thicc GF:
---
https://i.imgur.com/4O6XBxp.jpg
---
Would be a blessing to not play DbD for a while tbh
---
This is a buff not a Nerf lol. 
---
AAAAAAAAAAND you lost me there. Killers apart from nurse suck ass because there are still countless nearly uncounterable loops on nearly every map. Killers are still in a shit place.
---
True but it is a more recent term
---
Considering the amount times survivors DC because of the reasons I mentioned before and the reason you put up ... your reason is hardly a big thing 
---
Trapper getting a Miner look
---
Sounds like the devs listened in during the ‚Äú we want MyBloodyValentine killer‚Äù postings all last month.
---
Even tough i didn‚Äôt smile it was honestly one of the weaker scene from the movie, but that doesn‚Äôt make it less awesome.
---
You get a 3% bonus for every completed gen, including the 2 extra gens that auto complete when the exit gates are powered.
---
Since they're are 7 gens in total, this means you got an action speed bonus of 21%, which sounds wonderful to me.
---
Exactly what they said. 
---
It is always either Claudette or Dwight every fucking time.
---
‚ÄúOG tiddy out queen‚Äù üòÇ that really made my day 
---
talking shit keeps the numbers up and the people watching tbh. I usually lobby dodge people with "xxx" in their name because they're usually toxic players who DC or send hate mail post match.
---
I would agree. Basically any killer who is not legion will prob have 2 injured survivors on average. That comes out to a 12% action speed reduction.
---
Basically a 2 second increase in healing time when healing another survivor. A 4 second increase in self care healing. And 9.6 ish seconds on a generator working alone.
---
It really isnt good on anybody EXCEPT legion with this change. If it counted dead survivors it becomes a contender for a perk slot like sloppy butcher, nurse's, enduring, spirit fury, and the like. As it stands there are probably better things to run since you lose the buff if you manage your objective and kill people.
---
LOL true
---
lol it just makes it 40 meters, would be dead if they killed end game points tokens 
---
A killer shouldn't purely rely on add-ons to be decent. 
---
Forgot to add, the miner outfit at the top is indeed for the Trapper.
---
what?? I think it's so cool! Like she's announcing she's about to send you to the afterlife 
---
If all pools stayed dirty until she cleansed them, then killers can just make it so you're all sick with no way to heal and be a constant 1 shot...
---
an unknown language, so they can get away with it
---
Any try hard Billy I hate with a passion.
---
DC on maps is really rare but you can tell yourself that it's plenty if it makes yourself feel better. 
---
Shit, we can actually replace the original one with Crab Rave
---
You're broken when the sickness is fully charged on you. (No mither effect) using a pool takes away the effect and also heals you.
---
When she super charges using the fountain her vomit is able to injure  and also down survivors for (40?) seconds
---
It is the same for survivors though. If the killer is doing badly you wont get much benevolence/evader.
---
While it seems weird I think this is done to guide people to play less "boring". Less camping or you wont get devout, less gen rushing or you wont get evader/benevolence etc.
---
Every killer has both!
---
I love the chanting, it makes the mori for me
---
I swear you're exaggerating. I rarely see Myers run NOED unless they are running a mirror build.
---
where it go :(
---
Maybe a little anti-climactic, but overall pretty cool tbh. I love the fact that there's SPEAKING here. They've said they'll never do real speech I believe, mostly to avoid translation complications, so using an ancient probably gibberish languange is smart as hell.
---
I think the only thing I'd love to see added to this Mori would be some writhing post-mori. Instadeath from a Plague seems off, but if the "Corpse" started writhing in pain outside of the animation (survivor wouldn't have to stay to watch, but it'd be there for the Killer to see) I feel like it would add SO much to this.
---
sorry guys i gotta go home, the entity is calling me 
---
Rank 4 Trapper main here. I never see Trapper mains like myself at high ranks, it feels like. So I must represent. 
---
[Relevant](https://i.imgur.com/a19A5Y3_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)
---
It's a struggle with myself to not run NOED on trapper, NGL. I haven't run it in quite some time. 
---
Though when I get bullied to fuck and back having all my traps popped constantly due to likely SWF(turning me in to a m1 killer) , getting looped at double window fuck towns, ruin cleansed in 20 seconds, etc, it's tempting to run it. 
---
Though I know how frustrating it can be as survivor to be having a good game and get smacked down in one shot from NOED, so I suck it up and desperately try and emulate scottjund's killer tile video (often to no avail).
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vKukDEFMtbc have fun
---
Give up on that one XD it hasn't been in the shrine for over a year 1/3
---
Ooo that‚Äôs tricky haha, I like it 
---
That‚Äôs the best part.
---
before anyone shouts LORE, lemme get at something.
---
At first killers needed to commit an act of pure evil to gain attention to the entity, then along came spirit, who hurt nobody, Then devs said the entity can take killers from any WORLD, Meaning this is possible.
---
The weak nip slips got nothing on Lisa. 
---
Read the post.
---
Their information was also incorrect-even partially. So they should get the same treatment.
---
Their numbers were off. :)
---
Fire Up perk changes are unclear, please clarify what change has been made to it.
---
Why is no one mentioning the terror radius changes when it comes to vertical sound. That‚Äôs huge for maps like the game
---
&gt; AND is easy to land
---
You're the first person I've seen being honest about this
---
It needs to be somewhere in between this and the old system. This is too hard to rank up and before was too easy. 
---
But if the game was too easy, doesn't that mean that OP is probably at a lower rank than they should be and should therefore rank up? 
---
I personally hate going against Bubba and Doctor
---
Can you hire this guy to do this shit or something?
---
Thots are great imo, please don't slay them 
---
Yes, the terror radius still gives madness if the doctor is in treatment mode, so assumably, the other perks work with Dark Devotion as well.
---
If you ever catch me in a lobby, don‚Äôt worry - I don‚Äôt do that. If you‚Äôre good and kick out asses, you get a compliment on it, and if we win and escape, you get a gg regardless. There are a lot of streamers who I feel don‚Äôt know how to be a genuinely good person and forget it‚Äôs only a game. At the same time, there are tons who do, though I feel the former outweighs the latter. 
---
I would love a shape shifting ability even tough it might be a bit broken at first.
---
Does that mean I can r/woosh myself?
---
I never finished that movie
---
Understand the palm of my hand, bitch!
---
I love her voice so much
---
Until Dawn still lives on ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yes, but a god nurse takes 100s of hours idc who you are.
---
That's... underwhelming.
---
Sure, you can basically replace the intro movie with anything you want in the game files. You just have to rename the video to match the original
---
I love this Mori, I agree some twitching or something would really sell the fact that acidic puke just went into the survivor. 
---
Yes, though i just found this one on youtube
---
Can someone in the PTB please tell me what Fire Up looks like now? The patch notes were extremely unclear. Thanks.

This is terrible design.  The goal of a rank system is to group players of equal skill levels.  If a game is too easy that means the Survivors should rank up and killer rank down in order to separate them from each other
---
If you just wanna play Nurse it takes a day on console. That‚Äôs what OP wanted.
---
at least we get a plague doctor skin for the doctor 
---
I hate that they require 10 hooks to get an Iridescent in Devout. You have to hook each survivor 3 times save 1. 
---
Oh nice
---
I would love to see alternate moris at some point. Or for the Devs to brush up on past moris, you can see a bright line between Trapper‚Äôs mori and the Spirit‚Äôs. Maybe brutalize them a bit
---
McLean confirmed in Jen's stream chat that empathy is unchanged and that 128 meters goes all across every map and that this was literally only a text change, nothing about the effect of the perk actually changed.
---
PTB is usually two weeks and drops on Tuesday/Thursday. I‚Äôd wager you can mark your calendar for March 19th or March 21st. 
---
She got that event outfit not too long ago &gt;.&lt;
---
It cause everyone is wanting to play the killer probably 
---
Interesting thought. How about putting that as part of the Blindness status effect instead? Adds some more viability to that condition, while also buffing Third Seal.
---
I‚Äôm not gate keeping. Why would you want to play a game with no challenge? That‚Äôs like playing soccer with no goalie.
---
Allow me to recommend No Shock Big Cock DocDoc (silent build on Lery's for maximum surprises)
---
Rank 17-20 (BEIGE): 0-8 points = 0 pips; 9-13 points = +1 pip; 14-16 points = +2 pips.
---
Rank 13-16 (YELLOW): 0-5 points = -1 pip; 6-9 points = 0 pips; 10-13 points = +1 pip; 14-16 points = +2 pips.
---
Rank 9-12 (GREEN): 0-6 points = -1 pip; 7-10 points = 0 pips; 11-14 points = +1 pip; 15-16 points = +2 pips.
---
Rank 5-8 (PURPLE): 0-7 points = -1 pip; 8-11 points = 0 pips; 12-14 points = +1 pip; 15-16 points = +2 pips.
---
Rank 1-4 (RED): 0-8 points = -1 pip; 9-12 points = 0 pips; 13-15 points = +1 pip; 16 points = +2 pips.
---
Plus, they changed some Emblems:
---
Chaser Scoring: The proximity penalty has been increased. The longer a Killer stays within a close proximity (16m) to a hooked Survivor, the more points they will lose in the Chaser emblem.
---
Devout Scoring: The scoring thresholds have been modified. 3 kills now also result in a Silver emblem, whereas 4 kills results in Gold. To earn an Iridescent Devout emblem, you need to perform 10 or more hook events and sacrifice all 4 Survivors.
---
Gatekeeper Scoring: The scoring formula has been adjusted completely. Killers earn incremental points based on how few generators have been completed, each minute for the first nine minutes of the match - regardless of how long the match takes. The longer the gens are not completed, the more points they are worth. At the end of the match, the Killer also gains bonus points based on how few generators have been completed. Note: If the match is over before nine minutes is up, they receive points for the remaining minutes (up to nine) based on how few generators had been completed at the end of the match.
---
So did ace lol. 
---
I find Spirits power is best used while chasing someone once you break line of sight. Since Monitor and Abuse expands the terror radius during a chase it means even if there‚Äôs a bit of distance between you and the survivor they still won‚Äôt hear you coming. 
---
As for Whispers, TBH I‚Äôm not a huge fan. The only killer I find really gets the most use out of it is Huntress. BBQ should be the only tracking perk you need since once you get the hang of her you‚Äôll be hooking people and be onto the next survivor almost immediately. But if you don‚Äôt have BBQ, Discordance would benefit you mostly just to stop the early gen rush but if they spawn in separately suddenly you‚Äôve wasted a perk slot so I‚Äôd say Surveillance would be a better perk on her. 
---
I imagine if the thing was a killer, you should be able to become birds as well as survivors 
---
Nice try, BHVR.
---
Totally agree, it does. But usually two minutes is enough to find at least one person, which means you can start the cycle to an extent, at least. Also people tend to focus on Ruin from what I've seen, which means if you do use TotH, you can find people for free :)
---
Now we are talking creepy shit!
---
&gt; This is too hard to rank up
---
So, r1 will be well deserved

No Mither buff when? :PepeHands:

I just played a game as killer and depipped with three DCs... this system might have to incorporate some new way to compensate the killers when that happens.
---
&gt;Jane worked *hard on*
---
See, we predicted this guys
---
Please guys im no snitch 
---
THANK YOU. I AM SOCK OF WAITING 10 FUCKING MINUTES FOR A GAME JUST FOR THE KILLER TO DODGE. JESUS CHRIST ARE YOU THAT SCARED OF A CLAUDETTE!?
---
I would be perfectly ok with them throwing the complete bloodweb under the bus. I see no fun in leveling it after you have prestige 3 because most low level addons are trash and you probably never play them ever. And going through 20 of them per web to get the 1-2 items you want is just a hassle.
---
Nice, that's what I was hoping for. I didn't think any map was larger than 128m but there are some that feel huge. 
---
McLean was on Jendise‚Äôs stream saying it counts every gen on the map. So when all 5 are done, its a total of 21% because of 2 extra gens. 
---
Why they gave it to self care instead of pharm to begin with is beyond me. 
---
:(..
---
Why did you tell this guy and not the guy who asked?
---
This is not true, McLean said in stream chat that empathy is unchanged in the code and it's only a text change
---
it doesn't really take long to get broken from what I've noticed, if she hits you a couple times you're close to or go into broken. That alone is already enough to use the fountain since you're fundamentally in exposed status. The healing straight up feels like it punishes her for not tunneling since you're otherwise not making use of the broken status and they're getting full heals in return. Her upgrade is good, but you might as well just play huntress if you want range damage as she doesn't have to worry about fountains.  
---
Increasing the amount of time to cleanse might help, but we'll have to see as they tweak it
---
To be fair with the xxx thing. A lot of people on xbox made their accounts a long time ago. It was just a trend and there is no point to change the gamertag now.
---
I don't sit on the sub that often. And with the few legion's I've seen, I dont see that.
---
I think that being able to see other survivors in your vacinity of the frenzy can be annoying if you decide to travel half the map to find other survivors
---
That would be so cool. I wish they made all of the mori's more gory.
---
Uhhm that's Meg
---
Where do I put feedback?
---
The chanting is cool, kind of surprised me. A killer with a voice. 
---
Spirits ability is a little OP imo but for me it‚Äôs the dang hag!! Like holy are those traps irritating and ALWAYS no matter if I set them off on purpose or not they always scare the fuck out of me 
---
That explains so much Kappa
---
Lol DBD studies? Now I've seen it all.
---
Well I don't think it's going to matter much, it just feels too good to get kills, and camping works well in a lot of situations. They need to make it mechanically difficult, maybe by slowing down the hook timer when you're close and not in a chase, rather than just discourage it with fewer pips.
---
Oo ok interesting, I‚Äôll give surveillance a shot also, cheers
---
I think I need a lot of practice using her vanish though... I‚Äôve ranked myself up to the high ranking killers, so it‚Äôs not easy for me to ghost walk against the high ranks. I usually lose them.  I try to go by sound if they are hurt I can tell sort of where they are, but scratch marks alone don‚Äôt help me a lot because of the way they spread a lot of the time.  Grass movement helps sometimes as well, but it‚Äôs more rare because it seems the survivors run out of it. 
---
The most effective way I‚Äôve used her ability so far is against looping and such. Having a standoff around pallets or something and I‚Äôll stand there for a second. First I‚Äôll watch and sometimes they will run or take the pallet thinking I‚Äôve moved in ghost form away, but usually they are smarter and stay put, so then I will really use the power and usually get them. Or like you said with the nurses calling, they think I‚Äôm chasing someone else and I sneak up and get them. 
---
More trickery than actually chasing 
---
&gt; Also people tend to focus on Ruin from what I've seen, which means if you do use TotH, you can find people for free :)
---
That's just too many perk slots to try and get this going. You encounter one survivor who's good at juking and it's fucked
---
Why does Steam look different than I remember it..? Update or different PC?
---
Longer games without camping, what's not to like?
---
DEAR THAT ONE SPECIFIC MEG: YOU HAVE A SHIFT KEY. PLEASE DON'T WALK UP TO THE HOOK, UNHOOK ME, THEN WALK AWAY. I STRONGLY DISLIKE YOU.
---
GOD BLESS BALD HAG IN A TOGA
---
Might be your monitor 
---
I swear you're exaggerating...but I don't play much survivor.  I play both sides heavily and they run it constantly.  It's pretty nuts considering how strong he had always been.  
---
Am I looking at a butthole?
---
DAMN IT DWIGHT
---
Hudda hudda haa! 
---
&gt; I never see Trapper mains like myself at high ranks
---
There are a couple of us
---
Personally, I think knowing when to give up on a spot is going to be a lot more important with Plague than most other killers. But, I respect your opinion. Maybe you're right!
---
They probably took the copy of your save from before you prestiged  your feng. It was likely from last week.
---
There‚Äôs no real point to levelling her again on the PTB, the progress doesn‚Äôt transfer back to live servers. 
---
Am I the only one who is unable to access it? It asks for a code and when I use the one I found on the wiki, it just says "code denied"
---
Well thank you for your decency, and I do hope to catch you in a lobby sometime :) It sounds like it would really be a breath of fresh air to play against you!
---
Welcome.
---
Not quite. You have to play in a certain way in order to get all your points. I've 4manned 3 games in a row and still have yet to pip. 
---
Is it worth it to use agitation, and iron grasp for a basement build?
---
I run make your choice on hag, and every time i get someone in the basement it's gg. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Killers are considered the bad guys???
---
There‚Äôs literally no point to broken, you‚Äôre not going to run to a survivor to heal you after you‚Äôve been puked on, you‚Äôre going straight for a fountain.
---
not an issue, It takes your data from some time ago, things like that can happen
---
All 2/3 of these statements are false. I have BBQ, but I don't use Ruin unless I absolutely have to.
---
I have the same problem now. I also can't join lobbies as survivor. It worked fine just a few minutes ago.
---
can you use the pools if youre not puked on?
---
&gt; I think knowing when to give up on a spot is going to be a lot more important with Plague than most other killers
---
Yeah, I think that might be true. I've noticed that people playing Plague are having a lot of trouble getting kills and I think they're playing her wrong and not doing this
---

I ran into these guys 3 times now, only got them once because one accidentally step on one of my traps, and I downed the other one when he was try to save his brother.

That's why I bring out the best addons and a mori when dealing with streamers.  Most of them are dicks.  There are a few rays of light in the void, I admit but the majority are trying to be entertaining for their audience in the worst possible way.  Ochido is a prime example of this.  Noob3 before he calmed down is another.  AngryPug is another example.

Can someone please tell me how long the ‚Äúperiod of time‚Äù for The Plagues third perk actually lasts instead of the vague description they keep going with?
---
If you are decent at running the killer around the perk is useless, it will run out by the time you get hit, and getting hit on purpose to be able to use your perk is kinda silly.
---
Actually though.
---
Funny enough I didn't hear about any bans from people who abused the glitch. 
---
I'm sorry but honestly there is no way you ate playing killer optimally or even close to efficiently if that's still the way you feel.  I play several killers but I play more Wraith and Trapper than anyone.  Most games are kind of a joke, sometimes you get super crutched out swf but even then you can usually still at least 2k.  No pallet vacuum along with the reworks of the buildings and window spawns makes chases very easy to end efficiently.  A lot of loops can still be mindgamed and they eat hits constantly getting to pallets now.  If you play smart and efficiently you can consistently win with nearly any killer at this point.  Freddy and Legion might be the lone exceptions.
---
I thought he did sneeze right after the burp?

kiting
---
WELCOME TO PRIME TIME BITCH
---
No I still don‚Äôt agree with you.
---
Tbh this game isnt fun at red ranks as killer unless you like putting yourself through the wringer of stress on a constant basis. So if they make it so I have to play sub optimally as killer to reach red ranks I'll just continue killing as efficiently as possible and try to stay in the mid to lower ranks. Less stress more fun for me. Sorry to those survivors who really belong at those ranks and are not optimal.
---
I've realized I like killer until survivors get really good then it simply isnt fun anymore because it adds to my stress rather than being a fun way to pass the time and reduce stress.
---
NOBODY IS PLAYING SURVIVOR ON THE PTB AND EVEN IF THEY ARE IM RANK 18 SO THERE IS NO CHANCE IN HELL THAT IM GONNA FIND ANYONE

Seriousely... what game are you fucking playing? Do you know about all the issues on Coldwind or litteraly any other field map. Killers except for nurse cannot end chases well. If you can you are playing at rank 10 or below.
---
Big thancc
---
The PTB uses older saves from about a week ago. 
---
No it's awful, one of the worst if not THE worst Deviousness point generation
---
Yeah I'd agree, definitley feels like a worse off huntress. Pretty creative niche with the fountains but it hurts more than it helps forsure. Hopefully they tweek it before release.
---
GO GO LEFION RANGERSSSS
---
Yes but doing so will make the pool dirty but it will make you go up a health state
---
voiceover pete wil never die
---
So, what you guys think about insta heal at fountain? Does it make her weak, or is it ok? As a survivor main mostly I'm happy, but it feels a bit too much. She will have to be balanced it seems, maybe a bit more time to get broken status and don't heal at fountains.
---
New ranking system is a big ?. So if I got chased all game and killer won't catch me I will depip and go against even worst killers? It sounds this way. You pretty much have do to an insane amount of job to pip.
---
Thank Christ. So that means around the 20th or 22nd it officially drops and no more DS finally gets fucking nerfed. 
---
Dat Plague Doctor skin~
---
You dont lose chaser points if a survivor is also within 16 meters, too.
---
Check the pinned ptb thread
---
There is already so much in the game to discourage camping, in fact they just cranked up the amount of chaser points you lose from chasing, and if you are camping you aren't going to rank up in the first place.
---
Is that Kate on the cosmetics? That face looks a lot like Madonna somehow lmao
---
Instead of hearing ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!!! I would just be his terror radius sound spamming into your ear

Not really buffs though. Just. Making the lower tiers more equal.

Thank you kind sir or maam üòä
---
Then its not fucking with the killer, kiting is essential to make them lose as much time as possible. Note that any good killer will give up the chase if youre taking too much of their time. Any exhaustion perk, adrenaline, and anything else. dance with me and quick and quiet can also be used to lose the killer after a windown juke
---
The data is taken from March 1
---
If you want to be up there, you'll need to play in a way that devs consider most skillful. It's unfortunate that your definition of a high-skilled killer differs from theirs.
---
I'm putting Ricardo Milos on it.
---
I don't think this will help much though. Unless it's shown on screen how much killer is losing in either BP or pips. I think that's what BHVR doesn't get: the implementation on how things can work. 
---
Youre not hearing this from me but a distant associate  of mine says they got banned for 2 days and all characters they performed the glitch with reset 
---
Yup! In my defense I was super groggy and hadn‚Äôt quite gathered my bearings yet when I said that. 
---
What the fuck is this change to Devout? Why should I be required to extend the fucking game just to get a max rating for it? This emblem system if whack.
---
They didn‚Äôt do anything for me, I p3:d Jake and Ace and glitched like 10 insta heals for David
---
**sigh** *unzips*
---
Dad...1 teach me how
---
2 how did u get the enhanced steam thing? I haven't been able to
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs mostly just cause there are more survivors than killers. I wanna say a 7:1 when it should be 4:1
---
That is a buff.
---
This one man haha.  And nope I hit rank 1 within first week and stay there.  Rarely depip even the occasional game I lose I typically still safety due to my playstyle.  Biggest part of the game is knowing when to chase and when to abandon that particular survivor and pressure gens.  The pallet vacuum pretty much was the biggest change we needed man.  They cannot make a lot of the loops they used to anymore.  They have to juke you to make a lot of these pallets these days.  You are not playing efficient killer games if you still find survivors to be the ones with all the power.  It hasn't been that way for like 6 months.  Killers that still use their NOED crutch at this point are just looking for mindlessly easy games.  Survivors are about to lose their biggest crutch shortly with the next update, but you'll still see the baby killers running theirs I'm sure.
---
What do you mean no challenge? It's not a "gimmie" when it's Nurse/Huntress... And you're aggro because I don't like every game to be sweaty?
---
Fountains should just cleanse the sickness rather than fully heal imo.
---
Every Doctor I've played against has been a camping, trolling, bastard. Either him or Wraith cuz the invisibility makes me panicky.
---
Sad there aren‚Äôt any new Adam cosmetics
---
So if you can lead the killer for longer than a minute, which shouldn‚Äôt be hard (I say as my teammates get combo‚Äôd because of failed 360‚Äôs red ranks btw) and get downed after DS times out, it‚Äôs still not wasted. As long as you aren‚Äôt dead on hook, you can re-activate the timer after you get off. And if the same thing happens where you run the killer for one minute minimum again, you not only wasted a minimum of two generators, but the killer hasn‚Äôt applied any pressure to anyone else and that‚Äôs a game throw already. And just because your DS runs it‚Äôs tiker, don‚Äôt just purposely get hit. Honestly you could even feint having DS until your death hook meaning the killer has to keep getting ran to kill you. By that time they‚Äôve invested so much time into getting just you off the game, they will legit lose and even derank with the emblem changes. 
---
I've been calling it doc myers but I'm definitely going with that from no on.
---
It's Ukrainian
---
Yea they either need to fix this before they send the patch live or just keep what we have until they figure out something better. This is bad. 
---
Ah okay, thanks!
---
As someone who has played and won a variety of very competitive and High-Profile tournaments with a substantial monetary prize, I can assure you that the way the devs are attempting to make killers play is one of the least viable strategies that you can do against even average R1's.

Can you please link it? I know that‚Äôs annoying yo ask. I‚Äôm having trouble finding it this time around, as well.

That's not a buff though. A buff would make the end result better. This is just making it so people fucked by perk RNG aren't as fucked.
---
I don't know about you, but seeing as you can't willingly go back tiers, and any competitive scene should be seen with tier 3 perks, this isn't a buff. This is just consistency.

Sssss Du Yu Wanna Ghet Sued! ‚ÄúQuote from Willy during the Shinning episode from tree house of horror‚Äù

So the 4 survivors should have more control than the 1 killer?
---
Can survivors still cleanse themselves in corrupted pools?
---
I think that it‚Äôd be fair if the Corrupted Fountains gave the Killer a one hit down. 
---
As it is right now, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs balanced very well.

I've only been on the DBD Reddit and Planet Dolan Reddit in my whole time being on Reddit.
---
That said the range on it is higher than I anticipated. It works really well with Dance with Me. 
---
It looks like that happens in the vids I have been seeing. Like survivors have a 5 or 10% reduction to movement speed. Drastically increase the killers looping capabilties if it was the case.
---
Other than that I was hoping the vomit would slow channeling speed to counter gen rushing. Something like a 25% decrease to speed rather than just making them injured. Suppose it makes thanta really strong on her though now that thanta is decent.
---
yeah i was at rank 1 survivor for the ptb. did a gen, healed someone, and got chased with multiple pallet stuns and escaped 3 times (about 5 mins total of chase) before going down and dieing at the very end. de-pipped......
---
The mods on this sub are so goddamn picky on some posts yet there are others that will break the same rules that stay up anyway. That's why I don't bother posting shit here anymore.

---
What? You said that those 2 killers were the only killers that didn‚Äôt have sweaty games. No. I have never said that you can‚Äôt play video games if you don‚Äôt want a challenge. I just said that I didn‚Äôt understand it so don‚Äôt put words in my mouth. You said yourself you like to play against these killers. Nurse is a bad killer on Console so you like the added ease of playing against her no? I was just saying I don‚Äôt understand why you wouldn‚Äôt have want opposition in a competitive game.
---
Lol. First time I've seen someone point that out!

No fix for false saws on Billy. How about that.

Yes he does. He hasnt gotten one since July 31 2018. Which was his pastels. Not robes. My mistake. David got some during August 22. And got some for wicked wares. So yes. He does

There's no way it 90%. I don't play a lot of survivor, but I do watch a ton of it on twitch. Very uncommon for Myers to have NOED. 90% has to be an extreme exaggeration.

I love that, but I'll admit, I was expecting a skyrim opening for it.

Ohhh makes sense. Sometimes i do things because im not really thinking straight and look back and realized. So i get it lol
---
It's just a very basic recolor of her original outfit.

The idea of the double pip is that you are way better than your rank, and so you should rank up faster. You should have to have a literal perfect game at red ranks where the best players are, working as intended.

Thanks for the reply. Interested in trying her out though so far she sounds like a less annoying legion. I'm just happy that distressing apparently gives you 100% bonus bp so less farming.
---
Dang. Was hoping her long haired version would be in there
---
Anything you say? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
My hope for a miner killer is slowly decreasing with each update, tho :(
---
So I'm just a god at this game then?  I don't think so.  I just play efficiently and chase intelligently.  Playing killer is all about multitasking and making smart decisions with your time and applying pressure accordingly.  I'll never understand you killers that still try to have this victim mentality about the games balance for us.  Playing killer has never been easier and it's about to become more so with the changes to decisive. 
---
That seems like it‚Äôs too late to matter to me though.

Damn, I didn‚Äôt even realize that was Kate. I thought it was Nea....

Hot damn how bout Ace‚Äôs slick shades and a ducky shirt? Hook me up with that
---
Hey another quick question mate, what do some of her addons do? For example
---
Katana tsuba: slightly increases yam haunting reappearance duration and movement speed? 
---
Just like we changed Legion with feedback right
---
They said in the dev stream that perks that have effects with your terror radius also apply to the transferred terror radius, so it's possible it could also interact with powers.
---
You have a much prettier face :) 
---
I disagree that the add on is the issue. It just exacerbates the already existing issues with his power. But as I said it‚Äôs clear we have differing opinions on this and that‚Äôs fine. Your opinion is just a valid as mine as it‚Äôs based on personal enjoyment of playing against legion. I don‚Äôt enjoy it and you do somehow. To each their own. 
---
I'd kill a man for a whiff of that burnt chicken nugget stick right now
---
Remember when people thought legion was weak.. 
---
It takes time for people to get used to the killer as well as figure out how to use/abuse their power to the full effect 
---
with hits through pallets and vault hitboxes, I think it‚Äôs clear that the devs are supposed to be the bad guys
---
So was Myers intentionally nerfed a patch or two ago? There was so many more objects I could stalk through or over compared to before. 
---
I gave it
---
Chicken nugget stick huh? I think you mean chicken finger or tender. Lmao
---
Can you do a get the claude's her flashlights and bloody shirt?
---
Legion *is* weak
---
*The country singer Kate Denson? Haven't heard that name in a long time*
---
I may have agreed with you if you said why this killer was weak. This killer is the third ranged killer and the second one that can do damage to survivors. Having the ability injure and deal damage to the survivors with a ranged ability immediately puts her above half the killers. She can potentially bring the chance down to 1 hit because of her ability to put people into the broken status affect. She hasn‚Äôt been out for long, but she is definitely at least upper mid tier.
---
That Kate outfit is horrible! But I'll probably just buy the head. Jane looks great, love all her cosmetics :)
---
Freddy's pussi juice tendies, ripe with Jane's honey mussy
---
Been in the new matchmaking for 30 minutes.. no sign of survivors, I think they all went to r/dbdgonewild and have vomited themselves to death
---
It's called monitor and abuse for a reason
---
Safety isn't being punished.
---
I‚Äôve been having a lot of fun running an all-totem build on her: Ruin, Devour hope, Haunted Ground, and Thrill of the Hunt. It‚Äôs a gamble since all of your perks gan get destroyed, but when it pays off, you get that sweet 4-man mori. At worst, the gens go slow because they‚Äôre spending time either looking for totems or unhooking, and you can get a few free downs with Haunted + some totem or gen grabs, depending on your add ons. Even if they cleanse all your shit before you‚Äôve even hooked two people, you‚Äôve still got one of the best killers in the game and can probably get a 3 man even when perkless.
---
Knew it was gonna be a Plague Doctor skin. The best part of discussing on this sub is being mass downvoted and bitched at by people who want everything to be specifically the way they want and soon after for them to be slapped in the face by official news/content. 
---
&gt;it said it was because sometimes People switch characters by mistake.
---
On console, yes. On PC you had to press HOME / END, which are quite impossible to press by mistake. 
---
Seems crazy to me to run NOED on oneshot killers. 
---
I try and avoid running NOED for the most part because I know how frustrating it is to get smacked by it after a good game as survivor. However running on killers with the ability to onehit down anyway seems like extra bad.
---
According to The King on youtube it's 120 seconds at max rank.
---
Yo cuz ruin definitely needed a buff right?
---
This limits the abilities of survivor a lot. My personal opinion is that she‚Äôs really fun to play as and to play against. She‚Äôs like the pig with the secondary objective and not completing it in time give a penalty. I don‚Äôt know about other people but I love her.
---
Lol sounds fun
---
I‚Äôll definitely be trying this
---
I need more practice as her however, I‚Äôm not good at chasing people using her ability, I have to use it more as a sneak attack or mind trick around pallets or windows 
---
A weapon to surpass metal gear.
---
This is now my phones background, thank u for this beautiful art! Love the dark lips too, they should make a hardcore huntress
---
Yeas
---
Can Head On hit you from the side/behind a locker? What is the cone of effect for it?
---
I got stunned from the back right of a locker and just wanted to know if it's latency or just very good.
---
I meant to reply to the first guy my bad
---
I love bowser's facial expression like hes genuinely learning something from zangief in the 2nd photo
---
Pipping is totally fucked at the moment. They either need to re-evaluate entirely how killer pips work or the shit is super bugged. I've been watching twitch streams of high rank killers and every single match has resulted in a de-pip lol.
---
Have you read the flair?
---
When you reach a certain amount of sick you become broken like how Adam gets when using deliverance. You can‚Äôt be healed. Then she just m1‚Äôs you. Outside of that her corrupted vomit can almost huntress fast two tap you. Her water pools do insta-heal survivors and remove the status effect
---
Anything for daddy.
---
Read the flair
---
Then I guess my experiences are just that, my experiences. Bad luck I suppose lol but regardless I feel better for griping 
---
Where do I replace the file?
---
Nurse and Legion have literally zero counter-play and surviving or not literally comes down to if the killer is terrible or not. 
---
Two horribly designed killers.
---
I do it for the daily rituals and the extra blood points so I can level up the new characters lol. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what a lot of people also do. 
---
now i may be into weird stuff but a vomit fetish is something i will never have, SIR
---
I'm curious to see how the new Hag hair looks on the model. I've wanted a loose hanging braids/dreads cosmetic for her for a long while. Really like the head-wrap ones for Plague that cover her whole upper face, though. 
---
Same. Everyone is too smart.
---
I just watched it happen to Tru3. The range is pretty wide
---
Not even wrong
---
You were playing as the best survivor so I knew you‚Äôd make it out alive, but jesus christ, watch your back as you runüòÇ
---
Unplayable.
---
SO MANY KILLERS WITH 400+ MS I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME.
---
NO MY INTERNET IS FINE MY WIFI IS GOOD AND THERE ARE NO OTHER NETWORKS CLOSING ME DOWN. I HAVE NO TABS OPEN OTHER THAN A COUPLE OF REDDIT TABS.
---
Thank you, i couldn't find it because i only sort by new posts
---
Thanks
---
Can confirm, at rank 2 survivor I got all gold everything and I still only safetied. It's not my fault we all did well lol
---
easy down, but not quick down. Even with cheese Legion takes too long to end individual chases and has the worst map pressure in the game
---
‚ÄúBecause my survival rate is higher with these killers.‚Äù I dunno if its me but I think that implies you like them because they are the easiest. I prefer a challenge over ease. Sure I like a Nurse game once in a while but they are like farming games. They are nice but if I get 2 in a row I get tired of them.
---
This post is from 2 days ago. Why.
---
I WAS PLAYING ON PS4 AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT I COULDN'T VAULT THE BUS WINDOW ON WRECKERS BECAUSE I GUESS IT'S STILL GLITCHED AND THAT UPSETS ME.
---
If The Plague is corrupted while she moris it actually is the corruption vomit
---
You mean the blimp? 
---
LOL I've been watching True's stream and you can land it from super far. It's kind of silly lol
---
I got rancor on my Plague, it's been fun showing everyone this mori. So many people want to see it
---
Yep, on this subreddit about three or four minutes ago lol.
---
They can be attained free with shards
---
Shouldn't you kids be in school?
---
Needs to be thiccer
---
That's good to know. 
---
Made a shitty mock-up of what im talking about in paint https://gyazo.com/b5a9d83139e3fd757e6f81de3751e3f2
---
Not sure where to post this, but initial thoughts on the killer: 
---
She has a ton of problems, maybe the biggest is that survivors instantly heal a health state when cleansing at a fountain.
---
The slowdown when charging the vomit is severe enough that a survivor can just run to the next loop. 
---
The fountains are a cool concept, but it's super inefficient to utilize the corrupted fountains. If survivors cleanse at fountains that aren't near objectives, then you're going to sacrifice a ton of pressure and most likely not hit anyone with the corrupt purge by the time the timer runs out.
---
The hit detection on the vomit really needs fine tuning. 
---
The most effective way to play her is to vomit repeatedly until a survivor is in broken status and then one shot them. So....Legion. 
---
The infection isn't all that consequential. Yes, it ultimately forces survivors to cleanse at a fountain or risk getting the broken status, but the corrupt purge isn't threatening due to the inefficiency of the killer gaining that ability and the poor vomit functionality. It's a worse version of dream state.  
---
It's not really clear what she's supposed to be good at. Hag is a map pressure killer. Clown is a chase killer. Spirit is a mindgame killer. Etc.  The Plague just doesn't seem effective at anything. 
---
Spit goes over trucks, it's all good
---
Yes if you exploit a very specific combo he can reliably get free downs.
---
Vs actual good killers who can just end chases quickly
---
I was fully expecting the Skyrim intro
---
Depends on the map
---
oh, that's totally meaningless fam
---
And the 4, 3, and 2 percent you lose in between that. This is a nerf.
---
Also, you gain 1% after 5 gens, not lose.
---
Too much is too much... 
---
Is that a plague doctor cosmetic I see?
---
The more blinks, the higher your chances are from hitting your opponent, but after 5 blinks \*and\* a hit, the Nurse is immobile and blind for upwards of 5 whole seconds and you just got a massive speed boost for 3 of those seconds. I usually never go above 3 blinks because escaping a chase is a cakewalk for stealthy survivors unless the nurse is running Bloodhound
---
ah 
---
Well her ability to range attack has a timer and u have to travel in order to get it for some seconds. I not only think shes weak, but I also think they havent done the "rol" properly. When u play agains the hag u face the traps, with mayers u need to be alert all the time just like in the movies. With the plague u dont even get infected when u unhook someone. In fact, in all the games Ive played I didnt see even one time a survivor infecting other survivor in any point. The infection also doesnt feel like that. Same move speed, same vault speed, same everything. It was suposed to be a power to slow the game down and spreed chaos betweem the survivors but its jut disappointing at every levels. I had the 1000.000 bp for her, hope they fix it.
---
Im not calling for a nurse tier killer, but for the love of good at least Mayers/spirit. 
---
Soramstr
---
What do u mean whit fully charge??? 
---
For sure, but in general.
---
I don't have a clip of it, but I got smacked by it when I was punishing Survivors for rushing the Hook.
---
Honestly it's a LOT better for the Killer. You get stunned as you lift them up, so the only time you lose is the actual stun. AND unless you're tunneling someone off-hook, like I was (they were all trading positions on the Hook and rushing it after I hooked someone, so I feel justified), you'll probably never encounter it at all.
---
I FEEL LIKE THEY NEVER TRULY FIXED THAT 1 SECOND DELAY AFTER FAST VAULTING ON PS4.  I USE LITHE AND HALF THE TIME I FAST VAULT WHILE RUNNING THE KILLER MANAGES TO HIT ME THROUGH THE WINDOW EVEN AFTER FAST VAULTING AND BEING COMPLETELY THROUGH IT.  A SMALL DELAY! NOT SURE IF ITS ME MAKING EXCUSES BUT IT BOILS MY INSIDES WHEN I GET UNNECESSARILY HIT!!
---
I don't think you get how this works.
---
Sorry if i'm missing something but does anyone know when the patch will go live to the actual game and not PTB?
---
9k shards each

---
Probably. 
---
This. Exactly this. Plus, you can use Q&amp;Q to save your butt when you only have a split second left to jump into a locker before the killer hooks someone, avoiding BBQ in the process. People don't realize how beneficial Q&amp;Q is.
---
Anyone else not a huge fan of the killer, seems like she can be exploited pretty easily
---
We shouldn't judge it based on top tier players. The vast majority of people cannot do that
---
I would have laughed if they made it so quiet you could barely hear it.
---
Nice, one loop is gone, what about the next one they run to, also what if I dont have that one addon?
---
I LOVE WHEN THE KILLER AND SURVIVORS ARE BOTH FARMING ME. SUCH AN AWESOME FEELING. 10/10 WOULD PLAY THIS MATCH AGAIN
---
&gt;when it‚Äôs not that game changing to run around the building or slow vault
---
Those waste time. I don't like wasting time. Or my Lithe.

Intro file isn't something its likely to check. Same as portraits etc which don't change the game play.

Yeah. Agreed

Does this one come with a 100% less DCs?

I mean. She doesn't do it in the mouth at least. Just all over the face. That's better.

Imagine if she made out of the survivor while vomiting in to their mouth directly. Think about it. Contemplate on it.

---
Without his few bugs he's a very good killer, he is totally better than trapper
---
Not at 11pm, Karen
---
Everyone has ruin 3 anyway
---
&gt; There are perks that will help you find immersed survivors, but if none are working towards the objective then that's a plus for the killer
---
Eh, if you really want to make a build around that, I guess go for it. It's also going to be quite map dependent. And it's only a plus assuming you find someone in that time. Otherwise it's totally nothingburger
---
If you read his lore, he eats people. My guess is they already had the Hillbilly and needed to come up with some different title for him.
---
Name: Yes
---
Everything else: doubtful
---
Oh shit, cool I didn't know that 
---
100% right. If you're jerking off to video game characters, you're sad a sad as fuck virgin. LOL.
---
AHahah
---
Wraith? Trapper? Neither of those are the worst to you?
---
Happens both ways.
---
Another case of someone only playing one role thinking the BM is exclusive to that role.
---
Still, nice killer idea 
---
Look at my profile
---
I think its going to be really popular with killers that lack map pressure like clown or trapper. Allows for faster finding of survivors and easier build up of momentum. I think it will become popular but I still think people would prefer to use ruin especially since totem spawns are improved.
---
If survivors move away from the furthermost 3 gens then they are more likely to find ruin as they travel to other gens. 
---
 I met these two a while ago, absolute legends they were
---
But you get to play as them with those levels for the duration of the PTB. I don't see a problem.
---
Damn i am big noob no need to get pissed
---
Tonight was a nightmare, 3 games in a row with survivors spamming flashlights and bringing toolboxes. It was a very fun experience with a level 3 Plague.
---
I can only see this decent on Doctor or the few killers with ultra rare aura reading add ons
---
&gt;  It seems like a better and more reliable alternative to Ruin at least.
---
Ruin can be defended and can even stand on its own for longer than two minutes. 
---
Typically a higher leveled killer and survivor with their perks lets us further test them better to give more feedback.
---
It‚Äôll most likely be meta on Doctor. 
---
Anyway we can hook up a controller and use it for us filthy console users?
---
*smoking splinter baby*
---
It's a shitpost, Carl
---
I appreciate this
---
Yeah stake out is bleh, I just try to make perks work but stake out is just bad.
---
I had a pretty good game last. First one I had no Idea what I was really doing, I just kept vomiting and smacking them and vomiting on gens and pallets. I think shes pretty good. maybe just as good as clown. maybe even a bit better. but thats just 1 game, and I haven't played survivor against her.
---
Reminds me so much of the puker‚Äôs kill animation from dead space 2

I like the iridescent seal add on, kind of cool how it only only occurs at certain times

you can't just say this without linking to more info
---
I thought you were looking for comments on a build and got really confused
---
Just happened to me too. RIP Survivor's pudding. 
---
Calling surveillance garbage is being to kind to what it was
---
it's worth going for perks for two reasons,
---
1: removes them from the pool so you are more likely to find perks you want
---
2: if you rush to a perk you can start the entity taking nodes 2 purchases faster making each level cheaper
---
Fuck sake man. I would have left or broke something by then. I dont get internet till tomorrow but I dont know if it's even worth it now

She slows down when she heaves for the vomit.

No way. Without even playing with it, I can already see perks that would go well with it (if the above effects are really the result). Whispers, surveillance, and stridor would be great perks to go with CI.

I mean, I‚Äôm on console too and I‚Äôve been facing some really impressive nurses. I haven‚Äôt faced an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or inexperienced nurse on console in quite some time.

---
So unfortunately, there aren‚Äôt many ways to stop it, punishment wise 
---
I think so. It's pretty easy to just spam it and get hits, and with the regular vomit you can just spam it across pallets until they're injured/broken

Still being shit doesn't mean it wasn't buffed.
---
On Xbox usually a hard restart of the console solves the issue.
---
Ye but I'm on PC
---
I stream this game as often as I can, and if the killer is completely demolishing me, I am not afraid to say it. Gotta give credit where credit is due!

So mixtape and moonwalking is strong.

Play Legion without addons, and tell me how it goes.
---
Then play Nurse or Spirit without addons, and compare. Tell me which killers are strong.
---
I personally really enjoy both Spirit and Clown.  I dunno, I think they‚Äôre pretty damn good. And they were two out of the last three. 
---
Im sorry, this is the most absurd statement I have heard. This is basically the same thing as saying, "Ok killer, you hooked me now leave so my friends can save me." If a Killer is going to face camp you, then guess what, he is already being penalized by getting drastically lower blood points, and chances are, if you have a competent team, you are going to force the de-pip. Quit crying about camping, and learn to counter it.

DS is just bullshit now. I don't get why survivors perks get nerfed every single patch as they buff more and more killers perks. I'm so done with this game.
---
I was expecting Skyrim opening I am disappoint
---
I never claimed that it didn't happen both ways, I know that it does. This was just my personal rant, I simply don't play survivor enough to have ever encountered a streaming killer who was being an ass, otherwise I'm sure I'd have the same gripes with those people.
---
Yea thats true, they are really good, and the hag reworks makes her really strong, but we have been disappointed with legion and I was so excited about this killer... 
---
With two exhaustion perks where neither is sprint burst, you could use one if you've not used the other recently. I see a lot of people running Lithe and Balanced Landing, for example. You don't get exhausted using the locker-busting perk unless you actually stun the killer.

From what I‚Äôve learned in her lore, that is her praying.

You know 1000 x 0 is still 0 you silly goose.

For me its usually an "in heat of the moment" kind of thing. The last thing i want to do is offend anyone. I try to not be salty or toxic best i can. Sometimes its tricky whe you have a few bad games in a row.

I've taken to self depricating. When I go down its 99% of the time my own potato play and i own it.

So I'm sincerely sorry you've had bad experiences. A small proportion of us are okay I guess. 
---
Ahahhahahahhahha. The needed ds and buffed BBQ. Ahahhahahhhahhhahha.
---
Not the point of what I was saying....
---
You can't determine whether a killer is strong or not within 5 hours of release. People haven't even figured out how to effectively use the plague yet. I used legion as a reference as the motive switched from "legion is trash" to "legion is broken" once people had time with him and found out how to use/exploit his mechanics
---
That's an interesting/unnecessary change. But ok I'll bite, why was this *buff* added? As a survivor aside from maybe 1 game on rank reset everyone already seems to have ruin 3 on whichever killer. I  guess its good for newer people just starting out? 
---
No because the regular power is crap. Whats the point of a broken status when they can insta heal in 6 seconds hun?
---
I do understand it. Quite well, in fact. Tier 1 and tier 2 are irrelevant. The meta is built around tier 3, tier 3 is the majority of use of any perk, tier 3 is the only version in which changes are relevant. Changes that do not happen to tier 3 are not buffs or nerfs because they do not impact the meta.

Lmao. "I'm not saying the new killer needs to be the best in the game, but she should at least be 2nd best."
---
I'm really *really* digging this new killer/perks, and the new survivor's perks look pretty fun (especially locker punch). I sure hope mid chapter patch brings some form of change to The Legion. That would be real swell
---
That's honestly what I thought was gonna happen when I watched and tbh I'm a little disappointed

You make some good points, Job.

Definitely scream. I wouldn‚Äôt want Jason, that lawsuit seems ridiculous.
---
Looking forward to get puked on by an absolute unit
---
Steve for survivor and the end for the map 
---
Quite something to pick up on. Is pretty weird for leigon and spirit to be at the bottom but not this killer.
---
This system is going to really push meta perks(survivor and killer), Meta Killers, and addons.
---
best timeline.
---
It‚Äôs over I believe. It was certainly a trip. 
---
Not like a game has used gory executions as a selling point before or anything...
---
Honestly, I really like it. You have to nearly double pip to rank up in reds. 
---
It‚Äôs hard as shit and actually makes me feel accomplished when I do get a pip. 
---
I would not be devastated if they toned it back a *little* bit I suppose, but I think I like the idea of it getting progressively harder.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be a good time without sketchy tacos and cheap wings 
---
We have been doing this for a long time now, here we are 6 months ago. Cheers Reddit. https://clips.twitch.tv/AuspiciousBigFlyKeepo
---
With this killer and Legion, I personally feel like they're trying to stuff too many mechanics into one killer, and in the end it just makes for an overall, underwhelming killer due to it.
---
Does anyone know what she is saying/what language she's speaking?
---
I AM SO FUCKING HYPED FOR THIS CHAPTER, PLEASE DEVS RELEASE IT ASAP I WANT THIS SO BAD THE KILLER AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CHAPTER IS THIIIIIIIIIIIICK! 
---
I once got 4 infinite loading screens in one day
---
I just finished a match in the red ranks and kept a tally:
---
2.8 gens  
---
1 dull totem  
---
1 small 10s chase and escape  
---
1 unhook  
---
3 full teammate heals  
---
1 exit gate open
---
[And I barely got 1 pip](https://imgur.com/a/oOYp7Iv). Kinda rough.  
---
David and Jake better be next to get new outfits.
---
Let's nerf an already weak perk... like what?
---
Yeah fair enough :/
---
I try to be a nice killer, only time I‚Äôd camp is if it‚Äôs last hook gates open lol 
---
Google
---
There should be no stronger penalty. Anyone who wants a stronger penalty "camping" wants free wins.
---
Killers may camp because they want to ruin your game or they may camp because they may have seen a survivor nearby to rescue them. Or because it's the end of the game and the doors are open so they want to secure the last kill.
---
There are justifiable reasons for killers to stay near a hook. You can't punish killers who stay near a hook without punishing the ones who do it for a good reason. Killers shouldn't have to decide between stopping a rescue or bloodpoints.
---
Every tier is relevant, otherwise there wouldn't be 3.
---
Yeah, it's probably been a little over-nerfed to be honest.
---
Honestly it's better to just tank it as Killer. Even without Enduring I downed them again in less than 15 seconds. 3 seconds really don't get you very far unless you go down at a loop.
---
I wrote in the ptb feedback that it should be increased to 4%,but I doubt the dev's will even consider it.
---
By the time they puke all over you that much they probably could've downed you with 2 hits anyway. Just try to juke them if they do that, break line of sight or try to 360 them while they puke.
---
yes dont worry the next year will be a licensed killers year
---
Ok
---
lol I love you
---
If the killer is camping just do gens and dont try to unhook
---
If only it was cheap/easy to get these licensed killers. Jason will likely never happen due to the cluster fuck that the licensing of him is now. Trapper more or less fills the gap of Jason. Scream is more or less Legion I feel specially considering the perks Legion came with closely resemble some of the communities ideas for Ghost Faces perks. I'm happy to keep having unique BHVR killers as they aren't kept from making new cosmetics for them and aside from a few examples most *iconic* killers are just a psycho with a knife which to say the least is boring in this game as we have so many killers already meet this standard. Personally I'd love for them to create more supernatural killers (ex: nurse, spirit, Wraith) but I'm definitely in favor of completing the collection of horror icons.
---
Instant heal is optional to bring in so it doesn't really factor in unless your in that specific situation when a survivor actually beings said instant heal. 
---
It does mean it starts working at one gen instead of two. Also apparently McLean said it will gain two tokens from the final gen being completed but is bugged in PTB at the moment. 
---
It should really be 4, they didn't need to nerf the amount of stun
---
Alien? Would be interesting to see what they do.
---
Would love Scream with a huge suburban house indoor map. 
---
I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fun for anyone, and like I said I‚Äôm playing in solo queue so it makes everything worse. 
---
The first person you get you‚Äôre gonna camp them to death in a game full of randoms? Tell me... is it fun to just stand there? Why even turn on the game if you aren‚Äôt going to play?
---
I dont think its overpowered./
---
Any way to take longer to pip is okay by me . I literally tried nothing and just played normally and not competitively and I would get the most BP and double pip and I barely did a gen or was in a chase .pretty easy to pip as long as you do anything right now.  
---
They aren‚Äôt in order anymore
---
Pretty sure the example you're looking for is "Spirit". People thought Spirit was weak.
---
They should just make the pallet and gen breaking speed a non-stackable value and buff the numbers
---
This patch literally just came out on PTB, not even live lol. It's very much so still fresh and worth talking about.
---
But killers got a bunch of perk ~~tier 1/2 tweaks~~ buffs and survivors got a huge nerf and solo q and 4 ds swf is unplayable now, its just not fair!
---
**/s**
---
He can ignore chase mechanics at the measly cost of needing 3 whipes instead of 2. He is just poorly designed. The devs noticed he was broken and reduced the impact of his attacks. It dosent fix an inherently broken killer.
---
*Laughs in OCD*
---
They literally invented ebola in the game
---
Years of waiting in the locker for a killer to actually bother looking so he can finally use Head On takes it toll.
---
Clearly you didn‚Äôt read what I said. I said pre-powered exit gates... as in, camping before all the gens are done.
---
In the end game idc, do what you gotta do to secure the kill.
---
I hate him too lmao
---
Yeah she is actually way taller than I thought she was gonna be
