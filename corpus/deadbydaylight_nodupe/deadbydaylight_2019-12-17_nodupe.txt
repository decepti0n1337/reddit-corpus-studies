He just got nerfed.
---
If we can have infinite no cool down Hilly billy we can have Freddy.
---
There’s so many times I’ll sacrifice getting hooked just so I can finish getting the last gen done - even if killer is approaching I stay committed (and outta that I’m the only one doing the last gen). And 98% of the time it’s for nothing - my teammates just always leave me. I should prob bring deliverance cause dying at that point on your first hook sucks. :(
---
All it does is give the Obsession a 32 metre standard terror radius. No effects are applied or “killer specific” terror radius sounds are played.
---
Did somebody say nerf???
---
I mean he's still faster while in a loop but whatever, I guess having a 360 killzone is fun
---
I’m more annoyed that I have to keep activating each challenge, just make every challenge doable without selecting it first.
---
i actually thought this was just a picture taken of evil within. Great job on the accuracy
---
Otz gang is mean :(
---
Most “new” killers are just hybrids now, which is fair enough they are running out of power ideas.
---
[removed]
---
He tried to be toxic and failed...lol
---
That sucks damn.
---
I'm the 6 gens.
---
They either run or they are self-caring
---
In reality the totem gets cleansed and two gens pop in the first minute and a half.
---
I know right, you ever remember a challenge word for word mid-game and you’re like.. easy peasy but then remember you have to select it first.
---
To be fair, if that's made of gold it would be more malleable than most metals and Adris is one tall queen; she could potentially do some damage smackinb that chandelier of hers into that.
---
However I always just took it as damage, since the temple is in ruins.
---
Ace in the Hole, Pharmacy, Unbreakable, Borrowed Time got my Yui to level 50 pretty quick, even at red ranks
---
Amazing
---
Thanks a bunch, I’ll keep all of this in consideration when I do decide to play him cause I feel like imma get buttfucked if I don’t 100% know what I’m doing but that’s dbd so I’ll be g,  appreciate it
---
tbf in a real entity's trial you wouldn't be able to interact with some other survivors like Feng Min.
---
* Claudette Morel: "Hey, as long as we repair this generator together, the killer won't get to us in time."
---
* Feng Min: "你在说什么?"
---
No wonder this game has so many issues that take forever to get fixed, everyone is working on a shit mobile version.. go figure
---
As per title. Haven't touched it on PS4 since before the Archives went live, jumped on tonight and it won't let me select the killer challenges. Pretty pissed as I had a similar issue in Steam where it stopped letting me select Killer challenges about halfway through the first Tome, hoping its nothing similar as the response to raising that issue on Steam was "we'll look into it at some point"...
---
The world is called “entity’s realm” it has a ton of dbd avatars

The demogorgon is terrifying to face, at least for me. But his portals definitely aren't as good as the hag and trapper traps.
---
I’ve gotten Facecamped for being “sweaty”. 
---
It’s not my fault I was able to loop you around for FOUR whole Gens. This person was a Hag on Lery’s Institute and couldn’t catch me for four whole Gens. So obviously, because I had more skill/game knowledge to keep me alive, they deemed me as “sweaty and toxic” and decided to Facecamp me all the way to Death-Hook, and then taunt me post game because *”they killed me, so therefore I win :)”*
---
I got to play the Game for about 8 minutes before the Killer decided to hard-delete me from the game. That’s what sours my mood about the game, and Rank Reset makes it worse. I usually balance out around Rank 2-3, so me facing all of these Rank 12 Killers, Looping and dodging them, and then being camped because I’m good at the game is such an annoying cycle.
---
I dunno, I feel like counting as 2 gens would be overpowered. In my mind the backup gen is supposed to be in case of emergency or if the survivors are feeling greedy. I could boost the extra bloodpoints to 100% but I don't want to make it override regular gens in terms of usefulness since they are literally the main objective of the entire game.
---
Thank you for all that information
---
When u prefer regressing gens instead of killing people in a 3 gen situation
---
Thank you kind sir! Haha now i'm just waiting for someone to go "Well ackshully...." Typed the scrawny nerd furiously, wiping the sweat from his forehead, for he has just returned from his journey upstairs to mother's kitchen to raid the draining supply of Doritos.
---
The body blocker. I'm not gonna face camp an innocent survivor.
---
Thank you very much
---
It feels kinda like BFV. I have like 75 assignments and you can only have 4 equipped at a time, and you have to go back to the main menu to change. It's been a major complaint for that community, and I feel this is much the same. It's a bit pointless.
---
Yeah if you're gonna tap, do it right.
---
Repair until +30-40ish BP. Constantly tapping gets you nowhere.
---
Thank you for this info
---
I need to ask, you've never played solo survivor have you?
---
I do main survivor but I play a tad bit of killer rn, and most survivors are never happy with a strong killer. Rn only two killers don’t require survivor mistakes to destroy, and that’s nurse and spirt. Lol
---
Joestar or Byers?
---
I’m sorry, you said they’re “pretty shit” and I have to disagree and say they *incredibly* shit
---
He can’t teleport to completed gens lol
---
it worded a little oddly but you get a 3% buff per other person still alive so its a 9% buff, with that said luck still needs a buff. or the perk in general.
---
By someone you must of mean a quarter of this sub. Show your opinion on anything someone doesn’t believe In and they call you full of shit or a liar like it wasn’t just only my opinion I stated. 
---
Like I’ve had a couple people call me out for being a dumbass for having a nerf legion tag, it’s ironic I’m a legion main, so who’s really the dumbass; but I don’t say anything and I hold my peace. A lot of ppl on this sub should learn to do the same and it would be so much less toxic of a community.
---
plague was pretty unique
---
The killer only finds you since every is hiding, looking for Ruin, so nobody is doing gens 90% of the time
---
kay....1am here; sleeping alone. Fml, i need my cat besides me now.
---
David for we're gonna live forever, it's great for farming blood points
---
Huntress and GhostFace take the top spots by a lot Ghost Face with 7 and Hunter right above him with 8 but most of Huntress comes from PC and Ghost Face seems to have the highest average play time considering he had 4 on console and 3 on PC
---
The chance we get a new mode is astronomically small. The chance of it releasing w/o major bugs is even less.
---
Does it pair well with any offering or other perks?
---
When you mori me, can you please use the flathead? ;)
---
the game literally went 'oh shit nvm'
---
kindred and borrowed time for unhooks
---
If you think solo survivor is worse than hell, then you're bad at the game. Simple.
---
Could be in the way of who could hunt 8 survivors faster. All in the same map too. A point for each survivor sacrificed.
---
Alrighty thanks!
---
Reported.
---
Enjoy your ban
---
Lately this has been the case, and I find myself lost at to what killer to play because I’m getting so many games. A good problem to have. Too bad no friends for that sweet swf
---
Totems have a list of predetermined locations where they can spawn. That means some bastard at bhvr picked this wide open place and said "yes, this is good"
---
For anyone wondering the original comment said something like "you wouldn't be able to see anything because you're oblivious in lockers". 
---
Essentially they thought op meant see the aura and not the actual person being chased for some reason.
---
#Oh hey, Evan, fancy seeing you here. How's the family?
---
So would they have to make bigger maps? I think it would be too chaotic and absurd if they reused the same ones.
---
Right, I get that. This is in every map, there’s always a couple totems that are kinda in the middle of place
---
Enjoy your ban.
---
Holy shit dude, that's actually one of the most  impressive things I've seen on this sub. I somehow manage to fuck up trying to SB to my teammate for a flashlight save.
---
Solo survivor is still stronger than killer lmao
---
Oof she's invincible again!
---
I kinda like it tbh but how would it work if 1 or 3 hits is landed, will survivor go into injured state? I was thinking 1 -2 survivor is injured, 3 the survivor gets injured +deepwound or maybe mangled.
---
I’ve had it happen a few times. Seen it happen to streamers in rank one as well. Lol I’ve had more 4DC situations because I was playing plague or someone and their friends rage quit when I downed them. It’s annoying cause it’s always resulting in me losing rank.
---
*cries in Mettle of Man*
---
The totem is a cool idea giving the killer the option to get back their hex totom.
---
Though I think for balance when it brings back a totem it should make it spawn I a different location.
---
Yea, this whole “experiment” was to see the difference in styles between console and pc players as I play both.    The huntress part doesn’t surprise me, but their is more killers played on console. I could do better to play the equal amount of games on both platforms and try to get the same rank on each because on pc I’m rank 2 and ps4 I’m rank 6 so that could be why 🤷🏻‍♂️, but I am somewhat suprised that ghostface has the highest playtime across both.
---
Solo survivor is still stronger than killer
---
That’s 1500 points in the boldness category u can bet on me doin that shit
---
After nerf you won’t get 4K If you play Against a good team , just don’t play her, use spirit she’s the best killer right now
---
Uh, why not? Lolita clothing style is a thing.
---
Yeah we would need bigger maps. It would be cool to maybe combine some maps, kind of a blending of assets. But only if they made it look good and well blended.
---
Face-Camping by my definition is when you get hooked, and then the Killer sits there *directly* in your face. Usually nodding/smacking you and being a jerk to get ‘revenge’ for something you did, or because you clowned them at a Loop for several Gens.
---
Gideon meat plant and asylum would be great
---
Personally not into the whole Lolita thing, and a lot of people who I’ve ran into who are into Lolita style anything are usually very disgusting individuals
---
Two things you are right about, first, i am using the term “camping” broadly. Because i do not know any other term for “always circling close to the hook “. In my eyes, there is little difference. I think many killers take advantage of those nuances and claim that they dont camp. I call it bullshit.
---
I play killer from time to time, usually somewhere between 10-15. I dont care about ranking above 10 as a killer, but my experience as a gamer tells me i would have if i tried. And while at that, I can find dozens of excuses for camping, but in the end i prefer not to, because i find it incredibly lame. I have issues with it. Not only camping, but campers as well :) and that is the second thing you were right about, i take this personally. 
---
That being said, i am a rank 3 survivor and have been rank 1.  Appreciate your assumptions. but I do not need to give anything a break, well i do, but it is mostly bc i feel burned out by playing the game a lot these days, not for the other reasons you mentioned.
---
Btw , i am taking back my apology considering you really took telling me what to do to another level lol.
---
The game is still full of bugs.
---
First of all, ppl are saying the sneak around to rank up because of your initial statement. Considering this is the internet and the person you responded to about the 4k giving a pip could have been serious there’s no reason to believe you weren’t potentially being serious. I get you keep claiming it wasn’t you being serious. Ppl responded to the other person with justifications for why they’re wrong. Agree or disagree all you want, ppl were explaining why your initial statement isn’t justified and you’re changed your position after the fact.
---
I think hes a little slept on. My first like 15 games on him were rough but once you learn the maps and portal placement he can generate insane pressure. That and he can 3 gen even when the placements kinda shitty. If you want to be a bit of a dick too basement gorgon is a nightmare with territorial.
---
I always assume at least one of my teammates is looking for the totem. As a solo player, working on gens is the best bet.
---
IKR!
---
Well not my problem you have a dirty mind. Guess your name means you are a disgusting and judgmental old hag. Be on your way.
---
Fuck it. You win. All I wanted to do was have a fair and equal balance on the situation. Can't have it all it seems.
---
That moment when either one of your teammates is a god or you're about to be jumpscared to death.
---
The majority of my 750 hours are killer and have 0 salty comments on my profile. I get the rare post game salt, but never a profile comment.
---
1 hit wouldn’t put them into the injure state but possibly give them deep wounds. 2 would be injured state, 3 wouldn’t do anything other than give you stacks and 4 would be a down plus a fourth stack. Their would be a counter showing you how many hits you’ve landed on them and how close they are to going down.
---
There is nothing such as an innocent survivor ;)
---
Whoa there friendo, don’t know what crawled on your lap and died but maybe tone your attitude down in the future when literally nothing was said about or to you in a negative way LOL
---
The man she cut her toe off god instead of curing him decided that he should become the equivalent to an ancient hulk like creature
---
You probably accidentally qued up, nothing more to it.
---
Imagine not being able to detect obvious sarcasm through use of a meme. EVEN WHEN THERE IS AN EDIT WRITTEN DIRECTLY UNDER THE COMMENT. Ffs, I dont know how many times I have to write out the exact same shit, and make the exact same point, over and over before you'll get it. 
---
I didnt change my position after the fact wtf? My position has been the same the entire time. Do you even read comments? The edit was made to my initial comment BEFORE any replies. Please make sure to read comments before replying to them, honestly...
---
I've notice if you start searching, cancel it, but stay in the lobby it continues to search for a match anyway because..... reasons.
---
How i was at the front page and just left it there?
---
He didn't play this match as well as he could, end of story.
---
*me with 15fps*: ruin? ok, this might take a while
---
*gets skillcheck every 5 seconds, literally regressing the generator*
---
me: 'aight imma head out
---
That’s so dumb idky it wouldve done that
---
Nah, don't think I will. People like you who like to generalize groups of people are the worse. I don't care what anyone else does as long as they are happy and it doesn't impact anyone else. Perhaps don't come at someone negatively to begin with if you don't want to be met with the same attitude.
---
Survivor dailys are considered harder, but I never need to delete them. They just might take a bit to finnish. If I get a sacrifice daily for a killer I dont play like Wraith that's an instant nope. Not gonna bother.
---
Bond, if you play alone and with random people
---
I like lithe from fengs teachables. It's like a sprint burst when you vault.
---
r/dbdgonewild = Fuck Me
---
Is that a Dwight perk? I might look into it
---
^^K W I S P Y^^
---
True. But I also don’t complain about my ranking as a survivor. I don’t care if I escape or survive on survivor. In part because I feel boosted on survivor because even if I potato I can still rank up and escape because the other 3 might be really good. I know the I’m only 1/4 of the team and I literally don’t have to try very hard and I’ll likely get out. Whereas killer I have to outplay 4 people, and in red ranks there’s almost always 1 person that’s better than me. I actually have to earn my rank as a killer. If I’m a bad killer I’m going to de rank, if I’m a bad survivor I at least have some buffer to stay at rank or rank up because of other better players. Not just that, but killers have to occasionally go against people trying hard in groups, and considering the game is based around casual solo play that strongly favors survivors.
---
My experience as killer/survivor and my rank on there is the same as everyone else. Killers are solo and have to be good. Survivors can be potatoes and still climb ranks because of someone else’s hard work.
---
He definitely has an overloaded kit, but idk about overpowered.
---
More importantly, I wonder if they went inside a locker to type that out.
---
Bro........ It's Doomfist.....
---
I like running green keys to bait out a Franklin's if thr killer runs it, ive already won
---
Denying a pallet break with it is funny
---
They aren't running out of ideas, no, they just don't want to design new game mechanics which would be harder and cost more (this is also why we see bandaids all over the place and the sound is always broken)
---
*laughs in Spirit Fury, Enduring, Brutal Strength, and Fire Up*

You do you friend. It affects my life in no meaningful way.

I have the PC Microsoft game pass version of the game and there is no way to buy Feddy in game. Is this the same for everyone? Can you just not get this DLC on the Microsoft store version?

Funny because when I got my first 2k shards I bought it on the blood web shop thing lol I think it’s pretty good, does it work well with sprint burst and balanced landing?
---
The real question is what's *written* on it.  We need someone who can read cuneiform stat.
---
4 hits or 1 makes no sense, since survivors are basically stuck in his range once his ability is active.
---
Also it's a chainsaw, not a knife, 4 hits doesn't make much sense to the weapon
---
Hey, dude? The term "lolita" comes from a book about a pedophile. The term is/was a pet name the guy bestowed upon the child he obsessed over/took advantage of. Then weirdos took the term and started using it for a type of fashion where people dress like little girls.
---
Stop being a dick to /u/Probably_A_Mother for being justifiably weirded out by your name.
---
Imagine not being able to detect obvious sarcasm through a meme you didn't post, responding to people that were not meming in their responses.
---
yes it is. prove thyself is another good perk of his if you tend to two-man gens often
---
Maybe have it so you and four other friends queue up as a team and one person would be a killer and the four would be the survivors the other killer would hunt the survivors on your team. The survivors would be able to disable the killer perks by destroying totems but survivors could rebuild the totems to reactivate the killers perks. I just thought of this now so I don’t expect to be flawless.
---
I just want insidious to allow killers to stalk by standing still, and when it's fully stalked you become undetectable for X seconds on activation
---
Haha , i sincerely hope that it doesnt :)
---
I really can’t wait for the day people stop pretending solo survivor is the worst thing ever. It really isn’t.
---
This is reddit not post game chat
---
I've never seen people say the original "press space to instantly finish a generator" BNP was balanced until now lol
---
Thank you!
---
Nice
---
If walking speed is an issue then run Fixated with it. That's what I do.
---
I know when repairing a generator, when the meter is either red or gold/yellow your progress is either being slowed down or increased. But I can't seem to nail down a pattern regarding the difference between the two colors. I assumed red means you're being slowed down, but when I see red shouldn't there be a killer perk in the HUD indicating what's slowing me down (thanataphobia, dying light, etc...)?
---
He did pretty good and ended up with the 4k but nurses and noed on plague? You cant heal and cleansing doesn't work on nurses and noed is unnecessary except for the speed boost
---
So now you're taking the position that I didnt even post my initial comment? Just making the argument that it's not even there? Okay mate, whatever helps you.
---
No, they changed it so it actually works about everybody. On the other hand, aura reading doesn't work against Undetectable, so if let's say somebody has OoO but you are shrouded Ghost Face, T1 Myers, crouching Pig or cloaked Wraith, you'll see OoO's user aura but they won't see yours while you have Undetectable status
---
Thanks god these ideas are not implemented into the game. These are clearly in the Killers' favor.
---
Oh shut up. Did you even read the book? The name "lolita" is short for the name Dolores. Should I be disgusted by every person named Dolores too? Maybe you should mind your own business and stop being a cunt to other people when you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Blocked.
---
Her minotaur.
---
Imagine being this bitter about someone making a clutch save lmao
---
Doctor with noed, blood warden, agitation and BBQ and Chilli.
---
Yeah, I read the book. That's why I'm telling you this stuff, so you know why people are going to judge you for your name. "Lolita" is not short for Delores. It's specifically a name he makes up for the girl. You'd know that if you actually read the book.
---
Calm down, dude.
---
The first thing I do as a killer is checking my totem after the Survivors get the message that I have Devour Hope. But yeah, you're still right
---
ok here's a hypothetical: i down all four people at the same time, within 3 minutes of the game starting. by your reasoning, the correct thing to do - the way the game wants me to play - is i should let someone wiggle off and reset the whole game.
---
that's absurd.

Noed, I guess but nurses no, the plague must have been good killer to get an 4k.
---
Why does it look like Ghostface just got kicked in the nuts?
---
np! meg also has adrenaline which is amazing, and jake has iron will. Bill has borrowed time.
---
Me and my friends rushed hook since we don't like fighting plague since it was the 3rd straight but she did have a comeback
---
i would like this if it wasn't at funny number
---
It is proudly mine.
---
Youve got a fair point its just that 3 people dc'ed after the new ban thing when you dc. I just count dcs as kills cause i still get points for it
---
The game is pretty bad tbh. The sheer amount of info the game gives you can really mess everything up. The game basicly shows you the direction the huntress is even from outside her terror radius because of her humming. Survivors simply running also exactly alerts you to the direction they are. Iron Will is a must since being injured is the same as a death sentence. Yet so many survivors just hide behind a rock thinking they are safe. The sheer amount of people who try to unhook themselves is insane over there lol.
---
I count dcs as kills
---
Yup, oblivious get rid of terror radius
---
Thank you all for your kind comments everyone! I never would’ve thought this post would blow up as much as it did. You guys are awesome and you made this little rank 5 Meg main very happy! :)
---
Yeah it’s way easier to take advantage if these mechanics as killer than survivor
---
No, lithe shouldnt be used alongside any of those perks. They are all exhaustion perks and will share the same cooldown.
---
And thank the lag for covering up your huge mistake
---
Dang didn’t know about that thank you
---
Atleast you got on a gen, even though he will go after you soon after the guy dies or the video ends - meanwhile the random broski vaulting repeatedly instead of being useful
---
great minds think alike, i only play steve with that exact outfit.
---
Mtly regular build is normally Resilience, WGLF, Balanced Landing and Iron Will! I run spine chill from time to time in place of WGLF, but in general I don't usually run it haha.
---
He didn’t actually go for me 😂. He only tried to go for me when a blendette also got on the gen and blew it up but he messed up a chainsawed right into the gen so I was able to save the nea...but then the bubba tunneled her :(
---
Agreed hopefully they hurry and put dedicated on consoles so we have dc punishment
---
NOED is pretty solid on plague, but Nurse’s shouldn’t be there
---
Bruh sooo funny I haven’t seen this like a 10000 times already in this sub
---
https://youtu.be/ukXkAz7MBdk
---
That's you... that's what you sound like
---
The thing that annoys me is the fact that THE COLORS FOR THE DIAGRAMS DON'T MATCH
---
How about this...
---
The new yamoka map with darker lighting
---
4 p3 claudettes with bond,  urban evasion, iron will, diversion (but diversion is buffed to auto recharge every 30 seconds) 
---
The Claudettes all have to use pebble to try and get each other killed. Last one alive gets points and a chance at the hatch. Game would have to have a time limit so that it doesn’t go on forever.
---
He must be memeing around then
---
I mean, it does have uses outside of cowardice, one really good example is using it to dodge bbq and chili if you're next to a mostly competed gen. Not only can you avoid the killer starting a chase with you right away, but you can also avoid all gen progress being reversed by pop, and maybe even finish the gen before the killer mozys over during a patrol
---
Gen-rushing isn't bullying nor is it toxic.
---
No we didnt no teabagging etc it was just a huntress she missed axes and hooked 2 guys twice others non because tunneling but by destroyed as in she tunnelled camped and lost then DCed when we are running to the exit gates
---
Thankfully forever freddy was nerfed. There was no good reason him to have gen slowdown. It was a relic of old freddy. I still dont think he needs swing chains.
---
That said his powers are fine. Traps, pallets, teleport.
---
I dont think he needs the lullaby though. It makes sense in huntress because she’s slow and its 45m. A 32m non-directional lullaby on a 115% speed killer is a little overkill
---
Just use a map lmao
---
Yeah that’s literally it though haha

Wait..

A wrathful Samurai?

&gt;"Just as long as escaping should automatically give a pip. Change my mind."

A meme, a joke, a direct parody of the comment I was replying to.

Once again, this edit was made BEFORE (and I will repeat, BEFORE) any replies had been made to my comment. So it IS my initial position, I didn't backpedal.
---
&gt;"Considering none of what you said in this initial statement says that you should only get a black pip for escaping, you're saying different things now. You only say you agree that you shouldn't lose rank for getting a 4k or escaping."

Once again, did you even read the comment?
---
&gt;"none of what you said in this initial statement says that you should only get a black pip for escaping"
---
Oh really? How about: 
---
&gt;"You should never depip for a 4K or escape." 
---
Seriously, please read the comments. 
---
Do you even know what a black pip is? You dont derank if you get black pips. 
---
I'm not saying different things now. I've kept the same position the entire conversation. From the initial post to now. You just seemingly cant read comments before you reply to them.

Sad part is, I think I was at least in purple ranks at that point

Perhaps therapy will be of use to you. Must be horrible to live your life with thoughts you can't control.
---
This is 100% outdated
---
The former would be burnt too, as a matter of fact.
---
He's a precious boy and he deserves treats, even if that means eating survivors.
---
I’ve affected you.
---
I like it. I feel like Dark Sense is sometimes underrated, but as primarily a gen jockey it’s awesome to finish a gen and get a quick look at the killer to see which direction I should head to do the next one. I usually do Kindred and Dark Sense but also Lithe and Quick and Quiet to get away fast if I do happen to run into the killer.
---
100%. Generslly I run either those perks, or I run Bamboozle, Hangmans Choice. Depends on what survivors bring into the match
---
Well even if they didnt, 1) they should be able to READ THE EDIT that clarifies my position. And 2) read the other dozen comments thst clarify my position. I've blatantly told you, again and again and again, what my position is, and for some reason you still cant accept that you misread comments and that my initial and subsequent comments confirm my position.
---
&gt;the edit doesn't imply what you make it sound like it does.
---
What do you mean? It literally states my position. 
---
Surviving is the objective of a survivor. If you depip for completeing the objective of the game then the system is inherently flawed.
---
I would never block you.  You are the source of too much unintended entertainment
---
&lt;:^|
---
While Nurse's is a bit weird, NOED isn't too out of character. It can be overkill but the extra movement speed and instadown potential can work, especially if the survivors aren't broken.

Don't listen to this guy, Nurse is fine. The nerf they did won't change a thing for good Nurses.

My brain would explode

Exactly.

wait but theres 3 holes.... holy shit janes a trap

Is the disconnect penalties on and if they are, how long are the penalties?

I'm in rank 18 right now as a new killer and honestly thought this was normal until your comment lol

( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)

That's literally- honestly I'm not even gonna bother with your dumbass
---
Shockwaves of my relevance ripple the serene waters of your personhood.
---
Ah ok. Very good idea. I will give what you do a try. Thank you.
---
Right?! It would be a literal game changer! Just imagine the salt then lol.
---
Depends on your RNG and ability to hit great skill checks. As much as I hate gen tapping it can be faster if you keep constantly getting skill checks and messing them up.
---
Lol i paid like 100$ for every legion skin before the first nerf. Haven’t played since. F in chat for my wallet yo. No regrets susie is cute af
---
The double stun...making noise for the killer to force to use the locker, so the survivor hits the decisive, then enter again the locker and use head on...these survivors are the ones whl throw the game just using the decisive early and forcing other survivors to go to rescue instead of doing gens...
---
Though that's not what makes a spoiler, I think it's not a big one probably
---
Both of you are dumbasses, you for not knowing how to play the game and the other guy for being a dick
---
Yeah she closed hatch and I was calling to my friends "I bet she has noed" and sure as shit she does
---
Dc everywhere
---
Nah i am a good nurse i am just saying that new nurse sucks for new players and she is really hard to play after nerf so is better to play spirit if you are new cause she is better than nurse after nerf
---
Imagine the whole Legion beating the shit out of each other
---
My personhood, however, is but a puddle, your ripple is insignificant
---
Oof. Rule of thumb is that if they aren't running Ruin, they're likely running NOED.
---
Would the maps have 2 basements?
---
*a n g e r y*
---
BT is still strong. If anything it just got buffed with the Oni patch. 
---
Also Adrenaline and DS are very much meta perks still and so are perks like Unbreakable too. 
---
Some good Off-Meta perks are like Combo pieces like Lithe and Dance With Me, Second Wind, Quick and Quiet with Lightweight, Poised and Distortion or Autodiadact.
---
&gt; blink through pallets
---
Blink through pallets by timing it correctly so they drop it but won't get a stun. Or blink around it. Free hit if a survivor camps a pallet.
---
Stridor is unnecessary if you have a good headset and insidous wastes time.

Oh no she is big mad now 😨

Do you point out every user name that references something you aren't into or familiar with or is it just this one time that compelled you? Pointing out something so irrelevant to the topic and in such an obviously combative way seems so u productive.
---
*Checks post history*
---
Oh my fucking god you have the audacity to generalise u/lolita_queen clothing style when you play degenerate futa furry porn games this is too classic! Maybe you should change your user name to "Provably_A_Furry" so people can point out how much they don't want to reply to you and make generalisations about how disgusting furries are.
---
u/lolita_queen 's quote "not my problem you have a dirty mind" is more apt than even they realise hahaha
---
Delicious delicious hypocrisy.
---
Pissing off the killer is a genuine strategy if you're good at looping, as long as you're polite in chat afterwards
---
Yea people shouldn’t use their items that they have, it isn’t fair
---
I’m sorry, after my next update I’ll fix it :)
---
That seems like it would be a great killer
---
But once again, the point I'm trying to make is it doesn't matter how "infrequent" it might be for some people. Other people might face them nearly every game. No matter how frequent or infrequent it is, it shouldn't be possible for someone to take complete control over who wins and who loses in a game. That in and of itself is bad balancing. The game should be that you win because you know more than the other team, or you're more skilled than the other team. Not that you have reached a certain skill level that makes you untouchable even by some of the best players there is.

Someone posted a pic here where it was a demo wearing an ugly sweater, fake antlers, and lights tangled around the antlers and it was adorable AF
---
**My issue is that NOED isn't rewarding the killer for playing poorly, it's a perk that kicks in if the killer doesn't get a 4k before the last generator is powered (ie; if they don't play PERFECTLY).**
---
**The game itself is balanced around 2k, this is supposed to be BHVR's optimal kill rate, so clearly the killer is not designed or balanced around being able to prevent all 5 generators from completion.**
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Additionally with generator times as they are, an M1 killer going against a survivor with Sprint Burst is not likely to down them before 3 generators are completed since they have to hit them twice, even without any pallets in play (but of course, there are some very safe pallets).
---
Not having an instant-down and not being able to reliably make use of generator slowdown perks (Dying Light requires too many hooks, M1 killers don't reliably keep Thanatophobia up, even Pop Goes the Weasel only works post-hook for one generator that isn't yet completed - and generators only take 33 seconds for a 3-man while you're chasing someone) both because of chase times and the various ways they can be denied means you honestly cannot expect a M1 killer to successfully protect all 5 generators on average.
---
NOED is a symptom of the M1 killer being weak and survivors generally being stronger than them, the sheer distance from being hit and using an exhaustion perk itself is enough for generators to pop behind you (you also took time to find someone) and all it takes is Prove Thyself right at the start for a generator to pop in 20 seconds.
---
Therefore NOED is not a reward for bad killers, NOED is a perk to shore up a weakness in the kit of loopable killers who have no endgame otherwise.
---
You will see bad killers make use of NOED; you will see that Ghostface who got looped for 5 gens because he wouldn't break the pallet who then camps with NOED and slugs for the 4k.
---
**But when what makes a killer is good is either extreme mobility, or an instant-down, and we acknowledge that not having either is what makes Wraith (who is much slower uncloaking than Ghostface is in stealth short of very rare addons) pretty terrible, NOED just** ***is*****; slugging and instant-downs and being tunneled and being farmed off the hook near a killer already have so many counters that even NOED itself shouldn't be a huge hassle given the 20 seconds needed to open a gate, especially since you can break it.**
---
TL;DR (again): NOED provides a killer without an instant-down the ability to compete in a situation that is usually hopeless (chasing someone after the first hit takes longer than is required to open a gate, so you can heal up without fear) even if they didn't screw up (they're not designed to 4k before the generators complete), much like DS provides you with an escape if you encounter circumstances beyond your control (usually getting hook farmed, you won't see much hard-camping at higher ranks due to the ease of depipping if you try it).
---
Do you deserve to lose and be unable to escape the killer because your team didn't play perfectly? Probably yes.
---
Would you LIKE to lose without any chance of a comeback? Probably not.
---
r/shockingDBD
---
Statistics like those are extremely anecdotal, and often times will show nothing for the actual balance of the game since there is a wide variety of factors that are completely ignored.

It is lol, unfortunately

sadly no

Satan, whether real or fictional, is a bad person and wants to do horrible things. His comparison, whether Satan is real or not, makes sense in the context of the joke. You're just trying to turn something into a religious debate so you can hate on someone else's beliefs. That does not belong in this subreddit.

Simply restating your opinion over and over with no actual evidence, counterpoint, or any kind of argumentative additive to the conversation doesn't do anything to further it. You say that he didn't play as well as he could've. I say you shouldn't have to be perfect in every way when the survivors are allowed to make as many mistakes as they have pallets, perks, and even built in-game mechanics. Then you're going to ignore what I present like you already have, and make the same claim. Please try to add something to the conversation instead of just trying to push your own narrative with no backup
---
I'm sure you've already done this but restarting your game?

Lol?

Fucking thank you! Like what was even the point of them starting a conversation about it? If her name was "Furry owo mother", I wouldn't even care, because despite it not being my thing ( I don't understand its appeal) PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO LIKE WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY LIKE. My name comes from a combination of my love for Nabokov's writing and the song from Lana del rey. I don't really do lolita cosplay, but can appreciate it and love when it is done well just like any cosplay.

At least I know there are people like you out there who are not brain dead. Much love.
---
Lesion mains.But i dont think hes op or anything
---
Sadly, yes. This happened to me last night. Even when I was unhooked all I could see was blue which was quite frustrating lol
---
Sounds good for map control but you need to chase well I guess and be good a survivor finding.
---
no thanks, i play killers because i like their character and power. i’ll get spirit eventually but right now i’m interested in nurse.
---
Idk I would like a nerf for him
---
Freddy was a joke. His power was a joke and anything he did was a joke. 4 seconds iirc to hit someone and if you lost them woo you could... See them. Oh but it should be hard to escape, right? No, just find another survivor or fail a skill check. Ah, but you must have some kind of great power when they're asleep right? No again, you would just slow down gens. But still the same amount of skill checks. It was dumb. He was useless. He got reworked for a reason
---
I mean, it's the right track to go down.
---
Luigi is my spirit animal. Namely for the infamous "does nothing but still wins"

---
😂
---
How are chase points calculated in regards to time? For example, if I get +1234 points is there a way to figure out how long that chase was?
---
Ideally, the developers would completely remove the option for a SWF unless you're in a private lobby. Other options include telling the killers that they are going to face a SWF, offering a bloodpoint bonus or some other kind of incentive, or otherwise making it so it's an option to face teams like this.  
---
As to the points you're trying to make, you still fail to offer up any kind of counterpoint besides just saying "Tru3 bad and I don't like him". You can't discredit a source just because you don't like who's saying it. If you go into a discussion with that mentality then you're already contributing nothing.  
---
I will rediscuss the points you keep bringing up, and my opinion on them.  
---
1. No, he did not make more mistakes than they did. If you watch the video and listen to his commentary, you see that he knew exactly what the survivors were going to do yet was still powerless to do anything about it. There's no "mistake" to make here. You're already done before it begins.  
---
2. The build shouldn't matter. If you're forced into playing only one kind of build then there's something fundamentally wrong with the game. It doesn't matter whether you're a killer or a survivor, you should not be forced to run the same build or in that specific case, the same killer every game. This makes the game stale, it makes the game unfun, and it makes the players not want to play the game. You should be able to win with any well thought out build, and any killer. Just like as survivor, as it already is, you should be able to win with any well thought out build.  
---
3. He does not play pig extensively. He does not know the fine intricacies of the killer. But you should not have to. You should be able to win with enough fundamental game knowledge and enough knowledge in the killer in order to use their kit effectively. But the idea that you have to put thousands of hours into a single killer just to have a slight chance to win is disgusting.
---
Hillbilly has map pressure and is an m1 killer unless he happens to catch someone out of position, which against competent survivors is unlikely since he alerts everyone when he is about to use his power. I think this is what people want when they say they should make killers on the level of billy. Map pressure and a power that isnt absolute dog shit. Like yea myers and GF have insta downs, but they are absolute dog shit. Why bring billy down to their level when they could bring those dog shit killers up to his level?
---
Yes, that is what he's called
---
bruh gonna just ignore resilience gamers, huh
---
Did you put yourself in their shoes?
---
Waste of a perk slot.
---
Yes
---
Yes. I play with generator positions in mind, and if I realize that the last 3 gens are around a hooked survivor, we're screwed, ESPECIALLY if it's the basement. It's my fault as a survivor for poorly completing gens and forcing the rest of the team to be stuck in a terrible position for the last generator.
---
Yeah I definitely agree with not *losing* rank for a 4K. 
---
Yeah, I know that doesnt contradict my initial statement, which is why I found it odd that you said I was backpedaling?
---
Yeah well I dont necessarily agree that you should rank up for an escape. Let's say in an extreme example. Where you literally do nothing else, but escape. I dont think you should depip for that. Keeping in mind that I have over 300+ hours as survivor and I've never, ever seen a survivor do literally nothing for the entire game. Very little? Absolutley? Stupid plays that work against the team? You bet. But *nothing* to assist the team? No. 
---
People die early in some games, but that happens to everyone. In which case that's a death, not an escape. So that's irrelevant for this conversation.
---
Well it's true that you cant expect people to know you're joking. But it's a fairly mainstream meme/joke. And I disagree with the last part of:
---
&gt;Especially when you follow up with an edit that tries to clarify upon your statement.
---
The edit should trying to clarify upon my statement should do exactly that. Clarify my position, not convolute it.
---
Look to finish up, cause I think we've gone back and forth more than enough. I dont think that a killer should ever depip for a 4K. I also dont think that a survivor should ever depip for an escape. 
---
As they are the relevant objectives of the game.
---
When it comes to ranking up or pipping, then we should count the existing factors/emblems. But punishing either killers or survivors for performing their objective is a flawed system.
---
I was very close to ignoring the conversation but it didn't seem right and also someone else chimed in so I wanted to even the sides.
---
Bloody *user names* mate. Serious stuff.
---
So, you're spamming then?
---
Pretty sure each console has people like that
---
Lol git good baby survivor
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
You mentioned you're a console player and it's quite a different experience from PC but i see no reason to just give up chasing whoever was at that gen vs wasting time with that perk. 
---
But really, whatever works for you :P
---
No I'm downvoting you because you're a generalizing moron that can't grasp the concept of free second chances. I dodged a single fucking lobby and it was a SWF with a key, a map and 2 toolboxes. Wasnt playing against that. Also who fucking cares about lobby dodging? You can't press "ready" ? Fucking hell.
---
I had a TTV (two-man SWF I think) and their Meg (or whatever, survivor outfits blur, I think it was a Meg).
---
Whatever, I burn a Green Mori mostly just for the meme of having a secret offering, and I actually find the TTV guy first. Meg's in his SWF (we chatted post game) and I'm playing Myers, I down him, and footsteps! Meg yoinks him right off the hook **without Borrowed Time even though I am now EW2**.
---
I down him, try to chase the Meg (didn't wanna mori the dude in like 15 seconds of gameplay not counting the time I was just stalking him) she gets away, hook the TTV instead, find a Claudette, hook her.
---
I literally turn around for BBQ&amp;C scanning and I hear footsteps, Meg runs to the hook, my grab animation starts, fails, I hit Meg, she yoinks Claudette off the hook anyway (Claudette immediately DCs even though I wasn't using the mori on the people getting hook farmed) so I chase Meg, finally catch her - she's the only decent looper - and then proxy the fuck out of her, down her again, and mori her for her crimes.
---
Death to all team-traitors, who hook farms with a secret offering? x:
---
I've developed a build I like for basic solo play, its kindred, unbreakable, decisive strike, and wglf or an exhaustion perk if you're sweaty. 
---
Kindred helps with camping. Unbreakable helps with slugging. Decisive strike helps with tunneling. Wglf helps with BP gain. Exhaustion perks help extend loops.
---
Lol you good haha
---
...it's a skull fuck isn't it
---
Don't use Surge. Demodoggo's shred doesn't pop on hit effects. Use Tremors to scope out what gens Survivors are on or Pop to really slow the game down.
---
I'd buy that shit
---
These are incredible, great job!!!
---
I want that spirit and feng omg
---
Socket swivels are in ~1/6 bloodwebs. Maps are waaay more common if you're P3.
---
Ouch, this speaks to my soul.
---
i- what? yes, that's how the system currently works, **that's the problem**. the killer shouldn't be punished for *doing too well*. i got a 4k, at least let me black pip.
---

---
Lmao I’m weak
---
As a killer main I actually feel bad when I see two people leave and the other two just have to suffer.
---
They might lose due to unfair or circumstantial mechanics.
---
Lag.
---
Camping.
---
Keys.
---
Toolboxes.
---
Certain perks.
---
All can make a difference between winning and losing and they feature 0 counterplay.
---
So killers and survivors are salty about losing to these the same way survivors are butthurt about spirit despite her not being overpowered in any measurable way.
---
The goal is to do the gens, yes. But escaping the trail is the main goal for the survivor/how survivors win, meaning you have to do all of them to escape. You probably won't be able to do them all if the last ones are all right next to each other.
---
Yeah most of the survivor ones this year were for licensed characters so they’ll be cells only. Have to be that way so the license holders can get their cut
---
Myers passive stalking to use Scratched Mirror causes him to move slower than running survivors, making it **literally impossible** to stalk and catch them at the same time. His active stalking makes him move slower yet.
---
He can burn a green addon that lets him move faster than survivors while passive stalking, but only by like 2.5% (and Myers in EW1 only moves 5% faster when not stalking at all regardless).
---
Also he has no meaningful lunge in EW1.
---
It's not busted, EW1 Myers makes every pallet a safe pallet and every mind-game vault not so much, seeing you doesn't mean he can catch you off a gen unless you're hella predictable.
---
Wow, you sure showed him...
---
I agree with you, especially about The Spirit part, but the only thing in your list the survivors I went against dealt with was camping. However, it was 100% their fault. There were always at least 2 of them near me. I either saw them or their scratch marks. Why would I leave?
---

---
Bamboozle nurse is always interesting
---
If you use Halloween 4 or 5 i'm deadass reporting you for a hate crime
---
Just to be clear, by items i mean offerings, items and add-ons.
---
Generally items aren't unfair. powerful items like BNP, insta-heals, ebony moris, iridescent head hatchets, etc. are all items that turn the game too much in the favor of one side though, and those are unfair, especially the killer ones.
---
The pro strats. XD Are you on xbox? Bc I actually love moris. Gimme them all.
---
Mindbreaker and Surge are good on stealth killers, especially Ghost Face or Wraith. Surge less so, but Mindbreaker is good for countering Sprint Burst
---
This exchange is rapidly approaching unproductive territory.
---
Withdraw now or you won’t like the opinions I articulate.
---
take this gold you son of a bitch. this is LITERALLY me.
---
Obviously you can’t counter that but you can mind game with your stain so they have to use it when they normally wouldn’t have if they back track.
---
if your not going to back up your claim then I'm not gonna waste time trying to change your mind
---
Thank you :)
---
The ghost face one is fucking adorable ;-; 🖤
---
Still a little sad when you pop it and cause a insta down for a teammate
---
&gt;  you can teleport into the gate before its opened as nurse?
---
yes
---
It differs a lot. Killer takes half an hour for me and survivors are near instant, that doesn't mean other people don't get quick killer matches and slow survivor matches though
---
Ik I deleted post but I have a replay of the match and he only ran him for that amount of time out of a 20 minuteish game. The rest of match he was just walking around and unhoking ppl and somewhat repairing gen
---
I figured speed is most important with Wraith, but I suppose you're right. What tracking perk would you choose?
---
It's 80 seconds to do a gen, actually.
---
cause people have different tastes and beliefs whaaaaat crazy right?
---
Yeah, adding to the other guys comment. Old Freddy was absolutely useless, by far the worst killer that has existed in this game.
---
Really, i used a splinter a couple weeks ago and was able to use bubba fine
---
I'm a fan of shorter activation and either duration or speed lately. Also I think sounds are messed up so I've been running Stridor but I still struggle hearing.
---
Nah it’s cool, I have fun regardless
---
*Gets ran for 5 gens* "toxic gen rushers"
---
I don't think the community is rigid, *not exactly,* I think that the community is however greatly split in interests and the devs try to cater to everyone and not just the majority, which is good considering how the "minority" still makes up a lot of DbD's playerbase, so having impartial devs sounds like a good idea in paper, but really, that just limits the players that want something else, so in reality, true impartiality is impossible, and the devs have to aim for what is best for the game. Personally? I think diversity is the way to go. But maybe the devs have other, reasonable arguments to not do so, or not so to the extreme some other games do. 
---
Regardless, I think this game can still cater to everyone, by doing stuff like Overwatch's and many other online games' ranked, public/casual and private matches. Ranked would limit to the more "competitive" side of the game, while "casual" has stuff like wacky killers and weird powers, "private" matches have addons with great game-changing potential (i.e. powerful iridescent addons that aren't nerfed to the ground), and all of this is out of the "competitive" mode where players would only rely on their skill as opposed to playing with RNG and stuff like that. Not saying comp. should be void of *all* rng, but just gamebreaking one, like being able to escape the Pig's and the Trapper's traps in 1 try.
---
If executed properly, the game could appeal to all parties alike, but however this requires a lot of effort that I doubt the game can consistently pull off in its current state. I mean, VFX artists have broken the game with skins once, the netcode had to be rebuilt from scratch, and the game is just now being coded in an "actual" programming language (since up until now, the game has been done in "blueprints", which really is just a fancier word for block-programming/scratching).
---
To be sincere, light adjustments to the UI have proven to cause a lot of bugs (see the 2 killers bug as an example), so the game can't almost definitely handle running different gamemodes, well, at least for ***now.*** This can be a possibility in the future, but I doubt it as of now...
---
And that brings me to my next point:
---
# DbD isn't the only game of its kind anymore.
---
Players who dislike the game will no longer be subject to returning because the game is "one of a kind", many games have been doing the above and have been doing well (Identity V for example), and the time that DbD needs to recover and perfect its gameplay is just... Not there anymore.
---
Players aren't willing to spend another year without another gamemode or proper meta change, the journey has been too long and other games have started popping up. If DbD isn't able to compete, it will have its playerbase go down, and with how currently the matchmaking is, with how many players we have, imagine a number just 10% off that. Queues would literally kill the game.
---
So I think BHVR has to act a bit quicker now and up their game ***fast,*** without breaking it in the process, or otherwise, players will truly start leaving. All of this because of the repetitive content. Well, it's just what I think though, but sadly it isn't a far-fetched idea.
---
Devs truly have to do something to please new and returning audiences, but so far, in the 3 years of the game's life, they haven't cared for maintaining a recurrent playerbase besides the monthly content updates, which aren't always enough (see the whole existence of this post being proof).
---
Just see how many old YTers see the game's newest chapter, play it for a bit, then go. And the cycle repeats.
---
The game is in desperate need of something enticing to keep players, well, playing, because most "big names" in the community are dedicated DbD players, and not really just outsiders who play the game now and there, because to begin with, the game doesn't support that playstyle (see the grindfest BP are).
---
So yeah, I hope for the best but truly hope DbD changes some of its nasty ways.

do just gens and always hide from killer so you don't enter chases.  do not engage in any altruism.  at the end if exit gates are open just let killer kill you

The meg wondering why no gens popped during her 5 minute chase: I'm never fucking helping anyone of these dickheads.

The meg later working on a gen when she see's a survivor somehow get hit twice within 5 seconds: Aight where's the fucking hatch?
---
I mean DS is still kinda busted, it gives you practical invulnrabillity for a whole minute, which is way longer than it needs to be to just be anti tunnel.

*fixed a bug to that allows the pig to place RBTs on survivors

This are amazingly cute!! If you plan to sell I would be very interested!!

So you say it is okay to touch kiddos? Give pedos money so they can sex traffic more kids with your money? Don't feel bad you are supporting their practice cause it is not your hands on the kids but your money getting those hands there a lot easier? Yea you are better than the rest of us. Oopsies.
---
I feel sad when they miss the decisive
---
That art is amazing
---
I want to integrate this into a shitpost, but I figured I'd post on here first to try and get more context.
---
Are Killers seriously "expected" to let the final survivor go just for funsies/because there's "always" a survivor in slasher movies? Or is there another wrinkle to this I'm missing? Cause there are fully 4K/get kills missions in the Archives.
---
Absolutely sick. I thought I was gonna see DS but you didn’t have it. And you got the save. Hell yeah dude
---
A Blendette's Trifecta.
---
And I'll do that but it still ruins the experience. Especially since games take so long to get into and then if you're the one hooked, your game is basically over unless another survivor has a perk to counter, which in my experience is almost never.
---
Love this advice!
---
It's boring enough waiting for a god damn lobby, so not being able to do stuff like that is a major disappointment.
---
*IF IT GLOWS IT GOES*
---
Umm, you walk backwards.
---
Moving on and requeueing.
---
Wait...I've been playing this game for awhile now ,but are you telling me it's actually WORSE to do gens with multiple people on it?
---
Or is it more like "Instead of getting 200%, you're getting 150%. Technically you're slower individually, but still faster as a pair"?
---
You know, that's a good idea.  Hows this? 
---
\-When the ancient totem is destroyed by the killer a new totem is randomly spawned in the trial and imbued with the power of a destroyed Hex.
---
[On this reddit page](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Offerings#Map_Modifications) it shows all the offerings. If you scroll down to Realm Selections there are some more offerings for the maps that are common and uncommon they just had a lower influence and were basically useless. I think they should be added back with the same influence as the rare offerings.
---
There also use to be offerings to make the maps brighter or darker!
---

---
Fuckin’ ganandorf
---
Ok? He's not supposed to be better than both of them. Having a killer that has two powers and is obviously better isn't good. Do you really just want him to be a Michael/Billy? He already has two powers for Christ's sake. Why make both of those as good as what here based on?
---
They sorta clogged up bloodwebs because there were so many, hence why they got rid of them.
---
I wouldn't mind an uncommon "Anywhere but here" map offering though, maybe as a middle ground.
---
DAYZ ENRAGES ME.

I have a love/hate relationship with that game.
---
Very NSFW content here. Came in my pants instantly

How much of a shitter do you have to be to complain about Franklin's? Get out of brown ranks before talking about game balance
---
Do you play killer or survivor?
---
I have a real question why does bill gotta be so loud
---
They are purposely trying to piss you off and they’re winning. Don’t let their shit get to you like this
---
Thank you!!! I was fucking stoked I couldn’t believe it tbh lol!

I forgot how shitty Halloween 4's mask was lol
---
[You reminded me of this](https://youtu.be/RYDCyXkvbQA?t=200)
---
If I’m on death hook and someone is on their first hook I’ll sometimes sacrifice myself by unhooking them and body blocking for them as much as I can. I feel it’s a Nobel sacrifice that warrants songs to be written about my heroics.... or at least that’s what I tell myself in my head.
---
About 30% of the time this just results in the getting farmed since I don’t have BT.
---
If I stop the heal at 99% and you keep chasing me whos the dumb one? Resilience is underrated af
---
Killer is too fun
---
This was me last night. A random Nea came to my rescue twice during the game, and was hooked *last second* by NOED. I went as far as to 99 my door then frantically look for NOED, and found it! But not before the killer found me. So I couldnt break the totem. I sprinted back to my door, opened it and dipped. But damn did I really try.
---
 I got a message after the game calling me a garbage teammate :(
---
Doriyah
---
Not if that person is the first to die. Never risk going back later what you can do now. Might be the difference between someone else living or dying.
---
This almost made me spot out my drink. 😂
---
&gt;abuse such survivor-friendly map design. less window vaults in the hospital map
---
Literally when you look up the official dbd stats Lery's is in the top 3 for killer friendly. Also, window vaults are hardly a real problem if you just out think them. You can easily maneuver through nearby doors and get free hits through windows. This entire rant is completely based on 1 bad match you had and thus you claim it to be "survivors op because windows"
---
The shrubs are hiding it unless your on low graphics
---
99d gates get me killed all the time. If we cant save someone in 3 minutes theyre dead anyway
---
good job!!
---
I've gotten party invites before, but I'm out a headset and haven't gotten a new one. I think for most people they just don't want to deal with other people.
---
Yeah, maybe just making them rarer so overall you'd get as many map offerings as normal but they'd just be different icons.
---
He is G R O O V I N'
---
That was fantastic! Congrats!
---
Okay, I've got an idea. Borrowed Time, Deliverance, Breakdown, and Decisive Strike. Save someone off of a hook, they get away with borrowed time, the next time they hook you, get off with deliverance, the hook is destroyed because of breakdown, and you can d's them if they go after you
---
If I see a Hex I take it out. I always assume the killer is using noed and I want my fucking BP. 
---
Also fuck coming back to it later. I’m usually the one that gets hit by that shit first, so I’d rather take it out before I get taken out.
---
If you are aware of the tiles, windows and pallets that are nearby, you shouldn't have an issue with getting survivors in these tiles.
---
Im full support of 2018's mask, and 4/5 as a meme
---
Or just bypass totem and just repair generator by repeatedly clicking on and off the gen.
---
Definitely a solid plan. Just kinda lame we have to make an anti-camper build lol.
---
I like to hit people to hear Demopup go rawr, but only if theyre the last guy
---
I don’t think you understand how much I want that ghost face.
---
This is why I hate the idea of running totems. 
---
Also why I hate playing survivor. Whenever I see ppl run totems it’s always out in the open and discovered in like 5 seconds. But when I play survivor that shit is in Narnia and I can’t find it for the life of me. Thus I’m just practicing greater skill checks so I can ignore them for the most part.

A competent Oni uses his power when he sees someone, not when he's far away from others.
---
You get your near-guaranteed down and either get info on other survivors with Infectious Fright/M&amp;A combo and down them too or you dont get anyone close to you and hook the guy.
---
jUsT hIdE isn't counterplay to a killer. It's you admitting that there isn't anything you can do to counter the guy so you have to completely avoid any interaction. This argument gets thrown around when people talk about Nurse or Spirit and it's an equally flawed argument there too.
---
Nice but one teensy ensy question where dwight?
---
Yeah when theres 1 survivor left. What you want a 4k that bad because you're selfish? You killer mains are full of shit
---
So if I outplay the survivors, one should get away for free? That doesn’t seem fair to me.
---
I get some of that but at the same time, you get more points overall when survivors get rescued and you get to chase and down them again. I just feel like the developers could implement something that satisfy both parties. Maybe it's just wishful thinking

Console does make a big difference, even pre-nerf console players weren't able to do a proper flick.

Lery’s is very killer sided imo and you shouldn’t be chasing a survivor for 4 gens, you want map pressure as killer

If you're selling, you best bet I got my money for Oni

That’s one of the problems with the game. Too many ways to define a “win”. Some go by pips, some points, others kills/escapes. It’s why we can’t have nice things.

I had a 3 man swf abandon me and key out after I saved two of them from a proxy camping Huntress. I really wish we had some way of knowing who is with who versus solo queue survivors.

Pipping as both sides is a joke. Rank shouldn't be taken that seriously.

So there’s 2 perks that allow you to recover all the way up from the dying state to injured? David’s and bills perk? Can someone explain the difference other than the fact that David’s you can heal to healthy state
---
Some of us like to take a 1 year break to come back and realize the games still trash
---
You're acting like Myers players are lower beings because you don't know how he works. There are other Killers that can one-shot down even easier than Myers. Once again, break line-of-sight to Myers while getting chased very often, unless you know he's been charging a lot and likely is very close to Tier 3. Once he _is_ in T3, you need to play very safely and not make mistakes, which at a low playtime is very difficult to do. You really just need to practice.
---
I've got the 2018 one irl, I would definitely buy it
---
Incorrect.
---
When were farming and you flashlight click and head on me, you really skate on thin ice.
---
Awww! Spirit and Feng are adorable!
---
He big oof’d I don’t know how he didn’t see my scratch
---
It’s up to the discretion of the killer. If he feels like it he will. If he doesn’t he won’t. 
---
Personally, I give batch if you’re team really fell apart and you don’t wiggle, but if you wiggle or if your team sweats on my ass, it’s a hook for you.
---
I'm only getting killer dailies
---
Did you kill her?
---
I had this problem. I fake saved, then he hit the hooked person, and I got the save. They still died tho cos he tunneled and I didn’t have bt. He also ran the opposite way of the door.
---
Nice to know that I'm the first upvote!
---
I’ve always said why don’t they use mask as cosmetics or even his prison suit in the 2007 or 2009 remake and also the Rz mask is hella scary it would be great for dbd

What rank and region are you in? Because I'm definitely not. So much so that I've stopped playing completely till this mess is fixed. Every match has become nothing but a sweatfest with no room for actual fun builds.

Drop brutal for save the best for last, absolutely amazing perk on wraith, makes chases infinitely shorter. And as a side note for wraith, always bring a bone clapper or the coxcombed clapper, makes you hugely unpredictable, and it strengthens stbfl by a very large margin, you can basically half chases with these two

Even if they are are wriggling

I could literally send a pic of this to my dad and have a replica made the next day by him in his woodworking shop.

Somebody had their username as "Totem Breaker" so i switched a perk for haunted grounds &amp; sure enough 30 seconds into the match ive got 2.5 hooks
---
Wraith doesn’t have a map wide bell, he has one where survivors can’t tell distance or direction of the bell anywhere within 24 meters but it’s not map wide
---
Please no uwus. For the love of God. It's a nice picture but why the unironic uwu.
---
That's true. I honestly just go off having a good game. If I'm the killer, I just try to make it fun and exciting. As a survivor, I put helping teammates ahead of gens and play based on the killer. If the killer camps then I'm forced to gen rush and on occasion admit to prolonging a win if the camping was blatant. But if it's a normal killer who just plays to play then I'll go for a little of everything which includes boldness and engaging in chases.
---
Of course it doesnt seem fair to u because youre a killer main🤡. Just like if a survivor out plays you for 5 gens and then u finally get him and u camp him at the end, is that fair? Its not fair if the last guy has a key and all his other teamates are shit? What about broken hit boxes and mori, are those fair? You're crying because one guy escaped 🤡
---
It's the freddy one specifically I think.
---
I'm gonna level with alot of you saying how god awful mobile would be to play etc I without question can confirm I get better frame rates on mobile then on ps4 so it's got that going for it if the game had an option for controller or mkb support natively it would easily replace the console ports for me
---
It really did, the other characters were more iconic imo
---
If I'm close to a hook, I swing twice. If I'm far from the hook, I swing once. If the do the shook after that they get the hook. Also, this all hinges on the dickheadedness of the survivor during the game.
---
we know, you spam here alot
---
Quick question, how do I see if people are within range of my portals?
---
The game is currently kind of buggy about scratch marks. I’ve chased people and followed the scratch marks when they suddenly just... vanish. Not like someone started to walk, they legit just vanish into nothing. I’ve seen some streamers mention the same, so I figure it isn’t just me being that fucking bad.
---
Thought that was johnny for a sec.
---
You don’t have to be a killer main to know how retarded you sound. And I’ve never been looped for five gens, that doesn’t happen in red ranks. Mori’s and keys are both busted. But you just keep spamming your little clown emoji so you can feel better about not having a brain ❤️
---
Now this.
---
Being in this situation, rotating the camera up and seeing his face, would result in the shitting of pants and a one way trip to anywhere but here
---
Jason vorhees
---
Well face camping is worth less points, gives bad emblems and for those kills, some of the most boring games possible.
---
Wow, so little of this is actually meta... This is like a while back when survivors were calling everything from pop goes the weasel to ruin to even hooking in the basement then fucking off “toxic”
---
The portal has to be activated (yellow) not white. To make it activated you have to go trough it. Before it's activated the survivors can't see it, but they can see you do the animation of putting one down. Whenever you "Channel The Abyss" (if you're ontop of a portal or not) if someone is near the activated portal you get killer instinct notifications (Heartbeats) at the portal they're near.
---
Lol the match i had was against a spirit and some numbskull thought it was NOED despite being lit the whole match &amp; kermitted suicide during endgame
---
Man can I buy this Huntress?! My little brother and I main her and she looks so sick!!
---
Exactly, but the survivor still gets penalized. For such boring, unfair gameplay, (with 20 minutes wait times as surv on console) the survivor shouldn't lose a pip. I didn't wait that long in a lobby just to not be able to play and lose a rank because of that.
---
I’ve had problems with dbd for an hour and a half, the game kept crashing and booting me to menu while searing for match. First actual game and someone dc’s while loading. Fml
---
Is that actually modelled on her? They modelled nips but not even the semblance of a booty?
---
I would guess that it can recognize when something is a threat vs isolated easy prey, and acts accordingly.  It also takes Barb to the Upside Down, and she was alone.  Brenner at one point says that six people were taken in total.  
---
We see it kind of come after Joyce but not actually attack her, so it may have been trying to take her, and every other time we see it attack, it's attacking someone who is also fighting back or actively trying to kill it.
---
I had a hallucination work when I was getting looped lol. Guy did an immediate 180 right back to me, that was hilarious.
---
He went back to the house and attacked the Demogorgon with a baseball bat to save a guy he didn't like when he had no idea what the hell was going on.  Don't come for our boy Steve like that lmao
---
Why is the date August 28th 1996 on the Orion’s offering.

This is so awesome! I’m not a streamer but like seeing things like this!
---
Thot hypnitise: When you are the last survivor who is downed, gain the ability to convince the killer to give you the hatch by sucking his dick.
---
Still a good doggo
---
I don’t know if Demi is good or not, but I’m struggling more than I’ve struggled with any other killer, even nurse. Any strategies/tips at all? I think I mostly struggle with portals, if it helps.
---
They ignored all the cliffhangers, got rid of the cast everybody loved and completely rebooted the show (even admitting it was to ‘make the show less white’ lol)
---
They only interact with chat while doing brainless stuff like carrying to hooks and the like. And the survivors don’t care if they die, they can still pip and sowing to keep up the action is more entertaining for the stream than hiding in a bush like a blendette or sitting on a gen avoiding the killer literally all game
---
PGTW, STBFL, Ruin, whatever else you want. Usually BBQ, Franklin's or M&amp;A personally. favorite and most successful build for her. Trap loops and corners of jungle gyms. Trapping at gens is predictable and doesnt help you in a chase. If your traps all get popped, drop whatever you're doing and reset them.
---
To quote a great man:
---
"Why do you have to be mad? Is only game."
---
With older killers it needed to say "Stacks" for addons to stack. Now, if it says "does not stack" it won't stack but others will. Same with survivor addons I think
---
Have you played as Legion or ghostface? Legions feral frenzy after you hit someone activates killer instinct on other survivors in your terror radius. Ghostface when revealed activates killer instinct on whoever revealed you. Heartbeats are the noise that happens, I'll try and find a picture od the visual cue and then edit this with it.

Luck used to increase chest rarities and people abused the luck offerings to get instant ultra rares like keys, which are extremely balanced /s. For good players, skillchecks can actually be more beneficial than otherwise. I would make it have a larger skill check zone.
---
Ate a DS because the guy was a pain in the ass to catch and I had STBFL, so that way I could go for everyone but him

What he said
---
ehhhh, could be better? as a beginner this is about average maybe a bit above average but not far above. keep it up though! may i ask what killer you used?
---
The ***.5*** concerns me
---
Yeah, if your gamepass expires, the games you got with it expire too. You have to keep the subscription active to keep playing.
---
Admittly that’s where it went downhill.
---
Killer queues are instant at high ranks because more people play survivor. Survivor queues can take forever though
---
I mean do you own it or got it from the game pass?
---
If they pick you up and are in a dead zone than you still go down. This is a lot different than being able to end a survivors game 1/3 of the game earlier than normal
---
GP
---
Bubba is so terrible because his chainsaw takes too long to rev and if he cancels it he slows down, unlike Billy. The survivor has the time to go through a window/drop a pallet before you get it going. Myers isn't top tier also because he needs to get out of T1 fast. Ghost face is pretty good but not top tier. Close though because of his stealth and the on hit build. Wraith is imo pretty bad since his decloak takes so long and slows him down so much. Also he can be heard/seen/stunned in cloak so its kinda bad against survivors that are a little aware. Doc isn't good because his shock is unreliable and most of the times doesn't work as it should. Of course you can still do well with all these killers but you won't win like with Nurse, Spirit, Billy or Freddy
---
That's crazy but I dont remember asking
---
/s
---
Maybe he’s/she’s tired of trying to kill someone who has op plot armor.
---
Seriously, wtf was going on back there?!
---
Demo players can be good. We went up against one earlier and he killed our whole group. Maybe its throwing you against inexperienced killers, who knows. But depending on the player (because let's face it any character can be good in the hands of a skilled player) they can have good games or they can have crappy ones. Just because you've been killed once by a Demo doesn't mean every single one is trash. You just haven't come across someone that clicked with the character. Because they can be brutal as hell.
---
A weird carnival creep that had like that creepy skinny body of a new monster type of killer since the demogorgen is the only non human like killer
---
Ok, I gotchya
---
No, it's sexual harrassment and maybe solicitation of a minor.
---
it's still bad; Still really, really fucking bad.
---
I personally hate it when killers do this.
---
No chance of any decent amount of points.
---
Might as well just repair the five generators and leave as quickly as possible so I can stop wasting my time.
---
Where's the fun holding left click for five minutes when you know the killer is AFK in the basement?

These are amazing!

Usually early on you want to get the nost hooks you can. More people on hooks mean less people on gens. I get a lot of salt for trying to get the weakest out of the way but its the best way to play optimally. Dont go out of your way just for them but if you see them injured running around, go for them. Not if they're unhooked as they might have borrowed times (makes them take another hit) or decisive strike (stuns you if they hit the skill check when you pick them up). If you see scratch marks near look around but go back to putting pressure around. You need that as a killer. If they're hurt, they're most likely healing. If someone is on the hook, one of them is saving. Killer is all about that, putting pressure and stalling the game out
---
I down them, give a little left to right head shake a few times. Pick em up, if they don't wiggle, let's go find the hatch. If they wiggle, drop, shake again, pick up. If they wiggle that time, it's straight to the hook. Fuck outta here not accepting my love.

Probably like 5 minutes before posting this.

&gt; Dead hard is the easiest exhaustion perk to counter
---
&gt; Obviously you can’t counter that

👌
---
Good survivors aren’t going to be caught out of position like that where they are injured and being chased in the middle of nowhere. DH is used to save survivors from mistakes and can be used indefinitely throughout the match with, as you said, no counter.
---
I have never seen it, and I don't think I will.  
---
I am honestly not trying to be an asshole, and I don't know why Mr. TheElderGay wanted to be a douche for no reason... But as I said, I just don't think they're good players if they use the Gorgon... Then again, I'm usually level 10 by the first week of a season... Maybe I am too good? I don't know, maybe i am just sick of the game.
---
Stridor is a waste of a perk. Iron will still counters it. Unless you learn her I don't recommend you taking it and even then I don't recommend it since you will get used to it and waste a perk slot. Speed addons are the most important (Zori....) and recharge can be good. I like activation because it makes her feel smoother to me but recharge is better most of the time. Spirit without addons is good too

They should be able to play anyway they want. However, making the game unfun for survivors isn’t in anyone’s best interest. Especially the dev’s as they would like to retain their source of income. That’s why I think camping should have a somewhat substantial consequence.
---
Just played a game of pig and one game who I didn't see the whole game did no gens and let is teammate bleed out just so he could use the hatch peeeeeeek of a garbage temate man....

Ace is 5he most useless survivor change my mind.
---
obama
---
Wow, really hate to make fun of the BLACK woman character and no one else,  Huh?
---
Racist.
---
Hes actually not a demodog hes the original demogorgon. Demodogs are the same race just not the same species, they are similar but also different
---
If they bring a key you’re allowed to bring an ebony mori and vice versa.
---
The character is a terrorizing fear seeking/fear feeding creature that consumes human parts for his own use. How the hell could that correlate to child molestation? And Once again you're making it about the director and not the character. Just because I enjoy his movie ,his character which he created, the film that he created. Does not I'll put it in cap DOES NOT MEAN I SUPPORT HIS ACTIONS OF CHILD MOLESTATION.

Dude, I cannot pay high. Miss every skill check and just run around until I'm dead 😂
---
I just let them go get the hatch if I'm giving em hatch, if I find it first and want them to live I just shut it and go afk. 
---
Forcing them to know I let them have hatch and having them follow some made up no wiggle rule sounds like a pain in the ass
---
I would buy it.
---
The creator said it is based off him touching kids. He said it himself so please get off that high horse and stop trying to mansplain to me that which you know not.
---
Fucking WHAT?
---
Is this a joke?
---
Siren gead as a killer its abillity is it can just grab you and throw you across the map
---
I'm confused on what is going on....ooof
---
Then that's a lot of adreninline being pumped up after resting.
---
Gimme Bing Bong!
---
I hope you wouldnt post something like that here and expect NOT to sell these. I want them allllllllll
---
Calling this post a conversation starter is a joke. It’s genuinely just insulting.
---
I think hag only gets up to 112.5% with the shoe addon, so halfway between 110 and 115
---
If we're talking pips, the emblem system is completely stupid.
---
It happens all the time, Its frustrating for the survivor, But when **I** play killer, every fucking survivor is coordinated, loops well, Does gens quickly, Never makes a wrong call...And I'm here wondering 'Man, I just got out of a survivor match, where the fuck were these guys?'
---
&gt;plays against huntress
---
“I see no down sides”
---
How much?
---
I know I just wanted to add demo in there so it reached more tags lol
---
I found season 2 to be where it got boring tbh
---
Freeze-Tag maybe?
---
When you enter the Dying State, the Entity juts out little claws that grab you and keep you in place. In order to be unfrozen, a Survivor has to pry open the claws for a second, and you’ll immediately be back up, but injured.
---
I’d love any new Gamemode honestly. I’d love a Stealth-related one where Survivors have to sneak around and collect different parts/pieces of a Gen or something.
---
Captain Cutler would be my no. 1 pick for a Scooby Doo killer (the cat people from Zombie Island would be a close second).  His [sonar sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSo04Op8dec) creeped me out pretty good as a kid.
---
I run well make it but if you run farther and farther away I'll bail on your ass especially if we know its safe by someone else getting hit
---
and then the only match you get is a team of survivors friends that make you feel stupid and you stay in the lobby because you know the wait times will be even worse
---
This was what bugged me. I’m all for diversity in a cast, but it was the way white people were portrayed. It seemed like nearly every non African American character had some kind of underlying racism going on, minus the guy with the mixed daughter. It was really damn annoying to me, and took me outta the show on more then one occasion
---
I was joking
---
I agree. I was like wtf uhm okay then
---
Tbh h4 looking kinda fucking lame in a good way.
---
Well yea? Going back for the one dude who is most likely being camped will just end in more downs and less escapes
---
Either adapt to the solo life or play SWF
---
What's rz?
---
Unbreakable is just like ds, it's to counter something. Deliverance is good if you are smart so yes its sweaty and we'll make it is too in used correctly
---
You don't need plunderers.  DH shows chests as well.  I'm going to presume this wasn't always the case.  Obviously it's way better than both small game and plunderers in its current state.
---
Normally my charms sell for $10 each + shipping and tax.
---
The fact that you even brought it up is worrying... No idea if you are serious dude, but I main Claudette and I was waiting for my games...
---
Since the Demogorgon made it in, I'd love to see another monster killer like the xenomorph.
---
The thing is is they're doing it while I'm distracted with another survivor or some other thing, it feels almost perfectly timed cause I'll get a glimpse of someone near and then it's gone. Just gotta play and learn I suppose but thank you so much for your help
---
People's posts are a minute old. Stop removing them.
---
Wraith felt bad. I did three gens and outlasted the others 😂 he gave me the hatch!
---
YES. YES. I LOVE YOU.
---
THIS IS ART MAWMA
---
WHY ARE WE YELLING
---
I agreed with you. But decor/music isn’t really an event. They usually use the word “event” for it anyway though.
---
You're welcome, got anything else to ask feel free to.
---
I don't blame the Meg straight up leaving
---
People need to realize that you're not actually a team when playing solo, just tools for eachother to use
---
Wrong, if you are in a dead zone, ds gives you the opportunity to get out of it with how long the stun is.
---
Or just have a William shatner head (whom the mask is based off of).
---
Because all of it needed nerfed. Survivors are still overly strong but it's not because of perks it because of poor map design and gens being able to get done way to fast
---
The thing about plunderers is that it shows you the chests *all* the time. It also garuntees a better item and faster searching. It's also a good basement finder
---
but locker-kun
---
I agree, u can run watever u want, killers shouldnt beable to see survivors in the pre game lobby tho
---
My nigga Myers gonna stare at me to reach Tier 3

---
"Just have a map with you at all times" - yeah great advice, thanks
---
This is dope af
---
That guy must have felt more than satisfied with the original one he was chasing getting away.
---
I would absolutely buy a Jane in her Red Striped Top/Jeans combo or Scoops Ahoy Steve, or Hospital Gown Myers!
---
It’s not different per platform, it’s different per input device. There are many players playing on PC with a controller and for them, Oni got buffed
---
I used my aura perk to lead another survivor over to a Meg, who proceeded to ignore both of us before walking to a gen and blowing it up immediately. We were *all wounded* and I had planned on a healing party, but she just rang the dinner bell.
---
Dude there is only a couple things that arent meta there like we'll make it and MoM

The picture of the Halloween 4 mask is bad. [It didn't look good](https://coolidge.org/sites/default/files/featured_images/Halloween%204%20new%20site.jpg) but [it wasn't quite as bad](https://i1.wp.com/biffbampop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HALLOWEEN4_TVEDIT_Sep18_big.jpg?resize=1332%2C666&amp;ssl=1) as it is in that image.
---
Of course, Halloween 4 is my 3rd favorite of all the movies, so I might just be biased.
---
Also, that picture of H20 mask hides that mask's [ludicrously curly hair](https://i.4pcdn.org/tv/1540923062631.jpg).
---
https://youtu.be/JnHM50i2fTw Game didnt end until I quit, Killer still could walk around.
---
Lmao shut up salty survivor
---
Fatass would be so fucking funny.
---
CI is better imo for some killers like trapper and hag especially because you can set up around the 4 gens giving you a strong start. Ruin both doesnt do much because skill checks are random and it can be cleansed fast af. And if you hit the skill checks then the perk is even worse.
---
Yeah, imo deranking is very toxic. A lot of people actually get angry when you call out people who do this and try to justify it in many ways.
---
My first game as killer, I went against a very toxic 4 man swf. I had the worst time of my life
---
Imagine being a Quentin main
---
Its lag. Happens to me
---
The point is to be a team, if we didn’t plan on playing as a team someone could just hide in a corner until the hatch spawns or just run bond and go against the other survivors or something. We rushed gens and took hits for her and kept her from getting hooked all game because she was getting tunneled and as soon as someone else needed help she left us so I do blame her. It’s red ranks too where people expect you to play as a team. If I was a rank 15 then i wouldn’t expect much coordination to make sure we all escape
---
I just straight up hook them.
---
Welcome to the club
---
Chance The Rapper?
---
weird asf. i remember playing demo once and there was a laurie with ds that i downed next to the hook. i was able to pick her up and hook her instantly before her ds, but a couple seconds after she was hooked and i was walking away, an ash fell out of my arms like he took laurie’s ds spot
---
Dedicated servers lmaoo
---
I don’t have all the perks on all my killers, but I generally go CI on all of them because I suck too much not to. Lol last few times I didn’t 3 gens would pop in like 1 minute. Was so bad

Is there always the same total number of gens on a map? How many actually are there usually?

I got so used to using Loadout.tf for Team Fortress 2, that I was surprised that this game didn’t have something similar.

I thought I was in r/tf2 and I was like -*haha yeah thats totally demoman*
---
I respect it. Also, I salute you for not tbagging on hatch. Truly doing God's work.
---
Seven. Always seven.
---
I play PC and red rank survivor takes forever and red rank killer is instant
---
I'm so sick of seeing these its ridiculous something needs to be fixed.
---
Yes to everything except wraith. You can have your volume so low and still hear his elephant ass stomping around
---
Yo I LOVE you style
---
Now its only max 4 ranks down which isn't that big of a deal. If you're rank one you're likely matching against a few rank 5s.
---
I NEED THEM ALLLL
---
Happened to me when I literally did 4 gens, unhooked 3 survivors and lead away the killer, I got hooked not even camped and ALL the survivors were working on the last gen, no one even came to help.
---
The Rob Zombie remake version
---
Now this is a save worth congratulating.
---
Yes the fuck they do. They are resisting
---
You could, but the 3 randomers on your team will cleanse that fucker as soon as they see it instead
---
Which perks should nurse run?
---
Of course, Cheese is NSFW
---
It be nice if they touch up areas where it couldn't spawn cause the rng aspect is that "Fun" cause it's either found with a bit of time or instantly, I'd just like it to be found in a bit of time cause it's not really a good rng system.
---
Something else that would help is having the god damn character freeze/show off the item you're testing. Does behaviour realise how god damn annoying it is to see what a weapon looks like on Spirit, when it's stored in her invisible pocket? Or the oni dropping his sword and transforming every 20 seconds so you can't see the god damn sword you're checking out!?!
---
Please make a scared baby dwight, maybe him peeking out of a locker or something. Your work is amazing and I can't wait for them to be on sale online!

That sounds like a personal problem.

Pitbulls 🤮

yobama
---
I have no idea how to get the game on iphone.... i’m in the uk and it just says not available
---
If a survivor kobes off a hook I just let them have hatch. They deserve it.
---
I do, even though I admit it's a bit on the weaker side. Honestly I love running it because the amount of information it gives you is insane - also whenever I queue with friends who don't play the game as often I'll tell them what I've found out using it (i.e. killer has BBQ, nurses, etc).
---
whats this from
---
I agree though
---
How are multiple killers in the same game?
---
Please let us know when they're on sale
---
I'll never give hatch if they don't wiggle. Reward the ones that always fight.
---
It feels decent sure it’s hard to dodge and all that stuff there’s not all the killers and survivors like Quentin and Freddy,bubba also the fact when your injured or yknow breathing there’s a little marker that’s so hard to make the killer lose you. You can’t port the original game over but they may do that so idk. Anyways it’s reseculed to come out in 2020 which is a bummer but thanks for hearing out
---
Ugly sweater Joey gang gang
---
Wiggling gives points now, so survivors will wiggle. If you're gonna give hatch, stick with your choice, otherwise hook them and save them the pettiness.

To be fair it is what makes her power so good. I think a way to "fix" her power while keeping it good for mind games is to nerf the amount of info she gets when using her power. Because the fact that survivors get none while she can pinpoint them by sound and scratch marks is a bit op but an easy fix for this would be to make grunts of pain non directional when shes using her power that way she knows if a survivor is nearby but cant just abuse her power to just track their immediate spot.
---
Because ruin usually gets cleansed in seconds or survivors are good enough to actually do gens even tho it exists
---
This is so cute and hilarious, I love it.
---
You could go epic gamer and connect a mouse and keyboard to the phone and to speakers...
---
Oh and the anxiety of the whole thing is dreadful! But man, the epically calm stealthy plays that can be performed while so immersed are unreal. Enjoy!
---
Yes:P
---
She actually DC’d later in the match while I was standing beside her to wait out the DS timer xD
---
All of these perks actually sound really good. What if survivors spammed Smother? :)
---
Legit did the same thing with David today lmao
---
True the director is literally scum
---
FUCK YOU FAGGET UGLY LOOKING LIVING IN THERE MOMS BASEMENT FUCKING UGLY SHOT DEVS HOPE YOU GUYS KILL YOURSELVES HORRIBLY FUCK YOUR PARENTS YOU UGLY CUNTS
---
It would be a good perk if it was based on charge percentages so that it would be good with Botany Knowledge and Streetwise. :)
---
How can you even breath with such harted, FASCIST /S
---
A red-haired Yui charm would be amazing! I'd buy it in a heartbeat!
---
Had a match where a swf kept cleansing, after a while almost all the pools of devotion were full so she just started slugging and killed us all
---
A lone wolf survivor would actually be an interesting concept in Dead By Daylight, but nearly impossible to go full solo.
---
You’re again contradicting yourself. Also I’m not talking about just waiting for a survivor in the middle of nowhere to use DH. I’m talking about survivors messing up and pressing a magic button that brings them to safety. What’s the counter to this? As you said, nothing. It’s similar to NOED in terms of getting bailed out for bad play.

Please make extra nea's

Yeah havent had that happen in a long time but survivors can hold the game hostage, its a really dumb technicality in gameplay. record and report, dumb but gotta find them or concede since theyre not playing the game.
---
Should introduce a mechanic like end game if no gens are touched after certain time since holding hostage, but theres always gonna be people taking advantage of the game.
---
Sounds like a rank 20 that got influenced by Ochido's Funny Montages. :(
---
It seems the more of one side you play, the more likely you’ll get the opposite side. Which really sucks because that means I have to spend time waiting to play a killer I don’t even want to play.
---
I don’t believe y’all who say you give the hook. I never struggle and every single killer has immediately hooked me. They don’t give af about me struggling or not.
---
Soooo they kept working on gens...you kept knocking them down?  Sounds like you were both playing your roles and I'm confused as to why they were scummy?
---
I’m a red rank killer almost all the time except right after rank reset and I main legion. Perk builds and add ons really can change your game up. You can try some different builds and see if that works. You can base your build around your weaknesses ( for example discordance if gen rushing is a problem for you.) If not it’s always fun to try someone new that way you have a variety.
---
A winter-themed menu/lobby, holiday lights on hooks and lockers, a firecracker item that can be found in bloodwebs and chests and is mostly useless. Potentially double bloodpoints.
---
Nothing really exciting. I'm hoping that they will bring back Oni flick with the patch.
---
Well...uh...you did stall him long enough for the other guy to break chase...
---
Ok, this is epic
---
Oh my god, I’m sitting here waiting for a survivor lobby reading how long it takes for people, etc. I’ve been sitting for like 5-10 minutes feeling impatient. I hadn’t hit ready.
---
Btw everyone...this is a joke.

I need a DWIGHT
---
Good play my man
---
yea I'm just talking about stuff like 1/5/10 being a bad way of tiering the perk up. It should be closer to 6/8/10.
---
Sure! I used the hag with the hex ruin perk as i heard it was good for noobs like myself. Any tips are appreciated.
---
What exactly are you referring to? 
---
This was the latest HUD stuff which added Oblivious and Undetectable status effects: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/82749/designer-notes-new-status-effects-and-bloodweb-changes
---
But if you mean something else, I'm not sure what to link off the top of my head
---
I had a game, where I carried my team unhooked everyone at least once but they didn't help me in return
---
That looks awesome
---
Its the one thing they feel they have control over in their lives: pissing people off
---
these are so cute.. the star &amp; moon clasps are such a nice addition with the chibi style
---
I'm afraid I haven't... You could try and contact the developers for help
---
If spirit scares you, run iron will. Otherwise, try not to get hit, and mix up your movements at loops. If you play safer, she will have less wiggle room to phase onto you.
---
Why is it a bad idea to clean all the totems we find?
---
I use iron will and resilience regularly and I have no problem walking all over the Spirit or most killers for that matter.
---
they want you to play the entire game, not just half of it
---
I don't mind dying, it's too shiny not to destroy it !
---
(Wait, I now understand how Cats think !)
---
Like I always say, I don't care about bloodpoints or pipping, I'd rather have fun.
---
Yeah, keys actually do feel like utter bullshit.
---
Honestly thought this was a relief woodblock print. Would be cool that way too though!
---
Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear enough. They added some animations in the bottom left where the survivors' names are, and sometimes there's little animations. I understand some of them (like when DS happens there's a little animation), but not all of them, so I'm curious if they were all introduced in the same patch, I suppose? Just trying to read some notes.
---
That's fair to you, and different strokes different folks. But it seems kind of... sub par for fun? You're literally just standing there, staring at the NPC do the generic struggle animation.
---
Oni has a good one as well
---
You’re probably a tricky survivor to go against. A lot of killers won’t give hatch if they got frustrated by the last survivor during the match
---
I am now just questioning humanity
---
demogordon ramsay :D
---
But survivor is instant queue...
---
Joker?
---
Dude leave your mum out of this tf?!
---
These look amazing! I would totally buy one of hag, Jane, legion, and nea!
---
I've had plenty get hook escapes. Couple have cost me games. I just don't like RNG stuff. I like ppl earning their escapes, which I don't believe getting off hook shows anything indicating earning it.
---
It’s like the normal intro cinematic. It plays every time, not really anything you can do about that.
---
I don’t loop and I’m not toxic. I’ve probably had 1 maybe 2 killers give me the hatch in the 2 years playing. The few times I’ve managed to escape after being the last survivor is when I manage to open the gate right as they’re coming after me because they always find the hatch and close it right away.
---
nope we all have it
---
These are so cute
---
Hook man from I know what you did last summer, candy man, the ring girl, basement girl from the newest evil dead.
---
if u like Legion play legion don't go playing other killers just bc legion isn't as strong it is about having fun not winning
---
The only Myers skin I want is the bedsheet/glasses one
---
You can watch twitch.tv/XAHTEP__  . He is a really good killer in general but he's russian so you probably won't understand anything. Still worth if you want to learn.
---
Carrie would be cool
---
I NEED GHOST FACE
---
So hard to get some privacy these days
---
That sounds accurate yet I keep seeing people on here posting about how they hate sole Survivors struggling and how generous they are with giving the hatch. Fake news.
---
Just david didn't say that earlier, he let his team get chopped down super fast and didn't help besides hiding he took the whole game doing one gen.
---
I hate inside maps
---
The only Killers I know that can handle no add-on play would have to be Freddy, hillbilly, and clown. Hate to say it but add-ons are kind of needed. Hard to imagine playing doctor with no add-ons. Probably a very painful experience
---
These look great! I have a GF one but not nearly as good as this one lmfao
---
Listen to homies chase music as I fall asleep😴
---
The Wraith one is awesome but can I make a suggestion: it should be Bing Bong instead of Ding Ding. That would make it perfect and something I would buy.

TAKE MY MONEY AND SELL THEM
---
it's fake
---
yep
---
Where did this 5th survivor come from?
---
I dunno how cut throat I am. I just wanna play the game, which as a killer means killing. I also don't like letting survivors get out without earning it, unless it's an extreme situation because I'd feel like I was boosting. Not like most survivors would just let me down them and hook them to death for no reason most of the time.
---
Umm...
---
she doesn't actually have nipples, it's fake
---
Is blood warden's timer refreshed by hooking again?
---
All right not going to lie. This would be very cool to put in the game but the main problem would be is that Killers would be able to easily hear you and yes there would be some racial slurs and other stuff being thrown around but at the end of the day it would be used to primarily either mess with  survivors or killers
---
i love doug this glitch. i even was able to give other killers hatchets with it.
---
It isn't. It takes a little bit of extra time but it prevents things like NOED coming back to bite you. Wastes time if they don't use it, though. Use your judgement in the moment, or run Inner Strength so you get a huge benefit from cleansing.
---
Mate, while what you said what was true, I would find that doing the same thing in each game, would get boring as hell later on.
---
Most killers will just give the game up. Playing vs 3 people is extremely boring
---
\&gt; Professional Arguer
---
I've had games like that. Where you are doing great and get the four kills extremely fast.
---
Of course not lol
---
Imagine being Mario
---
wow! look timmy! it's the 39337727272nd time we've seen this same exact fucking post!
---
I think the problem is they're very similar (cause like, they're supposed to be the same mask) so only the later damaged ones would be viable. I think.
---
You won't lose progress, if you were gamesharing a US version of the game and switch to EU, you'll be able to buy cells again and whatnot but make sure they're in the in game store. The outfits in the store may not be discounted for a bit but it'll fix itself after some time
---
It blocks all generators that aren't being worked on, so it gives you a nice lead to go for your next survivor.
---
I'll stick to camping.
---
If they wiggle they don't trust me. Trust goes two ways.
---
And magpies
---
Basically, your game version has to match the currency you buy cells with for it to register you can buy them.
---
he didn't fall from a high enough area
---
With ds you have a full minute of invulnerability and when paired with unbreakable it’s nearly impossible to go after the survivor
---
Why don't the survivors just band together to kill the killer then?
---
I didnt say black people are stupid i said people who use periodt are stupid no mather what their skin color is lmao
---
It isnt a bad idea, but theres the chance a lit totem could be the perk "Hex: Haunted Ground" that exposes everybody for a minute or so. 
---
Basically if theres nothing negative affecting you (ruin, lullably, etc) you dont HAVE to break it (until devour hope or something pops), but if you do be cautious of the totem possibly being Haunted Ground.
---
I did a match where this Steve kept trying to get his MoM tokens but it was just to obvious so I avoided him and he Dcd
---
They should imo, it would be ez
---
I don't have a single salt comment and I play both killer and survivor equally because I don't play like a prick.
---
Sorry but these killers are low rank and you are toxic...
---
Damn, if you truly think this then you probably barely play killer and are still at low ranks.
---
Also that's exactly what I do when a killer is face camping
---
if u couldnt take him anywhere then he was just wasting time but he can bleed out so the game isnt taken hostage it just lasts 4 min longer at max
---
 The Trial Grounds spawn with **7** Generators, **5** of which need to be repaired in order to power the Exit Gates, allowing them to escape from the Trial.

Humanity

I’m with ya on this one

“She’s close enough to be stunned.”
---
She was not close enough to be stunned.
---
No this guy is from the movie Drive thru.
---
Oh boi, it is

And he shouts to keep the door open after attacking
---
Magpies steal what is shiny ... I don't think they destroy what they've stolen though ._.
---
Ding ding
---
HOLY SHIT YEEESSSS
---
***pice
---
I do gens and save people off the hook but I always keep an eye on how many people have been hooked and how many times, and I will deliberately take hits/ allow myself to get caught to let other injured survivors heal up. I don’t think looping is always the best metric for being “good” at the game. There are other strategies that are just as effective.
---
I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS OUTFIT FOR TOO LONG
---
wait how'd you do this? i know how to give other killers hatchets but is it the same with pigs power? do you just make one pig dc and then the other killer can pick up their power?
---
I'd buy that Wraith one in a hot second.  
---
I'd also love a Spinechill one and Hag one \^\_\_\_\^
---
In future I probably would just let them bleed out. In the moment my thought process was leaving them up gave them the chance to still try something
---
what are you on about my guy, it's still here
---
***###KABOON*** -demoman tf2
---
Wraith should have been "bing bong" instead of "ding ding", still cool tho
---
I don't remember asking if it was real, just for sauce.
---
I need a Dwight
---
I agree with Luigi.
---
They already said they’re reworking the broken maps. They’re aiming at releasing a reworked map every mid-chapter update from now on, so expect one in January
---
Amen. Gotta respect the RNG.
---
Oh yeah that’s right. What are those birds in Australia that dive bomb your head?
---
Do you have a source for it?
---
Im not calling you a liar here would just like to see it for myself. Just seems odd they would choose to not rework a map for the nurse rework
---
Pfffttt hahaha good one, most they'll do is a bandaid after months of the community complaining.
---
No? The button for switching sides is gone
---
Survivors do anything and it’s toxic.
---
It’s not holding the game hostage because eventually he will die from bleeding out/get hatch/ somehow someway make a clutch hidden escape and hide around the map unless you closed the hatch. Not many ways to hold the game hostage anymore other than a killer body blocking EVERY survivor somewhere and not moving til all DC
---
I mean for f*ck sake there is no terror radius somebody just got downed across the map and you're running into a corner when I have Empathy 
---
/Autodidact/We'll make it HOLD STILL FOR 10 SECONDS DAMNIT
---
I hope you’re wrong but i’d be foolish to think otherwise
---
A good spirit can track you without scratch marks, iron will with quick and quiet or urban evasion are perfect counters to spirit. Keep in mind spirit can’t see blood pools unless running her red add on. So as long as you can get a small distance after a spirit hits you that’s when you stop running and walk to somewhere safe and unpredictable.

---
Hate that argument. I get really shitty survivors who are extremely easy to diwn even when I went for the teammates instead. If you're a terrible survivor than you really shouldn't get a second chase.
---
Yeah pretty much.
---
This game would be dead without swf
---
There is much joy to be had when you work together with a random and it goes flawlessly
---
Davids are aggressive survivors who juke out Killers for a living via Dead Hard and keep em busy while the team does gens
---
I made a post about jeepers creepers earlier today as I love that killer and character but it got butchered because everyone made it about the horrible director whom is a pedophile and it was not meant to be about.
---
I would totally buy some of em. Great job!!
---
Who hurt you?
---
Jakes without any skin from the store are always useless as fuck
---
&gt;uwu
---
I will personally comw to your house, break through the front door, appreciate the art, ask you not to say uwu ever, leave money for the door and then leave...... and come back just to slap you.

7 seconds. 4 was with his best add ons

Yooo! How’d you make these, these are so dope!

Low rank killer facing high rank survivors every game

It may be devour

Damn, tell us when they're for sale, I love 'em all

Whats..... that peaking out of the zipper....

please keep it up!!
---
Killers complain if totems spawn next to:
---
1. Generators.
---
2. Hooks / hooked survivor.
---
3. Inside pallet loops.
---
4. Plague's Fountains.
---
5. Pig jigsaw boxes.
---
Considering 80% of the map has at least one of these props, totems should spawn outside the playable area. Only then, killers will be happy.
---
Any survivor could defeat any killer. Just shotgun their asses
---
I'm gonna put my vote in for Bill, then David. Borrowed Time is a great perk that I try to run every single match, and Unbreakable pairs pretty well with DS because you'll often get slugged with it active.
---
As for David, he has Dead Hard, probably the best and most common exhaustion perk, as well as We're Gonna Live Forever for bloodpoints. WGLF also pairs well with BT for nearly guaranteed safe unhooks... Just don't be that guy that farms a teammate and doesn't even try to take a hit or trade hooks.
---
Nice display of talent op, I would pay for this
---
Where can I buy these?!
---
I can already tell your toxic just because you got the idea from LOL.
---
&gt; More killers than ever are either switching sides or completely abandoning the game for other options.
---
What makes you think this? Do you have any numbers to support the idea that people are abandoning the game in droves? 
---
&gt; The fact of the matter is that we need to be offering as many solutions as are humanly possible until one of them sticks and we finally start moving in the right direction. 
---
You haven’t really addressed my point. Solutions like what? How do you fix a balance issue that is baked into the very game itself? Is there a way to make it so that organised teams don’t have a disproportionate advantage, while also ensuring that the other 95% of the survivor player base doesn’t just get stomped into the dirt every game?
---
Killer is fucking stress city compared to survivor.
---
If anyone with a Europe copy can DM, i Will be very thankful
---
Legion's new whip attack
---
Plague is probably the least addon dependent in my experience, she's my goto killer for BBQ without addons and offerings.
---
Fake grab, borrowed time, dead hard in that order. D strike also helps. But if they camp at the start do tens first to punish the killer. If they don’t do anything they get entity displeased and are punishing themselves.
---
*demogorganic screeching Shred noises*
---
Playing killer is more rage inducing than fun the higher the ranks you go. 
---
Soon as you pick a non meta killer it gets even more tedious.
---
It's probably cause I'm low rank, but I'm also low rank survivor and always get punished for standing still
---
Gencamper is the toxic players version of what the game tells you to do: "patrol between gens to find surviviors"
---
dood! so im not the only one that loves that chase music!
---
Basic Feng will blow up the generator the second she hops on ot work you.
---
Who dat?
---
Are you saying you have a disc you got from Europe and are tryna buy dlc on an account that’s not in Europe? If so then it won’t work
---
Okay but what do you do when you’re in a chase if you don’t loop? How do you survive?
---
I'm with you.  Like, stop paying thousands for the damn licenses and just use the money to invest in better servers. The constant "ERROR" "disconnection from host" shit is fucking annoying....but I feel like they have a big enough team to work on the mobile version as another stream of revenue and hopefully they make millions and can use some of that money to fix DBD for us.....But we gotta keep in mind...the game is still a baby....every game starts out rough...GTA for example. It got better and better. So there's that
---
I know, i have an account from europe, and a disc from Brazil, i want to buy an digital copy from my main account in europe, but i'm worried about all my progress, i have tons of hours
---
The Wolfenstein games weren't really horror branded. But the horror of war and the scares you got in those games give Wolfenstein a horror vibe.
---
Would a shotgun really work against Freddy, though? Or Huntress, who in her lore killer platoons of World War 2 soldiers while they were moving through her forest?
---
swf are strong yes but why the fuck would I ask my 2 friends to play if we cant que together for fun should this game not be about fun?
---
Ist not I think this, it's just what happens, but I'm low rank killer and low rank surv
---
r/okbuddyentity
---
Anime Los Angeles in January
---
Legion, Ghostface and Pig seem like the weakest ones to me.
---
Well it’s not fun when the killer quits, I have played with friends in dbd and 9/10 times the killers rage quit when we get to 3-4/5 gens when they finally hooked someone
---
in doubt this is possible without the scream license. Shame
---
If anyone with an EU copy could help me l, i'll send an login from an account that i don't use for test purposes, to see if i keep my progress
---
No, if they wiggle, they want extra points.
---
Thank you so much &lt;3
---
That kind of bothers me when I'm trying to go for adepts. He escapes, and I realise that I'm 5% away from a 2-pip.
---
Happened to me, promised myself to never leave the hook when going for adept. Had a minor "ok" moment in which I almost uninstalled the game, but let's not talk about that
---
Dwights will try to meme on you but know how to run loops.
---
Megs are braindead but do gens.
---
Jakes are generally good players, but rarely bold. Will leave you to die.
---
Claudettes think they are way better at the game then they are.
---
Neas are super bold.
---
Aces know how to loop like motherfuckers, you will not catch an Ace.
---
Lauries are in a SWF.
---
Fengs are bold and cocky, but are easy to mindgame. Loves Flashlights. Good chance they think Killer OP.
---
Bills are bad at the game and dicks.
---
Davids are bros who are good except they are way too bold. Will 100% dead hard too early.
---
Quintens are decent enough players, but win or lose, they have something to complain about. Usually has an item.
---
Tapps are bros who love generators and don't like chases.
---
Kates are often girls irl.
---
Ash players think they are cool.
---
Adam players are trash but sweet and fun.
---
Jeff mains are enigmas. You never know what they are running, why they do the things they do, or what they are even thinking, but it works for them.
---
Nancies are smart but bad in chases. They love toolboxes.
---
Steves are dwights who don't want to meme as much.
---
Yuis are Feng players who want to play an actually cute character.
---
The guy responsible for creating toxic P3 Blendettes, and started the trend for tbagging and flashlight clicking in dbd.
---
You know, I can see it not working against freddy but the rest should eventually go down right?
---
Nothing a little Mori can't handle.
---
I am the Lorax and I speak for the trees, we counter the oni
---
Looks like squidward hand
---
:(
---
Mommy myers confirmed for dbd
---
They already "nerfed" swf to not be able to smurf against low rank killers it is bad enough having my rank 20 friends play in rank 9 where they lose contently. 
---
Besides as a killer main I hardly see 4 stacks or even 3 stacks and when I do it goes okay but idrc how many kills I get if I lose I lose oh well if I wanted to win I wouldn't play trapper in rank 5.
---
it is stupid rare to see actual super strong 4 stacks or 3 stacks or maybe I havent lost to them to notice it but again I wanna play with my friends and they only bought the game to play with me they aren't gonna play on their own
---
It would work against freddy if you pulled him into the real world
---
Not if he runs into a locker
---
Yeah please be careful in terms of copyright/trademark!
---
But I would imagine Ghostface to be able to fight but then again he is more human then trapper or billy and Pig yea but lets be honest Amanda would rig the games with a gun so she don't lose
---
And thats the point I'm making. These teams aren't unbeatable. They win more often because they are more skilled than many.
---
Damn it I've been caught in a checkmate
---
I’d love to buy some! Followed so that I can get a notification if you post again about a sale!

To be fair, i didnt expect such greatness in the morning, but i welcome this.

I mean, an off switch to not play with pc players could work, then it just broadens who can play with who, not having it at all wouldn't be the right move, as long as players have an option not to
---
Father and Daughter duo
---
I think Clown, Pig, Legion, Bubba, Ghostface, and Demogorgon in the lowest class, where a few well-placed bullets would take them out for good. 
---
Huntress, Hag, Doctor, Plague and Oni are probably in the same class, but they have some supernatural properties in their lore that make me think they might be a bit tougher to take down.  
---
Wraith, Spirit and Nurse are in the 'Maybe?' class where I'm not sure how durable they are, because they're ghosts, and bullets might not work on them at all, or they might just damage them normally. 
---
Hillbilly is also in a 'Maybe?' class for me, because his perk Enduring kind of implies to me he has a supernatural durability like a lot of classic slashers, but that is really just me speculating. *"He stops at nothing."*
---
Michael and Freddy are in the 'Bullets won't work!' class, where I don't think conventional weapons would deal much damage at all. 
---
But, that is just my opinion on the matter!
---
No cosmetics Steves are wholesome and friendly. Bills will do literally anything to get you out of the game alive. Davids farm of course.
---
Is That literally it?
---
I thought you had to do some strafing thing with stalk
---
Can we ban a person from the game for just existing? Lol
---
Hmm not 100% sure I think you keep your progress but do some more research before buying it
---
So your point replying was to do what? Learn your gaming lingo? No thx you sound loony m8
---
Imagine being so entitled you think people shouldn’t play with friends.
---
No. Literally no one is complaining about any of those things besides gens. You’re making a fake argument against no one.
---
Hi, You sell some stuff?

I feel like Smooth Criminal would have been a better fit with the lean at the beginning.

*against bad survivors
---
Survivor Main with 600+ Hours here, between PC and PS4. Here's my break down of every fellow survivor main I see:
---
(As a quick note, just know that these are just from my own experiences. I'm not trying to bash anyones main, I love all the survivors. Also warning: Long Post.)
---
Dwights
---
-Most of them are babies who don't know what they're doing. The rest who aren't babies and know what they're doing are usually decently altruistic and while they might not be the best, they try for the team.
---
Megs
---
-The term 'Meghead' exists for a reason. I think I've had more Megs go down in the first ten seconds then most other survivors. They also tend to struggle a bit with generators. They also have the Dwight syndrome of being baby survivors who are scared of the killer a lot of the time.
---
Claudettes
---
-Claudettes are one of two people: the really good teammate, who might be a bit toxic and is hated by all killers- or the really bad, scaredy cat team mate. You know the one. The one that will sit and self care in a corner versus a Legion while you're on hook. The one that will let you die so they can get hatch. The one who will sit and do nothing most the game. The one who will only touch a gen if someone else is there so they won't get chased.
---
Jakes:
---
-My main man Jake comes in three flavours: baby, who doesn't know what they're doing, and is probably running Calm Spirit instead of Iron Will. The Sabo-Saviour who will spend their entire match 99%-ing hooks, but never actually break one when you need it. And the memer, who obviously plays the game only to have fun. They might be decent or even good at the game, but they usually fuck around a lot during the match.
---
Neas:
---
-I think we all know the two different types of Neas. You have the baby Nea who's probably new to the game and likes to Urban Evasion around the map like her life depends on it, or you have the Noob3-wannabes who usually don't actually know how to run loops all that well, but they're toxic and piss off the killer regardless. You also have the occasional actual good Nea, but they're increasingly more rare these days.
---
Davids-
---
-God, I love getting Davids on my team. They don't always make the best plays or decisions, and they're not always the best at loops, but they are probably the most altruistic teammate there is. Seriously, Davids are the ones I always see being dead set on getting the hook saves and getting up their altruism points. (On the plus side too, Davids usually tend to actually be pretty good. Especially the shirtless ones.)
---
Fengs-
---
-Hit or miss teammates. There's a lot of baby Fengs, oddly enough. Then there's the Feng who is generally decently toxic and tends to be an asshole to the killer, but they at least know how to run loops. Then there's the cut-throat Feng who will very quickly leave you for dead at a moment's notice. The last one is the one I see the most, personally.
---
Bills-
---
-You know how I said Fengs and Neas can be toxic? Yeah, well Bills tend to be worse. Not sure why, but I always see Bills giving killers a complete workout to get that down, and I've seen a lot be pretty mean about it too.
---
Aces-
---
-They're usually alright. Not the best, not the worst. They're rare to get, and nice to see, but not all too unique either. You usually only really see Aces when he gets a new cosmetic.
---
Lauries-
---
-I don't play with many Lauries, but when I do, they tend to be loop gods. They know how to run loops really well, and they tend to bring a lot of flashlights. However, they're generally not great at gens. Most of my Lauries blow up my gens.
---
Quentins-
---
-They're usually hipsters. There's not many people who play Quentin (For obvious reasons). I will say though, they are committed, and I hope one day he gets his cosmetic surgery so he has a half-decent face.
---
Tapps-
---
-I really enjoy getting Tapps. There's not very many of them, but they tend to be great teammates. They have a good idea on what to do and when to do it, and they have a solid idea on how to run loops. Great team players, and I love to see them.
---
Kates- 
---
-Very similar to Tapps. The only difference is that I've seen a lot more Kates be a bit more... mean, and I've seen them struggle more with Ruin then Tapps. Other wise, pretty great to have.
---
Adams-
---
-Very rare, but very smart. They're usually more on the altruistic side, but they usually are pretty great at gens too. They tend to be more on the team player side of things, but not the team player that might get you killed in the process of trying to save you like some others.
---
Jeffs-
---
-...Do they even exist? I think I've only seen like... three Jeff mains in my entirety of playing. And I didn't pick up the game until Legion came out. They usually tend to be mediocre at best. Not amazing at anything, but not 'sit in a corner doing nothing all game' terrible. 
---
Janes-
---
-Almost every Jane I've played with has been a memer who just wants Head-On stuns, and I can respect that. They're usually decent with altruism, but they're not good at figuring out good healing times. They spend a good amount of time on gens, but they're not great at loops. But they are great at their stuns.
---
Ashs-
---
-Honestly, probably the biggest memer in the cast. Almost evey Ash I play with is just fun. They usually run some really weird builds, tend to be really fun to play with, and are usually pretty nice in end game chat. They definitely play to have fun, and I can appreciate.
---
Nancys-
---
-Nancys are try-hards. Full stop. Almost every Nancy I play with or against has been the really smart, really good teammate- but also the one that you don't always want on the team. Similar to the 'WannabeNoob3s', they try to pull off a lot of things that just don't work against good players, and spend more time chasing the killer then they should for how hard they try. They tend to be pretty sweaty, imo.
---
Steves-
---
-Steves tend to be a weird mix of good Neas and memes. They're usually really solid teammates, great at running the killer, and might be a bit toxic to the killer- but a really funny teammate who's very likely to be nice to you and meme with you. Very enjoyable to play with- probably not so much against.
---
Yuis-
---
-She hasn't been out long enough for me to say anything.
---
That's fair, I run it so I can stock up on items, and really they only get used in the match if it was a med kit or a toolbox
---
Little Bunny Mama please 🐰
---
This guy is an absolute unit
---
Are there any clown mains that stream or have a YT channel. I’ve really enjoyed playing him.  
---
If not, any build suggestions? Currently I use discordance, devour hope, pop and corrupt intervention. I don’t have too many t3 perks on him as I need to dump more BP into him, but any suggestions are welcome.
---
Wait, they nerfed Stridor? What the fuck? It used to counter iron will, not the other way around, so that the survivors sounded normal (as they would w/out perks) instead of being completely negated. It was pretty much the only saving grace loveleh spireh had after nerf, since she doesn't get effected by the sound bug as much as other killers because chase music gets (relatively) muted in phasing.
---
You shouldn’t be bringing up being on the spectrum that’s an easy way to make a joke about you
---
Trapper is so cute UwU
---
All of em die except nurse and you have a fucking gun and all
---
oh god please no. not here.

Ik some of these gamers don’t even know you can break a pallet with her axe, it’s common sense ppl come on
---
Cold wind farm comes to mind, even on lowest settings I get a few lag spikes there

Plague without Apples is just really bad. Plague with apples can be pretty good.

This is dbd... Its just gonna get worst they haven't show any signs of fixing servers or shit but wait cosmetics

Endgame collapse man, so annoying
---
There is no Singing Claudette on a Hook 0/10

My best guess is that the Oni is the most powerful. A Japanese spirit ogre that has enough power to destroy entire villages, but Mikey could expose and one hit so who knows.
---
I've yet to see a Jake do that
---
It wont.
---
Maybe let's talk about DBD 2 when they can make DBD 1 good enough to stay alone without much checking

I would love to use the fucking goblin mask from 5

---
I tried it and faild to get the tokens, but I think it would be really awesome on hag. But if you really want to put it in your build, you should consider to switch it with BBQ, because most of the time you can't see anyone when you put down the trap on the hook first. (except you just want the BP, then nvm)

I think I et tiny TR...but Snipe doc? What add-ons are used for this?

Wiggling gives me blood points so go die.

Tbh that s a fair excuse got shit all I only got pop from it

Your comment made my day! :)

Those are epic!!!!! I'd love a Meg one haha. But they're honestly sooooooooo good!!

The electrodes or whatever they are called plus the casset tape that makes ur shock into a column

Basically max range add-on + column shock = stupid range
---
Yes please
---
ONI SLICK
---
Can sorta confirm, almost. I play pretty much exactly 50/50 and get dailies pretty evenly split. Though I'm also pretty sure that's coincidence.
---
I’d say the idea behind it is that its in open air and so visible that survivors shouldn’t dare to break it cause the killer would see the survivor instantly. Just my theory though :)
---
How charming
---
Pubes
---
Maybe instead of being a bug with a game in it,
---
It's a game with bugs.
---
You little failed, cos Furtive decrease Terror While in chase. M&amp;A Increase your Terror in chase, so:
---
24(standart)+8(M&amp;A)-16(FC w 4 tokens)= 16m in chase. 2 perks for this? Nonono
---
Plus a hex perk build and u see that notification someone is touching a totem fucking ZAP and they are getting off the totem
---
I don’t want movie characters but I won’t old powers recycled and put into original characters like the nightmare is no longer Freddy Krueger but burny joe
---
I thought he was banned on PS4
---
I agree with you. I never gave the hatch for kobes. Is based o luck not on skill. Instead, I did it many times for skilled survivors that aren't toxic during the game.
---
He can't do anything in a loop and has his map pressure ability on a charge up. 
---
The flick was the only thing that made him viable, otherwise you just use the ability to pressure, in which case billy is a straight upgrade. 
---
He was an alternative to billy,  a crazier ability like Billy but on a charge up
---
I mean it wouldn't be much of a challenge if it didn't take you out of your comfort zone a bit would it. Either do the challenge or don't.
---
I play killer cuz you have rely on your teammates which are randoms for me (i play solo ofc) and most of the time they cant play at all like cleansing against plague on red ranks xD
---
I had 3 campers in a row yesterday, a Ghostface, Leatherface and Wraith. The last one was gladly not the best and I got unhooked and had DS (I put it in after the game with leatherface)
---
Yes I get that but it's already bad enough having people just doing their challenges not caring about the team like I love to hold shift I'm not amazing at the game but I usually expect to die and this challenge ofc forced me to play in the only way I thought could work waiting for hatch I'm not proud of it but all the other challenges don't really force u to alter how u play completely and it's already things u usually do while playing Survivor.
---
But yes I can't disagree it's a challenge it's not meant to be easy and it doesn't need to be but just that one is a bit dumb bc getting hooked is part of being a team mate
---
Lately I'm like 70 % survivor 30 % killer and I was getting killer dailies constantly. As soon as I started playing killer more often I started getting survivor rites too.
---
Isn't it obvious that DBD community on reddit is much smaller than the entire DBD player base? It's obviously rare to find someone that gives hatch to last player, but you can't say that it's 'fake news' if you just didn't experience it yourself.
---
I respect the 4% in cases like this, yes it is RNG but if it is a genuine 4% then it is rare it happening I let the survivor go, otherwise what is the point in even being able to Kobe.
---
Pretty much. But we still like calling people dickheads too.
---
Plague can be played without addons you just can’t play nice with the survivors
---
On the other hand "Sure I'm far enough away not to get stunned" "

"ArugRGUGAHAG"

Which one because I live in la

I hated it.

I played a few games and I can say: the Graphics just suck, the controls are unbareable and the Performance is terrible(tho thats probably due to my S7)

She cut her own toe off bruh. That's why it's an addon, and why she is missing a toe. Double check the story.

I actually do know why...
---
1. Yeah no, they’re not gonna do that. They make money by releasing new content. They’re not gonna spend an entire chapter on free content.
---
2. They haven’t said anything about reworking Lery’s. They just confirmed they were currently working on Haddonfield and Red Forest reworks
---
Yeah that's how I avoided it once
---
many months of still being in beta. they aren't on consoles (other than switch) yet
---
I somehow want to make a cake out of it, but i a never made a cake by myself so add it to the list of things i really wanna do in my life but probably never will.
---
Not true. I mostly play survivor and mostly get killer dailies. I'll come back after a few days and have 3 killer dailies, and then get a 4th when I discard one of them. I used to think it was because I had more killers unlocked, but now I have most of the survivors and nothing changed.

Don't be afraid of sharp shading and coloring

Rank 20 to 16 aren't affected by matchmaking.
---
So you haven't seen the video that was sent to The King ? Those graphics are wayyyyy better. I think they showed him an upgraded version of the game. Trust me bro....the graphics look like the console version...just you know...a bit worse...but it's on the right track
---
Even Minecraft got Crossplay on all devices.. Dead by Daylight should be able to let Xbox &amp; PlayStation play together
---
Yeah, from all the whining hear about NOED and toxic killers from survivor mains I'm running into about 50% that're just farming, 25% that let the last 2 go, and 10% that're trying with like 5% camping. No wonder why I'll run into super boosted red ranks on killer sometimes. I honestly find that shit so boring. I want to try and improve at loops and awareness and so many killers just call it in. Granted I'm only rank 13 survivor, and was red rank killer 2 months ago, but shit man. This ain't fun to me.
---
shut up, green mario no one likes you.
---
You shouldn't feel bad as some people just troll and be pricks on purpose.
---
That’s a shame.
---
https://imgur.com/a/Ji1Xvd1 thats how it looks for me
---
Lmaooooo broooo.  That's not even close to what I'm talking about bro. That looks like some Roblox shit...the gameplay I saw was 1million times more realistic than this. Just wait till you see it..you'll be hyped
---
Meanwhile I only give hatch to tricky survivors if they play bad they get the hook if they loop me for milleniums they can go
---
Apart from you're spectating the last guy alive but good meme
---
It's the og hag build for sure. I'm using m&amp;a, stbfl, pop and agitation rn
---
I know that, its the perk I already have
---
Bloodpoints man bloodpoints
---
Bro I get it..but I'm telling you The King was shown new gameplay and the game is lightyears better looking...they're still working on fixing some animations like the hooking but everything else is great....Also, forgot to mention, the POV is the same as in the console...3rd person perspective.  Running looks very smooth. Go youtube it
---
I checked his Channel, there is nothing. Got a link?
---
yeah man i am waiting for it to boom so matchamking will take less tine its in beta for like 6 month + i guess
---
I play every Killers without addons. That's how you proper learn the Killers.
---
But i would say Legion/Freddy/nurse/spirit/Billy/demo/pig are OK without any addons.
---
Michael bubba are pretty Trash without them, Michael takes ages to tier up and bubba needs to be on your ass to hit you with the chainsaw
---
Do you plan to make one for Legion ?
---
Challenges should be fun or actually challenging, preventing exit gates with unnerving is literally useless, unnerving has nothing to do with exit gates. They should make them fun and create challenging builds to use.
---
Finger lickin' good
---
Just smoke a joint. The munchies will give you motivation
---
Still, I just don't like it you know? 
---
It feels like they don't have a strong internal team for testing, if they have one at all.
---
I assume you don't know that perks have multiple tiers. Meg has Q&amp;Q at level 1 at base, and you can get that to level 2 when you buy it in the bloodweb.
---
Start with more than just one,  and/or make the ones around the map already active
---
The original Trailer was also very loud.. But I love the new Chapter Trailer.. reminds me of good old NFS
---
Would be dope to see more characters! Your work is amazing keep up! Also let us know when youre ready to sell them online.

here's the [original image without text](https://i.imgur.com/gYIZLIB.png) if anyone wants it for whatever reason
---
Okay?
---
Omg the lineup of those quests is sooooo satisfying it's actually perfect.
---
Post link asap i need that huntress
---
The game also punishes you for giving you bad survivors cuz you killed them too fast.
---
“Oh, those survivors stand no chance against this killer... let’s depip the killer and give him weaker survivors until the killer learns to farm”
---
Kicking it on the edge would only hurt and wouldnt break it as well
---
His 2 perks, I'm all ears and TT are solid. 
---
I'm all ears is good to loop with, it stays on for good while and with your power you can easily end chases. It shines with the pig to make use of her dash.
---
TT is good to track and to stop gen repairs. It not amazing but not hot shit. It ok.
---
For his power. You do not wish to petrol on the ground, simply walk. 99 people then start a chase then 100% the mark during the chase to ensure they get the marked stab. 
---
Hooked and downed both can break your power so be careful.
---
what fucking magic is this
---
What rank starts to be considerd high rank?
---
Almost everyone runs Monitor and Abuse because her terror radius is lower than the base
---
Corrupt Intervention brings people to you in the early game and makes you not lose far gens when you prepare the playing field 
---
STBFL lets you teleport quicker after hitting someone, which lets you spread the damage and apply more pressure. It also makes you end chases quicker. You benefit a lot form survivors being injured, because if they happen to trigger a trap, it’s a free down for you
---
Agitation covers your weakness. It makes you spend less time bringing people to hooks, which gives survivors less time to get rid of your traps (survivors often go and trigger them all when you’re carrying someone)
---
Some people like running A Nurse’s Calling instead of Agitation to sneak up on people with Monitor And Abuse. This also goes hand in hand with your ability to hurt multiple people and switch targets rapidly. I’m not a big fan tho
---
Nice Dead Hard though! Not sure if he would've hit you or not, but still sweet af!
---
In the wise words of Luigi: if it glows, it goes.
---
Additionally, if you can't find all 5 totems, not cleansing one offers a chance (up to 50% if you cleansed 3 of 5) that if the killer has NOED, it lands on a totem you know the location of.
---
Additionally, the killer's preoccupation with the exit gates after all 5 gens are powered/during the EGC mean you can usually cleanse totems freely without detracting from generator repair time, if they don't have NOED.
---
Of course the race for those juicy bloodpoints and emblem contribution means you usually wanna cleanse before just for selfishness.
---
His username is so fitting.
---
This is all just loser talk. Do the challenge or don't.
---
Wait, are they seriously going to rework Nurse?
---
Boring, not very original and will be given to random person who gives a fuck. It's not even about being fast, it's about not having issues with the payment and having a fast internet connection.
---
Looks like they made it as a prototype, found out that it's not worth making and are selling the prototype now
---
thanks I shall remember this as the usual DBD community answers to a opinion "git gud scrub"
---
It's pretty obvious that this is this case. The other people saying you made a "mistake" have poor observation skills.
---
It's because the community spends 90% of their energy complaining. Grow up or just stop playing if you're gonna just whinge about every aspect of the game
---
Well you can always get ruin sloppy butcher and sweat a bit as a spirit nurse or someone else metapick, i personally main freddy and with ruin even at rank 1 it isnt ao bad man
---
Yea thank you for the spoiler. I still need to see that show.
---
It's literally a context to see who will DC first when that happens.
---
whinge? let me guess u read the first 2 lines and thought I was bitching it being too hard but ignored the fact I thought all other challenges where fine? 
---
ok clown
---
You took my generalised comment personally and now want to act clever. OK kid.
---
10 4 dinosaur
---
Aah VRChat! So much meme and video potential but no one does it
---
Any generator right in the center is definitely the best if you don't know where the solo generator is, they should both be the first two priorities for the team/the first two (of three) generators popped.
---
This is easier with certain killers of course, someone like Wraith basically has to surrender 3 generators (even with Ruin) just to down someone due to being forced to M1 them and deal with the distance of that and the safe pallet the survivor reaches as a result, as well as the pallet they reach for him having to uncloak, and the pallet they reach with their exhaustion perk.
---
Traditionally this is enough time to pop a generator solo even if you cannot hit the 'great' on Ruin.
---
Stay salty.
---
Well i think there could be ways around that. Maybe the killer cant hear survivors as much as the other survivors can hear each other or a ptt option
---
A spoiler will always be a spoiler. If I tell you the end of the Bible it is still a spoiler no matter how far in the past the spoiler already is. You will always spoil some people with a spoiler, the more you know.
---
maybe the Jake lagged out or something
---
When you have multiple strong toolboxes or BNP on the survivor side, or the endurance insta-heal, which can easily be better than healing a full health state, then yes, those get pretty powerful. And I did ignore keys because I think they are overrated because it's only really when 3 escape with 1 gen left it is definitely annoying, the rest of the time it gives you a slightly faster win than you normally would, and when it's 2 left you still tie at least.
---
But killers definitely have the stronger items, they need a lot of nerfs in that area and then general buffs to most base kits
---
Myers:
---
*I am stealth*
---
IMHO as someone who plays both sides, DS needs a rework. It should be usable both times after unhook but with a smaller window and bigger skill check both times. 30 seconds first time, 15 the second time. This would remove the guaranteed escape once doors are open and discourage tunneling as lower ranked people would have better luck with it.
---
He didn't he was still moving his camera and pointing
---
Too bad. I’ll just not do dailies.
---
I just pick up and hit air if they wiggle . Lol
---
Jane is hot as fuck. That's one trap I'd fall right the fuck into.
---
Lmfao i bet you didn’t give someone the hatch for a few days
---
Good ol DBD
---
Yeah seriously. Who thought it was a good idea for queen Latifah and vh1 to produce a horror show?
---
Eh, opinions I guess
---
Have you ever had a pallet dropped on your face out of nowhere as you stroll through the map looking for survivors? HAVE YOU?! ...
---
Depending on the killer I find CI better because it gives you more control over gens for at least 2 minutes
---
Yea yea can't say it's unheard of
---
Everything dbd 1 had and more. 
---
Also with making a new dbd they could make the game better instead of trying to fix a game that’s broken. I’m not sure about what software they used or anything but with how much money they should be making by now they could use a better software to make dbd a better experience. 
---
See when dbd2 comes out all I expect is it to be coming out because new consoles are released and the game will have a new system that fixes most the flaws dbd has now. 
---
This game is essentially like HotS, LoL, Overwatch, Paladins etc. so I expect them to treat as so and integrate every character they made over to the second one. 
---
I think everyone would be highly disappointed if they don’t do that. 
---
Also it should feature a new game mode and just a better menu experience. Like being able to see what different clothing pieces look like or being able to rotate things in the store. 
---
Along with at least 3 killers and 3 more survivors.
---
That to me is fine bc it's all part of how u play as a good team mate it shouldn't change how u play very much besdies having u focus on something else more.
---
Can I get the link? I need to like that comment!

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ebukbo/if_there_was_a_freeforall_between_all_the_killers/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yeah i I’ve read the lore and i don’t have the plague so you double check... oh wait you couldn’t have known because we don’t know each other and you know nothing about me 🤦‍♂️
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Couldn't have said this better myself 👏 Yui's from my experience tend to be a mix between Baby/Good Neas and Megs.
---
As a Quentin, Steve and Nea (also Feng but I don't play her as much lately) player atm you've described me spot on. I have the general idea of what to do although I'm super inconsistent with my looping games, there's matches where I can run the killer for 3 gens and there's matches where I can't even last 5 seconds. The only good thing you can count on me for anytime is to flash-light save you (that is if I'm in a good position of course).
---
With Steve I usually tend to meme and moonwalk, nod and teabag at teammates as a way to greet or thank them depending on the situations. Or just simply point at you if you blow up the gen we're working on.
---
With Quentin I tend to be the same but slightly more serious.
---
With Nea you could say I'm a No0b3 wannabe since like I said I'm not consistent on my looping games but yeah I just try to overall be a good teammate, and sadly I tend to get chased first every single game with her. 
---
Now about your David description, please tell me where you find these Davids, the ones I get in my team tend to be way too altruistic and screw the team over. I mean I do have good af Davids once in a while but 80% of the time they're just 4heads. 😂
---
A gun wouldn't necessarily stop all of the Killer roster.
---
Huntress has killed multiple platoons of heavily armed soldiers single-handedly and Michael Myers was, in Dr. Sam Loomis' words, "SHOT SIX TIMES!!" off a balcony before he got up and was totally fine.
---
Amd there's always Freddy to consider.
---
Anytime HG pops up I usually hide till its gone.
---
I don't like the idea of an entire respawn system just for one addon, kinda removes a lot of tension in the game too. As for killing after being hooked twice,  seems pointless, this will make the addon too weak as you could just hook them and get more points at that point. It gives no advantage. Same with the respawn, why let them respawn when I can just hook them.
---
So you belong to the killer group who disconnect when they face good survivors and get looped by one of them for 2 to 3 gens. Same as survivors who disconnect if they are the one who gets down first. For you guys its We don' care = We don't have guts to  play if situation is hard. Every killer can get kills if they camp, every survivor can escape if they disconnect before dying. Don't be proud when you get 4k like this, you just chose the easy way. Thats all. Enjoy your easy kill playstyle.
---
I feel obligated to bring up that Demogorgon is bulletproof; it tanks direct shots to the head from a revolver and slaughters quite a few government agents armed with machine guns with ease.
---
5 second stun doesnt get you far especially against a nurse or billy
---
They definitely want to play Killer. It's more a question of getting them the right perks so that they can play whatever they want in the not-too-distant future.
---
Yes, but OP's complaint is about just gens. Not all the listed things.
---
Instead of addressing OP's complaint you're addressing an imaginary complaint that you have created based on other complaints you have heard. A strawman.
---
Both of them have a reasonable grasp of the mechanics. We're trying to work out perks for them to focus on and prepare them to play any Killer without too much issue.
---
id say more important is finding a killer you enjoy
---
Umm...those are licenced characters. Selling them sounds pretty illegal.
---
I can't change your mind.
---
IMO it's silly and only happens because BHVR aren't willing to give totem spawns, or any part of older map design, an in-depth and thought out, rework.
---
All i want to know is where online
---
Put it this way: I enjoy Hag and Trapper more than I do most other Killers. I wouldn't have found that out if I didn't have perks that made them work the way I like to play them. I'm looking to get my friends to a point where they can experiment with Killers and find what they enjoy as soon as possible.
---
Time to run around looking for the totem until everyone is on stage 2 hook with 5 gens left!
---
Why Legion ? And how much did you earn
---
dbd 2 would basically be dbd but with a solid non sphagetti code
---
You would be amazed on how far that gets you. Yes on these two out of the 19 killers in the game it might not be far but on the other 17 ut gets you really far, and most likley out of the deadzone as they usually are not that large in the begin with.
---
I'm All Ears is definitely a good choice, but I don't know if having them play Ghostface is a good start for someone who's relatively new to the game. Same with Hag for Ruin (though I'm personally her biggest fan). I guess what I'm asking is for the best perks to get with minimal effort for a new player.
---
My personal choice is BBQ, Infectious Fright, STBFL, Surveillance for solid map awareness and pretty much guaranteed bloodpoints. But if I'm asking them to play 4 different killers for teachables, it'd help to know what order to play them in. Alternative builds with lower investment effort would also be appreciated.
---
If they get downed and hooked than the killer hooks them where they want. And if a good survivor goes down than he probably already used all of the pallets around him
---
Or just remove keys, decisive strike, borrowed time, and adrenaline I think most survivor mains wouldn't cry over it.
---
Ja helaas.. Het was het eerste wat ik tegen kwam toen ik iets zocht om subtitles toe te voegen haha
---
Piggy. Her addons are mostly useless and some hurt her. She only has afew good onces.
---
Except that the two killers I mentioned are two of the best and most popular killers
---
technically it’ll be better if it’s “ a ding ding ding”
---
I doubt removing mori's would make the code less buggy. I agree with you that this suggested "respawn" system is not a good idea but I don't think getting rid of them would be fantastic either, probably just mediocre if anything. You'd get pushback from the players who used it for the neat animation and from the players that wanted them for help against SWF teams but that's probably it.
---
Another way to put it: I learned to play Killer on Huntress. This was probably not the best idea. I'm looking for a good balance of "not too hard to learn" and "good rewards for getting up to level 40."
---
this could give us a nazi general as a killer maybe
---
Same thing pretty much. Either way I think this is more the fault of the battle pass. They need to do a double XP weekend or something so people have less reason to AFK macro.
---
I actually managed to Pre-order it. It's the Zombie Bait edition.
---
So a perk is balanced cause its fine against the most popular killers but the other killers are not popular so they can go screw themselves?
---
You forgot the"" for funny.
---
I carry them once I swinging and shaking when they wiggle if they wiggle off the next pickup goes straight to the hook
---
It's weird when you pass a hook and they still keep struggling like I could have hooked you if you stopped
---
Get bbq then stbfl than infectious and finally surveillance bbq will help get blood points and since pig is a harder stealthy killer you need to understand the game a little more than someone like Myers
---
I play Laurie the most (her new hair cosmetic is fly af) and that was pretty spot on
---
I think it depends on the sort of the person player is. For me playing killer is immensely less stressful because:
---
1. Matchmaking is almost instant as killer for me
---
2. More bloodpoints
---
3. I'm always in control of the situation
---
The second one definitely sounds like a bad joke so let me clarify it. I mean, literally, I always control the input (aside from the times that I'm stunned) - from the beginning till the end. I don't rely on my teammates because there are none. It's always me who is responsible and always me who make the choice in the end.
---
It doesn't change the fact that I might have a bad map or players who are clearly better than me or be unlucky overall. Still I won't be facecamped to death of hook farmed or just sacrificed because nobody came to rescue me.
---
That said, I still *enjoy* survivor side more simply because I don't want to be *a killer*. I'm a rather peaceful guy and I generally don't want to kill or play maniac in the games. Yet playing killer gives me much less stress because having no control over the situation without me being responsible for it is the thing that stresses me out.
---
Usually depends on your killer for which is better
---
Honestly, as long as you can play decently and know a few tricks as killer or survivor, you probably can win. He isn't as good as all the other content creators.
---
Or ban afk people don't help them
---
You are correct on the movement speed.
---
Yes it does against everyone but nurse and spirit, I can run a Billy easily, spirit and nurse are much harder than running a Billy
---
Tbh no killer really has super good perks that work perfectly for them imo
---
Yet there might still be more pallets in the area that they didnt have, well i dont know, a five second stun to be able to reach it. And for your first statement you get a full minute of DS. Thats enough time to get a gen 50% of a gen while the killer chases two other survivers then get chased yourself and DS the killer.
---
Dwights with the millennial sunglasses are either extremely toxic or extremely wholesome. No in between.
---
So? Gone is gone
---
You think Plague is easier for a new Killer than Pig? I like them both, but it's hard for me to judge what would be easier for a newbie. 
---
I was waffling on the order because Make Your Choice and Surveillance makes learning Myers a lot easier, but you're right that Amanda is probably harder to learn for a beginner.
---
obvious Jason skin for the trapper or jason himself
---
You can still be downed caude it's not immunity and he can also just not pick you up
---
Stridor wasnt nerfed. It never completely countered iron will. Not by too much (5%) but it can make a difference
---
Yeah those 5% are brutal, if you don't tap or hit the great checks you'll be there all day unless you get lucky with minimal skill checks.
---
I just realized you can now play Darksouls in dbd!
---
Well, how I see it, is that the game won’t end so quickly. I get games that last so quick that I don’t even pip. So, taking ds helps evens the game for me however. And just because you’re a terrible survivor doesn’t mean you can’t have fun and make the game last a bit longer. It’s not their fault they are being tunneled. I mean if you know they have ds, then leave them. What can I say? Ds isn’t that big of a deal. It’s like a wasted perk slot imo
---
I've always wanted to platinum this game - maybe the hatch challenge will be easier this way
---
Basically what I want is an order to play Killers that's most rewarding for a new player. Wraith is easy to learn, but gives you nothing. Myers isn't too much harder, but gives you PWYF and STBFL.
---
You're thinking of corrupt intervention. Thrilling tremors, when survivors are picked up (cooldown of 40 seconds) will block all generators not being worked on for 15 seconds and will highlight them in white. It lets you see which gens are worked on and where to go next. Basically BBQ&amp;Chili with without the bloodpoints but slows down the game a bit
---
Yeah but in that situation how could they predict you still had DS after all of that to counterplay it?
---
Oh yeah ive seen that one, love it
---
WDYM IS NOT A TOY
---
Just play both bro
---
But is she ? Lol
---
I'd honestly suggest watching Otzdrava video on who to level up first he is much smarter than me
---
If the survivor does something like crawl towards the killer or seems to easily give themself up or jump in a locker than they probly have ds
---
Otz is great, no doubt. Doesn't hurt to get other opinions, though.
---
There may not be an event per se. probably just winter themed bloodweb and winter party starter with 2x or 1.5x bloodpoints.
---
21600 for Joe, 17550 for Susie, so 39150 total.
---
I really got into playing Legion after the rework, and it's one of my preferred killers. I thought both the Frank and Julie skins were boring, and also wanted to have one of each of the four, so I saved up for those ones. I don't spend the shards on the Shrine, and one of the reasons it took me so long to save up was because I was buying the original DLC with the shards as well. Apart from that, most of the decent cosmetics are only bought with Auric Cells, so those were the two I saved up for.
---
Wraith is fine where he's at.
---
Idk man I feel like the oni needs to be fatter.you got a great picture tho
---
For Ghostface, you're using 3 tracking perks, that's kinda overkill. You can usually hear them if they're on gens anyway, Nurses Calling and Sloppy Butcher is a good combo. Drop Discordance and Thrilling Tremors imo, and use Ruin and either Thanatophobia OR a chase perk like Bamboozle.
---
3 months now since the official statement. This post will still get deleted by "highlighting unbalanced matchmaking"
---
Yesterday I waited with a Russian and a Swedish person for like half an hour. They quit after that and I stayed alone. The swedish guy tried to re-queue like five times,  but he ended up in the same lobby (our lobby) every time he tried. It's crazy.
---
Make sure you survive AND escape. We wouldn’t want you to survive while still playing or get killed while you escape.
---
My favorite vine ever brought to dbd, makes me happy :,)
---
hey they finally added a 4v1 mode
---
the "survivor who ran the killer for 5 gens" was me just about now, wish the other 2 guys left escaped already so I could get hatch, unlucky me.
---
I'm saying that the perk isnt a big problem and if they nerfed ds before moris it would make no sense.  The killer can leave the chase and patrol gens anytime. They decide what happens in the game not the survivor getting chased.

No. You could juggle a little hit as a counter. New DS the survivor has a full minute of immunity
---
You are misunderstanding me 
---
Killers taking personal the looping
---
Survivors taking the killing 
---
But nobody should
---
By core I don't me like "how to play to win" I mean core as in "someone from BHVR was payed to program design and implement this thing". Think of it like deleting a specific gun from a shooter, yes the Gun might have been terrible but it was still an item that people had access to and now don't. Back when they turned off moonlight offerings there was similar backlash, despite the fact that killer could just change two settings and negate the effect people still liked it because it looked cool. 
---
The shrouds are 100% useless. Killer shroud activity helps the survivors by making it easier to gen rush you. Group shrouds happen naturally more times than not, at least when I play I'm almost always spawning with 1-2 other survivors near by. And vigo's shroud doesn't effectly work because while yes it put you as far away from the killer as the game can, it also tells the killer where you are from the moment you spawn because they can see that a shroud was used and they spawned in the corner of the map... Way to go guess who is coming for dat booty.
---
I'm not gay but 20 bucks is 20 bucks
---
Sad to report I have not been living under a rock, but more on a couch lol. I took a long break from DBD and just got back into over the weekend. Didn't even know they finally got Bill on PS4 but he my main on there now.
---
Alright well thx then bro
---
There are a billion possible spawns on all the maps, Small Game just makes it much more efficient in searching. You can glance in the direction of an area with a bunch of possible spawns and know whether you have to bother looking there or not. Plus, you are notified of killer traps. Saved me many times.
---
Pretty sure escaping gives more than wiggle points tho lmao
---
Survivor main here, Confirming a chase from healthy to hooking isn't tunneling and the only obligation your teammates have to you is to unhook you, its your job to avoid the killer.

---
have you heard of slugging?
---
Lol, its in 4k cant you see ?
---
Depends on your playstyle obviously.
---
We know there's specific special builds, like full on locker builds, anti hook builds etc that can be for the memes or actually good on some maps/vs some killers. But taking those aside, I feel like most solid builds should contain at least one of the following: an altruism perk, an exhaustion perk for chases, a perk to keep you healthy (think Inner Strength, Self-Care, Bond, even Pharmacy), and the 4th is up to your playstyle.
---
I think Borrowed Time is still top tier. Only real option against campers, allows for the late game saves or any kind of basement save. It's the one perk that consistently gets clutch value, almost every game. We'll Make It is definitely another good altruism perk.
---
Sprint Burst or Dead Hard as your exhaustion perks to get better chases. Sprint Burst to be able to set up good chases from "bad" positions, sprinting to good loops spots to start off on. Dead Hard to draw out a chase. Depends on your preference, set up or sustain. I feel like Sprint Burst gets more value for me recently, but I'm sure that's subjective.
---
I personally despise Self Care, and with the addition of Inner Strength I'm happy to see more and more people not self-caring in a corner for 32 seconds. 8 seconds for a full self heal is insane, even bypassing the mangled effect! Knowing that you might only be able to do it once per match if all the totems are done, that's still good enough. It's not like other survivors can't heal you or anything.
---
4th is your preference, I think in higher ranks it should almost always be either Iron Will or Decisive Strike. Other good options would be Resilience, Spine Chill, Unbreakable or Adrenaline imo.
---
some people did it the first week but im sure they probably bought the tiers. i got the head and chest pieces of halloween cosmetics for doctor and clown and pretty much gave up on that and the archives. im more interested in having fun playing and lost all interest in doing the challenges or rift. i feel like i have to grind so much for that and i only play casually between other games when im off work so i grinded for what i wanted, got what i wanted, and gave up on the rest. i wont be buying another pass after this one
---
Im like 80% sure this plague let you rescue on purpose.
---
Its one minute after unhook, so you can get ds after more than a minute
---
Pick a better killer
---
It's really frustrating, isn't it? Being altruistic and carrying your team and then being tunnelled and no one's interested in helping you out. If I see a teammate being tunnelled and know it'll be their death hook then I'll take a hit to help break the tunnelling if it won't be a death hook for me. The other really annoying thing I encounter a LOT is that the Killer will down me and leave me on the ground for ages, during which time I spend ages just waiting for a teammate to come over and tap me so I can get up again. I'll crawl close to them and they'll ignore me until eventually the Killer finds me on the ground and hooks me. Hooks like that could've been prevented if someone bothered to get me up during the long time that the Killer was elsewhere. I don't always use Unbreakable but I also shouldn't feel like I have to because my teammates will just leave me to bleed out. In rookie ranks I'd understand these issues occurring but I don't get how it can happen in green and even red ranks. These players should know that it's in their best interests to ensure the four of us last as long as we can because then that's more people to work on gens, take emergency hits, do unhooks ect.
---
This, OP kept smashing his head against a wall and expected it to move for him. While i agree this is pretty annoying there as no reason at all for you to be on top of a survivor while uncloaking.
---
When i play plague i don't really use her corrupt purge (unless a pool is right on my path) i play her as a sneaky M1 killer with monitor and abuse. 
---
That's probably why i don't need addons on her, as most of them strengthen her corrupt.
---
no
---
Have you tried waiting?
---
Duud, you can loop most killers just by squeeze out running around from one pallet to another. What should he do instead, switch targets and fall even more behind against the clock? You have to react to survivors mistakes, if they dont make any, how should you get 1K then??
---
So just getting another free second chance? Run that with DS, Unbreakable, Adrenaline and if you have a brain you’ll almost never die.
---
Slugging is only viable if all their other teammates are useless or if most of them are dead and it also relies on the assumption that they aren't running unbreakable.
---
It also can still be used if they miss it so after next unhook you again have to avoid a survivor for an entire minute. You can literally win a whole other chase in that amount of time
---
Everyone is talking about points. But what if I don't want his/her mercy?
---
I sometimes give a hatch when I have a really fun game (rarely) but I usually don't want killers mercy.
---
Oh are people finally starting to realize new ds is stronger than old ds? Ive been ridiculed to no end for saying this but thats fine as long as people eventually come around.
---
Lol implying there is a choice
---
I wasn't. Wraith was automatically recloaking without any input (he'd immediately re-cloak after the lightburn animation ends) and this was resulting in me being lightburned over and over again since I couldn't uncloak before being lightburned.
---
Basically if I did nothing, I was being lightburned over and over. If I tried to uncloak, I'd start the uncloaking process, get lightburned before it could complete, and auto-recloak, get lightburned again, etc. No matter what I did, I was caught in a loop of lightburn. 4 purple flashlights with batteries and streetwise and they were gathered around me [like this.](https://i.redd.it/gl3um1071jn31.jpg)
---
I've noticed this as soon as it was changed. Just never got around to making a meme about it
---
Same! And with 5-10 minute queue times with 7/10 matches disconnecting upon starting for killer only (30 second queues to a minute most for survivor and 9/10 games are good) it’s just so disheartening.
---
yeah, using 2 perk slots for such a situational thing, I think it should be quite useful. and have you ever played solo survivor lol? teammates are always useless.
---
on consoles the games is almost dead
---
glad to hear on pc heading that way
---
it will take longer because pc idiots need to take more time to understand when to quit a garbage game
---
Did you win?
---
Slugging is 10× more toxic than tunneling
---
Huntress and Rin oof
---
Last time I didn’t wiggle, the killer closed the hatch, opened the exit gate dropped me at the exit and killed me just before crawling through......
---
This happened to me about a week ago, luckily the killer caught on it was bugged and closed the hatch, i don't even know how it happened.
---
you said there was no counter, I gave you the counter. If ur tunneling I don’t think it’s a far reach to slug.
---
it literally is the counter. just because the devs don’t wanna promote slugging doesn’t mean it’s not a tactic. if it wasn’t, unbreakable wouldn’t be a perk. if you wanna tunnel someone, and you think they have ds, you slug them and wait. it’s not hard to wait for the minutes over, especially if you are giving them a fair chance to run. they should be able to get to a pallet and loop you for at least a second if you aren’t right on their ass. ds is literally the definition of fine.
---
Y'all are way too sweaty. If a survivor does well, why not give them the hatch? It's just a game.
---
It get's more reasonable if you look it as an expression of opinion rather than desire to disagree tho
---
The there piers combined they will dominate the meta and be hated by survivors everywhere good art btw.
---
Where will these be sold? And for how much?
---
Had the same bug the two times I morid people. Havent seen the animation ingame with the club yet^^.
---
Thanatophobia 32% geral/repair/sabotage speed.
---
Sloppy+thanatophobia on 8 survivors, 3 minutes heal
---
When I loop the killer so everybody can repair and in the end I get a message “f**k you” 
---
I mean I just tried my best
---
You’re completely right in your assumption.
---
Challenges sometimes just don’t complete, I’ve had the challenge “Decisive Light” bug out on me. Got the flashlight save and it didn’t count.
---
Yum
---
Slugging isnt a counter to ds if the survivor jumps in a locker then what?
---
Can we also talk about those survivor who hide when they get slug? Like, why?? Why would you rather bleed out than give last hook? It's not faster, neither give you more points, why?
---
You dare challenge me ōwõ
---
Oni
---
David could snap hags bones like a twig
---
Lol, that's the funniest part. Two of my teammates killed themselves on the first hook so when the killer caught me, I killed myself so the last one could get the hatch.
---
There is no real counter to the new DS. You either let the survivor have a full minute of doing a gen, slug them which if they have anything resembling a good team they'll just be picked up or eat the DS and enter chase act:2
---
Nurse with red hair and red dress ♥️
---
I know it kind of cucks wraith but could you not just go uncloak around a corner or something? that's what i meant, i assume you were trying to uncloak on top of them over and over and over again instead of trying something different.
---
I mean if I for some odd reason decided to chase you for 5 gens then if I give up now I've truly lost I'm at least getting the one person I targetted it's just a law at that point
---
I don't want to quit DBD. I love the game, so I want them to fix it. I would gladly play it every single day, but in its current state, it's just not possible.
---
As I said. You’re way too invested.  Look at how much time and effort you’re putting into writing lines and lines and lines of your opinion with multiple edits.   I will not read your last response and will no longer respond to you regarding this.  Relax.  Good day sir.

I play like 2 hours a day and I’m still only rank 45. If you really focus on getting the challenges done and have luck with queue times you could get pretty far.
---
Ye but i got sprint burst so see ya
---
https://youtu.be/STPCn9CqfNY?t=142 This was EXACTLY what was happening. I couldn't even move as I was being re-stunned before I could really move.
---
Most times I get a 4k as killer it's because of overly altruistic survivors like that. And face it if you're truly getting tunneled and camped, there's nothing they can do except get the objective done while you die. It is a team effort but that doesn't mean everyone should lose with you, besides you usually get hella bloodpoints for running the killer
---
UwU
---
Because I see non adrenaline users doing it, which in my mind didn't made sense
---
I don't disconnect.
---
Yeah at that point you were being a hugeeee cunt and I’ll get that kill one way or another
---
Meg moment
---
doing gens, you?
---
You could've bought just to bodies to unlock the additional members. Weapons and masks are optional.
---
Devs: We don't want to promote slugging
---
Also devs: Makes knockout and deerstalker.
---
How the hell did you hit that meg
---
But Austin Powers taught me the Judo Chop!
---
owo what's this? A-an ebony mori?! OwO
---
Yes, it trumps all killers stealth abilities.
---
I think she didn’t pull the pallet down in time idk
---
3 outta 4 har an easy game, you were their hero. Why can't people be satisfied with that? Like if the killer you looped full game had more fun then you..
---
Wraith has potential to be a top tier killer my dude
---
"Increased Feral Frenzy speed from 5 m/s to 5.2 m/s."
---
Have them find a killer they adore and play that one first. Playing killers just for their teachables can be pretty demoralizing bif you don't enjoy playing as them.
---
Looping on mobile.
---
yeah, but they made a seperate "classic ghost face" which is nearly identical to the main ghost face, just slightly whiter. so being pretty similar hasnt been a concern so far
---
It's a hatchet you could get at any hardware store for a tenner.
---
I'm exactly the opposite. Did the survivors do absolutely nothing and get destroyed? No hatch for you. If a survivor was good at being chased and doesn't wiggle then I will always give them the hatch.
---
Haha I just completed making a video meme which a similar premise. Uploading in 22 hours from now.
---
in other situations, sure, but if you know *for a fact* that a survivor has DS, then slugging them is the only logical play.  if someone says its toxic they're just being a troll.
---
I’m okay with this watch this moonwalk to you would be the funniest shit
---
Top Tier Killer but [flashlights are his kryptonite](https://youtu.be/STPCn9CqfNY?t=142)
---
Unreal how people are calling for spoilers, knowing that the Demogorgon exists and what it is basically spoils the entire first season so complaining about a burnt one is quite funny.
---
There is a dbd facebook page? oh god
---
We are the masters of buffoonery
---
Am I the only one who waits to claim as many rift challenges at a time as possible? Feels more cathartic like that (like those old 120k bloodpoints dailies)
---
Good to know I guess
---
That wraith was a dummy uncloaking in the open against a flashlight
---
from playing him and playing against him. Its definitly the lunge attack, Many people try and use it, miss and waste more time
---
The members of Legion are from the 90s. Killers can be taken from different time eras by the Entity. Plague herself is from babylonian times and Huntress was from the world war. 8-28-96 is when the photo of them was taken.
---
The real story is someone actually using babysitter. I've never seen it used except by people chasing the adept steve achievement
---
When I get moried by a clown I always send them a message asking “yum?”
---
I think your best option is to find a full 4 man group you can queue with.  that should hopefully result in faster matchmaking.  there is /r/dbdLFG and a few discords you can use for finding SWF groups.
---
Does not justify for him being low tier....
---
I'm not Rank 1 but I love playing Clown. I mainly use Ruin, Dying Light, Pop Goes The Weasel and BBQ.
---
Best addons for me are the Ether bottles (to increase the toxic clouds duration once the Survivor is affected by it), Flask of Bleach which causes the Survivor that is hit by the cloud to be Hindered (Slowed movement speed), or the Solvent Jug (to cause the Survivor to be Exhausted, I use this to counter their potential Dead Hard)
---
The way I like to play is to try to force Survivors towards the end of the game to 3 gen themselves (make sure the last 3 gens are as close together as possible). The way I do this is just to do with chasing them around, when it comes to 4/5 total Generators on the map (1/2 left for them to complete) I wont worry as much about the 2 furthest away as much. Its risky and takes some practicing but playing as Clown against Survivors when you have 3 Gens all within close proximity is horrible as his bottles give you so much control.
---
Main thing I find with him is using your Bottles to force a player in a particular direction and throwing it to be ahead of them so they run into it. Also you can use them to reduce being looped by 'sort of' blocking off routes/loops with his gas cloud.
---
Understand completely how it is considered toxic.  I play killer and surv equally. My point is why get offended if they want you to get offended? When survs T-bag together its not toxic so why does T-bagging killers have to be. Let's all END this double standard on T-bagging and LET ALL KILLERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO T-BAG. T-BAGGING IS NOT A HATE CRIME EMOTE. T-BAGGING IS A CELEBRATION EMOTE. END THE DISGRACEFUL VIEW ON T-BAG LIVES NOW CAUSE ALL T-BAG LIVES MATTER.
---
do ur thingy trapper machingy
---
Yessir, milkman
---
Kids today just don't know good sportsmanship. Can't act right when they get a win no wonder they can't handle a loss.
---
Only reason i'd ever run Distortion is for the scratch mark removal: If the killer has Nurse's you can tap heal and just run away without leaving scratch marks, but since it has so small amount of tokens it's not really worth it.
---
Using a perk slot to counter BBQ and Nurse's is silly when there's already simple counters to both which do not require a perk slot.
---
If you don't want to track using Predator, then may I suggest Bloodhound?
---
The words "on max" appear nowhere in this comment thread.
---
They’re not being a cunt, they’re doing their job for the team so they can finish gens. On the killer’s side, yeah, get your kill, you’re not being a dick either, just securing what you can.
---
However, as a killer main, if a survivor is looping me pallet-to-pallet and I keep chasing him while he’s in his rhythm, that’s almost a guaranteed game loss. Much better to break off and try to catch someone else in a bad position for a free hit, and then next time I jump on the original guy he’ll hopefully be in a worse position as well.
---
Billy for the perks Freddy if you wantbto play as that killer one day.
---
Im actually using it to track them better in chase or to split pressure (since its really fucking easy to find them with it) but its such a pain to use a killer without him
---
Why would you teabag? Teabagging is for stupid idiots that like wasting precious time, when you could be mindgaming. Assuming that every survivor that can flashlight save and run a killer around is a really hivemind way of thinking.
---
Its interesting but a range add on is pretty much mandatory
---
True it is but sometimes we don’t all keep cool tempers (me😂)
---
Sadly with bugs like this the survivor might not even be in the game anymore :/
---
I had the hook bug (hook a survivor but they show up as downed, no hook/bleedout progress) and the survivor had already died on hook on their screen and moved on to the next game while i was stuck and had to DC.
---
You look like a complete dumbass right now
---
Not really true tbh. He’s actually pretty skilled, which is what makes the toxicity more infuriating for the killers he did it to.
---
Blood echo oni perk desc when hooking a survivor, all other injured survivor suffer from hemorhage until healed and the exhaustion effect for 45 sec. My question is if the injured survive healed would the exhaustion status effect be remove too?
---
Looks like normal swf team to me
---
You aren't meant to complete it with casual play.  It is explicitly designed to "encourage" (*force*) you to pay for the tiers you didn't get.
---
The race thing was just so in your face by the end of the show, it just kinda felt spite filled. Scream is my favorite slasher franchise, and I'd much prefer that over some issues to do with race.
---
I had no problem with a primarily black cast. I know most people hate everything that came from the season, but I actually liked the lead guy. I even liked the motive Tyga had to put on the mask, but damn, not every white person had some low key animosity towards Africa. Americans. Things like this are one of the reasons racism is still kicking around today, and it's disgusting. I just wanted some more damn Scream.
---
Sorry for the rant, but I just don't like stereotyping due to race. Caucasian does not equal racist.
---
I'm with Luigi on this one
---
Ill usually spasm out and swing my weapon, if they still resist then they perish, but if they come to their senses they live
---
Funny because you comment this on every video they post lol
---
The dev's will announce it on Twitter
---
Are you sure they're actually being altruistic or just farming each other? The latter's a death sentence for a team. Or they're perhaps just timing saves poorly and making other poor decisions like healing at the hook unless it's super fast healing. Usually when I'm the Killer the Survivors are very altruistic and smart about it because when I go to check the location of the unhooking they're both gone or just hiding really well.
---
Possessed not mutated
---
Yea it tottaly better to wait to see if thats devour hope and one shotting + slugging 
---
Ah.  In my opinion scratch marks aren't that broken.  
---
The only thing they did to kind of ruin scratch marks for survivors is making them visible against the Legion in their Frenzy when you have Fixated equipped.
---
You know, that perk that's supposed to let you see your scratch marks exactly as the killer sees them?

In the games current state, slugging is optimal for nost circumstances. 
---
Post is TLDR so im sorry if my comment isn't relevant to you.
---
Me right now too, just got camped and tunneled by a Wraith and went down to NOED at the end.

If you don't wanna use Hex perks, consider Pop Goes The Weasel to gain more gen control instead.

Amazing counterpoint. Survivors need to do their objective, wow! Also doesn't apply if there's one survivor left.

Yes let’s waste a perk slot on something that shouldn’t even be a thing Wraith needs to uncloak faster then he gets light burned
---
WuW
---
A lot of survivors tell me I’m one of the nicest killers they’ve ever met. I feel really bad for people so most of the time I just end up farming with the survivors or helping them with challenges, daily’s, and achievements. There’s always that one survivor that always body blocks pallets or hooks and stuff like that, you know just being generally annoying while the rest of us are farming. Then I just hook them while the rest of the survivors tbag at the hook lmao
---
So surprised people don't complain about McMillan maps like Suffoaction Pit where there's like 4 gyms interconnected in the middle of the map. Coldwind ain't got shit on those.

The Hillbilly stole Freddy's hitbox.

 So we shouldn’t down multiple and slug. So we should allow 3 to be on gens and have no pressure. Very smart suggestion

Thank you mister talented, i love you

Aw. I'm Bowser because I will always hook the last survivor.

Omg a replica gen would be so cute, or yeah straight up a mask would make so much more sense.

Survivors shouldn't have to run multiple perks just to counter one gameplay mechanic common to call killers. That screams of major fundamental game imbalance.

Change loop directions for faster endings, dont respect pallets. Dont follow them to long, switch your target if they got to many options for save loops. Learn about mindgames. Use you power, (traps,hatchets..., in a chase if you can) lead them into unsave direction ( where you already broke pallets for an example) most importantly focus on what other survivors do while you are in a chase. It can save your game to interupt a chase to stop survivors from finishing a gen. Remember the window positions on the maps. You dont want to loop around there. Always remember where you broke pallets. Wait for survivors to use dead hard if you can before you swing. Try to remember all exhaustion perks the survivors use. Avoid picking up survivors before 1 min after unhook. (Also dont fall for the locker forcegrap)
---
Learn to play with hiding your red stain and moonwalking on highwalls to secure hits. After all its just practise
---
&gt;Survivors shouldn't have to run multiple perks just to counter one gameplay mechanic common to call killers. That screams of major fundamental game imbalance.
---
Survivors are so strong they don't have to run perks at all and still have the upper hand against killers in most scenarios. Adding some perks to counter certain killer playstyles hardly a problem.

Slenderman anyone?

Hey did you make/photoshop that?

oof that poor oni keys are so retarded
---
It's one of the most efficient ways to slowing the game down and getting other survivors off gens to come help their team, might not be fun but it you actually played killer having the gens pop in the matter of minutes, and in some cases seconds given toolboxes/repair speed perks and if you aren't running ruin, it isn't fun either. There are multiple perks to fight against slugging just as there are multiple perks to help against gens popping. Stop crying.
---
No, i think i saw it somewhere else and decided to put it to good use.
---
I’m scared of huntresses now
---
Happy cake day
---
It's called "your teammates getting people up"
---
if someone is down for multiple minutes *that is the team's fault*
---
I understand that and I do play killer as well. That doesn't make it less unfun for survivors. As I said in an earlier comment, survivors shouldn't have to run multiple perks just to counter one gameplay mechanic common to all killers. That's a huge indicator of major game imbalance.
---
I’ll just stick to kicking these weird bone shrines

You don't have to because what you're describing doesn't happen at all

Well its 10am here! So i would say it was worth posting :3

Im down for an old mansion map, yard with creepy gates and stuff

HAHAHA! Well done!
---
I’m on PS4. I can only loop low rank killers. Once you hit higher ranks with killers that can mind game, looping becomes way harder with the controller.
---
&gt; In a coordinated group it's easier to deal with but as a solo or duo it's way worse.
---
Here is how I deal with slugging killers in solo queue: 
---
If he slugs someone, I continue to work on my generator until that slug starts moving again which should indicate that he is at 95% recovery bar. Tapping someone up instead of healing all the way through dying state is the best way to play against a slugging killer. 
---
If the killer finds me working on the generator, I'll just try to loop him for as long as I can while a 3rd teammate picks up the 1st teammate. Solo queue is bad because survivors skill level isn't the highest considering how easy it is to rank up. When people climb ranks and start versing killers that know a little about the game, these survivors are doomed because all they did was hide and repair generators.
---
Here is an advice: Play killer, try to slug survivors, learn from what good teams will do to you, learn how you managed to slug all 4 survivors, which mistakes they made and apply that to your survivor gameplay.
---
Is it just you two survivors during EGC?
---
No, I didn't say to have no pressure and allow gen rushing. That's a pretty unfair read of my post.
---
This I agree with. What do you think would need to change?
---
I did all challenges and I’m on 66 now. I’m guessing around 100 hours since it came out, hard to estimate
---
sLuGgInG iS tOxIc
---
Not slugging and having multiple down at once means that 3 can be on gens. Which is no pressure.
---
They went with the most odd choice here like what? 
---
Like what next, a bear trap?
---
He had 3 of us up there and waited till NOED was active. Not a fun match at all.
---
either way the hit would'vee not gone through tho
---
still don’t get it why the terrace doesn’t have an opening to jump down...they added a hook there when killers cried for half a year yet its impossible to cut some wood...pfff
---
I dont like the limitation on swf because 1. This isnt a competitive game 2. If your a lower rank grouping with a higher ranked friend then you should totally be prepared to be butt fucked by a higher ranked killer.  Now as for the matchmaking I'm pretty sure the only reason it's not matching people of the same Crest color is que times I'd agree to that type of matching if que times weren't long enough as survivor.  I play survivor red ranks on PC in the US and here there's way more survivors than killers to an exceptional degree.  My killer queue times are nothing but personally when I play killer and get low ranks survivors it allows me to be way more chill.

Old DS only had one awfully situational counter, which was dribbling. Every survivor could get it no matter what, and you wouldn't even know to dribble non-Obsession survivors (it was possible to time it right and dribble non-Obsession DS as well, but it was even more situational). And non-Obsession DS even meant you wasted more time carrying the survivor before they went free. Dribbling also had counter-counters, such as bodyblocking. 
---
The stun duration has not increased, or rather the distance the survivor can make after DS hasn't, a common misconception. The grasp escape animation now takes considerably longer to play out than it did in the past, creating a period of at least a second during which the survivor cannot move. So much so that Trapper can actually hold a survivor hostage again by stepping into his own trap while carrying them, in the basement or a corner of the map, being able to catch up before they can make it anywhere (this can be used to farm STBFL or Remember Me tokens).
---
The counters to new DS are simply not tunnelling, and slugging, which are a lot more reliable and managable than dribbling. If you do not tunnel the survivor off hook but chase other survivors, that either means the 60 seconds will have run out by the time you down the unhooked survivor again, or it will mean that you have chased, downed and hooked another survivor, and then chased and downed the first survivor again, all in the matter of under a minute. Not only does this mean you are most likely already in a winning position a DS stun would not change much about, but it also means that their DS is definitely not active for 60 seconds anymore, but at most 10-20, a duration you can easily slug them out for. And the more time is left on their DS, the faster it means you have done all of that, and the less of an impact waiting out the couple more seconds will have on the round.
---
If you do tunnel off hook without a chase, or if the survivor throws themselves at you, you can either simply slug them and go chase other survivors and still get value out of the free down, with them being taken out of the game for a good 30 seconds, and another survivor too having to spend time running to them and healing them up, or you can simply pick them up and eat the DS, which gets it out of the way and really doesn't do much more than a pallet stun would have done for them either. You are regularly right back in chase with them, there's no reason to be as deadly scared of a DS stun as many players are.
---
That said, I do think there could be a few Quality-of-Life changes for the perk: reduce its timer to 20 seconds, but if the survivors goes down during those 20 seconds, DS remains active indefinitely until picked or healed up off the ground; DS activates after every unhook, so up to two times; DS is disabled once exit gates are opened (so it doesn't activate if unhooked when exit gates are already open, and if the exit gates are opened after you are unhooked, it is then disabled too).
---
Well yes, but actually no. not really. Most killers when played to their max potential will still be better than Wraith. Good survivors won’t lose against Wraith
---
As long as there was one survivor who was doing gens, as much of an arse this guy was, it is not considered holding the game hostage. If all survivors were stuck up there and he refused to do anything then it would be Holding the Game Hostage.
---
They need to make the staircase wider so as to prevent body blocking.
---
Please make a bloody quentin
---
Right. I go for the the win; but if I am not only losing but the chased survivor is also being a dick, then I go for "the pain". Bottom line is that if your/your team's goal is to try and make my game unenjoyable, well, as the saying goes...
---
***Misery loves company.***
---
&gt;The matchmaking system is not working as it should be, this is evident as some rank 10-16 killers are being matched with teams of rank 1-5 survivors.
---
Do you even know how matchmaking works? 
---
Rank 10 killers should be going against survivors all the way to rank 4 according to the algorithm. 
---
&gt;To combat this, Survivors should only be able to group with other survivors of the same Rank Crest Color. 
---
So if I manage to bring a friend to DBD, I can't play with him until I derank or he reaches red ranks? Do you have friends? 
---
&gt;Also, they should be matched with killers of the same rank crest color too. Thoughts?
---
This will lead to even longer queue times. Imagine having to wait for 4 survivors, the same "crest" as you, pressing the "find lobby" button at the same time as you did.
---
I wasn't asking for advice. I do understand how to play the game. I have 600 hours and am currently rank 2, two pips from 1. My killer rank is purple as well, which I play less but still am well practiced at. What you said still does not make slugging for minutes at a time less unfun for those players to deal with as they sit on the ground unable to engage with the game. I purposefully won't do it when I play killer because I think it's an asshole thing to do based on my assessment in the OP. I still get multiple kills each game and often 4k.
---
Must be nice playing against potatoes. All survivors have to do is turn corners and Oni can't do shit. and for the normal slam, he can just be pallet looped. From my experience on both sides, Oni seems very weak now at rank 1.
---
Do dbl bp always coincide with events such as solstice and Halloween
---
Great, I wish we could play against this version. That real Spirit always kicks the shiet out of me, when on the chase. This one would be cool,  tryin to escape ;D
---
No TrU3Ta1ent fans generally state unfactual statements like their fact when honestly it’s just them being bad at the game.
---
Distance
---
Good work keep it up! Practice to perfection :)
---
Thanks OP, I appreciate this
---
Yup. That's why I barely play this game anymore. No fun for killers (high ranks)
---
You still get distance passively.
---
Have they ever skipped these events or should I expect to seem them soon
---
Sounds like overall you're getting matched up with weak players. Don't know what kind of Freddy players you've been going against but he's the strongest killer in the game right now according to stats they released recently. I can confirm this is true, whenever I'm getting trounced all night and just feel like getting a 4K I switch to Freddy. He's kind of like easy mode on killer right now.
---
I tried to post at a time where most people are online which means I have to stay up till the early morning to post. I'm glad you got to see this and have a great day. :D
---
Aww googon is so cute uwu
---
I have never had a killer give hatch if I don't wiggle. At least with wiggling I have a chance to escape.
---
Wait, were you robbed of your endgame collapse challenge!?!
---
Yeah, but just say they aren’t trying to hit you, for example, a race to the hatch, a window. I say window, because if you get hit right before you vault, you would dead hard into the wall
---
I think the hook stage clock should decrease as rank goes up. At higher ranks the meta is to sit on gens as long as possible before saving because gen times are so short compared to hook stages. If the 3 other survivors are on separate gens while someone is hooked, the killer can only chase one, so the other two can have a shit load of gen time before they have to save.
---
This is why killer slug - you need multiple points of pressure because people being on hook barely matters at higher ranks.
---
To balance it, lower rank games would have longer hook stages because people tend to be scared and clueless and survivors there tend to hook suicide.
---
And the hook timer will pause across all ranks if the killer is within a certain (and pretty small radius) of the hooked survivor unless in chase and unless it's end game.
---
Ofc SWF and general shitty matchmaking would make this hard to implement, but along with how maps are generally unfair for killers, the time gap between gens and hook stages is why higher rank play is so tough for killers
---
"tOTalLy UnViaBLe KIllEr NoW" 
---
yea except for the good *tracking*, *insta down*, and *map pressure*. totally unusable now
---
Aw thanks! And thank you for the silver! It is my first ever award lol &lt;3 but u deserve it too!
---
Trapper H and Meg tista betrayed Claudette Orton while Dwight Flair watches.
---
I have a feeling they might rework it into something else. Maybe borrowed time status. I still use it to get another loop or get to window quicker.
---
Robot hitler! Robot hitler!
---
What was he trying to convey?
---
This would be old MOM without the requirements on an exhaustion perk.
---
"In short order" does not equal "instantly". Good killers don't take long to find their next chase target, even when versus good survivors. I'm just shy of rank one currently. I'm not just saying random stuff for funsies. It seems like you're just reading what you want to hear for the sake of argument rather than what I'm actually saying from the OP.
---
"Gen rushing" aka, the survivors doing literally their main task: Run Ruin or Overwhelming Presence to slow them down.
---
You can still use it that way
---
You can’t kill max prestige Claudette /s
---
You think BHVR could actually implement that, I'm 100% certain itd end up being a joke, theres a good chance, if it did work, that itd cause you to fly into walls and be useless half the time
---
*proceeds to boop le snoot*
---
Shy of rank 1 is very different from consistent rank 1 for a while. The amount of shit we have had to deal with yet you want no pressure. You might not need pressure but if you’re playing a basic m1 killer you won’t win.
---
Nah because if it’s out of chase it won’t activate
---
You stole my meme you fuckwit why would it be in 4K
---
Thank you! Quality over quantity. I have only released three video memes so far but keep an eye out! I really love this little hobby I've got going on. I want to encourage others to make content that requires more effort in this subreddit.
---
Yeah you can sue it but it PASSIVELY ALWAYS gives you a third hit is strong mate. I don’t think you understand what I’m getting at. Sure you can use it at your own leisure for the right time, which I can say won’t always happen. 
---
Most the time it will be used Passively. There’s no baiting it as a killer no really counters you just have to accept every survivor now has three hits to down 100%.
---
Only with skilled players. To the average player (someone who just is randomly playing her as the comment suggests) she will be significantly worse than other killers.
---
They should adjust it to average gameplay or it will become a chore and not fun. I see some many people farming because of this.
---
Tbh, a bear trap would be more fitting than this.
---
Well thank you
---
I posted literally just a screenshot of a message I sent in a discord group chat and got 1.3k, so I’m pretty sure you have a bigger chance 😂 but even if you didn’t this time, don’t quit just yet. It’s just numbers at the end
---
Thank you for engaging in constructive conversation about the topic. These are great ideas. Fast clock for higher ranks would definitely increase pressure. You have a very good understanding of the game from both sides.
---
It did show up! My friend likes it and said it’s actually good quality. I got him the brutality skull hoodie for what it’s worth.
---
Yeah, Wraith could definitely better. Still, stealth is anything but useless. If anything it's an alternative to the chase potential - if you manage to pull it off.
---
I’d like to see a depiction of a sharkasaurus
---
Where can I buy!??!
---
Nothing compared to the r/ShapeStunNoise
---
I got him the brutality skull hoodie for what it’s worth, so not the same one as the trapper one.
---
It was obviously a lag switch or your internet dropping.
---
Love the way you've drawn trapper!
---
Vomit hentai anyone?
---
I've been rank one many times. Reset was 4 days ago and I've only played on two of those days. I was never suggesting no pressure. Another user made a suggestion for shortened hook timers on higher ranks and I fully agree with that. I'd also agree with Ruin being in the game at higher ranks by default without a perk for it.
---
Now waiting for DbD to do a line of magical girl skins for the female killers. And Clown.
---
It'd be weird, but it'd be more recognisable to DBD with Trapper being the main boi. And it actually looks like the in game Traps unlike the hatchet
---
Okay I have an actual question, I’m a rank one survivor and I love the map Backwater Swamp, but apparently a lot of people hate it? Can someone who hates it tell me why you do? Personally I love it
---
&gt;Duud, you can loop most killers just by squeeze out running around from one pallet to another. What should he do instead, switch targets and fall even more behind against the clock? You have to react to survivors mistakes, if they dont make any, how should you get 1K then??
---
Yes, switch targets because the person you're chasing isn't doing a gen. Switch targets to somebody that is working on a gen and you're actually preventing gens from being done vs having no pressure for committing to a chase for too long. 
---
Lots of high level killers (fungoose'/Scott jund/tofu), advocate sometimes ditching a chase if a running survivor goes to an area that is easy to runt he killer just switch targets. Fungoose on his stream/YouTube talks about this a lot both as killer and survivor. As killer he says you should be satisfied with an m1 or a good pallet after a 15 second chase and to not be afraid to switch targets after. As survivor the most common mistake he notices from the killer's he plays against is they chase survivors for too long, letting the other 3 survivors do gens in peace. 
---
Scott jund also talks about it a bit in his recent analysis video (https://youtu.be/GXiAIwUCNlc), whenever a survivor runs to a God window/strong part of the map so he advocates switching targets.
---
Its a really good drawing. Just a little criticism: the Spirits arm looks out of place in front of the Oni, due to the oni being larger, making him appear in the foreground, rather than the background.
---
Not much you can do honestly, other then iron will.

Read what I wrote. Killer lobbies are even worse.

Bro i could help you out if you want because I play on ps4 also and the same thing happens to me
---
I honestly want more none human killers like Greg.
---
He isn’t unviable, it’s just weird to not be able to turn after anymore.
---
NGL, I was expecting a Green Goblin meme here.
---
Hacking, report and move on.
---
Survivors being dicks. Nothing new, nothing to see here.
---
This won't ever change, it's in their nature. There are just a handful of specimen that do not have or want to rely on cancer gameplay, it's just how it is.
---
Are you saying killers are weak compared to survivors?
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Work smarter not harder; you know what you're doing. I've had a lot of flops with my video memes but every now and then I make one that just works. I'm also getting better at editing as I teach myself through every submission. The biggest obstacle for me is trying to find a balance between creating high-standard content but also making it short enough so others will care to watch (i.e short attention span).
---
I\`ll DS her somewhere other than her shoulder ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yep. Killers NEED to [4K to pip at high ranks] (Otz gets a 4K and DEPIPS) and it's fucking annoying when I down the last survivor then suddenly ***TACTICAL DISCONNECT, INCOMING!*** "GG EZ LMAO BABY KILLER XD"
---
OP: IM JUST A POOR BOY
---
ME: *... I need no sympathy*
---
You can also see the beam narrow and focus. That means you're doing is correctly
---
Blaspheme, giving up ones life for another is never the wrong thing, as sacrifice for salvation is toatally fair, killing yourself in front of the last survivor is a dick move, but if you know the last survivor has the ability to escape and you're the only thing in his way, impeding him is even more bm
---
Tell the killer not to slug the 3rd guy because he's sweaty for the 4k then. You best believe if I'm slugged on the ground and my buddy finds hatch I'm dc'ing. Fuck your 4k
---
SWFs aren't bad. When they act like toxic assclowns and/or screw over randoms, then it's bad.
---
Imagine thinking reddit is better than facebook.
---
That’d be a great idea!
---
All killers have tools to stop survivors from looping them forever. If you're getting looped for more than ~40 seconds, in most cases you'd better switch target because the survivor you're facing is just better than you, and keeping the chase is just throwing the game.

Classic survivor mentality there. Unbreakable is a thing. Also you do that I'm just DCing before your partner can jump in. Hah! I countered your counter!
---
Ill take your entire stock

Love it. And thanks for drawing the Spirit like an actual killer and not all sexualized :) it's awesome to see a good piece of artwork with her in it instead of her ass
---
Woah, nice job!!
---
I really would love to buy some, take my money! (:
---
This is the ultimate sign of sportsmanship towards the other survivor, not the sweaty killer that wants to leave you slugged for 24 hours while he tries to find the 4th survivor.
---
Example of that please
---
Everything he says he demonstrates on stream
---
Am I the bad guy here
---
I feel like he kept you hostage because he was keeping you in the match but I feel like every one technically does that because they have to do gems in order to live and that takes time but this guy wasn’t doing anything he just kept running to that corner and wasn’t letting you just end the match
---
Yeah I feel that shit, but I see both sides to this it's a game of who loses the least
---
&gt;Classic survivor mentality there. Unbreakable is a thing. Also you do that I'm just DCing before your partner can jump in. Hah! I countered your counter!
---
Closing the hatch is also a thing. 
---
Hook the 3rd survivor and the killer still has more chance of finding the hatch than the 4th survivor if it hadn't spawned already. If hatch was already out, locate it, hook the 3rd guy and b-line towards it. 
---
Slugging in 2019 for a 4k is stupid.
---
Exactly. It's a flawed mechanic and toxic survivors know it. In what way is a full minute of immunity supposed to be fair to the killer?
---
The only goal for the survivor is to finish gens. I don't understand this hate for "gen rushing"...
---
You're upset that survivors are trying to win the game as fast as possible?
---
That's like getting mad that the killer is killing instead of just... hanging around and being spooky? Like what else would you have the survivors do?
---
Should they run around just for fun?
---
Wow....
---
Well invested time, take your up votes!
---
Eh, for me, it works about 30% of the time. But the majority of the time, you're right, they just hook you immediately, or they slug you, slam the hatch and then hook you.
---
When I play killer I almost always give the last survivor the hatch if they don't struggle (but I play killer a lot less now since the challenges, and I find that, usually get less pissed off playing as a survivor than a killer, even if I have a lot of bad games as survivor)
---
you monster
---
This is only true if slugging isn't involved to cheese the hatch spawn.  I refuse to let anyone hold my games hostage not even for a full bleedout timer.  The notion that killers have the right and they do believe it's a right to defeat me but refuse to end my game for the next several minutes so they can use me as a floor prop and continue playing their game is every bit as entitled as what this post complains about.  If survivor DC's on a hook or midchase so their friend can jump in that's scummy and lame the killer earned their 4K at that point.  But if you're using me as an inanimate floor cosmetic fuck your 4K I hope they get the hatch.
---
finger crossed
---
I run Empathy and I just go to the place the killer injured the first survivor, and the ruin totem is generally in that same area or near the closest gen. Killers always check their totem first thing, and seem to run into a survivor close by 90% of the time.
---
Thanks 💙
---
You got dailies. We've got dailies. On-top that, challenges. I'm sick to death of this victim shit in this sub. Playing fair and not being a total dick is how I pride myself in playing this game. I'm legacy, so for you to assume that all survivors that play decent are teabagging assholes hits a chord with me. I get it. Your a killer. You feel outnumbered especially with good swfs. But when you have to go solo in a match with rank1 selfish oblivious survivors against a decent killer, you'll feel the pain.
---
No, but I can try to get prints of it! I have other work too on my Instagram @painterly_witch :)
---
I love otz but he also slugs and one hooks a lot. Which is fine for his playstyle cause he doesn't care about ranks as much. A
---
I don't do shitposts, only video memes. I'm glad my film degree wasn't a complete waste of time as I learned to edit. They take a while as I have to go frame by frame to track the characters on the original video but if I can make a video where you forget that there was another video behind the Dead by Daylight characters, I've done my job. Bonus if it actually turns out great!
---
Imagine being in the cornfield and seeing the red balloon float up 😆
---
posting it again with a different title won’t get you more upvotes
---
“Hanging around and being spooky” lmao
---
Oh my god fuck off. Slugging for the 4K is not holding the game hostage. It is not toxic.
---
If you don't like that killers do that. tell bhvr to add more conditions other than one survivor being alive
---
From what I know, I’m pretty sure it’s mostly killers that hate it. Very survivor-favored map, with plenty of tall brush to mask survivors and getaways. I’ve lost a few chases myself because someone turned a small corner and squat in one of many of the talk shrubs.
---
He can't afford to get a real one, just let him pretend ok? Stop bullying!
---
Classic killer mentality here.  You aren't entitled to use your defeated opponents as floor props while you selfishly continue playing your game.  Have a considerate thought in your head and remember for a second what it feels like to be slugged for several minutes.  It's fucking cancer.  The entitlement over hatch cheese slugs is pathetic in 2019 considering you can find and close the thing now.  Devs added that to streamline these scenarios and end games efficiently but that isn't good enough for you.  You have to thoughtlessly drag out games just because you turn in your bed at night at the thought that a form of counterplay exists.  God forbid I don't beat them to the hatch even though I'm faster and probably know where it was already.  In that hell scenario I only won the game and killed 3....the horror.
---
Get over it dude you don’t need to 4K every match if the survivor wants to kill themselves or dc to give their teammate hatch it’s not that big of a deal you just complain too much
---
I guess that makes more sense, it is kinda tough to do good as killer on that map. Although it’s a dream when I get this map as Trapper
---
I like your fake righteous bullcrap here.  
---
So, Because I hate toxic survivors I am a killer main?  Bad guess buckaroo.  I killer only for the challenges and dailies.  The wait time is beyond to long to humor doing it any further.  
---
So, unlike you, I actually know the pain of toxic rank 1 survivors.  Zero chance you do, you are obviously full of shit.  
---
Also thanks, this is even more support for how you deserve to be camped for being a toxic survivor.
---
their matchmaking system is fucked for new players and not fair at all
---
Tier IV
---
Ngl if some guy used Unbreakable in a slug race I am downing and hooking them.
---
New perk, makes all hits that would put you in the injured state automatically transfer onto another survivor.
---
Depends. If you’re going against optimal survivors, you are not going to win. If you’re going against rank 20 dwights, then yeah, you’re gonna win.
---
You’re teammates can still heal you. Slugging is a real tactic. You being bate is for the other survivor is a tactic, cause you’re still in the game. Leaving the game so you can change the out come of your other teammates is a problem. You can counter slugging. You can’t counter a dc
---
I was watching Stone Cold Steve Austin and Vince McMahon segments before I finally committed to making this video meme. There's just so much opportunity to make CONTENT with WWF, WWE clips. 😂
---
The movie is called Drive thru. Was not in theaters but a fun movie I like it because it reminds me of sweet tooth.
---
You are so fucking dramatic oh my fucking god
---
I would get this tattooed.
---
AHHH that scarier than the actual feeling Demo imagine that thing coming out of nowhere yelling UWU
---
It’s unsportsmanlike. I don’t need a 4k every game but don’t take it from me cause you’re too much a bitch to lose
---
Plagues incest lamp like that would be spikey
---
It was honestly the cherry on top. Well done! :)
---
Pigs dash or huntress hatchet
---
I feel bad for people that get hit by his mori.
---
Yeah! It's so sweaty! Just like survivors who try to save the one person hooked when gets are 99d. Stop being so sweaty and leave. You are not entitled to a 4 person escape! Stop dragging out the game!
---
Incest lmao
---
My paypal is ready.
---
Thanks, man!
---
Luigi time
---
Hmm that would be painful just the chunk of metal that’s spikey :(
---
You’re amazing for this 😂
---
What absolute drivel. I'm sorry. But you do not understand the fundamentals of assymetrical gameplay. Sure, survivors can be complete morons and not have patience in taking someone off the hook. But the more players there are the higher the chances of you all surviving are, plus the extra BP you get for taking the hit.
---
Ooo huntress hatchet would hurt
---
Beautiful! :)  
---
Would love to see more of this.
---
How can you tell which perks the killer has activated? Does it show up on your screen at all? For example, knowing when he has BBQ and Chili, or NOED. Do you just kinda figure it out or is it on the screen anyway?
---
lol im a bitch ass too
---
*Uhhh okay bye Frank*
---
Gen rushing is a desing problem the people angry with that is angry with the game not the players
---
God imagine the drill tearing through your hand.
---
Pennywise, the *DANCING* clown!
---
Yeah, I'm going to try to pick a gal up at the bar using that line this weekend.
---
Not sure if everyone knows this but you’re supposed to go for every perk in the bloodweb. Even if it’s a perk you don’t want. Because once you tier 3 it, it’s out of your bloodweb permanently. I pretty much got Iron Will instantly on my Nea because I had all the other perks gone.
---
Keys seem fair
---
I run NOED on my Myers sometimes. It's cheesy and unneeded yes, but you'd be surprised how many exit gate teabaggers I hit with it who think they're save since I'm in Tier 2. 
---
On a side note I wanna try Perma EW3 Myers with NOED, Haunted Grounds, Make Your Choice, and Iron Maiden sometime just as a joke.
---
haha im guessing ure new to the game. itll wear off eventually. just play it during the day as much as u can befoe nighttime to speed up the getting sick of it process
---
not necessary over though? lets not forget that those matches happen once in a blue moon (has happened to me like once as survivor and twice as killer) 
---
also, what's wrong with losing 1 match? if you win every match, then there's something wrong with the game
---
Honestly it might be your best bet to take it down and repost it cause it will be downvoted and just comment spammed that its wrong
---
I didn’t accuse you of losing a match and if killing yourself to help your teammate is scummy then slugging is being less than scum just don’t play like a dickhead and maybe just maybe people won’t dc but if you keep leaving people on the ground for large amounts of time while you search for the last survivor of course they are going to leave
---
survivors: PLEASE GIVE A DC PENALTY
---
also survivors: we have the ABSOLUTE right to DC if the killer has the audacity to try and win with the most common sense way within the confines implemented by the developers
---
that just translates to "totem will not spawn near gens, don't check near gens." idk man.
---
Ohhh soooo intentional 🤣
---
3 scapes is a victory in my book
---
Don’t kill my vibe lol
---
Experience, mostly. If the killer comes right for you despite you being motionless after a hook, or a hatchet crosses the map and lands a foot from your head right after a hook, that's a guaranteed bbq.
---
Noed is a hard one to predict. But if they're not offering any gen pressure and their build is not helping them during the gen phase of the game, it's reasonable to expect a late-game build with remember me or blood warden as well as noed.
---
Your gen point is laughable Toy.  Gens popping is core gameplay.  You beating the opponent but refusing to end their game isn't.  Name another video game that works this way.  You lose but the opponent can force you to watch them play their game.  Go ahead I'll wait.
---
Unbreakable gets you up once.  That doesn't do shit in this scenario.  You've been playing killer long enough to know how 3rd man cheese hatch slugs work.  You'll find them again especially playing that gen hostage doc you're known for and that Unbreakable doesn't mean shit.
---
4 minutes is disgraceful that you don't see that as you being a selfish dick.  Just shows you have ZERO consideration for the opponents.  I agree with dc punishments as dc'ing in general is pathetic and a huge problem in this game.  But I feel you selfish scumbags with your forced defeated opponent slugs deserve a hard asterisk as it boggles my mind that you can't acknowledge sure I see why that feels fucked up for them I just want to 4k though.  Like at the very least offer that and show you aren't a biased cartoon capable of objective thought.  Nobody holds my games hostage.  And if the shoe was on the other foot killers would be lighting this sub up 24/7 if survivors could take them out of the game but choose not to end their game.  But it's just survivor so fuck em amirite?
---
Yeah all the mud getting in there not to good ...
---
Yeah of course, I’m never gonna waste a bloodweb by not getting a perk, I wanna eventually get every perk on all my survivors.

Hillbilly chainsaw

Its for the ranks red ranks long queue de surv short of killer green ranks its the opossite

Imagine having a cold sore with one of those on your head ...
---
Goodfellas meme, I can dig it
---
Slugging isn't a dick move
---
:'(
---
Sure it isn’t bud
---
Is it a strategy though? when there's 1 objective and 1 way to finish that objective you can't really call genrushing a strategy. I agree with the second part though, being a dick in the end game chat is toxic af
---
I'm inclined to agree, the huntress addons are quality of life but I don't feel like they make a big enough difference when someone is good with her. The hachets are aimed well and hit or not, being able to throw faster doesn't matter if a person is already missing with them.
---
If you’re taking suggestions, you should make a baby dweet one!
---
I think the clowns would hurt a lot
---
Something like "EiiiiiIIIIHH"
---
Imagine a higher pitched Feng
---
With some ketchup on it :(((((
---
If I'm playing solo and getting slugged for the 4k I'll DC if the other guy picks me up just for the killer to slug me again. At that point I can't be bothered to waste another second.
---
That’s a painful one ...
---
You got talent
---
My sadness is immeasurable and my day is now ruined
---
H3 is Ethan klein I’m assuming?
---
Gen rushing is a salty killer main term. Wtf else are the survivors supposed to do?
---
Thanks you! Appreciate the updoot sir
---
I love this Idea, ima go make a new account right now and play with my red rank friends so that I can gen rush the killer
---
*Yes I understand the joke and that Halloween 3 wasn’t Micheal Myers btw, I’m not a moron*
---
Myers isn’t in H3
---
Most people will stick around in a gate indefinitely if they don't know the other surv will get out, hoping they can save them if they go down. I can't count the amount of times I've been about to just run out because im like, "Surely everyone's at a gate by now right?" and then someone goes down on the opposite side of the map from both gates. It happens
---
The first time I did that as a survivor I wasn't even mad, I just laughed the whole time.
---
Usually when i see the game is pretty much lost, I wlll just chase down the guy until I down him then I dc (i've done this like once, dont hate me)
---

Okay.  Here's hoping that's what it is.  Good luck!

You've had 3 years to do so, that's on you.

---
r/meirl

LUCKY!!!!!
---
I mean sure you can do well on hawkins but as i said earlier almost every pallet on the map can be played around very easily as killer without even breaking it. I played a game on it earlier as killer where the only pallet i had to break was in that room with 2 pallet spawns and w small staircase leading up to a small elevated platform. Brilliant description i know.
---
I mean, if a survivor is okay with No Bloodpoints, losing their item, and the DC Penalty for the hatch then let them. Its a one sided sportsmanship that hurts the survivor that DCd. Lowkey just sounds like someone is salty...
---
I wouldn’t mind the best character, Maurice as a charm.
---
Legion cause his mori and doctor cause he does blind damage which hurts more then a slice
---
HE'S JUST A POOR BOY FROM A POOR FAMILY
---
SPARE HIM HIS LIFE FROM THIS MONSTROSITY
---
*cough*
---
Apologies.
---
I’ll be honest this has been the first proper use of the Lenny face I’ve seen since like 2015/15
---
 Nice i loved it. 
---
 Only thing I noticed is after the Mori u used the wrong "Dead 💀" animation. 
---
I think it's supposed to be the other one that shows they got Mori'd
---
And he didn't even let them go just keep killing them like it's a normal game.
---
I said that because slugging tunneling and camping are all dick moves but whatever
---
If gens are being rushed and I run into a tbagging clicker, I make sure to put them in the basement and wait.
---
Impossible for low - mid level killers to deal with a stacked team of survivors, why not get what you can?
---
Be careful using sarcasm here, this sub takes everything at face value
---
Legions mori looks really painful
---
What i hear in my head when she says “we need to talk”
---
Got to experiment it for the first time after DCing against a Spirit that kept phasing back and forth from the first hooked survivor only to immediately down him again when a rescue was finally done by me. I tried to unhook while her phasing was recharging but she just walked back to the hook before he had chance to move again. 
---
Have fun bois.
---
LMAO so you get a 30 second ban for disconnecting? That's totally gonna prevent TACTICAL DISCONNECT INTO HATCH TECH or P3 claudettes DCing as soon as they find out it's the docotr.
---
They're not "dick moves" at all. This idea that unless killers play in a way that's ultimate fun for all the survivors and increases their individual chances of escape they're being "dicks" is so ridiculous
---
alright I got an idea. what if when we spawn in, no hex is active until the killer picks their own totem and presses the action button on it. that way nobody can complain :)
---
Tru3 talks about how is a 1v4 not a 1v1 and he’ll point out when the killer is 1v1ing too much
---
That’s useless. Waiting at the gate when the killer isn’t on you and you know they don’t have NOED doesn’t do shit. Actually go out and look for any injured survs that need help or fuck off so they can get hatch.
---
For No-Blink? It's all add-on based, so you can just run your preferred M1 killer perks. 
---
If you still have 1 Blink then you're still effectively a Nurse, in which case run a standard Nurse setup.
---
Well oni fuckin pulls out your tongue and hits you with a giant club. He’s my pick
---
Jane's ass is so thick, she was blocking the hatch with her cheeks 😲
---
I REALLY hate to be that guy but... I don’t think you can sell these without permission from behavior. I love them doe!
---
Nothing wrong with wanting to 4k, nothing wrong with wanting to give survivor the hatch. Like you said its just a game.
---
The thing with wiggling survivors is that they tend to wiggle off for a "legitimate escape" and sometimes even bm in the chat postgame. Not wiggling essentially communicates the survivor understands what you are trying to do
---
and thats why BL was nerfed...easy solution;)
---
Hey, dont let it get to you. 
---
Toxicity breeds toxicity. 
---
People are still gonna do it. Even when there is a penalty, i bet itll still happen. 
---
Take it in stride and laugh that the person that DCed got NO blood points. Waste of time. Completely.
---
The fckn giggity has me dead. Not even that funny.

blendettes hide in the corner all game even tho thats only like 1/8 of the entire blendette population

But billy
---
And dc’ing is different.
---
For starters, that's part way through the timer, it's not 30 seconds. But more importantly, the timer gets longer each time you do it, only decaying if you don't DC for a while. Someone who does it excessively will quickly rack up a long timeout.
---
Avoid doing any totem as well, they contribute to your ranking.
---
Came here to say this too!
---
You cant use that stats to talk about balance in 2/3 games a survivor dc in the first twenty seconds
---
I considered the nerf to BL
---
Happened to me before. Woulda gotten the 4k as opposed to a 2k if you didn’t dc, Claudette.
---
It increases with every further dc

---
Yeah well you are literally applying the same standards to survivors by complaining about them killing themselves on hook to help their teammates so you just seem like a hypocrite
---
These people are much too scared to leave the relative safety of the exit gate to go looking for those survs, ig partially because of the risk that surv will show up with a murderous beast right on their tail as soon as they leave and they wont be their to tank a hit. I don't actially do this myself this is just how it seems most of the ppl I play with seem to think, and they're gonna keep doing it mo matter what we say here cause at most like 10 ppl will see it
---
Watch out watch out watch out *mori screams in the distance*
---
Killing yourself on hook is fine. DC’ing is petty and robs the killer of sacrifice bp
---
i sometimes use it, but TBH, its usually for the movement speed.
---
i wanna just *zoom* sometimes, sue me
---
So did you get a penalty after a single DC?
---
Ps4 and Xbox looking scared
---
but what am I gonna do if I encounter spirit? /s
---
I get that but if the killer is slugging like an asshole then fuck them im fine with survivors dcing
---
I mean like an swf with toolboxes and flashlights then yea i can see why you would say that but solo queing is pretty common and if your losing to solo quers if thats even a word then you got nobody to blame but yourself
---
Agreed
---
I mean, it was pretty obvious. I was literally appealing to some things said in the comment I replied to.
---
Sorry that you're incapable of reading sarcasm without someone saying "I am being sarcastic." That sucks for you.
---
Watch the amount of ban rates drastically increase in a span of a day then they gotta nerf it.
---
Ah yes, because "a survivor dc in the first twenty seconds in 2/3 of games" is a valid statistic too.
---
You can't pull number out of your ass and then say I can't use official numbers at the same time lol.
---
Made me laugh soooo hard
---
Haha... that is useful info.  I might grind a bit of killer now so I dont have to wait when doing challenges.  Thanks!
---
i want to kind of agree, but that was one of the funniest parts of 'twitch rivals', so i cant.
---
It takes 1 minute and 20 seconds for 1 survivor to do a gen
---
Does anybody else get a bug where when you pick someone up as killer and you hook them or they dc the music bugs and stays the same?
---
I wish I could get the noed achievement.  Noed just feels so useless.
---
Its possible if the person is smurfing but, yea likelyhood of hacking is possible. It's best to check the time when the person got the achievement.
---
“found the entitled survivor main” comments incoming in 3, 2, 1...
---
Once again im so sorry I have inconvenienced you for not having supreme knowledge on what people are thinking
---
okay survivor main
---
We didn’t run in a straight line and she was trying to hit us? Probably a new killer or possibly intentional but just let me enjoy my self proclaimed glory jeez
---
We do the opposite- I have a 3 man team and we make it our sole objective to save our random teammate, no matter the cost.
---
Hey guys can we please fucking upvote this? Thanks.
---
Disconnecting will probably become an even bigger “Fuck You” to killers. If people show that they’d rather take a 5 minute cooldown than deal with an unfun killer build.
---
Damn that's definitely bugged, collision isn't removed from husk?
---
And once again I'm so sorry you need that much hand holding because you can't understand things said in their context. Must suck. Tough life.
---
Spirit is still good. Small learning curve towards mind gaming. But the spirit is a killer that if you want to win, then she is the way to go.
---
I agree. Holding a button down for a one shot is too hard.
---
&gt;So did you get a penalty after a single DC?
---
Yep. I haven't DCed in a long time before today.
---
oh no now weirdodin can't hissy-fit DC when the killer slugs for the 4K
---
I mean it is a curtesy not a right.
---
it is a hacker because they got the wraith 'jump scares' achievement at the exact same time as the trapper one 'cripple them all'
---
I am hoping survivor DC husks are added too. Maybe I'm just a pessimist but I predict even at the highest timeout phase, the lockout won't be long enough to actually really stop habitual DC'ers.
---
Fake? Hmm... You seem to be denial of a lot of stuff. And tbh. It's seems a struck a few of your insecurities with the game. I really hope you can see past your bigotted ways and learn to appreciate the game for what it is, and not type cast every player you come into contact as a toxic arsehole.
---
I'd say its downright impossible to get all the adept achievements that fast, becUse you need to actually level each character a bit. That and the killer ones can take forever because even a 4K isnt enough to get them. And other achievements are really grindy. 
---
Even if it's a smurf, they definitely cheated in their achievements, I think.
---
How long was it?
---
salty
---
Love how you censored out the last bit
---
haha that...that is most likely the truth :/
---
Hill Billy's cow leg.
---
Honestly no excuse, killers dcing is such a dick move. At least if a survivor dcs killers don't lose items, get bloodpoints and have a game to continue. A killer dcing ruins the game for ALL survivors, and causes them to lose items. 
---
I say this as neither a survivor/killer main. Not that survivors dcing isn't shitty either, but it has less of an effect.
---
Oh he will still do it and just eat the penalty because cucking your 4K was totally worth it probably.
---
You mean Doctor.
---
how is it a dick move to do something that benefits someone else but not yourself?
---
There's some weird bugs in this game, that's not always the case.
---
You can pause and read the text.
---
You could make a sewer map that's partially outdoors, just have half of it caved in so there's lots of open space
---
It may be because I don’t spend hours on end browsing through comments so I don’t have knowledge on shit toxic survivors say so you seemed to fit the bill to say something that stupid
---
ah imagine reading the perk descriptions \*sips coffee\*, \*spits out coffee forgetting they hate coffee\*
---
Yeah I saw.Just memeing.Imagine if NOED activated only when endgame does.That would be such a troll.
---
She getting dogied?
---
Fungoose used to be a clown main.
---
You were supposed to MORI when they were on the hook dead
---
Works for every other game. CSGO, rocket league etc
---
I mean he kinda has a point, Moriing after their first hook is pretty much a dick move, you are kicking someone out of the game before they've even been given a chance to properly play.
---
Quantum tunneling
---
Proxy camping is a real phenomenon though, what else would you call a killer that never leaves the 1/4 of map you're hooked on? Like you're basement hooked in shrimp boat and the killer just circles the boat
---
Bro I stuck with you! Don’t punish the good players. Let’s both do enough to not depip and fuck the dc’rs.
---
[Too bad buddy.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230118965077082123/656537309331587082/20191217164436_1.jpg) DC penalties are now live.
---
sounds like you just want a free escape
---
Hurr durr tru3 bad give me upvote
---
I mori on death hook unless the person is being a shitter. Then I'll tunnel and mori them right off the hook.
---
I typically run BBQ, Monitor and Abuse, Spirit Fury, and Enduring, along with a Dead Rabbit and some other addon for faster stalking or movement. You're extremely stealthy and end chases straightforwardly, since pallets no longer represent a problem. Stalk someone to 99%, dissolve a pallet with Spirit Fury, get into Tier III, and down them.
---
The one real problem is accidentally hitting Tier III too quickly, especially when you're in an area not already cleared of pallets. Good survivors will begin to throw down pallets early (so you aren't stunned), at which point they'll just run from the pallet, assuming you'll break it. At that point, you can just chase the survivor around a corner.
---
This build works poorly on some of the larger maps, when you'd need Ruin or Corrupt Intervention to slow down the initial game. I do occasionally take Ruin in place of Monitor, since Dead Rabbit already lowers your terror radius in Tier II. Some times I'll also take Bamboozle in place of BBQ if I'm not thirsty for BP and want chases to end faster.
---
The good news is that these perks are helpful on a number of killers, so unlocking them isn't just for Myers.
---
welp, this wont fix anything other then losing BBQ stacks due to a dc
---
am i allowed to post the link to their account for people to report?
---
i am not salty and want them to get banned however i have tried very hard for my achievements and i hate it when a hacker gets all of those achievements in seconds when i have played for 2000 hours
---
See once you get them out into the entity's realm the survivors will feel obligated because of the implication
---
That axe was about a mile off too
---
Yeah I recommend it! It gets much better :)
---
I usually mori people on their death hooks as long as there are still generators that need to be done. But once all the generators are done, I'm not going to hold back.
---
Ayup. People will still DC to give their friend hatch or to cuck the killer out of achievements like Evil Incarnate or Blood On Your Face.
---
Uninstall the game then reinstall
---
Sounds like you read this the exact opposite if what it means
---
clowns mori is prob the least painful, sure he cuts off your finger but his stomps dont look hard enough to kill you
---
&gt; It may be because I don’t spend hours on end browsing through comments
---
What? You don't have to because you clearly read the chain of comments I was referring to since you quoted mine
---
fam u r embarrassing yourself
---
They'll still DC. There's no DC husks so survivors will still ragequit on first down.
---
 it's a he.
---
Hell yeah, dude!
---
This is actually a good news
---
Killers hating gen rushing isnt hating survivors for doing gens. Its hating how quickly several generators can pop up if you went the wrong direction at the start.
---
Some tweaking needs to be done.
---
&gt;Works for every other game. CSGO, rocket league etc
---
On casual modes? Because DBD is literally a casual game even though a lot of people take it seriously.
---
Nope just read yours I’m not gonna go through the entire thread because I didn’t want to
---
Not related to the op’s post but how tf do I add a flair on mobile
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
Unfortunately we already have a gas killer
---
Sure it wouldn’t be as painful as other ones but just having a man cut off and eat your finger tho
---
Anecdotal but I'm on tier 60 not having paid a cent for tiers, I do play a lot though like 30-40hrs a week
---
Yo is that from goodfellas??
---
this subreddit and the stupid topics. drama whores.
---
Alien and Predator. Then again, I can't see how Predator would be anything but a strictly better Wraith, with the same shimmer cloak yet not only being able to seamlessly transition, but also having a ranged attack with that shoulder laser gun thing. Alien could be more unique, such as having an ability - perhaps passive - allowing you to send out facehuggers that cling onto survivors and afflict them with some ill-effects until they get them off. Would actually be kind of unnerving to have something stick to your character like that. Though the active ability would probably have to do with that tongue torpedo, and would probably be similar to Demogorgon. But the mechanics could be differentiated enough, maybe instead of a ranged attack something you have to get very close to the survivor for, it then being an insta-down.
---
T-800 could be cool too, especially if the sound design would be on point, with the classic Terminator chase theme and mechanical, hydraulic robot-y sounds that made them so menacing. And now that the game they've actually managed to secure the Terminator license for is officially dead... The main issue would of course be how to make a machine gun function in the context of DbD.
---
I've had something similar happen to me some months ago, except I was pig on The Game. I just hit a survivor and someone else got injured.
---
God Myers
---
no there are 4 of them! they're practically a gang!
---
Imagine caring about pipping on either side, you can determine for yourself what you did well and what you could’ve done better. If you kill them all 3 mins then you won, end of
---
His perks kind of depend on his add-ons. 
---
Scratched Mirror Myers, for example, probably wants Boyfriend's Memo as his second add-on, and may wish to take Play with Your Food and a lethality perk (Make Your Choice, Haunted Ground) with the goal of racking up 3 stacks of Play with Your Food and using the speed to make the most of his lethality perk (e.g. Make Your Choice basically becomes your T3 Evil Within).
---
Vanity Mirror Myers may prefer a Dead Rabbit with Monitor &amp; Abuse. At that point you may with to slap on Save the Best for Last and just terrify people with a stabbing spree *from outta nowhere*. While T2 Vanity Mirror Myers is only a little faster than T1 Scratched Mirror Myers, he's got a better lunge and a better vault, so Play with Your Food isn't quite as important.
---
If you're not using the Mirrors then I'd go with Infectious Fright, Brutal Strength, your personal choice of slowdown perk (e.g. Ruin or Corrupt Intervention), and a flex pick. The slowdown perk buys you time to get into T2, if not T3, and the Infectious Fright gives you ridiculous snowball potential. Brutal Strength buys time for stalking on the pallet - remember that Myers is penalised for distance stalking, so the pallet is where you can build stock *fast*.
---
There are many flex picks. Monitor &amp; Abuse increases your Terror Radius in a chase, which in turn buffs your Infectious Fright when you get the down. You could abandon Brutal Strength in favour of the Surge-Surveillance Wombo Combo, which basically means you get a free kick and Surveillance pop any time you down someone in T3. Some people like to go maximum slug and take Deerstalker, gambling that you can take out a team in T3 and then go around picking up the pieces when they're all on the floor doing the dinosaur.
---
What way do **you** normally play Myers?
---
Here's a suggestion. Leather jacket drill piggy would be an amazing Keychain
---
Next time set an alarm so you can still get some sleep /flex
---
I personally run Ruin, BBQ, Pop Goes The Weasel, and Sloppy. Has worked quite well for me around rank 8 but any higher than that is iffy.
---
What a waste of a post.  If you read my responses you'd see that I'm against dc'ing and welcome those changes.  Literally the only bad aspect of it is toxic entitled killers such as yourself get to punish players for refusing to allow you to hold their games hostage now but even despite how lame that is dc'ing was such a problem that we needed this.   I'll take that queue lockout though without a second thought if I'm matched against a babykiller that cheeses hatch spawns because I refuse to sit 4 minutes to watch trash killers continue their game from the ground.  I'll let you get back to the mori spams and hard survivor BM you like to dish out in your killer games (I've read your around here for a while now lol).  I've seen how you play.  You probably get a little harder on each DC.
---
Really? I never knew that lol
---
lol so my understanding now is that you didn't even bother reading the one I replied to then got mad you misunderstood me
---
epic dude
---
I've started just leaving when I get the chance instead of waiting around. Mostly because I never know when the killer is going to rage DC and send my blood points to the abyss
---
BHVR will never put an IRL killer in the game
---
No.. not on Tuesday this time.. which really sucks and annoys me
---
You've added literally nothing to this conversation, I'm glad you'll be refusing to come back. You offered no valid counterpoint and even less evidence.
---
Nah man obviously its a kira meme
---
also dribbling the survivor wastes a lot of time
---
With Laurie I usually wear her default blue outfit with the hair from the Wolf in Sheep clothing set that released recently
---
With Kate I often wear her Sunglasses head with the straight hair, the orange default top and her bellbottom jeans (that goes in the same set as the hair) or her leather biker pants. 
---
With feng I usually wear her brown ponytail hair, the coffee top (?) With jacket and brown plait skirt
---
I usually play Dwight wearing his Dweard/Dwearder head, with the yellow L4D shirt and skinny jeans
---
Meg - long red hair, 90s neon windbreaker and white skirt
---
David - 50s head with curly moustache, topless and black army pants with boots
---
The other survivors I don't play as much, so I don't really have any preferred combos
---
Appreciate the reference
---
I get them but I used to play killer. Before rank reset I went from rank 17 - rank 4 survivor. Rank reset I was rank 9 killer set to 13. Started playing killer again and now it’s still all I get.
---
Rip queue times even for non-DCers
---
I know I’m not good at 360ing but I keep practicing, and I’m starting to get better at it; as long as you keep practicing even if you die the outcome will pay off imo.
---
Hex totems or dull totems? Only real reason not to cleanse a hex totem is in case it is Haunted Ground which exposes all survivors for a period of time.
---
Dull totems? Could instead be putting pressure on gens. Also some survivors run Inner Strength which gives them an automatic heal after cleansing a totem, so if you're cleansing easy to find dull totems you're taking away from their perk.
---
What happens if your game crashes while the match is loading? does that count as DC?
---
thats why i dont like hackers that was my point
---
I'd happily take that ass beating if I ever managed a 5-gen chase.
---
Best I've done is 4.  I had one that lasted three minutes yesterday, but ruin was active, so only one gen got done.
---
5 is impressive AF.
---
Dwight: helmet, prestige torso, jorts
---
Huntress: little pussycat mask, chinese new year axe, traditional pelt coat
---
^ these are important and standard. others I mix up
---
I religiously use Steve. I rock his christmas sweater,his bloody pants and face.
---
Purely from a teachable perk standpoint, I'd say pig. MYC/Surveillance now that it's not complete trash I've used more often than either of onis or demo's perks.
---
If you already have those/actually want to play the killer, you can't really go wrong with any of them. oni I find to still be pretty good, pig isn't bad and I personally enjoy demo
---
I would yeet my wallet at you for a meg charm
---
Demo can run a terrifying basement build that can rival Hag or Bubba - you can see it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-qix4OYfzU).
---
Failing that, if you're comfortable with Shred then go with Pop Goes the Weasel, Ruin/Corrupt Intervention, Save the Best for Last, and Infectious Fright. Any time you meet your Obsession, Shred them to preserve your Save the Best for Last stacks. Any time you hook someone you can tour your gens and Pop the one with the most progression. You should have no issues getting and maintaining your 8 stacks of Save the Best for Last, which means survivors will go down faster and faster. Infectious Fright will further decrease your "downtime" and double portals will mean they can't cleanse faster than you can down survivors.
---
Demo is very hard to deal with once one survivor is off the board, and the game is effectively over once you snag two. If you do your job well then there's really nowhere for the survivors to hide, so the real challenge is making sure you don't get caught in a chase that lasts long enough for survivors to *do things*.

Isn’t this technically an exploit? It’s abusing a game mechanic (dc’ing) in order to gain an advantage (the hatch)
---
i love this so much 😭😂
---
You, I like you!
---
Like, I do get it? Getting mori'd straight off the hook, because the killer is "patrolling the area", isn't really fun, especially when it's early in the match. If it's later after I've been unhooked, healed up, etc. it still sucks, but it's fair game.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
I agree with you, but mettle of man was fucking broken and nothing you say will change my mind.
---
I think it’s better than Demo’s.
---
I recently just unlocked DS and I've noticed since I started using it, I get tunneled way more. Granted they're on my crap anyways hence why it gets used but damn. After using it I usually get face camped and people get tunneled trying to save me. I dunno what the old DS was (just started playing less than 6 months ago) but I do think that DS should be able to be used more than once IF the killer just doesn't stay out of your crap. Not saying you should be able to continuously spam it because that's unfair to killers, but if they don't chase other people who are trying to help you and they just focus you from the get go.. Then yeah. Something else. Because 90% of the time my team doesn't Run BT and will just unhook me in front of the killer and he'll IGNORE the other just to kill me. Pushing a game that fast is crazy unfair to the one person being targeted and DS is only a temporary relief. And considering sometimes you'll get slugged and then picked up after DS runs out is just as discouraging. I feel like most of the time its just a  waste of a perk slot (this is just my personal opinion though. I'm still a newer player and maybe I'm just missing out on other counter methods, but this is all I've got.)
---
Yeah that’s even more insane
---
I have a saying as both killer and survivor. Toxicity should be rewarded with toxicity.  If you teabag me, you're getting face camped. If you click the flashlight repeatedly at me. You're getting camped. If you face camp people as killer, whenever you finally come for me I will leade you on the longest chase of your life, I will teabag you every moment and make it hard as hell for you to get me no matter what. If your only objective in playing this game is to make sure no one else gets to enjoy it but you, I will do everything in my power to make you miserable
---
&gt;DBD is like, forced ranked casual. Even if you play for fun and your above the avg skill, you will face more difficult skilled players.
---
DBD will never be ranked because it will never be balanced considering the 1v4 nature and all the factors that can go into a match (perks, map RNG, pallet RNG, windows RNG, generator and totems positioning).
---
On top of all this, DBD also has to deal with not so big player population which forces the devs to make ranking easier for survivors in order to give red ranked killers, a match.
---
Hmm. You seem to have lost touch with the order of events. This is perplexing.
---
We'll have Dr. Carter give you a look.
---
That was almost a direct quote from the Behaviour guy. He even said afterwards "that's going to sound bad taken out of context."
---
It's not like you wait on the queue while you're waiting out the timer. This makes it take even longer.
---
yea people will still DC to keep the BBQ stacks away, but the majority of people will just die on hook. 
---
And if a team of survivors is fucking with a killer and wasting time, or there is some sort of bug, here is your punishment dumbass.
---
Killer main here, rank doesn't matter. I generally play for points, jump scares, and gen pulls. When I have a game and everyone gets 20k+ bp I consider it a win even with 0k.
---
But when a survivor flashlight blinds me while I'm locked in pallet break animation, they become the tunnel if they do it multiple times. My goal for the game shifts to kill this one guy.  The salt I get is unreal for this. But usually they are good at running and give me a good running. I enjoy the chase. So if I can catch them I reward them by sacrifice to the entity. Unless it's Nea. She gets a free pass after two hooks as she is the entity incarnate.
---
I agree so hard lol
---
I only give them the hatch if they’re team abandoned them or just sucks, very rare that the person I like makes it to the end but when they do I save them
---
Baby dwight being dropped in the hatch by any killer
---
Yeah I’m done this isn’t even about the original argument and you make these back and forth messages no fun
---
I mean I play both sides so i agree with you, it’s just been happening to me really frequently as survivor, it’s to the point where I almost hope the killer DOESN’T find me first  so I can get some gen points or something.
---
...or maybe you just lagged?
---
So true. I also heard, sometimes it is even possible to remember being a rookie/noobie. May be a lie though, I don't know. I AM a noobie
---
And he would be black,with the yellow mark
---
How did you get mobile
---
"Patient seems to have little joy in life, Dr. Carter"
---
"Shocking"
---
No because I only ever lagged when I heard his Heartbeat nearby me.
---
Owww I always help those souls
---
Or find a better solution than having the killer tunnel into a specific build on the off chance that they run 4 flashlights and are toxic dickbags.
---
&gt;YOU WILL PLAY THIS GAME THE RIGHT WAY AND RESPECTFULLY OR ELSE 
---
I mean... Yeah? At least the respectfully part. Nobody likes dealing with people who show poor sportsmanship. It's pretty basic stuff.
---
The true friends we made were the hooks along the way.
---
Sure, you are totally right, dcing is bad for either sides, I was just fed up that day so I switched to play another game, nobody is perfect. I know my mistake, thats why im opening up for you guys, even tho i was expecting the downvotes.
---
but the 60 seconds can be countered by no tunneling... old ds rewards survivors for losing a chase, which is bullshit to deal with
---
Rancor!
---
Outta nowhere!
---
I mean gorgonzola and a demogorgon, come on that's too much sexiness in one post.
---
I’m aware. This is why giving killers more ways to generate pressure is important. At least the killer gets to play the game during that time. Downed survivors don’t.
---
Oni's dash and insta down are only half his power.
---
The other half is his tracking ability.
---
Oni's power is worse than an M1 killer in loops. Hell, i would argue it was that way before the flick was removed. You actually just have to leave on some loops.
---
Since you are trying to get better at looping with non-nurses, I will give you some advice from someone who made rank 1 not touching nurse. You cannot afford to loop until some people are dead with most killers. stuff like the God window on Abattoir, Cow Tree, Wretched Shop, Haddonfield in general, you cannot afford to let good survivors run these for very long. Try to get them to drop a pallet, then leave and try to catch someone else. Getting looped is exactly what a good survivor wants, Gens finish in 80 seconds without toolboxes or perks, 44 if there are two survivors (also without toolboxes or perks). You need to utilize your killer's skills to bully generators and ignore those long loops unless they are near a generator you are defending, then it may be worth it to try and mindgame it. Also learn how to run tiles and mindgame common loops.
---
Funny how they have to test them out? Guess they are worried that their game might get a mind of its own some day and take over and hardware ban everyone because they know their own coding is total shit.
---
Once let a survivor go only for him to leave a salty message on my profile about how bad I am and how OP the Plague is. 
---
I love this community.
---
Killer seems to have done well enough. Outscored all but the top survivor. I get that the ranks are messed up, but that's a 1K with a lot of hooks.
---
It’s 50 fucking dollars. I could go out and buy and actual steel hatchet for less than that
---
Hahaha, you know they can't implement stuff like this without dedicated servers, right?
---
Exactly haha
---
Good. Hopefully this is enough to discourage it.
---
spirit is fun, but u can buy her with shards and save the cells for something else
---
Nah bro, just a salty guy who couldn't take a loss against you. The movement speed cannot be controlled on Legion without PWYF, but considering it gets tokens taken away everytime you swing, no one is gonna use it on Legion lol.
---
Oh I know that I just wish the servers come sooner than later :(
---
Ok so actually compared to tier 2 myers, trapper, and pig that run 115% movement speed, legion runs that speed but with feral frenzy its around like 120% movement speed. You played the killer right if you killed him
---
It counts if it actually crashes. If you wait until it loads and you get sent to the menu because its a 3 man game you don't.
---
Timer starts at 30 seconds and grows every dc so its not bad unless you get it back to back.
---
Yah when the killers are just being toxic trolls like this I would have left too. We are here to play a game, not to be dicked around with, if your gonna kill the guy then do it and not drag it out for 15mins... I would eat that penalty all day
---
can someone think about the bones?
---
I would absolutely buy the wraith one.
---
Hiding behind trees near a hook. Honey, no. You're holding a medkit and dressing like we're in Blade Runner.
---
It's like a kid pulling a blanket up over his head - if you can't see the monster, the monster can't see you.
---
well since it's the slowest movespeed a killer can have (other than Nurse but she teleports), it's not really any sort of advantage
---
Once had a similar thing happen to me with Hillbilly. Was during a BP event, so I also used BBQ and a Party streamer. Easiest 250k of my life lol
---
Lots of survivors actually have no idea what they are talking about I've found when it comes to killer powers and what they mean.
---
For Wraith, I would encourage you to replace Play with Your Food with Save the Best for Last, and instead get your speed from a Windstorm add-on. The second add-on can be either of the Clapper ones, as they both have the same end result - survivor paranoia.
---
Remaining perks are a slowdown perk (Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, perhaps Pop Goes the Weasel if you're feeling confident), A Nurse's Calling, and Sloppy Butcher.
---
Slowdown perk buys time for the first chase, from there it's just a matter of smacking people and rotating to the next survivor - Sloppy Butcher means they can forget Self-Care, and A Nurse's Calling plus Save the Best for Last stacks means any survivors healing together just became a two-for-one. Very hard to deal with, and on *most* maps a Windstorm Wraith should be able to patrol both gates in the endgame.
---
gotcha. thank you for the response!
---
Dude, that's badass! Great job!
---
Legion had 115% walk movement speed and his Feral Frenzy is faster than that.
---
Nope, see ya!
---
Right? Would be an awesome tattoo!
---
I can fucking relate to this sooooo bad
---
Very interesting take. Never expected that one. 🙄
---
I'm quite sure it is, but haven't tested it properly. it also depends on the speed. I can do wide 180 sweeps rather quickly so that has to be noticable
---
Seriously, though. If you're not going to be an adult, then please dont bother on any of my posts.
---
Steve - Aiming for his P3, so for now I rock his Scoops Ahoy outfit. Once I get his bloody face I'll use the scoops pants/bloody jeans and the xmas sweater.
---
Quentin - P3 face and pants with the DLC shirt.
---
Nea - P3 face, urban country vest top and defiant ripped jeans. Right now I'm just waiting for her new outfit which I'll buy asap. 😍
---
No, it's more or less the same it's always been. And neither of those things are common at all in my experience whatsoever
---
Nope, die mad about it.
---
I agree that this isnt really a win, but hag is not a bloodpoint machine. Sure she might be able to get a slight bonus, but she isnt a machine. Hence why people dont use her when farming
---
use it after 2 hooks, thats what i do if i have a daily or somthing
---
im running save the best for last, bbq, pop and make your choice.  i also have devour hope that i sub in occasionally.  but it almost seems like a waste to run either of those perks on someone like myers that gets a one shot down ability anyway.
---
Yep, apparentlt they did, and all those times I never could catch up to a survivor, ive always blamed it on his 110% movement speed. Guess I was just garbage instead, lol.
---
Oh my god I'm an idiot. I saw the BP offering and thought it was the Hag's power triangle. They look almost identical.
---
Yeah seeing that it's Trapper changes my opinion. Fairly good game all things considered
---
Yah it’s been this way for awhile and they know this and haven’t done anything to fix the many issues plaguing us console players. 
---
I don’t know how you guys play it on the switch just watching someone else try to play makes my eyes hurt
---
For yourself and u/edicivo, from 16 October 2018 you can just aim at a killer's head.
---
eat the ds early if you really have to go for that survivor within a minute of them being unhooked. there are three other survivors to chase, I don't understand the ds hate. even if you get ds, it's a 5 second stun and you will probably down them right after it anyway. it's rare that I see a successful ds completely change the round.
---
So just pull out the power cord and you're safe.
---
Yeah it’s a press of a button on console for some weird reason.
---
Why does he sound pathetic? Because he gives what he gets?
---
Survivors who mid chase will try to hide somewhere dumb like behind an obstacle or right on the other side of a doorways. I can see your scratch marks and I am directly behind you. How did you think that was going to work? That might work for 10 seconds  or on a baby killer but.... it's so cute.
---
the latest patch made Mending, which is the act of healing yourself from the Deep Wounds state, take 12 seconds instead of 15 to recover from, and if someone else mends you it takes 8 seconds.
---
Someone can literally already be mended by the time you hit the 2nd person in Frenzy basically.
---
&gt;am i allowed to post the link to their account for people to report?
---
No, not here that's against the rules but you can report them yourself
---
Haha. That's why I prefer instadown killers. Ghostface is fancatstic
---
Kill yourself on hook, its way better than dc'ing now
---
Eh I mean it’s better than punishing people who aren’t actually leaving the game, via power outage or game crash etc
---
Yea, I use it all the time. I forgot about the actual background..
---
Slugging because you think you deserve a 4K is also entitled. Just hook the guy, and play the game. I hate when killers delay the end so long just because they want the 4k so badly. 
---
I'm not about to void my bloodpoints to let a friend escape, but I don't want them to heal me either because it's just going to prolong the slugfest until the killer finds them too.
---
Hahaha you don't pip if you get chased the whole game. Hell I barely keep my rank if I got chased the whole game and escaped.
---
AWWWW YEAAAAAA i can play iri head huntress in peace now
---
This is beautiful
---
why are they making the stabby gang less powerful
---
Had this happen to me but I was Ace with IS with a Nancy trying to heal me. Felt so backwards
---
Except she is. Her power gives her BP essentially the entire game in multiple categories 
---
&gt; Hence why people dont use her when farming
---
people don't use her when farming because people barely use her in general
---
Did they release the time per penalty?
---
wow as someone who has committed suicide i find this highly offensive /s
---
The reason why dedicated servers were delayed and are still not out on console yet because they put everything into getting their “must have cash grab” switch version up and running...
---
The first DC penalty is 30 seconds, the second is 3 minutes and 30 seconds. I am unaware if there is a specific multiplier to the time or if they've been set manually.
---
this reminds me of the one someone made with gandalf exorcising the king of rohan lolol that video was funny as fuck
---
That would be a solid plan if it was up to you and not the survivor. 
---
They would need to get caught, chased, smacked, chased again, smacked, hooked, (then within 60 seconds) caught, chased/smacked(×2 if they healed) and then you can eat the DS "early"
---
Basically that strat only works if you're going against garbage
---
Why do you consider that toxic? Why do you consider those actions to be inherently malicious? Maybe the survivor wants to grab the killers attention so that they can get in the chase instead of someone else. Maybe it's just good ol fashion shit talking. Either way, why is this so frowned upon? You guys are like fuckin Korean SC2 players with how easily triggered you are.
---
yea and don't even understand how pathetic that is
---
Meg Thomas is my fav and I love her braids and her tank top jersey
---
No they usually arent but he snaps your neck by stomping on you so
---
I’m sorry dude I will delete this soon :(
---
Shit talking is part of every competition. The only people that think shit talking is toxic are people who never actually competed. Shit talking is fun as long as it's left on the field. The only people who get triggered over this shit are nobodies whose only form of competition is casual video games.
---
New tomes come out on Wednesday
---
of the two I'd say Ghost Face. Legion is not in a good place at the moment.
---
But Ghost Face is one of, if not, the best stealth killer right now.
---
Legion if you can get them going is really good at stalling via survivors healing/mending.
---
I don't think he was saying he should die, he meant it as spend the rest of his life (until death) mad about it. Use your head a bit and you can figure out a bit of wordplay.
---
'cause if you facecap him, you lose and you even lose the chaser points you accumulate by chasing him the whole game.
---
What other solution is there?. The only options i see are:
---
Play a different killer other then wraith. Run a build to try prevent it if you see it coming (or never cloak ingame, near unthinkable though). Or he gets a simple change such as: If light burned/stunned while cloaked as wraith, the wraith cannot be lightburned again for 5 (could be more or less an just example) seconds.
---
This means the original design which is to lightburn him and run away while you can remains unaffected. While removing the ability to chain stun him to more or less just bully him for fun. What else would you suggest?.
---
When a pizza Dwight starts running right at me instead of running away from me. I didn't order that pizza and I'm not paying for it. I'll usually turn around and run away from them instead. 
---
My nightmare is getting into a match with 4 pizza Dwights because what am I supposed to do it they surround me?
---
I mostly play Dwight with Prove Thyself, Self-Care, Spine Chill, D Strike. I play a mixture of Killers, but find myself maining Legion with Mad Grit, NOED, BBQ, and Surge.
---
Time to break out my 200+ Ebonies! Mori Christmas everyone!
---
Another reason why the dc penalty is horrible
---
Yeah i've noticed it's been happening more even before the DC penalties. It sucks, but to each their own I suppose. At that point I just try to play the best I can with the remaining team.
---
Oh did I confuse it with a later one or the NOED one?
---
If the killer even puts you on the hook, 
---
had a spirit some time ago just constantly pick me up and let me wiggle off to only knock me back down and repeat, until I bleed out finally, took like 10-15mins of this bs all while Claudette was out hiding in the map somewhere.
---
Idk. I guess trolls are just depiping to my rank.
---
People who have stuck with the game for a very long time on console. How do you get over movement being terrible and lag? To me it just seems unplayable at this point
---
Because BHVR thinks that they are a balanced killer somehow, and assume that the few buffs Legion got this past patch needed to be offset by several nerfs to help keep them "balanced"
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
No. You started the match, so play the game. It ruins it for everyone if survivors DC or int on hook. There needs to be stricter penalties for this or unranked game modes.
---
They have to wait for the animations in order to kill themselves, just stop unhook them before they die and they'll be stuck in the game for longer.
---
what buffs did they get
---
Every time I tried to complete the healing challenges either I had no opportunity to heal anyone or it was a plauge. That challenge took me longer than any of the others.
---
I see the pettiness one of the most.
---
Usually some douche teammate who's t-bagging and flashlight clicking the killer and they'll d/c on their first down. 
---
I don't get how peoples lives can be that sad but yet I keep running into them.
---
I believe it originally might've been two and it got changed shortly after the release of level 3 but I'm not entirely sure on this. I just recall my friend mentioning this.
---
well i guess that's not too bad. but it still sucks
---
G E K O L O N I S E E R D
---
It's actually 1 min for first offense confirmed by developer
---
*Accept your defeat and pay for all 4 pizzas*
---
Thill notifies the killer when a hex totem is touched, shows the killer how many totems are left on the map, reduces cleansing speed and gives bonus bloodpoints to hunter scoring events. Get your facts right bro.
---
that makes perfect sense.  i love when they sit at the pallet for no reason and i can just stalk for free.  i'll have to put some more points into him to get spirit fury (hopefully).   
---
i unlocked bbq like a year ago and upgraded my pig from lvl 5 to lvl 40.  
---
still no bbq.   of course i started upgrading the clown (who i never use, just wantd that pop) and got all the meta perks on him before level 20.   I had tier 3 ruin and bbq on him in no time.   
---
anyway i digress, i appreciate the advice.
---
It’s power is derived from Dull totems. So without them, it has no power. Bad wording on my end for sure, but still accurate in that cleansing all totems makes it effectively useless.
---
Legion deserves better than this -_-
---
Joe
---
Kirsty
---
It wasn't 1 minute when i tested it 🤷‍♀️
---
Unless its 1 minute including end game screen and getting through loading. When i queued up it had 30 seconds
---
I mean if you stand pretty close you can smack one and pick them up in time.
---
I’ve found that I earn more experience and rift shards when I play Killer. Their challenges tend to be easier to complete, too, since you can just have a farm-a-thon and crank them out in a single evening.
---
Get yourself caught up to rank 48 or 49, then just try to get through 1 tier per night.
---
I haven't tested it myself so I couldn't confirm, but on another post a dev replied saying it starts at 1min so I'm not sure now.
---
This is so cool. Would love to have this as a tattoo.
---
WHY DOES EVERYONE WAIT 
---
  I only wait when I lead the killer to the open gate and someone is on the hook
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pshlJLOeX7k) should help show the difference visually.
---
I wanna see some more Left 4 Dead content. Killers or survivors.
---
Or maybe Frank West from Dead Rising.
---
i dont get it please explain the joke
---
Every fucking time.
---
Idk, man. I've played sports competitively and have always managed to stay respectful... I don't know what sports you been playing...
---
Idk man. Some people just play shitty.
---
Yeah, he’s great because no one really knows how he works, he has a lot of great add ons too. He can use dream snares or dream palettes which are both pretty great. If you can use him efficiently you will pretty much climb through the ranks. 
---
A tip I can give is using your teleport is great for camping NOED, because it’s usually around a generator, you can use dream snares to to camp it as well.
---
I don't think this is gonna solve much like people think. The timer starts out small, 30 seconds, and slowly grows. So I'd assume you can still DC a couple of times before it becomes a bother. Then when you can't dc anymore, you just suicide on hook if you don't want to play.
---
And according to how the dc system works, it seems like the timer goes back down when you play games without dc'ing, so eventually they can just dc again.
---
Ummm... I didn't spout any facts....
---
When they aim a flashlight at my nuts... my eyes are up here bud

Out of the three unique Chase music tracks, Myers still has my favourite. But I love the other two as well.
---
Same, your not doing anything by hanging around, except potentially denying someone the hatch. Gtfo. On to the next 5 min queue for a lobby
---
True but the way I thought about it was the killer was the only one trying to end the match like you said the survivor was being a cunt and not letting him
---
they have similar poses
---
Ah. Gotcha.
---
Then they DC because they don't want to be Mori'd. I've seen MANY suicide attempts turn into accident self-hook escapes, then insta-DC.

MY ANCESTORS SMILE ON ME IMPERIAL
---
Wait there are killers and survivors you can't play on console?
---
Its really not part of every competition... lmao
---
Show me the shit talking chess players
---
You can’t self-heal 3 times? Damn that’s awful.
---
To be fair, having ruin at least allows for me to cross the map and scramble the survivors before they pop a gen.  That's enough for me.  Totem for a gen.
---
Bad bot.
---
Who’s Joe?
---
I want cool Scoops Ahoy Steve!
---
Thanks for giving toxic killers the ability to be more toxic 💕
---
Thana should just include dead survivors
---
Just alt-tab and do something else at that point while the game plays in the background
---
...what?
---
I got to get outer here!
---
It's up to yourself - some players prefer variety, some players like consistency.
---
If you have Ruin with Barbecue &amp; Chilli then you've got the makings of an OK build on the killers you've listed, so the world is kind of your oyster.
---
Make Your Choice works well on Hag because traps allow her to patrol a hook from a significant distance, but her most god-tier perk is probably Save the Best for Last. Save the Best for Last reduces your recovery after a hit, which on Hag means she can teleport, hit, and recover in time to teleport and hit again if any survivor trips a trap - she can chain this multiple times, meaning there's really no such thing as a "wasted" trap.
---
If survivors get smart, and stop triggering traps, then Save the Best for Last will let you comfortably annihilate them while they're crouching everywhere. I really can't overstate the benefit of putting faster attacks on a slow-moving killer.
---
What are you talkin about I just went on fuckin App Store and downloaded it lol
---
KARENNN
---
Exactly, I always save IS for the end game in case I'm the last survivor and need a quick heal after adrenaline pops.
---
As a killer main, face camping is not good gameplay and is a sign of a new/bad killer (no offense). It’s not fun for any survivor and is a broken game mechanic that can’t be fixed. That’s why you actually lose bloodpoints when you are fave camping. (It will come up as proximity to hooked survivor). I main Michael and Huntress and can get well over 20k without camping a single time.

Your main issue is that you aren’t patrolling generators well enough to stop them from getting done so fast. Are you chasing a survivor so long that a gen or 2 get done while in chase? If so that is your main problem. Chasing and downing a survivor shouldn’t take more than a minute to do. When you tunnel vision a survivor you are just allowing others to get the gens done without a single interruption. Don’t be afraid to break chase and go back to a gen. 
---
Also a tip: when you see gems getting done fast, look for 3 gens in close proximity to each other. Make sure those three gens don’t get done and you can basically stop them from completing the last gen. You should watch Tru3Ta1ent/Scott Jund  on YouTube or twitch to help you become a better killer. Watching experienced killers really helped me become a better killer.
---
Honestly, I used to play the crap out of Ghostface, I loved him. But I promised myself I'd main Legion when he first came out, and its really hard to stick to it, but I think Im doing well.
---
Like seriously I don't care about BP or pips
---
That's usually where I see them. Idk, I could also be giving them a bit too much credit, especially since I'll give it to anyone who isn't sitting in a corner waiting for you to die or Urban Evasioning across half the map to save you. At least with a David farm, they're trying to help you. 
---
Tbh I should probably edit that because Davids do farm you a lot, but man I'm too fuckin lazy.
---
Can confirm, used to main Huntress for a month, loops were freaking terrible. Theyd always oredict my hatchet windup time and run through, and each time they did that, I died inside a little.
---
If I have enough I take a more for one person in case I run into somebody who’s annoying af then I’ll just get them outta my game
---
ghost face is the better killer, but I like legions perks more than gf discordance and mad grit are really good
---
You win some you lose some.
---
Perhaps I'm not high enough tier to really feel the pain of gen rushing. In my experience I've seen as many games where the killer gets 2-3 survivors within 5 minutes and then everyone rage quits. That seems like a worse problem to me.
---
Nice colors, where did you find them ?
---
Only in SWITCH. Bubba is avaliable right now. We are waiting till Freddy and Quentin in Switch.
---
Kickass bro!
---
u wanna know the funny part I only used the mori as it was the last game I needed to kill my obsession so I thought "fuck it ill mori them" *but I guess I missed the meeting for Mori rules*
---
I mean...I can 3d print a huntress mask...
---
There are some YouTube tutorials on how to do 360’s on controller. That’s how I learned! In all reality you need to look at the way a survivor moves in a game mechanics stance. Test out different movements and see how the survivor acts when moving the sticks in different ways.
---
I'm just going to make one. Wtf
---
Sit down son we need to talk about that iFunny watermark
---
NOED will literally tell you *once a person is hit*, although an experienced survivor will know something is wrong by the way the killer is acting - if they don't seem particularly stressed, then there's a good chance they have NOED as a trump card (especially if they didn't use a "hidden" offering, which often means a Mori).
---
Tracking perks you can figure out from killer behaviour - if they beeline in one direction after a hook then chances are that they're using a tracking perk. *Which* tracking perk is the real question - it could be Surveillance or Discordance, if they're going for gens, but if they're going for a survivor then chances are it's good old-fashioned Barbecue &amp; Chilli.
---
It pains me when I reach a survivor only for them to kill themselves on first hook. They SAW me coming for the save. I dont understand the point of that.
---
Sidney motherfucking Prescott
---
depends on your style, both are good killers with good perks, also u can buy legion with shards, and save the auric cells for something else
---
Luigi from Luigi's Mansion
---
&gt; "Winning" is not "Pipping
---
if you connecte your two neurons together it should appear logical and clear that pipping is winning, since the game telles you : you did good enough to acces to an toher level of difficulty.
---
As long as you don't go that good, the game either keep you on that pool until your progress enough, or put you on a lower pool 'cause you underperformed too much.
---
No secret, no mystical stuff to understand, just 1+1=2
---
Oh well it’s not released on my AppStore.

---
I DEMAND A PARLEY WITH YE CEO! “
---
Yeah which is why everyone tries to outplay with a hatchet but if the survivor is good enough you might be forced to just chase them for an m1 and that chase takes awhile honestly at 110 haha
---
I hope to one day boop the snoot
---
I agree but how often is your power going out or is the game crashing on you? It can’t be frequent enough to rack up a large timer
---
I don’t understand why they think Legion is good. Legion is by all metrics a terrible killer.
---
No. Facts. They want 50 dollars for this insult. You can buy a better made hatchet yourself, and put the DBD logo on it for less. This is a low effort piece of garbage, and saying "opinions" doesn't change that. I have a hatchet in my camping supplies that looks better than this.
---
Doctor is interesting - I started with him - but he teaches you some bad habits. For example, because you can shock through walls and across pallets, you might get into the habit of shocking when you should be chasing, breaking pallets, swinging, etc. Or, because you don't have to worry about stealth, you never really learn how to deal with it.
---
He _feels_ like he's accomplishing a lot because everybody's screaming, but when you take all of that away he's just a guy with a stick. Mostly, Doctor is there for when you're having a bad day and want to mess up someone's skill checks, but even that goes away in better ranks.
---
I'm not saying "don't main Doctor," but understand that his chases are limited until you've got perks to help him out, and even then he's not the greatest. You will need to build up your stash of perks and possibly consider playing another, more aggressive killer to see what Doctor really lacks. And then take those lessons back to the Doctor and rely less often on his madness.
---
(By the way, they're reworking Doctor soon, so who knows what he'll really look like.)
---
I have a 12 minute lock out right now because half the time in the pre game loading screen it never gets past that point, fails and goes to end game screen.  I've never DCed from a game but it seems to be counting that as a DC
---
All signs point to yes. In the recent AMA they said his rework would be "smaller than Freddy, bigger than Spirit", and the last update "accidentally" changed the description of his add-ons and power.
---
The *expectation* is that he'll no longer have to switch stances, and that at least one of his add-ons is going to cause skill checks to run *anti-clockwise*.
---
Look personally I don’t do any of that stuff whether I am playing killer or survivor but face camping because someone teabagged seems a bit much don’t you think? One is just done to mess with you and maybe make you tilt while the other actually ruins the game for the other person when his teammates catch on and decide it is safer to just not get him.
---
For Nea I run Biker Jacket, Ripped Jeans, and harajuku head.
---
The only messages I send are the usual "gg" or props on good plays.⁸ihhì
---
I can see your point, and it's a valid one. I know that the queue times can be a nuisance.
---
I've never actually spent longer than 5 minutes in a queue. Usually if one queue takes too long, i'll draw the line at 5 minutes and hop onto the other side (in my experience if one queue sucks, the other one usually has a game right away.) If both queues are really that horrid, I do something else with my time and try again later. I understand of course that not everyone has time to just "try again later," I share the same issue.
---
Regardless it may seem hard to take the loss after the given scenario, but how you react and treat the other person who used the build is totally in your control. I guess my whole point is
---
Thanks. I checked the site a few months back but it didnt have a real date. Last I saw was it was on a road map with the next chapter but that cant be right.
---
and then iron maiden strikes and you hide in the locker again while using Head On
---
I don't think that introducing those options would increase the harm to survivors. You can't stop people that just go up to the killer and suicide on hook.
---
And again, I don't agree that killers should be given generous reign over hatch. When it gets to that point, they've typically already wrecked most of the other team.
---
Yes, it's a contract kind of thing. They need approval to do things to licensed killers, getting that approval is easier for some than others.
---
Honestly the buggy nature of this game and infinite lobbies piss me off more than any toxic player could. Fix your cashcow BHVR
---
You can take my work to an artist that would feel comfortable doing it! Just make sure to credit me when people ask about it or you put it on social media and tell your artist where you got your piece incase they share it too :) And obviously I’d love to see it too!
---
Quack.
---
This. There is still plenty of shit in the game that people dont want to deal with. Imagine playing solo and wanting a chill game and you get a Huntress who can aim with iri heads, infantry belt, Ruin, NOED and an ebony mori.
---
Not saying Ruin is OP before some anyone assumes I am, just saying you’ve got a killer who can instadown anyone within range, Ruin slowing the gens doen, a mori to ensure people die after 1 hook and just in case all that fails you get NOED on top.
---
Why even bother playing?
---
People compare DBD to other games but another game I play is rainbow six siege. In that game you cant just take add ons that mean you get to kill other players in 1 bullet etc
---
Or as killer you play an M1 low tier and you get some shitty map with a god loop and anytime you chase a survivor they bolt straight through it.
---
Comparing dbd to something like rocket league is ridiculous because last time I played rocket league it didn’t have such god awful map design, it didn’t have RNG which could fuck one side over completely depending on how the pallets/windows spawned making the map either ultra safe or very unsafe. You cant take add ons or offerings that completely change the game.
---
DBD is a casual game. Keys, moris, red/purple items/add ons etc should be in casual and everything else in ranked.
---
But for me the biggest issue is the bugs. So many bugs, legitimate reasons to disconnect.
---
Now im not saying there shouldn’t be a penalty, I’m just saying the penalty shouldn’t take effect the first time. Everyone will encounter a bug that ruins the game for them soon enough.
---
I’ve preached this for a while and lo and behold, out comes the most recent patch and the game is completely fucking broken and they have to hold off on the penalties for that reason. Gee who would have guessed? So what happens when the next patch comes? Because BHVR have proven they are incapable of putting out a patch which doesnt feature a severe bug. Do they turn off penalties until the hotfix is out? Do we have to have a week without penalties everytime we get a patch? Which people will see as free reign to d/c harder than ever before?
---
Lets not forget that DBD has the most severe case of camping I’ve ever seen in a game. Im not saying people should just d/c everytime theres a camper im simply saying for someone who wants to have fun, throws on the game and gets a lame camper 5 games in a row(which isnt too uncommon)....i can see why they would be tilted and think “fuck this” and opt to move to a new game.
---
And finally we have the fact that dbd has by far one of the most toxic communities out there. Sef running OoO and tbagging at every pallet whilst bring op add ons and teling the killer to kill theirself post game. Killers that hard tunnel, then stand there nodding and hitting on hook or leaving survivors slugged until they bleed out hust to be toxic.
---
If people dont have a release with all the reasons listed above i can see this hurting the game in the long run. I cant imagine people will want to sit through all that every game.
---
Again its ridiculous to compare this to many other games because most games suggested so far dont have the problems that dbd has.
---
Introduce a system like this for the worst offenders yes but it doesn’t need to be too severe. If anything it was BHVR being too damn soft before that caused this. 
---
Guess we will have to wait and see what kind of escalating times it has though and how it progresses
---
I just dont find legion very fun, especially with the small nerfs they keep hitting him with
---
I’m not talking about long timeouts I’m talking about timeouts in general. For example this used to be a thing in for honor and the odd time the game would crash I’d be punished for it and then I just wouldn’t play the game the rest of the night because of it. Honestly is pretty annoying getting a timeout for something that is out of your control
---
Spirit, Oni, or Lesion are the most fun in my opinion.  Plague and Clown are meh.  You also might want to look at what perks they have and what teachables you may want on your current killers.
---
Okay, who’s a good free killer I should try then.
---
I didn’t get the bad habits from the shock as I was focusing on chasing so maybe he’s just not my main
---
"I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move"
---
I love how 90% of the comments know this wont do anything. I said about a week back that I don't notice as much DC as others and ofc when I said that I started to notice a lot more but still don't think this is the solution. I think they need to make it so you need 1 less gen if anyone DC's cap it at 1 or 2 so if 3 DC you don't need 2 gens and make it so if 4 gens are done and 1 DC's nothing happens. Cause the person DC'ing seems to hate the other survivors more than the killer.
---
Ahhhh so true...but for The most part...im The one who uses noed...im not sure why people complain about it XD its like Adrenaline or DS, very strong perk that is not always useful
---
... that’s it?
---
Each ban increases the length. I'm waiting out the 5 minute ban so I can get the third strike.
---
They’re crayola coloured pencils in red, red orange, golden yellow, lemon yellow, slate, gray, black, and white.
---
It actually looks like he's in for a strong buff, nothing but benefits to his gameplay - he'll still be everyone's favourite shock jock, but he'll no longer suffer due to an inability to reliably deny pallets and vaults.
---
As someone who really loves Doc, I'm personally pretty excited for it.
---
I have Dbd on the game pass...will my progress remain once my GP expires and I buy the actual game from store ??
---
Began the clone wars has.
---
when i have enough bloodpoints to level up other characters I tend to make them built for one specific thing. Next archive is for Jake, he's my locker build guy and then sabotage so I can 99 and destroy their hopes. sadly i dont have enough bp for that yet because i need inner and quick and quiet first
---
A fresh Goodfellas meme? It’s a Christmas miracle.
---
Suiciding on hook is better for the other survivors and the killer so why would you introduce something that would be worse for both sides? 
---
The killer having a chance at the hatch is not generous reign. Literally survivors can do nothing all game and one will still get a chance at the hatch but it’s too generous for the killer to have a chance too?
---
Killer: \*it's legion\*
---
Me: Getting hit in frenzy so I can avoid chase
---
It’s adorable when they drop their items at my feet. Usually just let them escape.
---
What if the game shows as “not responding” in task manager though?
---
You have no choice but to close the game. Its not uncommon to have that a few times in a few hours.
---
If it doesnt decrease then thats bullshit. Players shouldnt be held accountable because the devs still cant fix a problem hat has been in the game for over a fucking year.
---
Or how about when you get put in a 3 vs 1 game and the game carries on as normal because its such a broken fucking piece of shit that it doesnt even end when its supposed to? (This happened to me the other day)
---
I find bd it hard to see on.
---
This sounds like a latency issue, more than anything else. It's not something I've personally experienced as either killer or survivor on console, although I've been lucky not to be forced into playing high ping games.
---
Ranked already exists. It's also the only gamemode that grants BP and XP. Did you somehow miss the big colored numbers at the top right of your screen? That's your rank.
---
Monochromatic Shroud, Chrome Face, Bone Handle Knife.
---
I think I'd be okay with this in all honesty
---
First of all, ranks 20 to 16 aren't affected by matchmaking.
---
Secondly, when people do start getting affected by matchmaking, it has a 6 ranks range that the killer can get matched up against.
---
I would love to see a fella from ye olden days of knights and that.
---
Kinda did. The killer was a bit frustrated, swung his chainsaw over me at the end of the match. I can feel him though
---
What you're talking about is not even a variation of the game, it's a completely different game, both vision and mechanic wise; maybe some takeaways for DBD2 down the line. While I do want more asymmetrical survivor horror games out there, there are no doubt reasons why the formula you stated hasn't worked so far in other games. 
---
As for realism, it sounds good on paper, but doesn't lend itself to fun gameplay automatically.
---
It’s funny to just mend in their face right after they hit you and take off bc even if they come back you just loop them and they wasted their ability lol
---
Yah hold the analog one direction, then you spin the other analog. 
---
I’ll let you figure out which one does which.
---
Someone mentioned elsewhere it does if you crash on the loading screen so yeah it probably will.
---
Enjoyed being punished because the devs cant code a game for shit
---
Alright, thanks for letting me know. This is only my second time playing after rank reset and I wasn't sure how it worked.
---
Yes it’s normal
---
Yeah it could be that then
---
Killer is hard to learn. Sometimes camping is necessary but if you’re camping the first guy you hook every game you’re never gonna get better at Killer. Look up some guides on how to play Killer and take your losses for now. We were all trash Killers at some point.
---
I agree, I despise playing on Auto Haven and some Macmillan maps. Depending on what variant you get, it can be hell for killer.
---
I like this a lot. Losing in a video game doesn't diminish your self-worth. Chances are if you're stuggling with taking a loss well, there are some other areas in your life you may need to work on.
---
Just look at Friday the 13th chats to see how well this would work.
---

---
I didn't miss anything but ranks in DBD come so effortlessly people shouldn't consider them a true competitive feature, like many love to mention other competitive games in comparison to DBD.
---
time to use the pallet i placed in our Hallway weeks prior
---
Great, so people will just suicide on the first hook instead of immediately dc'ing. At least 20 seconds more for everyone I suppose.
---
Because the devs are spaghetti coders. 
---
Also everyone would just use discord/party chat anyway.
---
It is still "ranked" even if the game isn't designed to be competitive
---
Do we know how long it tracks the DCs. For example is their an expiry on when, after your first DC, it will start again instead of giving you a longer ban on your second DC?
---
Ah the joys of low rank spirits. Walk away from the hook, phase walk back, walk away, phase back, repeat until the survivor is unhooked so you can tunnel. They ALWAYS run NOED too.
---
Fun game. I wonder if certain playstyles contributed to the community being full of salt and disconnecting
---
The game has a huge snowballing problem on both sides. A killer making 1 wrong move can result in 3 or more survivors finishing generators at about the same time depending on the map. While 1 survivor getting downed quickly in the right place can push a killer into snowballing right back.
---
BHVR needs an additional objective for survivors and to rebalance the game around that to potentially fix both problems.
---
No idea.
---
My advice as a killer main: play how you want and if you want to play by the rulebook, never expect survivors to reciprocate on any level. Never worry about running strong perks or add ons. How often do survivors just randomly run terrible perks and no items just for the hell of it?
---
He's very easy to get to grips with now.
---
His perks aren't great, but he has slowdown add-ons (Chains, Rope) that'll make life easier for you, and his default puddles make him very strong in a chase.
---
Once a survivor is asleep, it'll be very difficult for them to prolong a chase. Sleeping survivors also can't activate Borrowed Time, so as long as you keep everyone asleep they'll be suffering from slowdown, be almost useless at chases, and won't be able to save their friends.
---
Be aggressive with him, and *if* you find a survivor that can run you in a chase, *just leave them alone*. Don't waste time on someone - find easier prey, because once everyone else is hooked you'll have all the time in the world to deal with That One Survivor.
---
they should make the killer also be able to proxy chat so we can yell at eachother when one side does something the other doesn’t like.
---
I’ve barely played survivor until recently and I gotta say... survivor is such a cake walk compared to killer. I can potato all game, and still manage to escape. I had a bunch of games last night where the killer was clearly just farming. After hearing about all the NOED killers with iris head and Moris and then running into like... 1 of each of those in like 30 hours I feel survivors really overplay how often they run into that. Or I’m just absurdly lucky. Also, can killers stop just farming. I actually like the chase and find it boring when I don’t have to worry about dying because you have no intention of killing anyone. All you’re doing is boosting bad survivors. I know, I’m a bad survivor that is clearly boosted cause I suck at looping.
---
OP I love this.  Do you have the blank template? This is gold.
---
I get that those suck but it is part of the game. I mean those are good reasons why I can’t win any games tho.
---
we love friendly banter in the dbd community
---
Due to certain killers and certain builds then no. It would be OP.
---
This. They can see the amount of spaghetti that was involved.
---
True True
---
i've met people who dc only for the map...
---
Just realized we could also have survivors teach killers how to deal with loops and vice versa. This could be hell or wholesome if it were added
---
I had a Laurie kobe in front of me after I ran over the entire map to unhook her.
---
On her second hook she let go as I was about to unhook her.
---
If you truly think this will do anything against toxicity in this game, you're kinda naive.
---
&gt;I heard the penalty can go up to one hour but I am not sure how high it can max out at. I assume the next penalty after 15 minutes is 30 minutes.
---
Appreciate your effort for testing and replying with the new infos. Now the big question is, how long does it take for your penalties to start decreasing so you can DC again.
---
Look out Trapper you’re about to stand in your own trap!
---
When they are in his shock radius, yes
---
100% agreed!!!!!!!!!
---
Devs claim it's just a test. If I do somehow get perma-banned (I think at the VERY most I'll rack up something like a 24 hour ban) it'll be revoked when the test ends.
---
The timer starts as soon as you hit the LEAVE GAME button so going past the scoreboard screen and loading the main menu takes a few seconds from the original 60s.
---
Maybe unpopular opinion but The best Myers mask is the Rob Zombie one. I just like how dirty and gritty it is 2018 is a close second mainly due to the age on the mask is superb
---
if they actually added this, the killer should get to choose in their settings if it’s enabled in each match. it’s a dumb idea but I think it would be hella fun at the same time.
---
I hade this happen to me recently because 2 guys dced and he was like “sO SweAtY eVeN AftER tHEy DisCoNecT” like shut yo bitch ass up i ain’t playing to make you happy I’m playing for blood that survivor rule book for killers don’t exist but the killer rule book does and there is only one rule don’t expect mercy from a *killer*
---
Both can be fun to play as but I prefer Ghost Face because he’s better at securing kills.
---
My theory was correct Jane is a killer!
---
You wanna rotate your camera the opposite way you are turning your character.
---
So rotate your left stick to the right and push your left stick right and vice versa
---
I completely agree. I never send any toxic messages. The only toxic thing I do is teabagging if the killer is being a dick. Other than that I don’t care enough and if I actually do get mad I just stop playing.
---
Spirit is really really fun, my favourite to play, but be ready for more teabags than the entire land of England and China combined.
---
Lol as the manchild using P3 claudette abuses a god loop “I looped your mom like this last night too”
---
Sounds fun.

Hell yeah, you're awesome!
---
The gates are literally powered
---
Thank you for the effort toward this
---
I see it more as  PvP game that people don't take seriously enough at times in order to protect their egos and pride
---
Same reason why although I'd like to see some Buffy the Vampire Slayer content, it just wouldn't work at least for the survivors since the scoobies have bested way worse. Lol I wouldn't say no to some BtVS killers though. Anyone who's watched it will know that there are tons of potential killers they could choose from given they can get licenses for them.
---
No idea. It might be based off matches played like you have to play matches without disconnecting to "Even it out". Or it could just be time based.
---
Oh no.... ONE full minute... Such a punishment.
---
Still fucking worthless.
---
Maybe if you're going to fast or being lazy
---
Lesion-ˈlēZHən
---
Legion-ˈlē-jən
---
(Look it up yourself to hear the difference)
---
Similar sure, but a distinct difference.
---
Yes and being able to immediately suicide while downed is worse for both killers and survivors than someone suiciding on hook.
---
So because the devs eliminated hatch standoffs which was begged for by both killers and survivors, the killers shouldn’t have a chance at hatch anymore because it’s too generous? Keep in mind the killer can no longer grab a survivor out of the hatch animation so it was a trade.  
---
I don’t understand how that’s too generous when again survivors can literally be do nothing all game and one will still have a chance at hatch
---
Glad to know keys are probably next on the list of things to nerf.
---
I finished the rift in like 30 days, but that was with hours and hours of work everyday, personally, to the point of severe exhaustion and breakdowns, I'm currently on an extended break though so, I'm doing fine now
---
Ah yes, let’s make the perk give you a free mettle of man as long as you don’t have exhaustion. Makes perfect sense to me!
---
&gt; Sally Face
---
Run Dark Devotion on Legion, smack a Sally Face, hilarity ensues.
---
Whoever thinks this is a good idea, well, honestly didn't think this through. It makes even less sense with the 600 bloodpoints everybody gets when somebody leaves.
---
Can't DC? Run in front of the killer, suicide on hook. Whelp, now the team gets no bloodpoints AND they're down a player. Double punishment instead. Alternatively they can just AFK in the match and do the equivalent to a DC time out, without the actual punishment 
---
There really is no way to punish people for leaving in a game like this, only removing the reasons for leaving will fix anything.
---
The ideas are well but there's the question of licences... They can be pretty n expensive.
---
Its just feel, and its different for every survivor, and killer. If I'm trapper, im more likely to follow you, because I can just put a trap at some of the worst loops mid chase, for example. It goes like this:
---
* If a survivor wants you to chase them, ignore them.
---
* If a survivor likes to drop pallets early, it could be a good idea to follow them and break the pallets as you go.
---
* If a survivor likes to play unsafe pallets, chase them and get them with the mind games.
---
* Prioritize survivors who have shown they can't get away as well.
---
* Let people go for the blind, if they don't have iron will you can simply follow their footsteps and cries of pain.
---
* Know your killer and how they interact with loops.
---
* If for some reason you know survivors aren't on gens (surveillance, BBQ, demo portals), you can power through a long chase.
---
* Chase people near important gens or hooked survivors.
---
* If they run to a part of the map with no generators, let them go. You don't want to walk your sweet ass all the way back, and they aren't gonna do anything over there.
---
Ok thanks for telling me

Can we make a list of most reposted cuz this has to be number one
---
Goose
---
Wait what
---
Is god mori him giving head or getting head?
---
That's not a Pizza Dwight but holy shit I don't think I've ever seen a survivor that bent out of shape from a DC like that before.
---
indeed it is but the game forced me to buy a eb mori to get one of my perks I wanted so I thought it was good to waste it bc I dont like them
---
type of cousin to mercilessly and ruthlessly beat their younger cousin in chess I see
---
The same way survivors delay the game by 99'ing the exit gates to prevent the EGC?
---
Look either all disconnecting is bad or none of it is. Can't have it both ways.
---
Bring it on to PS4. Just had 2 straight DCs hapen.
---
If it’s any consolation, that looks like you had a good game.
---
Wraith can still catch up to someone while cloaked and stealth approach otherwise body blocking to hit someone as a random strat. Although he is mostly seen to be abusing cloak by default just to gain speed and catch up and although this is kind of devs fault for not making him anything specific besides jump scare deviousness scoring event to be racked up only like this or doing a very slow stalking points. And as sad as this may sound, sometimes you can miss and also not gonna be helped by uncloaking speed boost for 1 second. You're basically   a slingshot with 50/50 chances.
---
He's in the middle of activating ZA WARUDO.
---
And a fellow Corpsepaint Jeff main!!!!!
---
I've been wanting Pinhead and Kirsty in this game for awhile!!!!! Hopefully one day it happens!
---
No idea, will require more testing and switch lobbies aren't exactly fast.
---
Awww that’s so nice to hear!
---
Bullshit
---
porque no los dos?
---
Some maps are fucking bullshit
---
There's a Bill-ion reasons why.
---
Hag with monitor and abuse doesn’t scare you..?
---
rip switch lobbies :(
---
oh give me a break. This would be shitty regardless of the killer. Fuck off with your "billy needs to be nerfed" narrative
---
As opposed to them just DCing? At least the killer will have to actually take the time to kill them now instead of them just instantly leaving.
---
I’ve been having that recently but it’s only happen like twice this has been happening back to back and I just get annoyed after three or four games
---
Survivors wouldn’t be ready.
---
or playing same map multiple times in a row isn't exactly fun either.
---
I'll admit, I sometimes get the urge to "roleplay" Myers, and standing there, staring at a dying person, is a thing he does.
---
Didn’t it work well with it? I remember having a ton of fun with that game
---
Sorry but you're the one that looks sad in this.
---
In this context, we were talking about slugging, which isn’t a glitch nor a bug nor an unintended feature.
---
If you try actually reading instead of trying to sound like a smartass, I've answered you. 
---
The game literally states for you in the tutorials and in the loading screens the objective of both sides. Survivors to survive and Killers to kill. 
---
The problem with the ranking system is it doesn't reward winning. It rewards trying to pip. You can derank from doing too well.
---
That’s happened twice but, my problem keeps happening back to back like three or four times then I get a good game then it happens again and as said I get annoyed because my friend is the only one who tries to save me
---
Already I see another wave of comments/posts along the lines of "But people will just suicide on hook so this does nothing!"
---
No, this makes it so people can't give a spiteful "screw you" to the killer denying them points/hook perks without taking a penalty. 
---
The previous system we had is literally doing nothing. This at least makes an attempt to show people that D/Cing is actually punished instead of the non-threat of 'Cross the mystery D/C threshold and get a temp ban'
---
Personally, if I have someone run up to me within the first minute of the game to try and suicide out, they're getting slugged until they start to play the game. It shouldn't be some monumental expectation for people to commit to an entire match when they willingly select to join a lobby
---
Hitboxes.
---
Sure, but a well made one out of wood and painted made by some 80 year old blind Russian lady who drinks vokda like water?
---
As long as they add the option to turn it off it could be nice.
---
Would be kinda annoying depending on your region.
---
Wtf ? I met some salty/toxic people before on this game but ones that complain about lightborn ? I want to see them against an iri hatchet.
---
You know they're being sarcastic, right? And billy literally is one of the most balanced killers
---
Corrupt, Pop, STBFL, Haunted Ground or BBQ
---
Of course i DC, and i will still DC, why i need to play a game that i will not enjoy? If you are a fucking facecamper and a tunneler, please unistall, you are the cancer of the community
---
I'll take that over someone dc for being the first one downed.
---
This is an awful change. People who want to DC will now just suicide on first hook. It does of course, punish people who are the victim of griefers and toxic builds and bugs. 
---
Basically it does nothing except harm people who don’t really deserve it
---
Oh sorry for the confusion I just saw this and had to get the screenshot
---
Say that to green rank survivors who want to unhook no matter what.
---
Shouldn't The Creeper be the Scooby Doo killer if added in?
---
This sub is just 100% trash memes now, right? No actual discussion about the game to be had?
---
Trapper H and Hag Michaels = D. M. HEX
---
Funny enough i was playing the Huntress on corn field with just yellow add ons.
---
I mean, if it was, it'd remove a lot of the mindgame from her. You could just bump her for a second to check.
---
Yeah it looks to me like OP went looking for an argument and clearly sent something abusive.
---
-siiiggghhh
---
I'm hoping for "A Nurses Calling." Been playing since April of this year and haven't seen it pop up once. :(
---
Wow toxic killer running hangman's trick
---
Neither of you come across well here. It’s a game, just move on to the next match.
---
No thank you
---
Calm spirit and wake up 2x
---
See there it is. The hypocrisy. It's ok for the survivors to try to tilt the killer but not for the killer to do the same? If you make someone mad intentionally what do you think will happen? That they're gonna sit there and take the toxicity you'rethrowing at them and do nothing? You want to be allowed to act how you please and not get any repercussions. If you, as a survivor, try to tilt the killer because you think it's funny, you have no right to complain when the killer actually gets mad and face camps or tunnels you because you made them want to do that when they didn't before. Ruining the game is more than just making it so the person can't play, it's also making sure they can't enjoy it, and actively trying to be toxic as the survivor can and often does suck the enjoyment of the game away from the killer, ruining the fun for them.
---
But it’s too late to try and be funny. Acc. You’ve always missed that time frame haven’t you?
---
for the longest time i thought BHVR posted polls of like 12 perks for people to vote on
---
Man I’m dumb
---
Perhaps
---
Rick O' Connel from the Mummy, I don't think it will ever be possibile but if I had to choose someone it'd be him
---
I've spawned literally right next to Legion before. I was very confused.
---
F13''s chat was riddled with children, the sounds of fans, Toxicity. Of course you could mute them but if they took offense to that they could aid the killer unaware to you because of the mute.
---
Surge and/or Discordance please...
---
The player message me talking crap when I all did was kill her instead of the person who just got unhooked. Sure I could of been nice but wasn't she went after me for playing the game. Literally the worst thing I said was hold that L and called her a child cause she was acting like one.
---
Any always sunny reference is a thumbs up from me
---
Okay so they'll DC and take the matchmaking ban which is shorter than the timer of a bleedout.
---
In the history of DBD there is a long list of changes that happened.
---
Previously (before bubba release) kill actually were winning just by having a minimum of 9 hooks and 2 pip for a 4K.
---
That win condition completely got rework to the actual win conditions we have now that is way more detailed and promote way more skillful play for both survivor and killer, since you've a lot to do in different category to win and specially if you want to 2 pip.
---
Killing is at the bottom in the list of what is asked to the killer to get the win.
---
https://youtu.be/JnHM50i2fTw Video shows everything that happened, The killer couldnt hit me and at end game the game didnt end until I quit
---
I once had 3 survivors hooked an unhooked in quick succession, so that three ds timers were active concurrently in the match.  It's absolutely ridiculous.
---
This video ended too soon.
---
I'm on XBOX, and I've noticed survivor lobby times are hooooorrible! I can get a match as killer way faster.
---
As a huntress and billy main, the map is so important, i would much rather just leave then play on hawkins wither im playing survivor or killer
---
For the first time yea, but it ramps up quickly after that
---
Yea sure but playing as a killer I get this about every other game regardless on what I do. So sorry if I got a bit tired of it.
---
At high ranks, killers expect you to not be stupid enough to hide in a locker, which can make them really good hiding spots.
---
Lol spawning in a dead zone with the killer=billy is an unbalanced killer
---
Now that I think about it I played F13 usually in a pre made group :D 
---
It seems like such a fun idea but is so easily ruined
---
Can you not block messages from those who aren’t on your friends list on PS4?
---
Sam and Dean Winchester
---
I really want MOM
---
Echoing everyone else, this won't change a thing. Let's make the player pool smaller by timing people out, a huge oversight given how queue times are already. 
---
Want to make me regret dcing? Give me a game bp/shard decrease by a percentage and increase the number of games it applies to the more I dc. Make it so the player will still pip if they meet the conditions at the time of dc but only receive the penalty amount. Blizzard has done this for Overwatch and it carries over until the penalty games are done if you decide to quit for the day.
---
You could also lock out players to not use offerings or restrict players to certain rarity only perks.
---
I'm guessing coding is the biggest issues for both of the scenarios. A timeout is laughable, there has to be a better solution.
---
I call shenanigans. Messages don't get removed from playstation support unless there's valid reason for doing so
---
And not the person who went after me for no reason? Not saying I'm perfect but I definitely shouldn't be the one to be blamed.
---
Survivor: *gets unhooked*
---
Killer: *hooks new survivor*
---
New survivor: *gets unhooked*
---
Killer: "oh great, theres 2 of them now?"
---
He had a mean time with 4 Megs and at least 2 of them had sprint burst and I had the kindred perk, one was equipped with Déjà-vu
---
Don't worry, it's just Rancor.  Go about your business, and remember not to pallet stun the killer.
---
Nah it’s really annoying
---
Quack!
---
No grinded the rituals
---
I havent played dbd in quite a long time (recently started playing again), and people who play almost exclusively survivor seem to treat the game as if it is survivors vs a bot and the bot should work in a way that is solely focused on the fun of people playing survivor. They don't treat it as a pvp game.
---
That sounds really really fun
---
See this just screams immaturity. "She started it". Please...
---
You can but I rather not block messages just because of this game. Majority of the time I just don't even look at them but this one I though was funny cause of the perk she was complaining about.
---
I got locked out tonight for loading screen crashes, so I don't know where you're getting it doesn't from
---
Oh, my comment is about when I'm the last person and the killer picks me up, so there's really no crawling happening. If I managed to crawl to a hatch, it's usually because the killer has no idea where I am, and I got lucky with a hatch spawn. That's only happened a few times though.
---
That 20 seconds can be crucial. I’d take that over someone instantly dcing. The killer will get more points too so better for everyone involved.
---
I play by those rules too. I've been facing toxic survivors for a week straight... this is DEFINITELY my most toxic week in EVER
---
Xchkftufyrgpyr67ddghksgjgfbhkiotr
---
Ysa I reported her and the message got taken off. The massage was just her saying she's gonna report me for "being a shit killer" so yea i reported her cause that's clearly her trying to abuse the report system.
---
Wake up, Sole survivor, Overwhelming presence, Surveillance.
---
Oh yes indeed it does. Killer won the match though. I really hope there are many more like then and only few bad killers or sour loosers
---
That’s fair enough! I play on Xbox1 and messages get sent to message requests so I don’t get them unless I check. Couple of salty ones now and then but they get ignored. I go out of my way to send good messages though.
---
If I know where it is and it's close, I don't mind. If I'm looking for it, or it's just really far and they start wiggling I kill them.
---
I'd love to see the other killers!!!
---
You say this like she wasn't before
---
Sure, I feel like there's a lot of potential in just about any non-human killers
---
Again, you're choosing to reiterate the bit we agree on so you can avoid having to refute the main point.
---
The game states your objective. Kill/Escape. It states it in the loading screens, which have updated every Chapter, it states so in the playable tutorials which were added with the Curtain Call. Long after the rating system was changed. 
---
Your objective is not to rank up. Ranking systems exist to put you against people of your skill so that you don't keep WINNING against people worse than you.
---
My current favorite build is Pop, Brutal Strength, Thrilling Tremors, and Whispers. 
---
Tremors is a great information perk and works well with Pop, because BBQ requires 40m+ range. So gens within that may be getting worked on, but you won't see the survivor aura with BBQ. Also, Tremors will block the gens, so if someone hops off the gen to get in a locker, it gets blocked.
---
Whispers is great for constant information and doesn't get used enough. You have to get out of Tier 1 as fast as possible so it's great for early game, and knowing whether or not you're wasting your time in an area.
---
And Brutal Strength because it's a consistently solid perk. Don't ever respect pallets and just break them.
---
Have you tried a stealth killer? New killers don't tend to understand loops or jukes, which is why a stealth killer can help. It's the same with new survivors. Ruin is essential to buy you time at lower ranks. NoED (which will get u hate post chat) will help ensure a sacrifice late game, which means you will not have to rely on camping so much and can learn to chase/loop.
---
80% of dbd is learning how to loop and juke. Map awareness and predicting outcomes. Survivors (unlike some of the killers) basically only have this to rely on. 
---
The best advice though is at end game just GG all and leave chat.
---
Yeah, I don’t come across many people like that to be honest!
---
Please tell me how this clip demonstrates how unfair keys are. The survivors completed all 5 generators and made it to the EGC. At that point, escaping with a key is just an alternative to opening an exit gate. The survivors completed their objective and escaped.
---
Hangman trick? Is that an actual perk? If you wanna knownthe perks i was running you can ask. I went out of my way to not be toxic.
---
You are a hero
---
if you cleanse enough, and the plague isn’t amazing, you can overwhelm them and use all the fountains. plus, cleansing makes it so much easier to hide.
---
Dedicated servers ftw
---
This commonly happens to me too, I SWF with some friends and in like \~10% of matches I randomly DC and they all stay in the match. My internet never drops at all, just the match connection.
---
He's a super Saiyan, waiting 15 episodes to power up
---
Why is this downvoted?
---
It's haunted ground yeah yeah it's haunted ground
---
If you're in range to bump and shes not phased you're getting smacked, the mindgame would still be there
---
The unbreakable experience
---
**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**
---
Back a year or so ago, before a lot of things got reworked, I tried playing with a friend who was very new to the game (he always blew up generators during skill checks). Meanwhile, I was a consistent Rank 1, so the killers we got were... not very good. I usually felt bad because I knew I shouldn't have been in their lobbies, so I would generally offer myself up as a sacrifice at the end of every game.
---
One time, however, a Wraith was face camping my friend, so I tricked him into messing up a swing, unhooked my friend with BT, and then proceeded to run this Wraith through the entire map until all 5 gens were done. He. Was. Pissed.
---
Because he was camping, I wasn't trying to let him hook me, but he did, and then my 2 other teammates (I told my friend to leave) died because they wouldn't leave the map.
---
guys i was not saying gen rushings a bad thing calm down. you guys took it from 0 to 100 real dang quick. what im saying is there should be some more ways for the killer to protect the gens but also get hooks. the part of this that does make me made is that this community whenever someone says one thing slightly controversial they all become jerks calm down and say you opinion without being a dick
---
Hell yeah bro
---
&gt;We all bought/own this game
---
*stares in gamepass*
---
I’m glad they are doing something for dcing. But this is only going to make people just kill themselves on the hook so they don’t get the penalty. Which is just as bad if your playing with randos. Still happy tho. Just will bring more problems.
---
Just saying hes the most balanced so it shouldn’t matter in the long run.
---
Lol
---
Evan MacMillan and his little-know brother, Ethan.
---
No need to be toxic about it
---
calm down gen rushing is not just a term used by "salty killer mains" youtubers like ohmwrecker and noob3 use it all the time and guess what they mostly play survivor
---
Thats not what others are saying
---
I didn't mean to come off as rude, they were genuine questions.
---
let's be real the queue times are a ban themselves for how long you have to wait
---
Im baby killer so if i get ya and your comrades escape sorry but im taking the kill
---
Then they complain about how they can't find any more totems for their heals.
---
Actually no, because people’s internet is shit sometimes and perms banning would be stupid. But at 10-30 minutes, it’s actually a punishment for a DC, whereas 30 seconds is literally not noticeable. I think games are healthier when they punish toxicity than when they dont
---
Oh, I see. It's definitely still broken. I just got 3 iridescent emblems last match but still only at 5/15. I'm playing on PS4 if that makes any difference.
---
Ik but you dont start downed, and the killer has many chances to be abusive. I'm just saying if the entire game was played in a way that intentionally makes it not fun for anyone than you're not responsible to simply give the killer free kills by sitting there
---
translation: because it's better to only use the cooler Daniel than the both of them.
---
I heard the DC husks are in fact coming at some point.
---
weird you can talk through your binky. miracle of science
---
I'm on PS4 too. You should contact support.
---
Don't know why Nancy mains (and people who use Inner Strength) insist on using the perk every chance they get. You have at best 5 charges of the perk so it's better to save them when you can, no? And the time you spend running around looking for a totem to get another charge of IS is time wasted that could've been spent doing a gen. Basically if you're going to hop into a locker every time you're stabbed by Legion you may as well just bring Self Care. ~~Or don't cause seriously stop fucking Self Caring against Legion.~~
---
Then again I don't know why Nancy mains in general so...
---
Yep, bing bong boi deserves justice
---
Can we have a double BP weekend this weekend? :)
---
yes, most of them even incorporate it into their casual modes
---
if you only take one hit to down, you’re that much closer to getting stepped on by a sexy clown 🤤🤤
---
I am xbox and I was playing against a doctor who did this to me i was a fing ming he was just shocking on the farm map. I just DC'd not gonna stay and give him a kill like that. Next game was a ghostface who sat at gens with us and we teabagged around map doing gens letting  him kick and then he let us leave so crazy lol
---
heyyy someone who didn’t just put text on a picture nice
---
This post have 4 hours an is in the top of controversial of all time some people dont like the truth
---
same thing happened to me yesterday but probably 3x further on thompson
---
probably a desync
---
God this reminds me of one match where a Nea unhooked me and I chased her across the entire map doing the "come over here" motion trying to get her to heal me. She then sandbagged me when the Killer came so she could get the flashlight blind when I went down.
---
She missed the Flashlight Blind.
---
The Killer also had Mad Grit.
---
The Killer downed her with Mad Grit.
---
She DCed.
---
dbd might honestly be about as bug free as csgo
---
Oh, I love to hide and lose killers in a chase. I agree. It makes me feel very big brain. However, there are good and bad ways to lose a killer like that. And some survivors will just go such a terrible job it's funny.
---
except the victim can rub their belly for 12 seconds and be fine
---
I've had people d/c over a perkless wraith when they got downed first. There's more reasons people disconnect than just bad game design.
---
&gt; but apparently this 3 second buffer goes down even when sprinting.
---
it doesn't.
---
still a useless perk, but that isn't why
---
Red rank killer/survivor consistently over the past two years. Check my profile. I reached rank 1 for the first time within the span of three days with barely any experience. Pipping has been, and continues to be, a complete joke.
---
have you played dbd?
---
it was a while when I last played cs:go and that was smooth as butter.
---
When your proud of your toxicity
---
I would duck but I can't dodge a car-sized hitbox on Dedicated Servers.
---
Jokes aside great artwork. The blood splatter is very well done: I like darker blood as opposed to the usual "cherry kool-aid" colour most artists use.
---
i think they should just have a different timer for legion at this point because you can’t balance an entire killers power with a couple perks
---
I get that bug sometimes. I can hear the game going on and move my mouse but the game doesn’t respond at all and I can’t even alt tab out or use task manager to end the game, I have to completely reset my laptop.
---
you don't realize that most of the mechanics in csgo are actually bugs valve never removed
---
Yeah, inner strength secretly takes more time to heal, but with the incentive that survivors can hide while healing. IS users spend most of their game searching for totems rather than doing the objective, which is crazy how they don't realize the amount of time they're wasting.
---
Will do, thanks!
---
We’re you wearing the Chinese outfit
---
name 3
---
I counter your hypothetical with a hypothetical of my own. 
---
Scenario 1: Killer slugs a survivor and leaves him on the ground. Searches around the map while the slugged survivor gets to just sit there. Killer either finds the last survivor and secures the 4k, or finds the hatch and hooks the downed survivor with full confidence they now have it in the bag, or  puts down hella traps forcing the survivor to give away their position. 
---
Scenario 2: killer slugs a survivor, survivor suicides  &amp; gives the killer extra points. Last survivor either gets the hatch or at least a fair race &amp; killer still walks away with taking out 3 of the 4.

---
I don't think a killer dc is any different from a survivor dc tbh. Yeah a killer dc ends the game, but a survivor dc will ruin the game for the other 3 survivors, and at the same time make it a lot harder for the killer to pip. Unless you farm ofc, but if I were to farm every game I play as killer where a survivor DCs, it's not going to be so fun anymore imho. When I play survivor and a killer disconnects, me and my friends get a laugh out of it. And 5k points. If a teammate survivor disconnects, the game suddenly became 3v1.
---
At the end of the day, a disconnect means the player aren't having fun and doesn't want to play anymore. Should a killer have to endure t bags, flashlight clicking? Should a survivor have to endure a huntress with insta hatchets and a mori?
---
I just think that one DC isn't worse than the other :)
---
"this shit is gay" are you 12?
---
A killer than can mimic a survivor
---
Common decency? You’re playing a 1v4 game, that’s what you signed up for. If you DC you’re ruining the game for 4 other people all because you can’t handle your emotions.
---
So... Now I'm forced to play against unfun players (campers, toxic tunnel, sandbag survivors and farming/cooping killers &amp; survivor) AND be forced to stay in game when a bug happens? Seems like a good way to counter the problem?
---
Gen rushing and ebony moris are not even in the same dimension of toxicity, Gen rushing is literally just survivors doing the only thing they can actually do while not getting chased. Do you just expect them to just stand around?
---
Moris are Much more broken and annoying, an ebony mori is an insta win with little to no effort.
---
Possibly. Are you feminist or sum shit
---
Both
---
the Mummy would be really cool, especially if he gains power over time after hitting/hooking survivors and subsequently gains eyes, skin, organs etc. plus beetle swarms, who says no?

*aight imma go stab*
---
had 2 normal games, 3rd cd now it's 15 minutes
---
Sorry man but a 2k is a victory of the survs or a tie never a victory of the killer
---
Nice! I ordered the VHS. Still waiting on that, btw.
---
I'm totally okay being hooked and killed as the last person standing after everyone DCs, but why can't we run around a little bit and make sure we get some points so we don't depip? haha

---
So is my friend screwed cause his game always crashes randomly, fair enough its me him and 2 other friends in a lobby so its not like randoms are at a disadvantage losing him but still
---
Have you not noticed how much survivors are complaining too? Both sides have things they dont like
---
HAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHA
---
This is like "If someone puts a period on the end of a text message then they're mad"
---
Arbitrary choice made by someone that either pisses you off or doesn't.
---
Are you lying about being 29
---
That’s good to know. I figured it was like that since all Exhaustion perks say in the description that you don’t recover while sprinting, but there’s a few old posts saying Mindbreaker was the exception to this. Maybe it was bugged at release or those people didn’t know what they were talking about
---
That's alright as I'm rank 2 on both killer and survivor I feel like it's frustrating to play killer and easy to play survivor when one person distracts and the other 3 do different gens
---
Distortion and locker stun are the only ones id be interested in
---
It's something you should watch.
---
Yes I was and a girl with a white shirt tried to unhook and get his attn then a quin came lol unhooked me and he got downed then I DC'd lol
---
I’m complaining for killers, being there is by far more bs they go through. Mostly speaking to the extreme survivor mains
---
I'm a bit worried about this as my connection is semi unstable at times and depending on how quickly they rack up I could end up banned for like a day. (I might get dc'd 1 in every 6 - 7 games cause of my internet) 
---
But I think it might be a risk worth taking if this means I'll stop people dc'ing if they get downed first by a spirit/freddy because 'oh he's not fair' blah blah
---
You are taking it out of proportion.
---
I thought I seen a red balloon the other day in game and it was really unsettling.
---
happy cake day :)
---
So... punished besides losing the pip and BP?
---
Maybe throw out a suggestion instead of hate speech and whining.
---
It was probably bugged, or people just got confused because 3 seconds is so short
---
You're welcome to refute me any time. Until then, take your own advice.
---
I mean you should play the game out regardless as you'll still get bloodpoints. If you really don't want to play the game out you can just AFK since it'll probably be shorter than waiting for the timeout punishment.
---
Camping will win you games now but hurt you in the longrun.
---
Not camping and doing more chases will cost you games now but benefit you in the long run.
---
If you rely on camping as a strategy you will get pounded when you go against good teams or a decent swf. Do more chases and get good at it and applying pressure.
---
I haven’t seen Detective’s Hunch in it for awhile now. Especially since it got buffed not too long ago.
---
Im Killer Main  and Im so happy about this.  I was getting so tired of People DCing and denying my 4k
---
Yup. It's a twelve year old! Just a heads up, its not really cool to use  "gay" to mean stupid once you leave the 7th grade. -signed, a gay
---
I'm only rank 12 so I'm just in a different league with different issues probably.
---
not even. as someone giving many private lessons, kids who are 12 aren't this ignorant
---
This change is neither killer or survivor sided. It's just anti-rage quitting. 
---
Don't care who you are, if you join a lobby and let the timer tick down/hit ready and get into a game, you're committing to that game until it's over. No ifs,ands,or buts.
---
Ctrl+Shift+Esc, click on the Performance tab, open Resource Monitor, then click on the Network tab. Under the Processes With Network Activity category, Dead by Daylight's .exe should pop up after a second or two. Right click, select Suspend Process and wait 10-20 seconds. Right click, Resume Process after.
---
Congratulations, you just disconnected without penalty and without pulling the cable completely. Using the Resource Monitor to disconnect also works in most other games that have quitter penalties.
---
That word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
I play on xbox and it's as bad for me, I just vault windows faster or I'll get hit when I'm through...Though that may just be hit boxes:^)
---
No that’s a rabbit
---
Yeah, must be a tru3 fan
---
I don’t know what you want. Good map design? The developers have proven that they are incapable of that. Any half decent map or understanding their own game enough to make a good map is pure fluke if anything.
---
Lore wise ash obviously ass-pulled his way out of the entities realm within 48 hours max.
---
They just keep him in game because people already paid for him.
---
Killing ur self in the game will literally take less than a minute
---
if you have the perk that destroys pallets on stun, ive dashed through the pallet and hit the player even on pallet drop stun.
---
gives you a sort of piercing shred like effect, seems like it doesnt stop the acceleration of the lunge
---
we've seen dead hard not work, but I've never seen someone use it and the game not register it, but at the same time register it and take back the dead hard exhaustion
---
Cleansing against the plague isn't the worst thing if you do it right. Cleansing off in a corner far away from the objectives means the plague will have to waste time to grab her corrupt and walk back which frees pressure from you. 
---
Personally I've seen better escape rates with teams that cleanse strategically rather than stay broken all game since being broken makes it harder to go for hook saves.
---
Isn’t huntress supposed to be a momma?
---
Maybe I would think so. Your rank most killers and survivors don't just use meta perk builds. I was just talking 2 my friend about how I wished I was lower ranks again.
---
Thanatophobia does next to nothing. It's only good on any other killer with Sloppy because of the way negative % changes stack (they add. would be weaker and healthier for the game if they were stronger on their own and multipied)
---
I am a killer main. Are you suggesting there should be no punishment for killers DCing or that killers should just  rage quit when they're losing? That's so cute.
---
Whereas before it took less than a second
---
it's easy to get infected. cleansing gives you a temporary health state and turns plague into a 115% infinite ammo machinegun huntress
---
I'd rather just stick to looping when injured.
---
I think both sides need to just learn to be the bigger person and not facecamp or tea bag just because they annoyed you..
---
If you aren't enjoying unistall then
---
Yo this would be dope
---
I dont mi d the laboratory. The others I hate though.
---
I'm a casual rank kind of player in every game. As soon as I try hard enough to reach the high ranks it just makes the game more of a job, it becomes frustrating and rage inducing when you derank.
---
If you're always low ranked you can't get mad about it &lt;points to head&gt;
---
I love this game man , I’m addicted
---
Noooo I just finished leveling the nurse so I could unlock it. All that work for nothing would make me sad. Next week is fine, but no no no, not today please.
---
Won’t the survivor mains call this “unfair”
---
It sounds like you just hate the game and you should find another game to play.
---
Actual effort! This was great! Take my praise as I have no gold to give.
---
Irezumi sleeve with the Oni would be so killer
---
Killer thoughts. I agree

 Because the only thing better than being called gay in chat is being called gay by the cracking voice of a thirteen year old Russian kid over commas.

When I play on ps4 I lose my offering and sometimes my item, on pc I never lose items but I do lose the offerings so I just assume it's all buggy lol
---
He’s not... that’s what it is. You’re throwing a tantrum because things didn’t go your way.
---
Oh that sounds lovely
---
No, until this game is fixed and balanced there should be no punishment for killer’s DCing. “Daddy clown can lick my...” i now understand who I’m speaking to.
---
Yeah that is kinda true. I wished there was a casual mode like I seige.
---
It’s called a mute button.
---
I predict you’re wrong.
---
I die a lot on my hooks because I guess the game lags and it thinks I stop struggling. Happens daily.
---
Do people actually say hobknocker or is that not a thing?
---
Honestly happens to me far too often than it should, I'm just dumb.
---
Also true
---
Literally never heard that in my life.
---
At least I get my BBQ stack
---
Good luck losing 3 gens lolol
---
That’s just dedication servers. Reason why I don’t run dead hard anymore
---
Probably just american tv being dumb. What about snogging is that a thing lol.
---
That's dope
---
Ah, I see.
---
Okay, snogging is a thing.
---
IT'S CONSOLE LMFAO
---
Who said anything about set spawn location? items are placed in different locations just about every match, even the gens, it's a simple matter of generating gen locations and then when the computer is deciding Totem locations it just checks for gens in a certain radius, if there is a gen a new totem spawn is selected.
---
Oh okay. Thank you for the education.
---
Any change they incorporate in the game is survivor sided. The whole game is survivor sided. Anything they add in this game affects killers more negatively than anything they could do to affect survivors.
---
You do have a choice. Your choices are to either:
---
A) DC and get put in a timeout corner.
---
B) Force yourself to die on the first hook and queue again instantly.
---
C) Play the fucking game and suck it up.
---
Wtf
---
This fucking game
---
No problem whatsoever- it’s rare I get to educate people about UK slang.
---
glad i'm not the only one
---
You can unlock licensed characters that way? I might have to go update dbd mobile
---
This post is literally in “rant”
---
that's why I'm so confused, if it was dedicated servers it would've made sense but this is console, where it literally just took back the dead hard LMAO
---
Killers should be able to, not survivors. Survivors whine when they’re entitled as fuck.
---
Its literally survivors only objective. Wtf else are they supposed to do? The term makes no sense.
---
No they offer auric sells in the new rituals
---
Billies chase game is still fine on Hawkins yeah you can zoom around the map as much but the map isn't big enough were it becomes an issue. Its Léry's that fucks him with all those windows.
---
Honestly, all gays that play dbd should be exterminated. Keep this game free from any more faggotry please.
---
Ohh okey, ty
---
stutter stepping via holding both a and d, bunny hopping, mollies not always being killed off by smokes. and that was pretty easy. i could make this list even longer by naming off every bug that was in for years that valve knew about and never removed till they absolutely have to.
---
Most intelligent comment
---
and every one is till waiting for a reflexion from you and you "opinion".
---
Yes, they’ve made it so you can no longer DC when someone does something you don’t like.
---
Well good thing I literally never said 99ing gates was ok. I hate when people do that and open them myself as survivor. It's basically exploiting, by having the gates open without the timer going.
---
I dont appreciate you just saying that I think it's fine, even though I never once said anything about it.
---
Someone leaving a game THAT THEY OWN is just called basic human rights, not a personal attack to the other players.
---
I have gotten to the point where I can just hit everyone in a huge loop and as long as I never miss I will be in a constant loop of bs
---
It's still better for everyone than a DC. Killer gets his hook credit, other survivors get more time cause killer actually has to go hook em.
---
Well that sucks. I hope that can be fixed
---
They are active now on PC and the penalty for the first DC is 60 seconds increasing every time
---
This is beautiful.
---
I feel attacked as a Legion main- but it’s silly. imagine running across the map to hit somone and frenzy ending right as you’re about to stab them, couldn’t be me. *Sweats Nervously*
---
I like Legion for farming blood points but I think they're like Wraith where you get easy first hits and then have nothing to help in loops.
---
Eh, little bit homosexual.
---
Yeah. They want you to run ruin which is a joke. I can run 3 gen perks and still have all 5 get done quickly. The thing is if someone is good at loops your ability as killer doesnt matter as much. It takes 80 seconds or so to do a gen with one survivor and 60 with two. It's a joke to assume you can chase a survivor for short periods of time. It's fine for low ranks but the higher you get the more likely you are to get gen "rushed"  and another thing. People act like the terms dont exist and they arent really but if a killer deliberately only follows on survivor that's tunneling. Same if they hook one guy and never leave. Its camping. If a team of survivors come in equipped to have every gen done in 2 or 3 minutes that sounds like a rush to me.
---
Billy looses one of his best attributes on hawkins, and his chase game is effected since indoor maps have a shit tone of obstacles in the way that block your curving.
---
Still calm down the killers is to kill but it's hard to do that when the person you've been chasing gets downed and 3 gens pop. I play both survivor and killer and I'm rank 2 on both. It's unfun if the game ends so quick
---
That would give her corrupted purge automatically, you do realize that?
---
Keep me posted too id be so down to get The Spirit done in the same way 😍
---
You just have to get used to it, which sucks. I play both killer and survivor, when I play killer I have to close app every 2-3 games or so to stop frame drops. As survivor, I don’t get frame drops but the only thing that sucks is never having green ping, which I make up for by running resilience (&amp; or spine chill).
---
You do actually get more BP mori someone on their death hook than you would for hooking them unless it's during end game collapse.
---
2 pipping honestly doesn't matter that much since it's much harder to pull off at higher ranks, but you can just mori everyone on their death hook and still pip.
---
1 corrupt purge is better than like 8
---
Glad you're enjoying it, games far from perfect but I still find it fun as hell
---
Hang.... in their....?

A bunch of pallets are very short loops were you can mind game with his chainsaw.
---
Gorgeous!
---
What if their internet was horrible? What if at that exact moment their house caught on fire? What if their internet went out in that exact moment?
---
You see what I’m getting at? Everyone has different circumstances, punishing DCs will do nothing than result in a even lower player base. OR people will just kill themselves on hook **it will solve NOTHING**
---
can stutter stepping affect the game competently so the other team loses?
---
bunny hopping was dead in 1.3 (so unless they fkd up, i havent' seen it what i was still playing csgo)
---
mollies is k, that can turn match around, but still minor.
---
dbd with dedi servers are a joke, window hists; dh is on srike and doesn't work half the time, dsync and then killer hits you from nowhere.
---
Who cares about popping
---
I agree. I will continue to DC until I hit a hard wall and the penalties stop escalating. I am curious exactly how high it'll go. Like, will it just max at 1 hour? 2 hours? 24 hours? 1 week?
---
I am also curious how long it'll take for the penalty level to expire. Do you have to go a day without a DC to drop one level or reset back to zero?
---
You like when your team mates block you, keep jumping in a locker or pallet drop on purpose to you get hit? You like when a killer block you? When a killer slug the whole team and refuse to hook? We seem to have different point of view on fun
---
removed lets not use words like this on this sub thank you
---
why get offended? Because they are being offense and we arent mature enough to turn the other cheek.
---
My favorite are the people who quickly spam the come here emote to make it look like they slap you.
---
I didn’t say it was a personal attack on other players. I’m pointing out how it affects other people based on your actions. You’re technically right, it is a “basic human right” that’s why the Leave Game option is there. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t wrong and that’s why a punishment system is being implemented.
---
LOL! I could handle waiting a week! I want it to come out in the shrine to avoid all that work! Nurse is very difficult for me to play, and I don't really want to dump blood points in her since I never plan on using her! Stoked you got it unlocked!!!! I hope for your sake it doesn't come out this week!!!
---
It's definitely feels like unearned bs when a survivor d/cs so their friend can get the hatch. I don't know how you would remove that ability beside giving the hatch a small window before it opens after a d/c.
---
I play Solo and really couldn’t give a shit if my teammate gets hatch or not (I may care slightly if the Killer was an ass).
---
However I despise being slugged whilst the Killer tries to either find my teammate or uses me as bait. I know I know at higher ranks Killers need a 4K to be more likely to pip but i’m speaking personally as I don’t care about pipping.
---
I’ve had instances where i’m picked up then knocked down again 20 seconds later as my teammate urban evades away and i’m left to recover, only to get picked up and just knocked straight back down again over and over.
---
I wish there was a way for Survivors to forfeit and end the bleed out if your timer goes below 50%. At that point i’m not earning any more BP and it’s a miserable experience.
---
Nowadays I just afk, don’t bother to recover and let crows form while I go get a drink or something. Sorry teammate if you try to pick me up but i’m not into that.
---
If every killer is like you then sure it’ll ramp up. 
---
But most people don’t care enough to try to force 
---
someone to play a game they aren’t having fun with so most killers will just let them kill themselves on hook

What is worse than DC is killer and survivors farming. 'cause it waste a lot more time than a DC.
---
Are you going to do something about that ?
---
I'm a nancy main and I always take the opportunity to save up my inner strengh
---
For your first DC. Second is 5 minutes and goes up with each one
---
They need a report system that actually works
---
Anyone who is actively searching for totems with just Inner Strength for totem hate is using it wrong.
---
Who needs to 3 gen when you can be Freddy.     Surveillance is OP on him.
---
Judo doesn't use strikes.

Please refer to this as a karate kick.
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
---
If you can dodge a car, you can dodge a ball.
---
How do you have a 35 min survivor queue?
---
Game crashing, auto kicks, lock-ups all result in a timeout penalty.
---
If your house is on fire I don’t think a 30 second penalty is your biggest worry at the moment
---
Save that IS until a survivor doesn't come heal you. Smh Nancy. Get your act together.
---
We need more Nancy mains like you, my good sir. You are now a certified baller.
---
Just open every locker. I can guarantee one of those fuckers is in  locker
---
the smart ones will just kill themselves on first hook... in theory. In reality, most people who DC are acting out of irrational emotion rather than some carefully considered system of ethics and fairness.
---
why would random players do more actions for a stream they don't even know is on probably. maybe they get streamsnipers sometimes, but no way it's 87 times. And i guess doing a chase is mindless also, because Tofu talks a lot in the middle of it. What i was trying to say that maybe it's a bad mindset to think red ranks are horrible hard, when there is evidence what is achiveable with more skill.
---
Welp... that’s relatable
---
Sure wont be borrowed time
---
Just like others in the comments are saying, they should be looking at the things in this game that make it unfun for players, instead of putting in a penalty system that's only going to do more harm than good. Look, I'm not the type of guy to DC because I think most of the time it's a dick move. But people tend to disconnect when they get a map that's unfavorable for them or they're facing something that's unfun or overpowered to go against. 
---
Let's be honest: it's rare to see a killer have fun in Haddonfield. It's uncommon to see a survivor have fun in indoor maps like Hawkins or Lery's. Semi-infinites like the Ironworks of Misery and Rancid Abbatoir are very unfun for killer. Slugging builds which get popularized by famous DBD YouTubers are not fun to play against as survivor. 
---
No one likes to be bleeding out on the floor for several minutes. Very few people enjoy playing against a Spirit because you can't interact with her, instead you make guesses. It is not fun to be facing SWFs with voice comms that gen rush your game and know the maps by heart, PLUS they act toxic in the process. 
---
Being taken hostage by a killer that decides to be a cunt and blocks the stairway at Thompson House, the basement, or corners you somewhere makes you stop playing the game. But no since we got the EGC now and games can't go on infinitely people forgot all about that.
---
Getting genrushed as killer in an unfavorable map even though you've made little mistakes is not fun. Getting your ass handed to you because of RNG isn't either. No one likes to have their totem cleansed in the first 10 seconds. No one likes facing a camping/hard tunneling killer. No one likes facing survivors in a map where RNG benefited them and many loops are quite safe. Or vice versa.
---
You see how many things can be unpleasant in this game? And I haven't even typed out HALF of them. The game has many faulty mechanics, poor map designs, unbalanced perks, unbalanced add-ons, a crappy RNG system, and a crappy matchmaking system that serve as catalysts for an endless wave of unfun and stressful experiences. Of course you're going to have people disconnecting left and right. NOW, yes, there are people that DC in an act of pettiness because they got rightfully outplayed, but you also have to consider the game itself.
---
If they could just address most of these issues, I can guarantee that the number of DCs would go down considerably, because there would be many less factors coming into play that would make people leave in the first place.
---
IDK whether to post as a meme or Fan content, Sorry :/
---
Tips for red ranks as killer? Best strategy at the beginning of the game? How to get pressure very efficiently and slow the gen speed? What to do at unmindgameable loops? Lunge or normal attack against really good loopers? How to become a mindgame god? I know how to do those things in general, but I am sure I could do it better. Mostly playing Freddy, Plague and Wraith btw.
---
If only we had emote interactions like TF2
---
Every time 😭😂
---
and looking at your posts it seems you just hate other people and should perhaps isolate yourself in Alaska or somewhere
---
First DC should start at 5 minutes.
---
Now the real culprits will just kill themselves on hook while people who get disconnected because technical issues will be banned for no reason. :)
---
Pretty sure that counts as rage quitting, which is reportable, under unsportsmanlike conduct. If they do it enough and get reported enough I would think they would be punished.
---
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with DCing. I play survivor and other survivors DC all the time it means nothing in a game with no rewards for ranking up. **If someone is not having fun playing a game, then they should stop playing it ESPECIALLY if it’s a casual game** there’s no arguing that.
---
Make your choice, overwhelming presence, calm spirit, bond
---
I was wondering when the crabs would show up...
---
Ah. The smash bros approach
---
Let's not forget people body blocking people in a corner, or you are slugged to bleed out, or your killer randomly gets stuck in the environment somehow. Like the other day a Nurse teleported and got stuck in a rock on a hill. Also, crashes mid game. So those people now get punished for that stupid stuff they have no control over.
---
This game doesn't work consistently enough for DC penalties to ever be worth keeping.
---
I'm sure this has been mentioned.
---
Why not make the Frenzy hit have a 1 minute timer but cannot be self-healed without a med-kit.
---
Keeps the theme of a hit and run attack, but forces the victim to find a friend to heal or to find a med-kit.
---
I've been playing Stabby Gang in low ranks recently and I'm doing fine, but sometimes it feels like I'm stabbing 79 times to get 1 down.
---
People are praising this but forget this is BHVR. We just had a basement bug and you guys still think this will be a good idea given that almost every patch something breaks? 
---
All this does is promote suicide hooking and this is only worth anything while waiting out hatch. Given that people suicide on hook towards the start of the match that "precious" time saved is practically useless. 
---
People are going to DC over anything, that goes for any game. It's up to the game to have fun mechanics and game design to discourage this as much as they can, *then* have a DC penalty. 
---
But when you have killers that basically guarantee a DC or a bunch of BS hits that shouldn't/should've registered, maybe look into those first. 
---
Personally, I'm one for reward over punishment. How about increase the bonus for being abandoned? This game's grind is increasing at a steady rate, especially for newer players, so how about we stop being so damn stingy with the BPs? 
---
Inb4 someone says "wHat AbOUt eXpLoiTeRs"? It shouldn't be that much points to make that worth while and honestly, if people want to waste time doing that, let them. 
---
No different than trying to farm every game at the cost of your team.
---
Yea, I think the 'decay' will be a major factor in what makes or breaks this system. Can people just play a handful of games where they run at the killer with OoO +No Mither and get back down to the 60 second penalty? Only time will tell
---
If it even comes to them, we don’t even have dedicated servers yet or any optimization for console yet.
---
I don't even bother counting the amount of dc's i get daily. It's almost always the first person i downed to.
---
removed for being uncivil
---
that's kinda kinky but okay
---
*but I dont care about BP when I use moris*
---
Watermark that shit!!! 100's of people have probably already stolen it
---
damn bro, you owe them blood points 🤣
---
I just sometime don’t want to play the game because of Ollie often I find people like the doctor
---
Wow that basment build is nasty, I love it. Yeah I've been feeling the power with demo got gen rushed  yesterday due to some drunk shenanigans then managed to patrol the last 3 gens and still get 3 survivors
---
bc I am pissed off and just want out right now instead of waiting for even 5 seconds
---
seriously. lots of people here are acting like there's some kind of logic going on in the mind of a person who DCs. in reality, the vast majority are just throwing a tantrum with no logic at all. and that's obvious from the people who DC while getting hooked, when the more rational choice is to end your game by suiciding on hook, which requires you to hold one button for 3 seconds.
---
Wicked tattoo incoming!
---
Except.. you lost by doing that. And nothing makes me happier than being chased for 5 gens and dying so the other 3 can escape. The only pain caused is to yourself. The survivor you killed knew exactly what they were doing.
---
this.
---
445 and about 14 or 19 minutes ago
---
I understand as long as you also understand I get to be angry about it.
---
Your first scenario you already suggested that 90 second unbreakable which I said I was fine with.
---
Your second scenario is essentially the same as dcing and isn’t beneficial to the killer. 
---
My positive scenario was both good for the killer and survivors. Not only that but applies in general even if the survivors don’t get a gen done they still have more time to work on it, hide, go unhook another survivor, etc they have more time to do whatever is
---
The 90 second unbreakable you suggested is what solves the problem in your first scenario not people being able to suicide while down.
---
gotta blast!
---
Throwing a tantrum is not equal to stopping playing a game because I am not enjoying it. It is smarter to just stop playing before you get more heated or upset.
---
Did not read the fine print with surge thanks, thankfully I've still been popping it due to still learning shred 😅
---
This sub considers anything that hurts their feelings toxic. Which pretty much amounts to starting the game and clicking Ready.
---
Doc camping in shock mode is because you can get 100% guaranteed grab on the unhooking survivor by spamming m1.  It requires 2 people to rescue anyone against a doctor doing that.
---
As for the other, sounds like you play solo and get fucked by the suck without friend crowd.   They will always let the random die.
---
Rage. Rage and salt.
---
I play with a 4man swf and we almost always either all escape or no one escapes I’ve DCd two times once against a Michael Myers who was teaming with a Claudette and by teaming I mean completely ignoring her and as soon as she would pull me off the hook Mikey would down and hook me again and they did that for all of my hooks and I quit during the sacrifice animation second time was similar to the Mikey except it was a ghostface and a meg running no mither and I quit on the second hook
---
Same here, we play protect the president...
---
No I think you are right it wouldn’t be fair that way but I feel like if you look at it from an eye for an eye standpoint it still wouldn’t be fair. In my opinion camping is significantly worse unfortunately I can’t really think of a way for killers to be toxic that is equal to tea bagging so I hate to say it but I guess camping would be an acceptable revenge.
---
This doesn't really solve the main issue. The other people in the game will still have their game ruined, they will most likely de-pip, and this will still make them frustrated with the game. Losing progress because a mentally unstable person DC'd after going down isn't a great way to spend my day
---
removed for being uncivil calm down if we get more reports we will be forced to do a temp ban for uncivil behavior
---
u stupid
---
Same. If they're still wiggling when I swing and shake my head, they're going on that hook
---
Most of those things have solutions outside of rage. Slugging killer? Bleed out timer. 
---
Sand bagging teammates? Kill yourself first hook.
---
Body blocking killer? That’s bannable if they refuse to make a move. I use body blocking all the time to rev my saw, get a full face of vomit, etc. it’s a valid tactic if not abused.
---
Uh no, why?
---
translation for non-incels: Hi everyone, please allow me to show you how petty and childish I am!
---
It's a hybrid of rank and casual, as you are given a rank, progress towards the next rank, and criteria that you must fill out if you wish to 'rank up'
---
not likely. people who DC arent thinking ahead, the majority are just throwing a tantrum without caring about consequences. 
---
proof: they could always suicide on first hook before, and if they did, they'd at least get a few bloodpoints for it. but they DC'd instead, thus getting the same end result, minus any points.
---
aren't you the person that literally just bitched about DCs?
---
And so The Oni was cursed to reside within the hawkins lab alone, forever.
---
Good movie tho.
---
I'm a survivor main. I wasn't trying to say they were the same, but rather that I have more issue with the game making it a problem than with people abusing it. Mori is an ez win, gen rushing exists because some killers aren't good at applying pressure and the objective is very simple.

People are allowed to stop playing a game that they own whenever they decide they want to stop playing, especially if they aren’t having fun. And there’s never (and should never) gonna be a way to prevent that. All you can do is complain about it, but it falls on deaf ears. Also not everyone has the same circumstances. Some very VERY sensitive people play this game and I’d much rather they dc than harm themselves or someone else. I don’t care if this is downvoted it needed to be said.
---
At least I’m not writing an essay complaining about a game and then running to go through people’s post histories when they call me out for being the whiny entitled bitch that I am.
---
Well, Whittling isn't hard its just kind of, painful, after awhile. If your hands are not used to it and you hold the knife wrong your hands cramp super fast, or sometimes they wont cramp until you put the knife down and suddenly you only feel regret and pain.
---
I am no avid whittler but I think anyone could make a huntress mask to fit a head in a month and a half given materials, and tools.
---
idk why people insist on using their inner strength when i'm there to heal them. I know it's faster but why not save it for when I'm NOT there to heal you?
---
unless they're mangled because it's *significantly* faster that way
---
Bit late but maybe you haven’t figured it out, trap catches are physical crabs from the traps, not just trapping them. If you swat a trapped survivor and down them it won’t count, you have to grab them within the trap like you’d grab someone off a gen.
---
Best not to read endgame chat ever. 
---
With that said, I main survivor and I don't understand how killers can expect us to read their minds and not wiggle for the points.
---
Almost everyone one agrees to farming. Of course as a killer or survivor, you can just power through the objective and end your game early.
---
Point proven.
---
Legit I’m a green rank and I played a game against a camping Huntress and we all made it out. So, you get 4K’s against bad survivors, not just a specific rank.
---
Bill as well could be in there
---
Imagine you wanted to buy an Uncommon Toolbox but dead by daylight said :(/);)&amp;$#%
---
Ok but if I can get patched up from a katana and a metal hammer I'm not gunna question fixing a stab wound lol.
---
If it's the one in the 3rd tome, healing yourself counts for those challenges.
---
I played a few matches inbetween and my penalty level still escalated, so it is definitely "remembered" at least in the short term. I have no idea how long the penalty level will be remembered for.
---
Personally I take back my misgivings about the system. I think it definitely puts habitual ragequitters in their place with rapidly escalating penalties and it even detected an alternate method of DC (Killing the game via task manager.)
---
My next DC will probably be my last since I'm actually sorta scared what comes after the hour penalty. (I got 26 minutes left on my hour penalty) and I think the one after the 6th ban (Whatever that happens to be. I'm guessing 6 hours or even 12 hours) will likely be a 24 hour ban. 
---
Next ban will be my last, and I'll mix it up once again, this time by pulling the plug and seeing if that's detected.
---
Nea/feng are cringe
---
Nobody enjoys losing but only little kids that can’t control their emotions quit because they’re not enjoying it. It’s the definition of sore loser.
---
&gt; But how do they fix people dcing because the killer downed/slugged them? What about the people who dc because to give hatch or just out of pettiness?
---
The amount of people who DC because they're upset vs those that DC for hatch are not comparable. One happens immensely more than the other one. DC'ing should carry a way bigger punishment for it, as you're ruining the game for 4 other people who spent X amount of time queuing for it in the first place.
---
You can keep sounding like a petulant child by trying to insult me, or you can refute the fact that the in game loading screens and tutorials, which were added after the ranking system, contradict you.
---
Jesus 50 dollars? What the fuck.
---
You can buy *all* of the materials to make this for less than that.
---
yeah, zombie slaying, nam vet Bill would kick their asses
---
that's unlikely given unless you down the survivor super fast, hook them, and then find the other survivor super fast, all within a minute. And no matter how bad you complain about new ds at least it tries to be anti tunneling. Old ds had was simply a free escape no matter how the killer plays. You just can't convince me that old ds is better no matter how hard you try. It was changed for a reason. Maybe if you know what it feels like as a killer to spend 5 minutes chasing a survivor only for them to get away, you'd understand. it sounds like your just biased towards survivors. Maybe you should take the fact that this post has no upvotes and 50 comments as a hint that almost everyone disagrees with you for a reason.
---
I mean, you could also just not dc.
---
ok spirit main

Sounds quite interesting I suppose I will just have to see what he is like when he is changed. Thanks for the information.
---
Yeah, no one said you had to DC when you get slugged. I have no sympathy.
---
I play against her like she has cp all the time anyway. Stay away gross lady! 
---
I manage to avoid the illness for at least half the match usually, doing gens and saves and sb away whenever she lights up sc.
---
well… you do you
---
But you lose the point that: all those things aren't fun, why do I have to be forced to stay in a game for so long? I didn't nothing wrong, yet I have to do nothing for a solid 5 minutes while the killer refuse to just hook the team and slug all, I have to literally farm with the killer to kill myself because my team are assholes, and I can't literally do nothing to get away from a game if the killer decides to bodyblock in a corner. Mean while, I could just DC and go to a new game and play a real match, but hey, dc = toxic, no matter what
---
Depends. If I as a medicore ghostface get followed by a really good (but cocky) survivor, Id habe a hard time getting anything else done
---
what the hell did he say
---
Use ruin to slow the game down **JUST A LIL BIT**

How many irredecent shards do you earn per level?
---
I just started using Pop on the Cannibal. Has it always been only active after hooking a survivor. It lasts for 30 seconds or so now. I couldnt imagine having it every time hitting a gen but it was thst way right?
---
As you DC more the amount of time you have to wait increases, that is what they meant by repeat offenders.
---
Have I been wrong to not take teabagging personal? I’ve thought it was hilarious since playing Halo 2 in middle school. I just laugh when I see people doing it to me and think it’s good fun. Now I’m starting to think they’re trying to make me mad, which they’re failing at.
---
and in purple ranks it's enough to pip but in red rank you waste 8 min for nothing. Moreover, it's just against the game rules to farm, as indicated in the report section of the game.
---
Bunny hopping is still a thing although not as big a deal as it used to be, but then there's the molly and smoke bug that lets you basically see through a smoke.
---
&gt; Who the hell is upvoting this?
---
everyone who notices that this is why DC penalties wont change almost anything. people who DC do it out of emotional tantrums, not logic. so weighing the consequences carefully has no effect, because they never do so to begin with.
---
Like I'm not already used to not being able to get into a game for 20 minutes
---
Third seal should still work, since it doesn't specify basic attacks.

You are overly stubborn about trying to put someone else down.

I guess so.
---
I got 8 in one game.  Play SUPER altruistic.  Medkit, Botany Knowledge, Empathy, and the perk to heal super fast off hooks.  I also used Autodidact that game and just had some really lucky plays
---
read patch notes.
---
I low key want the skins doe
---
Developers gave out their exclusive code-only Cosmetics because of people listing for a ridiculous price and not always delivering after they receive payment.
---
&gt; you agree to play the game 
---
And you’re allowed to change your mind about that whenever you want lol
---
I'd be fine with spawning them near gens if they weren't in line of sight of the gen. There are totem spawns that are kinda tucked away. It just sucks when you know a totem is gonna last all of 30 seconds because the survivors have a literal beacon leading them to it.
---
Were you a meg and the legion p3? Suffocation pit as the map?
---
4th one is 30.
---
MFW it called whittling. I was joking but that was cool to read.
---
Because, no, it isn't fun when you use Irridescent Head *and* tunnel and losing out on &lt;5k points believe it or not isn't the end of the world. Sorry, having a flashback to a game last night.  
---
  
---
Also the d/c penalty is only -1 pip now, so if the survivor is gonna de-pip it effectively makes no difference.
---
Unlocking a teachable perk just adds that perk to the list for being put on the bloodweb, you will still need to find it and purchase it for the other survivors.
---
I was on suffocation pit when it happened, I believe I was Steve
---
true, thank you. so are you saying i should get self care teachable so i can put it on meg?
---
I got it by healing myself with a medkit

Some do it to deny you a few points because totally worth it i guess?
---
what I'm afraid in all of this is that, when people get enough penalties stacked, they will just close the game and could find a new.
---
No amount of streamers gonna help.
---
It didn't though.
---
I wish I wasn't having terrible connection issues today :( I can't even get the game to load right.
---
&gt; If you sat down with friends to play monopoly you wouldnt just get up and leave the table if you weren't having fun anymore. And if you would youre a shitty fucking friend.
---
If you’ve ever played monopoly someone almost always leaves before the game is over...and no one take it personally or thinks anything of it because it’s a game with no meaning or rewards.
---
I was just sent this over PSN lol. I love how you take this and claim that it was my message that was deleted. How are you enjoying your ban? You deserve it after calling me a "fucking n***er" censoring myself here because I'm not racist. :)
---
What are we supposed to see here?
---
so everyone will just alt+f4 instead since u gonna get time penalty
---
I would personally pick your favorite looking Survivor and start working on getting your favorite perks on them. Different Survivors outside of their screaming and noises are the exact same.
---
I can't remember the players but I did it to a meg. I might have done it to other people too but that's how i play legion.
---
Claudette's perks are very good.  Botany Knowledge increases healing speed, self care allows you to heal yourself, and empathy allows you to see injured survivors auras which is useful for seeing when the killer is chasing somebody.
---
Another surv to consider is Dwight for we'll make it.  It increases healing speed by 100% for 90 seconds at tier 3, so if you go for unhooks a lot it is a great replacement for Botany knowledge
---
okay got it, thanks!
---
It's almost every game for me.
---
Sore losers uh..  find a way.
---
Yes, dodging because of cosmetics is silly but you do you I suppose.
---
ah okay, thanks man! hoping to get better and get good

Yeah, no...

Yeah, I ended up getting no kills lol

Are you seriously arguing that people should be able to DC because otherwise they might harm someone?

okay, ill keep that in mind for next time

You gotta make one using the footage of Brock dropping some kid down the stairs. It's a classic

---

---

---
You're bitching that the killer is playing in a way to win the game?
---
Your reasoning being "fun for anyone" as if your opponent is somehow responsible for your fun?
---
Do you play in a way that's fun for the killer? Do you refuse to complete gens too quickly? Do you refuse to use god-loops? Do you refuse to flashlight save? Do you not use DS or BT?
---
Why is it that every entitled survivor that cries about "The killer needs to play in a way that insures we have fun!" never gives a fuck about the killer's fun? Why is it that every entitled survivor that cries about the community's enjoyment never considers the killer to be part of the community.
---
thanx so much! i’m s survivor main but her esthetics are just too rad not to draw
---
I think I may have been one. P3 Steve, if that does help recall
---
I beat the fuck out of my dick
---
If the 3 gen daily had popped up you would have seen the Claudette crying next to the campfire...
---
Exactly, i choose A, why should i play a game that i will not enjoy?
---
Wouldn’t that guarantee a down on last survivor?
---
I don’t think it would work exactly as you put.
---
Survivors rank up really quickly where as Killer can barely safety pip. Survivor rank is akin to playtime not skill, Killer rank is akin to how "sweaty" they play.

On the map the gameplay was mainly around the pit and there was a hill and an exit on the right side of the pit. I think all the players were prestiged. I was green rank.
---
god damnit
---
Cleansing is better. Depends on map, but i mean if you're half decent at hiding it doesn't do a damn thing for her to have her corrupted purge.
---
I can safely say as a swf if you cleanse immediately after getting away it fucks all of her momentum. Killers having to walk to do anything other than their objective wastes a LOT of time.
---
Please forgive my ignorance to the whole story. In any case good on Fnatic for redoing the match then
---
What if i dont want to be slugged for 4 minutes
---
You are really such a child.
---
Because if you DC you're not only being childish bc the game is not going the way you like but you're also harming your team. leaving them to a 3 man situation where you will discourage them to keep playing the match and also giving the killer a big advantage
---
We love being slugged for 4 minutes!!
---
When you gotta kill but he lookin like an extra good boy
---
Csgo never crashed for me, and if it did, I can join the match again. DBD crashed like 3 or 4 times and I started playing like 3 months ago
---
thankfully ctrl-alt-delete works for me, it just sucks especially when it happens near the end of game that's going really well.
---
Uh... the devs are the ones who set it up like that, are you stupid? 😂😂🤮
---
Jesus legion needs a rework
---
No Pop, no DL, no thana just ruin.  I can give you props for this since it wasn't a slow down build.  GGs keep up the good killer build.
---
Damn you guys it's just a joke.
---
Meg. Self care sucks now.
---
Lol I never used the n word hahaha stop lying. And I wasn't even using ruin lol how are you gonna complain about lightborn and then lie and pretend i didn't even use it.
---
I would get sprint burst and quick and quiet first. 
---
As a long time player, I don’t run those. But for a new player it’s more helpful to escape the killer and evade his easier as opposed to self care. Your teammates can heal you.
---
The wording makes it sound like you're serious
---
Alot of people seething about these changes. This community has alot of manchildren. Dont play the game if you cant keep your emotions in check and have to ruin the game for your 3 other teamates.
---

---
Yep it’s called rage quitting for a reason lol
---
This deserves a grammy
---
It seems like it goes 1, 5, 15 and 30
---
The first is basically free in comparison
---
I also see a lot of killers thinking they're supposed to win because theyre the killer and the "power role" which I think is the funniest thing ever.
---
It's also against the game to be a cunt in end-game chat, yet no one has ever been banned, despite reported death threats, racism, homophobia, etc....
---
*Clearly* the best combo is Steve wearing the Scoops torso and legs while rocking sunglasses. You never go full Scoops, it's hella unlucky
---
His power is so crap it's unbelievable x'D
---
Brilliant idea! Surprising how nobody ever came up with this suggestion in 3 years of DBD existence. ^/s
---
Because you are being an asshole, if you don’t enjoy the experience of the game that’s on you, you should be punished for dcing and not the others, when you leave a match, the killer gets less points than he would have gotten, the survivors have a disadvantage, and the match just basically goes aids, if you don’t wanna play a match, then simple, uninstall.
---
And that justifies innocent people getting banned apparently
---
It takes any type of disconnect as a DC.  So feel free to fuck off with that idea.    If you wanna defend those with connection issues, get your shit sorted, then come back to play.
---
Sometimes I see my teammates gets facecamped but noone else in the team. Just that specific survivor. I dont know the true reason
---
i
---
It’s not just killers, if I get a NOED off survivors often act like I just ate their first born child.
---
Lol didn't even get banned cause I wasn't the one sending hate for no reason. Here you are still coming at me even when you're ass was the one trying to ban me for no reason. And now your'e making stuff up just sonyou don't look bad. Didnt even facecamp you. Hahaha get over it already and hold that L.

Anyone who wants to see the rest of those messages here you go~ basically his message was removed because he called me a "f**king ni**er" because he couldn't handle being called out on camping and running lightborn when there was only one flashlight. XD poor guy. Cry to Reddit more. Also I'd like to thank the person who sent me this because it gave me laughs about how salty he still is. Our match was hours ago.

I actually like this idea
---
How would that help at all, if someone leaves they are still on disadvantage you sped head
---
It was assumed from what he said. And i hope you realize that what you said would be learned very quickly, and survivors would just have less places to look when searching for hex totems (of totems in general if you mean all totems). Thus making your idea worse for killers, and easier for survivors?
---
Said it before I’ll say it again.
---
The idea of a DC penalty for this game isn’t very smart. People will just kill themselves on hook and the only people left who DC will be those who are either facing a hacker, their game DCs or they get trapped in a corner by a killer.
---
Basically it bans people who don’t deserve it and doesn’t effect those who do.
---
Lol how are you gonna lie hahahah Incalled you a child cause your'e acting like one even now.
---
I'm in green ranks and everyone just rushes hook when I camp unless they're a SWF.
---
I'm salty but here you are coming at me and lying outbof your'e ass
---
This change would have a larger negative effect than a positive one. A killer who is camping with insidious doesn't care if the bar goes down, only that others go for the save. If the bar doesn't go down that killer will sit there for the 5 generators and will still sit there waiting, keeping that camped survivor hostage until the very end of the game.
---
You only get punished if you manually disconnect, as far as I know
---
2 woooshes in one!
---
They weren't really a problem.
---
Lol I'm admittedly terrible at preforming Ruin Skill Checks. 
---
When I see a teammate approach and proceed to work on the same generator as me - I'll stay with them until I fail my first Hex Skill Check.....then I'm gone ✌🏾 
---
I try to avoid that heat from slowing the gen progress 🤣🤣
---
Okay so if I get trapped in a corner or the game bugs in such a way that I can’t die/win, I deserve to be banned?

I agree - there are definitely some responses in this thread that promote poor gameplay sportsmanship/ethics, and I'm not sure how they rationalise those views, but it doesn't mean that they (or all survivors) support both DC penalties and DCing (which was what I was responding to). I suspect that a lot of the people who DC don't actually support the penalties, because that doesn't make sense. Of course, there will always be hypocritical people that somehow do make sense of it in their own minds.
---
My concern was mostly with the way that the first commenter in this chain lumps survivors all in one bucket, like they all feel the same way about things.
---
To comment on the thread topic, the only time I would support DC'ing is if there's a game breaking bug, or if there's a legitimate hostage situation (such as survivors not working on objective and repeatedly moving between lockers so the killer can never find them, or a killer bodyblocking the remaining survivor(s) in a place they cannot attempt to complete the objective).
---
they tried this on PTB a long time ago and found that it also punished killers just playing normally when survivors were overly altruistic because *sometimes* camping **IS** a legit strategy and the right thing to do.
---
Hahahaha this is too much. You messaged me first crying about a perk. Lie about not only what happened in the game, bug even lying about what I even said in the first place. The picture you posted literally shows you being salty and calling me a coward for using a perk to counter three flashlights. Grow up. I posted the you being salty and you couldn't handle it. Now go back and try to actually be good instead of just bitching at killers for playing the game.

Due to the game being incredibly difficult to balance, I can see this as only hurting the community, sure it’s annoying to have someone dc but it’s even worse being forced to finish an unfun game or suffer a lockout. Regardless I’m still going to leave games that seem unfun or unfair ( the reason I play video games) to me. Lock me out all you want, I’ll just find another game to support.

New matchmaking bugs(one nasty one that only started happening to me a patch or two ago would cancel my join and give me like 3 error messages), random dodges, 3man lobby bugs- killers on ps4 have been dc’ing after something not in their favor happens like the plague on ps4 lately. More stuff. 
---
I think everyone’s having a bad time with matchmaking atm to be honest.

People where quite literally killing themselves to get the unhook. 1 guy gets down and *everyone* comes running and crowds the hook.

Its even worse because the first DC wasnt even on a hook.  A claudette got injured but juked the killer, and when I tried to heal her, she just did the backwards run, tbagged, and DC'd.  The next person DC'd on a single down, and the last guy suicided when I was right next to him.  Didnt even get to get the points for a safe unhook, he wasnt being camped.  I tried to get mercy from the killer, didn't wiggle or anything, but he hooked me anyways.  I am pretty sure that this is a game where everyone de-pipped because two survivors decided to be assholes.
---
If you find them and they dont have or cant find a med-kit then yes, but isnt that basically the same as Pig.
---
Good luck on the rest of your games. All your good lick went into that
---
Iron will is way better l. Pretty much no punishment for saying injured and just heal up when you encounter someone
---
It clearly says "camps with bbq" as the first message. You're only making yourself look worse here by lying.
---
Not that easy when everyone is competing in a race for the unhook and runs around looking for people to heal instead of doing gens
---
And now she's even on here to lie and cry lol. Even though the game was hours ago
---
When you get what you want but not what you need.
---
Yah I’ve had allot of those and the killers are literally fucking stupid and go full sweat to make maybe 6-8k base points...
---
Kinda... She wants to be one but all kidnapped girls die within a week.
---
I thought more of the cliché horror movie mother, a bit elderly
---
This is really good! I hope you continue to do art and learn to love and enjoy it without encouragment😊
---
I wasted like 90% of my flashlights for that shit. Only got it when a farming ghostface helped me.
---
Can I get my Billy flick back already?
---
Elaborate how in what way they are the same, I may be missing something.
---
There is a perk that does this.
---
Just like everything else in this game besides the demogorgon. What are you even on?
---
Is it?
---
Shut the fuck up Carl
---
Lol so me 24 meters away is camping then? Keep going lol. Get over it you lost and you're stil salty about it. All your doing now is making me laugh.
---
I mean ,she cut off her own toe to save someone from plague. That's at least giving 6k BP in altruism
---
:/ theres a lot of comments because I reply to most of them
---
And lol yeah theres no upvotes because this sub is mostly survivor mains lol
---
It was.
---
I just need one flashlight save plz it's the only challenge I haven't done 😭😭😭😭
---
I cannot hit Ruin skillchecks worth anything. On the days I can, i'm lucky. On the days I can't, I just try to find the killer and loop. Feelsruinman
---
How about that as a skin for the wraith and clown but still a man can dream
---
I mean, there's not much to be talked about atm. We also have threads for discussions instead of everyone just posting about the same thing
---
You should make one with the clip of Rollins turning on The Shield.
---
I would watermark this image before somebody yoinks it, incredibly clean and looks great!
---
Can’t wait for you to get banned :)
---
It only tells them you're coming even earlier, you need to be sneaky, not loud...
---
That's a blessed thought
---
I suspected this will happen because of how competent this dev seem to be.
---
You're also asking the same thing.

it's a funny link I usually send salty people

I love it haha

Not a great idea :/ would be unbalanced

this is simply amazing but why do all of the heads have Susie's hair?
---
I need a Jake Park one in my life

I just never do mercy and also if they are toxic they get the hook big time

6 hours for 6th DC.

---
heh, he got you good
---
that’s red dude... i think you’re color blind bro
---
What? Apparently everyone knows those things but I can't find anyone saying them.
---
BP isnt as important to majority of players, and the dc time isnt long enough, if it was 30 mins  first time up to 24 hours in intervals. It'd actually work
---
The heads are meant to be like tumors growing out of Franks body, Susie's hair is part of the tumor, but the serum is unstable, so it grows in patches all over Franks upper torso, similar to Huntress' patches of fur on her blight skin :)
---
no it's different. i report you to the devs if you keep harassing me
---
Goals with Behavior are rarely met, that's kind of the point. It's embarrassing that they announced these at the tail end of 2018 and we're literally about to go into 2020 and they STILL aren't even close (most likely) to launching them.
---
https://youtu.be/Wmg4HuEMJtU?t=21

Be careful about coming out of power to punish that. If they’re at a powerful loop then that might be what they’re hoping for.
---
Legion rise up
---
r/Oinkers_
---
Why should he dc and not the killer
---
Well they gave that to oni and then realized survivors are a bunch of babies.
---
This will be fun when those unknown error boots you right back to title screen. 
---
Instead of solving the actual problem as to why people DC, of course they apply a name aid which will kill queue times.
---
Then it can deactivate at end game
---
It's not even a good perk is is unusable if surviors cleanse every dull totem. Idk ppl still fall for noed
---
Easy fix for everyone: enable survivors to bleed out twice as fast if they want. If a survivor DCs, the game doesn't count them as dead until they would have bled out (while sped up) or until the hook sacrifice animation would have finished (having missed all escape attempts and without struggling), depending on if they are currently hooked.
---
Or just make it so hex totems have a lingering effect. So after e.g ruin is destroyed, it lasts for x/y/z seconds. Survivors shouldnt be punished for finding totems quickly, just need better spots or an idea like this.
---
Besides a boosted flashlight try using empathy. There’s almost always that time between first hit and down for you to see them, get over there, and get in place for the save
---
Just making totem spawns not complete ass would be better.
---
Honestly from the look of it all, it didn’t seem so transformative like Freddy changed. Really the biggest change I remember was the passive Terror Radius = Passive madness gain was gone in exchange for a singular blast that hits anyone in the terror radius but has a cooldown that gives everyone instant madness. 
---
Also I saw an addon that gives skillchecks a change to rotate counterclockwise and I’m very excited for that.
---
Nope, kindred is just a universal perk so if two people are on the hook they both could be activated and you wouldn’t notice, I don’t think the status effects on pc show up as a double either
---
Yah, not_queen and peanits out running around telling everyone it would be “end of summer” “End Of Summer” “EnD Of SuMmEr” then started  “end of Fall propaganda”
---
Yet that time is almost upon us and no word from BhVR Interactive on dedicated servers on all platforms...
---
Look by your perks, shows kindred is active plus you can see other survivors. So you know
---
Not the same as pig. With pig you can get the helmet off by yourself or take hatch.

---
&gt;Just making totem spawns not complete ass would be better.
---
Which is something they are doing with the rework of maps, like Preschool and even new maps have good totem spawns. The main issue is SOME totem spawns on older maps since even then, there are some good spawns.
---
It's like they finally have power that they don't have IRL. I know what kind of a game this is but it clearly brings the batshit insane ones into the mix.
---
Sometimes makes you wonder how high the devs are when they come up with killers like Legion....yea break chase after you wound survivor...I would prefer frenzy to increase base speed by a small amount after a hit
---
Ace you should kill yourself
---
How long does the stacked penalty last for? If you DC a month after your last disconnect im guessing its reset by that point
---
Everyone is within the 6 + or - rank requirements set by BhVR
---
You said my name?
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here’s how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor’s rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there’s no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
I guess I'll have to try that ty.
---
I’d rather see them have cleansing requirements, like one generator or one hook, or even just “60 seconds have passed”. But the current implementation might be what BHVR wants, complete inconsistency between games and ranks.
---
My favorite is when I run second wind and the person who unhooked me follows me around crouching and pointing. 
---
Uh, if you COULD heal me I'd let you. But ya know.
---
its literally not possible for it to be much better then now. If they make it so it can't spawn near gens, it becomes easier to find because u check spots it can spawn away from the gens, reducing the area to look at. If they make it not spawn in sight, its slightly better, but still the exact same result of spawning near gens etc.
---
0 corrupt purge is better than 1, you do realize that?
---
I remember being a Jake in beta thinking this was a stealth game. At least the killers were probably confused.
---
&gt;Nope, kindred is just a universal perk so if two people are on the hook they both could be activated and you wouldn’t notice, I don’t think the status effects on pc show up as a double either
---
OP is talking about the new kindred which shows everyone's aura when YOU have the perk equipped but someone else is on the hook. 
---
You don't know if the hooked player might also have kindred which would be a vital piece of information since the other 2 survivors would be seeing the same auras as you.
---
If you get angry enough to yank your console out of the wall I don’t think you’ll be getting back on soon. 
---
Unless you *really* like channeling that unhealthy vibe.
---
Yes...another one...but I want Bubba rework  first
---
&gt; is just called basic human rights,  
---
lolwat. No one is talking about the government banging down doors over this. There are social consequences for things you have the "right" to do.
---
and thats a good way to approach.
---
Sensitive people play this horror game at their own risk. Boo hoo I got downed first so I’m going to kms? Ok cool survival of the fittest, you don’t need to be reproducing anyways so go on w ya bad self 🙄
---
Holy crap that is a steep increase
---
literally every video ever talking about any speedrun of any game made in the source engine talks about how b hopping is a bug from the source engines physics that is in every game that is made from the engine
---
BHVR can easily fix this.
---
If your kindred is active, just light up your equipped perk. If the other player has kindred, just show the small kindred icon outside of your 4 perks.
---
I agree, but a week ago on this reddit I was told I was dumb for believing that ranks don't matter because are better players so I wanted to show an example of this to you all.
---
I assume this was at low ranks? The second DC might have been SWF with the first, or just didn’t want to try to salvage the match while hamstringed by a missing player.
---
I don’t slug for the 4k to avoid this, when the 3rd victim is down I hook them and hope that shithead Claudette is hiding in the corner somewhere 40meters or further for my bbq to kick in. I then lick my lips and say let the games begin... normally works out and I get them and sometimes they get the hatch. Very rare they get the doors since they are normally right next to each other...
---
I'm ok with it.
---
He's such a bad design to play against or even play as that I'd rather him completely dumpster tier so I never have to see him.
---
He is the exact opposite of fun. I swear that was the Devs design intention going in.
---
I agree
---
I never understood why people would use something like mori-iri head, its obviously unfun as hell for the people against it and 80% of the community would most likely dc so it's not even fun for the killer
---
I think, No habla español.
---
Yellow and brown ranks...
---
I thought totems where suppose to spawn in the tile/ local area of a gen. Don’t get me wrong I hate my totems spawning literally next to gens as much as the next person. But I thought each gen roughly had one totem in its area as a way of spreading out the totems on the map, just like chest spawns. Might be incredibly wrong here.
---
&gt;I agree, but a week ago on this reddit I was told I was dumb for believing that ranks don't matter because are better players so I wanted to show an example of this to you all.
---
They matter to some extent. 
---
A survivor rank 20 with barely any perks is obviously bad at the game (no offense intended) but a red ranked survivor who got there through hiding, doing gens and unhooking, doesn't necessarily mean they are good at the game.
---
That's ridiculous. It's so severe. In a well made competitive game fair enough, but in a shoddily made party game? I don't why they take their own game so serious, especially given how much crazy shit is in there and bad map design.
---
I wouldn't be as fussed if it wasn't for the fact that it seems to be taking everything as a disconnect, crashes and error messages included.
---
I don't think your salty at all i think your struggling with the disparity in ranks at the moment which makes it totally unfun if you want to chill and have a fair game.
---
Cleansing is fine if the map is huge like Thompson House or Temple of Purgation. If you cleanse in the farthest point possible, it forces her to go out of her way and stop patrolling in order to get the fountain.
---
Would love it if everyone in this community could think with this kind of logic. The amount of times the killer called me/the survivors stupid (or other insults) genrushers.
---
The only time you can actually call survivors genrushers is when you get 4 people with commodious toolboxes and prove thyself. That's definitely rushing.
---
Because the killer loses BP and possible pip
---
So you make up the percentage that it’s ok to DC if the killer has a mori? Not cool. Take the L and move on to another game. 
---
Plus Mori’s are cool. Makes it an actual horror game 
---
If Moris could be used only on 3rd hook, COOL. Unless a single mori can be used whenever COOL. BUT DONT DC. That’s childish
---
This is perfection.
---
Survivors can just kill them self’s in hooks while killers can’t leave without getting punished if they don’t like how the game is going. Ofc u shouldn’t dc but there are some games what u just don’t want to play in any way possible.
---
you humble me sir and I appreciate it
---
Sounds like you just need to improve
---
agreed
---
I'd rather have Homie the Clown.
---
"wa... What's he up to? Trapper, you see that?" - "*mumbo jumbo in ghost*" - "let's slash him though"
---
yup my point exactly when people say ranks matter.
---
yeah and they need to change it to 1
---
Wraith - either Clapper, any Windstorm, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, A Nurse's Calling, flex perk of choice (Save the Best for Last, Pop Goes the Weasel, Thanatophobia, etc.). Down survivor, hook survivor near 3-gen, patrol the gens, wait for them to try a Borrowed Time save, decloak and slug the unhooked survivor, chase and hook the second survivor. If they try to kite, hit them once *if possible* for Mangled, then go back to patrol the gens and the slug.
---
Freddy - run one Chains/Rope with basically anything that isn't pallet Freddy or a Haemorrhage block. Pop Goes the Weasel, Corrupt Intervention, Discordance, Ruin - when Discordance lights up, snag your first survivor. One way or another this survivor is likely dead, because Borrowed Time won't work if you're asleep. If they're not abandoned, then you get one slug and another hook - rest of the game will go like the Wraith one. 
---
Plague - Apples or Emetics with Pop Goes the Weasel, Corrupt Intervention, Discordance, and Infectious Fright - you now have two minutes to put the game into an unwinnable state for survivors. If running double Emetics then get them Broken, and then down them for Infectious Fright. If you're running one or more Apples then just puke on everyone until they're infected and then use one of your "free" pools to slug the whole team.
---
Good survivors have counters, especially against the sort of common builds listed here, but it'll give you somewhere to start and a decent idea of what your strengths are as each of these killers.
---
I find it hilarious that you said killer mains make up 80% of this subreddit then laughs at the expense of long queue times. What’s the fucking truth? Make it make sense!
---
Thanks for proving my point, you couldn’t even touch on the issue and instead through your hurt emotions decided to attack me instead. Shame really.
---
A) how much will you sell them for?
---
B) can i get a custom one for my cosmeticed out legion
---
You dirty little thief. 😑😑
---
Thanks for the permission, I play both and haven't run ruin in 3 resets.
---
Exactly. Who wants to take the hit? if someone had their game crash on the loading screen a few games before, then they get the basement bug or stuck in a gen that's already a 5 minute ban. An error message after the game has been reported on here to count as a d/c too so that's 15 mins for something that isn't the players fault. God forbid you get that crash where the error reporter pops up too that's 30 mins then. I wish this were unreasonable but if you find 2 hours on a weekend to play it's entirely feasible this might happen.
---
Given how severe the time outs seem to escalate I don't see why anyone would want to take the hit.
---
You don't get to be the decider if a game is unfair, and ANY game someone dcs is unfun for everyone else involved. You are exactly the person that I hope gets locked out and if you want to support another game, go ahead the community doesn't want you.
---
Lol no
---
No. Bans for disconnecting start at 1 week I believe. They won't care if you "did it for science", they'll view it as disconnecting all the same and enforce that ban. People have done it on the forums before and been banned for it. You're still disconnecting on other people and they can't be seen to sweep a disconnecting ban under the rug.
---
its only for 60 seconds...
---
See, this is the kind of logic for why we need new game modes. Why is the entities entire ritual process made up of activating generators to power a gate? It pulls all these random people into its realm and tells them to go be a mechanic. It would make sense if the survivor you pick is placed in a set role, but every survivor is able to be a mechanic. I remember the devs mentioning how at first they wanted to make the escape be used with a car and each survivor is tasked with finding something that will get the car running. Something like that would be cool.
---
I'm not saying that the killer cant play to win at all but if, like I said someone abuses glitches, or something along those lines its not bad act the same way by dcing. 
---
And of course, it's a game, it's meant to have fun, no one plays the game to get angry (unless your a masochist, you do you), and it's the responsibility of everyone playing to make it an enjoyable experience for everyone. Killer included.
---
Yeah I actually do tbh, I usually make plays that keep the game interesting like go for saves and make sure that theres always something going on. I use godloops very rarely as it's only your priority if your sweaty and it doesnt really show your skill as a player. It's not that I dont flashlight save, I honestly dont use flashlights at all, they're kind of useless in my opinion, really just a waste of time compared to other items. No I use neither  ds or borrowed but I dont find either of those broken in moderation as it guides the game to be more interesting and fair for both sides.
---
I myself am a killer main and I understand that it sucks to be outnumbered 4 to 1 when people have complaints but even so I honestly believe in what I've said so far. it's ok to dc if the killer is being abusive, and it's ok to be abusive if the survivor acts the same. But what's most important is to try and create a community that values playing not to dominate the enemy but to have fun and have interesting matches.
---
The removal of stance switching *alone* will significantly improve his ability to deny pallets and vaults, without actually changing his core mechanic of "drive survivors batshit". It should make him more accessible *as well as* making him harder for survivors to predict.
---
It detects plug pulls too. Again I'm not going any farther at this point even in the name of science. Someone more masochistic than me has to pick up where I left off. 
---
I still have this lingering curiosity exactly how high it'll go and where exactly the line is where the penalties simply repeat (I.E. you get a 24 hour ban for example, and if you DC again, you just get another 24 hour ban since that's the max) or if the developers designed a system that has penalty levels in the double digits and dishing out week, month, or even year long bans if you keep it up. 
---
IMHO the system is perfect. You DC once or twice, could be internet issues, power outages, etc. the penalties start as a slap on the wrist. You keep DCing constantly, the penalties ramp up as it becomes more obvious the DCs are intentional. 
---
All it needs now are DC husks so even if people do DC you can hook them.
---
wow! absolutely incredible
---
Dude this sub is just where entitled, mediocre killers go to circle jerk each other after they lose a game. Oh no, survivors have learned how to beat your stupid hex ruin, sloppy butcher camp strat... better post a reddit thread about how toxic they are and complain that playing killer is too hard. I hate that little rank 10 killers with 200 hours in the game have such a majority presence here. This game needs way more people that play both killer and survivor. I'd be willing to bet a lot of money that well over half the people who are still left in this sub have never played survivor outside of grey ranks.
---
According to Google it means:

I don't think I have laughed like that at a comment before.
---
There are people here complaining about getting penalized because their internet drops and they get kicked out of the game. Bullshit. These are the same people who complain when their swf squad gets matched based on the highest rank in their squad and claim they just wanted to play with their friends who recently got the game. Just a bunch of toxic survivors who want to continue to abuse matchmaking to bully low rank killers and who want to disconnect when they get a killer they can’t bully. This is a step in the right direction BHVR, keep it up and don’t listen to those people.
---
Is it? I never knew if it was or not. Or if you could even prove that’s what they were doing. Idk. Just a thought.
---
So in essence it's just a fun little piece of trivia. Regardless of how it came about, none of the playerbase has an issue with it and it's now seen as a feature. I fail to see how two features and an inconsistent bug make csgo a more buggy game than dbd.

I really hate when people DC its just a shitty sperglord move but to be honest Mori is pretty fucking shitty so the seldom times I use it and people DC I dont particularly mind, although Ruin I rarely struggle with and at higher ranks if you don't run if you will get speedrunned like crazy unless you have a very good build or higher tier killer, my dumb ass however mains leatherface.
---
I will say though michael has that offering where he can instakill at tier 3 and that shit makes me wanna pack up my things drive to LA and punch jamie lee curtis right in the dick just for being associated with Halloween.
---
Wait, so you vs a camper and instead of just going and doing gens and winning, you did unsafe hooks then DCed? Uh...
---
Why is it censored? It goes perfectly
---
I think his stealth is what makes him so good. Of course his expose like Myers one hit is awesome but being able to sneak up on survivors and always make them worry about their surroundings is super strong. Watch Otzdarva for some great and educational Ghostface gameplay. A good choice for him is sloppy butcher cause not healing VS a Ghostface is really dangerous.
---
Just make survivors moan much louder while cleansing and it'll be balanced.
---
yeah ill need it
---
Oh right, never occurred to me there was even a pause menu in game. Thanks!
---
Is it? I actually am, I though it was green or yellow
---
I'm gonna make the holocaust look like a fucking joke
---
He's a survivor main, it only makes sense to him if it suits his narrative.
---
Why not both, because i agree for both
---
He literally already said it above the comment you replied to...
---
Such a scary game 😭😭😭
---
I guess everyone just forgot about optimization. Lol.
---
You can't report me to the devs for something that didn't even happen in the game lmao
---
Are they going to make skill checks in order for killers to hook someone? Because that's pretty easy as well. What about to stomp a pallet? 
---
Surviviors already have skill checks for gens,  healing, ds,  and dead head. Kills have none.
---
Me playing bumper billy all game then proceeding to face camp with no Ed
---
Ash is actually getting royalties for every purchase of his DLC. That's why he stays, voluntarily.
---
You are right, this is not good. This is why at the moment we are testing the feature. This test allows us to investigate cases and isolate problems like this that would cause the player to DC and receive a penalty (ie: gamebreaking gameplay issues, loading screen issues)
---
They're seemingly replacing their current "Automated System" they had in place which only really submits an account for review for something like an 80% DC ratio (It gets sent to BHVR, they hit the banhammer) with this new system which automatically dishes out punishments without any intervention by BHVR.
---
It wouldn't make much sense to "Double up" on a punishment like that. If I do get "Double Jeopardy" I can't really complain since I had it coming.
---
&gt;Yah when the killers are just being toxic trolls like this I would have left too.
---
If a killer is camping then just do gens and win, don't DC and ruin it for the other players.
---
If you can't just " do gens and win" then the killer isn't actually camping and there is nothing to complain about.
---
2018, optimization lies, 2019, dedicated server "goals" not met, 2020...?
---
I feel like this is aimed at the fact that ruin goes quickly, I feel that it would make hexs a bit to strong. As you could run huntress lullaby and thrill and then it's a done deal. Really Interesting idea
---
People who do this kind of thing are why we are getting these dc penalties. Dodge a few matches with ruin/mori and your queues just got 15/30 minutes longer.
---
Mori's are very questionable.  I'd rather they be limited to one person or be used on 3rd hook.
---
But come on man, destroying hex ruin after a hag or trapper trapped it, or getting it before spirit could phase walk back.  It's so satisfying.  I personally love going up against hex ruin.  One match I got 13 hex skill checks in a row and I felt like a god.  (even though I died in the end.)
---
I think it's okay.  Sure it's not the most fun in the world but Killer's could say the same about survs all bringing toolboxes into the match.  It's part of the game.
---
I have this happen every other game :) I would swap it but I don’t really like any of the other exhaustion perks.
---
Freddy is invisible at long range while awake and he has terror radius. When he gets closer, you start seeing glimpses of him. When really close you can see him all the time.

In dream world he has no terror radius, only the lullaby. He won't be invisible anymore.
---
Add-ons modify these.
---
This just happened to me today, i didn't even walk away, they just started mending in front of me.
---
Fellow moron reporting for duty.
---
Losing slugged survivors and survivors completely disappearing right in front of me happen to me way to often.
---
Let me get this straight, im getting tunneled, facecamped or facing a fucking red addons killer and im the asshole?
---
slowdown build. like ruin, thana, dying light and another perk of your choice (sloppy butcher maybe)
---
Been seeing this more and more often. I was playing yesterday and Luther away with dance with me and quick and quiet. I get out of the terror radius and stop running, then get instant downed out of nowhere with a chainsaw. The killer said he was right behind me the whole time on his screen. Total ass game play lol
---
But if you are an immersed survivor who is just trying to GTFO, then you might just as well not notice it.
---
For dcing? Yes, cause now your team needs to face that guy with one men down because you just didn’t feel like playing, so If you don’t feel like playing just uninstall
---
It’s always only been first pop after hook.
---
Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil, or Harry Mason from Silent Hill.
---
Or a survivor that’s just a quirky divorced dad that took his son to the woods one day and never came out, with perks related to sitcom dad tropes.
---
Like a perk called “Watching the Kids” where you can see any other survivors around you in a very small radius without them being injured. 
---
Or a perk called “Dad’s Turn” where as long as you haven’t done any co-op actions with another survivor for an amount of time, you can have a boost in activity for a short while when working with them again.
---
I agree with you. If an exploit is being abused or if an **actual** hostage point is used, then DCing should be fine. But those are so few and far between that they should almost never be an issue.
---
And if it is an issue, a screenshot sent to support should be enough to clear any accrued penalty for that instance of DCing. 
---
My major concern is how telling the comments in this thread are in regards to survivors not caring about the killer. All of these survivors (and I’d dare say most survivors in general) don’t consider the killer as equal player and member of the community.
---
They cry and rally around their idea of insuring fun gameplay, but they don’t include the killer’s fun in their arguments. They talk about sportsmanship and treating other players right, but they don’t bother to extend this to the killer.
---
Look at the people who say DCing is okay if the killer slugs. They don’t realize that you rarely pip if you don’t 4k. Slugging is the best way to play around the completely random, completely out of your control hatch and insure you 4k. These survivors talk about fun and enjoyment and sportsmanship, and then say that they don’t care about the killer’s 4k, they’re gonna DC to spite the killer and they shouldn’t be penalized for it.
---
The sheer level of hypocrisy is staggering. These people are so entitled, so lacking in compassion, so spiteful... They are willing to lose their score and risk penalties just to spite another player.
---
They don’t see the killer as an equal player. They don’t see the killer as an equal member of the community. They don’t even see the killer as a human being worth simple compassion and respect.
---
And they wonder why no one wants to play against them... Why survivor queues are taking 5, 10 minutes plus.
---
You are right, 30 second is low. The time on the Disconnect Penalties might be reviewed. For now we are testing the stability of the feature, we wanted the penalties to be more permissive.
---
I bet youre the person who always brings a key lmao gtfo
---
I play toxic survivors a lot and they annoy me. But no one is more infuriating then a toxic killer.
---
Sorry bud.
---
I LOLed
---
&gt;Wait, so you vs a camper and instead of just going and doing gens and winning, you did unsafe hooks then DCed? Uh...
---
She wasn't entirely camping, she was phasing around the hook area and since Spirit is so much fun, you can't know for sure where she is unless her power is recharging. Before you notice, the hooked player was reaching struggle already.
---
Also, I finished a generator and went for the unhook when this happened. I tried a safe unhook because he was reaching struggle anyway.
---
I DCed because killers like this make the game boring, specially at 5 or 4 gens and when you, as a survivor, don't care about ranking up.
---
If one person dcs everyone else can dc too, not sure why you wouldn’t dc out of an unfun match after ur team dcs.
---
**Monitor and Abuse**  
---
Terror is so low that with M&amp;A most folks don't have time to properly know where to safely run to when they finally hear you.
---
**Make Your Choice**  
---
As long as you place a trap near hooked survivor you can always down someone. It's probably the nastiest perk and killer power combo out there. Once folks find out about it  forces the rescuer to go into hiding.
---
**BBQ and Chili**
---
Nice to know where everyone is once you hook someone. Not much else to it.
---
**Hex: Ruin**
---
You have to find a way to slow the game down or else you'll constantly feel rushed to apply map pressure.
---
“quack.”
---
 I'm sick right now. In hopes of ending my sickness Laurie is gonna carry out my revenge.
---
Just a quick update on the billy and Buba request: I did start working on it, but it did not live up to my usual standards (yeah, you can imagine how awful that must have looked) but I'm gonna give it another shot in short.
---
Also, I've been thinking about setting up a twitter to have as an archive of the shit I draw and as a way for people to contact me easier, would anyone be interested or would you prefer it to be on another social media like instead or deviantart?
---
sea next post &lt;3
---
I mean if it happens again and again I would hope they would do something. I can't say they will, but I will say that I think they should.
---
I mean...I've heard a lot of horrible ideas, but **THIS ONE** takes the cake!
---
or you can suck it up and not be a bitch and dc
---
So... I need to play a game that i wont enjoy? Makes sense, people will still dc because they are fixing the sympton, not the cause, im one of them, i wont face a fucking facecamper or red addons bullshit if i dont wan to, if you want to get fucking tunneled thats on you.
---
I think I was the killer in this match?  If not, I had a very similar experience recently.  I probably would've been impressed, but was having a very bad night, so my opinion was more "of course" by that point.  Mostly because matchmaking had pit me, a rank 17 ghostface with 2 of his base perks to my name, against survivors with all their fancy perks, for the past 3 some matches.
---
I was also waiting a long time for it but I ended up just leveling her up :p
---
How is no one calling out the obvious horseshit about not seen any killers get anything other then 4 kills in months?
---
I believe it was someone on here that had the idea of Tiffany carrying Chucky around. She’d do the attacking, breaking, vaulting, and hooking while Chucky would be involved with the power and mori. Ever since I saw that, I can’t think of any better way to implement him into the game. It’d be similar to how they used Amanda instead of John.
---
You didn’t just displease they entity, you disgusted it.
---
Perhaps pop?
---
Why would this make sense?
---
Nono... I don’t think you were saying that. Just taking about the sad state of the community where more people do act that way than not.
---
And yes, I would love if everyone treated everyone with respect and worked to insure everyone enjoyed their time. But we can’t force someone to play a certain way and give up their enjoyment of the game just for another person’s enjoyment - Particularly when so many people place their enjoyment on winning/escaping.
---
Personally, when I play Killer, I tend to be mismatched due to my past time as a killer and how long it’s been since I dedicated myself to my killer rank. So I’m high ranks as killer despite having a lot of hours in the game. So when I do get so obviously and greatly mismatched, I try to take the big-boy, try-hard pants off.
---
But sometimes I want to insure I win, or have a challenge I’m aiming for, or whatever reason and I choose to play as hard as possible. That’s my right. That’s everyone’s right.
---
I’ve got no problem when someone wants to go easy on things, but to try and dictate that all Killers need to go easy and play in a certain way just because I want them to is absurd at best, downright tyrannical at worst.
---
And the whole “everything is toxic” aspect is even worse. Killing someone quickly and removing them from the game is the most efficient way to win. A 3v1 is easier than a 4v1 and if you can get one person on their 3rd hook as soon as possible, it’s worthwhile. But Tunneling is toxic because fun and enjoyment...
---
Camping is toxic. Patrolling an area is toxic. Slugging is toxic. Not breaking pallets is toxic. Playing Ghostface is toxic. Playing Legion is toxic...
---
Literally spawning in is somehow toxic to someone. I’ve seen people bitch at the killer because they spawned too close, as if the killer picked the spots.
---
And there are too many survivors with that mentality. It’s spread through the community to the point that these hypocritical, entitled survivors think they can just write “Toxic!” and it somehow proves their point.
---
It’s disgusting the sheer level of entitlement and hypocrisy among the community. And while “not every survivor” is correct, there is almost no survivors telling those entitled and hypocritical survivors that they’re wrong.
---
While I agree in theory, the problem is everyone has their own pet peeves in the game. You mention a lot don't like Spirit, I have no problem with her. However I always have to resist the urge to quit whenever I get a Hillbilly or Ghostface. They just bug me and those two and Legion are the only killers where I would rather not play the game at all than play against them. Other killers can be unfun but still tolerable unlike those 3. Likewise I hate hawkins as survivor because I can't find gens, but it's not disconnect worthy.
---
So everyone has their own limits.
---
However I think we can all agree that ebony moris, swf with toolboxes or keys, god loops like ironworks or abbatoir are all extremely fucking annoying and are the kind of things that do need some kind of nerfs.
---
Definitely not
---
You'd rather be pulled from the game and just lay there than actually play and have a chance to get away?
---
More of this content pleasssse!
---
and what if i'm a mad man ?
---
How? This is basically dark devotion with more steps and nothing is stopping you from breaking totems before they light up
---
 He said that you shit yourself that you smell like shit and then he told you to hang yourself
---
I honestly thought he was talking about Colgate toothpaste in that last line...
---
Can we sneak in a Mori rework as well? &gt;.&gt;
---
Oh I had no idea it was changed
---
Bruh, I played one match this reset (rank 9), got matched against a rank 2, 3, 8, and 13 that were obviously swf, it wasn't a TAHXIC match, but I got absolutely stomped.
---
No it’s not. With Pig there is ALWAYS the guarantee of one Jigsaw box working to get the trap off whilst there’s no guarantee of a Medkit spawning in a chest.
---
This wouldn't make sense, it's gone because she's in another plain of existence.
---
Even if they were, he already know where you are before he starts chainsawing, so I dont know what the point would be lol
---
How often do you DC? You only get anything resembling a "ban" if you DC all the time. The initial timer is literally 60 seconds. That's halfway done by the time you click through the menus.
---
lol
---
This isn't really an argument here.  People have the right to free speech, but they still have to bear the brunt of peoples' reactions to their free speech.
---
Besides which, you're playing a game on a server for which there certainly ARE rules.  It's not *your* server.  There are penalties for bailing out and others are entitled to their opinion that someone who DCs because a game isn't going their way is being a knob.  If someone loses every game of DBD they play-- their own fault or otherwise-- then they're going to have a lousy opinion of it.  If they DC every one of those games, are you on their side because they're entitled to that retribution for not 'having fun'?
---
&gt;[dbd might honestly be about as bug free as csgo](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ebydt9/disconnect_penalty_is_now_enabled_for_a_test_on/fb8gqcd/)
---
Yes a game that regularly adds game-breaking bugs with each chapter is as bug free as csgo. The same game that frequently reset peoples progress for months and months and months.
---
should have hooked the first guy. I've been found within the first minute and taken it without whining about it to the killer. and I've done the same in my killer matches.
---
 if you are the first person to get downed DO NOT DC. EVER. it basically is a three man plus an extra gen and its really hard on the other survivors who now have to play this match with a fucking handicap.
---
Can we get some footage of it?
---
What is the improper use?
---
There's also this. If a survivor disconnects in the first minute then why am I expected to stay in the game at that point? I want to have fun too, I want to have a sporting game. Why am I now expected to stay and play a tilted game or be forced with a time out penalty? especially when you only get 600bp for the disconnect. I'm punished and forced to stay in an unfair game because somebody else rage quit.
---
So then the ban is literally pointless. Like I said, people will just suicide on hook. This literally only does harm to the game
---
Does it still count as a repost if I thought of this meme independently and didn't see it on here before, then went through the effort of making it myself? T.T
---
&gt; it was a plague
---
my experience trying to have fun with Autodidact
---
ps are you on ps4, pc or xbox
---
Maybe like with small game if there are X totems on the map / for every totem destroyed you get 1/2/3% faster repair/action speed. Just thought of this reading your comment.
---
I only started playing Legion because Samination made me feel very bad for Frank. And I'm yellow rank, so I think I'm lifting up his confidence quite a bit...
---
I don’t know. Do *you* think you did anything wrong?
---
I’m not the best at this game on either side; my killer rank is around 7-10. I know that I haven’t thought “it’s only the first two minutes, I won’t hook” in a long time.
---
I think it’s fine to take it easy on a team, though. If they have 5 gens left and you’ve got two on the hook and a third down, it’s totally fine and perhaps brotherly to hook that third and then dick off to a corner while they heal and unhook. That gets them more points for the game, it gets you more points because it lasts longer, everyone wins.
---
I also make a point to not sacrifice (hook, but not sacrifice) survivors if they drop a party streamer, since nothing discourages someone from putting up streamers more than doing so and only getting 9k points.
---
I digress. Ultimately, over enough games you’re gonna start matching with people who are roughly your equal, and the mindset of “it’s only two mins in, I won’t hook” will just get you genrushed and stomped on. That doesn’t make me feel great, so I try to sweat just as much as the other team. The meta of this game, particularly right now, is heavily dependent on snowballing early on. Attrition is only really effective in low/low-mid ranks.
---
I'm super curious as to why people hack achievements in games like DBD (or other games). Not only is it super easy to see if they're cheated because steam posts the exact time and date you got those achievements, but you can actually get game bans for using achievement spoofers.
---
Hide the names mah dude
---
Found the blendette!
---
Pop could work. A tracking perk might be better, though, if you find you’re having trouble finding survivors to get Dying Light/Thana rolling.
---
This happened to me for the first time .... it was demoralizing
---
except those games are balanced?
---
oh my god the dude said killers dont get anything other than 4ks in months
---
Can’t wait for this on console. I had a billy DC earlier because he couldn’t hit me for literally less than a minute. If he’d have kept going he would have got me because I’m not even that good at chases.
---
Looks yellow to me man , you sure you aren't colour blind yourself ?
---
Yeah that would be cool. As of right now Small Game is really this might help or be totally useless kind of perk. Survivors could also just do the totems especially if like 2 gens pop 45 seconds into the match, but again the killer might not even have noed and you just wasted time either doing them or looking for them and not finding any.
---
no0b3
---
you are funny
---
This would be a great way to differentiate.
---
You only get anything resembling a "ban" if you DC *all the time*. The initial timer is literally 60 seconds. That's halfway done by the time you click through the menus. 
---
Plus, this is *literally what they are testing*. The entire point of this post is to announce that they are testing and evaluating *the exact concern you have*.
---
Ah yes, she'll fit in very well here.
---
I like the thought you have put into this.
---
The killer ability is pretty much a free hit and depending on the duration it could be a free downing. There is very little counterplay.
---
Furious Retort is absolutely broken it shouldn't last much more than 10 seconds or it is free hit or downing.
---
I like Heightened Senses and Shrouded Hunt a lot.
---
All survivor perks are very situational and quite weak. Creative Burst is Sprint Burst you need a condition for which makes it just bad.
---
I have to say I find that there's something wrong with killers that work with instinct alone. There should always be intent and evil in them so it feels more scary. That's why Demogorgon isn't scary to me.
---
When a person is in dream world what is the advantage for freddy while they are in the dream world than when they are not
---
Half a day well spent.
---
the only really gamebraking was the hitbox one, and they even fixed that, meanwhile in dbd you can stun the killer start to run away and still get hit somehow.

Thank you for the chance! Good luck! Happy Holidays!
---
Toxic killers are forsure the worst in the game, the do control the whole game pretty much
---
Pretty sure the answer is yes to both.
---
I love being slugged, means I can go troll Twitch chat while still earning rift fragments.
---
He gets all the oats he wants &lt;3
---
He was glitched.  He didn't get uncloaked like normal when he got stunned.  Since he stayed invisible, the survivors were able to continuously stun him.  Read the post more carefully before you jump to conclusions.
---
use it to injure survivors, don't use when they are already injured. if u see more than one surv then use it regardless if they are injured or not.
---
I changed my Steam username to "iNeedKillerBlind" and after two games a killer finally let me get the flashlight rescue.
---
I run Franklin’s on Freddy and it works for me.
---
or 2 gens got done before the first hook so the killer bails.
---
Any tips for perks on this type of build? With distressing, dark devotion, ruin. What would the last one be?
---
I know it's not a good perk build, but more for fun. Perhaps an obsession perk that pairs well with devotion?
---
For today
---
When should I M1 attack ? After everyone is  ijured?
---
With the latest buff, two survivors with Kindred equipped won’t be able to tell if the other’s is active or theirs is; I just wanted to know if there was a way to tell whose is.
---
I only &gt;1k miles in TX.
---
I don’t agree with OP but survivors don’t have a skill checks for dropping a pallet or unhooking just killers don’t for breaking a pallet or hooking.
---
The only thing killers could have a skill check for is probably kicking a gen which I don’t think is a bad idea actually because if they hit it maybe they get bonus regression.
---
They're given the oblivious debuff making them unable to see non-hook auras.
---
You’re alright... my comment is used everywhere when something is posted more than once
---
Huh, weird.  I hit a survivor holding a flashlight, but they were still holding it when they got to the next pallet.  Maybe they just picked it up when I wasn't looking.
---
Most nightmare's add-ons affect people specifically in Dream World making them work slower and such.
---
Also dream snares and dream pallets only work on people in Dream World.
---
Start the captivating discussions you want to see, bro.
---
you didn't play killer a lot huh, a good survivor team don't let a killer play on his term, and if the survivor let the killer be toxic, then they deserve to die because they are not a good survivor team no?
---
Oh another post complaining about totems how original.
---
Well I found Waldo
---
&gt;  only to immediately down him again  
---
That's not a safe unhook? Sorry I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I run into survivors in post chat who accuse me of being a tunneler or camper or whatever occasionally and wonder what planet they are on (I main killers that only win by juggling, and find camping/tunneling super boring, sooooo...), and your post sounds a lot like that. "The killer was a camper but not really and I did safe unhooks but they immediately were downed but we couldn't do gens because the camper was patrolling and so fuck that I DCed".
---
It depends, if you cleanse on pools that are far away from the action they won't hurt.
---
But if you fill up all pools the plague will get her power without any delay and probably in a chase.
---
I wouldn't call that better, no.
---
I think that cloaked Wraith gets slowed down whenever a flashlight is on him, though I could be wrong.
---
That or the other three players breaking your NOED or just leaving. NOED is a band-aid that is ultimately damaging to you as a killer, as it will reward you for focusing on a survivor who’s well-positioned to waste your time...until you get to high ranks.
---
Darling I suck in the game, weather ruin is active, lullaby of the huntress or mori or even none of them - the killers need some perks and skill to their advance as well to do their task. Deal with it or get better. I believe in you
---
Using it whenever you see anyone and hitting them with it is good because when you hit someone with it you get killer instinct procs within your terror radius telling you where other people who don't have the deep wounds effect applied to them are. You can't down anyone with your melee when using the ability but it gives you information and wastes the survivors time. Perk wise Monitor &amp; Abuse, BBQ and surge are good on legion. Surge because you don't have to kick the generator when downing someone and Monitor and abuse because it makes your terror radius when not in chase 24 meters, which lets you get closer to survivors before they run away. It also makes it so your feral frenzy has a 40 meter detection range because whenever you hit someone with the ability the range is based on your terror radius. BBQ to just know where to go after hooking someone. If you have it, Thanataphobia is good on legion because you're pretty much supposed to keep everyone injured as long as possible.
---
There’s a *HUGE* different between a killer being toxic and getting a 4K.
---
Just like Rancour and PWYF, if you're going to run an obsession perk like that you should run Nemesis. You're gonna get so much more value out of it if you're able to make the person you're chasing the obsession as opposed to having to keep finding him.
---
I'd get that tattooed into me. Looks great!
---
I like to think DbD Lore wise Ash is the most difficult Survivor for killers to deal with
---
for mori i agree, but ruin? if you can't play around it then you probably are a poor rank 15, even I, killer main, hit between 50 and 80% of great skill checks on ruin so it's not even an inconvenience
---
well no shit but they never said anything about the system hitting right away
---
I could have not played the game today but I did
---
What a bunch of goddamn neanderthalic cunts. The dude in the pictures name is EAT DAT PUSSY 445 ON YOUTUBE
---
I don't think said it wouldn't either.
---
Then hit Great Skill Checks.
---
dont thank them yet now ppl are just killing themselves on hook while giving up
---
On xbox ripsiedoodledandy
---
Ah yes, I yearn for the days when everyone sat in front of a slightly larger screen waiting for some corporation to play videos until it was time to go to work or to bed.
---
Thank you for the tips :D , I have just unlocked thanatophobia so I will be using that along with monitor and abuse and barbique and chiliie .
---
If you m1 while they're healthy or not healthy you lose a chunk of your ability. Mainly you should do it when they're injured but if you do it when healthy that's also fine just not as much of a good idea.
---
Would've been better without the censor tbh
---
You say you do all those things but cant get pass rank 15?, you got to be lying  i only have to do 2 saves and do 2 gens and bit of chase and thats a pip
---
there have been way more game breaking bugs in cs and most if not all stayed in the game for years and only got fixed after seeing pro play
---
&gt; So then the ban is literally pointless 
---
Huh? How does that make it pointless? DC once and it's ok, DC a few times in an afternoon and you'll be removed from the player pool for a bit when you DC. That seems reasonable?
---
&gt;  Like I said, people will just suicide on hook. 
---
That's an improvement. Killer has to waste more time, which is better for survivors, and killer gets emblem points, which is good for killer, right?
---
&gt;This literally only does harm to the game 
---
I just described two benefits.
---
Good luck with that, it works pretty well!
---
So people at exclusively to DC?
---
that would make it an overly complicated mechanisme.
---
And we could argue that killer already get punished by a decreased in an emblem for that
---
Well it’s better to make sure things are running smoothly and I’d rather that then force it out early only for people to complain about it not working right. Damned if you do and damned if you don’t.
---
When the killer lures you win with farming and killers you anyway
---
You son of a bitch.
---
Yup. I went through they're post history. It's a romp.
---
This made my day. The mori at the end too lol! Perfection
---
Thanks.
---
Missed that part! Thanks, my friend! 🤗
---
that add-on combo does nothing btw
---
I said they’re the worst in the game. Not much on a complaint really just an opinion that seemed to hurt you. You’re probably that killer that slugs and stands over the slugged body. I don’t feel like I need to run the perks that counter toxicity 24/7 when 1) that’s not fun all the time 2) not every killer plays like a dick. I’m saying when it does happen, not frequently at rank 1 but it does happen, it’s a worse experience than when 1 survivor is being toxic out or 4. And I’m sure a lot of people agree.
---
I had a rank 6-8 friend who thought the same thing
---
I read apologies in spy's voice
---
still better than DC, at least the killer got the points and the bbq stack
---
Yeah, great. Just another feature that hits solo queue the hardest. Honestly think I might become a killer main after this. Solo survivor was already hell but now I have to put up with stuff like 3 gen situations where the killer doesn't chase anyone and the game goes for an hour, shitty teammates that hide in the corner and don't touch gens the entire 5 minute chase I gave the killer, green ping killers that go straight to red ping once the game starts, teammates teaming with the killer to get everyone else killed by sandbagging and hook spamming, or toxic bs like hard tunnelers or killers that think it's hilarious to mori spam or BM all game. I guess I can still suicide on hook though, so at least I have that.
---
For sure! I just got all survivor teachables unlocked.... maybe I'll do all killers next and prestige survivors later. I mainly only use Ghostface or Myers, and I have them both at 30 right now! Thanks for the advise!
---
that is the last thing that matters the first part is not having the rest of the team fucked over
---
If you ever want to just practice chasing survivors, lemme know, I love helping out.
---
As for why you shouldn't camp: for the most part, it's bad, unless you play against newer players or overly altruistic survivors, in which case camping works since they'll stop doing gens and stay close to the hooks.
---
The reason it's bad, is while you're busy protecting a hooked survivor, you give free reign to 3 others, a survivor will die from first hook in 120 seconds, one survivor does a gen in 80, and two in 45. If you take into account the time it takes to find a survivor, Chase, down, hook, and make sure they die, good survivors should be able to get all gens. On top of that you won't get many hooks, sacrifices, chased, or hits. So you won't get many blood points. Gens will get done fast on top of that, so you're not likely to rank up. So wether you care about kills, no, or ranking. Camping isn't the right solution, against the right kind of survivors. 
---
But of course, not every survivor or scenario is the right one. 
---
Also, you have to down someone to camp them. So you seem to be able to win some chased. Practice will make you better at finding and downing faster.
---
He may be an idiot, but he's still a horror hero legend
---
Adiriis
---
That feeling when you ranted about this yesterday...
---
AND YOUR PRAYERS GET ANSWERED!
---
I'm aware and understand fully, just i see that being brought up and people harassing them about it
---
Haha it's true
---
It looks nice, but why the artistic touch of the braid?
---
I'm a killer main and I disagree so
---
They don't punish lag-outs, thankfully.
---
I mean, it's not because people already bought him, but it's because he is made to stay in the game lmao
---
bc the question has a obvious answer the poor connection is hurting 4 other players
---
no merch? make merch! seriously this is really cool!
---
Crashes, errors, lag-outs, etc. aren't punished mate.
---
How do I unlock Freddy
---
yeah bbq would be my choice
---
Damn, and I'm over bitching about my 5-10min survivor queues.
---
Do I need to define what mostly means?
---
no claudette is literally invisible
---
Raceism 😡
---
Insert terminator teleporting noises
---
Moolah
---
Yes they are. Have you not seen the posts all over here and the official forums? if you leave the game for any reason - crashes and server kicks included, you get timed-out.
---
Seventh DC is 24 hours. I did god's work, although I basically fucked my friend's steam and *kinda* hacked past the 6th barrier for science.
---
Maurice helps the entity, and the entity gives it anything he wants
---
People saying that they’d rather it works properly and they sort it out before releasing it for console, you do realise PC have had dedicated servers for a while now and continue to have them, even whilst the testing is going on and many issues are apparent?
---
Plus you know for a fact that they’ll iron out the issues with the servers on PC and as soon as (if) they release them on console they’ll just be broken again.
---
the thing is that, yeah i'm a main killer, but for the archive i play a lot of survivor game (and i mean a LOT fu*king medkit) and a lot of the time what i see in lobby is survivor trashing the killer for what I think was a good play, a good bait.
---
I mean, i didn't even remember getting a toxic killer and i am nearly the end of the tome 3 of the archive for survivor (and again, i'm not really a good survivor so i need to do a lot of game)
---
so all this thing of toxic killer make me remember that in the last mounth i didn't meet a toxic killer once, but survivor trashing a poor and unsuspecting killer ouah that's a lot (but you could argue that there is 4 survivor for 1 killer so the odds are bigger)
---
I’m on switch and I see chargers but I don’t see Freddy
---
Dwight mains be like
---
I am curious if 24 is the max and you just keep getting 24's or if there's a week ban.
---
If the rank system depends on each side to do their part in a match implement a ban system will do great for the game
---
Yeah, the spirit is my favorite killer in the game because of how much emotion she conveys and it makes me feel so bad for her
---
Ooooooh, I think he was left out of switch so far, he might be added later like Leatherface is.
---
Just run in circles around the pallet it ain't that hard, then you'll eventually learn to loop around structures and take optimal pathing. Hiding is good tho, you don't want to be caught by the killer, unlike those people who bring flashlights so they can click, have your attention so the other 3 potatoes who can't even walk in a straight line can press M1 on a gen for 80 seconds
---
The hair line stuck up and it looked like she had a monk cut, the braid made it look a little more like a natural hairline. The hair was the toughest part. I overestimated the size of the base body.
---
A plain Bill slow vaulting. It's the single cutest thing in the world.
---
Until the third DC there is no real penalty, 5min isn't much. They said if you don't DC for a while, it will be reset. 
---
DCs in game can doom the game for survivors and decreasing the fun for killers. Some people use them like a legit strategy. 
---
There is literally no harm done in adding a penalty for DCs. It only enhances the experience for killers and especially survivors.
---
I guess armchair psychology is easier than not being a dick to other people playing the game...
---
If someone could take a look in the game files, there might be some variable that determines the lockout time. My personal theory is that the ban after that, since it ramps so much, is 72 hrs. then a max week.
---
I’m not saying there’s not toxic survivors, I’m saying having a toxic killer is worse. Lucky for you that you didn’t run into it, but I was playing with a low rank friend (his first week of playing) and a killer slugged him and let him bleed out whilst picking him up and letting him wiggle out. He hasn’t played since. But a survivor teabagging him didn’t make him bat an eye playing as killer. There’s a giant difference. The killer can make the game literally unplayable. Cmon man
---
Or a Hunter or Smoker
---
When I want to derank as killer I do cheesy stuff so I can farm XP at the same time like basement security Leatherface, Zap-Happy Doctor who zaps one survivor in particular the entire match without ever hitting them, etc.
---
So I was farming earlier because I thought the monstrous mayhem archive required you to hook 2 people in the basement and I didn't want to win after tunnelling and camping, I grabbed Meg off the last gen for points and took her to the hill and when she wiggled off she glitches into the ground, has anyone else experienced this?
---
Then the system must be really stuck in its infancy, because peanits and the sort confirmed that shit wouldn't be punished. Then again, peanits.
---
Thanks so much!!
---
Watching top survivors on stream I can certainly confirm that unless you're a top tier killer (you probably aren't), do NOT tunnel the top player, unless you want a really embarrassing game without a single hook, with hundreds/thousands of people laughing at you.  The only way you are getting a top survivor is if you take everyone else out first.
---
Since it's not really possible to know going in, I think good advice is just to chase someone and if they are giving you too much trouble and you are getting a bad feeling about them, swap targets.  It seems pretty obvious to me, but I am discovering that some people are stubborn or have a big ego.
---
According to survivors "tEaBaGgInG iSn'T tOxIc, GrOw A sPiNe BaBy KiLlEr LoL"
---
It's ok, you can report them, im sure bhvr will toootally do something about it...lmfao
---
Only console that gets it now is Switch.
---
My internet dies at least once every hour and a half so hope it doesn't screw me over eventually.  
---
Sucks if people start dying on 1st hook though. At least a dc gave survivors some pity points.
---
I know , I didnt know how long reddit videos could be, click the link below to see the video
---
" Why is it that most game I go into are campers " -&gt; probably bias, you remember more the bad game than the good one, i can arue that i didn't met a camping killer in the last mounth while farming the archive so it's not easy to understand if you did get camped a lot of not
---
"  and I have teammates who just work on generators and 75% of the time  I’m only unhooked when playing with friends or getting farmed by randoms " -&gt; survivor is globally easyer than killer (not that it's a bad thing don't misunderstand, the mechanic is easyer, doing skillchecks while someone is 200m away being chase is not complicated and there is a lot of crutch perk to locate the killer and avoid being surprised) so (and you can see that at high rank especially) killer have GENERALY a better understanding of the game and the situation, or you could say that survivor take GLOBALY more play time to get good (you don't get exp if you don't get chase, and you can win a lot of game without even seeing the killer i know i'm a bad survivor but i win a lot without seeing the killer :p )
---
that is my opinion on the thing
---
Maybe it would shapeshift to a random survivor but still has a terror radius and cant be undetectable,  so perks like Dark Devotion would lead to an interesting playstyle and having a knowledge of your team, plus giving the Separation Offering more use.
---
The 3-gen is very strong, and competent survivors will work very hard to make sure the last 3 gens are kept very far apart.
---
Ignoring gens isn't wise, but that's not the same as accepting the loss of certain gens - remember that you're meant to be pressuring the survivors, not running a defensive line until they screw up.
---
Covering *every* killer's individual way of using Discordance is a bit much, but what I can tell you is that Plague uses it to create an environment where you can hit multiple people at once, to bring to your attention any time survivors are working together, and ultimately to discourage survivors from doubling up on gens. So yes, if you see Discordance light up then you're going to want to spray something in that gen's direction  - even if the survivors have ran off, you can puke on it and maybe even kick it if there's time.
---
No problem
---
While I see this and thats fine it doesnt really correlate to the problem im describing.
---
" Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible." This is very loose and doesnt really mean anything if it doesnt actually succeed at getting a rank thats close. 
---
" If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. " This is quite a common setup in other matchmade games, however it usually is a result of long queues. It doesnt make sense for me to have almost instantaneous queues at rank 10 and get poorly matched games while at rank 16 I had long queues as a killer and had much more even matchmaking games (In terms of current rank)
---
So if this was a recent update it seems to be doing quite horribly at what its trying to do.
---
Killer: *hits gen*
---
Survivors: You son of a bitch. I’m in
---
I wouldnt be opposed for an option to bleed out faster in the slugged state, because at least then killers could expect it and know about it.  I could still plan around however long their fast bleed out is.
---
Thanks, yeah exactly, I just wish there was a way to play in a casual sense without almost automatically reaching a rank where it becomes sweaty instead of for fun.
---
Thats pretty extreme, yeah there seems to be severe issue with matchmaking.
---
It's because the new rank reset
---
&gt;When you are one of the most iconic horror movie protagonists but a bunch of morons from moose country give you three worthless abilities that make you a complete joke among the community
---
I think this has been a suggestion for a long time, even when I started playing DBD back in the day, at least people were suggesting a casual queue, I guess the game doesnt have the player base to be able to sustain two different queues but currently theres no way to not get to a point where you have to start sweating to not get dumpstered, just playing casually gets you to a point where you either get dumpstered or you gotta start sweating, it feels like theres no win.
---
Looks pretty damn cool!
---
Very cool! Well done OP :)
---
AMAZEBALLS!!!!!!!
---
survivor can also (and more frequently) make the game unplayable, i just had a game where the 2 last survivor hid who know where because they 3gened themselves
---
what do you think is worse? being sluged for 2 minutes? of searching for 15 FUCKING minutes for the 2 asshat that 3gened themselves but didn't want to leave? as killer you can't do anything against that, if the survivor is hidding in a random locker great what do i do?
---
I leveled Claudette first. Self care was helpful, but I find that most of her perks become less essential the more experienced you become. Looking back, I’d have gone straight for meg. I think all of her perks are useful. Adrenaline can be a life saver end game, quick and quiet is good for evading/hiding (and good for head on builds), spring burst is worth having for sure
---
Hey I did that yesterday
---
wait... thats illegal
---
Not really. Genuine server disconnects happen very rarely whereas turning the router off and on would be an easy exploit for cunts who DC
---
I've never played him but doesnt he just jump over pallets ?
---
all the more reason to play ds or bt!
---
and i must say that for a killer tunneling is far from efficient so if the survivor can't handle it, whoa that's a bad team of survivor
---
Really shows most peoples motivations for the ban lol. So they can run iri heads, instasaw, most OP add ons and an ebony and get the ez win. We see right through you.
---
i still prefer DH for that distance to a pallet/window. Its effectively a sprint burst on demand for what i need it for and i dont have to walk everywhere
---
Ash is barley husky. Jeff is the hefty boi
---
Your friend is lucky! I'm jealous :(
---
Sorry chief you need more than one game to prove a point for all we know the red ranks were just fucking around being that they hardly got any points.
---
Dedicated servers on PC are complete garbage.  Be thankful you do not have the 20+ min queues with lag still.
---
just laughed hard at it. keep it up 🤣
---
All I'm saying is if you're getting tunneled and camped, you're fucked. No way around it. Teammates can try to help but it will waste time and that's less people doing objective. You can be mad about it, but the right thing to do to combat a camper is ignore him and do objective. Explain one scenario where you can safely unhook a camped survivor. I'll wait.
---
Assuming no bugs like others have mentioned, yes it has :)
---
In the situation I was in I downed one survivor in the general area of the hatch, immediately spotted the other survivor and went to go chase them down.  After I downed them after a short chase, they immediately d/ced.  I was planning on downing them, then making a beeline to the survivor I left, but I guess I should have accounted for the ragequit?
---
Oh no, you have to play the game instead of quitting!
---
However will the game survive if only people that finish games remain. We’ll all be so sad when the people who leave halfway through a game are gone. However will we handle the lack of petty twats?
---
And decides to make your perks the most useless ones in the entire game, followed by Tapp, Ace, Quentin and Huntress
---
I do need blood points
---
I mean, right. They should nerf the slug timer, for real, or if you spam a button you bleed out faster. And while they’re at it, maybe address some of the reasons people dc.
---
Also lets the killer get theor bbq stack etc instead of being denied perks.
---
“Look who’s capitalising in the tall grass.”
---
Only during feral frenzy, and he cant down people during frenzy so its useless during a chase
---
DBD: Has a bug because of the servers that can allow you to keep a Wraith stuck in  lightburn
---
The devs: guess we have to have a DC penalty
---
Even without dedicated servers it's still 20 min queue with lag
---
Yea pro strat is bait the pallet hop over and stabby stabby
---
She's also half tall hot mommy material
---
I’m glad you decided to jump on your alt.
---
Cause he dropped his BOOM-Stick.
---
this is why we cant have open game chat
---
nobody wins but the person who plays both sides
---
I want clown to use my face as a toilet
---
It was on the shrine about a month and a half ago so it’s prob gonna be a while
---
The key and rainbow map is also unfair it balances out both sides have unfair stuff doesn’t mean no one should use it
---
"Camping and NOED are fine" - Survivors come in to complain
---
"Bodyblocking and saboing hooks are fine" - Killer mains come in to complain
---
when you get camped and you take it out on your pillow
---
DD doesn't worth with distressing, DD sets terror radius to 32 flat on the survivor. Better to run unnerving presence if you want to do some shit like that
---
They are having issues with his license currently as I believe his IP was given back to the original person. The contract they made didn’t originally include switch so they are waiting for him to agree to it for legal reasons
