You should maybe think about your suggestions from both sides before anything dude, this is so survivor favoured it hurts.
---
---
---
Fuck no D:
---
I mean it's working okay now and not taking me too long to get into a Survivor game. I just had to restart the game but good to know I'm not the only one that this is happening too.
---
Who's that doing chin ups on the bar, Dwight?
---
I love this style! Part of it looks realistic and some of it looks like a drawing. The contrast makes the piece blend together really well.
---
Starting to become the Hanna Barbera theatre scene
---
What about when you find one in a chest?
---
Wish I had that kind of luck when  I escape -_-
---
Go frame by frame. The last gen popped then like 2 frames later the cleanse action finished.
---
Just invert the colors to lose all vision. Colorblind wont matter then 5head.
---
I'd have to think about it 1 million pounds
---
I'd have to think about it until I arrive at no lol
---
Survivor dailies are bugged right now. If you get one, it seems there's a good chance it'll be rerolled at the end of your match. Seems this doesn't happen for killer dailies.
---
Fair enough
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
That's why I try to play with friends haha
---
Did they kill you?
---
Probably his special brother Dwert.
---
Damn. I‚Äôm not even mad.
---
Apparently the mods don't like Tru either given how they leave these threads up despite clearly breaking rule 3. Meanwhile, I mention the username of an actual toxic DBD streamer in passing and the entire comment chain gets deleted.
---
I guess that the Blendettes that op talks about are not doing gens, I get matched with a couple of those everyday tbh.
---

---
Of course if they're just playing stealthy while doing gens then I have 0 problems but most of these specimens just hide on a corner waiting for the rest to die to get hatch
---
If its the first type of player, then yeah, its a dickish thing to do.
---
If its the latter on the other hand, fuck those guys a 1000 times
---
Even like scooby doo themed skins please... I would spend all the auric cells for them. I would main a shaggy Dwight and be proud of it
---
It‚Äôs a pretty kickass ride though- when did you take this photo, though?
---
I'd say yes because my country does not have free or low cost healthcare.
---
If people really hate it that much, why not just take small game or a rainbow map and look for the totem.
---
If they dont dc then you are doing something wrong. ggs
---
It's obviously a survivor perk...
---
Fine, then he picks up the chainsaw next to Bubba‚Äôs corpse and uses it to shred Myers in half.
---
That‚Äôs a little different.. there need to be some kind of penalties for or blood point gain for killers  when survivors refuse to try. Ive had games where I killed 2 and the other two crouch around the map hiding not doing anything for 10 min and yes it‚Äôs a huge waste of time
---
Mori is execution by eraser.
---
That is the point.
---
needs more JPEG
---
Lol
---
Love Jaws being on there. Get ‚Äòem girl.
---
Is that a danny devito trapper? Lmao
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt play nurse so I was learning and yeah console.
---
Ah but beginners luck,
---
1.3 seconds and they somehow unhooked by themselves.
---
I'm a survivor main but I notice it with every killer. Half the time the killer isn't even that great because we'll be able to 3 man 5 gens
---
Bruh im working the most I can I feel like
---
Hey just something I do that you may be into. I screenshot messages like this on my ps4. And if I want to post them then I send them to a random friend and then download them from the PS messages app.
---
Might as well chuck Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit in at this point.
---
**Chase Scene:** the Hoax may enter a locker and, after a short channel, exit a different one. Survivors are *also* able to travel between whichever two lockers the Hoax last accessed.
---
Wat bout jeepers creepers?
---
If I don't get actually injured or hurt id happily let Myers chase meü§ëü§ë
---
My mom watches me play. 
---
Every night she‚Äôs like ‚Äúare you gonna play Dead by Daylight? Can I watch??‚Äù
---
She loves it lol. Will *not* play though.
---
Oh this is easy mode, just go against legion and its an easy million
---
I just finished watching that I can‚Äôt wait for season 3
---
[removed]
---
I could easily see a bug where you step out of the locker and find yourself in an entirely different map
---
Ironwill is useless if spirit use stridor
---
bruh
---
Let's just settle this in the game. I bet you camp and tunnel the first survivor you find
---
Hmm idk I'm guessing people don't want to lose their stuff so they're closing application on first hook
---
As someone who used to use Predator religiously, I'd honestly like to see it affect the environment, something like making foliage smaller/shorter along with possibly reducing the density of foliage patches (like corn or yamaoka reeds). Anything other than scratch marks being packed together would be nice.
---
Dunno why yall are getting so triggered over my comment, I‚Äôm just saying lore wise the blight can happen any time.
---
And I‚Äôll have you know for the record i exclusively play trapper with non injuring traps
---
Yeah I have that too
---
This is sick!
---
yup we know it is a known glitch
---
I am able to get into survivor games quickly on PC. Killer is the 10+ minutes.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I have a better chance at beating a bunch of teens rather than a chainsawing cannibal
---
I can't see how it is fun. The chase in dbd is pretty much the most enjoyable part.
---
Its literally making a game go by in 5 minutes, roughly the same time for lobbies.
---
The funnest bug ever, /s it literally only changes it if you finish the ritual, if you only half completed it it stays
---
Imagine getting chased down by a fucking massive rabid dogüòÇ
---
I swear every time I think of something good to comment somebody is always here before me going ‚Äúhee hee, I‚Äôm going to post this before you‚Äù
---
Can this sub stop circlejerking this dude already?
---
I legit wanna play against that now. But everyone was excited for the horror game to have an event for the holiday about horror so you can't blame them for getting their hopes up. Withering blight was very likely meant to be that event lore be damned
---
I'd like it if I got a response? I've rarely ever slugged, and I want to know if this is simply viable.
---
I don't really care about bloodpoints if I play as a slug build- it's simply fun.
---
These tier lists need to be banned
---
Give us Frankensteins monster or a xenomorph
---
And what is the point about bitching about him in every thread. You've gave him all the recognition he wants, he's infamous.
---
Viable for what exactly? If you want a 4k sure, its easy as hell. But if you want to rank up and get better at killer? Hell no.
---
‚ÄúA delayed game is eventually good
---
A rushed game is forever bad‚Äù
---
I‚Äôd rather the event be delayed for a couple weeks or whatever than pushed out on time in an unplayable state because it would just tarnish the game‚Äôs reputation.
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Its the toddler version of dbd :D whats that game called Identity V
---
Damn
---
Don't worry Jason will for sure be there once the game shuts down, Pennywise not too sure about that though.
---
Then they call you a "Sweaty try hard"
---
Permanently close?????? Keys
---
Pig is always fun, love the pressure of trying to get the traps off
---
What a nice clown. ü§° üëç
---
Watch Clifford be the next killer
---
April Fools in October? Shame on you, Steam!!
---
Not to be confused with the new survivor, the nurse.
---
Depends, if you think they're spreading info definitely get rid of them, if they're just some solo person chasing you around I'd just let them follow you they're only hurting themselves at that point. Some people only do it hoping you chase them.
---
ü§°üëç
---
Happy Halloween *hugs*
---
Literally nobody has ever complained about seeing small game in post game lobby.
---
Oh dear christ
---
Hes just walking around giving thumbs ups
---
I brought in my only survivor pudding while leveling up wraith but everyone dced and I got 18k bps, but hey, an extra 1850 Bps for the equivalent of 4 sacrifices :)
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHA have you seen the forums?
---
Must be something wrong with your PC.
---
Different people find different things fun.
---
Idk, it only happens when I play killer. And it's pretty rare.
---
Just minding your own business searching the basement chest then get downed trying to run upstairs from a myers with head on lol
---
Fair enough lol
---
And I play tons of survivor so that just makes me think it's a killer bug.
---
It takes a purple/pink item to open the hatch once closed.  It's a niche argument.  Keys are complete bullshit but that's a different post entirely.
---
Yeah but the ideal would be that they had begun earlier in time to meet expectations. If there was a chance that things could've gone wrong than they should've had the foresight to not give an exact date and say that the event will release around Halloween instead or whenever. The point is they failed to meet expectations they themselves gave us
---
It worked!
---
Mettle of Man was the single strongest perk to ever be in Dead by Daylight. Those couple of months with that in the game are the only time I've ever felt the game was Pay to Win.
---
I love how he still can‚Äôt do a gen lmao
---
Dedicated servers destroyed pulling survs out of actions (gen pulling especially).  It's like a soft ban on reduced TR builds.
---
Cabbage head Pog
---
... Do I have to explain again that the importance of an in game event does not equate to an anniversary or birthday?
---
On top of this, if I couldn‚Äôt celebrate my anniversary or birthday, on the exact day of my anniversary or birthday, I wouldn‚Äôt bitch. I‚Äôd find time so that we can celebrate together properly.
---
If the whole of your relationship relies on two days a year, you‚Äôre gunna have a bad time. Sometimes you need to.... compromise. Never thought I‚Äôd see the day where someone would try to compare a video game to a relationship. Oh my lawwwwwwwwd.
---
Spongebob getting his liver eaten by the hag
---
If the artist was suicidal and had mental issues. This is a dude who is denying the death of over a million people, is a raging racist and is a straight up NAZI. Yeah, I‚Äôm going to say fuck the artist, sort of like I say fuck Hitler, even though he was a good artist. Fuck. Nazis.
---
I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre having a hard time with this.
---
Definitely one of the top 75 killers IMO
---
The forums are a shitshow even worse than here.
---
Anyone for Pumpkinhead?
---
among the shit and filth in this sub (tier lists, legion cosplays, fuck the dev posts, people bragging about normal plays and rants) we find gold like this  
---
yes i'm aware I've just mentioned like 90% of the subreddit
---
No, it just allows you to have a friend take control of another member of the Legion.
---
Yea and a Flipper survivor
---
All of those are good af! üëç
---
Dat Hag though!
---
Not really, Stridor amplifies grunts of pain by 50%. Iron will nullifies all grunts of pain but it includes 25% breathing but i have no idea what causes/cancels breaths
---
I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs been glitched all game? Cause you walked through like you expected it to not affect you
---
Am I doing something wrong?  I let bbq chili go off.  Maybe it‚Äôs my Elo but no one is doing gens.  They are all rushing hook.  :/
---
I would just judge by what you think of them in each situation. If you're someone like trapper or hag where they can watch you trap stuff I would say make more of a point to get rid of them, otherwise just judge by the situation is what I usually do
---
Empathy &gt; Bond

---
Thank youi. l Was looking for something like this.
---
He's Not Otzdarva\*
---
almost everytime. relatable, upvote.
---
What about bigger Jaws
---
Lol I remember playing with a Nea who VCed me prematch, but the totem was like 10 feet from a gen who I helped finish
---
Uuuu. The look see monster is the 1st crypt tv monster I was introduced to. It is so good
---
Yup, no news about a fix, just that they're aware of the issue. Kinda insane that they released it without, y'know, checking to see if it works ingame? Cause this seems like a pretty major issue lol.
---
I cba to argue anymore you're either deluded or trolling..
---
He's just boolin'.
---
I have no idea why you think u/DrongoJuice is wrong. Myers is one of the easier killers to loop and get away from. Put in some more playtime, you'll revise your opinion.
---
i love the plague doctor. i love it sooooo much. i really hope bhvr adds one!!!! or maybe a cosmetic
---
I don't mind the event is delayed - I just don't care for the system they implement. Everything the devs give us for free comes packaged in shitty grinding. They get their player numbers up.  Make it tough / impossible to earn all items for free (pay for them later) Free rift track is mostly event items (That should be completely separate) Cosmetic prices are shit. Hair is still $6 - The game is balanced around 1 perk right now. DBD is fun, but bhvr still has lots of work to do.  :)
---
I second this. Otz is great for learning killer perks and strategies in general, but that goes double for his Trapper plays
---
Now this is quality content
---
They have one for The Doctor but it's not enough I want more lol
---
Why are you reposting? Make your own memes.
---
YES
---
wait what. wait im looking it up one sec.
---
And clearly more resources are put into cosmetics. The game had been flawed and bugged but they just paper chase and really don‚Äôt even acknowledge the mess the game is.
---
"Doing gens, you?"
---
Im an xbox boi and haven‚Äôt touched anything but sensitivity
---
I love the loading screens in that series
---
Alot of the problem I'm seeing in the comments is people's idea of having fun is winning 100% of the time.
---
Esports and streaming have ruined gaming because the competitive attitude spawned toxicity, which is why every one tries so hard.
---
"I cant play the fun way because then people are toxic. So I try hard and shit on them. If they're toxic because they're salty over losing it feels better than if I'm the loser."
---
ok i looked it up and it looks amazing. gonna probably main him just for that
---
I'd say with each gen some just incase you arent catching anyone
---
Listen to the moans brings you right to them
---
He has like the beaky mask and old fashion but it's still different from how I'd imagine one I still bought it though xD
---
Yeah I was like ''Oh my god they listened to the fans!''
---
Can we just give Third Seal this effect
---
I rarely DC, but if I was an ass I would DC against every Ghostface. Revealing him is very broken right now. At least on XBOX. It's very frustrating to go against.
---
Found out the other day also was hyped to play as her and everyone disconnected
---
Two dc'd before I even found them
---
We all get frustrated and one day you‚Äôll learn how to play against it. I‚Äôm just poking fun at you for DC‚Äôing
---
darn skill checks, thanks for the upvote!
---
I'm guessing freddy because of the nails in the shadow but it can also be hag by the head. I'm gonna keep the guess on The Hag :D
---
~~(Please don't be another legion)~~
---
Shes fun but man I hate those dc's
---
It'd be wraith if it was the dead man's vertebrae
---
demogorgeous üòç
---
Bp event active doesnt make the addons give more.
---
Yea no point in caring about what others think. Cheesing or counterplay doesn't matter if it benefits you do it
---
See. I rarely see anyone bring up the true reason gaming is horrid nowadays. And its the competitive attitude.
---
Ranking, esports, and streaming have ruined games being fun.
---
Not really for nothing. Usually a few people will throw them in a game if you're lucky, and you'll get some good points. 
---
And yes, the same is for perk bonuses, it goes off the base score as well.
---
It‚Äôs not Legion (thank god since there‚Äôs nothing but legion costumes here)
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
i think he meant ppl who dc
---
^^^^is
---
[deleted]
---
I was like, 'how is he gonna help with a totem?'. Nvm
---
She tunneled a Meg off the hook as well that‚Äôs why she dc‚Äôd. Didn‚Äôt want to post a 5 minute video
---
The lullaby isn't affected by terror radius modifiers, because it isn't a terror radius as of the change with the introduction of the oblivious status effect.
---
And you said you "had me". Next time try arguing with a brick wall, and perhaps you'll actually win. Though that's debatable, you were defending insta-heals after all. I guess I should have seen this coming.
---
I too used to run SB/UE before I realized how utterly inefficient I was being.
---
I had this the other day with spirit. I'm a baby spirit, still learning her, and I got my hand unto the 2 op add-ons bead and red ring. So I thought of trying it out for the 1st time. 3 dcs and 1 escape through hatch, 5 gens. They all then decided to trashtalked at post game chat. :)
---
It's also annoying when the killer goes after survivors who have just been unhooked, which is unfun and guarantees losing a pip &gt;:(
---
In my opinion hex perks have to be overpowered to make up for the fact that they can be permanently destroyed
---
i would personally replace sloppy butcher. its not really the best perk and its kinda useless. i would suggest bitter murmur (idk if i spelt that right). its pretty helpful. unless if you wanna replace it with another better perk.
---
He stabbs by, appkying pointless status effects, looks around and realises that with his shitty movement speed he can't hit any other survivor so he decides to use his power to catch up to me, he cancels his power and gets stunned for 4 seconds, meanwhile I run across the whole map and find another braindead busted loop on Blood Lodge and loop the killer for 5 gens.
---
Pepsi man approves
---
I got prayer bead my 5th bloodweb level
---
I love watching gameplay at rank 21
---
... Is it possible to learn this power
---
Keep it. Combo it with a speed add on to make a full use of it. From a spirit main to another, she's fun as hell to play, keep at it :)
---
:)

---
In the upper right.  I could be wrong, but it looks like Toad to me.
---
I wish my survivors would ignore gens, at ranks below 10 I get gen rushed to hell
---
Begone Thot!
---
So this didn‚Äôt go extremely great but it was a lot fun
---
...that's the joke
---
Did you make these portraits?
---
Im expecting bugs, but im glad they held it back after I read the patch notes. Like the hag not being able to teleport? I dont want that in the game. Every update to every game will have bugs, at least theyre trying to be responsible and iron out the game breaking ones.
---
A Velma Claudette 
---
A daphne Kate
---
A Fred David
---
left behind to capitalize on this
---
Bruh, Hex: Agony seems like it would be amazing, broken status after being downed is crazy but not overpowered either, great concept!
---
I've been waiting for them to add Sam &amp; Dean for years.
---
...But then the Killer becomes the Killed.
---
Wanna DM me if i was close or lemme know if i guessed right? :P
---
Are you the Susie? Based off of the comments it seems like you are, just wanna know for sure.
---
Imagine losing your dead hard!
---
does the third seal do the same thing as knock out but better until they cleanse the totem?
---
I‚Äôll give you a hint: one, two, ___‚Äôs coming for you, three for better lock your door.
---
I think his bell should always be silent, either that or the sound of it should be global.
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that anyone who ripped out their own spinal cord is going to have trouble doing anything.
---
Edit: I'm questioning the wording now. I guess they mean the guy whipped the dead man with the dead man's spinal cord? This whole situation is fucking confusingZ
---
&gt;Mate you're arguing with yourself
---
Wait... So this is all in my head?! Who the hell are you?! What M. Night Shyamalan twist is this?!
---
/s
---
&gt;trying to convince thin air you won
---
I mean, you're the one who mentioned evidence yet never actually showed it and every statement was easily refuted. 
---
Just like before, I'm merely calling it for what it is.
---
Had a few people say GG. I had one call me a toxic rat for sacrificing them first, and one call me dumb for not saving them in time
---
Keep doing the good work! Hopefully someone at BHVR will listen. Games are for EVERYONE to enjoy. Xoxo
---
I'd give an award for this but i'm broke :(
---
That's some spicy Lore, I bet it was Trapper
---
Bro that doctor had a new add on.... connection disruption
---
*Self care rant*
---
*Incredibly stupid adjective to describe perk (Racist)*
---
*Incorrect tag used on post*
---
*5 day old account*
---
Is this a waste of space?
---
Decisive Strike, Head on, and... Lods of Emone?
---
Making it always silent would be nice, but then he‚Äôd need a new ultra rare to replace it and the bing bong would be gone forever. Making it global would be a better choice but then survivors might get annoyed every time they face him knowing all they‚Äôll be hearing is that bell constantly.
---
And the killer grabs you - "No stacks for lil brown ranked David boi." Donate a stack today so a David can afford the teachable and become a new person.
---
It looks like we're seating for a fancy dinner on top of the generator
---
Can I bring a key?
---
This might be the best post I‚Äôve seen on this sub in a while
---
I feel you. But its a curse. Knowing what your team is doing all game can become frustrating. I know i have died a few times trying to screw over the people urban evading in the corner by themselves.
---
No I just chose them so people get an idea of what ideas Id love to see in the game and edited the filter, colour and collage.
---
*So you have chosen death!*
---
This worked out just fine. 4k no issues
---
This is why I love this community

This is great! The nodding is so accurate.
---
Can someone explain what this whole thing about dedicated servers is about? I‚Äôve been playing nonstop since like last summer and I still don‚Äôt know what this is.
---
All he put in the title was "credit: samination." For all I know, he could mean the Archives.
---
They look great! All of these would make for some great killers.

Umm don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs horizontal

back in the day it wasnt like this :/

consider yourself lucky because it ended badly for me LOL

also sorry for bad audio i dont remember why that was so bad
---
Thanks and Ikr it really gets your imagination going xD
---
So what if my account is new? Your account was new too once. Would you have liked everyone to be a condescending asshole to you about it also? Grow up.
---
Literally today
---
How long you here for?
---
And Joe as a survivor
---
You‚Äôre right in that the standing still mindgame won‚Äôt work because she wouldn‚Äôt be able to mindgame at all with your suggestion
---
Beyond that, survivors should also be scouting perks throughout the match. If you notice Fire Up, Obsession perks, or can't scout more than 2 or 3 perks... mans got NOED.
---
Dont forget "dead before daylight" and other classics like "horrorfield" and that one where you play the slot mahines until they pop.
---
Click on the item you selected. It should bring up your item selection option, and then just click the item you selected again and it should unequip it.

Popular opinion. Git gud scrub.

Thanks dude!

Look up buckle up it‚Äôs and ash perk
---
Ok tell me how to keep 3 gens from popping when I downed 1 survivor as clown also asshole I‚Äôve been playing this game for 3 years
---
Have you tried not being trash
---
The problem is we haven't had any killers based from real legends yet which is how we would end up with Elizabeth bathory. We need killers that were real. Jack the ripper, vlad the impaler and Elizabeth would be great.
---
Fuck you too buddy

Spongebob gets his arm and stomach driven open by Frank

Nah not really it‚Äôs the same pretty much just a few decorations outside

 Imagine still hating Legion lol

Dwight got a hook up his ass.
---
If we were to get a Scooby DLC, I would want shaggy and Velma, but no killer. There is no one killer iconic enough for a Scooby DLC, and having 4 survivors would put the cost at equal to the base game.
---
Shaggy:
---
Teachables:
---
Level 30: He‚Äôs Behind Me
---
When the killer looks in your direction at a distance of 16 meters, He‚Äôs Behind Me activates. For the next 4/5/6 seconds you don‚Äôt leave any scratch marks. He‚Äôs Behind me can only be activated every 60/50/40 seconds
---
Level 35: Snack Time
---
Whenever you search the equivalent of one chest, the perk activates. The next time you are injured in a chase for 25/20/15 seconds, you heal one health state.
---
Level 40: We Sure Fooled Him
---
Whenever you lose a killer in chase, gain one token up to a max of 3/4/5 tokens. When your aura is shown to the killer, a token is consumed and your aura will not be shown to the killer for 5 seconds. At the end of the trial, you gain 10% bonus bloodpoints for each token remaining.
---
Velma:
---
Level 30: Jinkies! 
---
When running away from interacting with a generator, break into a sprint at 150% movement speed. This causes exhaustion for 60/50/40 seconds.
---
Level 35: What‚Äôs This?
---
While working on a generator with less than 50% progress, see the aura of killer belongings and generators within a 16/20/24 meter radius.
---
Level 40: I Found a Clue
---
When searching the basement chest, you have a 100% chance for the item to be rare or higher quality. 25/50/75% chance for the item to have an addon of rare or higher quality.
---
Please feel free to critique
---
Thanks, I totally looked that over lol. In my opinion, It'd be better as a feature then a full perk taking up a slot y'know?
---
I made that mistake. It's worth paying 50-60 for trick or treat studio masks. I also got bad latex that made me get itchy and break out from a Chinese myers mask.

My favorite part is when I hit a bush and it reacts like steel. Pretty sure that‚Äôs not how that works.

So no he can‚Äôt see your aura when you‚Äôre asleep anymore, and you don‚Äôt have to be asleep to get hit by Freddy anymore, and you don‚Äôt have an action speed penalty for being asleep anymore. They honestly did a complete overhaul and reworked him, and there‚Äôs way too much for me to type out at 9pm, but he‚Äôs a much better killer than he used to be.
---
Although I won‚Äôt explain all the crap about his power, the single best piece of advice that I can give you is to stay awake as much as possible. Freddy becomes extremely powerful in the chase if you‚Äôre asleep, so it‚Äôs best to be awake when he starts chasing you.
---
Ah, shit- I know that California‚Äôs Haunted Mansion has fully pimped out its ride with ANBC stuff, and I was hoping Florida would‚Äôve done the same this time.
---
Sound angry
---
I dc when others dc, ez
---
Question?
---
What jacket is that and where can I get one?
---
ITS A RANT GO FUCKING FIGURE
---
wait, are you for real?
---
Thank you!
---
if you check the wiki, the survivors have 9 rituals and only 4 of which can be for specific survivors multiplied by 19 survivors ({4X19}+5) making 81 survivor based dailies. There are 4 different killer dailies, but they all are for specified killers, which there are 17 killers X 4 dailies making 68 killer based dailies. statistically speaking you should get more survivor dailies, yet that never appears to happen, not even for me. I play both sides and more often than not have killer dailies.
---
Lol you quit so your friend could get the hatch. You robbed the killer of 2 kills.
---
a 3k with hatch is still a win....and i cant believe im saying this because I find slugging boring too but you are not entitled to a free escape. Why should the last survivor be guaranteed a free escape?
---
Captain [cutler] (http://imgur.com/gallery/5SfjFHV) would be awesome
---
Alrighty!
---
Behaviour needs money so they can feed the hamsters that currently power dedicates servers
---
Okay!
---
This is a rant by the way don‚Äôt know why it says discussion
---
Doctor had a glo up
---
what are some pallet perks? enduring?
---
I know I totally agree sad that it‚Äôd never happen
---
great list! id put demo up (as a demo main i think he is really solid) and place clown down one tier.
---
\- They are doing their best, they rather not realease a buggy event!  
---
\- THEY ALWAYS RELEASE SOMETHING BUGGY
---
ps: i cant imagine how buggy this shit was that it made them decide to delay it, it was way over their standars...
---
I mean he is the wraith but balding
---
...but I want an ahs dlc...
---
Sure it may weaken him, but only god-level powers can defeat hem when he‚Äôs been weakened.
---
I really expected it to be tough especially when it landed on a farm map. But nah no problems. Go for it! It was fun.
---
Have you considered playing a better killer? Can‚Äôt play low tier killers then complain about losing to good survivors ü§°
---
On Xbox, it‚Äôs always Survivors. I have to pray every time I load into a game that someone won‚Äôt DC and I have to sit in that queue for another half hour. That, and it really sucks when a survivor DCs before I can hook them for the BBQ stack.
---
How does that at all pertain to DS? Everyone thinks NoED should be changed. You have no argument.
---
honestly as a red rank surv I see a bit of toxicity in the chat but with my green rank killer i see more coming from purple rank survs. Not only that but Ive noticed as a surv if one person gets salty, you can push them down a little and defend the killer (bc salt is usually baseless accusations of "rude" gameplay styles tbh but whatever) But as killer, when i see salt, if no other survivor says something against the upset person they usually seem to bandwagon with eachother and just rip on the killer. Like a pack mentality. (I do spend around 50/50 time on each side this is just something i noticed and thought I'd share)
---
Madness lvl 4: Doctors in mirror are closer than they appear.
---
"They see me loadin'"
---
The higher the rank the saltier the players, and those both survivors and killers.
---
And for that exact reason I always try to be nice and not ruin the game for other people.
---
can‚Äôt you read?
---
Do you know how much you spent? And was it just all vinyl fabric? After playing GF for a few weeks now I wanted to make my own outfit but it seemed a bit difficult, but seeing your posts is giving me motivation.
---
I mean thats just robbing you of 3k bloodpoints. I don‚Äôt use Moris so I wouldn‚Äôt know but thats just stealing bp from you
---
I don't DC, but if my totems are cleansed in the first 15 seconds and gens being rushed, I'll facecamp.
---
I never knew it worked on the downed survivor!
---
The classic Jack-off'o-lantern.
---
haha survivor rule book.
---
I don't think it's a good decision nor do I think it's the only decision that was made for it. I'm saying if it was going to have issues, and it was originally going to run alongside 2 of the bigger games coming out this year, it made sense for it to go on the back burner not only to fix whatever issues but to also avoid competing against bigger titles.
---
As someone who used to play tons of Left 4 Dead (not quite the same game I know) But when a new title would come out (Battlefield 3, Call of Duty, Halo etc.) It would take a dip for a few weeks. (It was averaging 20-30k at the time) It would dip to about 10k-15k but would, in a few weeks return to it's 20k+ numbers after a newer title.
---
People would come back to a game they spent a lot of time in once they get bored of the new shiny one, especially if there was an event.
---
Match results:fanbase disappointed
---
Watched Babadook without knowing this format was from it. Had a good laugh lol
---
Not that I know, but I know the case where toolboxes on the lobby turn into Ebony moris.
---
It states " using a bug or an exploit to have an advantage is against the terms of service" you can read it yourself. I'm not gonna copy paste the EULA, you have Google to look it up and the game itself.
---
DC also is stated in the official forum rules as a unsportsmanlike action and punished by ban, posted by not_queen, community manager
---
Are you 5?
---
Honestly benefiting the killer would be nice with a SWF but I think it should be 5/10/15 and not 15/20/25 because getting BP with a killer is 10 times easier than getting BP as a survivor
---
It‚Äôll actually be a good buff if the doctor messes with your mind making you think you‚Äôre going one direction but it‚Äôs the other 
---
Call me crazy but it‚Äôll be a amazing buff or addon
---
I love whiney babies. I play on PC so usually the only hate mail I get is endgame chat and anytime a particular salty surv sends me a friend request after a game they get blocked. I love all my haters.
---
deliverance Adam was salty because we couldn‚Äôt save him from a facecamping Ghost Face
---
Naw
---
He was just salty tbh
---
It's not bullshit, look at all the best sprinters.
---
What killer would u run that on?
---
Suppressing the sounds of his abilities would help with the following:
---
* Hiding the fact that your Demogorgon whenever you hit someone.
---
* Hiding your loud as shit footsteps, which can help you be sort of stealthy.
---
* Hiding your loud as shit teleport sound which would actually let you sneak up on people when you teleport.
---
lol what you mean? U get crucified on this sub if ur say u teabag. Also theres no such thing and gen rushing and flashlighting while annyoing really its puts the survivor in a bad place. Get ur head outta your ass.
---
Purple ranks are insanely toxic on console and I have heard its bad on PC but idk. Plus there is a difference between tunneling and going after the first person you see at an unhook. Waiting for an unhook and downing the one that was just hooked is tunneling. Going away and someone getting a save and you follow the scratch marks is just bad luck.
---
As a no-pickup huntress, I'm right there with you guys.
---
Not surprising the only good cosplayer on this sub also makes quality memes/shitposts
---
That‚Äôd be cool
---
These what you unlock when you get legacy skin
---
Me wanting Predator:
---
The *terror* shack
---
3+ kills.
---
Pepsi lol
---
Pinhead would be amazing but I'd want the labyrinth map
---
Man do you know how fucking OP that would be? LMAO what‚Äôs the counter to that ‚Äúcalm mind‚Äù? Foh
---
I agree as a fellow huntress main. I have like 30 iri heads in my inventory just chillin, hoping for the day they rework it.
---
Im not saying it from the start it‚Äôs like that but like when they are tier 3 madness  ,it‚Äôll be rng based
---
ash is a god
---
Bro... lmao what‚Äôs the counter? The devs don‚Äôt need to add any more things to the game that are unbalanced
---
Exactly, and his idea is perfect. I would love to see that happening, would make dbd endgame much more fun. It's so boring to slug/get slugged for the 4k but it's standard on red ranks
---
‚ÄòYou are a monster!‚Äô Build.
---
I guess you can say Dweet has No Ed-ucation for this situation
---
This man took a screenshot of legion and tried to play it off as a cosplay
---
The reason she so called ‚Äútunneled ‚Äú you (you got farmed dude ) is because you had a key and it‚Äôs a killer priority that he doesn‚Äôt get messed up like free escape
---
I literally started upgrading my jake (didn‚Äôt care for his teachable and he is not dwight my main) just for the events new skin
---
Stealth mechanic??? Dbd is a looping simulation.
---
&gt;Usually when somebody goes to the subjective meme it‚Äôs because they have a small brain.
---
Ok let's look it up what subjective is and if comedy is, alright? Good.

subjective

[...]¬†if I think a joke is funny and you don't, does that make one of us right and the other wrong? It could be the case that, just like the taste of applesauce, the question of whether or not it's good is subjective. John points out that, however strange Kant's theory may be, it tends to rightly claim that humor is subjective.[...]

So what's up small brain?
---
&gt;I‚Äôm very confident that I could show this video to worthwhile dbd players and their thought/response would be ‚Äúk?‚Äù
---
Still subjective, especially if are your friends, who share your same taste. It's not difficult to understand if you have an IQ higher than 60
---
&gt;accompanied with the very apparent absence of laughter. But it‚Äôs ok, if these videos make you laugh, then we know where people like you are at mentally.

Yep. Especially when you call Kant a small brain I imagine how ascended you are.. please stop embarrassing yourself kid
---
Next time you """"try"""" to point out a fallacy, at least be informed about the argument
---
Trying to figure out how that match worked.
---
The Catalyst skin looks so good, outside of the glasses imo.
---
Just wish Meg got one as well. Seems odd that we got two of the original four survivors last year, and only one this year instead of two to complete the set.
---
it really doesnt, not sure why the downvotes lol
---
I don‚Äôt think it was because I had a key. She did the same thing to the Meg who dc‚Äôd
---
The adept Bill achievement you just need to escape with his perks thats all
---
I wish i was smarter with my choices and got the Dwight skin last year
---
Yeah really...
---
My personal gripe on the killer side is Mori animation spamming. So bs.
---
People with normal eyes miss those scratchys sometimes aswell xD sad!
---
So is adrenawin. At least you can prevent noed before the endgame.
---
So it wasn't because I played well it's because you played bad? There goes my ego :(
---
What my idea is ranked is where you get more points and pips in general and casual is you don‚Äôt pip but get normal about of bp like half of ranked or ranked get 64 k basically give better rewards
---
wait is this real? i‚Äôve never seen this perk being run in my entire Dead by Daylight career yet they still unhook me 2 ft in front of the killer
---
hi, just wanted to clarify that "more resources" isnt the correct way to put it. The devs see a bug and dedicate it to programmers while the cosmetic team stays the same. They do not prioritize or hire more people onto the art team, or move programmers over to add the skins onto models in game. Its always the same amount of people doing work in each department no matter the issue. There has been an increase in cosmetics as of late because it is the devs main source of income to keep their operations functioning, it is completely optional for the player to partake in, and because as the community expands so does the company, workers, and workload in the company itself. 
---
The devs constantly acknowledge bugs, like legion infinite mending, the protection hits not working for MoM, and the lag in dedicated servers. Their acknowledgement of bugs is why the event update is delayed. This prevents the hag bug of teleportation not working from entering the game, among other things they may have found in their base coding. 
---
Bugs are not fixable in an hour. Balancing is not an over night thing. Its faster for the art team to make a feng cosmetic than it is for a programming team to fix a bug, playtest it and iron out any persisting problems. The devs are working, berating them will not change anything, nor will being mad, upset, or stating how unfair you feel their use of resources is. quite frankly we all know the bugs, we all play the game. but your statement is just factually incorrect.
---
Hey! Finally a pc player in this subreddit.
---
You didn't ask a question you're just whining
---
Oh, I thought it was the same as killer, oops!
---
In that case nerf Franklins Demise and Moris to make it fair.
---
Oh, I thought it was the same as killer
---
&gt;Every millisecond counts in a chase 
---
As does time for the killer. You're essentially asking for the guesswork to be taken out of the game, which a huge chunk of this game is built around.
---
God no, I would never do those if that was the case
---
"Noed benefits bAd kilLeRs". Why can't people understand noed increases the difficulty of the EGC for survivors regardless of killer skill? If the killer struggled, this offers a potential comeback for them.
---
Lmao
---
One of the greatest post in a while
---
Be aware that AHK can trigger eac to flag and ban you
---
I am REALLY gonna miss J. Myers after Mid-Chapter
---
But we get bloodlust, that's our compensation for the wiping. Also since we move faster then survivors we'd just wack them twice.
---
Yeah, survivors acting like if being hit by a sledgehammer actually hurt.
---
It's a lot to explain, so I'll sum each part of his power and addons the best I can.
---
Dream snares: These are basically a combo of Trapper's traps and Clown's bottles. You place down a snare and when a survivor is asleep and steps in it they move slower for a few seconds. You get 8 snares to place down.
---
Dream pallets (addon): These are addons that replace Freddy's snares with fake pallets. You are able to place down these fake pallets in places that pallets would spawn in games but didn't spawn in the game. You get 10 dream pallets to use but keep in mind this is just an addon and not part of Freddy's base kit and they only work when survivors are asleep.
---
Dream transportation: Once it's fully charged up, you are able to teleport to a generator within a number of seconds. You are able to cancel this if you change your mind and don't want to teleport to a gen. Once you teleport it goes on cooldown for a little while.
---
Here's how the dream world works now: Survivors are given a 60 second timer, when that timer runs out they will be in the dream world automatically. Freddy can also hit survivors to instantly put them in the dream world. In order to wake up, you can still fail skillchecks to wake yourself up and survivors can still wake you up, but when a survivor wakes you up, the next time they try to wake someone up, it takes longer to wake them up each time they attempt it. Along with that, there are now these alarm clocks around the map and when you fall asleep, you must go to the one farthest away from you to wake yourself up. Unlike the old Freddy, when in the dream world, survivors action speeds are not slowed down (unless Freddy uses addons for it) but they do suffer from this new status effect called "oblivious" which makes it so that when in the dream world, they can't hear Freddy's heartbeat but instead hear the lullaby which is no longer directional. Survivors can also see and interact with the dream snares or dream pallets in the dream world which also gives them a reason to wake up.
---
Addons:
---
**Common:**
---
Wool Shirt: While survivors are in the dream world, slightly increases regression penalties on all actions when failing a skillcheck.
---
Sheep Block: When a survivor interacts with a dream snare or dream pallet, they suffer from the "blindness" status effect for 30 seconds.
---
Kid's Drawing: Grants 200% bonus bloodpoints in the deviousness category. Considerably reduces slowdown of dream snares.
---
Garden Rake: Replaces dream snares with dream pallets.
---
**Uncommon:**
---
Outdoor Rope: When survivors are in the dream world, all their action speeds are moderately slower.
---
Nancy's Sketch: Slightly reduces dream transportation cooldown.
---
Green Dress: While survivors are in the dream world, slightly increases regression penalties on all actions when failing a skillcheck. When survivors fail a skillcheck when in the dream world, their aura is revealed to Freddy for 3 seconds.
---
Cat Block: When a survivor interacts with a dream snare or dream pallet, they suffer from the "hemorrhage" status effect for 60 seconds.
---
Prototype Claws: Replaces dream snares with dream pallets. When a survivor interacts with a dream pallet, their aura is revealed to Freddy for 4 seconds.
---
**Rare:**
---
Jump Rope: When survivors are in the dream world, all their action speeds are considerably slower.
---
Nancy's Masterpiece: Moderately reduces dream transportation cooldown.
---
Blue Dress: While survivors are in the dream world, slightly increases regression penalties on all actions when failing a skillcheck. When survivors fail a skillcheck when in the dream world, their aura is revealed to Freddy for 4 seconds.
---
Unicorn Block: When a survivor interacts with a dream snare or dream pallet, they suffer from the "blindness" status effect for 60 seconds.
---
Paint Thinner: Replaces dream snares with dream pallets. When a survivor interacts with a dream pallet, their aura is revealed to Freddy for 6 seconds.
---
**Very Rare:**
---
Swing Chains: For each survivor in the dream world, all survivors suffer a slight penalty to all action speeds up to a maximum of a tremendous penalty.
---
Pill Bottle: Survivors will see Freddy intermittently at a reduced distance of 12 to 24 meters. Freddy is invisible to survivors beyond 24 meters. Freddy is invisible to awake survivors while carrying another survivor.
---
Class Photo: All generators will spew blood when Freddy channels his dream transportation ability. Freddy can no longer cancel dream transportation. Freddy's husk will not appear when using dream transportation.
---
Z Block: When a survivor interacts with a dream snare or dream pallet, they suffer from the "hemorrhage" status effect for 60 seconds. If a survivor is healthy, they will bleed for the duration of the hemorrhage status effetc.
---
**Ultra Rare:**
---
Black Box: Freddy becomes obsessed with one survivor. The obsession starts the trial in the dream world and can never wake up.
---
Red Paint Brush: All survivors start the trial in the dream world. Failing a skillcheck will no longer wake survivors up.
---
I do, but I wasn't sure if he knew where the hatch was, or if he was repairing. He also had full health, so if I closed the hatch, he might've been at the opposite end of the map, opening the gate, and if I hit him, I might lose him, so I didn't want to take that chance. I also wasn't sure how close I was to either of the gates, since I don't usually play that map.
---
He is a variety streamer.
---
Nah
---
That‚Äôs not my point did you even read my post at all? I‚Äôm saying not letting them do gens and heal and sabo HOW IN GODS NAME DID YOU GET BLOODLUST AND WACK THEM TWICE???? All this would fucking do is make survivors stop sabotaging hooks in killer faces and finish gens even though they were just hit I didn‚Äôt say they wouldn‚Äôt gain their speed boost or not be able to vault 
---
I MEAN SHIT WHERE IN GODS LEFT ASS CHEEK DID YOU GET WHAT EVER YOU GOT FROM MY POST 
---
I‚Äôm legit trying to wrap my head around this it‚Äôs fucking baffling DID I SAY GET RID OF KILLERS WIPE OFF ANIMATIONS???? FUCK NO
---
tl;dr Probably filled with stupid arguments
---
Who else can hear the Halloween music when Micheal raises the knife?
---
heyo!!
---
Whomever picked Legion and Dr have never been through the pain of bringing a medkit or healing related perk build and having it completely ruined by the Plague.
---
As others have said, I don't think there are enough players to split them like that without harming the game overall.
---
But what's stopping you from playing that way in the ranked queues? You can just play for fun and completely ignore all the rank and BP stuff if you want to.
---
Where does Aftercare rank?
---
No No, They have to speak their opinion on how you played the match, Even if you have no other choice you bet your ass you're gonna get flamed for being 50 meters within the range of the hook, Man sometimes even when you're across the map  they still say its camping
---
I used to love doing that during the old MoM days
---
Nice
---
I could imagine him being slow but having a flame thrower that increases reach with a cool-down either that or, because of his hulking tall size, a tremor stomp where he stomps the ground to mess with the survivors motor skills or speed from a great distance like the doctor has but his is electric and madness.
---
I deal with it by being understanding because I know how it is to be so close to escape and then get 'camped' at the end
---
When do you plan on doing Legion?
---
I am not denying I camped the last guy, I‚Äôm just trying to figure out why they treated me like I was the anti-Christ for being bad at billy. Don‚Äôt they want an easier game? Isn‚Äôt that what they want?
---
Nurse is still S tier even on console.
---
I mean pausing their actions is not the same I agree, but it stalls the end game just as much....25% of the time. If they're still by you doing the gen that's ok, sure they'll run your adrenaline but that's easily countered by noed. Also you could get a bitter murmor activation out of it.
---
Not even the entity can contain the sweet succulent power of Bepis
---
When the time is right - there is no plan
---
Welp, so I showed, source included, that you were wrong and why and your answer is "prob filled with stupid arguments"
---
Who's the small brain now? You can't even take an L and learn from it, you just prefer stay ignorant and call others small brain? You're a very sad person
---
I suggest to read that article.. or even better. read in general
---
I want a teddy bear killer. Don't know how or why, but I want one. And let the mori be strangling me with hugs.
---
I like not being able to find a NOED totem, or at least having to waste a lot of time trying to find it. It makes the late game all the more tense and you gotta think about your escape instead of just rushing an open gate.
---
Lowtier doesn‚Äôt always mean that they are bad necessarily except that they would struggle with survivors and or competing with better killers. Each of them have a more benefiting counter part, Huntress with Clown and Hag with Demigorgan/The Nightmare. I believe these small changes will be balanced as well as viable to compete against these higher tier killers and more skilled survivors.
---
Probably because you camped
---
Does the mid-chapter update have a release date yet?
---
But like isn't the Pig worse than Legion at this point?
---
Pig rework/buff when?
---
No, they want to all escape and if they dont get what they're 'entitled' to then it's just gonna be a flame war, that's why either just dont respond or be kind
---
Why should he surrender the hook? Tell me one good killer sided reason.
---
Cause there hasn't been any patches since it was introduced.
---
Oh, alright then
---
Looks good tho, nice job
---
I‚Äôm having a stroke man holy shit 
---
That‚Äôs my point survivors finishing gens in your face having the slight pause in actions for that couple seconds wouldn‚Äôt mean anything else also where the fuck did NOED and Adrenaline come from are you thinking I mean for like a long ass time or some shit? Because I‚Äôm just saying they should make it last for a second longer then it takes for you to wipe off your weapon
---
That sentiment doesn't make sense, everyone has a story to tell when it comes to games. It's not an accomplishment to poke someone till they react. Any clown can do that.
---
If they put Scooby Doo in I'll actually play constantly ( I dont play I just creep because my gf loves this game and I like showing her memes and stuff )
---
My wife and one her work buddies love drinking wine and watching me play on the xbox. Those crazy broads are crazy fucking savage back-seat drivers. 
---
"Slash him, slash him! Kill that bitch! Hook hook hook!".
---
i dont, thankfully, but no, check killers at red ranks, they safety pip on 3ks, which seems kinda dumb to me.
---
Id say carve the watch hands into the pumpkin (if you did im sorry it looks like sharpy on my phone) but it is friggin awesome
---
Since they started fucking them up, there hasn‚Äôt been a patch....
---
RIGHT
---
You suggested giving Huntress 115% are you fucking looney??? She would be unstoppable oh my god she‚Äôs already a terrifying killer in the right hands
---
And you basically made hag a god tier version of Demogorgen at all times
---
Would certainly explain how you act when you feel something isn't personally important. 
---
Might explain why you've "been" married. *thumbs up* 
---
And it had a point. Others grasped it just fine. You are just too focused on thinking it's a comparison to see it, though. And yes, I refuse to explain it, specifically to you. 
---
Lastly - no, that's not my argument. Try again if you want though!
---
Oh yeah, love a 5 perk load out. You're asking for a small change for something that doesn't happen too frequently because you get tilted by something which is probably the result of your own poor map management. 
---
I don't know, you seem to be out here all "THIS SMALL ASPECT OF SOMETHING A SURVIVOR DOES TILTS ME TO TO END PLS FIX"
---
I was pointing out that if you find these things so tilting run a counter or get over it. The things your pointing out are just both committed survivors and your own poor game play. If someone baits a hit to pop a gen usually they're down straight after that, so obviously you've been poor at applying pressure, but stay pressed.
---
Where's the fix Legions useless add ons section?
---
Like what's the point of adding a short status effect if people are just going to be mending anyway?
---
Is that Conker I see? Starfox maybe?
---
Why defend the devs? After all there a business selling a product to consumers and this isn‚Äôt status quo for this industry it‚Äôs only natural consumers be upset especially after releasing some of the content early but locking it behind a pay wall
---
THE POINT IN ASKING FOR A SMALL CHANGE LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE ITS SMALL
---
I‚Äôm not asking for the world man I just don‚Äôt like that survivors can raw dog a killer while their  wiping off their weapon and the be able to get to grandmas before supper this was just a suggestion that would be good for both sides in all honesty it‚Äôs the same when I may have even stuttered the phrase
---
 ‚Äúhey that no mither sabo swf Build is really anti fun right guys should we do a small thing to fix it so people can‚Äôt bully killers an entire game‚Äù 
---
The entire DBD sub Reddit community collective fucking unleashed their unholy wrath upon me ‚Äúrun hangman‚Äôs trick‚Äù ‚Äúoh get over it it‚Äôs not that powerful‚Äù and shit like that like come on man why is it such a sim to point out stuff that‚Äôs really anti fun for killers
---
 (I‚Äôm not gonna bring up how fast ‚Äúanti fun‚Äù stuff gets fucking destroyed if it‚Äôs anti fun for survivors)
---
You think they fix bugs?
---
it comes at the expense of not holding a toolbox or Medkit, bringing a key is a huge gamble. I've only seen a key escape used once in the last 300ish games I've played. Also this unwritten book of etiquette is ridiculous, if you dont like moris that's cool, but people will cry if they die "fair" or "unfair". Half the fun is trying to figure out what build I'm up against and when that mori animation starts it's like "OH FUCK I GOT PLAAAAYED" I feel like key escape is that but for killers. Also if someone runs a plunder build and scores a hatch key then spawns the hatch then finds the hatch that luck earns them the hatch.
---
But I also only ever solo queue, so I'd never be in a position to 4man hatch it. Which I have to imagine is utter bullshit and the reason I refuse to swf.
---
Lol don‚Äôt worry everyone‚Äôs just using it cause they know it‚Äôs getting nerfed
---
I just picked this game up and love it! But wow does being a typical chase killer suck. I run doctor and hag so I don't need to rely on scratch marks as much. But I have def played mostly survivor to avoid the issue entirely.
---
definitely check the boiler room first on badham
---
Wait.......self care was buffed?
---
I don‚Äôt see anything like that in rules
---
If you see one in the pre lobby just dodge, if they randomly find one in a chest i guess god just hates you
---
That‚Äôs not about hatch spawns it‚Äôs about keys and how (in my opinion) they shouldn‚Äôt let multiple people escape, one maybe but not all of them and no I don‚Äôt care if it automatically closes after 30 seconds
---
So because I camped when the gates were opened, I get ganged up on by all four of them in the end? An attitude like that just continues a toxicity chain
---
I‚Äôd vote for spirit. Fuck her. Crazy reach. Ultra annoying with anal, I mean prayer beads.
---
Break the mirrors so she doesn‚Äôt teleport like demigorgan. Eventually repairs itself. Or becomes broken permanently when the generator is completed
---
Gen pressure is a playstyle it just becomes considerably easier for some killers over others.  But I've successfully pressured gens with the likes of Wraith so issuing a blanket statement declaring it impossible to provide gen pressure with certain killers is a little ridiculous.
---
Even Otz gets salty, thought he was going to lose it when the insta nerf was announced as every game he had he faced instaheals, often multiple. Now I don't blame him, I'd be to, but yeah everyone gets salty at times.
---
You don‚Äôt speak for everyone bro tons of people like me think NOED is fair. Same with DS, it‚Äôs powerful but it has counters and it can decide games just like NOED hut that doesn‚Äôt mean either perk is unhealthy
---
Shut the fuck up lmao. You see guys like Otz, Ohtofu and Monto play super agresive and using the killer power to their advantage and still get a safety pip.
---
I was talking lore wise
---
Never said it wasn‚Äôt
---
Columbia jacket and a paper plate. That‚Äôs about right.
---
Yea that‚Äôs my insta  I forgot to put my reddit name lol
---
lol! i think u worded it perfectly right there
---
Only ones I agree with would be keys and swf, like the rest can be dealt with. Annoying, but come on , lets all toughen up a bit and not complain about someone using a game mechanic well. 
---
Swf wasn‚Äôt intended, but reality is people want to play with their friends. You can either complain about it or try go kill them. 
---
Keys just feel really unsatisfying when you kill 1 person then 3 people just yeet out of the game cause they got an item. Maybe it‚Äôd be fine if you couldn‚Äôt bring keys into matches, only find them, but thats how it is now. If you see someone with a key, deal with em.
---
How are you not working with Behavior?? üëçüëèüëè
---
Yea that‚Äôs prolly true in regards to it being more on the key. It‚Äôs just heartbreaking to protect 3 gens, my totem, and play fair i.e. not be near hooks for my devour to trigger, only to safety pip cus the last 2 can just dip out
---
Just because that can happen does not mean it's the norm.  I've played plenty of games and pipped plenty of times off of a 3K.  4K's are not mandatory to pip.  If the game goes on a while and you get enough scoring events 3K is enough.
---
Yeah, it has a pretty wide range, but you can crouch-walk over them and they won't trigger
---
BHVR released dedicated servers. But has had decreased the quality of everyone‚Äôs experience, mine included. I get hit through windows even though I have ‚Äú20 ping‚Äù killers teleport, dead hard doesn‚Äôt work, Myers t3 resets, trapper steps in his own traps after placing them, etc
---
when i hook, do my rounds and no one comes for the rescue with only 30 seconds left on hook timer? im gonna stay with you until your last moments bro
---
This isn‚Äôt a hit box issue, you‚Äôre lagging hard in this match. This is obviously a connection issue
---
Try hard resetting your game, console, or PC. If you‚Äôre not seeing any change, disable your internet then re-enable it after a couple minutes. Everyone i have trouble finding a match, i do this and it always help!!
---
I‚Äôm with this guy, or girl.
---
The salt in this thread.
---
Imagine running self care in 2019
---
Surely you don‚Äôt mean CI is corrupt intervention?
---
what about Furtive Chase, which could half your normal terror radius with 4 stacks?
---
I totally understand doc being hated.
---
Jealousy of his glorious laugh ofc
---
Yes. Amazing
---
You mean Claudette right?
---
Dude people have been try hards since you could play against another player, people always doing cheap shit and talking trash even back in the days of the arcades.
---
You were probably *slightly* early as well as a ping issue.
---
They have yet to respond to anything I've done :(
---
Imagine how his knee full of shrapnel feels when he uses balanced landing.
---
I also love the idea of teachable perks being taught by the survivor they come from.  Meg just holding track practice for a gambler, Vietnam vet, and roadie is endlessly amusing.
---
The only balanced killer would be one that gives free purple+ items and BP with their Hug power.  
---
  
---
Killers that use their powers to win are tryhards.
---
I changed my name to IF IM HOOKED DO A GENNY. was extremely effective. I never got saved.
---
I don't know if it's just me, but maining strong killers isn't fun for me. I used to main Spirit and Billy, but it got boring.
---
i can personally guarentee im younger then you
---
My set up is balanced landing, borrowed, iron will and decisive usually.
---
Wait... Like..
---
Dude, survivors healing and ending chases fast takes away from your emblem score. One you have little control over, the other is necessary to win against decent survivors(and you have to let them heal so you get more hits during chases, that's fucked up). The only way to get a pip with 3k is if you're facing baby survivors.
---
R/perfectlycutscreams
---
Top-Tier meme
---
I usually take what i can get first. Honestly i mostly realize who¬¥s the obsession after a hook like "ohh, hes the obsession, cool, cool"
---
I only take it serious with Myers because his perks, and then i let them run on purpose
---
lvl 50, t3 means capping him 3 times. Its like Prestige 3. Technically lvl 200.
---
yeah, mentally u r lol
---
Straight fathers everywhere ~~hate~~ love this!
---
Oh damn. Good luck on your quest, soldier.
---
I have been that Dwight before. :) &lt;3
---
Yes, and make the killer 1 hit survivors and Mori them even if they werent on hook once
---
idk why people act like ruin is such a disgrace to have cause it‚Äôs so ‚Äúop.‚Äù it‚Äôs actually really balanced.. ways to counter it, good benefits. just rage from salty survivors.
---
It really depends because there are different Hag add-ons to widen the range of the trap to different degrees
---
I think thats a great idea he'd be an awesome killer.
---
So far just have Hag t3 50. Working on bubba right now. At 45 t2.
---
After watching Slumber Party Massacre II tonight, I really want The Driller Killer in DBD. With accompanying rock music.
---
Nope, it doesn't imply shit, maybe you should take a critical thinking course since this is somehow hard for you, but don't worry, I'll hold your hand and guide you through the correct interpretation.  
---
When I say that subjectivity is a meme, it's because that saying humor is subjective is largely a platitude‚Äîa non-controversial claim. Literally nobody in today's age would argue that humor is objective, so why you would assume such a stupid premise is beyond me; so what else could *possibly* be implied here? Oh wait, we can still make assessments on humor in that just because humor is subjective doesn't suddenly mean that a significant portion of people don't find it funny. So I'm essentially saying that because I find the humor shitty and fairly non-existent, there's a good chance that others would be in the same position. It's kind of like how I can't say that MadTV is objectively not funny because there's a pool of stupid as shit people that laugh at all the jokes in there despite a large number of people seeing it for what it is.  
---
So is your comment a strawman? Yes absolutely it is, nobody in their right mind would argue that this video doesn't possess comedy, but whether or not there is a portion of people that don't find it funny is a highly reasonable claim to make that could be empirically tested if we really bothered to do so. Yeah, when you come in with the cringey as fuck Kant rant on something completely unrelated to the content of my posts, I can only respond with bewilderment since you're criticizing a boogeyman rather than actually addressing the actual argument at hand. Like who the fuck brings in philosophy in a dead by daylight forum? Oh do I need to look at the intricacies of Kant's epistemological works, what about Hegel? Leibniz? Nietzche?  Maybe you can see how cringey as fuck it is to come in here with the mindset of a idiotic undergrad that just took his first philosophy 101 course and trying to desperately throw out what little factoids he can to feel smart no matter how irrelevant it is the discussion at hand.  
---
I digress though, I can totally see why you think the way you do and why you find shit like this video funny. Have fun white knighting more shitty comedy, kid.
---
Let me guess, even with DS, BT, Adrenaline, 3 insta heals and they still all died you got complaints about being Camper/Tunneler
---
I don't know why some survivors are assholes when it comes to camping after the doors are opened. Like, if a killer hasn't gotten a kill and they camp a survivor at the end, what's the big deal? At that point, you have to secure a kill somehow. It's not a big deal.
---
Scp 106 would work best in my opinion. Look up the idea and you‚Äôll see why
---
The spaghetti code of this game, I swear to God.
---
Not yet. We can hope for tomorrow but I wouldn‚Äôt hold onto anything until we see a full release date.
---
*Chad ash actually getting mettle to work*
---
It‚Äôs my favorite thing to do in the game.
---
Edit: I lied, I was talking about the one pictured above.
---
When they escape a trap first try it‚Äôs luck because they free them selfs by like I said by just waiting to see if they get the 25% (I‚Äôm pretty sure) chance to escape
---
Can confirm. Yesterday in a match someone told me to make sure I boop her snoot, and sure enough she let me do generators.
---
Wtf he is toxic, he literally throws bottles of anesthesia which can be considered a toxin when used in this context.
---
You must play A LOT. I've only gotten my Nightmare to 32 or 33, and others aren't even past 10
---
This is a very Scarry genre game
---
The whole mechanic is flawed. But it benefits survivors so they‚Äôll defend it and say it‚Äôs fine
---
See, this is how I know you won, you couldn't substantiate your argument when faced with facts. I'll take the L here with my facts. Enjoy having cum for brains and getting B's in your undergrad ventures. Glad I'm done with grad school. Classic incel.
---
How is Wraith 5th?
---
No seriously how is Wraith more annoying then Hillbilly or Huntress especially if they're good landing Chainsaw and Hatchets.
---
*teleports behind you*
---
Ok but what the hell is that hatch spawn.
---
So you do not find chases fun?What exactly do you even like playing killer then?
---
You're the one whining that you got outplayed. They literally did what they had to do to get out. You're just upset that you didn't get the 4k.
---
They already nerfed insta heals and now y‚Äôall want them to nerf keys? I‚Äôm all for it if they get rid of mori‚Äôs to even it out, but you wouldn‚Äôt want that, right?
---
The ‚ÄòHorror Scarry‚Äô part is what got me.
---
The perks shouldn't work against every killer. Your build is suppose to be a gamble that you're praying trumps the killers build. Just like going for a hook save when you know it's a stealth killer is a gamble. If you can make a build that can fuck over every killer every game it's not really a survival game.
---
I want his difficulty raised to hard.
---
Hes a genuinely hard killer to play well, requiring a lot of map and game knowledge to actually be good at.
---
Yea that hatch spawn kinda sucked
---
if you watched the video, you might see that his idea is actually *more* interesting. Instead of whoever finds the hatch first wins, it's whoever outplays the other for x amount of time wins

I've had it happen several times at suspicious moments, like I get a quick down, go for the pick up, and disconnect.  I suspect one of the survs is running some script kiddy program to force the killer to d/c, buuuttt it might just be as simple as Behaviour's servers being shit and deciding to puke at ill-timed moments.
---
L-O-D-S of E-M-O-N-E
---
What‚Äôs that spell? Loadsamoney!
---
If they all died with meta perks and items, then are survivors actually that op? No. So why are they being nerfed constantly?
---
*insert piano music here*
---
It would be a cold day in hell before a cosmetic is delayed though.
---
Most of the time the killer wouldn't care and just use that opportunity to try and get some free hits.
---
Underrated comment my man üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Moris if anything give you less points so
---
Are you seriously calling a slow down perk like dying light a second chance perk?
---
And survivors also have second chance perks.
---
They weren‚Äôt going to beat it because they allowed a 3 gen strat to get set up. That‚Äôs a misplay on their part. So I shouldn‚Äôt be rewarded for having the better strategy? Like how do you feel when you get all gens done then go down to a killer using NOED? This is the killer side of that. People complain all the time that NOED rewards killers for failing. The key rewards survivors the same way. I‚Äôm not trying to throw a tantrum or be toxic but when you start coming at me like I just played poorly and got outplayed ima get a little defensive.
---
20-10 was a great place to play. everyone just playing the game having fun. the second I got to 9 I was surrounded by a toxic sludge of whiny fucks. I have no idea if it gets better the higher you go but I cant be arsed. Anytime I get to 9 I throw a couple games to get back where the decent humans exist. I wish there was a rank lock you could throw on. People who care about rank are awful.
---
I know right? Like she can easily just teleport right up there and hit them immediately. There's no way they can even get away from her haha.
---
A Shaggy Ace
---
Exactly. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I ran a mori that wasn‚Äôt for a daily and even then I only use it on death hook.
---
Bad take
---
I think for on Xbox if you close the game while its loading it doesn't lose a pip. If the loading screen takes more than 30 seconds with no progress you can quit and it shouldn't count against you. Before the Endgame change in April if someone dc then you had to play 3 survivors with 4 gens and it was worse than it is now. So you will lose time but it's not that bad except for that guy same survivor doing it each time you will have to quit in the lobby if you see bad players. You will get a lot of the same players late at night and dedicated servers will make it so you play against the same people a lot more because you will play people closest to you but idk if it will change the loading waits. I think that guy just had bad internet or was playing on a hotspot if it didn't show someone dc, there are more errors lately that should be fixed when the event/patch happens.
---

---
This kind of content is why I‚Äôm still on this sub despite rarely playing anymore
---
Super late on the reply but i just got my lazy ass back on the grind and exporting and uploading the video now. I'll put your username and link to this thread in the description is that okay?
---
I had to buy 12 new pairs of shitpants cuz I shit my pants each time I hear his scream
---
I even pointed that out where you said that and I replied proving to you, with facts, you were wrong. Then started ranting how you you didn't.. you are posting cringe my dude, or just short memory issues
---
Listen, was fun and all but I won't reply again to you. I can't handle a sub fridge temp IQ person for too long so just I let you have the last words so you would feel somewhat better after been embarrassed several times. Have fun in your lil world where you're always right and also contradictory at the same time
---
Aw thank you so much, you're a doll! &lt;3
---
.... That's why I said "try"? Anyway my point is most of the time I've one stuff like this Killers don't play along.
---
Pretty sure that was BT
---
I had that exact same experience once. Outcome was pretty much spot-on.
---
yea just ride that high road. acknowledge that it isnt you, they clearly have something in their life makes them want to act out. then block them and never think about them again.
---
Corrupt intervention, BBQ, and Sloppy are on the same tier as instaheals and Mori's? What? Lmao
---
Yeah... hey
---
But the hero you need don'cha? :p
---
Radical! Now you can insta heal someone at the exit gate on the offchance you get a skillcheck!  
---
Autodidact really needs to increase healing skillcheck odds or something to make up for how hard it is to stack up tbh.
---
Most definitely.
---
I will definitely agree with him being harder than most newcomers expect in terms of map knowledge and were traps to and not to be predictable. But what would happen to the bag add-ons?
---
Finally someone gets it
---
me on the right
---
great idea but i honestly wish they stopped giving us all these aura perks.
---
endgame strategy is still strategy. I dont get why people get so pissy about it. with borrowed time and body blocking, noed can really clinch your endgame. the only perk i hate playing against is insidious, but half the killers have that built in anyway.
---
You are the one that brought up the concept of "fair". And in the whinyplayers handbook moris are EVIL. so putting tokens on devour hope must also be EVIL. I dont care either way I just thought your definition of fair was funny in the context of your perks. 
---
And lastly ONE OF THE KILLERS IS A KIDDIE DIDDLER.
---
Very well put
---
I mean... Pennywise was defeated by kids.
---
Every single game has had at least two. Absolute cancer
---
I would forgive them for the event if this existed
---
I didnt mean they were op I meant theyre things that can help against the things in the pic I probably should have worded it better lol
---
Agreed
---
It feels like Pennywise is close
---
With Iron Will and Stridor in play, an injured survivor grunts at 50% noise. Considering most spirits are capable of tracking the soft footsteps of survivors, any grunts of pain is a death sentence. 
---
I'm saying it now. Iron Will is going to be a mandatory perk, with Stridor becoming mandatory on spirits as a counter
---
Brutal Strength won't stop instaheals, DS, or fast gen speeds.
---
Ooo ok I gotcha. And yess I agree
---
r/EmojiPolice
---
Lay your memes down and walk away
---
&gt; ‚ÄùRules Set No.2‚Äù add on becomes part of standard kit
---
Yeah, let's nerf Pig once more, brilliant
---
I did. It is a fundamentally flawed idea that sets the standard that the killer runner is the only acceptable way to play the game.
---
No those are just bad ideas that either make him worse most of the time or make him better but such a niche way... his traps are perfectly hidden on any maps that have existing grass... and on maps that dont like hawkins you can still use your traps to a great extent I actually have alot of gameplay guides showcasing how you can make trapper an extremely viable killer on the game, hawkins and even lerys by using what I call trap camping.
---
Basically making an entire area a dead zone with traps and protecting  the traps like gens.
---
A trap that denies a path or an area or a pallet is just as strong as a trap that is stepped in. Always remember that.
---
His traps are good color and he basically becomes billy/spirit tier on a good map with tar bottle add on traps... because they are invisible and you can place them in the most overpowered spots that they cant see and will always step in.
---
So I'm opposed to removing the skill of good trap placement from trapper.
---
Doc received a massive glow up, and Billy's way better as a trucker
---
no brutal strength is for pallets and franklins demise is for instaheal, not tunnelling is for DS and hex, pop goes the weasel and overcharge is for fast gens.
---
You should do that now then. This game is all about BM and who can BM more. Its a cycle of killers getting bullied so they bully survivors.
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
Same lol she's a fan of Freddy Kreuger
---
Gen rushing is literally a term used for the generators getting done to fast but that‚Äôs why we killer players bring ruin. If anyone complains about ‚Äúgen rushing‚Äù then they are just looking for an excuse.
---
They would work as are but just increase from 3.... if you bring a stitched bag you start with all your traps... plain and simple.
---
BEEP BEEP RICHIE
---
Ooh, that would work really well for Ghostface.
---
Amazing content and spot on! Shocked to see it on this sub.
---
do you partake in the activity of enjoying the uncomfortable scary motion pictures for entertainment purposes?
---
The Dwight nodding had me smiling, but when Myers joined in....
---
So one Survivor left, whole team got fucking murdered and they should have to do 4-5 gens by themselves? No. Just because you get devour cucked by a key doesn't mean you always will.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since July this year. Im consistently in red ranks with killer. This isn‚Äôt an argument based on my time played. I‚Äôve seen videos of how the game used to play before egc was added as well. And while that did look like some utter bs to deal with I don‚Äôt think the current system is perfect. After discussing it with others in this thread I think the key is more what I have a problem with and not the hatch itself. And to your point of the last survivor being too scared to do one gen then yea keep the hatch but change the spawn conditions to be just if there is only 1 left alive instead of having it on the map with multiple survivors.
---
Legion 3rd? Are people just having PTSD from old legion? He has the lowest killrate of any killer right now.
---
i love u
---
No the current spawn condition of 1 left alive should still spawn the hatch too. But it shouldn‚Äôt pop up with multiple survivors still alive so they can group key themselves out.
---
Ive almost died on hook because Third Seal makes you not even see where hooked survivors at you have to go off memory. It shows when they get hooked but nothing after that
---
You're not going to fit if you share a locker with Jeff.
---
The Spirit is a lot of fun to play until you get genrushed by Iron Will sided survivors while one of them fast vault the window and starts teabagging during the chase
---
...maybe I should start running that more
---
f
---
Well imo, if a Killer can Mori every Survivor and only have to hook them once, every Survivor or atleast most of them should be able to escape through hatch. It's only fair.
---
Pepsi maaaaaaaaan
---
The problem is its still a totem so you never know how much it will benefit you but use it like Thanatophobia and try to hit everyone first if you can. Combine with Thrill of the Hunt and that's a lot safer
---
I don‚Äôt like this but it‚Äôs perfect lmfao
---
As The Spirit main I‚Äôm gonna remember this :)
---
i mean how is face camping or tunnelling any different though from a killers stand point? If there's no rule saying you can't camp, then theres no rule saying you can't body block imo :)
---
I mean my definition of fair is what survivors call fair. Btw even if I‚Äôm not running devour I don‚Äôt camp hooks. I don‚Äôt get up in arms about how others play either. I play both killer and survivor. Ive seen the worst of both sides. This community would be a lot healthier if more people played both honestly. They‚Äôd understand what the other goes through. They can think getting to to devour 5 is evil all they want cus it‚Äôs hard as hell to get it there much less maintain it. And yea that‚Äôs true one of them is just seemed an odd comparison to make lol.
---
I dont believe you played poorly. it sounds like you had a really strong game. And you didnt mention them having the key in the lobby so it sounds like they got lucky. And as far as my experience with the game it's always been about 50/50 luck to skill. 
---
And I never rage against a killer using noed. when I get whacked in the endgame I usually think I should have faked that window. or i shouldn't have 360ed clockwise twice in a row. But I've been on reddit long enough to know that most people are VERY VOCAL about what a clutch baby killer ez 360noscope noob nub perk it is.
---
But also, fuck most people. 
---
I'm sorry you half lost your game, but I still think the hatch mechanics work fine as is.
---
Susie mains unite
---
You realize how big the building is right.
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
Yeah. Like make it grant 50% more chance for healing skill checks without medkit
---
I‚Äôm all for removing moris. This post had nothing to do with moris. Idk why people keep bringing them up.
---
Mine has a deep fear of The Huntress. The lullaby freaks her out.
---
She‚Äôs always reminding me to equip items, it‚Äôs so cute. She‚Äôll be like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have Self Care so remember to equip a medkit!‚Äù.
---
But why is using perks or items that are in the game toxic?  I don't get this?  Don't care what he did but I'm just saying why does it matter what the player used.  I just don't get the logic with this kind of thinking. If it's in the game and it's not an exploit, why wouldn't you use it?
---
Cause Keys are essentially Moris for Survivors as they give a easy and free win. But I don't wanna remove Moris and neither do the devs.
---
Noed does not counter adrenaline
---
‚ÄúWarmer, warmer. Wait! Now you‚Äôre cold come back. Okay... warmer‚Äù
---
How could she teleport up there?
---
Lmaooo this is perfect! Congrars ya'll.
---
I‚Äôm right there with you. This is the only game I‚Äôve ever played that I had to set my messages to friends only. It‚Äôs hypocrisy on each side from the ‚Äúmains.‚Äù I used to check the profiles on Xbox from people I‚Äôd get messages from and you‚Äôd see something like 80 days played and like 100-150 kills so you could tell they never really play killer. Myers is my favorite to go against. I‚Äôll never forget the first time I played against him. Popped a gen turned around and he was right there in my face. Nearly shit a brick.
---
Cuz there is no punishment for quitting. Start taking blood points off for quitting, they will soon stop.
---
Oh yeah. You can hang me on whatever hook you want.
---
Yes but it's risky she might just be trying to kill you which is why you must respect those that do.
---
I‚Äôm still quite new to DBD do I have a very important question: How do you unlock different survivor perks on another survivor? For example: Claudette could have Balance Landing which is a Meg Perk
---
Hey, these are absolutely amazing. It really gives a cinematic feeling to the characters and would 100% increase the intensity that we all felt in the early days of this game. Great work!

You don't get it? There a difference between taking it for survivability and taking it to destroy the fun of the killer player. If you take it I don't care, but I'd you take it and play like an asshole and ruin the fun of others, that's the end of the line!

The system is way better than before and its pretty ok the way it is, no need to change...if you want so hard to 4k every round, then thats on you, theres no absolute need to force survivors to work in a gen alone with almost no time to finish a single generator
---
Zoinks, Scoob! It‚Äôs like, a P3 Ghostface!

These are what are called teachable perks. If you reach a character‚Äôs bloodweb to lvl 30, 35, and 40, you can unlock these teachable perks for a character that another character can inherit, like the balance landing perk from Meg

Queting otz: "I feel like moris should be like Aw shit he has a mori we need to work around it and not like Oh he has a mori better disconnect" and I agree with him. A change is required for both key and mori but the issue is, what change can we make?

It's only about 75% of the community haha and tbh legion deserves it
---
People tbag in the beginning of the game as a sign of greeting lol
---
I'd legitimately pay BHVR to remove legion from the game hahaha
---
It seems every time there's rank reset, and I play Myers, I run into lots of lower level survivors who assume I'm being friendly because I'm not immediately swinging my knife at them. They don't seem to grasp the fact that I'm stalking them, and the longer they stay there teabagging, the more I'm loving it.
---
Nah hes serious.
---
No.
---
I played this game it is absolute crap
---
This sounds super good and pretty ok at the same time
---
is it? i had no idea
---
Hey man I don‚Äôt know about you but I‚Äôd be down for Hellpriest (pinhead). 
---
But yeah you are right, but my main focus doesn‚Äôt go to the bugs it goes to all the weak underpowered killers and perks.

---
It's a lot more probable for a killer to find someone opening the hatch, especially when they get a notification, vs a survivor escaping the killer on death hook.
---
Is the joke the rocket launcher is facing the wrong  way or something I do t get this meme.
---
Ah yes, stand still (the opposite of what you want to do with feral frenzy) to make your terror radius zero (guess insidious was never an option) and delay the timer a little longer... I see literally no use in that change, it's just adding something new that won't improve or make anything worse, it's just new for the sake of being new.
---
The envy is strong with this one.
---
Ok thank you so much
---
Or you didn't chase for long enough because you killed them too quickly
---
Yeah, true, but still, I think these changes are better, as you could just be doing a 3 gen, then you lose 3 kills. Or you get downed instantly, get off hook, then morid.
---
&gt;But when I make a post celebrating getting all iridescent emblems for the very first time,my only positive experience with this game in the last 2-3 weeks, it gets removed in less than ten minutes. 
---
It's against the rules. Most people are tired of post-game screenshots of any kind so they're quick to get deleted.
---
As far as the other thing, call the entire community shitty, I guess people will take umbridge with that. You reap what you sow. You're allowed to have your opinion of course but it's really fucking stupid to go:
---
"Hey! You group of people over there, I think you're entitled little shits!"
---
and then get upset when people respond in kind.
---
G.I.R.L. - guy in real life.
---
Girl power
---
That could have gone dark so fast.
---
hah yeh there's probably a couple in there xD
---
idk man maybe the game just sucks
---
And it's all uploaded, i made sure to put the credit right at the top of my stupid description. I really appreciate you letting me use this it's a cute picture and i dig your art. Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HtGplteGGQ) btw.
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
Unfortunately hag sucks at chases so you really have to use your traps to your advantage. I like to run make your choice and one hit the unhooker, and bet your ass if the person who got unhooked doesn't get far enough away I will probably chase them. A good counter to hag is to bring a flashlight and break her traps but that doesn't really help you if you are hooked lol.
---
Re
---
I love her sound effects
---
That's my point. That's against the rules but posting threads insulting the devs and inciting both sides of the argument to be dicks to each other (myself included) is just fine. Doesn't make sense to me 
---
I may have overreacted but you can't deny the community was being shitty. Practically the entire subreddit was full of negativity and insults for anyone and everyone. I stated that people were being entitled because they would've had the same reaction either way. They delayed the event to fix it, people got pissed. But if they had released the event on time and it was broken, people would've been just as, if not more pissed. And considering my comments are still pretty high in the positive upvotes despite the tidal wave of negativity I received, plenty of people seem to agree.
---
If you never tried play hag (or just a different killer if you don‚Äôt have her) once you get to higher ranks you tell me how to play hag.
---
It's a man tho
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Keys were the next thing they rework. Not sure what they would do with them tho
---
What's especially weirs is that Hags don't seem to understand what their power DOES.  They will set down a milliondy billiondy traps arround a hook, then camp so close to the hook that they literally don't even need to teleport to hit incoming/outgoing survivors.  Like bitch, your power lets you close in from 1/3rd to 1/2 the map away (depending on the map), why are you standing 10 feet away?
---
It's why I hate getting Hag daily challenges, because even though I play don't play like the world's biggest dickhead (only a reasonably sized dickhead, running **Make Your Choice**, **Hex: Devour Hope**, **Hex: Haunted Grounds**, and **Surveillance**), I know that every survivor is going to assume I'm a colossal dickhead and play like I'm a colossal dickhead even when I try to show that I'm a good sport.  And I don't blame them for thinking that, because Hags are by and large some of the most fun hating fucks in this game.  For all the memes about basement camping Bubba, Hag is truly the "no one gets to have a good time" queen.
---
He doesn't make himself out as innocent. It's some of his viewers who do. Though you're saying instaheals aren't toxic is questionable. It's a bs addon that takes no skill. People do say Spirit is toxic and send those players hatemail for even playing as her.
---
Whatever, I‚Äôm wrong, but you‚Äôre not gonna sit here and say ‚Äúfixable in an hour‚Äù like they bring balance changes, bug fixes or QOL changes in a timely matter. They‚Äôre slow and disappointing.
---
Yes to both of them, I genuinely enjoy being challenged and I've I die/I do bad as killer it let's me think "okay what could I have done differently that might have been better" and if I escape or get the 4k against said 4 man swf, it feels like a accomplishment and that I'm getting better.
---
Gotcha, where can I find your guides? I absolutely love playing him as I think he is the most satisfying killer aside from the hag but have trouble doing good with him. I absolutely love trying to figure out the best way to use his traps and nothing is more satisfying in the game to me than hearing that snap.
---
People hate doctor because of how obnoxious he is + 3-gen doctor being nearly impossible to beat while making the match last forever.
---
This can be said for any killer tbh and hold as much of a point as a pen with no ink
---
I disagree. Sloppy Butcher is hard to see the usefulness because it doesn't directly benefit you, but it definitely hinders survivors. Especially when paired with STBFL, it gives you twice the reason to hit one survivor and switch to another one
---
Aaaah fuck this was great
---
Haha, there's nothing for her to even try and any killer in that situation knows it. She's probably five to seven seconds away from the spot that they are at and they can be 15 to 20 seconds away from that spot before she can ever even get there by just running backwards.
---
I understand what they were doing. It looked like you didn‚Äôt understand how Hag works. Nothing indicated you were being sarcastic at all and that‚Äôs a very believable confused baby player comment
---
*Sweats in wanting more liscensed characters*
---
4v1 enough said.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Face camping or not you can still stack and save the guy.
---
Shit, God forbid a hag player actually uses her the way she's meant to be used. I think they should just remove her from the game.
---
I do the same thing too when my teammates find the hex ruin that has been up for 10+ minutes.
---
First one sounds like censorship to me
---
If you wanna go full nasty, use the... I think the Shackles that give clones collision, and then NOED if you wanna be a dick.
---
Pillar of the community right here
---
Then they get tbagged once and complain about how toxic survivors are
---
It doesn‚Äôt
---
Once every 30 seconds would be ridiculous for a m1 but would be fair against a spirit or billeh. So what would be the right ammount?
---
Very interesting. Do you think most players see her this way? I mean I'm never trying to actively piss anybody off when I play this game but if I'm having fun I'm not overly worried that they're not. And she's definitely one of the more interesting Killers to play.
---
Teamwork like dis :‚Äô)
---
Girl with adreniline you need to get 5 gens done. The killer can prevent that.
---
The most important one I've always wanted was "I'm going for the save", so more than one person doesn't hop off a gen and go to unhook somebody.
---
Auto dict dict
---
Nobody likes a game which is heavily imbalanced, im actually pretty optimistic on the whole balance thing bhvr definetly took steps in the right direction as of recently.
---
Was it an instaheal?
---
As a standalone change? Nope.
---
How it is now: you have an inactive RBT on your head, and you see box auras. You can do gens, or you can go for boxes. In my experience (Pig is my main killer) lots of people go for boxes, giving me time to pressure non-trapped survivors off the gens.
---
With this "buff" you can't see auras, so you will most probably just do the gens.
---
Now, if both buffs are to be implemented... then it's a very biased balance suggestion
---
Trapper just needs 1 More trap
---
For a second I got hyped about playing demo. Guess tf2 is my only choice atm
---
Okay, what if someone did that to you? It wouldn't be fun would it?
---
How often do you get matched up with teams like these? I just made a post about this over on the forums saying how I always get this kind of matchup and never the opposite. Like it's always three players ranked much lower than me and one close to me, never the opposite like one close to me and three players a few ranks higher than me.
---
Its almost like he has a lot of insight about the game or something after thousands of hours, never he exclusively stated that hes better then everyone he said he was good but definetly not the best.
---
You can do this with Insidious already.
---
But this comic in particular is good.
---
Would you use the only medicine to cure your disease if it was created by a Nazi?
---
Man, hearing the original score sounds SO MUCH BETTER than what the game uses
---
"DO A FUCKING GEN! to GET THE FUCK OUT! just somthing nice and polite" LMAO
---
People bring instaheals constatly these days so why cant Otz have the upper hand as well?
---
Rank 6 using noed?
---
Mostly retards play solo survivor. I get 3 bad games per decent game
---
After Sprint Burst*
---
Bill: (Huff, puff) Shit, I think I pulled something, fuck. 
---
LAST GEN GETS COMPLETED* 
---
Bill: Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Eh i try to have fun running ghostface since everyone treats him like a tier 1 killer but he aint
---
While both are dumb, rants at least can lead to discussion. No one gives a shit about your post screen score
---
I don‚Äôt have many perks because i started playing again at the start of the last rank reset so i don‚Äôt have many perks to work with just ghost face and spirt ones once i have my bubba and clown and nurse lvl 40 i can use real builds but for now i have weak perks feelsbadman
---
You wanna link that video? Or you just got baseless claims?
---
That's nice and all, but while it might be significant to you, a single decent match isn't something that needs to flood the sub. When shit like that isn't banned it's basically hourly, same as salty post game chats.
---
Creeper ?
---
Complains about insta heals. Uses Noed.
---
I don‚Äôt have many perks because i started playing again at the start of the last rank reset so i don‚Äôt have many perks to work with just ghost face and spirt ones once i have my bubba and clown and nurse lvl 40 i can use real builds but for now i have weak perks feelsbadman.
---
Lol YT was a good start but I decided it was a big No u for me but my dbd twitch account it 
---
theswiftphil  currently managing the time to try and actually edit my gameplay and make detailed stop and go, edited guides. Rather than teach as I play live.
---
Dunno if that's coincidence or not; But that may be me as the Spirit. A bill did that to me thirty minutes ago on my first match this morning. Same map.
---
I agree to the extent that keys can fuck off from the game, or at least NEVER drop from chests
---
I disagree with changing hatch's conditions though.
---
Xbox?
---
Not a lot of repeat customers I see...
---
Yup, yup.
---
Atm if I see medkits I just play crackbilly and mori people who have instaheals
---
Found the furry owo
---
I agree. Try hereditary it's pretty good
---
Me on the left
---
Keys are better than moris when it comes to pipping though.
---
Mori'ing more than on survivor makes pipping almost impossible.
---
You could have og pennywise costume and new pennywise costume
---
Remove instaheals as well then.
---
Ghostface main here. Myers is fun, but I prefer leaning boi
---
The idea of the little girl add on is to give Huntress a high risk high reward play style. Good Huntress players don‚Äôt tend to get into many loops. Plus, they could make an add on that decreases her total hatchet count but improves her movement speed.
---
Whichever way you‚Äôre looking you need to press the opposite on the asdw (or whatever key binds you have movement set to) if you‚Äôre trying to look behind, start holding W then as you‚Äôre spinning your camera start to turn the opposite keys so looking backwards you‚Äôd need up needing to press ‚ÄúS‚Äù
---
I like to abide this bug, as leatherface I always chainsaw the window right after the surv vault over it( fast vault btw), and magically even after the survivor fully vault it, I just have to hit the window and boom!, They're downed.
---
Words cannot explain how accurate and awesome this is, but numbers sure can.
---
420/69.
---
Just a product of a shitty game
---
What Buckle Up should have been
---
To be continued...
---
You can do something about the key if you have franklins, that's it, no other counters. Thanks devs.
---
what about O.J simpson
---
I mean use it while it lasts, but you have to admit that if you're playing as killer it makes you laugh and feel bad and if you're playing as survivor it just pisses you off.
---
Yeah üòÇüòÇ
---
not so much a shitty game, I love the game. some things are just, "different"
---
I could get behind keys never dropping from chests.
---
If they bring a key, fine. I'd know from the start and be able to adapt to it from the get go
---
I‚Äôm loving the sudden burst of really high quality memes
---
 New survivor: Damian.
---
Damian was cool, but he liked coke and not pepsi. A thick fog emerges around him. The last thing he heard was the Pepsi man theme song.
---
Groovy.
---
Im assuming those percentages are from your own personnal experience, as for other folks including me highly skilled swf which bully are pretty much a regulsr occurence in high ranks. Sorry but the % dont really mean much, highly experienced swf is still a rampant issue in my eyes cause of the insane ammount of organised teamwork not to mention the gen speed.
---
I don't understand this post
---
Yes easy just go against ghost face and beat the shit out of him
---
That would make playing survivor even more efficient in solo queu which will result in less fun for killers in general

Wouldn't role-playing as the killer be killing the survivors? ü§î
---
Fixing your game doesn't generate revenue.
---
He even has theme song
---
lol no. the survivor change would be killer (no pun intended), but don't touch BBQ. either hide in a locker when someone gets picked up or stay within the survivors range.
---
It happens to survivors too, nobody is running an ¬´¬†anti-killer¬†¬ª script lol.
---
What about these sunglasses that makes you see colors ? Does it work or just a bs ?
---
Been following the game since it's release on PC then played the game religiously since release on console. I have pretty much all characters except anything released after Curtain Calls DLC P3 including my killers. I see myself as neutral. I'm calling it how I see it through the years.... The game went down the shitter. A game that had a following of 70k people at anytime playing dramatically dropping to 20k anytime on average..... Something's wrong there.
---
I'm sure Myers will be fine, that man is nigh invinsible
---
Mf I like KILLING not getting looped 2000 times over because sassy mclaggy Claudette wants to run to only the exploitable loops where they can easily see and outmanuever me, with an insta heal ready to pop in her ass.
---
Pretty sure that it is getting reworked in the next patch to have less grind. So yeah this is coming soon\^tm
---
Once someone put "I will enjoy playful times with your mother" into the endgame chat. I couldn't help but laugh.
---
Michael would uppercut that SUMBITCH so hard
---
StoneToss comics are actually great. Never knew about him until now.
---
I don't understand the hate.
---
I prefer this over the year of shitty killers and useless survivors they added. after clown till demo all the killers where super annoying mostly with super annoying good perks, while the survivors got nothing
---
I a 100% agree with this sentiment. I get frustrated for sure, but I'm still enjoying the game and will always thank people for a fun game afterwards. Or even call out whomever schooled me during the game.
---
Sooooo... You want them to 'erf the key because you refuse to use moris?
---
So just balance the game around YOUR game style?
---
I don't think that's gonna happen to be honest...
---
Read the subreddit rules. ‚ÄúOversaturated content‚Äù is one of them, but there‚Äôs also a rule against insulting people. People are allowed to express disappointment and frustration, but if someone is actually being a dick then report their post/comment.
---
*Sips tea* they don't wanna year it tho......
---
tldr. Keep whining.
---
But it would be such a cute pet for Michael to keep and use for chasing survivors
---
well yeah obviously something's wrong with the game, the dev team is small, the community is mainly killer mains, people complain about every possible detail except for things that truly need to be worked on and we're all to blame. we're the last of this dreaded community because the rest got so used to the game being survivor based that when the littlest bit of sympathy was shown towards killers to actually make the game playable for them people left. they left because people hate change. this game is also a very niche community as is.
---
he def should have a mechanic to get traps faster automatically, but i wont lie. i really dont like him tbh, i dont like being scared to vault every window. 
---
Also every teammate i have, even my swf seem to enjoy disarming the traps with their feet.
---
quality
---
It was definitely a purposeful dc as he messaged me each time with "I trolled you guys hard". People are more toxic at night it seems.
---
Most obnoxious skill in the game. 100% needs rework. When I play 3 games in a row against it I just quit for a day or two.
---
NOED helped me tremendously as a baby killer before I had good perks.
---
Without ruin, I used to get run over constantly and teabagged at the gate, so NOED felt like a revenge for that kind of shit.
---
Now that I can do better builds, I hardly even think about NOED anymore. It is a crutch perk for new killers to not get abused so badly that you just want to stop playing killer
---
Why are people crying about hatch so much lately?
---
Can you share the template please?
---
I would love a dread doctor esque killer like the dread doctors from teen wolf. They‚Äôre cool looking and could allow for some amazing cosmetics.
---
They‚Äôre making out üòç
---
what on earth do you mean https://youtu.be/nTkdvou_jqc
---
That‚Äôs the point... ...
---
Does this mean the switch version will stop lagging so much? Like any map can tank in an instant.
---
Haddonfield is a neighborhood. Where the Myers house is. 
---
You might be thinking of Badham Preschool.
---
There should just be a clear indication at the bonfire who is in a SWF. 
---
Let the killer decide if they want to play the game in super hard mode or not.
---
I remember one game where on of the 4 guys had 4 killer detection perks, something which would not be viable in solo, but basically wallhacks for your SWF. As a killer, I should not be forced to go up against that
---
Except you didn't get "played" by a Killer with a Mori, as there is no counter play, beyond not going down twice. However, that can not always be avoided.
---
Keys are the same, there's no reliable counter play. Sure, you could bring Franklin's, but it's a wasted perk slot if no-one brings an item. If you don't Survivors can find keys in chests.
---
At least unzip the jumpsuit and let us see him in a tight undershirt :‚Äô(
---
then he will dc 80% of the game
---
I had not realised this was an option...

At that point i think their just trying to piss off survivors
---
I know a bunch of people have that fear, I'm not trying to be rude but if it's only for your friend it's a bit selfish, yes It would be a cool change but it would be a lot of coding and extra work for the developers.
---
It‚Äôs dropping pallets in chase don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôre not cursed lol
---
Well either 1. They play good in general and got to rank 5+ to camp which is sad. 
---
Or 2. Idiots let the camper win which helps him get to rank 5+.
---
Got a female friend that told me about this issue. She said when the match ends her survivor daily gets replaced by a killer daily.
---
I've always received pretty positive comments post-game when running this build.
---
It's quite a different flavor from your usual game after all :p
---
Try and face your fears and know it‚Äôs a game. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs Samara... oh shit!!! She‚Äôs coming out my tv!
---
I know. There‚Äôs people that derank on purpose to bully lower experienced players. This would make it easier
---
Jesus... Yea what a "Summer" launch that was suppose to be. Lol
---
So you want to 1. Ruin all unique mind games for spirit and 2. Make the wraith completely irrelevant. Got it. Just because a killer is good doesn‚Äôt mean we should nerf it. Imagine they made injured survivors not get a speed boost so they can‚Äôt get a free loop
---
Been clean for 3 months now I just like reading in the Reddit how everybody hates this game. Gives me an incentive not to come back.
---
What am I looking at?
---
I get a huntress feel from it. It looks good I just can‚Äôt figure out who it is.
---
Playing killer is a lonely experience. I like to SWF more. But I've been suggestind a new mode for 2 killers to team up against 8 survivors. I hope they implement this into the game one day.
---
It's only a small team of devs give them a break. They just want to try and make the game the best they can for the community
---
Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire.
---
Literally the one nurse game I watched Otzdarva play he let two survivors leave because they entertained him. That‚Äôs not competitive.
---
They could make it a cosmetics set like how they did it with L4D.
---
Just make BBQ bp bonus default for all killers and keep BBQ aura reading on perk.
---
Actually huntress has the best counter to pallets. You literally bait out the pallet stun and chuck an axe.
---
I mean you can play how you want in any match. Just dont care about winning
---
Careful, all the otzdarva ass lickers are going to downvote you.
---
They both complain too much whenever I've tried watching them. Tru3's complaints mainly come from a competitive perspective where he wants to achieve what the game considers a "win", and Otz from the perspective of a 4Fun Gamer.
---
Boy or girl, the snoot needs boopin'
---
??? then nobody would ever play survivor because they could make double what they would.
---
oh shit there was
---
Is this a real argument that they still use as to why they can't institute more double bp events? 
---
Do BHVR devs know what an economy is?
---
Or just bring in Matthew Lillard as the Shagster.

Meant to be beast of prey lol
---
Ooooh I see it now lol. 
---
It looks ducking great then!
---
I‚Äôve watched tru3 since end of 2016, I love his streams even now. Just because you don‚Äôt like a certain personality doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else doesn‚Äôt, clearly.
---
THAT ONE NIGHT, YOU MADE EVERYTHING ALRIGHT
---
great cosplays
---
Peoples complaints about "gen rushing" isn't so much about the survivors who do gens fast as it is about the devs that still haven't made any changes to the speed at which generators can be completed.
---
Haha thanks, i added a 2nd ear and I freehanded it so it's a sorta different so xD.
---
"skill"
---
He seriously is FUBAR
---
What kinda business model is this
---
how do you know it wasn't a generator ?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been a little confused on where it went
---
soon: killer camping 2 close gate
---
survivor: nub, gate camper
---
Because I was looping the killer for a solid 2 minutes, saw this guy and another survivor‚Äôs auras just standing still and no gens were being done
---
The used above is a P3 Claudette.
---
I have a PHD in using anti-heal Legion
---
Probably removed for balancing
---
It‚Äôs easier said than done for a lot of people. I‚Äôm talking the type of fear that seeing it for a good couple seconds makes your break down.
---
most people with wraith camp.

Thanat still doesn‚Äôt impact much.... I still rather run a different perk.
---
Every time I bring a instaheal before prestiging it's a plague
---
This is amazing
---
I hope BHVR stays away from BBQ
---
It's balanced and I pretty much use it mainly for the 2x BPs
---
The nodding really sold this lol

[Guide: Hitbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddj6nv/guide_hitbox/)
---
Yeahhh... I tried it again on the same killer later that match, it didn't end well for me. Haha.
---
&gt;Complains about insta heals. Uses Noed on an Insta down killer.
---
So he is handicapping himself with 3 perks on a killer that has built in instadown. Shouldn't you be celebrating? Just like when killers equip Thanatophobia thinking it actually does anything.
---
May I ask what the man was spamming? I am curious
---
what should be change is not the hatch mechanic but the ranking system.
---
people do the unfun things for both side because they want to get the pip.
---
this should never happen.
---
like for a survivor, there are unhook farmers. they do it either for BP or pips.
---
the higher your rank, the more you encounter this, which is dumb imo.
---
they are farming you because it reward them or at least they can safe their pips ass rank
---
NOED and excessive camping and tunneling are bad, and this is coming from a killer main. NOED is a terrible crutch perk that rewards awful plays, camping pretty much screws over a person's game and barely gets you anywhere if the team is competent, and tunneling someone to death isn't fun for survivors and makes anyone who is able look at the game from the other side's perspective feel bad (unless of course the survivor is question is acting like a dick).
---
I can't see someone being this positive in this hell hole of a game /s
---
&gt;Or 2. Idiots let the camper win which helps him get to rank 5+ which is sad.
---
Even if you 4k by facecamping one survivor at a time, you won't pip. At the very best scenario, you'll safety pip.
---
This is so well acted i hate it but i love it
---
All survivors are the same in terms of abilities (aside from their teachable perks) and their body size/pain noise/breathing.
---
All killers play differently than each other. The strongest atm would be Spirit, Nurse, Billy, Huntress and Myers (maybe some like Hag and Trapper but they are dependant on the map).
---
These killers are considered Meta because of their powers, allowing for 3 things. These being Map Pressure, Insta Downs and/or Snowballing.
---
Nurse has map pressure and snowballing, Billy has all 3 but can be "looped". Spirit has Pressure and snow ball and effectively can't be looped due to her power. Myers and huntress have snowball potential due to their power usage.
---
Because of how the game is constantly evolving (such as the meta changing with gen rushing), the game is partially balanced. it is 100% better than it was 1 year ago.
---
The DLCs don't really matter for survivor as they are just skins and perks. DLCs for Killer is different, as each killer is unique in their own way with their own playstyle.
---
MM'ing can be busted depending on the time of day, region ect.
---
Power Creep sorta exists, if BHVR releases a busted perk (ex being MoM) the game will become greatly unbalanced. They usually fix it within like a month (lol)
---
It takes time to understand all of the mechanics, the game has a high skill ceiling on both sides.
---
Tier Lists do exist for perks, survivors, killers ect. A simple search on the subreddit would likely find some decent guides to playing both sides.
---
Dweet cosplay looks fresh
---
Why do u even care what people write? 
---
U could just leave the lobby and let them talk to themselves ;). Just hop into the next game :D
---
Came here to say this, the reflection of them recording a screen with their phone camera is so dumb it hurts
---
Solid answer ;) and far more "killerish" like that \^\^
---
&gt;hence why I mentioned lag compensation
---
Your title says hitboxes and your first observation asks about "larger hitboxes". Hitboxes are exactly the same.
---
4. Play only killer yourself, you will never see a clown in your game. (excluding some survivor behaviour makes them look like a clown Kappa)
---
It looks like an enraged rabbit. Still miles away from anything my lazy ass would have done lol
---
Pretty sure a girl can't be a neckbeard.
---
Aren't 2 and 3 the same thing
---
Rocket League has pre-made messages and Psyonix had to start banning people for communication abuse because people still manage to be toxic even without typing.
---
Flood the sub? The sub is flooded with memes and video cuts, ffs, and the other kind of posts are those bashing the devs for trying to do their job.
---
I honestly don't know what's that purely good and interesting content that you aim to find here while purging occasional celebratory posts, really, because all I see is "haha this funny" with almost no discussion about the game itself. In fact, the few threads that try to do that are the ones actively ignored by the community, so...

the first one is clearly a joke..

---
&gt;the first one is clearly a joke..
---
It is hard to know considering this community legitimately believe hitboxes are broken when you are running in a straight line and the killer hits you even if there is a gap in between.
---
Maybe because the game isn't changing? There've been infinite discussions around balance of perks and items and moris. I don't see this magical deep discussion being pulled out that hasn't been discussed in the last few days 10 times over.
---
Wow, really, survivors don't like noed, and killers don't like second chance perks? Oh, you have a bunch of suggestions for buffing underused perks that are equally esoteric or insanely overpowered?
---
Really, tell me what deep thorough discussion isn't being had here, or on the forums on a daily basis.
---
I just checked and got a message saying that it's been set to private by the mods
---
Why the hell would they do that? The couple times I‚Äôve been on it, it‚Äôs been pretty funny.
---
What a hero
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how many people legitimately think perks can be toxic.
---
As a hag main is a lot of fun for me :D
---
I'll kill... you with fire...
---
Some gas... And a lighter...
---
You'll scream... When I say...
---
I'll kill you that way...
---
TELL ME WHY?!
---
The 1st 50 secs highly unnecessary
---
I would actualy buy this!
---
!lock
---
Maybe the other teammates had medkits too, when I'm killer and see 3 or 4 medkits, I switch to plague
---
Sure, i can go without clowns and huntress' iri, sounds fair.
---
Good, I am proud of you.
---
What I'm saying is that the rules for purging the sub make no sense when you argue that they must be enforced to not flood it, because it already is flooded with low quality memes anyways and a real purge won't ever happen because that's basic Reddit interaction.
---
Pretending that this is a place for elevated discussion is just plain stupid: a sub will always be a place to post things that make you happy. Let people keep their postgame screenshots or whatever and keep actual discussion to real threads, not the other way round, and that important info becomes easier to find and everybody's happy.
---
A flock of blendettes.
---
&gt; instead of implementing stuff like Rank Rewards
---
This will never happen because part of the community itself doesn't want it and devs are aware of it. 
---
&gt;putting focus on editing maps that have problematic loops/layouts (god windows mainly)
---
This is already happening, what are you talking about? They just reworked Badham Preeschool (even though they barely touched the buildings) and there is another map rework scheduled for the next mid chapter.
---
When are we getting my boi Jason
---
It promotes camping because killers don't have to be far at all to gain the benefit of the expose status effect. It would guarantee that a hook is either a death sentence or a trade.
---
Xbox 
---
Went from injured to dying state for no reason during EGC, killer wasn‚Äôt on to me.
---
I think it's interesting that NOED is the survivors boogeyman for talking about killers balance  
---
It's really not used very often, can be disarmed by doing an activity that gives you BP and even heal you if you run that Nancy Perk.  
---
Spirit, Nurse, certain add-ons etc are busted, NOED is a fringe issue imo
---
&gt;Every licensed killer after Bubba just has annoying powers tbh.. dont want more of them
---
Pig is fun with a dash power and built in game slowing mechanic (unless RNG trolls you). Demogorgon is awesome to play as.
---
Some people just button tap out of boredom. I know I do. My roommate has a nervous twitch and they do it when I convince them to wait around for the extra points.
---
Soon‚Ñ¢.
---
You are one salty little shitter aren't you?
---
Dude, I had a game with people that found 3 keys with plunderer's and they escaped one by one. Did I get mad? No, it was just a match and I forgot it.
---
Oh? Didn't know Dying Light had a crossover with L4D too. Bill gets around
---
Screw extra points, you‚Äôre just dragging out the game for no reason other then like 50 points.  Waiting in the gates for no reason is ridiculously toxic
---
Maybe controversial but i find Billy to be the most 'balanced' killer. Maybe only at higher ranks though.  
---
I feel like he's strong enough to deal with the meta swf death squads, but in an 'honest' way, unlike Nurse and Spirit. Chainsaw can be played around, he struggles on certain maps, doesn't just ignore game mechanics like Nurse etc.
---
Billy is definitely strong, but i don't feel dirty playing him
---
I doubt it; they said it once and it became a sort of meme. Still annoying they don‚Äôt just give us 2X BP for shit like not having the event on time (yes I know it‚Äôs cuz everything broke with the update, I‚Äôm not salty about it).
---
its on the most recent roadmap plans to add rewards
---
This happens every game for me, managed to get me spotted and hooked a few occasions as well. So it got to the point where if they don't come to me well.......fuck em.
---
nice to see that a leather jacket a grey hoodie and a drawn paperplate is called a cosplay nowadays.
---
Hitting on hook and head shaking doesn‚Äôt help you, it takes up your time as killer and hurts your chances of winning. That toxicity hurts the killer, teabagging in the exit gates is still guaranteed escape.
---
Both are toxic so to me it‚Äôs the same thing
---
Thank you. Yeah, I really am grateful for that Steve and happy that he escaped lol. 
---
I agree. There really isn‚Äôt much you can do tbh but that game kind of ruined it for me and I didn‚Äôt play any more rounds that day. 
---
Honestly this is why facecamping/tunneling/teabagging/being toxic in any way for no reason sucks. It may not seem like a huge deal to some people because it‚Äôs ‚Äòjust a game‚Äô, but it really discourages others from playing and I wish this community could understand that the other people playing are humans as well who have feelings too. 
---
Being a general cuck isn‚Äôt going to help anyone or do anything so I wish people would just stop. But that‚Äôs probably never happening with this community and with most competitive gaming communities with a ‚Äòme vs them‚Äô mentality. 
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk lol.
---
The most recent news on the patch is from last week: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/98653/
---
&gt; To sum up, the team is working very hard to get the issues fixed as soon as possible. Issues like these can be unpredictable, making it difficult to evaluate when they can be fixed. We do not want to rule out the possibility of having the update ready next week.
---
So it might come out sometime this week but it could also take a little longer.
---
Okay, thanks for the help!
---
Yeah they‚Äôre both toxic but the survivors have already won when they teabag in the gates, unless the killers doing it to the last guy on hook he‚Äôs probably going to lose because he‚Äôs wasting time
---
Let me know if you have any criticisms!
---
I mean... I can relate with him. Looking for immersed survivors gets boring really quick and killers that complain about being looped are just new to the game.
---
People really out here still making out like BHVR is just trying to keep the lights when their profits estimates are 50 to 100 million AUD a year. Babe, no.
---
If they're so bad at running, how did they all escape? Great logic people have on this game when they lose. Same happens with survivors. You 4k and you're a "baby killer".
---
Straight cheese.  Hard cheese.  You sound so insanely entitled as a killer in that scenario to deny what you're doing to the slugged survivor using them as a prop as you continue playing your game is selfish and shitty.  That goes beyond simple counterplay.  Counterplay would be growing some balls and simply closing it as the devs intended when they created the EGC hatch mechanic.  I don't care how many jackasses you find to agree with you on this.  You guys are entitled dicks for refusing to admit what you're doing is shitty to the other side.  Play both sides.  Empathize.  It is corny as hell man.  Have respect for your opponents time.  I do and I 4K just fine in my games without resorting to forced slugs.  You're entitled to play your game as long as you choose too while using your defeated opponent as a floor decoration, they have to wait until you show them the grace of ending their game with an eventual hook when you feel like it and fuck them for complaining about it is about the jist of it.  It's mindblowing how incapable of objectivity you guys are on this.
---
How do you loop Myers ?
---
Nope
---
The same way you loop every other killer aside of nurse and spirit.
---
Yeah the sense of entitlement some killer mains have on this is similarly breathtaking to me.
---
Thanks for the input! :D Glad to hear there's a reasonable level of balance here
---
Like?
---
the survivor's perks aren't geared so much for immersion, we were playing boldly, just not looping him for a few gens like he wanted (?)
---
Running around the rosie, window hopping and pallet ?
---
nobody's happy!
---
you complained about toxic survivors then defended face camping. Youre either trolling or biased making ur opinion even more invalid
---
. Face Camping = giving someone no chance to have fun with extremely low chances of being rescued as the game intended ruining the victims  experience overall vs crouching up and down..
---
&gt;the survivor's perks aren't geared so much for immersion, we were playing boldly, just not looping him for a few gens like he wanted (?)
---
Since we can't see the match, I am just judging from his messages. Either you guys were hiding the moment you heard the lullaby or he was just bad at finding people near gens.
---
I actually haven't even leveled Claudette yet.
---
I'm a Tapp main, I find a gen and I tap it.
---
they must have been a new huntress, more missed hatchets than usual at this rank
---
I've got so many basement 4ks from survivors making risky basement unhooks.
---
I main Trapper. There will be so many traps in / around the basement + routes to the basement, you're legit better off cutting your losses and doing gens with the 3 of you. XD
---
You enter my playground, you ain't leaving.
---
*through*
---
The flames would be like the the plague like you have to do a skill check or some thing to put out the fire
---
This is fantastic! Love this video
---
A lot of people 99 it as a counter to blood warden, but when there‚Äôs no one on the ground about the get hooked I agree with you when you say there‚Äôs no point and it‚Äôs annoying
---
mybad mis read you! but yeah idk I honestly use to tea bag while waiting for the killer to come and hit me. Dont you guys get extra points for hitting people atleast I use to think thats what some people did it for? Even then unless a killer is a dick I dont care to "rub it in his face" sometimes you also just need to stall or keep an eye out for the one lost dude and youre bored waiting. Theres many reasons to tea bag than just being toxic. To me it hasnt ever really been to brag. You should try to learn not to care or just understand the fun in it instead of taking such a harmless thing and making it negative. Sometimes I feel like they just wanna say bye xD

---
It‚Äôs not waiting for the other survivor when they‚Äôre both in the gate. That‚Äôs like saying you shouldn‚Äôt care about getting camped or hit on hook, it‚Äôs deliberately to piss someone off.
---
Actually very glad to see I don't need the latest DLCs to be decent at survivor. Also didn't know you could buy DLC content with in-game currency so that's definitely a big plus!
---
Some semblance of a rank system is better than pure randomness, I suppose. As long as I'm not matched with a high rank Killer too early I think I'll be fine. lol 
---
Are perks account-wide or per character? I might get the Huntress  and Halloween DLC if it's the former. 
---
As far as buggy games go, if I survived DayZ, I should be fine here haha. 
---
Thanks so much for the info! Will defs get it at this point. Just a matter of choosing 2 or 3 DLCs to start me off :D
---
Talk about his good relations with OP‚Äôs mother, he will
---
Toxic teabagging bodyblocking baby survs, he will call us
---
Report us, he may
---
Thats actually a cool ability if it weren't for the fact it would be useless against good survivors that know the object locations by heart
---
What do you mean Daphne is usually the distraction? It's always Shaggy and Scoobs that Fred sends in to bait the villain into his traps.
---
They always said something like:
---
"So you're saying we've gotta go in THERE and try to FIND the ghost? Like, I don't think so, man."
---
"Ruh-uh."
---
And then they end up doing it for a Scooby Snack.
---
Daph is the "damsel in distress", but usually not the distraction.
---
Last one should simply say 'playing killer' lmao
---
idk man I think you should waste ur annoyance on something more serious. As a killer ive never really took offense and if I get that one last hit in even better! And like I said are you getting salty cause they want you to get salty? all over a couple seconds and a pointless animation. Seems like ur letting some bs get to u just scare them out laugh it off and start a new game!
---
Then why‚Äôd you complain about facecamping when you could just laugh it off and start a new game? Both take the fun out of the game for the other side
---
Thank you! Glad you enjoyed it!üíï

---
Thank you! I appreciate your comment! :‚Äô3
---
I always wanted to make use of the old left behind in combo with OoO and SS. Almost made it once, but that Billy was smarty pants
---
Hahaha yeah.. I need to.. but video games are my life :D
---
We were totally unaware of him going in behind us and joining in on the nod! We just knew he was going to stalk us but he decided to attack us too. One of the best times on a convention ever! Miss my little squad lots already! :D
---
Happened quite recently, but it hasn't seemed to bother me again because I uninstalled then reinstalled
---
Bruh they should have changed ds to adrenaline and skeleton keys aren't that bad either. Like I would put flashlights in that place
---
I appreciate it!üñ§
---
Hell Yeah ! hahaha
---
Thank you :)
---
He kinda looks like a muppet ? I don't know, he's funny :p
---
just saying but the game came out at the end of september just a few weeks before rank reset and its only been 2 weeks since reset so people might not have gotten high enough ranks yet to have a decent one after reset. plus people are still learning how to play through switch. give it time
---
I made an entire killer concept for him not long ago on here, he‚Äôd be a great killer
---
the vinyl fabric i used specifically was pretty expensive, 25 dollars per yard, and i used about 10 yards in total, but that mostly because i was doing trial and error. you can probably get away with 6-8, dont quote me on that though. Everything you're seeing besides the belts (which are cinch straps), the boots (which are military jungle boots) is vinyl fabric. the black pleather is cheaper, i think it was around 6 per yard or so. hope that helps :) feel free to ask if you need anything else!

Nah my reasoning for hating that killer is that every time i go up against one i get camp every single time
---
Oh wow you definitely wouldn‚Äôt need to! Thank you so much and I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed the little video! :D
---
Hm that‚Äôs odd, it was really annoying when this happened tho because then you‚Äôd have to find the hatch or just accept death, glad it hasn‚Äôt happened in a while
---
Ok, so.. I will be considering doing a pack of this funny killers.. if someone wants to install them.
---
I'll make you updates. &lt;3
---
That‚Äôs really generous of you! You put some hope in the dbd community for me. Thank you for the award and for being such a nice person!üñ§ please keep doing you!
---
Hows your connection? I don't have that issue at all.
---
Ill get shit for this but I gotta say as a killer main I agree.
---
Lately though I've been playing as survivors only to grind out shards for an outfit 
---
And I hate survivors even more
---
I think I have some more funny videos if it‚Äôs interesting enough! ^ ^
---
Then maybe your should direct that towards the people who play Legion. Besides, not all Legion players do that. Most (if not all) of the ones I‚Äôve gone up against didn‚Äôt. Guess you just have bad luck.
---
Or if you have Borrowed, but still that would be a little toxic.
---
What an asshole killer. Glad you teabagged her at the end, that was justice served.
---
Do everybody a favor and delete self care
---
No but the broke match making trying to appease complainers.
---
I demand The Thing, we‚Äôve had serial killers, monsters, dream demons, psychopaths, cannibals, spirits, it‚Äôs about time we get a soulless alien that consumes entire worlds like a living cancer. By far the most dangerous creature to be added, and the idea of the entity panicking and going like ‚Äúshit shit shit fuck‚Äù to contain such a horrible being before it consumes all on Earth  is very amusing and different.

---
Same. Despite killer needing to kill survivors, in reality we all depend on each other for points. Unless we are all really toxic to each other, we all play this game because we like it, and we are human at the end of the day. Small things like this do go a long way
---
‚ù§Ô∏è!
---
May the booty Myers bless the rest of your day
---
Myers and ghosty are stalking eachother
---
The balance team and creative team are two completely different things. I don‚Äôt understand some of this community‚Äôs logic at times
---
Uhmmm, not to be critical, but that‚Äôs not LFD2, it‚Äôs DLC for the game NOT the base game.
---
So if it says LFD2 it‚Äôs talking about those characters, not the ones from LFD, since that‚Äôs simply remastered DLC. 
---
But okay.
---
I am talking about using the key to open the hatch early, not using addons to see auras. Sorry if that was not clear.
---
But a key allows 3 survivors to escape a potential 3 gen situation (in which the killer may have a huge upper hand) just because one of them died.
---
There is literally no counterplay and nothing the killer can do to stop it (outside of majorly tunneling the dude with key, but what if there's 2?) Its not fun and completely sucks as a killer. Especially if you are a killer who is strongest in the mid to late game.
---
I still feel like Trapper is enough of an Homage to Jason. And if we get Voorhees it‚Äôll be Trapper and then Trapper without traps. I‚Äôd love to have him as well though obviously.
---
As i said before survivors get crucified on this sub and ingame if they teabag and rightly so. There are also video compilations or channels such as monto that post killers videos where they get 4ks everygame. Skilled killers or survivors will always get attention as people want to learn. Jukes, Loops, stuns and Blinds are not toxic and is part of the game. Im guessing ur talking about 360s when referring to jukes. Without surviors looping or stunning (lol) this game would be boring asf and killers would get a 4k everygame. Flashlighting at pallets is a ingame feature and is not toxic just annoying. Although it can actually help killers cause the surv isnt running away but anyway. Killer comments on this sub are mainly supported. Dumbass posts of either surv or killer side are rightly downvoted. So yeah you do have to explain this one.

On PC, the DLC comes with the base game, but I have no clue how that works on console.
---
As a survivor main even I hate it when the team stays at the exit gate and teabags the killer. Like seriously is that really necessary? We've already escaped what more do you want? -.-
---
However if the killer was being an a hole the whole game and camped, tunnelled or teabagged then I cant really blame them for teabagging the killer.
---
Because the reality is 97% of the swf that you‚Äôll play against are not as strong or coordinated as you describe them. You really don‚Äôt need powerups or to play super sweaty all the time, and trust me it wasn‚Äôt one mistake that cost you the game.
---
If you‚Äôre dodging swf because you‚Äôre scared or running Moris because you think you‚Äôre not strong enough, then simply put you‚Äôre not strong enough, but that‚Äôs because of you, not because swf is OP. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre bad (not horrible just not as good as you think you are or ought to be) because swf really isn‚Äôt stupid powerful. And you‚Äôll figure that out eventually, and I‚Äôm not being condescending, you literally will eventually get to a point where you know how to chase and pressure and do crowd control and all that good stuff much more efficiently than you currently do, and then you‚Äôll realize swf really isn‚Äôt anything special.
---
Teabagging at the exit gates take up the time of the killer and should be reportable for taking the game hostage and refusing to participate in normal gameplay
---
you gotta wait a longggg time. queus are fucked up and it takes like 3 years to make a lobby as a killer
---
&gt;No one perk should make or break the game. 
---
Hex: Ruin has muted the chat.
---
^I ^want ^them ^all
---
I agree. If the killers toxic it‚Äôs justified, but if not and you‚Äôve already opened the gates the killer is already having a bad time, no need to rub it in.
---
Oh lord, he slappin'
---
Thanks! That's awesome!
---
Exactly.
---
Ah yes I'll be sure to drop the first chase in 5 secs so I can kick those two gens that are almost done. You shouldn't need to run Ruin every match so 2 gens don't pop on the first down
---
Is there anything new other than the 3 weapons though
---
Skill checks are the real killers
---
You know what? I‚Äôd really like to go on and talk about these points you made here and how I disagree with some and agree with other. But you seem very stubborn and trying to change your mind is a waste of time, also you seem unpleasant to talk to so having you agreeing with me is also a questionable achievement. So I‚Äôm gonna let it go and not waste my time. Have a good day.

I wanted to see if it was worth getting Stbfl. Thanks for answering!
---
Head on.
---
Apply directly to the forehead.
---
Yes Haddonfield. You know... Halloween?
---
Stbfl is one of the best perks in the game. Definitely worth it.
---
No I still meant open hatch. Like i dont know if it's just me but I never find hatch when it's closed. Because you can never hear it it's extremely hard to find and can stay pretty hidden even if it's closed. Plus I never meet any toxic survivors with keys so if it's just me who thinks keys aren't toxic then I'm sorry for your bad experiences :/
---
They do you get 0
---
Cospobre √© a alma do BR
---
Then don't complain about gens being done so fast, killers have a lot of ways to prevent gens being done fast or slow down the game in other ways and if you can not see that you're either very inexperienced in the game or just blind. 
---
Don't get me wrong, higher rank swf teams make me lose my sanity too sometimes but in general I think the game is fine as a killer. You can't ALWAYS win or expect to always win because then there wouldn't be any survivors anymore.
---
Nothing gets your killer to tunnel you more then when mettle of man activates and you take another injured hit before going down
---
Git gud
---
Lobby times have been awful. I wiggled my way up to rank 9 on Switch. Been waiting at least ~30-40 minutes for a game lobby. To play as killer or survivor.
---
It is living hell.
---
I feel attacked.
---
Where‚Äôd you get the jacket if you don‚Äôt mind me asking
---
I just uninstalled it and reinstalled it, hopefully it works later!
---
I can see Accidents Happen being a meta perk in solo que, and honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt complain.
---
I feel like literally every game I face Ruin, Thanatophobia, BBQ and Chili, and NOED.
---
I love the bug. I‚Äôll have an escape daily and then a nurse blink daily (I‚Äôm on Xbox) and after completing the survivor daily the nurse daily changes saving me the pain of trying to learn how to blink. Win win üòé‚úä

---

---
Good work lad!
---
i got spine chills from this
---
I don't understand.
---
&gt;Yeah because the killer should have to just wait while all 4 survivors just stand in the gates because they want to mock the killer. 
---
That is what you are advocating not me. If you hit them then they leave and you don't wait any time.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm not giving them any bonus points, 
---
You give them points by playing the game. They give you points by playing the game. There are more points to be gained from you at the end of the game by getting extra hits in or even catching one of them. The only person telling you the game is over is you.
---
&gt;and if I see them teabagging I often consider DCing to make them lose points.
---
DCing is even more toxic - and whilst you made some good points initially. In these last few replies you have made it clear that you are quite a spiteful player. This could all be over in seconds, but you refuse to play the game. And are so upset that you have lost that you want to DC to make sure they get as little points as possible?
---
My advice. just relax. learn from your mistakes. Don't let them get you angry. And if you don't want your time wasted finish the game instead of refusing to play and letting ECG run down.
---
Hold on we have a rule book?
---
I prefer usong just his perks,in addition to that I use We'll make it,I play the game "the sacrifice" way...
---
*Beep*
---
I never said that. I feel like it's more of a general balance issue than an issue with play style. If they need to nerf moris then they can.
---
If they wanted their escape points they should have left. The game is over when they‚Äôre all in the exit gates with a guaranteed escape so if they refuse to leave I‚Äôll leave the game
---
He didn't body block right, smh
---
Well I prefer to not be a cunt so I don't lobby dodge.
---
Yeah gotta agree with you, but about the tunneling and camping, do you consider it bad if all the survivors are focused solely on rescuing the hook victim and not doing any gens or totems nearby, but instead hiding behind foliage waiting for the killer to go away despite said killer knowing they are there? Genuine question, no rude intentions good sir.
---
Honestly more of a key issue. In my tilt I blamed the hatch but the key was more of the issue
---
?
---
W is not the only key to move
---
You also have A for going left, D for going right and S for going back. You can also combine for example W and D to go diagonally.
---
You are limited to those 8 directions relative to your camera
---
Fair enough, I can see what your thinking ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù
---
Feng turn around Michael‚Äôs behind you- oh no she‚Äôs wearing earbuds she can‚Äôt hear us oh god oh fuck.
---
I just go full on sarcastic on that type of players. "Oh no! Did i camp? Oh i am -so- sorry about that. I should have read the survivors guidebook for killers. Sorry sorry. Do you want me to get your baby bottle?"
---
After you've been unhooked, if you go into a locker, the killer will (probably) avoid taking you out because they'll assume you have Decisive Strike.
---
Yeah.... and???? Who cares what perks ya use.
---
&gt;Why wouldn‚Äôt you want rank rewards?
---
Multiple reasons. I am sure you can find a very detailed answer if you just search for a thread regarding rank rewards since this is a very old subject.
---
I do face a good amount of Sloppy Butchers too, usually swapping out the NOED. Luckily NOED isn't as popular at purple/red ranks because most killers don't need the endgame mop-up. I don't think I've faced a PGTW in like 20 games. I like that perk a lot though when I play killer
---
Knock Out makes downed person's aura not show up unless you're close
---
Third Seal makes so the person hit doesn't see any auras
---
so no, it's not "the same but better". You have to hit everyone at least once for it to be "the same but better"
---
There are quite a few new survivor scoring events in the next update
---
IF he cared at all
---
Thanks : )

Hello all, I hope you enjoyed my concept of The Thing. I know many do not desire a mimic killer, as it would not work, so I tried to come up with something that still works thematically for The Thing. [I would love to see this horror from hell in the game one day!](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71F5K5%2BgOjL._SL1500_.jpg)
---
it goes like this
---
imagine playing killer, getting 10k, having 3 BBQ stacks, 2 BPS being used and it being a bloodhunt
---
It's 10k \* \[1(base) + 3\*0.25(BBQ) + 2(BPS) + 1(bloodhunt)\] = 10K\*4.75= 47500
---
without bloodhunt, it'd be 37500
---
Here is a minor question. Do you accept camping if the following scenario occurs?
---
All unhooked survivors attempt to rescue the hook victim before the killer has a chance to leave, and the killer know they are hiding very very close. This means the only thing the killer can do is attack them, but that would eliminate his advantage (having a survivor on hook and all other survivors are not doing gens or totems, but waiting for an opportunity to rescue) and, if their skill is not good enough, fail a chase wth their new target.
---
Genuine question, no rude intentions. Felt I should mention that as it might come off as rude.
---
You know it
---
I legit can't think of anyway I'd improve him. He has lots of fun builds and strats. Bloody coil &amp; honing stone is a personal favourite for maximum carnage.
---
Always a big fan of one of the sacks and speed set up add-ons if you fancy a blitzkrieg set up phase.
---
Iridescent stone and tar bottle if you want the most random trap placement + captures known to man. No one knows where the traps are set, not even the Trapper! Haha.
---
Banning memes won't make these posts get posted much more.
---
But I was angry yesterday and it‚Äôs not good to hold in your anger
---
I've never once thought this as a killer main. I literally just assume every survivor has d-strike all the time.
---
However if the key is a counter to moris as you say it is, then it would be fair to assume if they nerf moris as well as change the key, then it would be fair. I never said moris were balanced. If anything I believe they're unfair. So if moris were less powerful then it would be safe to nerf the key. The risk is up to the survivor but with the key it's high risk but unfairly high reward. If the keys had more usage other than just for unlocking the Hatch like I said, then maybe they wouldn't be such a waste to bring.
---
Personally, i'd love to have Jason (The Drowned) and his ability could be something along the lines of water control since he, ya know. Drowned. (Even though in Jason vs Freddy he APPARENTLY is afraid of water which is total bs) and hes mori could be just creating a hole of water and grabbing onto the survivor to drown with him. Would be cool.
---
Look further down explain how I‚Äôm a fucking idiot
---
Well I want points but I won‚Äôt crouch spam unless it‚Äôs to mess around as I wait for others just in case they get to the exit wounded just within reach of me taking a hit for them.
---
If it‚Äôs not to take a hit it‚Äôs for extra points.
---

The only reason people say Legion is bad is because people legit don‚Äôt know how to play him. Red ranks with Legion and I don‚Äôt use Ruin and sometimes I don‚Äôt use add-ons either. It‚Äôs all about gen-control and strategy.
---
This is why Huntress‚Äôs run iridescent head with the belt.
---
Wraith has good map pressure as he‚Äôs invisible and fast with add ons the problem with wraith is his chase
---
They also changed the killer pick-up animations multiple times
---
Lmao you haven't addressed any of the points I have made and now look at what you are left with...
---
Leigon still looks the same
---
Waiting in the gate while everyone is safe is still essentially holding the game hostage so I think you and anyone who stays in the gate when everyone is safe just to stay there to mock or for a few extra points should be banned
---
From my experience very rarely do hook rescues happen in endgame unless it‚Äôs near a gate or both the rescuer and hook victim get caught by collapse anyway
---
STOP! BITCH *STOP!!*
---
*STOOOOOOOOO‚Äî*
---
ahh. ok gotcha. I probably will get the Halloween DLC then. Definitely wouldn't mind a good perk to start with given the grind/randomness. 
---
Thanks so much for the help! :D
---
You write a damn thesis every reply I‚Äôm obviously not gonna reply to literally everything. I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to force the survivors to play the game and leave just so they can get more points and belittle me

---
Most of killers assume it, that's why it use to work. Act as if you have decisive, and the killer will believe it.
---
PD: When i say you go into a locker is making it obvious, jumping in loudly in his face, that's what tricks the killer.
---
But like kindred is getting buffed to counter stealth camping, right?
---
ahah no problem, I don't take it seriously ;)
---
But yeah video games for life !
---
I didn't I had such a power in my hand !
---
The issue about Thanato is that it's inconsistent while the value's are too low.
---
You need some time in the beginning of the match to get it stacked. Legion is probably the fastest to do so, even when Plague might be more consistent when you face Survivors that actually heal.
---
But as already mentioned, it needs some time to get going, while the values are still hillariously low even WHEN you have 4 Survivors injured. 16 % of a gen equal 12,4 seconds. In the case of sabo and healing it's not even worth mentioning what it does. Sure, when you've lots of pressure and roaming capabillity, Thanato could actually help you to apply pressure and keep gens from being done. But this is something neither Plague or Legion have.
---
And even then, Thanato still loses stacks everytime you sacrifice of kill a Survivor. Meaning that you're literally being punished for doing your objective. Which becomes even worse once you realise that you have to keep all 4 Survivors in the game for Thanato to bloom.
---
So yeah, in order for Thanato to work you literally need a Killer that has a easy time to bounce between Survivors while also doesn't necessarily struggle with handling 4 Survivors at once 24/7. Meaning literally none but Nurse maybe. Or a Freddy who goes for the absolute slowdown, even when I'm not sure if there might be better perks in that regard.
---
Honestly, Dying Light is just a better Thanato as it doesn't stop to scale at some point and reaches a higher climax.
---
Believe it or not, it works like a charm (red ranks at least).
---

Actually I‚Äôve been finding a fair amount out of sprint burst being able to get to any loop on the map is useful (but your going to have to. Know the best loops and where they are

I‚Äôm a dude wtf
---
Yeah, I derfed with the inking so his mouth is all kinds of fucky (kinda like our update but whatever)

Sadly, no.

Like Oblivious not letting BT work, even though you can SEE Freddy RIGHT THERE GODDAMMIT.

She was camped for ages
---
It‚Äôs usually better to use the shards to buy perks you already have.  Take that BP and invest it in the character with the perk you want.

The doodle‚Äôs ability is: the eraser- where he can make wholes in the ground at any part of the map, and if a survivor falls into it, they are stuck inside of it for the rest of the game

---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my experience is ruined.
---
Sprint burst is good. But any perk that requires you to walk/crouch around most of the map in an effort to save your speed for a chase takes it from amazing to just good. 
---
You need that speed when you need it. But if its immensely slowing you down it's mildly a detriment. All of the other exhaustion perks are superior.
---
It really be that way sometimes.
---
[me when it‚Äôs blurred out still](https://imgur.com/a/Q9wwZbO)
---
To be fair it‚Äôs not like I brought a mori. I had to get the 5 stacks and keep the totem up.
---
Learn to use it better
---
&gt;The game is over when everyone is in the gates, about to escape when you down them.
---
The game isn't over till they have left the gates. Survivors and killers alike will tell you many stories about how they have snatched cocky survivors from the jaws of victory.
---
If they don't leave. They die and don't get escape points. Simple. You are the one refusing to do anything about it. As stated over and over again - that, in isolation, has nothing to do with being toxic. Choose your argument, it is one or the other.
---
I've never justified toxcitiy I simply stated that camping is a worse level of toxicity? Remember - that's how this conversation started.
---
You are just saying now that it makes you unable to finish the game. And are trying to justify DCing - laughable.
---
And the rest of this skin??
---
This game needs an operation health recoding from the ground up with skilled coders this time.  Every patch with these guys is a spaghetti mess of problems.  Sound still sucks scratches get fucked,  bugs and bugs every patch. Worked for rainbow 6 and that game is played like crazy now.. fix this shit mess
---
This is fair. The key is the more glaring issue here not the hatch
---
I just want the uncenaored pic.
---
There would be nonstop crying from survivors but since I play killer I can just fuck myself I guess.
---
Truth
---
I don't find this to be the case at all. Save your shards for perks locked behind pay DLC. You can accumulate 150k BP in a short amount of time. But getting able to skip a survivors/killers first 2 shitty perks and immediately grab their level 40 perk can be priceless.
---
 Very soon the tides will turn, and OoO Survivors will get screwed by stealth killers up good. From then on stealth killers will be able to see survivor's auras, while survs themself won't see shit.
---
 That's a payback for all years of bullying stealth killers. Soon we will be the ones laughing.. 
---
 Stealth killer mains REJOICE!!! Our time is coming!!!
---
[me when I don‚Äôt have the uncensored pic](https://imgur.com/a/Q9wwZbO)
---
Overall, the duration of the Undetectable Status and lots of his Add-Ons are sort of a joke.
---
The Undetectable duration is 2 seconds, while the Rare Shroom increases it by 0.5 and the Very Rare one by 1 seconds. Except for Red Moss there's more or less no way to go for some sort of assault focused build, which's kinda sad in my opinion. Would've fitted to some otherworldly predator as the demo is.
---
Overall, the abillity of the Demo is neat, but looots of his numbers need some proper adjustments. Even his power, why does it have just 14 seconds cooldown? It's already so damn low that the Add-Ons that would decrease don't even have a purpose unless you really don't think about your own decisions.
---
Yeah everyone running pgtw, ruin and bbq nowadays
---
No idea... Was looking forward to it last week.  I had a full week window to give it my all.  The Battlefield 5 update is out in Thursday, my other favorite game,  now I'll be torn between the two when the Archives arrive :\
---
spirit main , yikes
---
or most people think he camps, after he has patrolled the gens hit someone and still no one comes for the hook
---
Cheers mr grammar nazi.
---
They have to. Gens fly by so quickly if you don't run Ruin and something like Pop. 
---
Bbq is just great at farming. It feels so much better to get 60k BP instead of 30K especially if you are a newer player and need to level up bloodwebs...this game has so many characters now.

Yes, this is acceptable like I said before.

Well I appreciate your empathy instead of just blaming me like I got outplayed. When I play survivor I don‚Äôt use keys either just like I don‚Äôt use ebony moris on killer.
---
Bill is the last vestige of Valve's days as a game dev team, gotta bandy him around as much as they can.
---
Yes make huntress 115 that is the only change I‚Äôve been wanting for awhile now

Every red rank Plague build. The other would be Pop goes the weasel or BBQ.

Sure, but that‚Äôs different from being injured. At least it is for me. I never injure anyone before breaking them.
---
Damn Hag's phantasm would be scarier with the Googly Eyes add on!
---
It can, but very rarely does. And leaving the door area after opening it 99 is nothing short of stupidity.
---
I completely know how you feel in the 3 gen scenario. You got the perfect game- stuff set up and everything. Then you get key'd and you're sitting there with a clown mask on because the survivors decided to be like that.
---
Yeah, they gotta survive, but keys suck ass
---
I agree, but as a survivor when a killer DC's it's game over (obviously).  I think 10 for survivor 15 killer is cool.  I cannot stand either tbh, outside of instakill perks.
---
Sorry for wanting a Halloween event during Halloween.

i never said they were trying to keep the lights on. I said its their profit. Walmarts doing great huh? guess they should stop selling stuff for a month or so because they can afford to pay the bills while their not open. BHVR is a company, they run on money, thats not gonna change, doesnt mean they put more effort into their cosmetics than the game itself. 
---
re read my statement and tell me where i said they were struggling. all I said is their income is what keeps their operations running. BHVR is a large company with more than just DBD under their belt, I get that.
---
I will not be doing the P3 outfit, just default.
---
Why is tryhard a bad thing? Also aren't you a tryhard by calling someone else a tryhard? Otherwise why do you care?
---
I've got a chainsaw phobia too. So if you could have Billy come at me with say a leaf blower, that would be greeeaat.
---
That may be true, but ive been using it for around 50 or so hours and havent had a problem. I even keep all my productivity scripts open while I play and its never caused issue. Though YMMV I guess.

Nothing like bringing BPStreamers and three people DC in under two minutes.
---
They should punish the farmer.  Tunnel them, face camp IDGAF but nah punishing someone for getting unhooked at the wrong time makes killers look like bitches.  Slug them and use as bait or move on.
---
Then keep doing it, one extra hit isnt the end of the world.
---
I disagree for killers that leave after the totem being schwacked. Its actually hilarious seeing it
---
I really like this! How did you do the mask?
---
Shut up, you‚Äôre justifying this toxic bs that pushes people away from playing killer and dbd in general.
---
It is spiteful toxicity, all toxicity is spiteful
---
I literally CANNOT kill them because if I down them they instantly fall out of the gate and get more points THEY DONT DESERVE because they‚Äôre toxic.
---
If it wasn‚Äôt their plan to leave at the last second they‚Äôd have left when the gates are open at earliest and when all the survivors were in the door at latest, otherwise they‚Äôre just being aholes to the killer for no reason.
---
You‚Äôve won the game if all survivors are at the gate teabagging, you don‚Äôt need a f-Ing victory lap. How is it strategy to bm like a pos?

You get a notification that I'm running We'll Make It for god sakes! LET ME HELP YOU!
---
Kindred is actually pretty good in the new player ranks for making sure you survive until the end. They're a lot more likely to come save you when they can obviously see that no one else is and/or where a teammate is getting chased.

I wasn't whining about instas. I agree they aren't a very big deal. Annoying but whatever.
---
I was just saying Franklin's doesn't counter them. You said they did. That was all.
---
Firstly, do you have any precise statistics that most SWF are bad? And even so, it doesn't matter how far from perfect players in SWF are, because they still would have a lot of extra advantage against killers from the same skill bracket. Compare escape rates of survivors in SWFs and in solo queue and you will see that SWF tend to escape far more often then Solo players. 
---
Secondly, do you really call me bad because I say that I try to avoid negative experience in game? Because facing SWFs is purely negative experience and even victory barely justifies your efforts and negative emotions during the game. I am a rank 1 player, who has more than 2000 hrs in this game and I played since beta. I know what this game used to be and I see that SWFs remained untouched since 2016. Playing against good solo players takes a lot of skill and concentration. But when you play against same good players, but they now use voice comms everything changes dramatically. You can't just defeat them by being "Good". You mustn't make any mistakes. You must hope that they will make at least one mistake which you should fully against them. This all is true when survivors aren't using special perks and items that can nullify such mistakes. Dead hard allows to be more careless during chases, as you can always dodge a hit or "dead hard for distance" if you mess up. Decisive strike allows survivors to do unsafe unhooks against any killer. Adrenaline, which isn't strong perk in solo matchmaking, becoming OP when used by SWF, as they have coordination and can pop the last gen to activate adrenaline when needed. Head On's true potential is unleashed in SWF, when they tell in which locker they are to help their teammate lead killer to it to prolong chases. This list can go on and on, but I think you get the idea. Now keep in mind, that SWFs can run 4 of each these perks. Playing against it is a fucking nightmare for anyone like me, who doesn't main Spirit or Nurse. 
---
SWF is a huge problem and something must be done about this. Survivors get strong advantage by using voice comms and killers can't do anything about this.
---
 Someone`s said, that playing in SWF is like having OoO, Bond, Kindred by default. Survivors get so much information, that some killers' powers get useless: trapper, nightmare's pallets, hag, ghostface. 
---
Do you think it is fair to keep things as they are just because some noobs can't win without this? It is like saying spirit shouldn't be nerfed because some people are bad at her. Same with SWFs. Some people are bad even with voice comms, others understand what advantage they get and use it to win games.
---
Imagine being your teammates who did the gens and want to reward you with saving and butt rubs, but instead sunndenly you're gone and all 3 of us are 10 feet from the killer.
---
Don't DC.
---
Thats the one I thought people wouldnt like as well xD
---
That's it exactly. I'm not bothered by the fact they survived. Good for them. I'm bothered by how it happened.
---
You're complaining about Self Care?  I understand you're probably as new to the game as I am or more (I only started playing earlier this year)
---
You do realize that Self Care was actually nerfed right?  It used to be stronger.
---
Besides, in my opinion, Inner Strength is way better.  So is current Pharmacy.  And current instant heals. 
---
So don't make bait posts.
---
Awesome
---
If they could get all of those other licenses, there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôll fail to get his. It‚Äôs free press for both parties.
---
Mm yes legion
---
If the gates are open and a killer has a survivor on the hook he's getting camped, you as a killer main know this is true. The minute you walk away they are unhooking and all escaping. Stay at the hook in this situation usually results in multiple sacrifices rather than the one.  I hook in leave the entire game just to stack the blood points but would camp in this situation knowing SWF are not going to leave them on the hook.  Like I said about the original post It was a great escape and really cool until the disrespect.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs fair, just frustrating lol. I want my max survival points from that kobe yo.
---
Who tf are the 7 people that voted Ghostface?
---
Just a heads up. If you guys download this to upload it elsewhere then I‚Äôd appreciate if you‚Äôd credit all of us who was in the making of this video. I don‚Äôt like seeing my stuff on other pages without getting any credits and people pretending to be me :(
---
There‚Äôs a specific twitter account who‚Äôs dedicated to try to impersonate me. She‚Äôs also taken private photos and videos of me and claimed she‚Äôs deaf and trying to trick people off their money using my face and cosplays. Please don‚Äôt let me experience that again if you guys are gonna post this elsewhere :(
---
It's hilarious except that it's a total waste of my time
---
Not my fault that the killer sucks so much they can't even FIND a survivor before their ruin is broken lol (mind you the ruin spawn was really good, and we finished 2 generators before I even found it)
---
Me when lead pipe Myers finally comes out
---
Ya but every person who has played DBD a lot complains. I doubt there isn‚Äôt a single DBD streamer or content creator who doesn‚Äôt go into rants about balance and game mechanics in this game. I just don‚Äôt like this perceived idea people have where Otz is this guy who never gets mad at anything and is all smiles. He is a very nice guy and his humor is great but if you actually watch his streams you would see that he complains just as much as tru3 with only real difference being that tru tries to go into depth with his complaints and tries to explain how he would balance the game and Otz is just about saying how something is annoying and should be changed. I just wish these posts would stop making it seem like Otz is this pure hearted being of goodness, and tru is this negative Nancy who does nothing but complain and how his balance talk is all just killer sided stuff to make the game unfair to survivors.
---
Sorry, yes, killer.
---
I'll go the Deng Min this time I reckon.
---
Sure thing, pal-o! See ya tomorrow!

not really the same in terms of pain noise/breathing you can't compare ace pain noise with Ash or Bill who are loud AF

You‚Äôre acting stupid now. I‚Äôm not looking for jokes
---
BT should just trigger if killer is X meter from hook while unhooking tbh.
---
Babadook is an awesome movie.  especially more so if you have to luck to watch it without any expectations, like i did.

---
Why cant yall just play the game with the things it has?? Anything that someone doesn't like has to be nerfed? No, just find a way around it bruh
---
That's a great idea. And then we can make the killers take a turn each round, place a pasture on a cattle tile and THEN WE'RE PLAYING FUCKING CIV.
---
First of stop being a triggered little bitch, STBFL shortens weapon wiping grime. Therefore makes the perk weaker if during that time it actually does something. Can‚Äôt believe I have to explain this to some 12 yr old console player
---
But again, who cares about more pips when pips are meaningless?
---
Thanks again, you're doing gods work
---
You teabag and point at the edge of the exit 100 percent. I don't think I've ever seen somebody try to justify BMing at the exit so hard. This is coming from somebody that plays both.
---
Yes please!

It‚Äôs more of for the competitive side of the game , people are complain why either sides become full on try hard and not let other people have a casual game , if what I saw is done or something similar it‚Äôll satisfy both sides

Honestly I don't think it's the clickbait. He actually puts out content. Daily. Constantly. I can't find anyone else who is so consistent.

YMMV?

Draw The Huntress doing her Mori on a survivor.

I mean... I did in fact google it and edit my original comment before you even responded. Maybe you should read before insulting people.
---
Yesterday a p3 Quinten ran towards me after an unhook, and jumped into a locker....I sat and stared at it for 1 min. I baited the head on (which he had) and I downed him. Proceeded to kill him. I am not scared to stare at your dumbass and wait 1 min. I will sacrifice 3 gens if it means killing your attention grabbing dumbass. Don't try me you Gollum looking piece of trash.
---
I digress. Sorry.
---
I hate the Doctor with the fury of a thousand suns. Spirit, eh, I don‚Äôt have a whole lot of beef with (probably cause I play her a lot and I have only gone against her maybe five times), but that bitch can fuck off with his insanity. I suck at looping so my only choice is stealth, and the moment I hear his terror radius I have to panic to find a locker so I won‚Äôt scream ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here, come hook me!‚Äù.
---
A game that is active for 3 yrs now, the game mechanics which is being followed for so many years is silly for you interesting thought right there. You saying devs made a mistake for such a game mechanics for that long and didn't bother to change it? :o
---
Because Killers have a LOT to do in a very limited amount of time. Insta-heals waste much of that time.
---
I'll do it soon ;)

I've experienced that despite my name is "I need healing" some people won't heal me, even if we're not working on gen or anything, no killer nearby/looking my direction :(
---
not reading it made you look so dumb lol
---
I play both and I don't mock the killer. If you read back you'll see what the original discussion is.
---
The point I was making was that camping is a worse level than celebrating and mocking at the exit gates - even though both are bad.
---
It is the OP who has drawn this out to whatever this conversation has become. If you read through I think it is perfectly clear where I stand.
---
I prefer supporting the dev team and own all the dlc.  I regret purchasing perks with shards.  In the long run it was simply a waste.
---
I‚Äôm currently working towards all perks on all killers.  I‚Äôll keep 8k shards banked for the next chapter, otherwise I‚Äôm focused on BP to reach my goals.
---
Quality mindgames
---
&gt;Currently rank 9
---
I'm not looking to be condescending, but take this from a red rank perspective then;
---
If someone got unhooked and has DS, the best option is to slug then and move on. By slugging, you take 2 people off gens (The guy needs to recover himself, and someone else has to come save him).
---
However, if the person who just got unhooked with DS runs into a locker, you CANT slug them. The only option is to interact with the locker, which forces the DS animation to begin. This is why survivors run into lockers in front of killers - it's a whole minute of invulnerability. 
---
In order to avoid the stun, many killers just decide to ignore the locker and chase someone else. It's what I do and it's most effective in saving time.
---
Yourself*, yeah I‚Äôm sure I did.
---
The spirit (rin) is the 'best' to buy and also has haunted ground. But the plague is the most fun to play imo.
---
If you play killer you should buy spirit (ghost lady) if you play survivor you should buy stranger things chapter for Nancy (her perks are awesome)
---
Why would you be glad about that? So you can continue feeling superior about your opinion?
---
There was a video I saw that talked about a way for Pennywise to work lore wise. Since they defeated him by believing they could (at least from how they explained it in the video, sounds cliche as hell but oh well), the person said that the entity would probably know this and manipulate Pennywise into doing his bidding. I don‚Äôt remember what video, but if I find it, I‚Äôll link it.
---
I'm the same rank but still find it fast.
---
no problem :)
---
Twilight flashbacks?
---
good response bro, keep trying to trick people into not cleansing on reddit so you can have ez games
---
It's called a spear.
---
Yes
---
‚ÄúListen here you little shit, I‚Äôm Michael fucking Myers. My franchise is the only horror franchise to have survived since the 70s. You came from a Netflix show and haven‚Äôt achieved even an iota of the success that I have. I built modern horror, survived gunshots, took down loads of people, survived getting blown up twice, once by dynamite and once by a gas leak being ignited. I‚Äôve been hit by cars, and survived two remakes, while you got killed by a bald chick with psychic powers, and got your ass whooped by a bunch of kids. My rivalry is legendary. I am legendary. My theme song is iconic enough that all you need to hear is the mention of it to know what‚Äôs up. You fought against, and died to, a bunch of kids. Your theme isn‚Äôt even your own. I‚Äôm one of a kind and pure fucking evil. You? You‚Äôre replaceable, so get your flower lookin mouth off me, or so help me Entity, I will fucking rip them off and punt your ass all the way to Stranger Things. I‚Äôm Michael fucking Myers, bitch. Compared to me? You are nothing.‚Äù
---
Interesting information. Cheers. Yeah, haven't been red rank in a while. Interesting to know.
---
Slug it is I guess haha.
---
I think the meta's gonna shift the way you play. Up to a certain rank I think it's better to not cleanse, but after that (maybe around purple ranks? who knows) the killer's gonna be good enough to kill a bunch of injured survivors quick enough to not give anyone time to finish generators.
---
I think it's down to how confident you are in a chase. I know people who can run circles around a corrupt purge plague and they'll cleanse like crazy, but you also have to keep in mind how often the plague you play against uses corrupt purge. Even if you cleanse does she power up right away? If not, you have a limited amount of times you can heal up, which can hurt you in the long run.
---
It's situational. Sometimes it's good to cleanse but sometimes it's not
---
could you explain why or is it because thats the popular opinion
---
I mean it did. Basically this.
---
OP: I don't wanna hear that machine gun huntress crap
---
You: I'm not reading that.
---
Also You: MACHINE GUN HUTRESS
---
Weird, I do play early morning mostly on the weekends. That is usually when I working on killer dailies. Wonder if the time has a major impact. Oh well.
---
Think about this with your little brain, if you don‚Äôt cleanse, she has no power at all. You‚Äôre just injured in a chase. You cleanse, she turns into a faster huntress with insane hatches basically. Think what you want
---
Well, that's a lot of value, specially if you don't have Head On or DS.
---
I know many survivors who tbag and point are the exit to encourage killers to hit them out because it gives the killers more BPs for the end of the match. Not saying this is always the case but just what I have experienced. It‚Äôs not always BM.
---
&gt;Shut up, you‚Äôre justifying this toxic bs that pushes people away from playing killer and dbd in general.
---
Aw don't get mad. I'm not justifying anything. Both are bad. but you believe what ever you want to help you sleep at night.
---
You asked, why is it seen worse? I told you. You start acting like a child.
---
Again. You can find all your answered to the questions above. What you do with that is up to you.
---
You complain about a 'thesis' when I answer your questions. Completely ignore it. Then ask the same questions.
---
Dbd isnt missing :/ its even 10$
---
Thanks, i consider myself an amateur artist
---
Man I don't know how they still haven't recovered their original visuals from when they updated the engine for the legion update. Also 4K ui has broken scaling since plague update.
---
Nah, I would never get tired of these, keep em coming
---
read my post you fat boomer ive already adressed both of these points, they dont mean anything
---
Everyone will tell you never to cleanse, but they're wrong.
---
1. Cleanse when the game is almost over.
---
    If she doesn't have the time to benefit from Corrupt Purge, it's like it doesn't matter.
---
2. Cleanse when the pool is across the map from where you all are working on generators.
---
    The time she takes to go get the pool and then walk back is wasted time for the killer.
---
3. Cleanse when the Plague has the add-on that shows auras of vomiting survivors.
---
    Cleansing is better that always being revealed.
---
4. Cleanse when all survivors cleanse.
---
    This one is important. The basic premise is to either all be broken or all cleanse. As long as you stick to one or the other, things are going to be alright. But if you have some broken, while the Killer gets her machine gun vomit, there'll be issues.
---
If you're not hitting one of those 4 reasons, you shouldn't cleanse.
---
Hello fellow human from Czechia
---
Okay so this is like saying. ‚ÄúPrayer beads spirit is impossible to counter as you can‚Äôt hear phase noise‚Äù okay but that doesn‚Äôt matter it doesn‚Äôt mean anything. You can‚Äôt completely deny a point with no actual reasoning. If you can‚Äôt loop a killer whilst injured that‚Äôs a sign to get good
---
Took a hit too. What a team player
---
When I play survivor I judge it on how well the plague can hit me with the vomit. If I'm able to dodge it decently I'll cleanse. 
---
When I play plague I love survivors that don't cleanse. Gimme them 1 hit downs.
---
Thank you, love the design of Adiris tbh so it‚Äôs really hard for me to pick!
---
I agree. Teabagging is used for all kinds of communication. I often let the killer get a last hit by slowly walking towards them while crouching.
---
But in fairness we are specifically talking about when survivors are clearly and deliberately mocking the killer - which isn't right. But also isn't the end of the world like OP makes out.
---
I play both but I would say I play killer more often. Thank you!
---
Oh shit that might have been me.
---
Were you playing Huntress?
---
My steam id is Sharmarko.
---
So on the backend of things dbs told steam they where having a halloween event but by time dbd had to delay the event it was probly to late to take it off and since dbds last update was stranger things itll display that just by default
---
Its not purposly misleading but steam really should take it out of that catogory
---
It really depends on the context. Sprint Burst might be top tier in a tournament setting, but that doesn¬¥t help the average player who is starting out. 
---
Not everything that works in a top-coordinated SWF group will work for solo queue, especially for a new player.
---
I will take that DS if it means I get a chance to hook a survivor. They can always miss
---
Totally agree.
---
i can loop a killer while injured, but youd have to be very pallet happy to always be injured, especcially w/o dead hard, and at that point you basically fucked your team over so hard it doesnt matter what you do because you have no pallets, i said this in the post already btw, so anothet case of you looking dumb because u cant read
---
That's not toxic. It's strategy. If you down one survivor right after they got off the hook somebody will have to come to heal them and that's 2 survivors not working on gens. Also, Claudette was toxic for the sake of being toxic and even If I was toxic too, which I wasn't, she deserved it. Karma is real.
---
Damn why? I like try hard survivors bc I like outplaying them, definitely not the other way around.
---
Question.
---
If a survivor has OoO and the killer is in the undetectable status, do the killer see the OoO aura or not ?
---
Feels like the kliller shouldn't, but knowing BHVR, it won't work that way, will it ?
---
I'll try to add PWYF to my build and see how it goes. But I'm afraid I'll lose precious time by letting my obsession go to stack up.
---
The whole point of sprint burst is that it works as a solo. Look up videos on sprint burst as I cba to explain all the benefits but people used to think it‚Äôs trash and they have that closed mindset.
---
Oh hey there little Marin Marina Spirit little tiny teenager in the spirit girl would you like to drink itself? You know you're drunk
---
Your daddy's going to cut you to pieces tonight right now getting drunk and there goes your little shop women Japanese businessman can you stay late to entertain me with your tiny teenage tits are in
---
I mean I get that killers get the extra points for the hit. But by that time they have already lost and feel done with that game and ready to go to the next. Some of us don't care about those points. Just leave.
---
That's when you stop getting healing skill checks.
---
Every time I put on we‚Äôll make it
---
heres the thing, someone starts the trend of cleansing in a match, and im usually that person because i think its advantageous to cleanse. i do agree that at lower ranks you shouldnt cleanse, though, but at like purple ranks i dont think always being injured will fly. thanks for not getting salty at this post though lol
---
I just want second wind
---
I‚Äôm not gonna read your little salt post. The topic is about how you‚Äôre boosted and cleanse against a plague.
---
Everyone says you get punished for killing a survivor with Thanatophobia, but that's not actually true.
---
Four Survivors injured is a 64 percent slowdown (4 Survivors at 100 percent would be 400 percent).
---
While killing the Survivor would decrease the penalty from Thanatophobia, it's still a dead Survivor with a 100 percent decrease. You go from 336 percent  to 252 percent speed, which is still a dramatic slowdown
---
Or when you get hit by the pallet 50m away from it üò≠
---
Tranquilo
---
Chase them out. It‚Äôs literally that simple.
---
Having fun is all that matters, good job
---
thats a good point, im decently confident in my ability to dodge vomit so im usually the one who cleanses first. thanks for the comment dude
---
(nurse and Spirit laugh in the distance)
---
No, they‚Äôd get extra points for toxicity if I did that
---
Because Pig needs more nerfs. She's too OP needs to move at 50% speed on base and 1% when crouched.
---
I did read it. That's how I ended up here. It is pretty clear. You think survivors are just being innocent and celebrating at the gates. You brought up camping as if it somehow relates to not just leaving. A better example would have been the killer smacking the person on hook and nodding. Or is that okay too cus the killer is just "celebrating?"
---
trying to heal someone on The Game after unhooking him with the killer nowhere near.  He drops down a hole and I had balanced landing and didn't want to exhaust it.  "Welp, you're on your own, buddy."
---
"i will not read it because i dont like being wrong" ok buddy this is why all of your points are invalid because ive already adressed all the points you types like to make
---
Then why do Instaheals work for Second Wind?
---
More importantly: Why do Instaheals work for Second Wind when healing with a Medkit in general doesn't work for Second Wind?
---
Or they start cleansing a Hex totem that has no hex on it when they need a heal..
---
I want a short movie of this!
---
Finally happened to me. I had one last night that was sabotaging 2 hooks. 
---
Turns out I really needed to stalk and down 3 people as ghostface. Still cant believe I misread that one.
---
can you tell me why
---
‚ÄúI will ignore all valid points because I don‚Äôt have a valid response for them‚Äù
---
If someone gets hit by 4 decisives then it is because they are *probably* tunneling, thus deserving it
---
all the valid responses are in the post buddy :]
---
Facts üíØ
---
Honestly, though Spirit is powerful, if you are willing to buy I‚Äôd suggest Stranger Things. You get two survivors with pretty good perks and a fun killer. Plus, they are licensed so you have to buy them, while the other two you can get with shards.
---
The toxic part is you saying you didn't hit the healers and just re-downed the Claudette. The only evidence you gave for her being toxic was saving someone from a hook and body blocking you. Neither of which is toxic. And don't preach strategy to me when you struggle to get kills with a build that can LITERALLY see through walls.
---
Having read all your comments in this thread OP, I think dbd might not be the game for you. You‚Äôre getting so worked up over teabagging that you‚Äôll dc to spite the survivors of escape points, which is like what, 5000? Jesus. Honestly, I‚Äôd just play something else if I were you.
---
I don‚Äôt seem to have many of these problems though.
---
It might. Like a survivor using OoO and distortion
---
It‚Äôs both a joke and serious
---
Your domain is the trial, the survivors want out. Make them stay by hooking, make them leave sooner by scaring them out if you know they can do so on their own.
---
It doesn't matter how fast you heal so long as you heal a health state.
---
I'm not sure if insta-heals work due to not technically filling up the bar, but everything else will.
---
Shut up
---
&gt;probably tunneling
---
Is it tunnelling when the survivors go out of their way to come find me? I play both sides at red ranks.
---
I'm actively trying to ignore this claudette who just got unhooked, and attempt to chase the unhooker, but she keeps clicking her flashlight and teabagging before speed-vaulting into a locker.
---
Idk what wack world you live in but I‚Äôve been able to 4K consistently with wraith no perks or addons, and I‚Äôve just realized that it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôve spent 400 hours on just wraith. Nvm
---
Or they could not act toxically and just leave themselves
---
Nani!?
---
Didn't they used to add / subtract hooks? What happened to that. That was interesting.
---
Yes, it will.
---
I think B1G\_Frank just answered your question, being full health in 4 conditions
---
Oh, not saying you're wrong. There's right times and wrong times to cleanse, and I can't really address where you were in the game without being there myself.
---
But the four points I stated above are a good indication of when to cleanse. Plague requires a very "Read the situation and adapt" playstyle. Picking the wrong state of "Broken but normal purge" or "Cleansed but Corrupt Purge" is going to shift the power to the Plague, but reading the game well and picking the right state is going to succeed. 
---
Just tough for Solo Survivor without communication. If you're able to get everyone on board, be it through voice or otherwise, then it's much easier. Because having a state of "Broken but with Corrupt Purge" is deadly.
---
Thus the *probably*, i know there are exceptions, but the likely answer is just them tunneling, if the survs are doing something to make ds an offensive perk then fine, there is reason to complain but in 99% of my experience, ds is just great against tunnelers
---
I see, this definitely helped thank you. I can understand now how these hitboxes work and i did a bit of research too.
---
I literally told you why they use it, because it works well in a coordinated SWF. Lots of perks can be very usable in a SWF. Object of Obsession is top tier in a high level SWF but that doesn¬¥t mean I would recommend it for a solo new player like the one asking here. 
---
Sure it helps you get away, but you need to know where the loops are, how to manage your exhaustion timer, and it works well in a coordinated setting when your teammates can help distract the killer while you are exhausted or when they let you know you have a window to sprint burst somewhere where you need to be.
---
A newer player is going to have issues using Sprint Burst optimally because they will just end up walking about the map slowly saving it for the chase, where a Dead Hard or a different good exhaustion perk would have similar results and wouldn¬¥t create bad habits like walking around the map immersed all the time.
---
Just got a message from this dude calling me trash. Unbelievable, but it upset me enough to look him up. Apparently, he has history lol
---
The whole point of this post was teabags, dude. And we‚Äôve been talking about reasons survivors would stay BESIDES teabagging that aren‚Äôt reasons to ban them. 
---
Also, teabagging is not bannable. It should never be bannable. That‚Äôs just stupid. Unless they insult you with messages, you shouldn‚Äôt report them.
---
Every perk works better in a swf under your logic then. Plus when exhaustion is calling down and not in case you should be on gens.
---
Well you clearly haven't read it.... Just because I used the word celebrating? They are celebrating... That doesn't mean they're not being toxic. Whether you like it or not.
---
yes the killer will celebrate at the end of the game by htting a survivor. Or ghostface sometimes teabags. That is the same level of toxic imo as teabagging at the gates. This is different to camping someone to death and not what this conversation is about?
---
I didn't bring up camping. I wasn't providing any examples. - I explained why one is slightly worse than the other. It was OP who was asking what the difference is. And now he has veered the conversation off to some bullshit about holding the game hostage.
---
I have only been justifying one point. Deliberately camping a survivor to ruin their game is a worse level of toxic than teabgaging at the exit gates - even though they are both a shitty thing to do. (You and OP seem to be ignoring that part to justify your replies?)
---
So again. Reread the conversation.
---
Yeah if the gates aren't open or even powered just eat the DS, not only is it a waste of their DS but now they have a smaller chance of escaping if you pick them up on their last hook
---
&gt; *I think I was wasting time trying to mind game him on it*
---
You were. A base Wraith can't really handle looping, you either wait for Bloodlust to kick in or you go off to find someone else. If you're not using perks or add-ons then your main option is ambushing people while they're busy.
---
Base speed is 115%, or 4.6m/s. After 15 seconds, 4.8m/s. After 30 seconds, 5.0m/s. After 45 seconds (a little over half a gen), 5.2m/s or 130% the speed of a survivor. Cloaking removes all Bloodlust. Your "mindgame" *as described* was no real threat to the survivor.
---
I'd start with OhTofu's guides on looping [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop), as well as ScottJund's looping guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ).
---
thats autism, there it is, once you say "WELL IF YOU PLAY 100% PERFECTLY LIKE A TAS BOT YOU WONT LOSE" thats how you know your argument is literally nothing, thats when you know youve become autism incarnate. yes bro if you can see in the future, if you can 360 every swing the killer makes, if you can run loops 100% optimally, you can loop the whole game! thats really insightful bro u should become a philosopher or something. yeah ok dude i cant wait to see what u say next
---
I report anyone who stays in the gate while everyone is safe for holding the game hostage/ refusing to participate in normal gameplay. They deserve it
---
The assumption is that they possibly sent out the patch for verification, but we dont know for sure. Either way, that one is less on behaviour, and more on the specific vendors.
---
Now available at Walgreens
---
She was trying to prevent hooks and keep her teammates safe. Blocking the hook is not toxic. It's a free hit for you. Again using the flashlight to try to save. Also again not toxic. I'm not defending toxic behavior which is why I called you on yours. Which honestly has been the only real toxic thing you've stated happened. Don't say it's strategy then if you don't actually know what you're doing. I play about 70/30 split leaning more towards killer. Scratch mirror is my favorite build. I tried to give you advice. You decided instead to defend your shitty behavior. Turning on caps lock doesn't make your defense stronger.
---
i know i was just throwing it out there to see what you thought, im a solo survivor too so i know the struggle but i try my best to get other people to cleanse
---
Okay, gotta be the guy who makes some random Perks for both :
---
**Spongebob** -
---
- *"I'm Ready"* -
---
You're ready and excited for the challenges that await you.
---
At the start of trial, gain a 10 % haste for a total duration of 20 / 25 / 30 seconds and a 10 % action speed for a total duration of 40 / 50 / 60 seconds.
---
The action speed granted by "I'm Ready" influences Repairing, Healing, Sabotaging, Unhooking, Cleansing and Vaulting.
---
"Being naive can be a blessing in this place" - ???
---
- *"My Very Best Friend"* -
---
You and your BFF have went through so many adventures, that you will not let it come to an halt now.
---
Makes a random Survivor except yourself the Obsession if there isn't one already.
---
The aura of the Obsession is permanently revealed to you.
---
You and the Obsession perform Alturism actions on each other 30 / 40 / 50 % faster.
---
Aslong as you perform Co-Op actions with the Obsession, both of you gain 10 % action speed for the action that is currently performed.
---
- *"Working Overtime"* -
---
As as animal of habbit, you don't bother about your typical routines. You love what you do, so you just don't care.
---
Increases the maximum amount of Bloodpoints that can be scored in every category by 2000 / 3000 / 4000 points.
---
Working Overtime receives a token for every 10 seconds spent on healing Survivors, sabotaging, or cleansing. 
---
Repairing a Generator generates a token every 20 seconds instead.
---
For every token of Working Overtime the amount of Bloodpoints scored for that action aswell as the action speed increases by 10%.
---
Working Overtime can yield a maximum of 3 tokens.
---
Working Overtime's tokens turn to 0 once leaving a repair action.
---
"Don't worry Mr. Krabs, this is payment enough!" - Spongebob Squarepants
---
**The Doodle**
---
A confusing Killer, relying on creating faked objects
---
that punish Survivors who are foolish enough to interact
---
with them.
---
His Perks revolve around reducing the Survivors time efficiency.
---
- *"Deceive And Receive"* -
---
You're talented at fooling others. Sadly it's never been recognized by someone else. For whatever reason you leave everyone speechless.
---
Survivors hanging on hooks will not reveal the progress of their hook phase to other Survivors.
---
The Aura of hooked Survivors is hidden to Survivors that are not within atleast 24 / 20 / 16 metres of range.
---
- *"Poisonous Lead"* -
---
While the saying that pencil's contain lead is a hoax,
---
your weapon definetly does. To the misfortune everyone
---
who will slowly succumb to the poisonous substance.
---
Upon hitting a Survivor you apply a Hindered Status effect of
---
2 % that increases by 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 % every 15 seconds until
---
fully healed.
---
The power of the Hindered Status Effect caused by "Lead Poisoning" cannot exceed a total of 6 %.
---
- *"Doolittle Doodle"* -
---
You always wondered why you are expected to put in
---
more effort than necessary. If it works, it works right?
---
The hook which was the closest to a Survivors downing location, is highlighted yellow upon pick up.
---
Hooking a Survivor on the highlighted hook causes the entity progression to be fastened by 10 / 12.5 / 15 %.
---
A Survivor that gets sacrificed on a hook which is affected by "Doolittle Doodle" will not destroy the hook.
---
This could almost be like an Epic rap battles of history episode.
---
Kudos to you sir!
---
I'd definitely go with stranger things. You get more perks bc of the two survivors, plus a fun killer. Also the plague and spirit you can buy with shards.
---
That‚Äôs abusing the report system. There‚Äôs no way to change your 
---
# toxic
---
Viewpoint.
---
HA i can get behind that
---
I think it‚Äôs great! The pose really puts it all together, very in-character!
---
God, I wish they would just go ahead and make Left 4 Dead 3. Everybody wants it, and everybody would play it.
---
Left 4 Dead is like 10+ years old now, and it still is widely recognized and thought highly of in 2019. Like, come on.
---
I honestly cant see the difference in a match with thanato but i use it anyways
---
All Save the Best For last would do I shorten that time but guess what IT WOULD STILL DO THE SAME THING like I like how you actually think that this buff was like anti gen or some shit nah it‚Äôs just to fix survivors doing shut in front of killers while they can‚Äôt do anything to stop them I mean seriously it‚Äôs literally a couple seconds difference Save The Best For Last would still be too tier 
---
Soooooo Weapon Wipe off animation shorter = not being able to do gens healing etc for shorter time I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt get what you think would happen if your weapon animation is shorter you don‚Äôt need as long as a anti gen 
---
But even then let‚Äôs just say that Save The Best for Last wouldn‚Äôt effect the time EVEN THE nothing would change no survivor will hop on a gen mid chase just because 
---
Also thank you for insulting me that was really sweet of you
---
&gt;They thought that servers would help, its just sad that they don‚Äôt.
---
In fact it's much worse now.
---
IMO both Plague and Spirit would be worth it. 
---
Spirit is a top tier killer that will be very easy for you to play, and she has two great perks: Spirit Fury (although generally only really worth using with Enduring) and Haunted Grounds (best when paired with Ruin, not sure if you have Hag). Rancor is not top tier but very fun to play with. The Survivor in this DLC also has one good perk (Deliverance).
---
Plague is not a top tier killer, but she is very fun to play, and she has 2 great perks: Corrupt Intervention (great to slow the game down at the start, some like to use this instead of Ruin and if you don¬¥t have Ruin it¬¥s a no brainer) and Infectious Fright (very good on killers who can chase well and against survivor groups who like to stay close to each other). She also has Dark Devotion which again is not top tier but can be very fun to mindgame with once you gain some experience. There is also one good survivor perk in here (Head On from Jane).
---
I wouldn¬¥t buy Stranger Things if I were you...it is still a bit expensive and while the killer is quite fun, most of the perks in this DLC are meh and it is still quite expensive. Rather get 2 other DLCs for that price and get more bang for your buck.
---
What fucked me up the most was, yeasterday I got 2 dailys for the one Killer and One Survivor I both main, but no. The game glitches, I restart amd I get dailys I didn't want. It hurts.
---
champagne would be splashed at people similar to plagues vom, the liquid itself would cause slow down like clowns tonics, besides that she'd be a regular m1lly i think, maybe her terror radius would be a warped version of here comes the bride too
---
&gt; Idk what wack world you live in but I‚Äôve been able to 4K consistently with wraith no perks or addons
---
Ok. Well... Maybe I mean. Just for clearance, we are talking about what rank range?
---
While you're right, that doesn't change the fact that the perk itself becomes weaker once you're sacrificing a Survivor.
---
Sure, it is definetly more efficient to just kill the Survivors. So it doesn't punish you in a sense that you receive an actuall impactful penalty or something, but Thanato still becomes weaker. Which is sort of a punishment.
---
I don't know, they should just make it so it goes for sacrificed / mori'd Survivors aswell (makes sense anyway), and increase the value to like 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 %. Then it could actually snowball and you don't have to focus THAT much on keeping Survivors injured as killing them gives you a permanent stack.
---
not Oblivious, remember that is a status effect for survivors and all it simply does is make you not hear the Terror Radius and thus be treated as such when it comes to perks, meaning OoO will actually ALWAYS work if you're oblivious.
---
It‚Äôs not an insult, I went on your profile saw your legion cos play and you hardly can reach the sink,  plus you look very small compare to everything in the background which gives the info that you‚Äôre still a kid
---
if he camps, do gens
---
That's part of why he talked about adding a mechanic were pallets respawn based on how many gens were done, so survivors are also rewarded for doing well before the endgame
---
This meme is perfect for me, because in a previous Match, I was playing with the Demogorgon against a survivor literally named "Pet the Demogorgon", I crushed all of them till there were 2 remaining, and then I decided to farm with the remaining 2 just because I wanted the "Pet the Demogorgon" to pet me, but he didn't pet me once, and I gave him so many opportunities, and then I got tired of it, and killed him on hook, the last one I allowed to exit through the gates.
---
In the post-game chat I asked furiously for him, why didn't he pet me, and he answered that he had no idea he had to do that, like, ITS HIS NAME!
---
I just wanted a pet in the demogorgon. :'(
---
I hardly see anyone with NOED anymore. Which is good
---
"heheh devs bad"
---
Come on, the BHVR teams are trying to give us what we want. Judging the sub constantly asking for shit, its not like they can solely focus on one thing. Especially when they need new content to keep the community interested.
---
Your Mileage May Vary
---
Survivor main spotted
---
You're the one that doesn't get it. You sound like a rank 20 killer so don't worry you'll get better. Also I love the I'm out of defenses so I'll just block you instead.
---
do you play on PS4?
---
correct, but I do play killer also, and I get games where the survivors have insta-heals and it doesn't bother me at all
---
You get more cringe by the minute just gtfo
---
&gt; Hobo with a Shotgun
---
Wow, never saw that before, but that could indeed be a duo to implement!
---
Myers's (and Ghostface, to a degree) has an ability allowing him to look at survivors to fill a meter, called stalking. Once fully stalked, Myers enters the next tier, up to tier 3. At tier 3, survivors recieve the ''exposed" status effect, allowing killers to down them in one hit from any health stage for a short period.
---
Tombstone refers to a Myers add-on allowing you to grab healthy or injured survivors while in tier 3 and kill them immediately.
---
Play shirtless/scoops ahoy for 20 matchs and make your own conclusions
---
Why run noed on grey rank survivors? Thats a total waste of a perk slot..
---
I can answer furtive chase. If it worked when not in a chase, you could get a killer like hillbilly or legion who gets to you without hearing them coming (-8 with m&amp;a, plus a -4 per stack of furtive up to -16, so -24 to terror radius.) use that on a killed with a base 24 meter radius, they get to be jump scare Myers with whatever power they have, or the 32 meter ones are now only 8.
---
I can't possibly be the only sane one that says, "fuck it, let's finish a gen first" before wasting 10 seconds of my life being dead weight.   
---
I may have taken that whole "Prove Thyself" thing too far.
---
Sometimes, yes
---
Well the devs did release a graph that showed even at rank 1 less than 50% of survivors escape, swf or not. The devs have been nerfing survivors steadily almost every update, so either you don‚Äôt have 2000 hours and have been playing this game since 2016, or you‚Äôre straight up lying, and I‚Äôm gonna go with the former since swf is still such a big problem for you. 
---
And yeah, I‚Äôm calling you bad for avoiding challenge, because I did the same thing ya know, been there done that. Losing sucks, but you ain‚Äôt gonna win every game, and you definitely ain‚Äôt gonna get any better if you keep avoiding groups of players and blaming your shortcomings on perks or other game mechanics.
---
I mean, if you‚Äôve really been playing for 2000 hours, it doesn‚Äôt matter how you spilt that across killer/survivor,  it doesn‚Äôt make sense for you to have this big of a problem with swf still, even at rank 1. And, on the off chance you really have been playing that long, and are still this, dare I say bad, then I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything that I can tell you that you haven‚Äôt already heard, and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to get any better any time soon. 
---
Literally all I can tell you is best of luck and let you figure things out on your own, because you have to make the choice on your end to tough it out and improve, there‚Äôs no secret technique or advice I can give you.
---
The amount of times 'Teammates' didn't heal me even tho I was literally infront of them, makes me just have to use Self-Care most of the times. Like also seriously why bring "we will make it" when unhooking me, but rather running away, knowing the Killer is chasing someone
---
Don't worry pal, it's just jealousy.
---
You're just screwing over your teammates. Yeah, sure, you escaped at the expense of the other survivors.
---
what should you do about teams who run away into the corner of the map to heal, had a game as freddy on coldwind farm and the survivors got themselves into a 3 gen situation, but every time I'd spot one they'd immediately run to the other end of the map and if I hit them they use the speed boost to run further, I can't just leave the gens for the other three to fix but what happened then was the most agonisingly long and boring game where're I'd see a guy, hit him then wait a minute for them to heal and then come back.
---
this is pretty dope, very well developed... but will the devs recognize it...?
---
Oh for sure I'm not gonna defend facecamping or any other toxic behavior from killers either. But I'm also not gonna pretend survivors doing cocky and toxic stuff at the gates is just harmless fun. They're BMing straight up.  And to be clear Idc if they're teabagging exit gates myself. I just go to the door and moonwalk back and forth to show them their toxicity isn't bothering me.
---
Stalking is the shape's (Myers) power.
---
He starts at evil within tier 1 where he has a terror radius of 8 meters but moves slowly and has a small lunge. By stalking, which means holding m2 while having a survivor in line of sight, he can get to tier 2. Tier 2 includes Base killer movement speed, Base lunge and 16 meter terror radius. At this point you can t get back to tier 1. He can keep stalking to get to tier 3 which means insta down attacks for a minute then goes back to tier 2 and has to stalk again, increased lunge, and Base killer terror radius of 32 meters. In The meme its mentioned the tombstone add on, which is ultra rare and allows Myers to instantly kill a survivor in tier 3.
---
Worst bodyblock ever lmao
---
It‚Äôll drop in a month and two weeks ish. 
---
So teases and what not will start late November.
---
4s4rw7·∫£
---
Sprint burst is terrible and players who use it are bad.
---
So basicly blue footprints that he could follow if someone stepped on them. I feel like he could also have a secondary ability like Demogorgon. Maybe Brutal Strike, where it would be a charged one shot that could be dodged. Of course the visual would be him raising his machete high above his head. Although i do see it a bit op having him have trap teleports and one shot, but Brutal Strike could be changed around a bit. Maybe a harmful hit with a new stat? Idk.
---
I give this an oink/10
---
Because a single cleanse can kill your entire team. Sure if you‚Äôre in a coordinated swf and can play around it by hiding etc and timing it to wait it out it‚Äôs fine but that‚Äôs more then likely not the case... you can kill your entire time with one single cleanse. At high ranks it‚Äôs understood everyone stays injured and gen rushes through the gens instead of cleansing until the very end
---
Yeah that‚Äôs red ranks, you gotta have a solid game if you wanna pop, but it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre gonna de pip with a 3k in any rank unless you‚Äôre camping each person to death
---
I really hate this community sometimes.
---
Some I agree some I dont
---
For example flip flop would be crazy strong if it did 100%. Like stronger than unbreakable. Think about it. Instead of healing yourself up you get to 99% then when the killer grabs you you can just instantly escape, not only bringing you back up but also stunning him. Plus you can do this multiple times per game and pair with unbreakable for quicker speed? It would be very strong. It's too weak as is so idk the best fix honestly.
---
Same with second wind. It would be way to easy to proc if I could just tap a survivor and now its active. A full heal isnt even that hard to get. It should just work with medkits is my only gripe.
---
Also surge would be potentially glitchy/problem causing in certain situations with no cooldown. Maybe it should be like 15-20secs, but I think it needs SOME kind of cooldown.
---
/s but actually this would be a nerf. STBFL is designed to let you M2 the obsession and M1 everyone else. If STBFL also worked with M2s it would be useless, you‚Äôd just be constantly losing all your tokens.
---
Exactly
---
False, I've let plenty of people go.
---
Like rank 6-4 or so matchmaking is weird
---
Has so many ppl and on sale and all dlcs except stranger things are on sale for like 3 bucks each
---
You aren‚Äôt a high enough rank then
---
If they're running to the corner to be healed by a teammate, it's probably worthwhile to chase and down somebody. Take the risk that the other 2 won't be efficient enough to complete the gen while you're downing somebody. If they're all healing with Self Care in the corners, then you have a choice to make. It's kind of a shitty situation, but you can either hope for a survivor mistake when yo-yoing or just commit to downing somebody. 
---
You can also (since you're freddy) go for more of an end game build with Blood Warden so that even if they finish that gen the game isn't over
---
Then you must leave a lot of games, eh? Ruin is one of the most common killer perks used. 
---
Don‚Äôt you think if you practiced ruin skillchecks, you might get better at them? Instead of leaving the round and screwing over your team (and the killer).
---
Thanks Mom.
---
As much as i want to trust the devs. Alot of things in the game are weird, instaheal, moris and such
---
11$ for a halloween event
---
Then overhaul furtive chase entirely. It‚Äôs insanely useless in its current state.
---
Also- to add to above list- why does furtive chase disable completely when obsession dies? So needlessly punishing for a really useless effect.
---
I just tunnel them into the fucking core of the earth. And since I‚Äôm not using any annoying perks I at least get to do that. But more often then not after the first book they just dc. So no more object after that!
---
# OH NO HES HOT
---
Well then I recant my statement. Iri head huntress is fucking bullshit lol especially with infantry belt and iron maiden
---
Out of curiosity what killer rank are you playing at?
---
I did this with a baby Dwight for a solid minute the other day and it was fucking hilarious. I think he saw me as Nea and took the "Nea is a killer" meme too seriously...
---
stream is on thursday, but it may still be today, the event banner is popping up in some stores, which implies that it may have been sent out for certification, who knows.
---
Sometimes yes.
---
Could just make it so it doesn't stack with M&amp;A but honestly if the Killer took two perks and constantly chased only their Obsession then they deserve to have a Myers-sized Terror Radius.
---
I cant wait until the bloodpoint grind is over so I can stop using a perk slot on BBQ. There are more interesting builds I want to do, but double bloodpoints is too much to pass up. Ruin is an unfortunate necessity though, without it I lose 2-3 gens in the first few minutes.
---
keep hating that unfun b\*tcho
---
Yeah, its getting tiring having insteaheals every damn game. EVERY DAMN GAME!
---
Ooh I like your idea more. And you totally know how to write it just like the devs! 
---
I mean, once the survivors find out you've got this perk, they'd obvs be able to counter it but they'd be seriously hindered.
---
given how long they were teasing stranger things, teasers could actually start like, quite soon here.
---
Can I still hate doctor?
---
New Survivor: Demogorgon
---
I can agree with that.
---
Haha that is one way to deal with it. I'll usually just stare them down, see what they do, try to edge ever so much closer without them realising. It soon dawns on them and they get the hell outa there.
---
But the amount of times one tries to be cocky and takes a hit more than they needed to is surprising.
---
I'll often let them heal and stuff at the end too - depending on if they are toxic or not, which they can act thankful for sometimes. Just because I know when I'm a survivor I'm just like, "cmon man atleast let us heal for a few more bp!".
---
But all this is quite situational to how the game has gone.

 Nah
---
Please use the pinned Megathread.
---
this is literally on purpose, because that was never intentional, it was a bugged interaction.
---
So we should all just run no mither.
---
Bring infantry belt now you have 3 downs, get close easy target, chainsaws most of them are really close to survivors, perks that require conditions noed it just exists after gens, devour hope you just have to hook, most of these are either perks or add-ons, just like insta heals that are add-ons
---
If i have BT and i can, i will try the save. What i'm saying is that before you "could" get away, because there was a mindgame there. Simulating the unhook and switch to the other side to avoid the first hit; right now there's no really a chance. As i said, i think it was fine as it was.
---
Yes a lot of people play including myself. X_BoostedEgirl_X if you wanna play :D
---
I have never ever seen this work out against me. So I have no idea lol
---
I'm talking about the time I was at rank 6 some months ago, now I'm at rank 14 but I only play killer once or twice a week
---
What ticks me off is that Behavior seems afraid of at least trying. Even if it was just on the PTB I'd like to see how effective Flip-Flop would actually be if it converted 75% (or even 100%) of recovery into struggle, or if Furtive Chase would reduce Terror Radius constantly, or if Camaraderie worked on both hook stages.
---
I'd rather something be OP for a time than play against Adred + DS + Borrowed + Dead Hard V.S. Ruin + BBQ + Spiritduring every match.
---
Well the game lasted forever and was agonizingly boring because of you. Yes they fucked up and got into that situation, but the killer dictates the game. Unless of course you get survivors just hiding and not doing anything. Which they weren‚Äôt. They were just doing the smart thing and not looping right between the 3 gens. If you wanted the game over you should have chased one and hooked him then used Freddy‚Äôs gen teleport you get right back and apply pressure. I know that‚Äôs harsh but it‚Äôs true. If you refuse to enter a chase and protect the 3 gens, that‚Äôs on you. You can‚Äôt complain about a long and boring game.
---
I do that when someone is tbagging. You tbag i facecamp, then i go back playing normally after the dude died, if nobody else is toxic I let one or two people escape to show goodwill.
---
They are actually very different things. The issue as a survivor, you KNOW they have instadowns, pretty much at all times. The only ambiguous one is iridescent head from huntress, but thats a problematic one anyways. One of the big problems with instant heals, as a killer, is every time I see a medkit, I now have to factor in the instant heal, and play around it, whether they have it or not. There are other problems aswell, but overall, your point is just based on false equivalency.
---
So they won‚Äôt change the fact that we can basically see Freddy at all time with OoO? Well, that sucks for him.
---
\- sometimes you can jump out right at a moment when killer hits to open, and he opens a locker right after you jump out;
---
\- with dedicated servers grabs are broken, and it's quite likely that killer gonna get a glitched grab instead (i.e. you just leave not even being hit).
---
Because if you are in a locker then the killer has to grab you and trigger ds or leave you. If you aren't they can slug you and wait ds out.
---
I think this is one of those cases I am afraid to say, you kinda have to prove yourself.
---
It's a shame that thanat is garbage now. They release killers that keep the survivors injured and then nerf the only perk capable of exploiting that fact. Awww BHVR.
---
Still sounds like crying to me
---
Informative response, glad we had this conversation. Wasn't even giving a definite, just informing you that sometimes they actually start their subtle teasing quite early on in the cycle, there are certain comments ALREADY that may actually turn out to be teasers.
---
[This](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/771/II0BH5BS6HP0.jpg) is for the survival rate by party size. I'll link you the whole [stat sheets](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests) page as well. A word of warning: If you are going to go through all the info, read the descriptions underneath the data very carefully. If you are not well versed in statistics it can be easy to be mislead by what you are looking at.
---
Fwiw there are a few other cases where the exposed status can come from, IE some killer perks and add ons can cause the exposed status. 
---
For now I'd also consider the somewhat popular killer perks "no one escapes death" (shortened online to "noed") and haunted grounds. For noed, if there are any blank totems around when 5 gens are powered, one random blank totem will light up and as long as that totem is lit the killer will move faster and all survivors are exposed. HG is a perk where there are 2 lit totems on the map, and if a survivor cleanses one of the lit totems all survivors are exposed for 60s.
---
Sometimes its good to plau like a casual
---
It was free with ps+ last year.  Did someone on your ps have ps+ then? (And add it to library)  Just wanted to say in case your not the plus account or something.  
---
My boyfriend has the plus account, but I keep check of it &amp; add the games, as he doesn't bother!
---
Anyway,  I love dbd and it's the only game that has managed to take my attentions away from Battlefield!  I'd say it's worth it, especially as it's in the sale &amp; with the Archives coming up.  I'm very excited for it üòÉ
---
Ghostpface's really suit well
---
Or maybe its the opposite and even if you didn't see it the teammates tbagged all game so he is all out of mercy.
---
Please refer to points 2 and 3.
---
Something something ‚Äúover 300 confirmed kills‚Äù
---
Bubba
---
Please refer to points 1 and 2.
---
[Ok](https://i.imgur.com/wCTnjld.png)
---
I agree. Shit foundation with cpu ticks per second doing way too much at an unoptimized pace. Code needs a complete overhaul.
---
Guess I‚Äôll do it myself lol. Learn to deal with gate waiting, it‚Äôs part of the game ya food.
---
Of course, because he‚Äôs the real one annoying cunt
---
I like to shock people just because I like to hear his little giggle.
---
I had a team the other day that got mad at me for doing gens. They kept getting down and the other teammates would either loop the killer or hook rush and I just kept to myself and I did 4 gens while they did all that. 3 out of 4 of us escaped and they all got mad at me because I sat by the generators repairing. I was shaking my fucking head, because if I went and started hook rushing the whole group would have been dead and probably never made it to the gates.
---
What is the difference between movement speed and acceleration on Bubba for add-ons?
---
It‚Äôs toxic so it should be bannable. Doesn‚Äôt matter anymore, I‚Äôm just going to facecamp from now on
---
Yea if you could link it it would be great, or at least give me the name?
---
Just last night I found the blendette running to the corner to self care, I ran over and teabagged with my medkit. Did not stop her from self caring
---
"when he picks you up, all you do is fucking shank him in the neck. Got it?"
---
I know, which is why I didn‚Äôt say they didn‚Äôt know for sure but that hey just knew.
---
Gravesink isn‚Äôt very funny
---
And this is supposed to do what? Make me feel bad? Oh no a stranger on the internet thinks I'm an asshole. You aren't the first. You won't be the last.
---
Hey I got a little question to your first pig mask (Which looks diddly amazing btw): How much can you actually see with the mask on? I honestly have no idea how you can see anything infront of you
---
I'm pretty sure Trapper is loosely based on Jason Vorhees' lore. So if they can mask to Trapper's cosmetics, we can have the closest thing to an actual Jazon vorhees
---
Mettle of man is shit, it‚Äôs not worth it. You suicide to try get a perk to work
---
The Switch Playerbase Might Not Have Many High Rank Players, Or Maybe I'm Wrong. DBD Has Always Had God Awful Queue Times.
---
Killer: Spooky Space Kook
---
Survivors: Shaggy and Scooby
---
Map: Crystal Cove
---
(Mix of series I know)
---
Chose Mettle of Man when it doesn't work. Sad, but true.
---
When survivor picks up and you down him back.
---
Or when you down a currently healing survivor.
---
So I did what i was suppose to do then
---
Not even 1% of this sub reddit voted.
---
How much did the company charge you? I tried getting quotes for a Jason x mask a few months back and everyone wanted absurd amounts of cash. I could have bought the printer for what they wanted to charge.
---
50% killrate, tied with clown. And everyone knows clown is bad.
---
Will Spine Chill work against stealth killers anymore? If not utll be useless.
---
So survivors have smaller hitboxes than the killer and it's important for either role to loop by hugging the wall while looping! If you're looping around barrels and you're like a foot away from the barrel, you're moving a further distance compared to hugging the wall. This is especially important for killers because if you don't hug the wall while survivors do hug the wall it'll take SO much longer to get a hit than you should need.
---
Also, as somebody else already said for simple loops I wouldn't worry about mindgames, it's almost always a better idea to just walk forward.
---
No, the whole point of the perk is to keep you alive. Never die to use a perk
---
I dont really care if it does nothing other than satisfy myself by calling you a bitch.
---
That was the game crashing not the survivor disconnecting which is why it did that
---
Even being a hex, this perk is too op to exist.
---
There is matches where the survivors don't even find the hex totem.
---
being able to add infantry to iri hatchet is where the problem lies and yes that deserves some attention. And yeah chainsaw have to be close to survivors thats that. Noed exists after all gens are done, meaning you have already won, its annoying not advantageous. devour hope, really? other people can give you more details on why devour hope is for memes rather than means   
---
and remember its a 4v1, you have pallet, windows, 'infinites'. items green and above are already devastating. I want to be killer main and yet im red ranks in survivor with no items and WGLF.   
---
If instaheal dont bother you then it means your chasing a bad survivor and yeah no matter what help you give them if the dont know what theyre doing theyre dead.
---
If there‚Äôs literally nothing else around and you‚Äôre gonna die anyway, it‚Äôs worth a try.
---
The thing is with Nurse is that she was far fewer OP add-ons now. Plus, people *earn* their ability to play Nurse optimally through hours upon hours of practice and muscle memory tuning. And even then, she can be juked. With Spirit, there is no counter play against her, and her power is super easy to use. On top of that, she has Prayer Beads and Mother-Daughter Ring which turn the game into a cake (phase)walk.
---
Who would ever wanna remove him? He‚Äôs such a good doggy.
---
Yup, that's the TLDR haha
---
Gross
---
Thanks :D
---
Yeah that's what I thought.. with the open mouth and the curves on the mask :)
---
This is harsh but definitely true
---
Or how about when I go to drop the pallet on the killer and it just doesnt doo because the button wasnt highlighted.
---
Hag has clout goggles
---
Call of duty mobile it is then.
---
Hmm ? No, he's there .. ? :)
---
He's pretty simple, tho.
---
I think it was more the title of the post.. sounds like it should be on r/dbdgonewild lol
---
I love seeing wholesome couples &lt;3
---
I wouldn't ever take a Facebook user's input seriously.
---
Right when I close the hatch and hes about to lose huh?
---
Am I missing something or did you not actually have all the stacks? Bc there is still a red section on the perk?
---
Aww, thank you so much ahah &lt;3
---
I don't hate you ;) everyone his favorite :p
---
Can I say it ? Do I have that right ? Yes ?
---
Then r/wooosh
---
&gt; And even then, Thanato still loses stacks everytime you sacrifice of kill a Survivor. Meaning that you're literally being punished for doing your objective. Which becomes even worse once you realise that you have to keep all 4 Survivors in the game for Thanato to bloom.
---
I am really not trying to be offensive here, but that logic is so fucking flawed. While yes, the perk becomes potentially weaker for losing a possible stack yet you kill a suvivor thus... having a much higher impact on the match than 4%.
---
Of course thanatophobia requires a certain approach to the match, you cannot just go for 1 injure -&gt; hook etc. But the perk doesn't suck because some people think it's ccounterintuitive - the values need to be higher, that's all.
---
Is this a joke? It shows you only got 2 protection hits and you only got hit twice
---
Yeah, pretty simple but good :)
---
Who spells L4D as LFD?
---
Who hurt you? Billy isn't even that great of a killer.
---
Btw, OP: seems like you have your 90 degree turns down pat already.
---
You must be a PC player. The amount of NOED I see at red ranks on PS4 is actually disgusting. I easily see it in about 80% of my games.
---
No votes for shape
---
thank u for reading the post and my comments bro
---
Same here.  They been just switching randomly.
---
I think the work around is to pen up the daily thing a few times and check them.  They‚Äôll swap out once and then them seem to lock on a set eventually
---
Ya some people report which is pretty sad in my opinion
---
it can kill your entire team if nobody cleanses, sure
---
I don't.. get it ? xD
---
Honestly, most of the best survivor perks are available from the free survivor - Iron Will, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, and one of Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, or Sprint Burst (based on preference) are all from free survivors. As well as other solid perks, like Bond, Urban Evasion, Self Care, Unbreakable, and We're Gonna Live Forever.
---
The paid DLC survivors usually only let you have more specific builds (Lithe/Dance With me build for example) or some "for fun" perks (Head On, Distraction). Honestly, the only paid DLC top tier perk is Decisive Strike. You can buy Laurie by herself, but all perks eventually show up randomly in the Shrine of Secrets every week, so you can get the perk for free if you don't mind waiting for it to show up.
---
It's different if you're planning on playing killer, though, since all killers play differently, and can often be made considerably stronger when using other killers' perks. Also they have some very strong perks as paid DLC (BBQ, Ruin, M+A just to name 3)
---
That's because the count reset after I got my 3rd protection hit, after that locker
---
I think it would've been out by now if it was coming today :(
---
If im wrong why did u delete?
---
Mhhh, that could either mean it's coming surprisingly fast without us expecting it to drop or that they are simply clueless.
---
Probably wont come this week. I'd say next week or even the week After that.
---
Lmao its because survivors get a challenge when playong spirit lol
---
15 minutes
---
You new here?
---
Exactly. I understand when I legit could crawl over because they lost me or something. But when I'm clearly unable to escape, they become the asshole.
---
No... n- no...
---
The killer is already annoying and weak he needs to charge his wep for instant t3 or something or be able to one shot somehow
---
Dude no the fuck it's not the whole reason I posted this was because there wasn't shit wrong with my internet when this bullshit message came up. My connection was perfectly fine, always has been, and is now. So fuck all of that
---
No because any reports on that get discarded.
---
My experience is ghostface players always camp and I guess I can‚Äôt blame them because it‚Äôs an easy expose if you‚Äôre well hidden
---
Fantastic copypasta
---
I'm going to remake this video and do it again right now
---
Farming isnt fun. Thats why. It Steals peoples time
---
It's DBD, on the Switch, like, what the hell have you expected?
---
I mean idk what to tell you then bc when a killer dcs the game ends if a survivor dcs and is the last one you just go back to the end game leaderboard and you still get points as killer
---
The bond that's created between you and another survivor after pulling something like that is some euphoric shit I'll tell ya hwat
---
Also sometimes killing everyone too quickly because you focus on it depips you because this game is stupid. So kudos to you for helping both yourself and others.
---
dodging a plagues corrupt purge is infinently easier than looping her when you can die in one hit if you play it right, and if im confident a plague is not good enough to kill me with her corrupt purge than im going to cleanse, if my teammates are getting m1d into the ground because theyre all broken im going to cleanse in the hopes they do, if im broken and i know for a fact that shes trying to protect gens, im going to cleanse far away from them, these dont make her stronger, they break down her pressure, as cleansing is a built in way to alliviate pressure, and corrupt purge is a way to get some of it back, like how tier 3 does. maybe in the post i didnt describe when and why i cleanse but i dont cleanse for no reason, never ever cleansing is autistic though and you know it, im just tired of boosted people never cleansing even when itd be very beneficial to do so
---
Actually got it at a thrift store for around ~70ish? Definitely a score considering how perfect it matches I‚Äôd say
---
It came to hatchgame and ge just got tier 2?
---
Jaws.
---
Nice comeback dude.
---
Thanks :)
---
NOED = No one escapes death. When all generators are completed, if there is still a totem on the map that isn't lit up, it will be lit. Every eurvivor is now exposed but won't know that until the killer hits someone. Meaning, the killer one shots everyone. It is really strong for the moments when you have someone on hook right at the end. The downside is that the killer wont get use of the perk for the vast majority of the game. Most survivors complain about it being too powerful.
---
Wow really cool :)
---
That‚Äôd be great, but can you imagine the wait times? Oh god. It already takes a good 5 mins for me to find a match with my friend, imagine having to find a match with 6 others lol
---
Ghostface is basically every thumbnail on YouTube
---
You got kicked from the game itself the survivor didnt dc, it wasn't your internet it was the literal game, how aren't you grasping that? and chill out lmao.
---
All I‚Äôve asked is to not have people hold the game hostage and bm at the exit gates and you call me entitled. You‚Äôre literally the most stereotypical survivor main there is
---
I've been on this sub for 3 years and I can say with confidence that this is the best thing I've ever seen on it.
---
While playing killer, I just had somebody DC to give someone else the hatch, but then they did show up in the after-game chat. How is that possible?
---
No?
---
you weren't. I said the same thing
---
This Thanksgiving!
---
i really like it :) need more
---
This happens to everyone all the time
---
Seriously tho. Basically either everybody should cleanse or nobody should.
---
Don't do that. Greeding and camping the pallet for the stun is how killers get most of their hits through them.
---
Trading a health state is not worth 1000 points
---
You are suppose to cleanse that‚Äôs why the fountains exist, it‚Äôs not a pro strat to not cleanse. Why would anyone want to be one shot throughout the game?
---
Thanks I am planning to regularly update it act by act
---
gengrab myers vs rank 20s is a force to be recokened with
---
They just want to rub it in. I already understand I wont always win by then I'm just ready to move along to the next match.
---
Instadowns are good on ghostface because he can remove his terror radius and red stain. Making it much easier to mindgame or sneak up on people.
---
I'm not on steam so I can't see. At least 100 though (I know it's not a lot)
---
I get that same thing allot and it‚Äôs been a ongoing problem with the game. BhVR is aware of it, but haven‚Äôt heard much about a patch for it and we are stuck with this constant booting and it then popping up saying some error. Happens on both survivor and killer side for me on PS4. Just another thing on the list of problems this game has.
---
Hi Cancer, I'm dad.
---
Time to pull out the irre head and infantry belt üòÇ
---
Gonna be honest I dont know why people hate facing Spirt, I love facing her, she keeps me on my toes and the match is usually quite exciting
---
You realise you cannot hold the game hostage anymore right?You can force the survivors out or they will die by EGC.Plus why does spamming a button trigger you so much?Is this your first multiplayer game?
---
Stab me piggy (‡∏á Õ†*0 Õ°*)‡∏á
---
Trading a health state isnt the goal. I'm good at looping around the pallets and dropping them but not good at getting the stuns. I feel I need to get the stuns so I have extra time to break line of sight to escape the chase.
---
Nothing new
---
I love this haha
---
Imagine playing DbD in 2019 as a M1 killer. You fucking disgusting filth.
---
It‚Äôs done to disrespect the killer, which is why I‚Äôm going to give survivors what they deserve: one hook death
---
Pretty nice mate, keep drawing
---
Apparently he can't have a lil fun. Survivors teabag at gate why can't a killer close hatch in front of the survivor
---
This is first 10 minutes or Act I of Pilot Episode of what I have planned to be a 6 Episode (45 mins each) Season featuring Jake, Dwight, Claudette, Meg, Feng and ~~Entity~~ Nea with Trapper, Wraith, Nurse, Hillbilly and Doctor Herman Carter. Also Guest Appearence by Benedict Baker, Vigo and Alex.
---
More characters will be introduced in forthcoming Seasons. I am sort of following DBD's own year by year roadmap.
---
You waited 1 minute instead of taking a ds stun?
---
This is why. She provides a challenge. They don't want that.
---
The devs have said in previous streams they don‚Äôt mind farming. Plus that report will get discarded so no worries.
---
&gt;... And HG? Yuck. I didn't know that it's not always a good thing to kill lit totems. Probably still better to roll the dice, though, I'm assuming.
---
It depends! I know that's a shitty answer, but for now only cleanse lit totems if you know you'd under the effect of a hex effect (IE, hex ruin, a very popular hex perk!) . A noob trap in this game is to just do every lit toem you see, but if there's no negative hex effect, play it safe!
---
anyone knows how to do that?
---
because youtubers said so
---
Using sprint burst too much made me a worse survivor. I sat on gens until the killer got to me and sprint burst away sometimes killer doesnt even bother chasing sometimes it puts you in dangerous spots. Id rather just leave a gen early to get to a safe area and have balanced landing which makes certain loops infinite and sprint burst doesnt make loops infinite it just gives you a head start
---
Oh I thought you might be burnt out. Idk maybe you just don‚Äôt like the game much
---
As a killer main, thats toxic. Theres a reason why DS is a necessity to the game. I played as Steve and the amount of times I get tunneled after an unhook was grotesque. And the earlier this is done in game the more points you're denying the survivor/game time. 
---
Its a bit of a two way street though, if Claudette unhooks me in front of the killer shes effectively screwing me over if she doesn't have BT, and I don't have DS cause I don't have the perk unlocked and I hardly play survivor. 
---
That being said though if Claudette was being toxic, you do you.
---
Wow what a misleading title. This dude is clearly saying "we could be like every other company out there and be radio silent, but we're not like them, we told you why we couldn't meet the deadline and we're working on it getting it out ASAP."
---
Quit being a child, OP.
---
&gt; dodging a plagues corrupt purge is infinently easier than looping her
---
lmfao
---
thats not right though, there alot of situations where you should cleanse no matter what
---
Solidarity would basically just be an insta heal but u need to full heal someone 
---
Dark devotion would have basically no counterplay, currently, u see the obsession gets hit, if u know they have it, u can be prepared for the killer to sneak up
---
 flipflop converting 100% would be way too insane, 50% is good enough, but I think that when ur at max recovery(95% I think) it should fill 50% of the wiggle bar
---
Furtive chase would be pretty strong if it did it out of chase, simply for hooking people u could get close to no terror radius
---
I agree that camaraderie should apply to both hooked stages
---
2nd wind makes sense, u shouldnt just get a free heal, u need to do something, its supposed to motive players to help their teammates 
---
surge is bad, I agree
---
mindbraker isnt even that good, its supposed to help against sprint bursters but it just lets them keep the exhaustion at 99
---
New to DBD- what does the totems do?
---
Insta queues on the killer side for PS4! The survivor side can have 10-20 min waits sometimes unless there is a double blood point event and then it‚Äôs flipped...
---
found the bad survivor lol
---
And you will still get teabagged.See?Doesnt solve anything.
---
I had a game yesterday with survivors trying this, but getting to a corner that was too far from a hook for me to carry them without wiggling free. After I figured that out and they kept going back, I would just down them and leave them there. I had 2 downed in the same corner a couple times. It takes them out of commission for working on gens and requires another survivor to go help them. Ended that game with 3 kills and 1 DC. Might be a good strategy for a situation like the OP.
---
But then everyone DC's do you can't get hits :(
---
They‚Äôll teabag either way, may as well ruin their fun
---
Not for me survivors alone max 3mins and with party max 5 to 8
---
I open the game, check\trash my dailys, then close the game and open it again.  That usually gets them to either stay, or at least they change before I start playing.
---
When you hear the Michael's [lietmotif](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVyois9mp4) he just reached evil within level 3 and it's time to be super careful. When you hear it again, he ran out of juice and is sneakier but less lethal.
---
I've had more than one game when the first knowledge of the killer we were playing against was hearing that fucking music and it makes me panic every damn time. That's why I main him when I play killer!
---
What addon do u mean???
---
Oh that's sweet haha
---
you are the one who is apparently incapable of looping. but okay.
---
Just make sure the portraits are 350 by 350 and make sure they have a clear background, also make sure they're png's
---
yep, that's why they should do something about it
---
Wow okay! Thats cool.
---
I do the same thing
---
Repost because last one got removed for "unrelated content"

---
Look who is toxic now.
---
You had people running 4 anti-hook offerings and denying the killer of 1/3 of all hooks. It's not a niche reason.
---
You don't have to be an elite team to use Object. All you have to do is look at the killer and tell your friends who he is, hat he is and where he is going. That's not hard.
---
There are god tier SWF teams where Object is way more cancer to deal with, but they aren't every game. Even if they were 1% of the game, they would still suck to go against.
---
I once played a match where some shitty Pig camped her first victim via her usual position - hunched down in stealth in front of the hook watching them. I decided to camp the survivor alongside the Pig by crouching beside her in sync. I got messaged after the match (I expected a mean message despite the fact I didn‚Äôt even bother after they died as I have no interest in playing seriously against campers) and the camper survivor said they thought it was hilarious and screenshot-worthy what I did to mock that trash killer.
---
Yeah but at the same time you get benefits from it, a whole boatload of bloodpoints you otherwise might not have got. You're entitled to your opinion though and I'm not going to tell you to change it. :)
---
Obviously fake, dwight would have stolen that medkit.
---
Thanks.
---
They're random for everyone
---
So what? If they want to be toxic so be it. Play toxic games win toxic prizes.
---
Aw! Welcome to the community ^ ^
---
there‚Äôs 5 totems on the map. Sometimes the killers can have Hex totems which means one (unless they have more than one hex totem or haunted grounds) totem will be lit up by the candles. If the survivor breaks that said totem, that Perk will no longer be available to use for that killer in that specific game. 
---
For example Hex ruin. It makes skillchecks harder because you have to hit great skillchecks otherwise some of your progress goes back a little. Until you break that totem. Then the skillchecks are back to normal. 
---
There‚Äôs a couple Hex totems 
---
Hex: No one escapes death
---
Hex: devour hope
---
Hex: ruin
---
Hex: thrill of the hunt
---
Hex: haunted grounds 
---
And there‚Äôs prob one I‚Äôm missing. I suggest reading about them in the wiki for clearer information! Be careful in the fog!~ :D
---
I think you are severely overrating how much this matters
---
I think I like the latter one a bit more, I‚Äôm definitely not saying some perks shouldn‚Äôt be changed, just that it must be done carefully.
---
This makes no sense. The picture with the phrase. üò¨
---
Ffs I have a love hate relationships to these üòÇüòÇüòÇ goddamn it!
---
you best let me boop the snoot.
---
Well.. Tunneling an object is the only right thing to do. Nobody has any objections on that. 
---
 BUT the more u tunnel, the more gens pop up. And in the end you end up with only 1K, and 3 buddies of that object, teabagging at the exit gate.
---
 It definetly doesn't look like 4k that you was bragging about.
---
You don't, you just suffer cause he's clearly the best in the whole game and there's no obvious counter to him totally
---
Thank you! I appreciate it! :D glad I could help make your day a little bit better :3
---
How do you know a survivor is toxic before camping them?You dont.
---
Love that latency. It shows it hitting in mid air where your body would have been if you stayed.
---
Alright. That's good to know. Well, tbh, I'd rather have to game the system some than just know "kill all X whenever possible". Lots of food for thought today - thank you!
---
way too early Bub
---
Think about it, halloween event and 1 week after christmas event
---
Thanks! I will!
---
This is the reason I will never grind out to red ranks anymore because you still get facecamping twats and more braindead survivor randoms. Plus extra wait times! I‚Äôm happy in the green ranks.
---
So 1 now?
---
WHAT THE FUCK XD you must be the next level of a soulless husk do you see people enjoying life and go hmmmmm fuck them they should be as miserable as me I mean you must have a fucking stroke when you see people cosplay XD holy shit I can believe this I‚Äôm fucking dying I need to grow up for get this putting on a costume for Halloween!!! You know the holiday for putting on costumes and having fun!?!!? AHAHHAHAHAHAHAH holy shit your pathetic you‚Äôve shown your true colors real quick you went from uhhhhh I wasn‚Äôt insulting you to fucking saying I need to grow up for wearing a costume ON HALLOWEEN XD I can‚Äôt fucking breath you must be constantly having a panic attack seeing all the people on this sub Reddit who also are getting costumes ready for Halloween like HOW DARE THEY HAVE FUN WILE IM A SAD DEPRESSED DOUCH BAG EVERYONE SHOULD BE AS MISERABLE AS I AM like holy shit dude I guess everyone should be constantly sad and not have any fun because big mature Reddit boi says so this I Great I can‚Äôt breath
---
Also shouldn‚Äôt you be at work or studying or some shit rather then playing a video game and getting heated that someone wore a costume and miss used ‚ÄúYour‚Äù on Reddit XD
---
They all teabag in the gates anyway. Blame the toxic ones like you for ruining it for the regular players
---
:(
---
I'm sorry, I'll just go hide in some tall grass. 
---
( ‚úß‚âñ Õú ñ‚âñ)
---
Blame others for what Im doing.This is what you are saying basically.
---
no I'm not talking about ds plays
---
It makes sense, it just isn't remotely a big deal at all. You could cheese saves before by faking and then running through the hooked person's body because you didn't have collision with them but the killer did. Now they can hit you through that. It's basic balancing.
---
It was super fun, though
---
Is _that_ why the theme music kicks in? Shit, I never would have guessed. I thought it was like the Huntress, where it's just a really large radius effect. Yeah, I will definitely start paying more attention to that!
---
You should already know where you're gonna go next once you've dropped a pallet. Unless it was the only pallet or window in a country mile, you only need to hit the stun if it's an unsafe pallet. Better to drop early than get hit.
---
Doubly so when it's Huntress or Freddy or the Clown.
---
It's okay son. You know I do this because I love you.
---
You toxic survivors have made it necessary to use toxic strategies so yes, you are to blame for what strategies I‚Äôll employ in the future
---
Its a killer perk known as;
---
Hex: Noone Escapes Death, commonly known as NOED.
---
This perk activates when the exit gates are powered (not open but openable)
---
When the perk activates, one of the 5 hex totems in the map will at random become activated, indicated by a small fire burning underneath it.
---
While the totem is still active, the killer recieves a buff which increases their movement speed and causes their attacks to instantly down a survivor, even if on full health that they hit. 
---
You can find the lit totem on the map and break it to disable the perk or you can break all 5 totems on the map before the perk activates to prevent it activating at all.
---
Be aware NOED is not the only Hex perk and other common one is Ruin, and ocassionally Devour Hope or Third Seal. These all share the theme of interracting with totems and are disabled when broken. There is also a hex perk known as Haunted Grounds which is a trap and will curse survivors for a minute if it is broken by making the killer's attacks down them instantly.
---
ermmm stop getting triggered, you‚Äôre wasting your timeüòÇ. I‚Äôm under your skin and you‚Äôre pissed off it‚Äôs funny. Why do you let people get to you so quickly???
---
I agree with the statement, yet understand why killers DC after losing their ruin 10 seconds in game. Spawning is honestly an issue. Idk what a proper fix is, maybe have dull totems til like 30 seconds in game or some shit then the ruin totem activates idk. 
---
Or let the killer choose when he wants to activate ruin, rather then it start immediately.
---
They either tunnel the trapped survivors, or play with the survivors who boop her snoot. No in between.
---
My issue is that I do gens when I should be trying to help.
---
That literally makes no sense. It gives you more bloodpoints. It gives you an easy pip. It gives you one carefree match in between all the dc-sweaty-toxic-tryhard ones. If you‚Äôre one of the people who has an IsSuE with farming, might want to take a good hard look at why. If it‚Äôs such a big deal for you then dc and go to the next one. Let people have fun.
---
I think it doesn't make balance sense for the survivor to not have collision with a hooked survivor but a killer attack does. Either neither have collision or both do, and they chose the former.
---
Edit: should be 100%
---
Well I‚Äôm gonna post a game later showing it, if I can get a game with object.
---
Thankyou heaps! This is my first post in this subreddit and It honestly surprises me how toxic some people can be. It's really unfortunate that people are unable to get their point across without being aggressive.
---
Sabo survivor running flip flop, boil over, unbreakable:
---
Hold my beer!
---
Unicorn block makes you blind for a minute when you run over a snare, I think there's a cheaper version of it too.
---
If you don't know, blindness makes it so you can't see the killer with OoO but the killer can still see you.
---
It's hard to pip as Billy if you saw people.
---
\^\^' I just made and post a meme with him inside, right after this one ahah so..
---
How is this connected to your statement about 97% swfs being bad? Survivors never got actually nerfed. Devs only fixed obviously broken things. There were some nerfs, but way less than killers had. 
---
Calling anything in game that is broken is a silly position. Then why nerf or buff anything? Let's revert game's balance back to 2016 so everyone would be having a challenge, right? Old Mori, Old Nurse, Old infinites, Old Exhaustion. 
---
I find it amusing how you give zero argumentation on that bullshit you are saying and just call me bad. Don't want to waste my time on you, trying to explain you anything. You are hopeless, good luck with playing in fantasy where SWFs are not OP.
---
Yeah thank you, I have figured it out by myself, google is my friend ;)
---
I'm already doing the pack :)
---
Oh those add-ons are so bad that I didn't even remember it
---
You‚Äôll rarely win trying to get kills with RBT‚Äôs, and even if you get a 4K with Tombstone, you likely won‚Äôt pip, which is technically still a loss, so no, they are not viable
---
Believe it or not, but I didn't actually see him in the bush until he started running üòÇ
---
XD holy shit so you stalk my profile to look something g to insult me with over a post you disagree with and now your acting like the big man on campus? Christ you swap back and forth between ‚Äúdude I‚Äôm just trolling you lol‚Äù and ‚ÄúGRRRR HOW DARE YOU HAVE FUN‚Äù so fast like I call you out and you go ah shit how am I supposed to respond to this? So you jump right back and switch tactics for the love of god please just shut up I make a suggestion you respond with something stupid that I correct you on you have a panic attack so you go to my profile to look for something to use against me and start ranting about someone wearing a costume on Halloween seriously like how far off topic did we get I tell you off and disprove your whole STBFL would suck argument and you never respond to that because you couldn‚Äôt so you turn to goof old tactic of insulting the person over and over again
---
&gt;It's only a small team of devs
---
No they're not.
---
&gt;They just want to try and make the game the best they can for the community
---
They just want to rip as much money as they can from the community while working as least as possible
---
FTFY
---
1) The problem with those perks is that they are only useable one time, (in a chase). Good killers will just wait for you to waste dead hard and then hit you, and let‚Äôs be real, not a lot of people are gonna run non-meta perks like Resilience at high ranks. Iron Will and Adrenaline however are very good alternatives to SC, even if Adrenaline doesn‚Äôt help you before endgame.
---
2) The problem is you if you are not waiting at the hooks to get healed (if the killer isn‚Äôt near) or don‚Äôt want to get healed any other time that is convenient. However, when 3 claudettes self-care simultaneously at corners of the map (which I‚Äôve never seen happen btw), they are just very bad at the game, it‚Äôs not a question of what perk they use at that point. If they didn‚Äôt have self-care, those types of players would probably just hide in the corners nonetheless.
---
3) You‚Äôre right on that point, but sometimes a killer will come before a survivor does, and if you‚Äôre already injured, you‚Äôre just giving the killer easy pressure. (Unless you‚Äôre a god at looping).
---
4) People that self-care in corners, as you mentioned previously are very likely noobs and have no idea how it was back in 2017. They don‚Äôt know that it was super strong before, so they think it‚Äôs really good now. Youtubers that use self-care use it well (for those who have some experience at least). Obviously that skill doesn‚Äôt transfer to you once you watch them use it.
---
While I agree people using SC the wrong way is frustrating, using it the right way can turn the tide in a game, trust me.
---
Dbd was fun?
---
Also sorry for sounding like an asshole I‚Äôm not trying to be this is just how I type in these long over drawn paragraphs and shit
---
Or if 3 run that and the 4th runs a swamp offering.
---
Well of course he‚Äôs similar, except Freddy tele‚Äôs between gens, put dreamsnares and fake pallets, and needs targets to be asleep for any of said powers to work
---
Jason doesn‚Äôt need sleepy survivors
---
1. The odds of getting a kill with a RBT with pig is so minimal you would have to giref just 1 player hoping they die while 3 others leave
---
2. Tombstone piece is the only good addon, and it's more for fun than it is viable for ranking
---
Nah I don‚Äôt fell like it
---
As someone who (tries) to main Legion in the higher ranks, Thanatophobia honestly isn‚Äôt even worth it most of the time. While it‚Äôs true that he‚Äôs one of the better killers to run it on, it‚Äôs still a weak perk at the end of the day. You have to take the time to injure all survivors ASAP, and that‚Äôs actually more difficult than it seems against survivors who understand legion. The duration of frenzy isn‚Äôt very long without good addons, and if survivors know what they‚Äôre doing, they run in opposite directions as soon as they see you. Even after the first hit, you often don‚Äôt have enough time to reach the next player before it runs out, especially if they start window looping or something when you finally get there. This leads to some games taking a pretty long time to even get thantophobia online, and by the time you do, they‚Äôve usually got a gen or two done anyway, since it doesn‚Äôt punish skill checks like ruin, and good players are hitting those left and right. I‚Äôve found something like barbecue or discordance to be a more useful perk overall, as being able to stop people stacking on gems and distracting two survivors at a time usually saves you more time than thanatophobia would in the long run. STBFL, Ruin, Discordance, and Sloppy or even Infectious Fright has been a much more successful load out for me on Legion. It just feels like in 90% of the games, Thanatophobia doesn‚Äôt make a big enough difference on him to be worth it.
---
You know killing all survivors without camping is a thing right?I guess you arent good enough to do that.Instead of being a better man and rise above the toxicity you go even lower than them.And then you blame the survivors for it.I have not seen such a level of hypocrisy in a long time.
---
No worries! Hope you have a wonderful day! :D
---
Then the survivor gets mad at you for ‚Äútunneling‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing toxic‚Äù
---
Oh, as someone who lived through sabo meta and pallet vaccum, I'm having a blast rn
---
Instadowns all have counterplay. I think thats the real annoying part for instaheals for me that i cant do anything about it.
---
Mmm, three gen plague...
---
This sub, and pretty much any platform for DBD, has a heavy bias toward one side of the playerbase. The comment sections on posts like this one really showcase it. It's okay to be toxic if you're playing Killer. Take out your frustration from past games on unrelated players! Punish them for using certain perks and items! Camp them because they looped you! But the exact second a survivor complains about anything, it's "LOL ENTITLED SURVIVORS RULEBOOK LOLOLOL"
---
Ideally, neither side should be acting like dickheads. But this game is always going to be stuck in a loop of both sides punishing each other. And to be clear, stuff like this video isn't even the end of the world. It's just poor sportsmanship, same for teabagging. A pointless way to gloat when you've already won. It'll piss you off for a few minutes but then you move on to the next game.
---
A scary perk to get in your bloodweb indeed.
---
Cause myers is best man
---
How did you get no one lives forever when the acronym is NOED?
---
Ok.
---
Haha yea one game I started and as soon as I hit the first guy, the other 3 dced and abused me in chat so bad, I enjoyed reporting them all üòÇ
---
Welp guess I should have guessed I would be bombarded by people attacking me and shit for one simple change this is just great
---
I try to mix it up. I like to pick perks that surprise the survivors and make it interesting for me.
---
I find that killers start getting shitty after rank 10. But I dont know how to keep my rank in the 10 to 12 region without just screwing over my team by doing absolutely nothing.
---
_Ara ara_ Dwight-kun-- no wait come baaack~! Your onee-chan Steve needs his Second-wind!
---
Campus, awww Lil American kid. RAWR
---
15 minutes from now
---
I just want to draw a hentai pic with this beads but I‚Äôm not an artist
---
I'm getting really sick of the main perks all the killers use ESPECIALLY LEGION and PLAGUE
---
Iv seen worse, try fortnite haha
---
Camping serves a purpose-teabagging doesn‚Äôt. So I‚Äôm gonna do what they did to me- make them want to stop playing the game. I just 4ked as Bubba campingvthe basrment against a 4 man swf with DS. Survivors don‚Äôt get to have fun anymore- blame yourselves
---
Sorry lack of sleep. No one escapes death. Lol
---
Newbie here also, I don't play killer yet but I know they get a notification when you fail a normal skill check on a generator, do they get a notification when you get a "good" skill check instead of a great one when the hex is on it, or still only when you miss the skill check altogether?
---
Wtf who the fuck are you like now we have you going after me calling you big man on campus a very common phrase like what????? And RAWR what are you??? Like imagine hang American as an insult XD
---
True
---
Beautiful response. I agree with all your points.
---
Normally when I explain my opinion about selfcare, I just get flooded with downvotes and gamers saying "selfcare good ugg ugg".
---
Mhmm. As I said, I will play these games.
---
They did give an answer....
---
&gt; If you wanted the game over you should have chased one and hooked him then used Freddy‚Äôs gen teleport you get right back and apply pressure.
---
Not the guy you were talking to, but OBS is free and pretty much *the* go to screen recording program for streamers and youtubers and stuff.
---
Far more likely to assume Head On, in my opinion.
---
I receive messages every other match killer or survivor even had someone trying to hack my ip never got that in fortnite must be the way I play survivor and guess people just hate killers ü§£
---
At least top 3
---
Hear*
---
I love eirri
---
Hear
---
If your strategy of protecting gens isnt working, then yeah it's not smart.
---
Survivors teabag to trigger snowflakes like you.Seems it is working considering how salty you are.You have insulted everyone here who disagreed with you.You are a huge hypocrite.Uou can have the last word.I do not care.Besides enjoy grey ranks since that is the only place where facecamping actually works.
---
Yea in general blindness isn't the best agreed. That doesn't excuse the fact that it turns OoO back to the survivor and makes them easy pickings.
---
Tbh dbd does have a toxic community but r/deadbydaylight is probably one of the most helpful communities. üòÇ
---
Self care literally encourages you to throw the game and if you use it you can‚Äôt be mad if you don‚Äôt win or rank up. And I put that on jesus
---
Thanks for your stranger things trailer music video ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I mean, they‚Äôre all actually pretty balanced, sometimes people complain about them because they can‚Äôt deal with them, but the only one I hear a lot of complains about is like noed
---
Thanks, but I don't think it's good enough to post as one days content is what I meant!
---
Kay. Another thing that I disagree with humanity.
---
If they DC, it means hey left the game, but not the session, which aloows them to spectate and talk after game.
---
Don‚Äôt die trying to use the perk
---
The mindgame is people don't want to be hit by ds, because it feels bad, and when you play hyper-aggressive and jump in lockers, they will think you have DS.
---
meh
---
So I watch Tru3talent like what are you literally searching through my posts desperately looking for anything to use against me I also watch Otz does that mean Something because with your god tier logic it should right but no for some reason your now attacking me for watching a streamer I find entertaining for being American for wearing costumes on Halloween and more like please shut up like imagine being this pathetic taht you have to keep harassing some random person on the internet while searching through their profile for stuff to use against them XD I don‚Äôt even watch Tru3 that I‚Äôm just defending him from idiots who harass him for no reason because I‚Äôm a decent human something you clearly aren‚Äôt
---
Normally I run Head On, Dance With Me, DS and Quick and Quiet.
---
I try and be a helpful teammate while still having fun.
---
Sorry if I get upset when I get partnered with unhelpful teammates, whose ideas of fun are holding M1 for 40 seconds in a dark corner.
---
Devs bad upvotes to the left
---
It should really just work like overcharge where if you let go it stays on the screen till you miss or hit it.
---
Love it when ur accused of tunnelling even though u have hooked 1 or 2 pple by the time the initial guy is unhooked or of camping when all 3 other survivors r running around ur hook in a circle keeping u in the area
---
If you've got nothing left, you might as well. Locker dodging a hit a couple of times is fun and buys you a few seconds. When you are trying to buy the other survivors more time to finish the gens, even a couple extra seconds can make the difference.
---
General reposti
---
Head On+Inner strength
---
No you said mental gymnastics. You‚Äôre a leech of tru3ta1ent. No wonder you don‚Äôt have your own opinion on any topic
---
Stalking the killer! What kind of idiot killer would look behind them? That way you can find the hatch too! 
---
_a Blendette in the chat_
---
Farming is a big waste of time unless there are at least 3 BPS.  Even then, playing normally can net the same result.  Play hard early to guarantee hooks before a gen rush gets out of hand.  Then focus on capping all categories.
---
I met a pink hair/face-mask Nea with the steam name 'Karen' a few days back. After the match was over they told me I was very rude for killing them and that they wanted to speak to my manager.
---
Yeah, 4 is a lot. I don't think I have ever been hit by more than 2 of new DS.
---
no matter what rank you are, the insidous basement bubba will always be there
---
This makes me upset
---
No, it‚Äôs ‚Äúrisk giving up the gen to go for a down.‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs your option to change the outcome.
---
They're great which is why I shared some of their content here on this sub
---
They probably expected not to waste their money. Games on the switch are expensive and hold their value.  If they're making this game mobile, they should be able to fix the switch version. Hell they should be able to fix any console version. With a team of 500 they should be able to overhaul this game. Have a dedicated team rewriting the damn code to a more coherent state starting from scratch, testing and retesting, not making it live until it's better.
---
Ok so now Tru3 made up the word mental gymnastics???  Like what that‚Äôs aways been a term buddy Tru3 didn‚Äôt create it you fucking disappointment
---
Have you been living under a rock? They're working on the dedicated servers (which everyone here swore would fix this issue) and constantly rolling out mini tests of them
---
I didn‚Äôt facecamp before this moment, I just 4ked by facecamping literally everyone as bubba lmao. No survivors get to have fun anymore, either facecamp bubba or prayer beads spirit from now on
---
Mm, fair enough, but from my experience, it‚Äôs easier to worry about yourself over others because people are rarely so altruistic lol. Personally, I only run team based/altruism builds when I‚Äôm playing with people I know.
---
It‚Äôs as though he didn‚Äôt read the messages or is purposefully misunderstanding them.
---
What is BBQ?  
---
And I see notes for "Shrine of Secrets". Is that in the top level menu or somewhere else?
---
Of course, only the truest of intellectuals use le reddit. Facebook is for normies. I watch Rick and Marty btw.
---
I live the chibi ones he makes have you seen his gf cosplay so fucking on point
---
First of its not a word, this is why I preach that education is important, it‚Äôs a phrase. But anyway I was right, you lost the argument now you‚Äôre crying. Let alone I think your parents are disappointed that you‚Äôre dressing up in Halloween costumes alone in your bathroom.
---
Hey OP, what type of color blind are you?
---
Also, love the memes, but why this choice?
---
I don‚Äôt want to come across as rude, I‚Äôm genuinely curious.
---
I only have so many healing kits, though.....
---
That feeling when.
---
25% &gt; 8%
---
Its not like that, The killer deadass stared me as as Doc on hook, Standing perfectly still camping my ass after I looped him for two generators. When my teammates tried to save me, He grabbed them off in Treatment mode and kept staring at me.
---
MYC I bet
---
1 million percent make your choice
---
Well, if I had more time/money I would make a better job. You should think more about the people feelings. At least I had the guts to make it and post it online
---
I feel like it was designed for that. Your injured and see a teammate so in order to survive you lead the killer to them
---
Oh my god are you actually attempting to now attack ever single slip up I do XD please shut the fuck up you fucking cunt oH iTs A PhRASe hhahjahahahahah i SuRe GoT hiM iM a GenIuS aNd tOtalLy nOt aN IDiOtIc cUnT
---
Dota community. Toxic racists. Here just toxic
---
Me running empathy, We‚Äôll make it, and We‚Äôre gonna live forever, chasing someone I unhooked
---
You just say the same things over and over again.You dont even reply to me.
---
We can't even get double bloodpoints for Halloween day at least?! Just nothing and a last minute cancellation...
---
If I hear another "just use x lol" comment I'm gonna start dieing inside. That doesn't help with totems.
---
"What does it dooooooo?"
---
I've posted some of the chibis but did not see the cosplay!
---
OMG you‚Äôre so triggered, why are you cursing like a docket, Jesus Christ I‚Äôve upset you. Just because you‚Äôre mentally deficient it‚Äôs okay. If your only comeback is to swear then so be it.
---
Because you‚Äôre saying nothing of importance. You think it‚Äôs bad for me to be toxic but fine for them to be when they‚Äôre the ones who forced me to do ot
---
I think it's funny that everyone is talkin shit to you about things they don't know about. I actually know someone who will disconnect the killer from the match if they're playing like a huge piece of shit. Facecamping? Disconnected. Slugging some one then walking around on top of them until they bleed out instead of just playing the game normally? Disconnected. We get our points and the killers gets a big fat 0 and a depip. He won't DC the killer for a fair game and he won'tdo it just becausehe'sthe last alive. I've legit only ever seen him do it to people for playing in a way that actually is against the basic rules of the game. Things that the devs refuse to ban for even though trolling and unsportsmanlike conduct is specifically against the basic rules of the game. Which is ironic because what he's doing is more against the rules than what the shitty people are doing but I feel that at least he's doing it for a better purpose since nothing is being done to punish those who are intentionally going out of their way to ruin the game for other people. 
---
This is an actual thing that can happen. I ain't saying names but I can tell you OP that I have no idea who that survivor was.
---
Oh cool I've been doing it backwards.
---
I searched for you and tried to find you but I couldn‚Äôt ^ ^
---
If you ever learn how to add others (google is your best friend!) you can find me if you search on ‚ÄúDetective Cookieh‚Äù. I usually have my pig cosplay as profile picture :D
---
Trapper looks like a dog lol
---
Iron will + adrenaline is only good if your team does gens.
---
In a slow game irmt can be really detrinental
---
Insta-heals do work, but it still has to be 1 full bar
---
I disagree. In real world, when you pull something down, it is very easy for another person to touch you first and then get hit by the thing you pulled down. The fact that pallets have a slight delay is an important part of the game. If anything, it‚Äôs the lag and unstable servers makes the interaction inconsistent.
---
Wat
---
no problem mate!
---
Please learn you‚Äôre and your I cba to keep correcting you. ‚ÄúCock gobbling‚Äù,  I‚Äôm not gay but why would you use that in an insult, very homophobic, is that how your mum raised you? To try discriminate people based on their race, religion, sexuality.... shows the type of person you are
---
Sorry. Only devs bad allowed here, nevermind that it would make no sense for them to purposefully make a bad product since this game is their income and theres stuff they're doing that shows they're obviously trying to make a good product.
---
Great information! Thank you! I'll keep an eye out!
---
And on the side of the preschool a ton
---
I only dc if a killer moris the first player they down.
---
Pretty sure that would kills the game
---
ahahah quite a bit yeah \^\^' poor Daddy :( At least, he's a happy doggo :p
---
If you‚Äôre using ruin, bbq, nurses, noed or any such op perk. I‚Äôm disconnecting.
---
Why do people bully my boy doctor
---
Dark devotion is pretty good in my opinion, it is very nice to get grabs and to snowball. It also has no cooldown, and it helps to chase multiple survivors.
---
ive heard that the "slightly", "moderately", and "considerably" words actually represent percentages can anyone give me those percentages?
---
You ruin people's games that you dont actually know if they are toxic or not.Do what you will.Im done.
---
The reason why he‚Äôs really weak is bec even when you shock a person they still vault or throw down pallets , well he‚Äôs a doctor he‚Äôs meant to be annoying 
---
About the one shot idea yeah looks good survivors will still complain amber of insta heal nerfs , maybe if you give them madness 4 for one shots
---
Im a killer main. If I see a survivor saving his teammate of hook infront of me, I will let the teammate go and hunt the cunt who tried to sell his friend out
---
If you are toxic survivor, I will be toxic back
---
Dont chase too long
---
just use x lol
---
GLORF
---
I bet that dying light will be in there
---
I've tried to play with the outfit for the ones where it was possible.
---
I've also reworked the plague in the pack i'm doing right now :)  
---
But for the pig I hesitate to modify it, idk, maybe I'll do 2 choices :)

Oops I forgot your in the UK home of over offended pansies that will arrest you for ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù for a joke if that gets you heated then you‚Äôd have a seizure if you heard what I say to my gay friend I say shit to him that would probably make you go into cardiac arrest and he just insults me right back because he‚Äôs not a pussy like you XD
---
If you main killer get pop goes the weasel before the reset today!
---
No you need a 2 pip, so the lowest standard is 2 golds and 2 iri depending on rank.  Just play the game normally but try get 3 hooks on everyone and let no one escape, then you should be fine. But don‚Äôt camp and shit like that
---
If I can carry a survivor into the basement, I will, even if I have to ignore a closer hook.
---
The basement is my domain and there is a bloody price of admission for intruders. (Payment is usually extracted by the bear trap I leave at the bottom of the stairs.)
---
Expect the event in november unless they say otherwise.
---
I can tell you some killer signs. If you‚Äôre last survivor, don‚Äôt struggle. Just guarantees death. If you‚Äôre lucky they may smack the air when they get you, thats them telling you to stop. (Could be for hatch) if a killer stands still and let‚Äôs you escape, don‚Äôt run. They‚Äôre trying to let you exist
---
Have u seen overwatches
---
Don‚Äôt tell me he‚Äôs not an asshole. He is.  Doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt have good insights and knowledge of the game.  But make no mistake about it, the gentleman is an asshole.
---
But... You're not dad bot...
---
This right here. I watched a survivor bully a Wraith relentlessly through tbags, instaheal in chase and the likes. At the end of the game the killer was face camping him but still allowed me to unhook, tunneled and face camped him again.
---
i expected on may 2020
---
The only way to get this glitch to occur is have someone switch to killer and ready up really fast in KYF. That is not possible in SWF (the button isn't there) or Killer play. 
---
Please stop baiting people. I posted the same glitch sometime ago.
---
Were you sawing people? Or just m1-ing?
---
&gt; I make sure to never bring them as survivor.
---
I don't really bring anything as survivor except for the occasional medkit to use on teammates and my inventories are huge lol
---
Well PPAP is going to be in my head for the rest of the day now, thanks.
---
The logic here is flawed. 2 killers would be extremely OP. SWFs can still be 4k'd you just have to change up your approach.
---
Can I just point out the plague look hella fly in a suit and tie xD
---
I would love to see this on Netflix!
---
Survivors are never fans of evening the playing field.
---
I like to run Ruin and Thanatophobia on Freddy with some perks to help in chases/tracking and Dream slowdown add-ons--slows the game down enough to where you have a much better chance at 3- or 4k'ing and not losing within the first 6 minutes.
---
I understand their relatively new. But the differences in gameplay are black and white. Resilience which is the most underrated perk in the game atm is completely broken with the lag between players. Tbh I'd prefer it going back to P2P so I can at least gauge what I'm getting myself into.
---
I was playing solo...
---
BBQ and Nurses OP.
---
hahahaha
---
Don't disconnect, you're the problem with this game, not the perks (for the most part).
---
I play solo survivor so i usually have a medkit or toolbox cus I typically cant rely on others to help get anything done.
---
doesn't look like it. it's getting worse all the time.
---
No, you weren't. You were in KYF with other players.
---
This is on r/memes
---
This other dude was acting like adrenaline was unpreventable when it is.
---
I love huntress as a killer but her hatchets' hit boxes are the biggest bullshit thing in the entire game
---
LET ME RUN TO THE CORNER OF THE MAP FIRST
---
Straight up sawing people with an instasaw build. Zoom zoom from hook to gen or whatever direction they were walking towards.
---
Just use x lol
---
But there would be even less players, when more people would stop playing, because dcler made it unattractive.
---
Whatever.
---
Late reply, but the addons/items they had are very annoying to go against.
---
I get that part of it, I mean basically from the start even at lower ranks, my intention when entering a loop is to just waste time while teammates do gens. If I can get 2-3 gens to pop for one hook, that's easily a trade I'm willing to take. The problem is when I spend all this time looping, and even high rank killers I can loop well since it's essentially a solved game in terms of what tiles are safe with what pallets and just going from tile to tile, but even at high ranks my teammates are struggling with shit like ruin.
---
I mean I'll often get hooked and see 2 teammates searching for ruin instead of just powering through it and hoping they stumble upon it later. So I get hooked after a 2 minute chase and like 3-4 pallets wasted(maybe more depending on the killer), and we literally have nothing to show for it.
---
This is a consistent thing that happens basically every game now. Either that or they just can't stay in a chase long enough for any meaningful gen progression to get done and the pressure is on us survivors from the start of the game, and like 99% of red rank killers will take that pressure and snowball into an easy 4k.
---
OoO instaheal meta is very stupid right now.
---
Dont heal, do gens, if you go down someone instaheals you, if you get chased you have dead hard dstrike and everyone else has BT. 
---
Impossible to get mindgamed because OoO sees all, impossible to get ambushed because OoO sees all, Impossible to be caught in deadzone because OoO will call out where everyone goes and what pallets get broken. 
---
Literally the only killer that OoO doesnt work on is spirit because spirit is also fun fair and balanced
---
Its so bad Ive taken to run Franklins to make survivors drop their instaheals

First Legion teasers were November 21st and 22nd. So we could potentially start getting hints within the next 3ish weeks.

---
&gt; Longer &amp; more fun games = profit
---
This is just too long imo
---
I've learned alot more about the game ever since I made this comment lmao
---
There‚Äôs a difference between banter and insulting someone. If you‚Äôre imaginary gay friend knew you would always use gay to insult people he‚Äôd probably start getting annoyed.  Plus you do come from the US where you‚Äôre all triggered SJWs. ‚ÄúSorry I forgot to ask for your pronouns, please don‚Äôt sew me‚Äù . But if you think it‚Äôs fine to discriminate people then that‚Äôs not funny, you can‚Äôt call anyone a pussy as you dress up to go trick or treating, you‚Äôre roughly 5ft 2, and look like you weigh 45kg. You‚Äôd get fucked by my little sister.
---
you don't wanna play 45 minute long trials match after match? haha scrub /s
---
I totally get it at endgame. What else are they supposed to do? Hook someone then, go to the gate the people leave or are unhooking your one kill, you try to go find them, they body block and now you have zero. Why would you not protect the thing you have end game. Your job is to kill.
---
Good gtfo loser
---
So the game sounded like it didn't go amazing for you. I'm not sure how many survivors were alive at this point so I'll just assume 3 of them were still up. When this happens you basically just have to accept that there is no realistic way you're going to get all 3 by just gen protecting. You can't compete with their micro management if they just keep trying to pull you away. They are eventually just going to get one done. What I would suggest is probably just getting 1 down and then maybe use them as bait and hope the rest of the team is altruistic and mess up. Your chances of getting all 3 are extremely low so you just have to take what you can get. I think the only way you can get away with the strategy you were trying to go for is if you're playing a insta down killer or there's only 2 survivors up. Hope that helps!
---
Makes sense. I just hadn‚Äôt see this until now xd
---
It is possible only in KYF. Have a Killer selected and other survivors in the game. Have a predetermined person switch and then ready up at the same time. You will load in with two killers. I am 70% sure you can get up to 4 killers.
---
I refuse to believe this is a serious comment.
---
I commissioned it from a mask maker online
---
It‚Äôs bannable so I wouldn‚Äôt try it.
---
Why do you keep insulting me?Does it make you feel better?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna be playing red dead redemption as soon as that comes out. Dbd really dropped the ball on this.  Oof imagine not being able to do an event for your mildly popular game.
---
To be fair, the Tome is coming out soon and that should help alleviate the BP grind somewhat
---
Just calling you what you are

Have you seen rocket league? Both are up at the top

If someone‚Äôs camping as Ghostface, they‚Äôre playing him the exact opposite way he should be played.

Sad oink :(

Campers usually don‚Äôt know how to play soooo
---
Very good!
---
Jesus. You can assume legion has discordance. Be wary of doing gens with others. When hes running at you, hes only going to hit you with the frenzy attack which hits you with that bleed timer. Chances are if anyone else is within range hes gonna bolt to them. Mend and get right back on the gen. His frenzy tracking of survivors is limited to his add ons, so note that if he cant see anyone else he will continue to chase you until he can down you. They you'll just run them like a normal killer.
---
I recommend watching a 'how to play legion's tutorial. You'll learn more about their weaknesses  and strengths as well as add ons that way.

**KEYS**
---
Either remove keys or rework them entirely. Make it so Skeleton Keys are the only keys that can open a hatch, but they require an addon to do so, and only one person can escape unless another addon is used that allows the hatch to stay open for 30 seconds (to help people who are achievement hunting).
---
Dull key should have one of the aura reading addons built in to give it a new use. Broken key stays the same, requiring addons to function at all. 
---
This makes it less likely to loot a key since you need to use Ace in the hole (and most likely Plunderer's Instinct as well), and even if you do use both of those perks, you can't let the whole team escape (since you'd require the use of two addons to let the whole team escape). You'd have to actively bring a key which gives the killer a chance for counter play.
---
**DECISIVE STRIKE**
---
The DS timer should go down faster if you start working on a gen after being unhooked (since you're not actually getting tunneled), and run out entirely if the killer hooks another person. It's a 60 second invincibility perk for survivors at its current state and I think most killers have had games where they hook another survivor, kick a pallet and a gen, chase the DS for a bit, pick them up and.... still get hit by DS. It's ridiculous.
---
That‚Äôs me.  I‚Äôm one of those.  You‚Äôre talking about me.
---

"power could be water control"

Great, bring Aquaman into DBD, that would be great.

Well if they're doing something to fix it what is saying "they need to fix it" going to do? They're already trying.
---
Why do you think Im a loser?Did we play?Did you win the argument?
---
David King next killer confirmed.
---
Lol even with him being cheaper still doesn‚Äôt make him worth it
---
I think it'd be neat if full stacks removed your terror radius in a chase entirely
---
To be fair the Jason x mask is a lot more complicated than a rabbit mask
---
I‚Äôd like to see maps (realms, not items) rebalanced, beyond that I think most of the busted survivor stuff has been nerfed. Maybe tune down toolboxes a little bit. 
---
On killer side I‚Äôd rework/nerf ebony moris, iri heads, insta saw on Billy, and most of Spirit‚Äôs add ons. I think most other stuff is fine.
---
Just don‚Äôt post them all the time, don‚Äôt get that burnout because I live these

I remembered when Sab was permanent and people will sab all the hooks, then do the gens, then go, and every killer has to have iron grasp
---
Wtf Made you assume that. I'm Down with farming idc. But that is something i've heard often from people not wanting to farm.
---
You must be a very judgemental person
---
Yea, people have the mistaken idea that the commonly seen version of farming is reportable. It's not and that's on BHVR for not clarifying.
---
Let's be real, BHVR doesn't like or condone it but they don't punish for it unless it has one of the following:
---
* Botting automated behavior. Using 3rd party software to play the game for you is always bannable.
---
* Farming at the expense of another player. Of someone doesn't want to farm the other players can't 'punish' them. That becomes a subset of griefing. 
---
And that's it.

Everyone lets shirtless David live.
---
Oh, sorry, I should expect HALLOWEEN event ON NOVEMBER, IT MAKES SENSE

Also Haunted Grounds, but no one runs that one ever because it's garbage.
---
Go ahead and cleanse Hex Totems whenever you see them. Especially if the killer is chasing someone and hasn't hit them yet, that's the best time to cleanse totems.
---
Bringing a hex perk is a gamble. If you bring it in, you have to be prepared for worst case scenario.
---
If you can stand the lobby wait.   Have a pause-able and/or portable game to enjoy as well on the side, because your wait time to play time will be massively skewed towards WAIT.
---
How? It's probably just a tiny bit more plastic because the rabbit mask is a half mask but it still has those ears. The one I was quoting was a lower poly version and the materials were the major cost. Even abs plastic was expensive though.
---
i play really fair so that everyone can have as much playtime as possible even if it costs me the match, but if you instaheal, oh boy are you in trouble now
---
Multiplayer is still active, I was able to get into matches multiple times no problem this past couple weeks.

It's just what flavor of bs we looking at today? Dont get mad, get NOED.
---
They might aswell scrap it at this point
---
You nailed the D strike issue. I didn't want to bring it up bc I said I play more killer which would just open up the don't tunnel attacks. But you summed it up perfectly. At this point survivors are using it as an invincibility perk to do something like a gen right in the killers face or brazenly jumping into a locker and daring you to grab them.
---
Wait, you mean you don't like the same low effort meme templetes every day?
---
Memeless mode doesn't even work because people don't bother to tag/flair their shitposts.

Hmmm. It would be more original than just super strenght and Machete no?
---
Really? What rank are you at?

Lets decide.You vs everyone else.Even killer mains disagreed with you.

I agree but Its nothing like the real thing afterall.

Yes, they do.

Also about being fucked by your little sister DAMN RIGHT
---
Well the design for it is still a bit mor complicated, but there's also the fact that people are more likely to recognize that mask so maybe they're pricing it up since they know it's popular. When I think of it the material would be the main cost but you could always use a shit material for it so I don't know man maybe they don't like you

---
Yea he‚Äôs super predictable, too.
---
I think territorial is good depending on the killer/build. Territorial on bubba or on the demogorgon are good if they run a basement build.
---
Nope, you see the husk because you're not physically there anymore like Freddy.
---
Strong Protanomaly, my reds are extremely weak to the point where the default killer auras are essentially invisible on any sufficiently dark background or object.
---
And you don't come across as rude, don't worry! I'm just trying to get some visibility on the issue due to how consistently people question BHVR about the possibility of some colorblind options (even relatively minor ones like just letting us change the color of the default killer aura from deep red to a magenta or cyan so it's not borderline invisible for those who are red weak) and either get no response at all or a boilerplate "we'll consider it" response. People have been requesting the feature since 2016 and I think I've only seen a BHVR rep respond once in that time with "I'll forward it to the team" back in, I wanna say 2017 (?) and nothing else ever came of it.

I have a real weakness for Hangman's Trick, I love the flavour, the effect and the weirdly unique part where it buffs another killer in a weird case of teachable cross-killer synergy.

---
I could say that quick and quiet is just as useless and bad for the team because u r probably gonna hide in a locker during a chase and 1 of 2 things will happen, either it works and the killer then goes and chases someone else off a gen or they open the locker and get a insta down and hook and then someone has to leave a gen and come save u
---
If it‚Äôs a swf or some toxic fucks e.g OoO and click click. I will slug the fuck out of them.

there is nothing wrong with ruin or devour hope.

noed is fun for shits and giggles with an endgame build, but outside of that its kinda dumb.
---
Spirit is fun to play against but if I had to go against prayer beads Spirit 10 games in a row or any other killer..I would pick another killer.
---
Spirit just becomes grating after a while especially with potato teammates. Let me go solo against anyone else.

Even one kind voice is enough to make a real person on the other side of the screen feel like their time was not wasted

I don‚Äôt know if decisive strike should work or not when puddle grabbed.
---
Monstrous Shrine. Right now, it makes them lose 10.8 seconds of hook time *only in basement*. 
---
How to buff: make it apply the basement and X random hooks in the map (like event hooks from that one event). 
---
If all hooks got the effect it might be too powerful
---
I doubt it was because it was popular. These guys were fancy. The quotes were automatic and I basically uploaded my object and from there it would automatically quote me a price and it was like 300 dollars. They would print you masks in whatever material you want though resin, plastic, metal. I think they are too high grade for just ordering one piece.
---
Yeah, I agree with that. He‚Äôs one of two killers you can actually justify it on, it‚Äôs just unfortunately a lot more work to set up and maintain than it ends up being worth in most games. There are only a handful of games I‚Äôve played with it where I felt like it actually had a meaningful impact, and that‚Äôs generally due to the survivors in those games playing subpar to begin with. It‚Äôs a cool perk and one I‚Äôd like to see buffed to be a bit more useable, either by pumping up the numbers a bit, or maybe adding a reduction to good and great skill checks for each injured survivor as well. Maybe 0.5% less bonus progression on skillchecks for each injured person? Maybe that‚Äôs too strong, but it would actually make survivors want to heal against legion, which could help him a lot.
---

Ah DbD hypocrisy at its finest.
---
As killer, get my BBQ stacks and then have fun. I generally don‚Äôt care if people escape. I just want to have some good chases and enjoy the round so everyone can get points.
---
As survivor, try to do a little bit of everything. Do a gen, get a safe unhook, interact with the killer at some point.

---
I don‚Äôt know man. The fact that camping killers can make their way to higher ranks means survivors did a bad job punishing camping. Because it is easy to farm your teammates immediately after they are hooked and rank up without understanding what they are doing is wrong, camping killers can also get away with camping without knowing his/her strategy is suboptimal if survivors played it wisely. I would say it‚Äôs a failure of the rank system that makes skill gaps smaller and smaller.

I will tunel a survivor if given the chance and get them to second stage sooner, but i won't make it my active duty to kill anyone before they have hit stage two before 3 gens are left.

Difference between a joke and an insult, probably explains why you‚Äôre alone. You didn‚Äôt make a gay joke you were being discriminatory against gay people.

Killer: Do it for the drama. Make it chaotic (or, if Spirit, uncanny and creepy). Put on a show! It's a haunted house bloodbath carnival hell and I'm there to maim &amp; entertain.
---
I bring my character to life, and in return I respect their character choices and play WITH them. The best survivor/killer interactions are all about the characters and I want my survivors to feel immersed again
---
Survivor: listen to and read the body language of my teammates and work with where they're at. When I unhook them, I wait for them to decide where to hide and follow them -- they know what's best for them, and I'm there to keep them alive while we figure it out together.

Which is to say yes, they work, but they don't let you magically see colors your eyes can't normally see, it just blocks certain spectrums of light so your eyes can more easily differentiate between shades that contain that spectrum. They work for most people (not everyone, because it really depends on how weak your cones are and where on the light spectrum they're weak) but it's not like it make those colors exist to people who have never seen them. They're also quite expensive for what they are and not really a replacement for colorblind accessibility settings, although they can help.

Ok then I‚Äôll tell you it‚Äôs doing your mom but I get it article 13 isn‚Äôt letting you watch the video

Bingo!

Would be cool to have a gay character tbh, they don't even have to be 'deep'. Dbd isn't exactly known for it's thrilling lore, most characters are one dimensional as is, so having a character just be 'gay' wouldn't be too out of the ordinary.
---
ok mr troll
---
Pepega Clap
---
Are you joking?
---
Oh now your discriminating me over my height wooooow
---
Fat bait lmao
---
Not what discrimination is, just want your real age.
---
&gt;Why does there always need to be homosexual representation in every piece of media? Can‚Äôt you just let the character writers write what they want?
---
Well, because LGBTQ fans want to feel included and represented in the entertainment they consume.
---
Have you not been to DBD's twitch directory? The amount of LGBTQ streamers with their communities and hundreds of viewers is insanely huge. I wouldn't be surprised if equal or bigger to the other streamers.
---
&gt;if your team does gens
---
surely that should be every game
---
I'm not expecting a 4 man escape every trial, but please Entity, pair me up with survivors who actually want to play the game
---
Feels like the 50s...
---
you asked me to "show" it.. are you okay?
---
I clean totems to give me a chance to think, it's the perfect excuse to settle down and ignore the carnage happening ten feet away and just reflect on who I am and where I'm going
---
What are you talking about
---
I try not to be mean towards killers as a survivor, as for when I'm killer though, I've made a personal rule list:
---
1. No facecamp whatsoever. A distance away so you can patrol and occasionally check for rescue, sure, but don't go right up to his face.
---
2. If you're walking away, and a survivor immediately tries to unhook, go for the one you hooked because HE'S RIGHT THERE.
---
18 I‚Äôm not lying I‚Äôm just short sorry but do you see Peter Dinklage and are just like yeah that guy has to be like 6 because he‚Äôs short XD
---
Survivor: If you hookfarm me in front of the killer I will not unhook you the whole game. I won't help with a group rescue or nothing.
---
Also if I see a totem, I must fondle it.
---
Killer: I get one death, I happy. *Note: I'm not the best killer.*
---
And using that combination or the one in ur photo will take 2 perk slots instead u could run self care and the something else such as balanced landing, or bond
---
I‚Äôm rank 2 and I use self care. Been in the red ranks for months now and frankly, it doesn‚Äôt even matter what perks I use. The point is this: as a survivor, are you aware of what is going on with the game. If you can gather information about other survivors and killers and then do what is optimal, self care and what not is fine. Those meta perks needs experience as well. I‚Äôve seen so many dead hard fails, borrowed time wasted, decisive strike missed, adrenaline not even activating cuz there no gen being done, yes at red ranks. What‚Äôs self care against a plague? But that‚Äôll be different if it‚Äôs a legion where you don‚Äôt want to be huddled in a group. So it all depends. Quit judging as if you know what‚Äôs the best.
---
Nothing wrong with being short I used to be 5ft 2 when I was 13.
---
ŸäŸà ÿ®Ÿäÿ®Ÿä ŸÉŸäŸÑÿ±
---
It's nice for slugging situations, well if you're not the one getting slugged anyway
---
i waited 15 mins for a game and then this shit happens
---
I just want to fuck your brother man I‚Äôve already fucked your mom so so he‚Äôs next on the list
---
I never asked for this
---
And using that combination or the one in ur photo will take 2 perk slots instead u could run self care and then something else such as balanced landing, or bond
---
It‚Äôs about the time it takes to heal, you might as well be doing a gen instead
---
These people make me laugh, completely playing him the wrong way, thats why they feel like they need to camp.
---
All the replies seem to shocked on the notion of a gay character üò¢
---
I‚Äôve always been a trailer blazer, but this is heartbreaking to see. I never knew this community to be negative.

Adam no!!! This broke my heart for him. Love this adorable style!
---
Territorial imperative should work as a reverse kindred.
---
Mum*, you lil Americannnn. This is like year 2 insults. ‚ÄúI fucked your mum‚Äù, damn maturity comes will come later
---
Oh my god I‚Äôm literally 18 XD I‚Äôm sorry but people can be short but seeing how your acting like I‚Äôm young for being short shows that your probably still 13
---
Oh same, its def just game fatigue. Yes there are still MANY annoying things, but I like the game way more
---
Not gonna lie I do miss machine gun build ;_;
---
We need tutorials on every individual killer
---
Me? I wasn't judging anybody
---
I did fuck your mom what‚Äôs the issue
---
You‚Äôre*, seriously come on. You come across as so stupid it‚Äôs hard to know
---
Tunnel the sandbagger/selfish people
---
&gt;instead u could run self care  
---
Lmao why would I use that
---
&gt;balanced landing, or bond
---
Sometimes I do. I just really enjoy Head On, and it doesn't affect my ability to get iridescent in chaser emblems.
---
Maybr having every hook add to a stack that makes the sacrifice faster and faster.
---
"You're entitled"
---
Rank 1, I value self care and use it 100 percent of the time. It‚Äôs application has saved me more times and I find at end game people could‚Äôve gotten saved but only 1 person is healthy and the others can‚Äôt heal cause they have nothing to heal with. Inner strength has a max use of 5 times and that‚Äôs if your team doesn‚Äôt cleanse totems for the points. I use iron will with self care just because iron will is for juking and hiding in a chase. Not to be injured all game until I find a team mate. Adrenaline pops at endgame and that‚Äôs it. And I don‚Äôt pour all my BP into survivor so I don‚Äôt have medkits. (At least not enough to run every game with the way I play)
---
Nooo, I meant you're allowed to have an opinion and it would be wrong for me to hate on you for it.
---
I don't anyway so that shouldn't be too hard. But often people die on second hook since no one saves them. I guess I just gotta grind. Thank you for the info!
---
I‚Äôm sorry your so offended about me doing your mom but you gotta calm down now again let me meet this brother
---
Thats cool bro - of course you can play how you want.
---
This is just more of a rant/meme to raise awareness in the community for those survivors who don't use SC correctly. I'm hoping you are one of those who utilise it's potential in a way that benefits the team.
---
Yes it reveals their aura. It‚Äôs a high risk/high reward style type of killer, one that is all or nothing. Not for everyone, but very fun once you get the ball rolling!
---
You‚Äôre*, again come on, also please don‚Äôt have intercourse with ‚Äúyour mom‚Äù that‚Äôs incest
---
I'll gen tap until the killer gets their first hook.
---
damn that would have been so good, why didn't I think of that, good idea
---
Spine Chill wrecks him as well, and it's unfortunately becoming meta as more red rank survivors are learning how easy it is to maintain distance on M1 killers
---
That's 100% something Jerma would do.
---

---
Your getting really heated there my bro are you okay I mean your now just calling out my grammar
---
I never understand when people say so and so killer doesn‚Äôt require ‚Äòskill‚Äô to play. Are you talking about their power?
---
I‚Äôm amazed that so many comments don‚Äôt get this meme. It only applies to certain scenarios, Myers in T3 with a tombstone for example.  By the time you get them out, get DSd and chase them again you lost your T3 and instakill.  Many will just move on, especially if another survivor is nearby.
---
I won‚Äôt save someone who entered the struggle stage from trying to unhook themselves. Not gonna risk my life for someone who is getting themselves killed quicker. If there‚Äôs only 2 survivors, I will sacrifice myself to let them win if it comes to it. It‚Äôs better to have at least one escape than none. That being said, if I‚Äôm on my first hook and there‚Äôs only one other survivor left and they don‚Äôt even attempt to save me, I will stay on that hook for as long as possible for the killer to find them. Also if a killer uses exploits and is being toxic then I‚Äôll be as toxic back as possible. Sounds bad, but this stuff doesn‚Äôt happen to me that often (other than the toxic killers obviously) and 99% of the time I‚Äôm just trying to help my teammates survive.
---
Can someone explain what this means? Also what exactly is supposed to happen when I swing at somebody rescuing a survivor? It seems like sometimes I hit the person on hook and nothing happens, sometimes I hit the rescuer and they make a noise like they got injured and then other times I hit the rescuer and it cancels the unhook.
---
If I'm on the hook and I see you self-caring in the corner again, I'm judging.
---
Of course you can play as you want, but hopefully, you are one of those survivors who put emphasis on the team.
---
Hahaha! He would punch tbagging survivor face
---
You‚Äôre*, I thought you‚Äôd learn. It‚Äôs because you aren‚Äôt giving any good insults, just ‚Äúi fucked my own mom‚Äù. It‚Äôs cringe
---
I wish I knew what this meant. But only if it is funny.
---
I got trapped once and had to hit four of the jigsaw boxes to get it off. How does that work? Is it a random box? Do you have to hit a certain number of them? Or what?
---
Hey thats a good idea!
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you would ruin your own gameplay over something that means basically nothing
---
Trying to cleanse that toth I see, shame it alerted a wild Michael.
---
I try to herd them away from boxes while trying not to down them. And if i see a survivor with a trap thats about to explode i just crouch near them and either wait for them to fail the box or they get it off and they still die
---
Yay! Someone who acknowledges how counter intuitive it is!
---
I want to see Daphne's insides getting consumed by Hag.

I enjoyed the meme until I saw self care
---
I love hearing that! I ended up putting some extra lace behind the eyes to hide my own eyes. My eyes were so visible that it took away from the fear factor of it.
---
Probably because it stacks with any other debuff is why they won't buff it. Adding an extra 1-2% and or making it affect dead people will make it possible to have tremendous consistent slowdown when paired with dying light, sloppy, and other slowdowns. Already looking at the most extreme example of Freddy with swing chains, jump ripe, thana, DL, and sloppy is insanely strong, adding even a few more % or other debuffs to it will exponentially make it that more deadly.
---
I believe thanataphobia falls off for legion due to legion themself not being too deadly outside of their power. It complements Plague so much because she has more capability in a chase, as in actual tracking through vomit and nobody is there to help you since they're probably all broken too, so much so that people actually cleanse to counter all that slowdown which is just another positive for her.
---
If Legion had more impact on injured survivors, I think the perk would be a lot more effective for them.
---
Hmm must be on your location, I‚Äôm in the southeast USA and it‚Äôs always 10-15mins
---
Try playing killer. Not only will it vary up the gameplay, which will hopefully be more fun, but you'll learn better how to counter each killer from their perspective.
---
Then again, I refuse to play survivor most of the time, so I could be biased.
---
Instead of complaining that pallets aren‚Äôt Get Out of Jail Free cards, learn the timing of pallet drops so you know when you‚Äôd get hit anyway and just not drop the pallet, or stop being greedy and drop the pallet earlier
---
Self Care/ Botany Knowledge. Add in an exhaustion perk and literally anything else and you're set.
---
Makes it so it's mathematically better for me to heal myself than have someone else do it and people stop riding my ass over it. Plus the constant bonus to healing others more than makes up plenty of time.
---
It's not flashy but it works and still means gens done faster than if I had to have someone else heal me.
---
\-BBQ is a shortened way of saying the name of the killer perk (Leatherface/The Cannibal's, specifically) "[Barbecue and Chilli](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Barbecue_%26_Chilli)".
---
When you hook a survivor you get a token (up to 2/3/4) that increases all BP gained by 25% each (up to 100%)
---
You also briefly see the auras of everyone who's more than 40 meters away and not in a locker after hooking someone
---
\-The Shrine of Secrets is located in the in-game store
---
\-4k means 4 kills, the killer killed/sacrificed every survivor
---
My point exactly
---
Man I just want to fuck YOUR brother bro come on man
---
Even with the totem up and everyone affected, survivors still get to the hook easily 98 percent of the time. It isn't hard at all to remember where the hook event happened. It is more helpful for slugging
---
Getting sick of all these instaheals every game. Everyone is using them like crazy.
---
DCing is so pointless. If you‚Äôre a killer, you don‚Äôt get your points, you lose your add ons, and everyone survives. If you‚Äôre a survivor, then you fucked your team, lost all of your items and add ons, you get no points, and the killer gets extra points. Kinda on the sidetrack but if survivors don‚Äôt get extra points from DCing killers (because it would supposedly make survivors just act toxic for points) then killers shouldn‚Äôt get points for being toxic and making survivors dc.
---
You're completely right about that, those companies charge so much. I did a lot of  looking around and actually ended up finding a seller on Amazon, of all places. But it's weird, because it looks like they took the store down? The seller's name is Quinn Goods Store.
---
Should be a quick match at least.
---
Learning hag properly isn't that easy and most don't bother. Unless you mean just putting 10 traps in a circle around a hooked survivor and then staying there.
---
See what you‚Äôve come toüòÇüòÇ, your standards of insults have fallen. Even cunt was bad but this is just all low. Have all at him, his yours cutie
---
My go to loadout is (at rank 1 btw so it‚Äôs consistent) is Iron will + resilience (you‚Äôll be injured most of the game at red ranks anyways) + sprint burst (learn to 99 it at chases and it‚Äôll be the best exhaustion perk) + wild perk. This is the perk I like to keep on changing every match. DS if I was tunneled last match, BT if a teammate was camped, WGLF if I‚Äôm BP thirsty or even fixated/vigil to synergize w SB.
---
And I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so insulting about having sexual relations with you‚Äôre mom 
---
See I used You‚Äôre happy now little guy
---
Basically, every trap has a certain key assigned to it. That key can spawn in any one of the Jigsaw Boxes around the map, and it doesn't move. It isn't RNG if the Jigsaw Box will get your RBT off or not, because only one Box on the map will do it.
---
It just fits on the devs bad circlejerk going on right now.
---
If you have a newer nvidia graphics card you can use the in-game overlay to apply a colorblind filter. It works really well. I don't lose chases anymore.
---
Oh sorry, I didn't even fucking read it, I'm a Shane to my family.
---
Little guy, someone‚Äôs insecureüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Lmao nice bait though, you‚Äôre learning
---
This is from Scream the Series. Basically, she is a having a mental breadown after having her boyfriend's guts proud all over her. So yeah, very funny lol.
---
You‚Äôve only been insulting me over my grammar mistakes my man but even then it‚Äôs not an insult I‚Äôm just saying I want to fuck you‚Äôre brother and I‚Äôve already fucked you‚Äôre mom
---
I don't quite understand. How do you get back to the same lobby after you leave the game?
---
They were lucky to not have been grabbed by the entity.
---
"Updates late"
---
**THEY HATE US AND WANT US ALL TO DIE. THEYVE NEVER ADDED ANYTHIGN TO THE GAME EVER! ARRRGGHHHHHHHHHHHH ARRGHHHHHHHHH!**
---
A Shane?
---
There‚Äôs like a circle of toxicity. Survivor does something to mildly annoy killer, killer exploits to secure kill, other survivors exploit or are toxic back, everyone rages when the match ends. Lol
---
AAAAAAAGHHHHHH
---
This literally makes no sense. No one is forcing you to play meta perks. Do whatever you want.
---
But you accused me of insulting you on tire height, personal life, mother etc. Somethings not add up here chief
---
yeah hoped so, but went to the lobby after loading unluckily
---
You‚Äôre tryin to shit on ops fun :( they just want to be a healer
---
Second Wind works off of healing health states, while Solidarity works off of healing charges. Sure, insta-heals do expend your medkit‚Äôs charges, but that happens after the healing is finished and doesn‚Äôt count as using charges to heal.
---
Honestly flip flop being 100% wouldn't be that bad it would be a strong counter to slugging I still think it would be really strong but by no means oppressive, I think 75 would be a good point for it.
---
Right but like... does it ever actually delay longer than just continuing to run? At most you make them miss one swing right? How is that effective?
---
Not trying to be a dick I'm genuinely asking.
---
i use self care.........
---
low hanging fruit
---
I have no idea. I found the image itself on google
---
Ohh yeah fair enough for me its EU
---
Why does Mettle of Man not give me a fucking protection prompt when I protect an ally?
---
Shut up I was in line before you
---
&gt;Now... I'm not saying that you are not allowed to use self-care. Of course you can play however you want.
---
&lt;3
---
Yeah because they are running Self Care and want to maximize their points by taking advantage of skill checks. It‚Äôs amazing how many players don‚Äôt know anything about point efficiency. oMg WhY wOn‚ÄôT hE lEt Me HeAl HiM??
---
Yep it‚Äôs working only in high ranks
---
Sometimes the killer is waiting that‚Äôs why I got head on and inner strength big brain time lol
---
I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs YOUR problem I mean it seems YOUR getting really heated over me not using the right grammar it‚Äôs actually pretty funny seeing you go back to the argument over and over again and try to act smart
---
Yeah, each character after getting to level 30,35,40, unlocks their perks as ,,Teachables¬¥¬¥ which means they have the chance of spawning on bloodwebs of other characters.
---
Also, yes you can use different perks on different survivors. For example, after getting Dwight's teachable ,,Bond,,
---
it has the chance of spawning on Claudette's, or Jake's bloodweb.
---
I get that, but that wasnt the question.
---
Are we sure hoping in and out of a locker buys more time, even just a few seconds, than continuing to run away or trying to juke would? 
---
That was the question. And I'm not convinced
---
No, op is saying that the survivor disconnected which caused the entire to game to crash. People are disagreeing with that assessment because what most likely happened is that the connection was lost on both ends. 
---
Yet op decides to blame the survivor for ‚Äúbeing toxic and dcing‚Äù, when it was probably just a mutual connection issue due to some current bugs in the game.
---
So each character has teachable perks. Once they are unlocked through leveling up that characters bloodweb they will begin to appear on other characters bloodwebs. So If you wanted to use Kate but run a perk from another survivor you would need to level the other character until you unlock their teachable. Then you would need to buy that perk on kates bloodweb.
---
Because the feature that prevents 3 survivor games is bugged and this happens from time to time. It's literally only 30 seconds longer than if it had ended right after the loading screen as it typically does. Not a meaningful difference whatsoever
---
If only in game Susie was as cute as your drawing uwu
---
 Y‚Äôall want a easy game or y‚Äôall want a fun game. My personal most enjoyable moment is mind gaming the spirit. One time I faced off a spirit who likes to fake phasing. We ended up staring at each other over a pallet for a good thirty seconds then she decided to really phase. And guess what, I just walked away and hear her slash an empty pallet. I feel really satisfied at that moment.
---
That‚Äôs what I end up doing and even then I still fucking manage to pip and hit rank 8 and get more depressed. 
---
Back when I started that‚Äôs all I heard about was better survivors &amp; killers the higher you went up in rank from the PC community as I watched via YouTube and my friends. I play on PS4 so I got really good at the game and invested allot of time. I‚Äôm currently a Devotion 7/36, I‚Äôve been on since last August because friends of mine wanted me to come try it and play with them and I did and got hooked. I then grew tired of the bs toxic facecamped matches in the lower ranks, along with the new guys who just didn‚Äôt know what to do or would hide in the corner waiting for everyone to die.
---
I started learning everything I could and evolving my skills within the game to get to the red ranks where I thought I would face good legit killers and have some kick ass random survivors who would navigate and play the matches like we were a well oiled seal team.
---
Little did I know and then find out that the higher you climbed the worst it seemed to get, going thru the purple ranks was a fucking nightmare. I kept at it thinking once I get to the reds this bs is behind me and onto some really good games. Get to the red ranks and the shit I experienced in the purple ranks was doubled. I was pissed and said never again I would get back to the red ranks because there is nothing rewarded or gained, except a bunch of asshole scummy toxic killers who do the same shit as the low rank killers do and the most selfish asshole survivor teammates you could ever find in DBD.
---
Im mainly talking about Pigs who will down a trapped survivor right after they get unhooked. Also so you wont chase a trapped survivor if they are at full health?
---
It teases me with a game and then rips it from me, the emotional damage is unfixable
---
I bet all the thumb-downs are from survivor mains who aren't fans of evening the playing field, lol.
---
It‚Äôs not acting smart, it‚Äôs basic knowledge. Like you even capitalised it and still get it wrong.  I‚Äôll teach you. ‚ÄúYour problem‚Äù that‚Äôs correct well done. ‚ÄúYOUR getting‚Äù that‚Äôs wrong, you are getting. Please use that big brain
---
Thanks
---
i am here for you. worry not, my friend
---
But she a ghoooooh wait yeah ive seen some stuff like that
---
I've never seen iron will up close and I just realized it is an image of someone biting forcibly into a rag. I've always seen it as someone doing the splits, wearing a phany pack, while cowering and covering their head with their arms.
---
It‚Äôs 30/35/40 for unlocking the teachables but otherwise you‚Äôre absolutely right
---
It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm capitalizing it for a reason maybe because it‚Äôs funny to see you go after it like a wild animal every time I use the wrong you‚Äôre
---
Nah, 100% escape rate is unattainable with how many camping, tunneling killers are in the game these days. But I usually run in a 4 man stack.  
---
We each have our roles, works fairly well too. I start as totem hunter, other 3 hit the gens. Whoever is found first runs the killer. If I'm found first, we have a second surv who takes over totems.  
---
We make sure to communicate where the other 2 are double teaming a gen, so the "runner" doesn't sand bag them. When the runner gets caught, the totem hunter unhooks (unless they're opposite side of the map, then one of the gen jockeys unhooks).  
---
When someone is death hook, someone who isn't intentionally "gets caught" to take the killer off them. We're all pretty altruistic and don't mind dying for each other, so it makes for a pretty formidable team.
---
Just finished watching noragami too lol
---
Different characters have different teachable perks, this perks are the ones that once unlocked at level 30, 35 and 40, will be available to all other characters. Hopefully this was helpful
---
Dude. The survivor dcing would not do that to your game. It was bhvr‚Äôs issue with game crashes that caused this. 
---
Why are you assuming that the survivor was just ‚ÄúbEinG ToxIc‚Äù when it was most likely a mutual issue due to the dbd server? 
---
Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have such a bad attitude.
---
Tell him there are 17 (18? 19?) Killers so each match is basically a randomly determined horror movie, each with a different vibe, and he can roleplay as almost any kind of person (athlete, healer, genius, stealthy ninja, rowdy fighter)
---
Also what kind of games is he already into? Attack it from the angle of what he already likes
---
&gt;If you can't last 32 seconds extra in a chase due to being healthy, then the self care was usually a net loss for your team.
---
PERFECTLY SAID.
---
Your entire comment is perfect. I wish more people would have a game sense on this level.
---
This title makes me so confused.
---
Oh. Well that's not Trap Tunneling that's just straight up tunneling lol. And nah, that would be a waste of time. I'm not gonna commit to a full chase with someone who isn't doing anything useful anyway, but if they are already injured, its basically a free down if I catch them in a bad spot.
---
Wrong sub my dude. 
---
You wanted this one r/warframe
---
Ok so how Is that better than attempting a normal juke? If you fail, same result, but if you succeed a locker juke you bought 1-10 seconds (based on what you said) I have juked (and been juked) and had it prolong the chase by a massive amount of time. Becuase the chance of that giving you just enough distance to make a window or pallet. 
---
I just dont ever see locker juking as a smart move lol
---
Agreed. But I don't see many SC users utilising Botany Knowledge. Instead, they believe urban evasion provides better synchrony...
---
Unique perks in red ranks? Are we talking about DBD here?
---
That is. ..that.....he.....i cant.......
---
Then you get healed by inner strenght
---
When is the livestream?
---
So why would you use it correctly lmao, your logic matches your intelligence
---
I thought they already got undetectable after the last update?
---
But why Legion?
---
I mean it‚Äôs kinda fun going back and forth throws you for a loop and it seems to piss you off more
---
/r/lostredditors
---
What's the point of running it on plague? They just cleanse and insta heal
---
Some tips: put snares on their way to the corner. Fake teleport to slow down gens when 
---
you find chance to commit and down someone. Hurt them faster than they heal, so faster than 1 hit per 32 second+the time they spend to run, so eventually all of them are hurt and you can start down people.
---
Scooby Doo skins for the 4 original survivors, Shaggy Dwight, Daphne Meg, Velma Claudette, Fred Jake and a Demogorgon cosmetic where he's wearing Scooby's collar
---
Tell him the hit boxes are the best in the industry and that all killers are balanced
---
Due to unforeseen circumstances, the livestream has been postponed.
---
Thanks for the correction :)
---
Iridescent head is fine. Iridescent heads are not. If the add on worked such that infantry belt wouldn‚Äôt raise it to 3 then I think it would be okay. 
---
Also, black incense literally has the most straightforward counterplay. If you suspect it‚Äôs in play, and it‚Äôs easy to read when she‚Äôs got it, just cleanse. Sorry that the killer can make decisions that make a survivor have to make a tough choice. I understand there‚Äôs an aversion among players to new lines of thinking, but you won‚Äôt get good by memorizing loops and expecting the way you play against leatherfaces to work against everyone else.
---
No
---
I mean as it as it stands unbreakable ds they either pick you up or you get up, but that's only after an unhook, also you get one use of unbreakable and if you are running 2 anti slug perks you deserve to get up or off if they slug and then keep doing it, my last point is the range of hooks , a lot of the time there is one seemingly every five feet
---
What‚Äôs going o-
---
Heihachi..?
---
Okay Karen
---
Switch thana with dying light or pop then that‚Äôs my game
---
Well.... you werent even a reject in a movie so ha!

Wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as bad if the devs hadn‚Äôt mentioned it prior to taking weeks to actually nerf it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Tbh I don‚Äôt even think they need to be nerfed. They‚Äôre only being used like crazy exactly because they‚Äôre being nerfed.
---
Who's making fun of you?? Lmfao I fail to believe that you feel emotional turmoil over your perks.
---
None of them seemed that negative they were all just expressing their opinion that there is really no need for a lgbt character in every piece of media. If you force the devs to do that then the effort itself is just disingenuous and really doesn‚Äôt mean anything
---
Work through ruin for at least the first gen.
---
It's an Aura perk, so Undetectable trumps it. Survivors can still see the auras of each other, though.
---
Yh it pisses me off SOOOO MUCH it got me so triggered that I started calling you a cunt and being like I fucked your mum, oh wait....
---
but it's the same than for a horror film or a horror book. If you can't stand the fear it triggers in you, just don't read/watch it.
---
Killer: don‚Äôt intentionally tunnel unless they‚Äôre toxic, dont face camp until end game collapse.
---
Survivor: cleanse totems on sight, always save teammates from hook as soon as possible.
---
My favorite thing to do is tell a "baby killer" what they did wrong while chasing me or how they can improve their game. There's nothing better than making the overall player base better to increase your fun while gaming. Some times they take it, other times the rage is so strong from toxicity that they fire back like I'm insulting.  
---
Everyone can do their part to fix it.
---
Thanks! I try to include info in my comments like this because I know there are newer player on the sub reading these things. I try to be mindful when I write a comment that other people besides OP or the person I'm replying to will be reading it.  
---
Game sense comes with experience, but also with knowledge. I got much of what I know thanks to the people who wrote the wiki, and the YouTubers who made tutorials. Figuring out all the strategies and techniques on my own would have taken eons, so I like to pass along the favor where I can. Sometimes it means my comments will look like essays, but it's worth it if I can teach someone something new.
---
A good read.
---
Thanks for sharing this, I‚Äôve been inspired to play killer some more, I was struggling lately and this helped me shift my perspective. It also validates my past actions because I have employed a few of these tactics before. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Gotcha. Okay, that is good to know moving forward. Thank you!
---
Unrelenting. You recuperate faster with whifs. 
---
Why not make it a 5 percent recovery hit or whif.
---
Dude first time I watched that scene, I almost puked. It was horrifying to me at the time lol
---
You kind of have to, the double blood points is basically a must unless you want to spend double the time grinding perks
---
Self care is only good if you are able to run the killer for longer than 32 seconds on full health. If not, you just wasted 32 valuable seconds where you could‚Äôve been working on a generator. Not to mention randoms will heal you 95% of the time (much faster).
---
Thanatophobia, blood hound, butcher and ruin.
---
What is considered an optimal build for the Plague? 
---
At higher ranks, I notice survivors don't bother cleansing much, making her a M1 Killer with constant NOED for most of her matches.
---
seem legit
---
There‚Äôs more than one definition of winning. It‚Äôs a game. There are lots of ways to have fun. If I‚Äôm playing a killer for the challenge and I get my challenge and then you teabag... you gettin facecamped.
---
Solo survivors aren‚Äôt reliable enough to heal you, and I don‚Äôt want to bring in a med kit each round to heal myself. Once I unlock Adrenaline for my main, I‚Äôll probably test it out and see if I prefer it but self-care has always been really helpful to me. Although I do wish the healing speed was a little faster.
---
Idk, it's wouldn't the same as it could be on Spooktober. The mood is lost
---
Theres a post about the same thing like 2 down from this, so probably.
---
Over. a. Year.
---
Yes, it's recent. I'm not the one out of touch with the community since before few months ago, she wasn't even mentioned as top tier, Billy instead was mentioned.
---
I mean, if you, like many sheeple who cry about spirit, it's your problem to follow the trend. I have a problem when you endorse dcing which is against the rule, EULA and a bannable offense just because you won't play against a killer
---
What
---
You edited it after I commented, and in your original comment you insinuated that I was lying, so you insulted me first. Do research before saying people are lying
---
That's true. He's really into strategy games, and it's really important to be strategic in dbd when making builds. Good idea
---
I won't deny it, the idea of running around with built in Enduring, Unrelenting, Bloodhound and Old Freddy Vision sounds fun, especially if you're also running Enduring and Unrelenting alongside it. It just wouldn't be fun for very long. :(
---
Its not only possible in KYF, it is very possible in public matches. I readied up for a match as killer, I was playing Demogorgon and I saw 4 other survivors in the lobby readying up and when I spawned in I saw a Wraith in the little spawn-in Cutscene and there were 3 survivors.
---
You gotta love them hitboxes lol
---
I think the point of losing your perk when the obsession dies is to discourage you from tunneling the obsession. Also, if you're not tunneling, there should only be 3/4 hooks left by this point anyway and shouldn't matter. Just saying.
---
Always cleanse totems near exit gates. If the killer is running NOED I‚Äôm not giving them a free camping site.
---
I look at it a different way. I'm going to crawl and hide to make the killer wait for me to bleed out. I don't mind crawling to a nice hiding spot and pulling up a YouTube video while the killer wastes it time searching for me.
---
The cowboy Jakes are pretentious. Easy to kill.
---
This is great!  Although for me, it's better if the gif/video ends with Myers nodding lol
---
I won't take anything you say seriously if you think you can't get DSed just by not tunnelling
---
Play killer more or just don't talk about something you are clueless about
---
Burger King Spirit
---
So you‚Äôre going to support a Nazi to spite some people you‚Äôve never met on the Internet? Yeah you sound like a morally and mentally sound individual
---
Fun is one thing, but the official win condition as of right now is attaining a pip, and as far as that goes, you likely won‚Äôt if you just facecamp a guy. Regardless of how I feel about the Hype Nea absolutely obliter-fucking her crouch button to try and irritate me, throwing my whole game to prove a point seems rather juvenile to me, not to mention the fact that you‚Äôve likely given the survivor exactly what they wanted, a reaction out of you and a fuck ton of uncontested gen progress for their team
---
Well the hatch goes to hell....so.
---
I'm detecting trace amounts of salt
---
I wish more killers would take a bit of pity on survivors when people DC. 
---
I do this all the time, and people are so thankful for it afterwards.
---
Also, it‚Äôs fun helping repair gens as Piggy
---
What if every survivor used one?
---
Nicely done! Wraith is so much fun to play!
---
Happy cake day!
---
Nice lips. Perfect for eating pickles.
---
That's what it looks like :/
---
clown is terrible oh god
---
Ghost Face is stalking survivors until they're marked while leaning and then hitting them. Pretty easy and can be done in 2 matches (one match if you're an experienced Ghost Face).
---
Yeah, well, keep in mind toxicity works both ways.
---
When I run into survivors who tbag and act like assholes I swap to Nea and run Bond with OoO. 
---
All of you douchebags could use a lesson in integrity.
---
And I'm grateful that there are people like you that publicly appreciate it.
---
I personally also tend to..."Share my wisdom", maybe a bit too often haha. But in the end, even when I put good effort into it and hope to help some people out either in their gameplay or perspectives and opinions towards a specific element, none cares. The only ones who do are the typical trolls that attempt to trigger you by saying something like "You call XY bad, so your opinion is invalid".
---
Just had someone like that earlier, but yeah. People like Shirtless David King and me need people like you, that appreciate our efforts. Especially when none else does. Always remember that.
---
Nurse wasn't nerfed. She was given a slight inconvenience.
---
Whenever I see a swf with items I‚Äôll switch up my loadout to Franklins. That always makes it fun for me lmao
---
As your other teammate is obviously in a chase on the other side of the map....meanwhile they sprint away from you anyways to hide against a wall and start using self care.
---
I love it, the pose is just great as well
---
a.k.a. a nerf
---
I would say every two/three games or so I‚Äôll have at least** 1 or 2 people dc. Just keep playing matches, you‚Äôll find decent lobbies with survivors who won‚Äôt dc on you.
---
At least you had a helpful/nice killer. LOL! I had 3 DC last night against a Freddy, and that fucker tunneled me down, hooked me, and stood there until I died. :(
---
It literally benefits everyone. You can use it to heal yourself if you're down two survivors and are injured and the other person is nowhere to be seen. You can use it to get a jump start on your heal and if someone comes by you can then let them finish up whatever you didn't. If you run a medkit it increases your efficiency with it by **20%** which is a whole hell of a lot. Self-Care, in the right hands, is an extremely helpful perk that can help the entire team by making it so there's one less person that needs the help of another survivor.
---
Umm... devours hope
---
Everyone having these long drawn-out conversations with you are the survivors who tea bag at the exit gate. Trying to say stuff like it's celebrating or they just want to say bye, LOL what horseshit. Everybody knows damn well that teabagging at the exit is a big middle finger to the killer that's it. And yeah, it's really sad that after winning the game they still feel the need to rub it in your face. Unfortunately I don't think it's just a problem with this game but the world in general these days, people just tend to be rude assholes more then in past decades for some reason.
---
&gt; Also, it‚Äôs fun helping repair gens as Piggy
---
YES! I love doing this!
---
It‚Äôs true - there‚Äôs like 40 perks on either side and only 10 you would ever consider using. I can only think they do it to add filler into the game as you effectively have to grind for 3x the number of perks to get the viable ones
---
Can‚Äôt have point efficiency when you‚Äôre dead
---
What I love about DbD is it's a strategy game where you have to think on your feet with instinct instantly. I love fantasy turn-based RPGs but the challenge I love about DbD is making strategic decisions FAST
---
No last few gens, endgame camping is fine by me xD
---
Thanks. I just thought it was funny I‚Äôve never even played clown.
---
God dammit!!!! I WANT THAT MEG MASK! XBOX will probably never see it...sadly. :(
---
So chilling why can‚Äôt it be in the game already
---
Except Head-On straight up doesn't work consistently.  Certain killers are able to be hit in one spot while other killers are invincible to it in the same spot.  Take the basement locker closest to the hooks.  I can stun Trapper even if he tightly rounds the corner but Freddy rounding the same corner is nearly impossible to hit.  At any rate it all depends on the rank you play.  At some ranks, teammates sprint away from you when you're injured and you spend more time chasing and convincing them to heal you than Self-Care would take to heal you.  Furthermore there are healing loadouts that do use a medkit as well as SC and BK to make the kit last a lot longer.
---
Ruin gameplay? I spend 2 minutes chilling then go back playing. The only one not having "his way" is the toxic bastard that enjoys making others feel bad. I am not a 4k or nothing.
---
You'd want Trager, and I'd want Chris Walker. But still, and Outlast DLC would be amazing
---
Absolutely not.
---
Exactly right. Now, as with so many other things which were once good, they have been nerfed into non-existence
---
Vigo's shroud is the best offering a killer can hope for. Then you have 4 people all in one small area and pressure you apply effects everyone. Similar to how the Shroud of Separation is more beneficial to survivors.
---
right? like, bruh I'm running We'll make it, please come here
---
Deliverances always get hooked first. Also nobody asked for a troll build
---
It's ok I still have lunchboxes and flashlights from last years Halloween, I can pretend.
---
You forgot to give Legion's a pair man! 
---
Wait a minute..
---
You make 360s sound easy and consistent...
---
Oh damn is that true, they lose that many points? I'm definitely going to have to start DCing at the end of games to punish asshole survivors that want to teabag. Thanks for the info.
---
We‚Äôll stall is good with Legion, it‚Äôs how a lot of people play with him. I use Nurses, Thana, Fire Up and BBQ. I try to make sure I hit everyone in the beginning but obviously sometimes that‚Äôs not going to be a guarantee, so getting at least two people is a good idea. Usually I go back to the first person I stabbed with feral frenzy and down them first, and they still haven‚Äôt gotten a gen at this point and I‚Äôm guaranteed my first hook even if they do pop off a gen. 
---
If they do pop a gen it isn‚Äôt a big deal, you want them to feel confident. The less Gens they have the more clustered they have to be and that‚Äôs good for you, because then you‚Äôll know where they are constantly. You‚Äôll want to apply pressure to the center Gens in the beginning of the game, so they are encouraged to get the farthest Gens first, and so they have a higher chance to three gen themselves. Of course if you get to a point where you‚Äôre really good or they spawn together you won‚Äôt even need to let them get Gens done to get a 4k, but some maps are too big and sometimes SWF are gonna gen rush, it happens. 
---
It takes a lot of practice, I have over 500 hours with Legion, and I wouldn‚Äôt complain if they got a buff, but to me he‚Äôs definitely not the worse killer by far. That would be Bubba. God I hate Bubba, but to each their own. I just have a special spot for Legion maybe. Hope this helped explain maybe
---
Are locker jukes easy and consistent? I thought they were fairly difficult and generally unhelpful.
---
I was saying the potential gains are higher. And both are tough to pull off well
---
Damn, that's actually a really good post. How did I miss that? I personally don't have big issues with them. A little frustration with windows at times, but not game breaking.
---
yes mee too. I loove huntress and she is one of my favorite killers to play as and against (before these servers).   
---
But now im just dc'ing huntress matches cos it's not fun to play with bullshit hitboxes. And Im sad cos I can't play as her cos I don't want to abuse it.

I've only ever versed a true forever freddy once and that shit gave me PTSD. It was one of the worst perk/addon combos I have ever seen in my life, I would 100% rather go against omegablink nurse with ebony mori than forever freddy.
---
Haha, I love doing this as Ghostface. I'll just sit there and keep hitting the Gen with my knife while they're working on it. Makes me feel helpful.
---
that explains how you can flashlight blind a demogorgon
---
Locker jukes are much easier to do as you can just read when they are going to swing.
---
Those skins are in the patch that hasn't dropped yet, so nothing until we get the patch.
---
Skins don't have official release date and you shouldn't take leaked dates to the heart.
---
It's a game I play for a month then take a break for a few, otherwise I'd be bored out of my head. I've no idea how streamers stay sane playing this game constantly lol.
---
"It literally benefits everyone" \*Proceeds to talk about a situation where it could only benefit 2 people (if everything goes right)\* 
---
I dont think you understand how important time is in this game. You wasting 32 seconds healing could be the difference between winning or losing. You could use that "getting a head start" time on generators instead and just get healed much faster when you come across someone else. Also, if you wanna make a huge point about how "20% increase efficiency" is a lot, then in that case self care is only good when you have a med kit.
---
Hitboxes aren‚Äôt the issue, it‚Äôs latency. From the killers point of view it probably looked like the hatchet connected.
---
Yeah, same boat here. I used to get excited when I heard her lullaby, dodging hatches was a fun adrenaline rush, but its been soiled by frustration from hits landing that shouldnt have. Hell I even liked playing against Iri Heads Huntress for awhile until these hit boxes became more problematic
---
I bring self care iron will and adrenaline you have nothing on me
---
Object of obsession needs a nerf or a serious downside, maybe make the user exposed? It pretty much allows an entire swf group know everything a killer does
---
You overestimate my ability to 360
---
Laughs in ace gang.
---
fucking adorable
---
Ahah, poor guys \^\^'
---
I'm bit overreacting, they postponed it only ONCE. They posted "situation" update on friday and then there was silence
---
i love it, it‚Äôs like the samination version of legion.
---
I mean yeah but that's within like 80 meters not telling how far, not that useful. Might be better to just use Spine Chill at that point.
---
Tbh i hate thanatophobia more than ruin. Especially if the killer good and knows how to apply map pressure gens become so hard to deal with.
---
Happens all the time.
---
It's even worse when two survivors decide to hide like that.
---
I do cleanse totems. I didn't say I was getting hit by NOED every game. Just that I see it a ton. That being said, I can't always cleanse totems if I'm the one getting chases for over half of the game.
---
Just kill the dude who sells out his own teammate.
---
for example, as a Ghostface main, I was down to a Dwight and a Bill. I downed the Bill and went looking for the Dwight. It had been a while and the Bill was still down. So I kept searching and found the Dwight Hatch Camping. I killed him and gave Bill the Hatch.
---
Indeed ;) 
---
And also Nurse with her clothe on !
---
I thought I was the only one who did that
---
apparently they‚Äôre still waiting for Sony to approve the event, classic Sony.
---
What about when the hatchet still hits you despite being in the next map over.
---
I remember it. 
---
Maybe they took it out when fixing the map.
---
I change out to Bloodwarden sometimes :)
---
I do cleanse dulls. I never said I was getting hit by NOED every game.
---
Yep all about buying as much time as you can for the rest of your teammates if there isn‚Äôt a better choice available.
---
This is why after every game, I try to say something positive before anyone else says something in chat. People will still be toxic sometimes but if you provide positivity right off the bat, maybe they'll rethink what they were about to say.
---
You are not the best player in the game dude, just self care in terror radius, you literally dont know the layouts, you use dance with me, wtf. Im rank 1, just hit great skill checks gens get done in like 45 seconds anyways
---
True, but it'd be fun to give it a try.
---
Here's hoping to see you in the fog soon, friend.
---
if you practice with this build, you can for sure live up to its name hahaha.
---
Make sabo great again
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of survivors getting using dead hard and ending up on the ground exhausted. Hopefully they can find a good fix.
---
Im more into we are gonna live forever, we will make it, no one left behind and i still need a filler for the last perk
---
I fear David's great manly power. I'm just glad that he didn't have the ability to just ko the killer when he got released.
---
When you are working on the last gen and the big brain claudette is t-bagging to heal you rather than complete the gen for adrenaline.
---
I'm pretty sure that exact thing happened in one of Noob3's videos lol
---
End game doesnt always allow for stalking time - especially when its so easy to pull GF out of stealth
---
They explained it on stream and it made sense, not sure about the explanation though. But it's way better that way, hook distribution used to be shit.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre joking or not but just an fyi, that is a genuinely embarrassing strategy. There‚Äôs just so much that is stupid about it I don‚Äôt know where to begin.
---
Anyone else finding gen grabs glitch consistently on dedicated? Like way more than it was before dedicated.
---
Fair enough. I‚Äôm moreso responding to the downvotes, I guess. It‚Äôs really simple. I‚Äôm not going to facecamp if you don‚Äôt deserve it. I know how to play. I‚Äôm actually quite good. It‚Äôs fun to me to take someone‚Äôs joy of being an asshole and turn it into them complaining about me being an asshole. If I throw away one match for it, I‚Äôll make it up in the next. Really, it‚Äôs no loss.
---
4 year tenure and 3.5 thousand karma hmm sounds like a phantom alt to me unless people are very divided about your opinions or you barely use reddit (which is evidently not the case) then this is an alt through and through. No point in Throwing insults at me all it‚Äôs gonna do is probably get you banned and you are probably well aware of that. So again this an alt and it shows
---
same thing happened to me when one dc‚Äôd (raged in my dms) and one killed themself on hook. i ran over to the preschool and saw the bb Jeff on da gen and i didn‚Äôt hurt him. ü•∞love da bbs
---
Better to dream big
---
i only tbag if you facecamped me or someone else. i do do the whole "chase you around and spin in circles til you notice me" thing if im bored tho.
---
No...he was being an ass. He was camping a Claudette on the hook. I ran in and saved her. Once she was off the hook, she DC'd, and the other 2 went with her. I'm assuming they were a SWF group. Who knows. 
---
It's just annoying. I've had this happen as killer, and I let the other 2 get everything done and escape. I know it's not a written rule, but it'd be nice if all killers were that nice.
---
Ez 4k at rank 15. Gg
---
Thanks for correcting me! I was using [this](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Michael_Myers) as a reference, but I think it's outdated
---
Oh no! I used a word wrong!!!!!! LOL! No worries.
---
Should let you open the trap door only it's not instant and makes noise to alert the killer.
---
i went in with the freddy offering to try him out and i had 2 dcs on their first hook.. i was just like... what?
---
I'm pretty for sure you can find it for $20 on Amazon looks very similar to the one in the picture
---
It‚Äôs like the ‚ÄúDoing gens, you?‚Äù Meme, except actually true.
---
Oh ok. Barely qualifies for the joke I was about to make. Made it now
---
Yeah, in the forums they said something like "The cosmetics won't be delayed because we never annouced them."
---
Fair enough, I‚Äôm personally really competitive so I can‚Äôt see myself ever throwing away a match for the sake of something like that, I play for the wins, but at the end of day, it‚Äôs your game and your rules. Good luck in your future matches üëçüèø
---
&gt; "It literally benefits everyone" \*Proceeds to talk about a situation where it could only benefit 2 people (if everything goes right)\* 
---
Did you just completely ignore this part?
---
&gt; Self-Care, in the right hands, is an extremely helpful perk that can help the entire team by making it so there's one less person that needs the help of another survivor. 
---
&gt; I dont think you understand how important time is in this game. You wasting 32 seconds healing could be the difference between winning or losing. 
---
Healing yourself while nobody is around to heal you is not wasting time. Investing 32 seconds, assuming nobody is around to help, to potentially loop the Killer for another 1 or 2 minutes is a net gain in time. No matter what the situation is, Self-Care is going to help you or whoever *might* come by to heal you.
---
&gt; You could use that "getting a head start" time on generators instead and just get healed much faster when you come across someone else. 
---
In situations where nobody is around to heal you, it is much more important to heal yourself than hope someone comes around to help you. You're in more situations where you can heal yourself than you are in situations where you can have someone else heal you.
---
&gt; Also, if you wanna make a huge point about how "20% increase efficiency" is a lot, then in that case self care is only good when you have a med kit. 
---
It's an *additional* benefit. As in, *in addition to* being able to now heal yourself, you can use a medkit to do it better and heal yourself more or heal other people more.
---
*Eventually, BHVR stopped thinking...*
---
My goodness did not realize how much there was
---
They have not annouced a date aside from, "Sometime next week."
---
Now I wonder who downdooted me
---
Who tf voted for demodoggo?
---
Ikr I'm a better rank now
---
noice ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Obviously it's not supposed to. But it happens, go into a trial trying to complete one daily, and come out with a different daily completely. This commonly happens is you start a game after discarding a challenge for a new one.
---
*360s you then fake 360s you then loops you for 5 gens* damn, shoulda brought noed ;p
---
Fair enough....these are acceptable reasons. You should fear this body, killer!
---
Did spine chill change/not work with the new Oblivious updates on stealth killers?
---
The mask looks very cartoon-ish
---
I like it!
---
Another person that completely misunderstood me. What are you on about? Never said body blocking and flashlight saving are toxic. Read again. Her behaviour was toxic not because she body blocked or tried to flashlight save, it's the way she did it. If you can't see that you're not a good judge of character.
---
If somebody's going to waste my time by standing in the exit gate waiting to teabag me while I'm across the map waiting for them to end the match yeah I'm just going to DC and get on to my next game. All the better if it punishes them.
---
LOL! Not me! I LOL'd!
---
Wait the pig can repair gens??
---
I really don't understand DC'ing. It just fucks over the whole team.
---
Veterans of old legion still have a grudge
---
If they miss Halloween altogether, I feel the community would allow for a week extension to make up for it :)
---
ironic you are complaining about an insta down when literally all the survivors have to do is cleanse totems...
---
I mean, I really really hate to be that guy, but if 10 ruin checks can *ruin* your progress, the answer pretty much boils down to ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù.
---
If you aren‚Äôt making any progress with Ruin in play, that‚Äôs your own damn fault. Land the skillchecks or gen-tap. Don‚Äôt hold back, because the killer isn‚Äôt holding back either.
---
Uses syringe vs wraith: " I brought it in case of Omegablink" "They are getting nerfed i have to use them".
---
Is Nancy a good starting char to get to 40 first for a new player? All her perks seem really useful (heal/aura/scratches) and a well rounded char overall. Also I bought sprint burst from the shrine so I can work with that for my exhaustion perk for now... mostly solo q
---
I'm afraid they'll somehow ruin it.
---
Pretty much always lol
---
Dear God no. Please I can only get so erect
---
I have nightmares about that neon 80's Jake skin.
---
She can simulate it! LOL!
---
Yeah! because as much as I personally don‚Äôt like playing against freddie‚Äôs, i would never risk losing possible points for it.
---
Pink haired Nea gang where you at?
---
I mean, yeah i understansd when put that way :/ 
---
Personally i use it but only when necessary, if i know someone is getting chased i'll search near generators for someone to heal me and if i don't find anyone, i'll just heal myself instead of being an easy kill for the killer because, the thing is, i use a kind of "sneaky support" build so i don't use Dead Hard, Decisive strike and all those perks to escape the killer easily. 
---
I try to play more sneaky so i never really encounter the killer and save others from hooks/heal them quickly without being seen but if i get chased i usually fall really fast tbh x)
---
Common guys give em a break. They are tryi..... uh um.
---
Surprisingly no, but its because i didnt tunnel or camp
---
95% of survivor mains, then those same ones get on here and try to say something about killers being toxic. Its pretty sad.
---
What does "meta" imply in terms of perks?
---
I only came to the game when Ghostface was released. What was the matter with Legion
---
I use Head On and Dance With Me because it's gotten to the point where it's really boring if I use all the meta perks all the time. 
---
When I first got to red ranks, I got there using my typical build of Diversion, Lithe, Dance With Me, Quick and Quiet. It's not hard at all to get to red ranks.
---
&gt;just self care in terror radius
---
I love playing against survivors like you. I've recently become more of a killer main, and I'm seeing 'types' of survivors. You have the actual good survivors, over-altruistic survivors, gen-rushers, and then hotshots like you who think they are good. Nurses Calling is a favourite.
---
it was only the last one with NOED and it was at the exit gate as she got it opened, so without it she would have gotten out.
---
simple but effective!
---
‚ÄúYou gotta be quicker then that‚Äù
---
I bring a green mori for keys, ebony if there is more than one key.
---
I'm a survivor main, and I'm fine with the idea of evening the playing field- I'm just tired of this idea of survivors never wanting balance in the game for both sides. It's really fucking dumb.
---
They already said itll be  the same length at a later date
---
Im rank 1 killer and survivor, im pretty good i think
---
Looking at the baby Myers reminds me of the knight from hollow knight
---
They're*
---
Well, if everybody's happy with the extremely minor change, then more power to them.
---
You need to tell him about how he has to play a couple dozen or so matches to even get those kinds of perks.
---
Delete hag to delete ruin.
---
I saw this in the sales yesterday and was so excited. I expected nothing and am still let down.
---
Right??? I actually don't mind playing against Freddy! I really hate playing against Doctor, but I wouldn't DC over it. LOL! I just suck it up! 3,000BPS is better than 0! LOL!
---
Everytime i see a ghostface crouch at me menacingly it's an instant d/c, just can't handle it
---
Wasted perk slot
---
Interesting point. Gen rushing is actually pretty annoying if you're the killer. but this is just the view point of a green Rank Prestige 3 Claudette who isn't that good at Great skill checks
---
Hereditary is a favourite of mine. I'd pay top dollar for annie to be in this game
---
*laughs in asserting dominance by spinning towards them and forcing them to leave so they can‚Äôt rescue any currently hooked survivors*
---
Relevancy is that you can self care and do gens. Are you 12 and cant understand my sentence?
---
Sounds like the killer is ragequitting, it happens a lot more at higher ranks (newer players). Even at low ranks with more experienced players you see it pretty commonly. I'd say about every 10 games I get 1-2 disconnects (especially if we're doing really well).
---
Probably after a touching a puddle, they could also have some effect preventing the use of perks. Maybe (Frightened) or (Fear)
---
It's not just noed, there's other add-ons for killers or just they're base power is a insta down, jUsT cLeAnSe ToTeMs it's easy to say but survivors don't always have totems as their objective
---
*play ace and have built in iron will*
---
I thought the effect was already applied as of last update, doesn't it say so on ghsotfaces ability description?
---
"Someone probably already made this", you knew somebody already made it, didn't you?
---
love party boi myers
---
If you surrender as last man, I will bring you to hatch, and shut it as you crawl to it, I will then pick you up and escort you to the door and let you leave (I like tricking them with the hatch shut)
---
I've never understood the amount of hate selfcare gets. People like to throw around the number 32 as a huge discouraging factor. But the real number is 16. 
---
Selfcare only adds 16 seconds to being healed. If you spend 17 seconds looking for someone to heal you, you've already wasted more time than you would have just healing yourself. 
---
AND taken another person off a generator. 
---
The only issue I've ever had with self-care is people using it inefficiently. Running to the complete corner of the map to heal, using it when there's sloppy butcher, or people that seem to flee from the person who unhooked them so you can't heal them. 
---
I dig your build OP. Keep at it.
---
I kinda liked the blight event.
---
Dibs
---
&gt;if i get chased i usually fall really fast tbh x)
---
That's fine - but the best way to get better at something is exposure.
---
Unless it's SWF, when it comes to survivor play, everyone needs to run the relay. Everyone has at least 2 hooks in them, so in order to get the best outcome you should try to distract the killer for an equal amount of time.
---
I actually play like a "sneaky support" as well. I normally use Aftercare to see everyone and make judgements, and then the combinations of Lithe/Head On + Quick and Quiet + Dance With Me. I enjoy running the killer, but the best part is when I've wasted a bunch of their time and they lose me.
---
If David can‚Äôt punch the killer, he can at least distract them from their task....
---
No i actually didnt, but it is a meme that tru3 think everyone is a toxic sfw which is why i think someone already did this
---
How is the gameplay screwy? It does exactly what its supposed to. Ive been playing for 2 years and haven't really had any major issues.
---
Does work with WMI though which makes it very usable. Working with medkits would make it super viable though.
---
Poor thrill of the hunt :(
---
Lobby Dodge? Nah
---
Franklin's? Probably

Survivor mains: "LUL BABY KILLER TRASH POS"
---
*Gets killed*
---
Survivor mains: WTF NERF KILLERS DOOD THIS ISN'T FAIR I COULDNT LOOP FOR 5 GENS WTF IM RUNNING META PERKS AND TEABAGGING NOW KILL YOURSELF"
---
The truth is dead by daylight was bought by a mexican company  named LALA therefore we are only geting dia de muertos. that is why we got catrines.
---
then isnt that their own fault?
---
Thank you BHVR very helpful as always
---
You do realize cosmetic releases take hardly ANY dev resources right? this is a small team and theyre already maxed but don't think cosmetics hold up stuff hardly at all. Don't speak about game dev as if you understand, if you don't understand it.
---
&gt;self care and do gens
---
Uhh no you can't. It's one or the other, you can't do two objectives simultaneously in this game.
---
Ohh, did you mean to use the "then"? Yeah yeah, you can self-care and THEN do gens. But that's inefficient most of the time, letting down the team as you hold them back like a typical hotshot survivor.
---
Ok can‚Äôt talk anymore I‚Äôm gonna busy doing your mom
---
 I do play both sides, bleedout timer is 4 minutes. 
---
 You're telling me that 4 minutes of your life is excruciating agony?
---
 Just come browse reddit while you're slugged, lol.
---
 The fact you whine about this is telling.
---
It's still easier than 360s. Which is also a mistake on the killers part if they get 360ed on PC.
---
Awwww the salt is real that you couldnt leave me,  T R I G G E R E D
---
Wow okay. Thanks a lot for all the info. üòÅü§ô
---
I hope so. If I'm paired up with you then I don't want to be held back by survivors hiding in bushes and self-caring 24/7.
---
ty for do this u make me laught a lot xdd
---
SWFs are down voting like "hey let me be toxic with 3 friends and bully you WTF D00D", knowing that if they could see in advance that they would be playing against Spirit or whatever, they'd do the same exact thing rofl
---
ace main big brain
---
Can't relate, I play quentin and he moans like a little bitch
---
Cool story üëç
---
If there is 2 gens left i just do gens, i dont know if you have a brain, i have adrenaline too, if there are 5 gens left and none are started and im injured  im going to fucking self care bruv. Or else well all get hooked. Btw, if you knew layouts you wouldnt use dance with me
---
I faced so many Ghost faces with Thanatophobia last night and it was so annoying. I‚Äôm a rank 4 and kept losing cause I was the only one doing gens. The other survivors kept getting caught so easily üò¢
---
It's no one's fault, I'm not complaining about noed or survivors not cleansing, the point are insta downs that everyone just accepts it but insta heals everyone complaints. All I'm saying is if it's in the game just deal with it, except for spirit and nurse they're super unbalanced
---
Piggy is better at it since she puts her hands up kinda like a survivor
---
Sounds like an enemy standoh dah
---
2. Get over the fear. 3.Deal with the fear. 
---
Not the same thing.
---
I'm leveling ace now, I'm a main david and he also is a bad bitch
---
I dont hide to self care, theres no point, if someones getting chased the killer probably wont get me when im healing, so i just heal on gens
---
I would like some archeological stuff.
---
Mesoamerican Ruins.
---
Inside of an Egyptian pyramid.
---
Greek parthenon like ruins.
---
Roman Colloseum.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt see a reason why they couldn‚Äôt release the cosmetics, they‚Äôre already made.
---
You are wrong there no way I signed up for Reddit 4 years ago to read post and look at memes for things I like then stated actively using Reddit last year that's impossible
---
&gt;If there is 2 gens left i just do gens, i dont know if you have a brain, i have adrenaline too, if there are 5 gens left and none are started and im injured im going to fucking self care bruv.
---
That sentence was amazing, fam. Square up.
---
&gt;Btw, if you knew layouts you wouldnt use dance with me
---
The fact that I know layouts so well is what makes Dance With Me amazing. I can loop the killer for a gen or two, then instantly disappear.
---
There is no rush, usually 1 or 2 people will fuck around trying to save the guy essentially pausing the game anyway.

Because its a drop feed content to keep things fresh. This is only ruined because unfortunately for them we have easy access to the images on the files.
---
Who is jerma
---
Good.
---
No need to insult you again saying stupid shit like that says it all. This isn't my alt account the hell would I use my primary username for my alt Account?
---
Been using this for almost 9 years. Xbox, steam,psn, Nintendo, blizzard,Reddit crazy that it's my alt tho
---
Show me was referring to the counterplays...
---
She now can now sabotage traps that a survivor tries to remove, cutting the time left in half as well as disabling up to 2 Key boxes for 60 seconds (The key is moved into a different box)
---
He's more in the middle because of larger maps, where its harder to trap areas and you waste more time doing so. This gives survivors ample time to speedrun gens with little you can do about it unless you can lead them towards your trapped area. In that scenario he's ridiculously good, but it takes work to get them there and they can disarm your traps without certain add-ons, so I put him right in the middle.
---
Oh I know they drip feed I meant the event was postponed because they lost progress, but you can‚Äôt loose progress on finished models that are already in the game.
---
The wheres waldo beanie dwights aee the worst imo.  There are few and far between, but they always bully and loop the shit out of me  
---
~~also Ive never played against a good david~~
---
Oh yeah forgot to mention he inspired me with his EPIC animations
---
I agree with this statement more then anyone elses.
---
I mean, this ideas kinda silly, but if your gonna do it may as well do it for all characters. And although I get what your saying about the "Its a horror game" thing making it just some guy is just weird, make it something else somewhat scary looking makes more sense. Still think this ideas silly but whatevs, I dont know your friend so who am I to say?
---
I make sure to release the moment after a skill check and since I started timing it like that it hasn't exploded at me. Xbox.
---
How do you feel about Temple of Purgation? Personally, I always thought the red forest location is kinda weird for a temple like this
---
Vigos shroud is the far spawn, are you thinking of the shroud of binding?
---
Probably will but hopefully they're at the very worst just very small issues that won't have almost any impact on gameplay.
---
I was working on a few dlc ideas. One of the maps takes place on a yacht out at sea where a mass murder happened. Trails of blood and dismembered body parts all over the deck, the ball room and the suites. 
---
I also have an amusement park map in the making. A south american temple ruins, a rundown theater, I also considered a mine/cavern for one map along with a party that ended abruptly in a forest area but you can hear distorted party music along and a nearby waterfall.
---
I love that you see both sides of the coin.
---
I play killer only and was pretty biased of course, but lately i start to see that both sides are complaining because they are both right.
---
Both sides are treated unfairly because of weak balancing attempts
---
Ty!
---
I wish the plague had her own map not just in red forest.  A totally indoors map with the temple
---
I see that you are holding a  post legion nerfs knife.
---
&gt;Oh I know they drip feed I meant the event was postponed because they lost progress, but you can‚Äôt loose progress on finished models that are already in the game.
---
The models they were talking about probably are related to generators or hooks because everything else we could see in-game through the PTB.
---
Why does it take so long to get a match as killer?
---
A fun house of some sort. It'd be interesting to see a place where the hallways rotate on their own, some doors open and close randomly, stuff in rooms move, etc.
---
Thanks. Yeah, it was made so I just have to link it instead of spending 20min to explain it every time
---
It's just bad NetCode, that is what we should strive for
---
Haven‚Äôt played in months, and after an hour starting to realize why, but I thought matchmaking was changed? Didn‚Äôt they make it so SWF groups match with highest rank? Why am I getting SWF groups of two purple or green, hell even a couple reds, against my rank 15?

GEE I WISH I COULD PLAY AS HALLOWEEN 4 MYERS TOMORROW
---
I‚Äôm talking about the leaked cosmetics for Laurie strode and Michael Myers and ghostface and pig and tapp -_-
---
I've been shirtless for so long, I don't even remember what they days before were like. All I know is that there's no going back.
---
I bet all the hooked teammate that see you healing for hours on the other end of the map are very happy with you having fun.
---
Popular perks at any given time, currently it's bbq and ruin for killers, decisive strike for survivors etc
---
I see quentin, I upvote.
---
Just cleanse totems lmao.
---
just don't run self care and you are good to go.
---
I kinda like it, but it kinda looks like they could have done something much better.
---
Glad to see someone likes Quentin besides me
---
Nea is the entity in disguise
---
Yeah, it was very interesting! I'll have to try Legion a bit more.
---
Too many killers, not enough survivors. Which isn't surprising considering BP gain for survivors is pretty pitiful
---
I‚Äôd like but it‚Äôs at 69 :/
---
Did not know this. Given up running We'll make it and I didn't know they knew. All platforms? Gonna look out for that now. I am fairly new.
---
Well damn. All my dailys are killer based.
---
thanks! his animations are awesome
---
I haven't ground Steve up yet and I can't find the answer to this anywhere else, does Camaraderie also allow you to stop spamming the spacebar during struggle, or just pause the timer?
---
Sorry, I guess I struck a nerve somewhere. Don‚Äôt mean to talk to anyone like the role they choose often in a video game is somehow an identity or ‚Äúmain‚Äù.
---
Basic counterplay against hatchets exist. Therefore counterplay to iri head exists. The problem is that the penalty for missing or reward for outplaying is hugely diminished by infantry belt. Play against a huntress w just one hatchet. See how easy it it. Bet they‚Äôll wait until they have a sure shot before firing which means the survivor has a lot of wiggle room. 
---
The choice is the exact same whether black incense exists or not. Add ons and perks that the plague and survivor choose affect which way the survivor leans. Thanataphobia encourages cleansing, so does black incense. Further, the very nature of corrupt purge is that a single cleansing player can fuck the rest of the team. Hence why it‚Äôs called a team.
---
I am running We'll Make It, Solidarity, and Empathy. You do know the entire point of my build is to save them, right? I literally benefit hardcore by saving them.
---
it was the most incredible experience i ever had playing as survivor. they didnt even come with skillchecks. what doesn't count is how much more positive feedback they would have gotten if the silent majority just spoke up. 99% positive feedback against your 1% negative feedback. those flowers were incredible flowers&gt;winning
---
Yes, but you're not accounting for the fact that if I get someone to heal me, that's 2 people who are occupied and not working a generator instead of just 1.
---
If that was the case I'd honestly let the survivors do the gens. I'd go open the gate for them and would be like "go drown"
---
That would be awesome. Probably the top perk I want to try out at the moment.
---
One of the top results on Amazon. It's $20 or so
---
I run corrupt, ruin/pop, infections and whispers/discordance
---
Again, you'd be in the minority, a good chunk of the people who dislike legion don't not like him because he was OP, I personally didn't even feel that way. Bottom line is he was a huge disappointment to the community and for all of those reasons, I agree.
---
Leaving the match doesn't leave the game. They didn't 'get back' to it, they just never left.
---
No ye weren't!
---
I really like the yacht idea, very nicely detailed. The theater one would be great as well
---
That poor pallet
---
To be fair, they may change what "trumps stealth perks" means to also include "beats Undetectable".
---
Since Kindred is an anti camp perk, I don't think anyone would complain if Kindred was the only Aura perk to beat the status.
---
Edit: not that trump, stupid phone..
---
"No one cared who I was until I took off the shirt"
---
So you really trying to tell me that if you take 4 rank 15 survivors and place them against a rank 1 killer the 15s have a shot?
---
Can you "main" a perk? Lol
---
stuns last 2 seconds, 1 if they have Enduring
---
If you're standing there for more than a second, you actually didn't get much. It would be better to throw the pallet down and attempt to loop it again while looking at the killer. If they kick it, go to another loop, if they don't, loop the pallet.
---
If you camp it, they will kick it right away, which will remove most of the fun both sides have during chases
---
I also don't know how good you are at looping. Sometimes you can manage to loop the structure another time before dropping the pallet down and still being safe
---
Yeh, they definitely dropped the ball this October, Like I said I'm frustrated too and especially with them missing the Halloween window, even if it did start last week thats way too late it should be the start of October until end of Halloween night. 
---
That being said the rift had event currency in it and was tied to the event in that case or at least would link to the event in the following week or so. Either way, I think people were way too harsh but again just my opinion. But I appreciate your standpoint and I see where your coming from
---
I miss placed the bracket, I meant to include that in the "aside from their teachables" part
---
why does Franklin's Demise and Surge only work on basic attacks, but PWYF still causes you to lose a token from power attacks *even if you miss?* these perks would be nowhere near broken if those things were changed. the devs seem intent to ensure that potentially mid-tier perks stay low-tier.
---
"Must have been bullshit on his side" Good to know Otz actively thinks about how his opponents feel while not 100% throwing away his enjoyment. We need more people in the community like him
---
You get less points as killer if they DC than if you sacrifice them. Especially if you never get to hook them. Pretty frustrating when going for adepts, seems like it will be an easy game then they dc
---
Yeah, but the end game chafe is so toxic.
---
It's not a gay Boi if they are a girl.
---
Xbox is showing the **Withering Blight Event** on the Dashboard.
---
Listen here you little shit
---
I've been working on the dlc idea for a while. I just need to tweak one of the killers perks a bit.
---
Uhhh, yeah. My bad :x
---
David is ugly
---
Well, what rank are you? It seems like lower rank games favor killers more because survivors are not as optimal. In higher rank games, survivors are much more optimal, and mid-tier and lower killers can struggle to even get a 1k. Map size and balance is also a huge factor for how well a killer does in higher tiers of play. Balance can be incredibly survivor favored in high purple and definitely red ranks.
---
If you have DC prepare for a hard camp because even if it is nerfed I still don't appreciate the perk and camp anyone who uses it, my golden rule.
---
well damn. I guess that answers my question
---
&gt;People like to throw around the number 32 as a huge discouraging factor. But the real number is 16.
---
Because the real number is actually 32. Instead of healing, you can decide to utilise perks that synergise with being injured and do generators instead. Adrenaline heals you within 0 seconds. You can do other things apart from healing yourself. Staying hurt is a valid option, and when it comes to the end of the game, usually the best option.
---
And even if the number was 16, I guarantee you there are potatoes out there who can't last 16 seconds in a chase. I'm red ranks, I watched a Meg get hit through a pallet, drop the pallet, get mingamed and then go down within 16 seconds.
---
Me getting a DS skill check, and missing it
---
No it costs shards to buy perks from shop
---
Thats not due to dedicated servers. This happened to my bubba on xbox two months ago. I even clipped it
---
Why not? after all everything is made by the entity, you could open a door inside a boat and appear in a forest.
---
You can play however you want, my issue is this post makes it look like: "see, I am just doing my thing and people don't want me to!" but in reality its a bit more complicated than that and its not elitism, it can be very frustrating dying on first hook because the rest of the team is selfcaring for ages.
---
You run a healing wacky build? cool. Don't play the victim though if you are actively making other have to compensate your shortcomings.
---
Cannon ball exit?  Who‚Äôs belly flopping?
---
Well for germany it was cancelles ON the day of the event, very disappointing for a horror game not having a halloween event.  
---
me and my gf stopped playing right after they cancelled the event until they drop the event.  
---
i understand that there are major bugs in it, but pressing the x2 key for bloodpoints is something even they are capable to do.
---
Honestly in my matches there were massive suicides, and no one did gens.
---
I thought they didn't put him in MK11 because he'd be too OP
---
Double chain addons, heavy gen patrolling.
---
I change it slightly and use the purple chains with red paint + thanata. It's less slower overall but more constant. I also use surveillance.
---
Basically it's like 3 gen Doc, but instead of 3 gen Doc it's 5 Gen Freddy because it takes forever to do anything.
---
Thats like me saying my taxes are never late because I dont pay them...
---
Yep, that part of the event is over though. But we got a new halloween one. Community event to kill a bunch of zombies with wizard hats.
---
People did flowers then suicided on hook to get more serum, no thanks
---
I love this idea so much...would be so much fun!
---
In Dying Light?
---
He said you can prevent NOED before Endgame. You know... unlike Adrenaline. Adrenaline isn't op or anything though
---
Since this is based off of the remake, I feel like Jason‚Äôs power should be using tunnels under the map along with the throwing knife thing.
---
So a whopping zero you nerd
---
Dead by Hitbox
---
But does self-care imply that you ignore hooked survivors? It's the people who use it, not the perk itself.
---
I get that, but I still don‚Äôt think there should be an exception. It‚Äôs pretty disappointing to be having a good start to the game and imagining all those bp you‚Äôre gonna get just for a killer to DC and you get like 4,000 bp because the killer DCed his first chase.
---
I wanted to do something different besides just opening the door and running away. One of the other maps I was considering them opening the gates then the animation shows them climbing out of the map.
---
Yes but leaving as soon as you hear a heart beat would be waisting a unnecessary amount of time and would make you a worse survivor
---
Nerd
---
Back when Iron grasp was S Tier. Even had builds using both agitation and IG to guarantee the basement hook.
---
A museum, a school, a neighbourhood, super market, a mall, mansion, castle, jungle, themepark, a park, zoo, some downtown area maybe, some kind of office building maybe?
---
I mean I don't see deathgarden releasing anytime I have over 300 hours in it and I love the community but the devs are constantly screwing up balance,
---
Would've been better than nothing üòí
---
Yeah, i agree. Most of the time it‚Äôs very ‚Äòus vs them‚Äô so when one side calls the other out for toxicity is usually answered with a ‚Äòcry some more‚Äô or some bullshit like that; but survivors can keep each other from being dicks.
---
I‚Äôve been on the receiving end too, playing as the plague (I got her as a gift and wanted to try her out with shitty internet and no killer experience) and got looped to hell and back by a Quentin on the swamp map. He let himself get downed at the end but I let him go because he deserved it. In endgame chat his teammates sent me the usual ez bullshit, but he was really supportive and encouraging me and I still remember that kind loop-master stranger lmao
---
Feel free to make it one. I wrote it with the intention of it coming off as one.
---
Alrighty then I‚Äôll stop arguing your right I‚Äôm wrong and I should shut up. *Even though I still think otherwise and I‚Äôm purely doing to stop this argument on a 2 day old post*
---
These are the ones i can think of
---
A mall
---
High School
---
Carnival fair
---
Castle
---
Mansion
---
An abandoned factory
---
Summer camp
---
A ship
---
A friend i have is a toxic FUK. Everytime we are at the exit gates i must tell him to stop teabagging like a toxic man. He just wont stop bming. 
---
He pallet teabags, flashlight clicks
---
And calls the caller an asshole if he gets camped lol
---
*121
---
Don‚Äôt try and take it off and everything will be fine.
---
In honestly you should do it cause you're wrong. Just search my name on psn or Xbox you will see achievement and trophies earned about idk almost 10 years ago now.
---
Oinking at gens while survivors work on them is a top 10 experience in this game imo.
---
So OP is bannable then?
---
The coal mine.
---
Imagine camping someone after they have a trap on
---
Ahaha no problem ;) 
---
That made me laugh too, making it. I had this idea a while ago in my head and finally took time to do it :D
---
Ohthankgod. Imagine if they were all replaced with volatiles, and it was night only.
---
Not bad, rather accurate as hell
---
I had the game crash for the first time yesterday after 300 hours while I was trying to play Doctor. Every time I shocked someone it was like my computer had a seizure.
---
True, but if you want to incorporate the above into a playstyle you need to be able to heal multiple times. One only has access to so many good medkits and addons.
---
Tell me with a straight face that if survivors could defeat the killer and make them crawl around for 4 wasted minutes every game that this sub wouldn't be swarming with posts about this very mechanic?  The killers on here seem to be very tone deaf on this topic. We both know they would freak the fuck out.  Also it is longer than 4 minutes if they down the other survivor after he picks you up that's a fresh bleedout timer to cheese.  It can hold on 7 or 8 mins between the two of them....that's a good chunk of a game right there.  An additional game both sides could play and get way more bloodpoints than the 4th kill which you're still likely to get anyways by closing the hatch in a timely fashion.  The EGC hatch is so killer friendly it's a joke.  Mandatory 3rd man slugs is completely thoughtless and unnecessary at this point.  This isn't the old bullshit hatch. You can close it.  I just don't understand the entitlement built around this in killers heads where they don't feel like scumbags for mandatory wasting that type of time on a game after game basis.  I feel like absolute slime when I force slugs in that scenario just to prevent a game mechanic from spawning.  The time wasting scenarios you put forth were examples of the survivors being massive dicks.  That doesn't give us a free pass to do it to them now.  Devs added egc to remove survivor BM not to create killer BM.
---
‚ÄúI DC instead of learning counterplay :ccc‚Äù 
---
I never have problem with spirit, iron will or not. However disconnecting is a shitty thing to do, and I can‚Äôt wait until there is a ban system in place for consistent disconnects. If you really don‚Äôt want to be in game, kill yourself on hook.
---
The entire point of this thread outside of the inevitable selfcare drama was using builds you want to use. OP even has adrenaline IN the meme. 
---
And your solution is just use adrenaline and build around being injured.  lol
---
I know an endless argument when I see one. Good day sir.
---
No you can do it in public. I was playing as a Meg and I spawned in and saw 5 gens and then suddenly over the horizon I see a Myers and hillbilly. I don‚Äôt know how but it is possible.
---
He's not your pal, buddy.
---
Thanks. But you should reply to that guy in denial instead.
---
Im assuming he means like walking extra slow as jason or poping out from corners to scare people, shit like that.
---
a compact streamer
---
Op can use builds he wants to use.
---
I can also be annoyed with bad players.
---
What does OP want? Everyone to think he is the most helpful and useful survivor ever?
---
No argument here, these statements are both truths. Have a good day mate.
---
This was a public match and I had no clue what was going on, doubt I can be banned.
---
I love following them while oinking til they finally realise i am freindly
---
You can‚Äôt run ruin and devour because the second they find out you have ruin, they‚Äôll be on the lookout for hexes, meaning you‚Äôll never get a stack before your devour breaks
---
a wild claudette herd appears.
---
I mean, it is a nice christmas gift to get the event!
---
What is the point of solidarity when you have self care? Your perk build makes no sense. You just took 4 perks that have something to do with healing and being injured and said ‚Äúme support healer‚Äù.
---
Also what a fucking hypocrite.
---
&gt;You, 6 hours ago: Or just use better perks and not hinder yourself because you want to use a sub par perk when they're are multiple better ones?
---
Exactly. Why use self-care and hinder yourself because you want to use a sub-par perk when there are multiple better ones available, like Inner Strength or Adrenaline.
---
Someone fucking cue the Seinfield theme.
---
I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm in the minority. Legion is cool to me and that‚Äôs all I care about.
---
Htiboxes for the win! Also, dedicated servers have made latency and lag worse than killers hosting lobbies... I'd rather have a few shitty lag games than ALL shitty lag games. Step it up Behaviour. üíØ
---
That's the thing, I rarely every play against the spirit (I get her every 1 every 50-100 games)
---
I wanna serve justice though.
---
Its even worse because hes running Solidarity. So if he wants to use one perk he isnt gonna be using the other.
---
Ive mained ace since the moment that smug Italian bastard came out and got lucky hes not labeled "toxic"
---
Where is that Quentin when we need him
---
I've noticed matchmaking sucking as a sole survivor. 
---
As purple I regularly will be matched with two greys minimum. 
---
So either the killer is way too high a lvl for the poor lvl 20 newbies, OR the survivor is approx lvl 15 and I shouldn't be matched against the poor guy. 
---
The system seems pretty broken, still.
---
Enjoy all the DCs lol
---
Use an exhaustion perk, I enjoy Balanced Landing as it makes me more aware of the map, also it's fun to heal up and bolt away of they hook on the hill.
---
Lol, so what did I do wrong?
---
I can loop extra times around the pallet depending on if I think I can safely loop it again or not. I tend to camp the pallet if I feel like I'm using too many pallets and I just want to try and escape better. Otherwise I just run around the down pallets unless they break them instantly.
---
People who DC against post rework Legion are pathetic
---
I main Ghostface and you just offended me.
---
You did your job. If no ones doing gens and just taking turns on a hook/healing only, you'll never get out.
---
FeelsOverRun :/
---
still better than 3
---
Cool meme bro mind if I repost it too?
---
16 extra seconds. Keep your panties from bunching there champ.
---
Freddy actually doesn't have the Undetectable status effect. Rather the Oblivious effect is applied to sleeping survivors. So no matter how close he is, the game will always consider you outside of his terror radius if you are sleeping.
---
Myers on the other hand is getting the Undetectable status added to Tier 1, but that is more of a nerf than anything because it means he is no longer immune to perks like Spine Chill and Premonition.
---
It was fun having an alternative objective. The problem was, people sucked off the entity's teets and then killed themselves as soon as possible to get to the next match, and so matches weren't being played for like a week or two.
---
Some people just want a fun game, I don't do it, but I don't blame them.
---
You just said it yourself flowers&gt;winning. People would do that, then suicide. It ruined the actual game while it was going. Don't assume the silent majority liked it lol.
---
They do move in herds...
---
I agree, I would personally have no qualms with Kindred being the only Aura perk to counter stealth killers camping. It would serve to further drag the terrible strategy that is camping into the mud, which is what every sane person who plays this game wants.  
---
The only people who wouldn't be keen on this idea are the incels that camp in at least 90% of their matches. You know, the ones who genuinely believe it's the best strategy in the game and seemingly don't believe in having fun.
---
I think its a pretty good one and I dont ask for anything more as it would be over powering.
---
When you're late for Brony Club
---
I‚Äôve yet to play against a true Forever Freddy, but I played against a Legion with increased mend duration, Thana, Sloppy, and Dying Light. It wasn‚Äôt that bad while I was the obsession. It took someone DSing for me to realize how bad it was. I have never wanted to DC so badly before or just let the killer kill me, but holy shit it was awful.
---
**Edit:** an awful fucking typo, because my phone hates me
---
you‚Äôre not my buddy, buddy.
---
I totally agree. Otz is always super  wholesome :)
---
Someone posted an old-timey scuba geared man not too long ago...so to basically build on what you've said, I think it'd be awesome to see a map around a harbor area, light house or something to that affect. It'll definitely be different but the map team (or their equivalent) might find it challenging. Edit: Spelling and phrasing.
---
Walk right towards him
---
Why
---
yeah they both got downed in the first minute and left lol
---
Why not
---
yep
---
We could've been friends
---
Yeah, I'm leveling my now, I'll enter the Ace gang
---
I'm not expecting to always win. If I got the perks to slow the game down after unlocking them it wouldn't matter, but, you know, rng Bloodweb. I've had lvl 40 killers with no slowdown perks. I also find that games are either a 4k or 0k instead of the average 2k, but that might just be me. 
---
 Personally I think gens should be either reworked or removed and replaced with something else. Gens are still currently too easy and boring. Making the repair time longer will make people pissed and quit the game for good. As someone who plays both sides I already get bored doing gens.
---
I think even level 250 players would shit their pants
---
That really sucks. :(
---
I always go for the down even if I think they might have DS.
---
Well in I understand both sides. Sometimes you have pitty and let them go, but sometimes you are farming, just waited 20 min for a Match and don,t want to go out with almost no points.
---
two rats fight for another rat, colorized.
---
jokes aside i love everything quentin thank you for this!
---
To be fair. It's not TECHNICALLY a Halloween event. It's like a monster created by serum thing. But yes. It is a Halloween event so it would be nice to have it fit the mood of the year
---
whats a forever freddy set up look like and whats it do?
---
What they work quite well together. He's playing battlefield medic. He swoops in, unhooks and heals them super fast healing himself partially during this time. 
---
At this point the killer is either otw back to the unhooked person, or actively stalking/chasing someone. 
---
This build enables the unhooked person to then jump into the fray in whatever way they need to. If that doesn't involve healing OP to full, that's no problem, he's got selfcare.
---
Forgot "WHATNOW".
---
Ohhhh okay, that makes sense
---
Swing Chains, Jump Rope, Thanatophobia, Dying Light, Ruin. Maybe throw Pop in there for good measure. When Freddy gets some Thanat/DL stacks and you‚Äôre in the Dream World your action speed basically grinds to a halt. Autodidact at max stacks heals for 50%, so I was still healing people very quickly.
---
&gt;"Freddy actually doesn't have the Undetectable status effect. Rather the Oblivious effect is applied to sleeping survivors."  
---
Oh yeah, you're right. That's my bad. Cheers for the correction.  
---
As for Myers, I'm pretty sure the Undetectable status effect being added to his Tier 1 is just for the sake of clarifying that yes, you are indeed a sneaky boi. I highly doubt they'll remove his immunity to non-Aura detection perks (namely Spine Chill and Premonition) while he's in Tier 1, because that would utterly destroy his viability.
---
Yup. I would rather get shit on in 5 minutes by Omega Blink instead of grinding out a 20 minute game where 2 gens get done lol.
---
If there is a map called coal mine, I rest my case.  We need a proper coal mine.
---
I had a Nea in a match recently who trashtalked our baby nurse at the end of a match. Like, I get it, you have a smurf account for when you feel like bullying baby killers. Don't be an asshole to the baby or else she'll become a facecamping jerk later.
---
What the hell were you waiting for? Honestly deserved it.
---
What‚Äôs this image from
---
The point is that ‚Äúefficient‚Äù survivors do not waste any time healing at all. They arent spending 32 seconds nor are they spending 16 seconds healing unless absolutely necessary. They are working on generators when not in chase or unhooking a teammate. Dead Harding for distance will buy you time in chase and lets you be incredibly greedy when running loops.
---
Not healing in general saves so much time because you didnt Self Care, you were working on a generator. And you can still waste the killers time when looping by dead harding for distance.
---
This strategy is exacerbated even further when the survivors are all running Adrenaline. Theres almost no margin for error for the killer. They arent wasting time healing, they are completing their objective while getting healed+speed boost at the endto seal the deal.
---
The devs have leaked their Shipping build,[https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/dou015/halloween\_event\_new\_dates\_leaked\_but\_will\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/dou015/halloween_event_new_dates_leaked_but_will_that/)
---
Which means, either the Event starts today at Eastern Time Midnight( Which is highly fucking unlikely)
---
Or, the most likely option is, that the event launches at Halloween, same as their Twitch Rivals event.
---
Can Borrowed Time withstand a chainsaw from Billy?
---
Does it withstand a hit from NOED?
---
What about Tombstone?
---
Literally nothing wrong in this clip. Bubba was right up his ass. Throwing that pallet was stupid
---
Jewelry box is better than the lunge addon imo. But I love this build
---
Swing Chains reduces action speed for all survivors and the penalty is multiplied for every survivor in the Dream World. 
---
Jump Rope adds a flat 9% (or maybe 12%) action speed reduction to every survivor in the Dream World. 
---
When you stack these 2 on top of Thanatophobia and Dying Light you can get some pretty insane slow down.
---
I know I would.
---
*The Whole Community: DING DONG YOUR OPINION IS WRONG.
---
those people were wrong. icky flowers were awesome
---
Uninstall the game then? The game is plenty of fun on both sides. Sure bad manners is annoying but if you never let it upset you, you'll still have fun.
---
The "real" reason is that you can avoid a regular m1 and be grabbed instead, which circumvent some perks like preventing an extra stack of STBFL for the killer or in some niche case, not get inflicted by sloppy butcher
---
Definitely swap premonition with spine chill
---
At the end, I only get tilted when I play killer. Survivor, even tho I sometumes get salty, is slowly becoming more of a walk in the park. At the end, no one really gets perks to repair faster and that is suposed to be my main focus so I am equal to the others
---
It was so much fun. People take this game way too seriously and whined about it though so it'll never happen again.
---
I never saw much suiciding at all, either.
---
I'm an offensive main and I find this Claudette
---
Or a rank 2 that realizes it‚Äôs more efficient to take 4 seconds to let someone heal you so you can both do gens than spend 5 minutes running to a corner of the map to go heal yourself with a slow ass self care just for the extra 600 points
---
So you're assuming just because I run Self-Care, I'm keeping from saving people? Again, even though ***my entire fucking build*** is based around saving people, healing them, and then booking it so I can heal myself if I was hurt when I saved, you still assume I sit on my ass? Are you dense? Do you lack the understanding of what these perks do? What is it?
---
Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff
---
Solidarity barely heals you when in combination with We‚Äôll Make It. And if you have Self Care, you are going to instantly heal yourself when the killer is not chasi you or else you arent even using the perk.
---
The build just doesnt work.
---
Not really, we all gave you good advices you just stick your fingers in your ear because you don‚Äôt want to hear the reality for he problem lol.
---
Or anniversary
---
My connection isn't that bad.
---
People flame me sometimes when I play killer for the dailies and just let them farm. I just tell them to take their free pip and EZ blood points and move on to the next match, but I don't understand why anyone would have a problem with it? They are truly the Karen's of the DBD community.
---
bubba be like "DO IT LOOK LIKE I CARE DOE"
---
What are the benefits of Spine Chill over Premonition, and what character do I need to unlock it in?
---
That's like, your opinion man.
---
because insta downs have counter play - insta heals dont
---
At first I thought Solidarity was a good perk then I read the % and the downside about medkits and I threw it in the garbage disposal. I will play it only when they remove the downside and increase the % to 80%.
---
He looks so much creepier without teeth on his mask üòÇ
---
Poor David. He may be a tough guy, but on the inside, he‚Äôs sensitive
---
This isn't them, they're spectating. Agreed the person deserved it though.
---
Downvoted for being right. It's what the DbD sub does best.
---
The effort put into this its too much for the toxic community of dbd
---
A small price to pay for salvation.
---
Anyone can get spine chill but I would swap dark sense for iron will which you can get as Jake parks teachable.
---
Edit: also spine chill has no cool down. It requires a little bit more game sense but definitely superior to premonition.
---
Actually brilliant
---
Whoosh, It wasn't meant to be taken seriously kiddo but I appreciate the support for actual balance
---
it's not exactly no TR though. it's just transferred to a person you hit, which means they're directly in front of you anyway. so the TR is still near the killer to begin with. and it's use is limited to the first hit as well, since when you down them, you're standing on top of them, meaning the TR is still a 32 meter radius around you. same for while you're carrying and hooking them. 
---
the only way it *could* be useful is if you hit someone while another is a moderate distance nearby and can't see you, but you saw their hiding place. and even then it's only one stealth hit at best. allowing it to affect more than just the obsession would at least increase the odds of it being used a little bit, but still rarely. and there's no reason for it to be limited to basic attacks only, either. Plague and Huntress are the only ones who have ranged attacks, and Plague has only moderate range while Huntress has the lullaby anyway.
---
BHVR said the Q&amp;A will be this week and considering they usually stream on Thursday at 2PM ET it will probably be on this Thursday at 2PM ET
---
its actually....not an opinion. Solidarity heals less the faster you heal someone. You are frying your brain by remembering and using ‚Äúquirky‚Äù reddit phrases.
---
Ohh right I didn't realise they were spectating üòÇ
---
Or put a trap right before the locker. It that isn't obvious, it only works for trapper.
---
in my opinion i‚Äôd swap balanced landing for sprint burst, if you‚Äôre gonna be walking/crouching most of the time it gives a great opportunity to manage your exhaustion and pop sprint burst when the killer comes your way. i‚Äôd also personally swap dark sense with bond because you get quite a lot of map awareness.
---
I won't heal people if:
---
* I want us to focus on a gen
---
* The killer is the Legion
---
* The killer is the Plague
---
How'd the marriage go?
---
*its own
---
Holy shit yes
---
Wtf was she even doing? Wasn't even trying to be toxic or anything she was just being fucking stupid
---
This is absolutely fascinating, thank you for sharing. Every player should read this.
---
Haha. Showing your age by thinking that's a reddit phrase.
---
It's so strange that only 1 person on every single team does gens lol thats why a play swf all the time cuz my brother will get on and do gens while I'm literally in the other room looping the killer
---
Alright, thanks :)
---
Cool thanks
---
Lol, can he do an analysis of Dark Souls next? No other game stepped on my nuts harder than that franchise.
---
I main Plague, and typically I will let the person who cleanses the most live the longest or survive. They help ensure that everyone else dies, and it's like a back alley arrangement, but it is seldom that they ever escape due to 'knowing when to cleanse' or being better. I just wanted the person making me stronger to be alive longer.
---
Thats not scream, thats Holler
---
They're doing their best you koala shit eating cunt. Go choke on some spoiled banana bread.
---
How dare you use SrGrafo for hatred.
---
Yea. It would make no sense for them to release it next month when everyone is getting in the mood for thanksgiving and out of the spooky Halloween mood
---
np!
---
You‚Äôre talking about stuff that‚Äôs happening within these last few months. I‚Äôm an old player, these devs have been pathetic for 2+ years and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not ready to just let go because they still make the same mistakes.
---
What happened when the game started? If it actually did lol.
---
For #2, The nice thing to do would be to punish the shitty teammate that farmed the hooked guy when you were right there
---
And in solo queue you don‚Äôt know how many are done. Did my teammates contribute this time? Did they completely ignore totems? Not a single was to tell as a survivor besides checking literally every spawn and making sure nothing is there, wasting a bunch of time.
---
Huh
---
I don't usually see it as farming, tbh, but i see where you're coming from.
---
It can withstand chainsaws and NOED. It cannot withstand Tombstone because tombstone is not actually a hit.
---
&gt; Dark devotion would have basically no counterplay, currently, u see the obsession gets hit, if u know they have it, u can be prepared for the killer to sneak up
---
it already has a time limit. and it's only useful to sneak up on people if you know they were nearby when you hit another but can't see you, which they almost certainly did. and it's useless if you down the person, because then the TR is still surrounding you when you pick up and carry them. allowing it to proc on all survivors would give us a little more diversity once in a while without giving much strength to anyone.
---
But it's ma daily
---
Spine chill will still work against stealth killers
---
Who TF runs TWO exhaustion perks?
---
Right. It‚Äôs alright to loop the killer and shit but I swear I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I see someone run past a gen on the other side of the map from the killer as He just downs someone. Then wanna run all the way across the map to get the save that someone else ends up getting anyway.
---
ask him, I don't know
---
feels bad man
---
There should have been a stun that is why Otz was so confused as well.
---
lol you can play the game a lot of ways but not everyone has to gen rush with sprint burst. I'm infinitely better at not getting downed with balanced landing than doing gens with sprint burst and getting caught with sprint burst. Your observation is based on your play style and you can't expect everyone to gen rush. Im saying sprint burst made me a worse survivor because you never learn how to outsmart a killer you just get a head start and after that you've got nothing, not being able to hide well is what makes you a bad survivor it's not about rushing its about not getting downed. You can actually sit on gens without sprint burst when you know how to use pallets to me sprint burst puts you in a more vulnerable position where there aren't safe pallets. But you can use sprint burst all you want but i recommend learning how to play without needing exhaustion perks. Because i will have Plunderer's chest and while you rush 3 gens and get hooked ill have done nothing except search for keys and never get found by the killer so don't be mad at stealth players when you get hooked
---
When is the Halloween update coming out? I thought it was today
---
The only time I have a hard time doing gens is when there's a ruin.
---
 So I did dedicate myself to seeking out in hopes that my team will continue to work on generators.  Usually they don't.....
---
iirc, aren't there actually two score events called "protection?" like, one is when you get his in the general area of an ally, while the other is when you take a hit while so close to them that it would have hit them if not for you. it's a bad naming issue.
---
Prove Thyself gives a repair boost and can help guarantee max obj points for the WGLF stacks.
---
You can tell where they're going, and knocking someone out of the game is the best way to slow it.
---
wailing ‚Äúbell‚Äù legion
---
it might be time to update my flair to 1 day
---
Iamcows
---
Idk what ds is so I'm assuming it's down syndrome because that's makes this pretty funny
---
M&amp;A/Shadowborn shouldn‚Äôt stack with Furtive Chase
---
Agreed, the consistent communication, frequent updates and free content have been horrible, fml.
---
I played a game as gen grabber spirit the other day(yes i know im toxic prayer beads spirit)and I managed to grab someone that was gen tapping,but the dude who was holding m1 managed to escape during the animation somehow
---
What happened to the other players icons.
---
I mean, *you* can‚Äôt be but the guy who glitched into becoming the second Killer absolutely can. Unless of course this is a brand new glitch and people are just randomly getting assigned as a second Killer.
---
the longer you look at this, the better it gets
---
Honestly I'd really like this as it could present some interesting mindgames.
---
I really feel like Furtive Chase was designed the way it was almost entirely to compensate for I'm All Ears' old design where it only worked outside the Terror Radius. But now that IAE was reworked to be actually somewhat usable Furtive Chase is left in an awkward spot of being completely worthless outside of niche meme builds. (Judith's Journal Myers)
---
It got delayed due to bugs they found internally. No new release date as of now :/
---
Two of them died and I escaped through hatch with a key as I was being chased on my last hook. This is me spectating the Nea lol
---
Last year people would do is collect the flowers and dc and they still collect it I think gens are fine
---
The only time I have a problem with somebody doing a generator is if I'm hooked and all 3 of them are doing generators.  Now if all 3 of them are working on the same day doesn't upset me as much but when all 3 of them are working on individual generators at least one of them preferably the  Person who is closest could try to unhook me....
---
 I had a game the other day I was playing with a friend he and one of the 2 randoms was working on a generator on the opposite end of the map the other random was right next to me working on a gen  All by himself while the killer was chasing down the other 2 nowhere near me and would have been able to get back to us in time he could have unhooked me what he did he sat there and ignored me I went through the entire hanging phase waiting and the entire struggling face he didn't even try to get off that generator that he kept messing up
---
I don't know you think I fucking use that shit? I'm going to take a perk that helps me *avoid* getting hooked, not a perk that lets me get camped for 30 extra seconds.
---
That's not a quirky reddit phrase... it's a movie quote. Also, it's still helpful regardless and really nice when you don't have WMI to help out. I can run whatever I want, dude.
---
I believe the reason the event is postponed is because there was a power outage at BHVR causing them to lose the data for the event and they‚Äôre working hard to get it up as soon as possible so please don‚Äôt hate them
---
Do better then, tough guy
---
Nothings better than when you see a flashlight and you bring lightborn. They try to pallet blind and they get so salty when it just gets them down.
---
I think you did a good job and should be proud of it!
---
That's very true. But if Billy or in our wild imagination, bubba, was a top tier at spirit level. They would say the same too
---
Even if Billy is spirit level for map pressure alone
---
Yep! BL can extend loops on certain maps and be pretty great at creating more distance, while if you get a flat map, DH becomes the more used option for extending loops.
---
yeah.
---
I'm not saying you're this guy, but I've also gotten really shitty and enraging advice from escaped survivors.
---
Like 4 man SWF with instas and toolboxes on Lerys telling me I should use my saw more on Leatherface, implying the main reason I lost is I don't know how to play and not all the OP shit that they used on me.
---
I am Rank 1. So usually I play against decent survivors ofc some games there are some potatoes or DCs but thats just some, most of them are getting played normally and I cant remember when I lost the last time with Spirit. (Loose for me is when someone leaves through the exit door).
---
But why not just run DH, which is good on any map and gain an extra perk slot?
---
I feel like this meme is kind of out of place considering remember that the rock did eventually win the race in that episode
---
A stun *rather* than a hit? No there shouldn't. He was too close for that
---
Can't wait for bans to dc abusers
---
My competitiveness takes a different form. It‚Äôs a symbiotic relationship! I get the pleasure of another‚Äôs suffering while the other three survivors get the pleasure of completing gens. It really is a win-win! Thank you much and same to you!
---
Yeah? Good.
---
And if they weren‚Äôt working on it there‚Äôs still nothing we could do do whats your point? And saying ‚Äúthey‚Äôre trying‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help at all either, it‚Äôs just defending them. Saying what they are doing is not good enough is helpful because it‚Äôs community feedback that we are not pleased and they need to change something, if they interact with the community then they can receive more constructive feedback, but that initial feedback of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not impressed‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm impressed‚Äù is the first step.
---
If we can‚Äôt see the killer he shouldn‚Äôt be able to see  us in the lobby. It‚Äôs annoying when killer dodges the lobby if he sees flashlights, or keys. When I bring a key killers like to tunnel me.
---
There are actual hitbox issues in the game: when you are healing, working on a generator, or in much of any interaction at all, your hitbox does not change, instead it uses the standing hitbox. This is primarily only relevant for Huntress hatchets however. Hatchet hitboxes are also larger than they should be, protruding spherically around the hatchet a little too generously. I also would not be at all surprised if the hitboxes on pallet and vault interactions are wonky, and ridiculous hits on those are caused not solely by latency.
---
Dedicated servers as they are live on PC currently do not employ lag compensation on hits, the killer is the sole authority on those. So hits are still entirely "killer-screen" - if the killer tells the server "I hit a survivor on my screen", the server counts that as a hit no matter what, and so the killer still has the outright latency advantage, only now with more latency in the network, increasing said advantage, leading to many ridiculous hits. I hope they will actually implement server-sided hit detection or lag-compensated hit validation, but I wouldn't count on it. Servers as they are now do not improve the gameplay, and are not even equal to peer-to-peer.
---
I wasn't wrong on that.  You simply didn't properly understand what it is I typed.  If nea has been slugged for 3 minutes and eventually gets picked up by Dwight but now Dwight gets downed and slugged while killer looks for Nea now, Dwight is a fresh slug and has his own separate 4 minute bleedout timer.  The cancer game continues now while the killer simply uses the other survivor and his timer as the slugged floor decoration.  Follow me?
---
This
---
I think it's great fun. I did buy the stranger things dlc, but that's all I've bought. Plenty of good perks unlocked through bloodppints. And it's just a few hours of gameplay do get good enough to have fun. 
---
Just wait for good sales to get the DLC.
---
found it on Facebook
---
He‚Äôs probably around hag right now. He‚Äôs very map dependent, but a good ghostface is actually kind of a pain to deal with.
---
Maybe get some internet?
---
At high rank it‚Äôs farming unless the guy is about to hit half or completely die
---
Wait, that was you!

Just pauses. If you stop spamming spacebar you die.

Oh! I'll look her up right now! Thanks for the tip!

Dedicated servers are the reason I came back to this game, finally I have a stable ping that doesn't fluctuate at the whim of some ignorant ass who decided to run torrents or stream video at the same time they play the game. The playing field is now even, and it's fantastic.
---
Previously I never broke rank 12 after maybe 4-5 months, now I'm rank 6 and climbing since jumping back in for dedicated.
---
Well I'm never high rank so...
---
Because balanced is good even when exhausted
---
Personally I say no, I fell in love with the game despite the problems it has, but if you feel you just don't want to deal with those then I say return it
---
&gt;because she‚Äôs probably the i it killer you can‚Äôt really loop.
---
Nurse

Put a couple hours into the game using the already unlocked characters. If you enjoy it for what it is at its base then just pick up the extra content as it goes on sale. Ive been playing for a couple months and while the community definitely has a large toxic population, at the end of the day its a lot of fun and most players just want to have fun. If you can get any friends to start playing with you that would help a ton.
---
Any videogame needs a grind for good stuff? And theres hardly a pay wall except for skins, with both the Shrine AND the shards you can get anything you want with enough time. You can play the game with what you got and still have fun, there are tons of people doing that right now. If youre expecting to jump in and start winning, youll have a bad time with any videogame lol.
---
I think its worth getting into. The only things stuck behind a paywall is certain cosmetics and licensing stuff like myers, freddy etc. Everything else is available in the game and most if the good perks are available in the base game so you dont miss out on anything.
---
I'll have to disagree with you there, partner.
---
Lmao, also why am I getting downvoted üòÇ
---
The DLC are all on sale right now. At least on PS4. There‚Äôs a Halloween sale.
---
I got the dlcs I wanted when they were on 60% sales, u don‚Äôt really need all the best perks to be good as u can only use 4 perks at a time and there r so many good perks
---
why would i listen to what a plague main has to say, we all know you're feeding us misinformation about when to cleanse and when not to cleanse so we die
---
I never twerk.  Ever.
---
Yep! It does stack with exhaustion perks.
---
Christ, imagine being that fragile. You‚Äôre spiting yourself out of progress to stop other people getting 5k points. You do realise they get all the points they‚Äôve accumulated up to that point, the only thing they‚Äôll miss out on is 5k escape points? Like, I‚Äôm trying to help you when I say this, don‚Äôt do that.
---
I honestly think I'd hobestly rather read another delayed Halloween event salt post rather than the billionth post about NOED.  This subject has been done to death and the responses never change.
---
Those killers that lobby dodge are also the type of killers that complain when the survivors DC against iri head or prayer beads spirit.
---
I really like it, though my personal opinion would be to have Benedict as more of a central character, it'd be really interesting from a lore standpoint and it also makes sense in terms of the screenplay for him to be the antagonist, as you could show his journey to the point of finally knowing exactly what happened. But I love the idea of him discussing the killers back stories whilst they're shown cinematically
---
Not sure bout fov :/ ... but m and a can be usefull on every killer depending on your build. Also great for spirit to get gengrabs. She also has a smaller terrorradius. The only killer i dont see m and a is rly usefull is the doctor himself. He kinda needs a big terrorradius to get use out of his power.
---
fits it
---
oh. idk. comment wasn‚Äôt related to the meme? but it‚Äôs a shitpost so that shouldn‚Äôt be a big thing lol. i tossed u an upvote. reddit is finicky
---
You don't need any of that stuff to actually play the game and have fun. and you really gain shards pretty quickly if you just ignore them and play like normal. if you don't wanna do that because it isn't enjoyable for you, then by all means put it aside. it's just a game and if it doesn't give you what you want, then it's totally fine to not play. you're only beholden to yourself here
---
download some internet smh
---
They're both overdone. I just want outside opinions and not free karma for bashing devs and/or a perk both Killers and Survivors hate.
---
i honestly think noed is pretty balanced but often annoying to play against.
---
oftentimes you can just cleanse the totem or be stealthy when picking up teammates/going for the unhook. it‚Äôs basically the killer version of adrenaline.
---
there are plenty of perks that counter it too, off the top of my head.. deliverance, dead hard, decisive strike, unbreakable, bond (if you want a teammate to pick you up.) 
---
i don‚Äôt go against noed a lot so maybe i‚Äôm uneducated.
---
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what to expect.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt deliver on what we initially promised‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWe will make no changes to the event. It will remain the same. No extensions. No acknowledgment that we shit the bed‚Äù
---
‚ÄúFuck you if you don‚Äôt like it‚Äù
---
Thank you for at least spelling it right üôå
---
Nice, now I can end chase the moment I get hit.
---
I literally posted about this exact issue last night. Nice to see some people also want things to change
---
have you tried getting internet?
---
Yep.. and people say the spirit hate "isn't recent" when she wasn't changed for over a year and nobody even mentioned her as the best killers in the game until few months ago.
---
I guess some people have a some memory issues
---
That's fine.
---
I think noed is fine. Some killers need it and some players abuse it. It's annoying when I'm playing survivor and I see a spirit who clearly doesn't need it running it with ruin but then I see instances where I see trappers with it and I think this is fair enough. 
---
In my honest opinion noed needs to be locked to certain killers as it's not 100% balanced if a spirit/nurse uses it compared to when a doc/trapper does.
---
Just from a Killer point of view, the only reason I don‚Äôt run Noed is because i‚Äôve learnt how to play optimally as the Killers I play with. A fourth perk that synergises well with the particular Killer i‚Äôm using that will be effective or useable from the start of the game or for a large majority of the game is of more benefit to me than being able to one hit down Survivors at the end, if it gets to that point. It‚Äôs rare they get all the gens done and even in those instances there‚Äôs only 2 or occasionally 3 left, all on death hook anyway.
---
monitor is great on her. i never play hag without it
---
sorry sir we‚Äôre all out of üÖ±Ô∏è*internet*
---
Why was this so beautiful
---
&gt; Video games are difficult to develop and keep in working order
---
I understand where you're coming from, but the fact that BHVR has constantly had delayed, and bugged on release, updates really takes its toll on the community. It's hard to give them a slap on the wrist when this has been happening all year. It's been 3 years, and people DC'ing still hasn't been addressed, ranks mean nothing, we can finally stay with our party after a game has concluded, and hitboxes on hatchets are still ridiculous. 
---
See the issue? Things have been around for years, but it seems that there's a constant supply of skins for people to buy almost weekly.
---
I knew it white ghosts are raisist
---
lol, thanks.
---
Also, Detective Tapp's perk (Detective's Hunch iirc) highlights totems and will be getting the same buff that Dark Sense got to where it activates whenever any generator is completed. Definitely going to try running it some after 3.3 releases and seeing if its viable.
---
A herd of Steves is called "a PTA meeting"
---
hey thanks :D
---
Its from a BTS RUN episode
---
Feel free to question why they don‚Äôt have back-ups, though.
---
Then you gotta commit. That's life baby ü§†
---
This isn't an issue with 99ing gates, it's an issue with teammates not following through. if the killer is close enough to down you after the split second it takes to open the gates they would have gotten you anyway unless your teammates bodyblocked and from what you said they wouldn't have
---
I usually run make your choice, bbq, ruin and Nurses. Then I‚Äôll literally just lay traps everywhere! Survivors generally will run somewhere and only stop to crouch like 10-20 metres before it
---
Yeah. You eat pickles with that mouth?
---
OOOOOH THAT‚ÄôS SPICY
---
Self care idiots. 
---
Why no Plunderers Instinct? You‚Äôll get a red flashlight with a purple key as an add on.
---
this is fucking great
---
Yup. Usually when a company makes a mistake, the consumer is compensated. Instead, we get nothing. Clearly the company isn‚Äôt concerned about making it up to us.
---
Noed is balanced and should be a feature
---
BT works on the same survivor twice (which is obviously the maximum a single person can be unhooked).
---
&gt;Feels like the kliller shouldn't
---
Mind explaining that?
---
Also it already works with distortion or blindness status, why would undetectable be different?
---
I have a new rule with myself now that whenever I see a gamertag I recognise I switch to spirit. I only remember people's names who are good or toxic so I'd rather not take the risk. I've lost far too many games because I've seen someone I recognise and decided to play my favourite killer against them instead of spirit. NO MORE. Winning is more fun than being destroyed.
---
I don‚Äôt care about NOED, but when I cleansed 2 or 3 totems and my 3 other mates didn‚Äôt bother doing the last ones? They better not flame the killer in the end chat.
---
What do you mean ? He has them .. ? xD I agree he's pretty simple, but he doesn't have much to work around :)
---
Or fix your shitty wifi internet
---
It's pretty odd. I just got back to playing and I'm in purples right now. Every game I either get dumpstered by a SWF or I end up against uncoordinated level 13s and sweep them with 5 or 4 gens left. There's like 0 inbetween.
---
If only BHVR put this much effort and planning into their own patches as this fellow did with this amazing Christmas DbD poem
---
Hex: Editing
---
Eachtime someone posts a quality editing on r/deadbydaylight, gain a stack for a maximum of 8 stacks. Each stack reduces action speed of survivors by 1%.
---
Actually it‚Äôs been bad literally forever. PS4 players specifically have been begging for optimization improvements for over 2 years now. Strange Things did indeed make it much worse but every update or patch worsened it as well.
---
Every single post in this sub has turned into just complaining about the Halloween event getting postponed. Please for the love of god just stop posting the same shit it‚Äôs getting annoying
---
Glad to hear it ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Yep üòÇ
---
Would paint like french girl
---
Im ignoring it because its stupid af. You cant "juke" a killer within lunge distance if you're not near a pallet or a window. Any killer thats not a baby won't fall for a 360
---
We all had trouble with skill checks at some point, just find a gen to work on solo and practice listening for them and clicking at the right time. You‚Äôll get it eventually!
---
it's just a time and practice thing. eventually it won't bother you anymore.
---
play feng min and use her technician perk until you have it down
---
I still use 2 of the perks on the right lol.
---
Yea.
---
The best thing to do is practice keeping your cool. Try lowering your volume, and keep your focus
---
The hatch shouldn‚Äôt even spawn into the match until there‚Äôs only 1 survivor left TBH. Multiple survivors shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to escape through the hatch
---
I get the fact that BHVR seems like they'd rather license new killers for more money than actually fix the game (i.e. Huntress's hatchets and the numerous other things you've stated). But it just seems a little unfair to me that the community as a whole is bashing on them. I've only been playing DBD since...before Ash came out, so whenever that is, so I probably have zero reason to even be in this subreddit. Yeah, they need to fix their game. So does Ubisoft and [insert generic EA joke here]. But it gets real old after the 100th "Devs bad delayed event bad instaheals good" post. I dunno, maybe I'm mentally handicapped or something. It just doesn't make me feel good when I see all that negativity.
---
Even if you don‚Äôt hit a single skillcheck you‚Äôll still be making gen progress faster than tapping if you just tough it out. Getting slammed with 10 skillchecks sucks but that‚Äôs rng and for every time that happens you‚Äôll have a gen that doesn‚Äôt give a skillcheck for its whole duration.
---
I‚Äôm actually having plenty fun in that fantasy land, dunno if you could consider it a fantasy land if it‚Äôs a reality tho
---
In dead by daylight‚Äôs current state, this is literally just a git gud situation. There‚Äôs nothing I can say that will convince you swf isn‚Äôt OP in your current state of mind
---
So many times as a killer it starts the grab animation, then I look and they're running away. Hilarious when I play survivor, so annoying when killer.
---
Yeah. I just wished they were more understanding and not harass me for actually doing the objective.
---
If you report more than 5 people a week or dc more than once a day this should appear on your screen
---
I‚Äôm planning on doing Michael next, and I‚Äôll definitely do more characters after that.
---
Lol you feel like you are owed? Such entitlement...
---
Lol right? Man, that Claudette in No0b3's video was so triggering.
---
Okay I‚Äôll check you out then!
---
Edit: I can‚Äôt find them. Are you able to link it?
---
I laughed so hard I think I pulled a rib muscle.
---
Good luck to you, then. Hopefully it'll be a more viable perk, since most (if not all) of Tapp's perks are alright at best.
---
I don‚Äôt think a single mature person believes they do this on purpose. What I believe is they are lazy. They have so many opportunities to actually find out what the community wants by talking to content creators as their opinions reflect the majority of the communities and they choose not to. The devs are making a conscious choice not to discuss with the community to find out exactly what we want, that‚Äôs the problem I have with the devs most of all. Oh and their responses, their publicity on issues, is poor. I‚Äôm understanding that they post stuff on their social about ‚Äúlegion add ons broken, don‚Äôt use, or get banned‚Äù, but make that an update within the game to make people aware. Or better yet! Fucking disable them. That was a greedy move by the devs. More people get banned means more revenue in the majority of circumstances. They have fucked up time and time again. They rarely do anything right, and if they happen to do so it‚Äôs taken too long for me to have any respect left for them. The devs are childish and greedy, they consistently focus their resources in the wrong stuff and have zero respect for their community to even publicly talk shit about people they don‚Äôt like. No company is allowed to do that in the way that they have. Is that better than just ‚Äúdevs bad hurdurhur‚Äù, providing reasoning behind why some of us say it?
---
I‚Äôm all for discussing these topics and agree that there is a lot of circle jerking about a lot of things in the dbd community as a whole so I understand.
---
People do play but PS4 has the worse of the DBD community. Personally as a PS4 player, I‚Äôd say get the Pc version if you can. If you can‚Äôt then now is the best time on PS4 because of the Halloween sale.
---
Demogorgon and Ghostface are my favourite with these :)
---
Oh I mean like the original characters people come up with and post here. Not like Shattered Bloodline or anything like that.
---
No they have version management for stuff like that, the problem they mentioned in their update on the issue was because that because the update was so large, they had a lot of game breaking bugs and decided to postpone it.
---
With killer I try not to be a lazy camper, and instead want them to have a fair chance...makes it fun
---
With Survivor I try not to leave anyone behind
---
Times 4 survivors...
---
I've got stats for Beldam, no add-ons yet
---
You pretty much just have to keep playing and practicing to git gud at skill checks. I‚Äôm fairly gud, but still working on hitting the great ones myself.
---
Well my best advice I can think of is practice, but you seem to be doing that with the simulator. If you have a buddy that plays killer, play a game of KYF (Kill your Friends) where you can practice those skill checks while in the heat of a match. 
---
Good luck! I hope my advice helped!
---
As a Doc main, I strongly recommend the Shroud of binding.
---

so... after a bad match you deliberately sabotage your own innocent team just for the sake of "integrity"?
---
Haha if not wanting to have my time wasted is fragile then sure. I'm not worried about the BP I have most of the perks I want and can easily get plenty in the next game.
---
Well what happened was I was unharmed when I got to the door, but I got the first hit just as I was about to open the door and still had to actually open it after the first hit and then I got downed about halfway through the exit. So it indeed was, without a doubt, the survivors fault who left the door to 99%.
---
Its pop is really low, get your friends together and play some scav! Or if you want depression try Hunter
---
 It's muscle memory. Relax, have fun, let the game scare you and don't sweat mistakes. After you play more, over time, all of the different pieces of the puzzle will come together, and you'll get to play off your instincts
---
Purposely getting ds'd so you can start downing and hooking your old obsession without losing save the best for last stacks
---
I feel like I missed that meme I see people saying Ok boomer to other people a lot.
---
Its still pretty shit. You have to pair it up with people who will sabotage a couple of hooks
---
You're the minority. Most "survivor mains" on this subreddit want killers to stand in the basement and let them do the gens, and then wave goodbye as they butt dance out of the exit gates.
---
I have never read anything more beautiful. Bravo, encore!

A Graveyard.

Its not bhvr's fault your router is acting up

But not LF since he hits multiple times, right? Unless he only hits you on the tail end of his swinging?
---
Someone's hyped for Animal Crossing: New Horizons
---
the time saved can then be utilized by both of you, though
---
I'm not going to say it's the best, but I never liked the whole idea of the hatch in the first place. 
---
 The hatch in itself leads to some really selfish behaviour that I don't think is right for the game either.
---
 The hatch is like rancor, its something free you didn't earn at all.
---
Well since they made the announcements about the stupid twitch rivals event on Halloween, one can assume the Q+A will be mostly about that. I so hope they have massive problems while people are playing live during the event to show how piss poorly this game and their dedicated servers are going and also to show that there is no Halloween event going on...
---
I heard somebody was shittin‚Äô there, watch out.
---
What I was saying about the grind was that it‚Äôs just to much , right now I‚Äôm only getting like 200 shards a level but you need 9000 to buy a killer . That just seems like it‚Äôs to much leveling for one killer unless there is a huge spike in how much you get per level
---
That‚Äôd be way too strong
---
But it's not
---
Shirtless David? That'd make all the other things invalid for me.
---
I always let the killer sacrifice me after they let me get a couple of gens, a ty for not depipping me. The good survivors who never dc shouldn‚Äôt be penalized. That way everybody gets some pts and no one suffers for the shitheads.
---
Why is it so strange to me to imagine someone who loves both of these games equally, despite being that person myself. Something about the phrase "ay before our next DBD game lemme check up on my animal crossing world real quick" just strikes me as fundamentally wrong
---
My wifi is pretty good. I don't have this problem with any other game
---
e = skill
---
That's so stupid; what did he expect to happen going for a save, in the basement of all places, while the gates are opened?

Good wifi that doesn't effect any other game

Dammit I love this lol
---
I BECOME SNIPER HUNTRESS, DESTROYER OF PLEBS!
---
Can someone please tell me what‚Äôs the fucking point of a charm??? I remember that stupid shit in rainbow before I quit playing do to all the team killing...
---
I usually let the best person at dodging live longest and get hatch when I play Huntress. They give me more practice and they get more bp. Win/Win. Sometimes they think I'm slugging to be a dick but it's because I want more practice against good players. =(
---
"Hey guys, can I play too?"
---
i never said Insta meds where not, trust me insta meds are one of the worst things in the game. 
---
But at least DS is much easier to counter.
---
I feel this. I run off meta perks all of the time and get shit for it. I don't see them complaining when  I Autodidact their asses back to healthy in five seconds, or the fact that we never deal with NOED thanks to small game.
---
Just like any killer that's not a baby wont fall for a locker juke you mean? Lol 
---
My point stands. Neither is very likely to work, but a locker juke is useless even if it does "work" where a regular juke (although equally unlikely to "work") actually provides some benefit of it "works"
---
 I don't think the amount of "FU DEVS FIX GEM NAO" is justified, I personally think those posts need to be removed. But I do think that devs need to be held accountable. We're putting our free time into this game and, for others, our own money. We want to feel as though the other end is being fair to our investment, and lately it hasn't been. I don't know what the future holds, but I hope that they set the community back on track with the new update and we can stop seeing the same "FU DEVS" posts...that's a long shot, though lol
---
4 against the infinite amount for killers
---
Not sure if it's ok to ask this here but is there no after-match chat channel on the Nintendo Switch version? I do see the option to report people for being rude during it but not the actual chat channel. Haven't seen it discussed anywhere so I thought I could ask here. Thanks.
---
You dont even need to be a good team if you or one of your friends bring OoO.
---
I mean cleansing totems isn't all that hard, but I can see what you're saying.
---
They would have been out last week probably if the event didn‚Äôt get delayed, and if they released them now it wouldn‚Äôt be a smart move and makes them look greedy in many peoples eyes...

They're fun things to collect. Another tassle on the handlebars of playing the game. Like collecting foil or alternate art magic cards over normal printings. You don't need them, but its a fun option for people who like them.

‚ÄúHealing yourself while nobody is around to heal you is not wasting time. Investing 32 seconds, assuming nobody is around to help, to potentially loop the Killer for another 1 or 2 minutes is a net gain in time. No matter what the situation is, Self-Care is going to help you or whoever might come by to heal you.‚Äù
---
You are literally just proving one of my previous comments where I said ‚ÄúSelf care is only good if you‚Äôre able to loop the killer for more than 32 seconds on full health.‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúSelf-Care, in the right hands, is an extremely helpful perk that can help the entire team by making it so there's one less person that needs the help of another survivor.‚Äù
---
Wasting 32 seconds isn‚Äôt ‚Äúextremely helpful‚Äù when you could be working on a generator and finishing it. You act as if everyone is constantly being chased at the same time and there is not time to do anything.
---
‚ÄúIn situations where nobody is around to heal you, it is much more important to heal yourself than hope someone comes around to help you. You're in more situations where you can heal yourself than you are in situations where you can have someone else heal you.‚Äù
---
This is simply wrong. If only you started working on generators after losing the killer you would be able to find other teammates more easily at other generators. Also,  OF COURSE you are going to be in more situations where ‚Äúyou can heal yourself‚Äù because all you have to do is sit still and press one button. How is that even an argument?
---
I hope you realize that 32 seconds is almost half of how long it takes to complete a generator, imagine how much work you would get done if instead of healing every time you got hit you worked on them. And before you say ‚Äúit is more beneficial to be healed‚Äù YES, I agree with this and I mentioned that on my previous post, but ONLY if you are able to loop the killer for longer than the amount it takes you to heal.
---
It makes me sad because I adore Deathgarden.
---
I highly recommend Hag. She's so fun, but this may be my bias as she is my favorite Killer.
---
a person can only get hooked two times before they're dead on hook. borrowed time will work on a hooked survivor regardless of who unhooked, if multiple survivors have borrowed time, but a survivor can still only be taken off the hook twice.

I dont think they're lazy per se, I simply believe they're inexperienced. The games always been a mess of spaghetti code and I think that this is their first time doing an online game (some of them worked for naughty bear before dbd iirc) moving from P2P to dedicated servers has to be a mess with how the game is made. And with how many bugs there are theres no way these guys are amazing at what they do. Their PR department however needs insane improvement.  They have one job and they do it poorly, at least with programmers it's a lot easier to fuck up making a game, but with the community managers and such it seems like they dont even do anything other than set up the occasional survey and the dev streams.
---
It's a bit unrealistic to call all the devs lazy as they're a big team and theres no way of knowing the ethics of every developer, but from what I can deduce, it just seems like they dont really know what they're doing.
---
Yeah, fat chance about the FU devs part. Maybe if we delete all the Killers, maybe that'll happen? I completely understand about spending money and time on a game only for things like this to happen. On one hand, BHVR needs money to keep their business running, but the other hand is the community, and they need to keep the community happy because...well, let's face it. Take a look around. (Side note: many thanks for keeping this civilized and not a flame war. I've seen many things go to hell when BHVR is mentioned.)
---
But what if you could "erase" a window or a pallet in the middle of the chase so it is either invisible or cannot be interacted with? And you can "draw" new ones, like dream and illusion pallets, prior to a chase? if you do it early enough, survivors may not know what is and is not real

So did you successfully sandbag him? We need answers.

I'll try her out, then! I'm a trash Legion/Doc main, so a new Killer is exactly what I need.

Now I want a small dbd minigame in this style :)

Just bad internet.

And then you'll play Huntress with Huntress Lullaby.
---
What do you guys mean when you are referencing the colors? Pretty new to the game so trying to figure a bunch of stuff out. I'm on a PS4 if that makes any difference.
---
&gt; Myers on the other hand is getting the Undetectable status added to Tier 1, but that is more of a nerf than anything because it means he is no longer immune to perks like Spine Chill and Premonition.
---
On the bright side he'll have no terror radius in EW1, meaning you can now run Mirror Myers without monitor and abuse, so you now have an extra perk slot that'd normally be taken up by M&amp;A.
---
I never dodge, but this kind of shit does make me rethink my perk loadout. That surprise lightborn or Franklin's always mines some salt at the end.

Sorry but blah... I guess I‚Äôm to old of a gamer to see the point in them... but if you guys like them I‚Äôm not gonna stand in the way...

If any survivor has seen you three times, you gain the ability to teleport to the locker closest to them when outside of a chase.

Tier 1 Myers cannot enter a chase unless he hits a survivor. I assume it will be like this for every stealth killer. Myers also has zero terror radius now, so monitor is useless in a scratched mirror build. Undetectable status gives the smokey effect on the sides like Insidius.
---
The dates for release were leaked a bit ago, they may not be accurate but they said the first sets (Michael and Laurie I think) were coming out like now. I think that was going off the assumption we would be busy getting the *other* new cosmetics from the harvest blight and archives though. Honestly I just want the new ghostface set and the pigs new knife and mask and Julie‚Äôs mask so I wasn‚Äôt anticipating anything good dropping until November (nov 20th is pig &amp; tapp day I believe)

"When killers see that I bring an item which allows for an easy escape and possible aura reading, they try to eliminate me because I am a huge threat. I do not like this."
---
I had someone discredit me in an argument, simply because I run Botany Knowledge. 
---
That perk is SO helpful at lvl 3 since it speeds all healing. It's not stupid!  *\*sniffles\**
---
Kinda, but it's more of a game with a community that knows each other and the game thrives based on players that continue to play it but because of that you have insane hunters that are demolish new scavengers because there's no ranking system which is probably the major turn off but is impossible because the low population size of the game, I recommend both sides with 150h.
---
But for some reason whenever I play the q times are always faster than dead by daylight
---
[Here is your reason...](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/98653/)
---
;o; thank u guys for all the advice! i've heard horror stories about dbd sometimes, so i kinda got really scared about not being automatically good...
---
but yeah! what u guys are saying makes sense, so i'l keep practicing!
---
Fuck I like this lol
---
What? I was making fun of you saying that you should dc when tunneled...
---
yes why would i say that if i didn't mean it
---
When I first started playing there was soo much bitching.  Feels like people have chilled out a lot
---
Victorian mansion that's mostly an inside map like Lerys. I want to hide behind gaudy furniture, in closets, and in the basement.
---
A space station or other scifi-ish map. The Stranger Things map is definitely sciency but I want a Aliens/Predators scifi feel with creatures in tubes.
---
And lastly an after-the-apocalypse mall or grocery store that's eerily disheveled(raided lo0king) and huge.
---
A group of Steve is call a pamper.
---
corporate shill
---
It is a tight window. Keep practicing, you will get them consistently eventually.
---
Thats what u get for being a noob and using ruin
---
I don't remember, it was months ago. Before Legion, i think?
---
She chazze
---
She attacc
---
But most importantly, she a kutie pie.
---
The original company that developed L4D is making a new game called Back 4 Blood. Valve only made the engine, so I am hopeful they will make a quality spiritual sequel.
---
eh you should have had enough time to get out from the attack cooldown. from the switch to the actual exit isn't long enough unless they had STBFL
---
It can hit multiple times, but usually the speed boost from the first hit which triggers borrowed time gets you out of range from getting hit again
---
Not really..
---
Nope no post game chat system present
---
Lul ok
---
Posts like these are getting to be just as obnoxious as the posts complaining about the delay.
---
Colors are taking about what rank you are. 20-17 grey, 16-13 yellow, 12-9 green, 8-5 purple, 4-1 red. The lower the number the better.
---
The shape kind of looks like Michael Myers from Halloween
---
Somewhere like Wonderland mixed with DBD aesthetic would be cool, have giant flowers and a random tea party set/table... Maybe even giant chess pieces or something
---
There isn‚Äôt one for the other consoles, so I would assume it‚Äôs the same for the switch
---
cleansing totems isnt hard if you are a full swf with a good map, even with a 4 man finding a single dull totem on a map like the underground complex can drag the game out way 2 long.
---
Yes, simple yet effective.
---
I didn‚Äôt really have anything else to run. I don‚Äôt have many perks
---
it's an odd timing, you need to fully blind the killer right as they regain control of their character, this also applies to pallet stun saves.  I tend to use the point that they are fully on their shoulder as the reference point in which to stun them.
---
Oh... I don't get it.
---
*laughs in red ranks*
---
We paid for the game (and some of us were even dumb enough to pay for more than that!), shitlord, so fuck off with your half-assed non-argument arguments. Or did you get the game, every killer, and every survivor for free? 
---
Maybe - MAYBE - BHVR should've been 100% sure things were golden before they sauntered out on a live stream with a trailer and went "Here's what's coming!" only to turn around and step on a fucking rake.
---
Okay. Even given that, what does it matter? Nothing would have stopped him from going down and throwing the pallet was stupid.
---
Well I ran straight as I could and I didn't.
---
Literally my previous match lol
---
Play Feng and run Technician. If you fail a skillcheck it prevents it blowing up 50% of the time.
---
But it‚Äôs very close to a generator. You‚Äôd have to be blind not to see it while working on the gen. That‚Äôs like getting stabbed and someone saying, ‚Äúhey, at least you weren‚Äôt shot.‚Äù
---
you fucked up somehow then
---
Honestly I think all of that‚Äôs really good but for some of how you rank the killers, I feel like nurse is still the best even after her changes due to the changes leaving her base kit relatively unaffected, and hag is better than Myers; she‚Äôs not as map dependent as you might think whereas Michael can get screwed over by coldwind maps and other maps with an abundance of safe/loopable pallets. Plus, Michael can be pretty dependent on stalk rate addons, although I will concede hag is similarly but to a lesser extent dependent upon TP range addons as well.
---
Only the PC version of the game has a post-game chat.  Every other iteration must use the built in messaging system of the console.
---
Glad to see someone else appreciates them!
---
Also, this is super adorable.
---
Nice bro
---
You should make another that just says ‚ÄúUnforeseen Circumstances‚Äù
---
Good luck on the carving.
---
Yeah no. It's not said enough.
---
??? First line was him saying he has no idea... Is this click bait?? Im truly asking
---
it‚Äôs about learning timing, you will eventually adapt to it. your brain will start to recognize that the skill check noise grants you X amount of time to respond. 
---
it simply takes some time, but until then, you can get add ons that make skill checks easier (i think,) and can use the technician perk that feng min has.
---
Yeah, her art is awesome :)
---
They need to just give us Carl goddamnit

I can see his ego being off putting, which many people tend to have when being very skillful at something, but the man is very skilled at the game because he focuses on being as optimal as he can be by utilizing everything that the game has to offer, which showcases the balance of the game. However, as I mentioned before, he is open to having his mind change on a subject if you can come up with a good counter argument because he'd rather acquire knowledge even if it means he's wrong on the subject. He has stated this multiple times in his videos and I have yet seen him contradict himself.
---
As a killer, it's very difficult to rank up the higher you go because there's plenty of things as a killer that is out of your control. The fact that a player disconnecting can hurt your chances of ranking up is fucked up because you'd need to at least hook them multiple times before they disconnect in order to get full credit. The time the gens get done also plays a factor that can prevent a killer from ranking. Killer/map comp vs a good survivor team is paramount. A killer like Clown has a low chance of winning in a large map because he has no other way of adding map pressure other than his radius. This is why a lot of players run killers like nurse and spirit because they're good for large maps and optimal in everything else.
---
Why deathgarden meg? From my experience they tend to be quite bad.
---
*literally next to a gen, facing it openly*
---
"this is fairly well hidden"
---
unbelievable
---
No I meant like the formate
---
They probably did not mean that, and you probably will lose against them no matter what, and they may just want you to be a little bit better. But this here is a good example of why is it bad to give people advises when they didn‚Äôt ask for it.
---
nonce
---
No it really was the 99% that screwed everything up. And like I said, this has been my third time this month that a 99% door got me killed.
---
ruin is fine. ignore that idiot
---
Poof
---
You just have to watch the entire thing to find out.
---
I mean either the game is too long, or too short with gens being completed stupid fast sometimes.
---
It matter because if you observe he throws the pallet and the pallets instantly breaks BEFORE he gets downed, if spirit fury hadnt gone crazy he would've been safe since bubba would had gotten stunned. Sure there are times when bubba hits the survivor before throwing the pallet down but in those instances the survivor gets downed before the delay throws the pallet
---
Pass
---
the list I mentioned was not in order if that confused you.
---
Don‚Äôt blame you.
---
getting hit across a pallet is consistent tho. It's a clear timing on killer's part that works 100% of the time when done correctly. Many killers will refuse to hit you when they are close to you to get you to drop the pallet when going down, just to get rid of it (and sometimes make you feel bad)
---
And after ooo nerf ? Still sprint burst
---
&gt;I've said no cussing
---
&gt;All this bitching and moaning
---
allllllllright.
---
Maybe keys should only allow 1 person to escape
---
Ah okay lol
---
something happened to host's internet that caused a large desync before a crash
---
The survivor being revealed is a pretty big downside, especially against really mobile killers (who are the top of the meta right now).
---
if we don't get it on Wednesday we'll get on Thursday if we don't get on Thursday we'll get it next month blah blah blah.
---
I think that headshots wouldn't work in the game just yet. They still need to fix Latency and Hitboxes before they could ever make that change. When I play Huntress, I can't even throw the hatchets over a box that I'm literally touching and clearly aiming above because the hatchet hitbox is so janky.
---
I think a temporary solution could just be that the Iridescent hatches can only one shot you from a long range. It rewards the Huntress player for making a long range shot and guessing where the survivor will juke. Survivors would have plenty of time to dodge, or they could be risky and run back into the Huntress out of the range thing so even if they hatchet does hit, it doesn't one shot them. Unfortunately, just like a lot of DBD, this will only be a band aid fix though. They need to release a large update addressing the main problems of the game.
---
Occasionally I‚Äôll let the pple go and farm with them but after this happening pretty much every 3rd match I need points aswell or I‚Äôll depip and looking 4-6 times if that isn‚Äôt really enough sometimes
---
Why do people hate self-care? ,  ya it's slow but better than being injured
---
I don't know why people are downvoting, I'm with you on plague being the most irritating killer. Matches are absolutely no fun against her. The one thing you can do to negate her vile purge is to not cleanse, but like you said you become a no mither with detriments. Plus there's always the one idiot who constantly cleanses.
---
Yeah, all the bitching and moaning about you fucks.
---
I'll remember that when I'll play survivor again. Sometimes it is really hard to not react to the provocations of some survivors, but even a little friendly post game comment can make up for a lot. You made a great comment here
---
I don't mind watching videos but I really want to know what's going on I don't want to watch someone's channel that's just guessing
---
Nope. Killers want to have run, not have 3 gens popped by the time you hook 1 guy and either they all escape through the exit gate or they jump through the hatch if you dare to make a comeback.
---
you have no idea how this game works and you're really stretching in your description of events here
---
it only looks that way because the animation for the pallet toss has to end first. this is like the most normal hit i have ever seen
---
Your tier list change?
---
EDIT: my stupid ass didnt realize my freind plastered it on a d o o r and not a wall so uh yeah. school door not school wall :)
---
&gt;But it‚Äôs very close to a generator. You‚Äôd have to be blind not to see it while working on the gen. That‚Äôs like getting stabbed and someone saying, ‚Äúhey, at least you weren‚Äôt shot.‚Äù
---
Here is the thing, because of the spawning pattern of props, in 90% of the maps your totem will inevitably be close to something. If its not a generator it will be close to a hook. If not a hook or generator it will be near a pallet that survivors will use. If devs actively force the spawn to avoid all these props with little map remaining after all gens, hooks and pallets have been generated, survivors will just look for areas that don't have any of these.
---
Totem spawns will never be fixed and yours was pretty good considering the alternatives to totem spawns on Coldwind maps.
---
Asylum maps also have totems like this but they have a little more clutter in front of it.
---
no, you are fucking up. it is a literal fact that there is enough time there to escape
---
I laughed harder than I probably should, but damn. This is so true.
---
Yeah, I hear they're giving him the status effect, but aside from M&amp;A no longer being a must-have for Jumpscare Myers (which I hadn't even considered, good thinking), it really doesn't change much for him specifically, as he's already immune to Aura perks at T1, which was my main point.  
---
Myers is (mostly) unchanged by this change.
---
But if 3 pple que in the special swf lobby they‚Äôll have to grab a random out of the normal lobby and it‚Äôll just be messy for that 1 guy
---
Lol why didn‚Äôt the new run straight for the pallet.
---
The shroud offerings are worse. The killer and survivor shrouds should be switched
---
The moment I saw the title of this post I imagined a lot of people mentioning op perks already in the game.
---
Good Ol' Flower then Suicide...
---
Yeah no, not unless there is actual punishment for dying with a full vial
---
I was expecting to lose some karma on that comment. There's a lot of Vommy Mommy mains who are very protective. I'm just saying, look at it from the survivors point of view. I ran a Plague on Back Water Swamp and lost her in the grass &amp; she literally just spun in circles while vomiting &amp; **hit me**. What skill does that take?
---
Lol I just read that full argument. So what if a survivor tbags at the gate. Its hard to even get to the gates. The guy you argued with is defo just some high testosterone knuckle head who got plebbed on by a nea XD
---
Hey how do you keep track of downed survivors? 
---
Once I hooked someone and when he got rescued I downed him again near the hook and then chased his rescuer. When I got back (after about 15 seconds) the downed guy was gone and the scoreboard thing said he was still downed. I searched the whole area near the hook and I couldnt find him anywhere.
---
That's great.
---
i think legion is easiest to play against, he‚Äôs really fast though.
---
ghostface is sometimes so stealthy you don‚Äôt have time to snap him out/it doesn‚Äôt work..

 If it was normal for you good then, you aint conving anyone either way.

germany said in theory we can still win in the 40‚Äôs

It's weird. They are having bugs everywhere.
---
I love it to see them suffer, when you git gud after a while.
---
Sometimes you win, sometimes you loose, but such stuff satisfy me. :)
---
it's refering to the ranking system.  Each color represents a certain range of ranks.  For example, red ranks refers to the highest range of ranks, 1-4 if I remember. It goes, from highest rank to lowest, Red-&gt;Purple-&gt;Green-&gt;Yellow-&gt;Gray.
---
It‚Äôs when it‚Äôs next to a generator. The main thing survivors go near. The thing that survivors are required to complete in order to survive (besides the hatch). Survivors have little reason to go near hooks (which can be avoided), may not go near chests, and when survivors use a most likely pallet it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre in a chase, which will make it less likely that they notice the totem. I don‚Äôt really care what it‚Äôs beside as long as it‚Äôs not practically touching a generator.
---
I played Dwight the first game I ever played and then basically played him until P3 but had to use a few people to get perks I needed for him lmao
---
you say that but then you look at her face in game and she looks like she wants to stab you with a really sharp ruler 26 times
---
I do understand though. Whenever I play survivor I frequently encounter it, so I get it
---
I don't get it. All I see is a bunch of colored squares.

Veteran's Keepsake. It's a perk exclusively usable by Bill.
---
After being unhooked once, the next time you are unhooked you receive an M1 Grand Standard Issue American rifle. You can use it to kill the Killer, kicking them out of the game. Doing this however triggers the Endgame Collapse.
---
They probably tanked their ranks to get some footage of themselves "pwning" killers with their mad skills.
---
It‚Äôs a new perk where after multiple missed swings the entity gets a free hit on you.
---
I believe spine chill doesn‚Äôt increase vault speeds anymore.  But I‚Äôve been using resilience since dedicated servers seem a lil wonky at times

Because it's  slow like you said, a med kit is vastly superior. There's also the new Nancy perk that heals you in lockers

Survive with friends

I'm constantly taking down whole teams as ghostface though???? And Leatherface paired with insidious is S P I C Y af
---
For example: gray medkit + gray medkit = yellow medkit?
---
I don't see the difference between a killer dodging a lobby because they dont want to deal with keys, toolboxes or swf and survivors dc against iri head and ebony moris. Both are avoiding playing against players that are going to make the match unfun or end it too fast for them. You say that killers don't want a match where 5 gens are done in 4 minutes because of SWF and toolboxes, but as soon as survivors dc against ebony mori, iri head and prayer beads, everyone says that survivors cant be entitled to what the killer does and they need to commit once in the game. Huge double standard.
---
I agree when you‚Äôre new it can be tough or annoying to go against meta shit. But personally I don‚Äôt think playing a killer you haven‚Äôt played before is an excuse to tunnel/camp. Honestly there‚Äôs a lot of things you can learn that work and help you improve on all killers. (Red glow mindgames, moonwalking, etc) doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre trapper or Freddy. Obviously some are stronger than the others but it‚Äôs not really a fair argument to tunnel and camp because you‚Äôre playing billy or pig for the first time. Also you never improve with the killer by playing that way, and wasn‚Äôt that the whole point of playing another killer?
---
Don‚Äôt forget about.              
---
Quinten rework
---
Would be nice to shoot the spirit and end the game
---
Unfortunately, you don't get to revoke someone's rights to royalties just because they're an absolute garbage human. There probably are some contracts that enact that, but they'd likely be deemed unenforceable for a few different reasons and it wouldn't matter anyway.
---
I don't blame them either. I have about 10 syringes and double that of syptic agents on nearly all of my survivors. They are getting nerfed pretty hard so I am trying to use the item I bought with my bloodpoints before I have little to no reason to run them anymore.
---
Any sort of counterplay to her becomes a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. Especially if she's running add-ons. And yeah purge ultimately takes very little skill to utilize effectively. Vile purge also gets on literally everything; pallets, windows, totems, gens, gates, you name it. Which makes it all the more infuriating to play against.
---
Yep always back out of a lobby when I see a Nea or Feng Min with those masks, they are always the worst
---
After the first gen grab: "All four survivors just disconnected in unison, the planet might be having internet connectivity issues."
---
I was only joking about the fact that Ghostface and Leatherface have no Survivors in their DLC ;) That's all ahah
---
Didn't wanted to start a debate on their tier. &lt;3
---
I'm pretty sure that's what the patch notes claimed the game did prior to them changing it to the highest ranking survivor.
---
Ahaha it would be great !
---
Plus the Market Map... would be awesome, so many places to hide and details !
---
Not the Sadam that comes to mind
---
Yup, that would be new for once
---
Not bad. I prefer sloppy, nurses, thana. Then usually bbq for the points. I dont stalk much though just use the stealth part.
---
He thinks he‚Äôs a lot better at the game than he is.  He downplays and easily laughs off his own mistakes while exaggerating the mistakes of his teammates. 
---
Yes he calls his mistakes out but he‚Äôs much more forgiving to himself when he makes them and then still dispenses advice like he‚Äôs some infallible DBD god whose advice is incontrovertible.
---
He has no humility and his grammar is horrible.
---
Everyone will say that Myers is better, but Ghostface is the most stealthy of all stealth killers, which makes him really fun in my opinion.
---
Breaking down their powers, they both stalk to up the meters, but Myers levels up his own meter, and Ghostface makes each survivor have their own. Ghostface can be detected, which stops you from stalking until your stealth powers come back. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs lower tier.
---
Well one difference is that the nurse doesn't get invisible. Spirit leaves a sound while invisible. Wraith needs to slow himself down and ring a bell to turn visible.
---
Hag can only teleport to her traps when survivors trigger them by walking near them. Demogorgon can travel between traps whenever he wants (as long as his power gauge is full) but is limited to teleportation from one portal to another.
---
If anything is still unclear feel free to ask questions, I don't know how long you've been playing this game but I hope you stick along. It's nice to have new players :)
---
OK now I need to get spine chill and iron will out of the bw. Ty
---
I find it funny that you're right and that he being downvoted for nothing.. Relax mate ;)
---
This is a great idea!!
---
Oh shit. Just got The Spirit and Ash DLC. Been wanting those. Lol
---
Brandnewsentence?
---
I can still hear the voice
---
If they both aren't running perks or addons 100% Ghostface.
---
If they're both running their strongest addons and perks Myers all the way.
---
Lmao, legion is kinda poo if you think about it. Also michael does scare the crap out of you üòÇü•∫
---
Well I mean spirits ability is limited for one
---
I guess for me it‚Äôs more of a mind game with her
---
Nurse is for quicker teleportation and you can go through objects. 
---
Demogorgon isn‚Äôt triggered by survivors and there isn‚Äôt a distance limit I think so it‚Äôs more for map control , and had is for trapping them
---
As a survivor main, if I see another survivor hook farm more than once I'll go in and hook farm them right back
---
Ghost face is fun, so is myers, also freddy is good now.
---
Ghost face is fun because his stealth, sneaking and crouching etc.
---
Myers is fun because he has so many builds you can do with his addons like scratched mirror.
---
Freddys fun because pallets and gen teleport.
---
of all the things that bother me when playing survivor, Ruin is not among them
---
They should have a token counter or a map-wide dull totem cleansing sound. That would allow non-SWF players to know when all totems are completed. 
---
To me, that would be one level of balance. 
---
They could make counterplay by adding in a PWYF token element: gives you one token for each remaining survivor. Each token adds 1/1.5/2% speed (depending on tier). Lose one token for each offensive action. When all tokens are used, the survivors lose the exposed status. 
---
This would mean that if you juke a killer, they will not be able to down everyone. A good survivor team could exhaust a killer‚Äôs 4 tokens quickly.
---
I'm cool I just wanted to know, sorry
---
Deleted your thread like a coward lmao
---
I don't know who is the better grab machine, spirit or Myers. I get more grabs on Myers when I play him but I get grabbed by more spirits. Spirit and Freddy are the two I hate playing against. I will take a gf or pig match over a trapper tbh
---
garbage

I've touched daddy myers and leather daddies butts a few times.

Well I just realized it wasnt worth dealing with you cunts. You're so shit. No changing the minds of inbred sister fucking dipshits.
---
yep i saw that
---
But in the movies Jason has a LOT more powers than just putting down traps
---
Lets not even talk about freddy üí©
---
I'm keen
---
No problem ;) I wasn't being mean with my "xD"
---
It's cute you felt compelled to come find me though. Makes you look even more pathetic
---
lol
---
This is an rss OPERATION Health moment
---
I know this probably doesn't answer your question but I'd rather face a good Trapper than a good Hag.
---
The Hag's traps always jumpscare me and I believe the Trapper takes a bit more skill (and mindgames) to set up than the Hag.
---
He's also the OG killer, so there's that.
---
This question has been posted recently, so you should search it to get more replies. 
---
With that said, i would highly recommend both eventually. The key difference is that Myers actually uses/needs his stalk ability to down survivors and be viable. He also has some of the most powerful add ons in the game currently. He only has one stalk meter that is shared for all four survivor and degrades slowly after reaching each level.
---
Ghostface's main ability is the stealth, \*not\* the stalking. The ability to drop the 0 terror radius mid chase is huge and the stalking is just an afterthought due to how easy it can be to break GF out of stealth.
---
If you already have DS unlocked, go Ghostface since you don't need Laurie. Otherwise, pick up Myers so you can get that beautiful, wonderful survivor perk.
---
This have to be a lesson for you, dont talk about balance after two games
---
Yes. Mistakes happen. And then it‚Äôs a matter of whether or not the person or persons that made the mistake reconciles for their mistakes. But instead we‚Äôre getting ‚Äúdeal with it‚Äù and even further you‚Äôre telling me to ‚Äúdeal with dealing with it‚Äù. I‚Äôm voicing my opinion. You‚Äôve voiced yours. I‚Äôm not upset, are you?

Sorry haha I mean, make his googly eyes go in different directions. Like cocked eyed. üòÜ

I think what u meant to say was ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre gonna play billy that looks fun I don‚Äôt know how to help but I want to wish you good luck‚Äù

Hag*
---
Just cause he has a small weapon and is a smaller character makes his lunge look fucking cross map. Like clown, pig and sometimes hag, another killer I enjoy playing as

I love running botany knowledge its so useful.

pig is just straight up toxic

They're a small Indie company of merely 550 employees, they can't afford that kind of stuff.

Ah yeah I see\^\^ He would look so much dumb dumb xD

Just don't be the last one downed or else you'll definitely be camped.

Np pal

I hardly ever get 360‚Äôed anymore.

I love seeing people use no meta perks. Borrowed time is hard to let go though being the most useful altruism perk.

Na bro. Not with you. You're at least civil and I respect that. Sorry if you thought I was rude. This sub is aids though.
---
That second is one you may as well take. It‚Äôs technically 3 seconds; there‚Äôs one killer but 3 survivors to be potentially carrying out actions
---
If you‚Äôre waiting that long, unready and ready again. Good to refresh it sometimes.
---
That wouldn't help against Freddy though. Even if it did trigger, the Deep Wounds timer will still progress because being Oblivious means you aren't in the terror radius despite the fact that he's right behind you. BT is totally useless against Freddy.
---
For anyone who doesn't understand why this happens and hasn't played competitive FPSs, look up "peeker's advantage".
---
Basically Huntress is firing a projectile at you and her latency + your latency is how long that projectile has to hit you before you can react. The is exacerbated by her "peeking", because not only is there a latency buffer on the projectile, but that buffer applies to you even seeing her popup from behind cover which makes for a double whammy of needing inhuman reaction times.
---
Ive been doing that
---
Moral of the story, set a trap, pick it up, set a trap, pick it up, set a trap, pick it up (repeat) for the entire first minute of each match to ensure you at least get some blood points üòÇ
---
seriously why are they so good
---
Bro it's okay you need to project on me. Do you need a hug? You know where to find me you follower.
---
Honestly I‚Äôve always hated the Quieten and David ship. It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Quieten had Nancy in the films, but since removed from her, I doubt he would have changed sexualities. But fandoms will do whatever they please, even if it doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Good art tho.
---
If  you want to see, I remade some of them, doing a pack to install for people who wants them.

---
Ive always wanted to see addons have value based on rarity so we could say take 2 common and trade them for the next one up etc.
---
Another idea I had was an add on pool meaning doesn't matter what killer or survivor you buy the addon with you can use it on any character.
---
How would this work you may ask! Good question.
---
So on the bloodweb you would buy the rarity not the addon. So for addons you'd pay 3k and get a common then load up say myers and use it to choose one of his common addons. I feel this way we can stock up amd then not be punished for playing various survivors or killers. Would be a separate pool for killers and one for survivors.
---
I know personally killers I want to play get low on addons when I'm trying to get perks on another and with the amount of killers I like to play variety but feel almost punished for it.
---
Well yes, but actually yes. Lots of players rage or mock every match no matter what happened.
---
Spoken like a true e-tard
---
I feel like BBQ isn't needed unless youre just wanting the Bloodpoints. Discordance will already give you good info on finding survivors, and Pop will be your focus after hooking instead of going after survivors immediately.
---
The only reason botany is bad is because it doesnt stack with WMI and I run that every game.
---
Wraith can turn invisible like you said (however survivors can still see him because its almost like camo.) nurse dosent go invisible. She blinks almost like teleporting. And spirit is like wraith hovever she can only go invisible for a short ammount of time and survivors can hear her when she is phase walking (invis) however there are spirit addons to counter this.
---
Demogorgon can place portals (only 6. Not sure about addons i dont own demo.) and he can only teleport to another portal if hes on another one (so like ypu place a portal in the myers house and the only way to teleport to it is if you place another one and stand on it) Hag can teleport to her (clones?) if the trap is set off unlike demo you cant teleport to your traps if there still  activated however if you have an addon like rusty shackles survivors dont know if your (clone?) has been activated and you can teleport behind them and hit them without them knowing 
---
Pretty sure this guide is 99% right be sure to comment any corrections.
---
I mean the one hook thing sounds like a camper's victory. Any time I've played against heavy campers they only get the one hook. All the other players get to gen and dip.
---
Im just glad to know Im not the only one with this problem.  It's like this is what happens to all the bullied baby dwights. They evolve and destroy us
---
I made the pack &lt;3
---
If you want to look here, I've made a new post about it :)

What‚Äôs the problem with it?

Crying in the club rn

I couldn‚Äôt even set any traps
---
I tried playing a bit earlier in the evening and let the game run on my other monitor, eventually I managed to find a lobby. First game took really long for some reason but the ones after took a couple of minutes only.
---
Play at peak hours for your time zone. It also differs by rank too.
---
Yeah.. they are really not my favorite type of DLC.. I like when there is a map, a killer and a survivor, a bit of all :)
---
True, it is more of a minor inconvenience. It‚Äôs mainly the amount of matches I get with it that makes it somewhat annoying
---
LET ME PLAY SHIRTLESS DAVID FFS I'M A SEXY POTATO

I remember testing them on ptb

Ghost face has selfi mori.

They are not that good and when you down them, they'll DC. Pathetic, considering their toxicity beforehand.

at first i was kind of gutted with the delays... but now im a little relieved, because so many other games are doing halloween events - i can get those out of the way, then once hallowed blight II: Electric boogaloo is out, my plate should be cleared of other spooky-like activites
---
The killer is the host. Even if you normally have great internet, it may be having trouble making a lobby.
---
Try playing a few games as a survivor, see if that works.
---
The strongest/most optimal perk.
---
I.E. Balanced Landing is the most optimal exhaustion perk because not only does it give you that speed boost, but it has the passive benefit of reducing the stun from falling even if you don't get the speed boost. No other exhaustion perk has a passive benefit.
---
A true work of art, my goodness this is beautiful.
---
Yes I can play survivor but I bought the game to play killer
---
Got it
---
For some reason P3 Quentins are 27483 times better at looping you than most P3s
---
So exchange all the crap offerings I don't want for the single realm I want.
---
I see a lot of Haddonfield with Balanced Landing in the future.
---
You usually jump in as the killer is going for the swing that's gonna down you so yes, it definitely does buy more time, even if it only works once and a couple of extra seconds for every "bonus" miss you get after that.
---
Dcing is for babies unless you have like real life shit to do or are heavily lagging. Dcing cause you're losing is literally 4th grade shit. Just dont play then.
---
Seems like a good lengthy tip mate. Except for the Scare part because I don‚Äôt care for scaring others but mostly 2. Consoles. 
---
Unless you want to take an extra couple minutes typing did I scare you and have a full lengthy conversation with an overly friendly person.
---
I don't think it's horrible, but I feel there are better perks for healing, mainly We'll Make It and Inner Strength.
---
Yeah they were on ptb, and then they had them on the live servers, that's why their tweet says **live pc version** because that's the actual servers not the test servers. If it was ptb they would have said ptb
---
It's sad only one person realised it was a reference to the new parody
---
&gt; But most maps hurt the huntress.
---
maps that are bad for her are really bad for her
---
good god the amount of shit on shelter woods. getting an los is so hard
---
I do it too but I wish the pussies that dc wouldn't play the game if they dc all the time. I help repair gens all the time.
---
I loved the Carrie reference
---
That‚Äôs probably true, just from my experience dbd sucks at wording things.
---
Everyone starts as a baby killer, don't worry. You'll get the hang of it after a bit of practice
---
What platform?
---
Quentin mains, big brains
---
PC? I hear that this scenario of long wait for killer short for survivor is common. I‚Äôm on PS4 and it‚Äôs the reverse. When an event comes around, though, my PS4 wait is yours and maybe even worse as everyone who plays the damn game will be killer for those coveted bloodpoints. Speaking of possible events, looks like a tweet went out while I was making this post:
---
https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1189291721156448256?s=21
---
Change the first three to "Pig" and we're golden!
---
That‚Äôs a pretty bad argument because one could say a baby anything sucks.
---
Hes right though.
---
It‚Äôs not wrong, it‚Äôs just suboptimal. Just like trying to stealth with demo. You should not be rewarded when your strategy does not fit your character.
---
That‚Äôs not how it works at all currently. All survivors are +/- 6 ranks from the killer if they are solo. If they are SWF then the highest ranked survivor is used for the +/- 6
---
Last 24 hours or so of Nurse as we know.
---
F
---
The age of Spirits has come.

Oh, I thought that the Legion killed everyone at the same time thanks to his OPness ?

Baby rank 15. Id be down to play,what are you playing on?

Yeah. But literally everyone hating say Legion, Old Freddy, Wraith, Clown, Yadi Yada, they usually play a match or two, lose, and tell everyone that that killer is trash.

Everyone was literally hating on Freddy until the Freddy rework. But when it happens, we old Freddy mains HAVE to agree with what everyone else says or we get hated for it?
---
Yeah they can be wonky sometimes, but I know that I've 100% played during the live builds of the servers, and then played again later and it was different because they went back to the p2p

Everyone who was talking shit's got their tongue up their asses rn

Thanataphobia plagues are a blight on the game. Lol
---
HYPE!!
---
Thanatophobia is *the* plague perk, IMO. Survivors not cleansing = survivors constantly injured, incurring that slowdown effect. Once you have everyone, that's a nice 16% slowdown to all actions. Combine with Dying Light if you feel confident in your ability to get dem hooks.
---
DON'T RECITE THE SACRED TEXT

I WAS THERE WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN!!

wait did they say they're not releasing it on halloween? frick

FYI the switch release will be delayed apparently their tackling ‚Äúmajor issues‚Äù, damn still hope hospital Myers comes out on switch

---
Ah thank you
---
I know some people were talking about the supermarket map that Ghostface didn't get, and an office building one would be great also. Overall, the urban setting can be difficult, but possible if you limit it to a few locations
---
Organ Trail
---
ps4
---
Welcome to dedicated servers. Huntress hits through walls, around corners, and through the floor below. As if throwing couches wasn‚Äôt bad enough...
---
The killer version of this is getting hit by the wind of the corner of a pallet. Then you get stunned.
---
I don't run DS, DH or BL. Lol. I always run self-care, lithe &amp; BT. 4th perk I'll change out based on the type of games I get.
---
ok
---
Please don‚Äôt start already, good god
---
I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting them to fix the big issues and get the certifications for consoles this week. Thank you for you work, devs!
---
Lol why is she urban envisioning away wtf
---
Except switch there tackling ‚Äúmajor issues‚Äù
---
üé∂Nerfs! And Buffs! And so the balance shifts! We rendezvous with Spirits, and consolidate our gifts! We can end this match in Autohaven, cut them off at sea, but for this to succeed, there is someone else we need üé∂
---
But not on Switch.
---
Damn your right, gotta get my omega nurse games in tonight
---
Look it up
---
Thanks. I hadn‚Äôt seen that. I‚Äôll delete this so people just see one post about it.üëçüèº
---
Imagine bring that set up and still dcing. Some people are so bad and sad it hurts.
---
Add me @Ripfaith
---
lol nvm
---
yeah bhvr really needs to plan around your schedule next time
---
Hopefully based on the tweet, more people will start playing for all platforms as lobbies tend to fill up quick with a bloodpoint incentive like an event is in play. Besides the possible Halloween event, this update will bring in the new Rift and Archives dealio that will let you get more bloodpoints for doing certain things (kind of like daily rituals). If nothing changes, might want to just try tomorrow when more people will be on.
---
Big brain survivors.
---
Everyone hold onto your Pumpkins, we may be getting this tomorrow!
---
Eh. My hype is already pretty gone. If it had come out when it was supposed to I would have had tons of time to play it but now I‚Äôm just about to start working a bunch of overnights and don‚Äôt have any days off in awhile. I was playing like crazy leading up to it but I haven‚Äôt even played a single match since the delay got announced, went over to playing Yakuza again lol.
---
I mean at least it‚Äôs here before Halloween but ehh.
---
I do surveillance, ruin, make your choice and bbq
---
Make your choice is so silly when you hook them beside a gen and then 360 noscope cross-the-map slap the unhooker
---
Each time 3 or more survivors work on a generator for 40/30/20 seconds within a 20 meter radius get a token. 
---
After getting 4 tokens you gain the ability to instantly down a survivor that has already been on a hook. The effect only applies in the basement after the gates are open.
---
20 people want wraith gone......
---
Because randoms dont know what healing others is and I've run out of med kits. Tbh it's a must have.
---
It was announced the event currency will be in the rift and the event is literally only bloodpoints with event gens and hooks. Serum can be earned well after the event expires (you have 70 days).
---
Console is great for this. On ps4 I never heard of toxicity until I found this sub. It's the favourite word of most PC players, I think
---
Ah
---
will we be getting the double bp tomorrow becasue thats all im looking forward to rn

---
Unless it's my friend. Half the time makes a stupid mistake lmao
---
Thxüëç
---
Ever work on a generator and you have it at 99% and you needed just one more second to finish it, but the killer stops you just in time? 
---
Those couple seconds make the difference.
---
The amount of dopamine that releases in my brain when I hear that I jump-scare someone is enough to cure depression 6 separate times.
---
It's ok BB. https://youtu.be/NlrYn_dZdqk
---
Dedicated servered.
---
The shroud IS the best way to get found quickly by the killer in my experience though. Most killers immediately go to the opposite part of the map from where they spawned, since the survivors always spawn far away from the killer.
---
At least they make Pantry playable
---
Yeessss! But why didn't they tell us that they are already in the certification process ?
---
When you dont have ds but you make them wait it out and head on. Big brain time
---
Idk whether to be worried or happy for you lol.
---
I swear Patrick and his pet rock are always here when a meme is needed for BHVR's delays

Perks are for weaklings and the unworthy real players only play with no perks and no addons.

They never announced double BP? Don‚Äôt know where that came from. Plus with everything this update is gonna bring you‚Äôre worried about BP? Buddy, you need to get your priorities in order.
---
&gt;How many hours left? I live in completely different time zone.

Do you not have google in your time zone? Just google 11 AM ET.

While yeah, of course they should fix their shit first, and they can give back your bps with some extra after find out that you did not actually dc.

---
Thank you
---
Planning to when the series is finished
---
I really would be, I got used to this face and I'm kinda scared I might not like the new one. I have him on maxed perks and would be really sad to have to switch character if he turns out worse than before. I would prefer them leaving the old head as an extra so that we can choose which one to use
---
I think most people would be happy if they made a reworked face as a free cosmetic ‚Äî that way people who want the movie accurate face can use it and those who prefer the now iconic goblin face can still use that one ;)
---
Imagine that on legion.
---
He could make you mend for 5 mins. The old Franklin mistape could down survivors under 3 hits also lets not forget he have 150% movement speed and can vault pallets, he could make the mend timer go down under a chase. Look up noob3 "once upon a toxic legion".
---
I like empathy builds, because ~~its easier to activate we'll live forever~~ I like helping people
---
You really had me going in the first half.
---
I just don't use the stalking part of GF kit. I feel stalking takes way to long and doesn't seem very rewarding to me. I'd rather just have the no terror radius and spend that time getting a free hit on the survivor.
---
Pretty good tips. As a r1 ghostface main I'd like to add a few;
---
1. Try to stalk people from as far away as possible, don't expect good survivors to not notice you when stalking from 5 feet away.
---
2. Actually try to play stealthy and break LoS, don't waltz right up to gens and expect your no terror radius to carry you, then cry on reddit about how GF needs a buff.
---
3. However, I think you should attempt to hide right away if you're being broken out, the angles in this game are weird and if you accidentally wait too long you'll likely get broken out.
---
Are you saying dead hard is easy to use? I love the perk but it can be easily countered
---
This works the other way around as well.
---
I didn't even know about ET time, thanks
---
Yup
---
thanks!
---
Only time I'll even come close to face camping is endgame collapse but that's cause people are swarming so there is nowhere to go. If you tbag though you're getting the partial tunnel.
---
Cool!!!!!!!!! Where did I say he wasn't again? :) I even acknowledged that I "used the word wrong."
---
He "chased me down." Better?
---
I don't think you wanna say that here, a chunk of them think Self Care is still meta.
---
I‚Äôd say once you get used to knowing the locations of generators switch out deja vu for an exhaustion perk like balanced landing or sprint burst, otherwise pretty good
---
Yeah, so... Can play survivor, can't host games, and your connection must be fine. You must have one of those special versions of the game then i guess.
---
I‚Äôm wondering if those ‚Äúmajor issues‚Äù was the purple flashing textures you‚Äôd get on maps randomly
---
That would be a nice idea. Everyone wins. Although I could see some people upset about seeing the same character with a different face, although that would be pretty nitpicky
---
&gt;I didn't even know about ET time, thanks
---
It says on the tweet linked but apparently OP forgot to add this little piece of information in his title.
---
This literally happened to me the other night as the killer. üòí I‚Äôm still just beginning my Myers. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
As you get better at the game, there's less necessity to use aura perks to locate the killer and have a general sense of where they are. You don't have any of the major meta perks (which will require some grinding) but it isn't awful. I recommend swapping out Deja Vu and Kindred for We'll Make it and Empathy.
---
You might have a better time tracking your teammates via Empathy, healing them off hook with We'll Make it, and watching the killer via Dark Sense from gen completion. You should look into Borrowed Time through Bill, Adrenaline/Sprint Burst through Meg, and Decisive Strike through Laurie for an idea of some meta perks. Hope that helps!
---
If you were curious about Borrowed Time vs We'll Make it, BT has higher value during dangerous unhooks/end-game unhooking for that extra hit. WMI is very useful if you tend to go for safe unhooks for the quick healing. I have both but tend to lean towards WMI in my SWF since I'm generally not at risk when I unhook my friends.
---
Huntress is worse than clown and hag is worse than demogorgon may be the two hottest takes I‚Äôve seen today, and I argued with a dude who thought swf players should only be allowed to equip a perk once between all players in the swf. Clown isn‚Äôt even that good in the first place, much less better than huntress.
---
You‚Äôre giving off some big Rank 20 energy my guy, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying
---
They should just make it a full heal but give it a slight cooldown so people can't abuse it.
---
Yeah what the hell, I got the Switch version at launch and I've been addicted to the game since, was really looking forward to this..
---
Yeah... I'm happy to be camped if other survivors are working on gens.
---
Yeah, that summons up. I prefer Myers over ghost face, but if you love to be crouching that you can go for ghost face (I play pig when I want to crouch).
---
I like Pig but she doesn't get love from the developers and her traps can be annoying for your friends.
---
I don't recommend Leatherface and I think the Demogorgon isn't that great (he also is not in sale).
---
It can be a small supermarket and just one floor office building and the gate are elevators maybe?
---
There's always people like this
---
As I said to the other person who mentioned that, it would honestly be a pretty good solution, though some nitpicky people might be upset about seeing the same character with a different face
---
Will this put Undetectable on Tier 1 Myers (and other stealth killers)? I‚Äôd love to use his Scratched Mirror build with absolutely no Terror Radius, and not have to use MaA to achieve that. Let‚Äôs me bring a different perk instead and really get creative.
---
It's currently 50% off at the Steam Store if you're a PC player. I'd consider it worth it, especially if you can grab some friends to play with. I've put in roughly 150 hours since I bought it late summer and I've enjoyed myself thoroughly. Give it a try!
---
2 of the 3 employees are right.
---
i'm sad now
---
Flipflop is great if you do some Good ol sabo
---
Because it's actually not better than being injured. Really good survivors survive in chases for ages regardless of their heal state so it's better to put that time into a gen.
---
I believe I had a game like this and from what I remember, a mori can't be interrupted.
---
You‚Äôre missing a shitpost flair mate
---
He bbn uses console I play with him
---
I like the other guys idea of it being a cosmetic, but no I wouldn‚Äôt be upset. Quentin was one the few redeeming qualities of the reboot to me, I‚Äôd love to have his character actually resemble his actor. Don‚Äôt much care for his goblin look.
---
But the event is announced for tomorrow
---
We'll Make It whether you like it or not!
---
They should name the current one ‚Äúsleep deprived‚Äù to give it a reason for looking so different. He‚Äôs gotten absolutely no sleep so he looks like a complete mess. Hopefully that should suffice for the nitpicky people.
---
If killers are allowed to complain about t-bagging, then the survivors should be allowed to complain about camping imo
---
Don't get me wrong, I want the new face too, it might be nice and better looking, but I just don't want to take risks with this
---
Violence creates violence, toxicity creates toxicity. It's the circle of life
---
I‚Äôm not saying everyone would, but I could see some people in this community reacting that way
---
His profile is deleted.
---
Should be about 16:00 in Germany, that's great!
---
What a compliment haha
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any reason not to have both faces if they do go that route
---
I too would dodge a T-posing Jake
---
That‚Äôs a pretty great idea
---
Billy is overated. When he start to rev the chainsaw you can just run to the other side of the Wall. 
---
Btw OP maybe run addons like steering or thompson
---
"Lol meme build"
---
"No, I just think it's neat"
---
"Shut up memer"
---
They need to plan around their own set schedule first, that would be an improvement.
---
Nancy is solid. Her perks are much better and less difficult to meet the criteria for than Steve's, for example. Meg is another great starter survivor simply because she has some of the best perks and she's free. Bill is good too, BT being old reliable for unhooking.
---
Just imagine help just off everyone is going to be if they drop it on Halloween day and it only runs for that
---
Tomorrow at 11am est, announced a few mins ago
---
We live in a Dead Hard society
---
I used to feel this way but I decided I wanted to make full use of his power more so I just started playing tons of Ghost with the goal of prioritizing marking survivors and once you start to learn the appropriate vantage points on each map it gets much more viable and really fun
---
I always tell myself to never play survivor.
---
Not because I'm bad at juking, not because the killer was better, but the teammates.
---
Man, I can see problems which I've done and deduce from it, but when 3SWF straight-up sandbags you, that's what breaks me. "We are supposed to be a unit!"
---
I'm okay to trade my life for a "teammate", but id they have a chance to save me, they'll always leave even when I saved their dirty asses.
---
Today I tried survivor again. Gates are powered for a good minute and a half. I see tunneling killer tunneling dead-hook survivor. I go there and prevent their death. Obviously I change direction and go to the gate, since I got hit. "Huh, not even a single li- hatch? ESCAPES? EGC?! UNLUCKY GATES?"
---
How can you not get salty. It's usually me vs killer vs other survivors. I need to learn to be a bitch, but just can't. I need toxic survivors in my friends to learn to leave team behind when they need numbers...
---
are you sure about that
---
Lol they announced it like 20 minutes ago to come out tomorrow
---
Really hope this isn't another false alarm. I want to play this so bad!
---
Ah, I didnt knew about that last bit, that one makes me happy because I though the grind was going to get real during the event.
---
No ones forcing you to play meta
---
No, I've been campaigning for that shit since he was released.
---
&gt;Unless something drops in a few hours it's likely we're not gonna see a Halloween event in October.
---
&gt;F
---
You should be a detective or something. You seem to be pretty good at it.
---
I mean, if they are doing that, people are just gonna be madder. Broken updates garner much more anger than postponed updates.
---
They really did have issues they couldn't prevent, though
---
Tanato sloppy nurse calling gang rise up
---
Completely understandable. Sometimes I forget that I‚Äôm the killer when playing against him
---
What's the source?
---
Oddly fitting
---
Please stop with this "LOL" :|(not offensive)
---
Killer probably has closed the hatch and it‚Äôs end game. But because there is a bug with spectator mode, you still see two gens, that explains everything in this screen.
---
What are the updates? Or do we not know until tomorrow?
---
David will remember that.
---
Running around with no terror radius is definitely viable for me. Plus I can get in some really good jump scares which is probably the most fun for me.
---
Wait can only virgins **understand** this stuff? Is that why I'm not **understanding** this shit?
---
NOED
---
They actually just confirmed it's coming tomorrow
---
&gt;Ah, I didnt knew about that last bit, that one makes me happy because I though the grind was going to get real during the event.
---
Well, it doesn't hurt to do a little research or at least look at the hot pinned threads on this sub from time to time. We've known about this since October 8th: 
---
&gt;**Putrid Serum is only available in the free track of The Rift.** A total of 60 Putrid Serum are available this year, allowing you to earn up to 6 Hallowed cosmetics (or two full outfits). **Putrid Serum will remain in free track for the duration of The Rift**.

[NEWS | WITHERING BLIGHT EVENT OVERVIEW](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93854/news-withering-blight-event-overview).
---
Yes it does, the description in WMI is dated, it doesnt stack with itself (it used to) it doesnt mean it doesnt stack with other healings buffs
---
Im an old player too. since 2016 my guy. I give recent examples because they are the easiest to relate to for anyone who reads the comments. and you know what, if you wanna say that back then was trash, sure it was. Take a look at the old issues like insta blinds, infinites, and the brand new part we wish we still had. Ive gotten over it because the devs have gotten way better and have earned my respect when it comes to how much effort they put into this game and how open they are with us about it.
---
It will come out tomorrow at  11AM ET
---
Lol i always start these matches scared i will get owned but they end up crying i was camping lmao
---
= profit
---
Yeah I somehow must have received a unique version of the game only available to me and somehow the devs gave it to me specifically from the store. Thanks redditor.
---
Irrelevent now sorry bud :D
---
You know shit's gonna get REAL when a Donkey Jacket David joins a lobby though.
---
Replace dying light with sloppy butcher, then you're good
---
It is absurd for you to believe players are the same skill level across the ranks.  You can see it in their routing, looping or complete lack thereof, inability to hit skill checks and work through Ruin.  I'm not even going to entertain an intelligent conversation with someone that sincerely is stating a red rank and yellow rank survivor is no difference in ability and game knowledge.
---
Man i wish GF woulda came with Sidney... I'd main her like i main GF
---
thank goodness
---
Fair enough, though whenever someone has a major release you always consider some cushion time in case things go south.
---
The perks are very unbalanced in my opinion.
---
Probably hit or miss, depending on your region, time and day playing and other factors. 
---
Dedicated servers has actually made Killer queues faster than survivor queues for me which seems strange, but I‚Äôll take it
---
But the undetectable killer can still see the OoO survivor right?
---
Yeah it's not easy to use to dodge hits but the "dead hard for distance" can make loops last longer, and even then it's still a press E to dodge
---
Sandbagged by pointing towards him if He hid in a locker, Body blocked pallets unless it was A innocent nancy or the innocent baby jake with the francis skin on. My dude dc‚Äôd after the killer caught him in a basement locker, I didn‚Äôt even do much but seriously, Depip me in a scummy way such as facecamping me I depip you in a scummy way.
---
Dying light sucks and sloppy is way better for forever freddy, thana and sloppy have actual synergy unlike DL
---
Is forever Freddy like full on cucklord game slowdown with thanataphobia/ruin/PGTW/sloppy and jump rope swing chains for maximum slowdown or is it just like a normal Freddy build (BBQ/Ruin/Pop/STBFL) with swing chains and jump rope on.
---
I think so but im not sure.
---
It is
---
Myers is completely bugged on Dedicated Servers. You'll stalk survivors long enough to reach EW3 but the moment you let go of M2, your power gauge will rollback a bit.
---
What is the difference between Hilbilly and Leatherface?
---
Don't work on gens when some one Is being hooked.. boom countered
---
What are the best killer perks?
---
His name is Tru3 for chrissakes. He thinks his word is gospel.
---
Thanks for your opinion, do you think they‚Äôre too strong? Or only one sided? I tried to be as much fair as I could
---
Oh, I'm not trying to dissuade you. I don't disagree with either of those points. I'm just saying that using the stalk is viable because you said it feels like it takes too long
---
It doesn‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs another reason why I don‚Äôt like him.
---
I can have multiple reasons.
---
Edit: oh, I‚Äôve obtained my impression through optimal evidence based empirical logic.
---
Everyone is allowed to complain about anything, not every complaint is equally valid.
---
If this is gonna be a thing imma have PTSD
---
It's about more than just the "complaining". Purple rank survivors bringing their "toxic" builds, insta heals, haddonfield offering and being mad about the yellow rank killer camping one of them at the end when the gates are open...... maybe they shouldve brought borrowed time instead üòÇüòÇ
---
What is the current meta?
---
So you want to sabotage innocent survivors that just qued for a game instead of marking the actual asshole survivors on a list so if you find them you go sicko mode on them?
---
Also integrity? I don‚Äôt really see it there..
---
I have 300+ hours and didn‚Äôt know this.
---
Every doctor puts everyone in tier 3 so you can't do anything
---
The thing that I‚Äôve learned from other games like payday is that if you want to make a supportive build to help your teammates, it‚Äôs also important to make sure that you can keep yourself alive just a little bit too. So an exhaustion perk for that last slot is almost mandatory just so you can actually be supportive and not get tunneled into the ground and die.
---
Also WGLF is a selfish perk so idk how it fits into a support build.
---
I have a very weird audio problem.
---
So, basically the hearing distance is very low and I can only hear a generator being worked on if you turn my entire head to it, can't even hear it from the side or anything, I have to physicall face it to hear it making 3D Audio pretty useless tbh
---
I am a killer Main and I cant just stand moris anymore.
---
1. Games ends to quick and your back in a 20 mins que time
---
2. You just upset other players who will use their hate on new killers (tbagging, flash light clicking, "ez baby killer uninstall xd" and then will those killers become toxic later on and use broken stuff on survivors who just want to have a Nice game
---
And those survivors who wanted to have a Good time? They are toxic now 
---
We need to break this toxic cycle because it will just keep going forever if we keep doing this. The Only mori that should exist is the yellow one as you can only use it if its 1 survivor left. Hell maybe its also time to remove pink keys, insta heals iri huntress, prayer spirit, brand New parts, insta chainsaw addons, forever freddy. This game is both toxic and really unbalanced.
---
is it even possible? like through a mod or something or is behavior not allowing this kind of change in their game files? :o
---
yeah how dare they not consider your future work schedule when something out of their control causes an event to be postponed
---
I don‚Äôt care if they call me toxic, I will get called toxic/camper even if I play in the most legit way possible.
---
Idk but im scared
---
We all are  but then again lots of games are doing events at the same time  and when does end dbds  starts
---
"a soul for a soul"
---
It‚Äôs impossible to have a bug free release. That‚Äôs an impossible request
---
Basically lol!
---
I mean, if you're legit taking time off of work for a video game you're taking it way too seriously at that point 
---
Event is going live tomorrow, btw. Just announced on their Twitter
---
Lmao not my boy Jesus
---
Cause it is more of a lets farm perk
---
Welcome to dbd
---
yes
---
What about that p3 laurie gang? My friend and I both have p3 laurie's and killers dodge every single time if we both have that equipped lol.
---
Maybe she can stalk you through the tv for EXPOSED? Or maybe some other kind of benefit.
---
Players like you literally stopped me uninstalling the game when I was learning in the first couple of weeks. The most toxic response in chat was when in EW1 I snatched someone off a generator and by fuck, were they salty about that when I thought I'd done a pretty nice play.
---
To start, the best is to me: no one escape death. You'll see a lot of pepoles complaining about this perk but it's a life saviour (or ender if you are the survivor). Then there is brutal force and enduring if you hate pallets (trapper and hillbilly perk) but the 2 best perk that not a lot of pepoles will argue on is hex:ruin (hag), to slow the game down by a lot if no one find the totem. At low rank it's just super powerful, no one know what to do. The the other best is barbeque and chilli (cannibal). This perk allow you to see survivors that are far aways from you, and also double you bloodpoints that you earns. Also really good perks are bamboozle and pop goes the weasle (both clown). The first allow you to block windows, this can end chase much quickers, and the other allows you to kick a gen so hard it regress by 25% in one hit. Here are the best perks in my opinion, ans in the opinion of the meta ! Hope that helps ! (Sorry for my bad english)
---
Playing solo without self care is AIDS
---
but its coming tomorrow... supposedly
---
Me too. To add salt to the wound, the game is on sale on PS4 for 15$ and all the dlc is between 3-4$. Seriously wtf. They should have hired someone else to do The Switch version. I‚Äôm no developer but they don‚Äôt seem to know what they‚Äôre doing there.
---
I have had this happen to me on my Xbox. it happens when you're on the hook sometimes and you get the point of view of the killer from third person.
---
Nah for spirit, they make the same noises anyway
---
This assumes the game isn‚Äôt over by the time you have tier 3
---
Thanks!
---
Same thing happens on Xbone. I try to counter it with a nice message to new players, even a GGWP is appreciated.
---
It was in the game files PTB, dont remember the exact dates but i think it was 10/31-11/4, it corresponded with the weekend.
---
Lol I get it, because it's never actually fun but we play it anyways
---
New killer: The Rat.
---
New Survivor: Jeremy Boomerson
---
On my busy day where I won't be able to play üòî
---
They better fix the constant infinite loading screens after matches too.
---
YES!
---
Lots of bugs
---
I feel like slender man is too OP to be a DBD killer. He‚Äôs like on the entity‚Äôs level. 
---
I‚Äôd like slender man too, but idk how they‚Äôd do it without him feeling neutered.
---
Yay! And just in time for Halloween too.
---
Carefully, he is a hero
---
u/sredruMurders
---
Why are the perks pink ü§î
---
You are not alone. I work on my support build as well. :) It's boring af to use the same four perks every time. That is why I experiment with many different ones. Fuck the meta.
---
Woah was this me? 
---
I played a game recently as Ghostface with 2 dc‚Äôs. I kinda just goofed around a bit and watched them finish the gens
---
 Beautiful
---
Mean Girl: What do you mean by getting the killer's attention? Also, I think the bonuses aren't balanced because 15% in repairing gens is too much, and 15% for healing &amp; opening the gates are basically "Wake Up!" and "Botany Knowledge", but less optimal and without guarantee you'll use the perk since it's only for 60 seconds.
---
Not Playing Fair: I honestly like the idea. However, if you're being chased and you're running into an area that doesn't have any pallet, you'll be down before one respawn. And, 4 survivors running this perk would make the gameplay terrible for killers. This wouldn't be healthy for the game at all.
---
Giver: This would be MoM all over again, there's no way to balance it around. 
---
Red Devil's power: 40% MS bonus? The number is way up, there's simply no point for a survivor to try and survive here. I love the penalty for every action, though.
---
Blood fetish: 6 seconds is too low. That being said, I love the idea, and if they managed to rework Distortion to make it more reliable, then I'd say why not.
---
Panic mode: We already have Infectious Fright for that.
---
Red is your color: This is way too strong. Maybe putting them into a broken status for some time?
---
I'm not a professional, though, so take this with a grain of salt. :)
---
Also helps you with snapping out of the doctors madness. Love it just for that.
---
Yes, and the nurse could not blink she was bugged too. In the end she DCed  because no one could take me off the hook.
---
Sloppy Butcher.
---
"Danganronpa amino" I am getting severe PTSD rn
---
Why dodge when you can bring an ebony mori?
---
I would switch discordance to surveliance unless you play against SWF.  You will be suprised how many soloq survivors works alone on a generator
---
I would love to play with you. It's customary to exchange nudes first to really bond with each other to improve our team chemistry. I'll await your inbox.
---
oh fuck oh god I forgot to crop that out
---
Are you sure you're not being classed as Rank 16? Sometimes there's a discrepancy in Rank if you're right on the cusp of going up a Rank.
---
I ask because up until Rank 16 you'll be handled differently in matchmaking - low ranks are given priority so that they get matches faster, even if that means putting them in/against Red ranks.
---
Myers when he sees a afk survivor
---
PogChamp
---
.... That's... literally exactly what i just sarcastically said. Which *obviously* isn't the case, so again, it's a problem on your end. I'm playing as we speak... Survivor lobbies are loading in 2mins, killer lobbies in 30 seconds.
---
Why ask for advice, and then deny whatever people tell you could be the issue. Figure it out yourself then, bud.
---
Dead Hard is not meta. It‚Äôs miles behind BL and Lithe.
---
 DH has become the new SB with new players thinking it‚Äôs OP.
---
What you call support healer I call losing my mind trying to be the first one to unhook my teammates while also not getting them killed by the killer so that I can get my tokens. Its stressful. Just fucking. Meg. I can heal them faster than you can run. Stop.
---
Would you mind if I joined you?
---
Ive been trying to find people who play this, it‚Äôs so frustrating playing solo queue
---
Someone finally got it!
---
Isn‚Äôt unnerving presence attached to tr?
---
SC is always going to be viable. Don‚Äôt listen to that person, it‚Äôs probably a killermain trying to dissuade people off it (like survivormains who try to tell killers Ruin is bad.)
---
I already told you my connection is fine
---
I play friendly killer so the only time I lobby dodge is if two or more survivors look too much alike. It makes telling apart who I‚Äôve hooked twice and who I haven‚Äôt harder.
---
Only thing I won't dodge here is shirtless David. I go pig and take him to the mattress below badham üòè
---
No the whole reason we are getting it tomorrow was because it was bugged.
---
To release it with bugs anyway after delaying and saying it was to fix the bugs would be ridiculous.
---
See I definately respect this response. This is fair. I even agree with you. I just wish more of our community that claims to "love" this game would cut it some slack.
---
Yep. Pointless for head pops.
---
Oh really? I assumed he retained that bit but I guess he is just invisible like wraith while he is far away then.
---
And what about the "toxic" killer builds,  noed, BBQ, ruin, thanatophobia? Not to be disrespectful or anything, but if you have to rely on downing and hooking a just saved survivor maybe youre not that good of a killer....
---
[**r/suspiciouslyspecific**](https://www.reddit.com/r/suspiciouslyspecific/) **btw**
---
The Switch is a whole different beast compared to other platforms. It's power and architecture make it need some extra love. It can do some amazing things, but it takes some work to get it there.
---
They‚Äôre releasing it tomorrow so I guess it fits more than it did before
---
It's most definitely not.
---
To be fair, for killers like Hag or Legion girls, purely the effort to pick him up should be ko.
---
I mean poor Lisa has literally only bones left and David probably weights like a small pickup truck...
---
Hadn‚Äôt considered that, but I‚Äôd hit boxes did efficiently work maybe it would work? Idk
---
‚ÄúMad‚Äù
---
I have no idea then. Doesn‚Äôt take me that long ever.
---
So just for clarification, I can now do Jumpscare Myers without Monitor and Abuse?
---
Oh ok thank God that gives me plenty of time thank you for letting me know that! I thought it was gonna be a short event only lasting a couple of days.
---
It's already confirmed for tomorrow 11am et
---
I'd rather have new broken content than old fixed content. New is new a fresh experience. Old is same old same old.
---
What does luck do or what does it affect? Been playing a while but still don‚Äôt really have any clue what it affects
---
That tricky beeatch!!
---
Yes run m&amp;a with whispers and you‚Äôll know about them before they know about u. Crouch right up to them
---
You obviously don‚Äôt
---
It would still be infinitely better on a cooldown than only affecting one random survivor.
---
they are rushing it because of twitch rivals if anything
---
woohooooooo!!
---
We can agree that stealth players (immersed Claudette‚Äôs) is ‚Äúinfinitely‚Äù worse than those who ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù  and three gens in. 1 hook is amazing if you can‚Äôt do at least one and are searching for a key the 240 seconds it takes to do three gens by your self then your helping no one and need to get better at the game. And skill is based off knowledge of loops not being able to crouch in a cornfield
---
In 16 hours 44 minutes and 10 seconds from now you definitely can!
---
Ahahah, so much staaaaaaalk.. i muuust staaalk !
---
Laughs in "leave game".
---
thank god
---
sadly I don‚Äôt have a day off for like a week now to actually get down and grind it but it should still be here in time for my next weekend off
---
I wish too üòä
---
yeah! that‚Äôs the spirit!!
---
Normal tombstone will actually kick you out of tier 3
---
If you run judith's tombstone then you can do it but as others have already stated here it is extremely difficult to pull off.
---
Unnerving + distressing on small maps means constant tiny skillchecks on boxes.
---
The perk in its current state makes it impossible to tunnel the obsession. It switches the obsession every time an unhook occurs. If the obsession happens to switch to a person on deathhook, you just have to say ‚Äúaw shucks‚Äù and let that person live as long as possible. It‚Äôs shit design.
---
I like your username
---
unaccEPTABLE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
woohooooo!
---
Spirit mains have gotten good at using her power. Since she can still hear your grunts of pain, the chase is extremely one sided when you are injured since the survivor cant see her at all.
---
and youre saying they dont already know this? You linked to the THEIR page....
---
Don‚Äôt ask people for help on Reddit if you‚Äôre going to be rude to every single one of them. They came here to help you, not sabotage you. Calm down.
---
I've got about 1k hours in each role, Self Care is good for newer players but becomes redundant once you're able to last in chases for a while.
---
I 100% agree with that, but I think killers arent entirely innocent either
---
I almost never get any DCs, and even if I do, I don't give mercy or expect it from anyone else.
---
It was never confirmed so dont get your hopes up
---
hahaha
---
Sadly it only affects your chances of escaping from a hook and escaping a bear trap. Doesn't affect anything like the loot you get from chests.
---
Default david yes, but he looks pretty good with the beard not gonna lie
---
Clearly picked him cuz he's the only person in the game next to which she's gonna look like the cuter one...
---
Yay!!!
---
Well, i usually get good timing but It is true than sonetimes people really wanna race to get those unhooks
---
Halloween in October? What a time to be alive.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Sure man ps4 right
---
If so add me at thiccer_kid6969
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm maining killer (Spirit) just now after 1+ year of being a survivor main and damn the first weeks of getting used to everything and the frustrations are so damn hard
---
I used to loathe and curse at tunneling killers as a survivor only main, but as a killer I realized how easy it was to find the injured one without even meaning to., and although I hate doing it and it being done to me, I realize it is not usually because of ill will. 
---
You play the way you enjoy the game, without purposely causing grief in other players, man. Enjoy the game and don‚Äôt stress too much, and yknow, bitchy people gonna bitch. 
---
So you play you, and good luck with Michael! I personally suck as him but playing against him is really fun, especially with the little jump scares that make up the horror of dbd :)
---
Omega nurse is still in the new patch it just finally has a drawback now
---
I really run whatever the fuck looks and feels fun to use, elitist survivors can suck it
---
While I agree with you since the last update the following happens regularly to people:
---
Survivor drops a pallet on the killer while he/she is still in the first frames of the attack. You get the pallet stun score event, but instead of stopping the attack like it should do in that scenario, the attack still follows through, effectively hitting through/ over an the dropped pallet.
---
People are not complaining about close calls where you hit them at the same time as the pallet drops I think. There‚Äôs just some hits happening atm which just should never be able to connect in the first place.
---
It‚Äôs not happening that often, but frequently enough to warrant concern.
---
Why does there need to be a Halloween event when it's spooky time all the time?
---
Yes, it is. Whether you believe it or not, your internet is the issue. I had this exact problem and I sort of fixed it by restarting my router. Also, you should atleast try. The fact that you think you're right and we are wrong about this makes you look like an absolute buffoon. And as I said earlier, contact support.
---
Plague and Demo are both underrated killers. Demo has better survivors, if that ever matters. Spirit gets a lot of unfounded hate due to the top 1%'s whining about her and might make your game experience less pleasant.
---
Seething Entertainer glitched for anyone else on PS4? Knife is invisible
---
And that is why you never let them go.  All survivors are assholes
---
implying pallet blinding doesn't get them downed anyway.  Headphones are OP
---
Mean girl: Caught the killers attention by doing rush actions  like fast vaults. I think it‚Äôs a pretty good idea. You‚Äôll have a bonus to do actions but also the killer will know where you are. 
---
Also you‚Äôre right, 40% is too much, maybe 15% faster? I never play as killer so I don‚Äôt know how to do it balanced. 
---
Maybe in red is your color the killer could suffer a penalty during the wiggle time, survivor can get out faster.
---
She‚Äôs would be too OP lmao
---
I always grab the locker dweller lol Idk about DS lol
---
I know that there‚Äôs a lot of bugs but it kinda sucks because it‚Äôs my first Halloween event
---
Ruin is a must because you will not be putting any pressure on them early 
---
Insidious and/or monitor and abuse will really come in handy if you can sneak up and get fed some stalk points 
---
And then idk maybe some pallet/stun perks to keep you from getting looped to easily.
---
Wow just on time BHVR! Just let's hope for no new major bugs with this patch.
---
If you buy Shirtless David King then 7/10 killers will spare you.
---
I think you‚Äôre neglecting the fact that headsets pause when in TR, you‚Äôd want as small a terror radius as possible, making it huge is just countering yourself
---
But.
---
Self Care, Empathy and We'll Make It ARE part of the meta.........
---
Hope is the real OG. It really helps with looping while waiting for someone to open the door.
---
Literally no one says that
---
Yes. Postgame chat + memory of the match. 60 second timer. Yeah
---
I saw the comment you made before you deleted it in reply to my advice to you. Nice try though.
---
Ghostface lmao
---
They probably just now heard the certification went through and didn‚Äôt want to get anyone‚Äôs hopes up ahead of time.
---
I didn‚Äôt delete any comments so idk what you think is happening
---
Lol fuck, forget it. Like this guy mentioned above, contact their support team then instead of arguing on reddit. I'm gonna go play me some killer games now, they're lots of fun. üëç. Take care.
---
If you have headphones you don't need lightborne.
---
For anyone not familiar with Jeremy, this is 1000% true. I love this strange, strange man; everything about him is contradictory to common sense and yet he's one of the funniest people I know of.
---
Lies, deception.
---
If they start over again, would they be back to never being hooked?
---
The fact that you think it‚Äôs incomprehensible that it‚Äôs a problem with the game instead of on my end makes you look like a bufoon
---
Isn't that like saying Remember Me/Blood Warden/Bitter Murmur/Rancor are also bad for the same reason? 
---
You don't take it because you *want* the survivors to do gens, you take it *in case* the end game occurs you have a backup plan.
---
????
---
I'm agreeing with you
---
Shit that response was quick
---
I‚Äôm looking for actual advice instead of redditors commenting  that I‚Äôm wrong so please feel free to move on if you have nothing to say
---
A teabag well deserved then ;)
---
I'm poor so hears a silver medal ü•à
---
Honestly though, that's a brilliant fucking idea.
---
Why are you still here arguing about this shit? Go to the support website and get help there. We aren't going to help a dude that's literally an asshole to everyone that tries to help him.
---
I really enjoy doing perk roulette. Meta perky are boring. When you play survivor you don't necessarily need to run meta perks, different story when you play killer
---
Lol I‚Äôm here all day. 
---
Also if you‚Äôre reference this I will love you forever: https://i.imgur.com/o3WNxo8.jpg
---
You aren‚Äôt everyone
---
The perks most will say are the strongest: Ruin, BBQ&amp;C, Nurses Calling, Pop Goes the Weasel, Enduring(+Spirit Fury), Save the Best for Last.
---
Eirri is the best.
---
Well bad news for you, I don‚Äôt.
---
My perk set but dead hard is self care
---
tonight's games are going to be a shit show. syringes and 3 blinks/omegablink everywhere. 
---
good time to take a night off.
---
Well, color me pleasantly surprised...just in the nick of time.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the map so they can immediately pop ruin even faster lol
---
I had a game like this today playing as Freddy. After many trees were hit I managed to convince Bill to not run away and follow me, Claudette on the other hand kept trying to loop me around killer shack even though I was smacking god pallet so I left her alone only to see her jump in the hatch next to Bill while he was working on a gen. Long story short Claudette mains are dumb af

Self Care falls off when the average time it takes for a Killer to get you from injured to downed is longer than the time it takes you to heal yourself from injured to healthy. This is 32s for Self-Care 3, which increases to about 39s (I think) if the killer is running Sloppy Butcher. 
---
I usually just run a med kit instead.
---
My advice: learn to play with one hand.
---
Yeah but you need killer to be looking at you at all the times
---
But did they fix your issue? No? Exactly. Now go the help from the support team. Also I'm not offended, I'm baffled about how fucking stupid a person can be. Asking for advice and then being a prick about it. Want me to link the support website to you? Here you go since you can't find it yourself: https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us
---
I'm sick of seeing these fucking memes dude. They're so stale at this point and genuinely fucking effortless to make.
---
How is it selfish
---
For some reason i think the legion is based off their family cult series
---
Idk dude, I played against spirit several times and survived to her at the same rate. Against her I have something like 50% survival rate and I'm pretty bad at chases, I'm decent at jukes and hide (lithe-dance with me ftw). Playing as Spirit I actually see people are either potatoes that are so obvious I don't even have to bother following them but just predict while others are pretty good and since I don't use headphones I really have to be careful on their movements
---
I know that with headphones she's so freaking strong but running iron will to make jukes and mind games, I never had problems with her in the first place. Only about prayer beads I can actually agree that was uncalled for, but for the rest, she's fine. I don't wanna see her base kit nerfed tbh, just get rid of prayer and maybe, just maybe, make her wooshing sound slightly louder when she is phasing, that's it
---
I mean is it wrong that there are a bunch of people who planned and were excited to play during an even for a long period of time where people have time off, but now won't have time off/the holidays will be over, so they won't get to really participate?
---
Can we not act like they're now this amazing dev team and are doing this to benefit us or something, just because it's finally coming out?
---
I know multiple people that had a BUNCH of time off, but are now not going to have much time to play the event. It's nice that you will, they won't, they can stay being annoyed at BVHR for how they consistently handle things...
---
I would pick huntress. To me she has way more of a skill range and most of the time when she hits you with an axe it feels more honest where as the wrath I feel there‚Äôs a a lower smaller skill gap, it feels more like a 50/50 if you run the right way. I‚Äôm not saying that wrath‚Äôs takes no skill but I always feel like it‚Äôs my fault when a huntress downs me where as a wrath it‚Äôs just kinda like ‚Äúyup that happened‚Äù
---
I don not want an it chapter
---
IMO it depends on the player. If the wraith is a decent human being and doesn‚Äôt camp and what not, I‚Äôd say wraith is more fun to play against. Huntress is fun to play against if they‚Äôre decent at aiming. If the killer can‚Äôt aim whatsoever, it‚Äôs boring, If they‚Äôre too good at aiming, it‚Äôs just annoying. So you can pick which one you‚Äôd rather play.
---
Spine chill, but not premonition. (Premo trumps stealth abilities)
---
I had a clutch hatch escape against a Freddy last night (and took a Nea along with me), but he did get a hit in on me.
---
He just didn't count on me having a skeleton key.
---
Check out truetalents ghostface videos with his build, its extremely strong and the playstyle makes him a very strong killer
---
I‚Äôve done some testing and obviously it‚Äôs biased but it felt like whenever I brought it, I either gethealed by another survivor or I‚Äôm against an instadown killer.  
---
When I didn‚Äôt bring it, I‚Äôd never see teammates or there was no time to heal me at the hook. Of course I was vs m1 killers.
---
No you‚Äôre clearly offended and you didn‚Äôt fix my issue in the slightest, they actually gave useful advice
---
It's not  infeasible, but they really don't share a lotta similarities except "creepy group of killers with mask." Which in and of itself isn't a wholly unique concept.
---
Glad I'm not alone
---
Please stop downvoting him, and balances landing, even when exhausted, makes it so you don‚Äôt stagger when falling. Since you aren‚Äôt always on a map where you can easily use balanced landing, dead hard saves you from not having any exhaustion perk, and also using two exhaustion perks could confuse the killer.
---
üÜóÔ∏è
---
I have literally never seen another Survivor running Empathy, and rarely see WMI. As other perks have been introduced (DH, DS, etc.) I have seen way fewer people running SC.
---
[indeed](https://media2.giphy.com/media/HN0iiJFme6H2E/giphy.gif)
---
it cant be no ed theres 2 gens left
---
Personally, I enjoy using aftercare, empathy, we'll make it and autodidact for super support healer build. It's really satisfying to land autodidact checks and possible heal someone in 3 seconds.
---
Thats okay for me. Playing ghostface against Simeone with spine chill is nearly Impossable
---
you know, almost every single thing you described can be said for survivors. I can also see the grass move when she's phasing and breathing can't be heard when she phase, its too loud for it and for how buggy the sounds are for killer. At least in my experience, I hear someone on my left like its touching me when its at least 20mt away or it sounds so freaking distant while someone is in front of me. So, not really, if you think you can hear that much while phasing, idk what to tell you. Maybe you have a 4k$ headphones
---
that "i 4k everytime easily" isn't an argument not knowing your rank and the fact you can easily lie to make your point. so to make it short, its irrelevant
---
We already have Sprint Burst this week, a back to back would be interesting to see :D Iron Will sounds great!
---
Best answer üíØ
---
Fr? Better not be giving me hope
---
Thanataphobia is the one perk that makes me wanna play killer one day
---
the hatch wasnt closed yet he closed it a bit after
---
Nea is hotter sorry :/
---
It‚Äôs a reminder, not a joke, fool
---
sorry it was hard to tell the tone of that
---
Can't tell if 14 or 40.
---
There are some childish insults going on here, but I also sense some boomer vibes. If you could answer the following questions, this would be greatly appreciated.
---
1.) Do you drink Monster energy?
---
2.) Do you post and like Facebook memes?
---
3.) "Phone bad" - on a scale of 1 to 10, how strongly do you agree with the previous sentence?
---
I look eagerly towards your response, thank you.
---
üÜíÔ∏è
---
Can I get an emote for this pls BHVR
---
Wait? I thought we could get serum through the event too. That sucks =(
---
For one, that wasnt the only buff, but regardless it's a massive one. Spirit originally was quite garbage because of the directional phasing sounds that made it very easy to avoid a spirit phasing. But they also made it to where you can't even hear the phasing sounds in her terror radius, so now you don't even know if shes actually phasing or not. 
---
Disregarding, everything else, if you think those were minor buffs, I guess I'm done trying to reason with you.
---
IT'S NOT A PHASE, ENTITY. YOU'RE NOT EVEN MY REAL ELDRITCH DEITY.
---
Tombstone Piece doesn't work with Tuft Of Hair. You DO get unlimited EW3 but once you actually tombstone someone you drop to tier 2. 
---
Either run tombstone piece with J Myers Memorial for faster stalking, 99 EW3 and pop it right before tombstoning, or Tuft Of Hair with Judith's Tombstone for unlimited EW3 and unlimited murdering, although it takes so fucking long to hit EW3 (+ Judith's tombstone slows you down, so you need play with your food) it's more of a novelty build than an actual effective one.
---
There is an achievement for tombstoning all 4 with tuft + judith's tombstone though. Besides going for that achievement, tuft + judith's is pretty garbage.
---
Buy him I did just 2 days ago. But full perk build him first
---
Honestly my scariest jumpscares have been going to reload and unexpectedly seeing a survivor rape my eyes
---
Cosmetics don't really bother me.
---
But if you're using a key in SWF, I 100% do not want to play you. Even outside SWF, I'm going to be tempted to dodge.
---
I love that the guys are so happy that they are answering to a lot of questions and reaction in their replies
---
Still it is too overrated and noone wants to see 8 year olds on this game because they say n&amp;a productions calling pennywise the dancing clown at 3 am challenge (OMGODNESS HE SUCKED MY PP) and think it is the greatest film in existence because they begged theyre mommy to pirate the movie off of showbox then when they die they say i fucked ur mom last night get shrekt noob.
---
Premo is pretty useless against gf anyway unless he's behind a wall. You've probably already revealed him by the time you look in his direction.
---
It's a good thing. There's no "I was away for a week and missed the event." since the event is completely unrelated to the serums and you have a very long length of time to earn the serums.
---
Whoa whoa whoa, what about Switch? :(
---
That‚Äôs also a completely fair way to use his power, but you should still stalk, because why get a free hit when you can get a free down? But I get what you mean.
---
Turn that frown upside down Creepy Clown :)  They got here before Halloween, be happy and enjoy it.
---
I have fun with Ghost Face, he's definitely not the best but he's probably a solid B tier. His teachables arent very good, so I usually just run the basic build of BBQ, Ruin, etc.
---
It's dbd there's always bugs
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cym3o8/survivors_having_unique_stats/
---
I'm insulted
---
To be fair, I would dodge a lobby if I saw Jake T-Posing on me before the game started.
---
Vigo's shroud plus corrupt intervention. Now all 4 of them are equally far from working gens
---
If you saw my reply your reply seemed like something about a reply i made on an it chapter post and ranted about 8 year olds
---
If the Switch doesn't get update tomorrow, at least while they delay us they could put Bubba and Freddles in the game
---
You must play Fallout 76
---
Hate to be the bearer of bad and obvious news, but they have announced that the evnt will be out tomorrow. Yaaay I guess?
---
Good meme though
---
Lithe being meta? Really? Heavily disagree.
---
Really? How?
---
So is there any way to turn on my PS4 remotely so that by the time I get home from work the game is updated?
---
BHVR replied on twitter to this same question; they said the Switch update is still delayed. They've run into major issues.
---
Remember how many people said it won‚Äôt come in October.
---
So you want his base kit to incorporate the bloody coils ultra-rare add-on? I'm not convinced that's a good idea at all.
---
You said a killer with a rocket launcher
---
Community manager doing a good job on Twitter, lots of great and funny responses. I bet they'd get more involved on Reddit too, if all y'all had even an ounce of chill. lol
---
he's right tho..
---
maybe you should take him as an example since I never have a problem with spirit either unless she uses prayer beads that grants her first hit
---
Trapper is a lot of fun. I like him a lot more after watching Samination, too. I just wish they'd buff him up a little bit.
---
Wait how can I voice chat in the game in ps4?
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying
---
Jokes on them, Pig Mains are gonna weep a liiiiittle longer against my stealth build üôÇ
---
Eh, you always try to pull them out of the locker otherwise you may get screwed by Inner Strength. You just have to juke it a few times in case of Head On.
---
That said, I usually avoid having to deal with DS at all unless they just literally run into me off the hook, at which point I slug them and continue chasing someone else.
---
I mean every single game for the past 3 weeks has had at least one or two instaheals.
---
I'm hoping I'm right because I dont want to keep leveling nurse.
---
&gt;he's right tho..
---
&gt;maybe you should take him as an example since I never have a problem with spirit either unless she uses prayer beads that grants her first hit
---
üëç üòÇ
---
Not to be that guy, but how would they put survivors on the hook
---
Spine chill does affect vault speed still. If you look at the wiki is says it under ‚ÄúAffected interaction speeds‚Äù
---
I love a good cup of t in the morning
---
Its Tuesday.
---
How bout no, this would make the game pay 2 win on survivor side. Plus it‚Äôs make the game irritating like just gave bill a free mettle of man for nothing. That‚Äôs stupid. We don‚Äôt need any buffs like that. It‚Äôs fine how it is
---
Today is Tuesday.
---
Wait, what about on the Switch?
---
I'm new, but i had good matches with bbq, pgtw, nurses calling and thanato/discordance, he's really fun to play.
---
yeah, its what I said.. you could hear her wooshing sound and know where she was. did you missed that? it was the first sentence..
---
no, they were nice buffs but aren't game breaking. Make her phasing no more directional was really good but it's not like game breaking. She still blind while phasing, you know that right? the only thing is about prayer beads which should be changed, that's it
---
not be able to be heard in the terror radius also is a very good buff. what do you expect with the drawback of being blind?? do you want a legion 2.0? well... after what happened maybe is really what you want since you are here whining about spirit while nurse is a thing
---
That sounds too op 
---
I love it
---
You can't derank past 15...its obvious they just haven't played in a few resets.
---
It's not intended to be a "buff". 
---
It should have an upside and a downside. Something to make characters unique, maybe something tied in with their backstory.
---
It something would be considered a straight "buff" thats not what I meant. The Bill idea was a more extreme one, for sure, but as I said - its not balanced.
---
Thanks for that.
---
Ummmmmmmmm
---
They do know nintendo switch exists, right?

I always run a support healer as Claudette! ü•∞

Survivors dont get shit if the killer dcs and they lose items and ad ons

Cool, glad I have three days off this week.
---
Well it‚Äôs in endgame mode now. Once hatch closes they have to go to the gates. 
---
This is the last player alive after all.
---
Thank you for pointing this out! Their replies are hilarious!
---
I thought she will be using Yakuyoke amulet
---
Haven't encountered that yet, what does it do?
---
Here hear
---
Hey, I've seen this one before
---
Wouldn't that male Jane's teachable litetally useless in herself.
---
He‚Äôs real easy to reveal
---
People think self care is bad now?
---
If that means better ideas then yes
---
But then the game becomes pay to win, they‚Äôd do the same thing with teachables. So quirks would become cross over so you can get them on any survivor.
---
YES! You need to set it up from home ahead of time but you can download the free PS4 Remote Play app from the Apple AppStore or Google Play Store to do this.
---
On PTB every level cost 100 Auric Cells. https://youtu.be/0naFG8nSNuk?t=97
---
So yes, unless they remove this when the battle pass goes live.
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
---
Huntress.
---
I've faced too many ass hat Wraiths.
---
I get being upset at first, but it‚Äôs been a week now and the update is coming. This whiny act is becoming straight up ridiculous.
---
Again, there is counter play for insta downs. That‚Äôs what makes it different.
---
YES!!
---
I'll laugh but no upvote, I see you with that ifunny logo
---
People have done testing. And I played with friends that ran both.
---
Now here's the real lesson, rank doesn't mean absolutely anything and the further from red rank you are the more fun you'll have. So be happy that the killers did you a favor by depipping you :).
---
Once the exit gates are open and the timer begins, if you hook a survivor then nobody is able to leave and the exit gates are blocked for 1 minute. If the killer waits one minute before hooking somebody then everyone dies to endgame collapse because the end game timer is 2 minutes
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm fully expecting the hate to go into tomorrow even though they are giving it to us on Halloween like everyone was wanting.
---
ugh meta is the four perks in pick deadhard adren borrowed time and ds
---
Mordeo would probably be the best fit but Demodog already took the lunge.
---
Maybe Shelly
---
Sunny family cult Legion cosmetics would be epic.
---
i've ran into 5 objects of obsession as ghostface in a row in the last hour alone lmao.
---
Yeah, I also remember that a while ago devs took off the vault speed, but then gave back
---
Still a dead reference eitger way
---
Ding ding ding! This post is to adorable!
---
How does this make the game pay 2 win?
---
If thats your argument it already is pay2win, as you need all characters to unlock all perks or be extremly patient on the shrine of secrets.
---
No but licensed survivors you can‚Äôt get. That‚Äôs the whole reason teachables are useful. Therefore quirks would be teachable. Plus they aren‚Äôt needed in the game.
---
I had a Game yesterday against pig.
---
At the exact same spot spawned a jigsaw box.
---
No chance to use it üòÇ
---
Wraith is annoying to face, Huntress is actually intimidating
---
It is indeed a repost
---
This is so cool!
---
which killers do you think are weaker than him? atm people would say clown and doctor. Although there is a doctor main ArchDruidRay and he destroys people consistently as Scorpionz on Pig
---
Repost
---
Don't use his power during chases, really? I use it almost every single chase and it definitely bamboozles them. I'm also trying to be disciplined and use his stalk more but I just can't help myself rushing up to somebody on a generator and snatching them off of it. It's just so damn satisfying.
---
Old Freddy sounded really fun and fit into the character really well but he was really hard to get to work
---
Because this content is not yours, nor is it credited to the creator "CowsIAM," it will be removed. This community has a real issue giving credit to people who actually make content.
---
I wouldn't even go for the cooldown. You have to be injured to use it. And if it was 1:1, if multiple people healed one person, they're returns would diminish.
---
I think the injured requirement keeps it in check as is.
---
Love it
---
Nah ofc not
---
Awesome, is that different from the regular PS app?
---
Yes, you are corrected. It was just an example and in this case not even really fitting with Jane. Just examples for the general concept.
---
Patch notes out 10:30 AM EST
---
I love how the Nurse's feet doesnt level with the other characters. Nice attention to detail right there!
---
Sauce?
---
‚ÄúExcept head on‚Äù could be a modification.
---
Switch not getting it... No chance they'd adjust the event for a certain console, right?
---
Yes I agree that having Pennywise in the game at this moment is kind of obnoxious, give us original content, but saying that it's because a clown is already in the game is dumb.
---
The scariest thing for me has been trying to teach my friend how to figure out who the killer is while doing a gen. As I was saying "I havent heard a terror radius yet and nobody's been hit so it's probably a stealth killer, wraith, ghostface or myers" I turn around and like 40 meters behind us is Myers just standing there. Menacingly.
---
It's okay to not about face just because they finally update, lol.
---
&gt; whiny act
---
Or maybe some of us just don't treat dev teams like Instagram models who comment back to us sometimes so we'll keep giving them money...
---
I had someone shit talk me yesterday for using self care, lmao
---
How has it changed if you don't mind me asking
---
Still no reply from mr negative? Going through ur post history... god damn i've yet to see someone this pathetic. I can see why u don't like hereditary or babadook when you're watching ''TheDickShow'' LOOOOL. There's something wrong with you, get help asap.
---
They will. They won‚Äôt alienate switch users.
---
The TL;DR for the build is basically nurses calling, ruin/corrupt intervention, sloppy butcher, and thanatophobia with the 2 power recovery addons.  You basically sneak up to people, get a free hit, and if they run to a loop, leave them, use your power, get another free hit.  Sloppy/thana slows them down if they decide to heal, and you can catch them off guard later with nurses.  It's a super fun build to play imo.  Way more fun than his stalking playstyle.  Of course, there's a few situations where you may want to stalk anyway (for example, if you see someone opening an exit gate but they don't see you) but it's not often.
---
&gt;!But Nintendo Switch!&lt;

I like him, not the best super high ranks though. Never stopped me, high ranks is just annoying as fuck cuz you just see the same damn thing over and over
---
As a p350 hag and trapper hag definitely takes more skill and is more viable, though trapper can be some extreme fun to play. He needs a buff though, he has a strong ability but his weakness is that he doesn‚Äôt start with his traps. That‚Äôs all he needs. Overall play who you want, have fun, and let others have fun.
---
It‚Äôll be 1000 auric cells, and if you complete the entire battle pass you‚Äôll get the 1000 auric cells back as an added bonus,
---
delusional survivor only players.. ok
---
where's the ttv
---
I was just telling a friend how I was thinking they were going to make it for the 30th. Myers and Laurie‚Äôs cosmetics were scheduled for that day, and without an update they would miss out on those cosmetics. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not the reason why this update is coming out, but that was my thought process behind it. I‚Äôm just glad we‚Äôre at least receiving it before the month ends.
---
Me laughing because I‚Äôm a old Fred main this could happen if you were good as Freddy back then
---
Sorry mate

If a community manager is only engaging with people who don¬¥t criticize the game then he is not a great community manager. lol

hatch wasnt closed tho he had pwyf sloppy and pop
---
Dude i never noticed that i might have to draw a ship of them
---
Claudette definitely is the strongest for blend potential, but that kind of dies off at the high ranks where sound matters even more. Check my comment below for Otz's video

For your liking: https://youtu.be/4sqYEmAy9Dg

Completely disagree with your final point. Freddy‚Äôs change was absolutely needed, this sub was begging for it, and now everybody looks back on it with rose tinted glasses. He was absolutely awful. Waiting seven seconds to hit a survivor meant nobody feared you. Gens got done and hexes broke right in your face. His time delay meant that he was basically forced to tunnel because not only did he have to wait, but he had no help in chases. I good looper would absolutely destroy him. 
---
He was straight up bad. Basic M1 killer with literally no benefits. He was handicapped by his power more than he benefited from it. Having all survivors asleep at once was borderline impossible with how easy it was to wake up, meaning you could potentially have to wait yet again to hit someone if they self care at a safe pallet. 
---
I main Freddy, and have since his release. I understand it wasn‚Äôt impossible to do good with him, but it was rage inducing. He sucked ass. He‚Äôs great now. Anybody clamoring for old Freddy honestly has no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. He was the worst killer *by far*.
---
Yeah
---
Nice. Keep me posted
---
Haha jk...
---
...unless?
---
Hell yeah great news unlike many others I was willing to be patient
---
Forgive me sir
---
Don‚Äôt worry the event is tomorrow 11:30
---
It's in the game already. It's beckoning.
---
As happy as a Pig in shit.
---
Ah yea, we also have a Hillbilly AND a Bubba so why pull that out. And It could be fun, if done right Imo
---
cause self caring the whole game loses games. its a huge waste of time. theres nothing more annoying than watching a survivor waste all the pallets and self care the whole game. bring a med kit or find someone to heal you, just my 2 cents , self care all you want if thats what you like .
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
It's just 3 gen doc but with slowdown rather than skillchecks. Just completely unfun to play against.
---

I dont see anything special except of a NOED nurse.
---
oh my god i cannot unsee these three survivors in this scenario again
---
brings me back to old sabo days
---
&gt; **planned**
---
Don't you dare
---
Definitely just use BBQ, doctor is good at farming BP in general because of all the shocking you end up doing.  Ruin is definitely good and used on most people, and other than that, nurse has 2 of the other perks in this build, while sloppy butcher is just on every killer by default.
---
Im currently using freddy to farm blood points for nurse, with BBQ i normally get 60+ and spend them on nurse. Only played her 3 times and she is level 37
---
What does the Meg mask mean?
---
Not for switch #rip
---
Yea. Honestly really any other support perk is better than solidarity. A good replacement if you don‚Äôt want BT is Botany Knowledge. I run the build you have but with Botany Knowledge. A great perk for supporting.
---
Better together is awesome. I can't tell you how many times someone wanders up to my gen out of nowhere. I think the secondary aspect of seeing all auras when someone is downed is really underrated too.
---
All I want is for Look-See to become a playable killer.
---
Awwww This is lovely, I'm excited again now!

I don't own The Plague either for Corrupt Intervention so I hope Ruin is the better of the two perks.

Lucky that most of the perks are non DLC friendly.

Gotcha, so i can buy the auric cells tonight and simply purchase it on release?

Fine ill make it for u

Wraith is worse

Shrug. I don‚Äôt think any perks are toxic. People who shit talk just to be pricks and DC are toxic. People who will hold matches hostage by just crouching from locker to locker. Perks though? Nah. Dead Hard/DS me, I‚Äôm still gonna getcha.
---
Thanks, really helpfull, he's my favourite killer.
---
Loved the part of being scary hahaha, thats importan information
---
These camping, tunnelling killer usually plays Blendette when playing survivors. Go figure.
---
The lamb of god did not come to be served, but to serve.
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
---
Let me guess your a pig main
---
I never go for grabs but I really should
---
Yes but each level gets progressively more difficult so you'd want to wait until the end of season to decide on buying tiers
---
Unless you go against bad survivors
---
I'm sorry, but Adrenaline has come in handy on way, way too many situations for me to exclude it from my builds.
---
That said, I absolutely love Bond and Prove Thyself for support builds. I want to see where you are to help you, but also to help me get the hell out of dodge when I need to. And if I can make us faster on gens, great!
---
Who can resist that stun noise
---
I Play Ghost Face and if you like sneaking on Survivor i eoukd recomend hon. I havet granved a lot of People. You realy don't bred add-ons
---
I've had this happen once some time ago but we were playing against a Trapper. I could see him in 3rd person too.
---
Only happened once though. It's probably some rare obscure bug.
---
hmm, I'd say the most common killer perks are probably BBQ and Ruin but they change a lot depending on rank. At low ranks you can pretty much run whatever build you want but at high ranks you typically just see BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury. The most meta survivor perks are probably DS, Adrenaline and Balanced Landing, but there's more flexibility when it comes to survivor loadouts (I'd recommend always bring an exhaustion perk to help in chases like Dead Hard, Balanced Landing or Lithe)
---
For sure. It‚Äôs a good perk just bad numbers sadly. Wish they would buff it or over heal you for the next time you are injured
---
Take A WILD guess
---
When I picked him up I noticed there were no guides to him so I made this once I got good
---
Me even thought i main piggy and leatherface
---
#ThanksgivingEvent
---
I don't even like Adam but i feel bad for him
---
üò¥
---
Two killers who deserve so much better. I‚Äôll probably end up buying Bubba eventually
---
YOOO that‚Äôs good! For you guys... I don‚Äôt get it... üò¢üòî
---
Any Killer is good against those
---
Hes amazing in lower teir but he is medium in mid to high teir
---
15 more minutes guys!! Here we go!
---
Now self care just flat out is a bad perk, I would say. Functions as kind of a noob trap. It just takes too much time to heal with it, you might as well run somewhere and find another survivor to heal you instead. For example pick Empathy or Bond instead and meet up with someone to heal each other. So much time saved.
---
I'd say it depends, but I think ruin has more potential while corrupt has more consistency.  Obviously really good survivors can still hit ruin skill checks, but even then it negates the normal bonus progression from it.  Corrupt just blocks off the 3 furthest gens for 180 seconds.  This is nice because you guarantee most of the time that you can find people without gens popping, and you get 3 full minutes of it, whereas ruin can sometimes be broken instantly because a survivor spawns on it.
---
This is good lmao. Teaching someone new how to play is exhausting, but rewarding.
---
Yea I looked through this sub a bit for The Plague and saw mostly negative stuff about it, I don‚Äôt tend to judge stuff on bad reviews though because I usually like the things others seem to not lol! And I‚Äôve noticed the Spirit hate but I love her design and she looks pretty fun to play. I can only afford one so I‚Äôve narrowed it down to The Spirit and The Plague
---
So, you attribute intrinsic value based on length of membership and "karma".
---
Wow, very Libtarded if you to make up your own rules by which you demonize others.
---
Oh, hey, your hair is brown and your eyes are green...dafuq you know?
---
Furthermore, I give 2 monkey fucks about your ridiculous interwebz "karma "...all you posers do is suck each other's cocks in a big circle because you're all desperate for life validation.
---
"Oh, LIKE me, someone...LIKE ME.  Pay attention to ME and tell me how great I am".
---
It's fucking PATHETIC.
---
Just like YOU.
---
How would you teamkill lol
---
He can definitely be a beast in the right hands. I‚Äôve only been able to played him through the Splinters, sadly
---
It‚Äôs 7 gen Freddy because no survivor wants to do gens
---
nope. new freddy is pretty good, demogorgon is good too. legion is fun but he sucks. everyone else is just kinda there
---
new cosmetics
---
Clown has bamboozle and pop if u haven't bought it this week, it ends in 10 minutes if u haven't, plague has corrupt intervention. Thats about it afaik Freddy/legion/demi all have shit or mediorce perks.
---
Yup.
---
Double BP, plus archives and rift.
---
Yhea but pig on the other hand has a secretm ill tell yhea if didnt know if you put a trap on someone's head and put them in basement you can bodyblock and once a gen is done you wait for their timer to go down
---
Lol u right
---
Get Pop Goes the Weasel from the shrine before it resets in ten minutes if you have the spare shards. It‚Äôs one of the best perks in the game and comes with Clown so you won‚Äôt need to buy Clown yet. Out of the killers you listed Freddy is the best.
---
what‚Äôs exposing the survivors?
---
There‚Äôs no double BP.
---
Well make it is an A tier perk, dont @ me
---
Nah thats when I switch to a tryhard build
---
Autodidact is not very useful but really fun
---
this also applies to killer ngl on my huntress i run iron grasp, huntresses lullaby, monstrous shrine, and unrelenting yeah they might get a few gens done but when i got lullaby and 5 tokens and 2 guys in the basement who is laughing now ?
---
Alexander Shunnarah is having a fit right now:
---
1. He is about to have tons of new clients.
---
2. He‚Äôs planning to buy out that billboard.
---
Quentin is just tired tho.
---
Never thought about that. I‚Äôll have to try it sometime. Thanks!
---
Yes but wraith is actually usable unlike trapper
---
I only saw the "hit a second time in feral frenzy" part, missed the exposed but i assume it means the bleedout timer
---
I‚Äôm happy the devs got it in time for Halloween but I fear the appreciation for that will overshadow the fact they let this happen in the first place.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really do think the devs are great for working to get it out on Halloween, but let‚Äôs not forget they made a mistake that got us here. Mistakes happen, it‚Äôs understandable, but it happens too much with BHVR imo.
---
I just started 3 days ago and have 8 hours of game play according to steam and have only had one issue, which was a Ghostface tea bagging me. The chat, even post-game chat, seems nice so far. I'm only at rank 16 though, and I'm hoping I don't experience the toxicity everyone is talking about.
---
Are you sure? Do you have a source ? Because Jumpscare Myer is my favorite build in the game but it sucks that I have to take Monitor, you will have a 0 terror radius without monitor?
---
It is, it's just not part of the meta. Most of DbD's meta revolves around self-sufficiency and Killer time wasting. Adrenaline, DS, BT, and DH are all basically the embodiment of those two traits.
---
Its not good on swf thought cause they can just 99 every gen but hey its usefull sometimes
---
I wouldn't even say the other perks are weak on itself, it's just that killers stomp everything that's not helping you in a chase.
---
It‚Äôs coming out tomorrow which is a day before Halloween so it‚Äôs still a Halloween event technically
---
True, I just wish there was more variety
---
Haha entitled survivors haha funny and original hahahahahha
---
I‚Äôve actually had better luck with not going up against large SWF groups lately
---
My meta perks involve Windows of Opportunity. It‚Äôs just a great perk for creating chase paths in your head.
---
I felt this on a spiritual level.
---
Wait, really?
---
yeah, if you just hit a survivor in frenzy two times to down them, legion would just stack frenzy cooldowns ahhaha.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and Switch so as happy as I am I feel pain too. 
---
On the bright side when we eventually get it it‚Äôll be even less buggy as they‚Äôll have had more time to iron out bugs!
---
2 killers and 8 survivors would be fun, although I feel like the objective should be different from generators
---
aaaaaaAAA archives!! I love the halloween event as much as the next guy, but GOD I have been waiting on the archives for so long! ee!
---
The update will include cake.
---
Ok boomer
---
Yes, playing the game.
---
Grabbed Pop before it changed, thanks for that.
---
IF you‚Äôre lucky
---
Grabbed Pop from the shrine, thank you.
---
Same here! I can‚Äôt wait for the extra BP opportunities and free cosmetics!!
---
Seems accurate
---
No one fixed your issue because you're still here crying about not being able to play. You just heard someone say what you wanted to hear.
---
Lithe being better than Dead Hard LMAO
---
You crazy Canadian sons of bitches, you‚Äôve done it again!
---
i mean if you drowned you would probably be afraid of water too
---
Lol I'ma get downvoted for this but once I was paired with this annoying survivor team, so at the end of the match I bodyblocked the exit gate handle and was the only one to escape xD. We eventually made up though
---
 For me it‚Äôs killer dailies when I‚Äôm a survivor main
---
Play Dr with bbq, distressing, unnerving presence, and something of your choice for the fourth. Use a "calm" add on and you get 60k points a game almost guaranteed. It'll take some getting used to but it's crazy points.
---
An xenomorph would make a pretty cool killer too
---
For me its survivor or trapper dailies
---
So you‚Äôve gone from saying that I don‚Äôt accept help from anyone to saying that I only accept help from people who tell me what I want to hear? My issue isn‚Äôt fixed and can‚Äôt be fixed but people have given me advice on how I can play the game.
---
No? Where did you get that from?
---
Actual boomer moment

"Updated certain Killer powers with the Undetectable status effect: The Shape in Tier I of Evil Within, The Pig while in crouch mode, The Wraith while Cloaked, The Ghost Face while in Night Shroud."
---
They release the patch notes the same day?
---
Is it?
---
Nobody nontoxic spends real human money on a Jake cosmetic
---
I had a game against a Spirit (without ads-ons) where two people DCed immediately. She then helped me find chests in the map :))
---
I'm from Australia, it's still not coming out in November for me :(
---
Calm spirit,calm spirit,calm spirit, and calm spirit
