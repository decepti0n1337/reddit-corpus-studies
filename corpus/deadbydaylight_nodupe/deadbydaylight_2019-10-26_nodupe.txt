This is the bgs?

---
This reminds me of a card art for a god in Smite.
---
Thank you! I'm glad that you enjoy it!
---
Just let him pretend
---
Any chance you could actually provide a real quote instead of inciting people with your rumor?
---
Dude that looks sick as hell! Tell your GF that she did a damn good job!
---
I would play killier for my achievements
---
Why do you post this twice? The only change you did was cut a little bit of the screenshot
---
Lol poor Myers always being bullied in these panels
---
I only have played Survivor,  but watch my son play Killer most of the time. This helps me play Survivor better....or try to anyway
---
Yeah, I do it as a blanket policy with a similar mindset. Depriving the other side of a GG cause you feel they didn't do well enough seems a bit absurd to me.
---
I made the mistake of doing a degree in Games Development and in our final project updating the engine caused some issues, and other times you'd save the build fine, open it up again and suddenly bugs appeared that weren't there before.  As for the Certification, they've to send it to sony/microsoft/nintendo for their releases as  they want all releases at the same time. Shit happens and bugs appear with no reason as to why (The Wake Up! wasn't even changed in the patch it became bugged).   
---
Love the game when i look past the game-play issues. However I'm not a fan of BHVR's game play choices but what can you do. 
---

---
People are saying the devs are making comments, chances are they're gonna annoyed by personal messages or back-to-back hateful comments about it. But like people said, BHVR have so many issues so frequently that its just one giant annoyance when its something people were so hyped for and the preview video. :(
---
Least they're postponing it and its not gonna take away from it in the end, plus it gives people the chance to play other Halloween Events in other games instead of forcing themselves to play DBD, it's not your normal Halloween event so can still work? I love Halloween themed stuff so for me personally it'll just extend it after other games stop their events. \\o/   
---
Hopefully next year they'll focus on game-play and fixes as oppose to just more stupid DLC that'll saturate the game even more
---
Whenever I play pretty much
---
More often then survivor
---
Could still be possible if they release it for PC immediately once it's ready to go. I see no need to make PC wait weeks for absolutely zero reason.
---
You and me both lmao I was just legitimately wondering because I haven't used ds since the change and it actually looks like they made the skillcheck larger. I was just comparing it to how brand new part looks or overcharge
---
I guess people around here are just survivor mains, because if they played both sides they would know how it feels like to play against 2 needles and they wouldn't downvote you.
---
[removed]
---
This reminds me of Winnie the Pooh a bit.
---
You can go to their official forums and see the dev posts for those answers, and the answers are they're fine. The idea that people had where dedicated servers were going to magically fix the problems that came with p2p has, as expected, been completely wrong, since the majority of the community has no understanding of how servers actually work. 
---
The only thing that's really different is how noticeable some of the lag that you never saw as a 0ms host can be when you play killer, or you load into a further away server as a killer and your game is a bit stuttery. Anything else is basically the way the vast majority of games work with movement and lag comp, which makes it seem like you have a massive hitbox when you simply do not, or that you think the killer isn't in lunge range because it's a clown with a knife, who has the same lunge range as a billy with a much longer weapon. Or it's simply due to people not realizing their own ping to the server, or their own internet being shit. 
---
Before it was your ping to a 0ms host, so it was only calculating the lag to you and the host, but now it's a server calculating the lag to the killer and the survivor to the host that is the server, and this is made worse if you have a killer at say, 130ms ping to the server, while the survivor has 30ms ping - it means the killer is a lot closer to you than you realize and you will get tagged in a way that appears "laggy" simply due to the closeness of the two individuals and how quickly the action of a lunge is. So you could say that dedicated servers are, in a way, worse than peer to peer, for a game like DBD, sometimes.
---
I mean it's the same concept as TF2, where you can get backstabbed by a spy from the front due to the hitboxes of the models being the same as DBD, a large square, and the lag comp basically registering you as being behind the target when you are in front, or back before they updated the tick rate of OW servers and you could get shot behind walls the same as TF2.
---
well okay. You are right. :) I just typed that cause most of the time i play Rank 5-1. I am sorry if that bothers you.
---
lmao expected nothing less.
---
When you napraw
---
r/deadbuddyretard
---
I'm surprised it doesn't exist.
---
The downvote brigades are bad on every subreddit
---
That's why I'm starting to. lol
---
stalking hamburgers
---
Good rule of thumb, always let the losing side to be the first to say GG
---
After all, everyone knows that will drop the ebony mori prices in the player marketplace!
---
Rarely I’m a survivor main that’s hoping to get all my survivors to prestige 3 then I’ll work on getting killers achievements and then prestige 3. Then I’ll basically only play for daily or for the archives.
---
Wow you want to ban something that someone put time and effort into doing just cause some guy posted a legion cosplay that’s garbage ironically.
---
I really don’t agree with this cause although Ryan is on PornHub, part of his gimmick is that he does not do porn. Otz on the other hand plays dbd and is really good at it
---
Not even they know. They mentioned that they fixed many of the game breaking ones but then it all needs to be certified which usually takes a few days so yeah, no one knows
---
Is the entire criteria of whether or not it's a good game to you whether or not you perform well?
---
We're all (supposedly) playing this game because it is fun. If you lose do you not have fun? Do you not look at it as a potential learning experience?
---
Let me not be so vague though, because the issue isnt just a loss. The issue is that you feel like it isn't a good game if you get stomped and lose. Why not? Are you frustrated? And again, do you not look at it as a learning experience? Otherwise, did you not have fun? All of those issues are on you. Literally the only issue is you. 
---
If everyone played a fair game, it was a good game. If it wasn't a good game but everyone played fair, the issue is you.
---
They fucked it up bro
---
Bold of you to assume that those words will stop him
---
So like when unhooking stay close to the hooked survivor?
---
Aw, well, they fan take their time, a delayed update is good and satisfactory and a rushed one is unplayable
---
Bring the hair down a bit more, looks like its been brushed you know? Use the hair to obscure the pigs forehead a bit more and try and add some mud or blood.
---
FUCK.
---
As a Myers main... 
---
#ouchie
---
Staunch: Blood pools disappear slightly/moderately/considerably faster
---
Tacky Coating: Unhooking takes 5/10/15% longer. Does not affect basement hooks
---
Let’s make this an actual meme format
---
I really like the idea of not having to switch modes. Or they can just take off the charge time to switch into treatment mode.
---
because it's a lot of work to do five completely unique skins. chances are they just budgeted for time.
---
The original survivors also all got blight skins...  
---
Except Meg for some reason.
---
The stun time when being shocked and they cannot perform actions lasts 4 seconds. 
---
New add-ons or tweaked add-ons that reduce the time to charge.
---
Fake pallets become a base ability.
---
Done. Instantly high tier.
---
I want a Battle Royal esq version of DBD with like 20 surviors and 5 killers in a HUGE map, and like 30 gens need to be done.
---
Of course BHVR has the competency of a parayalzed Alzheimers patient, so this will never happen... But I can dream dammit
---
Why is the doc being reworked? Why would he?
---
I was using a voice to text feature on my phone and like all voice to text use it makes mistakes like that extremely easily and I either don't catch them or I just don't waste time correcting them most of the time
---
Yeah what's up with that? I get budgeting and all but why leave just ONE out?
---
Lets be honest, if bill wasn't playing along, the entity and all the killers would be destroyed without mercy, and the survivors free
---
yess, ive let myself go over the years (midnight munchies anyone?) Tryna get some steps in 😉
---
They didn't even get Bruce to voice him in that.
---
Nice!
---
I main survivor but the few times I play killer this always happens to me
---
oh yeah, definitely gonna be messing the hair up more when i have someone take photos of the finished costume for me. mostly just wanted it out of the way for this one since i was already having a lot of trouble seeing without my glasses
---
Gg ez git gud baby killer, go cry bout it.
---
That was me when I got mori’d for the first time.. I literally yelled at my fiancé to come here.. and was like THE KILLER JUST KILLED ME WITHOUT EVEN HOOKING ME? CAN THEY DO THAT??
---
There is literally a blood hunt event planned for Halloween my god do people not keep up with leaksbydaylight
---
I think people are just mostly annoyed cause their excited. I know I am sure as shit excited and was just saddened it got delayed. It's nice to know it's coming and getting put altogether. 
---
Still holding out for the day they break Clown's gut physics, plz BHVR just one patch!
---
&gt;If everyone played a fair game, it was a good game. If it wasn't a good game but everyone played fair, the issue is you.
---
That's the thing though. Almost none of these games are fair. It doesn't matter how everyone plays, fair or not. With the matchmaking in this game, rank 15s go against rank 5s. Getting eviscerated 2 minutes into the match is not fun for anyone. There's nothing to learn, it's not fun getting slaughtered and not being able to do anything about it.  
---
Also, if the killer or survivors didn't play fair, that's not a good game for anyone on the receiving end.  If a killer tunnels someone immediately into the match or facecamps, but says gg at the end, do you really think they mean it? There are plenty of situations where "gg" just feels inappropriate and instead just feels like the winner being a sore one.
---
Seriously! That’s look awesome and cute!!! 🥰
---
I could care less that it’s let, if there’s a huge issue people would complain ever more.
---
*yawn*
---
This is what I hate about this sub. Survivors admits to DCing, tbagging, etc? Downvoted. Killer admits to DCing against SWF or BMing? Not downvoted.
---
Christmas\*
---
BHVR: I hope you like Halloween and Christmas!
---
Spireh
---
Honestly, I don't even fucking care about dedicated servers at this point. They have shown nothing but failures for how long they have been working on it. What was it? 1, 2 years?
---
Did it give you all those shards tho?
---
The nerfs are too much, like Legion’s nerfs and Old!Freddy’s nerfs. It’s been quite a long time, but the complaints are valid. Oink oink.
---
With stbfl, it's 2 more hits
---
I think he meant for headon to not share a cooldown with exhaustion perks. Like make it have a separate cooldown like other perks (quick and quite, premonition..etc)
---
I don't think it is too late to implement. I'm pretty positive that even though they don't show it, things like kills, escapes, hook rescues etc are tracked. Maybe they do track who you play on average as well.
---
I had a feeling you would say that.
---
The criteria of "fair" is subjective. My definition is pretty broad; so long as you arent explicitely and intentionally cheating/exploiting the system it's fair. The rest is just the game.
---
If you have issues with the game itself, that's fine. It's good to have criticisms so that the game can become the best version of itself. That being said, it isn't really the players fault if the rules of the game are bad.
---
I'm not even saying you have to say GG. I get it, sometimes games can be frustrating, and this game surely is a top contender. But if you are genuinely getting mad at someone else for simply enjoying the game or, better yet, just trying to be polite, honestly the problem is you.

I don't think he means anything by it. I think its more of just an auto-response for him.

No

Don't know

I don't play bubba
---
Farming
---
Franklins only works with M1s, 25 sacrifices for each of the 4 original survivors only.  I have no clue and speed limiter FOR MEMES
---
They could've made a blightskin that was all of them combined via the nectar though.
---
How much I would pay for these meaty ass men to mori me.
---
You playing fortnite made you lose all credibility and makes me think your a whiny little brat who can’t be patient. Game design is fucking hard when bugs or errors come up Devs have to go back and track what code is causing the error  and try multiple ways to try and fix it Sometimes it can take weeks or months to fix major issues.
---
Honestly same. I used to dominate in revolution but I can't get into the more mainline civ games
---
thank you! definitely still a wip although my main focus right now is the outfit and blade since those are the things i made myself. the mask i'm a little bit afraid to mess with because i did buy it and it's a little on the expensive side, but i could definitely see about making it a little dirtier.
---
So strong dudes support the devs and skinny dudes are upset? I'm not sure what you mean here.
---
I’m really excited too- but honestly? I can wait a couple of weeks.
---
Cause you don’t really see any part of them, the blight for killers wears down their body it seems, while legion is usually fully covered head to toe.  Nurse doesn’t have a blight skin either, for the same reason I’d assume
---
They are moving the start and end days you will still get the correct amount of days to finish the event.
---
She does, in the battle pass she's getting one
---
Exactly, everyone who's complaining are just entitled children
---
hehehehehehgdiwhgeg shirtless myers LOL
---
Shit I wish
---
Nurse has a blight skin in the battle pass
---
👌
---
Outer World looks tempting right about now. Death  Stranding is coming out soon too.
---
Cooool
---
*Laughs in upside-down*
---
Yeah but them resurfacing now? Devs have said they reuse old assets.
---
Wow ok
---
The stun time definitely needs upgrading, and I LOVE the fake pallets being part of his base kit.
---
To be fair that's enough time for half the gens to be done
---
"Aunt Hag, can I have some more candy?"
---
"Sure sweetie, here."
---
The Halloween event’s system itself is tied to the Rift. I think it’s earning a type of currency for Rift progression or something akin to that.
---
Why does her right leg look like it doesn’t connect?
---
&gt; i can't believe that he'd sit by and not try to fight back.
---
Why? Its literally what he tries to do in everything he is in. Ash is a massive coward with a big ego. His first step is always to try and run away from the problem instead of fighting it. And when he does fight it, he never really does very well until the very last moment where he wins almost always by just being more durable than whatever he is fighting.
---
ded ahd
---
It's not about the context, it's about sending a message.
---
One of the most counterable items? I dunno, could be worse. Maybe a buff to lightborn would be in order though.
---
Agreed but then I suppose if you don’t instantly die on hook the killer will 100% know you have it and camp you, then if they know what they’re doing they’ll just slug and wait for ds to run out
---
You're really underestimating the Principle of Least Effort, if there's a minor inconvenience that already a huge deterrent, add that to the social element of no one wanting to queue with you if it means waiting 20 minutes for a game and players wont really want to quit games as often as you perceive such, afking is still a reportable offense and Riot does way more about it (even if its not a lot) than beHaviour with reports. Queue timers also are bad if youre planning to binge ranked, since higher ranks have to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a game, waiting it a whole hour just to play isn't really somehting people would opt into.
---
DBD has no disincentive to quitting, and alt f4 is way easier than just holding m1 and not struggling, so Least Effort doesn't deter anyone.
---
I'm not getting mad at anyone, I couldn't give a shit less. I just don't see how a match that isn't fun at all could be considered a good game by either side. I don't see it as polite, so I don't care what your intentions are. A large amount of the time (in my experience) gg is only ever said by the side which plays incredibly toxic and then tries to bait me into sending them salt messages. 
---
Also, it might be a difference of definitions when it comes to gg. That doesn't make me wrong. 
---
If I don't enjoy a match, which isn't most games mind you, I'm not gonna consider it a gg. The other side coming in and saying that just feels like an extra sting to a shitty match that already felt like shit.
---
This isn't even comparable even if I am one of the ones who fault BHVR for this (Mostly because Dedicated Servers are still fucking up despite completely making some killers unplayable like Myers). Fallout 1st is completely malicious and unethical attempt at milking their gullible player base, this delay is because they gave themselves too harsh of a deadline and apparently it somehow doesn't pass their QA despite dedicated servers being A-OK to be forced onto the player base
---
All of those Dwight type nerds are gonna come after you.
---
Considering her traps are complete rng, her stealth makes her move at glacial paces, and her dash can only be used in super tight loops and even then survivors with a brain know to just keep running, I stand by my opinion that she sucks.
---
Which fucking nerf? There's been like 6 of them? @BVHR's headass for taking a good killer and killing their chances.
---
If you cant give a shit less then what is the issue?
---
Hillbilly doesn't need eyes, confirmed.
---
Well coordinated survivahz
---
Which is funny because this stuff isn't big. At all. People love to complain though
---
Viable 
---
Coordinated 
---
Billeh 
---
Sneakeh
---
Tbf her dash attack ISN'T a normal attack
---
Majority of players disagree with you, perhaps you have bar experiences playing with her, but because you don’t know how to play her effectively, doesn’t mean she’s bad.
---
Saying GG regardless of win or lose isn’t being a good sport? Huh. Colour me shocked.
---
This looks fking awesome, I am also getting some Darkest Dungeon vibes as well!
---
Speaking of PTB, why do they seem to be so rigid in how they run them? It feels like it's locked in to being two weeks, and I'm pretty certain the most recent ones have only had one build update during them, if that. I understand splitting the player base when it's already small is a major concern, but I can't help but feel like the player base has already been affected much more by the wait for this patch, while keeping the PTB up would have given them more data points to work with and potentially work out these bugs faster.
---
This is probably the CUTEST thing I've seen all week. I'm crying this is so wholesome. I love it!
---
Literally today a nea ran past me while I was on a hook and the killer was across the map 😤
---
Nothing too overpowered, but definitely buffs that could help push his potential a bit further to the right. I like it.
---
a lot of people use gg in a sarcastic manner. if you 4k survivors like it's nothing and say gg afterwards... how's that not provocative. I don't support losing your shit over that statement. It's still petty.
---
He's been having an extremely rough time the past week or two, pretty much every game has been filled with jackasses and he's not able to play any of the fun builds he wants. He's not usually like this, he's just having a bit of a bad time right now.
---
I still got to red ranks with the Pig using the sloppy+nurses+thanatophobia build. It's still very great on her, I agree, its hard,  but I simply enjoy playing her though.
---
I meant I don't view it as an attack from the other person. Just that it doesn't feel good at all, so I don't care for their intentions. You could mean it all well and good, but it's not making anyone feel better about getting destroyed, and rightfully so I'd say.
---
Killer when solo and survivors with friends (obviously duh 😂)
---
I do play a lot more killer tho as my friends and I aren’t always online
---
Perhaps it highlights the gen the survivor translocated to for the killer then.
---
BMing or tbagging a killer who doesn’t deserve it is pretty scummy. Playing killer is already stressful enough, especially at high ranks. But, I don’t see killers being upvoted for DCing during SWF matches. That’s an even more scummy thing to do. I just waste about a minute of some groups time because I’ve been burned too many times by toxic SWF groups.
---
I didn't answer your question? You literally said they dont have a release date, which they had, and as literally every game company, if you want a playerbase, maybe explain why you postponed one of the only events we have the entire year. Also, what i hope they release? I hope they give us an explanation on why every single thing they make is delayed, why they take years to attend small requests of the community and why after all the mistakes they made, they still treat the community like absolute garbage
---
Well, cant say you're wrong
---
Thank you for the awesome new background!
---
But you still pulled it off 👍🏻
---
They didn’t do one this year. Probably because they were working on a lot at the time. Dedicated servers, the rift/archives, preparing for the 3 year livestream event.
---
I think that’s why they gave us 3x bloodpoints and all those 103% cakes to make up for it
---
boop the snoot
---
wake up, resilience, spine chill with someone else's leader to open a gate 55% faster
---
Yeah.. they didn't announced anything about summer event **except** they didn't want to make it to work on dedicated servers..
---
We know how it ended up. As well as the blight event..
---
BHVR is getting too greedy and it's insulting how they respond after this whole year was a mess. A fuck up over another till now
---
The pig is viable
---
Claud you made the game longer that it should have
---
this is getting out of hand, now there are two of them
---
why the fuck are they so conservative about giving us double bp? This game has no true economy,it's one of the grindiest games I've ever played, and the community would only appreciate it. I honestly just don't get their thought process sometimes.
---
It’s happening to basically everyone. It’s such a pain in the ass.
---
Secret neighbor is out and it’s pretty fun. Still needs some more work and polish, though.
---
It's Peanits, what do you expect?
---
He's the most useless, piece of **** I ever met in BHVR. He suck as a mod and as a person, don't take anything seriously from him. Not even 'official statement'. They could as easily be bs
---
You were staring at me and id just stared back like ''Im actually a flower.'' lol
---
peanits straight up told us to give up hope on that because they didn't officially announced it.
---
remember when the store came out and people were excited at the potential for new moris?
---
I prefer playing killer buts it's fun to play survivor with friends
---
I'm not allowed to feel bad about losing? So what? My reaction to getting utterly demolished should be "oh boy man I love playing for 2 minutes and absolutely getting destroyed in a way that isn't satisfying whatsoever at all! Thank you enemy for killing me in a game that I was set up to lose from the start!"?
---
AND become exhausted.
---
So cuteeee
---
oh no that's scummy as fuck. If you wanna farm and everyone is cool with it then it's fine. The fact she got you to get rid of all of the pallets then killed you all without letting you unhook is real scummy. She should have just played normally.
---
The post below yours when setting the feed to “new” will tell you everything that is currently known.
---
Tremendously increase the amount of fog in the trial.
---
Tremendously increase the killers vision through the fog
---
I only play survivor. I've tried killer quite a few times but it's just not my thing.
---
A bell doesn’t make the sound “Google Bong”
---
It is entirely because of Object of Obsession.
---
Your reaction to getting utterly demolished shouldn't be "fuck that guy for being a normal person."
---
Whatever dude, you're clearly dead-set on being a pissy brat. Have fun getting upset, I'll keep having fun enjoying things.
---
AND completely get away from the killer. You clearly don’t play enough of the game to think exhaustion will balance that. You literally can just hide for the remaining exhaustion time and repeat. It’s stupid and an unfair idea. No skill whatsoever.
---
Wtf I'm in the background lmao, I was actually gonna ask the Bill for a photo but he walks real fast.
---
Because he is insanely bad. Hahahahha insanely hahahha no really he sucks.
---
Perhaps the gen they teleported to gets highlighted then.
---
I dont care for the event I just want it fixed as smooth as it was a while back .-.
---
They’re sitting back anyway. Just like they did during the summer :)
---
Depends on add ons, plus it applies slowdown
---
if other people are provocative, I or in this case the targeted group is at fault. alrighty then.
---
She’s got a hip-dip! But I may have gotten a bit too excited about painting that, and it looks a bit off now. Easy fix at least :D
---
New killer?
---
It's just I barely see them get downvoted when they admit to DCing against SWFs. Also tbagging is the only few forms of communication when soloing or when not in voice chat, so it can mean many things.
---
Just so you know, just bming isn't toxic. 
---
BMing = Bad Manners. Think of it as putting your elbows on the table while eating or not sneezing on your arm or hand. It's  just annoying when a person does any of that. In gaming it's a bit different, but the meaning is similar. It can be used as a strategy to tilt someone into targetting you and only you. 
---
 
---
Tilt = Mental or emotional confusion or frustration which may cause someone to play worse. 
---
Toxic = Communication and/or behavior which influences someone to harm themselves AND has no point except to make have an extremely negative emotion.
---
As killer you should just laugh at tbagging and start thinking "Tbagging isn't even bad. Does it matter that I'm being tbagged?" Thinking like that instead of "Oh my fucking god, imagine fucking doing that toxic shit" made me be fine with being BMed unless it's one of those deranking SWFs who did it to bully killers. They make me mad because even if they usually suck, they act like they're gods.
---
I cannot understand 90% of these comments. Did anyone actually bother their hole to read what's happening? The Devs are instituting a newer version of the unreal engine. 
---
They could literally break the entire fucking game if they implement this incorrectly. Saves could be lost, massive widespread crashes. 
---
I think people need to start pulling up their big boy pants and realise the Devs are working their asses off. All this community tends to do it shit on them. 
---
Well done to the DBD Team - the soundest and best call to make. Keep making magic ladies and gentlemen.✨
---
More people purposely use it than you would imagine
---
This guy playing in windowed mode, can't take a screenshot, and post it sideways. Can't expect too much.
---
Alert, it’s really nice seeing the killer every time they break something and I don’t often see it ran
---
But as a side note I’ve always wished we would get a 5th perk but in order to make survivors have a sense of identity it has to be locked to the that characters teachables (and maybe even locked at tier 1.)
---
Same thing for killers
---
one time i ran against survivors with 3 insta heals as ghostface and they got mad why i camped the a survivor when they powered the exit gate and because i camped i managed to get 3 kills, each 1 of them was on their death hook, reading post chat calling me garbage killer was so funny, because they can't accept the fact that 3 of them died even with 3 insta heals.
---
We actually should.. but y'kno, isn't that easy to make it happen
---
Maybe they will be less lazy or hire more competent people than let a couple of apes do the coding
---
Fair enough, thanks.
---
Thanks ♥
---
Those pointy fingers are perfect
---
the hell did he get banned for? Let me guess mods got a itchy ban finger
---
Prayer beads or no?
---
Thats honestly a good point. I must have thought it was ruin myself and then enjoyed the aftermath.
---
Wait. Otz has a doggo?!??!

I must know more
---
Isn't that Zipper and the werewolf from the movie Cursed?
---
Not even 400 hours. Yet you’re saying that teleporting to a gen is balanced “because you get exhausted”. You clearly play this game at a very low level.
---
BETRAYAL!

-Halo

💩
---
I love your art style. well done.
---
Cute joke
---
Should I bring up every noed daily post? Or the daily spirit posts? Maybe the nurse posts too!
---
Come on man, if you're that blind to skip those criticism because you agree with them but remember every other that disagree with you, it's very bias
---
what does this sub and r/guinea pigs have in common?
---
cute pig noises
---
Ngl dey lookin kinna fresh doe 😳😳😳

What on earth is the origin of the hunky men in the picture?

Ps4( Mur_Da_Kiggy) play both survivor and killer rank 11 p1 freddy and 16 lvl 40 claudette and 35 megan looking for swf and kyf wanna practice countering loops and tracking after 1st hit and maby running with survivors that are not complete potatoes
---
Ok but I'd buy this cosmetic
---
I'm not usually one for this art style, but I really like this!   This is great work!!!
---
Why is your water just running
---
You misunderstood. If they're taunting you by all means, they are an asshole. If the game was just played get over it
---
Ok let me try,
---
Decisive Strike should be nerfed so it deactivates when someone else gets hooked.
---
Oh my god what a cute kitty! 😍😍😍
---
Certification doesn't take that long.
---
I really wasnt attacking the game or devs when i posted to twitter. Its just very tiring as a loyal fan when you get a year of mess ups and you dont even get the event that actually was confirmed...
---
 😳 they vibin doe  😳  😳
---
Prestige 2 with all but four perks and 70% of my hours on killer are on pig. Keep trying to justify nerfing an already not good killer if it makes you feel better about yourself.

precious

Thanks! ♥
---
You're trash,  i dont have time to waste for you
---
I need to know if you saw the hatch previously, but still gg.
---
It took them over 2 years to buff freddy, even tho everybody had the same opinion. It took them over 5 months to nerf legion, period on which youtubers and streamers stopped playing. Nurse has been the most controversial killer ever since the beggining, but only now she is seing a rework. Mettle of Man took over 7 months to be nerfed. DS and dribble were an issue for over 12. While i will agree they arent a delay, they can evidence how the devs never listened to the community and when they did, it took them months/years. Also, the dedicated servers are going to be in game since two PTBs ago, but guess what right?
---
Jesus fuck.
---
Pinhead would be 🔥
---
This is a strawman (like that 1gen = 1 pallet. It's just a lie, rewatch the video) and catering to new players for survivors not taking into consideration that also killers can be new too..
---
And ruin
---
Very likely, he is the nicest guy ive met on the whole community
---
I think STBFL still procs on them, since NOED and devour work on the saws as well. Unless it's been changed recently
---
ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
I was legit disappointed to learn that other killers don't him the lullaby when you equip the perk.
---
Hey don't worry, it'll be just like the summer event
---
Paul Blart: Ghost Face
---
Oh, and also, just remembered ghostface was a very bad killer (they reworked him relatively fast, props to them) on his first PTB, so they reworked him and the players were satisfied. Guess what, before the definite version they tweaked him again and now he is one of the laggiest killers
---
BING BONG BING BONG
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
I scrolled so far and finally someone who doesn’t goes “screw the devs!” 
---
I get that they’re disappointed but I think it’s great that they bothered to let players know what caused the delay. 
---
I’ve been playing since launch but whenever the game needs a fix I’ll just play something else and come back later. Seems like I’m the minority on this too.
---
Ngl I thought he was talking about different ash's like the r6 ash.

I feel like as a whole, this gives survivors way too much time to work on gens and stalls things too much for a killer to actually pressure gens.
---
He doesn't say gg when he gets clapped though. This wouldn't be a meme of he always said gg
---
I hate the devs. Or at least, those apes that they call "coders". The design team is great, the mods are scums who should be fired and be banned from the community for how bad they are.
---
Only few are decent, like not_queen and mccote that actually love the game. They may not actually work on it actively but they promotes it and genuinely love the game and I appreciate that but they also have to grow some balls and fire who drag them down
---
I bet there are hundreds of better people who can take the level design, coding and technical parts of their team, easily. They just don't have the gut to fire them, maybe for emotional reasons, but it's taking them down
---
i’ve been trying to write a response without rambling so i’m sorry if this lacks information. to me i think balanced landing is medium tier. i’ve tried it, trust me.. it is way too situational. the speed boost is rarely able to be activated and the stun reduction is really not enough to keep you from getting caught up with. it opens some new looping potentials, i’ll give it that, but the killer will catch up with you anyways. honestly i think more low rank players should be allowed to form opinions on perks without just being told that they don’t know what they’re talking about. some perks are severely underrated. i’ve seen far too many people just running what popular youtubers run because they heard it was good. even worse when they don’t want to try out anything else.
---
When baby dwight and uh... toxic and uh... pig gets nerfed again and then the dc. This is funny right?
---
myers probably went afk out of disappointment of what he is facing.
---
Killers do not rely on slugging tunneling and camping to win. The main problem is how survivor dudes the map is. In an asymmetrical game there’s pretty much no way to achieve balance, but this game is severely survivor sided. Maps like the game, haddonfield, and disturbed Ward are completely broken and not fun for killers. Also some aspects of the game are just unfair. For me what comes to mind are keys and insta heals. I think that to make this game more balanced. Maps need to be fixed, and survivor items need to be nerfed.
---
This is unacceptable because the Devs didn’t cone to my house and explain or to me in an entertaining fashion.
---
What are you even talking about lmao
---
Once again the Dead by Daylight community shows how pathetically entitled and toxic it can be. They fucked up, they updated the engine, which is a big deal, and it caused major issues. 
---
They can't just wave a wand and have everything fixed, and they aren't a team big enough to solve it immediately. BHVR is a small team who out the welfare of their staff above turnover and efficiency by outlawing crunch. This is a very good thing.
---
Nobody wants to wait for an event, but shit happens, and everyone who is sitting here acting as though these people, *actual human beings* not AI who build games for your amusement, are conspiring against you to make sure you don't get your complimentary glowing kneecap for your killer need to take a much more human look at the much bigger picture. 
---
The event will come, the event will not be cut short, and I'm sure something will come our way to apologise for the delay, not that we deserve it with the horrendous attitude so many of our fellow players have shown towards the devs.
---
That's not Ghostface, that's Ghostfat
---
Well, there was a power outage, it just didn't cause them to lose progress like OP was speculating.
---
I know, nitpicky, but an important distinction.
---
I just noticed now i replied to the wrong person, my bad
---
Survivors quit for anything these days since they won't get banned unless they literally DC for half of their games
---
Except that, no. It's not impossible to escape as last survivor, it's obvious you have less chances (unlike pre- end game collapse patch) but you can power it to 15%ish the gates. The lights still off, when the killer patrol again and leave the exit gate takes 10s~ and you're free
---
Bruh why that kid look exactly like me
---
OmegaLUL
---

---
The mobile game has a separate team. I don't know about the second question.
---
Yeah...Doc at the top of the list for once. Horrifying when he shocked the ground around you.
---
You people? Okay buddy
---
I dunno, Ash in The Evil Dead and the first half of Evil Dead 2 is kind of a huge wimp.
---
I don’t think they would it add it to mobile it would be more profitable if they milked it on pc and consoles
---
This community is always at war sadly
---
&gt;the speed boost is rarely able to be activated 
---
if you mean because the perk is situational then yes, that is true. the reason why this perk still reigns superior to the others is because when it can be used, it is extremely useful. the speed boost allows for new looping potentials as you said, and can help you in very specific situations. say ur getting chased and ur injured but u get somewhere high and jump off and get enough movement speed to reach the gate and escape. and of course it will always help with chases.
---
&gt; the stun reduction is really not enough to keep you from getting caught up with.  
---
it depends on how close the killer is to you. the stun reduction is good because in some scenarios, your only way of escaping is to jump down. without BA, that will be a secured hit for the killer. the stun reduction greatly helps keeping chases going for longer. i guess that depends on your experiences though. for me personally it has helped a lot
---
&gt; i’ve seen far too many people just running what popular youtubers run because they heard it was good. even worse when they don’t want to try out anything else. 
---
well, most YouTubers run these perks because they are some of the best and valuable perks in the game. being too afraid to try out other perks is pathetic, but you cant blame people for running what is best. DS, BA, BT, Adrenaline &amp; more are some, if not *the*, of the best perks in the game. thats why YouTubers run them and its why others run them too. im sure people would copy YouTubers even if they didnt use meta perks though, but oh well.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
but yeah, like i said. sometimes low-medium rank players will think a perk is bad simply because they dont know how to use it and properly capitalize on it. thats what people mean when they say that those people dont know what theyre talking about. of course people can have preferences but in the end, how much you like using a perk comes down to personal preferences as well as whether ur skillful/clever enough to know how to capitalize on its abilities
---
I wouldn't mind Hex:Ruin --&gt; Ruin if they made the skill check a little bigger or a smaller regression penalty for missed skillchecks
---
Thank you, at least I'm not the only one. Prepare for a tidal wave of downvoting, angry comments, and being accused of getting paid to suck their dicks though. This warning coming from personal experience literally an hour or so ago when I made a single comment that the community is impossible to please 
---
But at least theres one other civilized human being in this cesspool of a subreddit 👍
---
Her design. I loved her since her launch and played her since, even when she was kinda meh
---
She can be even F tier for all I care, I like they actually made a good Japanese style killer with that jap-horror vibe that I love. The designer teams did a really good job, like they did for huntress, the best two original killers they made so far
---
She's fun to play and I'm a bitch for design. If something look nice and is on point about style, environment and lorewise (Japanese clothes in this case as well integration of the sword) I'm in
---
That's why I love her and i love Huntress too. For the same reasons. Can't help it to actually sing along with huntress while playing her for the same reasons, she has a vibe of her own as well giving that nice atmosphere of fear and peace at the same time
---
Then everything is kinda ruined by the game itself when a insta heal survivor just show you a middle finger but can't have everything can we?
---
Ps: also can enjoy both as survivor too for the same reasons, mostly when I face a good huntress that can hit from the other side of the map
---
Tldr: she looks cool like the huntress
---
i been hearing mix reviews about it and ppl getting board pretty fast with it. hopfully it does get better ik id prob buy it on ps4
---
Doing gens, you?
---
It surprise me it wasn't a Feng. We are kinda dickish with mates, for good reasons
---
Hey, you actually took time to look for it!
---
Hey, the pay is good and the dick is easy.
---
Seriously though, people need to grow up, it's only a game, why they have to be mad?
---
Yeah but Battlefront 2 still has skins that are buyable with MTX's. BF2 is also a bit of a special case because it's community is quite adamant about supporting the game as well as dedicated and so they can afford to have relatively long dev time for things compared to other live service games.
---
To show you what I mean, The time between Geonosis+obi wan+grievous till the next major map and heroes was 4 months and the map we got was largely just a remake of the map we got 4 months ago (not saying that's a bad thing because I enjoyed it when it came out.) But by comparison, DbD releases a new killer, new survivor, and brand new map roughly every 3 months with a smaller content update in between.
---
The Battlefront 2 equivalent would be if we got Geonosis+obi wan+grievous, then 1.5 months later we got Capital Supremacy, and then 1.5 months later we got Felucia+Anakin+Dooku.
---
I wouldn’t think so they have other stuff planned after this such as the new chapter 14
---
The problem is less that the game isn't balanced (I'd say that the top tier killers vs good survivors are actually right where the game needs to be; edge to the Killer while not being unbeatable one on one. Only Nurse and to a lesser extent Spirit break this), it's that Killer requires so many band aid fixes that build diversity suffers, and lower rank killers have to sweat their balls off in order to compete.
---
- Generators get done too fast, requiring Ruin to be run to the exclusion of all else. If you take Ruin, you either slow down or stop Generators completely, and that's the most powerful thing you can ask for a perk slot. A vast majority of Killers would rather gens just be slower (100-120 seconds to complete per) and Ruin removed entirely.
---
- The second problem is just how disgustingly bad a majority of perks (Killer and Survivor) are. A lot of them are perks to counter certain strategies (Hangman's Trick to name one) but you have no idea if you're going against that strategy in the first place. It doesn't help that if you don't want to play certain killers (Huntress, Wraith, Plague, Demo) you don't want to level them up because their perks are that bad. A lot of perks just flat out aren't interesting or shouldn't be in the game due to how niche they are.
---
- Killers are balanced/based around add-ons, and that kind of sucks. Plague, Wraith, Doctor, Trapper, if you don't have the good add-ons, you might as well not even play them. Myers has two of his major playstyles bp gated behind Ultra Rare, which means wanting to play those builds is a slog. Then you have certain killers (Pig, Clown, Wraith) who have maybe one or two good add-ons and the rest are garbage, which kills build diversity and again, makes it where if you don't have those certain add-ons there's no point in bothering.
---
Hag, Huntress, Freddy, Billy, Ghostface, and Spirit are where they need to be. They are fun and effective to play, and you actually feel like you have the upper hand against Survivors while not being dominating against them. The rest either need to be brought down (Nurse) or brought up (Everyone else) in a way that feels fun to play and balanced to go up against.
---
He got banned? That's odd. He was a bit pushy about bringing Legion buff requests into \*everything\* but he never broke any rules or tried to start fights.  
---
Honestly I wish that the devs didn't delete the offending posts on the forums and instead just marked them as the reason for a ban. That way people would know what to avoid. (Though I guess that might be "naming and shaming" as if the fucking jail bars they put on people aren't)

Same been playing since launch on PC. Yeah it's strange to me. I love the passion, but the anger is misplaced.
---
This community is definitely one of the most toxic ones I’ve seen. A lot of times I see neutral comments but a different opinion from the majority gets downvoted for no reason. 
---
I thought we just got a double BP event not long ago and people are asking for double BP again. Seeing all these hate kind of affects me, think I’m just gonna leave this sub.
---
I play solo queue and I still think that killer is extremely underpowered. Also the game has q ton of extremely safe pallets and if you ever play high rank killer on disturbed ward you’d understand why it’s completely broken
---
Well if all your able to use are ad hominems, I don't consider my idea to be bad. Because your not even pointing out what's wrong with it.
---
No and no. I have no idea where you got those ideas.
---
There's no way that first guy can actually press less then 3 buttons at a time
---
Thank god I'm a David main. Represents my real self.
---
I'd like to say thank you for your transparency, honesty and dedication to release things you are happy with.
---
It's refreshing to have such a communicable dev team that puts so much effort into keeping a game updated, and releasing so much content for a game that's nearly 4 years old.
---
I can't imagine what it would be like to work on such a big game with a lot of hard coding and developments and having a community like this can be a challenge as well.
---
I get that it sucks that it's coming out late, but you guys would be up in arms if they released a patch that was really broken. I personally much rather waiting a bit longer and having a way better game experience than a buggy mess.
---
Have some patience, appreciation and respect.
---
i think ppl do have the right to be upset but I do agree it is sorta out of hand. only thing that bothers me is they thought it was a good idea to tie the Halloween event with this update since this update is very big. they should have just made the Halloween event like last year and leave archive as its own thing but that is my opinion. but we will get it sooner or later just a disappointment it will prob be after Halloween
---
There's some nice stuff here, don't get me wrong, but the level of vitriolic hatred towards the people who make the game that occupies their time is disgusting.
---

You are missing the point. The important part isnt the delay, its them not listening to the community and not even caring. I even said it, you are right, from what i remember they only formally anounced and delayed two things, this and the servers.
---
It's a question .. I'm glad I got answered by downvotes wow this community really is toxic
---
Lookin a bit 🍑🍑
---
I've watched him and think he's aight. Not toxic like some people but I don't get why people worship him
---
Thats dumb theres no way saying gg is now bad manners, if youre really paranoid about coming off as smug just add "bl" to the end and comment on the game such as "gg bl about hex being impossible to find, wp anyway"
---
While I can understand where you’re coming from, isn’t Crunch a bad thing? If I remember correctly, Anthem was a victim of crunch.
---
The real issue is when they delay things and it still has the bugs when it does drop. That is the main issue
---
&gt; Myers has still had a hint of the supernatural about him ever since the original film.
---
Not really. Michael Myers is supposed to be a very real threat. The killer that could target anyone at any time without reason or remorse. The most supernatural thing about him in the original movie is that he survived getting shot six times. But that happens often enough in real life that it can just be explained as movie logic instead of supernatural stuff.
---
He is described as unstoppable, unkillable, etc. But a lot of that is due to them retconning his death over and over again because the studios wanted more money. His fate was left spooky and ambiguous in Halloween 1. Carpenter didn't want it explained. It wasn't some curse. He just wanted to leave people guessing. Michael was supposed to actually die at the end of Halloween 2 though. Because in the end The Shape was still just a living person under the mask.
---
Michael himself is supposed to be a mystery. Carpenter described him as an "almost supernatural force". Almost being the operative word there. There isn't supposed to be anything actually supernatural about him. He is just supposed to be terrifying with how much of an evil enigma he is. He ceased to be a man and instead embodies the evil of murder in a metaphorical sense, not a literal sense. Carpenter's inspiration for Michael Myers were real mental patients he saw on a class trip to a mental institution in college.
---
In the latest sequel, which Carpenter himself was executive producer and creative consultant on, they specifically wanted to make him less invulnerable and more enigmatic by having him actually get hurt and not explaining too much about his character like the other sequels and remakes did.
---
Michael was never supposed to be given the Jason Voorhees treatment, but that is what the bad sequels did to him.
---
Gg is basically the same as shaking someone’s hand after a match, it doesn’t matter if it was a blowout or extremely close, if you don’t shake someone’s hand after a match that’s considered unsportsmanlike.
---
Since you can’t shake someone’s hand saying GG is the equivalent.
---
I mean, i got banned from the forums for making hex:cancer... but i cant really imagine him getting banned
---
If I was the killer I would've uninstalled right there
---
I agree with your point on addons.  In my opinion, the whole concept of addons needs to be scapped.  I would rather take an RPG approach to addons.  Allow killers to "spec" into certain builds.  If you want to plan an instand down Huntress, you can, but at a cost.  I don't enjoy that game variety is limited to bloodweb investment and RnG.
---
This looks like if spirit was a contestant on total drama island
---
I'll probably get flak for this, but
---
DUDE. Over at PDX Forums we constantly have to yell at the devs NOT to release buggy messes of patches, and they still keep doing it, across multiple franchises. 
---
Not releasing a crash-riddled patch is, from every perspective but 'I'm entitled to getting anything I want, whenever I want', a pro-consumer move. Why would you demand them to give you any form of compensation on top of already doing the right thing?
---
That's a just plain unhealthy mindset for the entire gaming community.
---
Thanks. Just needed help with a timeframe.
---
I like your looking for a silver lining in such a creative way.
---
Because works.
---
You don't get banned, you make devs notice that and nerf things (you'll see iri heads and spirit nerfs soon. Remember my words) like old Freddy and you punish the killer not making them get BP and emblem points
---
It's a win win win win situation
---
More muscles
---
Why thank you
---
I'd make the survivors the entire bat family but then they wouldn't survive.
---
Play killer to rank 1 a few times on and off over the past year. Looking for a SWF group. I always played solo for about a year on and off. Would like to be in a group. Playing on PS4. Hit me up. For fun or to win. MURD3RWAVE                   P.S as a killer main mostly I don't want to be with or near memeing toxic SWF dipshits or boo boo face DCing cowards. I'm just looking to have fun and want a break babysitting randoms. I guess adult players.
---
You guys are coming off as so entitled. Who the hell cares if the Halloween event doesn't happen before Halloween? It's not like there's a Novemeber event for it to get in the way of.
---
I do agree that the devs shouldn't have even bothered trying to appeal to people by saying "atleast we told you what's going on". Because in the end there's really nothing they can say that will stop the DBD community from shitting on them. It's a god damn video game guys.
---
I mean.. few more steps and they will be the same. Already 80% of content is behind a paywall if you include the upcoming battle pass
---
To me, I think the only thing that would really help things be more consistent at high levels would be to make Ruin a normal perk on a timer, say 3 minutes of up time. It wouldn't win you a game by being up for the whole trial, but it also wouldn't lose you a game by being wiped out in seconds. Otherwise, survivors need to have gen speeds reduced, because with the right perks and enough people it is just too punishing to play as killer. A team of competent survivors can eliminate a very skilled killer a lot of the time, and that offsets the balance from a pure skill point of view.
---
BBQ, Ruin, Surveillance, Pgtw that’s my optimal billy build and I clap cheeks with it when I do use it.
---
Yea, that's a great way to express him.
---
Idk what thanksgiving is for you then.
---
/s
---
Are you the original flamingkitty? That transcended Human being protagonist if many legends????
---
I'm such a big fan
---
TBH, it's not the balance. It's the player. A great survivor team will pretty much always win. No matter how efficient the killer plays, a 4 v 1 will always favor the numbers.
---
Identity V is made and owned by NetEase. The very company that buckled Blizzard into the recent hearthstone/hong kong debacle.
---
I'd avoid investing in that game at all costs.

I’m just thinking. What the heck he going to do? He attacks in dreams so if I don’t dream about him then he can’t do anything. Good cosplay tho
---
*Sad wraith noise*
---
Sorry, I should have emphasized the "only" part more. 
---
The meme here is specifically making fun of saying gg as the victor in the context of ending the game fast, not in the context of someone who wouldnt say the same if they lost
---
Ever had a time when you don't know who the killer is, and then all of a sudden, "GRAAAAA" you stepped on a hag trap and your heart done fell outta your ass?
---
If this is true, someone should definitely have said something. They have absolutely left us in the dark. Also who the hell talks to the player base like that?
---
This is one of the worst dev teams I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with on a consistent basis.
---
If this game had any real competition, it would drop to completely unsustainable levels of players, not because the game is bad by itself, but because they don't fix very clear issues, handle anything well, and because they already mishandle their matchmaking system with the playerbase they do keep around.
---
Somehow, time and time again, BVHR ham fist fixes/"solutions", don't communicate or do so poorly, and are just generally unpleasant as a player.
---
It really sucks when you just want to play a game, and you feel like doing so is somehow supporting people who genuinely don't deserve it. I've actually been telling myself that if they would just release the event (not the update), or give us double BP, I/we could overlook some of the bugs, glitches, and the disconnects (that they seem to not want to deal with) for a bit while we wait for some more patches, but damn is that such an awful way of thinking/feeling.
---
Considering that the original name of the event was "The Hallowed Catalyst" which was then turned into "The Withering Blight", which in the game is something that occurs after Halloween, I wonder how long have BHVR knew about this problem but was hoping they could get it fixed before Halloween?
---
Then demogorg should have his shred ability not compatible with exposed status effects
---
It is but it’s still disappointing. The devs also aren’t handling it in the best way.
---
I mean kill people how you want, but dont complain when someone does something scummy to you when you play survivor then. To me it just looks like people dont trust their own skills when they resort to tactics like this.
---
No, it's a MONSTER.  
---
***SMASH IT***
---
I thoirght the frying pan was a magnifying glass.
---
You... I like you...
---
How exactly are they supposed to handle it? Sure I agree they could give a bloodhunt but this community begs for a bloodhunt any time *anything* goes wrong.
---
Yes, to this description.
---
We are NOT being called the hookers
---
Boo what about the BWWWWWAAAAAAAAMMMMP
---
Which I agree is uncalled for, but when an event goes awry it makes sense. The devs and people running the discord have been kinda blunt and rude about it, that’s all I mean.
---
I would say the "the 2 minute" part is just an exaggeration to describe how lobsided the match was. It's not really targeting games that end very fast specifically
---
The Perk use to work any time you were picked up (only once per match), meaning you basically had 3 hits to hook anyone. First hit to injure, second to down, third to down again after they got off your shoulder. With the Re-Work, IE Buff for Killers, Nerf for Survivors, the perk only works after you've been unhooked for 40/50/60 seconds. Meaning, you get downed, hooked, then when you are taken off the hook a timer starts. If you are knocked down and picked up within that timer, 40/50/60 seconds, you will get a chance to DS off the killers shoulder.   
---
The balance was made to prevent tunneling players and getting them out of the game too quickly. It's made it more likely for killers to chase the Unhook-er rather than the Unhook-ee.
---
The mindgames never stop, Deet.
---
Give that to a different map
---
In your settings menu you can change the controls!
---
Sounds like you're on PC. Dedicated servers are enabled on PC right now, meaning the killer isn't hosting anymore. You'll get disconnected whenever the server you're on feels like closing your session. I'm assuming it's when there's only one person left, but I don't think we know for sure what makes the chat close.
---
They delayed the patch to add more bugs.
---
Dawwww ♥️
---
They've released an apology and an update explaining the delay. Are they supposed to send us flowers and a card with each comment too? 
---
Imagine being one of the community managers and getting flamed every single time you make a comment. Being professional is all you can ask of someone in that position
---
Wait, it is compatible? I have been running STBFL on Demogorgon and when I use shred on the obsession, the stacks don’t drop.
---
With spaghetti code everything can effect anything
---
Corrupt intervention is being used as a replacement. Seems ok
---
I deleted the other post? How do you know I posted 2?
---
I deleted the other post because it didn’t have a tag.
---
My personal disappointment doesn't come from the fact that the event was delayed, it comes from the fact that they made the Halloween event directly tied to the archives. The Halloween event wasnt released only because of an issue with the mid-chapter update. If they simply left the two things separate, it would have allowed for the event to drop still. 
---
I'm still bitter about the situation but we're most likely going to be getting it next Tuesday, so it'll be here for halloween. But as someone who wanted to make a video for the event, then to release it on halloween, it sorta hit me hard in terms of annoyance.
---
Honestly, I think its fucking hilarious that my comment about "dont get pissy just because people enjoyed themselves or are being polite" is sparking this much heat. Talk about a toxic community.
---
Keep doing you my dude, I for one am not a rage-filled loser who gets mad at people for winning.
---
Anyone old enough to remember the world of warcraft forums when it was just vanilla wow? This dude reminds of a mod called tseric. Could be a good ass dude and was transparent as to what they were doing but man when he was in a mood it showed on every log...sadly he was let go after a post was made kind of baiting him to respond and he went full force on it
---
That's just the full Menu theme.
---
A kid  caught upto him so I’m sure you could too 
---
Your nerves got the better of you
---
...so breaking your devour hope before it’s active to avoid the exposed status effect and mori is “toxic” now? forgive me if I’m reading this incorrectly
---
why they work the other days?
---
Jokes on you I want to get face camped
---
It makes me laugh
---
Nah, you're the KILLER. There's no reason that you're required to let them go
---
that dwight dev should be fired
---
He's actually one big swole muscle underneath that Romper
---
Holy shit, this, the ammout of people fucking losing it is absurd
---
Yeah. Played 2 games as Bubba, 6 escaped out the hatch randomly after finding a key in a chest. 4 taps of R1 and that’s every survivor escaped. Hate them. Don’t like using them as survivor either
---
Maybe not worry about the 4 kills and instead focus on the points you can get through the game hooking, chasing, hitting, etc. Same goes for Survivors. Surviving the match doesn’t necessarily mean that they had a good one and are going to get lots of points. I don’t mind if I die so long as I did enough to help my team mates in that round. As killer, I don’t mind survivors using the keys at all. The hatch doesn’t even spawn until there are a certain amount of gens done to players and usually by that time, I’ve earned points doing other things as killer. 
---
You can also bring up moris. The fact that killers can kill someone immediately after their first hook ending their entire game sometimes within a few minutes is pretty OP in itself! Even Michael Myers who can mori people in healthy state. There’s a lot of sucky things on both sides but we just gotta suck it up and make sure we are getting the points we work hard for.
---
That's the coolest Minecraft skin I've seen so far good job Sir or madam
---
I personally think that kind of deception is unsportsmanlike, but play however you want.
---
It goes on, at about 27:20 you should hear the chase theme. 27:10 is just when the approaching theme is about to end.
---
yes u gonna regret it for buying
---
Last survivor and you killed them? Good going you tunneling trash killer. /s
---
Why?
---
bruh the battlefront 2 community IS NOT adamant about supporting the games MTX. holy shit, I was once made a post about making a r6 seige season pass sorta thing so we could get more content, and I got severely downvoted. Also it takes 1 day to grind for anything u want, so MTX is pretty much useless. I aint gonna argue with people this stubborn, but BHVR is extremely greedy with the way they handle content. I mean weren't new killers and survivors free? But they changed it to cost 9k shards? over the course of 2 full years of playing DBD I think I've only gotten 22k shards.... like ffs.. and ive spent so much money on their licensed stuff. It's just unfair......
---
Yes, it is considered an offensive action
---
Even a miss costs a stack
---
Number of times I've successfully grabbed a survivor off something while not farming with them:  10
---
Number of times my character sticks out their arm and gets stuck in that position like I'm half a mummy or a really unenthusiastic Nazi, without actually fucking grabbing, because this fundamental game mechanic has been glitched to hell and back since day 1: 436,822,760
---
Yeah, with those sorts of odds I'm just gonna whack 'em.
---
How much do you think SWF influences the way Killer mains feel about game balance?
---
Breaking hexes is a priority for most, and face camping, in my experience is not due to need to be toxic, but rather just showing the killer doesn’t know any better and is willing to give up the match for one kill
---
I agree. I'm happy to wait for archives if it means it all comes out smoothly.
---
As a 50/50 main if u think spinning in place is toxic and a camp worthy action ur pretty sensitive lol. And ik getting a totem popped early is annoying but your better off just playing normally and getting bp even if u “lose” than face camping someone who popped ur totem “to early” and getting table scraps for points.
---
Don’t kink-shame us, sir!
---
if you can narrow down that it devour hope is before its active go ahead. also its possible to figure our devour before it can expose since the killer moves faster after the 1st unhook. giving you 2 more before they have exposed
---
Yeah breaking totems is not toxic my guy. Or sabotaging hooks.
---
What exactly did they change engine wise? I thought the only updating was the rift and halloween event?
---
Bottle smash funny
---
It was an update to Unreal Engine 4 that caused a web of problems. The thing is with this sort of issue, fixes tend to create new problems, so you're almost always on the back foot.
---
Never announced a summer event big boy
---
I’m not gonna stare at you closely to see if you have devour hope or not after one or two unhooks and risk not getting the chance to cleanse the totem before your third stack kicks in...if it glows it goes
---
Wait, are you calling me a rage filled loser?
---
That all depends on what you find interesting to you! The Halloween DLC is a classic favorite if you want a recommendation, but I think if you’re looking at a certain DLC go for that one.
---
What problems exactly? Did they say?
---
You should get the Leatherface Killer DLC first for his teachable perk BBQ and Chili, one of the most valuable perks in the game. It helps out with getting more bloodpoints, this game’s in game currency, per match, which in turn will help make leveling your other characters faster. Also, the killer himself is pretty basic, perfect for beginners still learning how to play Killer.
---
They detailed some of it in their status update, it's pinned on the sub.
---
I'd say just go with what you like. It also depends on if you're playing killer or survivor mostly, but generally, just have fun.
---
Ive been hit once with the shred by a demo who had a noed on xb1 close to when he was first released, couldve sworn i saw it on a dbd youtube video of someone getting downed from the exposed effect with the ability also
---
I want them to crush my fucking skull into dust with their hot thighs
---
I never understand when I see people in this sub saying Ash would never be running or hiding like, he’s an idiot lol. He can wield the chainsaw/boomstick well, and he’s a charming badass when need be, but his first priority is himself and taking the easiest way out. I can’t even count the times I’ve heard Bruce describe Ash as a coward.
---
Nah, I'm saying that it's better to just ignore people who might get mad at you for saying GG. You're gucci, I think at least
---
I'm mainly concerned about missing popular maps, or certain maps being dead because people don't have the DLC.
---
Well good to know that Jason Maggard wants adrenaline buffed.
---
[https://youtu.be/ktvcYRsKoqs?t=73](https://youtu.be/ktvcYRsKoqs?t=73) It's just Closing in. The legion fanmade theme even says in the description they made it using the closing in music
---
The Halloween pack is overall the best one the game has to offer, very good perks for both sides and a very fun and effective killer as well. I can also recommend shattered bloodline for deliverance from Adam for surv and all of spirits perks are great and she's the best killer on console :)
---
im not saying breaking totems or sabo ing is toxic. just breaking totems before you know what hex(s) there are is pointless and might actually be bad if the killer is only running haunted
---
I think most people find this bs as inexcusable because in the resources, time and money they invest in cosmetic releases, it takes away from the areas they should be focusing on which is obvious testing and bug patches.. If DBD were an assignment and the team were a college student, the community is one annoyed ass teacher who thinks there is no excuse for delays. Like others have said, this event should of been going on all october, I agree with you; BECAUSE DBD is the ONLY asymmetrical game out there now and it might be from that lack of competition they'd rather focus their efforts on skins instead of timeliness. But in terms of drawing new players to the game this is like if Amazon stopped all shipments during December. I'm not saying lots of people will permanently quit, but if it's the only asymmetrical game out right now that's horror based, the fact they missed October, to release it because of "bugs" or "the entity's weird sense of humor" all while every other game, RL, TF2, Apex Legends, even OW, all the television channels running sp00ky movies and the time of the season in general and NOT capitalizing and pouncing on it in a timely and ORGANIZED manner could be a huge loss to potential income through new players. DBD might seriously need to consider a change to its upper management because this shit is getting old and too redundant. Especially how ST3 &gt; dedicated servers, which are broken apparently and unsurprisingly. And if there's no x2 or x3 bp or increase in bp multipliers, I think I'm done. Not talking for everyone, just speaking on a number of people's legitimate concerns.
---
nick castle probably
---
Should be an option for turn left and right. Mouse will still steer but q/e will be useable too.
---
Clearly biased smh smh smh, they gave us the Gruesome Gateau, that was really good!
---
~~and another reason to play a different game~~
---
They know about this issue
---
A) he got 2 from camping, 2 from the fact that 2 people trying to survive and do 5 gens is next to impossible, especially as soon as one gets found. 
---
B) it’s not really a strategy, it’s more like a dickhead move. Picture the common problem of any other game: pace abusing FIFA, camping and sniping in cod, etc
---
In olden times it was impolite to say GG first if you won. You wait for the loser to say GG then say GG back. This has gone by the wayside since
---
us?
---
It’s not really anyone’s problem if the losing side sees it like that if you don’t wanna say it back then don’t..it’s still polite.
---
Game abuse. That’s the term I wanted
---
You won't find sympathy here. This sub is infested with killer mains who have that exact cheap mentality as the one who camped you. They are perfect little angels and survivors deserve it because they're toxic for existing. That's a summary of how they think.
---
Camping is scummy and shows a lack of brain cells. The best thing you can do is not give them anymore kills and power through gens to punish them.
---
What did the original say?
---
I think they're aware of the issue, but there's no fix at the moment. Other people have also reported their items missing in the forums.
---
Depiping?
---
gg ez
---
First off if you’re gonna camp then expect hate mail for it. As a killer main, camping can give you kills you don’t deserve and overall don’t actually get you better even proxy camping. The defense that it is a play style is a joke and is in my opinion the definition of why new players quit so early. If you’re that paranoid about hooked survivors just do what I do and play trapper, at least you might get better trap placement skills from it. Or hag and demogorgon they can camp with out being there. Like I said I mostly play killer so my opinion might be taken as well (yes people have told me that because I main killer and not survivor even though I still play survivor I don’t have an opinion)  I don’t see the enjoyment from camping and it de-pips the survivors which is dumb and action needs to be taken balance wise and I’m not talking about perks, the perks are fine it’s rank wise where something needs to happen.
---
Oh wow, we know how BHVR is with these things.
---
I appreciate the warning about the thread. I had my fears lol. 
---
Honestly anyone that defends it is scum and is part of the problem
---
Yup
---
De ranking
---
idk if I would call it juking there was a lot of times he could have hit you but it seems like he is semi new to the game
---
Just do it for the daily
---
Well the only counter is to do the gens. If a killer knows survivors are around he has no real need to leave. It's not a fun strategy but if it works you can't blame people for doing it. No matter what game it is.
---
We all want to kill for the Entity... 
---
But, I mean, Trapper *is* looking hot af and that can be addressed too.
---
I really think it's official...
---
About consistent incompetence, you left that part out. People keep making excuses and you get companies like bethesda and EA. One mishaps IS forgivable, but when its a new blunder every other month, you need to stop making excuses for them
---
Wait, what's a Halloween event???
---
This post feels kinda tone deaf...
---
This. Everything in here. Yes 👍🏼❤️
---
This game will die, especially without cross platform on the switch. My girlfriend wanted to buy it so that we could play together but no point now
---
Really none of the dlc is a bad choice. Id buy leatherface for his bbq and chili perk because it helps gain 2x bloodpoints from a match. Other then that buy who looks cool and fun
---
Ah ok. Thank you lol
---
Gotta wait til next year so it gets patched lmao
---
Literally no sane killer main will tell you camping doesn’t suck..and it depends on what kind of camping, facecamping he’s an asshole,
---
Heh...which one?
---
r/uselessnobody
---
Yep, if I don’t get my hound mask back I’m literally quitting Dbd, this fucking game has just fallen apart.
---
It introduces the map, at which point it'll be put in prioritized rotation so people can see it, then it goes in to regular rotation.
---
IDK Ash in Ash vs Evil Dead is kinda a bitch. He will do everything to run away or be lazy and save his ass and if he's forced too, he'll fight.
---
Tho I'm 100% sure that spending half a second in the Entity's realm and seeing Susie grab a grown ass man on her shoulders and then break a thicc wooden pallet with two kicks is enough to make any man run away in fear.
---
And I LOVE that Ash is that way. We have a million brave badasses in fiction. We don't get that many selfish coward protagonists that are actually likable in the end. Ash's cowardice is part of the slapstick humor that made his movies and show so fun. I mark out every time he picks up the chainsaw and boomstick and says groovy, but it wouldn't be Ash if he didn't try and run away a little first.
---
Insidious Leatherface or Billy makes camping a playstyle.  Cloaked camping m1 killers is not a playstyle, it just means you suck.
---
Great Fidel Castro Cosplay
---
Nope. That’s just unlucky.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dn8cuu/new_skin/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
No, that’s the survivors fault but they would probably yell at u anyway.
---
Yeah no it isn’t. Let’s hear your argument before you go around getting hate from 90% of the people who view this
---
Them threatening with that is just so pathetic on their end. And also open to legal trouble. It's funny how the devs respond on art work on this reddit but whenever it's something serious or bad pr for Bhvr they are no where to be found.
---
I still think it's odd that in this day and age gamers aren't protected by the practices by some game devs. Look at Anthem. 60$ game and so much shit was lied about and what not.
---
Not even a little.
---
I thought I was in r/Kappa for a sec.
---
First of all, I didn't say that the Battlefront 2 community is adamant about MTX's, I said they were adamant about supporting the game.
---
DLC killers were never free outside of the nurse and huntress. Both of whom were special cases. If you take the amount of games it takes you to make 25k shards (579 according to dbd wiki) and the average game time which according to steam forum posts hovers around roughly 15 minutes, the math comes up like this:
---
579*15=8685m/60=144.75h/3(to get the amount for 1 killer)=~48.25 hours of gametime per character.
---
IMO that's too much gametime required to unlock a character, but it is by no means a 2 year journey.
---
Oh shit I would actually kill for that
---
This is actually so accurate haha
---
You can't grab vaulting players if they are uninjured
---
&gt;Saying GG regardless of win or lose isn’t being a good sport?
---
Not even close to what I was saying, try reading next time.
---
Given how abrasive you are over this though, you're making it a hard sell that you're a good sport in post game chat.
---
All I said was, wait for the losing side to say GG first as it's the polite thing to do considering we're not in a face-to-face environment and you can't actually read your opponents.
---
we dont know how we did it if you guys try to ask
---
Yeah I'd replace pretty much everything.  
---
Lightborn is not a perk you run every game.  It only serves a purpose in flashlight lobbies and even then in my opinion it's only worthwhile if there's 2 or more in there.
---
Unrelenting is a terrible perk in general but it especially makes no sense on Hillbilly.  Instead of using a perk that minimizes the penalty of bad swings just practice your aim and be more disciplined.  Don't swing at everything.  Be patient.  On Billy it's even worse since you're running a bad M1 perk on an M2 killer.  He's got the saw and you should be prioritizing it anytime survivors aren't at safety they can use to obstruct it like pallet loops and windows.
---
Enduring is solid.  That one can stay it you like it.
---
Here's a list of solid perks for Billy. BBQ,  Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, Nurses Calling, Discordance, Spirit Fury for your Enduring, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Tinkerer, Overcharge, Dying Light, Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher.
---
My build currently is BBQ, Ruin, Pop and Nurses
---
I'm a legion main and I feel personally attacked
---
Godamn you magnificent bastard
---
I FORGOT THAT YOU NEED TO BE THE LAST SURVIVOR TO ESCAPE TO GET THE ITEM OF OBSESSION ACHIEVEMENT. 
---
FUCK, JUST WHEN I ENCOUNTERED A NICE SPIRIT THAT LET US ESCAPE AFTER A DC.
---
Probably all the survivors will be using underrated perks so i could use a meta perks, but i think that no having the possibility of change it ever is a little too much, maybe you could change one time per 50 levels.
---
I really wish game dev’s would dive into these types of games more.  There really needs to be a solid asymmetrical game.
---
Don’t have any teachables besides spirit fury
---
She's just a better player then you Pog
---
If it's a stomp, then the winner saying GG is, at best, an empty platitude that the losers know is empty and at worst it's intentionally condescending.
---
Everyone is incredibly whiny and acting like they're paying some subscription fee for this shit. Can't bother saying anything on here tho cus it's usually downvoted
---
That and I mean they shouldn't have tied the event so heavily into a brand new feature, that's the bigger issue with it too. Especially a Halloween event.
---
I actually think in this case it makes it better than if it didn’t have it
---
Keep leveling your killers to 40 then to unlock them because you'll need these perks available as you rank up.
---
If you have Spirit Fury definitely toss that on for now with your Enduring.  Sloppy Butcher is a non teachable perk.  You'll want to level up your Hag and Nurse pretty quick for Ruin and Nurses Calling.  You'll have a great build once you do.
---
I think the shittiest part about it is that the cosmetics have been in the store now all month, but only those willing to spend money on them will get them. I also feel bad for any poor souls who didn’t know you’ll be able to get them for free soon enough and spent money on them.
---
Honestly it just really kills all the momentum having them there, not to mention the two less cosmetics than last year. Only one for survivor is a joke. What a mess.
---
I guess they're different types of fear, obviously you wouldnt encounter a nurse irl so it would definitely be spoopy, specially if you know where she comes from, legion on the other hand is not supernatural or anything like that but I dont think encountering a band of masked teenagers with knives would end well.
---
Either way I think you're right, I dont see them in the same category
---
Happened again. And now it's thrice in a row.. :(
---
Ok.
---
Half? I think you mean *all.*
---
(except maybe myers)
---
depends on what perks you have access to?
---
"Sorry for the DCs, gg" would be the best response for that
---
Good to see Tru3 here love his streams
---
"I'm so sorry that a game company that makes millions of dollars that have far exceed 200 million is expected to be able to provide a functional game in return on the investment that the players have made into our product."
---
Man, sorry not sorry that I expect something more from a game that isn't a beta and is in full production while they pump out cosmetics and push development onto a new platform while getting free advertisement through the community via word of mouth, memes and video content throughout twitch, twitter, Facebook and other platforms but for some ridiculous reason can't get their shit together where it matters or hire people competent enough to do the job to make this game enjoyable beyond being just a meme at this point.
---
But sure, feel bad for the devs because the lead game designer and manager is a useless piece of shit.
---
It really depends on my mood. If I’m pissed off I play killer to let my anger out lol. Survivor I usually play with friends because it’s more fun
---
Even though it would have aged poorly, I would have been tempted to have the clown doing a thumbs up.
---
more like queuing for killer be like:
---
Can't nobody loop me round nothinnnnnn, can't loop me round nothin.
---
I almost have enough for Pop
---
(•_• ) Skip Summer event to work on dedicated severs. 
---
(•_• ) Dedicated severs are delayed. 
---
( °o°) Dedicated severs are delayed.
---
You’re probably 100% right, but they should’ve at least done double bloodpoints to tide the community over. 
---
They were gonna do one at the end of the event, just move it to the start instead.
---
My problem comes down to *continued* incompetence, and I don't want to be thankful that they're trying to do things right now that it's been months of doing it wrong. They've said this kind of thing, numerous times before, and then still damaged the game for weeks at a time. My laptop meets maximum requirements to play, and I currently get inconsistent 28 frames these days, with no update on what the new requirements are. This is a cherry on top.  
---
Basically:  
---
\- "We decided we'd put off a full engine update until after releasing Stranger Things, which kicked the total concurrent players up by 20,000.  
---
\- We also didn't get Dedicated Servers in for months, and when we did, it added more people getting kicked and lobby crashes.  
---
\- We wanted to link this whole event into a battlepass.  
---
 Doing all of these in quick succession has ruined the stability of our new build, so, we'll be testing it and the release will show up when it shows up."  
---
I don't *want* to defend any of that, you know? These people sold me a product, and I've put around $120 into said product in the last year. I now have problems using even basic the features said product, and this is all culminating in people acting like it's stupid to be upset about another thing going wrong with their development cycle. If this was a subscription-based game, I'd have taken a break for 3 months, and let them sort it out. As it stands, I bought the game, and I can't even enjoy playing with friends until they sort out all the changes they've made and update the game to be stable again.
---
Is the Sun in there?
---
To me, saying gg even if you win is fine, if you want to be toxic or to rub it in you say gg ez. Toxic af but I don’t think saying gg is rude even if you win
---
It's a valid criticism just look at some of the posters on this sub.  Some are mindblowingly biased with little to no understanding of the game from the others perspective and demonstrate no desire to even attempt to view it from the opposing side.
---
If you don't play both sides it's impossible to really be able to provide unbiased suggestions because you're only looking at them from the aspect of how do they benefit me.  I'm not saying you can't play more of one side or another and have a valid opinion and understanding of the game but the ones that depend 90%+ of their time only playing the one side struggle when it comes to understanding game balance and you can see it in their comments on here.
---
If you still don’t get it it’s probably because of her perk “Boil Over” which has a horse on it
---
It’s called. Sarcasm. It’s a form of expression most commonly used for comedic effect or dramatic effect.
---
Seriously, wtf is that? I have no technical skill in terms of computer science but I'm fairly sure doubling the rates of the game would be a pretty simple switch, unless bp events themselves are only connected to updates...
---
Yeah that's an amazing perk.  See you're close to having an optimal loadout.  You just got to unlock a couple of these and you'll be good to go
---
Survivors LOVE it when the killer leaves immediately. They think they've broken you so hard that you ran off and couldn't handle the post-game window.
---
You're better off just disabling the chat window, honestly.
---
Killing him was not mean.The way you did was awful and yoxic though.
---
I wish I was creative enough to make a costume as good as this! Well done.
---
That mask is intense. It’s like its staring into my soul.
---
Do not buy it to play. There's literally no one ever on. Only buy it if you're just buying it for the Meg mask.
---
I’m a split between Billy and Legion but figured Billy being my highest level atm would be a good place to start
---
Saying gg isn't sportsmanship. You say gg if it was actually a GOOD GAME, a tense match with quite equally skill level on both sides. Of you crush survivors in under 2 minutes it's not gg. If you crush a killer in under 3 minutes its not gg. At least that's my definition of "gg", I actually mean it if I say it and not just say it out of habits or good manners.
---
While it's good that they eventually made a public statement about the mistakes and the delay, the fact remains that it still took them three entire days to do so, leaving the already upset community to stew in the dark.
---
Everything they said in the status update could've been said hours after the initial announcement.
---
i dont get the joke, Running stridor on spirit is like putting training wheels on a tricycle.
---
If you're trash at the game then yeah
---
&gt; once something comes along that it is more refined and scratches the itch way better, then everyone is going to drop this game
---
This is the best description I've ever heard of this game.
---
Thats a really good costume!!! Hope you have fun with it this halloween friend!!
---
Yes, if he's hit someone else nearby and Frenzy's Killer Instinct is in range, you will show up.
---
The game is fully functional. 
---
The cosmetics are completed by a completely different team who don't touch the code, they're artists, not programmers.
---
The studio has, as far as we're aware, 2 separate titles being worked on by a workforce of 500. That is no simple task. 
---
But go ahead, get upset because an update is delayed instead of being released in its current state to break the game. 
---

It shouldn't be too hard to update but given the track record of BVHR updating engine versions... they shouldn't have thought it would have been stable in any amount of time.

There are really sensitive people online, I’ve seen survivors and killers get mad. A survivor got mad at me for “tunneling” but I just kept on bumping into him, I wasn’t trying to continuously go after him, it’s just bad luck for him or he’s bad at hiding and he got mad over it. Also while in a chase about 40 meters away from the hook, I see a survivor try and rush into the building and get a save in the basement and got mad at me for going back even though I saw him go for the save. I didn’t even tunnel, I went for him and he got mad. In conclusion, there’s a lot of sensitive people in this game

How’d you know when you needed to 360?

Imo, it’s only rubbing it in with a gg ez or something like that

Let's be honest, it's still gonna be broken

Personally I use Whispers, Ruin, Surveillance, Nurses/Sloppy butcher/thanatophobia,

How close is close enough? My timing is often poor
---
Very interesting information you provided, I didn't knew that but it kinda makes sense. Thanks for sharing
---
Freddy mains assemble
---
Very strange indeed. Why one but not the other? Footsteps are impossible to hear through loud af chase music anyways.
---
Thanks for the info
---
I've been playing for 2 years.
---
If you think you're disappointed now, just you wait.
---
I just think as a 500+ workforce game developer, with Deadby reaching over 5 million sales and countless sold DLC, Microtransactions, and the upcoming Battlepass, they shouldn't be having these issues anymore.  
---
Lower workload, hire the right people to help in your departments, address the degradation clearly being caused from the continued new content updating over the old, and tell us exactly what's going on and how it affects things more than a day before the update is going to occur.  
---
 I'll be okay with supporting a dev doing that, but for now, I'm pretty annoyed with all of this.
---
🦀🦀$20🦀🦀
---
Usually I do it when it reaches halfway up my back
---
It's still gonna be broken. Dunno why you're dickriding them so hard when they fuck up every single update
---
"Spirit takes skill" and other jokes you can tell yourself.
---
Yes, and when i went back there it worked normally
---
When i started it was during the 3rd year anniversary, and i had a Gruesome Gateau, and so did the entire team.. all 5 Gateaus.. and the killer DC's
---
&gt;Will the event still be launched with bugs? Yeah probably.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;But this is ensuring that they won’t be literal game breaking bugs, crashing it to hell and dropping frames like nobody’s business. 
---
&gt;It’ll still have issues, but I can wait another couple of weeks so it’s not a complete train wreck of a patch.
---
It's still gonna have gamebreaking bugs and frame drops. Every update does.
---
True

I agree she should move grass and make steps

---
"Not the best..." it's still pretty damn awesome. And even more kudos for it not being a Legion.
---
&gt;and the progress I lost wasn't logged as ever being completed.
---
well if it was logged we wouldnt be *having* this problem would we
---
the thing that bothers me is that the patch was not ready before it was set to release. chances are that they had finished making everything but they encountered some bugs. and of course, that can happen. **but they should give themselves time to find the bugs.**
---
i think that they should be completely done with the patch at least one week before its set to release. that way they'll have the whole week to test it and find and fix bugs.
---
if there truly were gamebreaking bugs, they couldve possibly been fixed in time for Tuesday if they had been done with the patch at a reasonable time.
---
aka im annoyed that they procastinate with finishing all of this stuff. events and patches and all that jazz shouldnt be worked on right before its set to release. it should be finished a while before so theres time to fix bugs and adjust things that need adjustment etc. and i think its perfectly fine to be mad at them for not doing that. thats not a human mistake. thats a conscious decision. they decided to take a risk by working on it right before its release.
---
&gt; The event will come, the event will not be cut short, and I'm sure something will come our way to apologise for the delay 
---
thats a pretty big assumption considering they are refusing to extend the duration of the event and/or give us a blood points hunt.
---
&gt;  You guys are doing well, 
---
they arent. i love this game very much and i have defended BHVR time and time again for almost every bad thing that has happened since i started playing this game a year ago. but im not stupid. im not some obsessed fanboy. i can be logical and acknowledge that what they did this time is not okay.
---
the mistakes they make just keeps piling up. the fact that the spaghetti code is so difficult to work with, or the coders are bad (which i doubt), or there arent enough coders, is annoying. the fact that outfits that cost aulric cells are so expensive is annoying. the fact that each and every patch comes with an insane amount of *common* bugs is annoying. the fact that its been months and months and dedicated servers are still absolutely horrible is annoying. but i always defend them because they also give us many great things. but this is just too much.
---
you SHOULD NOT act like this and condone their behavior. no game developers should do this. what im talking about is what i said at first; they shouldnt have worked on the patch right before it was supposed to release. if they had given themselves time to finish the patch at a reasonable time whilst having enough time to test for bugs, that wouldve most likely helped them. if there were so many gamebreaking bugs, they wouldve known it before the PTB rolled out. if they hadnt tested it before the PTB, theyre dumb. if they knew it when the PTB came out, theyre dumb for not instead already saying at this point that the patch might get delayed.
---
i have a lot of respect for the people that work on BHVR but the cold truth is that they are incredibly irresponsible. you know how EA charges too much for shitty and lackluster Sims 4 DLCs because they know theres no competition? thats how i feel about DBD except its not the DLCs that are the problem; its almost everything else. they dont take enough time to fix this shitty coding and these shitty bugs because they know we're stuck with them if we want to play a game like DBD.
---
so far ive seen little to nothing of what you talk about. i havent seen anyone actually say inappropiate and nasty things. all ive seen are disappointed people and valid criticism. the people that work at BHVR arent made of fucking sugar. instead of fanboying over them, you should be realistic and logical and appreciate them for what they do right, and critize them for what they do wrong. mistakes are bound to happen but considering theres so many "mistakes" every fucking patch, not to mention all the extra "mistakes" that happens sometimes, its just gotten inexcusable. babying the devs instead of recognizing when the shit they do isnt okay wont help with the game at all.
---
Spot the weeb

DBD meme of the year

the problem is that survivors require too much guesswork to figure out what a spirit is doing. too much guesswork that punishes too hard.

they didnt say when it would be out because, according to peanits on discord, they dont know

Hm, there might be a fix, have you tried fully shutting down the PS4 and then turning it on a little after, it can make the disconnects a little less frequent
---
That was a get out of jail free card.
---
Billy is the 3rd “best” killer in the game at the moment so it’d be good to learn him
---
I hope you get an answer for this I’m dyin to know
---
Lol you have no clue who I am and how long I’ve been gaming, get the fuck on and quit making excuses for them. Been around long enough and seen this shit before with game developers, and their company when shit like this keeps happening. BhVR has a really good thing and needs to get ahold of of it, and I blame the management of that company! You also don’t drop a seasonal event with a major update, like they keep doing. 
---
Go look at Zipper Interactive and get back to me. Just because I play Fortnite doesn’t mean shit, I have a whole library of shit that goes back to the original Nintendo that I can still play. Plus shit on Nintendo works better than this game...
---
The game heavily implies that the Entity took those away from him. But I get your point
---
You know it was mean but I guess everyone has to get attention some how
---
Wait they removed dedicated servers?
---
If it's any consolation, having their posts ignored must hurt them more than having them removed.
---
I made a post on the topic of Mori's.  In my opinion, Mori's should be about flair, not balance.  It should be that fun thing you get to do on occasion.  It shouldn't have a significant impact on the result of a game.  
---
Regarding keys, I tend to agree with you on this, though I would say, Keys shouldn't work until the killer closes the hatch.  This forces the game to be down to one survivor, though I understand why my thought on this wouldn't be popular.  Most killers feel that they should get a 4k if they killed 3 survivors.  The hatch makes them feel cheated for their effort.  That is a reasonable conclusion.  That said, it isn't a positive game experience.  At least there is some form of potential game play after 3 survivors are down and the game will automatically end, regardless.
---
Thought this was Castro on my feed

Thank you for not doing another Legion one.

---
I don't think you can argue that DbD is the "PUBG of this genre" because put bluntly better games *have* come along and haven't surpassed it. Plenty of games like Blackout Club, Last Year: The Nightmare, and the endless slew of direct DbD clones (Identity V, Soul at Stake) have done the formula similarly and sometimes better and still haven't been able to surpass DbD. While some of these games got boned by factors beyond their control (RIP in copyright hell, Jason) a lot of them were incredibly high quality and didn't get remotely the same amount of attention Dead by Daylight did.
---
Some of it can be justified by the games themselves not being that good (I can go into a whole discussion on Last Year) but I think a lot of it does just come to how much of a foothold DbD has made for itself. Two of the biggest factors for this game are the licensed characters and the grind. Being able to play as Freddy Kruger or Michael Myers is what hooks people in, and having to grind for thousands of hours is what keeps people invested. We can talk about the quality and morality of the grind but you have to face the fact that it's a huge reason people stay invested.
---
I know that for me personally when it came to the choice of picking Dead by Daylight over Friday the 13th a big reason was that I love the Halloween series and don't care much for Friday the 13th or Jason Voorhees. There were other factors too (not least of which being that my friend who got me into the game played it constantly and gave it a very positive review) but devoid of those factors I would've probably still bought DBD over its competitors.
---
So going back to the PUBG and Fortnite comparison: Dead by Daylight is like what would happen if Player Unknown got the rights to John Wick and Stranger Things and The Avengers before Epic Games did. Fortnite would still arguably be a better game than PUBG, but PU would have John Wick and The Demogorgon and Thanos while Fortnite would have a bunch of random guys running around with pickaxes.
---
It's going to take a game with an insane amount of work to knock DbD off its perch, or an astronomical fuck up on Behaviour's part.
---
I give you that, it’s been the only thing this year worth ah shit, BhVR has really just been on a constant rampage of delayed, broke, bugged updates this year. I’ve grown tired of the constant incompetent repetitive status of this game and a developer who clearly doesn’t know what to do. Can’t wait to see how the game is on PS5 lol
---
they're the parents on halloween
---
also clown doesn't look like he's speedwalking so that too

No.

What are you talking about, why are players acting so fucking entitled lately, jesus christ

Pretending to be friendly just to kill them after, and still tea bag was really toxic of you.
---
Thanks! My girlfriend and I agreed a month ago we'd be Frank and Susie and we'll post another picture together for Halloween.
---
Let's see Legion, Amanda, and Fresdy try to pick THIS big boi up.
---
IIRC they have a strict update timeline they have to adhere to for Console. If they kept PTB open they wouldn't be able to utilize any of the data points anyway as the update is effectively set in stone.
---
If the game was still PC only they'd have a lot more leeway.
---
If they are camping work on gens. You aren’t entitled to a free unhook.  Going as far as to message them out of game with salt is stupid. 
---
Camping is a strat. A cheap one, but effective on people that think they should just be able to walk up and unhook freely.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dn91sx/has_anyone_else_noticed_the_survivors_dailys/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yo I thought you where salty bro
---
I'm upset because the game barely functions regardless of the event or not. I'm upset because they have the money and resources to make shit happen but don't. I'm upset because they prioritize cosmetics and monetization over the overall health and stability of the game. They absolutely fucking have the resources and money to make this happen. Quit making excuses for them.
---
Apparently evading the killer is a stupid strategy
---
I’ve seen this before and it was to Du Hast by Rammstein
---
I love the deliverance decisive strike end-game plays. They’re so satisfying.
---
I mean just about everyone in this story is an asshole. Like why would you and all your friends send hatemail because you lost.
---
In reality, everyone should be against The Entity for dragging them into this eternal nightmarish twighlight.
---
Like, it's not survivors V's killers, it's the players Vs. Bhvr.
---
The issue isn't that they are delaying a buggy mess. The buggy mess being a thing in the first place is the issue. 
---
They've had literal months to prepare for both the event and the rift/archives. But when the time comes around where it's supposed to be released it gets delayed. The devs just seem incompetent or dysfunctional at the very least at this point. Changing one thing in the game to break two completely unrelated things in the process seemingly with every update.
---
Whether it be because poor timing, or just what seems to be procastination; the devs don't deserve support for the inability to get such a simple thing like a seasonal event out on time.
---
The game functions perfectly fine, there are some latency issues but that is standard fare with P2P game, plus dedicated servers are coming. Where are the numbers? Again, cosmetics and monetization are handled by people who have nothing to do with the game health and stability, please stop confusing the two.
---
PS4 (genthealien), I usually play as survivor, rank 15 rn. I'm still trying to get better at this game, especially when it comes to looping/escaping killers. Anyway, I don't have much requirements. Just want to have fun, play with more people, learn new tactics, etc. I work and have school so I usually just play on weekends.
---
At least we’re not camping the basement with a chainsaw...
---
Never saw it that way, it's so damn accurate!
---
Butt cheeks are nice tho
---
Who’s the top killer then?
---
There's a substantially higher chance of it, in my experience. There's no incentive to play against a SWF, either. 
---
Not all SWFs are bad, like you say, but I'd rather take the safer lobby for the more relaxed game. I've played a decent chunk of time and I no longer play as much as I used to, so when I do play, I don't want sweaty tryhard SWFs.
---
Devs have no idea what is matchmaking...
---
Hmmm i did buy her chapter so I don’t know what caused this.
---
Should of made the Claudette sound more of a dick then we would be congratulating you but instead we are all jeering at you for being such a baby about it the dickhead is you

Oh yeah? Thanks for your generous ear bvhr, so unique in the gaming scene for a company to listen to its players and not leaving us in the dark, so so brave and generous, it's not like that is or should be standard if you want our fucking money, entiteled twats!
---
Legion family
---
this is great
---
Its a horror game, every patch is a halloween event 🤯 boom no issue found
---
Halloween is my favorite franchise, and that was all so beautifully put.
---
To call the biggest update to date in the lifespan of the game a 'simple thing' is to show that you're not really grasping the situation. A content drop is one thing, this is a tectonic plate shift of an update and because of that is opens up a wide range of issues they have to deal with. They gave themselves the time, but the issues were too severe to either leave in until a hot fix or to fix on time. 
---
These things happen, it's unfortunate but it's not down to incompetence. They spend the time between updates developing the next update, then doing internal tests mixed with public tests, then we usually get the update delay free on time. This was a huge update and it was delayed because they'd rather provide an update that is stable and of a good quality than one that they just drop in knowing it will essentially break the game until they release a fix, following another delay thanks to a second certification period.
---
Game development is not an exact science, a small team ran into some big bugs and made the sensible decision to hold fire until they felt comfortable to let their players enjoy the game without it being fucked.
---
How is 76 pay to win though? Pretty much everything in the atom market is just cosmetic, and the things that aren’t have such a small impact on the game that it doesn’t even matter
---
Oh sure, so much power you obtain from being an asshole to the point that you ruin the fun of someone else, so much that he quits.
---
Aye this is true but sometimes they go abit far I few people throwing crap in their face like how we had no summer event even thoe it wasn’t announced or planned i think people need to calm down with their disappointment about it and say they fucked up and move on but the devs also need to pick up the slack and hire some better developers or build the game back up from scratch with better code (which is quite unreasonable I know)
---
Recently started playing Killer, might actually become my main lol
---
Not to be an asshole, but you’re completely in the wrong here. 
---
Juking is forcing out a mistake on the killer’s end and using the advantage to escape or get somewhere else, meanwhile camping is bad manners and usually an attempt at ruining a survivor’s game, unless you’re camping the End Game Collapse, which is usually fair.
---
Gotta admit I’ve done this before on accident, and yes I make the same face at myself.
---
they stayed up there because they knew you wouldnt know how to get up there, so, honestly. they wanted the bleed out. thats a win in their mind
---
Both should be props ngl
---
I'm not mad. Just disappointed.
---
If you are that far up there bum, maybe search for the Infos about the event? Maybe?
---
The only difference is that they DC at the end instead
---
Honestly... any dc should give full points to the killer and also give give the survivors who don’t a bonus as well
---
Along with, you know... actually punishing dcing
---
There’s literally no one from BHVR saying that the power outage had any repercussions other than a dev stream being delayed. It’s pure speculation to say it had any effect on the patch being delayed.
---
I feel like the chestburster Idea might be a bit broke. Maybe make it so that once the chestburster latches onto a survivor they have blindness for the rest of the trial?
---
I mean yeah matchmaking has always had problems, but also you picked arguably the worst time in the game's history to join the "fun", it's basically suffocating on its own success at this point.
---
Baby killers don’t get treated nicely :(
---
Or at least not on Xbox.
---
Y’all suck
---
Fuck true talent
---
Can you link this response please.
---
Well technically camping is a playstyle and how isn’t juking not ruining the killer experience, you sound super conceited, just saying but not in an asshole way.
---
Just incompetent, like always! Looks like someone from the balance department got his fingers on the Pr Twitter account.
---
Begone child
---
What are you talking about?
---
is the game actually popular on xb1?
---
killer queues are normally longer than surv which is why I don't play killer as often, but for me anyways playing surv mostly made playing killer easier because I can read what the survs are most likely to do, and the matchmaking sucks, I'm rank 3 and I get lobbies where its me a rank 9, 17 and 13 and I feel bad cause I'm red rank so the killer will probably be a toxic sweat, dbd sucks but it's also really fun just gotta deal with the bullshit unfortunately
---
Keep it up I expect an updated one when invisibility technology is invented so you can shift in and out of our plane of existence
---
I dunno, we'd managed before...
---
It was hell, admittedly, and I've not played for long enough that I don't even know if the perks have been readjusted again yet, but people still got kills.
---
Huh, I had no idea that series existed till right now
---
Us.
---
On PS4. Event is already started ;)
---
They hated him, for he spoke the truth.

---
Groovy
---
Demo isn't weak lmao
---
&gt;I'm sorry devs, but you haven't done a pretty good job so far. Not this time.
---
I shouldn't have laughed at that
---
I never called the 'huge update' itself a simple thing. To tie the huge update with a seasonal event, but then not being able to deliver with it; is just a plain bad idea. Which again I will assume is because they're either incompetent by not being able to get out what is promised, or dysfunctional by deciding to tie said seasonal event and huge update together. Most likely a mixture of both.
---
With the massive amount of time and hundreds of employees not being enough to fix supposedly severe issues, but still giving a definite day as to when it's to be done. It really makes you question BHVR's competency. Which already has been proven to be quite unsatisfactory and below the expectations of a company with it's status.
---
plus peeps gots ta learn to just die and get some points. with all those characters there are a lot of hungry mouths to feed bps to
---
If behaviour implemented something like this you know it would be an obsession perk.   
---
The ability to smack the survivors ass would require an skill check.   The carried survivor also gets the skill check.   Whomever lands the check closer to the center of the check slaps the ass of the other player.
---
If the killer wins, survivor stops struggling for 1/2/3 seconds.   If the survivor wins, they become the obsession and the killer stands still for 1/2/3 seconds as they continue to wiggle.  
---

Pretty much required for any online gaming that's not turn based.
---
Keys are essentially Moris for Survivors.
---
At this point it isn't even just about the event being delayed; the way they have handled the unexpected delay has been abysmal. First they make the announcement like the day before the event, they aren't transparent about the cause, they give an announcement for an announcment, and then they finally say that there is no ETA for the event.
---
*visibly retches*
---
Legion already got one and is alright, leatherface is unbalanced too but I think plague is more-so but nobody ever really plays her as much.
---
You’re right it doesn’t stop killers, just like survivors won’t stop juking. I guess it’s a lose/lose.
---
Juking is sacrificing someone else’s experience, for a new player, they’d would be furious so there you go.
---
*Shhhhh, they don't need to know that.*
---
To be fair, this is a kind of parody of that whole idea.
---
Well if I’m not good, and you rub it in my face, I suppose I’ll ruin your experience like you ruined mine, simple.
---
as a survivor and killer i dislike hawkins (its more specifically what killer im playing) 
---
but yamaoka i hate as a survivor its literally one big dead zone its so fucking dumb
---
Mk, if they're such a small team then maybe they should hire people. Woah, crazy right?
---
I don’t know I didn’t have any problems with csgo or payday 2 only dbd when it activated the servers I mean it did help other games but dbd was pretty much unplayable for me
---
'survive with friends' should have a spoiler to prevent triggering anyone
---
Bruh
---
Yeah but that Legion "rework" totally gutted them. They're pretty much the new Freddy and Bubba (take this from a Bubba main) is not too far behind. Plauge is atleast decent.
---
Though I agree they get way too much hate and shit thrown at them, some of it is deserved. They need to get their priorities straight
---
Hiring people requires pretty major investment and space. This is a very naive comment to make.
---
It’s a parody, while also trying to get karma. It’s super low effort. One again i’m not trying to start anything but that just me. The whole thing is pretty ironic
---
His add ons are a give and go but that other ebony definitely should be changed. I think that his core functions are fine but it just feels like he doesn't bring any significant gen pressure. Each time my Ruin or NOED comes in, it gets deleted immediately so that doesn't help. If anyone has any secrets or recommendations to playing him, by all means I'll try anything. It might also be because I'm at high rank atm but. I just really would like some help with him I think.
---
I love BHVR, but if they were in school the teacher would cry at the 10th perfect A+ assignment... that had also been two weeks late.
---
define nitpicky. I feel like this is two very different scnenarios. Hard to say what nitpicky evern is anymore wiht auditing burecoracy andgarbage
---
If they're not tea bagging or anything, how exactly are they rubbing it in your face? That's like saying someone is rubbing in your face you not being fast by the action of beating you in a race instead of letting you win and you needing to punish them being faster than you, which is a pretty psycho self centered way of seeing things.
---
Spinechill going off

"we're hemorrhaging bloodpoints"

Getting stuck in grab animation for 3 seconds before the survivor teleports to the other side of the window in a downed state.
---
Getting stuck in grab animation for 3 seconds before seeing the survivor lithe away into the distance because of derpacated servers.
---
Well maybe if they're not ready to make the investment to please their fanbase then them having a small team shouldn't be constantly used in their defense.
---
I mean juking is to counter the fact killers are faster than survivors in general, so at that point if you're getting juked all the time you just need more skill in reading, I don't play killer often but when I do there's always that survivor that loops the fuck out of you and makes you mad but it's just them countering your speed, and camping is a dickhead move but even then countering that is if survivors are smart enough to just leave it and gen rush, but dead by daylight is nothing but flaws and toxicity so really what's the point lmao
---
Didn't know the Observer went through this subreddit

What an epic fuckup. I mean this is embarrassing. The premiere horror-themed multiplayer game us going without a Halloween event in October. They should thank their lucky stars people are still playing the game, because as soon as a more competent competitor comes out with a better product - say goodbye to Behavior Inc.
---
Nope. Just your imagination.
---
It's not a pretty defence, it's a logistical fact. Less people and less resources means a slower production process. I'm sure they will expand, but  ultimately these bugs happened and they couldn't fix them the way they normally would with the time they normally afford themselves. People are acting like this delay is a fucking war crime and personally attacking the individuals behind the game as though it's been an affront to their existence to not have an update released on the date they were given. 
---
Then the moment I point this out people dive in complaining about other issues the game has. The game isn't flawless, I'm not saying its flawless, but I am saying that the ludicrous flapping on this subreddit from people who buy and large haven't read up on the situation is tiresome and petty.

Plenty of armchair developers who just assume that game development is a piss take and that the devs must be incompetent to not be able to fix bugs instantly. This isn't Fortnite where they have a team of over 1000 people who work regular crunch periods to slave out updates constantly, and people need to understand that the studio can't instantly transform into that without a fuck load of work, and unethical crunch that would inevitably cause a bit more than one delay to updates whilst it occurs. 
---
DBD is a small game that got lucky, BHVR were not equipped to cope with how big it got, but they've managed their best and, besides the meme, are doing a pretty good job so far.
---
Lots of comments, too tired, bed time.
---
Still though, just trying to do it though, what a dick move, I’m guessing it’s a smurf since his other account got banned doing it
---
There are three parties, really. There are people who want the game they're playing to be fun, there are toxic people/sweatlords, who differ with one wanting just to harm as many people as possible and the other wanting exclusively to win, but have enough overlap and similar net effects to be considered one party, and then there's BHVR, heavily ignoring, dismissing, or insulting much of what the playerbase has to say because they're very comfortable in their monopoly on the genre.
---
You would expect them to have a roadmap with all this plan. I don’t mind the bug fixes because it necessary but they really need to start delivering on time, cause its not the first time they start delaying things.
---
Would it have been a bigger betrayal if she 2 hooked everyone like she was 'farming' before moving on to killing?  Or maybe not so bad as then you would have gotten all of those sweet unhook points?
---
Am I.. am I reading this correctly? You have a Macmillan ledger page? Jesus Christ that's a blast from the past
---
Dbd community be like:
---
First time? :)
---
Because they constantly get it wrong. Think of it like your PDX game just with delays.
---
not my only brown/yellow map offering either. lol
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
You need to play around it. If your an swf you have no excuse. Yes it's annoying but just do gens
---
Just a placebo effect ig.
---
"I don't know what to say but your welcome!"
---
No bs tho, I normally derank myself when I want to fk around, but if you're already a 20 then I would say get some friends and try things out in a kyf? Besides that I'm sorry but that shit happens and pisses me off also
---
Survivors will weaponize DC's to get gens done. 99 a few gens, have a  guy (Probably on death hook) commit tactical disconnect, and BAM you got a gen popped for free. 
---
I'd just add DC husks so survivors can't screw the killer out of achievements.
---
This is irrelevant. Numerous killers will just proxy camp every damn hook. Numerous killers find any minor thing toxic. If the gates are powered ur getting camped. 
---
Only counter is to run anti tunnel perks like DS/Borrowed
---
They are kinda boring like moris they just end the game faster
---
It is already confirmed the game developers who are french speakers call it La Entité, and La is used for feminine beings.
---
not letting her hear survivors while phasing would be so incredibly stupid. at the cost of that they would have to make it possible for her to see bloodtrails at default because this game is incredibly sound based
---
It's an old russian lullaby "Bayu bayushki". My mom used to sing it to me
---
Lol damn haters
---
I agree. And if I get a bunch of shit tm8s that traded off hook all game or had one tm8 who DCed, it’s not a GG, fuck off with that lol. But a good, well played  1v4 without bullshit items and addons will get my GG if I die or escape
---
We don’t know if they’re doing the right thing. This delay could’ve been avoided, but we don’t know. A little transparency goes a long way in a dev-player relationship.
---
That's why they have Hex: Memeless, so you can filter them all out (but no-one seems to use it)
---
I don't know why you imagine this happening.  People want to play the game, rank up, earn points.  Survivor teams using tactical disconnects is weirdly paranoid.  Also, I don't know how you can 99 four gens in two minutes.  I can't think of any likely abuse from this rule, and it will help people in far more likely than it could possibly hurt. In any case, the disconnect helps the killer more than it does the survivor team.
---
You can also be annoyed by the delay and then make the decision to simply move on with your day. Apparently some people in this thread can't but guys it's an option
---
What about the face behind the plant?
---
I play legion and get 4ks most of the time, I don’t think that he’s bad, I think he’s hard to play. He’s really just a tracking killer with some game slowing pressure, also he greatly undermines survivors will to heal. but anyways this was about a plague rework lol
---
I mean they're a chinese company so of course they'd do that. And I see where you're coming from, but their management of their game is still a thousand times better.
---
I don't know why you imagine this happening.  People want to play the  game, rank up, earn points.  Survivor teams using tactical disconnects  doesn't strike me as likely or even a plausible strategy.  I don't know how survivors can 99 four gens in two  minutes.  Some rule like this would  help people more frequently than it could possibly hurt. Especially since the disconnect helps the killer overall.
---
Thank you, I'll try all this and more to see if I have any better luck.
---
Honestly I feel like a lore wise ash and bill would be the 2 guys because they know that they're going to get revived if they die so that they would just continue to fight The Killers by any means necessary and I mean they would probably physically try to take on the superpower behemoths to the point where they would probably be stealing their own weapons and using them against them and each other.
---
 I can just picture the tag team of ash and bill tackling the legion stealing his knife charging up to ghost face stabbing him taking his knife and then taking on Myers together only to then steal his knife and try to take on the trapper or the huntress so that they can steal  Their shit and use it on the rest of The Killers and I mean they die so what they just wake backup at the bonfire do it again
---
bill fucking obliterates baby demogorgon with just one click
---
Well done
---
I loled
---
Thanks for the info but hear me out.  
---
buffed out Meyers only in a Romper tho (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧
---
They wanted to make sure they released it with at least 2 bugs minimum this time.
---
4ks doesn't really mean they're viable tbh but I was just saying if they're gonna rework anyone there's a few choices that need it more than Plauge.
---
get ready to

“And its bubba too, its going to be easy!”

Poor bubba, everyone knows hes just a huge meme and nothing else.

Probably not the original. Rammstein doesn't have many lightshows and the headbanging seems off with the beat
---
I'm new, what is everyone waiting for??
---
What are we supposed to see here?
---
I get nervous whenever i see a killer get looped for 2mins +
---
Whenever the gates open and theres 4 still alive. I just run. The amount of times i make it out the moment before the killer dc's... Or the feeling you get when you are going a little too well...
---
I can taste the salt from here
---
Maybe he should start killing some calories...
---
Love these people who decide to be salty AF, just play the game jfc
---
You realize that hag, billy and wraith are human, right? The demogorgon is the only non-human killer
---
As a real newbie to both Survivor (Baby Dweet!) and Killer (Baby Myers!) I appreciate you. The amount of weird salt I've seen in post game already is staggering, but I'm just enjoying my game.
---
Partial counterplay.  It's only so effective.  They can always go back and pick it up or tell one of their boys in the party chat to pick it up for them.  I use Franklin's everytime I see a key but it still only partially counters them.
---
So much skill required to stand still

It completed a generator.  All of it.  0 to 100%.  Instantly.  But hey, it was one use.  AND it reduced a toolbox's base charges.  So that's balance.

You can’t drop pallets early on unsafe pallets. To make distance as a survivor, you either need to get the stun or force the killer to break the pallet.  Spirit fury + enduring completely counters that, and turns fun mindgameable pallets into “drop the fucking pallet on me, see if I care.”
---
Funny how this topic is being down voted by the killer main hive mind. Apparently they think you shouldn't be using them, even if they're being changed next patch. Classic butthurt boys.
---
I watched it first with no audio and when you 360ed I was like wtf is he 360ing?? Then I watched it again with audio and I heard the WHOOPSH lol. Good stuff

Hitting non obsession survivors gives 5% attack cooldown, stacking up to 8 times, and losing 2 stacks on hitting obsession, so dude in the meme got perma 40% cdr
---
OHHH MYYY GOOOOOD
---
We all know he doesn't just say "read", though I guess we gotta make our memes G-rated for sensitive subs
---
That’s not true at all lol. Everyone’s just a tad bit upset about the postponed update. in truth, dbd has only gotten better despite being 3 years old and there’s more players than ever playing. DBD won’t shut down for a long time
---
Maybe at the end of the match in a gesture of real world altruism, or frustration that a killer is tunneling and camping.  But I don't think teams will start entering matches to disconnect at the very beginning.  And a policy only needs to be better than the current, awful status quo, it doesn't have to be perfect.
---
no movement speed perks for survivors it makes the game even more unbalanced
---
Every sock's last word before getting vaccumed
---
no
---
Why is legion toxic? U can’t abuse them anymore, all that’s left is a bad killer
---
it doesnt heal right away or slowly, after 30(?) seconds it will heal you instantly. or you could say it takes a full 30 seconds or so for the heal to work. until then you’re in broken state
---
I inclined towards the theory of chaotic good myself but the blight lore has had me feeling Vigo is to survivers what Michael is to Killers. He is disobedient, hard to bend and always do what he desires and thus he and entity has come to an agreement and because of that while entity lets him roam free, he do certain things for entity like inventions and experiments for  blight/summer/winter events to keep things interesting and entertaining for the entity.
---
it is
---
Am I the only one who calls him ding dong
---
One shudders to imagine what inhuman thoughts lie behind that mask... what dreams of chronic and sustained cruelty?
---
The problem is that people turn their disappointment into finger pointing and insults.  Obviously if they didnt like the game they wouldn't make a fuss over it.  But it's a childish way of expressing their disappointment.
---
This would be a massive slap in the face to the people who supported the game on launch.
---
You're*

One of the buff guys should’ve been Tru3Ta1ent

Time will tell, won't it?

sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t, it just depends on the survivor’s movement

To be accurate, the Halloween event itself isn't tied to the rift since it will be just extra bloodpoints for completing themed generators and hooks. 
---
What is tied to the rift is Putrid Serum to unlock blight skins which isn't connected to the Halloween event since it will last 70 days.
---
a great post for anyone that still thinks listing Iron will/Spine chill as a counter for spirit
---
I’m talking about the gameplay mechanics are tied in, not the rift. The rift was done when the PTB released.
---
I already wanna DC from life, such a cool cosplay
---
Looking forward to it 🙂🙂
---
F13 did not get screwed by copyright. The developers used it as an excuse to leave the game because they knew they couldnt fix the mess they made. Took everyones kickstarter money and then some, and then still had the balls to double dip on a switch release lmao.
---
I experienced this playing clown, I was on the game map and one staircase would always intoxicate people who ran through it.
---
He’s precious.
---
I was killer main at beggin', then begun to play survivors and now I'm playin' both of 'em an' I can say some thing. There's perfect ammounts on pallet; survivors are often better killers than... killer; gens are FLYING. Seriously even playin' as survivour I think that are gens are repaoring literraly to fast! Ruin is must have but even this can barelery stop survivors! I've seen many games when as survivor we didn' cleanse ruin but we still managed to pop all gens... before rank 8th killer manage to make 3rd hook.
---
jUsT rUn StRiDoR
---
Aren't these perka counters to everyone technically?
---
Yes but it drops with less bugs than it would have if they didn’t take extra time. Game development is legitimately hard and bhvr isn’t AAA
---
Yea oc they are, you legit cant find a post that makes logical sense that doesn't mention perks, or scratch marks as a counter
---
I think bugs that the devs are having trouble trying to fix isn’t really the same as the rampant micro transaction exploitation that EA and Bethesda are up to
---
I've been using him recently and hes actually a lot of fun.
---
Is bum really the best insult you can come up with...
---
Or they're just fed up with BHVR's continued incompetence. It'd be different if this was an exception but it isn't, every update has these major issues without fail. Lest we forget the absolute mess that was the Legion chapter.
---
I know they don't play perfectly too but just look how more focused on the game the killer mains are. Also if SWF was playing optimally killers except maybe spirit and nurse would never win.
---
It's probably a bug. I wouldn't personally run it at all, since there are so many better perks (e.g. Adrenaline, SC, etc)
---
Is this at London Comic Con? I’m attending that today! ^-^
---
hurr durr no update hurr durr devvs bad
---
peppa should be afraid, lucina fire emblem really hates the pig family
---
What a waste of her Offering. I mean she almost didnt chase at all. And her perks are a different story...
---
Why do you care about your rank? It’s nothing special but colors and numbers.
---
Someone told me this perk was bugged yesterday before I bought the stranger things DLC.
---
I really hope a small frying pan is added as a charm.
---
This is my rule for it, too.
---
When is it being delayed till?
---
There just kinda dull when used like that. It's just a sudden end and the games over quicker. At least moris you get a cool animation
---
So he gets free speech to say his Nazi shit but we don't get free speech to tell him and his fans to fuck off?

Yeah that's about par for the course for Nazi sympathizers like you, when they're spreading their rhetoric it's just free speech but when other people tell them to go hell we're censoring them and that makes us the real Nazis!
---
A lot of ppl using just like rip in peace
---
Ash cuz he's the best
---
It's himself admitted in a twitter post that I has been having a lot less fun with the game because lately because everybody is using insta-heals. That honestly says a lot.
---
Let's be honest. BHVR does not dare create a perk to increase gen speed
---
But they won‘t because the last time they did it it was Messy. But yeah, as a pc player it‘s annoying to wait for consoles.
---
Dope!
---
&gt; It is already confirmed the game developers who are french speakers call it La Entité, and La is used for feminine beings.
---
It is not confirmed at all.
---
Every french noun is either masculine or feminine. Entité happens to be feminine.
---
how the fuck did you come to that conclusion? i want it to be released without bugs lol. literally all i’m saying is that when it comes out with the inevitable bugs and people rightfully complain about them, they’re still gonna get accused of being “entitled” and “not understanding game development”.
---
Would be neat if you needed 4 keys (so one per person) to open the hatch, because there's truthfully no reason to leave before the last gen is completed.
---
Why is it when stating that we laughed we're required to clarify that it made sound?
---
Tell that our latest big update „curtain call“
---
Looks good!!!
---
Because we usually only exhale air from our noses when laughing at memes on the internet
---
You do realize that the people working on cosmetics aren't the same people working on engine coding, yes? When something like this comes along, it's not as though BHVR can just divert more manpower to fixing it. Disappointment is understandable, but it's not the fault of the cosmetics team.
---
Yeah but I would die happy hearing his bing bong
---
Yeah I think I should've bumped her up a tier
---
Progress, as if to say it wasn't ready to go 2 weeks prior?
---
Yeah sorry for the assumption. Most people acting like you just seem to fail to understand that if the update gets released sooner, there will be overall more bugs. I consistently get people saying stuff like "yeah well who cares if it gets released sooner with more bugs because it is still gonna have them anyways." Of course they dont say exactly that but that is the basic version of what they say.
---
Saying there won't be a summer event is the same thing as saying there was never going to be an event. I don't get the point you're making. That's like them saying there's not going to be an event for Valentine's Day. That doesn't magically make it an event that existed and then didn't happen.
---
Thats what I thought. LMAO
---
I honestly just wanted to give Pig the 4K at first because I was kinda playing garbage that match lol. Then again, my teammates didn’t do anything productive the whole match so it was basically a 2v1, then a 1v1. But I’m glad she let me escape, it’s very nice and definitely made me shrug off the toxicity in this case because it didn’t really end that badly. That Pig letting me escape gave me a double pip. I have to respect the kind killers.
---
Thats really good
---
Now you know how survivors feel about ebony mori’s, which are a lot more common then keys are
---
Pills here
---
In my experience, Pig mains are some of the chillest killer mains you'll find out there.
---
While I was loading into a game once I got a call from my doctor which is obviously more important lol. I was afk for a little bit and came back to a team that DC'd or killed themselves on the first hook. The pig let me farm a little and get the hatch. 
---
After the game I apologized for being afk for a few minutes at the start and they said something along the lines of "yea I figured you had to leave for a bit for some reason so I just left you alone."
---
I wish they wouldn't be afraid to heavily penalize camping. Something like the entity putting a veil of darkness filter over their screen for staying too close for too long, or severely reduced movement. I think everyone would be way better off if they took a more heavy handed approach to dissuade camping.
---
I'd bang that
---
Can I get banned tho?
---
AMERICA BAD
---
I mean, mori's take a little longer. Chase needs to happen, getting downed etc. With keys, it's over before you can even blink.
---
Me when a Demogorgan is chasing me.
---
I'm not saying they're bad at what they do I'm just saying how they are going about it in terms of their marketing strategy in the release of the event in combination with the rift update detracted from the huge potential they have as the leading indie asymmetrical horror game of its kind during the month of October which is socially regarded as the spooky time of the year in the transition between fall and winter. Large scale I think they could've just released this event on its own to stir up publicity and then release the rift separately to create a double publicity whammy, so to speak.
---
Older maps have a lot of problems, but it's naive to pretend the newer/reworked ones are flawless. The whole preschool building is a nightmare from the killer side.
---
Money spent on designer teams could be utilized for other projects instead of leaving these bugs to multiply redirect your resources to fit popular demand to satisfy an untapped population of new players...
---
Dat feeling when your kid looks older than you.
---
No, I know someone who had done it before and he still has bbq and chili without even owning Bubba.
---
When you play Spirit, you don’t just depend on sound. You also have to predict where the players are going or what they are going to do next. Iron Will does throw me off occasionally, but not as often as people would think
---
sounds like something an ork would say lol
---
You mean "an orkeh" lol
---
I get the hate with keys but it really does go both ways in that sense, killers have to deal with keys survivors with moris and to be honest I play both and see way more moris than keys, to be fair though I feel they're both pretty op.
---
So this is how you git good, no wonder i suck, obviously !
---
You have very much improved what I think of Myers with this
---
I definitely think you can mori multiple people faster than they can get a hatch open lol
---
it's definitely not. got boring and stale QUICK
---
I might just try to do them all, since this is a new art style for me. Gotta practice ;) Altough I have absolutely no clue how I'm gonna manage the... generous curves of the clown. Or Trapper's mask ;w; \^tiny eyes
---
Ah that sucks, sorry to hear
---
Yeah? Survivors have a lot less fun when all they face is Billies and Nurses, and killers equipping ebony mori's. See how that works? It's simply idiotic to nerf a survivor instant item and not do the same to killer counters to those items.
---
Yep. Which is pathetic, because most of the time ghostface will expose you even if you're looking right at him and he's not blocked by any objects.
---
How generous of you, here take my money ! Entitled useless devs go fix your broken ass game while you at it !  Now you got time i see !
---
What did the kitty do to deserve that lol
---
Well dbd isn’t scary in general...
---
Thing is they are still working with the original code that was written when they were a small company, and this probably isn't going to be as polished as their more recent code
---
Add the Gang as Survivors the killer Mr bean and Scrappy lol
---
Idk, grabbing off hooks with my ultra instincts is very fun actually, hard to master, fun to use. 
---
Sometimes I facecamp when I understand I can't win by any other way. Survivors are usually dumb enough to try to rescue my victim instead of rushing gens which allows me to quickly snowball them.
---
It’s definitely more fun. Neither are really scary though.
---
I think what happens, or at least I hope what happens is that they just have a really bad game and they just want to be toxic. Not really an excuse but it's the only thing that makes sense because camping is only effective if the survivors are dead set on rescuing the campee. When I see a killer camping I just go do generators because I'm not going to let them win.
---
Yeah, I agree it sucks that the game ended so shortly. But mori’s do the same for the killer side and those are brought in a lot more then keys.
---
They would make a serious killing if they sold alt moris. Pun fully intended.
---
You’re a fucking apologist
---
I was about to start playing and I decided to go to this sub hoping to see an update of the event. Turns out I don't even wanna play. I'm also wondering why I'm still playing but I never been so close to stop. DBD is like an addictive drug in the sense that you think it's good, that it will help you chill out, etc. but it's actually ruining you. I mean, DBD is the last game you wanna play when you had a long day of work or just a bad day and you just want to have fun by playing a video game. At this point, I think I will just stop and pray for a another and better asymmetrical horror game to come out one day (the sooner the better). 
---
I played the game for 2 years and the old problems are still the same, or even worse. It's nice to get new cosmetics (even though most of them are kinda ugly, let's be real) every day or a licensed killer every 2/3 months, but it's not fixing the many issues the game has and that the devs doesn't seem to care about. And if you want all killer/survivors/perks, the game gets quickyly really expensive (especially for a game this broken). As a solo player, it's becoming harder and harder to find an enjoyable game, no matter if it is as a killer or as a survivor. And it's because the dev made acceptable things that shouldn't be (like all toxic behaviours you can find in almost any of your games : camp, slug, afk survivor, etc.) And should we blame the toxic players when the dev have made a gameplay where it's acceptable and way easier (it's really harder as a killer when you're fair play, especially if you're against a SWF) ? Why would they stop playing in a bully kind of way if the game let them do that ? I mean, they're selling perks to prevent camp rather than fixing these issues. Before playing DBD, I played a lot on Overwatch and every time I reported someone because of camping, or whatever similar behaviours as I described we can find in this one, something was done. Reporting something in DBD is useless (and camp is not considered as something you can report so...) And I won't even talk about the broken matchmaking. If you're not spending a LOT of hours on the game, it's impossible to find back the rank you loose every month. And as solo survivor, it's almost impossible to go to rank 1 because you will always end up in a party with someone who rage quit after one hit or a killer letting you zero chance to play (and by play, I don't mean win, just play normally). 
---
Since "Stranger Things" release, the game seems broken with me. Every two games, I have to restart the game because I get a message saying I have no internet even though my connection is fine. Three days ago, my game stayed blocked on the loading screen because someone disconnected. Same, I had to restart. I'm often losing 5 to 10 minutes because of error messages or bugs like I described. It takes me less time to find a party in F13 even though the game died almost two years ago. 
---
And now, they're posponing an Halloween event. I can't believe that they're just breaking this news like that. It's Halloween, it's the only real asymmetrical game right now on PS4 and they're the only ones with no event/update. It's just a joke at this point. They're not even at least giving us double xp even though they made a mistake (even if they're trying to blame something else).
---
You can't just throw money at a coding problem and make it go away. BHVR doesn't have enough in-house coders to reassign them on demand.
---
You can make an argument that they could spend more money hiring coders vice paying the cosmetics team, but at the same time, the most likely source of revenue to hire more coders *is* cosmetics.

It's not a personal attack on the devs. It's an attack on the development they have done, which affects their customers. When one or more game-breaking "whoopsies" happen literally every other update, (or more often) why should the customers feel like the devs care about keeping up a high standard of quality?
---
But thats the point of the killer, adding the Woosh in terror radius would be terrible. But yeah currently, the spirit honestly if busted in certain situations
---
No, it is from An American Werewolf in London
---
Nice maymay but stonetoss its a nazi
---
READY TO GET FUBAR KID?

It throws me off if the survivor has Iron Will AND moves in an unpredictable way, like stopping in the middle of the corn or the swamp plants. However, to counter that there are two options:
---
1) find a better target and "save the best for last";
---
2) try to catch him one or two times in the match with your ability, then stand still the third time to see what kind of movements he does. 
---
In general, I would say that Iron Will becomes annoying when at least 2 or more survivors have it and move in an unpredictable way. It also heavily depends on the map and the ground, It's way easier to find people walking on wood rather than normal ground.
---
Yeah, this is one of my biggest complaints against spirit. You get these no win situations which suck as a survivor, you get no options other than hope the spirit player is bad. Very frustrating. As spirit, you can do whatever you want, its all in your hands, i kinda feel guilty in these situations because i know there’s nothing they can do
---
It dropped and was leg unplayable for a lot of people. My friends and I are would be removed from the game in the middle of the game but the game would consider us still there and it would not show us DCed. I recently had 1 game that 3 people were gone within the first 3 minutes yet it showed everyone still in the game. This happened like crazy. They were having this issue in the PBT which is why they at first decided to delay it yet they went ahead and implemented it. Not to mention the other issues it has.  I would rather they actually figure out the issues first before putting it out if they are going to delay it.
---
You are not my friend. You are my brother, my friend!
---
Woah I didn’t know the game had a storyline of that kind
---
Special victims unit
---
&gt;1000 hours of standing still, staring at your monitor. Just... why?
---
How do you know that? He could be just playing differently for a match or two. He could also be a survivor main playing killer.
---
Unless somehow the rift and archives update and  upgrade of the game engine affects graphical design, why wouldn't you want to have it be two separate projects and not one potential big mess of projects? Please someone explain I am not hating I am honestly wondering.
---
This is my fav BM as survivor but really difficult to pull off because You need to unhook someone, The killer cannot hook you until EGC. You need to also make it to exit gate (if it's far away)
---
“We recently visited Behaviour’s huge office building — at last count, it had 500 employees and plans on hiring more — to talk about how Dead by Daylight made the 27-year-old company rethink its approach to creating original IP”
---
[source](https://venturebeat.com/2019/05/06/video-inside-the-massive-success-of-dead-by-daylight/) 
---
If they only had 30 people I don’t think there would even be a game.
---
I hate seeing all these. There's a reason you can see your ping before the game starts
---
Press F1 on characters next time you play the game
---
Only if you send em first
---
I haven’t played the event but I feel like after playing dead by daylight for even just a month it’s not longer scary
---
Apart from a prayer beads spirit with noed
---
Judging by those perks, I'm guessing they are new and probably haven't learnt better strategies.
---
Uhhh it isn't only on survivor rituals. Ive had it happen on a nurse hag and huntress ritual
---
Young me didn't understand that scene at all, but it still made me extremely uncomfortable
---
I’ll concede that fact yeah they have 182 working on DBD specifically and 500 total in the company
---
Betting you, right here and right now, that this update will feature a game-breaking bug or exploit that they'll wait a month and a half to fix, as well as an exploit in the Rift that they'll patch within the week.
---
Well, if you played dbd enough this game is not scary anymore, unlike New gamemoden in siege, i shit my pants so many times when 5 crazy peoples starts running after me.
---
OMG flashlights need to be nerfed, how am I supposed to avoid that?
---
Franklin's Demise. Survivors waste a lot of time trying to get their keys back because you can't see the bloody things once they have been dropped, particularly in long grass. Or they just have to abandon them. Win win.
---
It is a blood point event. You get extra bloodpoints for completing special gens and hooking people on special hooks. (In the last few events it was around 3,500 and 4,500 bloodpoints for each of these actions) During the event you get offerings in the bloodweb with which you increase the number of these gens and hooks in the trial. I know exactly what I said. I never said anything about the bloodhunt.
---
We’re on the same boat, except that I’m in France. Stay strong.
---
lmao what a thing to say
---
Some of them hates you if you think the devs are doing okay. I joined this community because I wanted to see people sharing fun things from the game with each other not war.
---
&gt; The Entity is often designated as of female gender.
---
straight from DBD wiki
---
Has she always had a Joker-like chin? Thing's massive.
---
I can get one in a matter of seconds, but as a solo survivor? Sometimes I'll be waiting for 5-10 minutes....
---
That's a side bonus some events don't even have this feature like the moonrise events, the main event is the unique rewards like the cosmetics that you can get from them not the bonus in bloodpoints, would you rather get a cosmetic that could cost a fuck tone of iri or auric cells or some extra bloodpoints. Besides if one of the components in the event won't work unless the event is released with another feature then my original point still stands your counter argument in general is invalid.
---
Just had a game where i pulled the obsession out of a locker and killed them with 7 tokens left
---
Next practice some Wraith cloaking
---
how lazy are they? I mean their is 100 people working on this game! where is all their effort going to? Star Wars battlefront two has just 7 people working and their content is all 100% free and on par with this game. what the fuck
---
michael throws the pallets down early and then grabs the other killers face and smashes them on it till they don't move anymore... kinda like he did in Halloween 2018 but with a pallet
---
Not from my experience.
---
Sure ; )
---
Pretty sure its just been ported.
---
BTW: i'm in no way a cosplayer or anything, this was just a fun passion project i was working on!! it was supposed to be for pax, but when i was told there would be a contest at the party i was going to, i rushed to finish, so it's not completely accurate... but i still wanted to share :D also can someone let me know if i tagged the wrong flair? lol
---
He was bad. There was literally no possible way he could have played properly as a killer for even a tenth of that time, much less the actual 1,000 hours. Even if he were a survivor main and this were somehow his first killer game, he'd know how to chase better than that from picking up how to do it by being a survivor, no, he has to have been facecamping for an embarrassing percentage of that 1,000 hours, unless it was his li'l bro playing or something
---
That isn't me, thats DBD wiki, go fight with them
---
*heavy breathing*
---
RIP 2019 release
---
Me too buddy
---
I am just telling you my source up there, not I am right and you r wrong
---
I like how Hide or Die came out and you hear nothing about it. An so many DbD streamers looked at it too.
---
That'd be feasible but I don't have FD for most of my killers I main. Hasn't showed up in the shrine of secrets recently and I don't have bubba leveled up enough to get it reachable, don't like playing him that much.
---
This pic is emitting a strange aura
---
That's not a side bonus, it is the event. Cosmetics are already in the game. What's here so hard to understand? I already told you that the  rift lasts longer than the event. You will get the vials well past the event is over. Your original point would stand if this was last years but they changed stuff. Again, I know exactly what and how I said it. I'm correct and no amount of twisting your words will change that. please stop.
---
How hard is it for you to admit that you are wrong?
---
Yes :(
---
I am the Blendette and Nea 
---
:(
---
&gt;He was bad. There was literally no possible way he could have played properly as a killer for even a tenth of that time, much less the actual 1,000 hours.

---
I know a lot of people with that amount of hours or way higher and they play like this from time to time for the memes or to derank despite knowing how to play "properly".
---
&gt; Their Q&amp;A
---
If they do one, $100 says they announce that due to unforseen problems on their end they won't be releasing a Q&amp;A.
---
I only play killer. Survivor is just boring for me tbh
---
She's getting a piggy back ride from the invisible man.
---
i really like it !!! good job man 🤙🏻
---
By the eay the three buff mans are david bill and ash
---
I already did, what you want a written apology for knowing only 1 source that is perhaps wrong?? Lol
---
So you use sources and don't check their validity?
---
You don't work at Wall Street by any chance do you?
---
Blood points are already in the game but the cosmetics are more valuable, the rift starts after the event ends in the original schedule the only way to get serums confuckingfirmed by behaviour is in the rift as such the event objective to get serums would be impossible to complete. I am not twisting your words i don't remember even quoting you.
---
"Lets protect the devs they're trying their best," - the community.  
---
The devs: eating the absolute Spaghetti code they have.  
---
But nooo it's hard to make a good game so we should just hold the devs at a low standard based on the fact that we expect nothing more.  This is like the only game who can't role out a patch without breaking something.
---
gg means "good game". Saying good game if it wasn't a good game is like saying "ez" when you barely escape as survivor.
---
I have loads lol. I guess if I'm survivor I hate fully immersed teammates that cant take their pinky off the crouch button and I hate self care purely because 9/10 times people prioritise it over moreen important things. I love self care when I play killer though. 
---
As killer I hate ruin getting found in 2 seconds because it's spawned in a shitty spot.
---
I actually do wish they had some good competition.We would actually get some good updates
---
puppy
---
Yes but I think you play killer more than survivor (at least it sounds like that) and of course you wont see moris unless you bring them in lol
---
Because SB prevents you from running till you want to use it then if you get in a chase while you're exausted, oops. You've lost that great head start the perk gives you. Or you walk around the entire map and spend more time getting to a gen than it takes to complete it.
---
Lithe is just activated on a window vault which are used a lot in loops and can make a lot of distance, with the window and then the movement speed increase.
---
No, it's just that he's defending a Killer that made the Survivor think he was letting them go, then proceeding to kill them and teabag. Just kill them and get it over with.
---
Just don't be scared of the killer,think about how survivors loop you and stuff,try to replicate that
---
Yes it is allways active
---
With Behavior's track record, it'll still end up being a rushed crashy mess. Not to mention heavily buggy.
---
They'd still go down though, so I guess it doesn't matter. Since they have to be injured anyways to grab them.
---
How do you make these
---
THE DEMODOG IS ON THE LOSE AGAIN!! JUSTINNNN!!!!!!!
---
I always find it funny when a Spirit/Nurse/Billy etc camp. It's like, all that map coverage you have as that killer and you stay in one spot? Yeah top tier gamer right there....
---
thank you!😁
---
I'm not saying there shouldn't be a way to escape, but the current way is flawed and is based purely on chance rather than skill on either party. As of right now somebody can hide the whole game, wait for their team to die, and then be given a free escape with the hatch. If they bring a key as well, the only thing a killer can do is hope that they dont know where it is as there is no counter play with a key.
---
So you are annoyed by survivors escaping much easier but nt annoyed by killers getting kills much easier. Got ya fam.
---
Only just stumbled across this post, and yikes, what a mess of assholes in these comments.
---
Keep on doing what you're doing. Video made me laugh, cosplay looks great, and it's miles better than the same meme template shit that always appears on this sub.
---
I agree with this, especially because first hook moris lead to tunnelling. Keys are cheap too don't get me wrong, but at least survivors have to do gens for them to be useful.
---
You are not just a clown, but the entire circus.
---
Seeing Legion disowned made me laugh.
---
Nah sometimes if a survivor is toxic I love ruining his game by camping him
---
You may think oh ill do gens to make him lose but you dont realise my goal that game is to make the cunt survivor and possibly his swf on com get salty and whine so I won
---
Only sometimes and vs very toxic cunts I love it
---
Normal games merciless killer so I stay at red ranks
---
Can't wait to be carrying jane
---
It Is London MCM ywah, I'm cosplaying Wolf from Payday 2 today though, might be Bill again tomorrow!
---
That's why they call it "practice" ha ha
---
why isn't he uploading ?
---
I need entertainment
---
I sing like cats fuck. You're welcome.
---
Is the quote at the bottom a scooby-doo reference because that was not what i was expecting
---
Yeah same, I'm just Wolf this time!
---
I'm a magician. I can make this happen.
---
Nah man toxic fricks deserve that I do it too, I mean starting every game with the default tactic of going for one survivor and staring at them for three minutes until death.
---
Fuck you too 🤔
---
a baby dweet ?
---
always remember to do gens
---
Salty killer mains.
---
😛
---
Oh yeah that is pure terrible. Its boring and beginner level idk with those 99% they are running NOED too
---
Yeah no fair enough
---
What a shit meme, should've just made it a serious discussion post
---
This actually made me laugh out loud and i know i shouldn't have. Kudos.
---
No problemk
---
You did a great job, it looks amazing.
---
Yeah, Bubba is proper low tier. I ended up playing other killers to level his blood web because I wasn't having fun.
---
i'm a survivor main, i rarely ever touch killer unless i'm having fun with my friends in kyf. i only play survivor because i simply suck at playing as a killer and it makes it incredibly unfun to play, which is why i have to disagree with this post. i read all patch notes and then dive straight into a game observing the killer, imo it's all i need to know. you would have to be very ignorant to not notice changes on the other end when you're a survivor/killer main, that or you're just starting off.
---
I kinda want a baby killer now
---
Hitboxes have been broken for years. They arent good devs.
---
Asking for the product you paid for to be functional is entightled.
---
And it kinda makes sense tbh, like the Survivor is literally charging forward fueled by adrenaline... B I G B R A I N
---
all good it's the cathedral
---
Oh yeah, cause Survivors totally don't need to get gens done for hatch to spawn
---
Michael must be feeling some Thrilling Tremors
---
Yeah but where is vigo in all of that
---
The BNP in the game rn is 1 use still, 0-100 isn’t balanced at all
---
"Huge guy entraps a cute red head with his charm"
---
That doesn't change anything. 
---
This is on par with Riot pulling Clash at the last minute.
---
They planned this well in advance, did a full PTB, announced the event... and then shat the bed.
---
We're used to fuckups, but this is just unprofessional.
---
Why is Vigo?
---
&gt; It's more of a useless feature currently
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; How often do you see someone actually suffer anything from it rather than just spending 10 seconds to mend?
---
How is it useless? You force someone to spend 10s doing nothing before they are able to heal. If you are in Deep Wound you can't be healed to healthy by Adrenaline, can't use instaheals on yourself, can't be healed to healthy by Inner Strength. 
---
Also I find it funny that people suggest Thanatophobia to killers despite this perk only adding 12s to a solo generator at level 3 with 4 stack (4 people not healing) but suddenly having to mend for 10s is useless. Where is the coherency.
---
A 1 a 2 and whatever comes after 2, here comes the trapper ya better whach out for his traps here comes the trapper don't step into his traps do do step in, what els rymes with traps, maps? hubcaps? gingers naps! Ow now I'm Hungry, all rite. Here comes the trapper ya better whach out for his traps here comes the trapper ya eat some ginger snaps, the trappeeeeeerrrrrrrr, jaz jaz hands
---
Sorry for any bad spelling
---
what's bad about memes tho.
---
I still like his humor alot and he doesn't get carried by the game he is playing. 
---
he himself is entertaining to watch.
---
like when he occasionally plays other games aswell
---
Well Its entirely fucking useless is the main reason.
---
well its a man who wants to look like a woman, spends probably all his money and makeup, demands to be called female, acts like a disabled kid, looks like a doofus, everyone around him has to call him her or else he will start freaking out just like you
---
oh yeah plus trans suicide rate is very high and they get treated like they are disabled wonder what that means
---
Survivor main actually. Sherlock strikes again.

Guys i am in this forest and there is somone hanging on this hook
---
I'm mad at the developers for different reasons.  The most recent one being how dedicated servers are total shit.  I am sick and tired of constantly being fucked out of grabbing survivors off gens/windows.  It's like they've decided to delete zero TR builds.  Shit servers will roll me back after I've already picked someone off a gen.  On the survivor side there were never enough laggy killers to ever care about them hosting the games.  Same for the one in a hundred lag switchers.
---
My point is people need to stop stressing because they are doing their best!
---
I disagree with how you view the team effort of the survivors. They all have the same goal and objectives, just like any other team based game. As an individual, if you perform better than your team but still lose, I do not think that you should have a free personal victory given to you just because you didnt have the best teammates. That's how team games work. Nobody is getting their own personal victories on overwatch just because they had 1 bad teammate that cost them the game. As the killer, you have only yourself to depend on, but also have much more to juggle. Asymmetrical games like this are difficult to balance since we cant compare one side to the other. I agree that a chance should be given, but a free getaway mechanic is something I cannot agree with.
---
I’m well enough equipped to handle these demons. Thanks you.
---
Honestly, when I see people at cons dressed up as Bill i ask them "wow that's a cool looking cosplay, who is it?" and most of the time the response is "Bill from Dead By Daylight"
---
I get the character has gotten a raise in popularity because of that game but still.
---
How would a chainsaw react to a shield?
---
Indeed, According to your 29th comment, you are a Killer main who "refuses to be jumpscared by a baby Dwight"
---
Happy birthday!
---
I am not fighting anyone, I am educating you. You've learnt something new today! For free even! I'll even give you an upvote, you must be starving for karma if you feel like you have to delete your comments.
---
insta heals arent the same as moris.  but if u replaced insta heals with the word key then I would love for both to be gone
---
A lot can change in a fortnight buddy
---
I disagree with your review on IDV.  I think it looks better than DbD.  I like their aesthetic a lot honestly.  Dbd goes for creepy and realistic but ~~as someone who plays with maxed setting on PC~~ honestly falls way short.  The characters are emotionless and/or inhuman, and the hair usually looks awful.  The killers look decent, I suppose.  Maps are very grainy, and could use updated textures imo. IDV goes for cartoony but serious and they nail it.  
---
  
---
I don't think DbD would die if it was ported over. DbD has a monopoly on the genre for the sheer fact theyve got 5 of the most iconic slasher characters, most likely in exclusivity. IDV has cool stuff as well (like the Persona 5 crossover, or the Junji Ito Witch) that you and I may find really cool, but I dont think the general public is as keen on
---
This is the most dramatic and furthest from reality post that has ever been made on this sub, lmao
---
Insert obvious Ruin/BBQ and chili
---
Stridor’s good to be able to hear survivors during phase walk easier, it’s kinda like training wheels on spirit. And then there’s a lot of perks you can run on her if you want, try to avoid the chasing perks though cuz she’s already good at that. So PGTW, Discordance is a favorite of mine on a LOT of killers, Surveillance, Nurse’s Calling, Sloppy Butcher, monitor and abuse, Haunted Ground, make your choice, they’re all good perks. 
---
As for addons, if you wanna be a giant asshole run mother/daughter ring and prayer bead necklace and basically enjoy your free 4ks because that add on setup with some good tracking perks like discordance or surveillance is fucking stupid as shit and has 0 counterplay without spine chill. If you wanna be a Normal person, the white ribbon and hair brooch are great addons and combining those 2 with a build like BBQ/Ruin/Pop/Make Your Choice you have a solid spirit build that will win games and not make you feel like you’re cheating.
---
The Plague Doctor and his fake pallets
---
The Clown: *exists*
---
&gt;Well Its entirely fucking useless is the main reason.
---
Its not useless. At the very least it forces a survivor to do nothing for 10s.
---
I mean this is cool and all but even after being delayed the patch is still a buggy shit fest
---
Idk man... getting strangled to death by Sally and getting carressed the moment of your death doesn't seem too bad to me lol
---
Brah, you do know Michael myers is the embodiment of evil right? He is the human personification of pure evil. Sooo these cosmetics wouldn't make any sense to the license
---
Well fuck.  That's amazing
---
All 3 of them together could do it
---
Ash joining MK11 is going to re enforce this hard.
---
it's not "free" tho. You can close the hatch and get the chance to kill the survivor at the gates. 
---
About Keys they are one of those unbalanced items both sides have on this game.
---
He's definitely no Watson.
---
When the drunk Scottish cyclops stills your Thompson Family Moonshine
---
I'd dare to say that the issue is with the people that actually define which of the "whoopsies" are actually dramatic and which not.
---
Survivors exploiting spots which make them invulnearable, Killer using Survivor perks, save states being messed up etc. , all of those example is something I'd definetly call worth ranting about, but on the other hand, besides of the save state issues, they fixed most of the exploitable bugs and glitches as soon as possible.
---
The save state thing is something that should've never ever happened in the first place, don't get me wrong, that's the one where even I am saying "okay, the fucked up bad".
---
But the whole community ranting about a patch being delayed due to issues, regardless of it being a halloween event or not, is just not something I can see being criticized in a justified manner. It's almost a little shit storm we have here in total. I understand that the patch is fuckin' huge and important, all of us are impatient to play it, but honestly? It's nothing worth to "rip open these wounds" again. Ofcourse that's a each-their-own situation. Just stating my personal opinion on this.
---
IDV will definitely need a graphics update dont get me wrong, I just mean each game compared to others on their system, Im much more hesitant to call Dbd ~~adequate~~ good.  Hell, just compare the 2 mobile games.  
---
I feel like bhvrs "handling of the game" has been overdramatized a bit.  Theyre definitely not the best, but I dont feel like theyve done anything that bad.  This community is just so toxic most the time theyre ready to flame anyone for anything.  For example, with the recent blight drama, they literally had an engine update and shit went downhill, so they postponed because their were bugs. People had been complaining for months because theyd release stuff with bugs. Then they said "at least give us a reason why postponed jeez". Well, go check that post. More shit just yelling at bhvr for being being bad at making games ~~which was why they delayed the patch, so they could fix it~~  People like to get mad at stuff, I guess.  
---
Anyways, I think having Mike, Freddy, etc would outweigh for a lot of people, honestly, so I dont think it even can die at this point
---
Were you playing on PC or Console?
---
Franklins isn’t a counter cos as soon as they get off hook they run back and pick it up again🤪
---
BG
---
If they play like dribblers, imma hook them.
---
Nobody payed for an event.
---
Console
---
If you keep on making excuses for the devs then they have no reason to improve.
---
What. What happend to my poor girl?
---
-Concerned Pig Main asking
---
Because bitching every single day like it's god's will or something helps nobody in the end. Also it doesn't help people flood this reddit the moment they are given an excuse, it's so depressingly negative and hard to escape seeing such posts.
---
I’m a spirit main and I don’t run stridor because I feel it makes her too easy and broken. If the survivors use iron will to counter me then I deserve to work a little harder to catch them. I find stridor spirits pretty skill-less honestly... she doesn’t need it to do well and with it she’s brainless
---
It's entirely based on chance. There is no skill behind it. If they both end up at the hatch at this current point in time, survivor gets away and there was nothing the killer could do. It's not particularly hard to find hatch on most maps, and certain maps it spawns in a few select spots most of the time. The only way for a killer to gain advantage is slugging and hope to find the last person. I would hardly call the scenario balanced gameplay.
---
I’m gonna brainstorm possible solutions today at work. If I think about it long enough a good solution will come to mind. You mentioned blindness which also came up in my mind. Blind then for 5-10 seconds and give some sort of cue to the other survivors
---
Maybe it's got to do with the fact that they are instituting essentially two games in one as the killer has completely different controls/POV than the survivors do and make that work in tandem. 
---
Also the ridiculousness of assuming that all games will operate and be managed the most effectively the exact same way is naïve at best. 
---
You don't have to work in game development to understand that.
---
Pc player, looking for friends to survive with. I play most days at random hours since I work nights. Hmu.
---
So basically when you talk about killer without also saying they need buffs
---
These guys need to realize their game is getting popular and popular and they're not anymore a small company with a pretty unknown game. They can't fuck up a Halloween event for a horror game just because this is the biggest update and they encountered unforseen issues. I do unsterstand that shit happens sometimes but doing absolutely nothing for Halloween it's not good at all. Giving us a few days of 2x BPS would make us happy and doesn't require a big effort.
---
Who is this weird looking person and where's this from?
---
Because Killer makes people frustrated so they become salty and play like dicks and then survivors get salty and group up with friends after being camped or tunneled and then they beat the shit out of some killer and then that killer gets salty and mad cause he got his shit kicked in so he starts being a cunt. It just goes round and round
---
Vigo's shroud, vigo's jar of salty lips, etc etc read the quotes and description beneath that
---
I am Incredibly f a s t, sorry.
---
Kinkshaming is my kink!
---
What came first - The toxic killers or the toxic survivors?
---
Haven't they released a pc port? Or was that the emulator you were reffering to?
---
thats fine but I would farm them. Usually if Im going against people I feel confident against I just smash them for points
---
Yeah happend to me too once.
---
What work is there to do?
---
I'm about to end this Killer's whole career.
---
It doesn't really matter. It's like being a kid and saying "BUT SHE STARTED IT!" Both sides just feed off the hate. You know who gets hurt in this? None Sweaty killers and Solo survivor players. LMAO
---
What? That's so bizarre; you should be ashamed. ^^^^/s
---
I only nod as killer when I am being friendly; I let people go sometimes and egg the survivors on by nodding as they work on gens/open the gates.
---
I had one really bad game as Michael on the game; I was doing a daily, to level up Evil Within 4 times, and 2 people DCd very early into the game. I let the last two people farm some points, do gens, and I stalked them just for the daily.
---
Dude, that's a better work than most of what bEhavior releases. Well, disregarding the Stranger Things ones. Those were solid, for once.
---
ginger snaps
---
You use it when your loop time frame closes so you can get to the next loop without getting hit or wasting the pallet in the first. It‘s a loopsaver
---
i guess ? i only move the mouth a bit for create a smile
---
Survive With Friends
---
Ahh makes sense thank you
---
Everyone is gonna be next !
---
at least i'm gonna try ^^'
---
Is there a suggestion box? This is a great idea
---
I’m glad someone can relate to my pain.
---
Insta
---
oh bb Y u gotta tell everyone tho......
---
You're welcome my friend. Good luck on your first matches.
---
This is awesome!
---
bruh the nurse floats, and those screeches would freak me out! also, huntress is like 7 feet tall+ isn’t she? i would shit my pants 😂
---
I just want the devs to improve and this isn't the way to go about it.
---
I know nothing about their other game and I am surprised they even bother seeing as how DBD, I would think, is the more promising game to keep running.
---
I always say ggwp no matter if I get a 4k or a 0k. Even if I'm actually thinking "omg that was so fucking easy" in my head I'll say ggwp bc I dont like being toxic to people
---
Holy shit bro what you got in that pumpkin to make it so bright a nuclear reactor? Looks nice btw
---
the people who took time off from work have every right to bring a pitch fork.
---
You are a true god among men.
---
Thanks I hope it's not a myers lol
---
Ib4 board and wall behind breaks on throw
---
The wrong sort of attention, though.
---
I think they are the same person
---
No lol. Stridor is my go to perk on spirit it counters iron will.
---
Why? Money, of course. That's the only reason for it. They're probably having to go through some extra hoops in order to get the Rift accepted on consoles.
---
There's literally no reason why to lock the Halloween skin progress behind the Archive and Battle Pass if it wasn't to entice people to play with their new toy.
---
I bet OP frequently posts in r/kappa
---
Who the fuck is Vigo I just wanna know
---
What scene ?
---
Sauce please ?
---
The Halloween event is bad, but nobody would mind if this was a one off.
---
The problem is that our patience is already wearing thin. 
---
* The last hallowed blight broke the game entirely. 
---
* It took them two years to stop DS from breaking the game. 
---
* They released Mettle of Man and thought "this is balanced"
---
* They released Legion, a killer with no redeeming qualities for anybody involved, and then just up and removed their power once people had already bought the chapter. Maybe they'll fix em eventually but don't hold your breath. 
---
* They released Ormond, a map  where scratches are invisible depending on the patch. 
---
* They have nerfed Pig *multiple times* despite how she's never been any more than Mediocre.  
---
* They released a *matte black Claudette shirt* and saw nothing wrong with that. 
---
* Earth tones and Prestige Claudette still gives better invis than Wraith.
---
* In a game where a single pallet break buys a survivor  18.8 seconds, it only takes the other three 3 minutes to end the game. 
---
* It took them two years to fix a bug that literally let survivors teleport.
---
* They released Freddy weak and then nerfed him. 
---
* Instead of fixing the version of Freddy we'd gotten used to, maybe giving him a secondary ability for map mobility,  they just up and removed him entirely and replaced him with a killer where sleep isn't even all that important to his gameplay. 
---
* They thought the new Freddy's add-ons were acceptable. 
---
* They nerfed Plague between her PTB and her release for some damn reason. 
---
* They nonchalantly made Prayer Beads OP for no damn reason.
---
* They broke Legions blade add-ons and, instead of disabling the add-ons,  they just threatened to ban anybody who used the combo.
---
* In a patch meant to make Wraith quieter in stealth,  they actually made him louder. 
---
* Trapper and Wraith have been out for three years, have received two significant changes apiece since then, and are both still complete trash.
---
* Doctor is a trainwreck that is only kept "afloat" (if you can call it that) by the band aid patch they made a couple months after his release.
---
* Doctor still can't aim along a vertical axis.
---
* Myers can literally be staring at somebody's head and not gain any progress towards his power.
---
* Clown and Bubba were greenlit with their kits that are so clearly half complete. 
---
* They refuse to make survivors unique from one another simply because they've got no idea how to balance them. 
---
* Most maps are still pretty bad. The only ones that are really good are preschool and Hawkins.
---
* Haddonfield is still so bad that killers just leave if you burn a Strode Key.
---
* They nerfed Remember Me because.... because.
---
* They keep "fixing" things with new perks instead of actually fixing the game. 
---
* They made the *intentional change* to let survivors make flashlight and pallet saves while the killer was in the middle of an animation. I don't care that they reverted it, they thought this would be a good change.
---
Honestly they're in a lose/lose situation at this point. If they delay the patch to make it run as smooth as possible people will complain about waiting. If they push it out early then people will complain about bugs.
---
Probably second wind cuz I like the perks idea alot
---
Same here
---
I'm a simple man... If I gets da prayer beads ima use em, sorry about it :)
---
&gt;They really should not have merged the events together
---
Maybe they're gonna learn from it this time.
---
haha.
---
🤤🤤

---
This is incredible !
---
An some love his monster size toes.
---
Their roadmap shows that there will be 6 weeks between a new chapter and mid-chapter. If you take a look at the calendar, you'll see that the 6th week is actually the next week. This is for mid-chapter update obviously. "But how about the event? They anounced on 22nd."  Yeah that's true, but they want to release them at the same time with one update.  The reason why I believe they want to mix the event and the mid-chapter update together is because of the console's certification. Both event and mid-chapter updates are quite big updates seperately, and I believe they didn't want to go through the certification process twice in one week basically.
---
Also them being professionals don't mean that they can't make a mistake. They are not robots, they are human beings. Talking as an outsider is easy. If you were working there, I bet you'd resign after a month or two due to all of these "unhappy customers" even though you gave your 110% all the time and try to make the game better for those customers.
---
See I was understanding what you were talking about, but then you go and add "lol" at the end. why? What made you laugh out loud? I just cant take anyone seriously if they end with "lol".
---
No. Just follow the killer until he close hatch then jump straight in
---
If you have been with behavior since the beginning I can see why this would be frustrating, but you also need to appreciate how far they have come and grown. I wait so long for the huntress to come on console back in the day. Remember the Freddy issues? I can’t believe that the last few chapters have gone as smoothly as they have.
---
This is just a political compass meme.
---
Yeah guys come on! They're doing a pretty good job so far.
---
I can't take anyone serious that's gonna throw away valid points because someone said lol. Now I'm writing lol at you as a person. Good job.
---
You need to stop sucking BHVR off so much or they'll become the next Bethesda
---
Maybe, but I still think they should try to keep such huge nerfs quiet next time.
---
I was pretty confused why you tried that in outfits like these lol
---
I don’t know man. I think the update of the engine was necessary. I don’t know why, but things have been much better since that update.
---
Not really. Just makes this reddit community look like a bunch of bullies
---
I understand that, but I think that would be better then what we currently have going on. I'm not a high rank survivor, but I assume that most high rank survivors are going up against a lot of nurses with their best add ons. I think if neither nerfs were announced it would've been good for both sides, but I guess others don't think so.
---
Nah they don‘t land on their feet
---
that's not bill its castro
---
Simple fix; BHVR needs to stop announcing so damned early. Just put the bew patch on the PTB like three days prior and make delays if there are any massive issues otherwise it's all Gucci
---
Yeah I mean, this should have been announced after a little time in the PTB. 
---
I literally checked my phone at 11pm at work on the 21st, and that last-minute message just sucked. I was so hyped.
---
But I get that there were complications. It’s worse because the whole “Halloween” feel is only present for so long. At this rate, we’re going to be stretching well into November for the events duration.
---
&gt;Maybe, but I still think they should try to keep such huge nerfs quiet next time.
---
I don't think its possible. We had to test the new instaheals to see how they would be and give feedbacks to devs. A lot of people believe styptic got buffed, for example.
---
Getting slugged. Getting killed in the first minute? Fine, shake it off, move on. Doing nothing for five minutes because the killer has more time to waste than me? It's just rude and inconsiderate. On days where I can't deal with it, like I only have an hour of free time, I have to slap on No Mither.
---
Lol It‘s kinda the same with me
---
The way they handled it on social media was awful , didn’t make much sense and felt very unprofessional
---
u/Invisibleagents
---
Such talent, much wow.
---
true, he didnt at least give a smile on his first appearance on his first stream, leaved me with a VERY bad impression, especially when you're supposed to communicate with a community he must be a jr Community Manager.
---
My next holidays are in fucking 9 weeks
---
Yeah don't get me wrong, I cosplayed Bill for a DBD group but I've always been a fan of L4D, so I'm glad I got round to cosplaying him.
---
PWYF
---
That Is Payday 2 Wolf but I'm changing into Bill at like 3.
---
There was a Nurse and a Wraith doing that matching opera set thing yesterday.
---
I suck at survivor but there some filthy loops there, I don't really know how, but I don't usually get it as killer so when I get it I just cry and try to get some bps
---
waeet
---
When? I got there at 11am and left at 5pm
---
Can someone tell me what's the name of the original meme please?
---
im abit confused by this? if your already playing as the pig but have an add on like that what does it mean?
---
Ehhh, I disagree
---
My boi Michael 😂
---
That would be an awesome April fool's event. Those 4 are the only "killers" and the killers and nea are the survivors. Would be hilarious seeing a game of killers running away from Bill or any other survivor.
---
Added dance emotes in dbd
---
I'm guessing light is on the survivors side as a reference to Nea
---
n... no it doesnt buddy
---
Working on dedicated servers, Archives, Hallowed Blight Event, all for one patch. Yet years ago we were begging for things like this. So how about appreciate their work and that they can’t meet such short standards. Either way it’s a Halloween event, so it’s better getting it closer to Halloween.
---
Oh absolutely. I just meant what I said: A flat GG will come off as disingenuous for the team that was demolished because it definitely wasn't a good game for them. So the winner can keep his GG to his own thoughts instead of rubbing his victory in their faces. This goes for any friendly competition btw, not just DBD.
---
Nice work, the shading is really really well done! Are you planning on doing any other killers?
---
Iridescent head next time please
---
The all caps "oof" with an exclamation point says a lot about you
---
Can I have some more details?
---
It's not a lie or a strawman, it's possible I just misunderstood his idea, or you right now.You don't have to assume the worst intent right off the bat... I really like Tru3ta1ent and he's the reason I bought this game, I watched him for months before purchasing, but that doesn't mean I have to agree with him.
---
Is that quote a Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed reference??
---
God. You really are pathetic, aren't you?
---
Second panel should have just said "missed skill check on an inactive trap." For it to make sense but ok.

Oh my god I'm so jealous!
---
Have you maybe thought about the fact that the Trans folk suicide rates are this high because of people like you treating queer people like shit? 
---
Also, Trixie is a man in a wig that plays a character, he’s not Trans.
---
I mentioned Friday the 13th.
---
All he wanted this whole time was a little bit a love
---
Man all this fanbase knows how to do is cry, if the event was rushed and released 5 days ago y'all would be even angrier at them but now that they are taking their time to release a at least playable update y'all fucking throw tantrums
---
Lol you wrote the utter garbage post you wrote and now you want to pretend to have an intelligent discussion about it?  
---
The game being a fucking mess is an opinion not a fact.    I very much like the game and recognize just how far it's come over the last year in particular.
---
Each update has created more issues.  Again your opinion not a fact.  Each update regularly includes a ton of bug and qol feature updates to improve the game.  Do they break shit sometimes?  Sure but they fix it.
---
The devs have no interest in making the game better they profit off of bad game design.  Absurdly stupid opinion not a fact.  Devs continue rebalancing several aspects of the game to make it more enjoyable particularly for killer who was underpowered for a long time but is finally starting to feel much more balanced these days.
---
You said fuck the shit community.  Again this shit community doesn't want you a part of it if your stance is fuck us, fuck the game and fuck the devs.  That's the hat trick of your time has past playing this game and you should really move on since you don't enjoy anything about it at this point aside from getting off to the sound of your own voice complaining about it.
---
You talk about you touching a nerve with me yet who is the one that continues trying to get me to respond to them?  Is this why you don't leave the community lol?  So you can try to convince others to hate it as much as you do.  Just move on man.  If you don't like it don't play it.  There's literally no reason for you to stay here.  You don't want to and we don't want you to.
---
The real question is how do you remember your username lol
---
Jane Mains want to know your location.
---
Sorry, but that's ridiculous.
---
I would agree that some maps make Balanced useless. But other maps you create infinites with balanced and the recovery is from drops is a massively underrated passive. 
---
Sure DH is very strong, but it isn’t hard for killers to bait it. That combined with it sometimes just not working (thanks dedicated servers) makes it not so great for me. Sure, you’ll use it for distance, well only when you’re injured, you get a 1 time lunge to make it to a pallet/vault. 
---
Better than Balanced, absolutely not. But I rate them the same, certain situations will suit each perk better. They’re both really good.
---
Hey dumbo. I said fuck the devs, fuck the community, and fuck the chickens. Never said fuck the game. How many times do you need to read my post before you get it right?
---
Op is what i think
---
Uh no it’s extremely well understood that it’s backhanded. Especially in Tru3’s case who regularly leaves the chat without saying anything if he doesn’t do well
---
Hetzelfde hier in Nederland
---
Finally some one who fucking gets it
---
LMAO, you're right!
---
Good god you’re stupid
---
A season of noobs means more activity and players
---
More activity and players means more money
---
More money means more content
---
Also I hope for a new original Killer and The Alien
---
Why would I change the subject because you had valid points? This is not a competition. I just cant take an adult seriously if they write "lol" randomly.
---
We had 1 summer event, that being the Scorching BBQ. But no, we were never promised a second Summer Event. Its just the player base being entitled as always.
---
Lol auto-response? He regularly doesn’t gg when he loses
---
Gg wp you Will get better practice makes king don't give up pal!
---
Yeah maybe you're right. Still really annoying to face them every game lol
---
32 C is considered hot?   
---
Thats just over normal here, funny
---
Thanks for the Tip. But something dumb like that should just never happen.
---
It's not specifically, i always get russians, i check their profiles and it's always them. They really love to annoy others in every possible way.
---
Agreed.
---
Because I never see baby Demogorgons on lower ranks, only baby Steves and Nacys
---
Me in the middle of drinking apple juice when a ruin skillcheck appears: desperately hits the space bar and gets a hex skill check
---
Me focusing on the skillchecks: fails the ruin skillcheck
---
But you havent used "lol" since I mentioned it. It's nice to see, baby steps and all that.
---
One of UwUs!
---
I am sorry but that's not going to cut it. If it was a 1-time issue sure but this game has been a buggy mess from the jump. There are so many constant bugs that happen so many times it's to the point it's laughable saying they are doing their best. If that is their best maybe they need to hire better workers or something.
---
Think about this one batman, Then you could just keep stunning because I'm fairly sure the stun is a little bit more than 3 seconds
---
Hmmmm your really went with something catchy and instantly recognizable that rolls off the tongue huh?
---
I have always said the xenomorph from alien should be in the game.
---
You really wanna go there little man? Your entire life is a lol and this is proving it. How can you function in the real world? You clearly don't
---
Head on should have a cooldown like dance with me, quick and quiet ect. shouldnt cause exhaustion
---
I can’t understand why it’s happening at the same time as an engine update
---
And stop speaking for the community you fucking idiot. Are you mayor of this subreddit?
---
Some sad twats on this forum start making pathetic posts about how everyone should stop expressing their upset or anger about the condition of the game, and stop criticising the developers for the current problems. I think that is a load of bollocks and have said as much. Have I made tonnes of posts about it? No. Just this. You say I should leave the community now because of my opinions. LMAO, you fucking moron. I'll leave when I'm ready thanks. Despite there being an overwhelming number of cunts in this community, like yourself Weirdo, I do find some sensible, mature, truth speakers here, whose posts are worth reading. 
---
As you are in complete denial of the mess the game is in, we can't really debate anything. So I guess you can just go fuck off back to kindergarten after all.
---
I'm not crying. You seem to be triggered just fine though.
---
Keep going friend. How small am I btw?
---
I do they're really annoying but theyre new so I cant complain
---
imagine thinking that prayer beads is a healthy add-on for the game
---
I haven't watched past season 3 of the Walking Dead and that was years ago, but from what I remember Rick could easily be a Survivor. He'd fit in. My first impression:
---
I think "I Found Them" wouldn't rustle any feathers, for better or worse. Maybe I'm not creative enough, but I can't see why anyone would really want this.
---
Team Captain seems pretty similar to Prove Thyself, and aids with Gen Rushing which probably isn't something they want to further enable, especially if this stacks with Prove Thyself. 
---
I like Here and Now a lot! It could potentially be used with "No One Left Behind" for some Major BP gains during late game.   
---
In fact, after reading that last perk and considering them all, I think the combo of Prove Thyself+Team Captain+Here And Now+No One Left Behind would be awesome for Gen Rushing and then farming late game Altruism points. Gen Rush to the late game, then go about rescuing and healing and you'll max out on Altruism easy with the 100% bonus. 
---
Overall though, I'd have to say Here and Now stands out my favorite perk here. I really think it could make No One Left Behind relevant.
---
Nah I've made my point, you havent made a single one lol
---
Well now they have monsters I dont see why not
---
Just read
---
That’s what I thought too.
---
Riot pulling clash?
---
Riot is league of legends.
---
Clash is from R6 Siege.
---
Move on dude.....
---
Thank you for taking the time to write a message like this! Not many people compliment me on my content, but on the off chance that they do, it really makes my day. Thank you.
---
A space map would be cool too
---
Delete this.
---
Fact: always shitting on devs that continously provide free and enjoyable content makes you a toxic part of the community.
---
you can always look behind you. but its probably harder on PS4
---
Ah ok kinda expected it to be a movie or show and wanted to know why she was singing into a bottle
---
[deleted]
---
Are you a AAA game developing coder?
---
No? Then you dont know how easy or hard it can be. They can hire all the people they want, but without recreating the entire game, they cant just go "change values" and fix everything. It's not a manpower/time kind of solution.
---
Like the space station and of course Risley would be the survivor.
---
I actually doubt that Lampkin take the dedicated server mess. They delayed that because of the same issues we got when they launched it was happening in the PBT yet they still launched it and the bugs are still there.
---
...Except the zombie myers movies, the Raven cult and so on...
---
it would RuIn The BP EcONoMY
---
*unzips pants*
---
I just have a certain distaste for 'battle passes'in paid games, especially a game with a fair few dlcs
---
i think that was me, but it was a long time ago so i dont remember
---
It’s easy, 2 hooks and you can mori.
---
Being downed after the second hook is usually a certain death anyway.
---
But you can't venture too far from the center of the map if you have BL on Lery's 😢
---
ATTENTION this thread had been thoroughly salted... I guess you asked for it?
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one who still commemorate this masterpiece.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dn9s7c/i_didnt_know_that_myers_got_a_rework/
---
I agree but I am just not a fan of the pass idea in paid games
---
Decemberly Hills 90210
---
Yeah, I couldn't agree more! I think they just wanna take their loss out on someone instead of just moving on.
---
I'm sorry but my main games rn are Dead By Daylight, Esacpe from Tarkov and Hunt Showdown and it just so happens that all those games are in kinda shitty states rn 
---
And ALL of these communities have turned absolute rabid just bc the games been buggy for a week, come the fuck on do you have any idea how fucking hard game development is? Programming? Is so fucking tireless, and all these games are made by small teams with no publisher to back up with funds.
---
If you guys want a gaming market free of greedy publishers making everything a reskin of COD with day one DLC you gonna have to learn some patience 
---
Sorry for the rant I might have to post this on 
---
r/offmychest I'm so mad rn.
---
Not every DC is intentional/ they may have to leave due to irl problems
---
Yup that's a yellow rank killer for you.  That's the range where you should expect a camp and NOED and be pleasantly surprised when they don't.  They're just babies up there trying or sometimes not trying to learn the game.  They don't know any better.  In general I wouldn't even bother getting upset at seeing that at the noob ranks.  It's kind of expected.  You'll need Decisive every game and I'd recommend Small Game too for their NOED dulls until you rank up.
---

Oh yeah xD

Sorry if you misunderstood me, but i meant you were spitting the facts. I agree with you.
---
No one said they were flawless. The insides of all the buildings in preschool are still pretty safe, while the outsides of the map are where the unsafe pallets are. I think that's a good way to have it, where there are some consistent areas you can run to - as long as those pallets are still up.
---
All I ever said was that I couldnt take you seriously when you're abitrarily using "lol". I think its immature. That turned into you calling me stupid, a piece of shit, a little man, crazy and an ass. It's time to calm down.
---
Yeah and a mori with either its tongue or tail
---
Honestly love when people bring up stats like that up for companies. They have over 500 empolyees these issues shouldn't happen! Like woah there calm down thouse numbers include custodians, secretaries, designers, modellers, animators, etc. They are not all developers and not all of them are assigned to work on this one game. No company banks on their one game being their sole income source. They most likely have devs working on other projects
---
No I got that, i was just expanding on my comment more.
---
I need judgement on this, I’ve only ever done this once, but if I just stop playing mid-game because I’m getting whooped (or something) and let the surviver finish the game, am I being a dick? I refuse to DC it’s just unfair and a waste of time for everyone, but I just don’t want to continue playing. Obviously it’s a case of how they earn bp but if I’m not just going to quit the game as a whole is it a dick move?
---
We need new Bill cosmetics. My boy needs some love
---
I'm very calm, just had good points but find it dumb all you can take from it is someone wrote lol? You werent even bright enough to pick up on why I would write lol dude.
---
This. 
---
IE: the word 'chair' also happens to be a feminine common noun in French, it'd be as if you were to say "Chairs are female, confirmed straight from Cote's mouth".
---
Also, it would be "L'Entité" because grammar rule makes it that you can't have a "la" in front of a vowel.
---
Lol, when?
---
nah dude, if they really have to go because their house is on fire then a 5 minute+ timeout is the last thing they will care about. Besides, if you know you gotta go in few minutes you shouldn't start another game. That is totally your own fault.
---
I mean, if it keeps you from getting murdered, do what you gotta do.
---
Most definitely
---
I dont like this idea of 'you get it back', i dont think i should have to pay in the first place...i paid for the game, i pay for the dlcs, why do i have to pay to access more 'content'
---
I'm enjoying it! I don't have long wait times for survivor, but I do for killer. Though it's not so bad it sours my mood. Just means I get to watch youtube or grab a snack/surf reddit while I wait for a match to start.
---
Thiccface
---
There's also that one comic with Jeff and Susie
---
Still a premium service of any kind in a paid game is a bit disconcerting
---
Maybe we want to hear that
---
Aren't they siblings? Laurie and Michael
---
Does it count if I only do killer dailies / kyf?
---
And believe it or not.... The same goes for killers 0_o CRAZY I know
---
Be careful, you've only got a couple active. Much that I think you're a fucking idiot, I wouldn't want to feel responsible for your complete system failure.
---
I notice you call a lot of people trolls who disagree with you Weirdo. Why is that?
---
I'll say again. The game is a mess. This is a fact. The fact that you keep denying this and trying to call it opinion does make this to and throw rather pointless. There is little point expecting anything positive to come of it. While in that stalemate. 
---
So if you are ready to move on Weirdo, by all means do so.
---
Literally nobody said otherwise, fuckwit.
---
I'm just not a fan, if it was unlockable with iri shards then it would be wayyyy better because long time players would feel a bit more rewarded

Maybe 20-30k iri shards

Ayy definitely create what you think is right! For me it’s definitely the mouth that discomforts me. She seems to happy to be there.
---
At least she got recently buffed
---
I had a Claudette legit run away from me, run behind a rock, and just hid. And... I could still see her. And she was wearing the lab coat so it wasn't camo or anything. I just... Stood there for a few seconds as my brain buffered on what to do.
---
She got recently buffed

Except there are timelines with different designs and explanations to michael's strength, such as the Curse of Thorne, him just being tough, some demon feeding him strength, and whatever theyre doing in the new timeline.

Did you even read my comment?
---
They could leave the monitor instead of wasting time leaving the match if its a serious problem.
---
Also, progressively wait means they wont have to wait too much the first time they DC..so it wont be that big of a deal for them
---
She actually got buffed recently
---
Not as pleased as Myers lol

they are cousins..i think

So your survivor if you play killer are a great first season and a mediocre let down second one?

But nobody mentions the buffs she just got lol
---
They’re not, in the original timeline they were brother and sister. In the new timeline they aren’t related whatsoever, they even say so in the movie.
---
sigh \*unzips\*
---
I think it's implying that they will try to leave with an active bear trap
---
Tbf they did release last update with a shit ton of bugs so , while im glad theyre fixing them this time before live, It wouldnt be the 1st they got something out that fucked the Game quite a bit
---
It is fun, sure and the tension is really nice too. Although i wouldnt compare 2 games that work in many ways differently than dbd.
---
This gonna turn to become a gru meme, after it comes out and is still a unbalance fucking glitchfest of bugs ! 
---
* Event gets delayed
---
* Be happy that they gonna patch everything
---
* Still hot unbalanced garbage with bugs all over it!
---
God my boy looks so good, absolutely incredible job!
---
Doctor's curse can work as DBD u can even do a 360
---
Then why even doing that? They brought it to a level lately on console where it looked and ran great. I swear by god I would bet something that because of this, when the update is out, we will get either worse performance of some stupid graphic reductions, I can already feel it.
---
None of those examples had set dates.

But.

In that mode you can kill the killers. Dbd doesnt do that. In that mode its a one shot kill. No second chances. Its in many ways different and it doesnt work like dbd so comparing the 2 is... well, can I say pointless? Saying the other one is better is a preference at that point.

Dude you still don’t understand what I said. I said they mix these two (event+mid chapter) so they don’t get through the same process twice within a week. Let’s say two weeks, it doesn’t matter. Bigger the update longer the process. MAYBE THEY DID NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS TWICE BECAUSE OF THAT. Do you now understand why it might be related to certification process. And of course mixing two big updates caused many game breaking bugs and they want to fix it before they release the... you know what why am I even trying to explain myself to someone who just want make a counter argument without analysing my thoughts properly?
---
*ANNIHILATION*
---
I"ve got thousands of hours in this game, and i expect something new on the game so i can keep playing" there, fixed your shitty comment

No, but that’s fine because they’re different characters and so that’ll be consistent to them.
---
Differing mori times on one character is an issue
---
I love getting downvoted even though I said other people can like him just isn’t for me :D this community just proved my point
---
Can confirm for OP
---
OVERWATCH: Thank you for reporting
---
DBD: zZzZz
---
There has been a few matches where the loading screen takes like almost 3 minutes, then you get ready to play but you can’t cause either killer or survivor left. 
---
When that happens I only assume someone had to deal with something else IRL. 
---
In my opinion We can report early leaver but there should be a number of times if they continue to repeat leaving then they can get suspended for some time if they get reported 3-6 times (then again the devs would sleep on reports)
---
And also the fact it’s almost Halloween with no release of the event the devs could at least give extra Xp to keep players occupied.
---
But you do get new stuff, in the form of DLCs, you’re not entitled to new content FOR FREE
---
Yeah, so what if they make a really short one, then you just stand in place for like 10 seconds. Money well spent.
---
"Oh wow, everyone is so entitled, they dont agree with me"

I love getting downvoted even though I said he just isn’t for me and I don’t care if other people like him :D this community just proved my point for me lmao.

DH and BL are definitely better than lithe but that's not what I'm talking about. SB just doesn't provide as much value as it used to. Windows are designed to make space, combine that with 175% speed immediatly after and you can easily make a lot more space and get to another loop.

In Spanish the Entity is referred to with masculine pronouns. It's just a language quirk, there Entity is referred to as "it" in every other context

I bring the point up because the Halloween update itself doesn't take much to do.

It's not like with the clown and the store update.
---
In the grand scheme of things are Halloween update is actually very simple hence why it could be implemented and taking away very easily.

The hardest part about playing Bing BONG is to stop spamming the song long enough to play the game. He is 100% fixed. His fix is what a killer fix should be like no game play change but subtle differences to make him viable for most and deadly for some.

I said armwrestling.

---
I am well aware that no one person could just go beat up trapper or michael
---
I haven’t seen the source of that picture, but it always sounds like a funny voice in my head
---
But they *were* transparent about it, or at least as much as a company can be without going into technical details. They explicitly expressed that their BE services ran into unforeseen issues. As someone working on exactly that (albeit in a business, rather than entertainment context) I can fully get behind that. IT, especially the actually complex parts that are usually handled by the BE, can easily capsize over issues noone even expected to come up. It could have been anything from a library update suddenly causing conflicts, a framework going deprecated or anything obscure in between.
---
The only way they could be even more transparent would be by having a dev explain the issue in all it's technical detail, but that would both be incomprehensible to 95% of their playerbase, and give out information about their source code that they would prefer not to reveal.
---
That's awesome my dude! Don't see too many wraith costumes so nice change!
---
This is amazing!
---
So what your saying is Moro with clown is mad disrespect because it waste both your time and the survivors time.
---
Thank you :’)
---
How are you so good?
---
But daddy Myers🥺
---
Step bruh
---
So much nope. Lo
---
Got ya! I honestly think the last time I thought about the certification process was for one of the trials games years ago
---
I guess for DBD, Bruce Campbell was worth the Money because everybody bought him.
---
I actually like having,both keys and moris. Sure it freaking sucks when you feel the game ended a bit quicker than you would have liked, but I feel it adds actual value to the game. To clarify, it adds depth and another avenue of gameplay. Without it, the game is just patrol gens and hook people or do gens and try not to get hooked. This is over-simplifying how the game works, but I feel it is one of those things that can add a good bit of pressure to both sides of players. Like, don't get downed again lest you be mori'd. On the other hand as a killer, if enough gens are done, keep an eye out for that hatch and do what you can to figure out if the remaining survivors' game plan has changed. I mean, if they have a key and hatch is visible, they're probably not really going to be doing anymore gens at that point, and are maybe just going to play stealthy until they can get that hatch escape.
---
Idk, I like the inclusion of both moris and keys and Im happy that they are both fairly uncommon both in bloodweb and in regular gameplay.
---
Excactly, and since they buffed the pick up times, Survivors literally wont be able to blind during the animation if they don't sit literally 2 metres away.
---
But this is also the reason that when I use a flashlight (which I seldom do), I'm using it to blind the Killer during pallet breaks to extend chases.
---
what if he was just trying to also find the hatch. it would make finding the hatch take less time with 2 people searching for it
---
[Told ya](The only difference is that they DC at the end in...

---
That's so weird, it's the opposite for me. What are you ranks, if you don't mind me asking? I'm ~10 survivor and ~16 killer atm.
---
unless you're deleting some that you don't want to do, then no.
---
I think dead hard goes well with second wind. If you are getting chased after unhook and can't survive 30 seconds then dead hard saves your ass
---
Oh shit. I also got rid of the no one part because it normally just makes a meme less funny
---
The point being they said there wasn't gonna be one. Why announce that at all if you weren't at some point planning to do one? And what purpose does it serve to bring it up on their part? Telling your fanbase they arent gonna do events is no way to generate goodwill at a crucial time
---
I never demanded free content from the devs, i just expected them to be able to manage their game. Delaying the event is not the issue, the issue is how to event will come buggier after and the devs will just stop caring for another 5 months. Also, i played the game for a little over 1100 hours, and that is why I say the game lacks NEW content. The game's idea of a 4v1 and all the grind, that is very awesome and that kept me on the game
---
lmao r/SweetHomeAlabama
---
HOOK ME ON YOUR WEAPON MICHAEL AND SLAP ME WHILE YOU'RE AT IT
---
Would just make it worse since they announced the delay less than 24h before the launch
---
Your idea seems like a theory but if was true.. god damn, it's worse than we thought
---
That's true lol
---
Well thats just depressing.
---
Me neither. Chests help me track survivors with their loud noise and can slow down the game a little bit. Sure they can turn the tide in the survivors favor sometimes but most good survivors take items anyway so it doesn't matter so much in the end.
---
Oh no
---
for some reason brown, yellow map offerings still exist on mobile
---
I rly like this perk. Good for some kinky basement time
---
This is a joke
---
did you get facecamped or something? because that evader and lightbringer emblem aint doing so good
---
Lol they need to sell  few more characters then
---
I just want the horror game to have a halloween event before Christmas decorations start popping up everywhere... I hope they fix it soon
---
Yum.
---
also pretty that the kid who is skinny with glasses is the default 'wrong opinion' because he's beta or something.  
---
really tasteful and not at all body shaming

Halloween stuff is out already though?

It is time for DBD’s first Furry killer

I did this with Myers and infectious fright all of the survivors just hid close by lol

True but you I dont think that's how the power would work---

Yes, I can't wait to have a halloween event in November.

so sick,keep up the great work!
---
Of the streamers, i only know Otz, but I play a lot of killers
---
Yeah I love otz as well, just want to see how people play rhe same killer over and over again.
---
Shit I worded it wrong. I meant when your going to hook them for the third time
---
What I don't understand is that even though there was 1 DC, I still managed to get 9 hooks, so according to the description, I should have gained iridescent
---
When the event comes out, I'm 99% sure all the hallowed blight skins will be available to be purchased with serum (I'm not completely sure though, so if Dwight or Claudette's skins aren't available, then i'm sorry). I know that in this event, you earn serum by repairing certain generators, which will fill vials at the end of a match. Once you have enough vials, you can buy one of the skins.
---
I play Clown, Spirit, Myers, Plague
---
I guess the game is shit then
---
Did not know there were this many boot lickers in the community
---
Sorry. I must have missed it.
---
Steam name is "jalabeano" i play on PC and i want to do a custom game/kyf
---
I honestly am thinking the devs are trying to damage control on this sub
---
Always nice to see people playing a variety and that too myers and clown especially since very less people play them &lt;3. I mostly play all the killers except for spirit huntress and hag.
---
Amazing!!
---
didnt downvote you, whoever is is being rather odd, have some upvotes to balance.
---
This was a huge project and I'm proud to finally be able to show it to the entire community.
---
Why, you ask, did I make so many perks? For fun. I like being creative and I like making things.
---
I'd really appreciate it if you gave me some feedback on this ideas!
---
Criticism, praise, advice, suggestions, they're all welcome and I encourage you to say your piece!
---
I'll do my best to reply to all responses and given the nature of this post, you'll likely see changes in the document accordingly!
---
I use windowed cause I play on a potato and the framerate tanks if I go into full screen
---
 I think you guys missed the point. I was gonna play Pig, due to offering. IF it worked out, as intended, i would be fucked over by those 2 objects of obssesion, considering how gamebreaking this perk is against stealth killers.
---
 BUT the game decided that i shall play Spirit instead. It was such a relief to see "OoO" teabagging in a distance and realise that i'm a Spirit, and not the Pig.
---
Your truly amazing. I've never seen such raw talent
---
I play Clown (and rage) then i play a little Spirit...
---
I made a sensible statement in a respectable manner, and you're here yelling "ClOwN aLeRt", and you're saying I'm the clown? Ok buddy.
---
First of all, not all of those are devoted to dead by daylight, some are marketing, some are other projects, ect. Second of all... thats still really not a large company.
---
The game's objective seems to be changing...
---
I mean i already know i am at most getting 2 kills with a clown. So i mostly play for my bbq stacks and i am satisfied once i got them.
---
Holy shit great job
---
Get $10 auric cells and do both
---
It literally is still a small company, especially because many of those people are working on other projects, marketing, publicity ect. Very few of the additional people hired, were actually for development of dead by daylight.
---
Hmm ya i just bait dh anymore since its "meta".
---
Are you being sarcastic? You seen like you are.

&gt;Honestly they should just stop doing PTBs, they kill the hype for new content and clearly by the current situation must not even help much

---
All is as it should be.
---
I meant second part, not gonna mention the reason, thats a spoiler !
---
Dude your artwork is amazing UwU
---
I'm nearing that much myself. I would say that survivor perks were definitively the most challenging to come up with. (Unlike killers who can naturally be more creative and have  **E N T I T Y  M A G I C**  backing them up, survivor perks have to be somewhat logical, reasonable, are limited by the fact that multiple survivors can use the same perk.)
---
I see where you're coming from, may retry to revamp the perk into something different
---
Most likely someone wrote a script that does it for them.
---
Wait, that’s not a real picture of her?
---
Ye you done....
---
You need to hook every player atleast once, so even with 9 hooks you still don't get iridescent
---
Hold up, people got banned for using a specific combo of add-ons on legion like is that true if so that's all kinds of fucked.
---
Great art man
---
No idea, I did it a while ago and entered my own
---
Killer: tries with every ounce of strength to get a double pip with just three (possibly horrible) perks for the adept achievement. Praying that none of the survivors dcs or kill themselves on hook.
---
Survivor: just escape through the door or hatch for the adept
---
If scream met assassins creed

What do you mean? They explained the cause was a power outage, and recovering old work isn't something you can effectively expect the completion of.
---
Little column A little column B currently trying to P3 all my killers and I use to just to from killer to killer per prestige but changed it so I played that one killer for awhile then switched once I got my P3 currently on plague
---
I don't know whats the issue here but I managed to get Iridescent Devout with a DC twice while going for my Adepts. Perhaps the person crashed (or pulled the cable) instead of using the Leave Game option?

All the thing with the event delayed I start to think in the next killer, we are going to have another chapter this year?
---
See? It's all about patience. Unfortunately it is a bit inconsistent as I sometimes get really fast queue times but it's just something we have to deal with for now
---
Horrible, horrible game balance. Devs completely ignoring community feedback. Zero updates to fix the hilariously one sided gameplay. 
---
New runners = hunters always win
---
Runners who know how you combo abilities = hunter perma stunned the entire game
---
It's a million times worse than swf on dbd.
---
That plus after the game died horribly instead of abandoning it, BHVR pumped all the dbd 2.0 cosmetic money into "fixing" the game which mostly consisted of a Terminator license. The game is once again dying.
---
The killer doesn't get emblem points for bleedouts, and also he gets way less points than hooking them.
---
That might be it - I play on PC.
---
This is great, I love the style! :)
---
Ikr, it's so unequal. And with the way pips work now, I really feel like the requirements for this achievment are no longer relevant. It's impossible to get adept at rank 1, not because the survivors are too good, but because you need 4 damn iridescent emblems to do so.

Thats what I thought the reason was, but it's not what the emblem says.
---
And this also kind of points out a problem with the pipping system: why don't DC's count as a hook?

Ikr. Wish they kept it to where you only need 4k to get it. Then it'll be at least easier (you'll still probably have to pray no one dcs though)

Try adding a shortcut of Dead by Daylight to your desktop and then running it from the shortcut.

It's not that bad once you get used to it tbh
---
I was thinking maybe it looks worse on YouTube than it does when you’re playing.

nice
---
My theory is that the killer is unlicensed.

I think this because I want them to be and saved up shards to get them.

I dunno, I understand everyone's grievances about BHVR's constant fucking up, but I just can't get behind the whole "Fuck BHVR" train. Maybe it's because my roots started with Dirty Bomb, which had notoriously incompetent devs, but I honestly don't know ANY game studios that are just perfect at all times and immediately fix every bug as soon as it's discovered. I'm not saying those dev studios don't exist, but I honestly would like someone to tell me a studio that has just like a spotless track record. Every game I've played, from Dirty Bomb, to Rainbow Six, to Overwatch, to DBD, have all had developers that constantly get shit for pretty much everything. Dirty Bomb had some incredibly annoying bugs that persisted for months at a time, and Rainbow Six has had plenty of glitches that completely break gameplay (the Jager Shield Glitch, just to name one), Overwatch is... well it's Overwatch. Blizzard has been getting shit pretty much since Ana's release. And we all know the issues that Dead By Daylight has had over it's years. Even as a relatively "new" player (been playing since about a month before the Legion's release), I've seen plenty of both awful and hilarious bugs and glitches from the game's history. 
---
I'm not saying it's wrong to be upset about the update and event getting postponed, I was pretty upset about it too, but I just don't think it's fair to throw so much shit at BHVR when they are doing what most people want in most games. I've seen plenty of people say in multiple games' forums, including this one, "I'm fine with content being pushed back and delayed, if it means that there are bug fixes." Now they've finally done what people ask of them (even though it just had to be a seasonal update, big rip), and they're still catching shit.
---
Will the update still have bugs? Of course, there always is, it's pretty much just expected at this point. But if BHVR postponing the update means I'll be able to hear generator progress on the Game and Ormond without having to have line of sight on them, fine by me.
---
D/Cs actually used to count. Just like killer D/Cs currently count for survivor adepts (I got one of mine that way, can't remember which one)

Right, but what is your criteria of a good game? Is it a bad game if you lose? Some people in this thread literally just have the criteria of losing as not appropriate grounds for GG, which is fucking hilarious
---
Is it not a good game if you got stomped? Why? We're all here, presumably, because we enjoy this game. Wipeouts are going to happen every once in a while. Is it frustrating to you? Why?
---
I had almost this exact same conversation with another person, but almost no matter how you spin it it's just your problem. If the game was played fair within the rules then there's no reason to be upset.

No, it used to be 1 shard for every minute spent in the match (a max of 10 or something, not 100% sure what the cap was) but the shrine was cheaper in those days.

Tried to play as survivor few days like about 10 games. I had disconnect from server each game after \~1 minute, without any blood points and depipped. In match scoreboard i see that killed had disconnect too. With Survivor friends they see that only i just disconnected from a match.
---
Also tried today 2 games as killer, had disconnect right after mach was started both times...
---
Checked game local files twice - didn't helped at all. Tried to disable firewall on my router and on my windows - same result. Tried to add exceptions on the Windows Firewall for steam - doesn't work.  
---
But it does work if it share internet from my phone via hotspot (without my router in this case). So issue with some kind of routing maybe? All other games in Steam, Playstation and other launchers work great (e.g. Destiny 2, R6 Siege, Friday 13, GTA5, CoD, Battlefield and so on)
---
So, can't play now.
---
 Tried to play recently without router, but with mobile internet (mobiel hotspot) - still getting disconnects but in 5-10 minutes after match start. 
---
 I tried to play few more times - still getting disconnects after 1-10 minutes. I don't have any Antivirus (except Defender) or VPN or PROXY and etc. Also tested with disabled Windows Firewall and Defender - same.
---
I play huntress and demogorgon, but I used to play plague and pig, and before them hag and wraith. It’s fun to have a little change every now and then :)
---
Big question:
---
Wake up early?
---
Or stay up late?
---
I don't blame them for trying to make money off their game. Never had a problem with all the DLCs or the Cosmetic Store. The battlepass though is a proven predatory system that is, honestly, only acceptable in free to play games. I wouldn't lump them in with Activision or EA, but I would say they're jumping on the Bethesdawagon: Broken game, tons of paywalls.
---
He just rolls over survivors
---
                        ^
---
                        ||
---
Thank you for the response, but I'm afraid this didn't fix the issue. I don't get the option to run the game as administrator from the desktop shortcut also.
---
In Left 4 Dead, Bill says it when he's low on health so it kinda makes sense on unbreakable.
---
Really? Didn't know that.
---
Really hope they change it back then. Cause atm it's just really unfair.
---
Except, get this, plenty of games release things when they say it'll be ready just fine. Because, get this, it's not amateur hour everywhere in the damn industry.
---
The worst is when the 3 man hard sandbags you and/or blames you for 4k.
---
Nothing like watching your teammates teabag in basement while you die on first hook.
---
I actually dont mind. I would rather have the Overwatch Halloween event and DBD occur on separate days.
---
He’s not blind, you just hid cleverly in my opinion, when he vaulted that window tho that was the first person fov. I wouldn’t be surprised if his weapon was hiding you from his view since it’s kind of wide.
---
I Found Them is an interesting alternative to Bond and could be interesting to switch out depending on your build.
---
Team Captain is a lot like the old Prove Thyself, which they changed because it was to strong, which I agree with; especially is this stacks with prove thyself its a good way to get really short games.
---
I like Here and Now; I think the numbers might be too high but the concept is cool. It's a more functional Autodidact and encourages people running it to still participate in the rest of the game rather than just run around looking for injured people to proc a perk.
---
Rick would be an interesting surv, but who would his killer counterpart be?
---
Whoa bro the passive aggression sounds like you need to go play a game of killer.
---
I mean I did acknowledge that they could potentially be trying to turn around and start trying to patch their games properly, I just don't expect that 3 years in ya know? The fact that the patch that they think is going to turn them into something like Fortnite is the one that's being polished just makes me a bit paranoid.
---
I thought the killer could be  Negan, bit then I decided on Alpha because she was more relevant in the series. I haven’t made the perks for her yet, but I’m working on them.
---
PWYF and M&amp;A. You'll find some dweebs out in the open eventually.
---
Wait isn't he her brother
---
Tha was some bs. She had let go from the gen and still got grabbed
---
The point is that telling people not to use something is silencing of free speech. But yeah no I'm a Nazi sympathizer because I value free speech for everyone instead of just people who I agree with.
---
It's not even 30 fps, this is an overreaction
---
Players that refuse to acknowledge that playing in a SWF gives them an advantage they werent supposed to have.
---
Perks: Iron Will and Spine Chill (they are amazing in general, but *especially* against Spirit).
---
Strategies:
---
&gt; Scratch mark juke: Run back over your own scratch marks to make her think you stopped running.
---
&gt; Pallet loop juke: Pretend you're staying near a pallet. When you see her standing still, she's most likely phasing, then walk away from the tile.
---
&gt; Break line of sight asap. Then go in a different direction once you're around the corner (same way as juking Nurse).
---
&gt; Remember that Spirit's power has a cooldown. When she just came out of phasewalk, you *know* it's on cooldown so if she's suddenly standing still don't think she could be phasing again. She is just standing still.
---
Funny, doing my hag adept right not (this post was about hillbilly adept, which I just finished)
---
Myer! Incest is illegal, stop!
---
It severely hinders killers when the map is already designed for survivors to loop infinitely.
---
Let's trigger the killer mains some more! YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISARM FREDDY'S SNARES!
---
No, I mean don't even acknowledge that they would even consider spending extra time fixing a patch for gameplay reasons.
---
Because going without ruin means a 5 gen rush and barely getting kills.
---
Very interesting!
---
ah fair, i dont play killer so im not sure of their LOS and i guess the weapon makes sense xD was funny though!!
---
How do you notice if someone is new?
---
I think that depends some pretty play games are extremely pay to win others already offer my good friend's actions I don't think you should be allowed to do both at any given time
---
I was making this thinking about rank reset when your team is just doing gens and not caring about you so they can rank up and I play late during rank reset so everyone is bad basically
---
based and true
---
No mither sucks
---
Friends Forever's ability is literally so fitting
---
Same here, no lag at all on other games but DBD is miserable. I don't have access to ethernet so I'm forced to play on wifi. Never had this much issue until dedicated servers get tested.
---
Good thing I can hear y’all sprinting to the left then whenever I’m pallet blinded
---
Eh, I almost never kill everyone. I'd like to think I make someone's day when I let them get the hatch or escape. It's always a nice interaction when the killer spares me. Puts a smile on my face. Still, I always go for the offering to the killer to see if they will show me that same mercy and if not, I was going to die anyway!
---
ty frien
---
No 25 chili according to the wiki BP farming and memes
---
There'll be many more. SWF can't play without being toxic.
---
The way they play and if they wear defaults
---
They dont think it be like it is, but it do.
---
if they’re absolute shit
---
I was being sarcastic.
---
God damn that’s good
---
*instant mori*
---
Nice

Yoga Steve! Great cosplay dude
---
69th comment. 😎
---
Awww, Bubba is so cute &lt;3
---
idk why but I get flashlights 90% of the time without running a perk so this would do nothing for me tbh
---
The purple medkit addon paired with borrowed time would be the perfect counter to a camping bubba
---
You should mention that in the post
---
haha yeh, this was an experience i had, i was roughly 5 hours into the game and had NO idea what i was doing xD and Cannibal must of noticed and was like it's all g, leave :)
---
Cuteeeeeeeeeee :SteveMainsUnite:
---
Thats what i thought to myself XD
---
Yeah I’ll do that
---
i fucking love this title
---
Wise father
---
what the.... she eyes.... whaaat. its fun
---
im gonna try to do maybe one a week? &lt;3
---
Can we get that emote though? The pure “WhyyyyyYyyyyeeee” hands?
---
🐈
---
Who are you talking about? Just curious
---
I love losing pips lol
---
Well I'm pretty sure David could disarm and beat up each of the Legions and ghost face
---
I really liked Swan Song in concept.
---
You got downvoted for saying he promotes toxic behavier when he makes it clear it's a cunty thing to do when the people that actually encourage toxic behavier are OhShido and Buddy
---
Or three
---
I'd say it'll stay probably forever and no i don't think they will make purchasable for iridescent shards since you were able to get it through the new years event
---
Better a delayed, solid event than a buggy shitty one on time.
---
It seems like it won’t be going away anytime soon since even last years Halloween event skins haven’t gone away.
---
I think you can get it with iridescent shards, but the easiest way was through the actual event. I got the ace skin that way.
---
I love the frickin random rank 10 pop up. 😂
---
You love to see it!
---
Failing a skillcheck=Laurie bites Mike's dick
---
Facts don’t care about your feelings.
---
Stopped trying to get to red ranks as a rank 6 because I kept getting hit with tryhard rank 2 four stacks over and over again. Not fun at all.
---
Well you see 4+4+5+5=18, that’s just two ranks up from you
---
So which survivor did you picture in your head to land that accurate hit?
---
He’s not blind, he just didn’t look in your direction.
---
Literally just happened to me not but 20 minutes ago. 20000 BP just poof
---
I don't think you realize why they suspended the update temporarily. BECAUSE OF BUGS this meme is one of the worst memes I've seen here and that's saying alot
---
Aawwwwwwww!!
---

Yeah, he literally [sent them here to downvote others](https://i.imgur.com/Wqt2k80.png) recently.

He'll say he doesn't care and then shortly after he'll keep complaining, basically baiting people into shittalking him more...

HMMMMMMMMMMM

So event items stay forever? Sorry, I'm new.
---
[If I practiced too, this would be me throwing the axe for the firs time](https://media.tenor.com/images/8bac0a047428051d4c7bb15a4867dc75/tenor.gif)
---
Predictable idiots would do that, yeah. That's called natural selection my friend ;P
---
You know it’s there
---
On top of THAT, they didn’t really have an event for the 3rd year Anniversary, and completely skipped the Scorching Summer event to ensure this event would be “perfect”.
---
So much for that; and they did indeed wait until just hours before announcing it, and didn’t even originally state WHY, just that “Unforseen Circumstances”
---
A buggy build is not “unforseen”.
---
Head on, apply directly to the forehead 😉
---
The event isn't going on right?
---
Not anymore
---
Imagine thinking true was just average
---
I think I have to disagree with just about everything you say here. I do agree though that perks arent a substitute for game skill and knowledge, you cant expect the game to play itself for you. If you dont know how to play the killer you like or how to anticipate how the survs are likely to play the game you are probably going to have a bad time.
---
Having said that, of the perks you mention only Ruin and Sloppy are actually worth running imo. The numbers on Thana are too low to be worth the perk slot and Dying Light is pretty garbo after the change. PGTW can be really good if youre lucky, but would be much more viable if they put it on a token system (which theyve talked about doing). As it is now I regularly have to give up on chases or do extra walking just to get to a gen thats even worth using the perk on before it expires. If you are going to spend it on the first gen you see, even if its only like 5% complete, you should just run another perk. Likewise telling people to play Freddy so they can use his game-slowing add ons isnt a counter point to the current problem of gens getting done to fast. Just because one killer in their whole roster has a tool to help doesnt mean every one wants to play that one character just to have a good game.
---
Your biggest point though is map balance, and while your right in that the newer maps have been designed with better game play in mind, I dont think having 'better maps' will help close the gap between good and bad killers. Just taking into account how differently the killers work it is almost impossible to make a balanced map that all of them  are going to be good on.
---
Im Not Sure myself, but i recall the Halloween event skins still being in the store
---
You are not my brother, buddy!
---
Survivor is boring tho
---
I would have assumed that the Entity was agender.
---
It is reportable
---
I like
---
Watch salty survivor main get destroyed with facts and logic.
---
Or stand there, and she phases to you and gets a hit. Or run or walk away and she phases to you and gets a hit. There is literally 0 skill involved with playing as spirit, and calling this a mindgame is a joke because it isn't a 50/50% guessing game, you just lose far more often than not.
---
I think I have seen this one before
---
It can be reported, but usually it's kind of fun and different for the Survivors. I just played a match with an AFK Freddy Krueger and that was oodles of fun. Good blood point farming.
---
I understand it but I sadly just don't find kill enjoyable so.
---
First thing that comes up in amazon 👌
---
Most totems have been fixed in the majority of maps. Unless your definition of "fix" is a totem never being found until the match is over.
---
that's inaccurate.
---
Entity is a noun that is gendered female but the appropriate déterminant to use is « l' » which is an ungendered déterminant.
---
It is called « L'Entité »
---
&gt; Shit happens but we should still get something.
---
Uh, no.  Any updates to games should make us feel lucky.  Do you not remember the days when games were shipped on cartridges and could never be patched?
---
you only get them for lisenced dlc IIRC and if you unlocked the dlc on steam they don't appear at all
---
True haha
---
Because Halloween is in October. And they only let us know about the delay the day before it was supposed to go live with the excuse "Unexpected delays" while attempting to update their back end, something that they should know tends to fuck with stuff in major ways, which means that it should in no way be unexpected. They've been building hype for this event for a month, with the date of October 22nd as their promised release date. They should have been able to meet their MVP by the deadline, and they did not. 
---
Also this is a horror game without an event for the holiday most closely associated with horror, so there's that.
---
Worst map for Trapper is any map without grass. But I have pulled off some spicy traps using that one vault in The Game that takes you to the first floor.
---
Yeah  I heard the event is being delayed, and people are pissed about it lol. I also heard you are limited to two free event skins. If that's true, I guess I can just get two more when the event finally starts.
---
He’s about to Tier 3 like hard core.
---
Iron Will is a Jake Park perk, you either need to put bloodpoints into him or unlock it in the Shrine of secrets to make it available to other survivors. Spine Chill is a non-unique perk and anyone can get it at any level.
---
Survivor bloodwebs are randomly generated. You can have the first Tier of Spine Chill appear on the bloodweb starting at level 2.
---
Thanks!
---
I admit
---
DISMEMBERED AND SCATTERED ACROSS THE GLOBE
---
Count her fingers
---
It's situational as in you have to get hooked first, it is not usable on demand, which does make it situational. And yeah going down within a minute is very likely, especially with how many killers do tunnel. Either way I don't know how I'd adjust the perk, but it should be usable longer than a minute so people stop just slugging and running around for a minute. And yes I know it's an unpopular opinion.
---
I'm just not very good at survivor okay u.u
---
I play a lot of killers: Legion, Clown, Doctor, Demogorgon, Ghost Face, and sometimes Freddy and Pig too
---
Sorry if I miscommunicated my intention: Of course it's fairly reasonable to assume they would do a Halloween themed event in a horror game, when they have previously done so before.
---
What I was getting at with my previous post was the apparent "How dare they announce a delay, I immediately **demand** to be given extra blood points as compensation!" mentality.
---
I love trapping up The Game. There are like really obvious places that survivors go through in a chase without paying attention.
---
Me too
---
I’ve never thought about the camouflage aspect for Meyers 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
This looks amazing! Holy balls!
---
I prefer Perception over Spine Chill
---
Sorry not a french speaker, I am just repeating what DBD's wiki is telling me.
---
&lt;3
---
Rather than come up with all these fancy rules for where and how some one DCs, just start actually punishing people for doing it and theyll stop; or at least slow down. Im personally a fan of the way Overwatch does it, where if you DC from a certain % of your matches then you stop earning in game currency and exp until you complete a few games without DCing.
---
thank you &lt;3 im thinking of doing one a week.
---
Complex but thanks
---
cuuuuuuuuuute :P &lt;3
---
The killers job is to hook survivors. Unless you somehow can get 5 gens done and everyone escapes before a single hook which is very unlikely DS will be activated almost every match
---
We shouldn't stop playing, but maybe say that if they don't here to us, that they should go for a healthy game instead of new gameplay for half a year or something. And if they don't, we will buy less. I buyed nearly all DLC, but I didn't buy Stranger Things because the game is too buggy for me so they don't deserve it.
---
Sure it's no solution if everybody stopped buying things, because that would cause that they can't work anymore. But we should show that it is important to us and that this is more important than other things they are planning
---
I don't think the issue is with the lack of a 3.3 patch itself so much as with the lack of common sense to not make a time limited holiday event dependent on a massive update with an engine patch included that has a high probability of delays given past experiences with engine patching. It's not entitled to expect holiday events to play out *before* the holiday is over - that's just normal given the nature of consumerism and holidays. On 1 NOV everything is gonna switch to being about Thanksgiving. The mood is dead then so the event loses it's energy. 
---
To add salt to that wound the event is the horror genre's 1 time of year to get attention and the main game from that genre waits until the last week for an event then has to delay because of making it dependent on other content not yet ready. Smart marketing would be to do some form of stop-gap now to manage that disappointment. Disappointed fans don't play the game and spend money in the cosmetic store. That's not entitlement, that's capitalism 101.
---
You're free to point out examples, but I'll assume you will bring up those that only announced their release date after they were already done with developement. Which, obviously, is both a very safe way to ensure you won't miss deadlines, and a sound strategy in general... if you are not put under time pressure by developing a live service game with specific, seasonal events, where you can't just go 'it's done when it's done' for months before setting a release date.
---
But hey, don't let me try to steal your justified and righteous anger, I'm sure just adopting a mindset of judging and insulting a whole branche from the outside is far better for having success in life than actually bothering to try learning the details from multiple perspectives.
---
Have a nice day.
---
Is.. is he here? (Great cosplay btw)
---
Yeah man, I freed all my college work up just to have time to grind out the event but now we gotta wait a whole other week. People called out of work for no reason now too.
---
If you played this game on launch you would know it was toxic survivors lul
---
It does.

Dying light breaks the game Idk if they’ve patched it yet or not
---
Yeah I bet it will get activated, doesn't mean it will get used. And then even after that, you can never use it again whether or not you hit the skill check.
---
Definitely.
---
And now the spooky horror event is pushed back to November, woooooo, literally doesn't matter.
---
Somebody's been dipping into his own supply of BBQ and Chile...
---
Xbox One
---
In game 
---
Sometimes when in queue for a survivor game unknown error occurs and I can’t back out from searching so I eventually have to close game and restart it.
---
Nice using the electric cable for the head strap. Could probably make a lot of use of wire coathangers here as well. Very awesome, keep up the good work.
---
FUBAR means „Fucked Up Beyond Any/All Recognition/Repair“ which would mean he can‘t get back up anymore.
---
Well if that's how you feel dont play the game. Dont complain and talk bullshit and still play.
---
I often switch my killers.. Pig, Doctor, Leatherface, Hag, Freddy, Demo, Spirit, Ghost Face, Myers..
---
SWFWB
---
Is this one of those "the longer you look the more problems you see" kibda things?
---
Spirit is very east. Just use it on injured survivors. Hag is super easy. Trapper does suck. Not sure on GF, I don’t play him. Demogorgon isn’t too bad usually. 
---
The survivor dailies are glitched out though currently.
---
Fun is subjective lol..it’s no ones job to make the game fun
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
&gt; Let's agree that, ideally, they would have avoided the potential issue, like you described, in first hand.
---
Absolutely. I think after 3 years it should have been obvious not to put your eggs in 1 big giant basket. This is what's made people so angry and irrational about the delay - this kind of thing has happened before with BHVR so they really should've expected the possibility of a delay. 
---
I'm not sure applying customer friendly stop-gaps at times when the devs made obvious miscalculations and mistakes beyond the normal patch delays creates entitlement though. Not anymore than normal consumerism and marketing would anyway.
---
**Sigh... Unzips**
---
this makes more sense then bans
---
I just want something more than just his base outfit. Like Rob Zombie's creased dirty mask, or 2017's beige Asylum clothes.
---
Have a downdoot instead
---
Survivor actions get disabled I’ve only encountered this once on PS4 myself against a rank 14 Myers and I’ve seen it on PC through YouTube like I said I don’t know if they’ve patched it yet or not
---
She's just repairing him don't worry
---
This has been the case since the first release of the game.
---
I don't think they'll ever fix this anymore
---
It does that ?
---
I respectfully disagree
---
Careful you don't fail that skill check.
---
It's good for running meme games where you protect the basement chest at all costs
---
I remember that year omg
---
Halloween Tree.
---
Well this whose a nice treat! I have not read all (down to pirates) and whanted to tell you that its a great job! The themes are nice and the concepts are from good to awesom!! Realy nice done :D the only unbalqnced so far (in my opinion) is: Play with me!!! Not only dows it healp the killer from the start but allows the killer to turn a 3 gen strat into a 2 gen strat. And the killer is in controll of what gen to block, to me this seems to strong but i might be wrong. Realy hope the devs look at this for inspiration cause it is good! Now i will go back and read more ;)
---
No, y'all are stupid if you think the killer is ever going to let you go. If they do, that's wonderful, but they're literally getting blood points from killing you so why would you ever assume they'll let you even if they indicate it? I'm a survivor main, but 90% of survivors take shit like this for granted and are like oh he'll let me go, no.
---
Play the game and actually put in the effort to survive, or don't play the game and bitch when shit like this happens
---
If somebody on the street walks up with a knife and they're like "yes turn around and get stuff out of your car I won't hurt you" you aren't going to be like OkAy ThAnKs
---
But they are being really bad about it. And this is extremely unprofessional for a company to do
---
They ARE mad that they aren't being let go, and that's why this community is shit. Their job is to kill you, regardless of what they try to communicate.
---
But it lets you get back up repeatedly. If slugging is that much of a problem bring no mither.
---
How is Tru3 bad?
---
You should do my man freddy next would love to see it amazing job on all you have posted
---
BUT MUH BP ECONOMY!!!
---
Ghostface to hide in lockers
---
That sucks well not using it until it's patched
---
Can't muddle that BP economy, after all!
---
Ruin - Obviously 
---
BBQ - Because BP and Auras
---
Tinkerer's - Its like having free prayer beads several times a game. This works especially well if you have a good speed boost while ghosting equipped.
---
PGTW - If you can get there fast enough and grab someone off a gen, you can then knock the generator back below 80% so it re-procs Tinkerers if they come back to it.
---
I refuse to play survivor till the FOV locking issue is addressed for ultrawide monitors. I don't want to resize my freaking desktop so I can see the survivors head and feet.
---
Thank you, so much!
---
Play with Me actually avoids a 2 gen strat as it's only active until 1 gen is left. In which case, it'll make a 3 gen strat earlier at worst.
---
I updoot your downdoot
---
It sounds to me like you’re just a bad killer.
---
He would be blind if he looked straight at you and didn’t see you.
---
You’re wasting your time
---
Damn fine work!
---
Confirmed. You’re just bad.
---
Don't get your hopes up.
---
As the Myers I can confirm this happens often and it's ALWAYS hilarious when you just snatch em by the throat and punish them for being cocky
---
This would be the perfect cosplay, if there was a cock attached to it.
---
"Playing this killer means you are toxic"
---
Please learn how to play against Legion instead of saying people who play them are toxic.
---
is it really hide and seek in R6?
---
That's true... What's her face look like? She cute though? Or does she need the bag?
---
The deer had borrowed time.
---
The Killer literally hit the exit lever. It'd be stupid to not think that means "You can go"
---
That’s 100% wrong :)
---
No Im with you dude just wanted a more in depth discussion on what they looked like from your perspective. Now what I'd say is rob zombies hoodie/breaded Michael myers, bed sheet Michael myers ( from the original movie when old buddy went to go get beer from the van and ended up killing them and took his costume and then strangled out his girlfriend), and dirty aged michael from the new reboot would be cool. 
---
But we are getting Michael Cosmetics though but I'm not sure if it's the Asylum closed or the hospital closed.
---
Seriously. They have one job and they can't even do it properly. I know that game development isn't as simple as baking brownies by following the instructions on the back of the box, but it's not impossible, either. If I fucked up consistently at my job, I'd get the boot.
---
Yeah. Something'll get through. Nobody's perfect. But at least they're making sure you can play the fucking game and not killing it with every little action. Hell, they just told us about how Hag's power was messed up and that they fixed it.
---
Yes
---
But survivors that use balanced landing, adrenaline, dead hard, and other meta perks with flashlights and insta heals are fine :)
---
Yeah, if you're exhausted the passive stagger reduction still works. It's what makes it such a good perk. It sucks if there's no place to jump from though.
---
Yep. By 6%.
---
I've been playing since early access, so I'm well aware of how much worse it was. Infinite loops are still in there.
---
Hmmm yes and no. Problem I see is. As killer if I get an early kill the game becomes so much easier and I can literally play with my food. Pun intended. When you attempt to make sure each survivor has 3 hooks and a lot of back and forth trying not to tunnel or whatever. If the survivors are optimal you can lose quickly any leverage you had and never be able to recover. 
---
I don't honestly know the best solution. Easy fix is to increase gen times. But I am not sure if that is actually a good fix. Seems more like a bandaid to the problem. 
---
There are many perceived problems. Maps too large for some killers. Is a problem I hear a lot. As a killer I just say "challenge accepted".
---
I think giving a meaningful second objective that directly correlates to completing gens is a good solution. Totems do not correlate to gens at all outside of NOED and ruin, but ruin is still easy to run through if you are a solid survivor.
---
I think providing parts of gens around the map to collect to then begin repairs. Like 2 parts to find and run them to a gen before you can start it. That maybe feels a bit annoying to some but I think that is probably better than just increase gen times. 
---
You could use small game or detectives hunch too help locate those parts or similar perks. 
---
I don't think the game balance is bad. It really imo comes down to balance with objectives and increasing gen times is boring.
---
how the game should really be played.
---
Would love to play against a group that isn't. All I get are teabaggers, swarmers, and sore winners.
---
I think it's cause like 2 months from release the devs completely changed the game.
---
Seems this subreddit doesn’t like him
---
I personally watch his videos all the time and it actually helped me grow as a killer early on.  He also plays survivor and I watch those 
---
People just like to hate, probably because he talks about balance a lot (even though he’s not wrong...)
---
I have this one :)
---
No, but they shouldn't spawn in the wide open, which happens 9 times out of 10.
---
Yeah, I figuered this was the way it worked, but it really shouldn't.
---
And stabbed her with DS to... DEATH!
---
...Nice
---
"Why am i running??" 
---
Gets stabbed* 
---
Crap that's why! 
---
Runs away* 
---
Looks back, Wait why am I running again?
---
I’m sorry it’s just that every time I play Legion I get at least one person telling me I’m toxic for playing it. Also, are people seriously unable to recognize sarcasm unless you put a /s?
---
No it's one of those "when you see it, you'll shit bricks" things
---
I like her

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dngjku/is_this_a_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That definitely seems more interesting than other reworks I've seen, but it's hard to envision exactly how it would play out. Aware survivors are also not that heavily impacted by obliviousness, and still having to hit people twice while being taller than nearly every loop would be still detrimental to her. I know the devs, or at least one of the designers of Plague have outright said that repair speed slowdown with her sickness would likely never be a thing because it simply isn't a fun mechanic to go against.
---
haha i swear he did xD but fair enough
---
And my new wallpaper 👌
---
You have to do the doctor now
---
That shit was messed up
---
Im dying to see a martian from mars attacks from you now
---
Hmmm, you’re right on that. Maybe make no skillcheck warning and items become useless like doctor’s madness tier III? Not sure on that part, I forgot to make the punishment more severe
---
Autocorrects a bitch
---
That first glitch was definitely your internet lmao
---
I look forward to seeing the result
---
If you catch a killer with ds by using locker that is the dumbest killer ive seen xD
---
everything that comes out of the mouth of these developers is just a stupid pretext
---
lol no way dude. I was just tapping gen for a bit and then threw myself to Freddy. This game pisses me off
---
This year's Halloween event topics are players vs BHVR  up the ass ;-)
---
I think he usually plays in red~purple ranks. If you're talking about player level, I dunno
---
I'd argue that anything that benefits the group while putting them at risk isn't acting like a survivor. If, you know, we're arguing rp.
---
Also, it's not a slippery slope at all. There's a direct correlation - survivors should try to survive, killers should try to kill. Survivors shouldn't expect to get the hatch, same as killers shouldn't expect the last surv to come seeking them out after getting 3 kills. There's no BM involved, and saying "oh, going for the 4k means it's fair for me to BM you" is simply bullshit. The killer going for their objective is not a valid reason for me to go out of my way to ruin their day. The survivors hitting gens is no excuse for me to camp and tunnel them down. 
---
But yeah, other than those two bits, I agree with what you're saying.
---
when you're rank 10 and get rank 5 SWF survivors... smh
---
Shriek
---
The killer and the other survivors were around rank 12. I am rank 6
---
Are they though? A dev team that gave a fuck wouldn't let hitboxes be broken for years. Something important to how the game works like that shouldnt be completely broken.
---
Because people were asking them if there was gonna be one since there was last year.
---
hello Levi from the official dbd discord server
---
When you wanna survive by **any** means necessary
---
she has face of baby and body of milf.
---
also i lost a pip for that
---
I've seen other people having this problem. It's probably due to the dedicated servers being new. Still buggy. That's just a guess though.
---
I can only see Michael's leg.
---
I wouldn't hold my breath. If the new revenue from the cosmetic store addition with it's nickel-and-dime currency along with all the DLC revenue wasn't enough, the Rift probably won't be either.
---
Thats kinda what I thought
---
I dont agree with your logic. You think they chose mori length to incorporate some sort of balance? And that alt mori's with better timing would push this delicate balance in chaos? That is not nearly close to reality. Not only mori timing is as situational as grabbing a survivor on a totem to avoid their burrowed time instead of hitting them, but also it is not balanced between killers in any conceivable way.
---
"Pop a squat with me, let's talk about the finer perks in life, life botany knowledge."
---
I really want them to make 2 killers as an actual gamemode.
---
yeh its REALLY bad the past couple weeks. i'm a survivor main and i watch one player get knocked and D/C and yeh it just snowballs and im the last one left alive :( like... dafaug do i do now, and just let the killer get me cause no point... Sorry this happened to you &lt;3 Some survivors are entitled pricks.
---
im a nurse main and it never seems to happen with her. maybe one, rarely 2 but never all 4. its ridiculous
---
But then it would either be useless because it takes too long, or if it slows down when if stops healing now it wouldnt matter.
---
My Bets are on Vigo or that other Guy b something
---
This guy said killers control the pace 😂😂😂 have you seen how fast gens get done? Get outta here
---
You're breathraking!
---
10k points after 1 hit. Slightly over exaggerating
---
:'( i will light a candle in your memory..
---
Yes, this is what troubles me, there's no way they didn't know before. 12 hours prior makes it sound that they were trying hard to make it to the deadline, but if the fix is taking this long then they should knew that they won't making it
---
Until he smacks u on the hook n face camps u TvT

Don't mean to sound like an asshole but I find myself doing that too.
---
Pretty much anyone that's half decent at the game will get a 4k with Spirit. She's almost uncounterable with very little counters that do any good on the long run.
---
Even if you run Iron Will she's still 90% gonna catch you
---
Done. Thanks

Freshmen College life

Give him the pan, give him the bonk on the head!

Np
---
Let me enjoy the idea that the Entity is just a really socially awkward girl who doesn't know how to talk to people so the killers bring the survivors up to her but kill them.
---
Entity-chan just wants friends.
---
ART.
---
He got reworked so they sources are probably old
---
i heard truetalent got bald from playing to much dbd
---
is that true?
---
What are you? Long John (dong?) silver?
---
I guess people are sick of facing the same killer the whole time
---
Spine chill doesn’t  work on t1 Myers bud!
---
Riiight
---
Jesus what is this reddit 🙃
---
Longer sigh *unzips mouth*
---
Yeah I’m only thirteen and I dont know how to make anything so I just got it
---
*Exposed*
---
No he was always bald I think I have never seen him without his cap
---
Not necessarily. I think it's wise of them to not announce any date at all for this patch so that they don't feel obligated to release it if any complications arise in the build. 
---
I frankly wouldn't be too surprised if it's out within a few days. I just don't think they want to give us a set date for it.
---
I am available to answer question ...
---
That is tru, my bad :) then it look nice and i like it! Y the uncloak with pride already works with Play with your food. Its quite strong and you gain stack fast makning you a racecar. Pride will be less speed but works on all survivors. Problaby a nice combo cause you can farm PWYF stacka and bloodlust at the same time on the obsession. Most likley strongest on a one shot build to precerve stacks/bloodlust. So hex:haunted ground and hex: devourer hope looks good. I realy like your perk idés!!
---
This is excellent. More art coming next?
---
Yes yes we do
---
awww it's so cute ♥
---
Tru3 is the same dude who tells you not to stalk as Ghost Face as it isn't "optimal" to him. At that point, I stopped listening to him.
---
People usually only dc when the killer slugs them to find the last guy.
---
News flash: It's not fun staying on the ground for 4 minutes without being able to do anything
---
I think you posted this on the wrong subreddit
---
I said amazing not OP, big difference. Its also not falling for dead hard, the distance it gives on command with no downside can easy get you to a good pallet or window if your smart in a loop, i normally wait out dead hard but they can still use it effectively by just not falling for the bait. Gen rushing isnt a thing necessarily, but 3 mins to finish the game is nuts, you gotta agree with that. I wasnt going to mention any of the things you mentioned because all of those (including instas) negatively impact the game in a huge way, besides ruin. Although it is pretty mandatory this point, i prefer corrupt because survivors can either gen tap, spawn on ruin, or just hit greats and power through. Also, rank isn't l relevant to knowledge but it is relevant to how you apply that knowledge. You havent told me why key isnt OP yet, still coming up with something or are you using playground arguments and trying to say "no its not" over and over?
---
Uuuhhh
---
At least they wont quit non-stop
---
Great shading!
---
This is amazing!!! Have you thought about doing the huntress? I would love to see you do all the killers if you had the time!!!
---
They're dicing it mid-chapter patch
---
it was glitched to where every time you mended it would take longer. It got to the point it was faster to just let yourself down. Basically it was bugged, which is why people got in trouble before the fix.
---
DBD community has so much artistic skill. Amazing piece, hope to see more!
---
Pretty sure they said they're nerfing the perk so that it doesn't see killers in the undetectable state like ghost face or wraith, so that's cool
---
If you quit you ruin the game for survivors, not the killer
---
Can’t even open my phone in public anymore SMH
---
She's just buying ppl time
---
No.. so heres a funny story.. I used an offering for pig.. it somehow got bugged and I played with wraith that match.. I get out of the match and there she is lol
---
Yes TY, I just realized that 
---
lol ... Not the same light ? lol
---
Congrats
---
As a killer, I don't need your kill, you DCing lets me get to the other survivors faster.  You're just screwing over your team mates.
---
Object of Obsession is only helpfull if you are in SFW and you keep telling your teammates your position. Though Freddy is actually on of the only killers who can easily counter OoO, killer like Ghostface also Undetectable, he cant do anything against it, but freddys chases are very quick. I am not sure how you think he is weak. Look at a video from Otzdarva, he completely destroyed OoO.
---
RunningMan on Twitch plays every killer and takes killer/build requests.
---
Where did i say it was toxic? where did you read that?
---
Oh, I see. It's a decently common glitch. Next time you startup your game itll be locked again
---
Ah, yes, the og ghostface
---
If you get tunneled, the killer is obviously desperate for a kill. If I’m getting camped and tunneled, they aren’t going to suddenly stop for other survivors. The game is ruined from the start
---
It’s fine, I was just saying
---
It depends all on the player tbh, he can be an absolute beast in the right hand but a baby in the wrong ones
---
Sounds like a you problem, don't do then if you don't want to. I mean it your game doesn't depend on them, unless I'm missing something.
---
there are no skillchecks for mending. often, new players will not realize that they have to mend and go down because they are unfamiliar with how FF works. unless you use a specific addon/perk build, FF will not usually down survivors. if you used perks that removed your Terror radius, like tinkerer or dark devotion, you would find that the timer would decrease even with you around.
---
As legion is currently a very niche stall/m1 killer, Ruin, thanatophobia, sloppy butcher, nurses calling, pop goes the weasel, BBQ, Spirit fury, discordance, and shadowborn (by preference) and enduring are all very good.
---
The franks mixtape build is only for fun really, and for experienced legion players imo. 
---
Hope this helps. frank best boy btw.
---
You didn’t directly call them toxic but you said you face camp people because they use them and you also compared them to insta heals and other toxic things
---
Demoman with a demoknight loadout, hands down. With the Tide Turner, control is so much easier than Hillbilly with max control, as old Tavish here can just as easily turn as when he isn't charging. While Hillbilly does instantly put people out of commision with one hit from this at close range, that is nowhere near the ability of Demoknights practically being able to twoshot you at any range, if they are going hybrid, which is standard. On top of that, Demoknight can pretty easily take more blows than your average Demoman, or even the Hillbilly, which can easily be put out of commision with a goddamn flashlight, objects dropped on him, and even a goddamn sharp object to the back.
---
This should be the accepted answer. Play by the games rules, killers kill, sruvivors survive. If things like Mori instaheal spirit nurse are too OP and makes it unfun.. D E V E L O P E R S
---
Try 13 FPS
---
That is truly the scariest thing in this game
---
This is not a dbd meme, it is happiness turned into a picture
---
I've been having fun so far, it's a pretty good game.
---
Like DBD however, you'll have a much better time playing with friends.
---
Honestly, I love Aftercare but people just constantly lead the killer to me.
---
They are already tho
---
Their names on the bottom left corner have a clock going around it and when it times out, they fall asleep.
---
More like 1, he used iron grasp I and brutal strength II alongside NOED
---
Grow up kid, play another game or take that L like a man. It's Dead by Daylight, there are no rules, these things happen. I'm sure you are the most "honest" and "fair" of survivors out there...gtfo.
---
"Then stop face camping me dad!"
---
I'm like 75% survivor and 25% killer. So when I suit up as a killer, I'm going to kill and sacrifice you. I'm not gonna camp the hook or wait until the end game collapse for u to die.
---
I will show no mercy bc this games norm for survivors is to tbag at the exit gates or at the very least just stay at the gates just as a last ditch effort humiliate the killer. There's no reason to be nice to survivors when they act like children.
---
So, you won the match, just leave. I hate tbaggers especially in this game because survivors use it like a badge of honor and even got told one time that it's the job for the survivors to tbag the killer.
---
Uhhh I Think That's Incest
---
When the Clown's gas disappears the sound of the mist keeps playing where it was thrown the whole round. PC.
---
Because everybody is tired of playing against Spirit, especially the half of them that just tunnel and camp the hook.
---
now this is quality
---
Awesome!!
---
For me, Toxic is someone that insults you personally, nothing related to gameplay. And keys are currently just as strong as ebony mori
---
This is absolutely perfect for me! I love these, I love the thought and effort behind all of these, and I love you!
---
Are you sarcastically implying people aren't tired of that? Dumb lol
---
Is it tho? Or was a couple of instances where he was upset?
---
I've seen him type gg regardless unless he was upset, no matter how it ended
---
But okay.. I guess in this sub everyone have a hate boner to this guy
---
Well I’m pretty sure they’re changing the insta heals so those won’t be as much of a problem.
---
I won’t argue that they are bullshit as they are now lol
---
Survivors are still half brain dead and don't realize how survivor favored this game is so I guess this meme makes sense to them lol
---
hope mom and dad don't find out ;)
---
Screw the hag.
---
I used to defend BHVR but I'm starting to get annoyed. 
---
Look, screw ups happen. It's life. I get it.  And cool, we're getting free content. I'm not expecting a game to run perfectly 100% of the time. Like anything, maintenance is required. But I dropped 20$ plus DLC(40$), it's nothing to ask for a game to run well 90% of the time. We're the ones keeping the game running, how about treating us with respect?
---
This would be an awesome tattoo
---
So.. catering to entitled kids who get upset if they lose that can't even take a "gg" after a game without interpret it as hostile. Got it..
---
For anyone who does this, stop playing. If you get triggered that easily for just a GG just stop playing for a while
---
I use f for struggling
---
“Gg ezy baby killer”
---
I don't know you tell me...
---
Is this VRchat? Lmao
---
The only thing you need to do as a survivor to use a key is do the objective and have people die. Also, things are given for free that arent OP. Rancor gives you a free kill but thats still not a good perk. Same goes for bitter murmur, poised, distortion, ect. There's so many perks that give you things for free, calling all of them OP is stupid, especially since alot of really OP things take at least some skill. A lot of people feel like DS is the best perk in the game right now. But, for it to work, you still at least have to hot a skillcheck and put yourself into a situation that its helpful if the killer doesnt tunnel (which most of the time isnt even the case, DS is kinda stupid as a timer perk, id like to see it be changed to you being the last person hooked and it goes away if someone else gets hooked. That way, it'd become worse against killers getting fast hooks and becomes better at preventing tunneling). NOED just happens to be probably the best killer perk and is also free, but, at least its counter-able. There's no way to truly counter a key because keys are activated by both sides objectives, kills and gens. Killers can't just stop hooking to counter keys because they will lose, survivors have a clear advantage in a game with a key, or without really. Keys prevent 3 gen strats, allow survivors to always win endgame if they find hatch, and allow all four survivors to escape at the same time. It rewards you for completing objectives by removing the need to do objectives, that's the stupid concept. Hatch as a whole is a dumb concept.
---
I'd love to see somewhat of a reverse endgame collapse in its place, similar to what Tru3 has talked about. If there's one survivor left. There'd be a timer started thats around 1-2 minutes and the killer can see the killer instinct of the survivor in maybe a 5 second interval. The survivor has the chase and survive the killer for that time period and then the survivor wins, if he gets hooked before the timer goes, the survivor loses. It's a simple way to remove the hatch mechanic while making it fun for both sides, a one on one chase against the clock is a way more fun mechanic then a quick game of "who already knows where the hatch is?".
---
So how do you all want the killers to play? Just stand still and not hit any of you?
---
I've long thought about doing something similar but with perk reworks/buffs for whats in the game. I mostly play survivor so I'll give my thoughts on some of those. I read quite a few Killer ones and there were some interesting ideas but I have my doubts on BHVR making some of them work (no flame but I have a suspicion you thought of "Davy Jones Locker" as a cool perk name and then struggled to find something that made sense).
---
Clockmaker's perks are cool but Crack of Dawn would almost never be useful with only 40 seconds imo.
---
Cook's perks are good but people would throw shitfits over Cookin' with Gas. Really like the supportive aspect of Food for the Soul but it seems like it would be hard to proc frequently.
---
Deal perks are an interesting concept, not sure on how good they'd be but maybe I'm misunderstanding.
---
Can't honestly see the Death Defying perks being all that useful, might be missing something.
---
Bone Dust is an interesting concept, Resourceful plus Autodidact is a nutty combo imo, I like Jerry-rigged conceptually but again I think it would be a bit of a time waster. You could setup some disgusting loop spots with it which might be cool.
---
Walk It Off is one of those perks that get added with a licensed survivor so BHVR can make money off of it and then nerf it into the floor a month later, same with War Hero.
---
Music perks are all very cool, Swan Song is probably WAY too powerful.
---
Bottom of the Barrel and Brave the Storm are really nice. Diligence would cause a LOT of complaints but I like the idea of consistently Dead Hard teching unhooked teammates.
---
Absolutely LOVE Foot in the Grave but holy shit would it piss some people off.
---
Gamble is fantastic, Ace needs more perks that rely on luck imo.
---
Vivacious is neat, again it'd be one that makes certain people moan.
---
The way i see it is that its your job to have fun and/or win or just play. If a mechanic is unbalanced, the community will voice their thoughts to the devs, and if its valid, it gets changed to a more fair state. That's how it works in every single game. You play the game, your way, with no cheating. You don't worry about the other team, it's their job to beat you, not yours. If it was your job to play with the opposite team I'm sure the devs would put a big ass notice up before you even press a button saying “YOU MUST PLAY IN A CERTAIN FASHION AGAINST SURVIVORS IF YOU ARE PLAYING KILLER, IF THEY ARE NOT AS SKILLED AS YOU OR ARE BEING BEATEN HARD, YOU MUST GO EASY ON THEM AND POSSIBLY ALLOW THEM TO ESCAPE. IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE RULES YOU SHALL BE PUNISHED” or just add a game mechanic that debuffs the killer/survivor. I don't see why this is one of the only game communities that thinks you have to be nice and give the opposite side more of an advantage just because they're losing. Just look after yourself and your team and just do whatever you want to your opponents (of course without cheating or extreme griefing, and dont be an absolute dickhead)
---
I wouldn’t say as strong as ebony mories but they are pretty strong I’d say just make the hatch spawn at no gens left with three people and 1 gen left for two people
---
Dope!!!!
---
🧂🧂🧂
---
Everyone in the comments being agro is very :/ any killer can be toxic and camp, almost all killers these days have ruin, if you don’t like people using perks that help them win then just play killer or don’t play at all. Tired of noed?? Do the dull totems, forehead
---
Survivors dc’ing when downed &amp; killers dc’ing when pallet stunned ruins the game more than toxicity. Everyone be taking this stuff so personally and forgetting we all just be here for points.
---
Actual mindgames are way more exciting than knowing how many times I can run a loop before I need to drop the pallet then run to the next loop. Plus I run Iron Will a lot anyway, it's good against all killers and as you said, very strong against spirit. I also love to use the Lithe + Dance With Me combo, which is great for escaping Spirit, or any other killer really. Spirit is strong, and prayer beads are too strong, but I enjoy games when the killer actually feels like a threat.

F to struggle, and maybe a mouse button to vault and things like that.

Not really. Remember Me only lowers the exit game time and you kind of need to tunnel the obsession a bit since they can open the gate at a normal speed. Dying Light is for gens and healing and you usually want to avoid your obsession as they don’t add any stacks.

Yeah I have yet to meet this mythical person.
---
I like how you guys pull words out of thin air and pretend I said them. Yep, totally what I said, my exact quote 👍
---
Myers. So fun. Freddy too.
---
I admit, I was clickbaiting a bit. 
---
Keys are not toxic, but they definitely annoying especially when survivors open hatch right in front of your face.
---
Still very poopy
---
Oh my god okay so this is taken from a famous speaker, who the fuck is it? i can't remember!!
---
Mate, terror radius is split into two unless your Michael, 32m and 24m, speed is split into two unless your Michael/nurse, first speed being 4.6m/s(115%) or 4.4m/s(110%). The only killer that are faster are because of their abilities (wraith, hillbilly, bubba, etc) and killers that are slower are because of their abilities (nurse, Michael, etc). High distinction is just tall, and whatever else there was that I forgot.
---
His perks are confusing, and somewhat over powered.
---
His first perk, i think you meant slows down the gens repair speed by 3/6/9, you also have to specify how many tokens can be had. A more balanced option, would be that its 3/4/5 for like four tokens.
---
Second perk: its fine, just a lil weird, a gen regresses 1% every three seconds, so something you could say is that for every token gained, a gen regresses slightly/slightly/moderately faster
---
Third perk is absurd, a normal heal takes around 13ish seconds, and say the obsession gets hooked twice, on tier three thats 43 seconds of healing. If the obsession gets hooked three times, thats a total of almost a minute (58 seconds).
---
His power is unique, but you have to give it some counters, one, when The Warden goes into surveillance mode, a mapwide sound gets played.  Two, having a survivor drop an item isn’t going to be very enjoyable above the exposed status, the exposed status is fine, you just have to do it like ghostface where you charge it up to expose them.
---
Ur one pathetic kid
---
At the exit gate. Waits for killer. Teabag like there's no tomorrow. "I just like your skin". Maybe sometimes that's the case. Though the majority of the time, it's likely not. Good for you though.
---
Thanks
---
What i read is, we will fix some major issues but still release the game with a plethora or minor issues. 
---
 We not going to release the game with the huge amount of crashing we had but we're fine with with releasing a patch with occaisional crashes.
---
 Things we fixed are the hags power and some other pointess shit.
---
Am i mistaken?
---
When you’re off the hook, you’re already injured. It makes more sense to go after the person who is close to death already than go after another healthy survivor.

I’m a merciful Susie

How is it survivor favored?

I also did get disconnected after so...
---
I had someone DC after getting put in the dying state ONCE not even hooked. Just on the ground.

Easy. i wanted to give help to the plague who chased this claudette for 4 gens and then decided to dc. So he can enjoy the game better, so he wont constantly rage quit.

You selling?
---
I think hes just giving advice. Idk how thats deemed rude or offensive.
---
Yeah PC always takes forever to get a killer game
---
Happy cake day, and good luck on your crusade.
---
Thats a man who gets toxic messages every game and just cant believe someone is being nice to him. I try to do this too! This community can be so toxic.
---
There’s a reason.
---
You can’t even read my posts correctly. You are just making up what I’m saying as you go along. You’re bad at strategizing and reading
---
Chili addons are said to be bugged. I think they are not, they are just so bad you won;t see any effect.
---
Oh neat, thx

FIX VAULTS it's been almost a year bhvr!!!!!
---
The point of playing killer is killing, what part do you not get? Some people don't care about progress, they care about playing the game the way they want, bit giving out free passes.
---
What?
---
I was honestly gonna say Spirit before MM but i’m excited!
---
Lol man you got more to worry about than just totem spawns if you still feel this game is heavily survivor-sided.  Killer is the power role against anything other than a solid-good swf.  If you still feel this powerless you need to develop your game still.  Not Otzdarva can help profusely.  I'd pop onto his YouTube channel.  He can knock the babykiller off anyone.
---
Fun fact, survivors can literally lose a pip and still get adept.
---
That’s the joke.
---
So you admit it’s about playing the game the way they want to play it, so when I’m prevented from playing the way I WANT TO PLAY because I get tunneled and camped, so I DC to find a better game, you say I’m in the wrong?
---
Does it really matter? Survivors already had instaheals nerfed, they don't need their only other strong items or addons nerfed unless killers get all of their strong addons nerfed. 
---
Flashlights and toolboxes are not strong. Perks don't always the outcome of the match. Killers have prayer beads, instasaws, iri head + infantry belt, 5 blink nurse (live), and depending on how good the survivors are then dream pallets too. You'd have to nerf all those (aside from dream pallets maybe) to even nerf keys.
---
You can't say "Well, what about the perks?" because 4 strong perks as survivor doesn't always mean you'll escape. 4 strong perks as killer makes it easier to get 3ks and 4ks tho. I run 4 strong perks and get 3ks a lot. I run 4 strong survivor perks and I  don't escape much.
---
SWF is what needs a nerf, not items. I can get better key plays in a SWF group than I do soloing. Keys already have a counter either way if you bring Franklins. Most people forget where they lost it after some time or they screw themselves over running over to pick the key up again.
---
Ah, I see. Trashtalking now. "Lol this guy doesn't agree with what I say so imma say he can't read" you said that you DC when the killer doesnt give you time to heal, so that means you want a free pass. You aren't getting a free pass
---
And they are treating you with respect? They've literally updated you on the current situation and what to expect.
---
Unless you think respect means "magically fix a complex issue using the power of unicorn farts"
---
I wouldn't mind the key so much if three big things were changed:
---
More time was added, fuck, ANY time is added before they can open a hatch. I'm sorry but it shouldn't be an instant "Fuck you, I get away and there's nothing you can do!" Kind of item. 
---
Secondly, the requirements to use the key should change. Sorry but, completing 2 gens and 1 guy is dead should not let you able to use the key. No. 4 gens and 1 guy dead. That would be fair. Or give the key any kind of drawback. Like, okay, you have to complete a x amount of gens or unhooks to be able to use it. 
---
And FFS, if a guy holding the key is killed then it should go away.
---
"But you keep quitting matches when tge killer sees you"
---
You DC when the game doesnt go the way you want. This is flawed on both sides. It isn't fun to get tunneled, but you can't expect free passes. And when you DC, its not fun for teamates. The game's fucked up on both sides.
---
did consoles get dedicated servers for testing too? if yes than that probably is your anwser; you are used to lag as survivor since you always had to deal with if, but killers only recently got a taste of lag. especially when your connection isn't the best
---
Yep, especially since most perks are shit. Ghostface has 1 perk that's good for chases and 2 that are good for nothing.
---
I said you can’t read because you’re literally making up things that I’m saying. I never said people need a free pass, I don’t DC when I’m not given time to heal, you’re legit making things up about me now
---
That's a lot of moms
---
It is a joke. Extremely situational like I said. I remember when Freddy first came out and we looked at his perks like "Okay, cool. Devs are changing it up and we no longer are forced to use Ruin! We can use an end game build!" NOPE.
---
You said that the killer needs to give you time to heal, it seems you can't keep track of what you said
---
I’ve had that happen on an occasion and rebooting my internet router helped. That’s even with a LAN cable into my ps4.
---
Legit quote me saying this exact sentence and I’ll admit you’re right on everything you said
---
It's okay they're still fully clothed. /s
---
Ultimate respect
---
Mikey seems more then stabby there. :^)
---
This is really really good :)
---
cause he’s cocky
---
She’s camouflaged into it lol
---
Yeah I started playing more as killer and I still suck but I made it to level 16. I've noticed since I've started "moving up" the longer it takes to find a match. Two days ago I was in a lobby for ~20 minutes with 3 survivors before I backed out
---
I think you did a pretty good job so far (in a good way)
---
Number of gens completed required for hatch to spawn:
---
4 survivors = 5 gens completed
---
3 survivors = 4 gens completed
---
2 survivors = 3 gens completed
---
1 survivor = There doesn't have to be any gens completed
---
You can't complete 2 gens and escape when 1 guy is dead. Hatch doesn't spawn that early into the game unlike what you have said where completed 2 gens and 1 guy is dead lets you use the key. If you nerf key to have a drawback, map needs a drawback too. Both can reveal auras (map without addons, key with addons) meaning you would have to make both the key AND the map have the same requirements on auras. Key tracking is basically a shittier version of map tracking, so there is no point to use keys other than opening hatch.
---
Adding a drawback removes the point of keys. Being unable to use it unlesss you get X unhooks or complete X gens makes it too weak. Just leave it as it is. I play killer and sometimes survivor and have no problem with anything considered "OP" or "strong" for either side aside from prayer beads which should definitely get nerfed.
---
Most of the time when you are in a SWF you can get the 2 survivor hatch escape off. When you are soloing it isn't as easy because you have to find the random and get the rando to follow you. That doesn't always work because sometimes the rando is like "What are you doing? Work on a gen."  Soloing makes it harder to get good key plays and instaheal plays off.  Nerfing keys and instas nerfs solo survivors at the same time even if the nerf is for a good reason.
---
Cry more killer.
---
I don't get it? It says highest and lowest but there are 3 killers?
---
For real, lol. I can’t remember the last game I played without at least 3 decisive strikes and 3 adrenalines. Then they throw a tantrum when I have NOED.
---
Duuuude that is nice. I have those too but i can't draw for shit
---
I mean, at that point Moris are just a third hook right? they don't really give you any big advantage to bringing them. The issue being there is no real middle ground, Moris turn the game from 2 hooks kill you to 1 hook kills you. I mean, depending on where you are, they can save you some time, but I don't know if that's worth the offering slot at that point when you could use something to boost your BP gain.
---
I was scared but now I'm horny
---
I love you op. You just gave me the solution to my problem. Off to go earn my Jake skin!
---
Okay mr bright side
---
Whats wrong? Are you talking about the matchmaking (which is fine) or the broken graphics?
---
I think we met the same person this happened to me last night.
---
I forgot what movie this was from.
---

---
Nice job!
---
I  was in the mall yesterday and had a laugh at the big ad in front of the Hot Topic advertising their "sexy" scoops a hoy cosplays for women
---
I need to. Only sucky thing about first getting into this game. Tryna get all teachables
---
I use NumPad 0 since its a key that I won't mind if it breaks due to having to spam it on struggle.
---
Ohhh okay. Interesting
---
Average Dbd cosplayer
---
Really impressive, great job!
---
She can mori me anytime.
---
if someone goes for the person who just got unhooked, play with some skill and get the person who farmed instead of the person who *got* farmed. If you are that bad at killer that you cant down another person, you have bigger problems.
---
If you having no fun by no fault but your own precludes other people's enjoyment of the match it sounds particularly self centered to me.
---
I'd personally like to see just a couple killer buffs to make playing killer more balanced.
---
Moris, Ruin and NOED should all be base kit.  Hex totems should all spawn outside the walls of the map.  It should only take one M1 hit with a deadly weapon to down because lore.  We should have 8 perk slots, survivors get 2.  And before generators can be repaired  the survivors have to find the engineering class on the map and successfully pass the course with an 85% passing grade or better before they can initiate a repair.
---
I think she looks like a pretty woman... but dead
---

No he just says the game sucks in every post he sees.
---
As a leather face main, I feel this. 
---
But I always have Ebony Moris on standby.
---
dont play spirit, she is leading you to ranks you are not ready for. Play a killer like billy or wraith to learn easy mindgames and overall improve your game sense. 
---
The reason why the survivors are toxic is bc you are playing spirit. No one likes spirit
---
Careful of the Iron Grasp
---
Great job, is that supposed to be Michael from the new movie? The mask has worn quality to it
---
When that happens to me, as killer or survivor, I usually type "Well, that happened".
---
I'm not saying it was a good game, but I'm not saying it was a bad game. I'm just letting everyone else in the match know that... it was a thing.
---
Its not that big of a deal, im sure there are plenty of things you do that aren't perfect that you don't realise and at the end of the day it doesn't really matter, he's got the crowd, the donations etc. If he were to drop his accent accent (Which is quite frankly why I watch him, and his tell it how it is attitude) then he would just be another generic sub 1k dbd streamer (Not that theirs anything wrong with that)
---
Certainly made a mistake in attracting people like you to the game away from LoL
---
Doubtful. I don't know why people think this any time a company introduces a new revenue stream. Its never true.
---
Remember when everyone said Nintendo would fix their online services once they had a subscription? It never happened. Not a single cent of that money went towards improving the service.

“You’re not entitled to hatch, okay folks.” Trapper Shapiro.
---
yes
---
Ehm.. he stated he want to see new, more diligent and professional, coders that can do a better job. They can do that easily since now BHVR is big enough to do so, taking out the bad ones
---
Your logic is very dumb if you think a customer shouldn't criticize their decisions about the product unless they can fix it, code and so on. Please, don't be a kid and use your brain for more than 0.1s a day
---
Why is everything deepfried, holy shit
---
You killers want your totems to be untouchable... Run Thrill of the Hunt that's the fix.
---
I took a vacation day on Tuesday and I'm not mad. Maybe if DBD is the only thing in your life you have any excitement over.
---
You’re 100% right that posts like that do not help anyone.
---
But the lack of communication mixed with them skipping other events for this feels very bad, and being as quiet about what is going on gives nobody any idea.
---
Posts like the meme here, showing the “understanding” as these beefy cake guys and that everyone upset is just a whiny little jerk doesn’t help either, it drives a wedge further in.
---
Killer isn't the power role in DbD. You have to rely on punishing Survivor's mistakes more than anything else.
---
This meme was meant for you then it seems
---
Too cute!
---
My favourite skin hands down, it's so adorable
---
This must be a joke response
---
I knew I recognised the typical movements :D
---
Davy Jones Locker was originally going to be a different perk but was swapped out in the making. It wasn't too hard to come up with something for it, but there's not too much I can do as far as lockers are considered in this game.
---
Crack of Dawn is half of a generator and can be used by 4 survivors. This means that if you find them all on a generator, you would hit one and they'd run off with endurance. You hit another and they'd run off with endurance. You hit another etc. It's actually probably a bit too long of a buff.
---
Food for the Soul would be a bit hard to consistently proc but there are also other perks that may introduce a higher skill chance.
---
Yeah, it's unknown how strong deal perks would be with their trade offs without some playtesting.
---
The latter two of the Death Defying section is helpful in chases and mindgaming the killer. Imagine it this way: You hit a survivor and the survivor goes around a corner in lery's. There is no tracks. They aren't making injured noises. They know where you're running and where you aren't. It's a big boost to gain some distance or trick the killer.
---
With perks like Inner Strength and items like medkits, Walk it Off might not see too much use or be seen as all that strong. War hero has the potential to be as annoying to killers as Adrenaline and in my eyes, fun is the most important aspect.
---
Swan might need numbers tweaked, yes.
---
Diligence might see some complaints for sure. But as it was said, sins and virtues weren't made in mind for balance, rather, challenge.
---
Foot in the Grave has the potential to be a MoM if released as is, I'm a bit skeptical of it myself.
---
Gamble is nice but it's dangerous with how strong keys are.
---
Vivacious will at least help those poor saps who go from first hook to death hook!
---
----
---
I really appreciate you going through and giving your piece on all these perks, it's really really insightful and gives me new directions and ideas for changing them.
---
me to the meg who dc'd because she cornered herself when i was leatherface
---
I play more killer than I do survivor and have NO problem playing keys. I've played both sides and realize that keys aren't as bad as people say they are and that NOED isn't as strong as people think. If you get annoyed by survivors jumping into hatch in front of you, it's your on fault. 
---
If the survivor hatch escaped in front of you, then they were most likely getting chased. You can run Franklins and make the survivors have to run back to get the keys or not get the key at all. You can play Spirit for an easier 4k. You can buy Leatherface and grind for Franklins or when Franklins gets on the Shrine immediately get it. 
---
Either way, you don't come across keys a lot unless you're unlucky. The same goes for moris and instaheals. If a strong item is not in most matches often, then there is not much of a reason to nerf them. I never got against key the last 3 months. I've only gotten against moris a few times the last 3 months when my name had "MORI ME" in it. I don't think either keys or moris need a nerf at all and I won't change how I feel about moris and keys unless they start getting used all the time.
---
That's cute. Sad that the real discussion made Ben shithiro show how dumb he really is
---
Still a nice meme if not taking into consideration where it came from
---
Demogorgon’s got nes-level textures on
---
If 3-4 gens get done before I down one survivor I just leave because getting Gen rushed by 4 immerisve Claudettes who won't even be chased isn't fun
---
Nice! Got a favorite, by chance?
---
If a player intentionally DCs I give his team free bp and a win, dude is missing out
---
I'll keep it in mind
---
I don't see Bubba anywhere in that meme
---
&gt;my teammates will be screwed anyway because you’ll just keep coming for me because I’m ‘the weakest’ and will hook me constantly.
---
This is where you're wrong, if all they do is tunnel and camp then by staying playing that little extra bit can make the killer lose a couple minutes. your team can easily complete 1-3 gens in that time. If you just DC thats a lot of gen time that the rest of the survivors got screwed out of, and a decent killer can manage 3 players fairly well. 
---
 Even on death hook, I've been on both sides where there was a second survivor nearby and the 1st DC'd when downed for what would've been on death hook. With the DC the killer can just shift to the second survivor with 0 second thought as it's now the optimal play, whereas if you just laid and did nothing the killer has to make the choice to chase and let you stay slugged and potentially healed, or to take the kill and allows the survivor to get away easily.
---
by DCing you are rewarding the killer's behaviour and screwing over your team mates.
---
Oh wow this game sucks and I comment it on every single post. But I'm still here for over 1000 hours and still bitching on every post. I have a lot of other things to do with my time, I just want to let everyone know how bad this game is that I probably still have open as we speak.
---
I don't see anal beads tho
---
What does it do?!!!!
---
Hehe boi
---
While you are correct, none of the shenanigans from the early days are still in the game. (Thankfully)
---
Oh wow, i like to call people entitled every time they say something i dont like, so i distort every thing they said as to make me look right
---
Kills dont mean literally nothing, you get pips by how much of a fucking toy you are to Survivors.
---
You forgot the towel at the crotch, it really makes the costume
---
I had a survivor complain how I found him after he hid and I told him about scratch marks, he didnt even know what they were and he 600hrs in the game
---
Flair checks out
---
This is outdated and false.  Killers are easily the power role at this point against soloqueue.  Even a shitty swf of just a few friends playing isn't that big of a deal for killers anymore.  It takes a solid coordinated swf team to become the power role in game.
---
I love these types of posts
---
And now, being serious, you arent saying anything about free time after everything you and i commented right?
---
I’m not sure about the dedicated servers being for consoles as well.
---
Chances are that is what it is, so does that mean I just have to wait it out and hope they get it sorted?
---
Worth noting also that the killers I’ve been up against as survivor seem the same skill level/doesn’t look like they have lag problems. But then again, I can’t truly know that.
---
You forgot TF2, who had it October 1st.
---
if the killer plays good and I'm not on first hook I'll crawl my ass to a hook. you earned your 4k buddy.
---
That being said I've been offered an astounding amount of hatches, even on games where I played like a 5 thumbed moron.
---
This post is completely stupid. In what way are keys toxic ??? It’s an item Survivors can bring to have a way or optional way to escape.
---
The hell are you talking about? Shitting on the devs is like half the content here.
---
With a base kit so good, who needs amazing addons?
---
I didn’t say I DC on first hook or second hook. I try to stay in the game as long as possible and keep the killer busy, but if I know I’m gonna be tunneled and it’s my last hook I DC because I know at most I’m getting 8,000 points. I’ve been tunneled enough to realize it’s not worth it, and if I DC as second to last Survivor at least my friend or random can get hatch in time and scummy killer gets screwed over final kill.
---
Well memes are fine but ask any fans of him and every video has at least these memes:
---
Im a bad bitch you cant kill me
---
Helooo
---
Sup bitch suck my dick bitch
---
Do you honestly think youre fucking funny
---
Like when they are overused they stop being funny
---
Self wrecking
---
Every little bit helps and I don't want nurse and Billy to be the only killers good enough for high ranks

I’ve found that going into the customization tab and going to the store allows you to cancel the never ending search and from there you can go back and queue up again

---
I think the second and third are equally likely. Its very clear that its intended to make evan look like the bad guy. While with all things considered archies morality isnt ever quite defined aside from ruling with an iron fist. But secondly. Aside from the lore. Look at the game itself. The chase mechanic bloodlust is present by saying. "These people want to kill you so bad" and thusly if it really is Evan, then he must have murderous intent built in. And thats why i think both 2 and three are correct. But some of the add ons lead me to beleive they were both murderers or otherwise murderous in some way.

Hag main big D I C K

Then it wouldn’t work

You think the event won't be buggy?

I wish i could could at least get bullied, ive been inactive so long im back to rank 20, and i cant get a match. Sad boy hours over here
---
The one running OoO.
---
Vegas.
---
How you saying duh, such a bad perk for spirit. Surveillance exists for a reason.
---
I'm not playing spirit for the sake of easy games, I'm plague and demo main. I'm not going to use Franklin in every game because this will ruin my builds and because sometimes i won't even be able to knock that key out of their hands, because they just play stealth the whole game -&gt; find hatch -&gt; EVERYONE GET IN HERE. I'm not even talking they can find it in chests. 
---
Just because keys have some counterplay the don't become less frustrating and infuriating to play against. The fact that someone can deny your victory so easily is inappropriate and it must be changed. Survivors using keys aren't risking anything, because even Franklin is not a guaranteed way to get rid of the key. My changes will make using keys a bit more risky and challenging.
---
Billy? I mean you cant really improve it to much. But in a vague contest. I think "deformed man grts tired of it and kills his family" is the most vague. So vague i can summarize it in one sentence
---
Nah foo, they're gettin tier 3 off each other
---
You can disconnect the from the game and still be in the post-game chat?
---
I play red rank killer and have for years.  Our games have never been easier than they are right now.  After a year solid of survivor nerf updates it finally feels pretty good playing killer.  Again those losses you cited are against skilled swf teams.  I promise you those losses aren't soloqueue or middling swf teams.  
---
We have more than just Nurse and Spirit by the way.  Freddy is every bit as capable of getting it done with his rework against sweat squads.  Billy has always been good.  Hag and Huntress have always been solid.  I've beaten great teams with Wraith, Legion, Trapper etc....
---
If you still feel this out of control of your killer games against soloqueue at this point in the games balance I promise you that's a personal problem.  Take a long hard look at how you're losing those games and look for the holes in your game because I promise you they're there.
---
No, it's true.  Even if you're dead on hook, don't DC.  You're taking up the killer's time carrying you to the hook and your death on the hook will break the hook.  Stop screwing over your teammates.
---
Saem
---
Oh no me galatic currency!
---
Is today the last day for contest?
---
No video, likely means you’re just salty and making things up
---
Haha survivors are entitled so funny haha
---
The killer didnt bring purple toolboxes with bnp to the match. I'm not saying it's against the rules or necessarily even toxic, but it doesnt make for a fun match. And that's my thing, I play for fun. I dont need 4k to have fun. But getting steamrolled because ruin is cheap isn't fun either. Especially when getting matched with people six ranks better than me.
---
I do
---
Console doesnt have dedicaated servers. Unless ur on pc with controller.
---
Yea you’re right that’s the only time that happens.  /s
---
1200 hours in and I play default Jake.  But I also play vanilla Skyrim, so I'm pretty bland.
---
I generally hate DCs, people are missing out on points
---
If you like Pig, youll love Ghostface.
---
Your cosplay attempt huh? That's funny cuz I've seen this picture around the internet for years.
---
A pig perk? Not everyone has money to drop on this game bud.
---
Yeah with all the instaheals i kinda have to
---
I think camping and tunneling in game is understandable.  Sucks to be on the receiving end of it but if the killer hasn't gotten a sac yet then they do what they gotta. I personally spread the love and tend to play obsession or end game builds so I can take my time and not focus on one person. If I play a bad game I'll camp my only hook once the gates are open, or if you're clocking a flashlight and teabagging then I will tunnel and camp you until you are gone.m, nodding all the while.
---
I can catch them, but as soon as i do i have 3 survivors flashlight spamming and guarding the hook because they love To play it fair.
---
I suddenly want an ice cream.
---
first of don’t say bud, you’re 12. Secondly pig DLC is on sale and as you clearly lack knowledge on the subject, shrine of secrets exists for a reason.
---
It might be a visual glitch due to player disconnect, but I've never seen anything like this before. Is it PS4 right?

Nice, decent. The dimensions and ratios of the arms are a little off but those are easy to get wrong. Good work.

Nice, reads a lil assassin's creed.
---
I'm kinda small and short all over except....
---
It’s a reference to Shapiro’s infamous BBC interview
---
Are you looking away from their flash light? Like what's going on cuz it could be a bug
---
The game in general is the best for everyone. Maybe the nurse struggles becuse if you are on the second floor and you charge M2 and then the survivors turn arround and run into you, you can not aim the ground for a short blink (because you would blink to the first floor). Also is harder to find survivors.
---
I play hag, Freddie, Ghostboi and demogorgon as my main killers, and my favorite map are the game, lerry and the laboratory. If you ask why I enjoy this map with Freddie, its because the lullabie is not directional and is really easy breaking line of sight and teleport midchase for sweet mindgames. Also the pools or the pallets work really well there. With the hag, Ive never lose a game on this maps. Ghostboi doesnt need explanation, and demogorgon is just too good and adaptable, he works everywhere.
---
It is a bug. I was blinded the entire game lol
---
Still managed to close the hatch though
---
Big F. Hope you have better games lol
---
I put gate’s instead of gates and that’s not okay
---
Your shading is so satisfying. Mine always looks grainy unless I really blend it, and then it just looks like a gray mess
---
But none of those killers camp. Even the newest or trappers i see dont waste there traps in front of the hook. Billy can get To the hook fast i guess, but it isnt camping considering there shouldnt be a problem with going To a location where 2 survivors are guarenteed To be, and hag can only get To the hook fast if you dont know how to play the game.
---
Amazing * - *
---
In Dead by daylight? No I've never, I suffer through because as long as the killer was in my ass my team would have time to do things and games are relatively quick anyway.
---
If he's gonna comfort him, he's gonna **comfort** him
---
&gt;Again those losses you cited are against skilled swf teams.  I promise you those losses aren't soloqueue or middling swf teams.  
---
If you think he only ever loses against stacked SWF, you're out of your mind. I can ask him personally if you want me to if he holds this belief or not. I doubt he thinks he only ever loses against SWF.
---
&gt;If you still feel this out of control of your killer games against soloqueue at this point in the games balance I promise you that's a personal problem.  Take a long hard look at how you're losing those games and look for the holes in your game because I promise you they're there.
---
I personally don't care about my rank, I just play whatever I want to and have fun and I still end up in red ranks every reset. I know I'm a competent Killer. I'm not saying that Killer isn't the power role because it's just my personal opinion. It is also the opinion of a whole slew of better Killer players than myself. Ask Scott, Zubat, or whoever else, who the power role is, and I guarantee you they won't say it's the Killer.
---
Good lol
---
I agree lmaoo
---
i didnt know you could see into the future my bad dog shit you gotta let me know ur a magician before the convo starts
---
Rwrrrrrrr
---
I believe Special Edition has all the killers up to Doctor right? (except Myers). People already recommended Ghostface, Myers and Freddy, so other than these 3 I enjoy playing Plague and Demogorgon too. But if you are gonna pick one I would suggest Ghostface.
---
Why would the devs want to do this? Not saying this is a bad idea but I can’t think of anyway this benefits the devs in doing it
---
Does that look like head to you?
---
On console at least you can find them based on username afterwards
---
so you have 3 survivors doing nothing and wasting time? it really sounds like you just dont know what you are doing
---
its all about relative skill, how strong the swf is vs the killer.
---
Exactly

She’s def-claud, she deserves it.

Yeah because preventing a hook is a huge waste of time

You’re acting like we can pick and choose what perks we want from there 💀😂 and jokes on you I’m 13 you pay to win baby killer🤡

It's an online game, asking people to not be dicks is like asking a bear to not shit in the woods.

It’s not like they intended for the event to be delayed, it’s really not that big of a deal

This is so satisfying

When I bring a mori and red addons into the match thinking it is a SWF about to start shit only to find out a minute into the game that they are not.

Yep, this is it

Have you never watched a Samination video?
---
Killer mains: "Survivors are so toxic why do they always teabag and make me feel bad"
---
Also Killer mains: "oopsie was I too mean? UwU"
---
This sub has literally been dragging the devs down these last few days. They fucked up, yet again, I get that. I’m as disappointed and pissed as the next one, especially since most of my games result in my rank and bp not being added into my account because of an « unknown error » that will be « tentatively fixed » in the mid chapter. But this witch trial wasn’t needed. No need to attack them.
---
No this logic doesn’t lead to “survivors have to teabag and harass killers.”  It also doesn’t mean survivors should run meta perks all the time.  It means survivors shouldn’t feel entitled to mercy when the killer is straight up supposed to kill you.
---
Jokes on you I play immersed without any immersion perks
---
Thats my boy
---
When its only 1 survivor trying To prevent a hook then i agree they are wasting there time, but when its all 3 there isnt anything i can do and all those seconds i spent chasing basically never happened. If you want some confirmation that swfs are a bit too strong, then watch this video. https://youtu.be/q5uUUAz7m1U Yeah the killer won, but thats only because they had a build made to counter these guys specific strategy.
---
Awww thank you so so much!!!!
---
This also happened to me last night!
---
Use urban evasion
---
It's only a matter of time before there's a dbd mod for the NSFW fans
---
people can't voice their opinion when something happens?
---
Lol
---
Yes srry was a lil drunk
---
This is really endearing for some reason
---
Glad you liked it, I thought it was rather funny in my head so I stuck with it. I was thinking of giving a larger number of the perks special tidbits regarding existing survivors or benedict.
---
In hindsight, I should have made survivor perks based on existing survivors to take them up from 3 teachables to 4 teachables.
---
I wish it depended on me dude..i play solo
---
Block line of sight, don't let him stalk you, loop him until he cries in a corner. People call him easy because he is. He has no map traversal, no real map pressure, and he has to charge up his instant down ability by stalking potatoes. If you really need it, run spine chill. It will give you advanced warning against him since any decent shape is going to stalk you from behind.
---
Consoles don’t have dedicated servers yet unless it’s the switch
---
It’s not like I DC every single match, but apparently I’m being treated like I do lol. At least there is someone who understands what it’s like, or at least must get tunneled as much as I do.
---
Now the exception to this should be that glitch that they’ve since fixed I believe where it wouldn’t let you escape. On that one one time, the killer was standing there and clearly saw the glitch. So I came back out and he killed and hooked me.

Actually pretty well made, nice work my dude
---
They can, but there is a difference between being disappointed and voicing your opinion or being a toxic a-hole. This is not the first nor the last small(ish) dev team that has these issues, calling them incompetent and "the worst" is uncalled for.
---
Getting a 4k isn't that hard though. It just requires being an asshole and hoping you're going against an altruistic team. Don't get me wrong, survivor adept is that braindead, but I'd also argue theirs is the one that is in bigger need of a change.
---
And others survivors are salty bc he did nothing during the game and gets hatch Kappa
---
well it should, it makes sense in the context of what Iridescent emblems are suppose to represent. In that you more than won and went beyond that with exceptional performance.
---
I shoulda specified when they are wounded specifically.
---
Missing out on a farm that only happens if hed dc? Makes sense lol
---
I like Kaid just because he reminds me of Bill. Favorite's still Maestro because of the glorious zapcams for trolling the enemy squad. No frags? You get your ass zapped every time you turn around. That, or I zap their breach charges.
---
Vibe check FAILED
---
This is great!! I love it!
---
Yeah getting a 4k isn't too difficult. That's why I wish it changes back to that requirement. Since atm getting a killer adept requires a double pip
---
Yeah only stay in those ggez 4k games
---
Yup. It’s completely pointless and a waste of your time that you could be getting into another lobby that doesn’t have a cheap cunt looking for cheap, easy points/kills. When I’m playing killer I’d rather get gen rushed, hit with flashlights and endlessly looped with a 2k score than to tunnel people. It’s pathetic.
---
LOL
---
I would just consider making the regular chili part of his base kit
---
actually those aren't all that overused imo.
---
it's just they're often fitting but I don't find them overused
---
If the killer deliberately re-hooks the first person they hooked, there is a very high chance that person will DC, taking any teammates with them. Especially if they do it again after that. 
---
If the killer doesn't get a hit by the time 4 gens are done, they will 99% DC. 
---
I don't argue with it. It really sucks when games are 1-sided, or someone is super unlucky.
---
Could you make wraith next? This is great btw
---
Lockers? Lmao
---
its funny bc at one point that’s literally how survivors reacted to old legion lol
---
Lol this build weak af u ain’t getting a 4K my guy u getting an 0k
---
You're not toxic...
---
You're just trash
---
Listen my excuse is that I got jumpscared, I always leave if it's a hag, not because "hag OP plz nerf" it's because I'm a baby with jumpscares.
---
If a hook is too far away, them dropping them is just a free escape, and there isn't always a way to know if body blocks are gonna happen. I do find it interesting though that if survivors are good enough they just win every time without fail unless the killer knows there strategy, has a counter and can play really well. Like, I understand if a killer plays really well then they will win most of the time, but your logic that "oh if killer lose to swf they bad" is just proven wrong by that video I showed earlier. Both sides have bullshit stuff they have to deal with, both sides can potentially be easy to deal with or hard to deal with with certain perks/killers. The logic that a killer is objectively bad if they can't win against swf lots of the time is asinine. That's the point I'm getting across here. I'm not saying survivors get it easy.
---
So what about survivors who... survive... i got camped for running the killer for 5 minutes, is that my fault? No. So now i flashlight click and teabag at every chance i get... cuz then at least i know i deserve it.
---
You beat me to this :(
---
this reminds me of the spy crab from tf2
---
Hold rb then hit lb
---
By default its RB
---
this is the ture power of dedicated servers desync
---
Maybe you can help me here. I understood it as, "Do not reward the community because they have no patience and only complain."
---
If PC matchmaking takes an age, I can’t even imagine console. F
---
It’s half the reason why I main killer lmao
---
I can take about 2 moms at once while waiting for survivors.
---
Am I missing something? Looks like a normal unhook?
---
BHVR:  \*Removes Trapper's grace period.\*
---
Please look up the oxford comma. This sentence made my eyes bleed.
---
I think it should be optional to allow SWF to run against or not.  
---
I shouldn't have to always take on the most toxic shxts imaginable once breaking through to 10 and up.
---
* PC
---
* In game
---
* Clown's solvent jug addon causes exhaustion not just to survivors hit by his power, but can induce exhaustion to anyone on the map
---
* this definitely happens on Groaning Storehouse, but it might happen on other maps. I don't know how much charge is required from the clown, but it doesn't happen every time
---
* only survivors hit by afterpiece tonic get the exhaustion status
---
* survivors across the map get exhaustion status
---
* Not 100%, but that might have to do with the clown's wind up time, not because it doesn't work every time
---
Ur build made my eyes bleed
---
He pulled off the 4% escape and got cucked by David right in the middle of it.
---
So remove it, no one would choose to go against swf so that would basically be removing it
---
Is your house a haunted house?
---
Assuming it's lockers everytime would be stupid. It's honestly better to be safe and do a quick few rounds if you don't see anyone, before gen patrolling.
---
Only on weekends
---
Being this naive.
---
God forbid he use the perk “fixation”
---
*smiles in baby meg*
---
Doot
---
The killer is also not allowed to use any perk that gives them any sort of advantage.
---
honestly i don't think we've been patient or understanding
---
Your logic of using one of the best swfs in the game to prove that swf is broken doesnt make sense bud. Its not like they all escaped every game before, they played him 6+ times before hand and a few of them died quite a few times.
---
Most swfs are playing with there rank 15 stranger things fan with 4 hours in the game, or just not trying much. Im 100% sure you have never ran into a swf like that, and if you have it was once. 
---
Body blocking is a strat that people complained about in 2017. Hit the survivors then chase if you cant drop, You are not loosing much time if you know what you are doing.
---
Lmao wtf
---
*cries in corner self caring with sloppy claudette randoms while I'm running the killer around*
---
I moved from console to PC thinking with all the streamers, there must be a heavier community. Nope, still 10 minutes a queue time.
---
I've had someone with distortion complain about BBQ. I'm sorry but that's goofy.
---
As Hag main, I definitely smash more often than not.
---
Not a single person has been "patient" or "understanding", especially not you since you're demanding free stuff. Oh, and that's a fact &lt;3
---
Nah, leave it there for those chads who want the challenge.  
---
For those who don't want endless hook diving, t-bagging, and general 15 minutes of pain, it should be optional.  
---
Also, that sentiment shows there is a DEF problem with SWF. If it wasn't aids, more people would want to run against it.
---
People sitting in gates aren't being toxic if they don't t-bag. People who do that usually are waiting to make sure the others can make it out by taking a hit or something like that.
---
I don't think he needs a rework.
---
Reducing the default charge time would be enough to make him good.
---
He still wouldn't have map pressure but he'd be able to get downs faster thus creating pressure that way.
---
For reference, play him with two charge reduction addons and even on maps with lots of windows he can get downs easily.
---
Removing his slowdown while charging might also work, you'd basically play like clown, with your chainsaw up until time is right.
---
Heck, even increasing acceleration and reach by a bit might be enough to make him viable.
---
I love Black Phillip huntress
---
No people don’t want to go agains swf because they want an easy win
---
yep! dbd blows.
---
Iv heard of him in passing but r there any movies or licenses involved with him or is it all just random stories here and there?
---
"they fucked up" those are big words coming from a person who continues to play this game to this day, despite how much you complain. Actually, I see a lot of people complaining, but they still play it. Put your money where your mouth is and stop playing if you're gonna complain this much.
---
Or, you know, seeing how many people still play kinda tells me that you are all overreacting over how much "they fucked up". I side with the latter more, if you ask me.
---
kill them? theres a difference between letting them win and playing fair by not tunneling people or being a lameo
---
Well it is my picture so it’s only fair 😂
---
I literally finished my sentence saying that I don't think swf are broken, it just depends on the circumstance. A swf vs a wraith, clown or any low tier killer is highly survivor based, a swf against a spirit/nurse or any high tier killer is based purely on skill for both sides. The logic that a killer is bad is they lose to a swf frequently is what I'm trying to prove wrong here. Neither sides are op.
---
I'm talking about when everyone or the rest of the survivors already there.
---
I have in no way been understanding but i’ll take it anyway
---
This is fine, I totally agree with you. I just think camping is the #1 no no, if a survivor dies they just don't get to play anymore is my reasoning.
---
Sure, if you have good gamesense/mindgaming and good perks and addons you'll have more people on the hook with any killer. Is there a reason you prefer Leatherface over Hillbilly, or any other killer?
---
I see wounded healer I upvote
---
it's the dev's job but they blow at it
---
In those cases they might be trying to let the killer get a hit for the bp, which are usually unaware that most killers don't care.
---
This, and to get some cheap &amp; easy extra Chase points before you leave the match.
---
I used to be killer-only and I thought it was toxic when the survivors would stay at the exit gates I make me chase them out, but they're actually just trying to get a little bit more chase points. Unless they teabag you, then they're just toxic fucks.
---
That’s a dweet
---
I DC at tunnel moris. I take that chance to make you waste your ivory.
---
Yeah me too 😂
---
sooo fucking yes... im a main solo surv, and i get soooo many boosted killers crying 'cause "OH MAI GOOD OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA ESCAPE WITH 4 TEAM SWF" when in the team we have an argentinian, a chilean, and two brazilians...
---
Oh then we agree that neither are op under most circumstances
---
The way he works does not fit in DbD. Survivors play in 3rd person. How do you want to make the staring thing work. And how would he injure you? He does not slash at his targets.
---
In the Rob Zombie version, he basically has the same Mommy issues haha
---
That excuse is laughable.
---
Like "hey, I know I won, but here's a few blood points that dont make a difference"
---
Fire up might not be a meta perk, but it is quite decent
---
Happy Deathday !
---
Love the concept and like 2 of 3 perks but puppet show would be completely broken on a few of the killers (Bubba).  The power is very interesting on the light marionette I think hinder would be a bit more appropriate there rather then hemorrhage or would also be cool if they made it were the camera turn is inverted for X amount of time so if you try to turn it left it goes right could be 360 and loops harder.
---
Otherwise I like it Good job!
---
9/10 its lockers, trust me as a survivor main
---
He is so fast though
---
The funniest part is, guy with Endurance could easily protect the unhooker but since most people don't have a brain, poor rescuer dies. 
---
Saved person often is useless just like Bran at that episode.
---
Joe doesn’t care about your feelings
---
*injured baby dwight in a locker thinking the killer won’t hear him*
---
One day.. I’ll be a man
---
*continues to disconnects*
---
I ended up watching a few episodes last night and every episode has me laughing. RIP Puppet Ash
---
Hey, as long as they aren't t-bagging in that scenario, I don't think they are meaning any ill-will.
---
Because I love Leatherface. I have a Neca action figure of him sitting on my desk, I love all of his movies (even the re-boots) His screeches when he’s using his chainsaw is hilarious and as the original comment states, he’s basically a meme. And I love delivering leatherface memes lol
---
True, but he didnt just use freddy for anything. He choose Freddy to counter OoO. Most OoO play worse then them. Proving that Freddy is indeed strong.
---
Too bad all that cosmetic money didn't buy competent devs.
---
One time, i got hooked at the end and the other 3 were at the exit gate healing. They all came back to save me, one by one they body blocked for me taking hits going down. Only i made it out.  
---
I wanted to cry.
---
I like how lauries just in the end
---
Ok i think i see the problem. You think you loose bloodlust when you hit some one cause you loose the chase? You loose bloodlust from loosing a chase yes, but also from hiting a survivor or breaking a pallet. So pride will not alow you to hit someone and still keep bloodlust from loosing the chase after the hit cause you have no bloodlust to keep cause you lost it when you hit the survivor.
---
What’s ligma?
---
Nea's DC is justified though. 5 gens, 2 DCs... Really no point in staying.
---
Who’s imagine dragons?
---
When a survivor DC's, most of the time, they would have been hooked, it only makes sense that it at least counts as 1 hook. It's completely counter productive that every time a survivor DC's, your emblems get limited. Who wants the experienced killers staying in low ranks?
---
Ben Trappiro.
---
He could possess survivors, taking control of them, after stalking them for a certain duration. This would enable him to use a survivor to hook other survivors. There'd be around a 60 second timer to do so before losing control. His ability would be similar to Mike Myers, except he wouldn't need to slash his prey. A possessed survivor would grab another player and carry them to a hook.
---
*****Ghostface!*****
---
**Gets revealed through a wall**
---
That’s his weapon
---
There is a movie released in 2018 (or 2017 im not sure) It's shit tho
---
What in the fuck?
---
I dont understand why Doctor is getting the next rework. Yes he isnt that viable but there should be many more priorities
---
1. Leatherface just sucks
---
2. They need to figure out wtf Legion is supposed to do
---
3. Trapper has needed a QOL change for so long, his power is currently outdated against good survivors (Trapper main Btw)
---
4. Clown is in a desperate need of a buff.
---
5. Honestly if they made shocking more reliable for blocking windows and/or got rid of 110 movement for holding shock Doctor would be significantly better
---
Yeah.
---
This is so cute! Love Love Love.
---
It. Is. Not. His. Accent. Genius.
---
He is literally just saying it wrong and making up words, because he's probably braindamaged from playing this game for 10k hours.
---
&gt;(Not that theirs anything wrong with that)
---
Learn English, ESL.
---
thanks
---
So basically. I get this werid feeling IRL when I feel someone is about to be unhooked, and most of the time its right, so I start heading to the hook, and I get accused of camping because I come back at just the right time to find them getting unhooked
---
This makes me feel bad about using lockers because now the killer might proxy if they think I’m near
---
I may be the odd man out but I believe we need a system where a d/c  character cannot leave the game. Despite the player being absent, the character stays, inert, and the player is out of luck until he/she is killed or game ends.  Survivor or killer.
---
You sound angry. And apparently you haven't a clue about the lore of the Slender Man. He possesses his prey, and drives them mad. The idea of stalking is homage to the OG games.
---
That's fine.  I'd prefer a temporary ban.  But  I like my rules because they also help in situations of unintentional disconnects.  Unlike Overwatch, it is possible to rebalance Dead by Daylight on the fly.  And punishing a d/cing Survivor doesn't help the killer who loses a pip because of it.
---
*me who just got all of Dwights perks teachable*
---
Ight imma head out
---
Thrilling tremors tells you whether a survivor is working on a gen or not, I'm all ears let's you mind game more efficently, the only perk I feel he has no value from is furtive but furtive is so much more fun and useful on say myers
---
Poor dwight :(
---
Granted, I'm only green ranks, but it rarely happens to where I don't see *any* auras with BBQ. And I still only make one or two loops 30 meters out from the hook before just going back to gen patrol. I don't just say "no auras? Lemme pitch a tent then."
---
I play survivor aswell. Besides, I don't really believe that 9/10 spiel, since usually if I don't see someone's aura, and I leave hook, that person gets saved 5 seconds after I leave. 
---
So either everyone you play with are locker junkies, or everyone i get put up against are extremely altruistic.
---
Yes that specific case is pretty toxic, but I’d only do that to campers, noed users etc. (・ω・｀) maybe look at what you’ve been running
---
i always felt incredible annoyed by that shit .. "yes, you kicked my ass - great job and now to further humiliate me you will keep me hostage in this game until i come to you to collect my spit to the face or win the patience battle" and survivors waiting at the gates can be incredible patient - obviously not anymore now the endgame collapse is around but before that in some cases i went afk for 20 minutes to come back to a still running game.
---
U right!!!!!
---
it doesn't exactly, only if the person DCs before getting hooked. Besides if a DC happens that early, chances are the match is too lopsided anyway, and you shouldn't just be given free 2 pips for it.
---
Getting hooked is a small price...
---
I had someone DC because I was using franklins
---
The only time I ever DC is when someone spawns on my totem. It's such bullshit
---
Especially if the killer won’t have mercy and just farm, like lol you’re gonna get bullshit for BP by sweating against the 2 of us, so what’s the point in the Nea wasting time, she’s gonna depip anyway
---
My comment had nothing to do with killers not being salty, I'm sure there are that feel robbed of a Mori or sacrifice animation, however my point is that DCing screws your team mates over.
---
I do get annoyed as killer if a survivor DC's early because then I feel bad because 3 survivors won't get 5 gens done, and either I know they'll have an unfun game or I'll let them farm and won't get a "killer vs survivor" match I wanted. If someone DC's before Mori or final hook tho or they're the last one alive, that's not a problem for me, just makes it so I can continue faster.
---
I'm trying to think of something completely unique. The Slender Man is such an iconic monster, that I think his gameplay has limitless potential.
---
How did u do that on xbox!?!?!
---
It is in the low ranks... but i get what you’re saying. Are you really trying to get adept in red rank though? If so that’s a mistake. Even in green ranks getting a double pip with terrible perks that don’t work well together is entirely up to chance. The scoring system is even biased against non m1 killers who can use their powers to win chases. It’s a little scummy but i feel the only way to guarantee adept is deranking to at least 13.
---
They're never gonna patch it. 
---
Just like how sometimes there will be someone in your match that no one is able to heal.
---
A lot of mixed info in here and it’s because it depends on your controller mapping. All you need to do is use the medkit and then hit the skill check button before a skill check comes up.
---
Do you put up the tree for Halloween and then just redecorate it for Christmas? Because I love that idea and I'm going to force my boyfriend to start doing it.
---
When u are rank 16 with rank reset and get rank 10 survivor with rank reset smh
---
We need more Ace love on this sub, best survivor.
---
&gt; Having said that, of the perks you mention only Ruin and Sloppy are actually worth running imo.
---
It's not about the individual numbers on Thana or Dying Light being small, it's about stacking all of them for one cumulative, miserable experience. Thana is great on killers like Legion, Plague, and Freddy because the first two have an easy time keeping everyone injured all the time, and Freddy has addons that slow things down even more to combo. Play with something like Ruin, to slow the early game down, Pop to use after some gen progress is done, and dying light to make the popped gens + remaining gens take increasing amounts of time to complete. Freddy even makes great use of Pop because he can teleport to a nearly completed gen and use it immediately.
---
&gt; PGTW can be really good if youre lucky, but would be much more viable if they put it on a token system
---
God, please no. It's already miserable enough. You give it a token system and you can just pop a gen, wait for someone to touch it, and immediately pop it again. And if they don't touch it, it regresses either way. As it stands, each hook can give you up to 1/4th of a gen back, meaning if you hook each survivor twice without killing anyone you've potentially added in an extra two generators to your game. It's massive slowdown. And yes, there are times where it won't live up to that potential, but the fact that it CAN do that with zero counterplay is ridiculous.
---
&gt; Likewise telling people to play Freddy so they can use his game-slowing add ons isnt a counter point to the current problem of gens getting done to fast. Just because one killer in their whole roster has a tool to help doesnt mean every one wants to play that one character just to have a good game.

You're missing the point I was trying to make. That style of Freddy is *absolutely miserable* for the survivors, to the point where people are starting to DC from it. It's been dubbed "Forever Freddy" and nobody likes it. It absolutely should not exist. And sorry, if a person needs to play Forever Freddy to get kills, they're just not very good at killer. I was definitely not telling people they should play him to deal with "genrushing."
---
&gt; I dont think having 'better maps' will help close the gap between good and bad killers.
---
It definitely will. All the good killers have mechanics that either help them with map pressure or allow them to ignore game mechanics. For example, a Nurse doesn't care about your reworked maps and your unsafe pallets. She can destroy you just as well as she could when the map had a bunch of safe pallets. But someone like the Wraith or Trapper or Michael (any m1 killer that has to deal with loops) will benefit a lot from the reworked maps and unsafe pallets. Good killers will still be good, average killers will be a bit better and hopefully more viable. Those average killers will never be Nurse level, like I said, but anything to help their viability will hopefully introduce more killer variety.
---
I want this
---
I don't know what I didn't think it was common.
---
Thrilling tremors ain’t the worst but furtive chase is garbo
---
i feel you bro
---
My opinion:
---
Courageous fool:
---
The 25% healing speed for each survivour is good and it doesn't need a built-in borrowed time.
---
Gut instinct: wayy too op. Personally I would allow  you to read the aura of the killer for 5-8 seconds if they are in a 25 meter range of you after they hook a survivor. 45 maximum seconds to trigger after an unhook (like DS). Also has a cooldown of 80 seconds.
---
Practice makes perfect: reminds me of virgil. Plus DS having a activation window of 80+ seconds would be infuriating for the killer. I would make it a progression perk like autodidact. Start the match with a 20% slower vault speed, landing recovery and longer scratch mark duration. By performing a fast vault, dropping from a height or escaping the killer, gain a 5% faster speeds in vault speed, landing recovery and scratch mark duration. Up to a maximum of 35%. The increase of stats can only be activated every 30 seconds.
---
You seem very inthusiastic about dbd concepts and I would like to see more of them in the future.
---
This concept was cool and I hope I help you by giving critizim/changes.
---
The patch was planned for last Tuesday, but got delayed due to them not being able to fix the game-breaking bugs and crashes in time for that.
---
Yeah, I'm in green ranks now and it's very hard already, not worth trying in red ranks. I dislike the current pipping system in general, and having the adept linked to it doesn't exactly make me fonder of the system. I hate how pipping artificially gets more difficult.
---
A good ranking system is one where ranking up gets harder because the enemies you face are more experienced, not because the game artificially makes the ranking requirements harder.
---
If a trapper places it on hook and you still manage to step into the trap you deserve to go back on hook and think about your decisions.
---
More frequent high walls and impediments to long-range visibility would be a good start lol.
---
No, I don’t think underground complex is a good model for maps. As you said, its numerous pallets are very unsafe. Plus some of its tiles are just plain stupid. 
---
In case you missed my point above, I’ll reiterate. Many loops can be run by a brain dead survivor and waste loads of a killer’s time. This is unfair.
---
And *we* don’t do squat. We bitch and argue on the internet and hope the powers that be make changes not biased towards one role over the other but in toward fairness.
---
Southeast gang rise up
---
Pizzawhat!
---
Awesome!  He's my favorite too!
---
1/4 hatchets that gets an iradesent medal
---
That head on 💜
---
Body blocking SWF's. Definitely my biggest pet peeve when I'm trying to hook one of them and the other three swarm the hook.
---
So you're just going to facecamp off the assumption that everyone is toxic.
---
I have two reasons that I'll disconnect. If it doesn't fulfill them then I stay no matter what. 
---
1. A huntress using IH who gets a hatch hit on me from clear across the map when I can't even hear her humming. IH is fine but fuck that shit. 
---
2. If two other survivors have already disconnected. We will likely lose anyway so I may as well give the last guy the chance of finding hatch immediately.
---
Dying Light is pretty overrated. I would only use it in an anti healing build combined with sloppy
---
Umm i dont think you can comment pics.
---
Idk though im on mobile
---
? Ok ? Hope you’re enjoying your god awful dedicated servers on your PC
---
very very entitled headon player in south east
---
What kind of shitty and unnecessay gatekeeping is this?
---
Hhmmm, dammit, i'm new on reddit, not posting that much, so i didn't know that 😅
---
You look great, mate.
---
Punish? Thats a reward
---
Use right trigger and begin healing and then hit left bumper.
---
I only just want to see how cosmetics looks combined. Euqipping multiple cosmetics you dont own in a shop to see how a combo looks. But no, can only view at once so if i buy shit thats just yikes
---
You should cosplay the maid from family guy and get into character to clean that room.
---
It shouldnt
---
If I feel like it yeah I’ll camp, also guaranteed facecamp for: Bringing a key, instahealing, if the chase lasts more then 2 gens, teabagging or pointing at me mid chase. It’s much easier as Bubba and is a fitting punishment
---
well tell the devs that—
---
Don’t forget the fact that DS itself got buffed too - A)it’s now much easier to hit and at all tiers, and B) the prompt happens immediately so it’s basically impossible to get hooked before u can DS
---
I don’t make friends I make bullies :(
---
This is a terrible meme. The DBD community on console is huge since it's been on the Xbox game pass for months. PCs are super expensive and a lot of people prefer playing on a controller. There's not many games I would choose to play on a mouse and keyboard.
---
Happy cake day
---
The more ridiculous part of totems is when they spawn right next to the survivors or right next to generators. They are already fairly easy to find on most maps, but most of the time ruin spawns in either of these two locations making it impossible to keep up. I've had too many games where I cant even make it to my ruin at the start of the game before a survivor has already destroyed it. Regardless of the power of totems, their spawns are flawed.
---
Swan song sounds amazing, the plays you could make with it are endless, but I thought it would be cool if you got endurance when you take a protection hit for someone while active
---
Idk though maybe u can on pc
---
Dies -&gt; pikachu face -&gt; camper/tunneler/bad killer/ fk you/ reported/all of the above.

Yesterday (25th @5pm EST) I got the clip shortly before I had to be at work but it wouldn't upload so I could get the screenshot until I got home around 11pm EST last night
---
How could you?? ;-;
---
Hahaha more than likely
---
You all disgust me...play on mobile like a true pro gamer.
---
Your original comment just said that you wish the perk didn't have the cooldown it currently has on it. You did not say it should still have a cooldown, just a different. Hence why the other commenter inferred that you were saying you wanted head-on to have no cool down. Communication is a two way street. You cannot assume people know what you mean.
---
Thank you!
---
Removed let’s not start a console war on this sub thank you
---
Lmao don’t worry, you won’t get muted for it
---
Can't tell if they are joking or not. They did block me afterwards.
---
It’s actually still in early access, finite difference that that is. They still have time and room to polish the game up before it “officially” releases.
---
Earlier today. Survivor I'm watching is looping Meyers. Gets hit once and quits..... yeah it was in the first 30 seconds but you're just the worst kind of person

FTFY. Also obligatory fuck 2D.
---
dont worry about other peoples fun. play for yourself. try to avoid stuff like dcing and camping, but if you have to then dont think twice about it. do what you wanna do, man
---
They want extra chase points. They get chase points when you shoo them out of the exit gate, whether you hit them or not. Then when the animation starts as they're exiting the match, they also get bonus "escaped killer" chase points, as if they lost you during a match.
---
I couldn’t agree more. That is their only excuse too. I might DC from a game once out of every month, yet everyone in this thread acts like I do it every single game. I doubt they’ve ever played against me or know me, I’m a rank 3, it’s not just about a bad killer’s enjoyment. If I’m on death hook and I know I’m only going to get 8,000 points because of the Boldness category, I’m not going to stay at all because I want to find another game, it’s that simple. I’m getting more hate than a scummy killer? That’s fucked up
---
&gt; It amazes me how mad survivors get when you make sure to kill them. If you want to point farm with no risk then why are you playing dead by daylight?
---
Counterpoint: If I'm matched with 3 randoms and two of them disconnect before we finish a single generator, don't expect me to solo win the game while you tryhard like your life depends on it.
---
Nerd
---
You sure he possesses or is this just from the shitty 2018 movie? If it’s from 2018 movie there’s no reason to count it unless you go back in the post itself you made and say the 2018 version.
---
If you mean the original slendy then all he does is ruin cameras and end you in a way unknown to us. He never possesses people.
---
r/SuddenlyIncest
---
Dang dude chill out.
---
Unpopular opinion, the legion “rework” was an incredibly poorly handled change that, while removing the problem of moonwalking, felt more like a big nerf so BHVR could put legion aside and not have to think about them 
---
Their power is a first hit tool, and after that they become a generic M1 killer, and deep wounds are an absolute joke now due to the bandaid fix to stop moonwalking exploits
---
sorry
---
generally i think you're right, but this time around was the straw that broke the camel's back
---
People tend to DC when I use ~~iridescent~~ cheater hatchets with Huntress.
---
Had someone I gave the hatch in Hawkin's the other day because they actually stuck it out tho. Also feel like I'm always tunneling on that damn map because I get lost.
---
Was going to make a confusing one where it was an Xbox but the skeleton was holding a game cube controller
---
How? Tell me how without saying something he has never done
---
He never possesses people. Only stalked them and killed them after in a way unknown to us.
---
“But the hoodie person who runs at you in that one other slender game!”
---
Did it specifically say they were possessed? Don’t think so.
---
“Outstanding move” ... for a dumpster fire. 🙄
---
Drives me to town and back when people do this nonsense.
---
Thank you
---
Baby Ash
---
Yes people! The exact same happened to me literally two days ago! 🙄
---
For using perks and addons the developers want you to use?
---
Everyone was about rank 13 or higher
---
Any killer. Some have way easier lives than others but ultimately, every killer is viable because there are a lot of below average survivors at every rank.
---
Nothing from a one hit game, people keep suggesting slender, outlast. Characters from these where its just not unique enough or anything special
---
That’s not an unpopular opinion
---
The year 3 comeback, solid lad
---
nah for being toxic m8
---
As an 18 year old I gotta say...
---
**take a look at my fucking comment history and then see if OP ain’t acting their age compared to me. He’s practically normal and thus ok!**
---
Dude, stop pressing that narrative. Horror Inc told them they wouldn’t approve any new content release and they as much as admitted it. That’s not “an excuse.” That’s how licenses work.
---
Pretty much all of them if you’re good at using them. But the better ones for higher ranks tend to be Spirit, Nurse, and Billy.
---
Probably just a lot of bad players on this subreddit. lol. Most killers don’t do that so it’s probably mostly just bad players in this sub looking for tips. lol.
---
sounds like you like to tunnel. Lol :D
---
That’s so unbalanced
---
Those are top 3
---
Lmao when matchmaking takes so long that your system updates without you
---
You feel cheated.. too bad. Now you understand 1% of what killers feel every time people DC. And survivors do it way more often
---
Welcome to the club, finally
---
I'm not mad that I lose out on the BP, I'm more pissed at the fact that the game is just a lot less fun for everyone else. I'm a killer main and I typically give the last person door/hatch because I feel bad that the one guy decided to ruin the experience for everyone else.
---
Pretty sure we were Freddy's Bitches
---
Wow,  how unlucky hatch was so close to the exit gate.   That made it easier for the Demogorgon.
---
They did stop making new ones though
---
Technically any killer is “viable” at high ranks but let’s be honest, a good spirit is going to win way more games than a good pig.
---
The killers that perform best at high ranks are Spirit, Billy, Nurse, and Freddy in my opinion.
---
This is the first time I’ve seen this and yes PS4
---
Yeah you got a 3k
---
Then don't buy it, boom, it doesn't effect you. Oh wait sorry it does, you now get free cosmetics and extra blood points regularly just for playing.
---
Woah bud, who hurt you? Lol.  I play killer a ton too, but when survivors DC I still get some quitter points.  I'd be upset if everytime a survivor quit the game ended and I got no points as a killer.
---
It's like a 2 week event, not sure where you are getting that. Also most games launch events along with updates
---
We haven't been understanding or patient.. but for obvious reasons
---
This year was a total mess. Event cancelled to work on dedicated servers, been unable to communicate decently and delaying the Halloween event informing us 20h before it's launch while they preventively put on sales the skins weeks before it
---
Almost like they expected the delay, but I can't be sure of that. Still kinda weird when they never did that beforehand but made it purchasable DURING the event not weeks prior..
---
They deserve all the shit they are getting for not hiring better coders and people who can grant better stability than those apes they pay
---
Same i rage moment to moments but i never have dc.
---
Sadly, I’m afraid we’ll be waiting awhile. 
---
I had hope for Project Resistance but from what I’ve seen I don’t think that game is going to be for everyone. That’s on top of a lot of the RE fan base being salty that they aren’t getting a new Outbreak. 
---
Secret Neighbor just released and on top of being a bit sparse on features (only one map) the matchmaking appears to be borked on XBone. It free though (well, free with Game Pass) so hopefully it will have legs. 
---
The studio that runs Deceit filed for bankruptcy a few months ago so it’s likely already toast. 
---
Hide or Die lost a lot of momentum after it’s rough early access launch. It might reclaim it, though. But either way the cellphone texting mechanic will keep it a PC exclusive and limit its audience. Or me, at least, due to my bad back. 
---
I actually have heard good first impressions about Predator. Unfortunately, it’s a PS4 exclusive so I’ll likely never get a chance to play it. 
---
I had hopes that Gun would try to make a spiritual sequel to F13. Something either unlicensed or partially licensed (like DBD) that had a bit more meat its bones and was designed to last. Then I found out that part of their deal with Horror Inc included a no-compete clause preventing them from a similar game. So that’s not going to happen anytime soon.
---
Nice,  you stood there like a brick wall!
---
Ace mains rise up
---
It'll be a hot mess anyways. It WILL break things. This always happens. Matchmaking is still a hot mess from the last update that was meant to fix matchmaking. Hence - if BHVR is going to keep breaking shit regardless, release the stuff, BREAK WHATEVER, hot fix it later. 
---
Delaying something that's just going to wreck some part of the game anyways seems kind of self-defeating and pointless.
---
Yeah, shut up nerd
---
I see you whiteout in 2019
---
What about Hide or Die?
---
If a survivor DC’s it should just count as the full 3 hooks and also give you a boost to the Chaser Emblem too.
---
Could be a region thing too,I'm rank 5 atm as killer and I get into a full lobby in a minute tops,eastern EU,meanwhile as purple rank survivor I have to wait about 2-3 mins avg.
---
Mmm, no, what they did was delay the patch and event at the last minute, give no clear reason, then decided at the end of the week "Well, here's why" and gave answers that SHOULD have been given on Monday, when they delayed it. 
---
Does that seem like respect to you? Being upfront and transparent is kind of expected these days. Unless you're fine with BHVR becoming EA or something.
---
Its cause some killers take them to the hatch. Some m9ght just have given up though I guess
---
Very likely, they just didn't think of it or didn't care to think of it until the last possible second.
---
Oh I see. Makes more sense now
---
Kind of like how you're acting like a child because they won't release it on PC?
---
Halloween this year for DbD comes in November (prob)
---
bruh you need the nsfw tag
---
It's more satisfying that a survivor was so bothered that they were losing that they wasted their time for zero points just cause they were a baby. You also get only 50 less points when someone dcs last hook so keep going for those 0 points baby
---
The most frequent posters are actually the people who spam the sub with a million shitty memes, but point taken.
---
Yeah I agree. This was accumulated and didn't just happen overnight. I think people were just giving BHVR a break because usually they do fix stuff, but it happens overtime and not in a single patch. But I think people are starting to get frustrated when quality of life improvements keeps getting delayed because of new chapters, lore content and new cosmetics.
---
great meme
---
Nerves of steel lol. I thought he had me to be honest.
---
Well hey, you can't say no to lots of free bloodpoints
---
Literatly earier me and 2 other ppl in swf were playing and literatly 3 times in a row a killer dcd when they realized they were losing. Kinda retarted that when a survivor leaves, which *doesnt* dc everyone else, the killer gets bonus bloodpoints. However when a killer leaves the survivors dont get shit and lose their items/ad ons
---
Again, I don't lose that many points and I get them back if I get a 4k, which is easier since you pretty much screw over your team if you DC.
---
We definitely know they’re giving us the Withered Blight. It’s intertwined with the Archive and Rift release and we know for damn sure they want that revenue so the event is gonna be here, albeit late. Is the two could be separated, we wouldn’t be waiting on the patch to drop it in. 
---
Also even if they couldn’t fully recognize the difference between intentional and accidental DC, they can still have people get incremental time locks or fix the report system for people who DC intentionally.
---
Yeah, in the game you have to stay still when it's around so that it can't spot you, also, forgot to mention that the wendigo should be really fast, I'm talking faster than trapper by a decent amount, because it'd be kinda unfair to finally find somebody who'd been standing still just to lose them in a chase
---
If I get tunneled off hook even though I had BT and the killer downs me and doesn’t even play around the possibility of DS there is a high chance I will DC. At that point there’s no fun, to be had, I’ll just be proxy camped out
---
"New killer eyeless child announced"
---
I don’t really give a shit about my team. I just use them to rank myself up. That’s it.
---
Finally a secondary objective for survivors
---
First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience!
---
Ayyy
---
His power: *screams*
---
Not wearing neon hair and crouching on a hill, 4/10
---
I don't know about most killers, but the "5 thumbed moron" is usually the one I give hatch to. I can't bring myself to kill a baby, they're too cute.
---
[Ah, i see you're a man of culture as well](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/236/841/075.jpg)
---
I'll check it out
---
Eh, I only facecamp when the people have been utterly toxic. Otherwise, I hook and go.
---
bruh im just tryna play jeff
---
Nicely done!
---
Poor baby ash was scared of the saw
---
Haha, u look so happy! That‘s kinda cute! Looks great! :)
---
Claudette looks like she has the biggest shit of her life.
---
Entitty I´m trying to stalk survivors, but I´m dummy thicc and the clap of my ass cheeks and tiddies is alerting them
---
Freddy is very good, probably A tier / top 5 in the game for killers imo.
---
hahahaha wth!?
---
I mean, with how close the killer is, he was going down anyway.
---
Don't know if it's just me but survivor queues on xbox take around 10 seconds to get into a lobby lol.
---
I started the game when Freddy cane out. My first survivor match was getting tunneled into the ground by Freddy. And having absolutely no understanding why the environment kept changing colors.
---
Same here. The dude fell for the simple mindgame of pretending to turn around to make the survivor hesitate. He probably DC'ed out of embarrasment considering he had 3.5k hours in the game.
---
You got camped once so now you BM every chance you get? That sounds exhausting.
---
I have a couple
---
•bubba is actually not underpowered and well he isnt great he is no where near bottom tier ppl just dk how to play him.
---
•spirit is not op at all just her addons are her base kit does not need a nerf imo. 
---
•meg and nea aren’t ugly at all
---
•spirit has some of the worst killer cosmetics in the game besides her new one.
---
•this community is toxic but ppl make it seem ten times worse than it is, imo competitive fighting games,online shooters, etc  have way worse communities.
---
Remember when bps were brown? That was great
---
"it's in the name "survivor" you know? Why would they do anything other than absolutely everything in their power to survive and win the trial?" They literally do that, then shit talk you after game for not catching them. While I understand your main point that we shouldn't hate each other, I don't think you understand how much of an entitlement it is to be a survivor main over killers and how many more opportunities you have to be toxic than killers, which survivors 100% abuse. Shit gets old.
---
Like so many before you.
---
Dads have a way easier time cosplaying wraith for some reason, he cosplayed wraith when I was born and I never saw him
---
My friend had his first couple of games with me yesterday...
---
The first was a Myers who thought he was trolling, wasn't really too bad except for having to deal with ruin
---
The second was a very sweaty wraith with Ruin, nurses calling, NOED and I believe STBFL, and an ebony mori plus coxcombed clapper and "Windstorm" white. He camped outside the shack and waited for anyone to come save the hooked survivor. Another of the survivors was a baby Claudette, she was the last alive, and the killer knocked her down, let her open the exit gates... and then slapped her down and let her crawl towards the exit for a few seconds before using his mori to finish her off. I was amazed at the amount of sweat and that it had to be two new players that had to deal with it when one barely just learned how to put on perks.
---
I understand they are supposed to be killers but jesus christ was this a bad introduction to the game when my friend's second game was the sweatiest killer I've ever met (I haven't played much myself, but i'd say I'm getting pretty decent)
---
Well you do have a point I suppose. It just annoys me seeing all these "THeY RuINeD ThE PIg!" posts when survivors have been getting nerfed for a year now.
---
And it STILL doesn't help against AMAZING surviors (something almost no survivor is) so basically, survivors have been getting SCREWED HARD for around a year, but because some players are absolutely amazing, we can't complain.
---
I'm new. I assumed that was the case lol. Such an obvious addition.
---
When they wounded they moan and I follow.
---
Oh so because you’re immature then that’s the standard for everyone else
---
They do tho. The entity doesn’t like you but they like your emotions.
---
Groove check
---
Pardon
---
Pyramid head from silent hill
---
Yeah that probably would've been confusing. I playing on console-- right before Myers came out
---
2 people said i was gonna get banned because i 4kd them i have images if you want proof also i play on ps4
---
For the most part yes, dcing is stupid. But when the killer slugs you for the 4k without knowing where my teammate is, it’s kind of too boring.
---
that's the best news I've heard all day
---
Its frowned upon but honestly you bought the game so do whatever you want
---
Hm
---
Christ, I had one game and I find someone really fast, and down them and before I even pick them up they DC, and then their friend DCs, and I hit the third person and they DC, and the fourth guy gets the hatch spawning on his feet so he instantly goes in.
---
I de-pipped twice.
---
Pyramid Head, from Silent Hill.
---
No problem! Feel free to ask me any other questions you have! Welcome to the Fog!
---
Imagine if they released the 3.3.0 update on 22nd. The game would probably be unplayable, especially on console. But some people don't understand that. I hope they fix it with all the other bugs, because it might be annoying to restart the game every time this happens.
---
Yeah he’s pretty good after the rework.
---
Why the hate for nea?
---
Well I mean you are ruining their fun. Think of it like this. You get like 6 games in a row where the killer dc at the start. Just play. I hate doctor but I don't dc. You will be fine.
---
Heya, from Reddit lol. I made a YouTube video on where to find hundreds of designs and how to install them if you are running default look.
---
Ty again. Um, I do have one question. How do obsessions work? How to I trigger them?
---
No hate. Its just that alot of pink hair neas are toxic
---
Not even when they are losing
---
God, that final tbag, so good, must have been satisfactory.
---
Well everyone in the game dcd because spirit op lmao
---
These posts love you too ♥️
---
Haha yeah I got yelled at for doing nothing, but I'll admit it was my like 3rd game. I wasnt to sure wtf I was doing xD
---
The fact he plays Fortnite means nothing. Yes, I know, it's the hated game where all whiny little kids go to - but the fact is, it works pretty well and people are very satisfied with it.
---
Still just play at least you get some bp
---
Was someone in a game you were playing named waifufrenzy or catter_cutter by any chance ps4
---
That is abuse, sir.
---
Wish my friend and I could meet a killer like you so he could get a good experience, instead we got the opposite: Meta perks, ebony mori, stealth camping and an ultra-rare add-on
---
Chrismas on Easter!
---
Yes.
---
Unless she's running spirit beads.
---
See, I would survive but a baby Plague with no perks would get an easy sacrifice
---
Mate there's thousands of them.
---
Haha yeah I've gotten so many escapes thanks to being last survivor and killer was nice.
---
Aw thank you xx
---
They do drop them. But if you blind them during the pickup animation, they will only drop them if you time the blind perfectly.
---
Ah damn
---
Quick AF RN on switch.
---
blame him -&gt; ttv/takeo906 :)
---
This happened to me but it was 2 red dwights circling the basement hook and i was terrified
---
All my pockets are fake!
---
I actually think that was the game we met someone called notnoob3 on the survivor team
---
For absolutely no reason(that I can tell) I had someone tell me that they were going to report me and my friend for hacking. He never said what we were doing. To my friend he did say that he was going to remove all female gamers from psn
---
Stop complaining just for the sake of complaining. It makes you sound really stupid.
---
If you time it too soon and they're in the animation of picking them up then it'll just blind them, you have to time it so that as it's blinding them the animation ends or else they will keep carrying them instead of dropping them, you can test in a KYF of you wanna learn how to do it but after a little bit you'll be able to know when to start blinding them out of instinct
---
It's pretty common in the UK to just say "verse" even though everyone knows it's versus. It just flows easier to skip out the extra syllable, especially if the following word begins with an S.
---
"Versus spirit" has two awkward stunts in the flow that feel unnatural and slow down the entire sentence, but if you say "verse spirit" you can trail the S es together so it flows like one word.
---
It's really got nothing to do with intelligence, it's just easier for the flow of a sentence. Do you also have a problem with Can't and Don't? Or so you prefer cannot and do not?
---
Ligma balls
---

TRAPPER DESTROYS TRIGGERED SURVIVOR MAIN WITH FACTS AND LOGIC
---
He seemed to still be enjoying it somewhat though, even though he barely understands how to survive, I think I'm gonna teach him in a kill your friends match or two when we play together again
---
Start blinding right when they are being brought up to the shoulder if you do it too early they are still in the pick up animation and cannot drop the survivor during that. Takes some practice to get right even then you will miss sometimes because the timing is kinda specific
---
Yesterday I joined a game and the guy said “I dc nurse spirit Ghostface Freddy fyi”
---
So I simply left the lobby before game started. 2 games later same guy - I told him to fuck off and stop ruining lobbys to which he called me toxic.
---
So against Plague I left him on hook and teabagged - sure enough he DCed. Two games later got him AGAIN. Sandbagged him in front of billy and left him on hook - DCed again.
---
I figure if he’s going to ruin games for people I will at least ruin his games when he wants to stay. I did appreciate him warning us but in a small pool we are going to get him every 2-3 games, why should I have to look for a new lobby each time or risk instaDC.
---
Thats so confusing I wish they had a tutorial for this stuff .-.
---
If Swan Song did that, it'd need it's action speed removed.
---
Ive played it a total of 5 times. Its a genuine question
---
The main reason the game is survivor favored, is because the game is balanced around 1 solo killer vs 4 solo survivors. Then devs added swf.
---
I hate to be that guy but, what dies swf stand for?
---
No, SOMETIMES that is bugged,  but as the spirit is currently designed, you don't hear the phasing noise while in the terror radius. Spine Chill also doesn't work if the killer rotates themselves to look at you during phasing
---
Of the 2 chainsaw killers: billy boi should emphasize speed, and leather face should emphasize power, so I say that leather face when chainsawing can saw right through a dropped pallet and just keep going, maybe with a little slow if it’s overbearing but just let him barrel through pallets with his chainsaw.
---
survive with friends
---
When playing Trapper, try placing a bear trap on the corner of a loop rather than right next to a pallet. I tend to get better results.
---
Don't be afraid to commit more than one trap to areas that survivors will loop for days if they aren't shut down quickly.
---
Similarly, don't be afraid to place a trap mid loop to force a survivor to leave and possibly force them into a pre-trapped loop.
---
Trapper also has an extremely strong basement game while still being able to patrol. You will snowball and probably 4k if the survivors get too altruistic.
---
Was gonna comment this. Would love to see a series of these for all the killers!
---
BL3 is the only other game I currently play besides DbD lmao
---
Yes, we're so entitled and toxic for expecting a Halloween-dedicated event in a horror game to come out before Halloween, for expecting BHVR to get just a single update right, and for expecting even the slightest bit of compensation for their habitual fucking up.
---
&gt;everyone who is sitting here acting as though these people, actual human beings not AI who build games for your amusement
---
It's their fucking *job*. They are *paid* to make this game. They're only human, yes, but not even human beings fuck up as routinely as BHVR does.
---
Lmao. I'm the third Dwight. Fun times xD
---
My understanding it that the loud noise notifications only occur if a player misses a skill check while destroying the portal or it is desroyed. As for killer instinct, this occurs when charging your main ability while someone is on or near a portal, this is how you are supposed to track when survivors are destroying them.
---
she was being camped and tunneled. so we gave up on her, i mean gave up on that game :( poor meg
---
I love head on, as a surv. (obviously), but as a killer too. It's a fun perk imo, if you don't get triggered easily.
---
The portal has to be activated first in order to get the killer instinct.
---
Have you played killer on Xbox? Not the most difficult thing to miss a swing once in a while lmao
---
No post game chat on console, you can message people seperately.
---
Ye my main killer set up is thrilling tremors, a nurses calling, Bbq and ruin. Nurses is amazing and like you said thrilling tremors slows the game down a bit but is mainly used for recon.
---
Had a survivor tell me to ‘let them play’. Bruh im a killer, my whole job is to stop you playing😅
---
I'm not sure which part of that implies I'm a 15 year old.  You might need to step away from the computer and video games for a little while, pal. You seem pretty sore about something. 😂
---
Thank you for being the only person on this comment thread with a sense of compassion :) Really shows your maturity compared to the other kids on this thread (I’m actually 20, I was just fucking with them)
---
I always run unbreakable and tenacity together. (Mostly because I suck)
---
Some Russian words lol. 
---
Jokes aside there was these 2 swf blocked my loop and let me die on the hook. Their reason was apparently I unhooked one of them unsafely. I call that bullshit because it was totally safe. I couldn’t even hear the heartbeat when I saved him. Most likely his friend was close by and because I got the unhook, they get mad at me.
---
And of course the classic “I hope you get cancer” and “enjoy your ban, ez report”. I almost forgot these ones lol.
---
I'm 90% sure you can't do 2v4. You can do 2v3 though
---
also it is so satisfying when u hit it more than one in one game 👌
---
You can I believe!
---
The mori sounds too much like the demos mori honestly
---
But you can't have 6 people in a game
---
I'm rank 11 Killer, and now I'm rank 7 survivor. However, I've had the same wait time as a survivor when I was rank 14.
---
Myers has good perks. 
---
Myers is a good killer.
---
Kate is a skin. 
---
Kate doesn’t have that good of perks at all.
---
Omg same. I’m a meg main and I rely too much on stupid jukes cause I can’t loop for shit, but as a killer (I’m trying spirit because I find her mechanic the easiest besides hag) and I get looped for days, and I leave survivors I can’t get but I stress because I can’t find anyone and it all snowballs into a mess lmao
---
I mean, most of the time, this is the case. But sometimes it's people's builds for certain killers. Some people use it only for one exact killer because the killer is weak or they haven't mastered the skill the killer has yet. And sometimes people just use it against solo cues.
---
but he's camping and tunneling that poor meg ;) so he deserved it i guess?!
---
Aye, I’ve only gotten the chance to put in a couple games as demogorgon myself so I wasn’t entirely sure of the specifics.
---
Hello! Free tip to push passed that. The key to becoming a really good survivor is to realize that you have the power. Example, 3 survivors remain including yourself. Two of them are on a gen and you know it’s about 30-50% completed. You PURPOSEFULLY go find the killer and make him start chasing you because you have adrenaline and give zero shits. He chases you for a while without realizing what you’ve done.... the gen pops, you sprint burst away and the killer feelsbadman. You mention feeling scared. As soon as you start realizing you have nothing to be scared of and that the killer is eventually going to find you and chase you, but that it’s actually a GOOD thing, you’re game will improve leaps and bounds.
---
I forgot the socks in the pic, do better than me!
---
Can't wait for Project Resistance man
---
Sounds good to me, Ill be waiting!
---
I second this as a Myers main and whilst playing survivor he's fun to against
---
They... do?
---
My build often revolves around pebble
---
If you want a good read on a fair way to implement a counter measure to d/c, read my post I made on the forums called "worthy of the entity" or WOTE for short

tldr, a bonus for having met participation requirements per match in the last 10 matches, ie exclusive temporary outfits, banners, names, or even blood point modifiers.
---
and please leave a comment while your there I dont want the thread to die
---
My dad thought it'd be hilarious if the survivors were watching for madness skillchecks and they didn't notice Michael approaching.
---
I'd love this. Not as stealthy as his other skins but for some reason, I want it :)
---
im just wondering, was that myers on the whiteboard inspired by [this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dlo41x/michael_givin_out_a_vibe_check/)
---
Absolutely beautiful! GF is my main XD
---
At Green ranks you can 4K playing Jake so use any killer you like.  
---
At Purple ranks you can still pretty much use any killer but your loadouts should be at least semi-optimal perk wise.
---
At Red ranks it becomes harder to win with lower tier killers consistently though it isn't impossible.  Your loadouts should be highly optimal at this point perk wise.  The low tier killers start needing addons at this point too.  If you want to win consistently at red ranks or at least put yourself in position to Nurse, Spirit, Freddy and Billy are all rock solid for dealing with bullshit swf groups.  Honorable mentions to Hag and Huntress if you're good enough with them.
---
You hacker how do you have the pustula plants already?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dnlq02/are_killer_shards_still_glitched/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Aren’t you the one that posted your, and I quote: « toxic spirit build » earlier? and you’re now making a meme about survivors because they’re using the exact same term to call you out?
---
It could be you weren't standing in the right spot. The prompt seems kinda picky.
---
one day you'll be a man.
---
i'm 32.
---
but you care about people leaving matches in a casual party game.
---
If your on console it’s highly possible it’s fucking up their frames and shit
---
It’s because we don’t play on pc and to use it looks good
---
i see tunneling as just taking out the easiest target tbh, i dont see a problem with it at all, the job of a killer is to kill, its not to let an easy target escape and potentially ruin the chances of winning
---
At least try to get everyone on death hook before last gen is done. I’m a rank 4 killer, I don’t camp and tunnel to get kills.
---
I main legion, let me tell you, bamboozle works very well. It even speeds up the fast vault in feral frenzy. It's the clown perk that blocks off windows with a side benefit of increasing vault speed.
---
you the one that said your build was toxic https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dnij4t/im_a_toxic_bitch/ second killers bitch and cry all the time about survivors using keys instant heals etc etc the list goes on both sides bitch to much
---
never ever call the demogorgon *the gorgon*
---
So people keep playing the game to grind towards something like 9K shards for a new character or a new cosmetic.
---
Or P3 if people still care about that...
---
My first game went alot different 💀
---
Probably thought you were going to run into the exit sooner than you did.
---
Literally a free win... They're all likely going to be shit with flashlights and not do gens. Flashlight saves and blinds in general are so easy to counter.
---
This is awesome! Thank you!
---
If you guys went to play other games instead of waiting 10 minutes for a DCd lobby then maybe BHVR would feel some pressure and fix matchmaking.
---
So stupid that theyd rather let players wait forever then just do away woth ranks and do quickplay.
---
Bruh so far a little bit and definitely are tied.
---
If the dwight loops and has teachables from other characters, that’s a giveaway.
---
If they are terrified and badly hiding behind things whenever you are remotely close, they are likely new.
