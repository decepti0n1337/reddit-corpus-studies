The survivors should have useful info on the killer.
---
---
---
A day late boy-o
---
There's definitely times to camp.
---
Honestly, just use whatever killer you're the most comfortable using. If you play better, you get more points. Although, some killers struggle getting deviousness points (the Pig comes to mind). But yeah, slap on BBQ and a survivor pudding and try to get a lot of hooks and use your power a lot.
---
No witch hunts
---
I kinda like this idea for saboteur. It adds a little bit more functionality and also gives you information that you wouldn't usually get. Nice idea!
---
Exactly this, if there's 5 gens left and 1 guy on a hook you may as well camp or at least patrol around, they're likely all 3 running to the hook.
---
*yoink. I’lllllllll take that.
---
Solved by kindred!
---
Myers if you want all the ladies to flock to you. 
---

---
Cannibal if you want easy BP and don’t care if people think you’re gross. 
---
Pig if you like cute stun noises and spooks. 
---
Spirit if you want to be a racecar. 
---
Legion if you want everyone to hate you. 
---
Plague if you want to be a Huntress main but can’t bother to practice hatchets.
---
I main Pig and Spirit myself but LF’s BBQ is a must for people who play any killer.
---
Ok
---
What are you getting at? You said no one does totems. Just trolling?
---
Myers is my favourite killer in the game. He is so much fun to play, I’d go for him.
---
Those aren't Freddy mains.  They're people in the "7 seconds so he sucks" camping playing that way because they think it's all they can do.  I wish more people learnt how to play sweater boi properly

I miss the weekly streams with Mathieu and not_queen, it’s a shame we won’t be getting those anymore.
---
Yup, played 3 games in a row with hard tunnels. Even to the point where my other team mates tried to protect me long enough to be healed by the other guy. They tried body blocking the hag, trying to take hits, but the hag would only go for me. 
---
The others called the Killer out in post game and they said "so Im not supposed to go for the injured person". The others said they tried body blocking/standing in front of them to intentionally take them off of me/to take the hit but the Killer chose to ignore the other 3 physically trying to intervene. Weird shit.
---
Nice try. But that doesn’t apply here.
---
That's right, take your L and leave. I chewed you up and spit you out libtard.
---
You didn't address the poster who replied to you that you can just 99% the heal and completely avoid having your aura exposed.
---
Link me to where they said they don't care, please.
---
Wow! This is exactly why I don't do that kinda stuff. On a side note the spirit looks so weird when she is nodding like that. Lol!
---
Every one on this subreddit keeps saying ranked. What is that? Is it just a normal game?
---
Bo0b3
---
When I play survivor usually the only reason I do it is to distract from a chase that's currently happening. That's just me though, I definitely have run into people who do it just to be cocky and I know what it's like when survivors won't just leave.
---
On Freddy whe  survivors intentionally fail skill checks to wake up, the extra gen regression is exactly what you want
---
Self Care is terrible and I'd much rather take Pharmacy
---
So eye for eye is good in your opinion?

---
Oh I'll look at all of these and maybe comment on some of these ideas (and by comment I mean like, suggest my own)
---
If you see this while scrolling, I recommend you check this out. ALOT of ideas here!
---
The in-game settings are quite limited. No exclusive fullscreen mode and accompanying resolution setting, no option to disable V-Sync (a function that increases input latency and doesn't even serve any worthwhile purpose in windowed/windowed fullscreen modes, due to desktop compositing already eliminating frame tearing), no advanced input settings (I would like to use raw input, for example), and I'm pretty sure the sensitivity setting does not work at all.
---
However, since the game is Unreal Engine-based, there are ways you can help yourself do the things the developers for some reason don't. For sensitivity, head to the Input.ini file located in AppData\Local\DeadByDaylight\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor. In that file, you are looking for the following entries:
---
AxisMappings=(AxisName="LookUp",Scale=-1.000000,Key=MouseY)
---
AxisMappings=(AxisName="Turn",Scale=1.000000,Key=MouseX)
---
Changing -1.000000 (vertical sensitivity)/1.000000 (horizontal sensitivity) to another value will change your in-game sensitivity (for both roles); -0.500000/0.500000 would halve your sensitivity, for example.
---
BBQ is great to weed out the weak survivors of the team who are always across the map doing gens and nothing else. Believe it or not, I’ve gotten to P3 on four killers so far and still haven’t bought leatherface for BBQ. I’ve just been planning on getting it. Feels like I’ve wasted so much time grinding for BP without it smh
---
As long as they dont let me go into stage 2 we're all good. Let me hang there
---
11k BP for a killer is the equivalent of getting, like, 2-4k as a survivor. Embarrassingly low.
---
You won’t need to if you don’t A. Tunnel and B.  survivors aren’t unhooking other survivors in front of you. In which I would normally chase the farming survivor.
---
Plus the DS is a stun to the killer in which he can resume the chase, NOED often means an escape that was likely is now gone. NOED in its current state is wayyyy more powerful than the nerfed DS.
---
WhY ArE SuRvIvOr mAiNs sO ToXiC?
---
I think we've already talked on this one, but yeah, I understand.
---
That's why the non-obsession version should be changed.
---
Idk what boring ppl downvoted you smh. Keep drawing bitchin art (and kinky art)
---
No, that has nothing to do with hitboxes at all. How could it? If the pallet throw is completed, then it will stun the killer, and stunned killers stop having an attack hitbox. Nor does it have anything to do with FPS. That's only ever lag, and it's not the kind of lag that can really be fixed by dedicated servers, either. It is impossible to perfectly synchronize real-time multiplayer games. Ping means everyone sees the same event at slightly different times.
---
If you want to know how much lag is happening at a pallet, watch what happens to the killer. Stuns have to be confirmed, so the killer isn't "effectively" stunned (their attack cancelled) until the message that you threw the pallet reaches their computer and you won't see the stun on your screen until the message bounces back to your computer. But on your screen the pallet will push the killer out of the way immediately, because it'd look janky as hell if the killer was just "inside" every pallet for a couple frames, right?
---
So if you can tell that a killer was pushed out from under the pallet before getting stunned (instead of seeing it as all happening at once), that means the lag was high enough for you to visually see the lag. If you get hit during this period (after the push, before the stun), it was a lag hit - either your lag or the killer's.
---
Since this is a P2P game, "whose lag is it anyway?" is kind of a moot question. You don't have individual pings, you just have pings to eachother. Maybe you have a bad ping to the killer because he's torrenting a bunch of porn. Maybe you have a bad ping to the killer because *you're* torrenting a bunch of porn. Maybe you have bad ping to the killer because the two of you are on different continents and BHVR's central matchmaking stupidly decided to put you in a game together - and that would be BHVR's fault, not either of your's. Well, maybe we can blame survivors who click ready with shitty ping a *tiny* bit.
---
More focused on console optimization and dedicated servers probably, which I personally think are more important than cross-play. Though it would be a nice thing to have.
---
&gt; Honestly, it's fine on one person as-is.
---
Unfortunately that a moot point because it's not as if MoM limits can be enforced, that's why survivor perks and items need to be viewed from the perspective of what gameplay looks like when they're stacked. Now, I know the pro-MoM arguments; survivors would *never* do something like run 3-4 in a match and/or use them in combination with insta-heals, it's a completely fake situation that shouldn't be considered.....but still, in the event that killers can't trust the Honor System, maybe we should look at sensible adjustments.
---
Pharmacy is better imo
---
I've run into several Davids that feed the killers
---
It's not camping anymore. It's soft patrolling.
---
These look...bad
---
Would be pretty good if it actually worked consistently
---
My bad, I thought I replied to the wrong post so I deleted and re-posted
---
What about the addendum "If the killer is within 32 meters, their aura is revealed to all players", which would let all the other players run amok on gens
---
Thanks, be sure to toss it around to discussion-minded friends as well!
---
Nurse is highkey amazing on gideons
---
Pressing your mouse button harder to shoot faster or deal more damage in a FPS
---

---
be ashamed of who you are
---
22 isn’t rare at all. It happens multiple times a week when I play. Sucks dick. 
---
Yet another match just lost with these unplayable broken glitches :/
---
What happened to the devstream? I just noticed the latest one was back in February and I hadn't been watching the ones before that either due to lack of interest at the time
---
Maybe "if the killer is within 32 meters for a cumulative 10 seconds, their aura is revealed and hook time is extended by 45 seconds." - take that, campers
---
That's a pretty dick move imo.
---
I wouldnt say it is a bug. You just need to meet criteria to pip. I had zero alturistic points and very little objective. So the game depips me. But a killer dc should automatically safety pip you.
---
I really wanna run lightweight, but it's garbage.
---
Killing survivors is the only objective killers have. It's so funny when people act like it's a special case when they do their objective efficiently
---
Noed is fine
---
I don’t understand why it’s so fuckin hard to cleanse those totems... there are literally 5 of them
---
Survivors don’t want to waste time and always just gen gen gen.... then when killers complain gens get done too quick, they say “it’s our only objective har har”... oh, you mean besides getting totems and surviving chases? Those are objectives, of how about saving teammates?
---
Totems are an important thing, and I believe noed is a healthy perk because it forces survivors to add that extra time waster of getting totems... at least in theory... however for some unknown reason, people would rather bum rush the gens and forget about that totem sitting there...
---
If you do that, you deserve that noed to the teeth.  There is a reason every killer runs ruin, most killers can’t physically be everywhere, so if survivors are spread out gens will pop no matter how good you are... 
---
DO totems= no risk of noed or hex’s = little extra time for killers= less complaining from both sides as killers gain a little more time from gens being popped too fast and survivors never see noed again...
---
I am. :(
---
Personally I find healing myself to be more reliable than finding a teammate to heal me since I have more freedom to choose when and where to heal.
---
There's something beautiful about watching someone teabag and then get dicked on. Thank :')
---
Bird Up!
---
Then it's absurd lol, 32 meters to Kindred's 8? Nty
---
I’ve slugged the person with it and left them to hunt others and when he got up I can still see them.
---
The hatch closes because it was opened with a key and it only stays open for a certain period of time with the key. Also, there were two survivors still in the game. If she was the last one it wouldn’t have shut.
---
If you want to reliably pip as a survivor you basically have to carry your team.
---
I’ve actually seen this before, it was back during late last summer and every few games you would have gens spawning right next to each other. I could see them with my map. Was a bug and they patched it from what I remember.
---
staring at a survivor for 5-10 mins and getting get rushed. Now that's some gameplay.
---
Poised is basically a better version now.
---
Slightly late to the party, but I just had a game vs. a Nurse where 1 guy DC'd, all gens got done anyway (with no hooks), then someone popped a hex totem - a NOED. The Nurse immediately DC'd.

---
All 3 survivors will not rush the hook in an SWF unless you are already camping. It's easy communication to say "he's camping, do gens" or "I'm right by him you guys stay on gens"
---
Explains the spaghetti code the devs use to write this game!
---
Toxic dickhead had it coming.
---
I'm the spookyest myers :)
---
Hard Bail seems almost useless considering the killer usually isn't close enough to go after scratch marks, unless it's from a distance and the scratch marks are on the map's border walls.
---
Low profile seems okay, gives you more time to get away and avoid getting tunneled.
---
Bounce back seems too strong considering how easy it is to get safe unhooks.
---
How did you get this screenshot of me without my permission
---
Pig is a blast. I vote Pig!
---
Did you not hear that this game is trash? Fun but the devs are lazy and shitty people.
---
English isn't my native language either, it's German. You don't see me mess up irregular verbs.
---
My go to is bloodhound sloppy save the best for last and bbq
---
Strat is to attack non obsession. Hook. Leave for gen keep an eye on hooked survivor if they save too early punish the rescuer with increased attack cooldown then go for the wounded target with invis (this is where sloppy bloodhound comes in) rinse and repeat. Usually puts way to much pressure on survivors to stay on gens.
---
Survivors cant lose you. You may exchange bloodhound for nurses but ive found that bloodhound will often lead you to targets before they start thinking its safe to heal. And often times can actually lead you to finding survivors after they have healed by leaving blood so you know they were in the vicinity recently. 
---
Build also work extremely well slugging after you get the first down after someone rescues. You can instantly have 3 people occupied.
---
Well, call me shit, but I love having bond + flashlight and when I'm in a chase I run to a imersive survivor and click the flashlight in him, the best part is when the killer chase the guy and leave me.
---
Funny how Dwight is the one with the killer and not Meg. Usually its Meg.
---
As a Myers main 
---
I fucking love this
---
The website is real

Both DLC are really good. If you are looking for a killer that is hard to master but is considered high tier by the dbd community then I would go for the Spirit DLC. She is an amazing killer with a high skill ceiling. 
---
The pig is a much more versatile killer with a power that has a stealth &amp; time wasting component to it. Pig is definitely one of the best M1 killers with amazing build diversity. Not as good as spirit but easier to play &amp; can be more fun if you're into experimenting with different perk builds or want more stealth-based gameplay. 
---
For survivor content, both DLC have decent perks. SAW has more survivor perks that are based around completing gens as efficiently as possible with stake-out actually being a soft counter to ruin which is quite nice &amp; detectives hunch working well with maps. 
---
Shattered bloodline DLC has relatively poor survivor perks except Deliverance. Deliverance is a really good perk but relies on you not being the first survivor found. 
---
I would suggest probably the shattered bloodline DLC. The killer is hard to master but is really good with fun perks while the survivor perk deliverance is really fun to use. 
---
SAW DLC perks are not that great for survivor with stake-out probably being the best survivor perk.
---
lmao
---
I feel ya. I don't want to buy leatherface for one of his perks. I have the other two and I would never play him... Sucks.
---
the extra regression is mediocre at best. The opportunity cost of that perk slot is not worth it.
---
Look at those downvotes, then consider rethinking. It might be indicative of something.
---
Lol you gotta come better than that little boy if you want me to bite on your trolls.  Your motive is transparent, you're not even trying.
---
I think it's why no one even plays the nurse on console tbh. I tried twice and the controls are awful for her. 
---
I wonder if I've ran into you tho, I hadn't seen nurse for a year until very recently on ps4.
---
It doesn't matter what option is better. Common entitled survivor rhetoric is you *must* leave the hook, regardless of if you see nearby would-be rescuers. Slugging is just another "toxic behavior" to these people because anything that doesn't directly improve their chances of survival is something that must be attacked and shamed to not happen anymore.
---
I like hybridpanda because he seems so nice and he actively works to not tunnel or be toxic. Hes so fun! Hes also pretty good at the game, and can sometimes share info on how to get better.
---
Tru3ta1ent is nice because hes just good and kind of cute. Hes more focused on winning honestly so he will tunnel saved people sometimes but overall hes really good at the game and often tries to explain what hes doing and why.
---
No, I’m talking about “toxic switch”
---
You got caught so u best wait
---
Yeah I hear that and it's unfortunate. 
---
 I do upvote people quite a bit too and If they look into it at all I definitely would like them to see that even in some situations that look shitty in someone's part they were actually doing their best and/or weren't being toxic.
---
I honestly don't want you to reply, that's why I said as much... I know reading is hard.
---
Let me troll in peace you don't have to butt in on every single dbd post, nobody cares about you or your opinions. Stop looking for validation from internet strangers. Go outside. Leave me be .
---
I saw true talent check like 5 or 6 gens before a phase change earlier on swamp, though he was Nurse. Billy, wraith with windstorm, and spirit with speed add ons probably have a similar effect
---
I love this
---
Glad you like it 🖤
---
Lol you're that special type of sad where you get off trolling on the internet and I'm the one looking for validation?  Pot have you met kettle, kettle have you met pot?
---
FunGoose explicitly explains what he's doing and why at all times. Puppers is fun to watch and very positive/friendly. Ohmwrecker is fun to watch, but he only streams once a week on Twitch and isn't always up-to-date on new info/the meta/etc.
---
Ah yes, the fabled wee-wee walk of old.
---
Just start watching good streamers and youtubers like Puppers, Scottjund, Tru3, Noob3, Monto, etc. 
---
I can list some off the top of my head for you:  
---
-generally every killer needs Hex:Ruin, so there's one slot taken by default,  
---
-Enduring+Spirit Fury = every third pallet is a free hit,  
---
-BBQ is top tier and usually ran on most builds,  
---
-Nurse's Calling + Sloppy Butcher is a good mix,  
---
Those are some general perks, but every killer is different and benefits more or less from certain perks.
---
Another libtard owned.... epic style 😎😎😎
---
I second true. I know he gets some hate here but I think it’s mostly undeserved. He’s really good at the game and is one of the few streamers who plays both Survivor and Killer.

Well the OP never insinuated towards that anywhere in the post, so my apologies for missing the joke
---
Can killers see you while you’re in a locker with bbq and chili?
---
pretty underpowered i agree
---
u/themikeotr
---
Fight fire with fire
---
Unfortunately the wraith isn’t the strongest...Ruin feels necessary sometimes. Or go for NOED? Otherwise you gotta break them pallets. Enduring and Spirit Fury are always awesome. Unless you play the wraith add ons that break pallets super fast. 
---
Fast wraith: BBQ, Make Your Choice, Ruin and Enduring (or bamboozle)
---
Wraith who can vault and kick super fast : Ruin (or pop goes the weasel!), Nurses, Make Your Choice and you pick the last perk. You have to loop and bait pallet throws with this build to eliminate them quickly. Then it’s a mind game to get people to drop pallets or take the hit. 
---
On the wrong map wraith is super hard to play. He’s not a top tier killer IMO but can be lots of fun.
---
First off, I think you meant to say "Nice try, but that doesn't apply here". Second, it does because he's (intentionally or not) ignoring the point that flashlights are still annoying regardless of how meta they are.
---
I've had an idea for a while that WGLF get an added bonus. Anytime a stack is gained, or would have been gained if you're at the cap, nearby survivors (not you) have their scratch marks and aura hidden X seconds (maybe around 10 or so). 
---
It'll make it a bit more difficult to find recently unhooked survivors, especially if the speedier killers return to the hook.
---
Wasn't the whooshing sound also directional? So survivors could discern where she was phasing based on that.
---
Ha ha ha....... *I do that*
---
I dont listen to anything in the post chat other than GG.
---
It's really just BBQ and Distressing, for a massive heartbeat and all the bp.  Even with just getting everyone on a hook, it's at least as much as a good game with any other killer.
---
Don't attempt it on console though.  It drags down performance by a massive amount, and god help you and the survivors if you get a farm map or Red Forest.  It'll be a slideshow for all.
---
No they can't
---
Well. Fucking. Done.
---
Unlike the survivor in question
---
Firstly, don’t go correcting people online on their grammar; it’s a cockhead thing to do, nobody’s impressed.
---
And can’t something be both bad and annoying? Freddy’s annoying to go up against, but he’s not exactly the hardest killer in the game now is he? All he said was flashlights aren’t that good anymore, he made no comment on how annoying they were.
---
Sorry, but only someone who hasn't played killer much would say True tunnels. He'll try and go for others if targets are available, but he isn't going to play like an idiot and not take targets of opportunity out if they present themselves. That isn't tunneling - that's a bad survivor or survivors being outplayed.
---
He had that coming
---
6 dc's  tonight and no toolboxes. Tool boxes don't make that big of a difference. Get in the game and KILL KILL KILL
---
Which is why I said I kindof like it.  It would have to be finely tuned to be far enough so that a survivor could get a save if the killer was doing what you said, but close enough that killers that aren't camping can punish unsafe unhooks.
---
I don't trust them to get the balance right on that distance though.
---
Yeah it does so if there are only two survivors left and I activate mom on one. I leave them and go hunt the other one. You can constantly see them and it makes it easy to tell if they meet up to heal him.
---
Underwhelming as always lol
---
I don't think most killers are terrible people who live to see survivors suffer.
---
I never ready up as killer for this reason...
---
I don’t even care if they use toolboxes or whatever, it’s just if they try to be sneaky and throw it on last second like they just pulled one over on you... They will pay the price
---
Especially if they wait for the 5 second countdown, I will leave the lobby, out of pure principle... killers are allowed to see survivors... if I see toolboxes or flashlights or whatever, I can prepare, maybe even use franklins or something. But if they sneak, nah
---
Oof.  Any suggestions outside of them?
---
Ahh. The killer mains are all calling for a nerf. I almost feel like this has happened before
---
So thaaaats how they get you through windows, their invisible nose enters your hit box!
---
Plenty.  When I play Doctor I like running around and just hitting people with his shockwave and not actually hitting people.
---
They are waiting for a match...
---
They announced they will soon. BUT THAT WAS BACK IN OCTOBER
---
I run deliverance to fuck with campers. Most of the time they’ll swing at you proudly while on the hook and while they wipe they’re blade I test away. Toss on DS and gg ez
---
What platform are you on? Maybe we can play together sometime
---
The fact that Max has any kind of animation for Bear traps tells me something Multi-Killer is being worked on.

---
ofc it's not nice to hear. It just added some extra humour to the game. Killing the Ash was my target of the game (though I didn't hard tunnel), getting salt on top of achieving my goal was a nice touch when 3 of them were attempting to be toxic. I usually just ignore and leave if not a gg.
---
Isnt it wonderful seeing how much a game can enrage some people.

tunneling isn't efficient though. Downing ALL 4 people and killing them fast is efficient. Downing 1 person over and over while ignoring everyone else isn't efficient.

Sounds like you have a case of little brother syndrome tbh. Balance is in a good spot right now besides a few things here and there, like the busted MoM perk.
---
what is this? never saw it lately
---
When I first started playing dbd I genuinely thought I was genius for facecamping at the hook. In my mind it was a great strategy. ((EYEROLL))

This sub is fucking weird. Yet here I am.

What would anyone do that?

Unless your partnered with someone in a contest or something and plan on sharing the prize or something

Happens a lot as doctor got hate mail saying I camped and was using a op killer and said I payed to win even though doctor was free

Oof. Yeah I’ll put a trap on someone and they’ll instant dc. Or if I have the *audacity* to down them when I happen to come across them taking off their trap.

Yay! Add me on steam: TheLoreExplorer
---
Respect!
---
Bricky
---
He’s funny and he plays killer
---
I’ll try haha
---
Still new to gaming on computer.  I’ll send you a fr ASAP
---
Agreed. I try to, not always successfully, pick out 3-4 gens that are closest to each other and stick close. It's not ur fault they did the gems in that order.
---
Cool :)
---
Definitely buy oinkers
---
Maby your bad at survivor 
---
Git gud gg ez
---
Send a screenshot of you getting a perfect with a mori.
---
Left: Tier 3 
---
Right: Tier 2 after being looped through tier 3
---
i’ve always wondered what that symbol means. can someone explain?
---
And they say NOED is OP
---
Yeah this community is full to the brim with salty, self centered, woe is me types.
---
Just ignore any hate you get an play to have fun.
---
Pallets are too wonky and window can be hit through. Hopefully Dedicated Servers fix the latancy since the game favors the killers screen over the surviviors.
---
I have a lot of survivors disconnect against me then send me hate messages. I just screenshot the point total at the end and circle how they got 0 blood points and send it back to them.
---
But Shrine... It's the third time you brought Overwhelming Presence this month
---
Lol busted, just like noed
---
Yeah, so they cant blind my bald spot, but I can still be blinded from about 70 degree or so
---
Some people think otherwise
---
F for the killer
---
Ok... OP what did you want them to do? Just leave and let you get rescued like he did he was in the area for about 30 seconds. Im trying to get your point?
---
you are probrobly TPing downstairs because you naturally keep looking downwards.  just keep your chin up and you'll be fine.
---
I like making my own, and I have a few, so I am biased af.   
---
That said, I love fan chapters. Anything that gets the creativity going in a community, in my opinion, is a good thing.   
---
I would love to share some of mine but im kinda worried about the negative feedback, but reading into fan ideas is really fun for me
---
Doctor Op? Wtf lol What rank is this? Point these people out to me.
---
Notable perks: 
---
* BBQ and Chili. An absolute must on every killer due in part to the 100% bonus bloodpoints it provides *every* game. Leatherface teachable. 
---
* Ruin. It'll slow down Gen progression early on, and if the Totem lasts till end game, things get ugly. Hag teachable. 
---
* No one escapes death. Lets you one-hit people for a short time after the gens are completed. 
---
* Enduring. Stuns are reduced by 75%
---
There are many great and interesting killer perks, but these will fit on basically anyone. Other perks that're noteworthy are **Nurse's Calling, Frankling's Demise, Hex: Devour Hope, Overcharge, Distressing + Unnerving Presence, Hex: Haunted Ground, Spirit Fury, Blood Warden.**
---
Happy inside
---
yup, its on a 30 sec timer. very few people realize that.
---
Gosh, it's so satisfying when you get hate mail. I don't even respond half the time.
---
That's fine. But what would anyone playing killer do in this persons situation; Go toward some anus that continually hops through windows on the other side of the map?
---
My p3 Billy says otherwise
---
honestly it's the same as huntress on pc. it's not just aim, you need to learn to predict movement as well. get in the survivors mind
---
Turn the chat off to avoid the toxic people. Though you’ll lose out on the rare pleasant conversations you can have. I’m on PS4 and had to disable messages just because of this game cause survivors would message me threats and insults.
---
No we would, because people hear the chainsaw, and know its not billy but for some fucking up reason go near the basement instead of doing gens.... I literally can't explain it... but its like go in basement with Bubba = people going down the stairs to rescue like moths to a flame...
---
That's what I thought like what do you think I would just leave a position where I have the upper hand hell no I wpuldnt.
---
*tombstone* ha. Ha. Ha-ha. HaHa! Ahahaha! **AH-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!**
---
Petty much?
---
I ready up immediately. Fuck their items, fuck your imaginary rules about when to equip things, and fuck killers who dodge.
---
It’s a game. Take the damned match you get. If you go down in rank, it’s because you were erroneously too high.
---
That goes for survivors too.
---
Was a few months ago I was at tank 3 I think was playing in the car junkyard map
---
Always aim higher
---
Don't know why you'd get mad at this point. You know killers have exten-do arms that enable them to hit you from 10ft away.
---
Well it helps so then if they complete gens they get a consequence so duh

If you're within her terror radius you can't hear it.
---
Looks like their game... is over.
---
Oink.
---
Try catching them at pallets and vaults when they can’t dodge you. If you’re just throwing them in the open you have to have a good deal of experience reading them or have an on point shot every time. I also use it a lot as my 2nd hit, so I’ll bait the throw when they’re close, hit them with my main weapon then when they’re in their panic taking off get the double tap with the hatchet. Takes good timing though to make it smooth or else they can waste a lot of your time.
---
The sickness made her real skinny
---
If just one extra hit isn’t worth much, then Adrenaline, Dead Hard and expose effects wouldn’t be meta. The majority of M1 killers don’t have anything to help in chases so the extra hit means even more. Pallet looping is the most powerful tool in a survivor’s arsenal and being able to keep it going for +50% longer is unarguably game changing
---
MoM doesn’t need a nerf, I would just like to see a change. It’s specifically targeting weak killers which is a flawed design imo
---
&gt; Nerf Adrenaline, Nerf MoM. Like when will it end? 
---
With all due respect, survivors also bitch about killer perks that are fine too. Nurse’s Calling, NOED, Ruin. No side of the community will ever be completely happy but it’s not just one side complaining and forcing nerfs on the other
---
My favorites are the ones who visibly swarm the hook like flies on shit, then expect you to go on vacation.
---
Play as killer. Nobody likes survivor mains.
---
Honestly if you play it smart, the game is the most balanced it's been in a longggg time. I legitimately can't tell you right off the bat who has the advantage, it's pretty dependent on player skill.
---
You’re supposed to file an actual report too
---
Was nightmare actually good when he released
---
Exactly
---
Lmfaoo please please tell me where I can get this video to download
---
and again, Nurse is unarguably strongest killer there is. by playing dirty and making it easier, you won't become a god tier Nurse. if you want to play like this trash, can pick any other killer and still get same results. i understand what you're saying but my view on a human being who is not trying to be better than they are is as if they're animals. humans have brains and huge potential. if they don't open it up, i will judge that because it's against our nature to be in stagnation. 
---
yeah, i get it, it's a game. but if you're doing your best in literally everything, perfecting every aspect of your life, no matter what you do - you are a human and you're becoming a better person cause that would be willpower.
---
Respect
---
Funny, a Tapp did that to me and suddenly thought he was noob3. He soon learned the error of his ways. 
---
#Bubba4Ever
---
Imma be honest, don't know why it took me so long to take this into thought. I love seeing salt in chat but sometimes it can get irritating, but I think I'm just gonna ignore it for now on. Thanks man.
---
Michael the dad
---
I would love that!
---
it’s 1% to 1% up to 50% wiggle bar. 
---
say you got 34% recovery, your wiggle bar would start at 34%. 
---
say you got up to 80% recovery, your wiggle bar would start at 50%
---
Would be cool to have two killers on comms, trying to catch a particularly effective looper together. Of course then it would be even more punishing with extra survivors to do gens...unless they all jump in to bodyblock for their friend like rats. Utter chaos, I love it
---
Id love that as well! The lore really was was got me into DBD
---
DON'T FORGET ABOUT US. 
---
TRAPPERS. WRAITHS. HILLBILLIES. NURSES. SHAPES. HUNTRESSES. DOCTORS. PIGS. NIGHTMARES. HAGS. CANNIBALS. CLOWNS. LEGIONS. PLAGUES.
---
#LET'S GET OUT THERE AND SHOW THEM WE MEAN BUSINESS!!!!
---
I don’t get it....the plague is suppose to be the oldest killer so far...new school?
---
That’s not how it works... it’s if your OUTSIDE her terror radius. There’s a reason why prayer beads existed, they would be useless if this was actually true. You hear it. You actually do hear it.
---
I ask because i have tier 3. And even when i recover 50% its is below 50% wiggle
---
I feel you, Lee was a legend. But it true that Lee is dead, Clem isn’t so it would make more sense. But I like the idea of a perk called Still Not Bitten
---
rofllllll
---
Pretty sure Trapper should be the old school one, seeing as how he was even the first killer out in the beta
---
If we're being honest, it took me almost a year of play time to realize and then develop this mind set.
---
I've bent over backwards trying to make survivors happy and there's literally no end to their complaints. So screw em, I'm playing a game I paid for, if they want me to play for them they can buy me the next DLC lol
---
Lol I find this clip hilarious because I think she thought the animation was the same for finding an empty locker and getting a hatchet
---
What am I supposed to use? Deerstalker?
---
Hahaha!
---
At least Leader is there . - .
---
im sorry pal, but just cause you got unhooked doesn't mean you become some immortal god. your exactly the same. i will hit you, then go after the other guy, if you deliverance, if you think that's tunnelling, well maybe you should've tried a better time then when im walking away from the hook to patrol gens. If you 4% read above.
---
point A was just pointing out that tunnelling is how a killer SHOULD play if they want to win it's the killer equivalent to "the gen rush"(focusing solely on doing gens &amp; nothing else). I'm not saying i support it. for B, it was that going after an injured surv when i have the option to, they're my top priority(this is not immediately after unhook). I'm not going to do a full chase when i can just down &amp; hook someone instantly.
---
Despite what you may think, i don't tunnel. I will go out of my way to down the rescuer first, if i can(playing billy, clown or using devour hope) if not, your getting hit, then im going after the rescuer to save me time.
---
I know how petty correcting grammar is, but I can't help but get caught on the irony of it existing in a critical comment.
---
SWF groups make for both the best and worst people in this community. A very...curious species
---
This is happening in survivor with friends.
---
the original author is pathesis on tumblr!
---
They should add a special "OOF" sound when this happens.
---
Then it would just be Rancor without the mori and a waste of a perk slot
---
I’m a sucker for that kinda stuff so 👍
---
I'll have you know that claudette do 70% of all flashlight saves in the game, he is doing a great justice
---
Also, you might be able to keep the item if you can escape. I think it's a great build- and one I'll aim for in the future. But I would swap out pharmacy for Plunder's Instinct, because I'd want more than just med kits. 
---
Somebody brought in 2 luck perks, Ace in the Hole, and Plunderers. Then they brought in the White Ward offering. So they ended getting a really good item, and if they die, they keep it. Next level strats.
---
r/foundthefurry
---
I rarely play survivor because I prefer killer. Although I know how to play survivor I prefer not to play it which keeps me at rank 20 after the resets.

#BODY ONCE TOLD ME
---
same as normal
---
Well you can run an object like a toolbox to help compensate for slowly healing your self, get more work done
---
I didn't come here to be attacked
---
She’s talking about bad ping
---
I know, but he just kills performance on my PS4.
---
#I AIN'T THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED
---
Yeah lmao that's 100% camping
---
I kinda wonder, would she still have got in since it closed the very second she jumped?
---
Yeah, been playing since Closed Beta and I wish I developed this mindset earlier, the community is toxic, it only seems to be getting worse and BHVR doesn't seem like they will do anything like F13: The Game's Salt Mine anytime soon so I guess I really just need to ignore it, it will help out in the long run. Plus i gotta disable public comments, I keep it on for the once on a blue moon nice survs, today I had my first in 6 months, to leave comments after we have a mutually fun match, but that's too rare to keep on. TL;DR gonna ignore and prevent toxicity, cuz only good can really come from it.
---
Wait, has that actually happened before?!
---
I usually have my sensitivity high when playing bit when I play as the huntress I set it to about 25. It helps me not twitch right when I'm about to throw. After a few rounds I will slowly raise it.
---
yeah thing is... if hes gonna insidious, and i've done it and laughed by backside off... its obvious AF.... they should just do gens and be down 1...
---
bold of you to assume they're female
---
how did you even get that to happen tho
---
It's interesting, but on its own, it feels too powerful. Maybe add one requirement which is that you must be in the injured state as well to reap the benefits. This balances it out and thematically fits, as you truly are in a dangerous spot.
---
Agreed
---
Make it like ruin 2/3/4
---
No one escapes death... no one escapes the sub...
---
How the hell do you hit that dash consistently?
---
Now we just need the almighty robot policeman
---
huh?
---
Damn anti-vaxxer survivors, spreading their illness!
---
Mhhh yeah i am the 420th upvote
---
Oh nothing, just a hunch UwU
---
Btw legión doesn't suck at all
---
1. No, it's not camping to go after autists hook diving before you walk away;
---
2. No, you shouldn't listen to salty survivors, they don't ever know what they're talking about;
---
3. No, you shouldn't make posts like this seeking validation, because even if this is something you're genuinely uncertain of (i.e. wanting a genuine answer rather than waiting for someone to tell you what you want to hear), it's not going to be received that way.
---
Pretty sure this is a parody of a shitty meme where mw2 was considered an ancient gamer.
---
Makes more sense lol
---
Noed is literally in the game so that people take totems into consideration, and it's intended that you use your time to find them and get rid of them or risk a bad outcome.
---
The people who complain about noed most are those that rush 5 gens, then proclaim that the killer didn't **deserve** ANY kills because they rushed the gens and that means they are entitled to a free 4 man escape.
---
End game is still part of the game, if you're not going to account for perks that come into play then, blame yourself.
---
you call yourself a legion fan yet you play such shallow music 
---
[*BEHOLD TRUE MUSIC*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AguPH0XBxdw)
---
I'm pretty sure if you're within her terror radius you don't hear the whooshing sound (only when you're outside of her terror radius is when you hear the sound). That's something they added to her either after the ptb or a patch afterwards. Prayer beads completely silences the whooshing sound.
---
The best part was the nodding.
---
Just keep at it.  I thought I was being hindered on XBone but it was just a learning curve.  It might take a while but it’ll be a blast when you get it.
---
I think if survivors just left when the last generator was done, noed wouldnt matter. Everytime i play a killer that runs it, i just leave. It eliminates your ability to be cocky when youve already won. Also, sometimes survivors are just really efficient. I dont care how good you are as killer, it takes time to get around the map and 3 gens can be done in 90- 120 seconds if you dont accurately guess where theyre at. Noed sucks to get killed by, but its manageable to work around.
---
I can't stop thinking about scratch marks every time I see someone running lol
---
Jebaited
---
I’ve been meeting loads when I was a baby nurse. Nowadays I’m good at getting hits but rarely downing people
---
You can usually select if you want to play with other platforms or not.
---
It has been slow queues on PS4 as survivor lately for me as well. This may be my imagination but if I don’t get a match in like 2-3 mins, I re-ready and it probably works 50/50.
---
Same problem.
---
Yay!
---
Let me guess. PS4? Sounds about fucking right.
---
Awesome :)
---
Heck yes!
---
I do this too. I feel like it works, but no concrete proof
---
I've heard that was proved to not be the case.
---
I smell thirsty fangirls e -e
---
I prefer Lithe to Balanced personally. Just so many more places to use it at.
---
Its absolutely stupid, theres no point to queue survivor it seems
---
I thought I was alone, there seem to be a lot of campers tonight so I guess just bad time to play. 
---
I got facecamped by a Spirit just now and right before that, a Pig. She crouched and all but luckily I had Kindred. The whole team came to help and got me in the nick of time. Oh, and she had Devour Hope. Like, what’s going on? 😂
---
r/kidsarefuckingstupid
---
Ps4 cant change names at will. Pc 100%
---
I think so?
---
Shit bad ping?  It's more likely they're talking about having low BP before they're hooked/downed/whatever their threshold is.
---
Delet this nephew
---
Not the same as party streamers at all. I know that the addons are rare and expensive there are equivelants on the survivor side. Killers can be just as toxic with dc's and I see quite a lot of them. For instance running franklins, making the survivor drop the item and dcing. Or dcing because of an instaheal. It works both ways around is all I'm trying to say
---
Except they have Mettle of Man so they don't actually go down when you kill them.
---
It was a good two weeks.
---
I've been having the same problem tonight too. I feel it's been so much worse since the changes to the ranking system. I'm constantly being face camped, unhooked in front of the killer etc. I also had a Spirit tonight who messaged me that they wanted to farm and then just killed everyone. I either need to find people to play with or switch over to killer.
---
I love this so much
---
Everyone on our moderation team is a volunteer to this subreddit and have a life outside of our moderation duties. Depending on who is available when, things can slip through the cracks. The best I can suggest is to report the post breaking rules, not join them.
---
Yep. That’s all the games I’ve had recently too. Haven’t had a really good game in months and I’m a daily player. I play at least 10-15 games a day.
---
Not really. Discussing NOED is a shitshow from both sides all the time. Downvotes are just unlucky timing. Tomorrow he could make the same comment and get 50+ upvotes.
---
Yeah this game is getting tough to play lately and hard for the survivors but I still try and no matter what I never DC. That’s really becoming a huge problem more so than about anything else!!!
---
I didn't face a single camper tonight but okay. You're just mad you lost
---
Every claudette should automatically do this in order to accommodate for her invisibility
---
There are but obviously he camped so it doesnt matter.
---
Hard to tell without seeing the match.  I'm leaning towards over altruism and poor save attempts but this could also have been proxycamping.  Really would have had to seen it to see how you played it.
---
It's one of the reasons I use STBFL on my Spirit. My cooldown is faster than their ability to move and sometimes I get pick ups at the gates.
---
I just don’t understand how it got this bad. A year ago this game was insanely fun on PS4. Now? Jesus Christ I makes me want to claw my own eyes out.
---
Everything!
---
Which meme is this based on?
---
At the least I refuse to DC. Let me take my 3k-10k bp. Good fuckin luck to the rest of the survivors. But I won’t dc.
---
Absolutely agree. A 4 kill with BAAARELY pipping or not pipping at all is soul crushing
---
[This meme from iCarly.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kr9VvK6cOp4/maxresdefault.jpg) Don't mind the absolutely terrible joke, it was the first thing that popped up on Google.
---
There's no such thing as an infinite anymore.  They've all been worked out of the game with the rework to window spawns as well as the addition of debris and obstacles to lengthen the loop surrounding the buildings.
---
Welp, that makes two of us! Haha
---
I will literally play with you if you’re ps4. And yes it has gotten much worse since new ranking system. Funny thing is they can’t pip playing that way either. So there literally no reason for it other than to be a jerk, and that really seems like what all of them are doing now.
---
Oh, so because I don't want to play with that 700+ ping Survivor playing from Mars' McDonald I'm wasting everyone's time? 
---
Good to know; next time I'll just ready up and have fun in the infinite loading screen, three-man game, or exciting chase where the Survivor teleport-walks faster than I can run. ^(/s)
---
“I didn’t have the same experience so you must be a liar and a crybaby. No one can have different experiences than me or bad days, lol what. Lol you mad.”
---
I love the logic of “I didn’t see it so it didn’t happen.” 
---
Yeah ok. You sound like one of the dbags I’ve been getting all night. Gtfo. Also the flair literally says salt.
---
Same, I play more than that. I took a few months break because it was like this when Legion came out. (Also the bugs and servers being so broken) came back and it was ok for a few weeks. And now it’s this again.
---
I use to hang around rank 8-9 after this last patch and what they did to matchmaking I depipped myself to 15 just so I could get games and not have to wait in 20 minute queues.
---
I know that, but there’s a lot of meme psn names on DBD lol. You would be surprised.
---
I enjoy: Tru3, Puppers, Hybridpanda and Streamdad_ (a lot of people just ignore him but i love his wholesomeness). 
---
Monto is also great but not a steamer.
---
I got zero last year, never posted it though, 0 or  1
---
It favors whichever side I’m not currently playing.
---
This one's my favorite.
---
Well no matter how many injuries at least he won't kill anyone
---
Solo surviving on console is fucking brutal I’ve got to the point if I know the people I’m playing with are fucking morons I’ll try to die asap. Last night I had two shirtless no mither David’s run up to unhook someone 5 second after they were hooked and both got downed. This also managed to happen in the first 2 minutes of the game. And the killer was just kinda standing around not sure to hook em or leave em slugged  so I ran straight up to a hook by the killer and t bagged till he hung me up.
---
That's the dumbest part! The killer isn't getting a pip....I can't imagine it's fun to sit there and stare at me on the hook the whole game either. So why do they play like that? I'll message you my gamer tag. I'm usually on late though. Sometimes I don't get on until 1 AM EST. If you play late that would be awesome. I play very altruistically and will definitely die saving my teammates as long as they aren't hook farming assholes. Haha
---
&gt; It eliminates your ability to be cocky when youve already won. 
---
Yup, this is exactly it. Survivors not playing around this is what turns 1 noed kill into 3 noed kills.
---
You know what- perhaps you're right.
---
True for a lot of things on reddit lol
---
For serious, if I could rework hatch, I'd remove grabs, add hatch closing, (you can't jump in a closing hatch). Would be a real race/last chance, not a free escape. A few other things for balance but you get the idea.
---
&gt; You sound like one of the dbags I’ve been getting all night.
---
I don't even use Ruin let alone play like that but yeah bro I'm totally a camper and tunneler despite me writing constantly about why tunneling is a big issue
---
lmfao
---
Think Wraith rang his own bell without using either hand
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
I'm going to have to at this point. It's unbelievably frustrating to have teammates that hook farm you or spend the whole game sitting in a locker. It's annoying giving the killer what's essentially free kills when working together would result in everyone escaping.
---
I’m in the same boat as you surviving is getting fucking brutal to play. And killer isn’t really fun after you’ve played this game for a month or 2. Also at yellow and green ranks killing is so fucking easy it’s boring as hell
---
i'm a survivor main, so my advice may not be the best, but maybe try focusing on downing players rather than hooking them right away. the downing mechanic is criminally underused in this game, but it can be powerful not only to 1. waste survivor's unbreakable perks if they have them 2. slow the game, even for a little while, and 3. lure other survivors to your position. obviously still hook when you have to, but the game is much easier as the killer when you have three downed survivors and one hooked. even if they do manage a self-res, you know their last known posistion and they will now be making pain sounds.
---
the only other advice i can give is DO NOT CAMP! the new update made it so you get much less (maybe even negative?) bloodpoints for downing/hitting another survivor in proximity of a hooked survivor.
---
sorry if this doesn't help! i'm killer rank 19 because i only play when i have to for dailys, but as a survivor i can tell you that killers who down (especially those with one-hit downs like hillbilly/cannibal or even the pig with rbt's) are much harder to go up against than killers who hook instantly and move away to go searching.
---
Should probably be blackpip on 2 kills considering that's like, a split even tie, that means you're killing at the right rank and there's no need to rank up.
---
I hear ya there and figure not only get the points but have respect by not DC! I hear a lot of it has to do with people streaming
---
I camp at Rank 1 and and still 4k. You gotta know exactly HOW to camp. You gotta know when to call someone's bluff and sit at the hooked survivor, or when to "leave" and come back to fuck them up.
---
Easy answer, Inflated egos
---
I’m rank 10 and get tunneled every other game. It’s fucking bullshit
---
[removed]
---
So deerstalker is a must now?
---
A majority of the randoms just urban evasion in tall grass, hook farm, and refuse to do gens. It’s a nightmare. I can’t count how many times everyone would have escaped if they just did at least one gen instead of wait around for the hatch.
---
I hear you; the game is definitely changing for the worse on console.
---
Even as recent as this December I would still regularly match with Killers who played normally and even some who would play 'nice' (give Hatch to the last Survivor, farm if 2 people DC'ed, avoid someone after they were unhooked, etc.). 
---
Whatever happened, it happened recently and pretty suddenly (I'm partial to blaming the changes to ranking up, but I can't prove that).
---
I like him. I really enjoy his videos.
---
I’m a pretty good team player. I’ll usually stick my neck out if I think I can save more people. My goal is to get as many people out as possible. I acknowledge that I’m not going to survive every game. But it would be nice to have at least at semi sentient teammates. I’m on randomly but frequently around that time. No worries.
---
Was talking about the asshole teammates who sandbag and troll. But ok “lmfao”
---
Are you sure?
---
I looked it up real quick and I couldn’t find this drawing.
---
Although I guess it could have just been removed by the adult ban or just deleted by the author for whatever reason.
---
Legion would be the youngest age/time wise.
---
Rin in the middle
---
and Adiris is literally ancient unlike any other killer
---
Yes the comparison was the shitty attitude I’ve been seeing from other players.
---
Agreed.
---
Hello, FBI? Yes, this comment right here!
---
What a fun way to play.
---
I envy the lack of post game chat on console sometimes .-.
---
I should make that
---
Did you forget to form a sentence or am I missing something?
---
All terrible lol
---
How do you switch to survivor/killer in a KYF lobby? I can’t figure out.
---
Then maybe there has to be conditions first and not just be able to use it every time. Maybe it can only work once per match just like how DS only works once per match
---
I only do it out of spite for when it's a jackass SWF bullysquad I've encountered before. 
---
I'm just saying it can work.
---
Why does everyone hate Claudette? I just want to understand what everyone else thinks so I can be a better part of this sub
---
XD
---
DS takes up an entire perk slot and you can hard counter it by running enduring. I play both killer and survivor and i do quite well against survivors running “OP” perks when i use some variation of ruin/bbq/spirit fury/enduring(or bamboozled, thanatophobia). You gotta stop complaining because the above perks are even stronger than DS. 
---
Simple solution: ignore the unhooked survivor so DS wont get activated.
---
I don't tunnel but I'm accused of it sometimes. Reason being is I always run Nurse's Calling. Like I get that it sucks that you couldn't heal yourself but at the same time I'm not going to just ignore my Nurse's Calling aura. If I can't find anyone else at the time and see the aura, of course I'm going for you. I will go after the other person if possible, but sometimes it isn't.
---
Love it!
---
seems like a decent idea tbh. would work great with stake out/prove Thyself. would make a dumbass perk have a real use, if only BHVR did this
---
Ah, yes I see it. Thank you! :D
---
I feel like it hasn't been done because of the incredible amount of bugs and balance issues it would have. Like I could go on for a while so lets just use the concept of doubling everything and ignore potential balance issues/interactions killers would have. Simply put double the killers means 2 survivors can be chased at once but now there can be 6 survivors doing generators at once. I don't believe it is possible for 2 killer to maintain pressure against the manpower 6 survivors can have even if only 4 are pumping out gens. Also as an aside there would need to be 6 generators that need to be done when 1 more needs to be powered to open the exit otherwise the ability to stall out the game as killer is incredibly easy.
---
Boohoo. Nurse not triggering MoM is a confirmed bug and one extra hit being that upsetting is hilarious. Killers got quite a few perks to one shot survivors but that’s always forgotten, huh
---
5 minutes in lobby, 5 minutes in infinite load screen, cut to score screen with all addons and offerings burned and 2500BP for my trouble.
---
BHVR: FIX YOUR SHIT
---
1. If a game doesnt last more than a minute DONT BURN OFFERINGS OR ADDONS.
---
2. If the game starts with people DCed DONT BURN OFFERINGS OR ADDONS
---
Seriously ruins a play session when you burn bps/cake/pudding/etc. just for this shit to happen.
---

Sigh. I’m not gonna tell you what I mean. Lol I hate you.

There are also videos on Youtube if you wanted to see how it worked.
---
Are you the only one who sees it? Or do others see it to?
---
Sad thing is I know that, but then I panic when it was opened with a key like ITS GONNA CLOSE but I’m the last survivor...
---
It’s actually really nice to know I’m not the only one on PS4 that does shit like that.
---
I'm aware, but I'd rather buy it to support the developer is what I'm saying.
---
Three!
---
I did the same thing
---
I wouldn't say he's OP. I know he's annoying for survivors though so I'll use him in swf teams that I recognize that I know are toxic. Other than that I don't get a whole lot of satisfaction out of playing him because I know he can be difficult to counter.
---
Which would be stupid. DCing is evenless BP than dying too early
---
4 games in a row today, all Claudette’s.
---
The issue is less ghat he is op, bit more that his power offers absolutely 0 counterplay. He is just running yoi down stabs you, recharges his power and can that untill you go down and there nothing you can so about it.
---
It's Minute Maid apple juice. https://imgur.com/a/SzMXavf
---
This is a really dumb question but I am curious: Does having everyone in a lobby "ready up" before there are four survivors cause a higher wait time for the 4th survivor to join a lobby?
---
Probably because Legion can slide over pallets in frenzy mode and tunnel the shit out of survivors.
---
I agree with you though, I don’t see them as OP, just kind of boring to play against.
---
you‘re being an absolute antimate
---
in all fairness, the back of the game box has a picture of a wraith(?) camping, so that doesn't entirely help the newer players lol. dunno why, but I never camped when I started playing killer. as if it was some sort of instinct lmao.
---
She started the animation, so most likely.
---
You’re most likely mentally and physically inferior to the little girl in the video. Lol
---
Its not OP (except if they use mixtape) but its really boring and has no counter
---
Like NOED
---
100%
---
Oh boy and we're back to "But killers have NoED so this extra life is fine!"
---
I like people like you
---
He isn't op at all he's actually quite weak.  He's just irritating because if he decides to tunnel you, there is exceedingly little counterplay to that.  You're basically on a timer due to Frenzy hits though you can waste a lot of his time before he gets that down on you.  The only time he ever feels OP is when they run Franks Mix Tape which does feel kind of gross.  That or if they have the balls to exploit their downs by moonwalking.  If they pull that shit I'm out, though very few Legions I face exploit the chase mechanic.  They usually play it straight against me.
---
I hate myself when I'm doingt that xD
---
The post game chat is instead people sending hate messages directly to ya.
---
I mean real talk survivors dont NEED any perks. 
---
Ill admit im running new DS and BT a lot given how many campers there are but I feel much more free to swap up my survivor build than I do my killer builds. The only perk I pretty much always run is adrenaline but I dont need to run it it just feels nice
---
Main issue is so many survivor perks are useless
---
Its happened 5 times someone has commented "-rep face camper" on my steam profile but I've only done it twice against some annoying fuckers that i just wanted to kill even if it meant loss. This game is HELLA toxic and salty.
---
Relatable. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
---
Yeah I mean I'm right there at 8 currently and I'm not getting camped with nearly as much frequency.  You're not including end of game open exit gate camps in that figure are you because I typically exclude that from camp counts.  They kind of get a pass on those given the circumstances.  I never BM or anything unless they play like filth so typically I don't give them a reason to camp me.
---
Now this is respectable. No matter how bad a game is going, there is nothing worse than a survivor or killer who DCs. If anything, just kill yourself on first hook as survivor.
---
Real talk as solo survivor I expect to die on my first hook, anything else is a bonus, you cant rely on any teamates or the killer to play normal
---
I said a few but yes noed being one of them and all of them counter MoM if they aren’t in the injured state.
---
Lol exactoy. If he wanted to out there is nothing the killer could have done to stop it.
---
No one actually plays the game, the game is 100% DC.
---
This meme was made by the unrelenting gang
---
What about the broken record of mettle of man becoming an even more ridiculous version of old DS
---
How would this work with Decisive Strike, since it changes the Obsession during the match? If everyone ran both, it could potentially disable all of the Killer's perks if it activated on switch.
---
Prolly dropped down from the top of the staircase.
---
It's on game start, sorry.
---
I don't mind, if they're being rude about it (mass swearing,  hate speech,  kys threats) I just report then to Sony and laugh when they get communication banned
---
Yep, this was a normal match. Just randomly had me as Plague and someone else as Legion. Was pretty fun, though.
---
It's because of two things:
---
1. It counters Mettle of Man. If you camp someone until they reach struggle phase, then tunnel them off the hook, MoM never procs.
---
2. Are you stuck at mid-ranks when you would normally reach red ranks? If so, you're going up against less confident Killers.
---
Wasn't this posted like yesterday without the DC icon?
---
I often won’t even do that. I only do it to jerk teammates
---
It’s not even exit gate camping, the killer will just find me and after they catch me after I loop them for a bit they will facecamp and tunnel me. I don’t Teabag or do anything toxic. Even using decisive when they tunnel hasn’t helped because they just go after me anyway.
---
I don't mind either I play to have fun and find it funny when I get the messages and report afterwards always just I know some wouldn't enjoy to get messages after almost every game.
---
you feeling a little bit TOO proud for someone who just managed to get a 1k buddy.
---
I do, I use it whenever the killer is close to me while I am on the hook.
---
Tell me how do you prestige as killer?
---
Every time I play dbd my bro thinks I am having a seizure.
---
he doesn't even need to snap his fingers, all he needs to do is exist for others to not exist
---
Sad Facts. And then when killers we a SWF join their lobby they dc. Siiigh.
---
Yeah, the first day the Plague came out I got it for her and Billy. Got ganked out of my Freddy and Leatherface though.
---
*when you watermark your memes*
---
Nah, sometimes lobbies get f*cked and stuck at 3 survivors and sit forever till everyone leaves. But nah, having all 3 ready before a fourth has joined doesn’t increase wait time
---

Lightborn&gt;Franklin’s demise
---
NoED: Only does anything in the endgame, and only if they were dumb enough to heal. Does nothing to stop you from getting to the endgame, does nothing if they were already injured,
---
Make Your Choice: In order to get the one-shot off on one guy, you need to have somebody else downed, and that will usually mean hitting them twice, giving them two stacks.
---
Rancor: Same as NoED, but it gives warning and only affects **one** of the potential **four** people who could have Mettle.
---
Devour Hope: never lasts to three unhooks, and requires you to give out a potential six stacks of Mettle before you get the exposed effect.
---
Iron Maiden: Yup this perk is totally OP it can down the Mettle user in one hit for all three of their downs it's honestly a hard counter and I can't believe nobody is running this.
---
Yupp, it does
---
The devs were talking about implementing a way for luck to affect chest searches in future updates.
---
Still nice concept.
---
Drifter.
---
As a killer main who uses totem perks a lot, this should make me sad, but screw NOED, I wish what happened in this video up on every NOED user
---
Where did I say anyone *needed* those perks?
---
I said "What else are they supposed to run?".  If the Killer brings their A-game, they have options. If a Survivor brings their A-game (If they need to or not at high ranks) they have the one build. 
---
I'd rather not run Mettle of Man, Decisive Strike, or Adrenaline. I'd rather run the No-Mither combo and knock out Gens. It's just flat out not worth it to do so.
---
I'd rather not run Mettle of Man, Decisive Strike, or Adrenaline. I'd rather run Dance with Me, Lithe, Distortion, and Quick and Quiet. It doesn't last long enough to actually get away from the Killer.
---
I'd rather run a multitude of other perks that would do wonders for the game and actually let me do the types of things in the game that I want to do as a Survivor, but those perks are pretty much entirely worthless by comparison.
---
Play killer for a week.
---
Killers do it as part of mindgaming. Because your red stain always comes from the direction you’re looking, people can assume when the light comes from an area specifically, you’re walking that direction. By hiding that light or walking from one area and around you can make survivors either guess incorrectly about where you actually are or intend to go and get hits in. 
---
In short, yes. Anyone playing Killer can benefit from moonwalking to mindgame survivors. Except Nurse. She doesn’t care about hiding her red stain cause she’s just gonna yeet through the walls. 
---
Also this is more effective on killers who can’t use their power to deal direct damage/create an opening for hits as well.
---
i enjoy doing this to people
---
Spirit face camps? 
---
No dignity
---
It's a very fun perk if you get 4 tokens. Especially if you do a slug build.
---
It's a bit like devour hope, it's very good or very bad.
---
Coming through my mind
---
Hating Claudette is a meme because she’s shorter than most other survivors so she is naturally harder to see, has cosmetics that are very similar in color to most male like Corn fields and Bamboo and grass plus her iconic perk Self Care is what most new players unlock and hold onto forever. 
---
Wether you’re an “immersed baby Claudette” self caring in the corner of the map because the idea of a terror radius makes you cry or a P3 Claudette doing a Solid Snake cosplay against the Brick Walls Of Coal Tower, Claudette is just a meme.
---
The resemblance is uncanny!
---
How could you think this was hitbox lul?
---
They are! Its just a meme about the fog offerings . u cant see or something so go to specsavers
---
So, my first killer quest was "kill someone by your own hand". First time playing killer EVER. I look online and see Moris as a thing, but since I didn't have one I figured I could kill them by letting them bleed out.
---
So I downed a guy and camped the slug thinking that I would finish my quest and get that sweet fat stack of 60k BPs. :(
---
The devs say a lot of things 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b9uofz/pretty_good_job_so_far/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
It's less that they "don't have anything else", but rather because they're so versatile and universally powerful that you're actively lowering your chances of escaping by not using them. 
---
They definitely need a nerf, or be made far more situational and limited than they are.
---
i kind of switched to survivor for a bit too cause as rank 1 killer can't get lobbies. but i still don't understand the amount of complaints. they flame and bully killers, i stand up for my brothers in Entity. they call a baby Hag with one perk of tier 1 and no add-ons a filthy camper on a long McMillan map as if she had a choice apart from keeping one side trapped. they say Bubba is disgusting for bit of patrolling when 3 gens are done. they bitch about honest fair killers, i felt it as killer, i see that as survivor. 
---
at one point right now when i manage to get a killer lobby feels like i've lost it but actually it's the fact that sounds are trash, scratch marks fucked(they appear 0.5 seconds after survivor ran apart from being really hard to read), gens pop much faster than after recent midchapter, maps got so many bumps on objects, you get stuck everywhere with your big boi killer hitbox, etc. and honestly, even i felt like camping at some point. cause it's literally impossible, i fully understand why killers camp and tunnel. wish survivors would have tried playing high rank killers that are not Nurse and Billy.
---
Come on, after creating Legion the survivors needed a 'win'. The killers can't get all the good perks.
---
General Build
---
Bond
---
Balanced Landing
---
Spine Chill
---
Urban Evasion/Prove Thyself/WGLF/Deliverance/Adrenaline
---
Honestly anything can fit in the 4th slot its up to you, these are my recommendations tho.
---
Perks to avoid: Self Care, its a waste of time in SWF, bond already got your healing covered. Decisive Strike, unless youre a low rank, this perk will not even get used.
---
Anybody want to recommend positive, likable Twitch streamers to me? All the top ones seem to be toxic POSs and proud of it. Puppers is the only high popularity streamer I've seen so far that's not running around calling killers "so bayd" after spending all match shouting "gotcha betch," spamming flashlight clicks, and t-bagging (very representative choices for Fog Whisperers, Behavior, well done).
---
If it’s a dlc pack get pig because you can get spirit for free with iridescent shards
---
As much as I want them to fix something currently I don't think they can deal with their biggest problems like DCs for example
---
i also call survivors ugly sluts while my nose graces my tv screen
---
It's a knife I swear! No,don't leave, please!
---
They don't stop *looping*
---
Everyone should run bond, not just Dwight mains - I swapped it with self care when healing got nerfed and it’s now my favourite perk
---
Lol what a cunt. Why would they have the nerve to tell everyone they're a farmer?! This shit is messed up.
---
I agree. For example there are so many healing perks currently. I bet the next survivor will have something in the lines - when u do a gen you heal automaticaly at 50%. Is just so many variations that are just useless. New DS is great ! BT is cool vs campers and MoM - the only reason I haven't bought it is because I don't want to support this obvious "lets trow 2 garbage + super strong perk so we can sell our DLC" sellout
---
If all you’ve got here is the grammar argument, then I think nothing more needs to be said here.
---
You won’t depip from a killer dc.  
---
At the end screen, yes, but in the main menu you will have your pip back.
---
What rank are you?
---
I get camped sometimes but def not the majority of the time. I'm rank 12.
---
Had a weird game tonight where a camper messaged me after to say sorry that they were demonstrating to their friend how overpowered killers are. I was like ...
---
The depip squad argument is beyond dumb, sure 4 guys with thousands of hours each are going to beat most killers thats expected. Just as most killer streamers 4k 5gen most games
---
Imo boil over would be extremely awful for the killers. It would be so much rage inducing
---
This is why I just say fuck it and run Basement Bubba. If I'm gonna get flamed anyway, might as well have fun during the match and *revel* in *earned* salt.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
People are downvoting you because you’re taking a shitpost seriously.
---
Assuming it was a 3 gen doc, sure as hell ain’t balanced with the right build. On certain maps doc can actually hold the game hostage with good gen spawns.
---
Yeah totally...my mistake...
---
Literally ANY punishment for DCing. As it is you lose pips (which are meaningless) and the bloodpoints for that match. If it's the start of a match and a shit survivor goes down, there's no real bloodpoints lost anyway.
---
Like pretty much every other multiplayer game out there, have a stacking ban, 10 mins for clicking DC, 30 for doing it again within 24 hours, then a 24 hour ban.
---
So far they only did a ban "wave" of everyone with a high DC rate, but having no immediate consequence means people have no reason not to do it.

Can you PM me? I'm starting to build my own list and have been using them to avoid scummy killers.
---
Alternatively: "Reddit survivors want to continue bitching on reddit, so they'll continue running the same cookie cutter straight survivability build instead of a number of other viable health-irrelevant perks that counter things that survivors often bitch about. Including: Distortion countering BBQ/Nurse's, Kindred rendering camping useless by letting your team know it's happening as well as being a general boon to team efficiency, Small Game countering hex perks including NOED *as well as Hag's entire power just in case you happen to be against her*, or any number of aura reading perks that let survivors make informed decisions rather than 3 genning themselves, getting caught in a bad position, then failing a juke and REEing in post-game chat. Now watch as this thoughtless post is upvoted because Pepega survivors inherently make up the majority of the playerbase."
---
I'm curious who your source was. I just had a game yesterday where one of my swf had the obsession, and the only obsession perk in the entire match was the random with DS
---
First off, do you have BBQ and Ruin? If not getting those perks should be your main focus. I'd say after you get those perks play the Doctor or Freddy, they're pretty easy to play and they're annoying as hell for the survivors. Always use BBQ and Ruin. With the Doctor always make sure to guard the three gens that are the closest together, you should always get a 3 man when doing that strat. Just make sure to guard the gens before chases and shock the hell out of all of them whenever you see them working on one of your three gens. It might take awhile, but you'll eventually down one by your three gens. But remember your number one goal is to not let any of them bitch ass survivors touch your gens, so don't chase them around unless they're by your three gens. Also I'd recommend using Distressing  and Unnerving Presence for your two other perks when using The Doctor. For Freddy just sleep every fucker you find. People say he's bad but I've gotten to rank one by using him getting 4ks 95% of the time. If you're in the middle of a chase and see another survivor put their ass to sleep and continue chasing. For my Freddy I use Bamboozle and Whispers for my two other perks. Whispers just makes it so it's pretty much impossible to not be chasing a survivor. Whenever whispers is going off you should be spamming your sleep ability while doing 360s (unless you can see the survivor, which you should just sleep them and chase them), it's a god send in corn because you can't see shit, but once the survivor goes to sleep they're a lot easier to see because they turn blue. Bamboozle would probably be a pain in the ass for you to get on Freddy so I'd use something else like NOED seeing how you're still learning how to play again and it's easy to get, or you could just use any perk you want really. With the Doctor protect your three gens over everything else! Your goal is to let them do every gen expect those three gens close together. Then shock their ass when they try do them, you should be able to shock them at either of the three gens from a couple meters away. With Freddy just chase and sleep every little bitch ass survivor you find! When you hook them use BBQ to find your next hoe to chase. Once you get good with one killer you'll be better on every other killer. Right now you just need an easier killer to play so you can learn how to outsmart survivors and all that other shit. This probably didn't help you at all. I am a rank 1 killer tho lol.
---
Honestly his traps stand out super hard on that map.
---
They really need to add queue cooldowns or some other punitive method to DC, AFAIK you need to DC from over 40% of your games for anything to happen.
---
I thought he meant Exposed 100% at first but after 150 matches, 2-3 moris is reasonable. He is talking about mori
---
You don't need ruin with billy, and why the hell you running billy without bbq? billy is not billy without bbq, please see mr bubba and come back to billy.
---
Not really. Idk if thats sacrasm or not but it seems like all of the jags objectives showed up in one spot rather quickly.
---
Says my post is thoughtless when it's coming from someone from the other side, thoughtlessly dismisses the entire post and topic at hand.
---
There are different perks that solve different problems, that's true. But those perks like Distortion, Kindred, Small Game, and Aura reading perks aren't perks you build around, they're perks you put in to counter something.
---
If I'm running a Slug Build, a Gen Jockey, a Chase build, or an Item build, I can slot one of those perks in and often do. That doesn't change the fact that DS, MoM, and Adrenaline are so much above the power level of other Survivor perks/builds that you're handicapping yourself by not using them.
---
There's also the fact that you conveniently ignore that not every killer runs Nurses, not every killer camps (despite what Reddit would have you believe), and not every killer uses NOED, where as every game you lose you're going to get chased.
---
I don't think f13s salt mine actually exists though. If you ask the guys in that sub they will say it doesn't because it was never Implemented in the patch notes but its still a lovely idea that dbd really really needs.
---
It's kind of sad that this bug will most likely be fixed before I can try it out because this looks way more fun than anything else this game has to offer
---
I like this edit, take my upvote.
---
Aaaaand everyone jumps in the locker upon your approach. 
---
In all seriousness, I haven't seen prople being tombstoned in a long long while. Hooked? Yes. Tombstoned? Unlikely.
---
Wait what
---
you mean to tell me that the scream ash makes when he's downed isnt funny? lol
---
This looks so fun
---
My bad, 1v9
---
Imagine +15% movement speed for survivors 😂
---
Uhh, dude. I don't know how to break this to you but...
---
7 Bloodpoints is barely equivalent to a cent, let alone 7 greenbois.
---
I know the quality isnt the greatest. That has to do with the formate i rendered it in. If anybody knows what i could do better pls let me know
---
I'd slap a little music over it, but otherwise I have nightmares about you
---
Whoa, no perk survivor? Definitely an easy 3k.
---
there’s really nothing toxic about new DS lol
---
I’d add some music and some cookie cutter transitions.
---
As playing survivor I don't feel that you really NEED perks to have great games and "win" it. If you don't consider you need perks, you can try whatever you like and it will only be a bonus.
---
The only perk that put you at disadvantage right now is No Mither.
---
Also people should consider using more sub-optimal perks as it is a great way to improve your gameplay. In that spirit, I will love that Devs create a "No perks, addons, items" matchmaking system.
---
Great Idea. On my size it should matter if its copyright or not, does it?
---
Yo what's in the shrine?
---
Gonna do that on the nextt one. thanks
---
That doesn't change the fact that there is a huge discrepancy between bonuses you can get...
---
I mean, copyright always matters but that’s what obscure music is for. Always credit the artists and such but just don’t do like a Bruno Mars song.
---
Huntress main here, ever hit through a window on Haddonfield? I did once.. wont happeb again
---
None of them, because they're all ass-tier perks? Those are just the result of you trying to force perks into a build because they accomplish similar goals. I listed a lot of perks that you can swap out any of your standards for -- Distortion to make it a lot harder for the killer to track you in the first place, Kindred so your teammates know what each other is doing AND get information on the killer so they can efficiently help you and do gens simultaneously, so on. Hell, Object of Obsession is a broken-tier perk that almost nobody runs because they don't know how to use it.
---
The only slot in the "meta" survivor build that I think you would be foolish to leave out is the Exhaustion perk. Exhaustion perks are specifically the subset of perks that BHVR decided were so broken that they had to have a linked cooldown, and then they also gave killers addons that cause the Exhaustion debuff to help try and counter them, and they're still broken enough to be top tier past that. So, always run an exhaustion perk, but past that, you have more to work with than you think.
---
most of survivor perks need a rework or at least a touch-up. a 30% increased success zone while i'm bleeding, wow, sign me the fuck up! Oh, I can see gens nearby? just what i needed! Ooooooooh, i recover from effects a whopping 20% faster? Sweet! Oh... my god! I get 125% extra gen repair speed if i'm all alone and no gens are done! that's only like... 35.55 seconds per gen! I'm going free in no time!   
---
see how stupid this is?
---
Rip, I don't think I've ever got all 4 full tbh and I'm a rank 2 killer.
---
Can't have spaces or symbols like = in PS4 usernames
---
.. a picture for ants?!
---
Double pip/merciless killer.
---
Whatever you need to do for that is what you need.
---
Playing against a Legion who is at least at the level of not being braindead is not fun. Every game where a Legion tunnels, has Frank's, or moonwalk, I will DC. I'm not giving you BBQ stacks or staying in a game where I'm not having fun. Most of the time I would complain about others doing the same, but Legion is the most unfun killer to go against and always will be until a rework.
---
It's a nice compilation. It also shows how bad Hitboxes sometimes are. Like hitting self-caring survivors on the upper left corner besides a tree as seen in the shot at 0:35.
---
The conversation that if you want to actually play Survivor, you're very limited in what perks you can take.
---
The conversation that if you want to actually build a Survivor to do anything other than be chased, you can't.
---
The conversation where you're better off not running any perks at all if you're going to run 90% of Survivor perks?
---
The conversation where you're deluded into thinking that BBQ/Whispers/Ruin/Bamboozle isn't a synergistic build? 
---
You say "Just run good perks" and follow that up with "Well all those perks are shitty" without a hint of irony or self awareness in a conversation where I'm trying to point out that 90% of Survivor perks aren't worth running even if you build around them.
---
If you want to do Generators, there's nothing for you. If you want to do Boxes, there's nothing for you. The closest thing Survivors have to a legitimate build other than MoM/DS/Dead Hard is Borrowed Time, We'll Make It and WGLF. **This is a problem, and it's why most survivors default to the perks that are good while being chased**.
---
Imagine paying for a character just get a P2W P2Progress faster perk.
---
They patched this out before the first paid dlc (Michael) came out iirc
---
Depends on the killer, but in general, Hex:Ruin, Barbecue and Chili and NOED are considered the meta for everyone. A Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher and Monitor and Abuse are also pretty meta.
---
Top tier killer builds :
---
Nurse : Shadowborn, Barbecue and Chili, Infectious Fright, Deerstalker.
---
Toxic Nurse : Ruin, BBQ, Rancor, NOED
---
Spirit : A Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker, Rancor, Surveillance.
---
Toxic Spirit : Devour Hope, Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice, NOED.
---
Billy : Barbecue and Chili, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle. 
---
Toxic Billy : BBQ, Ruin, NOED, Enduring
---
Huntress : A Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker, Barbecue and Chili, Shadowborn.
---
Toxic Huntress : Ruin, A Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker, NOED.
---
Hag : Ruin, Make Your Choice, A Nurse's Calling, Monitor and Abuse.
---
Toxic Hag : Devour Hope, Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice, NOED.
---
&gt; You say "Just run good perks" and follow that up with "Well all those perks are shitty" without a hint of irony
---
- list 3 shitty perks 
---
- "which of these perks are good?"
---
- ignores repeated list of good perks that aren't MoM/DS/Adren repeated throughout several comments

What drugs are you on? David Tapp and Feng Min have ear-raping hook screams.
---
same applies to the rank 8 SWF that are told hook diving the camping LF is a *bad* idea
---
Also they changed rules for palettes spawning but last week I played on the asylum (Nurse's map) and there was 2 pallets (one of each side of the loop) in the main  entrance of the center building (where the basement is if it spawned there)...
---
Pretty good job...

they did nothing wrong tho
---
That was funny! Poor Dwight
---
Literally unreadable &gt;:
---
I didn't ignore your list of good perks, your list of good perks isn't relevant to the discussion.
---
Distortion doesn't help me complete a Generator faster. Small Game doesn't help me open chests. Having perks like Kindred doesn't help me tell my team where everything is unless the Killer is *right on top of me*.
---
You keep saying "run good perks" and then completely ignoring me saying "Well, no perks are good for what I want to do even if you group them all together" and then act all smug behind your "meme" comment because you're the one not comprehending what is being said.
---
So one last time, and try to understand the question:
---
Why should I take any perk that doesn't help me in the chase, when I can stall the Killer for over 70 seconds by myself and give my team practically an entire generators worth of free time where they can run around the map doing Generators, cleansing totems, and looting chests that is even remotely worth it compared to running that build.
---
They walk backwards
---
Nah. Wanna see what monster really looks like?

Distressing, clourophobia, sloppy butcher, new plague perk that transfers terror radius.

Let’s be honest, neighbors didn’t call the cops that was just clickbait
---
Buy the cannibal dlc, I main billy and I’ve only seen the hatch once this year. I just slug everyone until I get my 4K, I do have enduring/spirit fury to help with chases and change my strafe to q/e.
---
And you ruin the game for everyone because you're a crybaby, imma report you both.
---
Huh
---
uwOAHOAA
---
Raylee or something. Australian streamer. Very fun and positive streamer.
---
Is this a bad time to mention that the only perk in your build that comes into play before you've been hooked is the exhaustion one?
---
So survivors can't see his stain
---
Four Legions.
---
100 Survivors.
---
25 Generators.
---
Regular sized maps.
---
The killers would be in Feral Frenzy the entire game, and the Survivors would never be able to mend.
---
Glorious.
---
Yeah, I know they didn’t, I’m just salty about it because I was trying to show my friend who’s only had the game for a few hours how fun the game can be, then that happened. We didn’t even really get a chance as I got hooked first, and he doesn’t even know what a hatch is or what it sounds like or what scratch marks are, so it was a really enjoyable experience for all parties involved. I’m just salty, folks. I’ll take the downvotes, now.
---
Definitely has big PS4 energy though, there's a dc in most of my survivor games
---
Bring your children at work's day
---
I cooled it
---
You dont say
---
Despite making up only 5.88 of the survivor population, Claudettes are responsible for 70% of all killers crying
---
Nurse, Billy and Spirit with BBQ are the best, with these killers you will get your 4 stacks with no problem and BBQ also helps them more than others killers because they have speed based powers.
---
Alternatively, one killer defending one generator from 20 survivors.
---
Author is pretty much only ever used in regards to written works. I suppose the only exception would be songs, which can be referred to by author or artist, but those are both written and performed.
---
What if you let people play whatever they want
---
This
---
With a lot of determination and the right attitude, anything is possible.
---
So Tapp needs his own category too.
---
Usually games have 15 to 30 min cd to join again- LoL, WoW. Biggest names have that. Problem is they can tell when someone dc and when it is their own fucking game freezing cause it is the same thing when it freeze and you alt+ f4 and you just stop your internet for example - people can just pretend it was their game and they cant fix that shit for EVER. The game is going soo downhill

---
Ormond is just like pale rose or the swamp map it probably right in front of you but you dont see it. It sucks because its huge and has infinites but a russian roulette build makes it dangerous.
---
They say a lot of things... doesn’t mean they won’t
---
Two examples: 
---
they said no religious themes... plague- check
---
They said nobody will talk- plague &amp; Ash- check
---
all of the builds on here are really great! personally i really like nurses calling on wraith; with how fast he is cloaked it’s easy to go back to the hook and catch survivors out post-save, and a lot of the time they don’t move too far away to heal. plus, if you’re god awful at chases like me and continually lose survivors, you can catch them self-caring in a corner.
---
in my experience survivors tend not to clock that you have nurses calling very fast, and i find a lot of people trying to heal in the basement for some reason which means, you know, easier kill for me!
---
also i suck at this game so maybe nurses calling is bad lmao, i like playing it personally.
---
try different things out and see what feels good for you. wraith is a lot of fun to play once you’ve figured out a good build. happy hunting!
---
Is this a bad time to mention that unless you're going up against a trash killer, you're going to get hooked at least once per game?
---
Or that MoM doesn't actually require you be hooked, just that you get hit three times. Healing counts.
---
Because DBD is a competitive game so both sides will have they’re share of try hards.
---
This is some facebook level shit
---
Alright you heard the man, everyone needs to switch over to that sick Kindred meta so we don't get labeled as toxic survivors for running perks that actually matter.
---
I bet any amount of money you like that this guy whines about the "imaginary survivor rulebook", too.
---
When I’m rarely playing as the killer and this happens, I usually just end up farming with the 2 last players and let them leave. Their game got ruined as well as mine, so at least let’s get a few bps for it.
---
u/ImAddictedIGuess SAY MY NAME
---
Don't agree with it, but I can understand their logic: Losing 1000 bp because you got hooked right off the bat and camped isn't worth worrying about when you can get into another game and hopefully get more. They probably don't want to waste the 2+ minutes of just dying on hook.
---
Bond is great and all, but have you ever had Aftercare? That shit be WILD.
---
Yes
---
You’re a gentleman and a scholar! You’re my favorite type of dude, and there really does need to be more killers out there like you! Someone gold or silver this man!
---
I've got a feeling so complicated about the Spirit...
---
You never know ;)
---
Shoot, would you turn down a deal with a huge horror movie monster like the aliens? Anything could happen, I’d take the devs words with a grain of salt
---
It's like a burning sunrise

Yeah I wanna fuck her too

I'd like to know as well. Wouldn't mind springing it on some friends the next time everyone gets on.

You forgot the best of all, "Freddy players when they get matched into Yamoaka Estate"

&gt;but there is insta down killers

I mean, if my solution to mettle of man is to stop playing wraith and play billy instead, is it really a solution?

---
If they had two brain cells to rub together one of them would have lead you away from the hook or else just gone and done a gen. I have no patience with killers that camp but in the situation you described it sounds like the survivors would have been content to farm their teammate, they were so thirsty for the points.  Like a renaissance pope, I absolve you, go have fun.
---
&gt;Imagine if all your perks items and add-ons were useless.
---
I don't have to imagine survivor is slowly getting there. What killers don't realize is that no matter how useless they make survivor tools, the games will still go by fast if 
---
A) they are bad
---
B) the survivors are good
---
Generators still take a short time. Don't take away our tools, give some to killers. (I'm also questioning how many of those complaining killers made stupid mistakes.) Some of them started talking about nerfing adrenaline. Like bruh, you arent gonna stop unless every perk is deja Vu tier, are you?
---
Dang you got me, "survivors have more than 6 good perks" is basically me saying that running MoM is toxic. My billy is very triggered by all 0 stacks that the chainsaw gives.
---
I.... umm.... well... YES.
---
Learn how to be pallet efficient, they made it easier when the increased the number of pallets. Learn how to use T L walls, if used right the only counter is bamboozle. Always make sure someone is doing a gen, a good survivor can get a gen don in 80 seconds or less but with ruin a good survivor can get a gen done in exactly 80 seconds.
---
Learn to identify pallets as unsafe or safe, the pallets in the bottom floor of temple of purgation are very unsafe, while the pallets neat the bathroom and basement on the game map are very safe.
---
It’s also important to learn where pallets might spawn, this could be a bit hard on maps like shelter woods because fuck shelter woods. Windows of opportunity can na a good way to start, I still use it (800 hours) and it saves my life a few times.
---
Don’t be stealthy, be aggressive, that will waste the killers time and will help you with knowing what your limits are.
---
Just pretty much play the game normally and have fun, this all comes with experience.
---
Ah, so you were right!
---
I guess I didn’t look well enough.
---
Good job, mate!
---
lol, alright, thanks.
---
thanks, my dude! It was buried under all of her other stuff, took me a bit to find it. Have a nice day!
---
If you are stuck in a lobby with 3 survivors (assuming you usually find games pretty fast), you should as a survivor or killer leave the lobby. There is a bug that causes you to get stuck in such lobbies.
---
I agree, but a lot of the time you're better off just running. People running that perk crouchwalk into corners and wait until the killer is right on top of them and then get chainsawed.
---
You know what ? Given how good Freddy is at slowing the game down like hell just by existing, he would probably be the best teammates you can wish for in a mode where killers can play a la a team...
---
yes, Michael (the Shape) as well
---
Actually every killer makes some sort of sounds. I think you can hear them if you select that killer in a lobby
---
u/DwightNot

Youre right and i have wanting a xenomorph

FunGoose
---
This is ass
---
Three offerings, two perks, and two Michael Myers' addons.
---
Offerings:
---
Yellow mori: Can kill the last downed survivor on the map.
---
Green mori: Can kill one downed survivor, as long as you've hooked them at least once.
---
Pink mori: Can kill any downed survivor, as long as you've hooked them at least once.
---
Perks:
---
Devour Hope: Can kill any downed survivor as long as you've got 5 tokens and the totem is still up.
---
Rancour: After the gens are done, can instadown and then kill the downed obsession.
---
The Shape Addons:
---
Tombstone piece: At EW3, can grab a survivor and kill them at the cost of losing EW3 (can kill up to 3 survivors this way before you run out of stalk).
---
Judith's Tombstone: At EW3, can grab any survivor and kill them.
---
On Xbox, but it's kind of crazy how some days are complete opposites. Like one day 90% of the matches are against facecampers and tunnelers, the next day it would be 10%, but rarely there's days where it would be 50/50. 
---
Always seems to be the polar opposite for the whole day. Is there a secret douchebag killer schedule on the DBD Discord?
---
I have never encountered this but this is news to me, so I would most likely just have taken the key. Thanks for informing me about this.
---
FYI, just because most survivors run META (strong perks like MoM/DS/Adrenaline/etc.) it doesn’t mean we all are “TOXIC”. 
---
And yes, those perks are mandatory as it has higher chance to escape and survive the trial in high-rank, especially against high-rank and tryhard killers.
---
As I am in red-rank survivor, doing meme builds was fun, but barely helped me, if you know what mean. 
---
Similar to killers, they also need META (Ruin, BBQ, NOED, etc.) as well to secure at least 1 or 2 kills to not depip. However, with killers power and good add-on, they can try several build and most of them are effective. Differently from survivors as other builds are meh and not helping that much.
---
Killer using Sprit Fury: Oh YeAh!
---
Thank you!
---
&gt; Survivors have perks that are strong as hell. Dance with me iron will spine chill, kindred, deja vu, self heal, hope. So many different things to hide scratch marks not make sounds balance landed adrenaline.
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
Dance with Me is a pretty good perk when combined with stuff like Quick &amp; Quiet and Lithe, but by itself it doesn't help much. Scratch marks may be gone, but the Killer can still potentially follow the blood trails, to say nothing of actually seeing you run away. By itself, it does practically nothing.
---
Iron Will is a stealth perk that does absolutely nothing against any Killer that is trying to find you because it doesn't hide your aura or make you harder to see. It's the equivalent of playing Hearthstone and saying "We'll win if our opponent doesn't play anything".
---
Spine Chill is actually pretty good.
---
Kindred is actually pretty good.
---
Deja vu is widely considered the worst perk in the game because any survivor worth their salt knows around where the Generators are. The only time you run DV is if you have a Map with Crystal Bead, and even then it's iffy.
---
Self Heal is good, but not too strong. It takes a while to heal, and it's arguably better to take Botany with a Medkit over it.
---
Hope is a bad Adrenaline. I don't think I've seen *anyone* run it.
---
x to doubt
---
Unless the creators or those who own the license allow this.
---
If Myers is your favourite horror movie villain, get him. He’s mine too, and he’s so much fun to play. Stalking survivors whilst they’re on a gen and waiting until one of them notices you’re there (who then fucking sprints out of there) is such a good feeling and can really spook survivors.
---
That, and Scratched Mirror Myers. Holy shit, it’s the best addon for killers hands down. It’s phenomenal- it makes you feel more like Michael Myers like than even the base Myers build does.
---
It gets worse the more I think about it
---
I don’t get what you’re trying to show. That you don’t have enough bloodpoints?
---
did you know all swf are the same and all swf are good 100% everytime
---
Moonwalking is a killer tactic to mind-game survivors looping them. It's basically when they walk backwards around a corner to hide their red stain from showing where they are going. 
---
It's used to give survivors no indication of where the killer is coming from &amp; to make the survivor lose sight of the killer.
---
Legion: *exists*  
---
Survivors: *exixsten't*
---
Definitely should not have clicked that
---
I thought Ash was pretty alright
---
Baby killers be like

The red thingy that's supposed to go from the yellow item to the instaheal is instead going from the instaheal to the yellow item.

And also the red circle that's showing when I hold the instaheal is upside down.
---
Personally I feel differently. I agree that their are some very strong survivor perks that work well together but I am able to escape with a lot of BP and out of the perks you listed I have only recently run MoM and even that I am considering ditching.   
---
I think any game has its meta builds or characters or ways to play. I play WWE against friends and we all know that the best characters are the ones with the hardest to reverse finisher but the challenge is in not picking them every time. Same can be said with DBD. I often run builds like self care, lightweight, quick and quiet, alert or maybe pharmacy, bond, we will make it, plunderers. I like to mix it up as it keeps the game fresh for me and I have found I learnt to play better using perks that people see as 'useless'. They are not OP like certain builds, which is why I guess toxic players use them all the time and the perks are then labelled toxic, but I am able to survive and to do well not just hide in a bush.
---
Hard to explain, sorry for confusion.
---
Read above...
---
I would if I could. But psn doesnt allow me te biy anything. Whispers it is
---
I can wait a couple years for it to be a thing. ò3ó 
---
Age of consent here is 16 (same for Canada where I assume all of Legion are from) but waiting for 18 is a safe bet.
---
~~Why am I getting so serious about a meme about a character that won’t ever exist or love me. XD~~
---
Bear in mind, Mettle of Man stacks are only gained through basic attacks. A decent Huntress can completely nullify the perk through Hatchets alone.
---
When I play survivor I run well live forever, spine chill, lithe and technician or I’ll switch it to adrenaline.  This is what I dont get most killers and damn near all survivors dont like noed. It punishes survivors for out playing the killer and doing the objective.  So MoM does the same thing noed does and everyone is defending the perk. If you get out played you get outplayed.
---
Oooo, someone’s a bit mad today, complaining on like every post lmao
---
Susie the survivor getting hunted by Myers*
---
Darn
---
no flash lights either! or adrenaline!
---
no self care, self care op
---
Ha ha you caught on
---
Have you seen the Remake?
---
It was actually pretty good, a great retelling of the first movie and I'd probably say one of the best horror remakes in a while.
---
The problem I feel was everyone kind of forgot that the first movie didn't have the camp we've all come to know and love from the franchise. It's kind of a massive mood whiplash if you're not expecting it.
---
Hyperbole is boring, stop.
---
Frank's mixtape needs changing. In fact, the entire power needs changing.

Edit out snap my fingers and put play my mixtape

Yeah he was also wacking random shit in a chase so i thought we were both messing around, guess i hurt his feelings

---
wait aren't you that guy running around in rank 15\~13 with ruin hillbilly accusing anyone who knows how to run tiles of depipping? lmao, only reason I'm guessing you are is because you have the exact same build as someone who does.
---
So what happens if you use both addons?
---
Tapps first name is david. So they may have been saying david tapp and not david, tapp, and feng
---
Depends on how you do it and when.
---
Well ok it isn t the same thing as murder i just wanted to point out that fighting toxicity with toxicity is not a good thing because mb it isn t same thing as murder but it is the same logic. Eye for eye is never a good thing not even in video games, i mean yea pushing the same Button is not same as taking a knife and pushing a knife into somone because taking a life is worse then t bag but just because t bag is better then murder it dosen t mean that its ok to do as a act of revenge
---
Not seen the remake. It sounds good, some remakes of older movies are poorly done and some are really good, I'm hoping this is one of the better ones.
---
The funny thing is if a survivor abused game mechanics they get called toxic and crap. But a killer can abuse bugs and its fine. (Tinkerer bug and now this one)
---
Well if everyone has adrenaline its pretty aids otherwise its fine
---
Remove Slippery meat and create a perk called Steel Toed Boots which lets you take one trap without penalty per match or put it on an exhaustion timer. Step in a bear trap, your fine. Step on a hag trap its destroyed. The extra unhooking chance is pointless anyway so no need to even bother with it.
---
Odd how we got downvoted for no reason

I wanna poke the bear

Relatively new player here, what’s wrong with Claudette?
---
I didn't get hooked once actually, downed once and slugged and got up...because of No Mither. Not sure why you're being so creepily hostile about it to be honest. Did a killer kill your parents while they ran No Mither or something?
---
Guess I'll keep running it after all, just because of how much it bothers you.
---
I'm gonna repost this just to get other's takes
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 
---
&gt;Now MoM wouldn't be affected by Spirit or Nurse though..  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;There's  no way to protect weak killers getting bodied by the perk from strong  killers getting bodied, because they're mixed m1/insta natures with the  exception of NOED  
---
&gt;Personally, the Survivor meta is so stale and small perk wise compared to the perks available to killer atm.  
---
&gt;And streamers have all jumped on the perk partly because it's a new perk with a use.  
---
&gt;Jeff  and Jane and Ash's two perks were useless, head on has meme potential  but it's very restrictive in it's use (pallets or swf) unlike  MoM which  although bugged atm, the payoff you get for getting 3 tokens is worth  it even if you can no longer heal or risk giving free info to the  killer.  
---
&gt;You could easily argue that  Adam, Kate, David and Quentin all had perks with no meta impact, meaning  7 survivors being released before getting a meta worthy perk for  survivor.  
---
&gt;Compared to the killer DLC's releases, it's anemic.  
---
&gt;BBQ / Remember Me/ Blood Warden / Make your Choice / Bamboozle / Pop goes the weasel / (Spirit Perks) / Infectious Fright  
---
&gt;and  that's not to say that Knock out / franklin's / Fire Up / surveillance  buffed / discordance arn't good in there own right, more importantly  they don't require pairing with another perk to get use out of it.  
---
&gt;(Might require the right killer with mobility being the more important aspect)  
---
&gt;Survivor wise it just feels stale  
---
&gt;I  run Plunderer's / ace in the hole to have some fun with chests and to  roleplay as Delivery Boy Dwight, but my time would probably be best  spent on a gen or using better perks to run with.
---
Can I download it some were?
---
You need to mend for about 80 seconds. The first time I went against this combo I thought it was a bug but I tested it out with my brother and yes it is a thing. 80 seconds.
---
Jane was probably “tortured” in the recording booth too 😉😩
---
Indeed.
---
How is one post listing how well the perks actually work, one post saying the Toolbox was why it worked, and another post saying it's still not good "being creepily hostile"?
---
You keep running it, that's fine by me. Just don't complain to anyone when you run into non-potato killers.
---
Cool story
---
no, it makes them look like a non native english speaker who is learning. it’s still understandable, so why talk shit to them about it lmao? stop being such a nazi.
---
Thats hella cute :)
---
Because the circlejerk of people saying that Legion is fine is gaining members, because they all want to be contrarian instead of being sensible.
---
Maybe the devs will grant your wish and you can kill bots by yourself when everyone is on a cooldown for DCing. And yeah, I would rather play Nurse or Billy, I think I said that in another comment in this thread. At least those 2 killers require a modicum of skill, whereas Trapper is just plain luck if you trap a survivor (or as you were doing trapping the top of the stairs of Thompson House which is borderline exploiting). Also nice VAC ban on your Steam profile. Anyway I'm done here, this has been enough reditting for 2019 for me.
---
"Guaranteed only person who needs unhooking is you!!!" Erm, no. Not relevant, or even correct. I did fine thanks. 
---
Weirdo.
---
I remembered going against a camping legion with these addons. He killed all of us and called us stupid while the most stupid thing is obviously everyhing about Legion and how 80 seconds mending time is a thing :)
---
lagswitch.
---
Every time I hook a Feng Min I’m like “bruh chill out, you don’t need to scream that loud”
---
No, doing something like pointing isn't really anything malicious or hateful.
---
Much like a fat **point down** it really only has the meaning you give it, and if you want to interpret a simple emote as "toxic" then, I don't really know what to say.
---
Abusing bugs is wrong for both survivors and killers. I don't know why you would think that clicking on a different role istantly makes it fine
---
Where you in the same match or was that answer just made up?
---
I don't really care I am talking about that nodding Bullshit which is probably as unnessecary, childish and toxic as the 2 tbags he did.
---
Indeed
---
No it was a shadow nerf, they intentionally did it
---
Did you even *see* the post?
---
That's probably how it'll go for me. I start something, watch the first few seasons in 2-3days then forget about it for 4 months.
---
Tbh if they made it so open handed stacked with boil over that would be really really nice.
---
I’m not really alone if I have a flesh light to keep me company.
---
Reposti
---
how did you even find this? i remember the looping is toxic discussion from like a year ago on some fucking steam forum, its nothing new
---
Oops, deleted.
---
#GROOVY
---
I’ve seen the gold one on Xbox one, I’ve never seen the others though.
---
how the fuck do you hook camp the last two survivors
---
Yeah that’s my friend, I’m the Claudette at 1:02.
---
I remember seeing a lot of post against the tinkerer 2 bug and I remember people who admitted to use it getting downvoted into the shadow realm.
---
I wasn't playing during the wraith bug so I can't talk about that
---
someone told me that i bullied them for looping them at a jungle gym and facecamped me
---
If you have self care use it because not only does it allow you to heal yourself you can also use it to wake up mid chase if your lucky enough to get a skill check.
---
Use adrenaline if you have it as well because it’ll allow you to wake up from the dream world and it’ll also heal you if your injured. Adrenaline is also one of the best perks in the game.
---
Depending on how new you are I’d also use windows of opportunity so you can find pallets and windows easier so you can try to loop Freddy.
---
I see a normal nurse play ?
---
Thank you! I appreciate it.
---
a rank 20 might say that yeah
---
I mean you are right the average survivor or killer isn't Marth but his Depip squad is more about what survivors could be that would be terribly unfun for the killer. If some type of hardcore ranking system comes to the game where rank 1 takes a reasonable amount of skill then a lot of survivors will learn to play optimized eventually.
---
Also he did a lot of his killer iron mans before the recent rank rework where to hit rank 1 all you really had to do was play a lot and be ok which means a lot of pretty bad survivors were rank 1. I am not saying Marth is not an amazing killer he is one of the best but even he would struggle against organized swf groups if he didn't play his nurse.
---
Start playing killer like you believe they should be played.  Be the example.
---
It’s impossible to hack on console, as soon the PSN or Xbox Live detect a file that’s not meant to be it’ll knock you offline.
---
HOLY SHIIIIIIIT!
---
if you breathe at a killer its toxic
---
Tbag isnt even toxic... Its just over reaction from bad killer than can't catch a survivor... The ego is too strong imo !
---
Killer main btw.
---
A good idea would be 2v5 or 2v6
---
God wraith bug was so bad. My computer could run this game with 60 fps. But wraith using sloppy made blood squirt out all the time. It would make my fps drop to around 10-15 fps. And i would get wraiths almost every game because people were exploiting the bug. It made the game literally unplayable because it was just so bad.
---
Did you send the complaint as username related? Next time send it as a real life threat or something like that. They probably dont care that much about usernames im the end cause they are fucking lazy.
---
&gt;survivor not being ripley
---
wtf
---
Zubat went perkless killer and without addons from rank 20 to 1 in one stream. I guess this means killers don’t need perks and addons either?
---
+2 pip is required for adept achievement right now. At least on PC. I did nurse few days ago, so it's doable. At least at rank 13.
---
Usually the most toxic players &amp; is invisible while crouching with most of her cosmetics
---
I was one of the people initially defending it before we got it live but even I want it nerfed lol I shouldn’t have to be running OP shit on killer and playing like an asshole in order to counter it.
---
Literally every killer main has been whining about it constantly, where have you been?
---
It’s not the end of the world with other killers but Nurse on console is rough. Even with a ps4 pro the frames dive whenever you blink
---
Don't forget that unless mori, facecamp or survivor fuckup you have to hit 3 times even with a one hit killer to win in the first place.
---
I do my friend, I do
---
And here I am with my only LV 40 being doctor so most commonplace 'builds' are impossible for me.
---
Before you couldn't hear a directional wooshing sound from her power all the time, now that sound isn't directional anymore and you need to be out side of her terror radius to be able to hear it.
---
Also, they reduce her cooldown from 20 seconds to 15 seconds.
---
That would be kinda dumb because that means that survivors can't win via the hatch
---
Now it causes a bug where it will increase the mending time every time you hit somebody. It also stacks every single time after you mend. If you get hit enough by feral frenzy you could be stuck mending for over five minutes.
---
Now rank all of the killer stun grunts :)
---
He could also be talking about Michael though.
---
If the killer is hell bent on a survivor not getting hatch then go finish gens and leave through the gate.
---
Also nurse blink attacks currently don't give stacks which I think is ridiculous but tier 3 michael does
---
Claudette’s is funny as fuck.
---
Basically they just changed the emblem system which made it more difficult to pip and therefore rank
---
There's a whole sister subreddit for this. Check the community info

"Next you're going to say: All Spirit players are no life virgins who can't even enjoy the game."

Hope is arguably stronger than adrenaline bc it makes you 7% faster for 2 minutes. Doesn’t sound like a lot but think about huntress or hag for example that are only 110. They’re only 3% faster than you.
---
Then your team did not do a good job cleansing totems and you dont deserve hatch anyway haha
---
Yes?😂
---
From my experience 3v1 is so rare that this logo is not needed.   
---
Or maybe I'm of the lucky ones.
---
Who knows.
---
Oh OH OHHH yeah right, play the Nazi card cause I speak German. Very cool of you buddy.
---
Being nice, and giving you a chance to walk away from the hook is for when you're playing a custom with your new friends and teaching them how mechanics work. 2 Survivors running away from the hook, 1 is injured. Do the math, you're the easier kill. Regardless how your feelings are hurt and coming into play, it IS, and WILL ALWAYS be the smarter choice 95% of the time. If I see a good ass survivor making crazy plays, I'll focus them. But on even ground, everyone bleeds the same. 1 Dead survivor is 25% less of a chance for everyone to escape. I've definitely played more survivor than killer, because I'm playing with friends most of the time. But, rarely do I have chases last 45 seconds. Either I get caught, or I lose him. Don't just loop, evade. Hide. Play those mind games.
---
yeah because i definitely knew you speak german lmao
---
Maybe don't just camp at the hatch and wait for them to do something or go do gens.
---
Yeah that's what I thought you were saying you did lol.  It's undoubtedly camping man, this is just a super weak self justification of it you're doing by prematurely calling 3 gen strat.  I mean tell yourself whatever you have to to feel not scummy about how you're playing them lol but it is for sure camping.  You're going in to games with the intent to camp them between gens regardless of what is left on the field.
---
&gt;Uhh no, because you are forced to go back without being able to do anything
---
Agitation, Iron Grasp, 75 Hooks per map….
---
 With this kind of chance Boil over would be usable but still far from being meta.

Memes = shitpost, not sure what you're on about anyway.
---
What if it's tier 3 Myers or bubbas chainsaw or Huntresses hatchet?
---
There are no exclusives on console
---
Yes? I literally mentioned that in one of the other replies (with Tachire).
---
How?
---
Im pretty sure it just comes with special edition. It just appeared one day
---
Why would i ever dc unless the killwr has massive internet problems
---
I have the science fair and street meg
---
and why would i wanna read any of your other conversations when you just shittalk people for their english?
---
And why do you have to self-care in the corner of the map? Please stop.
---
Yeah i did but nobody was able to read it so deleted it
---
You are always going to have those killers...I'm simply floating the idea about the crows allowing an instant pickup...I'm not trying to nerf every instadown killer haha
---
No man, just like what you said but flipped. If it's on the survivors for letting the killer build a tight 3 final generators, it's on the killer for letting them have 3 on opposite corners of the map. It's about reading the map and playing smart.
---
They werent totally dumb in the game I have particularly in mind, but they also didnt do what they should have to break up my play. 
---
Its strategy, not camping. If you happen to be hooked where my tight patrol takes me... well... that sucks, but maybe do what most other survivors do when faced with this. Take a hit and run out of the tight 3. If you go down there, that's on you.
---
I look at it this way. If I let them go, they might have happened to have been 2 huge assholes who like to bully killers and are now humbled by the fact half their team failed to load in. It would be a disservice to all killers if I showed them mercy.
---
I agree NOED isn’t designed for getting the overly cocky survivors and that it sits just on the good side of perks. Helping killers get at least something out of the game when they’re outplayed. Overall I don’t experience it as much as you seem to, so maybe I look on it more favourably. 
---
As for ruin I think it’s a good thing that it extends the length of the game, particularly at a time when finding survivor games can take 20 minutes just for it to be plagued with players disconnecting. Is it overused? Probably is and aids those killers who camp more
---
This. This or Aftercare. Somehow there are still idiots out there that still think self-care is viable for the team.
---
A lot of people who play this game have their messages disabled, there are some really salty players out there.
---
That's the Iron Chuckles mask, it's very similar but not the same.
---
I agree. Self care is really inefficient now; if you run bond you easily find other people to heal you or people to heal.
---
The worst is when they self-care while NOED is active.
---
David is def torture in recording booth. That guttural scream is haunting.
---
Anything from the trully, dears?
---
I hope you enjoy playing Nurse and other meta tier killers every game, because this is how you get there. Enjoy your 5% escape rate.
---
Just from discussions on this sub. I haven't seen evidence personally either way.
---
Kate's voice actress was changed in the PTB.
---
I like aftercare but it’s a bit inconsistent for me as it takes time to build up, and can be lost by chance. Bond always tells me when someone else is going for the unhook, or when I can stay on the generator if I hear the heartbeat as I can see someone being chased. Always, including at the start of the match.
---
Dorn
---
Give it another month or so. Survivors are still getting the teachable on their main, you'll see it get much worse when every game has 4 MoMs.
---
ChapperzTV is like watching people trying to survive against Mr. Rogers.
---
Guy is wholesome as all heck.
---
Um first off its fortnite,but nah I agree, I hate getting facecamped but that just leaves opportunity for my team to win
---
My bad
---
I hate MoM it just makes people so much more toxic sigh I'll take back old ds to remove mom any day of the week
---
I agree no mither is the new meta /s
---
W. T. F.
---
Basically because they're so hard to see, they don't get chased a lot and most of the time get downed pretty quickly if they are found. I don't think I've ever seen a Claudette make a smart play while playing Killer or Survivor.
---
Not if the survivor knows how to loop, but that's rare.
---
It works consistently just very strangely, remember its an exhaustion perk. 
---
Also, when u activate it a hitbox is chosen on the ground where you land, if the killer was in it when you started the exit animation they will get stunned  regardless of where they run to since head on activated.
---
Small game is good enough it is actualy really good because everyone runs noed and ruin now
---
So survivors are allowed to play smart, but killers arent?
---
*yells for other killer mains*
---
HEY GUYS! I FOUND THE CLAUDETTE MAIN!
---
Mind telling me how? This is for me and my friends and we'd rather not dick on a random if it's just us.
---
I was only joking
---
I know noob3 has the nea tank top and he’s on pc, my friend has bald Dwight and I have
---
The glass breaking sound is a bug actually.
---
You're barking up the wrong tree bro.  I'm a killer main.  One that despise babykillers that make us look like dicks by entering games with the gameplan to camp.  Camping is something we should only do when absolutely forced to such as the idiots 3 genned themselves by popping the wrong gens or there is an open exit gate end of game and there's nothing else to do in the situation.  You manufacture your camps on a game by game basis.  It's a weak strategy for a weak killer and you should feel bad for doing it.
---
Wrong you see reddit is full of entitled survivors and killers both expect to be able to do shit without permission
---
back then when you ran tinkerer tier 2 you would have no heartbeat for the rest of the game when it first goes off
---
We gonna farm forever is more important than your life.
---
I dont. And the downvotes you are racking up are telling.
---
It's weird, because a lot of perks aren't objectively "bad" or anything. The biggest problem is that they're just situational and it's a toss up if they're going to come in handy or not. Running an anti-slugging build is amazing if the killer is well... slugging, but you might as well be perkless if the killer doesn't slug. Running a stealth build is great, yet between all the killers/killer perks chances are the killer will have some way of finding you eventually or right away making your lightweight or urban evasion rather moot not to mention most killer aura perks are better than survivors' aura perks or most likely override any form of stealth a survivor has. Gen based builds are overkill as well, as most people know, the base time of doing a gen is already rather quick, while technically still good things to run, aside from a toolbox they have stipulations to even work, be injured, be with other survivors, have the killer looking at you, camp by the killer for a minute, etc. which can either harm you in the long run or just not be all that much of an increase.
---
Perks that aide in the chase will always be good as they will allow you to distract the killer or elongate the chase, and if you're at a point where you don't need to use perks like that well your team is probably always doing good.
---
Another big reason is that devs seem to be scared to add good survivor perks, there are so many perks that if they were just tweaked a little bit, could be good. Though I don't blame them too much, seeing how many people are crying that survivors got a good chase perk in MoM(still situational on who the killer is) and people are up in arms about it
---
Thanks :)
---
You don’t have to know how to loop, just how to run to every pallet
---
Hey ash is pretty neat
---
Forgot people can't see sarcasm :/
---
Lol first off those are you dude there's one on each lol.  I'm not stupid bro.  Second even if people downvoted me for calling out a camper I wouldn't bat an eyelash.  I've been downvoted for calling out exploiting on here as well as people that witchhunt with false reports so downvotes don't mean anything haha.  Third you readily admitted you enter games, pick gens immediately hook and camp between them regardless.  Don't backtrack own the babystrat.
---
I didn't say I'm right, or think that. I'm not going to change my opinion because of that. I think self care is good deal with it. My thoughts on self care have changed throughout the years. Now I just think it's good/viable. Yes there are better perks like head on and deliverance, but I still use self heal because it ms still *usable*. 
---
Like I said, I run MED KITS to fasten my healing; self care is just there as a *rebound*. I think self care is better the no mither because at least you can heal and aren't just stuck in the injured state the whole game; and that's my opinion. Not healing the game makes you even more useless IMO. 
---
Lots of people still run self care because it's usable and helpful if no one can/will heal you. I like to be independent during the game and self care gives me that. I'm not going to have to rely on my team or a med kit for the whole game. Lots of people can but I can't. It doesn't matter if I run or not because my kit is my kit. I'm not going to lecture you on your setup like you are with mine. Get over it.
---
Try using Sprint Burst so if the killer gets a jump on you you can get to a tile
---
Hard disagree. Survivors have a lot of good perks. You guys just don’t give a fuck.
---
I started a few seasons ago from rank 20 with a mate and we were both playing the same matches and I was probably surviving slightly more then him but not massively. He ended the season as a rank 13 and I finished as a rank 1 after yoyoing between 1&amp;2 a few times. The only thing I can put it down to is that I was getting more iridescent medals at round end each match so I was ranking faster. You have to be fair across the board to work up. 
---
Plus you get put back to rank 10 if you are sub 10 end of season. 15 for 10-15 and 20 for anything above 15.
---
&gt;This is for me and my friends and we'd rather not dick on a random if it's just us.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by this, but if you want to do it just with friends, then you should watch Paulie Ester's turtorial on how to do it in KYF https://youtu.be/RlkDtYf5Aqs
---
Self care is still a viable perk to bring, especially if you're a solo survivor who doesnt want to rely on medkits or your teammates healing you instead of running off and dying themselves. You just have to choose when and where to use it.
---
I have Bloodletting , studded Jacket, Chuckles , Dweard and Sharp Mustache Jake.
---
AAaAAAaAaAaAAAaaAaaAaaAaAaAaAaaAaAaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Wtf are you blabbering.
---
I missed a golden opportunity with this
---
Adrenaline would be fine if it didn’t also wake you up. That’s too strong against a killer who already has massive issues. So yeah it needs a nerf for that
---
Mind game is when you can decide based on what you see. Just standing like a dumb idiot not knowing what the spirit is going to do is not called as talking part in mind games. It means to just pray that you are lucky that what you do ends up well.
---
I think so
---
Maybe a soft ban but I doubt that you'd get a perma ban. Not to mention BHVR still hasn't anything on the matter.
---
I love Feng much more than others, half of the reason is because of her voice while screaming

I agree, i feel like he needs a buff personally and on top of that build a weakness into his power so maybe turn the bleed out timer into a health bar instead that dont go down at all unless you get hit, remove the vaulting pallets make it just windows, Remove Frank's mix tape but in return 115% movement speed. Thats me personally
---
&gt;implying Bruce Campbell wasn't told to do a stupid ass meme scream for Ash
---
Having to run a Mori, especially an ebony, just to counter MoM is ridiculous, and unfun for survivors too lol. Thats not really a workaround. 
---
Note that I'm not necessarily saying MoM needs a nerf, its strong but I'm not sure where to place it atm.
---
Fun fact! The killer with other powers is still theoretically possible. However, Devs have done a pretty good job so far with their work with EAC. Props to them!
---
What camcam said. You got tinkerer 2 activated 1 time and didnt have a TR for the whole game. And it became a perk that was being used all the time until the fix. Every killer but doctor benefited from it
---
I will just quit the game if that shit happens.
---
No you wont get banned. 
---
Source: I use custom icons.
---
Yeah that’s true for ash but he moans like a pornstar when he is injured
---
You got real lucky that he didn't have DS.
---
Glad you got the survivor, though.
---
Weak survivors running crying for their MoM
---
&gt;You just have to choose when and where to use it.
---
It's better to bring a perk you know you can comfortably use whenever you want without being a hindrance to your team, like bond or aftercare.
---
&gt;Self care is still a viable perk to bring
---
Selfcare WAS viable, but the healing nerfs mean you just waste too much time. Now with the sloppy butcher meta, if you heal twice, that's an entire generator you could have done instead.
---
You forgot the main type. The type where the killer chases you and only you after you get unhooked.
---
I've heard people say doc isnt that good. His playstyle looks a lot of fun and I want to get him. But if hes lower tier that would kinda suck.
---
They’re making up how much they get camped. All of you do. That’s why. This is really the only vidya I play and I play it a lot. I know that camping isn’t as common as you people pretend
---
It gets harder when people do mean it sometimes
---
Would you rather they let you die?
---
PHARMACY
---
I think people forget in Clown's bio he used to be an a fit guy a long while ago before binging on unhealthy stuff, so I think the Entity just decided to tie in his atlhetic past with who he is now.
---
Epic
---
Haha, if you're not up for a discussion then why did you reply to my comment in the first place?
---
&gt;Lots of people still run self care
---
Less and less people run selfcare because they know how much goddamn time it wastes. It's now less prevalent than ever, but there are still some stubborn rank 12s who think it's a good perk for teamplay.
---
&gt;Like I said, I run MED KITS to fasten my healing
---
If you use medkits, why even have self-care on? You say you use it as a rebound, well how about instead of a "rebound" you pick a 4th perk that is actually useful and doesn't take up a precious perk slot.
---
The matter if the fact is, if you are using self-care, for up to a minute (running to find a good place to heal, sloppy butcher meta) you are entirely useless and it's now a 3v1 to do 5 gens. Get over it.
---
Dweard and Sharp Mustache Jake are all I have
---
Lmao you’re getting downvotes. I can only imagine the face of the salty person behind it.
---
&gt; When none of the survivors bring perks, they'll get destroyed, same as a killer with no perks.
---
That's not exactly true because unlike a survivor with no perks the killer can still use their base power with add-ons while a survivor with no perks is left with difficult choices like :do I take a medkit to heal,toolbox to do gens and sabo,flashlight to fight back,or a key to read auras ~~^(not much use of  a map.)~~
---
While a killer can run a certain build to get the job done like instadown huntress or trapper who doesn't really have defined perks to help him
---
Toxic and salty have lost all meaning on this sub. 
---
They're just general insults now for someone or something you don't like
---
My buddy is like this and he'll do it when I'm on the hook. It kills me every time.
---
Honestly ever since the ash update PS4 games have been better for me,  I can’t talk about other consoles though
---
I feel targeted
---
Yes but they legit said not to so your report just gets wasted
---
Ikr, the absolute dramatics in this thread. You can tell the narrative might be getting a little manipulated when the first attempted alternative they give to the meta build is a No Mither build.
---
Couldn’t agree more.  I’ve seen it myself lmao.
---
I played a killer game immediately after and got the same map but this time MY ruin totem spawned out in the open.
---
This game is just hilariously tragic sometimes.
---
Pass
---
You can now lol
---
The Nurse issue is a bug.
---
As a Freddy main, I run the following perks:  Ruin, Nurse's, BBQ, and Sloppy Butcher.  Add ons are usually Swing Chains or Rope and ALWAYS a drawing to extend the sleep range because most survivors are under the impression that Freddy's range is garbage.  Mine hits the range of the lullaby, if you can hear it, you're probably going to sleep.
---
When you get hit by a dream transition, run don't even worry about looking back count to 5 and do a 180 then juke like crazy in random directions.  9 out of 10 times the free hit will always miss.  Most survivors will try to loop and since I know that's the tactic, I usually just anticipate it and change my route to cut them off.  Self-care is something I WANT.  With my build, I just find them mid-heal and down them.  Be PAINFULLY aware of when you're being woken up or healed, if you're asleep, I can see you and your body posture will tell me if you're being healed or woken up.  I will prioritize you both and put your asses back to sleep.
---
I need people opinion on joey?
---
Am I the only one who thinks Jake's injured scream is most identifiable? He's the only one I can hit as killer like: WaAAaaAAaaAAGHAAaaGHah... "yea that's a Jake"
---
I fired up League for the first time in a couple years the other day. I was told to kill myself and get cancer 2 games in.
---
I agree
---
It's okay, that's the point of my memes. Self-care is less prevalent than ever now due to people realizing how much goddamn time it wastes after the healing nerf, but occasionally I see the red-rank Claudette self-caring in the corner of the map.
---
It's better for you and the team if you take off self-care and put on a perk like Iron Will, Bond, Aftercare, Adrenaline and just commit to gens.
---
That's a stupid logic. You want 4 survivors to hunt for 5 or 6 totems. Yeah, good way to waste time.
---
I'm secretly dropping beats.
---
Then equip DS and make sure to reach that skill check if you’re being tunneled. But most of the time people don’t know your plan. At the very least they are trying to help you escape with borrowed time. I dunno. I can’t honestly understand the frustration here. Sorry.
---
a lot of people aren’t when they shittalk swf or use swf as an excuse for toxic gameplay lol.
---
her squeal while doing totems is the best
---
Lmao yea I just use it because most teammates I get with aren’t helpful, I’m trying to get adrenaline, it just won’t pop up in the blood web
---
At least I can respect a No Mither, that takes some bravery.
---
If you are hiding in a corner of the map using self-care then I know you are just shit.
---
"JuSt DoNt BrInG gOoD ItEmS" So I'm supposed to just let them sit in my inventory all the time? No, that sounds dumb  
---
Plus, I'm pretty sure he JUST showed evidence of him doing it in KYF. The fact that he not only showed this bug and made sure not to do it in a public match makes it all the better.
---
Well good news, launching later today you can change your name on PS4 lol.
---
I pray to the Entity that you get adrenaline then soon.
---
Bs bug that BhVR is aware of but will wait to patch on the next dump! When any other game developer would temporarily block that character from being used or at least make the add ons blocked until it’s patched. But with BhVR they don’t care about people abusing glitches in the game...
---
It's 'farther' right? Further is for metaphorical distances. Could not come up with a better way to explain.
---
They announced that today you can change your name.
---
Yes me too
---
I would add on this list : Windows of Opportunity, Solidarity and Head On.
---
also if you win the game as a survivor don't forget to tell the killer how easy it was for you to escape and tell him how trash of a killer he is
---
And secretly stalking peeps.
---
Do you play Apex legends? When I try to grapple as Pathfinder to travel really good distances, I actually move my body 😣
---
Pharmacy + Ace In The Hole is a fucking joke, I swear - I get an insta heal every other trial.
---
Calm Spirit.
---
Overwhelming presence.
---
Hex : The third Seal.
---
Leader
---
Why oh God why
---
What, you thought it was bbq week ? Snap out of it
---
I am only level 35 with him and I have found the Doctor super effective on smaller maps with a huge terror radius but lacking when it comes to bigger maps. He is also a noob crusher, when people don't know his mechanics will freak out and make mistakes. One of the things that I love about him is his ability to find survivors because of his madness. I stuck at finding survivors and the doctor shores up that weakness for me. 
---
As for his tier placement I can see why people place him low to mid tier. He seems to not have the kill potential or movement abilities as some of the other killers.
---
And it stays closed for all subsequent games so you don't even have to race to close it.
---
I know, but Pharmacy by itself is most certainly a perk that helps a lot with my playstyle. If I find a box, I'm searching it, and Medkits are well worth stocking up on.
---
I'm on the sub daily, i really havent seen it much. People are whining for a good reason tho, its an issue. I also dont think survivors understand why its so bad. 4 MoMs is the worst thing ive ever played against in this game, other than 4 old ds, like when it first came out.
---
Damn
---
No hate the player who blatantly abuses a glitch and the shitty game developer for not blocking the add ons or killer until it patched! I DC on all legions now because of this, this has gotten out of hand. Tried playing against one yesterday and I sat there for 2 mins mending just to be hit again!
---
Lol. Didn't think you were gonna be an asshole when I replied. Plus you replied first.
---
I run self care because 90% of the time my teammates aren't helping me, plus I said that I'm *independent*. So self care is a must have. I don't actually care if less people run self care because that doesn't effect me. 
---
Spending one minute healing is better than spending 15 minutes injured; that sounds like a no brainer for me. I'd rather take up one minute of not being the objective than be hurt the whole game because no one will heal me. I like self care and will use it every time it's too bad if you don't like it, because I do. One minute isn't precious time if you spending 30 minutes in a game, or die before the game ends.
---
Self care rebound is important to me if I have no other way of healing, because if you haven't noticed med kits don't last that long typically. 
---
I don't know why you think you're going to change my mind by replying because honestly I don't care if you hate self care. It's very useful for me, I'm not going to switch it out for something that doesn't help me; that doesn't make sense. My perk setup is very helpful for me and I tend to win games with it. 
---
Also rank 7 not 12. Not stubborn if there's nothing to debate. Sos ✌🏼
---
Lol it’s all good I figured I would. It’s just amusing killers like Freddy still get bullied but so many survivors want to complain about fun. People need to learn to take the good with the bad.
---
my advice is hold your hatchet when chasing people until you know you can guaruntee a hit and when they are dodging just wait until they walk into your hatchet when you hold it
---
Killer mains whine about everything that’s an inconvenience that makes not getting a 4K every game easy.
---
Been done before
---
Did they change something with SWF and how they spawn into games? I played at least 10 games yesterday and 8/10 i spawned with my friend. And none of those games used the one offering
---
I think fat boi Jeff's is wrong man he's as loud as a freaking air horn I wear to god lol
---
Adam's struggle noises sound like he's clearing his throat.
---
I understand why it would be hard to believe, but this wouldn't be the first time this happened (just the first time in a long time since I moved my computer). My PC is right next to a window where my neighbor's house is pretty close by, and their living room windows are in direct LoS and pretty much always open (except in winter). Also, that scream was honestly a LOT louder IRL and I could hear it basically resound outside of my headphones which is pretty rare... so all that combined... yeah... hearing the knocking on the front door ~5-10 minutes after the match isn't exactly fun.

---
I looked it up, some sites says they're the same and others what you're saying. Didn't know the existance of "farther", but i'm going to use it. Thanks for the tip.
---
Lmao. You mean survivor mains? Do you play killer? Have you played against 4 MoMs? If you have youd get why its an issue.
---
Enduring is so easy to get. Are you on console ?
---
Yeah I’ve been considering running a perk that can substitute self care but I just feel like if I was to put bond or something like that on, it would still be wasted time finding the teammate and running over to them to heal. In that amount of time I feel like I could’ve just healed myself. Unless of course there’s sloppy butcher. Fuck sloppy butcher with self care. 
---
What do you think?
---
I prefer Bond if I'm looking for heals or waking up. The only time I use Self-care is when I'm running Resilience at 99% healed so I can finish the 1% heal solo.
---
I play Legion from time to time and I don't ever DC vs. Legion unless my team starts to DC already. I'd much rather try and genrush or at least juke a Feral Frenzy Legion than play vs. a Clown tbh.
---
make this a character
---
You don't use bond to find teammates, you just sit on a generator and wait until they appear within the perk radius. 
---
Once you see their aura (36 meters I think), then you leave the gen and get a heal off them. After healing you wave emote to lead them back to your generator.
---
This is why I personally like Aftercare more - I just sit on a generator and wait for someone to come to me.
---
the way to counter looping is hitting through pallets and breaking the pallet unless its an unsafe pallet i would say the only problem with pallets is the amount of safe pallets other than that i think its perfectly fine and safe windows
---
The discrepancy compared to survivors is also annoying.  Escape is much easier than 4k+doublepip.
---
A friend of mine changed his Myers portrait to shirtless and most he gets is the odd "EAC has detected modified files, please verify the integrity of the game files to continue playing", I've changed my David portrait and had nothing so far.
---
The devs have said they see nothing wrong with it but they said they're not going to help you if you get banned for it.
---
I hate when I have We'll Make It and I unhook someone and they take off across the map to god knows where as I follow behind then they start self caring for a couple seconds before they let me heal them
---
Range addons counter this fyi.
---
Agreed!
---
for real
---
Madness tier 4
---
No problem. By the way, it is "few" sites. Few is for things that can be counted. "Some" is for those that can't be counted😊
---
I swear to god if I see another survivor playing the game in any shape or form then I'm disconnecting immediately!!
---
Oh yes, let me trade the ability to heal myself for, uh, faster gen repair while injured? Not to mention none of those are mutually exclusive.
---
You mean BDSM is the second meaning?
---
Killer variety already sucks ass, they shouldn’t release perks that make me see even more Billy’s and huntresses, and the occasional spirit or Myers.
---
WTH 😑
---
I don't understand why all the survivors post-Adam seem so loud in general. Like Most of them elicit a small "Oof" of some kind if they jump out of a high place, whereas Jeff is just "UUUAAAGGH" about it. Their breathing seems louder, too.
---
So I don't get revealed by Nurse's Calling?
---
Why headache?
---
Am I one of the rare few who don't give a fuck? Lol.
---
That's something really thicc
---
Yea you did but.its still funny
---
Reminds me of MCote saying to go play another game. Terrible logic
---
Haha, joking, thank you.
---
Glad you enjoyed it :D
---
I can't tell if this is a meme or not because it's quite accurate
---
I like the adrenaline quite much. Nice job for such a short time :D
---
Or could just learn to loop and do gens injured, just a thought tho. 👁️💋👁️
---
Yeah...if I see an Ash in my game I tend to bring a Mori and ensure he's the first to die. I know, toxic but dealing with that perk is mad annoying so I get rid of the possibility as early as I can.
---
Where are these tier lists made from?
---
Thanks, I like how the devs designed it so I drew it (:
---
Enduring can be easily gotten from Hillibilly at level 30. Plus hes one of the strongest killers out there so hes really worth learning and leveling up. To be fair its better to spend iridescent shards on new characters instead of perks you can get without paying, especially on a killer you already have unlocked. If you dont like grinding im afraid this game wont be for you on the long run
---
We've tried to do so on Xbox One but it never works for us. We're meaning Public because the community of Australia is small and it's easy to find each other.
---
Name changes are active now??
---
This thread is total bullshit, just shows how loud the survivor majority can be when they feel entitled
---
I play more survivor now than ever, in red ranks and have no issues surviving, and I think it’s funny I run 2 of those perks you mentioned. Shit Lithe + DWM and iron will is near OP if you know how to mindgame it
---
Imagine not being on a gen for 45 seconds.
---
People can self care in a corner all they want, but when there is a more opportune play such as an unhook while another is being chased, or doing the last gen while killer is tunneling someone then we got ourselves a problem.
---
I heard it will come tomorrow on EU store. It is currently active in the US though.
---
I don't get why you think that knowing how to loop and using Self-Care is mutually exclusive.
---
My bad got a little salty.
---
I love the show, never seen the movies sadly
---
What’s wrong with self care I’m confused
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Blood warden because it makes survivors go D A R N
---
FUCK THE SPIRIT. SHE’S ALMOST AS ANNOYING AS LEGION. WHY ISN’T THIS TALKED ABOUT
---
With the amazing emblem system you have to always go for saves if you want to pip. So pretty much if a killer camps everyone's depiping...
---
u/vreddit_bot ?
---
I don't know how to do it on public matches, I did not have the ability to test it out myself
---
Does anyone know if those Christmas sweaters are made into real sweaters? I would love to wear Feng's purple sweater.
---
My bf and I do swf on PS4, we were playing together and spawned near a Leatherface's Ruin totem. He worked the gen nearby, I took down the totem, immediately Leatherface comes by so I dip...not long after, my bf gets hooked and killer camps the absolute shit out of him. Funny enough, he didn't camp anyone else. My bf messaged him after the game asking why he only camped him... the response? "You took out my Ruin not even a minute into the game"
---
I, of course, lost my shit laughing bc he didn't even take it out but the moral of the story here is some killers will camp for no reason and we just have to deal with it 🤷
---

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
Lol you blame survivors for the hatch standoff entirely by "camping it" but your fix is to simply give it to killers automatically who camp it instead?  Not only is this post a legit terrible idea, it's hypocrisy at its finest.  At a hatch standoff you're both camping it and you're both to blame.  You don't deserve it anymore than they do so don't frame it like you do and the games mechanics should simply cater to that.
---
And this is why we cant have nice queue times
---
Yeah when that happens it's like the killer is thinking that that bps are just for him alone lol
---
Pretty much every pallet is a safe pallet. There’s also that window vault that leads to the bottom floor killers are forced to go down to catch the survivor
---
I JUST LOVE GETTING A ‘KILL BY YOUR OWN HAND’ RITUAL ON A KILLER I DON’T HAVE A MORI ON, IT’S ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE OPEN THE EXIT GATE RITUAL THAT MY TEAMMATES DO BEFORE I GET THERE.
---
Oh fair enough, thank you, I don’t play Feng enough.
---
Ran into a Legion yesterday who was using the exploit with the blade add-ons. I've never left a game so fast in my life.
---
You know what's the quickest way to a hook? 
---
Doing gens injured.
---
Its most likely that the survivors are losing connection to you since your internet isn’t good. You are still connected to the servers but your connection can’t support hosting games
---
Ash update, more like crAsh update
---
That's why it's better to use perks that synergize with being injured.
---
Spending up to a minute to heal is never a good choice. Time is a precious resource for survivors to lose, which is strange because usually, they dictate the pace of a match.
---
There's no way in hell will I be able to get this achievement for Myers. His perks are odd when all used together and I highly doubt I am getting merciless killer using them.
---
How so?
---
You know what's the slowest way to a hook?
---
Hiding in the corner of the map and being useless.
---
Same outcome, but you've just wasted everyone's time.
---
Rip
---
Bond is one of the best perks in the game. It has many others valuable uses too
---
&gt; but there is insta down killers and add ons for other killers to make it easier for them.
---
The survivor is able to escape all of these things. MoM generally cannot be avoided
---
Well its almost impossible playing against him if he's any good. Or then I'm just bad at the game but I don't know
---
I agree. Even when I play SWF I still use that perk. It's a two-way wallhack for the entire team from you.
---
big fax
---
WHY THE FUCK CAN'T THEY REVERT BACK TO THE OLD MATCHMAKING SYSTEM ON PS4??? IT TAKES 10-20 GODDAMN MINUTES TO FIND A GAME WITH ONE FRIEND, ONLY TO GET TUNNELLED BY A SWEATY NURSE [REEEEEEEEE](/intensifies)
---
We all hate farmers and shitty legions as well buddy so right back at ya.
---
Just get good at looping. Doesnt matter if you're tier 3 and he cant catch you.
---
Holy shit thats actually amazing
---
Lmfao I see more people run Bond+Urban and be braindead in chases and more people run SC+DH/BL and do really well in chases than the other way around. Then again, I'm red rank every season and play 10 hours a day. Someone at a lower rank who doesn't play very often might think otherwise.
---
I USE THE FUCKING SMOKING SPLINTER AND HALF THE FUCKING SURVIVORS DC! AS HAPPY AS I AM TO GET A FREDDY 4K IT’S JUST DISAPPOINTING
---
So hostile haha
---
I don't really have a problem with him, unless he 3 gen traps us that shit is ♋.
---
Most of the time it IS the players fault. If killer is camping hatch, go do totems/gens and force them to come look for you, don't just wander over and force a stalemate.
---
The complete lack of counter play is the issue. With the exception of Hag and Spirit, most M1 killers have the lowest map pressure or their power doesn't help in a chase (Wraith, Clown, Freddy, etc...) therefore they need to end chases as soon as possible. MOM only extends the chase and punishes a killer for doing exactly what they're supposed to do. I don't want to play Billy every game and focus on only chainsawing. 
---
I don't mind Adrenaline because it punishes all killers equally and unless I'm slugging there's a good chance I'll only have to worry about it punishing me with one survivior because usually I'm not chasing two. I don't understand the issue with Dead Hard, just bait it out and it's like any other exhaustion perk, smart survivors know how to use it and kudos to them. Desicive is just anti tunnel right now, which is fine. However, Metal just exists and there nothing you can do about it as killer. It extends chases for the killer. Killers are on a time crunch and fighting the clock, survivors aren't.
---
Your problem is that you assume that a player's choice of perks defines their playstyle. Have you considered that Self-Care is also a tool against those same immersed players that you complain about? If they're hiding, they're not healing me, so being able to do that myself at a significant time cost is better than nothing, IMO.
---
Yeah that Opportunity Cost, where many perks are good in some way, but you can't afford **not** to take better perks. I wonder if some sort of sideboarding feature could mitigate that. 
---
You put 4 perks into your loadout, and set an additional 2 perks as your "sideboard". Then you have something like 30 seconds once the game starts to replace 1 of your perks with the sideboarded perk. Granted you won't necessarily know who your killer is 30 seconds in, but I think a strict time limit could limit abuse where you make use of a perk then ditch it for your sideboarded one.
---
NOED can be prevented from even activating.
---
Devour is very vulnerable
---
MyC and Haunted are on a timer and more often than not don't yield results.
---
MoM is essentially unavoidable
---
&gt;I will run selfcare with at least a yellow medkit with green addons.
---
How many yellow medkits do you have? And is the perk good if it requires an uncommon item with rare addons each time?
---
&gt;what do I do when my team is a rotten potato and either won't heal me or sucks at skill checks?
---
If your team can't heal you and they also can't do gens, then what are you healing yourself for? Nobody is doing the objective and you will die anyway, using self-care just wastes everyone's time.
---
&gt;What do I do when the legion sees that I'm hurt and decides to just m1 me?
---
That's why it's best to use perks that synergize with being injured instead of using self-care. Take Iron Will, Dead Hard, Resilience...
---
Honestly rocking a gamertag like that alone should be enough to catch a soft ban.
---
Didn't work, did it?
---
Except that you perpetuated the silly notion that he tunnels, which many inexperienced players say.  He doesn't tunnel, and if you've watched him with any sort of regularity, you'd know this.
---
&gt;Ok but let’s say I get hit by the killer and they either leave me or lose me.
---
Okay, I'm imagining the scenario.
---
&gt;I could self care
---
No, that wastes too much time.
---
&gt;or waste my time trying to find teammates to heal and take them off of the objectives to get my heals.
---
Also no, that wastes too much time as well.
---
Where's the third option for me to pick, the smart option? Do a generator and wait for a survivor to find you.
---
Not really. Iridescents are hard to come by (not as quickly as bloodpoints anyway). Especially if you have bbq
---
Thank you for this, makes me want to play again. Now if only people would quit disconnecting in a fit of pique ...
---
Gee, it must be hard always knowing more than anyone else.
---
Absolutely awesome. Needs more shirtless, but awesome nonetheless.
---
Oh yea because me dodging a few lobbies is why matchmaking is broken
---
100% agree. I’ve had adrenaline pop mid Freddy lunge and I felt like a piece of shit and let him kill me. That’s way too strong against a killer who already has to work extra hard to secure kills.
---
yeah huntress is definently better than clown but it does take skill to know where to put the gas down during loops to slow them down thats the importance of using his power and he can interrupt survivors taking people off a hook if they unhook right when they get hooked to get a hit thats the application of his power
---
The roblox forums got deleted after a YTer called Quackity got banned. They even censor the term "Quackity".
---
I know that. 
---
They were just toxic as hell.
---
The only killers will be the chainsaws, huntress, Plague, and I think maybe Legion? that will counter MoM the way you're stating (I'm not counting Myers because he does a lot of tier 2 attacking and tier 3 takes too much work to actually be a MoM counter) so it's a far cry from "at least 7"
---
also MoM is terrible for Hag no matter how good the player is. MoM requires a chase and she is not a chase killer. Hag is *exceptionally* weak to stacked MoM
---
The Nurse did it and forged your name on the paperwork.
---
removed as someone just posted this before ya https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bbndkq/survivor_pipping_thresholds_upcoming_changes/
---
Annoyed usually. He's a good killer, and for the most part is balanced, but the doctor illusions are overpowered as fuck.
---
The devs know? That's news to me lol
---
lmao none of them can convince me self care is a good perk in 2019. literally wastes so much time just do gens and you'll all get out as long as you're good at looping.
---
if you're not good at looping, that's your problem not lack of self heal.

But the old STBFL wasn't token based, was just another form of Relenting before being patched to remove the Machine Gun build
---
Yet I still lose a PIP when killer rage quits 🤦🏼‍♂️
---
They also made a couple of bug fixes:
---
* Fixed an issue that caused the Cleansing audio to play multiple times when a Survivor cleansed from a fountain.
---
* Fixed an issue that made it impossible to Ready/Unready in the lobby when another client left after the 15 second timer.
---
* Fixed an issue that caused a temporary broken pre-lobby screen when backing out of the Twitch Challenges menu before it had finished loading.
---
I've actually experienced this glitch before. It's weirder working on a generator and suddenly being picked up and slung over a shoulder whilst still working on a generator.
---
Genuinely thought I'd been pulled off it for a second.
---
“Isn’t thrown around much in other games”
---
Clearly you’ve never heard of
---
Rust, COD, TF2, Overwatch, R6 Siege, pretty much any game like LoL or Dota, toxic is overused in nearly every game
---
I've escaped a number of matches in like 4 minutes
---
Anything is an improvement over the original Pet Sematery film. The acting in that was a dumpster fire.
---
Everyone says SWF as Killer is gay but personally I love it. Free hits, dumb as fuck plays from Survivors, and the salt at the end of the game is godly.
---
Yeah you need 4k and I think you gotta double pip now too which is dumb
---
I could've afforded them a few months ago on ebay, nowadays they're way too expensive because they're not releasing codes anymore. Which is, stupid? Just release them 4Head?
---
I think DBD is fine, you can check here for games with no known issues:
---
https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/onlineid/games-list-home/no-known-tested-issues/
---
My issue is I don't see how they can balance the mechanic.  I think it's just one of those things we have to live with.  As a killer main I understand why survivors need the option of the hatch after 2 gens.  If your team is shit, regardless of how good you are the hatch is your only option.  You couldn't repair multiple gens  against a killer unless they're 87% potato.  If you tried tying the hatch to a key mechanic on the map like they originally contemplated it doesn't change anything the killer could still camp the hatch and grab you when you used the key.  Honestly I don't believe in hatch standoffs.  They waste time, fun, bloodpoints etc...I do my best to find them before they get to the hatch but if they make it there I just hit them out.  The way I play (avoid camps and tunnels) I pip easily off a 3K anyway so I never feel the need to sweat out the 4 man at a standoff.  I just don't see a fair way to balance it one way or the other so it's one of those things I just grudgingly accept.
---
i was also thinking they could use a priest character, that one that the clown's stage refers to, Father Cambell i think it was? maybe a thin old guy with glasses in that long black priest coat, giving him a very straight silhouette
---
can't say i blame them.. this game is shit now
---
Pipping changes
---
Yeah, it's really just that one issue. Whenever I mention this survivor mains flip out and scream "oh what so survivors can't have any good perks!!!!??" and I'm like no because Adrenaline will still be extremely strong without it
---
A lot of people really have no interest whatsoever in genuine game balance
---
But I just had a 3k and got the trophy. I didn't see if I double pipped because I accidentally exited the match. Maybe that's it? I would have thought you would need a 4k to double pip but maybe it's just getting a lot of hooks?
---
Whats the changes?
---
By not going in the basement, and I wish I was kidding.
---
I really love the detail on him. Great job!!

literally everyone says ngl lol wtf

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/55352/patch-notes-2-6-3-ash-vs-evil-dead
---
Scroll down and you can see 2.6.4 patch notes
---
Good idea but i would switch hex: toth with thanatophobia and third seal with bbq. Also this build is stupid op so have fun making survivors dc
---
why not? the perks serve different purposes
---
Tunneling is focusing specifically on one survivor and passing up opportunities to address the other survivors until after the tunneled survivor is hooked or dead.
---
But if he's good and shocks you before you vault or drop a pallet
---
Only after visiting this sub did I realize that somehow spamming crouch was offensive to people.
---
When I started I used it pretty much exclusively for communication. And even if it is used in a "toxic" way I feel like its nothing more than "nanana you cant catch me" when playing catch as kids :D. Is it cocky? Sure, but should you really get offended by something like that?
---
Its cause u used freedy
---
ALL KILLERS SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE GAME SO SURVIVORS CAN DO GENS IN PEACE AND LEAVE
---
Hatch standoffs should favor the survivor imo because technically the killer is holding the game hostage when not using his m1 on a healthy survivor. Holding a game hostage is against the rules
---
Hopefully later on today. They skipped  2 weeks of no cosmetics..smh
---
He's just an annoying killer but he is middle of the road to weak on the tier list.  His power only helps him so much in chases, he's largely a tracking killer so he is just as susceptible to looping as most of the rest.  I don't mind playing him it just means I have to pay extra attention on the skillchecks.
---
I think it’s great honestly
---
Well they both are there to save you a hit from the killer and I would rather use dead hard bc I can use it many times and you dont really have space for two perks that kinda have the same purpose
---
You do realize the killer does not have to lunge right?
---
GODAMMIT !
---
You're fired Sally !
---
You do need a 4K, it sounds to me that this person got lucky with a bug
---
Until dawn was extremely entertaining... For about 3 hours, then you beat it agian as opposite as you can and then the game is an extremely boring only useful for an easy plat trophy.
---
If you're aware he can do that then you need to plan for it. You're allowing it to happen. Pay attention to what his range and charge time is and play accordingly
---
Dbd is good they have it under the list of no issues found
---
Everything in moderation lad.
---
I don't use exclusively meta perks because I don't like to be boring. Wins are nice, but as long as everyone does their best and aren't immersed block heads then I'm good. I mostly build around what agitates me the most at a given time, or the occasional chest build to loot shit.
---
First free next and going forward 10 bucks but ps plus members can do it for 5 bucks
---
If there was a mod with multiple killers that’s what the legion was made for.
---
Yeah but you can always dead hard behind him/her or away or any direction you want to buy the extra time and you almost always get the first dead hard and then you can use it to get a few seconds extra still better in my opinion
---
How do you get unhooked if you only started with 2 people and one DC-ed instantly?
---
Taken long enough.
---
I’m not even gonna lie, I lowkey get close to the screen when I start getting really close to a survivor 😂 Don’t even realize until I hook them and sit back.
---
You were ripped to shreds on this last time you posted anti-self care BS.
---
implying Bruce Campbells scream wouldn't sound like that anyway
---
Okay this is really awesome. Do you have a parts list for the generator?
---
Which is why my posts get on the front page with 100+ votes in less than a few hours. I only got downvoted in the comments by salty Claudettes.
---
Good idea but this build is stupid? Wut?
---
Wendigo's power could be that i mimicks survivor noises and loses it's terror radius while using it. Like a non invisible Spirit in terms of jumpscares. Or Joshua as an improvised Trapper type.
---
That’s the point of his post. It’s an absolute insane shitshow.
---
It gets a little hairy with a Pallet or vault in the mix, but otherwise yes.
---
Those are dead, I'm pretty sure Dwight and Feng were drunk when they disappeared. Jake and Meg disappeared in the forest. Anyone add more or correct me
---
Leatherface in The Game where I found 3 survivors in the bathroom, manage to down the 3 and shortly found the 4 near the area with 5 gens up. In the end I juiced everyone out of seccond hook but let the 3 live (Claudette gave up struggling)

Genius alert. Some ps4 games actually support m/kb completely, no adapter necessary. There seems to be some incomplete support in this game for it, which is why I asked.

I HATE WHEN IM TRYING TO TEACH MY FRIENDS THE GAME, BUT THEY GET DOWNED IMMEDIATELY AND PROCEED TO GET FACE CAMPED BECAUSE WE GET RANK 20 KILLERS

I just want to see how the hair looks in-game.
---
He doesn’t play anti-toxic though....
---
He plays non-efficient and silly...
---
If you're close enough to a pallet or window there is no counterplay from the killer.  This is usually how I use my Dead Hard to reach the safety I couldn't otherwise.
---
They're team based games where every mistake gets amplified over time, and although they're usually over in the first 5-10 minutes they can still take upwards of 20-30 minutes to actually end.
---
Even if you're good, a bad team mate can tip the scales. And you're probably not good, and you probably don't even know it or know how to get better.
---
Is there a picture or something of these new cosmetics?

If you won't take it from me, take it from people who have literally thousands of hours in this game. Is Noob3 the type of person who lets everyone die on the hook? Is Panda the type of person who never runs helpful team perks? Is Tru3 the type of person to never take a hit to save someone?
---
I'm starting a revolution. The type of people who still think self-care is viable are rank 20 plebs.
---
Look who's shitting in the tall grass.
---
:( Just once?
---
i just like the skirt, not a fan of the top or head piece
---
you could take them on a custom game and show them how to kinda loop and stuff like I always do
---
You should know by now that killer changes take a backseat to survivor changes. Standard practice.
---
Getting 3 kills is great, and 4k is the ultimate. 99% of killers believe that the faster you wreck a team, the better you have done and the more points you should get. BHVR believes the exact opposite of the killer community and wants you to purposely extend chases for little to no reason except to spare the feelings of survivors. You're punished for being too good as killer and handcuffed by it with the Chaser category.
---
That’s why I’m always suspicious when people do this. It’s happened before several times...but it always sucks when it happens.
---
ofc you have Space.
---
And Mettle of Men should be used more like a Borrowed Time/Decisive Strike
---
LEGION AND DCS!!!!...THAT IS ALL!
---
Click the prestige button in the middle of the bloodweb once they’re level 50

Oh no. I’m the team killing fucktard!
---
Is this real
---
When I used DH to just avoid lunges and shit I wasn't impressed with the perk. Now when I run it I usually use it to get to a window or pallet and I like DH for that reason.
---
I hope you know that I'm going to remind you of that reaction for the rest of your life, my dude.
---
I think the supposed compromise is the Shrine of Secrets, but there are a staggering amount of useless dogshit perks out there and it's likely we'll get trash (like this week, actually.)
---
I tried to recreate the until dawn intro with dbd: 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYRxSkMG2Fk
---
But I wish dbd will get a crossover, but since until dawn is playstation exclusive I doubt, but we might get a crossover with the upcoming game they are working on called "Man of Maden"
---
I feel like you should get bonus chaser points if you incapacitate a survivor outside of a chase. Since it basically means you downed them before the next chase even started. Especially since quite a few killers can do this.
---
Actually i think you missed the final experiment where we did try to save people and killers only got 25 kills out of 100 games lol
---
He's one of the more fun killers to go against for me.
---
Nobody is blaming survivor players for using busted perks like Mettle of Man, the complaints are directed toward BHVR and it's nonsensical design.
---
Ok. Don’t wake the survivors up. But leave it otherwise. 
---
You guys are perfectly capable of making adrenaline not activate. Don’t let the survivors get to the end. 
---
Also no they don’t have tons of great perks. 
---
Here’s a list of garbage perks off the top of my head
---
Ace in the hole 
---
Leader 
---
Calm spirit
---
Saboteur 
---
We’ll make it 
---
Streetwise 
---
Windows of Opportunity 
---
Boil Over 
---
Deja Vu 
---
Technician 
---
Dark Sense
---
That's fair. Kate's is actually pretty scary.
---
Probably going to get sacrificed but seems worth to me.
---
It’s borrowed time and DS lol
---
So anything about game breaking bugs? Like Legion mending?
---
Suck my dick.
---
IF you run DS you deserve to be camped.
---
I'm gonna new a surge on the left mask, it looks so good!
---
This attitude is what is so frustrating dude. You and an entire category of players *cannot accept playing the game without self care*. You cant imagine it. Youre so closed minded to the possiblity that your play style might not be optimal for your team. Get out of your comfort zone for once.

FUNNY THING IS THAT BHVR DID SOLVE THE MATCHMAKING ON PS4. WHEN PLAGUE WAS OFFICIALLY RELEASED, THEY UPDATED THE MATCHMAKING AND IT WAS GLORIOUS. 30-60 WAITING TIMES AND IT WAS CONSISTENT. 
---
THE DOWNSIDE WAS THAT RANKS WERE MISMATCHED, BUT I DON’T CARE. RANK ONLY SHOWS THE TIME YOU PUT INTO DBD FOR THE CURRENT MONTH. ITS WASN’T A TRUE INDICATOR OF SKILL. BUT WHATEVER, PC CROWD COULDN’T HANDLE IT FOR WHATEVER REASON AND NOW BHVR SWITHED IT BACK TO THE PRE-PLAGUE MATCHMAKING.
---
My dude, please stop giving me clips of various streamers and their opinions. While I respect those players and the levels at which they play? They aren't making a very good argument for why players are bad if they choose otherwise. Make your own argument if you're demanding points of view from other players and don't appeal to authority.
---
If someone on my team wants to heal themselves, that's a good move in my mind. You're fully free to disagree on the effectiveness of that decision, but the perk has its place in the playstyles of the player base. I'm not arguing that No Mither or Mettle of Man don't have their improvements over Self Care, but it's a stretch to be insulting over the choice.
---
Drop a pallet on her
---
Its called DBD:R and its on android. I dont know if its on iphone or not. My friend recommended it to me. Toy can save builds and get completly random ones for both survivor and killer.
---
...listing only 11 perks that are “garbage” does not prove that survivors do not have tons of great perks. And including We’ll Make It in that list leads me to believe you’re not going to be rational about this because that perk is *fantastic*. Also Dark Sense and Leader are not like S tier, but they are good. (Dark Sense works quite well with Poised in a gen jocky build)
---
I'm sorry, Nurse. Feng Min is gone now.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system it says it on there
---
Then, my dude, please stop wondering why I am calling out players who make ineffective decisions if I am fully free to do that.
---
Probably along he lines of "DLC will fix it!"
---
Wow, you must be really cool to get so many upvotes.
---
Holding the game hostage is toxic game play. 
---
There's a big difference between playing in an unexpected way, and playing in a toxic way, but it definitely exists.
---
Abusing the game mechanics specifically with the aim of ruining the fun of the other players is toxic game play in my eyes.
---
I likely speak for virtually everyone when I say a game mode with multiple killers and more survivors.
---
I only brought in the upvote argument when he used it. I suppose you better reply to him too.
---
BLOODPOINT GRIND!!!!! REEEE!!! I WANT A 10x BLOODPOINT EVENT AND I WANT IT NOW!!
---
That sounds like so much fun
---
doctor's one of the worst killers in the game  
---
the only real use of his power is finding survivors and blocking you from dropping pallets and jumping windows  
---
you can just throw them a bit earlier and bait windowzaps
---
Obviously the 2 vs 8
---
That explains hit box
---
Okay.
---
Thats not necessarily true. People who wont heal right off hook wont do it because theyre afraid the killer will come back,  whereas if there is a gen with no terror radius, they're not worried.
---
Sounds like a good time
---
Freddie Mercury as a survivor (or killer) would be pretty cool.
---
I always gotta mute my headset whenever I hook a Feng or Claudette
---
Well played.
---
An option to not have event music playing on the main menu. I like the event music and all, but it stays for way too long, and happens with every new chapter. I'd love to just have an option to play the regular music in the menu.
---
Take your upvote.
---
?
---
Another idea I had was a sort of dungeon crawl where survivors had to solve puzzles to unlock one of various exits. I'd want for this to also have a plethora of survivors and 2 or 3 killers.
---
maybe thats a hint on what the next killer power will be.
---
Thanks.
---
It's gonna take a minute for a paid DLC perk to start getting into the meta, but it's starting to. Streamers are starting to see it a lot
---
That’s a good idea, it does get annoying.
---
funny? dunno. i hate her screams...claudette mains deserve to get hooked, but.. meh i dont want to &lt;.&lt;
---
Collectable cosmetic mori animations.
---
Devil's advocate: If a killer is wrecking a team super fast, it's probably because of the survivors' lack of skill, not because the killer is amazing. In that case, survivors deserve to depip and liller should stay where they're at until up against survivors that are evenly matched  - at which point if killer is able to beat them, they can pip up.
---
I love to watch these guys and I have learned a lot from them. Tru3 said it best, it depends on the situation. If I combo my perk and item I can get back to the gen vs. running around to find someone or sitting on the gen and hoping to God that the killer doesn't find me. What I have learned is that everyone does not have the same idea of what makes the game fun for them and will the play the way that best suits them. I do not believe that camping with insidious is fun but Angrypug does, and will probably continue to do so no matter what anyone says because that is what makes the game fun for him.
---
Shit I always confuse that one and the one that lets you do altruism after the gates are open. That one is shit. Leader is pretty garbage and Dark Sense is a budget alert.
---
A puzzle game mode sound interesting
---
It's not that bad. Yes, unlocking EVERY SINGLE teachable perk and acquiring every perk on every character would take an extremely long time. But, why would you even do that? 
---
Unlock the items you care about, acquire them on your favorite character.
---
I actually do lean forward a bit when chasing Survivors, dunno why I think I'll catch them quicker when I'm not in the same world.
---
Why are you using so many crutch perks?
---
I’m not good I need to be able to take the hit. I’m still gonna save the guy on the hook after; why is healing bad?
---
I do that sooo much lol
---
Just make sure not to mention that Noob3 and Tru3 have been using self care as of late.
---
i don't like using self-care.
---
I prefer that my teammates heal because they get bp and emblem,and i like using bond
---
? 1:20minute to mend is not how its supposed to be
---
Leader is not garbage. It really does make a difference. You can't just insist upon it and make it true. Leader has gotten gates open for me in serious crunch time.
---
Dark Sense, as I just said and you ignored, is good for a gen jocky build when you synergise with other perks.
---
Like, this is the issue. Survivor mains literally only see a perk as good if it can contribute to a tank build. None of you are willing to be creative or try things out
---
Doc can force a 3 gen. As can any killer under the right circumstances but doc and legion excel at it.
---
I'll make sure to mention that, on the rare occasion they do use it, they use it right - not hiding in the corner of a map like 99% of other self-care users. End of the day, they both agree that it wastes a lot of time.
---
They adjusted pip threshold for survivor this morning.
---
I'm saying theres no clip or anything. Least for me.
---
That would be cool, also item skins for survivor items
---
What's funny is they still use Self Care and you can watch them do it on stream, they just do it differently.
---
Bitch dont be talking down about Jake 
---
If you were in his shoes youd be crying in the corner without injury
---
Whenever you pick the Scooby Doo chapter killer, you're randomly given another killer to use in the trial. If you don't get a 4k, you're unmasked at the end to reveal you're busy a grumpy old man.
---
REWARDS FOR RANK. even if its just a damn cosmetic, or item. like give me an incentive to grind, especially with the way the new rank and match making have been set up.
---
Thats awesome. I wanted to change mine for a while now :)
---
It is never ok to DC, with the possible exception of terrible ping. IF you DC because you got  hooked early, you are just being a little bitch.
---
4k without all gens getting done (has to last 9 mins IIRC, not sure if they changed it), prevent almost every heal, 0 camping, have to at least 2-hook everyone. Have to m1 a lot because instadowns bad.
---
I really like this
---
I’ve been watching Tru3’s YouTube clips every other day and up until Ash, he was basically running self care in every survivor build. Not sure rare means what you think it means.
---
Whats pip?
---
I posted this somewhere else here.
---
&gt;I'll make sure to mention that, on the rare occasion they do use it, they use it right - not hiding in the corner of a map like 99% of other self-care users. End of the day, they both agree that it wastes a lot of time.
---
So yes they do it differently - they do it effectively.
---
I don't know how that would work. Items go by really fast. Maybe if each item addon edited the appearance of the initial item.
---
I'll be attempting as many as I can after the next rank reset
---
Well, it wont get the reporter in trouble, it just wont do anything to the person that DC'd.
---
So you're saying they use self-care.
---
Just test it out. Its a bug, I dont need a clip, where I mend 1:20min. Just take a friend, get into a game with him and test it. Probably anyone is gonna do it now anyways.
---
But like you shouldn’t need a whole build to make one perk good. I’m not going to take Dark Sense when I can take something that is more worthy and useful. (Like we’ll make it).
---
Leader is very situational and outclass able with other perks. Prove thyself is much better and useful if you want a perk of that nature
---
They get data mined (found in game files) after every major patch usually. The latest are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O2pERy1GRn4tFZwKcN1FQkwVllDOtmyQbDXJGo7kGzA/mobilebasic)
---
I posted this somewhere else.
---
Honestly after finally unlocking Bond, I don’t get how more people don’t use it. It’s SO handy when looking for someone to heal you, or watching where a chased survivor is leading the killer, letting you keep work on gens or take a hit. 
---
I was getting kind of bored of my survivor build (UE, Adren, WGLF for the points and then a chest perk) but with Bond it’s a new way to play the game. I’m actually a fan of all of Dwight’s perks tbh, just seems like a different approach than the “gens/self care/hide” meta.
---
+1 and apparently, I ran dead hard and used it, I get called toxic and Myers just body blocks me at basement stairs and AFKs for 30mins, and then post-game chat.. the Myers told me I'm cyberbullying and being toxic when I don't even have flashlight(and repeatedly flicks it) nor do i teabag.
---
It's just a harmless dead hard.... I'd guess killers now dislikes when a survivor ran away from them.
---
Of course you got upvoted. All the killers here would love for people to follow your advice. It halfs the length of every chase.
---
Self care is *never* slower than finding a teammate to heal you. It doesn't make a difference if you spend  a base 16 seconds each from 2 survivors (19 with Mangled) or a base 32 seconds from one (38 with Mangled). Modifiers don't make a difference because they affect both equally. What does make a difference is not having to spend unneccessary time injured or searching for another survivor.
---
Sloppy Butcher and other Mangled options add a lowly *6.4* seconds to a heal. Coulrophobia only affects you if you're dumb enough to heal in terror radius with it. Thanatophobia applies the same 4% penalty to gens as to healing, so spending *1.3* extra seconds self-healing saves *3.2* seconds of gen time.
---
The only times a survivor shouldn't Self Care if they can is when a) they could quickly finish off a gen while the killer is in a chase, b) they could get a safe unhook, or c) there's already a survivor right next to them who isn't doing a gen and is willing to heal.
---
Self care is particularly good when paired with perks like:
---
Iron Will: lets you heal under the killers nose and immediately resume a chase
---
Borrowed Time: lets you give the finger to campers even if you were already injured and your team is otherwise occupied with gens or being dead or escaped.
---
Mettle of Man: lets you completely avoid the penalty of MoM and carry something other than a med kit, like a toolbox. Especially useful vs Franklin's Demise.
---
Well the skin wouldn’t go away with it, once you have the skin equipped it should stay on every flashlight you get for example.
---
Well, no, they do what I was talking about, which is use it when appropriate. Which is why self care is still viable. People who misuse it are idiots, the perk itself is still a smart choice when you're not with friends.
---
I've been DCing a lot lately as surv tbh. If my teammates play like shit (dropping god-pallets early, going into corners of the map to self-care, wasting the fountains vs plague etc.) I'm out of the match instantly. 
---
Also Nurse is an almost indefinite DC from me right now.
---
Though I also dont play surv a lot anymore since it's gotten really fucking boring for me.
---
It was on the list of games with no known issues, as was F13
---
I'm not a fan of the 2v8 idea. That just divides the playerbase into separate modes, making matchmaking that much harder. 
---
Instead, I'd love to have cross platform play, which would have the opposite affect on matchmaking (if you choose to turn it on)
---
I really hope so, I need Kate and Meg’s new ones
---
Okay I must have missed it, thank you
---
I'm never playing Doctor again that's for sure.
---
The perk fucking ruins killers that cant avoid stacking it.
---
RIP
---
Yes its bugged.
---
Someone has to supervise
---
Good point, maybe they just make it only possible to play 2v8 for a certain period of time.
---
and I understand the argument that rewards may increase the likelihood of farming, but honestly theres no effective way to farm anymore for pips. the whole ranking system is jacked.
---
what if you don't get them until the very end?
---
What if I want tenacity, unbreakable, balanced landing and botany knowledge?
---
I have to level all those characters, get all their teachables, then I want them on Ace.
---
I dump 7$ to get ace, or however many shards, then I level up ace to 50+67 to get the perks I wanted on him.
---
Yes it's terrible.
---
&gt;Of course you got upvoted. All the killers here would love for people to follow your advice. It halfs the length of every chase.
---
If so, why isn't my thread vote negative? There are more survivor mains on this reddit than killer mains, so where are all my fellow survivors complaining? I only see a few of them, the majority of survivors seem to agreeing with me.
---
My arguement isn't that you should go find a teammate to heal you - that's a huge waste of time. My argument is that you should stick to a generator and wait until someone else finds you.
---
I just walk up to their ass and there's nothing they can do, an M1 from literal melee range is faster than the time it takes for the keypress to register + DH is buggy as fuck when it comes to this.
---
Yes. He just can’t interact with them until they’re asleep.  It if you used say BBQ and the survivor was more than 40 meters away, you can see their aura.
---
:( 😂
---
Because killer isn't designed to be played on controller. Survivor plays wonderfully on controller. Its not an unfair advantage, it simply brings it to an equal level if anything. Plus, like I said, some ps4 games have kb/m support. If the support is there, why would I not use it? Its fine if this game doesn't have it, but it seems like it does. Its just not working properly.
---
Looking at your replies in the comments and you seem to attack people who play the game differently than you.
---
Also if you're right up their ass it doesnt matter if they time it right since the lunge will outrange the dash.
---
Lmao.
---
They finally noticed that killers had a 30 minute wait from R1-R4 because survivors could simply not pip?
---
Well done.
---
Oh look everyone, the problem is here, live and in action
---
bayeux tapestry FTW
---
Run Pharmacy, Botany Knowledge, We'll Make It, and Empathy, become a dedicated team medic, use green medkit for years
---
Doesn't everyone get dweard and moustache man Jake?
---
This sub, and the community of DBD, has an awful lot of shitty entitled players, period, who don't seem to have fun with this game unless they're doing specific things to ruin the fun for everyone.
---
I would say almost all of online gaming is like this, but I honestly don't run into nearly as many assholes in other games as I do with DBD. Maybe LoL is still horrible, but I haven't played it in years. DBD though? I can't win or a lose a game without at least 2 people going ballistic.
---
Punishes weak killers, strong killers can ignore it most of the time. It's fine if only 1 person uses it, OP when all 4 use it. It's basically the new DS, except it has no counters and no perks to fight against it, so it's actually worse.
---
Along with the points above, a lot of people just immediately DC when they see the Feral Frenzy timer show up, so if you're a survivor, be ready for your teammates to yeet out of existence immediately. Very few people will sit to play through a Legion game- it doesn't matter if he has an OP build or not.
---
I would like the ability to organize my perks/items/add-ons the way I want.
---
o yes 1 will do. The number of pip i missed 'cause of just one point...
---
Exactly. Dunno why you are being downvoted
---
I was actually playing against a huntress that round lol
---
This comment is toxic
---
That sounds really cool.
---
Repost for better visibility, and to correct misspelling.
---
Any feedback is welcome!
---
So are we still pretending that everyone plays 4 man SWF, and that no one solo plays? Because your opinion of Self Care completely 180’s depending on what you are doing. Randoms are fuckin potatoes and would rather do a gen than heal me, even though I am crouching and it’d take 10 seconds. So fuck em, I’ll heal myself instead.
---
Do you want to have a slight chance for more rare  toolboxes, maps ect. ? Do you want the bloody clothing? If not, not worth.
---
Depends. I p3 to wear the bloody face combined with cosmetics to show that i main that survivor. Also if its a licensed survivor then its all the cosmetics they can get. Also it raises chances of better items by like .1 percent haha
---
Two exhaustion perks? Also, Was that body always there?

WHY THE FUCK ARE PC QUEUE TIMES SO LONG JUST TO MATCH WITH A RED PING KILLER
---
The fact you play Freddy excuses that
---
Hehe
---
Preach it brother
---
it's confirmed by Sony that there are no problems. there's a list of games that are/aren't affected by the psn change.
---
What an idiot lmao nice job killer
---
I disagree. I've generally been treated worse in this game than in Dota, LoL or HotS. More mean messages, more bad sportsmanship, more leavers.
---
This is already a insane thing to do, and with FREDDY? 
---
Not too often you get to see it, but you love to see it.
---
She’s done with the entity’s shit
---
Contact your local authority’s. Tell them that man belongs in jail for thinking corrupt intervention is better than ruin
---
The only reason vanilla legion ever 4ks is if the potato survivors insist on self-caring themselves instead of doing gens. 
---
Frank's mixtape + cold dirt though causes more DCs against veterans. But I can't imagine it causes anymore DCs than a good huntress with iri heads, clown's pinky, etc. 
---
Like every killer has a super cheesy add-on combination that makes you an asshole and you deserve your DCs lol.
---
Maybe we could get some cosmetics?

Sam- Meg

Not worth it unless you want the bloody outfits. P3 face + Cosmetics of your choosing is always a dank combo. Plus, if you're a stealthier player, some of the bloody outfits are darker then the normal ones, making it easier to hide. (At least, that's what it feels like, but that depends on the survivor.)
---
Honestly, only thing I'd prestige after favorite Survivor would be Myers. P3 Myers is best looking bloody killer imo. The rest of them generally have better cosmetics...
---
Other than the bloody clothes cosmetics and the less chances a trash item+add ons appear in the blood web. i would say no unless you're looking to p3 all survivors and killers.
---
and i hate that i rarely see party streamers on my p3 survivors but i get a couple on my non p' survivors via the bloodweb
---
God damn. How did I miss the word "unhooked". 😂
---
A few weeks ago it was there I believe.
---
Yeah a bit meh.
---
I don't, but I hate Legion almost as much as I hate people DC'ing mid match.
---
Legion is just bad killer design, period. He shall stay at level 1 on my killers select menu.
---
WHY IS HALF MY GAMES AS KILLER 3 MANS ?!?!? IM NOT JOKING ITS LITTERALY EVERY OTHER GAME
---
this should be done in reverse 
---
with the rank 20's thinking myers is a nice killer coming towards him
---
"Heavy Breathing Intensifies"
---
I like when it leads me to a survivor working on the last gen so I'm not wasting time on a fresh gen.
---
I don't need BP so I don't use WGLF anymore. I rarely get chests so I don't use chest perks. I'm not a fan of Adrenaline since you will be running 3 perks until the last gen is completed (it can be clutch, but very situational). UE is decent, but I can't find room for it.
---
For general purpose, I run BL to create loops otherwise not possible, IW because it's the best stealth perk, Bond because knowledge is power, and Spine Chill to give me a head start in a chase, to counter certain killers, and to give me faster vaults in chases.
---
Sometimes I run Spine Chill, Resilience, Dead Hard, and either Balanced Landing or Self-care if I want to play chase. Spine Chill and Resilience gives you 15% vault speed to help counter the killer's lag when vaulting. The point is to buy time for your team to do gens and hope you don't run into them.
---
I agree that a lot of the objective perks simply don't do enough, and they offer marginal gains in a limited capacity. The other issue is that a lot of the other perks are simply too situational or rely on having to go against certain killers. I used to run calm Spirit a lot but realize it's a waste. I don't go against the doctor or clown and not many killers run infectious fright. And some other perks have tedious prerequisites or you have no control when the perk is cashed in and it's limited to once per match? I'm not sure how they can balance but most of the perks suck. Sure they can be fun to play but most people want to escape.
---
nurse the best killer to play against tho.. :( maybe bc I main nurse
---
Then the killer just happens to be infit tier 3 meyers and is just staring at you as you get 99%
---
  I have Never and Will Never intentionally DC. When umsonst want play the game I just juke the killer as long as I can so he can kill me with me struggling. 
---
If you DC intentionally you should not be playing this game since you can’t handle this game. Ruining the experience of other players just because something doesn’t work the way you want it to, is just selfish.
---
I appreciate you as a human being, but as a killer go fuck yourself you ;lsjdflkajsf;lasknd;lnsadsa;lkfdnds
---
History is doomed to repeat itself.
---
It just ask you to put a lot on pressure on the whole map early game, and only start to make "long" chase after several minutes of play.
---
You keep reposting this, and you followed it up with a lie instantly, since they do use self care, and are good players. Once again, what separates good and bad players is proper application of their given tools, one of which can be self care, which good players *do* use, especially when playing solo survivor.
---
He loves you!
---
Yeah but I’m saying if the perk isn’t good on it’s own then why run it in another build. 
---
No I don’t only have one perk slot, but I’m not gonna waste one of them on a perk that doesn’t do shit 
---
I never said that they are all terrible. I said that almost half of them suck. Which still is true
---
Thank you! 💕
---
Nothing in the patch notes, sadly.
---
There's still Atack.
---
i finally got the perk on my Kate (running it with DH, Adrenaline and DS), i think the perk is literally annoying and there is no counterplay in that if you're a M1 killer. in the endgame i've managed to make saves that i shouldn't have and making killers simply DC. a competent survivor who runs that perk will be a true pain in the ass

Who did this art omg

Okay, but how would that work in-game? Like what would the power be like? How would the stealth be a part of the power?
---
I am the senate
---
Cannot believe it’s still not fixed. You see an update, you think it finally got fixed but nope, enjoy another week with this broken bug!
---
if you let survivors makes gens fastly in the early game you won't be able to get gold or iridescent gatekeeper emblem. Focusing on the whole survivor team instead of tunneling them one by one allow you as well to get a lot of point in the Malicious Emblem.
---
The game asks you to be more than a bot who spot someone and focus him 'til down then repeat. It wants you to have a global view of the game. gettng 4K is not the problem, the real thing is how you got it.
---
Why do you use 2 exaustion perks? like balanced landing and lithe is ok, but with sprintburst you'll never get to use balanced landing.
---
&gt; I said that almost half of them suck. Which still is true
---
if this is true of survivors then it's true of killers as well but I think neither is true and you have done nothing to show otherwise
---
Toxic in DBD = Running decent perks and using items like flashlights to its intended use.
---
Toxic in any other game = Yelling at your teammates when losing and creating a toxic environment that drags everyone down.
---
&gt;Good players just don't use self-care
---
Noob3 and Tru3 are bad players according to what you just said, while also linking a clip of them
---
I don't watch HybridPanda so I don't know if he uses it
---
Hovering around rank 9-12
---
How bad could it be?
---
i think it's useless prestiging survivors. the only survivor i've prestiged was kate 'cause i wanted all the teachable perks from others for her + i think she is the only one with a cool default cosmetic
---
I never said they weren't dead? I was simply correcting OP after they asked if everyone was dead. 
---
Dwight was spiked or at least implied to have been, Feng definitely got shit faced. Jake had lived in the woods and I guess it was only a matter of time when the Entity grabbed him, Meg went on a run and disappeared after going into the woods.

I posted this somewhere else
---
Tbh the new pipping system caused me to just not care anymore, so I also dc a lot. Before I was one of those who'd NEVER dc, even if It was a franks legion. Something about this parch broke me as a dbd player.
---
You have no idea how disappointed I am that Amanda's squeak isn't on the list.
---
And that’s gotta be the dumbest strategy I’ve ever heard of. You want to hook people to create pressure, not smack them to just keep them off gens every few seconds.
---
If you can criticize others then so can he
---
HELL NO
---
3 seconds.....? What? Lol
---
Yooo... fucking seriously dude. I have 9 bloody streamers for my dwight, fist time i threw those in in about a month... LITERALLY THAT GAME WAS AN INSTA DOWN HUNTRESS AND SHE FACE CAMPED ME...they’re just ornaments in my inventory now.
---
This reply is toxic
---
I would like it if Cursed treasure would be:
---
The first survivor to open the chest is guaranteed a common item, and the chest will automatically close. The next survivor interacting with the chest will be immediately put into the dying state and yell to reveal their position.
---
So why do you care? His loss is the survs gain + if he's having fun why care?
---
I know - HE said I am fully free to criticize, but when I do he acts surprised.
---
What point are you trying to make?
---
But...But my..... IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR OPINION IS!
---
Nice one &lt;3

This guy has the potential for some pretty good mind games but I feel like they'd be incredibly hard to pull off.

NOED, Insidious, bloodhound, Third seal

Empathy is better than Bond if you’re looking to be altruistic. Bond can be used in that sense if you want but it better uses for it
---
When I first saw the opening of the Legion trailer I got all excited and thought it was an Until Dawn crossover. Would love a Wendigo killer, or Wendigo!Josh.
---
So you're ruining people's games over something as fucking as irrelevant as pips?
---
I once had two survivors disconnected after we got all generators except one done; it was against a very good nurse who had already hooked me once. 
---
Meg was hiding somewhere, while I tried to do the final generator. We survived, only because I had self-care. 
---
You may call it a time waster, but it has saved my life on countless occasions.
---
Resilience is an ass perk for what it requires
---
If they don't release it later on today I'll have officially had my hope devoured :(
---
ALL DIS!!!
---
K
---
GIVE ME AN ACTUAL PROPER GAME! THESE PAST 3 DAYS EITHER MY GAME CRASHES BEFORE I CAN EVEN GET INTO A LOBBY, MY GAME CRASHES DURING LOADING, THE KILLER DCs AFTER MATCH START, I LOAD INTO A 3 MAN, I LOAD INTO A FUCKING 2 MAN (WHY DOES THAT EVEN EXIST) OR A SURVIVOR DCS 1 MINUTE INTO THE MATCH (THANKS ASSHOLE)
---
ALSO JUST ABOLISH 2/3-MAN GAMES. NO ONE WANTS THAT. IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SURVIVE UNLESS THE KILLER IS REALLY BAD (WHICH THEY USUALLY ARENT BECAUSE I PLAY AT RED RANKS), AND IN GENERAL IT'S JUST NO FUN AND MOST YOU CAN HOPE FOR IS HATCH.
---
Justifying a perk because two people DC'd like assholes isn't a good justification.
---
If you find a survivor and then leave with no chase, they have every incentive to just continue doing the gen they were on.
---
How about a perk that lets them rebuild/build new pallets/obstacles?
---
Gain a charge (Max 2 held at once) every time you search a chest/destroy a totem, and/or perhaps interact with a broken pallet.
---
Ranks reduce the time it takes to build/rebuild the pallet/obstacle. 20/17/15
---
Gives Boldness points for construction.
---
Would that be something you would trade exhaustion for?
---
You wanna talk about attitudes? I'm currently leveling Claudette to even have the perk available. I've only played other survivors since I started playing DBD. It's easy to pick apart a strawman, right? 
---
I get why you and others are so passionate about this. I've had useless teammates, I know the pain. But the problem isn't with the perk itself, it's with using it at the wrong time.
---
Self-care is ass perk for what it requires: up to 1 minute of being useless.
---
They need to get on this. Other games have already made this a standard.
---
I saw the first one as a kid and it scared the crap out of me. I really ought to watch the other two!
---
Possibly, but highly unlikely.
---
Sure he has fun(maybe? Honestly to me he just seems stressed out about it sometimes), but it’s still annoying lol
---
I can’t be annoyed? I’m not saying he’s bad and I’m not anti panda, he just mildly annoys me with his killer playstyle sometimes...  
---
He’s not optimal, and supports the wack rules that don’t really exist based on MAYBE how the survivors will view him. And that’s why it’s annoying, because he’s basically giving the survivors free stuff... even as a survivor player that’s annoying to me because it doesn’t help me get better, it might only support those who complain about killers more
---
THOUGH 10x BP WOULD BE SO NICE, IT REALLY HAS BEEN FOR FUCKING EVER SINCE WE LAST GOT A BP EVENT, COME ON BHVR! OR AT LEAST RELEASE BBQ ON THE SHRINE SO I CAN MAKE SOME POINTS AS KILLER OH WAIT THAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT
---
It's almost like Self Care is situational and it's use based entirely off of how fucking stupid one decides to be.
---
Huh.
---
Simmer down there Helen, I was just being honest. It's more of the cherry on top with the current state of the game i.e. Bugs, Stretch Armstrong hit boxes etc.
---
Healing doesn’t take a whole minute though. If you run around looking for a team mate for heals you literally are now doing nothing with yourself and someone else’s time is being used to heal you.
---
Ah ok, thanks
---
look at this tough af epic gamer
---
# STOP FUCKING QUITTING AFTER BEING HIT ONCE/DOWNED ONCE
---
These Survivor mains don’t know how bad us Killers have it. Perks like Unrelenting, Coulrophobia, etc... I don’t know how we do it!
---
That's why I say don't do either - don't use self-care, and don't run around looking for heals.
---
Just stay injured and do the objective. Eventually, a teammate will find you and heal you, then you can genrush together.
---
Man some folks just go hardcore when they see bps
---
I dunno dude it just seems like a 1st world problem that, if you took a step back and deep breath, wouldn't bother you at all
---
So then the killer gets the fastest down in the West?
---
Ikr. It sucks most people are fucking stupid.
---
Its a bug that allows legion to increase the time it takes to mend every time he hits up to a ridiculous level
---
Didn’t say it wasn’t true of killers 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’ve done nothing to show otherwise? It’s a matter of fact. Almost all of the perks I named are rarely used. It’s not an opinion.
---
I dunno. I've played a lot of League, and I'm never flamed by the other team. My own teammates usually do the flaming there.
---
*^^hi* ^^im ^^freddy ^^please ^^don't ^^use ^^self ^^care ^^gaiz ^^kthx
---
DBD is a time resource game. If you are gonna use self-care, you better use it properly.
---
I posted this somewhere else several times.
---
in the locker
---
They're rarely used because as I said survivor mains are babies who only want tank builds
---
Damn.
---
Oh god the fucking hit box thing again. hit boxes are fine
---
There is though, we just call it tunneling
---
NOED is the best perk. I was playing against some speed-hacking survivors and I only got them because of NOED. Secured me some good kills on countless occasions.
---
Josh or a Wendigo would be killer. And Matt a survivor because he’s hot
---
You are equating and conflating two different ideas: Self-Care does not mean Bad users of Self-Care.  You are literally citing players without a good "game-sense" for a lack of better term, not "99% of self-care users". 
---
As it is, Self-Care is an alright perk and not the un-removable perk that it once was. Whether or not it wastes a lot of time is a matter of debate and greatly depends on a case-to-case basis.
---
What if the killer has a Nurse’s Calling? Healing far away is an effective counter for it. I agree that healing in the corner without that perk being used is worthless but it has its purpose for certain scenarios.
---
It would be the Hag on steroids 😂
---
and a cameo in [Reboot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkgi-6GVR4o)
---
Why am I seeing red rank survivors self-caring in the corner of the maps through all my games?
---
They didn’t fix legions broken mend ?
---
No, its called situational awareness.
---
I rarely see Tapps but I ran into one last night, put him on a hook and damn was that an experience. Pretty loud and felt like it last about 3-5 seconds too long lol
---
No. They aren’t used because they aren’t as good as other perks out there and provide little to no edge over the competition. 
---
It’s funny that you call survivors babies when the killers are the ones always complaining and begging for nerfs
---
Okay, you know what else is a counter to Nurse's Calling?
---
Doing a generator, because doing a generator doesn't reveal aura.
---
Monitor and abuse has really been helping me get close to people.
---
It’s not even significant(if anything). You waste way more BP on p3 than it would to just keep spamming lvl50 bloodweb.
---
This is very creative and well thought out! Well done op! I’d love to see this in game, the perks sound interesting
---
Even with exhaustion it still reduces the penalty for falling down by 75% so it’s still good especially on the game
---
Butt dancer
---
Teabagging has been around for like 20 years, and it's been considered rude the entire time. I'm really not sure what makes dbd players believe otherwise.
---
idk why people are down voting you, this is the most optimal thing to do. Just don't be scared that you're injured and do a gen until you happen upon someone with bond.
---
I'd only go actively looking for someone if I was on death hook or something.
---
Well... like I said... it’s not THAT big a deal, and he’s free to do his thing.  But in my opinion, it’s annoying lol
---
Also, I do live in the first word, and you could literally say that same thing about 90% of every discussion on reddit or in the first world...  not sure what you’re going for lol (I’ve also lived in some interesting areas for many years in China and have traveled the world in many many bottom tier countries, even so... this is just a fun game discussion man lol)
---
Truly the dark ages
---
Other then the cosmetics, or achievements it’s pointless.
---
It's only the same handful of immersed players downvoting me. 
---
Majority of people seem to be agreeing with me which I'm glad about.
---
Tell that to the Nurse. Unless you get Dead Hard for five seconds extra in a chase you are done. Being one shot against her is torture. Or Hillbilly who can easily close the distance.
---
k.
---
Like a month or so ago
---
They may add crossplay when they add dedicated servers and a switch port
---
Have they ever considered putting good perks in there?
---
Oh yea, the perk I was using is just too overpowered
---
Nerf immediately
---
This is one scenario where I think self-care would actually be a smart choice. If you are going full medic, then self-care is great.
---
She really needs something to help with pallet loops like enduring, spirit fury, and brutal strength. enduring/spirit fury is probably the best bet but whatever you feel most comfortable with would be fine.
---
survivors tend to play very immersed against her so something for finding them like BBQ, whispers, or bitter murmur is good
---
monitor and abuse is nice because vile purge has its most use when you're really up on them
---
save the best for last is nice because it's possible for her to spend a lot of time as an M1 killer
---
blood warden is always great
---
^ i would say any combination of these as long as you have something for pallets and survivor locating
---
The post got removed?
---
So, if you face a nurse, you would opt to be one shot all game, knowing how strong she is? And the fact that she ignores all looping potential in the game?
---
wow nice one
---
Thanks! 
---
He needs a nap after all those game crashes.
---
Yeah his black add-ons are currently broken, every time he hits to it stacks more time, it can get to the point where you have a 5 minute mend.
---
killers needed the game to be better balanced. people were asking for nerfs to instablind, instagens, pallet vacuums etc and obviously broken perks like DS. oh the audacity
---
give me a fucking break
---
Ash’s loud scream when you down him is fucking hilarious.
---
If it's a nurse, I'm going to genrushing as hard as I can. 
---
She's going to get chain knockdowns if she is any good (I'm red ranks atm, so any nurse here should be), having an extra health state will only increase the chase time by about 15 seconds when with self-care it can take up to a minute. You gave a terrible example here.
---
FUCK THE BLOODWEB AND BP SYSTEM. JUST FUCK IT. GETTING 32K ON SURVIVOR IS IMPOSSIBLE. GETTING 8K FOR SURVIVAL IS IMPOSSIBLE. MAXING OUT ONE CATEGORY, OKAY, BUT ALL 3 BESIDE SURVIVAL? NOT HAPPENING. I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY IF I MAKE OVER 20K AS SURVIVOR. 
---
OFFERINGS TO GET MORE BP FOR A CATEGORY SOUND COOL, UNTIL YOU REALISE THAT IF I GET +50% ON ONE CATEGORY, MEANING A MAX OF +4k (AND THAT'S NO WAY GUARANTEED) BUT I'VE ALREADY SPENT 3K ON BUYING THE OFFERING, I NET A MAX GAIN OF 1k. THAT'S FUCKING NOTHING. HIGHER PERCENTAGES MEAN MORE PROSPECTIVE GAIN, BUT ALSO HIGHER RISK OF SIMPLY NOT MAXING THAT CATEGORY AND HAVING WASTED MORE BP ~~NOT TO MENTION EVERY SECOND MATCH NOT BEING A PROPER MATCH AND MAKING YOU LOSE YOUR OFFERING~~
---
Why do you have such a pointed attitude?
---
I will always DC against Franks mix tape, or iridescent heads.
---
But I got a flashlight
---
It was not supposed to be noted as a No Mither build, rather as a build doing whatever you can to push Generators as fast as possible. Turns out the only way to do that consistently is No Mither.
---
Against a good nurse it doesnt matter what you do, and yes Dead Hard is great againt her.  What about all the times you give a nurse a free down because she sees you healing with Nurses Calling? Not only were you not doing a gen, the killer found you for free.
---
Billy has an auto down. So you spent 30 sec self healing and still went down in one shot.
---
Bit of info:  
---
Was playing the Spirit and I wanted to use my ONLY pink addon for her. A minute into the game I downed "no mither David" which was followed by him and his (I guess) mate quitting.   
---
See, I know playing with quitting mates is shit. I also play survivor occasionally. However, that doesn't make me entitled to win. Since I didn't want to let my pink addon go to waste I continued playing until eventually both ended up on the hook.   
---
I do give people the hatch sometimes, I also often go easy on survivors where a large part on the team DCed. But I refuse to feel obligated to do that. I mean at that point it's a simple question: Why should I drag the game out AND give the survivors more BP than I would get if I just quickly killed them?  
---
If you two maybe read this: Again, sorry your mates quit, really. But it's not my obligation to go easy on you. If I do, good for you. If I don't, then that's just normal. Don't blame it on me if your game is fucked because your mates quit.
---
Yeah, went from being a Banshee to a human.
---
Who are the voice actors? I awlays asked myself that question but never looked for an answer.
---
The bugs aren't what i'd call non issues, and the fact that they're not rare occurrences either. I've had the wiggle bug 3 times today, which made me have to leave the game.
---
im on console so hell ya
---
No the fuck they aren't. On PS4 at least.
---
havent seen any, again just made a reddit so i could share this. I dont really care if other people have already, thats a good thing, hopefully if enough people figure out how to do this they devs will actually fix it
---
Those two perks are objectively issues.
---
Adrenaline should not wake up survivors. Freddy already has serious viability issues because survivor whining caused an unnecessary and terrible nerf.
---
MoM is just another perk that punishes killers for playing the game. And it's way too strong when stacked up via multiple players.
---
*those are objective game balance issues*
---
&gt; that the survivors physically cannot win
---
fucking lmfao survivors do fucking fine I escape around 55 percent of my matches.
---
That only works for characters with mobility though. Also leaving a survivor like that will tank the chase and injuring medals.
---
Because your post is a fucking meme, dude. Shut up about the upvotes, it doesn't mean anything. People got a slight chuckle at the meme and upvoted, bravo. It doesn't represent howgood of an argument you are making about not using self care.
---
Self care can be situationally bad and situationally good. Just like every other perk.
---
it involves a bug with the UI
---
I waste the killers time for longer whilst my team does gens ?
---
Same
---
Well, DC only I guess? And report?
---
Maybe read my other comments to fully understand my arguments.
---
How about all the DCs, and freezing at loading screens?
---
After these recent updates, for some god damn reason I'm getting 1-3 DCs a game and the only thing that has changed to do this have been the updates. I can't even tell if its intentional or not anymore, I've heard both from the people who DC'd. I just want a normal 4 survivors vs 1 killer game, DBD.
---
Yes they are. I know you guys think that latency and hit boxes are the same thing but they aren't
---
You can kind of tell when a killer is going to tunnel your nuts off. 
---
People dc so they don’t waste 15-20 min of their time looping the killer just to depip anyway. 
---
You should definitely gain pip if you are chased the entire match just to die when all gens are completed. That would fix a lot of DCs. 
---
The game says you that you played badly if you loop a killer for 5 gens. It’s absurd.
---
Justice would be incredibly OP. Nobody would ever get hooked lol
---
Alright then
---
Tunneling =/= Camping. It just means you prioritize the person who's closest to last hook.
---
I PLAYED NOED MYERS BEFORE KNOWING THAT IT WAS FROWNED UPON AND GOT SHIT ON FOR IT AND NOW I FEEL BAD FOR THE PEOPLE I PLAYED AGAINST.
---
So, you chose to mock me; why am I not surprised?
---
I agree with you in that abusing game mechanics is toxic such as blocking someone in a corner to be killed by the killer, blocking by the killer, or holding the game hostage. Those are actual abuses. People saying that mind gaming around a pallet is toxic or playing as claudette is toxic is a problem.
---
The issue is that everything is labeled as toxic on now no matter what you do. Sure there are things that can be toxic but these dont happen every game like everyone states. Having the word toxic being overused has devalued the word to not mean anything.
---
same here buddy
---
It wasn't mocking, I explained "how" by using your own answer.
---
SWF and quitting because one bad thing happened: name a more iconic duo
---
hmm imma take that salty pudding
---
That has nothing to do with the perk at that point though. 
---
You're arguing people should play differently (fixing gens while injured vs fully healed). Self-care is irrelevant in that since anyone doing the second option will just find someone to heal them before gens anyway.
---
Probably just make skillchecks easier honestly, lil easier to hit those Greats, makes Technician buff your repair speed without *actually* touching the number, because that's not gonna be healthy for the game. Encouraging players to go for those Greats more often then gives a reason for the explosion prevention.
---
So your the claudette running to the corner of the map to heal. Its fine, your team mates will do the gens i guess. 
---
Whole team is wiped out but hey! You can look for the hatch at full health. I guess you got that going for ya.
---
When I see people DC I let them win, but how easily depends on my mood, how many disconnected, how much BP I want/need and the general vibe they give me. If it's just 1 person disconnected, 2 decent players who focus on gens and 1 idiot teabagging me when I'm going easy, you can bet that teabagger is going on the hook and I'm gonna tunnel his ass to the ground. But otherwise I just slash em up a bit and throw em on hooks 2 times each to get BP, let em heal each other so I get more slashes and all that just to earn BP then let them go. Plenty of games anyway, I can earn BP fair and square from a fair game where no one disconnects.
---
I kinda feel Until Dawn is a bit too niche to be a crossover, plus the console exclusivity.
---
I suppose you would know best, not playing PS4 as opposed to me who has since early 2017.
---
"Teabagging isn't toxic" - Is this what 2000's kids actually think?
---
People that say you aren't a good nurse if you need ruin. Don't group PC nurses with console ones.
---
This isn't bad, I like the concepts you've put out here and trying to make other builds viable. I really like Good Shepherd (it is spelled \*shepherd,\* though) as an idea, my only fear is that it will go the way of open-handed: not a bad effect, but no one uses it. Let us Pray is also a cool idea, but how would it work with Object of Obsession, for example? Overall, cool and original concepts. Keep on designing!
---
survivors: spend all screaming at BHVR to fix players disconnecting
---
also survivors: worship disconnecting
---
That’s not true. And just because you can break LoS doesn’t mean the killer won’t keep tunneling you. A good 80% of my matches have single digit killer IQ. They hunt down the one person they can’t hook. 
---
But you are partially right. There’s no punishment for DCing. There’s also no reward for pipping. Increasing the punishment for DCing will probably lead to more DCs. People tend to care even less about rank when they punish more than reward. Last patch is a prime example.
---
Like you can catch me :) its called knowing the match up. 
---
Nice try tho
---
it only happens the first time you are downed, soo it can only happen 4 times in a game, and the killer has the option to either wait for the hook respawn(giving you time to heal) or to go after someone else
---
I actually 0 pipped. And the points are ok for two survivors. So since I don't care about rank...
---
Everytime lately.  I get so frustrated.  I don't care that I get sacrificed at all. I will often offer myself up if the killer is struggling (at the end). Lately I will play bps and I will get tunneled and camped. People will try and save me but it doesn't help. I would just like killers not to do that when streamers are played (especially multiples) chase me, hit me, hook me and take advantage of your bbq and chilli. Please! Let me heal. We both get points for it.
---
&gt;Those same players would spend longer time running to find another survivor to heal them. Not having self-care won't magically change that.
---
That's not my argument. Maybe I'll make another meme to explain this point better. My argument is basically self-care vs doing the generator injured.
---
&gt;I've seen your comments are the majority are downvoted so I don't know how "most people agree with you".
---
If the actual post has positive karma, and is quickly gaining more karma, then I'd say most people agree with me. My comments are only really seen by those whom I've replied to (those disagreeing with me) so ofc they will have negative karma.
---
It’s just an idea, i don’t get why the 3 dislikes
---
Sweet summer children.
---
One bug I encounter a lot is when playing as Ash there will always be one game where the wiggle bar is present at the beginning of s game. It causes you to stop every couple of steps when running.
---
Really? Territorial imperative seems like it is better than NOED.
---
"Self Care is a waste of time unless you use it properly". "Both Tru3 and Noob3 have spoken out against it".... They *both* still use it. Your argument is riddled with holes. So many that you seem to contradict yourself, which is evident in that first (summarized) quote. You can say the same thing about Dead Hard, it's a waste of a perk if you can't use it properly! Dont get me wrong, it blows my mind that some people will go to the opposite side of the map to heal but bad players will *always* make bad plays, regardless of their perk selection. Congrats on all the upvotes though!
---
I prefer coffee and a donut but to each their own....
---
HAHSHSHS thank u for this thats tru 💀💀
---
I think this might be the 10th time I've posted this. Please read my whole argument.
---
Wasn't she 19 when she was taken by the Entity? I'm really not into fanfics or anything like that, I just think they'd be an adorable couple. Especially murdering survivors together.
---
ON ALMOST EVERY SOLO SURVIVOR GAME IVE PLAYED THE PAST TWO DAYS ON PS4 I'VE HAD TWO TEAMMATES D/C. STOP SCREWING OVER THE REST OF THE TEAM BECAUSE YOU GOT DOWNED ONCE. IT'S PATHETIC
---
Identity v balances 2v8 pretty well
---
Honestly this is dumb AF.Shouldn't you get rewarded for finishing chases fast?Instead you get less chaser points if you do that,and get more as it extends more and more.
---
Totally agree. This could potentially give him a major disadvantage. I've already seen a few examples of this occurring, ha.
---
You:
---
Comes into my discussion
---
Makes point
---
Receives counterpoint
---
&gt;Don't really care about the argument. They have their opinions, I have mine, and quite frankly, I don't give a shit about their opinions.
---
Okay thanks for the heartful discussion pal
---
You weren't tunneling, but the Quentin (?) made some bad life choices.
---
Unless you're glitching through the map you'll be caught, it's not like you would know I'm not gonna right click
---
It’s fine. No reason why it should be nerfed while NOED still exists. Period. I don’t wanna hear any whining.
---
Blocking windows from the killer would be wayyyy too strong in some places, it'd have to be something like slowing the killer vault at most.
---
I won’t DC but I’ll die on hook if it’s just us 2 and hope you find the hatch.
---
So this is how Survivors DC against Legion... with thunderous applause
---
if you don't run self care i'm not even unhooking you; you're more useful hanging there, keeping the killer away from generators
---
Yeah, but without the burst if speed? Is it really worth sacrificing a perk slot?
---
how rank 20 like?
---
self care is good
---
But think about it this way you have to fast vault a couple of windows or pallets to get it and like if you accidentally use the blocking vaukt on a bad window or a pallet its useless so kinda would be balanced
---
how do you do earn more bloods? just picked up the game over the free weekend
---
not really
---
imo it’s very good
---
Why is rank even shown to the player if it's only used as MMR? If you want to give us indications on how well we did in a match, give us real end-game stats instead of an arbitrary scoring system that has a scoring cap in each arbitrary category.
---
thats a cool opinion
---
but have you considered that with self-care it can take upto a minute to heal? do you understand how much time is wasted each time someone uses selfcare?
---
First time I played Leagues I did two rounds and was accused of being a bot because I was so bad. I never responded to any of them because I didn't want them to know I was a human who sucked that badly at the game.
---
Exactly! I play many other games and any time there is a bug or glitch with something they block it or take it down until it’s fixed. With BhVR it’s more of we will patch it when we can and let it run wild until then! I don’t know why this company has such a track record of not jumping on things and simply blocking them until fixed. Look at the wraith with the sloppy butcher glitch! That took awhile before they got it patched and all they had to do was block or remove that perk for a little bit until patched. The community would have been fine with it and if anyone butches it was the people abusing it!
---
Think of it as hard mode since they're just skins anyways, but it does suck that they refuse to set a standard sound level for all survivors (remember Kate's old scream?) Either way it'll still be way more advantageous for survivors to play as claudette for her invisibility or Detective Tapp for his built in level two iron will (seriously dude makes very little noise compared to any other survivor) maybe when servers come around they'll get around to more QOL patches rather than using the next perk set as a bandaid for current issues
---
Ok. You want a cookie?
---
Oh? Yet killers say to run Small Game to counter NOED
---
Yeah okay.
---
5 Seconds is pretty significant as far a distance accumulated goes.
---
&gt; you can always loop around
---
Nah, for instance this would actually make the Ironworks window impossible to deal with for 97 percent of killers
---
I've never seen so much complaining about people doing game objectives before. Calling survivors toxic for looping or gen rushing would be like the enemy team in League of Legends call you toxic for rushing towers. You never see people complain about that in league because they would be laughed out of the game by the other 9 players.  
---
  
---
Toxic behavior is going out of your way to torment another player, or taking advantage of some kind of exploit. Knowing how to play the game effectively, and instead choosing to play in an ineffective manner is tantamount to letting the other person win.
---
yeah I wanna buy another copy for my smurf account but I'm afraid I'll get paired up with people who think self-care is good. 
---
I've been in red ranks so long I'm afraid to carry 3 potatoes every game - I dont think my back can take it
---
I figured a robot with perks would be more useful. In the remake Ripley hadn't even showed up yet. Kinda like quentin instead of nancy on nightmare.
---
It's not just DbD players though.  Any game that doesn't allow trash talking your opponents takes the same stance, because it replaces trash talking your opponents which is considered acceptable for some reason.
---
Pun intended
---
Exactly questions like *What is the entity* or *Who is the Benedict Baker* should be explored.
---
Honestly I don’t mind that people don’t like self-care, I think it’s the things you said about self-care users that made me act the way I did.
---
That’s how long one ‘chase’ lasts with a good Hillbilly
---
What are the specs on your device? How much software do you have installed? 
---
Dbd crashes for me, but never hard locks the device. i bet there's something else going on with your machine.
---
&gt;and laugh when they get communication banned
---
This does not happen on PC.
---
My thinking was matches where i kept getting hit once or slugged and getting away still its super situation to get hit once and not get hooked but it happens
---
I agree, either make it so you don't wake up but still heal or you wake up but stay injured.
---
Girls can't get dead hard.
---
You’re right, I’ll just start running omegablnk with an ebony every game :)
---
my favorite kind of girls Can 😔😔🥰🥰
---
Killing yourself on the hook isn't a DC though and we were strictly talking about DCing. 
---
I think it's fair to categorize all these behaviors as "leaving the game early" with DCing being the absolute worst thing you can do and killing yourself on the hook not being desirable but at least an honorable way to leave the game as the killer still gets their points for chasing, downing, and hooking you. 
---
At the end of the day people will leave the game early for their own reasons. It'll be hard to pinpoint every reason why someone chooses to leave the game early, but as a first step there should be punishments implemented and fail safes for the remaining survivors stuck in the game.
---
There are neither of these things and that's the problem.
---
Reworked DS is situational and has actual counterplay.
---
HE'S DOING HIS BEST, OKAY?
---
Ayup.  Trash talking (which in games where there's not communication between sides is emote spamming or teabagging) is considered acceptable and is expected.  People don't earn disrespect, that's the default.
---
your fault for playing solo bruh.
---
start playing decently and maybe you'll find someone willing to play with you
---
This is like the 13th time I've seen this suggested.
---
Doesn't really seem like a connection issue. Dead Hard has a certain level of input delay.
---
Wait..... oh my god! 😏
---
I play SWF but its too easy - none of us use selfcare so we just genrush the killer each time
---
feelsbadman
---
that's why I asked you how rank 20 is like - I want a challenge, but not an impossible one. I'm sure you got experience there.
---
For one, I want a 20% stackable BP bonus similar to WGLF for every bit of work you do that’s equivalent to a completed gen, maxing out at 100% if you essentially do all five gens solo, but probably hovering around 40-60%.
---
That wouldn’t put a bullet in WGLF farming, but wouldn’t hurt.
---
I have sprint burst already lol. I was running a tier 3 sprint burst until i prestiged my ash. I figured I didnt need to rely on the perks so much because most of the time I get away its because of sprint burst. Besides that i been running borrowed time self heal and MoM
---
JUST PLAY CANNIBAL FOR LIKE 3 HOURS AND GET BBQ AND CHILI FOR FUCKS SAKE. I THOUGHT IT WAS HARD TOO BUT IT WASNT.
---
THATS WHAT SHE FUCKING SAID.
---
It’s a higher end Alienware, 16gb of ram, good memory, and I have a SSD. 
---
I don’t have a lot on it right now because it isn’t very old, I have maybe 6 Steam games installed and still have like 530GB of free space. 
---
I don’t think it’s the device because I run higher-end games with no problem, and the only game that ever crashed for me besides DBD was Devil May Cry 5, but that closed itself shortly after.
---
It has to be DBD-related because there are only some few times that I can Alt-Tab to Task Manager and force it to quit. That usually only happens when the screen freezes at the loading screen, if it crashes on a black screen loading into a game (Like the OP pic), it’s fucked.
---
Survivors are the stronger side tho
---
That doesn't make any sense because the killer will check gens anyway and likely find you.
---
I hate Dwight’ when he gets hit. It sounds like he’s laughing. It’s too comedic.
---
You’re missing the point, a doc with the right build can indefinitely hold off 4 survivors with a good 3 gen that they can set up from the beginning of the match.
---
This is my fan chapter with nothing to do with them. And if they dont add a killer that isn't a humanoid it will be a waste imo. I want a beast or a alien of some type
---
&gt;Toxic isn't really thrown around this much in other games
---
(Laughs)
---
I think this community is too quick to label BM and harmless taunting as toxicity. I have never understood getting significantly triggered by teabagging. I mean I get mad at it too sometimes but I never go "Oh what a happy day for me as the mister killer man the crows are cawing and the moon is shining over the-**HOLY SHIT DID THAT CLAUDETTE JUST FUCKING TEABAG ME OH MAN I'M SO FUCKING ANGRY NOW I'M GOING TO MURDER THE SHIT OUT OF ALL THESE SURVIVORS JUST BECAUSE ONE OF THEM PUSHED CROUCH!**"
---
Okay I agree with the majority of your comment, besides the part where you say that Nurse and Spirit have a bad time on that map. That's the devil's playground for those killers, especially Nurse. She can just whip through that shit like no one's business.
---
He could have easily grabbed you when you sabotaged the hook there.
---
reeeeepost
---
Killers would not slug for the last survivor if it was feasible to 4K without doing that or needing to allow all the gens getting done to attempt a Blood Warden play.
---
And it's also an intended feature by the devs so disconnecting over something they put in the game intentionally is shitty
---
The argument has been made way before this thread. You either buy into the pros or cons of SC. It's that simple. Anything I say is just regurgitation of opinions.
---
I gave my general opinion that it can be good and it can be bad. Anyone new to this game can read this thread or any other thread about SC and form their own opinion without me saying the same thing someone else said.
---
But the main point I was making was that upvotes on a meme does not give credibility to your argument because you've brought it up a couple times in this thread.
---
I'm clueless?
---
Legion player wants survivors to waste time healing. Wow, what a shocker.
---
Right? It's like Christian Bale's Batman vs. Michael Keaton's Batman. They're both great in different ways.
---
SHE'S REALLY COUNTERABLE, IF SHE'S ALMOST AS ANNOYING AS LEGION FOR YOU, YOU'RE KIND OF BAD. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE DEVS MADE THERE BE A SOUND WHEN THE SPIRIT GOES INTO SPIRIT WALK MODE SO SHE CAN'T MIND GAME ANYMORE
---
I only DC if the killer is slugging for the 4k royale. If my team sucks and I know for sure it'll be a hatch game, I'll suicide next time I'm on the hook.
---
A xenomorph would be awesome but i dont know how to implement it in the game without it feeling weird
---
I'd be happy with this because I'd finally get the coat I want for Dwight, they have one similar in his concept art but they've never put it in the game Dx
---
"Is main complain is that there is no point healing against him." 
---
Bye...
---
Just make an exhaustion on the swipes faster
---
watching bad streamers isn't swf - it's when you're actually playing the game with someone else
---
Should've used Ash in this Sam Raimi meme
---
I go after the one who saved and still never double pip with 4K all survivors hook three times each with only one gen done. The killer goal is to kill survivors. Not be a game master and make sure every one is having fun. So why is the killer punished for quick downs and kills. How is that not the way to play killer? Why do I need to change my already forgiving play style even more just to get back to red ranks?
---
I like cursed loot and forbidden treasure. 
---
I feel like 1 hit hero is a bit of a waste. This whole section is filled with stuff about gold but nothing names gold or doubloons. So maybe the new survivor is trying to steal this pirates gold and we give him a perk that reflects loot. or him having to remove the cursed totems that hold the spirit here over his gold. 
---
**Unbroken Spirit:** Since we don't have a purple hex removal perk I think this would be not bad:  
---
Hex's within 10/12/16 m away from you show their aura to the survivor. Actions taken to remove them are 15% faster.
---
**Double Doubloons:** The survivor may carry and use two items ( their abilities do not stack. I.e. no double gen buff from two flashlights , two repair toolboxes etc.) It imply lets the survivor gather another item in the start screen or in the match and use them like you normally would. Yes this would take some extra programming but it would awesome and a perk a lot of people would find fun. 
---
Would the Soggy wood require a survivor stunned animation if they are vaulting over the pallet? or would the ballet just break apart before use?   
---
We need a better pirate named  killer other than, "The Pirate". Pirate lore is FILLED with great pirate names. 
---
I think red feather could be a little more aggressive and we don't need another killer that breaks the pallet laws.   
---
how about something that gives the killer more knowledge about where survivors are; The item would be:  
---
**Broken compass:**  Any survivor that has been hit with a spirit but not downed has their aura shown to the pirate as long as they are 15m away.  OR, something that goes along with the hex removal build. It will reward the killer for not using totems,: as long as there are more totems up then survivors, you may kill 1 survivor by your hand. Affect is usable 1 per game.
---
Going from Mount Mormon to Holland to bury a body in the pleasure car huh. 
---
Certainly more entertaining than the actual lore of Legion.
---
*Deep exhale* 
---
Legion's has the most unfun power in the game. There is no counter-play, on top of that Legion's can abuse game mechanics by moonwalking and breaking chase, forcing you to go down.
---
There is also Frank's mixtape and Infinite mend...
---
THE SPIRIT CAN LITERALLY JUST PHASE WALK AND HEAR WHERE YOU ARE SO THERE’S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
---
It's from all the old timey scoliosis.
---
What the fuck did I just read? Nothing made sense.
---
Legion snaps away my happiness like Thanos
---
The main complaint is that Legions playstyle promotes tunneling, which is a boring way to play. I hate playing as and against Legion.
---
You're entitled to your opinion, but most of us could not care less that he can "injure us fast". It's because it's boring to play against a killer you know is more than likely going to tunnel you down.
---
And before you say "not all Legions!" You're right, not all of them. In my experience, its roughly every 8 or 9 out of 10 is tunneling in red ranks.
---
Killers and survivors can be from other universes/timelines so that wouldn’t matter
---
Lmao imagine not using wake up in 2019
---
I think more people are realizing that rank doesn't matter and that there is no real punishment for dc'ing so when a match isn't going their way they will just dc
---
Jane's also pretty suggestive too.
---
That is so OP, it's a free NOED
---
Anyone else remember this? 1v8 10 gens &amp; double size map
---
I don't get it either, but that's because my goal with every match is to get better. I see every match through because, in that sense, there's something I can get out of it. The only case where I can't is when they hard camp. I use that time to reflect on why I hate myself enough to play this game.
---
I went against someone running the addons yesterday and I had started mending after the chase broke, they found me and walked up 
---
 and watched me finish mending (took at least a full 2 minutes but I'm all about those points) and shaking their head/nodding the whole time. As soon as I finished mending they M1'd me anyways tho
---
I’m not missing your point at all.
---
fuck where is this spidy scene from again ?
---
The map is amazing for a experienced Nurse and  Spirit.
---
Those perks for the killer are super op
---
my expectation is that you get some brain before trying to communicate ?
---
thats to google translate;)
---
It feels like even when I do she’ll just pop in and check around exactly where I am every time.
---
Still think that Survivor scoring should be completely reworked, but this is a positive change. Pipping as survivor was too difficult at high ranks.
---
thanks to google translate;)
---
You'll get a Gen done early, sure, but it's better to solo Gens.
---
ok
---
Welp, time to use my insta heal medkit
---
No, I don’t heal in the corner of the map. I don’t even run Self Care.
---
Nobody plays nurse on PS4. I haven’t had a nurse game in months.
---
IF YOU STAND STILL SHE CAN'T REALLY FIND YOU, NOT ONLY THAT BUT CAN CROUCH WALK. OTHERWISE CALM SPIRIT OR WHATEVER THE PERK THAT LET'S YOU BE QUITE WHEN INJURED IS HELPFUL AGAINST HER
---
On one hand, I feel attacked. On the other, I'm glad to know I'm not alone in this. I throw my whole body into playing Killer.
---
Heh silly devs,they forgot to include they fixed the broken Legion addons......tell me they just forgot to include that please.
---
WAY COOL!
---
I think everyone dreams of doing this to Claudette. What happens in the intro, I mean
---
The game will load like normal, the bar will be 100%, then when the game goes black-screen to transition into the actual game, it will just hang there.
---
I usually wait a couple of minutes to see if I’ll pop up in the game, but nah.
---
But they obviously werent a 4-man SWF or they would have all quit. At most it was a 2 man (if even). You just compiled on them already getting shat on by their "teammates". Personally, I think its a dick move but when I play killer (or survivor) I tend to realize that there are other people playing too...
---
It's so strange that they haven't released them yet. We usually get a set alongside a Chapter release and from there it's almost weekly but this time we didn't get anything alongside the Plague, nothing the week after, I guess the Ash DLC the following week counts and now seemingly nothing this week.
---
I wish it was not the case, but I believe they've already stated that dedicated servers will not bring crossplay. Again, I really wish that was not the case, I have a few friends on PS4 but I play on PC
---
Yeah but this is happening every game within the first minute.  I’ve never seen it this bad.  I’m on ps4 and I’ve played about 10 games today so far and at least 8 of them have had 1 if not 2 dc’s.  It’s ridiculous.
---
I became so much happier when I stopped listening to people's bullshit rules. I hope more people do it
---
I only have about 350 hours and I hear it all the time, along with a 6 letter racial slur
---
Amanda is seriously too cute to be a killer.
---
bloodpoints are what most people desire, unless you have fully perked with every characters and have loads of addons.
---
Ayye this guy lol good one boi
---
WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED TO THE GAME I GOT AN UPDATE FOR AN OLD VERSION(?!) AND NOW EVERYTHING IS SEVERELY BROKEN LIKE I CANT EVEN HIT A SURVIVOR WITHOUT A 2-3 SECOND FREEZE BY WHICH POINT THEYRE ALREADY ACROSS THE MAP
---
I scout around for the Killer. Then I point at them, and then I dash out of there to make the killer chase me.
---
Usually I am OK with T-bagging when I play killer, but I secretly wish the worst kind of things onto the people that wait at the exit to T-bag you and then leave right as you are about to hit them
---
THERES ALMOST THIRTY FUCKING MAPS IN THIS GAME AND AS SOMEONE WHO JUST STARTED PLAYING THATS MY BIGGEST HURDLE RN IN LEARNING HOW TO LOOP, I GUESS I JUST HAVE TO RUN WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE NEXT YEAR UNTIL I HAVE THE MAPS DOWN. BY WHICH TIME THERE’LL BE FIVE MORE REEEEEEEEEEE
---
insidious....really useful to camp
---
I dont think anyone really cares about bloodpoints you can get about 100k in 3 games. Its not unimportant but its not that important.
---
I do not like the phrase entitled survivor, is used a lot by killers with tunnel vision that get sour for being pallet stunned, blinded, or even looped by good survivors.
---
But yeah, whinners exists across both survivors and killers, and the truth is, bad players always complain the loudest, instead of taking time to learn mechanics, they ask for buffs or nerfs left and right.
---
They did. When selecting him or joining a lobby
---
So perfect
---
Well, it's not super easy to do. It takes a decent amount of practice and learning the feel for how long frenzy lasts. It's also worth noting that if you just plain have trouble with it, just fucking run straight away. I know that people don't really like hearing this, but because Legion has such awful map pressure and takes longer than average to end chases, you can get them really far from where people are working on gens pretty easily, so despite going down eventually it would be detrimental to Legion's momentum 
---
if you feel like you're going tobe hit by feral frenzy, try and make sure it happens right at a window and vault it immediately and run straight away. Legion *cannot* catch up if you do that and it will force a stun on them if they choose to pursue.
---
When you use bloody party streamers and the killer DCs at the start of the match
---
Some people are very controlling in nature and if you don't play the exact way they are then you are bad and wasting time. People should not be this way, but what can we do?
---
Do they not want their bloodpoints?  You get 0 points when you d/c so even if you did almost nothing in the match you get a few thousand plus some rank points for progress to get those store currency pieces.  I just don't understand it
---
Streamers promoted the action of dcing to lower their rank to bully killers and took that mentallity to the masses.
---
Emblems: to get gatekeeper you want to be ruthless and efficient, end chases fast to keep them off gens 
---
Also emblems: let them go for points
---
:)
---
Yeah, give them some cool bloodied up clothes, it's all I care for.
---
Not to mention most legions i go against are super easy to 360
---
Leatherface camps? No dignity.
---
WoW was prett bad back in the day too.
---
Gross yet intriguing
---
Wait what? *Dashes to the tutorials*
---
Theo only time I dodge a lobby is if the ping is insanely high. (As survivor)
---
Yeah, I kept getting the same clown over and over again who would keep coming after me and facecamping me, and then my teammates weren't even doing gens, they were all crouching in the area so adrenaline was out of the question even if anyone did make a move to save me.
---
Self-Care is better in that regard since by getting healed by a teammate you end up spending the same amount of time healing, just divided over 2 players. But you waste extra time looking around for someone else to heal you.
---
And just so you know, Sloppy Butcher only adds a mere 6 extra seconds when running Self-Care.
---
100k in 3 matches?  good luck with all the DC'ing doing that LOL
---
I'm on PS4 too and yeah a lot of people are disconnecting quickly, idk why
---
Most happen at the start of the match when they get found first and go down quickly or gens pop to fast when they are killer so they dc, at that point it's the start of the match so they aren't losing much.
---
I dont get many dc's when i play
---
When bhvr wants to compensate its players they be like.
---
Waiting at the exit gate just to T-bag the killer and then leave right before he can hit you is something I still concider toxic even tough you weren't abusing any game mechanics, you just went out of your way to try and ruin the day of someone else while it doesn't give you a tactical advantage whatsoever
---
I have an idea for a purple add-on: Rusted Sword: the spirt can break pallets it runs in to (it will take 85% as long as you would break a pallet and if you use this with red Feather it will only take 42.5% as long and it will still move but at half the speed) (this does sack with brutal strength and it will charge spirt fury) but the spirt can be stunned (stun time is the same as yours and is affected by perks)
---
&gt; He shall stay at level 1 on my killers select menu.
---
I thought I was the only one
---
Yeah, I don't think many people here have actually played Legion. being in feral frenzy is kind of strange. It's rather different than running around like normal; it isn't just faster with the ability to vault. It changes how you move and see a lot
---
Dude for real. I'm wondering the context or if it's OC.
---
Hahhaha
---
for me it depends on my mood, sometimes i would rather play an actual real game
---
I'm also a victim of this same issue. It started on the PTB for Plague and then it went live and here we are. I've found a handful of us here on reddit with the problem, but it seems we're in a small minority. What I've noticed is that if it shows someone DC'ed and there's no musical note at the same time, then it's a DC caused by this bug. If the DC is instigated by the survivor then there will still be the musical note at the same time.
---
I want you in my games then :)
---
i actualy love save the best for last but its hard for me to pick it over all the other top tier perks NC,Ruin,BBQ it just doesnt fit in very well with some killers such as billy or huntress
---
THEY THINK IT'S A MORI
---
I had the same experience with doc. I put one on the hook the other 3 swarmed I kept knocking them down picking up they unhooked I downed one hooked one on shoulder. Rinse repeat. I had no idea who was hooked or not since it was pizza dwights. Just a waterfall of pizza dwights.
---
Thank you sir, I completely agree. We are there to kill, as efficiently as we can. Point blank period.
---
you dont need small game to counter noed and ive never heard anyone say that lol small game is a worthless perk
---
Doesn’t need any captions
---
there was a swf group with a Nea named "IfLostReturnToLena", Kate with "IAmLena" and Adam "HiImTheThirdWheel", these players were wholesome, a shame i couldn't save Adam and Kate at the end.
---
Yeah you kinda do if you are solo playing, otherwise you have no idea if other people have gotten the totems or not.
---
Style should never trump substance.. in anything. Killing is the goal, so killing should be how you win. The amount of gens left after you've killed should indicate just how well you've won, not if you've won at all. 
---
Killing 3 or more players should get you a pip ALWAYS since you've won. Killing with 3 or more gens left should get you a double pip ALWAYS since you've won extremely efficiently.
---
Tru
---
Can someone link the og meme to this. I'm seeing it pop up all over
---
I try to do this. Got yelled at once due to looking for a gen to do myself
---
Ive only played a single nurse on ps4 since I started back in September. She's just not touched.
---
They've announced that it's supposed to be released today
---
Ah yes, the alpha perk
---
Holy shit. YES
---
This was the Militia episode. The one were Amanda and Ash flirt.
---
I don't run self care, but I think if you're not alive you're not being helpful to the team. For different people and different play styles, different things are going to keep them alive. There's no one right way.
---
You have to be alive before you can do gens.
---
Nah, I think the system is alright.
---
Whens this update out?
---
Ah, I did not know that. Thanks.
---
You would replace Feral Frenzy with a ability similar to The Pig's where they enter a state where they're in a stealth mode that reduces the terror radius to 0 or close to that. This would in turn require they're standard terror radius to be larger.
---
Also kind of disappointed by the theme, 80’s slasher feels so overdone.
---
DCing, yes. Lobby dodging, no. Let's not do this false equivalency crap.
---
You’re discounting survivor skill in the equation. An equally good survivor can easily take advantage of an extra hit to get out of a dead zone and make life way harder.
---
ahh so good
---
FIND A FUCKING SOLUTION TO THE CURRENT DC'ING EPIDEMIC! IT'S SO ANNOYING GOING INTO A GAME JUST TO HAVE SOME NERD RUIN THE GAME FOR EVERYONE.
---
If you try playing spirit it will give you a better idea of how to play against her. Spirit is one of many reasons I never take off iron will. Otherwise you are screwed as soon as you get hit. If you know she's coming you should head straight for a pallet or a window with long walls. Note that if you walk through tall grass or any other foliage she can see it moving, and it's a dead giveaway as they absolutely will notice. From there it's about the mind games.   
---
Keep in mind that she is expecting you to be where you would feel safest, likely as close as you can get to a window or pallet. If you are nowhere near a pallet she can just run you down normally, so you generally want to head towards one, but from there you can do several things. You can try to stun her out of spoopy-mode, which is the most dangerous, but clearly the most badass. You can also throw down the pallet early and make her think you are trying to mind game her on the vault, and just walk away. You can try to mind-game a quiet vault, but the best odds you get are 50/50. Another strategy is to run towards a pallet and stop a bit short, then just walk backwards (I find this pretty effective). If you want to loop her you can stop running and walk to the long wall side of a loop/safe pallet. This is a little more predictable, but has a higher payoff. Lastly you could be an absolute madlad and stand perfectly still. After many mind-games they usually don't expect this, and it will tilt them to levels never before seen.  
---
Keep in mind that if you do the same thing multiple times in a row they are going to figure you out pretty quickly. Alternating which strategy you use is key.

Daily reddit post: Stop making overpriced cosmetics, fix the fucking game...we don’t need more cosmetics!
---
Daily reddit post #2:  when the hell are the new cosmetics dropping?!?! It’s been 3 weeks since we’ve got the new chapter, and 1 WHOLE week since the last DLC
---
I had a survivor group named; 
---
Depression
---
Anxiety
---
Anger
---
Schizophrenia
---
Fun little group but sadly nothing else particularly creative.

(screams at monitor) AHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhFukinuselessgodammteamtesreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Lobby dodging is in no way similar to disconnecting from a loaded game. 
---
And if SWF wasn't an aggravating game balance issue it wouldn't be a problem. Why should a killer have to load into a game where the players are subverting gameplay mechanics?
---

ON ANOTHER NOTE I'M SO SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE USING ADRENALINE TO BYPASS THE HEALING CHANGES.  WHY CAN'T WE GET A SOLID STALLING SETUP?  CORRUPT INTERVENTION IS SO EASY TO HIDE AWAY FROM, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SIZE OF SOME OF THE MAPS, RUIN IS A FUCKING THUNDERCLAP IN .5 SECONDS, AND WHAT ELSE IS THERE?  ANTI-HEAL BUILDS?  LOLDRENALINE SAYS "NOPE JUST RUSH GENS TO GET A FREE HEAL."  I FEEL BASICALLY FORCED TO PLAY CANCEROUS 3-GEN STRATS BECAUSE *IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE THE ONLY TIME I REALLY HAVE IN THIS GAME AS KILLER..*
---
It doesn't hide his lullaby
---
*Oh Shit* Cat is just great.
---
We already have a snowy lodge map though with Legion and Jeff. Also, isn’t Hag meant to be a Wendigo?
---
It would be cool, but I doubt it’ll happen at this point.
---
I want a ride in the pleasure car.
---
it's a reference to the first saw movie where there's a fight and one of them loses and well dies right there and then
---
Thankfully Tony Todd is still with us (as far as I can tell, sometimes with the more cult actors it takes a while for the news to break)
---
Vincent Price has passed and I could very well see it as insensitive to use his name/identity in a game like this, but you could just use one of his many characters and you’d essentially have Vincent Price
---
"Squeeeeeeek!"
---
I'm so sad that it's console exclusive :( I really want to play that game.
---
I think I got sheets of them at a Video Game con. a while back. I’ve got [more stickers](https://imgur.com/AuwIGMq)  on the back, a few more cat ones in the middle
---
The tree was a secret until a Jake showed me.
---
I was surprised it's still in there.
---
ABCDEFGHIGKLMN**OP**QRSTUVWXYZ
---
I started writing a different comment and just got more mad. The game can obviously tell if you successfully loaded in or not because If a survivor doesn’t load in, you only need 4 gens instead of 5 from the start.
---
If that’s the case, why haven’t they implemented something where if you fail to load into the game then you keep your item/addons? It’s a little thing and I’m no coder, but it seems logical to me at least. 
---
Also, for when that inevitably happens and the other 3 survivors disconnect, that’s a total waste of everybody’s everything. If the game is over within 5 minutes and there were few to no hooks yet, why shouldn’t you should keep whatever you brought into the game? It basically didn’t even happen. 
---
Because T H I C C survivor cosmetics, that’s why.
---
(She was an intern).
---
Those all have counters that isn’t killer dependent. Wraith and billy can both deal with unbreakable or dead hard in the same way, don’t slug, wait to swing. Wraith doesn’t have any ability to deal with mom like billy does though.
---
I didn't like playing against Doctor until clown got released. Now i love playing against doctor
---
All time I believe.
---
I have a few that were just randomly there one day (Xbox).
---
I wish there were more perks that you would activate that are aura reading. Because then blindness would actually mean something. Right now killer addons that cause blindness aren't worth much besides not seeing the hooked survivor at all times, and it assists in slug builds.

I've put on Resilience for my always injured build, it actually feels pretty decent. You only do things a little faster, but it works on everything.
---
I have dropped Adrenaline though, I'd almost rather have Dead Hard than be fully healed just because of how common NOED seems to be these days.
---
Better make that clear so you dont get banned once this patch goes live
---
Ok. what makes you think I'm mad? And what am I mad about?
---
*laughs in Discordance*
---
I’ve only played against Plague one time on PS4. Which is crazy. When Legion came out everyone played as that killer.
---
Aren't The Hillbilly and The Cannibal the same.
---
That's literally what many survivors expect from you, yes.
---
Then its not standoff its called waiting
---
Ofc there's more to it than just looping but a competent killer can force a game-long chase on you if he so wants to do. If you don't get chased at all you can only do gens or throw. If you only get chased, you can only loop or throw. If one side can force the other to play a certain way, then the ranking system should be adjusted to reward people who play optimal when force into a playstyle.
---
This is a bad thing???
---
I don't have a strong opinion on this because, even though I've been playing for 2+ years I'm not that good. lol  But, I think BHVR's mindset is you can either annihilate weak opponents and get the BP rewards, or extend that same game and get pips. Pips are a reward for showing skill in the four categories.
---
The point being, annihilating a weak opponent isn't skillful. If the four survivors just stand then and let you hook them, you didn't do anything skillful - therefore you don't deserve the higher ranking. Playing against a weak team, your skill is shown by toying with them. Once you're playing against an evenly matched game, then this will come naturally. I think that's what they're working towards... Right now we're still feeling the repercussions of the old pre-changes system, where people have ranked up or down to where they don't belong. So, you have weak survivors playing experience killers and vice versa. In the beginning it's going to feel artificial until we all settle down to where we should be. 
---
I'm prepared for the downvotes, but I'm not saying I agree with any of this. You may disagree with them, but they're doing it this way for a reason. I think they're admitting it's not perfect or finished, but they're obviously working in some direction... I'm just trying to express a possible explanation for the dev's thoughts in the matter.
---
Yeah. Tbh if they start banning people for leaving 500 ping lobbies then that's a huge problem. 
---
I don't ever DC in a game though. It's not fair on anyone if people DC.
---
I agree with the soggy wood change, takes away RNG.
---
*Hovers over dc button*
---
No I’ll be the bigger man
---
*Hooked 3 times within 4 minutes*
---
I mean, I use it because I 
---
a) Am bad at looping, ergo I sorta need the extra hit
---
b) Don't trust Randos to heal me.  I've dealt with way too many randos failing skillchecks on my back resulting in my death
---
and
---
c) As a Killer player I know how BS it is for people to just sit on Gens instead of healing.  I want to give the killer something resembling a chance if they're not playing Nurse or Billy.
---
They stated In our next update so it’ll be when the mid patch drops.
---
for fun! :-)
---
this was fucking amazing
---
I have to try this now. Feng is always so damn cute.
---
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE ONES THAT JUST HIT THE AIR ALL GAME!?  BECAUSE I HATE THAT TOO
---
i've looped a little longer with the fall reduction even after i've used my BL, killers don't seem to expect it.
---
its adorable that you think removing Legion is an option
---
Botany knowledge  and a big dick medkit is where it's at
---
To each their own, I try and end the match quickly so we can all try getting back into a 4 vs 1 ASAP, these aren't fun situations for anyone so I don't usually try extending them.
---
You don’t have to let them escape but you can at least go easy on them. Let everyone get some points before you kill them. Going full try hard on a 2v1 is a dick move.
---
Perks that involve chests sound awesome, 1 hit hero also sounds like high risk high reward.
---
It's not a perfect solution but Surveillance makes it easy to patrol regressing gens ever since its huge buff a little while ago, you can rack up generator defense points really easy by kicking the same gen every time a survivor touches it, plus it helps you keep tabs on stealthy survivors more easily.
---
That's how I feel, I don't want to sit there and watch 2 people do 5 gens. I'd rather get the game over so I could go for a full game.
---
Have you heard of Malinda Katleen Reese A.K.A translator fails by chance?
---
Tapp's hook scream literally lasts the entire animation without trailing off. It's pretty intense.
---
99% of comments are bashing OP for not using it. I can't live without it as a solo player
---
Back before there were "memes", there were just internet jokes and you could on this website and make these medieval tapestries. The original website is down but someone cloned it. Look up Bayeux tapestry.
---
i can't decipher the first sentence and yeah Adam should definitely be next the bath
---
maybe licensing issues
---
YES THOSE ONES AND YOU KNOWN THERE BOTS BECAUE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIER BIO THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT JAPAN IN IT
---
Good lord
---
I play both sides. I'm talking about the fact that a killer can decide to tunnel one person and force everyone else out of chase time/chase the tunneled person into a long-game chase. This is just how it is.
---
REALLY TIRED OF SPAWNING INSIDE OF THE KILLERS' TERROR RADIUS. A FEW COOL DUDES REALIZE THAT THAT ISN'T FAIR, SHAKE THEIR HEAD AND SEEK SOMEONE ELSE OUT, BUT THE MAJORITY DO NOT. 
---
THAT NEW BUG WHERE TWO PEOPLE AUTO DC AFTER A GEN / AFTER A DEVOUR HOPE STACK IS GAINED IS REALLY COOL AND NOT AT ALL TERRIBLE, DEFINITELY.
---
IT'S SUPER FUN HAVING AN EBONY MORI EVERY OTHER GAME AND THEM TUNNELING ME RIGHT OFF FIRST HOOK TO USE IT ON ME. VERY FUN. LITERALLY I JUST WANNA RUN A KOBE BUILD OR A PLUNDERERS BUILD BUT I KINDA CAN'T BECAUSE LITERALLY EVERYONE IS SWEATY.
---
The system is definitely flawed and has too many what if's to justify if it's balanced or not.
---
Because it's not *you* being dodged. It's the SWF you loaded in with being dodged
---
I mean didnt Zepp die in the middle of thr room somewhere and not next to a wall. I think it is Adam then, since Xavier also died in the middle of the room.
---
We already have a final girl though.
---
yes i think exactly in the middle, i remember Xavier's death, that's so anti climactic tbh
---
She also kinda roars a bit at the end now
---
Why would you say something so controversial, and yet so brave?
---
I had 3 nurses in a row 2 days ago, one was camping with noed (1 dc) and one was slugging (2 dcs). I felt dead inside when I heard that screeching sound again in the 3rd match. She was a nice killer tho.
---
This is actually pretty good for being a shitpost
---
And get rewarded by the devs for doing so.
---
You say that but it's not hard to counter ds at all. Either take a hit or juggle them
---
Good to know. I’m just thinking back to my matches where DCs did happen and I wanted to be sure I was hearing it right
---
Yeah. I get that. I try not to do things like that. But, uh. Yeah. Several problems: 1) I’m not good. 2) I don’t  have borrowed time. 3) LEEEROY JEEENKINS!! Especially against campers. 
---
It does suck though. :/

Yep.
---
So why was it so bitched about? Oh yeah...bc it's at the killers expense and not the Surviviors.
---
Maan i got ash and honestly the only strongperks i have on him is self care, urban evasion, mettle of man and decisive strike. Lol. I legit have been gettin horrible perks. So im like im just gonna run both ds and MoM. It can save you for sure. But know that in some killers it wont work. Noed trumps it. 1 hit downs trumps it as well. Only loadout i can really run on him right now...
---
You prepare with a fruit cup??
---
Sounds like you’re the potato then my dude
---
Even when all of us load in at different times? That was my thought too but there’s a lot of seriously questionable dodges where we all load in at different times. Idk if you play on pc but if you do go play solo survivor for the day and you will see what I mean. I swear it’s not just SWF
---
Honestly though, go for Mettle of Man.
---
No, it’s crybabies being crybabies. I wouldn’t be surprised if they would’ve acted like this if no one disconnected and you still beat them. I just kill them ASAP so I can move on to a full game.
---
Even though the killer has the weapon, it's still a 4 vs 1 game, with 16 perks and 4 items versus 4 perks and 1 item. Killers without Franklin's or Ruin probably shouldn't be taking matches with four toolboxes in them, or at least should have the option of playing a stronger killer to compensate. 
---
Survivors can't see the killer because if they could, then they might as well just remove killers like Nurse/Billy/Huntress/Doctor from the game because they could never get matches, survivors would only opt-in against weaker killers. There'd be even less variety than there is now. This isn't an issue on the other side though because survivors all play the same, Jake gets matches just as easily as Nea for example. So while P3 clothing definitely gets dodged more often than default cosmetics, it doesn't create a situation where you can only play certain survivors.
---
I get you on this, but it's very likely that changing the pipping requirements is a much easier thing to change.
---
Not even that but there's nothing better than a gen popping and seeing where up to 4 people are trying to hide with Bitter Murmur
---
You sound very salty my friend
---
THATS STILL KINDA GAY ON THEIR PART THOUGH
---
I'm with you on that one, and I main Meg and loved Ashley so I would be so down with this. She was whiny af but for some reason I had to make sure she lived somehow😂

What is anti climatic? Xaviers death?

Probably waiting for patch 2.7.0. Same thing with Survivors being notified when Spirit starts phasing.

So there's definitely a double standard at play here, but it's arguably necessary because both sides having visibility on their opponent in the lobby does not have the same effect on the game.
---
Yeah, I mean, the whole system could be reworked, but this is a quick change that will make things a bit better.
---
Yep. As a clown main I can also attest to the fact that mettle of man completely screws him. So much so that I’ve even considered joining the ranks of the masses of billy mains with bbq.
---
I mean. I have 250 hours in killer and 250 in survivor.
---
Define slightly.
---
Salt is my middle name. Honestly I main Spirit and nowadays I'm thinking "uhhh holy shit this game is getting extremely one sided". Like even coordinated Survivior groups lose against my Trashy ass Spirit and it doesn't feel good to play so bad but win bc of how broken a lot of killers seem to be. Killers are getting so much stronger to the point where I think they need to back some shit up and restore some strength to Surviviors. Don't necessarily revert too much but don't make a one time use, niche perk auto countered by something that'll persist all game, ya know?
---
I almost only play solo survivor. I really can't recall any times a lobby was dodged where everyone loaded in individually. I know that I've dodged lobbies as killer where everyone loaded in individually but one or two people had bad ping, but that's it (and that sucks because my next lobby is more likely to be a SWF group)
---
Yeah but at least it's not high pitched, Lauries hurts to hear
---
This is true. I’m just saying he shouldn’t be surprised when it doesn’t work in those situations. Cannot rely on DBD to handle split second physics
---
Against non chainsaw killers, yes.
---
yes his kill is anti climactic, i remember there being such a long chase scene making him such a threat and then he just dies by one throat cut, i know the throat cut is pretty cool but i wish the scene would've gone a bit longer
---
I like how Tapps can be heard from across the map
---
I know that feeling all too well, friend
---
Oh okay. So nerf both of them. Down with cheese perks. Tie NOED to a lit totem and remove the haste, and increase the number of hits you need to take for MoM to trigger.
---
It’ll probably be fixed in patch 2.7.0. This bug really sucks. I’ve heard of people having to mend for over five minutes.
---
They may have taken a look at the numbers and saw that enough people were still making red rank as killer, and decided not to tweak it. They need to add some red rank survivors to the pool of players so the red ranked killers can get a game.
---
Solution: remove SWF, Nurse and Legion!
---
Bang we've fixed your complaints, have a nice day.
---
Why do you have to be such an asshole about it
---
KEYS WOULD BE FINE IF IT ONLY ALLOWED ONE PERSON TO LEAVE. THE HATCH STAYING OPEN FOR HOWEVER LONG IS THE ISSUE. ALSO SWF CAN CHEESE IT WAY TOO EASILY
---
Boop the snoot, whatever it takes
---
That’s ok Laurie, Kate, and Meg are all “final girl” types of say
---
Haddonfield infinite??
---
Particularly PTB Kate. She was *actually* whiny.
---
Yeah that is true. He was a douchebag so it wouldve been better if he died a bit worse.
---
Bruh... pls stop posting these links like it means anything. "They're really good players!" Okay but that still doesn't mean their idea of meta is the end-all-be-all. Moreover, Noob3 says he /thinks/ it's a waste of time. Meaning, it's his opinion, not fact. Plus he says "A lot of killers, you don't even need \[self care\] on"... "A lot." Not "all." Tru3 says "It depends. It CAN be \[a good perk\]."
---
Now for HybridPanda's opinion.  
---
"That's a sweet 30 seconds you're spending not doing gens." I'm of the opinion that my teammates' time is better spent on a gen than healing me. All it takes is one person to make an error in judgment, to lose focus, to be tired, or to just make a mistake, for the killer to get alerted to where we are and/or start chasing us. If I'm by myself healing myself, then it's less chance that multiple people can be smacked. (Inb4 "only one person can be chased at a time!" ...Billy.) What's better in the end? 16s of two people not doing gens, or 30s of one person not doing gens? Sure, if I decide to get on the same gen with the person who healed me, we can make up that time. But that's not always a guarantee.
---
"You're not saving your teammates, \[etc etc etc\]" All of which are things better done at full health, in case of shit hitting the fan. Like if you \*know for sure\* the killer is already chasing someone else, sure! Definitely risk it!
---
"You might as well just be slugged for 30 seconds and then pop back up fully healed because you're not helping the team, at all." Uhh no. That's a false equivalence, and here's why: Being slugged means being at risk of being hooked any moment the killer feels like it. Being hooked means other teammates have to waste time saving me, OR let me be sacrificed, but then be down a teammate if shit hits the fan later on. But when I'm healing? I'm not at risk of being hooked right away, no one \*has\* to spend their time healing me, and once I'm healed, I can stay alive for one health state longer (with exceptions of Leatherface/Billy/NOED), I can contribute for one health state longer.
---
He makes so many assumptions?? "You could find a teammate, heal each other up! You could be out there doing saves!!" If... you're the first and only person to get smacked? Lol? No one else is available for me to heal, no one else is available for me to save... Why \*not\* heal myself so I can potentially do gens for longer, rather than risk getting downed sooner and wasting \*more\* time?
---
"If the team's fucking dead..." Well obviously there's a right and wrong time to use self care. Again, if you \*know\* the killer is chasing someone else, skip the self care for a sec, save someone. Heal someone. Work on a gen. Whatever you want. Just know that if the chase ends sooner than you anticipated, you're at a higher risk of being downed. If all three of your other teammates are on hooks, you're injured... You're gonna... what? Immediately try to save one of them, so the killer comes straight for that area, or goes to the survivor hooked nearest to the one you just got off the hook? And then you're injured, so you get downed? Or they get tunneled and downed while you get someone else, the killer leaves them on the ground, rinse and repeat? Unless you get lucky? If everyone is in the struggle stage, SURE, you don't really have the time to heal yourself, and so you have no other choice but to try it. But if it's first hook? Hell, even if one of them IS in the struggle stage... tbh I would still self care. The time it takes me to self care so I can properly pull someone down AND act as distraction or run along behind them to take a hit is way more worth it to me than \*one\* teammate. With any luck, one of us will be able to get at least one other teammate down, and then at least one of us might be fully healed.
---
None of that thinking is selfish. It's realistic. Realistically speaking, you're not going to have the whole team survive 100% of games. Not even 90%. You're not \*expected\* to. That's not what this game is about. You're supposed to \*strive for that\*, yes, but it's not going to happen, whether that be because of perks, add-ons, offerings, teammates' skill, killer's skill, or your own skill.
---
Now onto my own reasons why I will probably play self care 'til the day DBD dies:
---
1. I don't want to risk both of us getting caught by the killer. I would rather be by myself and get chased, than the other person to get smacked and then there's TWO injured survivors to worry about.
---
2. I can just make up the time I spent healing by bringing in a toolbox tbh. Or hitting great skill checks.
---
3. I don't have to take one of the med kits out of a chest, so someone else can use it.
---
4. My teammate doesn't have to use their med kit on me; they can save it for another time.
---
5. Killers expect self care. They will go looking for survivors who just got off a hook in the vicinity of the hook. To not run self care is to encourage killers to move on, which I'm not about to do.
---
6. Did everyone forget blood?? Idk, to me it seems like risky business to keep leaving a trail behind you even when you're trying to be stealthy.
---
7. Honestly the people who make you deem it Selfish Care are the same people that, when injured, will run around the map looking for chests to find a med kit, OR run around the map trying to find someone to heal them, OR orbit a locker to avoid getting crows but be close enough to hide if the killer comes by... all while waiting until the doors are powered to steal the exit door points from the people who actually put in work. So basically... even if self care got removed from the game tomorrow, it wouldn't chance how selfish these kinds of players are. If anything, they would just waste time in even more annoying ways, like what I listed above. \*Or\* result in more disconnects. \*Or\* at the very least, make people bring med kits in more often, instead of toolboxes.
---
8. Do you even know how many... freaking... times... an idiot potato of a teammate... has not paid attention, and the killer is coming, and they're still healing me, and every time I try to run away they get back on healing me... or they're blocking the only/best way to leave... NEVER AGAIN.
---
9. Things are not \*guaranteed\* in this game! "If you know the killer is chasing someone else" Yeah ok but what if the second after you confirm the killer is chasing someone else, they decide to stop chasing that person, turn around, and see YOU on the gen? Wouldn't you rather be healed up than injured?? So you can at least contribute by being the New Chosen Chased One for longer??
---
10. In the end, I don't feel like self care is ruining the game or anything. If your teammates are selfish with their self care usage, guess what? They'd be selfish even if they didn't have it, just in different ways. Otherwise if they're not selfish, what's there to complain about? If anything, it just makes the games a little longer, more tense, more enjoyable, etc. If you're salty that people don't let you get those sweet sweet altruism points, then that's selfishness on your part anyway? Make up for it in another category, or by unhooking more people, or being distraction. You have options. Don't try to shame people into removing one of their own: healing themselves.
---
This has been me, apparently triggered enough about a perk in a video game to write a freaking essay.
---
You do realize everything in Battlefront II is unlocked at the start right? The skins are the only thing you need to actually grind for.
---
I have Iron Chuckles, Dweard, Mustache jake and I think leather hoodie? I think most of them were from a cosmetic DLC  I bought I don't remember which it was.
---
Nah, I’m not going to debate with you. I’ve seen you posting around the subreddit to know you’re incredibly biased, hard headed and turn to aggression. with you it’s pointless
---
I will if you agree the "99% of Self Care users run to the corner" statement is within that realm of hyperbole as well as OPs implication that it's a useless perk. The perk isn't as good as it once was (obviously) but it certainly isn't useless.

I also love how he looks at Dwight like, "You thought I didn't see you, weakling...?"
---
im not saying hes the best, because hes not. But didnt that video feature 3 SWF with flashlights constantly trying to get a flashlight save and none of them did? And he got all 4 players? Sounds like its accurate to me.
---
lmfao I didn't even say anything rude to you at all. And I'm not biased in any way. You're just mad that someone has the audacity to present arguments for killers.
---
These changes should also be implemented for Killer. That way we don’t black pip or depip if we kill the Survivors too quickly. This would also make Adepts slightly easier because we don’t have to play a perfect game to get them (Changjng the requirements back to just a 4k would be a much better change though).

Your a real hero

yes it does.

DERANK SURVIVORS WHO PURPOSELY DC!
---
I clicked on your profile and [this shit](https://np.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bbicp7/well_it_was_a_nice_two_weeks/ekjt92s/) is the first thing I see
---
But I'm the biased one holy fucking kek lmfao
---
Oh jesus, I didn't realize she was that young O.O 
---
As for the community joke that flew right over my head lol and I've watched almost every season.
---
Because the customer is always right and is owed everything?
---
It say announch that noed is being used from start and make it so that the first hit you recive wont deal damage as a survivor.
---
The Hag is actually young...and also a killer.
---
or when a survivor just juke his attack and he thinks that was DH. whatever, he's really a lovely guy but i swear, he's so awful most of the time when he plays survivor and sometimes i feel like he's sandbagging his teammates unintentionally
---
Lol thanks. I try.
---
And on the other hand, [i actually give good advice to people playing survivor](https://np.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bbptvo/why_i_dont_think_that_the_chapter_the_darkness/ekkkve9/)
---
hmm
---
WAS THIS ON MACMILLAN?
---
I'd rather just light it up like Ruin. Hex perks are supposed to be massive risk, why NOED gets to be as safe as it is considering it's power is well beyond my understanding. But the devs have a seemingly clear bias towards killers so hey wtf do I know
---
This is a meme right? 
---
The killer controls the game. 
---
And yes, I ALWAYS point fingers at the asshole crouch walking up to me as go into struggle. Or the ones that farm me in front of the killer. Or that cute Dwight in a locker. Or that meg trying to bait the killer on people repairing gens. Or that Feng that looks to damn good in a dress. Or when they sprint burst away from We’ll Make It. 
---
The trend just seems to be more brain dead killers now. 
---
As someone who plays both sides... survivors deserve to die. They are the worst beings on this planet. :3
---
But not by tunnels, farms and face camps. 
---
Idk where I’m going with this anymore.
---
He’s a mid tier Killer who is fun to play as and against.
---
PALE ROSE
---
Can we also buff Pig to make her stun noise louder? She deserves it.
---
we dont bring that demons surname in this household
---
&gt; I've put on Resilience for my always injured build, it actually feels pretty decent. You only do things a little faster, but it works on everything.
---
Yes, that's one of the reasons it's great (although I don't understand why it works on snapping out of it, jigsaw boxes, but not mending).  It used to be even better since it was stealth-nerfed when they removed the vaulting speed bonus when they updated vaulting a couple odd months ago.
---
Make her stun noise louder? I'm not sure I understand what ur asking
---
Implying my health is toxic.
---
Didn't make sense not to kill for fun
---
To be honest after the release of Adiris I'm sure we gonna get a pirate at some point
---
ALRIGHT THEN IT WASN'T ME LUCKILY xD
---
Your main gets smart but your team gets dumb
---
Damn did I strike a nerve? Keep cherry pickin my dude lol
---
When she gets stunned, make the sound she makes louder. As in easuer to hear.
---
Would that be a buff for her? Bc that sounds more like a nerf
---
DO IT 
---
DO IT
---
*JOSH INTENSIFIES*
---
I SAID DO IT
---
Oh shit!! Thanks man
---
I would kill for a Chris/Dwight skin
---
Her stun noise is so CUTE survivors will walk to her.
---
EEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH
---
Hopefully dedicated servers will fix a lot of the groaning. Being hit through windows and pallets will definitely decline if the server confirms hits rather than letting killer confirm hits.
---
PEOPLE RUNNING AWAY FROM ME WHILE I TRY TO HEAL THEM EVEN WHEN THE KILLER IS FAR AWAY! JUST LET ME HELP YOU!
---
There are a few of these on console....
---
I see. I play Spirit so I hear a loud and deep fried "AUGGGGGGG" if a pallet drops anywhere near me. You should have seen me jump when it first happened I was like "what the fuck was that sound"
---
THE BNITR (BIGGEST N[WORD PASS] IN THE ROOM) AWARD GOES TO THE TUNNELING, BASEMENT CAMPING LEGION WITH FRANK'S MIX TAPE.
---
Really, they dropped the vault bonus? I never knew.
---
I like when they look back to see if you are still chasing them and they bump into stuff XD
---
A little bit, yeah. I hate being called biased when I'm really really not. You're a survivor minded player, so you don't experience this, but anytime someone offers a killer sided opinion you just get dog piled with downvotes with no replies or only sarcasm, and yeah, it's fucking triggering and I don't want to play nice with a user base that does that.
---
Like I said in replies to other comments here, taking Self-Care is NOT bad in its own right, like OP is suggesting. Using it without moderation, that's bad - and that leads to frustrated teammates.   
---
I fully understand the negative connotations of this perk, but I disagree with the statement that everyone who uses it is a noobie that doesn't know how to loop.
---
Noy gonna lie. I would not mind piggy stun noise on a loop.
---
I do because it’s stupid not to. Why let a hate message make you cry? Lmao.
---
DCING IS NOT KINDA GAY, ITS BIG GAY
---
Maybe the spirits movement speed should change depending on how long the charge was. More potential for some sick as mind games.
---
&gt; Tie NOED to a lit totem
---
...You mean how it already is?
---
It did but it's not about what actually happened. It's a meme.
---
Allllright then
---
TEACH THEM THAT IN THIS SITUATION GENS ARE FREE REAL ESTATE
---
And by the same token, the killer has to let everyone escape.
---
&gt; I'd rather just light it up like Ruin. Hex perks are supposed to be massive risk, why NOED gets to be as safe as it is
---
All it takes to prevent it from proccing is spending 70 seconds to cleanse 5 totems spread across 4 players
---
It's not tied to a lit totem. It's tied to all dull totems and lights one up when the gates are done.
---
Light it up at the start of the trial. If you are so concerned that ur NOED is gonna get countered run Thrill of the Hunt
---
I don't run NOED.
---
&gt; It's not tied to a lit totem. It's tied to all dull totems and lights one up when the gates are done.
---
Oh so it is tied to a lit totem, just not the way you like. Again, all it takes to prevent NOED from even proccing is spending 70 seconds across 4 players cleansing 5 totems.
---
EXCEPT I still can’t ready up after it hits the 15 second mark :) devs can’t do a fucking thing right.
---
TBF ANY BP OFFERING OTHER THAN CAKE/PUDDING OR BPS ISNT GONNA GIVE BACK ITS PRICE MOST OF THE TIME. I JUST THREAT IT LIKE A BLANK TILE IN THE BLOODWEB AND AIM FOR PERKS/GOOD ITEMS/ADDONS INSTEAD
---
You don't have to be a dick about it. They're people too
---
Yes and the natural state of the game is "every Survivior for themselves" unless ur in a coordinated SWF group, those totems aren't gonna get cleansed. And what If ur in a SWF group and you and ur buddy focus on the totems, but the other two buffoons on ur team gen rushed and got them up and running before y'all found all 5 totems? "It's your fault for not cleansing totems" bitch I was in the *MIDDLE OF DOING IT WHEN MY POTATO TEAMMATES POPPED THE GENS BC THE KILLER SUCKS AT APPLYING GEN PRESSURE*. 
---
Every other hex perk is tied to a normal lit totem and so many of them are less impactful than NOED. Why does NOED get to be literally the safest hex perk while simultaneously being one of the best
---
Ok.
---
Omg I can’t tel you how many times this has happened to me, or trying to juke the killer with a pallet watching behind me if he’s coming only to mess up and put the pallet right in front of me instead of behind me lol
---
I FEEL YOU MAN, REPORT THEM AND MOVE ON NOONE DESERVE THESE ASSHOLES
---
Stop spamming this sub with this shit lol
---
Try playing console. Rank 10 as a survivor I have to wait 20 minutes for a game at 4pm.
---
Someone has to do it!
---
wasnt there some rumor that it increases the chance to jump off
---
used to atleast
---
She sounds like she's midway through having a good time.
---
TIERED 3 UP MUSIC EARRAPE INTENSIFIES
---
As the others already said, dont be a fucking dick about it.  
---
Ever tried constructive criticism instead?  
---
If not you might want to, cheers.
---
I could hear a Dwight scream from halfway across the map and I'd recognise it.
---
Thank you so much! &lt;3
---
See, this confirms the OP - none of that is toxic. Tbagging is just psychological warfare, unless you're doing it when you've already won. i.e. sitting on the hatch or in the exit gate.
---
Nah Nurse really isn’t that good on console. Spirit, billy, huntress, even Myers and Hag are better. Been a high ranked survivor since I got the game a little over a year ago and I’ve never ran into a godly nurse like there are on PC.
---
Oink Oink! -&gt; PALLET! -&gt; Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaak. :3
---
&gt; unless ur in a coordinated SWF group, those totems aren't gonna get cleansed
---
Weird because I cleansed 5 on my own the other day.
---
Also I run Thrill a lot just because so I know for a fact that even coordinated SWF don't do totems. 
---
Survivors don't even try to do totems. At all. So yeah, I cannot entertain this argument that cleansing totems is not a valid counter until survivor players actually start trying to cleanse totems. It's the embodiment of "we tried nothing and we're out of ideas!"
---
&gt; And what If ur in a SWF group and you and ur buddy focus on the totems, but the other two buffoons on ur team gen rushed and got them up and running before y'all found all 5 totems? "It's your fault for not cleansing totems" bitch I was in the MIDDLE OF DOING IT WHEN MY POTATO TEAMMATES POPPED THE GENS BC THE KILLER SUCKS AT APPLYING GEN PRESSURE. 
---
Yup, that's how it goes when you willingly play a game with other people. Sometimes they aren't going to do exactly what PickCollins wants. The failure of survivors to play well does not equal a necessity to nerf NOED
---
&gt; Every other hex perk is tied to a normal lit totem and so many of them are less impactful than NOED. Why does NOED get to be literally the safest hex perk while simultaneously being one of the best
---
Because:
---
1) NOED can be hard countered before it even activates
---
2) Having a lit totem for something that's doing nothing is patently absurd
---
MAN, KILLERS WHO TRYHARD EVEN WHEN THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE DC.  NO, LETTING THE 4TH PERSON FARM WITH YOU AFTER YOU TRYHARDING THE OTHER TWO DOESN'T FOOL ANYONE INTO THINKING YOU AREN'T AN ASSHOLE STILL EXCEPT YOURSELF.
---
You're speaking my language.
---
Why not use the self care slot for another good perk to escape chases? I don't run self care because every time I manage to escape a chase, I can consistently find a teammate to heal me back up faster than self care would.
---
Checked on ps4. still depip -2
---
Mettle, it's too useful not to use.
---
Me and my friends used to go with 
---
What is love 
---
Baby don’t hurt
---
Don’t hurt me
---
No more
---
OOOOOOOOHHHHHHH NOOOOOOO!!!
---
She curved her vomit ;)
---
The reason that Devour gets a totem at the start is because it becomes relevant very early on - at two hooks. Same for Third Seal and Lullaby.
---
NOED is not like other hex perks which is why it is not spawning like other hex perks.
---
&gt; Also, it's longer than 70 seconds bc you have to look for the totems, the killer will be keeping a sharp eye on at least one totem so you'll have to stealth ur way there or get one person to loop him/her away from the totem so you can go do it. 
---
You don't have to "look." You easily find totems just by going about the map to do everything else like gens and saves. Heck, you even have perks to help you if you really find NOED and cleansing totems that much of an issue.
---
&gt; You tie the crutch perk to a normal totem like every other hex perk (you know, the non-crutch ones) and lookie there it's less of a cheesy bullshit perk
---
This is nonsense. And you know that. You're advancing this argument because you realize that this would make proccing NOED impossible and survivors will have to do very, very little.
---
Again, once you guys start actually even trying to do totems and it still is not viable I'll entertain this. But, *agan*, you guys don't.
---
Literally this week
---
Clearly you are as every comment you’ve made to counter mine has been wrong.
---
You save 2 seconds on opening doors, 1 second on destroying totems, and I don't think the 9% bonus is enough to make a huge impact on the speed at which you vault/unhook.
---
Not to mention that the **7** seconds reduced repair time (assuming that you're working by yourself, if there's more people on the Gen the perk gets even worse than it already is) is not enough to make up for the fact that you're going down in 1 hit for the whole game.
---
Even if you aren't running Self-Care, there's many better perks that you could run before Resilience should even cross your mind.
---
Degrade? You are taking this rather personally. The overall point, which may have not been communicated well, is that doing totems is not hard and that survivors just don't try.
---
Normally I don't DC. It puts the team in a really crap position, and I know I wouldn't wanna be DC'd on, either. I did once or twice out of frustration, BUT... I was Dead on Hook anyway, so at that point it didn't really matter and I didn't want to wait for the animation.
---
Now, my friend I play with... my god. The amount of DCs. Even when we're playing SWF. And on vc. So he can hear how badly he dicked us over and yet he still does it. smh w h y
---
True Detective has nothing to do with Horror/Slasher tho?
---
Oh, man... I'm losing it at this title!! XD
---
I know people say Hag is a wendigo but like, we have Billy and Bubba. It's power could be the heat seeking vision
---
I HAVE SUCH BAD INTERNET THAT I CANT PLAY KILLER, AND I LOVE KILLER!!!!!
---
They cant incentivize with dc penalties until they get dedicated servers to tell who is at fault when the leave match button is not used.  Ranks arent ment to be rewarding but to provide matchmaking vs appropriate opponents (which it fails at horribly)
---
As I explained to you elsewhere, these perks also activate extremely early on. The difference between having a totem for them at activation and at the start of the match is essentially nonexistent which is not true nor NOED.
---
Are you serious?
---
When someone said "Read" because you didn't read what I said you told him to suck your dick... That means you're mad. And then when I told you you are a toxic player you said "Ok. YoU wAnT a CoOcKiE?" So it is pretty clear you are a bit mad.
---
DUMBASS F-KING C-NT TEAM SELF CARE IN THE BASEMENT AGAINST LEGION. IT'S NOT LIKE LEGION'S ENTIRE POWER IS BASED AROUND MOVING FAST, SEEING SURVIVORS WHO ARE HIDING, AND NOT NEEDING TO HEAL AGAINST THEM.
---
Hive!
---
Bring a sword!
---
All survivors auras visible with 40 meters unless they are motionless
---
damn they dropped the vault speed bonus?Only reason I was even using it
---
When I first started playing the game on ps4 my skill check button was L1 and I had bad input lag. So I failed quite a few until I bound it til X and learned how to time it. Back in those days I panicked when I heard a heartbeat lmao
---
I know but they do hunt down a group of sick killers and psychos, I thought it would be interesting to see them in this
---
Can you show where they changed it? I absolutely lost two for DCing last night.
---
MoM is unpreventable on most killers whereas DS only works if you're tunneled and picked up within a minute. Definitely MoM.
---
Nice try, but stick to your day job. Maybe drawing will be more of a don't then a should. The proportions make my eyes bleed. And not in the good way.
---
I think that OP meant tunneling instead of camping
---
&gt;NOED is not like other hex perks which is why it is not spawning like other hex perks.
---
That's right. It's not like other hex perks. Bc it's a giant load of horseshit that rewards bad killers who can't apply gen pressure. Fuck, dude I main killer and even I can see that. 
---
&gt;You don't have to "look." You easily find totems just by going about the map to do everything else like gens and saves. Heck, you even have perks to help you if you really find NOED and cleansing totems that much of an issue.

Yes and if I elect to hard patrol a totem, them gen rushing isn't an issue since I can just insta down all 4 of them, and there's nothing they can do about it bc I made sure that one out of the potential 5 totems that NOED could have been in was not removed. No amount of "small game" is gonna change that. 
---
&gt;This is nonsense. And you know that. You're advancing this argument because you realize that this would make proccing NOED impossible and survivors will have to do very, very little.
---
No. I'm advancing this argument bc Noed is a crutch perk that rewards bad killers. If you can't kill Surviviors before the gens are done, you do not deserve a haste, insta down, and lowered attack cooldowns. You deserve to *fucking lose*. The only killer I don't say that about is Freddy. I main Spirit, NOED has popped up in my bloodweb so many times that I was eventually forced to buy it, but I'll never use it bc I want to actually improve. I barely play Survivior. I have a level 25 Meg, that's it. But when I do, and NOED is being run, it's the biggest load of horseshit on the planet. If the Surviviors complete their primary goal, they shouldn't be punished bc of some secondary demand that they had no forewarning about.
---
Borrowed time saves maybe?
---
Leatherface cosmetic idea: choose which survivor's face LF wears over his own.
---
Okay so tie it to a dull totem. *1* dull totem. Not *5*, *1*.
---
/r/raimimemes
---
I threw him through that window.
---
Seems stupid to just make fun of him when hes right. Surely there's plenty to make fun of him for when hes actually exaggerating or complaining.
---
Anyone have what was originally posted? I'd love to hate on it but it was deleted.
---
TIL i'm a mentally handicapped pigeon. maybe i should look into getting my flair to state that.
---
Do those not count? If that's the case it needs to be fixed so they do
---
I admit they don't, but that's bc it's a giant waste of time and is extremely killer bent. Dull totems are meant to be useless, not one of 5 potential spawning points for a crutch perk that rewards bad killers who can't pressure gens. 
---
Compromise. Tie NOED to a dull totem. *A* dull totem. Not *five*, *one*.
---
I like that everyone can't just run the current meta perks because they either don't have them, or haven't found them yet in the web. It makes me play other perks that I originally put off as useless. 
---
I also take advantage of the entity when picking things on the tree.....letting it cut off huge sections to save me a ton of BP. Learn how the entity works on the tree to "power level" your characters. 
---
I actually really like starting over on a new character to start their route to their unlockables. Like I said, I get to play with perks I might have otherwise never used, and my playstyle with that character kind of gets formed by the bloodweb rather than just jamming my same playstyle with every character.
---
I DC against every killer but Trapper. Too much killer bullshit in this game tbh
---
The proportions weren’t meant to be perfect, it was done quickly
---
Man, you Pig lovers are weird on another level
---
FAIR POINT, BUT SHE'S STILL NOT AS ANNOYING AS A KILLER WHOSE POWER IS TO MAKE SURVIVORS DC
---
When I first started, i thought that it meant that the killer could see our aura so i kept running around the map
---
christ its just a meme
---
I think a lot has to do with ranking being bugged so ppl have the “I got nothin to lose if I leave so gimme the fuck outa here” bullshit mentality. It’s like the cherry on top of all the other stuff ppl have said in other comments. 
---
Few days back I did a test where I DC 25 times in a row (at the end instead of going out of the gate I DC at the exit line). I was rank 12 when I started. After 25 DC’s I was still rank 12. 
---
If they fixed the rank bug I bet DC’s would go down. IMO they should replace the DC penalty with -10K BP per disconnect that stacks into the negative. It would suck if the game crashes but I would put up with that to actually be able to play the game.
---
Ikr stop reading into it and laugh at my funny meme I worked hard on
---
There’s a ton of people on this sub that constantly shit talk him. There’s nothing wrong with saying it should at least be accurate.
---
Awesome
---
Fuck, man.  I've never laughed so hard at one of these before.
---
I'm arguing against the very nature of the perk. Counterplay does not absolve something of being absolute horseshit and promoting of bad gameplay, and this argument isn't even exclusive to DBD. 
---
Widowmaker could shoot the shit out of Mercy in Season 6 of Overwatch, that doesn't mean Mercy wasn't busted as fuck. 
---
Old decisive could be countered by juggling, that doesn't mean it wasn't busted as fuck. 
---
I have many more examples. 
---
It's the nature of the perk that makes me think it needs nerfed/reworked. Noed rewards bad killers and punishes good Surviviors, as Surviviors have to complete their primary objective in order for NOED to activate, while killers need to fail theirs. 
---
By your logic of what is "untenable", old decisive strike should still exist bc it had counterplay. Don't tunnel the obsession, don't go for greedy hooks, slug, juggle, etc. 
---
By your logic of what is "untenable" Adrenaline should be left fucking untouched since it has counterplay. Kill them before the gens are done (ya know...like ur supposed to). 
---
By your logic of what is "untenable" you would be defending Mettle of Man, saying that killers should focus down the Survivior they're chasing instead of hitting and running since that counters it. 
---
But hey I don't see any of that, no it's NOED we have to defend on these grounds, fuck Survivior perks right?
---
The [Historic Tale Construction Kit](http://htck.github.io/bayeux/#!/#%2F)
---
Good idea, but wasn't the recent DC nerf supposed to limit how much people could DC in a match? I thought it was that after getting unhooked, and when grabbed by the killer, you can use DC, but then it's unusable for the rest of the game.
---
I like playing against him because he encourages me to play less stealthy.
---
SURVIVORS
---
Poindexter "Fool" Williams (The People Under the Stairs) - I'm sure there are probably laws that prohibit a child character being in a game like this, but I think it'd be fun running around as a smaller character and you could come up with some really cool perks based off of things he does in the movies.  You could bring "Daddy" in as a killer and the house as a new location (Killer exclusive hidden passageways would really spice up game play).
---
Ichabod Crane - I never knew this, but apparently Ichabod means "without glory", I feel like you could come up with a really cool selfish perk based on that.  I also feel like we don't have a good scientist survivor so I really feel like Ichabod would be a really useful addition to the survivor line up.  You could use his background in forensic science (if you're using the Burton Ichabod Crane), maybe he can see "scratches" caused by the Killer?  Chemical compounds?  steampunk/burton-esque cosmetics?
---
Better NOES survivors - I feel like Quentin gets a lot of crap so I'm not going to pile on, but having a NOES DLC that doesn't have Nancy as the main survivor is sacrilege.  If you don't like Nancy, you could also use Glen (though at that point Mr. Depp might be getting pissed about how often they're using his likeness).
---
Edgar Frog (Lost Boys) - Would be really cool to get a Lost Boys-esque Santa Clara Amusement Park.  Urban decay.  Carousels.  Roller Coasters.  Chases under the boardwalk.  Corey Feldman in a camo shirt and red bandana.
---
I don't think it would be done in a million years, but a dream Survivor addition of mine is the character "Sex Machine" from the movie "From Dusk 'till Dawn".  He's played by Tom Savini and he's kind of an eccentric leather bound pervert.  He's got a codpiece revolver that he can whip out in tight situations, and yes, it's basically a gun that pops out of his crotch.  You could even do a new level "The Titty Twister" a desolate dive of a strip club in the middle of nowhere.  If you wanted a killer I would personally add either "Satanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek's character)" or Danny Trejo's character "Razor Charlie (vampire version)", or "Chet Pussy" Cheech Marin's character.
---
Lol that perk will change your life.
---
Rank 20 - frindly nurse who's ony trying to get a hit but gets frustated with imprecise blinks and fatigue
---
Rank 10 - gets a better knowlege of her power as well as of tricks and jukes pulled by survivors
---
Rank 1 - no pain, no gain
---
lol, rip sabo squads.
---
STOP QUITTING WHEN FOUND 1ST AND GET DOWNED BEFORE FIRST GEN IS POPPED, IT MAKES THE GAME BORING FOR KILLER AND UNFAIR FOR SURVIORS
---
OH HO HOOOO
---
Yeah sounds like Looney Tunes and his butt caught on fire.
---
i like the token idea but seeing the repair progress makes it a little too strong imo. killer could just hold onto the token and use it to track gen progress for the rest of the game. or slug a survivor, smack a gen then hook them so they can get both benefits with no downside
---
As of the moment only reason perks like this are bad is because of the potential of the Gen Rush.  MoM does not really bother me all that much. It is nothing compared to the old DS
---
Are you kidding?  I get an erection when I hit/hook a Feng and Claudette's moaning when she's injured is sweet, sweet music to my ears.  Especially if it's a P3 clicky-clicky Claudette.
---
Fine its a meme.  Doesn't make it less true.  Hes a content creator that gets shit on a lot here. This is low effort and shit since its not even accurate. Its a shit meme attacking someone just because attacking him gets karma. Its stupid and it should be called out.
---
Her beautiful screams are an acquired taste, I admit.
---
I just started watching it. It's the episode where jack black tries to become part of the study group.
---
I just like playing against her because she's different. 
---
Not yet another totem hillbilly or legion.
---
pls stop
---
This is currently happening to me at 6pm. It makes me hate this game
---
You have a single Dorito but have 2.5k gummys
---
Ruin would be busted if thy did this lmfao
---
Lullaby would probably be fine tho
---
Now
---
i agree with you. sprint burst really just ends up wasting me a whole lot of time because i walk everywhere to save it
---
What? It's terrible for Nurse. Probably second worst with Lery's.
---
You can't cancel blinks on the top floor and it's full of line of sight blockers.
---
Spirit can't rely on moving grass to track people.
---
Part of the problem here is that killers like Hillbilly's don't care, but all the weaker M1 killers (especially those that are heavily reliant on having particular perks, and so can't as easily throw in Haunted Grounds or MYC on a 'maybe I'll get lucky and it'll give me something' basis) are the ones who suffer most. Imagine if the old DS was back, but it didn't work on any of the killers already B tier or higher.
---
Yeah feels like it.
---
Yeah idk...
---
Every time I see or use a bps one of 3 things happen:
---
1. The killer goes full tryhard and tunnels/facecamps us to death
---
2. The survivors play super immersed and all pop gens ASAP like a well oiled swf
---
3. Killer/some survivors dc 
---
It’s crazy to me how many people ruin a good thing lol
---
Be sure to report the other 4999 of these guys too.
---
I feel like acting is a perk that hurts more than helps. I’d rather bleed more and never make noise (a worse version of iron will). Noise will get you killed way more often than blood splatter will.
---
Yeah, I made a post like this months ago about cosmetics
---
In the starting chat, I usually type "gl hf". I waited til I had someone say "you too" or something like that so I would use the only BPS I had. It happened, popped them and got stuck in a loading screen.
---
Was there about 7 minutes and it said I was disconnected from the host.
---
Legion players: “why don’t people like legion!?”
---
Also legion players: “and now to abuse a known exploit”.
---
I see we have an office fan in our midst
---
I hope they realise how bad the system is
---
GENIUS
---
It’s literally so sad. I haven’t played much at all since the matchmaking revert because I don’t want to play lobby simulator.
---
Someone who knows lol
---
Still gotta find a team mate though. usually in the time it takes to find one you could have self cared so the "time constraint" argument for not using it I always find funny. There are other reasons to not run self care but that isn't one I think.
---
I’ve seen plenty of the killers who can one kit complain and laugh at survivors using mom or ds lol
---
Hasn't this been posted before tho? I clearly rember seeing it before the Spirit got out.
---
I’ve been thinking of it since before the shaggy memes, but just never knew how to get the idea out there until I found the sub reddit
---
Doesn’t everyone play against veterans when they just start? Someone could be playing COD for years and get paired up with new players. What about Overwatch,  Siege, etc. That’s how people learn to play the game. Hell, when I stated DbD, there wasn’t any tutorials.
---
Can you actually link it? I am very curious as i Heard about it but couldnt find it anywhere
---
Jesus Christ you poetic god
---
Is this actually real?😂
---
You’re insulting a 30 minute drawing, you know that right?
---
Jep it says so in my game
---
Sadly it's still counting minutes...
---
And blonde.
---
Well, except meg kinda.
---
F
---
I got both skirts from Poshmark, so I'm not sure where they're originally from, I'm sorry!
---
I like that, that's the coolest reply I have ever heard. I'm actually jealous I wish I had a family like that.
---
That’d be sick tbh
---
Rawr
---
The devs want the survivors to be relatable, someone who you wouldn't bat an eyelash at. Ergo, they're all at least modern-ish.
---
AYeee mvp
---
Nooo
---
Haha.. Kid lover.. So people know where your priorities are, right away.. 😂
---
lel it took me 600h to give 2 p3 survivors all the perks in the game + levelling up mainly 4 killers.
---
One week isn't really enough for 1 character. Especially if it's a survivor as they have 65 possible perks. That's 50 levels + another 145 level 50 bloodwebs (that cost a lot more BP).
---
For a total of 195 bloodwebs.
---
And it'll only get worse with future updates.
---
Haha.. Legit just came here for this.
---
Yea unless there was a bug, the emblems are saying your exaggerating your contributions. The rank system definitely has issues, but not at rank 15
---
Bahaha
---
Oh dear
---
You made me look behind myself
---
HONESTLY UNTIL THEY FIX THE SYSTEM TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF INCENTIVE NOT TO D/C THE GAME IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN TO FAVOR KILLERS. IT'S TOO DAMN HARD TO POP 5 GENS WHEN YOU'RE DOWN TO 3 OR 2 SURVIVORS VS. A SWEATY TRYHARD.
---
BRING ON THE SALT, IT ONLY MAKES MY OPINIONS WORSE
---
Ohhhh noooo
---
&gt; azy to m
---
yeah like when i use BPS i expect a killer to understand that i want to have a good amount of bp's at the end and i expect they play so they can have a lot of bp's too, like to not camp or not tunnel, cause when i play killer i just play hit and run with the survivors and try to hit gens and smash all the pallets
---
Combine it with sprint burst and you got a deal
---
Bahahaha
---
*my niece is Sardinia*
---
It might not be faster in every case, but why take self care when teammates can heal you way faster...
---
Yeah I’m 90% sure the altruism badge bugged out cause I got a save with borrowed time and I don’t think that counts as a safe hook rescue
---
just fucking give me upvotes
---
But I want Tiffany Valentine :o
---
Just don’t see why the devs thought this would be a good idea for a killer. They should have their speed be equal to the survivor to at least make it somewhat fun to play.
---
Yeesssss
---
You said you got 2 saves though.
---
Im rank 21 nurse Q_Q
---
The second wasn’t a hook save just a body block so I guess that’s kinda misleading
---
Pennygaddie: Legion's backstory but translated to 5 lenaguages
---
dedicated servers are coming this summer
---
Different chase themes for each Killer. The game's music is awesome and I'd love the chance to hear more of it.
---
Do you have a link? or a how to description
---
When have people not dc'd against her and when has she not been the decidedly best killer in the game?
---
Because it is common knowledge?
---
I’ve asked others in the stupid question thread and everyone said it was 1 to 1. Thanks for making me get a useless perk reddit. And if you manage to get 99% recovery whats the point someone will just pick you up. The most situational perk i can think of where you’d have to run unbreakable and boil over for any use
---
Been playing this game for a while now never seen bbq and chilly in shrine of secrets ever :D
---
Pair that with streetwise and a med kit and you can drop those numbers down even more and get more use out of the item.
---
I got you [https://youtu.be/-1qju6V1jLM](https://youtu.be/-1qju6V1jLM)
---
I wrote "useful" not most useful :) 
---
Yea well sprint burst isn't the greatest thing ever, but it something.
---
It helps especially noobies to maybe loose the killer a little easier.
---
Lets be honest for a beginner it is easier to play killer than survivor.(from my experience)
---
i mean, i never do that unless the other person signals that they've found the hatch
---
Good luck. Everytime I see a post about tunneling or camping ppl bash on the person who posted and takes up for tunneling and camping. I mean there's a lot of ppl who don't like it even as killer but I bet most of the comments will say stuff like "if I see a survivor get farmed I'mma go for the easy kill" or something along those lines.
---
Never
---
Otherwise bodyblocking and taking hits becomes even more of an issue
---
Also a Bloodpoint decrease is never good since it is basically a punch in the face for doing your job and you get less anyways from tunnling
---
Why dont we just make it so survivors that just got unhooked become invisible?
---
Also they get 900% repair speed for 27 minutes.
---
It isn't a meta perk, it is a situational perk, like nearly every perk in dead by daylight.
---
When you’re completely out of the loop and realise they’re coming summer....
---
I've seen some nasty nurses closer to the red/purple ranks on xbox the last couple months, so usually if I hear one I just assume it's because they actually know what they're doing and it's gonna be a painful game.
---
https://imgur.com/a/cMzKydQ This is from a game vs a sfw at the Iron Works of Misery. it is 3 Ire and a silver. I stop going after a guy when they ran to the Iron Works and I had no way to saw them before they got to the window so 4 times max. about 0.1% off from sawing past a hooked guy to get to the OoO user. This game was a 4k one gen and all 4 hooked 3 times and I piped only once. I wish I saved more screen shots of this but this is the only one I have.
---
man... those one word replies are gruesome
---
FIX THE HITBOXES YOU FUCKING CUNTS!
---
It was twice in there in total I think
---
When they named their usernames to have toxic in it. Anyways, the idea is their only goal in the game was to chase after the killer and blind him, instead of using the flashlight as a tool that helps them escape.
---
besides me (shameless plug), I'd say No0b3. He is funny, entertaining and you can learn SO much from him if you main survivor. He's good at killer too though he doesn't play it too much
---
I mean maybe not on the front page. But rest assured if his name is brought up then people will respond to make fun or shit talk him. There was a post when the ranking system came out about how he wasnt a red rank survivor and he got shit on. Among others. 
---
Regardless, again, yes he uses clickbait its the nature of youtube, but there are far more overexaggerated titles literally posted yesterday so this "meme" is poor. It comes across as just poking fun because everyone else does it rather than because its true.
---
no
---
Are you rank 15? I think they set a floor so you can't depip below that. At least, not by leaving.
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
Me, rank 16, also failing skill checks bc I'm a nervous lil bitch
---
I didn’t realize this was the rule. Phew good to know I can DC against good SWF groups
---
Youre welcome!
---
Any attempt at slowing down gens will directly benefit campers.  For this reason I don't want to see anything done to slow gens down further from where they're at now.
---
Not influenced by pack mentality like the wild dogs they have to chase.
---
This is funnier than it has any right to be lmao
---
I didn’t cover everything. Discordance would definitely need to be adjusted.
---
When Laurie came out...oh my God. My ears.
---
I usually run SC because I don’t have many perks on my survivors that I really care about, and then I don’t have to worry about niche situations where SC is actually good (2v1 if the other guy is in chase and there’s no way to pop the last 3 gens, I’d rather heal myself so I can try to save if possible or look for the hatch without screaming in pain every 2 steps)
---
Yes but that’s the point of keeping multiple survivor gen times the same.
---
So you were telling the truth just not the full truth.  You never mentioned the chainsaw.  Either way, I was right.
---
&gt;“I would Dc cause this is lowkey unfair and incredibly annoying to fight but I won’t cause I play the game”
---
SWF is not balanced at all but solo survivor is hell right now since chase was nerfed, ensuring that your teammates are being efficient is the best strategy.
---
I don't play SWF (i enjoy the chaos of solos most of the time) but I don't blame people who do SWF
---
I REALLY THINK RUIN IS TOO MUCH OF A BAR OF ENTRY FIR NEW PLAYERS AND THE MINDSET STICKS. IT TOOK A BIT FOR ME TO GET NY FRIEND TO NOT OBSESS OVER RUIN AND JUST DO GENS
---
FOOKIN DED ARD
---
Instead of saying "needs 2 killers" it lets you go into a lobby?
---
This is true. Consider the fact however that killer camping is a symptom of generators going too quickly. They want to secure a kill to take someone out of the game as quickly as possible. They wouldn’t need to do this if my proposed changes were implemented.
---
Pharmacy is my dedicated SC replacement. The green medkit is clutch sometimes
---
Yes please
---
What sucks is that I can never take it off, because whenever I swap it out for something else, I run into a situation where it would have saved the day.
---
I count the guy who dced as I was hanging him despite it being two minutes into the game and I only have one perk because I'm level 4.
---
Oh so the same logic doesn’t apply for the other side. Got it
---
And I almost only play solo survivor so hard disagree on that
---
and a brick
---
Wtf. I play about three matches per night at least. Sometimes more. Never once played Plague ever except one time.
---
I mean im just here venting about what I don't like. Go off. Get it allllll out of your system.
---
Let’s downvote the haters
---
You have far too much faith in players that engage in this behavior.  You could make gens take 3 minutes a piece, killers that camp will still camp.  Those that approach the game this way do so because it's far easier to play this way at least in terms of getting a kill then being bothered to learn to play aggressive efficient killer games and chase and down multiple survivors.  Also a large sect to it because they genuinely enjoy griefing others.  You will never stop players from doing this so we simply need to make sure we don't balance the game in a way that plays into their no skill playstyle.
---
I USED MY MORI AND DIDNT GET MY KILL I FUCKING HATE THE HATCH
---
YOU PLAY HAG WITH NOED. YOU ARE PART OF THE REASON WHY NO ONE LIKES KILLERS
---
