I'm gay but damn that's too much I'm never gonna unsee half that shit 😂😂😂.

Game skin and character designers are for the most part graphic/3D designers. They have likely 0 skills for programming. You can’t just pause their job for other people to work harder? No expect them to do that job. That’s not how that shit works. I agree that the game needs a health boost, but skin design is a completely different department to bug fixes. Yes the game programming design team have that job, that’s what they are still doing. U can’t expect an employee to stop doing their job...
---
Yup, this is the big one that messed me up at first.
---
Me neither if you know what I mean
---
are these going to go on your redbubble account?
---
I'll say it:
---

---
Ebony Moris and Skeleton Keys are crutches and don't have any place on this game.
---
Change my mind.
---
There I've said it. You can downvote me now.
---
Yeah, that's why I primarily come here for the memes and to everyone now and then give my opinion on something.
---
The fact that the Entity forces her to give her current victims a chance to escape must be horribly frustrating for her.
---
I played as him and against him and no he doesn't get his power "that fast". Especially at the beginning of a match he is incredible weak because he just has his M1 and nothing, absolutely nothing secondary he can do. And after that first hit, he get about 2/3 of his power charged and has go chase the survivor. I hooked multiple times a survivor and the power was about 90% filled because I didn't got enough blood when hitting, chasing, collecting.
---
In addition to that.. what about hillbilly? He has unlimited chainsaw with huge map control and he can instant down too. Oni isn't that strong and I find all of his add-ons nearly useless (I only like the pink ones)
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
...Yeah? I've been agreeing with you dude. I never said anything about stopping the art department's job for game health, that's ridiculous. They do cosmetics, that is something completely seperate from design and programing. That's why I said the DESIGN team needs to look into a health patch, not the art department.
---
I was just saying I think the meme is just a joke and people shouldn't be taking it so seriously.
---
The totem spots on the new map are so good. It's often impossible to find find some totems because they are always hidden behind bamboo in completely new spots.
---
i _knew_ bhvr would work with netflix again for a new dlc
---
I literally watched saw 3 last night so this was fresh in my mind
---
Fun fact, the actor who was on "the rack", the limb twisting device, said in some behind the scenes interview that the prop he was strapped to was surprisingly comfy, kinda ruined the scene for me knowing that
---
This is the likely answer. I don't know why, but red rank survivors act like it's impossible that they'll get hit. I get so many free kills as a green rank purely because red ranks just suddenly forget how to play.
---
sure but getting hit while vaulting when there is a 4 foot gap between you and the killers weapon is frustrating, and telling someone "on your screen he was behind you" doesn't make the situation feel any better. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
dedicated servers are objectively bad right now and they need to iron them out asap but i dont think we'll see any fixes for a while if it all
---
One of the things I do in some other games to improve performance is to lower shadow quality or turn it off when given the option tbh. I can understand why that's not an option in DBD on PC though.
---
Killers can get stuck on lockers and generators after interacting with them. I’d say it’s broken when people can’t play the game
---
He’s really fun but completely unplayable on some maps.
---
Why would they all keep running at him like that? Like... that’s.... why? Didn’t people learn to not do that when leatherface came out?
---
Mori's and skeleton keys are nothing alike, Keys require the player to survive long enough to use them whereas Mori's are just treats for tunneling
---
Well then maybe you should point out what I misunderstood but I don’t think that’s the case whatsoever
---
The hunter has become the hunted
---
Well thank god it's in the game because there's red and purple rank would be just about unwinnable for survivors if looping pallets whernt used.
---
Thats what he wrote
---
*casually walks in the other direction
---
I feel like no one here actually read what the killer wrote
---
Assassin's creed gone wrong.
---
Found the survivor main.
---
You forgot "free legacies for every fucking casual" on the top tank.
---
Ah once again bad wording on your part. Dw bout it. Either way people genuinely seem to act like skin design is an issue and they should focus on big fixes. And there are defo people in this thread that think that. It’s just dumb seeing the same complaint constantly when it’s not even related
---
Wait, what the actual fuck? If you run in to Oni while the smash animation is going on can you still get smashed? I thought once he hits it's just for show. Damn!
---
In all my hours playing DbD, I have NEVER come across survivors who "play fair" or played nice.  They all play dirty because they're trying to win. 
---
Do you remember when the BNP was instant?  That addon was treasured by survivors because of how dirty it was.  It was so dirty, it was nerfed twice!  
---
I never saw survivors apologize for that and I never see survivors apologize for keys now.  And yet, the killer is made to feel guilty for wanting to win or burning an Ebony.  This is what I mean by double standards.  Keys are not even close to a Mori.  Killers sacrifice the match for it most of the time and yet survivors can still "win" with a key whether it was a good match or a bad one.
---
It'll finally have its use
---
To all the dumbs downvoting this that’s not the window it’s too big just look at how massive it is compared to spirit this is the fence along it the window is to the right
---
Ah I remember my first time the survivors three genned themselves. 
---
Only I was playing Hag with three token Devour Hope.
---
Pink cosmetics.
---
Okayish on console, top tier on PC.
---
Yea luck hates me i just got empathy from the shrine for blood points and went from lv 36 to 39 with 4 brand new parts and no DS
---
We love you!!! :0
---
Once you get the teachables the survivor you play doesnt matter, they become skins.
---
Dude, you’re getting trashed on for a joke
---
#feelsbadman, would give you a gold if I had money to make up for it
---
It isn't considered now, OP was referring to the original release of dbd. The devs intended for players to be more immersed than many are now, hence why pallet looping was literally busted with the early version of dbd with instant face vaults, pallets back to back, vaccum pallets ect.
---
* Running BBQ for the bloodpoints mostly. Would you recommend ditching it after grinding out the hag/plague/clown perks? Or is the aura on hook worth the slot on trapper? (I always feel it's hard to see the auras)
---
* NOED is there purely for lack of better options, might replace with brutal strength and then later with bamboozle.
---
* I find whispers solid for patrolling, as it saves time in getting close enough to hear/see gens. Otherwise I'm pretty bad at using it. (considered using bitter mumur instead). This'll likely become pop goes the weesil once I get clown to 40.
---
Thanks!
---
Get decisive strike while it’s still available in the shrine.
---
On the surface, no, but they did a great job fixing what was the spaghetti code of Siege and implementing ways of turning off broken operators and events and such. While it may seem like it did nothing, it made it so awful bugs like the Jager shield glitch or the Hibana pellet server crash bug would be able to be handled efficently and effectively. At least in my opinion. L
---
I dont give a shit about people "being forced to say sorry" its the fucking killers fault for saying sorry in the first place. Balance both keys and moris. Moris are unfair for survivors and keys are unfair for killers
---
[removed]
---
is he talking about the ultra rare cosmetics given out for free this patch or did they add actual pink colored cosmetics for someone?
---
Would you prefer loopers and immersed blendette gamers? honest question.
---
I probably shouldn't ask for a tutorial since I *p r o b a b l y* don't have the required pieces.
---
10/10 recommend PGTW. Easily one of the best killer perks in the game if used well.
---
What even 😂
---
I just downvoted myself because I just realized i read it wrong and i feel stupid (also i didn't even know my karma was so low in that comment
---
Unless I want a LGBT+Q colored gen! XD
---
Nice
---
I would rather have to take time finding survivors then walk in a circle for 2 minutes only to move to the next loop
---
Yes it does, they can't free themselves from the hook
---
I straight up thought you were pulling my leg for the obvious joke
---
#BRUH
---
Like you’re supposed to be able to do
---
Wow well worth a post
---
I thought all these DLC packs were already included on Switch apart from Stranger Things, doubt they’ll do a new one for one DLC
---
She had a cool animation, but they nerfed her by removing it.
---
Scott jund: 50 4k’s in a row with oni
---
This guy: Oni is trash.
---
No I hate that survivors think it's cool to give free hits it's so annoying just leave
---
I know. Thankyou for the reminder.
---
Nah, he needs to be a survivor. \*oni runs at him\* "Oh fuck off you big stupid looking prick: \*oni smashes himself\*
---
Instead of a heartbeat, his insults become more aggressive as he gets closer
---
It would literally help you get survivors into the injured state before you even start a chase, the same as Wraith. Wraith, trapper, ghostface, Myers, Hag, etc. have powers that don’t necessarily help in chases if you use them incorrectly. What’s your point? I can’t believe this started from an offhanded comment about how busted Legion is and what he could’ve been - I’m not even thinking about this concept I could care less if it was in the game because I’m a Jeff/Billy main anyway
---
I finally got down into the purple rank after sitting in green for quite sometime. I didn't used to need Ruin, but now every match I play it's a must have in my build. I used to feel like there wasn't a need to rely on it...now I see there is.
---
True for survivors only, Legion will always be Legion.
---
Oh your a blendatte
---
Dead by daylight is absolutely a casual game, but I refuse the idea that this is a bad thing. Additionally, the game has become much more refined over the years to allow for players to take the game seriously and play at a high level, the game is still problematic for a tournament setting, and it can only work if completely new rules and mechanics are applied. Of course that’s just my two cents, but I think everyone needs to chill out and relax. How do you feel about the matter?
---
Is noed a killer ability?
---
You're*
---
day of the dead skin
---
You mean Neon Joey?
---
“Those Blasted Kids Again”
---
@ me watching the guy who let me die on the hook.
---
"WHAT A STUPID PLAY."
---
Sorry, man. Keep at it, bc there are survivor mains like me that rarely survive 😂 I'm rank 11, but when there is someone else on the hook I can't leave. This ends up in my death 😂
---
Okay so your whole team dies with no gens done, you watch killer close hatch and then you open it in front of them. Yeh seems balanced, you’re skilful buddy
---
I trash talk, but very badly/weirdly. Like if I am going against a killer who has royally fucked me, for whatever reason, I'll say some shit like, "Yeah put me on the hook you 10 toe having bitch."
---
That's the thing I've been playing the game long enough to sell you that it feels like half and half. People take the game seriously when they want to win and has a killer. That's what you want to do because getting destroyed feels absolutely terrible. Survivors I would say is akin to playing casual mode especially if you're with friends otherwise everything feels a bit too competitive for my taste
---
He's talking about the free ultra rare cosmetics. It's a fairly common thing to refer to an item by the colour of its rarity.  
---
I believe this stems from World of Warcraft, way back when people still played it, but I could be wrong on that.
---
No killer would camp if it wasn't viable. But there are so many survivors that don't punish it by rushing gens and escaping that killers can still pip off of it. Bad survivors boost bad killers.
---
He also ate a dog in the first one when sheriff bracket and Dr Loomis are searching his old house they found a dog that was eaten which Loomis responds “he got hungry”
---
Add on: Gain T3 instantly (one time use)
---
Yep! 
---
Standard Huntress ammo limit is five hatchets, you reload by checking an empty locker. That number can be changed depending on Add-Ons equipped.
---
anyone else think this was some special edition that would include the Nightmare on Elm street DLC to celebrate quentin's face getting overhauled?
---
I predicted Tenacity , I’m a god now
---
Any killer can be strong once you slap that pink add on
---
What’s the range you can get for matchmaking? I’m Rank 6 killer and get matched with rank 2 and 3 swf consistently
---
she's got the aesthetic for it, torn leggings and oversized hoodie with converse is trans culture
---
Yeah, Because a randomly spawning hatch that lets someone escape if they found it first is totally cool right?  Lol Not to mention how mori's are in no way comparable to something like a key. You have no point, Just complaints. Way to go kiddo
---
Yes. Do you know how to obtain it? Was it a holiday event?
---
I mean abusing infinites is really fucking scummy, and I'd consider it toxic but I ain't gonna call someone toxic over it.
---
I never liked her default hair that’s why I would always use relaxed bun
---
Yes
---
mmm... yea it does, if he can do it, everyone can right? or scott is sorta of a robot machine who hacks?
---
No, there are certain situations where a killer will slug a no mither.
---
LOL that would be amazing
---
ITS FUCKING RAW YOU STUPID FUCKING IDIOT
---
Fucking hell. I literally just finished leveling up clown to get pop
---
Oh wow that must be pretty nice to get when you’re killer
---
Oof
---
fuck yea
---
Yet you’ve mentioned it numerous times... keep spreading that positivity brother!
---
Take a break, i took a 1 week break, so has No0b3, it helped me just forget about the game and after a while i felt ready to go back to hell
---
It tries to match you as closely as possible, trying it's best to match within 6 ranks. The two exceptions are SWF and the longer you wait the greater the chance is you'll be over 6 ranks
---
Dwight is getting a Christmas elf cosmetic later on in December and Meg is also getting an outfit in the same collection but it's not really Christmas themed.
---
what would be his wuote when someone fails a skill check?
---
I use those and Brutal Strength with Surveillance
---
It would be so good!
---
Ragequitting is much easier to do than hook suicide, and takes much less time. Suicide is more protracted, and requires more steps to leave the game. Ragequitting is basically walking out of the closest door and nothing stands in your way, and hook suicide is having to sign out of the building first. And you might've changed your mind by then. Besides, 90% of the time when a teammate is downed _I'm on my way there_, and they won't have time to suicide before I'm yanking them off that hook
---
If you spend 2 minutes at a single loop, you are doing something stupidly wrong
---
I've been laughing at this for far too long.
---
173 Marv...
---
Oh wait
---
No skins are on the DLC page other then a few skin packs from a few years ago, there all in the in game store
---
Fantastic album if you're a metal fan by the way.
---
Pop goes the weasel is an amazing choice. It can buy you so much time throughout a match. Otherwise an underwhelming shrine.
---
Your luck is yes
---
KYF is the mode that allows you to do this. It wouldn't be a good idea in ranked matches because people would all dodge Spirit or Freddy or whichever killer everyone is saying is OP from week to week, leading to an increase in queue times.
---
No one said anything about infinites. Specifically talking about regular loops. You know, going from loop to loop that has a pallet. Waiting to drop it to break bloodlust and go on to the next loop.
---
Does the Xbox game pass version have everything unlocked, or do you still pay for dlc?
---
Just don't buy the skins. I only ever buy skins when I've got extra money to burn, otherwise I just buy what skins I can with the shards I get from leveling up.
---
I've seen games with much worse money grabbing cosmetics, (Rainbow 6 with their Alpha pack only skins, Apex Legends locking cosmetics behind other paid cosmetics, COD with their loot boxes), I feel the devs did just fine when it comes to cosmetics in DBD.
---
I have Prestige 2 Lvl 50 on Claudette and no Plunderes
---
They will spawn more 24 hours after completion
---
Such a dumb argument. If he didn’t want the door 99’d he should’ve opened it

please, everyone, go to mathieu's twitter and write: What the fuck are you doing you fucking donkey! bring us Gordon Ramsay and Fuck OFF!!

just kidding: be nice to him:)

Tposing spirit

No, not everyone can 4K with gimped leatherface. Scott is much better than the average player and doesn’t represent the majority of the playbase.

Pop nice
---
before you ask, yes I made this, this was voiced by my friend ZombieSMT, and he's saying "it's time to take my medication. For my heart-"
---
Nah the ideas of rewarding for rank needs to happen, I just thought that 150 perk rank was a little too high since at rank one you'd get 2850 from one category and if you got rank one on both sides itd be enough for half a character just from playing the game plus add the shards you get from leveling up
---
Is this real?
---
But SWF already have access to this information, including where both the survivor and killer is and where they're heading
---
That rank disparity is disgusting. At least they had to do all gens before using the key
---
I’ve literally never heard anyone call them anything other than dreadlocks in my entire life
---
3Head?
---
Oh awesome! Thanks
---
Probably not unless you don't mind frame drops. You *can* do well with him but Billy feels much less terrible to play IMO.
---
Congrats u earned longer queue times and sweatier games
---
Much appreciated, I’m trying to get better with the flashlights. So useful!
---
Yeah that's messed up, the queue is only supposed to put people who are within 6 ranks of each other together
---
He doesn't count hatch escapes as 4K's sooooo
---
Also, how dare BHVR make a strong killer that survivors require extra time to learn to fight against.
---
Will do
---
Meanwhile im crying bc i can barely steer with him on console :,)
---
You are joking right? Hes like billy but a stronger power in general but requires a build up. He has better mobility than Billy and can get multiple survivors in a go.
---
You still getting some work done on it right...?
---
This goes for just about any competitive game across the board.
---
Never was this more apparent for me than when Yun and Yang came out in Super Street Fighter IV, were declared the second coming before EVO, and...had exactly 1 player (one of the best of all time) make it to Finals with Yun.
---
Very experienced players are still people, and when they don't do well against a character because that character is NEW and novel, and they don't yet know how to counter it, there's a tendency to just throw up one's hands and declare the character is "OP."
---
Blue skin woman=spirit
---
Hehehe give upvotes
---
You "congratulated" me for saying that I didn't want to overpay for something they spend a few hours on and mass sell. The confusion stemmed from your lack of proper grammar usage, and the inappropriate use of a word. 
---
Then again, it doesn't surprise me that "jorts dwight" would sell his soul for an outfit.
---
50. Consecutive. 4-kills.  
---
(only exception: last survivor hatch escapes)  
---
"...going on a hunt to get a character that is fine nerfed"
---
 ಠ\_ಠ
---
I think Moris should only work on death hook. That way people can’t really complain about it because they’d be dead either way. I don’t think keys for hatch should exist period.
---
Please no 😔 my boi doesn’t deserve it
---
yeah obviously his fucking most powerful build is good but you can’t go by that. wraith lacks. he has no chase power, no stalling, and a tiny bit of map pressure unless you have windstorm
---
Yes, above the eyes need some shading the artist forgot that part but other than that don’t know what else to get added to this particular one.
---
Did you just comment on a reddit post? That's kinda toxic, bro.
---
Throw on some jordan 1s, ooooo. Would make me actually use the perk
---
No, if ghost face looked that bad no one would play DBD.
---
That doesn’t sound like a good killer... was he a baby? lol
---
Did you just call me toxic, that's pretty toxic.
---
Holy shit
---
This is a heartbreaker for me as I just came back after a long hiatus too, and have fond memories of Legion. I love how active BHVR are with the online community, but part of me thinks it causes them to over-correct slightly as the character went from great-to-maybe-a-bit-OP to now bordering on useless.
---
It’s the power icon not the model of ghostface... log on play a game and look. They are sketch’s.
---
His dash is super useful, but requires some using to it. It’s distance is not constant, and grows significantly with the holding it down for a bit longer. Pallet breaking is fun too.
---
So people just don’t like him? Or is there a reason, I rarely play against legion and when I do I haven’t found a reason to hate him.
---
To counter getting hooked just don’t get hit
---
Yeah he played him for a day an went: 'wait a minute...'
---
No..... first... don't do that to teammates. Running straight to them the second they're hooked, if killer sees, just means the killer will stick around.   
---
Second, again, no. Takes less than a few seconds once hooked to burn through attempted and immediately die. Again, once the DC penalty start working, people will DC less and die on hook more so they can go straight into the next game *rather than receive a time out penalty*. If you'd read the notes, you'd know about it. Suicide on hook *will* be the faster method once it is fully implemented.
---
It would be nice if reaching rank 1 actually did something useful lol
---
Nope, Legion, Plague, Michael, Freddy, Ghostface, Pig and Leatherface are not included either
---
Bless be the entity for giving me another chance to grab PGTW
---
I was thinking about buying the clown with shards so I didn't grab it and ended up buying Freddy thanks to the black friday offers.
---
Yeah, guys, it was me ~~Dio~~ who wanted a perk we already got a month ago. You can blame this one on me.
---
To counter noed, just clean totems. Lol
---
I can't even imagine being THIS dumb...
---
Yeah let’s take him from meh on console to utterly unplayable. Thanks.
---
Or maybe I want to just show people a cool album that reminded me of a game I play a lot? But, judging from the rest of your profile, you seem like a miserable sap most of the time anyway.
---
You seem to miss the point. I do want to support them for the work they do. I am more than willing to buy DLC's that add to the game and bring in new gameplay and new playstyles. Yes, i could play against the killer, get some perks, and enjoy the new map for free. BUT, i think they deserve money for that work. The only thing that i am saying is that they are overcharging for the skins that they are selling.
---
The only way to make change is by voicing your opinion. If enough people think that the skins are overpriced, they might change the pricing. I think that a mark that many developers miss is pricing. More people will buy a skin they like if it is more accessible in price. If people kind of like a skin, but it's only 2 dollars, they might just buy it. If that skin is 10 dollars and more expensive that DLC expansions that offer 2 characters and new perks, then people are not going to waste their money on the skin.
---
*Laughs in console* 
---
He is no threat to us.
---
and this game is considered horror? since when?
---
Stand name: Michael Meowers
---
Stand master: Michael Myers
---
Yeah it's a problem for him and ghostface - dedicated servers make your stalk meter rubber band back. Not much you can do about it until BVHR fixes them
---
Cool, thanks. I have the game on steam, was just wondering how they did dlc with a game in a subscription service
---
It’s for frequent dcs
---
&gt; but i've played against her and she's still powerful.
---
It's because they nerfed her in the completely wrong spot. 
---
It wasn't her power that was good, it was her lack of information she gives. Think Demo but he had no animation when charging his lunge, or Billy if he had no animations or sounds when charging his chainsaw. Every time she phases it's a coin toss for survivors and that's why she's still good.
---
Pretty cool idea actually.
---
Wow stalking a profile to win an argument that didnt started
---
Thats just sad, maybe look into the mirror you miserable sap
---
I voiced that i don't buy the skins because of the pricing. Everything i have is earned or bought with iridescent shards. I bought one DLC PACK of clothing awhile back which came with a ton of outfits because it felt worth it. Buying one outfit for a character that costs more than a DLC just doesn't do it for me. TBH, more people should stand up for themselves and not overpay for the product. I think that rallying together to encourage them to make the skins more affordable makes sense.
---
because you dont have a smart answer, you proceed to call me a big dum dum... nice.
---
That was so truly fucking awesome luck
---
Fucking empathy is in the shrine every 2 weeks holy shit, I’d rather see vigil in the shrine

They aren’t over priced, a cosmetic that doesn’t do anything has no value. So it can’t be over priced. As you said it’s a waste of money for a skin, you aren’t forced or required to buy one. Get a job

Neeeeeerd

“A player that is skilled at the game performed exceedingly well with a killer most survivors haven’t adapted to facing yet” not exactly grounds for a nerf in my book chief

It’s enough to heal you once extremely fast

I’m on console so that might be why and thanks!
---
You mean half of everyone
---
I agree. It happens at red ranks somewhat frequently as well. If survivors depip when getting farmed and rehooked, killers should depip for doing this as well.
---
Worth it

Who needs bear traps. Just have the survivors be barefoot.

Slow survivor action speed down. It'll take longer to heal or repair or do anything... and they stack with Sloppy Butcher and Thanatophobia.

---
Bristling fur
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong. Play however you want. But if you're the fucking type of killer. That will hook someone. Camp around the hook. See someone unhooking. Purposely wait and instantly down the unhooked person. Fucking kill yourself genuinely. I hate this game for that
---
This is why I never remove Borrowed Time from my "serious" builds. Instead of ranting on the other player which happens to be how the majority of killers play and getting frustrated with the game, adapt. Punish them with Borrowed Time and hope the unhooked guy has DS or knows how to loop to punish him even further.
---
 Huntress's sister?? and if this is a thing this will now rely on your call of duty aim
---
So basically shit takes longer
---
Imagine arguing with someone whos clearly jking and you still take it seriously, just look at all my responses. haha
---
Yup. A lot longer if you stack the addons and perks in the meme
---
But the feature only activates when a survivor is in a chase, and SWF can already relay that information when the killer starts chasing them. This doesn't tell you where the killer is at all times or even where they are. It just tells you someone somewhere is in a chase and gives arguably less information then a SWF would already know. Devs are balancing around SWF so give solo players the same information the SWF would get.
---
DBD community - - &lt;these shoes&gt;- - Fishing community
---
&gt;I agree. It happens at red ranks somewhat frequently as well. If survivors depip when getting farmed and rehooked, killers should depip for doing this as well.
---
So killers should depip because the second survivor was inexperienced enough to unhook without BT near him? Sure.
---
The true David perk
---
i feel making demo better would be by just increases undetectable duration or giving him a short slight speed boost everytime he comes out of a portal, also possibly increasing the range of pounce but thats just a possible im not sure if thats needed.
---
I'm still learning loops on certain maps but I can loop a killer. I used DS and just happened to run into a trap I didnt notice. The Map I was on had so many dead zones of nothing.  And just gah. I play alone. I'm a higher rank but I'm ALWAYS getting rank 15+. Without a doubt every time and I just get farmed
---
I would like to add on this. One of the particular reasons that Demi is so bad, is that he is so. LOUD. Every time you land a hit, every time you miss/hit a shred, every time you teleport, every time you place a portal, the survivors know. They know where and what you are doing 90 percent of the time. When they hear him screech it’s a mental note of “he’s not looking for me. Do gens” and a “he just teleported, go for the unhook” while I believe that his portals do get cleansed too often, If you place them right next to gens it either counts as tracking, or time not spent doing gens. If the gen is below 75 percent, most of the time they’ll cleanse the portals. This buys a ton of time, and is really a good investment of yours. That’s all.
---
90% of people go off to a corner of the map and self care. Its annoying haha. But pretty much
---
He shoot, He sacrifice, but most importantly...
---
He ALWAYS comes back
---
You're welcome
---
Well, to be fair escaping the killer graps gives you 500 bloodpoints on survival category which happens to be the worst category for survivors. You get 5k for escaping and some points for self-healing so DSing the killer is not a bad thing.
---
Honestly even something as simple as "only has a global roar when downing a survivor" would be a nice touch up
---
where's dead hard? :(((((
---
i feel like this was made by a survivor main...
---
Your insult doesn't work if it doesn't apply to the person you are insulting. Anyhow. 
---
https://store.steampowered.com/app/627510/Dead_by_Daylight__Charity_Case/
---
Here is charity case. It comes with 26 cosmetics for the price of 5 USD. This means that they are selling it for about 20 cents a cosmetic. But, 3 pieces of a Yui outfit somehow costs 10 dollars. 
---
Based on the evidence in the past, they could sell the outfits at a more reasonable price. Instead, they overprice them and sell them for 3 ish USD a piece. And you need 3 pieces for the whole outfit.
---
I am not required to buy a skin, you're right. That doesn't stop me from thinking they look cool and wanting one. The difference between you and I, is that i am not willing to overpay for something they COULD sell at a fair price. Also, i'm not going to attempt to insult people directly on the internet because i disagree with them.
---
There’s more survivors in F13th and it’s way easier to be killed. One cool thing I thought DBD was gonna have that F13th did have was proximity chat. In F13th you would be able to hear other survivors and Jason if you were around each other.
---
Noob3 has his 50 plus escapes on a row. Is that not evidence that survivor is OP?
---
Also has anyone even tried this with another killer? If you really think this is the case, I would encourage you to message Scott and ask him to try. I 100 percent believe he could.
---
Tru3 very likely could create a streak similar to this with how he’s playing Wraith right now. Would you call him OP?
---
They're not reworking her face. I just found these in the game files. The current in-game models are based on them.
---
50 back-to-back games in one session against red ranks who have likely practiced against the broken ptb version. 
---
it's not like it's a bunch of baby Dwights and brand new Onis flailing about.
---
again 50 games, in a row, in one session. Trying to justify that, at that point, is beyond a stretch. 
---
even the best make mistakes, a 95%+ winrate is absurdly high even for experts.
---
I know, it's insane
---
Oh I'm sorry I thought someone who was joking meant there was a joke to tell in the first place this isn't funny it's just stupid
---
Really Bubba's problems stem from his add-ons not really being compatible with his power since he doesn't even have original add-ons
---
How do you do that?
---
Y E S P L E A S E D E V S
---
there's infinites on like half the maps. Maybe not without the balanced passive anymore though. still a  good number of them.
---
It’s the player that’s good, if the player is good with him, he should be able to 4K pretty consistently. N00b3 escaped 50 times in a row, does that make survivor OP?
---
Sorry for the quality
---
They reworked haddonfield? What's the loop?
---
I mean if people choose not to heal then wtf is the point of running Sloppy? It becomes a waste of a perk slot.
---
Hey how do you put a link into text
---
For doctor zap someone before they reach a pallet or vault, this stop them, then wack them and your done.
---
Well it's your lucky day, I'm a rank 1 survivor, first things first, know your loops don't be afraid to explore, get better at all skill checks it'll save you big time with ruin, try to remember hatch spawn locations, pop a gen/hex totem in front of killers face to increase toxicity, learn how to 360 a killer, get better at mind games, get to know your killers it will increase your looking and mind gaming knowledge, learn how to fake a pallet throw and fake a window vault, killer will think you will throw or vault so they will back up and or go to other side of window and most importantly the best window fake, run for a window and make it look like you're going to vault it with killer behind you then 360 him or her right at the window because the killer will try to swing and think you will vault it and if you're lucky enough actually vault the window really fast after the killer swings because you'll have enough time, if you're not quick enough they will smack or grab you.
---
Those are my tips to learn, there are more but just get those basics down and you'll see results, don't give up every failure is a chance to learn and improve you'll get there but only if you're willing to endure the struggle and pain and toxicness.
---
The master has failed more times then the student has tried.
---
No insane is thinking this is funny
---
I have bot teammates. I can't help that and have to suffer because of it
---
lol this is hilarious. I literally just said the same thing to OP
---
I also think I know what his reply will be: he’s going to insist that only 4 person escapes count despite killer and survivor being too different
---
Adding to your answer:
---
\- It it not possible to lose a pip ("depip") until you reach rank 15, so 16-20 are safe.
---
\- The 13th of every month, rank reset happens. You lose one/few ranks, but you won't ever go back to ranks 18-20.
---
\- You're supposed to get matchmade with players around your rank
---
\- General consensus within this community is that rank doesn't determine skill, because most idiots who play a ton in any given month can reach red ranks, however there is a correlation.

---
If it was autistic, it would do a far better job.
---
I can't. It hurts my soul too much. Hell I was only playing wraith with brown addons but apparently having 3 perks that don't help me win was just too much for red ranks.
---
Pop and Tenacity were some good ass grabs for me
---
Which loop is that first one? And yeah, the cow shed loop is unbalanced af but definitely not an infinite. They need to add a door next to the window or something.
---
&gt;I have bot teammates. I can't help that and have to suffer because of it
---
So blame your teammates, not the game nor the killer.
---
It's like no one remembers the knee jerk castration of poor Freddy.
---
Until we get something like that, I’ll run empathy or now Kindred. Empathy might be a bit better if the SWF you join up with rarely gets on the hook.
---
More like when u have DS and u get slugged
---
You really overestimate how many people play the PTB and how much they play it
---
Examples?
---
Trapper's new ability to immediately step into his own traps definitely doesn't seem to be according to design, and I don't think it's intentional. It was an unannounced change that causes the killer to have to walk weird, if nothing else.
---
I've seen multiple reports of Spirit and Wraith lunge after reappearing not always working correctly.
---
Myers stalking is delayed on dedicated servers, and that's an acknowledged issue.
---
Most people don't like mending and think it's annoying. Also people say it's too hard to lose them in chase.
---
It's okay, I understand. I realize now that you have been a victim of Gordan Ramsey. Here we are joking about him, but he roasted you real good didn't he? What was it? Too much salt in the potatoes? Overcooked porkchop? A little too much sweat on the plate? My condolences to you.
---
&gt;only has his power half the time
---
That's a really good joke. 90% of the time you hook someone, do a 360 holding M2 and your power's charged again.
---
Literally speaking it makes sense haha
---
An extremely long fence near the edge of the map with a window
---
Personally I see the more people dead = the greater the victory. Idgaf about rank, and Im at rank 1 both sides. Trust me, after enough time at red you'll realize ranks mean absolutely nothing.
---
 Hold up insults where??  Stop playing a victim card. So you think that they should sell charity case for roughly 80 dollars, a CHARITY CASE. CHARITY.  Think you missed the point on games need to make profit, they make more money at this price as they know it’s in-elastic demand so they can charge higher prices and make more profit.  Also I don’t pay for cosmetics as they do not benefit me in anyway, simple.
---
And you’re doing a terrible job proving yours

The issue is that he takes barely any practice to play. NURSE takes extra time to learn to fight against, but she actually takes work to do well. Oni is just chucking on the training wheels and rolling over people.
---
Yet you’re still on my post... you can leave now. GG
---
Sweet, thanks dude
---
Good thing I am not like that
---
Can’t wait to get Steves! I feel like his p3 face will look amazing with that sweater. Super excited!
---
People overreact to the whole non-flick thing. You can still hit people with his attack just fine. Flicking isn't the be all end all
---
...this depends on multiple factors. How many survives are injured, how often they heal, how quickly you got your down and if you decided to try for more, etc
---
To say that like it’s flatly true is absurd
---
Yeah but he also struggles early game. And if you pick up a survivor (basically every minute) it goes away.
---
I don't think I've seen that one before. Do you have a photo or vid or something? I'm not at home otherwise I'd check it out myself
---
There's a couple of them. One is just a long as straight wall which by itself isn't an infinite but it spawns next to an open house with multiple drops off the 2nd story so it's pretty shitty for the killer because they can't bloodlust off of you because of it. Then there's another in one of the back corners. Usually spawns around a blue house that's closed. The loop is so long that killers lose chase while chasing you and resets bloodlust and isn't mindgame-able.
---
i cant count how many times this has happened
---
Its not an event, you have to buy auricle cells in order to buy it, like any other skin sadly
---
R u ok?
---
What? Nurse is absurdly easy to play.
---
You are ridiculous
---
Updoot galore
---
Once you’ve logged a couple thousand hours into the game, it’s not exactly difficult to play extremely well like this with most killers. In the hands of someone who demonstrates good understanding of Killer fundamentals, against Survivors who haven’t had time to formulate effective counter strategies yet, this kind of performance is typical. At least in my experience, it’s always been easy to go on an absolute rampage for the first couple weeks when a new killer drops before survivors figure out the best counterplay options. You have to give things time to settle and give people time to adapt before we decide if an adjustment is necessary.
---
As a novice Clown I'd play it safe with a "base" combo of slowdown perks - Ruin and Pop Goes the Weasel would be solid here.
---
The second pair should ideally be chosen to handle Clown's main problem - while his bottles shut down window vaults, he's very vulnerable to pallets and suffers in most chases.
---
* u/SameAsGrybe's Enduring and Spirit Fury combo is a standard method of handling pallets. Very reliable, easy to use.
---
* Otz and others will often suggest lethality perks - making each chase *count*. This normally means Haunted Ground, because instadowns, and you can run that with Save the Best for Last because Clown will only ever be smacking people with his knife. Devour Hope is also an option here, but is riskier.
---
* Last conventional combo is Thrilling Tremors and Surge. The idea here is that you get a free kick from Surge whenever you down someone, and when you pick them up Thrilling Tremors will tell you whether it's worth going to the hook or to just drop the survivor because there's a gen near you that's still being worked on.
---
For add-ons:
---
* Flask of Bleach (Rare/Green), which increases the slowdown that survivors suffer after getting hit by a cloud.
---
* Feathers (various) shorten the cooldown between bottles, which is nice as-is, but also means he spends less time moving at "recovery speed" and thus makes it easier to close in on survivors.
---
* Solvent Jug (Uncommon/Yellow) is *terrifying* for most survivors *when used right*, because hitting a cloud means no Exhaustion perks for 30s. 
---
* Redhead's Pinky Finger (Ultra Rare/Red) means that survivors are Exposed (can be downed in one hit) when struck *directly* with *the bottle itself*. It'll last for as long as the Intoxication does. You won't have many of these, and it's not easy to land a direct hit, but it'll piss people off.
---
Clouds are more-or-less Freddy puddles with benefits - you use them to stop loops. You can bottle a pallet directly or you can do a pseudo-Freddy and bottle either end of the loop *on the approach* before going right through the pallet - survivor either slams it or is almost certain to take a hit.
---
Feel free to mix things up when you have a solid understanding of Clown's chase mechanics. If you were very confident, you could even try something like Corrupt Intervention (guaranteed, unlike Ruin), Save the Best for Last, Enduring, and Spirit Fury, with Flask of Bleach and a Feather - you'd have 2 minutes to get the survivors on death hook, if not kill some outright.
---
I’m gonna have to main a male survivor
---
Jesus you really are a moron
---
Guessing PoP
---
Tenacity, fire up, empathy, pop goes the weasel.
---
He may struggle in high ranks, but he's got a few fun gimmicks no one sees coming.
---
Double Calm add-ons with Haunted Grounds is probably one of my favorites.  Play him as a normal killer until Haunted gets popped, swap to Treatment with the huge ass terror radius and find out where everyone is.
---
Sorry didn't know I couldn't specify infinites are the issue I have with loops. And yes I know what looping is no need to be an asshole and patronize me.
---
As a survivor, I got so disgustingly dependant on DH ... But if I'm being a sneaky Nancy rather than a brash Steve, SB is a favorite of mine. (Am I the only loser that have different play styles depending on the survivor skin I use?)
---
As a killer, SB is such a pain. I tend to let them go and not even bother for the chase. Legion's new FF buff is actually fast enough to catch up, though.
---
Why do they always bring moris???????
---
Right. They're doing a badham preschool style rework on Haddonfield sometime soon, aren't they? Cause from what I know Haddonfield is just an unbalanced map to begin with. Any other broken un-balanced loops? Or are they all just on haddonfield?
---
Or you could check your total bloodpoints before claiming the reward? I've lost about 200k this way but I don't think BHVR should warn players for something so silly. Just don't be stoopid.
---
That's cool, link it when you can, though that is remarkable,  we're talking about taking out every survivor 50 times in a row. Escaping can be achieved with or without other survivors and with little of your own input necessary to do so potentially.
---
As a killer,  your skill at trying to herd survivors to their death is much more strained because of more dynamic situations you must worry about other than holding m1 and evading someone. 
---
the issue is that the oni unlike any other killer makes downing everyone after one survivor gets injured,  feeding their power, snowball into a clusterfuck of easy insta-downs with the,  still extremely mobile charging and almost no real consequence for using the charge. 
---
It's nigh-uncontestable in what it does
---
Yes i know this is a waste of time but i was mad and wanted to vent about how dumb this is.
---
Thank you, I'm glad you noticed
---
I wasn't. Sorry you're sore in life over something? I was just saying that I wasn't thinking of or talking about infinites on this post or my meme. I was just explaining what I was talking about. Hopefully you feel better.
---
At the moment, 118 hours.
---
The only ones that come to mind are on that one map with the garage that has the car and normally a generator in it with two windows. And the horse track one on one of the corn maps.
---
Make it chef clown
---
Seduction? Like, sexual attraction? In a game where you're a killer chasing down people?
---
Oh boy, I can already see the wonderful headlines those gaming journalists are gonna write on that.
---
I hate that shit so much but id never blame the player for abusing i blame the designers for leaving it in
---
You just said you've lost 200k BP this way yet this is somehow a silly feature? Makes sense.
---
Good change, and when a killers TR is in range of a hook, it stops the hook timer going down too.
---
Had a rank 10 match as trapper where they played like spaghetti and all fell on the first few traps I placed within five minutes. One of the shortest games of my life. 
---
All ranks have the chance to play shit lol.
---
I'm pretty new; 'DS'?
---
&gt;You just said you've lost 200k BP this way yet this is somehow a silly feature? Makes sense.
---
It was my fault for being dumb. Once I realized it was happening over and over, I started paying attention to my total amount before claiming rewards.
---
i play a P3 Meg with almost entirely David King perks.  Not sure why tbh.
---
[Scorpionz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC115bbr48YZEIeKJ7v_DCQQ/videos) is probably the best Pig player in the game, and they run Enduring, Brutal Strength, Monitor &amp; Abuse, and Whispers.
---
Lots of footage on YouTube and on their Twitch, so you can see how they're using those particular perks.
---
everyone seems to enjoy it :) because it is stupid for you it doesnt mean it is for everyone
---
PGTW is mine!
---
It really isn't needed and a waste of time for the devs to even implement. Just look at your bloodpoints
---
Damn you're really toxic for no reason. Not really sore over anything. Infinites are still loops so there was genuinely no reason to be rude. Hopefully you learn how to be civil.
---
I usually start the search then go make myself a tea, and usually play some games on my phone. Managed to complete a whole battle royale (first match, first place!) on COD mobile once
---
dude, im the best comedian  here.
---
Decisive Strike, a perk from Laurie Strode that activates after getting unhooked. If the killer picks you up within 40/50/60 seconds of getting unhooked, if you succeed a skill check you stun the killer for 3 seconds and escape his grasp.
---
Ironworks of misery 
---
Fractured cowshed
---
Actually, any of the cold wind maps because tractor loops are broken as fuck lol. 
---
Just to name a few examples. There's shit tons more across all the maps except the newer maps. There's areas in maps where you can run T and L walls next to jungle gyms then back into the T and L without ever needing to drop the pallet at the jungle gym. These tiles are in series next to each other. You can string out an infinite between them if the killer tries bloodlusting you to death or doesn't mind game you out of them.
---
Decisive strike
---
he throws raw meat?
---
Posting in a sub reddit is now toxic.
---
Hope you feel better soon.
---
How can you find were and where autistic and not there and they're. Where de you put the line?
---
Besides "bring SWF", there's not a lot you can do about a lot of the challenges - the game's very nature makes the events in it unpredictable. I can, however, recommend Lery's + Scratched Mirror Myers for the grab quests.
---
Lol, I did all of his achievements in the red ranks and didn't have a single "struggle" early game. He's laughably easy and people who think he has some skill requirement are kidding themselves.
---
This is a cool idea, but sounds kind of useless, because it can be easily cleansed and doesn't really do anything to punish the obsession except make them a bit paranoid. You would still have to chase them down.
---
Just remember the player on the other end is a human being too. They are playing a game and you just happen to be in it too.  They probably want to win, get acheives, progress their rift, do their dailies, or just want to mess around with wired builds etc...  Some are more sweaty and unforgiving, some are more relaxed and sometimes even silly.  
---
My advise is play both sides. Don't focus on winning (just have fun).  Don't become a killer or survivor "main".  That way you can switch it up when things are going rough.  If I'm getting wrecked over and over, I'll usually switch sides and set some side goals like using new perk builds, running all looting perks, wiggling out builds, or crawl away and get up builds.
---
Yeah that says a lot of the state of the fanbase especially on here
---
I’m not spending that time but they can run you for that long killers rely on survivors making mistakes if they don’t make any than the killer loses
---
*this is what I've been waiting for*
---
No, you being a patronizing ass in your comment was toxic. 
---
Hope you learn how to be civil soon.
---
Who the fuck are you kidding?!
---
I'm having some real trouble picking up the Adept Trapper achievement at ~Rank 10 - I either stomp or get stomped, and neither does the trick for the backflip-while-patting-your-head-and-rubbing-your-stomach nonsense that Merciless requires. Any tips on milking the game to get all the emblems?
---
Maybe rework moris so that they can’t be performed a certain amount of time after someone’s been hooked.
---
?
---
Kinds-sorta what I was saying but yeah I feel you dude.
---
&gt;This is exactly the reason why I ended up leaving the game.
---
Because you couldn't understand how emblem works? 
---
[Emblems Explained - "The ELI5 version"](https://redd.it/8bvz68)
---
I usually sit on my couch watching YouTube Videos and checking my screen every 5 minutes.
---
Pillar of the community attitude there mate.
---
I wish I read the warning before playing the video. Ouch lol
---
Its the same thing for people on pc, playing killer at ranks 5-20 will leave you struggling for a game for 5-15 mins
---
No one was patronizing you.
---
Hope you get well.
---
I never really use unbreakable so is tenacity even worth it? Probably gonna use it 2-3 times and then forget about it
---
Woah either that was a long wait or a quick game. I was thinking of giving COD mobile a try
---
literally a built in perk when its shirtless david. i get distracted every time
---
In Quests there is a new tab for Starter challenges, really easy challenges to do in 1 game, and you can get Claudette and Hillbilly.
---
Says the person who thinks nurse takes skill
---
I do this sometimes too but sometimes i get too into the video and afk for a minute in DBD lol
---
Slug and then immediately pick up? Yeah.
---
He is the messiah!
---
Wd gj 👍🤠
---
Ooh that sounds pretty cool, from the reviews on release i thought it was just DBD but bad. Do you play on PC or Console? Just wondering if it's got the proximity based chat on console too, i think that'd be awesome
---
Yeah I knew you didn’t give a shit because this is because you’re bad at the game and have a narrative
---
She got that dark souls custom hair.
---
Slug, then slug two other survivors in the area, then down the no mither again.
---
Their job is to hook you, your job is to run. I thought this was common sense?
---
I mean, just close your eyes 4Head
---
At least it's part of a weak loop. (/s for anyone who needs it)
---
Any chance we get a winter themed event this year?
---
I try my best
---
even you, your wasting your time here just to say im stupid, isnt that stupid too? GOTEM!
---
&gt;You know, going from loop to loop that has a pallet. Waiting to drop it to break bloodlust and go on to the next loop.
---
Jeez guess you also have reading issues
---
Please go to school or pick up a book sometime, it'll teach you something.
---
They should up the total
---
Now the killer might also rape you.
---
Wtf? Nurse takes tons of skill. You have to have 100+ hours on her to become even decent??
---
Got lucky and got 2 hooked in the basement then found the 3rd, then 4th shortly after the first killed themselves on the hook. Initiated 4 chases and instantly finished 2/4 and it isn't considered a pip. I don't understand why BHVR designed the game to be finished as fast as possible but then turn around and make it so that if you are going as fast as possible you don't earn anything in return.
---
I didn't say she takes skill, I said she takes extra work to use, you actually have to practice how to blink and relearn chase mechanics that operate differently.
---
Oni may as well just have "press M2 to down the nearest survivor" on his screen.
---
im being realistic, im so funny! r/dadbydaylight loves me!
---
Ok
---
I get what you mean. Its fucking cancerous to be downed as soon as you get unhooked and get right back into that same stinky hook.
---
 What I advise to do is to get used to it, not intended in a harsh way. This happens all the time.  if you realize the killers going to farm you, suicide on the hook. It takes time to grow numb to dying in the game, but I believe in you, you're a rank 15, be proud of that
---
You can play however you want, but if you play like this you have to kill yourself
---
I was explaining something not patronizing. Learn the difference snowflake. The only one being "toxic" right now is you because you can't get over these stupid assumptions you're making.
---
I do give a shit,  that's why I don't equate two different game dynamics as the same when arguing it.
---
also you still haven't shown me the escapes you were talking about.
---
:/
---
Lol you blink through walls and just hit people fam
---
Lets say you finish a Trial and see that you have completed a Master Challenge. Instead of returning to the Campfire, you instead go right to The Archive and claim your reward. But shortly after you realize you had reached 1,000,000 BP at the end of the Trial, completely loosing out 50k BP. This hasn't happened to me, but mistakes do happen, and is it really a bad thing to have an extra layer of protection?
---
I am not playing the victim card. Do you think it isn't an insult to call me "jobless" or to insinuate that i don't make money? That is clearly an insult, dude. To be honest, it is not cool. 
---
What about head case which provides 6 heads for the price of 3 USD. Making the more reasonable price of 1 dollar a piece, and 3 dollars for a whole outfit. I said i would be willing to pay a FAIR price. The consumer controls demand for products. The supply prices will meet the demand. We have control over how much the product can cost with our money.

Only one here I don't have is fire up even though it's pretty useless in most instances. Still gonna cop it tho ngl
---
The ironworks one isn't *that bad*. From experience you can only run around it once or twice before the killer gets a hit. The cow shed one on the other hand is pretty bs and way too safe.
---
I have and won he has great map pressure as he’s invisible and has amazing juggling potential. You don’t chase with wraith you hit and clock then wait for them to heal or run into to you at the wrong place and at the wrong time.
---
Oni is laughably easy to juke in fury, and an be looped like any chainsaw killer without the jukes. You can hide in a locker and when he hits it, you jump out and run
---
Hes the killer.
---
Most people on COD mobile are mobile gamers, Until i started For Honour all i ever played was shooters on both PC and PS4. By that i mean, most of the other players were pretty bad so it went relatively quickly.
---
Honestly i would recommend it, thought I'd hate it but my brother nagged to try it. In fairness, the controls are top tier for a mobile game, and it feels like a real cod. Even if you don't like the touchscreen controls, if you've got a controller capable of working on a phone then they've recently added support for that. A fairly large amount of content but...
---
They try and force microtransactions down your throat a hell of a lot. Loot boxes, XP cards, etc. None of it is necessary, but it can get annoying either way.
---
If u do get it, tell me and I'll add you lol
---
STONKS
---
&gt;It really isn't needed and a waste of time for the devs to even implement. Just look at your bloodpoints
---
People need the world to be idiot proof... I've claimed about 200k even though I had max BP but still thing this idea is unnecessary.
---
Please do look up what patronizing means, you literally explained it as if it were patronizing. Didn't know I was a snowflake for calling you out on being a dick. And didn't know saying "Hope you get well" Isn't toxic mb.
---
I just had a match where I DS’d the killer at the end since I got slugged. Almost ran out but they picked me up just seconds before. I’m a good survivor so I didn’t teabag while they were stunned
---
Not gonna lie... I definitely take advantage of that iron works loop until either the killer gives up or 4 gens gave been done and then they give up. 
---
That loop is to long to bloodlust off of.
---
Ohhhh thank you very much!
---
Almost over 2 years of playing this game, I can only remember around 5 times have this happened to me. Saving someone with BT and they take the hit instead of me. There's one time, I saved someone with BT and figured they won't block for me, I 180 the saved survivor so that I'm behind him, and he get the hit instead. Little I know, he planned to take the hit anyway, so it worked out.
---
Okay, and vise versa. The killer’s job is to hook the survivor, not chase them to oblivion. Short chases for more points makes sense.
---
If you do nothing but loop instead of trying to escape its toxic
---
Otz did a [great guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C49wygOeZ5I) on this, and also one for survivors too. The video is a bit dated, but the spreadsheet is completely up to date and includes Oni.
---
Doctor is awaiting his rework, so I'd be wary about buying "for him" right now, but Hag would get big benefits from Myers - Save the Best for Last is a very strong perk on her, and you'd also have the added bonus of being able to put Myers in your rotation, and Myers is easy enough to get to grips with. Myers used to rely on Doctor's Monitor &amp; Abuse, but that has changed recently.
---
Leatherface is not a good killer, and all he really has going for him is the perk Barbecue &amp; Chilli, which gives you a bonus to your Bloodpoints when you hook someone (up to a maximum).
---
Clown is not a good killer, and all he really has going for him is the perk Pop Goes the Weasel, which does bonus regression to the first gen you kick after hooking someone.
---
Personally I'd go with Myers, and use those three killers to build up enough Bloodpoints to instantly get Leatherface's Barbecue &amp; Chilli teachable when you potentially choose him as your fourth killer.
---
Have you played nurse?
---
Are you sure you're even old enough to play this game bc given your immaturity I highly doubt it
---
My normal perks and add-ons are:
---
Both of the addons that make reloading faster, save the best for last, pop, barbecue, and a wildcard. Sometimes I enjoy having devour hope because that perk works really well sometimes. Lately I’ve had NOED but that’s because of the challenge
---
Can Inner Strength activate more than once if you do another totem?
---
Faggots are gonna burn in hell where they belong like you😂
---
Upon EGC he screams, getting louder and being audible anywhere on the map, 'The FOOKIN BASS is FOOKIN RAWW' and all survivors gain 100% speed and lose a state of their health
---
YES
---
No I'm a fan of the game I came here to discuss it and want to discuss it with other fans but people like you ruin it
---
Press M2, kill 3. That’s what I call skills.
---
That’s exactly why I refuse to play these kind of killers.
---
I main Kate too, but I went through all the characters to get their teachable. Now my Kate is perfect with her selections of teachable perks.
---
Also, the 80's suitcase has over 18 things for 3 bucks.
---
Right, never denied that the "coin toss" element was still there. Guess I don't mind it so much.
---
I didnt started as im aware... right? so who ruined whos fun here?
---
I started with David lol, didn’t know what no mither did and why I couldn’t heal when I was playing him lol
---
Good one.
---
Yeah and burned rossetto
---
It's really not my fault that you got shit this twisted over an explanation of what I was talking about exactly. The only way that you would assume anything otherwise is because you're feeling some kind of negative way. Hence, feel better soon.
---
Yeah, it can activate up to 5 times.
---
ur talking about madurity while even responding me, if I was a child, it wound t be child-ish to answer a child calling them stupid? please stop downing yourself!!!!! ur taking it so personal!!!!!
---
Survivor rank doesn’t really matter once you’re out of the yellow ranks. People are red ranks yet are still bad, it’s just playtime at that point
---
Meh people have been doing this with nurse for years, he’s also a new character people don’t know how to counter him yet.
---
Sounds bout right. Use whatever petk or offering you want but ima still scream my opinion at you cause you can either ignore it or feed it.
---
Amazing character design and animation, but yes he’s very weak, his portals shouldn’t be sealable.
---
You will he given 150,000-250,000 bloodpoints if you already have the perk. It will still take the 2000 iridescent shards from you.
---
Yeah, she’s make it so the hatch closes on you as you try to jump into it, crushing half your body or something like that. Then she watches you scream until endgame collapse kills you lol
---
Them dying =/= you killing
---
Poor pig, her perks are shit and she's below average. The only thing good about her is the surveillance/surge combo and that requires another 5 bucks in order to make her effective. If you're a pig main I genuinely respect you guys
---
Hoffman did make some unwinnable traps, but so did Amanda.
---
My things is, is if i had a full kit of crutch perks and you wanna scream at me thats fun, but noed and an ebony? I didnt even get to use noed because the game was over before the gates even activated
---
For the 2 people that would make the purchase at $2, there are already 5 that would pay $10.
---
Think about it like this.  If you made a widget and could sell it for $10 with an unlimited supply, would you change the price to $2 just to make sure more people could buy it?  
---
Just because people think something is overpriced, doesn't mean they won't spend their money on it.
---
ALL Killers benefit massively benefit from targeting the weakest link. At the very least, it gets rid of one man early
---
Huntress on ps4?
---
Being able to suicide on hook was always a mistake
---
I was here moments ago, it didn't go well, T-bag was made in the exit gate by all of them
---
It's not a matter of feeling better, yet you still present yourself as an asshole. You could've used better phrasing to not come off as toxic. I'm not necessarily throwing faults around either, you seemed and still seem as if you're trying to be rude. 
---
And adding the little questions at the end definitely doesn't help you when it comes to looking like a dickhead.
---
Lol. NOED and mori. That’s not sweat lord. Game is over before NOED even activates
---
respect to the guy who said ggs though
---
Hmm. Both Red ranks pigs I faced yesterday had red mori lol. Was a complete tunneling dick that would run straight past someone else to mori other people.
---
And thats exactly what happened lol i got a 4k mori with 3 gens left
---
Dam, was hoping for bamboozle. Got pop last month in shrine. Clown, demo and oni are the only killers I don’t have but bamboozle is the only perk I have left to really get.
---
I run both Bond and Kindred. The deluge of extremely useful information I get from both will surely make it impossible for me to play without it.
---
Plague wasn't the best idea BHVR had for a killer power. I have some friends that can't stand seeing and hearing the constant puking. Perhaps thats the case here? Since Plague is not even a meta killer to begin with.
---
I mean, some coin toss is fine but constant coin toss gets annoying. It's better to leave counter play up to play skill, not RNG. Sort of like huntress if you didn't have to aim but instead every hatchet had a 25% chance of hitting the closest survivor. Best to keep skill involved IMO
---
Yes, but Oni pushes it to a further degree.  He doesn't just get the increased pressure from it, but also it full on increases his killing power in the short term on other survivors.
---
There is no problem you can’t fix with a sweater.
---
Start [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5elu7/guides_resources_for_new_players/).
---
From L10 upwards the Entity will start taking things from the [Bloodweb](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodweb), just like the player does. You start at the centre of the Bloodweb, the Entity will start from the outside. Be sure you prioritise the things you want when you're spending Bloodpoints. 
---
&gt; *Is there anything that helps me know when i should, or at least is it confirmed that I'm likely to get a certain offering, item, or add on again soon?*
---
No, they're all random. As you level each character up, their individual Bloodweb gets larger, so you have more chances at nice things showing up - assuming the Entity doesn't pick them first.
---
Feels like it should probably halt after a few skill checks to avoid a forever struggle but assuming the killer and survivor nail all skillchecks, should the survivor then be free to go but with an extra debuff, say fully exhausted? Seems like a fair payout in a way. Either you go just injured, injured and exhausted (or something else), or dying.
---
I might be a dickhead because I actually am an asshole. But that still doesn't mean anyone was patronizing you. I explained something to you, gave you an example of it and you flipped shit with these wild accusations for no reason. That is your own fault. Enjoy your night.
---
i like that idea =)
---
How is a doctor "sweaty" and stand any chance against a 4 man? Lol
---
Her default hair makes her look like coconut head
---
Bruh
---
Also a rank 4 survivor with 100+ hours lol
---
That’s the power of bill’s mystical beard.
---
I gave you 3 pieces of evidence as to how the prices can be lower, and you just got mad and called me a "snowflake". Honestly, i find this hilarious. I just made a point to say that calling people poor because they don't want to buy something isn't cool. You can call me whatever you want, and you cannot possibly offend me. Hence, the opening statement i made, saying that your insult doesn't work if it doesn't apply.
---
Anyhow, to debunk what you said:
---
You can't examine the DLC sales on steam stores to make the assumption that the sale type here is inelastic. You need sale data and curves to make that determination. For all you know, there could be a good correlation by how much a cosmetic costs and how much they sell.
---
He just salty he lost
---
If you use electrodes you wont make the hit before a vault or pallet slam.
---
Yikes. Did you t-bag first?
---
And it even disagrees mostly that he wraith is that high of a tier. Using huntress as an example of who would be far more powerful with an iridescent and very rare add on
---
"Sabotage 5 hooks in one game with the perk Saboteur and carrying a Toolbox."
---
Use the moldy electrode and the difference in timing from the normal shock is nearly nonexistent.
---
This is a great concept, I'd love to see it in game.
---
So does Myers. "Why's he just staring at me?"
---
Yep, but it pains me when people use yellow and green shock add ons to shock in chase.
---
so a survivor walks into a club... 
---
then another... 
---
...
---
then another.
---
If you stun the killer those pallets aren't so unsafe as you can run to the next loop rather easily while they are stunned, if you do it right you'll break line of sight long enough to end the chase so it can start again meaning a reset to Blood Lust counter as well.  
---
There are also still plenty of medium loops that killers are forced to break the pallets on with Badham if they want chases to go their way quicker.
---
Nice, so we could have basically The Thing as a character without the licensing

---
Behavior said they would not do a mimic killer cause of SWF, so the whole power is neutered
---
It was patronizing because oh how you worded it, I don't believe you need to continue adding the little disingenuous phrases at the end of your statements.
---
True. I know the idea of Clowns freaks people out, if there is a spider killer to be released (unless its like Humanoid? Then maybe?) I'd probably have trouble playing this much longer outside of Killer only.
---
It's alright, but that second perk doesn't really work for other killers. You have to keep in mind how your perks will affect the meta of ALL characters, not just the one you're trying out. This would be pretty overpowered on some killers.
---
Gotta say, I DO like the concept, though. My only other gripe is that the gameplay meta might feel a bit too similar to Spirit and her employment of "stand still to bamboozle". In addition, this killer having two very powerful abilities is a little op?
---
I would either stick with just one of these powers, or nerf them both a bit. Make it easier to tell if someone's a doppelganger as long as you pay really close attention to certain details, for instance.
---
Oh yeah, those I wouldn't agree with lol maybe the green addon with the beam like tape addon if you're going for a sniper doc build, but mid chase is a big nope
---
I feel like the video Tru did about wraith shows you that you don't have to be a good killer to be a good wraith. You just have to understand how to use his power and kinda just finding people. You don't really want to loop the way he plays wraith, you just injure everyone then find them healing. Wraith can basically sneak up on anybody and then gets a free hit because of the speed boost when he uncloaks.
---
Yes, we read about this every day here.
---
These are so cute I'm in love💗
---
This is why people complain about entitled survivors. This user is so wrapped up in themselves that they are advocating their opponent literally kill themselves for playing the video game.
---
If you think for a moment that your opponent in a video game should literally die because you didn't have fun, there is something far worse wrong with you than anything your opponent may have done.
---
OP, you are a sad fucking child. You need mental help.
---
this simply shows that they’ll be angry regardless, so what’s the difference if you bring in some toxicity of your own ;)
---
Tbh tapping a button is annoying anyway so they’d be wise to just change it
---
The best demonstration of how players don't actually understand the game they are playing, the number of complaints about hitboxes is hilarious, 9/10 times it's not a hitbox issue, it's a latency issue, and the tenth time it's someone who thinks that if you stand on the other side of an open window someone standing against the inside of the window couldn't possibly stab you.
---
It wasn't a joke simply an observation what did you think the joke was
---
I said enjoy your night because that was supposed to be my last reply to you. Clearly you still don't understand and are feeling some type of way. The fact I need to even explain something as simple as this is to you is confounding. 
---
So just to be clear here. This comment here, as a whole, will be my last reply to you. I genuinely hope you have a good night.
---
I got Leatherface as the community has said and it has definitely been a humbling experience. After this rift I should have enough cells to get two more killers, not mentioning the shards I have saved up.
---
Ghostface, Michael, Demogorgon, and the Oni are the ones I’m looking at to potentially buy.
---
Confused on what the plan was there for the survivors but it seemed to work out well. xD
---
Surveillance is great on Freddy.
---
What about legion
---
This is peak clownery right here, folks.
---
Nothing is more satisfying as legion than using dark devotion and having a survivor run object
---
wow. was there literally ANY reason to say that? go in the dunce corner, shame on you.
---
Are you pressing space or directly crouchdetting?
---
a lot of people recently have been saying plague is too good.. it’s odd to see. she’s been pretty underrated for a while &amp; i don’t want to see her nerfed/killed by bhvr.
---
Spirit before her nerf: Hold my hair comb
---
Today I got hit by an oni who was across the map. Not nearby, not within terror radius, not even within los, literally across the map and I got hit
---
That's kind of a shame. To be honest I thought even without the fact it turns you into a survivor, it's a nice little stealth mechanic because no terror radius.
---
&gt;nightmare edition
---
no freddy  
---
ok boomer
---
I have a problem with that but idk how to fix it lmao. If I die it immediately cancels out any fun I might have previously had in that match. Even worse when I don't even pip.
---
This sub is full of over saturated content, this template also works for “guys I killed everyone so nicely but the survivors got made at me what did I do wrong guys” and “omg look I downed someone at the exit gates so funny right” and “omg [insert spirit or DS here] is so OP when are they gonna nerf”
---
the kill all survivor before exits gates is power challange has the same wording "kill by an means" and if they all DC it doest count it so one those two challenges is wrong then, both cant be right
---
even if its intended an challenge that can only be completed on the whim of a survivor choosing to dc or not is not fun to do
---
Talk shit get hit, love it
---
Because of your mori?
---
Be mindful about teachables; for each teachable you unlock, that means 3 perks you might not want in your bloodweb. The more teachables you have unlocked, the harder it will be to get the really good teachables.
---
shoutout to the gamers who downvoted you despite the obvious sarcasm and the /s
---
Laughs in swamp maps
---
Honestly lowkey I may be projecting some type of stress from finals on to you, have a good night as well dude.
---
Even without it i was still easily managing the entire lobby
---
What platform are you on?
---
you can see his “invisibility”. the only thing that makes him good at juggling is that you can’t chase with him because he sucks so much so you just juggle a lot. plus, running into survivors healing is by getting lucky. you doesn’t make him good. wraith sucks, just fucking accept it
---
The Undetectable changes really made things better for Wraith.
---
that goes both ways, I mean the meta perks for both survivors and killers all come from like 5+ different characters each. That goes for any game with progression like this as well, while it sucks coming in and starting new one shouldn't expect to have every perk available to them off the bat.
---
I don't think it's unfair to have to learn and progress before you start unlocking what you want, which btw unlocking all perks isn't THAT hard, especially if you utilize the shrine to get any level 40 perk that pops up. Yea we aren't all streamers who dedicated their job to this game who has every single perk unlocked on every single killer and survivor.
---
While killers take some time to learn, that's on you if you actually expect to learn 18 (and growing) different killers in a feasible amount of time when they all function drastically differently from one another. More commonly I see people just take a couple killers they like and pour all the points into them with at best just getting others to level 40 for the teachables they specifically want.
---
I'm not ignoring that aspect, I just think it's something you should expect in a PvP game with progression, I've had to go through the grind before and never saw it as an excuse to why it's hard to be on equal footing.
---
It grinds my gears when the killer somehow hits me through the window, after I went through the FULL vault animation. And it's not always ping either. This happened to me in a game with less than 90 ping
---
its a meme. unbreakable is far better
---
Just do it...accidentally...for the third time this match...
---
What the hell was that Claudette doing
---
I don't give a crap about pipping. I'm not a Blendette or an altruism farmer. I'm either wasting the killer's time by looping or powering through ruin on gens. In solo queue I know everyone's thirsty for saves so I don't go for them unless I need to.
---
I got pretty lucky and got F13th on PS4 for free when it was a ps plus October special. Both pc and console has proximity chat. Made for some fun moments for sure. Overall F13th wasn’t the best game but with friends it certainly makes for a hilarious and fun time.
---
The nurse is all about reading their tells and anticipating their teleports, that can be semi-reliably and reliable counters could be formed, this is more akin to a killer with issues such as Spirit, with an ability that has little to no counterplay with the exception of bringing in an item/ perk to specifically be a counter just in case you're paired up in a game against them, which is an unreasonable expectation. 
---
You can't really do much when a highly mobile, no consequence except for whiffing, 1-hit charge comes your way simply because one person was injured at some point,  who can track everyone without the need for perks/addons with glowing floating orbs that spawn at the same rate as bloodstains, that don't disappear when bloodstains do.
---
not to mention how much people ignore that that the penalty for ending and going back into the charge is almost nothing,  looping is only useful until they close the gap,  then they have to only hold m2 for the one second delay to 1 hit, about the same amount of time it takes to lunge with m1 anyway, with a longer reach attack. 
---
it basically just means when one person gets injured, just consider every single person to essentially be exposed from now on because why wouldn't they use m2 if it takes the same amount of time as m1, for a 1 hit?
---
No one seems to address this.
---
You didn't have to DC but OK.
---
Ps4
---
Meg ? Yui?
---
Removes any sense of integrity the match had. I’d like to earn my points through the standard course of gameplay, my opponents conceding defeat and accepting death fall within the parameters of standard gameplay, farming does not
---
Why ya gotta look at me with them big eyes :-\*&gt;
---
YOU’LL NEED THESE
---
Fuck I'm Xbox ;-;
---
No get out while you still can
---
And kill my friend? No thanks. Not gonna let a killer win through a bad game mechanic
---
Could you elaborate? Why dead hard is better for looping And with SB I can't run to new areas?
---
oh damn.. its been like 4yrs since i played LoL xD
---
Belsnickel is the new killer, and his power is impish or admirable:
---
-based off your performance in the match, Belsnickel’s power charges
---
-doings things that hurt you or your teammates (not doing gens is included Claudette) charge his meter
---
-helping your teammates lowers his meter
---
-once fully charged Belsnickel goes into Impish Rage, which lasts the rest of the trial, 
---
-Belsnickel now recovers from successful attacks 100% faster, recovers from missed attacks 50% faster, and has a 5% increase in movement speed.
---
-Dwight, DWIGHT
---
     -Jim Halpert
---
I hope they don't start banning DCs.... I use it to lower my rank
---
Get Claudette next!
---
Tapp. Tapp is beautiful.
---
So you'd rather just get rid of all the points you accumulated just to be a good buddy? Alright.
---
yeh makes sense. lets just hope BHVR might come up with something for new years xD wishful thinking right.
---
*sees PGTW*
---
Finally, enslaved regression
---
:( i mean if a lot of ppl are asking for it, you'd think they'd give in? I mean the game is for the players and if players want something thats reasonable, why not ya know
---
I’m terrified when people start running him with tinkerers
---
How is that a bad game mechanic... Swf is already pretty hard to go against sometimes and you want to make it even harder?? I'm a survivor main btw.
---
Ugh WHY?! 😭😂
---
Cross map downs by Huntress beat all of these
---
At least Myers you have a chance of escaping or being elsewhere. With Oni.. he'll find you, and once he does, you're going down.
---
That said, he's still slow enough early game to make it interesting. Really pushes the late match to more of a climax than other matches, for example against the Trapper..
---
It's so the killer can make the choice, leave you to crawl and possibly heal and chase your friend or kill you and have the hatch open up. It's a balanced mechanic and becomes unbalanced when a survivor finds it but his buddy docs so he can get an easy escape.
---
tHoSe LaSt FoReVeR!
---
I’m a 3, congratulations.
---
Oh it’s already a thing on pc
---
Why do games ever go on sale? If you lower the price, you get more sales. Often, as well, you get sales from people who would've never bought it. I'm saying that if they shifted their prices down a bit overall, sales would increase and they would get more people buying cosmetics. There has to be a sweet spot, though, that makes it worthwhile on their and our end. They would just need to find it. I can say, though, that pricing a skin more than the DLC, is NOT the sweet spot.
---
*cursor drifts slowly toward Franklins*
---
The Entity likes them plump
---
I've only been in red ranks for a few months, but I've been there for a few weeks this cycle, and have had a good number of games in the last couple weeks as I grind through the Archives. I play solo about 95% of the time.
---
I actually feel like there's way less camping than other ranks. Since I hit reds this time, I can only think of two games where the killer camped. One was a hard camping Oni, and the other was a proxy camping Ghostface.
---
The purple ranks usually aren't bad for camping either, but it's definitely more frequent than once a week.
---
Hopefully you're just having a string of bad luck. I recall trying to get to red one time and ending up with killers who brought mories 7 out of 9 games. That may have eaten away at my soul a little bit. Stuff like that happens, but then you get a string of games that'll go your way too.
---
I used to feel like red ranks were a sweat fest when I first made it there, but it doesn't feel as bad any more. I suspect that what we see in reds will change again since rank reset won't put people back so far, and we'll see more people who normally only make it to purple making it a bit higher.
---
Meg
---
Hope does so I would imagine breakout does too
---
That's hilarious. That actually makes the scene so hard to take seriously.
---
You also have to consider that this is the same guy who got 32 wins (no escape gate exits) with speed limiter leatherface.
---
Stalky boi OwO
---
I also find it saves precious time in early patrols, as I don't have to get in earshot to check a gen.
---
Might switch it out for pop goed the weesil when I unlock it doe
---
Found the Survivor main ^
---
On a side not I’m doing the escape 5 trials challenge and a killer dcing didn’t give me a tick in that challenge.
---
I mean all killers, Killer game mechanics. Something to reward you with 2ks as a win and something to help the other 2 survs out. Comeback mechanic if you will and not Noed or Adrenaline
---
It’ll be there once they implement dedicated servers
---
Hahahahahahahahahaha. Man I spent the last few weeks spending all the BP I can, playing when I can, I bought the Clown and hate his gameplay never played him once just spent enough BP to get his lvl 40 learnable perk. Pop Goes. The fucking Weasel. I hate everything.
---
Honest opinion?

This is veeeeery low quality content and I do not enjoy it

Windows of Opportunity is extremely useful for a beginner actually, I would put Kate in at least top 5 because of that. Just get David, Claudette, and/or Meg next and you're good. A lot of people recommend self care first but honestly if you are absolutely blind when it comes to map layout and knowing where pallets and loops are and how they work, Windows of Opportunity is a great place to start and I would actually recommend getting that before self care. You might actually want David's perk for increased bloodpoints first, and you should learn how to use dead hard anyways.
---
Dude, stop being such an asshole.
---
I will be quiting. I don't DC often but getting a ban for it will ruin this game. I already hate playing killer because of toxic trash
---
Sadly the game is heavily survivor sided, survivors control the pace of the game, ruin is mandatory for most players.
---
I don't think I get the reason for rank reset. Ranks are always going up and down doesn't it do more harm than good to reset them. You put a bunch of higher ranks lower, which means some ranks will get a higher killer at a lower rank and some lower killers will deal with survivors that are usually at a higher rank.
---
Cancelable and resumable, highly mobile, allowing lateral movement, uninterrupted by walls 1-hit charge attack. 
---
Can be used as a 1-hit attack with the same windup time as a normal lunge and the same range without addons and can track people with essentially bloodstains+ that float, glow, and don't dissipate when bloodstains do.
---
Billy is powerful yet balanced,  Oni is Billy + more mobility options with less drawbacks a faster windup 1-hit attack and increased tracking all before perks and addons which just make them even better the only drawback is needing to injure at least one survivor for half their power and to generate orbs. Wow.  It's not like it's extremely common for at least one survivor to get injured once per trial or anything. 
---
"Balanced"
---
I don't think anybody actually hates Bubba, they just hate Bubba players because it's a meme that they're face campers
---
I just bought the clown about three weeks ago, spent all the BP I’ve made over the last few weeks on him who’s gameplay I hate, so I’ve never played as him. Just spent the BP to get his lvl 40 learnable. Pop goes the weasel. F
---
I agree, while I understood the whole survivors OP shtick back when they had so many broken tools and killers were so slow in their actions (I still remember those clips of pre-buff Hag where she spent ages setting 1 trap).
---
I think a big contribution to Wraith and ghostface being more viable in general is the Undetectable buff, I wouldn't be surprised if you got somewhat similar results as Pig, her only problem being her RNG element.
---
I just think stealth killers in general are in a good spot, now we just have to focus on the killers where their only tools are anti-loop because that clearly isn't enough to make a killer viable, and surprise those are who all the low tier killers are IMO.
---
ya but immediately ending the chase with a down (which is what i did) nets no points because reasons
---
...sauce?
---
&gt;I have some friends that can't stand seeing and hearing the constant puking. It makes them sick IRL or something like that.
---
Yeah, I was like that too when she first came out.  It made me feel sick. Eventually I got acclimated to it, but there still might be some people that can't.
---
*bam bam bam
---
Spine chill gang rise up
---
Thank you kind stranger
---
Mood
---
Looks badass, ignore the trolls the pop up on every tattoo post.
---
I think people who posts the obvious to ridicule clearly new players is drinking the dumb fuck juice
---
Hell yeah.
---
And in the basement no less. Rip.
---
Just takes a little bit of characterisation of his sentence is all, sounds good like that
---
It's actually heart's content. 
---
I thought I'd let you know.
---
With the legion buff its more fun to rise up as a Legion main
---
That was so fucking satisfying
---
Nothing makes me more excited than killing a cocky survivor, even if it costs me the game
---
Pick 3-4 gens and focus your attention to that area of the map. Use pop to keep those gens down. Slowly the pallets in this area will become depleted and the area will become very dangerous 
---
Source: A trapper main who runs pop, save the best for last, BBQ, and agitation
---
If they're going to do that they need to implement a punishment for camping, tbagging,flashlight clicking,tunneling.
---
And you can't avoid pipping
---
I understand that. I am solo and I also usually keep the killer busy most the match. To have them dc after all my effort for no tic is like a kick in the hex 3rd seal
---
I haven’t played since...before legion, what just happened?
---
_FOR ONE MINUTE_
---
I feel like all the stalky bois and big have the advantage of being sneaky. They can wait for the right moment to strike. It would be hilarious if Pig put an RBT on a killer, forcing them to get it off.
---
There are really safe pallets, sort of safe pallets (mind game) and unsafe pallets really only used to evade an immediate hit. I break say all jungle gym pallets because they're really strong and should be broken as soon as possible to avoid the loop. Same for cow tree and killer shack (aka god pallets)
---
Can you please include the survivor rule book on how to play killer? I dont wanna be flamed for tunneling and camping ;-;
---
I wish they'd remove the aura read of that perk or at least nerf it
---
🤣
---
If I catch you wearing these I will beat you
---
Everyoje knows claudettes the monster  and neas the scapegoat
---
Mmm, I think it's fine personally but I respect your position
---
It’s not the killer’s fault the team is shit
---
Well let's rule out the most weakest first, Legion, Ghostface have no special ability so would die first, Clown is so fat one slash to his stomach and all his guts fall out, Bubba and billy with their chainsaws can do some damage but neither of them are invincible so they would die, Huntress would have an advantage of range and Trapper can stun with his traps if he manages it, Michael has the supernatural ability of not being able to fucking die but in the end Oni would win, Oni has the battle skills, Superstrength and anger to win, plus Him and spirit would prolly team up tbh
---
Ik, personally I want more perks that are the only good perk on a character, so you can just get the perk off the shrine and not spend money on an entire killer just for 1 perk
---
lol
---
after 1k hours reread your post
---
Because you’re dead before the game ends? ;)
---
I like Ruin, BBQ, Make Your Choice, and Enduring. 
---
I don't have too many perks on her, but that's what I work with. I'm in red ranks and don't play her much, but I've been successful with this build.
---
Oooohh
---
My right ear is dead
---
Demon Strike is a hard to land and hard to see ability that mostly requires luck to hit your target with the added lunge on any platform, which is a slim chance anyway. Demon Dash is hard to turn and the strafing is almost impossible to use unless you're a godtier keyboard rebinder. It's almost impossible to hit GOOD survivors around jungle gyms and CL loops if they hit hard corners, another one of the drawbacks with Oni. A single hit grants 40 of the needed 100 charges to get Blood Fury with a passive recharge of 0.2 charges per second. A single blood orb also grants 2 charges, with 2 spawning every 2 seconds or during an action. Roughly takes 1 minute 20 seconds more or less to get your ability where you then have to adapt to a new movement set immediately. The cooldown period also has its own drawbacks allowing the survivors to gain distance and position themselves at better loops. He's also really damn easy to hear from a distance like PTB Demogorgon footsteps, rendering stealth a good counter towards him.
---
Balanced: Yes.
---
Factssss  😂 That would be fucking sick to see dude.
---
Let people escape lol
---
He looks like a mosquito and I like it
---
Oni's ultra lunge is actually part of his weakness if you know how to juke it properly. Like, kanabo-wielding oni is surprisingly easy to 360s and run around a loop, kinda how you would run it to prevent a huntress from hatcheting you.
---
There are several simple counters to BBQ’s aura reading, it’s not strong enough to need a nerf
---
No because I played the game as it was designed and didn't even get a bronze given that all the chases except for 2 ended in less than 15 sec and the points do not reflect what I should have earned. It doesn't make sense that you can get at least gold in all but chaser seeing as you have to chase in order to  achieve at least 2 of the 3 other emblems. Also while i didn't know the specific point values the points should have at least been above 100 after looking at the charts.
---
It's the Spine Chill cat
---
Oversized hoodie always looks cute, ide date her, might get killed but I'm cool with that
---
I'd love it lmao
---
Takes too long!
---
I know bhvr is retarded but the community?
---
Kate's my second favourite survivor, behind Jeff (and Steve, they are both numbah 1 for me)
---
I’ve already got a couple thousand hours in, ive been playing nearly since console launch. The time I’ve put in doesn’t make me care about the integrity of a match any less
---
i wanna know what the hell iridescent means in the context of this game because that button does NOT look like a glass-like substance as the iridescent head's desc. would imply
---
Might as well go the whole nine yards. 
---
Have Michael Meowers do the Mori instead of Myers. Stabby Tabby!
---
Oh shit, nice
---
Spirit takes 'skill' lmao.
---
This doesn't change my point of rallying against buying overpriced items so that they decrease the price.
---
Yes, reading it, seeing it in post game chat, and having to put up with it is becoming a regular thing to the point of ridiculousness. I must be drinking the dumbfuck juice because people actually thinking this is becoming the norm.
---
Adrenaline, Dead Hard, or Unbreakable. DS only ever comes clutch in the endgame if you're trying to crawl out. Killers assume you have DS in red ranks so they'll just slug you or leave you. Unbreakable is a game changer if everyone has been slugged or is on a hook. Dead hard is good to extend chases. Dead Harding for distance surprisingly works well. And Adrenaline is Adrenaline. It makes it so you don't have to worry about healing late game. Just push through gens. I've stopped bringing a perk to heal and I've been doing just fine. If you're stealthy however, Iron Will is a great perk.
---
He’s 8 and I’m 13
---
There is 1. Locker and it's barely effective 90% of the time. Its aura reading is op and needs a nerf
---
The fuck?... bitch no
---
Oni with his bare hands no weapons(with ability)  could kill everyone
---
 Pig is small so he just crush her head,    Trapper is weaker then him and smaller meaning he can get the upper hand, Wraith is very very skinny so easy kill,  Hillbilly well has a chainsaw but he has to charge it meaning he could just rush Hillbilly and beat him to death,     Nurse is well fragile, Hag small and fragile,    Doctor just has his stick which probably wouldn't hurt the Oni that much and his shock therapy but the Oni is very fast so doc wouldn't get the chance,  Myers would actually be very easy to take down imo sure he has a knife and he may look opposing but considering the Oni and his backstory Micheal would be just very easy,    Huntress eh range might be a problem but he's pretty fast(dude runs as fast as Hillbilly)  leatherface easy slow and stupid, Freddy is easy since if he toys with the Oni he just pissed him off more.   Clown, he's fat and his knife is small, spirit small,legion small,   Plague fragile,   Ghostface small and fragile, the demogorgon may have thick skin but I could see the Oni shoving his hand down the demogorgons throat and maybe rip It in two or just keep wailing on it.
---
You... keep missing the point. 
---
I hate to word things this way, I really do, but I think it's the only way you might read and comprehend. 
---
There will be a PENALTY to DC'ing. NOT POINTS. IF YOUR DC, then you will NOT BE ABLE to JOIN A NEW MATCH for an undetermined PERIOD OF TIME. 
---
That means... if you DC, you'll be left out of joining a new game LONGER than if you were to just let yourself DIE ON HOOK. 
---
IF YOU READ THE PATCH NOTES, YOU WOULD KNOW THAT.
---
Is that in ANY WAY unclear to you?
---
Ohhhh makes sense. I figured if it was something bigger with consoles, I would have heard way more about it. Thank you!
---
How do you choose items faster in the bloodweb? I’ve seen Noob3 do it in his streams and it seems like he’s just clicking on the item once rather than holding down his mouse button
---
Stoooop gen rushing I coulda dropped my croissant !
---
Neither of us really care that much about rank so it’s up to you
---
How did you not go down? I’m so confused
---
This just sounds like loser talk to me. Another reminder why I hate this community sometimes.
---
Wraith is one of my favs and that design is so slick. Awesome job!
---
You must be the only one, but guess what? When you get 3 matches in a row with 3 moris in a row you get a little tired, even more if you're on solo. Those assholes survivors
---
Decisive Strike or Sprint burst. Ds helps if you get Farmed by a teammate or unhooked Next to a Camping Killer. SB is the best exhaustion perk (for me) cause you can Escape the Killer when he comes back After u got unhooked. 
---
Dead hard is Not bad but once the Killer knows u have it its basicly useless.
---
This whole thread of replies is my reminder
---
Same! I always queue solo and I got into a few matches with rank disparity but I had one today with all rank 4-5 survivors and a rank 18 Bubba. It’s insane. We apologized (we were all healthy and bodyblocked a hit as a meg ran to the gate to save her) and offered encouragement but man, that’s awful, makes you feel awful as killer i assume because you couldn’t get a single kill and makes you feel awful as survivor because you played like you would against a red/purple rank against a baby
---
This is a visual bug that happens every now and again
---
Uh I think my all 30 or so matches  disagrees with your statement also hey don't generalize all reddit killer mains as most of us are way nicer and stuff compared to the other parts of community
---
Some people don't know about Borrowed Time's effect, and it isn't obvious that they're immune to the next hit. I'd guess that a lot of players aren't familiar with how it works, and the game doesn't do much to teach them ( a small symbol with no text does very little in this respect). Assuming that people are just selfish isn't fair - it's just out of ignorance that they misplay like this. But that's just my assumption.
---
2 people stand
---
Yawn
---
By DCing to let him ignore the actual mechanics. The killer is allowed to not kill a survivor to go look for the others to prevent just this but you didnt like that so disconnected and complained. Yea he found it, the killer also knew it was closed, and you would have had to bleed out if he didnt hook you, so he knew he had a chance to look for the last guy. 
---
This is why on PC there are DC penalties that need to go to console.

Survivors were like killers and had different abilities, I didn’t really get how perks worked so when I’d play meg I’d go fast all of a sudden but when I’d play Claudette I could heal myself. Also with exhaustion I thought you’d run slower and I also thought injured survivors were slower.
---
i have done this in gmod before and holy SHIT it needs to be added
---
Talk about being needy for attention... Blocking cuz these posts are cringe.
---
I like the idea tbh
---
Laughable that you vouch for 4 minutes of forced inactivity
---
Perfect fucking response dude. DBD needs to make this happen so we can see The Oni massacre all killers. 😂
---
I think that has to do with the reach add-ons.
---
Think you forgot this /s
---
k asshole
---
They’re an immersed P3 Claudette, they’re always salty
---
Maybe a sign to GTFO the game then if you're gonna be sucking on lemons and getting sour all day.
---
I never said to halt cosmetics, and I understand that the art department and the design team are seperate, that's why I said that the design team should look into an Op Health type patch, not the art team lmao
---
Also yeah, there was little to no content during Operation Health but the things that got fixed did get fixed and systems were put in place that help the game sugnificantly now, such as disabling operators much more easily and faster, like with Clash when she got locked due to a bug where she could shoot through her shield. It wasnt meant to fix all the games glitches and bugs right then and there. It did however fix a significant sum of them and made it easier to fix new ones that cropped up later on. Whether it was effective or not tho, doesnt matter. Dbd needs a chapter dedicated to bug fixes and balance issues.
---
So you're suggesting it would be more fair if the killer hit you on their screen but you still don't get hit? In a 1v4?
---
Ooooooooo. I can see this happening.
---
You are just needy for attention for god knows what reason while using a very serious subject.
---
Holy shit this meme is coming back
---
Okay so you use dead hard to gain space to vault a window sooner or to get to a pallet sooner to throw. Sprint burst is activated whenever you sprint so lots of people walk to avoid using it unless the killers starts to chase you then you run
---
Aw jee wilkers I did forget the /s hol up a momemnt
---
I did not know this was a regular thing
---
I dodge on purpose to send the survivors back to cue. Satisfying knowing they have to wait even longer when they're being little shits.
---
Boy you gott purrty mouth. How many fingers is it for a suck off?
---
if you hear her phasing noise, she's comin for you  
---
I've honestly never understood why people hate going against her so much, I think there's much more difficult killers out there
---
Okay! The only reason I bring it up is cause the rank system can be terrible sometimes
---
A lot of perks need better activation methods. It's really annoying having to walk like I'm immersed just to save my exhaustion perk when the devs could simply make it, "double tap the run button to activate".
---
Premonition is another one where it will go off in a chase as if I wasn't aware of that already. They could make it only activate out of chases.
---
There was an object between them, it still shouldn't have hit.
---
It's his new stand
---
I feel rewards qould be crest, not rank entirley, so a rank 1 gets the same amount to rank 4, but more then rank 5-8
---
Don't play the game if it tilts you so much. Is it worth getting so worked up?
---
“Nope” 😂 What if Oni tracks her with the Renjiro’s Bloody Glove. It’s wraps. 😂 Oni has it all.
---
Okay well I’m defiantly going to do yui now lol
---
The only time I struggle to (usually double) pip as Mikey without Ruin is in the red ranks.
---
It’s ironic bc these are the ranks where the players should be able to play around ruin and render it a useless perk, but it slows the game down just enough to matter. Except when it gets a really shitty spawn and there’s just nothing you can do about it.
---
Ruin certainly isn’t necessary until you simply get to the “meta”-tier.
---
Game hasn’t even started and you know they’re little shits?
---
&amp; Knuckles
---
That’s super true. I’ve noticed that if I host then we get killers closer to my rank so that helps with that, at least for me lol
---
They’d better be. I’d be pissed if I did all that for nothin!
---
If it's the same survivors, yes
---
Not what i said, i dont mind going down but downs like this feel cheap and ruin the experience for me and many others. 
---
Its not just survivor either, many times as killer i will get hits and just laugh at how ridiculous it was that that connected.
---
Fuck pointing Spider-Man! Get over there and start teababgging your soon to be dead SWF!!! 
---
Then point and laugh! 
---
Now if we could only get a Spider-Man cosmetic and get some ingame footage of this!
---
I’ve noticed that if I host we get lower rank killers so that helps, at least for me lol
---
Another experience I had leading to the rage quit.  Went against a tunneling and proxy camping trapper. When I was hooked and trapper actually left for once Bill just pointed at me and left me to die on the hook. After he met up with the only other survivor who almost went to save me but Bill waved to come back and they both worked on a gen until death. Was so pissed, I was so happy when Trapper had No Ed and killed them both
---
Suffering from the succ
---
Just don’t get hooked /s
---
i have no one
---
So what’s your Instagram?
---
Congratulations. You got the rarest type of multi-down for Oni, and will probably never get it again.
---
Oh wait. You're on PC. Never mind.
---
Had the same thing happen to a friend of mine and I started laughing and just told him that everything would be okay and he was going to heaven...
---
I did I know. I know. I don’t have a life.
---
Just look at his post history and comments. Just a kid looking for attention while using a very serious subject.
---
No such thing as a bad croissant!
---
Someone else could've been playing on their account, I know I've had cousins come over who don't know how to play while I'm at high rank.
---
Is it that hard to understand that killers can be dicks too or what?
---
That's because that's the oblivious status which just removes terror radius
---
How?
---
That pretty much sums up DBD, the game where you can’t guarantee a fun and happy time.
---
There’s always help. You just have to go find it. Look online for specialized therapists or psychiatrists. But definitely stop playing this game if it upsets you this much
---
Find someone, this is the place for people who play the game dead by daylight, you can call a phone number, search up some suicide hotlines they'll get you to be better
---
Iridescent seems to be the highest quality of stone in The Entity's world 
---
i'm only assuming though, take with a grain of salt
---
the hair just needs to change as a whole, looking like the hair was ripped off of a doll and placed on someones head
---
I did the same thing with a jane some days ago, she was trying to get my attention by vaulting a window. Unlucky her and lucky me, i was able to hit that kanabo up her thicc ass and she died.
---
But honestly, if everyone is healthy or everyone is already dead or escaped, just fucking leave. I even stopped going to the exit gates just so people waste time waiting for me
---
You're talking about a disagreement that was dropped a bit ago, so kindly screw off.
---
Ah yes. The OG Shape who was brought back for the 2018 reboot...and cast in only one scene before being replaced.
---
Both key's and mori's end the game early the only difference is the killer has to catch you for a mori. Keys are 100% luck based
---
*clapping gif*
---
Would I potentially be losing points towards my Benevolence emblem if I did **not** commit hook-suicide?
---
Say I'm hooked and the two other survivors are slugged. If the killer's going to hook them both, and they're both on their second hooks, wouldn't I be losing points for "hooked survivors"? Whereas if I commit suicide while they're still slugged and get my stats immediately, those points would not be lost.
---
Your forgot the ON PC part in the title. On Xbox he’s terrible because nobody can effectively maneuver with joysticks
---
Depends i guess.
---
While oni is strong,he's still just a dude as far as i can tell. Albeit,an entity empowered rage monster, but still just a human regardless.
---
Where you have killers like myers and freddy who are a whole 'nother level.
---
Freddy is literally a dream demon. When someone is pulled into his dream world, they are effed. He's basically a god there.
---
Myers is the immortal embodiment of pure evil (assuming the old lore and not the bullshit 2018 remake). 
---
If you are talking just the versions we have in game, i'd prob have to go with billy or maybe cuntress. 
---
Cuntress may have the range advantage, but billy can just nascar around the map one shotting everyone. 
---
Killers like myers or oni would just take to long to activate their 1 hit ko abilities before billy just ran them down with his chainsaw.
---
The thing is I play on mobile so it’s mostly guests.
---
I relate to this too much...
---
* insert Tootsie Pop reference here*
---
Most people who are suicidal don’t say their suicidal their actions do. So you might be depressed which in that case I highly recommend a therapist or calling a suicide hotline. I really hope you get help. And plz for the love of god don’t do anything you can’t take back.
---
He's trolling.  I'd ignore.
---
the hatch in general is a bad game mechanic. If there is one survivor alive and the gates aren't open there should just be a time limit on if the survivor can outlast the killer. If they can then they escape if not its a 4k
---
yeh, just something to give those that do persist and show their dedication. I know red ranks can be difficult/toxic so getting something to show my efforts wouldn't be the worst idea /shrug
---
No, they're talking about how the hillbilly stands hunched over but when you go into a lobby he uses trappers animation so he stands upright like a normal person.
---
It could be a number of things but the most likely is, when you are in tier 3, if you hold the attack button (M1/Right Trigger) you actually do a lunge. You have to be in a pretty close distance, and just tap the button when it prompts KILL at the bottom of the screen. If it doesn't prompt, you will only do a lunge.   
---
You must be in Tier 3 of Evil Within to kill btw.
---
go post in r/suicidewatch or something, not here
---
Okay, I see where you’re going. There’s a lot that can happen man. 😂
---
He speeds up his footage to make it more montage-y, for him it is still the same speed.
---
I might be stupid but idk what to do with those numbers
---
Fuck off I'm fucking tired of people denying how I fucking feel you don't give a fuck about me I'm starting to think the only fucking way I can prove myself is by showing people my fucking corpse I'm so fucking done with this shit
---
Festively Plump Too!
---
Dude, maybe he wants attention because he needs someone to talk to and has nobody.
---
Jason won't be in this game because of the same reason the people who made the friday the 13th game had to stop working on it. The people with the rights to Jason don't really want him in a videogame or something like that
---
Bruce Campbell or Chris?
---
I once have did the same, The survivor explained that I was camping when the doods were open and so I couldn't take it anymore, Tbh I regret everything I said, But if you need to take a break then take a break, If the game starts to become unfun and you feel you're playing not to have fun but to win then you must stop playing, get a drink, relax, then play when you feel good.

You dont actually lol
---
you can't tell
---
The reaches in reasoning are entertaining, again it's okay, don't need to justify playing an easymode killer, but making them out to need more skill than they do doesn't help the image when it's verifiably false.
---
have a good one, o7
---
You can't tell. All hex totems look the same, so cleansing and defending the right one is a gamble.
---
I appreciate your paragraph a lot.  I guess I'm reaching out here because I still don't know what the fuck to do.  I've tried therapy and medication and it didn't work and everyone keeps telling me "more therapy" but i dont know, its fucking hard to trust something that did nothing to help you before.
---
However tons of assholes on here seem to take it as an attention grab so fuck them all.  They can fuck right off.  I appreciate you for trusting me
---
1. You're not making any sense. 2. I just explained how I understand and that I understand far better than you realize. 3. It's not impossible to get help. As someone who's done it personally after thinking that there wasn't anyone who could help me and being someone who hates asking for help and appearing weak to people.
---
Your honestly right I don’t care about you. Because I don’t know you but I have seen this before and have lived through it before and I don’t want anyone else to go through the pain of losing a brother,sister,daughter,son or a friend.
---
So plz get on a phone and call the suicide hotline.
---
What system does Big Dick Bill play on?
---
Monstrous shrine.
---
I care, because this shit is not related to DBD and people already pointed him the right directions while also offering their ears if needed. He didn't do any of that and came back with another thread "hey, look at me".
---
Hi Dwight
---
for the most part i love them as a killer. it feels like i have to actually have to track people with my mouse to hit them instead of just locking straight on. it only bothers me when i do a window grab, go through the whole animation and they aren't actually grabbed.
---
Dude don’t please. There’s always another way. Contact a therapist, it will actually help. If it was advised to you before in previous post Idk why you haven’t tried it but you need it seriously
---
It’s billy because of movement and Myers because of the way it charges but I guess you could add bubba in for the attack
---
Don’t try! Fucking do it
---
It needs a nerf stool defending it. We all know you don't want it nerfed fkf the points the points is fine it's the aura reading that needs nerfed
---
*slide whistle*
---
Not really. They'll be 99ing hooks, and since Sabouteur adds 30 seconds to saboutage, for some dumb reason Hangman's doesn't get prioritised over that so you still have to put them down and slug them for too long to win.
---
ok
---
Right now I'm counting this as my exit. Time to leave and start exploring other games. I don't have an intention on returning, though I'll admit it is possible.
---
Idk, I tried looking at his history but he might of hid some posts.
---
I was not 100% sure how original this would be LOL 
---
I was hoping it was somewhat of a unique look. Maybe slightly out of the box.
---
I actually just bought the Santa body with aurorax cells just so I can run this around during the holidays while I was trying to complete the achievement since I don't play clown much
---
Your entire comment is saying nuh uh but dragged across several sentences. 
---
Your comment makes no sense since you aren't suggesting the art team stops making content, you aren't suggesting they stop balancing, but somehow are still trying to say they should dedicate a chunk of time to polishing the game. 
---
What the hell do you think they are doing every patch? They are still releasing a number of bug fixes. They just got done overhauling the games engine over the summer to improve framerates and make audio issues less ridiculous. 
---
They just got done overhauling the games netcode to accommodate dedicated servers.
---
You must not have been playing this game very long because it's been reliably improving every patch in a number of ways. In 2017 I remember the balance being an *actual* hellscape, I remember audio issues out the ass every patch, some of them flat out making playing killers in general almost impossible since you couldn't hear gens/survivors through walls. 
---
The issues people complain about now pale in comparison to what used to be the big issues.
---
Meanwhile it takes me 4 games
---
Yah the lobby dogging by these pussy killers on PS4 has gotten ridiculous! They have been doing it allot for the last 2 weeks from rank 8 up to rank 2 killers.
---
I wish BhVR would give a penalty for lobby dogging if the lobby is full. Everyone loads in after waiting 10-15mins and readies up just so the killer can DC from the lobby like a scarred little child! 
---
STOP BEING SCARED LITTLE BITCHES!!
---
needs to move like nea’s harujuku hair tbh
---
true story?
---
you could make this cost $30 and I would still buy it

I’m here to make dank memes
---
I can't tell if I wish they went more Krampus with this or if it's creepy enough being a distorted Santa LOL
---
DBD gonewild?
---
alright, thanks bro
---
yes, 7 games ago
---
Works for me! Wish they would buff clown just a little though, but BhVR doesn’t know how to do that...
---
That's oni
---
Hex ones will be marked for you as the killer in red like generators. Otherwise you have no idea how to differentiate.
---
i'll see ya there, homeslice. ;)
---
Yes there is...
---
People tend to forget that the artist needs to make the basic outlines first.... I’m sure it’ll look rad when it’s completed :)
---
Jane main?
---
I can’t really help or offer other suggestions without knowing your specific problems. I can assure you that there are better solutions to your problems than Suicide. Sometimes it will make you feel better to talk, I suggest finding a Suicide prevention sub Reddit.
---
bruh, oml
---
I did?
---
Copy-paste it into Word if it's hard to read. I know Reddit formatting can be a bitch sometimes.
---
Exactly. Which is why it should be a default survivor ability. Change my mind
---
Pretty sure d/c during animation does not count, it will mark as disconnect kill instead of your tombstone kill unless they patched that, because I remember my last 4th survivor D/C during tombstone killing, and it don't pop up for me, that was like last year.
---
yeah than why are you being such an insensitive asshole?  fuck you.  you're stupid as hell and i have no respect for you
---
This is what we killer mains see as balanced thank you.
---
Plague is a literal spray and prey, so she won't be hard to aim. Console Oni has a lot of fps drops and is hard to control.
---
You dont have to say "very quick " or "rushed " as a protective measure in case others dislike your video, so that you have an excuse to fall back on.
---
Good video btw
---
BECAUSE IVE FUCKING TRIED IT AND IT DID NOTHING FOR ME FUCK YOU ALL I FUCKING HATE YOU ALL YOU FUCKING TALK TO ME LIKE IM BRAINDEAD JUST FUCK RIGHT OFF YOURE SUCH A PIECE OF SHIT I HATE YOU
---
For the grabs, Run STBFL and get to high ranks
---
Lots of survivors play dirty and wait for a hit to complete the gen, especially if you have PGTW. Some don't expect STBFL and you'll be able to grab them off of it. Literally the only way I could do it.
---
im not going to fake shit.  i dont know if i want to be better
---
"Escape the trial with calm spirit 1 without alerting crows"
---
So I imagine it's just as easy to wiggle your analog stick to hit survivors?
---
thats not a bad idea
---
nurse and huntress have been free from the get-go
---
you have to “buy” the huntress dlc, and the nurse dlc is part of the base game
---
Oh no I'm saying it's rushed because I had to make it before my next class started. Thanks for the comment as well btw!
---
Absolutely not. You think the quality of games is bad right now? Prepare to never have a good match without ranked
---
Oni, as plague is kinda of a very weak killer on anything, but thats my choice, do what you want.
---
If you made Claudette that would be awesome. These look amazing btw
---
You think that's bad?! Tonight I had a match where I used Kindred and the other three players were all right by me, bearing in mind they would be able to see each other's auras as well, and not one of them bothered to unhook me until I entered the second phase and even then I waited a while. I nearly died on my first hook with three healthy teammates very close while Kindred was active. One teammate cleansed the dull totem right by me as I entered the struggle phase and refused to heal me until he'd found another dull totem. These were red and purple rank players, not babies. Also, about that Dwight you're talking about. Self-caring when up against a Nurse is even worse when you consider they'll likely use Nurse's Calling.
---
What if a killer legitimately goes right back to you and only you after being unhooked? The worst case I gotten was a Spirit that literally stopped what she doing and kept on phasing right to me being unhooked, resulting in only getting 1K points and a pip loss. Yes, tunneling exists, but people should stop farming people after 3 seconds, do some generators first &gt;:(
---
love the flair.
---
Lmao having a rough day buddy?
---
I wonder how deep Steve's sword would go in my ass
---
I bet u play Jane
---
No. Taking up a perk slot it's weak. Having it as a default ability is too strong. Most perks are like that, they'd be too strong as base kit
---
Is Fire Up worth taking?
---
What about the aura reading is even OP? The same could be said about Kindred because it gives survivors a long warning for of the killer’s camping/coming to them so they can get in position. BBQ is like Ruin. It’s a great perk but not really OP. It gives killers an immediate sense of direction upon hooking, and scores some extra points to promote not tunneling. It’s nice against immersed survivors in weird areas of the map, but stealth is a poor way for survivors to engage in DbD gameplay, as utilizing mobility and resources along with creating distance is their main gameplay methodology. There’s a reason why everyone ever (even survivor players) make fun of very stealthy players. They tend to be very poor in actual chasing scenarios, and aren’t playing to the objective. The other use that BBQ has is informing one that survivors are near the hook in which case- they can’t see your aura. They only know how many survivors are nearby. The alternative to this is... the perk not giving information? In that case you’re running a perk slot that gives you absolutely no benefit. Just because a perk pops up frequently that doesn’t mean it’s OP. Trapper has an insanely high play rate and Freddy has an insanely high kill rate, but when players look at things in context, they realize that factors like killer availability and new survivors skew the statistics. In this case, BBQ may be a perk that many killers run and can make good use of (Hillbilly, Spirit, Nurse, etc) but it does nothing to Hinder a survivor’s ability to fake out a killer with their aura, use a locker, or continue with what they’re doing and prepare a chase route within the next few seconds. If you really do think that it’s OP then I’d like to hear your thoughts though. It’s a bit counterproductive to tell people to “stop defending something” instead of giving a proper explanation.
---
Sometimes you have to try different medications...I guess. I'm in that boat myself. I've weened myself off of meds I don't feel are working for me and I'm afraid to try other ones because I feel like those won't work either. I stopped talking to my therapist because I didn't feel like I was getting anywhere, I just felt weird talking to her. It just didn't help. I don't know dude. I wish good thoughts to you. Good luck.
---
With sloppy butcher, no less
---
Imo that's the survivors fault for farming you which is toxic and stupid but the killer was just doing their best
---
They should make David times more realistic like "Dead hard into a tree and go down seconds later"
---
actually yes! If ppl stop playing they deserve to slowly deplete their rank. I know in OW in diamond onwards you get that, if you dont play, you lose X amount per day or something. so to maintain your rank you gotta keep playing. i like this.
---
No like the perks associated with said hex, but apparently you cant tell the difference
---
PC
---
I swear you're all just dumb
---
Honestly yeah. Moris and keys are such a weird design choice to me. Why design an item that basically just says "end the game". It never feels good to play against and it's not really a victory to use.
---
Kinda, they are only changing where you get placed after reset. Eg you only drop one colour rank now. So red to purple. Green to yellow etc. instead of everyone dropping to green and lower. Which is better since red/purple mix were going to greens and greens were pairing up with yellow ranks and it became VERY unbalanced for the first week. This is a good change already, but nothing major.
---
If I'm going to be honest I'm pretty good at playing against the Oni
---
You know it XD. I’m not usually this salty, but good god I hate DBD sometimes.
---
Okay but can you say what about it you think is overpowered instead of just insulting people?
---
Twice
---
-must complete in one trial
---
Swap sc for bond
---
I feel ya
---
I agree with you, getting Mori'ed by a doctor feels like your LSD trip just took a dark.
---
Ohhh!  The Entity nabbed her right before she crossed the exit.  It was basically as close as it could have possibly been when she ran out of time.  Another millisecond and she would have made it.
---
Used it on a swf team the other night, there was a random in the team, he was the only one that got the traditional sacrifice.
---
I did. If you could read or stopped defending it after reading, I wouldn't need to insult you.
---
Fuck Legion
---
Ok so I’m being annoying now but what causes that? I don’t remember a time limit on the game at all
---
0/10 we need a Walgiu killer along with a clown cosmetic that is Mario (imagine Mario stomping on your head then cutting your finger off)
---
Considering it’s starting to take what feels like forever to find a game, you want to at least enjoy it for a few mins before the wait begins again.
---
Which doesn't mean the perk isn't broken as hell against Freddy. It desperately needs fixing in regards to him.
---
Lol get out of the white ranks before you shitpost
---
Completely fair enough and I agree about the quality on rb stickers. link to the etsy store?
---
Do as you wish!, there are other horror games that are unique coming out, like the resident evil one!, Have fun out there
---
Nothing wrong about running NOED. Not sure why did you bring up this in your argument.
---
I'm such an idiot, I was trying to get 2k shards to buy Decisive but I fucking forgot what day it was today. God damn going to be months until its back.
---
Let's agree to disagree.
---
I quit sometime before EGC too, but came back with that and the new reworks they put out. I started playing somewhere early 2018, and to me the game is more balanced than ever, give it another chance! Theres a lot you missed: nurse rework, Freddy rework, legion and pig nerds, ds nerf, healing times changes, etc
---
What’s the purpose of outfits under customization? Can you create your own outfits?
---
Shut the fuck up cunt
---
It’s not even a hit-box anymore. He wasn’t even in the shack, this is incredible.
---
I try and play a couple killer matches as the friendly and non abusive killer that I wish I could play against. Usually ends up in a couple new friends or a me being called trash in a message. either way it's still fun😂
---
It's absolute bullshit. Just had a trapper mori me,  off my first hook. Literally had two people trying to body block him and he wouldn't touch them. Just kept coming for the tunnel.
---
And when you could tell the killer by the hooks
---
Lmao 18 days later. Reported
---
with 2 charge movement speed add-ons for maximal speed and minimal ability to turn
---
Oooh I missed the animation difference! Totally didn’t know that they were frenzying! Thank you :)
---
I use NOED on all my killers because not only does it make you faster but of course I want to get a one shot all the time. NOED is one of the best perks in the game. Plus with the Oni you have to get enough blood orbs to even get into that enraged state. I can understand why people get mad of killers using NOED with someone like Leatherface or the Hillbilly because you don't have to charge anything up over a long period of time. I use NOED on my Ghostface as well because it takes a while for his meter to go up.
---
I actually think that was a pretty neat mechanic
---
just shut the fuck up i dont want anything from your stupid ass
---
I'm glad bill lives on.
---
That's all we can do dude, keep having fun :)
---
right who the fuck uses noed on a killer who can expose them.. who uses noed generally that’s for bad players who can’t get kills without it LMFAOOO
---
I was hoping to get tanacity or dead hard this week 😄 so good
---
Hi baby Dwight nice to meet you😽
---
oh I enjoy responding to them. My close friend who I'll run a couple games with is someone I actually met playing as killer. Called me shit a couple times and said he wished I would burn to death. We are now very close friends and even know eachothers families
---
It has niches
---
I literally wasn’t saying that? It’s okay to use it sometimes??? Calm down
---
realize it's only a game? You can always just exit the game. As far as challenges join a discord and try and make friends, hell join twitch chats and find teammates.
---
you literally know nothing about me or what i've done to better myself, you just saw a post about suicide and decided to lecture me because you're still not over the pain you feel.  fuck right off, nothing you say means anything to me because you're stupid
---
you as well
---
Oh god yeah it’s awful. T-bagging in general I don’t agree with, I play killer mostly and I understand this shits hard.
---
But when a killer camps and someone finds hatch lowkey I think it’s justified
---
-*Locker sweats nervously*-
---
Have you ever been high or drunk?
---
False, Self care takes 32 seconds while regular takes 16. 
---
However regular takes up 2 people’s time while self care only takes up 1.
---
It doesn’t waste any extra time, In fact it would be better to self care and join the gen after because of the slowdown for multiple survs on 1 gen.
---
Dance with me is one of my favorite perks as well as WoO. Too bad boil over sucks.
---
Can’t wait the perk which allows us to beat the killer when playing as Steve with the bat
---
Bamboozle is also great anyways, so not totally wasted.
---
Idk because I've only been playing the game for a couple months.  But as long as I've been playing, there has  been a time limit once the gates are opened.
---
Its the most balanced iridescent addon imo, but I might be biased a bit lol
---
Iri head + Belt = Toxic
---
Getting help doesn't always mean therapy. Or medication. Or killing yourself cause some poeple say that's totally valid. It could be finding a friend. Or talking to a random police officer that stops you to ask why you're walking around at 2am in a bad neighborhood and asks if you just want to sit in the station for a bit to talk. It could be going on walks/jogs/working out at 5am becuase you like feeling like you're outrunning all your feelings. It could be drawing. Dancing. Writing even. Whatever else. But posting on a gaming forum and making the same posts over and over? That won't help.
---
Plague takes a bit of patience but I'd take her over Oni she's very fun.
---
Imagine he can only walk/trudge around, but he has next to no terror radius and he has a long-ass reach with his massive sword. And the sword can cut through walls and lockers, like in the original movie. He has deployable scarab-like swarms that he deploys that will seek out and follow survivors and alert him of their location. 
---
Perks:
---
Impossible Fog
---
The in-game fog is treated as 1/2/3 ranks less for the killer. Additionally the in-game fog is treated as 1/2/3 ranks higher for survivors.
---
Frozen with Fear
---
Survivors within the killer’s terror radius suffer exhaustion until they leave/1 second after they leave/2 seconds after they leave. 
---
Might of the Night
---
The killer can temporarily break vault locations. They are automatically repaired after 2/3/4 minutes. 
---
His mori can be raising his victims and ripping their skin off like he did with that woman outside the church.
---
Yeah bro like I see how it's probably really fucking annoying to see that I'm still posting about it, but the idea that "if you wanted help you'd be better already" or that I'm doing it to get my fix of attention is just stupid.  I met a really cool dude on here last time who understood me and helped me have a productive week at school.  And tonight, I met you :)  a chill dude who understands me and sees the good in me, and it helps me know that if I work hard I can restore my character.  
---
I don't regret a thing because of you :) so thanks man.  You've helped my night a ton
---
Looks like gens are back on the menu boys
---
I'm watching you Dwight
---
I wouldn’t even worry about ranking up it’s not like the game gets more fun when you get to higher ranks
---
No, not even. It's the only way to run Iri heads
---
Oh I totally know why people use it- and yeah it makes sense!  **Sometimes**. Best perk in the game? I will have to respectfully disagree. With inner strength and rank 1s who’ve been playing forever, NOED is non existent. At least in my games, wouldn’t you want a perk that can always be used during the match consistently?   That’s my opinion though.
---
Thank you for at least being civil above all else, whereas others would be defending themselves in more of a fanatical manner.
---
Back at you mate.
---
No problem. They were running the add on that when they are in frenzy the terror radius is heard through the whole map so I assumed he was in frenzy and trying to close distance so it was best to try and push through and open the gate.
---
I actually really like it
---
My fav was wraith
---
*slows vaults during a chase*
---
Holy shit lol, okay, I literally just replied to your comment and articulated why I thought you were wrong. I suggested that they cut back on releasing content such as killers and survivors, since it takes a lot of time to create them, to just take a chapter or two to delegate more time to bug fixes and balance issues and fixing the overall health of the game, rather than pushing out more content that potentially could break the game further.
---
And overhauled the game over the summer? Dude, console framerate still sucks ass, esspecially on the new map, and it is almost tradition at this point that the audio gets bugged every patch, survivor footsteps are incredibly quiet right now and can make you lose targets incredibly fast.
---
And that whole 2nd half of your wall of text makes no sense. It doesnt matter that the game was shit back then. I dont give a fuck about what it was like nearly 3 years ago. I care about how it is *now*. And right *now* three killers are bugged, one to a near unplayable degree, console is looking more and more like ass, and yet more and more content is being released that is breaking the game further rn because they keep pushing themselves to release chapters and not have enough time to fix the game. 
---
All I said was that they need to do a deal like Operation Health and fix bugs and balance issues. That's it. Literally chill dude
---
Oh no what ever am i going to do
---
Snitch
---
Boom boom croissant
---
I.. Love it
---
Yes and no. Two peoples time, but the health state is gained quicker which has a certain value, although the gen will take a slightly slower rate with both of you on it. Entirely situational
---
Holy shit this is what y'all have to deal with on PC?! Keep that shit away from consoles!!
---
but it's like why fucking comment at all?  If you can't meet the qualifications for a job, you wouldn't apply for it.  You wouldn't go to the applicant and be like "apply somewhere else dipshit."  I know this isn't the most DBD related post, but I'm waiting on the mods to let me know if these posts are allowed or not since a big part of my mental health comes from DBD.
---
And so far, I've met 3 really good people from posting here.  It's helped me better myself a lot.  While it's not professional help, it's something at least.  I've tried professional help a ton and I feel less and less comfortable with it.  That's just how I see it.  I have no idea anymore because I keep getting gaslighted and mixed responses, and the mods haven't replied to my letter so idk
---
The rest of the DBD team can't code and that didn't stop them from making a game.
---
It is though. Iri heads one shot but the downside is you only get one so you have to have good aim
---
Wait what?

At least it's vague enough so that when dbd dies you just look like a really big scream fan, which I mean, aren't we all?
---
How does dance with me work with head on? Does it remove the scratch marks on the locker when entering or exiting?
---
A clan of bills. Nice
---
Rank doesn't mean skill dumbass.
---
Wait are all of these free?
---
Danm survival mains
---
Would love it if Doc didnt always need addons too. He's my favorite to play but the base range is garbage and his zap is already unreliable as hell... Atleast he isn't as bad as Wraith ya but still. Would love if they'd nerf addons and give the things nerfed base to the killer or atleast make us keep the addons if we get Brutal Killer/minimum 2k
---
Exactly maybe I shoulda mentioned that lol the mask was my favourite as a kid and then grew up watching the movies and loved it even more, then it got added to my favourite game so it’s a lot more than a dbd tattoo to me anyways.
---
Happened to me with the spirit right before I posted this lmao
---
“Failing your self care skill checks” 
---
I’ve literally never seen this in purple or reds.
---
Well that sucks, this is literally the only and first multiplayer game I've ever consistently played, other than l4d back in the day when there was no chat options. To be honest I don't receive many messages thankfully but that's probably because I'm on console. I don't think I would be able to continue playing this game if I was on PC with end game chat.
---
Oh man Dante as a killer or survivor would lit as fuck
---
The killer’s connection to the servers was fine, it was your connection that was bad. That’s why you froze and he didn’t. It would’ve been the same if you were lagging and the killer was the host.
---
It's called a Flock of Bills.
---
No, the problem is they can't do net code for multiplayer games. They keep saying like dedicated servers are some magical fix. It's not. I've played games on a shit connection for the past 10years, and i haven't seen something so broken as this.
---
Yes it works, just take a hit while killer carry other survivor :P
---
For real lol
---
&gt; I suggested that they cut back on releasing content such as killers and survivors, since it takes a lot of time to create them, to just take a chapter or two to delegate more time to bug fixes and balance issues and fixing the overall health of the game, rather than pushing out more content that potentially could break the game further.
---
And as we just established, these are different teams. 1 team is not dedicated to balance, killer design and bug fixes. 1 is not hindering the other.
---
&gt;  It doesnt matter that the game was shit back then.
---
Way to misinterpret what I said entirely. The point was that they haven't been sitting on there asses in maintenance mode, they have been doing massive bug fixes and changes to the game and improving it over time. It DOES matter that it wasn't so long ago the game was in a significantly garbage state. They don't need a DBD operation health because they are already making progress without it.
---
Obviously, but I don’t see the option to award it
---
Dull totems give a 5% reduced speed for repairing and there's a counter of how many are left on the map. Buffs survivor solo queue and makes gens go slower/adds more things to do
---
Remember, consider getting a pet. It actually works. Now I’m actually done bye.
---
But here's the problem, he literally cannot lose you with the blood orbs you drop.  Especially with that ultra rare addon that everyone brings in to every game
---
Truth. Even better lol
---
I doubt they will change Billy's base kit, just the addons. Also the only thing Billy an Bubba have in common is that they have a chainsaw.
---
I feel like playing tonight. Inspiration lol
---
I always pictured the Iridescent stuff as things blessed by or given from the Entity. Hence why it's usually the "strongest" add-on most of the killer has. If I'm not mistaken these all have descriptions saying they came from the Fog or the Entity in someway.
---
There their and they're are homophones
---
I hope one day you can return. I understand how it might take a toll mentally &amp; emotionally, so if a break is what you need then I’m glad you’re taking it. I do believe that your ability to recognize that you make mistakes sets you apart from others who play, though. The fact that it makes you feel this strongly shows that you’re more caring than most toxic players, you more than deserve to play this game. Either way, play some other games, do your thing, have fun without having to worry about carrying this guilt, then possibly come back around one day.
---
It's not though. Tunneling, camping, flash light spam and tbagging, BBQ&amp;C is toxic. Those 2 extra hatchets isn't toxic its smart
---
Says you. Not that I doubt you but it's easy to say this whenever anybody gets called out for being toxic.
---
dance with me, quick and quite, head on+any 1 meta perk. Very fun to play.
---
It'd probably have a description along the lines of "Its taste is uneasy, malevolent. As if it was made from the energies of the Fog itself."
---
Totally unrelated, but at the moment I've commented this I got this comment 69 upvotes.
---
I hit survivors as killer a lot through pallets and windows after the vault and start to move. BHVR can't code.
---
I would love if green Windstorm and Swift Hunt were default, and for Doc all I can really suggest is that one add-on that increases blasts by 75% be default, cause as it is now he has to be in kissing distance to be able to zap zap
---
You think they got mad at him?
---
It’s not up yet, I’m shooting for early next year - I’m building up the stock now. I’ll post it on Thai sub when it’s up. 
---
And weirdly, the print quality on EVERYTHING else I’ve seen from redbubble that wasn’t a sticker (shirts, posters, phone cases)  has been really good. You’d think stickers would be the baseline to get right and move on from there. Oh well.
---
I don't understand why people are so willing to upvote the same content over and over
---
Psychologically uncomfortable? Yeah. I don think they were aiming to make people feel physically ill though. If some feels like they want to throw up, they probably aren’t going to play the game.
---
I think you misspelled "*Get Hit While Using Dead Hard*"
---
I'm just here to read all the comments about how people won't bother learning how to control Oni on console.
---
It's not implausible, people can be really stupid sometimes.
---
I feel like you’re drinking dumb fuck juice
---
I gained Ash first. 
---
And then Jake.
---
It was a rough early life in this game.
---
That's not how you use sprint burst.
---
You keep it on 1s of exhaustion left and run around to have it on command
---
got to a gen? activate it to get exhausted and start working on the gen. If it comes back you can either leave the gen and get killer's attention or activate it again and finish the gen (without ruin and assuming that you land a few greats doing the gen takes less than 80s so it should be almost perfect after the second use)
---
It's the best exhaustion perk (after you learn to manage your exhaustion correctly) if you're the dedicated runner
---
I can't speak for other people, but I'm commenting because I care. I don't know what's going on with you, and I don't know if I can offer the kind of support you need, so I want you to try to reach out to the best possible resources you can. If you just need someone to chat with or talk to, I can do that.
---
I've been suicidal myself. I've stood in a river holding on to a tree wondering if I should let go and let the current take me under. I've come a long ways since then, and I believe that other people can do it too. I don't believe that anyone really wants to die. We want the pain to go away so we can enjoy life.
---
I commend you for feeling like you can post here. It's tough to open up about something like this. It may make you feel more comfortable to reach out to this community, but I hope you understand why people are suggesting you seek professional help. This kind of thing can be a little heavy for people to deal with.
---
Again, please reach out if you'd like to connect outside this forum. I've got the time to listen if you need to talk.
---
you get that escape as obsession points as well
---
If all the survivors are there and not doing generators than your doing your job. Bloodlust and get some free smacks in
---
Don’t boop my snoot I don’t like it
---
Okay, even if balance, bug fixing and killer design/perk design ARE seperate teams, that means that in order to make a killer, it has to first be artistically designed by the art team (no biggie really), but then they have to go through THREE SEPERATE TEAMS in order to be released (Balance, Killer Power/Perk Design, Fixes for Bugs). That eats up a LOT of time, I'm sure. Why not hold off on that for a while so they can make fixes, balance changes, and rework certain perks and killer powers?
---
And if they have been making such *amazing* progress over the course of *3 whole fucking years* then surely they'd be able to make a TON of progress if they skipped a chapter and dedicated those teams to bug fixing, balancing, and reworks?
---
You left the game because you couldn't get to a higher rank where the survivors are even more toxic and sweaty?
---
i know nothing about the frames but generators are done way too fast. a high rank swf group with a couple of toolbox will really show the killer who’s boss. all the generators could get completed in a few minutes and even less if none of them are found.
---
If only it was a guy instead of a girl, then it would be a skin i want.
---
Myers has capped evil per player. He can't keep one tool alive and get infinite power uses out of them running around like an idiot.
---
Prove your rank 2....  i highly doubt you are because there are plenty of counters to this problem that you never mentioned...
---
Apparently all his add ons are getting reworked and one of them makes his chainsaw completely silent so you might want to wait for it to come before looking for a build.
---
Yeah, thana is good but only if survivors don’t cleanse and most of the time the idiots cleanse and it does me no good.
---
I hope they don’t nerf her to the ground, she’s already not very strong. Your right, it probably is gonna happen. I hope they maybe do a little bit of tweaking and balancing and don’t just outright gut her.
---
Yes, but by sitting in one place for 32 seconds you're making yourself vulnerable and also, running selfcare teaches you a bad habit of taking hits you shouldn't take and healing straight away.
---
As a killer, I usually try to identify Self Care users and I just smack them and leave. Why? Because they will go and heal 90% of the time. It's almost as good as hooking them
---
Oh yeah, forgot about the charge time thing. Maybe make it so that it is 75% larger (like the add-on) but don't change the charge time? Make it default how it is?
---
Bet it runs better than console.
---
You're fun at parties.
---
Yeah frames suck ass on console. Every patch they get progressively worse
---
Go look on my page,  you know if it's that serious. Also,  I DO run ds if that's what you mean lololol.
---
i think you also mean fuck swamp
---
At this point all killers but the burger king myers will be banned by survivours 'cause "they are too strong!!!"
---
Rank is a display of how much you've played that month, not skill.
---
But yeah, imo solo queue has the potential to be the worst player experience in the game
---
sad to see since she’s one of those killers that can be either weak or strong. if you take away her possibility of being strong you just have weakness/a decent killer. rip.
---
You completely understand the situation. I find most people think that self care is actually a waste of time, when it is actually more effective if everything goes right. As long as no one needs you for 32 seconds it works better than normal healing. You understand though
---
The thing is, I'm on a wired connection and my ping was 60. The servers spike really bad sometimes on everyone's end. It's bs.
---
Jesus man
---
Oh my... I just tried a build w Whispers/Dying light/BBQ and for add ons I used the tuning guide and muffler. Ended up w a 3k and a couple of times whispers and dark devotion really felt like they were paying off
---
He's also an m1 killer when he's not using his power and there are some loops he can't do. He's definitely not op. Loo
---
Would you rather have it like it was years ago when you could just Mori someone without hooking them once?
---
These are rad! Just got a new follower!
---
I posted it, so feel free to go see.
---
I should have fucking known given my tag.
---
If you cleanse she turns into an upgraded Huntress. If you don't cleanse she can only down you with a basic attack so windows and pallets are safer.
---
Is it hard to understand that most people are dicks and he was just checking if the dude was one before hand
---
What's wrong with that? Clearly that's the best strategy! 
---
- totally *not* a Legion main
---
No, because it's programming. Tossing more people at a problem doesn't speed it up and often slows things down. 
---
And I need to be specific apparently. The new servers, audio engine, engine upgrade that even allowed this game to run on the switch, huge balance changes all happened this year. 2018 was the start to a lot of fixes for the overall health of the game and getting it out of the miserable spot it was lingering in.
---
Imagine if the current version of Freddy was the one that was originally released.
---
Alright here's how the no cleanse meta goes:
---
D o n t  C l e a n s e
---
75% larger of 9m is really big for something AOE. It's almost 18m. Especially with the same charge time? It would make dodging his power almost impossible and extremely unfun to play against. I feel that moldy electrodes and making the shock instant after cast would make him a lot more viable but they're already reworking him rn so we'll see what they do and if theu adress his main problems...
---
Also I dont know if you tried Man of Medan but it's a pretty good game
---
Nah he's not
---
TY for your support.
---
I'm a rank 10 and those red rank teams are pretty normal for me as well. Just because they are red ranks doesnt mean they're pros, I've played against some pretty average red ranks and I'm a pretty average killer at best.
---
In a nutshell, the plague's power, corrupt purge, is so strong that typically the best way to play against plague is to deny her the use of corrupt purge for almost the entire game.
---
There are anime versions of bubba too.
---
18th (Next Wednesday).
---
The challenges were leaked, but chances are they my change them after the feedback on level 3.
---
Cleansing gives her the chance to down you in one hit which is why most people get annoyed at people who cleanse in plague games.
---
Did you guys ever hear a song by Britney Spears from 2003 that was kinda catchy but you never wanted to admit it to yourself? That was probably Toxic.
---
Dc also doesn't count as escape.
---
Supposedly on rank reset day? 13th to be exact. But might be untrue.
---
Aw, I miss being 12.
---
If you would like some help with it shoot me a DM
---
Not always. If you're hardcore and good at looping a super-tall M1 killer, don't cleanse. Denying her corrupt purge if everyone can loop for a gen or two is meta.
---
However, if she can't be looped properly and there are a lot of blockers ( think Hawkins, tight jungle gyms, etc. ) then cleansing is okay.
---
Cleansing is a good idea too if someone cleanses and you're sick. She'll have the power no matter what, so you might as well cleanse to deny her the easy down from one corrupt purge shot.
---
If Billy is balanced, then Oni is perfectly fine. Lol
---
Demos portals have way more potential than Trappers traps though, especially if you reserve a portal at each gate for an endgame sweep where they can’t make it to either door without destroying a portal and alerting you
---
Did you not read what I said? I definitely know that rank 1s are better ISH.  But i got to rank 1 so fast as a piece of shit player and then eventually understood how to survive optimally and successfully. But it’s way too easy to get to red ranks with very little hours that it’s still very shitty.  That’s why rank doesn’t matter
---
Fuck the gas station map.
---
What ? Homophobes ? How dare you !
---
Eh. Its pretty bad though. If you run noed you really a sweaty or just bad. Either one. Mori is a mori though. Also i dislike you a bit more cause of your use of emojis.
---
I’ve been farmed by people and just sat there watching them commentating about how much I want them to get camped
---
Then cleanse

---
It depends on your skill level, your teammates' skill levels, and how good the killer is. I'm comfortable enough with looping, I'd rather stay sick/broken most of the match.
---
The only times I cleanse are if I'm going for a risky save, if it's end game, if I'm on death hook, or if everyone else is cleansing like crazy. If I have to cleanse, I pick a fountain that is not close to any remaining gens, hooked survivors, exit gates, etc.
---
Turbo edition remix HD
---
I mentioned how OoO is great on undetectable killers, then you mention Freddy who only gives oblivious status. That led me to think you meant Freddy was an undetectable killer
---
Moris are pretty unfair. It's like the survivor equivalent of using a key.
---
Thank you for the offer but I'm on console
---
Short answer: read patch notes
---
Everyone got exclusives
---
Now you can only derank, which will happen if:
---
1 the killer brings a mori
---
2 you run the killer for 5 gens
---
3 some else runs the killer for 5 gens
---
4 you get facecamped
---
5 the killer is AFK.
---
Its a mori. And hes a survivor. Explanation over.
---
Big oof would help if we had crossplay
---
You know how there was a tome challenge for "disturb 20 crows?"
---
Give me "walk past 20 crows without disturbing them using calm spirit"

This is amazing! I can’t stop looking at it!

This man is our Lord and saviour. He's done this with so many different spam posts

You missed the most important rule, you don’t wanna get flamed for not going easy on people if someone kills themselves on their first hook.
---
My button is broken cause of it. I can't struggle until I get a new controller and I have been using the broken one for awhile cause I just don't feel like switching till probably Christmas. It's basically hard mode all the time now
---
I was responding to the specific situation given by OP. If you cleanse, you're healthy again, and it takes two hits. If you're broken, you're always OHD, regardless of if she has Corrupt Purge or not.
---
It does. Seriously, rank 10s+ play extremely unoptimally and are easy for experienced killers. Same with killers. The fact that you're on the subreddit means you already have more game knowledge than the average player who just plays this game casually. You really underestimate the low ranks
---
TAKE THEM
---
Stop with the toxic posts. We get it, some of the people who play this game are arseholes.
---
Haven't played plague but I bought Oni on PS4 and I'm highly disappointed. Maybe I just need to get good but he's really hard to control.
---
to be honest. Playing this game feels like im drinking dumb fuck juice all the time
---
Its an auto comms ban on xbox for any profanity if you report the message.
---
Anything? A list of what I "could" do to prevent it orrrr what?

What do you mean? Aren't his livestreams the same speed/unedited?
---
Fair
---
&gt;Stop with the toxic posts. We get it, some of the people who play this game are arseholes.
---
Most of the time they are not even arseholes, the word toxic just doesn't have any meaning basically.
---
No only bill the rest come out available with shards besides licensed characters .
---
This is what I was thinking
---
The systrm u r explaining is similar to identity v
---
Not on my screen they aren't. I've had hits that should be misses
---
Fuck all maps besides The Game
---
Well in the gaming community, specifically this one, they usually mean somebody wasn't very nice to them and they need to cry about it for a bit.
---
Yea for real. Playing to win isnt toxic. People cant seem to understand that though.
---
I was just doing the survivor's master challenge to complete 3 generators in one trial and it glitched out, I think because I actually did 4.  Now it's completed, but I didn't get the bloodpoints and I'm assuming the rift fragments for doing so  Is there an easy way to fix this that anyone knows of?
---
O'air in the Lorax
---
Same thing for us Killers. Yeah maybe I'll get into a game instantly on console but because there aren't enough of us I constantly get matched up with people way above my rank who stomp me and it's no fun. About to stop playing killer and I'll just be one more of many and that's why Survivor queue times are so long.
---
have you tried not tunneling?
---
and if even one of you says git gud I swear to god
---
Oh shit you're right
---
I still had the mindset that dead hard doesn't really work too well anymore
---
I mean HONESTLY, if it gives me exhausted it should dodge the hit, come on
---
It’s so true! I have waited so long for an immersed Claudette to come and save me from hook just to get hit, run away, and try to heal up all the way again.
---
I love it
---
I actually never died to endgame before ironically XD
---
Yea I don’t want to struggle because I legit just bought a new keyboard. Last thing I need is for the spacebar to stop working
---
I get that a lot and really fucks me over. Blood lust, someone being unhooked, like every game action just makes the game chug for a few seconds
---
Wasn't tunneling
---
Okay thank you
---
But what he mentioned here is toxic. Being a dickhead and such is toxic. Otherwise you're completely correct
---
If you run iron will and just work on gens, loop, and do your best to not get spotted again you can do it. Yes this meta works, You just have to readjust your playstyle. Its immensely easier with a group (you can switch off on who holds her attention while the rest knock gens out)
---
Basically if you haven't been spotted and someone else cleans, they made you "exposed" in a sense. Because now she can just puke on you and you go down. To where as if they don't cleanse you can still take multiple hits. I don't usually find plague very often but when I do, we usually make it out if people deny her the cleanse. Otherwise they can be terrifying. But I do understand your concern. Because if everyone is already infected then it can feel helpless. But think of it this way.
---
 Let's take the time to cleanse and then heal up all the way. Plague finds pool and uses it. She comes around a normal loop spot that you could easily slip away from if she was relying on her base attack. Unfortunately she found the pool so she pukes over the pallet and you go down. All that time cleaning and healing was wasted because she instadowned you regardless. 
---
It is easier to try and just push through it (from personal experience but that is just my opinion. But honestly just do what makes the game fun for YOU)
---
I got my friend's Xbox communications banned for calling someone a bitch.
---
That sweater makes Bill even more of a cutie
---
So what are the solutions? The thing is not enough people want to play killer because currently we get matched up against people ranked much higher than us and get stomped so we quit playing that side leading to longer queue times for Survivor.
---
Dude same. Except I have about 470 hours
---
I got it also on PS Plus, are there people playing it? I finished the campaign.
---
It's programming? That's it? Dude, if they're doing their jobs, then coding and programming shouldn't be a problem. Devs are flexible and they can work on multiple things without slowing progress down to a halt. That is ridiculous. There are so many things they could be working on that require minimal coding and programming that they could do if that is an actual concern.
---
The new servers feel the same as the older ones (Console tho, can't comment on dedicated servers, tho from what I've seen, I do think they look a bit buggy), and the audio engine bugs literally every update. The endgame collapse was good, but in terms of balancing killers specifically, there is a good reason why everyone keeps gravitating towards the same three, maybe four, killers. They've nerfed Legion and Pig and refuse to look at some other killers such as Leatherface, who has been dogshit since release, or Wraith, who is so add-on dependant that he can only be played in 2 ways: Vault Wraith, or Speed Wraith. And even then, right now, Wraith is bugged, so you cant even be Speed Wraith, since his speed boost after uncloaking is missing rn. If they had more time, bugs like that that can literally make a killer useless wouldn't end up in the game, or at least would be able to be fixed faster than they are right now.
---
If you see someone do a 360, just watch them spin themselves and then hit them. Especially if they just keep doing it.
---
There are no broken killers
---
you were totally tunneling
---
I just dont know what the hell I'm supposed to do. They're spinning in every direction and it feels like I need fighter pilot reflexes and a sixth sense to know where they'll be at any given point to M1 them
---
Totem spots should be completely random, just like hatch spawn locations.
---
Everyone heals eventually. Injuring a surv will always take away 32 seconds (at base) doesn’t really matter if they heal immediately or not if you don’t have someone hooked or a gen that needs a quick finish. It makes no difference
---
Oh yeah, how so? Someone gets unhooked, I'm not chasing anyone and follow, I see scratch marks, am I just supposed to ignore all of that?
---
I hope he is fun to play as and against after the update. More than one have I went against a Doctor and groaned my throat raw.
---
From the sound of his bugged "leak" power, the Static Charge thing sounds interesting
---
&gt; since you can't alert crows while using it 
---
You sure about that, it's Dead by Daylight we are talking about. I was scaring crows with Tier III calm spirit.
---
I try going by sound, rather than what I see. Which is kinda helping
---
If that was a server spike everyone would’ve lagged back, including the killer.
---
They can be insane  if you're skilled. Demo is just good. You need to sweat a lot for same result on demo
---
Must resist.....get....go....jk
---
this is a possibility
---
git gud
---
nah just kidding lmao
---
sometimes I wait a little bit when I'm near them if I see they wanna try something strange, so they 360 and I wait for them to do it, and then I strike.
---
tipically when they have no dead hard they always try to 360, when they cant reach windows or pallets they do it to have the time to escape from you, just wait and try to read their mind; usually it's their last chance of survival so they always try to 360, so keep that in mind and strike when you are sure to hit, it's a bir like counter dead hard.
---
Well if they keep doing it then I can't hit them. It's like an immunity combo against me.
---
That's like calling someone a camper if all the other survivors are swarming the area and the killer doesn't leave the area
---
Laurie Strode also has Object of Obsession which is pretty strong. 
---
I personally will sink the bloodpoints into her to get that along with DS. Of course it's a paid DLC but it's like 3.15$ when on sale at [gamersgate.com](https://gamersgate.com), and Mike Myers is a fun killer to play, plus quite lethal.
---
💜 i love this
---
Ignore them man
---
I think it's only toxic in a situation where you are the last survivor and you are running an infinite loop to troll the killer, like the old hatch situation. If it's earlier in the game and there are four survivors, then the killer is free at any point to stop trying to chase you when you clearly have a favorable position. What is the survivor supposed to do in that situation, just peel off of the loop where they are safe just to be a good sport about it?
---
Cleansing gives her the ability to end chases and deny loops.
---
A broken survivor has a higher chance of looping her due to her decreased overall range.
---
The best time to cleanse in near the endgame at a fountain very far from the last gens so she wastes her time and the power.
---
Ignore toxic people or the unhooking?
---
I feel you on the gen speeds man. Its getting a bit ridiculous. Ill lose to a group that cant even loop well at all but they just find ruin in the first 30 sec and then do gens through everything. I think survivors are just getting more optimal and theyre gunna have to address it.
---
Toxic people and that guy who you just replied to. Don't bother with either
---
Alright. Thanks bro
---
Np
---
Ok this I can get behind more than d O n T C l E a N s E
---
Yea, that's what I am saying. You want people to waste time healing as Legion. People think running Sloopy makes heals slower, but then survivors won't heal at all and therefore it's a wasted slot.
---
I've been asking for a phobia mode that allows people to pick killers they dont want to play against. Obviously itd be abused somehow to get to red ranks easier, but I feel they could work around that. I just want to be able to play games with my friends and one of them stopped playing because they hate clowns. 😅
---
I'd also love help but I'm on EU :(
---
Idea 1: As a survivor main, 360s are all about anticipation. We see your red stain and we just try to time a 360. Often this leads to us 360ing to early or to late. If you are following a survivor and they have proven they know how to 360, wait for them to 360 and then attack. If they 360 and you don't swing, it freaks them out and they panick, leaving you to have an easy hit.
---
Idea 2: One thing that always gets me is when I get a killer who turns with his swing. Naturally, I find survivors 360 to the left. If you are getting 360d, turn left with you swing. You can cover a 90 degree area before your swing is up. That can increase your chances to hit by a ton.
---
It's not a bad thing on its own, but I and many others are tired of seeing the same DS escape every week on this sub
---
Should I get pgtw or should I save for spirit (i have 7k shards, had enough but bought DS last week)
---
Bleeding doesnt mean much, the sounds though are a problem. Iron Will can easily replace self care and you then get the practice playing injured,  one of the most powerful skills to achieve.
---
I think the worst one is killers that bitch about genrushing.
---
According to BHVR lmao
---
&gt;But what he mentioned here is toxic. Being a dickhead and such is toxic. Otherwise you're completely correct
---
He mentioned something done during the match which he responded by camping while fully aware of his actions expecting a post-game chat being disrespectful. 
---
There is little to nothing a survivor can do a killer mid-match that is toxic.
---
Isnt the entity like a limbo dead and alive? So I wouldn't technically count his as really alive. Idk tho.
---
So I haven't havent had internet at my house since the Spirit came out(Yes I know it's been a minute). But I know about how the Legion fuck the shit out of the game on his release and now is not that great but I still feel like I would main him next to the Trapper
---
You'd probably get more if people didn't use questions as a way to hurt those that try answering genuinely. Like using answering to them as justification for unleashing their vitriolic biases upon their targets. when you give 4 500 character responses to allow them to accurately share in your perspective. Then they try to guilt trip you and tell you to "die"... Rather than address anything you just wrote about at all. I could sympathize with anybody that wouldn't want to experience that again.
---
People like this have no life, IT IS A GAME
---
He said ggs because he escaped
---
Just don’t reveal to the killer that you have tenacity? Unbreakable + tenacity have given me some of my best moments in this game.

What
---
Does he have lag spikes/freezes in any ither games? I noticed i was getting them in other games but in dbd and in rocket league I would frequently take so long loading that it would just dc me. Got a ssd and now everything runs smooth
---
i think pig's attack is a horizontal one, right? otherwise use clown's gag
---
Self care is such an over rated perk.
---
Learn lunge distances, which pallets you can get away with not kicking
---
I use Enduring, Fire Up, Distressing and Insidious on Amanda.
---
Enduring for if I miss an attack next to pallets while charging.
---
Fire up for compensating those baptism trap placements and picking up Survivors faster.
---
Distressing to confuse Survivor's terror radius when standing and insidious for knowing when you fully have zero terror radius.
---
At least they got their hatch achievement
---
Yeah, I wasn't agreeing with the post I was honestly asking what ideas you had.
---
nah she's just doing some blackface there. the others think its a riot. there are no PC rules when ure stuck in a game forever
---
&amp; Knuckles.
---
No, go fuck yourself. I'm going to bring self-care and ignore everybody on hook and heal myself in the corner just to piss people like you off.
---
Iron Will, DS, or Spine Chill.
---
I'm not going to find anybody if they're silent and always know when I'm coming.
---
1 hit is a bar half full.
---
that person is then dropping resources that do not dissipate. 
---
stopping to heal leaves hotspots of the resource,  nurses calling is essentially a free power locator, rushed actions and failed healing skillchecks dump a pile of orbs in their wake. 
---
you overestimate how much it takes to get his power. Takes less than a minute after finding and injuring someone,  which then has a knock-on effect of them being able to then cover the entire map in seconds to take down multiple people,  all of which are injured if they get up,  leaving more orbs, meaning another easily filled bar.
---
whereas billy cant simply sprint map-wide without a single care in the world after every down, they need to be in the right position or be punished for it for hitting a wall or obstacle on the way. Oni can just lay the smackdown, turn 90 degrees and charge in 1 second with full disregard for obstacles so long as they don't literally stop forward movement fully.
---
I say im improving because i get matched with rank 2 survivors all the time, and gone from rank 8 to rank 5 in a day.
---
That quote by the way is actually from my most recent reply to a person who asked how I knew they were in a locker. I told them flat. Nothing but the facts. They told me why they thought I should die. 
---
Won't stop me from answering others but I would understand if it did stop someone else.

Yeah because you always want to bring a medkit and nothing else right? Absolutely no reason you would ever want to bring a toolbox.

I was rank 19 and got matched against rank 6s today, then one DC'ed on the loading screen and I was spared
---
play like how the killers that give u a hard time play that is how I learned survivor when I was just a killer main
---
Thank you! :D
---
Which perks, if any, can be/are better at level 1 than level 3?
---
Thank you I appreciate it lol :)
---
Exactly, they think they have the right to dictate what perks their teammates bring. You don't always have somebody fucking following you waiting to heal you all match long.
---
I remember one of my first games.
---
Some guy would unhook me with the killer nearby. I'd get down. Rehooked and unhook instantly. Basically was killed isntsntly.
---
I watched as they all escaped. They were friends (not the killer of couse) the one laughing how they farmed me. I never made a comment since wtf to say to a pack of friends? Obviously theyll just troll me more.
---
Mate I was thinking this just the other day !!!
---
I'm a green rank survivor rank 19 killer who got all survivors at rank 5, 6 and 7 today
---
I watch them daily and love them dearly! I even have 2 michael shirts but holy hell do I hate watching them suck at this game lol. I yell the whole time!
---
Dude, he posts the same type of shit here every day. He's looking for attention. This is a sub for a video game not Suicide Prevention. Dude needs to seek some real help and stop posting his suicide notes on a fucking video game sub.
---
P!nk cosmetics.
---
I like how he doesn’t SHOW how the legions a facecamper. Also quit whining about noed people.  For killers like legion it’s necessary.  New legions that is...
---
I main as the pig and the plague, so I have lots of tips. Firstly, use headphones with directional hearing. Listen to everything around you. Everything. You'll catch little clues from a footstep or grass rustling. Secondly, use as many perks as you can that highlight the survivors for any given amount of time, and use Sloppy Butcher if you have it. Most killers can use it I believe if not all. Thirdly, use your surroundings to your advantage. The pig can crouch, perfect for places with tall grass and boulders. You can see through it but survivors can't always see you, and the pig's terror radius drops to 0 in crouch. She's honestly the best killer IMO. Hide behind walls, boulders, shrubs, etc. Don't rush the attack, if you miss there's a penalty. Immediately after making a hit, pay attention to their movements and follow quickly. Don't let the survivors group up too much, keep them scattered. But patrol the generators when you can't find them. Use all advantages, like the bear traps, reverse bear traps, the vomit, etc. And if you ever want to practice, message me directly and I'll do a custom with you to teach you. I have PC (don't play often) and Xbox.
---
They think they have the right to dictate what everyone brings - Teammates, opponent... Doesn't matter.
---
Everyone's talking about the matchmaking and yeah that does suck, but I especially sympathize with you on the whole "trying a new killer and getting fucked" part.
---
What does sweaty mean? I’ve seen it used a bit in this subreddit.
---
How much money is that in real dollars?
---
I am unfamiliar with that game? but i wasnt trying to copy any other game in particular, but more so just hoping we could get some form of reward :)
---
It does in some ways, teammates get downed in 1 hit when without NOED they might have been able to make it to a door. Gives you and your team time to find the totem and rescue your teammate instead of opening the gate and having 2 minutes.

Not all solo players are bad teammates.  If you are having that big an issue in solo queue, maybe run kindered.  It now helps you too,  as you can see all survivors when someone besides you is hooked.  If you have gotten used to SWF, it takes some getting used to but I still get good teammates and only play solo.  Yeah sometimes I get potato teammates, but sometimes I end up being the potato. Some games just go that way.   Don't take it too seriously if you don't escape and find ways to make the game fun for you with new builds or challenges. 
---
That's my thoughts anyway.  Good luck out there.
---
Maybe they keep it because of achievements?
---
*proceeds to downvote*
---
Do the pre-game loading screen tips actually give away who the killer is going to be? Wondering if I'm going crazy.
---
I don’t think think you quite understand that balance means more than esthetic for most people. Vaulting is a huge part of running a killer as survivor. If you have to guess all the time if becomes less skill and more chance. And they didn’t change it for potatoes. Getting slapped because you don’t know if she’s vaulting or not has nothing to do with being good or not.
---
This is a fucking sub for dbd, not Suicide Prevention. No reason he needs to go browse somewhere else. Just look at OP's post history here. He's been doing this shit for days if not longer and it's getting old. Plenty of people have given him advice on how to find help but he just keeps coming back here like we're supposed to be Suicide Prevention professionals.
---
Well you're a complete retard
---
There’s 0 wait time on Xbox for killer.
---
Yes. He has two separate animations with his katana, one for hitting a healthy survivor and one for downing an injured one, but both are considered basic attacks so STBFL can be stacked by both and will reduce the cooldown for both
---
After living through dead team mates spectating me in CSGO this somehow doesn't feel as bad
---
which perks are unbalanced
---
Ass Ketchup
---
Ah ok thank you
---
Implying anybody actually knows that Tenacity is even a perk
---
One doesn’t destroy a another’s game when they are making croissants, how many times do I need to say this?
---
Yes.
---
Would you rather have to loop a killer like you usually do or face a 115% machinegun huntress with infinite ammo that doesn’t have to aim?
---
David is a free survivor, just level him up :/
---
One time I was playing trapper with nurses and saw 3 of them healing basically in a row and behind stuff and I took them all out because none of them decided to stop healing
---
That's boring af tho
---
Devs say on forum what this is placeholders, so Challenges will be different
---
This will never happen to me because my teammates let me die on hook. I spectate them and realize why they just run Urban
---
So called because playing it is a nightmare in and of itself these days.
---
You don't seem to understand fat, fat is a shield. Just saying.
---
And if you even run the both of them, you're just as much of a chad to me and our team.
---
It's all good. Not many people play Plague enough to know, and not many survivors realize just how loud that puking and coughing is.
---
When I do play Killer, it's usually always as Plague (Unless I have a daily). I don't mind sharing info on how to play against her or what the finer details of her as a killer happen to be.
---
Funny enough, Iron Will is one reason I realized I liked Plague so much. I'm big on the whole "information is how you win the game" and getting free info from the puking/coughing was right in line with my playstyle, especially since I know how powerful Iron Will is.
---
I think you should get it. A great perk that will help you a lot. You can get the spirit after that.
---
I have noticed this since the last update, too.
---
They need to fix it, but this is Behaviour after all.
---
FUNKY KONG FOR KILLER 2020!!!
---
I’m saying GG cuz clearly you need some help chief. You’re still commenting on a post trying to prove what point? I’m saying GG to be toxic in this case cuz your ass is fucking annoying
---
That's actually hella smart. I usually just play legion 😂 speedy stabby boi makes finding people way easier for me. I may have to attempt plague though. I've been needing a new killer (I'm a survivor main but sometimes ya just need a break from being the victim 😂) 
---
Would discordance work with her very well?
---
Any perk can slow down the game if you don't know when or how to use it effectively.
---
The problem is bad players, not the perk.
---
If you're DCing to avoid people at higher ranks you're kinda part of the problem, because if all survivors, that are even half as good and nice as you think you are, do the same then no wonder why Rank 1 isn't all too pleasant.
---
Ohhhhhh
---
Gens are done fast in the beginning because they were spread around. Around this time, the tide is usually in the survivors' side.
---
Your job as a killer, if you do it correctly, is to snowball one hook into more as gens getting lesser in number. That's when you have more control and survivors have less choices in which gens they get to repair.
---
So no, the gen time is fine. Your time management, OTOH, is poor. You fail to recognise when the tide turns in your favour and maximise/capitalise on that. 3 gens get done in the beginning means nothing. It's always the last 2 + endgame that will undo the survivors.
---
wait til rank reset, its easy to pip up if youre like 17+ rank. tunnel ppl (its for a good cause) and when its down to 2 ppl, never hook either of them until theyre both down and also that u kno where both bodies are. then hook both
---
Higher rank isn't why. Toxicity is why
---
You could wait till rank reset which is the only way to get adept achievements because of this broken matchmaking
---
Perfectly Balanced As All Things Should Be.
---
If they're going to pubish DCs its nessary
---
Makes sense also I’m sure they’re going to understand the tunnel
---
You forgot Tombstone at the exit gates
---
I don't think you get it. If all of you "nice people" avoid these ranks then of course there aren't going to be any up there.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's of course better now that they're respawning, but man those were the days lol. Had so much fun sabotaging everything, now the Sabotage perk is just trash
---
Why not... Luigi says. You snap my trap so i snap your back
---
U think that Myers should have "active ability" button too? With the dedicated servers it's rly hard to 99% the power and when I play Myers I use it some time accidentally on injured survivors.
---
Fengs bob is iconic
---
It looks the same when you lose left behind if this helps
---
Its like playing chess but the opponent brings 3 queens.
---
Red box on the ground hatch size.
---
Well jokes on them feng is free on console *dab*
---
This is why I DC against Onis hoping that the next game would be more balanced.
---
oH hI mEg
---
I think this would cause me to die in real life from brain hemorrhage. Self care against sloppy by itself is just .... oh god...
---
Maybe you're right. Did not think of that.
---
That's only if they report you.
---
If they dont then sony doesnt care.
---

---
I couldnt do anything but laugh on "rimming" and walmart part
---
Wait and don't do a full hit just tap the swing usually they're in your radius so it'll hit. Also it slows you down enough to turn but not enough you'll lose them
---
That and infinite fucking reaction image memes. "mfw I DS the killer" "mfw dedicated servers" "mfw borrowed time" "mfw toxic swf" "mfw legion nerf" "mfw hatch" "mfw missed a skillcheck" "mfw jumpscare in a horror game"
---
I agree with you. People disagreeing with you are killer mains who want to play in easy mode. But being someone who plays both equally, I am able to realize that Onis need to reworked or nerfed. 
---
Same with Michael and Ghostface too. Why should I get punished when my teammates play bad?
---
Imagine in a team game where you get punished for your teammates' stupidity. Insane game design.
---
But Ninja Freddy was powerful af. Ninja Freddy was so fucking good, i was a freddy main when he was garbo. But most builds super sucked cause like you said you had to wait to be able to hit anyone.
---
Ssshhh... don't just tell the secrets of the keys like that !
---
Had the same question but figured it out after a bit of digging, once you click on an item on the bloodweb you do not need to hover over it anymore, just hold the click while you move your mouse to the next item you want to buy.
---
Fake Bill got no BT &gt;:(
---
They do they just mistake it for nerf. Sorry not sorry ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Surely.
---
Yes that should be for tier 3
---
Nah, you can't create your own. It's just if you have earned or purchased other cosmetics for the characters, you can equip them there.
---
Does it only show up like once u r near it?
---
What is it about this sub (and 50% of reddit in general) that makes every post turn into a cat fight lol
---
Yeah I wish they had found a middle ground for it. In order to use it now you basically have to have the whole team 99 hooks which just throws the game anyway.
---
It was same with spirit. But tbh she is pretty balanced unlike 'watch me stand wait for you to come close and hit you' gimmick.
---
Depends on your add on if you add the one that extends map range I think it's 16-20 meters. It really is bright red and you won't miss it.
---
NGL I want a funky mode now
---
The time you spend shocking one of them to T3 is extra time for the other 3 to do gens on top of the time it will take you to hook him. Honestly, even thinking about it in 1v1 terms is barely worth it because it doesn't take that long to snap out of it.
---
Learn to moonwalk to hide your stain. That’s the building block of being a good killer. Knowing how to play red stain mind games
---
They’ll probably just move their purple addons up
---
To your point 2: I call out entitled killers too. I'm a survivor main myself. I happen to play killer every now and then, but it's mostly survivor. I'm an equal opportunity asshole for calling out the entitlement this community has. Because no one gets to dictate how anyone else plays the game.
---
The fact I have you titled as survivor just happens to be based on what you so heavily complained about when I saved you.
---
And don't be sorry for expecting equality in the calling out. Ain't nothing wrong there and I agree on that one.
---
To everything else: Yeah, people suck. Most players aren't good and the ranking lets them get to low to mid ranks far too easily. **And that includes you and me**.  I'mma be honest, I don't play perfectly. I've got my preferred playstyle (Lockers to juke the killer and doing gens while reading the map and injured survivors to tell where the killer is) but that doesn't always mesh well with the other survivors or the killer. 
---
But I've still made it to red ranks. Despite games where I'm absolutely potato. Like, boiled, mashed, placed back into my skin, and placed into an oven to melt some cheese - **Potato**.
---
So when other survivors are potato... It sucks. But, what are you gonna do? Get your points and move on. Would it be better if everyone played absolutely perfectly at every single second of the game? Maybe... Probably not though. That'll get damned boring quickly.
---
I'm sure you make your share of mistakes, maybe not play perfectly. Maybe you lean on your duo to cover and shore up your weaknesses. I know if I'm duo'd with a looper friend of mine I'm able to call out the info (which he is absolutely horrible at reading) and he's able to loop (which I can't do to literally save my life) while I power through gens.
---
However it goes, you do you. If you're getting 24k and dying, you're doing better than expected and better than most.
---
Maybe you just gotta readjust your frame of reference and come at the game with a different goal. Stop thinking "escape every game" and start thinking "Maximize my score/bloodpoints."
---
myself\*
---
 lol
---
That's pretty redonkulous
---
Ah the sneaky plead for a doc buff
---
Right on, I like that. And you're right there definitely needs to be some kind of incentive to play the less populated side.
---
I mean they should at least give them the lowest ranks possible its just so hard to get better when games go by so fast. It just kinda sucks
---
[PC] Before Dedicated Servers, as far as I remembered, killers dodged my lobby when there was unavoidable apocalipse: flashes, full toolboxes, prestige. Trust me, killers do it to avoid bulling more than to ruin your queue, as most of the time this means higher ranks that will wreck you...
---
(Opinion based)
---
They play the game all lot
---
&gt; I personally see that a lot less than the 4man 5gens remaining sweeps killers can pull off. 
---
That's probably because you're a survivor and you and your team fuck up a lot.
---
Why shouldn't we balance the game around good players? Imagine if instead of there being tiny, arguably insignificant white advantage in chess, white won chess matches the majority of the time, especially between AIs. Even if the effect is smaller between players of lower skill, you would either need a design reason that white is favored or to work to balance it out.
---
And judging whether the game is survivor sided should either be done experimentally or theoretically, not based on your experience.
---
Ah, makes sense, that's not me then.
---
Broken Killers LMFAOOOOO what a joke
---
I mean, Amanda got shot in the head. Adiris probably succumbed to her illness. Rin is an actual ghost. The Oni probably bled out after getting massacred by the villagers. I think the Entity’s Realm is a sort of afterlife that you can go to if you die, but it can also take you prematurely for any number of reasons.
---
glitch where they can't pick them up
---
what happened in the comments??
---
I see you hate survivors
---
Well that Piggy has played too much Assassin's Creed
---
Were you in a party with them?
---
What is with the awful queue times lately?  It's bad on survivor side AND killer side, which is weird.
---
According The all of the Left 4 Dead games, comics and lore, but okay.
---
It's a nice sweater
---
My camera is turned to them during loops and whatnot, but when I'm gonna do a 360, Im watching in front of me to make sure I don't get blocked and I want to be ready to make a 360 by facing forward at the beginning and end. My brain mentally figures out the best time to 360 judging by their stain. I land 360s at least 80% of the time, and the times I miss a 360 is when the killer follow those two ideas I highlighted.
---
Dude that's not fair, if I was u I would let her kill me.....
---
At first I was like: "Oh boy another Matchmaking post" but then I realised that some people are pretty darn creative.
---
If you watch the video that’s what Otz point is. Otz does the same thing with trapper (Otz best killer) and gets the same results as Tru3. Trapper is also not a “great” killer but, as Otz says in the video, if you put enough love and time into one killer they will become viable.
---
remember all the things that killers did to you that you hated? avoid doing that. Otherwise most of what I know was learned from watching streamers and playing the game
---
Tbf I would be scared of Toby walking towards me
---
I'd stay till he DCes.
---
&lt;3 ty!!
---
Jesus that's just ridiculous. I'd definitely send this clip into support to report the guy. It's as simple as disconnecting and then hitting continue to fix the bug and let the killer leave, so this guy definitely forced you to stay in this game and dc. No excuse for that
---
Wow, literally telling you not to play plague. Bet he probs would have said that anyway no matter who you played.
---
You’re the first person to ever notice this. Thank you ;)

Survivor is 10x easier then killer imo. Survivors have much more chill time and perks that can recover their mistakes. Killers not so much. Other then like NoEd which is still exploitable by survivors and is highly looked down upon.
---
I like the bob it just needs some physics to it
---
I’m not completely sure then, I think they might have an option to join your session when they’re on the ps menu at Dead by daylight and below it shows that you’re playing it and they might have the option ’join session’ there
---
When I play Hag/Trapper I try to leave a trap right by the chest where they’d never expect it. It usually doesn’t get touched all game but when it works it works
---
Ill generally help out and talk to the pigs and megs I see that dont do well, but a lot of people dont like taking advice, especially if you just fisted them.  And then if they kill me and I try to help them improve I usually get the "lol ur just salty u got rekt lmao" so I usually just say gg and move on after most games.
---
tbh most of the hair of this game needs redone
---
At rank 15 i had survivors with ranks 4,3,3 and 5

Keep as much distance as possible. The closer clown is to you the harder it will be to get away. Clown can cut off loops with his gas so if he throws his gas at one side of a loop, instead of continuing through it, just run to the next one. Drop pallets early if you dont have enough time to reach a new loop without taking a hit. Try and stick to strong loops like shack and jungle gyms. Unsafe pallets are useless vs clown so dont even bother with them. The main thing is keeping distance. Clown has no mobility and no way to hide his terror radious so once you hear his heart beat, make sure you got a pallet near you or make distance fast.
---
I just tried it with my other friend, I see it now. I didn't know they didn't need my permission. Thanks a lot!
---
I’m not a very good player and I actually had one survivor come back from the exit gate and point at the hook. Wouldn’t leave until I hooked her. Nea wanted me to have at least one kill.
---
Your extremely bravo filled elistist response leads to to have to press X to doubt
---
I feel ya :D Had similar situation in Haddonfield :D rank 12 as a huntress that i didn't level and just wanted to try her vs 4 red ranks :D They said that I was bad at this game, they called me a "baby killer", and they "felt bad for me" :D On the other hand, I thing hunteress is going to become my 2nd favorite killer :D

NOED is hardly a sweat factor.

More like a *”Sigh welp, HE’S fucking dead. Peace boys”*

It’s been around so long, I remember before when it was just the OG killers and NOED was only terrifying on trapper.
---
Just combine David and Jake ones for absolute hilarity. Pick yourself up then sabo the hook near you.

---
i mean? i'm speaking from personal experience? you don't have to believe me but you also don't have to be a dick. please calm down.
---
just keep on playing the game and getting checks, you cant improve at the check if you gen tap so just ignore the perk and push through it

I mean, in some cases, that would work for urban evasion.

It's not even *just* that at this point, it's the endless stream of FUNNY FACE BOTTOM TEXT "content" that always get 2k upvotes for some reason
---
Stop giving them bad ideas.
---
Community is pretty toxic, sadly. Each side has its share of people that feel entitled, and the base goal of the game isn't exactly set in stone.
---
A killer getting 2 kills is supposedly a good thing, but lots of killers feel if they don't get 4k than they lost (or survivors think that about the killer). Survivors can get 28k points and still die. Escaping is just 5k worth of points. But some survivors think all that matters is surviving (or killers think that 4k-ing survivors is a win, even if the survivors have 20+ points each compared to the killers 10- points).
---
It's rough, but hopefully the entitlement will slowly be stripped away. DC penalties are going to help correct some issues, though people will still purposely die on hook (taking a whole 10 seconds sooner instead of DCing). And if we call out the entitled people enough, social pressure might get them to stop being so entitled.
---
Problem is most people don't want to call them out. They stay neutral to the entitlement, so the entitled people think that the silence means they're right in their entitled beliefs.
---
Or entitled players will thrive and overwhelm the community and the game will die. Who knows?
---
I mean they all escaped except one cause i had noed

If you're getting flashlighted every time you pick someone up, maybe try looking at a wall lmao actually the easiest fix in the world
---
Dude I have no idea. :/ I was just trying to explain what I meant and nothing more.
---
This shit is NOT ok! I sent salty messages to other people all the time, so I can’t say much. But I can say one thing, leave actual threats out of your fucking messages. You are a prick if you do this shit over a GD game! Trust me when I say I understand pure rage due to video games.

This is what it looked like from my view. He was "hooked" (showed the animation, upright like he was on a hook and in a hook location), however I could not rescue him either. I sabotaged the hook hoping it'd fix it but alas, no luck. 
---
Don't think this was intentional -- bugged all game. Not sure on that, though. I remember reading somewhere not long ago that someone couldn't leave, they had to alt-F4 out of the game. 
---
Either way, sorry about the game! Good game and well played. Good luck to you.

Why do you use BBQ and Agitation if you focus your attention to a selected area?

Lol no problem, I just always like to see the death escape rates when matchmaking goes insane. Guessing you were Myers this game based on the perks

I used to run No Mither + Tenacity and called myself "Tis' but a scratch"

It's considered "Marketplace theft" if I don't reach out to developers in order to solve the issue. I did exactly that and they told me not to discuss the ban.

 When you try to email them you get an automated message that bans cannot be revoked

Then try for the refund, see what happens

Unless you're on console then you have to buy him first :c

Ghostface isn't broken? The Killer with the most buggy, inconsistent power in the game isn't broken? Huntress, whose hatchets break on mid-air isn't broken? Doctor, those power can randomly bug out and leave you unable to attack until you interact with  something? 
---
But yeah bro nothing is broken. BHVR apologists aren't even attempting to hide their delusions anymore, it's unreal.
---
Ruin would just span in as soon as you knew about it that would be pointless
---
Of course
---
Been ready for a week and a half. Also on tier 61 so will be done with the rift real quick
---
The dbd on mobile is a no go you can’t wait for that long on mobile you can’t even watch something while waiting because well you’re you’re using what you’d usually use to pass time while waiting on pc
---
I think a mobile version of the game is going to come out eventually, and is currently being worked on. There are some people that are able to play it now through early access or something.
---
......But the game is design for teamwork, a game that you HAVE to cooperate with others if you want to win or get a lot of points.And yea sure, there are Killers that would completely destroy you even if you work as a team which I admit, it's because of how the Killer was designed and the way it's power works.But getting punish because of your team's mistake is a part of what makes this game a cooperative game.
---
Of course you're going to lose if your team messes up too many times, it's not like you can carry your entire team and still win in every match(there are exceptions here and there but it's not frequent enough).And because the Killer exploits on your team mistakes to win, you have to work with the team to minimize everyone's mistakes as much as possible.And yes, even then you can't guarantee that you will win cause some Killers just doesn't need you to make mistakes to win or if they're experienced enough to still win, but you can also argue that if someone doesn't want to work together or make multiple mistakes without learning, your team will fall apart and you will significantly increase your team chance of losing.
---
Of course, if you just want to play the game for fun and don't care about whether or not your team is cooperating, then yeah I agree that some Killers power are just not fun to go against when you're playing casual, and is frustrating when you lose to them.But even so, the game is made for playing as a group, a team and so your team's fuck up is also your mistakes.

Tbh your name seems as if its maybe better you are banned.

Pm me! I can help you how to download :)
---
Yo id stop using this account lmao make another one. That user name is horrible and it could bring trouble if linked to your real life. 
---
I wouldnt be using that account lol
---
There’s so many, it’s kind of weird honestly. Freddy, Jason, Ash, Chucky, Pinhead, you name it. I don’t know if the Leatherface one came out yet though. I know him and Pennywise just got announced recently.
---
Yeah. Gotta love being banned for taking care of my Child, girlfriend, fiancèe or wife. Fuck off.
---
And I thought my username was sinful.
---
Grab ruin from hag and bbq from leatherface ASAP. these perks are a great help to killers of all skills levels. As for actual tips a big one is learning how to apply pressure, make it so no survivor gets comfortable doing what they're doing, spread damage across everybody and don't fixtate on 1 person the entire match. Learn how to run common loops (loads of guides on YT) and try out every killer in the game before choosing a main, every killer has a different playstyle that you might like or hate.
---
How to speedrun account ban 101
---
Yeah theres a LOT of entitled pricks that play this game and dc whenever they go against something they dont like. That and dcing to let the last guy get hatch is common as well. Its irritating. Another thing that's annoying as hell and really damn common is people new to the game crying about nerfs to things. Itd be like you complaining "x killer is op he needs nerfs"  like dude how would you even know. You're brand new lmao. That gets on my nerves too. Other than that if you can ignore the teabaggers and "ggez" your fine.
---
Anything that can occur in a match without the aid of cheats or violation of the rules fits within the parameters of standard gameplay. A survivor conceding defeat and dying on hook is standard gameplay, as opposed to disconnecting, which is explicitly stated to be against the rules, and thusly is not a viable option within the parameters of standard gameplay
---
*In Plankton's voice* "TOO LATE"
---
Not really. You should not be punished in a 1vs1 for what your teammates did. I understand that the whole outcome should depend on what my teammates did. 
---
Imagine if according to some gameplay mechanic in a team-bases shooter, your opponent gets to kill you with just one bullet because of what your teammates did. Yeah. That's ridiculous
---
I tried to get some hydrazine. Toxic.

no

Check out Not otzdarva on YT, Twitch
---
If they try and 360 I just don't swing until they get stuck on me and lose all their speed.
---
Just don't be nice after a DC. Im a survivor main who plays like 20% killer. In a (killer)match a guy disconnected when he was gonna die on hook anyways. After the endgame chat people got angry i wasn't nice to them. Some people will always complain. Its not your job to be nice after a DC or at all.
---
As previously stated, having above average tracking in his kit doesn’t make him OP, and if we’re basing balance on ultra-rare add ons, most of the killer roster would need a nerf, because those bitches are usually busted af.
---
Not true, survs know when he’s using portals but not where he’s going, so they’ll be on guard. Makes a loud screech I believe. And the killer instinct is almost useless except to see if someone’s cleansing a portal.
---
Why weren't they bleeding out though
---
Been playing for 3 years - genuinely never happened to me.
---
Yeah it is true it's not my job to do that but if it makes them comfortable I'll try to be nice while playing. Some just want an easy win with an easy excuse
---
You don’t have to improve anything it’s a fucking masterpiece when’s the next one
---
There's no way I would stay for any longer than like 10 minutes as the killer in this situation lmao
---
Put on fixated 🤙
---
Even if it was 2 hours of dev time =&gt; thats still time lost on them being Good bois trying to Squash those bugs
---
The only thing i would consider toxic is t-bagging for survivors and face camping for killers. But to be honest the concept of being toxic is dumb.
---
YOU CLICKED YOUR FLASHLIGHT THREE TIMES IN MY GAME?!?! REPORTED -REP
---
buy a hwid spoofer and make a new account EAC will never unban you
---
Ah, the classic loud sounds of the hatch coming from the left, so the player turns right, straight into the killer's arms.
---
Mori combo animation!
---
Very similar to the comments I get playing Doc. I mean I play him for fun cause seriously how can you not LOVE his giggle? Such a jolly ol' guy. But nope, keep getting comments like "L2P" or "Uninstall if you play Doc"
---
Lol my only complaint is the killer I thought would be the coolest ever is actually kind of lame.. huge “the strangers” fan, so legion was my first dlc i bought.. its not really a complaint, because it doesn’t compromise my fun with the game. But if a dev randomly asked me what I’d like, thatd be it.. i just think there’s so much potential with legion, since its technically 4 different killers in one.. some kind of power that could play to that would be amazing, but thats gotta be hard to optimize and balance properly. Still.. love me some legion

Many red rank players never heal anyway. You can loop the killer for ages when injured if you know the map well, don't fall for mind-games and have the right pallets around.

NOED is strong because it makes the killer unloopable

Bind struggle to your mouse scroll wheel

Fuck yeah, finally PGtW. I'd been wanting it for a while to slap on Freddy, but playing Clown in red ranks is about as engaging and fun as gouging out your eyes, so i sure as fuck wasn't gonna level him to 40. If we could get Nurse's Calling or M&amp;A soon too, that would be amazing.
---
I want to try the old Freddy out tbg
---
Like i said in the title, these aren’t the best per se.. just what I’ve personally had the most trouble winning against in my first month with the game. Low rank huntresses and billys aren’t very good, at least not in my experience
---
true I noticed that as well
---
His camouflage game is just too strong.
---
That's explain a lot. For me it's easy to play against her. Just crouch near when u come near to hook, and place like pallets or windows. I never have problems with Hag, but it's your opinion so I respect it.
---
Lmao implying this game was playable in the first place. That's cute.
---
Too weak, needs another buff
---
Good to know what specific amd card you have right now?

I usually skip on year end releases and download drivers by January.

Bet u use “entitled survivor” as an argument
---
1. That’s your problem

2. You definitely deserved it
---
3. What’s the point of putting up a ban if someone can find a way around it, you lost your win money thinking you where safe and refer back to number 1.
---
I'm not even a killer main, look at my flair.
---
Even if it's one escape, it was a free escape. Literally did nothing for that escape except for bringing an item that allowed it. Mori's are the exact same in that regard. Bring a Mori for free kills, bring a key for free escapes.
---
A 'joke' you find funny can be someone's current painful hellscape. Be better.
---
Why am I downvoted...
---
This feature along with some sort of buff to killers would actually make a lot of sense.
---
Me watching this video "O... Oh... oh god why"
---
The “I will beat your ass” comments are funny and very laughable.
---
Yes because this is the most important issue in the game right now when there are actual bugs that hinder gameplay /s
---
the only good one is pop tbh
---
Uhuh
---
First chase of a game? There were two gens left when it started. Also with so many pallets available, better waste a few (even tho early drops granted her a few loops too) and keep the team working on the gen and the killer occupied. Tf are you talking about?
---
So, I don't do a lot of Dead By Daylight community stuff, but I'm a Wraith/Trapper main, pretty casual player. So when youtube spat out Otz video to me, I was like 'Oh, is there like a super cool new wraith build?'
---
No. It is literally my exact build for Wraith, I just don't lean on Coxcomb as much. Ruin to slow the game down a bit, Sloppy Butcher to bring it to a crawl. Find someone, jump them, get the hit, coax them into dropping a pallet if one is nearby, then bail. Stealth, circle the map, find someone new. Repeat.
---
Between Ruin and Sloppy, nothing is getting done quickly. Just keep the pressure on, don't get drawn into long chases and you will grind people out. I had no idea I was doing some super secret tec that I figured just made sense.
---
But did you t bag
---
Thanks to this post, I’ve learned that flashlights and crouching work against her traps.. i had no idea before and i assume most of my survivor teammates had no clue either lol. So hag might not give me much trouble from here on, but that dang hex ruin still stalls out the games early stages for me..
---
Classic Survivor main, if someone doesn’t agree with them they just assume they are killer mains.
---
And that doesn't even factor the fact that I one I used and the killer closes the hatch, all the gens automatically finished and the endgame starts. A solo player with a key can potentially let everyone out the doors by using it.
---
If this happens to me or I can tell it’s swf I just got extremely try hard and switch my perks to Franklins, NOED, Bitter mur, and ruin
---
If somone is a survivor main they understand how annoying it is to get a killer that dc’s after 10min of looking for a match
---
I would teabag and run in circles for a bit. Gotta pit up a show, you know.
---
Unhook 50 Survivor....
---
Happy cake day. Go fuck yourself
---
I don't think people are saying that he's powerful. Just when you use the good build. I think everyone knows his base kit is super weak.
---
Cause you can be an immersed baby leech and be rewarded by it but a killer actually requires you play the game.
---
It is valid, but is also toxic, as you are not allowing a survivor to even be able to play the game, most likely making him just DC/suicide on hook and just proceed to another match, yeah, the rest of the survivors are most likely (if they know the killer is camping) gonna do gens and escape, but the camped survivor gets rightfully frustrated, as there is no good option for unhooking a camped survivor (other than BT, if the killer doesn't interrupt while unhooking)
---
Literally me today, I forgot I queued and my friend called, 10 minutes into the call I load into a lobby. Fidnt have my headset or anything near me. Almost had a heart attack. (As a killer)

Reddit hivemind got me too haha.
---
I've even played slightly more Survivor since getting my friend into the game. I deranked my Survivor from 4 to 16 after this stupid "highest rank in the swf" change dictating the rank you queue at. (No I wasn't dc'ing immediately or using object and finding the killer immediately, or bullying low rank killers)
---
You need a merciless victory which is 2 pips in one game.
---
Or they don't like unfunny and overused jokes lmao
---
If someone's a killer main they understand how annoying it is to get survivors that never ready up or switch when the timer is at 6 seconds or all run toolboxes, or just straight up leave and make everyone have to wait more.
---
There will always be bugs in a game like this, but obvious bugs with a 100% reproduction rate shouldn't be in a game for over 16 (!) months.
---
I see nothing wrong with your match making. Mine seems to be the one that’s broken.
---
Lol at least they get a chance of playing
---
I usually franklins when I see multiple items and ruin if it's multiple toolboxes, otherwise I haven't used ruin in 2 rank resets.
---
To expand, pallet stuns end the corrupt purge immediately. So if she just got corruption and you drop a pallet on her, she loses it straight away. 
---
On the contrary, Head On and Decisive strike stuns **do not** end her corrupt purge.
---
Why don’t you use ruin? I feel like it’s needed
---
Dbd is a 4v1 game. Meaning that you are approximately 25% of the total "team strength" as one of the survivors.
---
The killer has no teammates which means that he is the entire 100% of his "team strength".
---
A 1v1 in dbd should not be balanced whatsoever simply because it's not made to be. You need your teammates to perform well if you want to survive. Because if they don't help you, the killer is just too strong for you to handle alone.
---
And your example from before in shooters doesn't add up either. Teammates already are able to do that for you. They could give you a wrong callout which causes you to look the wrong way and get killed. Or they could accidentally shoot you which leaves you more vulnerable to dying than your opponent.
---
I always love the "it's people like you that are making people leave this game/community" arguement. The people who usually make this arguement are usually not able to spot the hypocrisy that they are saying this in a deeply hateful or insulting post game message, against another player who is just trying to enjoy themselves and have a good game.
---
Idk sounds to me like you got bodied by a bunch of rank 15s and came to complain here. Go write in your diary or something why say shit like this here...
---
in certain situations, not killing yourself by trying to unhook the teamate is the only think that you can do to save the day. We all know how it ends when there is only 2 survivors left with one of them hooked.
---
Ya well same same if survivors could not be toxic pricks and leave or bait the killer to play and change at the last sec.
---
I don't use ruin because it's rng and when I have been playing Survivor with my friend when he's starting out the amount of fucking ruins annoy me, I basically go to a gen, they mention if there's a ruin or I see it and then I go to check the whole map of spawns. On killer I use BBQ, Thrilling Tremors, Pop and whatever other perk depending on killer for the most part. A good ruin replacement would be corrupt intervention (2 minutes where the far gens are closed) or thrilling tremors, if you force them off a gen and pop it or surge it or just kick it normally and then have thrilling tremors close it they can't do anything for 16 seconds. I play around the cooldown so if it's about to be off cooldown I drop someone near the hook and then pick them up or I just wait to pick them up initially. Thrilling tremors alone won me a game on "The game" as wraith after letting them finish 4 generators when I only used yellow add-ons.
---
I had that exact scenario happen to me recently. In red ranks.
---
not on switch
---
Why are you so mean to him?
---
You sounds dumb. This isn't any kind of constructive add on to the discussion. I'm at rank 8 and the most of the survivors I go up against are between green and red ranks. Being assumptious is never a good option and just makes you look like a cool, much thing the assumptious survivers I'm talking about in my post.
---
Toxic is the purposeful harm of another individual without a high objective.
---
If I camp because I know there's one person left, all 3 gens are around the hook and so is the hatch, that's not toxic that's the objective.
---
If I teabag or flashlight click to get the killer's attention to get them to chase me instead of my wounded survivor teammate, that's not toxic that's a distraction.
---
If I tunnel to turn the game into a 3v1 instead of a 4v1 because gens are getting done and I need to slow things down by removing someone, that's not toxic, that's the most efficient way of winning in that situation.
---
Playing the game is not toxic.
---
While old freddy was pretty weak, I actually enjoyed playing him quite a lot honestly.
---
On Xbox it used to take FOREVER to play killer and instant queues for survivor. Ever since archives came out they switched places. Super annoying
---
Sounds like over exaggerating to me unless this includes god loops, strong loops (pig tree into jungle gym into etc), and people tbagging at pallets which is understandable why someone might call it annoying, toxic or bad game mechanics but I doubt anyone below rank 15 with decent time un-ironically calls normal looping and using pallets toxic, at least to the level where it's a huge thing.
---

Yea,most people in this game are pretty rude. I've made some friends while playing including a red rank who cringes at my perk lineup. Everyone should just do whats best for them, because not everyone plays the same. If every killer ran the same perks, I doubt the game would be much fun.

I left for 2 times coz i know its gonna suck but everyone keeps running to there and if i can keep bloodlust someone come take a hit and abuse the loop again. Making my perks pop and bbq useless as i cant down and since they dont need pallets my spirit fury enduring is useless too.
---
Ha
---
Realm hooks used to be linked to the killer. So the autohaven wreckers hooks would spawn in any map if Wraith was the killer, for example. They patched it out because you could just look at the hook at the start of the match and know who the killer is.

I’ve stopped playing killer as much because of the wait times and I play on Xbox... maybe it’s a region issue?

Really? I play on both ps4 and pc, I don't find it terribly different. Only killer I refuse to play on ps4 is huntress. I dont play on pc much either, but at least on pc I'll do her dailies if it comes up.

Iridescent is a way of reflecting light where the color changes based on where your viewing it from.  They probably just use iridescent to mean from the entity though.

Both are good for different ways I prefer ghostface but I also love playing legion, it's even for me.
---
I put it in all caps so people would see it as soon as they opened my post. Also, I always break shack pallet as soon as it's dropped.
---
This reminds of 72hrs escaping at 5 gens while falling through the map several times, teleporting back to surface a couple of meters in advance of his original location.
---
Leatherface is not weak at all, with Nemesis PWYF its absolutely amazing
---
nice joke lol
---
I think Distortion should block all survivors auras within a small radius of you. Kind of like Street Wise and Vigil do. Makes it slightly more useful and stops it from wasting a token to Nurses.
---
I would also like if it was a timed thing instead of stacks. Like Yui's bleeding perk. When your aura is revealed it counts down until you're not and then it pauses. Make it something like 15-20 seconds.
---
Is PGTW still worth it for someone who already has Ruin and Overcharge unlocked? I know it's good, but it seems redundant.

Why the f cant these bugs happen to me lmao

More like "dOn'T tEaBaG aT tHe eXiT gAtEs" with a clip of a killer downing and picking them up just before they could crawl out. I think I've seen that 10 times just this week.

And if you aren't Obsession, 1500 extra survival points for escaping alive as Obsession.
---
Rework Huntress's lullaby. Make it a non hex perk, but make it loose a token once in a while, but still decreace time between sound and a skill check and increasing penalty for failing. Ut would be something viable

Does Sony comms ban, or fully ban for the 3 days?

ghostface is stronger, more fun, and has better perks.

The real question is what will happen when we get to the first Licenced Tomb? 
---
Will there be one, and if so, will the Killer/Survivor be available for the duration of the tomb?
---
Yeah :) if they’re not bming I appreciate it. As a surv I do this too, let them get a hit if they struggled or wait there to make sure the rest of my team is out. It’s hard to remember when you’re sad because you got destroyed 😭
---
Yeah I have empathy for that reason, I’m gonna work on getting bond so that I can see when they’re actually being chased and not just injured.
---
Is that RICH EVANS? The killer from the Ellen DeGeneres show??????¿
---
I am pretty confident in any killer, what do you play? (I can help you regardless if you own good perks or not).
---
I have been that survivor twice, wasn't his fault. Apparently he is stuck there too he can not move anymore and i guess being that close to gate he thought he deserved escape.
---
You both were holding the game hostage by not DC'ing
---
Ok, general protip for life: If the other guy gets mad but you don't, and you're enjoying it, you're being a douchebag
---
I feel you. I am usually a good sport when it comes to playing games because... you know, it's a game, you're supposed to have fun while playing it. But whenever I play nurse for my dailies, I legitimately wanna break down and cry because how painful it is.
---
This reminds me of the time I got comm’ed ban for the time I told a camping killer that he was the cum shot his mother should have swallowed. 
---
A lot of people can’t take the heat when it’s on the other side. I don’t report messages, unless it’s like a threat, but I’m reported all the time lol. People have very fragile egos.
---
Pretty sure the problem isn't the hitboxes. It's the delay from the killers actions to the dedicated server and your actions to the dedicated server. The reason it's got worse is just because of that, dedicated servers.
---
Hit boxes are boxes around the character mesh's, they are fine.
---
David king is free survivors just level him up
---
turn her about 180°, problem solved
---
Is actually doable when combined with tenacity
---
I can't tell if this is a rant but its flair is discussion what is there to discuss? A incessantly rude post? 
---
If survivors wanna ask questions let them u don't need to see if bc u can mute chat if it annoys u how people talk well ur just shooting urself in the foot here by not muting it.
---
Muting is a amazing feature that deals with every problem u have with another person on the internet
---
I tried it last night and I'm pretty sure yeah Inner Strength does work, which is cool. Yeah Empathy is pretty much a requirement for this challenge!
---
Almost done with Tier 3 of the Tome now, just got to do this 'escape without being hooked'. Gonna grab my key and blend myself to safety!
---
did you try reading the actual post?
---
I had forgotten to add an addon to the red, so I couldn't do anything with it, and i died before the hatch spawned.
---
Flip Fire up so you get the maximum speed bonus at the beginning of the match but slowly lose it as generators are being complete. That or make it reach the max bonus at around 3 or 2 gens being left. 
---
Beast Of Prey - Allow for it to be activated during a chase for around 10 to 20 seconds with a cool-down in between activation. Cool-down could be something like 15 or 20 seconds. Decent survivors will know to avoid BL and as such will usually throw pallets down when BL begins to activate, nullifying this perk.
---
Monstrous Shrine: Make 2 basements spawn instead of just one or perhaps apply a status effect while entering the basement such as exhaustion or hindered to make it more difficult to escape.
---
Furtive Chase: Perhaps have the stacks add extra effects for each token you earn. For example removing the sound of pallet breaking at 2 or faster window entity blocking at 3 stacks. That or have the T.R reduction apply outside of a chase to make it a more potent M&amp;A that requires stacks.
---
I can see why Empathy has returned (Archives challenges, after all- not everyone wants to level Claudette, so this is a good alternative).
---
Did you just? Toxic.
---
gotta pay the troll toll
---
Could this also be on r/ExpandDong? Nive meme.
---
Just gotta do 4 more.
---
Escape 2 more times, heal 10 times, 15 iri emblems and 4 obsession kills
---
I like how it is now tbh he just needs a few more tweaks and he’ll be average. I’d also like to reduce his stun time on the missed swing, you shouldn’t be punished that severely for using your power.
---
Contact the support of MS Store and tell them the story that you never cheated on the MS Store based game. Also say you want a refund because it has nothing to do with the MS Store
---
If I see 4 survivors especially 4 clauds all p3 with flashlights or medkits I'm going to lobby dodge stop crying about it there is a leave button for a reason. 
---
Besdies I just wanna play for fun and not against people I think are going to sweat out their ass and I know there is a difference from being sweaty and playing effectively but oh wait when killers play effectively survivors bitch about it bc apparently that's not okay but it's fine when survivors use loops effectively body block to take hits and such.
---
I suggest we all just stop moaning about it and play the fucking game
---
This will never happen!
---
We cant have bigger or taller killer because this would create too many collision problems in each map. The killer would get stuck in many places!
---
Also Behaviour can barely manage to design and release one killer without breaking their own game, imagine if they try to do something complex like that.
---
Not the survivors fault either that they have trash teammates. At least killers can win the game and more or less guarantee the win if they play well. Survivors who are good still have to rely on their teammates to either go save, do objectives and find totems or distract the killer and there are a lot of times where there's only one or two players out of the four who are trying to win while the others urban evasion around the map.
---
I only have 1 left and I thought level 4 would be released yesterday
---
Well P2P was unplayable for me if I wanted to play survivor. Only things dedicated servers has done for me that is negative is made trapper a bit more annoying to play as.
---
But dedicated servers have made me actually enjoy survivor and my opinion hasn't changed about killers.
---
Fuck P2P in any PvP game
---
Don’t let it bother you. People that talk trash like that have nothing better to do and are just insecure.
---
Oh they did
---
Pick different skin 😐
---
Ikr when the fuck was P2P better
---
Lol
---
Good point
---
I’ve been playing Trapper as a killer. Wanting to purchase one now. Tossing up between Ghost Face, Freddy and Leatherface. Which ones the more fun/better to play?
---
Nope its like leatherface, it keeps hitting when going up and down
---
I love the fine print Haha
---
Ahah. This is so true. *inside pain intensifies*
---
Ah yes i do NOT like gen rushing 🙃
---
I’d (personally) take Discordance over Thrilling 80% of the time but yea, both are good
---
you cant turn more than 60° (thats what it looks like to me) on console which makes some instances not as good as they would be on pc
---
Indeed i think he’s fine it’s just everyone says he’s op when you post a video like this
---
That the point i cant play because ppl keep dcing 
---
And any killer that plays respectably gets a gg from me even if i die first, or he/she gets a 4k is a gg wp and ill gladly have a chat 
---
But i do agree if we could all just play the mf game and get along it would be alot more fun
---
Damn survivors doing their only objective, how dare they.
---
I didn't until they had loaded in and I saw them tbagging in the distance. I brought the mori as a precaution. If they weren't as coordinated I wouldn't have used it
---
My experience playing dedicated servers is that when something bs happens the bs is worse then p2p but it happens less often then on p2p for example. As survivor I have fast vaulted a window landed on the other side of window had lithe activate started running then I suddenly went from running to lying on the floor directly below the window. Ive also been picked up vaulting whilst the killer should have been lunging to hit me. But these are rare for me where as on p2p it was at least once a day I would be hit when the killer wasn't shouldn't have been able to (them almost teleporting to me)
---
When you know they do it just walk backwards. They will end up in front of you.
---
No it’s not
---
Bill: What happens now?
---
Yui: Now? Haha. Let's go practice looping
---
Fun Is subjective. Each killer has their own different playstyle.
---
Ghost Face is the most fun out of all stealth killers and also quite strong. Also very good choice for beginning killers.
---
Freddy is just OP, there are some nasty builds you can do with him and his kit is very versatile. In chases he is a better Clown since his Dream Snares do the same thing as the Afterpiece Tonic, just way better. He is also able to pressure gens directly with his teleport. Not as easy to play though.
---
Leatherface is one of the worst killers, but still enjoyable. The only thing he brings to the table is his insta down. However, I‘d get him just for BBQ&amp;Chili in case you don‘t have it already.
---
This is very fair I can agree I've seen more dumb shit on dedicated servers but I figured this is bc the game now has to take into account the killers ping. However personally P2P on say days was impossible to play as survivor.
---
But I thank u for sharing it's important that there is a actual discussion about this rather than rants that just lead to name calling
---
Can you read? Players DC’ing during the loading screen.
---
Leather really isn’t as weak as people think.
---
Playing killer I've had some bs where I have grabbed survivors that should have been a hit on dedicated. But since the servers I haven't been called a lag switcher I had a week long period where whenever I picked killer my lobby was laggy ppl standing still on my screen them complaining they got teleported across the map. 
---
TL:DR dumb stuff that shouldn't happen, happens less in my experience on dedicated then p2p however the times when the bs happens are often worse (as survivor for me)
---
It should appear in every next Bloodweb until you purchase it yes.
---
The biggest disadvantage as a killer I am feeling is those blank grab animation. In p2p even if latency made me miss grabs, I would still end with a hit, which was still fair.
---
Now I go in grab, almost pick the surv and then she/he is galavanting away while I take a second to realise what happened. That cost precious time, more if that said surv has sprint burst. They need to fix that for dedicated servers.
---
While as a survivor, the shitty internet killer was a 1 in 10 games thing. I was okay with that, also when you go in game, you knew what ping you were playing most of the time, so that would tell me how much distance between me and killer is safe. Now its a lottery, every game, every fricking game.
---
So ur moring ppl for being good at the game? 
---
Lol alright
---
But fair if theyre toxic and tbagging then hell yea go for it
---
Respectfubly is not playing effectively sometimes playing dirty is ur only option and sometimes u just wanna win games meaning u have no mercy but I think people are at the point they expect both sides to think about how they play so everyone can enjoy it but personally this should be up to the game to fix. 
---
But I don't care anymore I have my chat muted 24/7
---
Omfg 4 slowdown perks 😂😂😂😂 geez what gamers
---
Some killers will kill you on the spot. Some like this Huntress I faced will carry you on her back for a while looking for the hatch on Blackwater swamp
---
Feng Min lied about being Chinese, she's actually Thai
---
No
---
Long , very long, and i dont even have the killer teachables
---
Nightmare better thoe
---
Use head on
---
They're next in line for add-on changed after Doctor's changes, especially Bubba
---
Ds should have an infinite duration, but disabled if another survivor is downed / hooked. Then its not a crutch perk and a true anti tunnel perk. Maybe op but 
---
:3
---
i spent well over 1m bloodpoints to get adrenaline for my claud, on top of already spending like 800k on meg to even unlock it. so about 5 weeks for me
---
damn increases vault speed now, 70%?
---
SB?
---
Like, litteraly
---
Hey, I remember making this like 2 years ago, holy shit someone found it!
---
I can agree that there is some bs that happens for killers now personally the only problems I been having is trappers traps being a bit delayed to walk over after placing them. 
---
But for survivor aside from the random hits a few meters away from windows that I can feel is bs. I have been enjoying it.
---
 BHVR knows that everyone is not having the same fun I think this is amplified bc now killers are experiencing more bs then we used to from when we where the hosts.
---
I might not be a programmer but I think this would be fixable but I guess the question is about how long until almost everyone can enjoy it and we can say goodbye to hits that we can see are dumb.
---
But I thank u for sharing
---
No I'm moring the Object of Obsession so Trapper doesn't become a m1 killer
---
Then jump over and get grabbed
---
Its hard to have gen pressure going when you prioritize going back to the hook even when you have pop procc'd which you didnt even use
---
Claudettes silhouette looming in the background is creepy
---
The trapper bug glitch thing is easy to counter through just wait 1 or 2 seconds after placing a trap and u can walk over it annoying but at least u can do something about it.
---
I have faith in BHVR they want to do good even though a good part of the community doesn't trust them anymore which is more than fair
---
Yeah cuz if you bring the pc community into this, its gonna be war. Pure, Bloody, Ravenous WAR.
---
Higher tickrates won't fix their shitty netcode. It's like saying dedicated servers fix bad gameplay caused by killer connection issues. (Which they perfectly do now.. LOL)
---
Change it so killer can Mori someone only after everyone was hooked at least once. It would encourage killers to actually play a game and not tunnel hooked person
---
I usually just stop moving and reverse slightly as they try to 360. The way you get done by it is the forward momentum.
---
I never said it's toxic I said it's dumb
---
2...
---
Lol true but a killer dosent have to face camp to be effective 🤣
---
Is there any difference from regular dbd?
---
No but sometimes u have to tunnel bc that person is dead making them get out of the game which gives the killer more control
---
That's why I stopped playing DbD on PS4. It was too toxic. Almost every match I played as killer I got a 4 stack spamming flash lights or gen rushing. Obviously that isn't bad but whenever I'd kill one ir even chase I'd get messages from them calling me trash and an idiot. I also got invited to a party once where all 4 were claiming I was bad because I camped the exits. Like, what am I supposed to do?
---
I haven't seen anything about it in the patch notes so yea probably
---
And by tunnelling I mean intentionally going after one survivor even if he healed and u see someone injured.
---
love the contrast between her cotton candy hair and the grungy earthy tones of her clothes. i don’t even play legion but id drop money on this in a heartbeat if it were a cosmetic. ur art style is REALLY cute btw &lt;3
---
bruh just be rich like me  
---
/s
---
BHVR never finds a middle ground for anything, they usually just nerf it until it's barely useable.
---
“Just look at me. It’ll be over soon.”
---
Just reminding anyone who will listen that angry rant posts drag the subreddit down. They're in no way interesting or funny. They have no value. Keep the subreddit above the toxicity we claim to hate.
---
Pretty good job
---
Why?
---
Usually if u get to the point u face camp someone he isn't really mad he just laugh at u cuz u salty.
---
But this is just being a peace of shit.
---
But killers' FOV is goddamn awful tbh
---
Its easier to change a perk then it is to rework entire maps. Keeping the staggerless fall creates alot of infinites still, it would need to be DWM level of CD to be fair.
---
Windows of opportunity
---
Oh derp, thought you were listing off the killers this one shares similarities too (just woke up). I included doctor. But ghostface and oni have different themes and aesthetic that distinguish them, but this guy is just a psycho? That takes abilities from four different killers already? I feel like more creativity can be used here.
---
Nightmare edition just came out so if you bought it recently it may of just upgraded the game edition for you.
---
This is why when I play killer, I make sure to go after the people who unhooked, because it's really no fun to be off and on the hook over and over. Plus it's a lot more satisfying to sacrifice bullies.
---
ok but where’s the guidebook though
---
Yeah, I guess it's not camping
---
idk i love watching videos of the fuck you killer build deliverance DS unbreakable tenacity
---
👁3
---
*LAUGHS IN FREDDY MAIN*
---
What actually happened is he downed david in the doorway on his screen, so he was looking on the ground to find him. People will often teleport after you down them, to the spot they were in on their screen
---
“Ok boomer”
---
I seem to get a lot as pc Plague on low, with incredibly low resolution too, mostly at very inconvenient times, or after a pallet stun, sometimes killing my game entirely.
---
I find that when I play it’s the time of day that affects the rank of survivors I’m matched against but it’s still sometimes super unfair
---
IIRC they said during the challenges the shrine would have all related perks needed for the archive and people said "so you need 8k shards in 1 week xd" so this may of been the fix, just keep rotating the perks throughout the archive cycle.
---
I would buff hangmans trick. Hooks allready respawns and this perk is only "slightly" useful for a trapper against a sabo squad (which is almost non existing now). This change will make the perk fit her torture style more, and even make it viable on multiple killers.
---
Suggestion:
---
"Your ingenious modifications to Hooks are filled with nasty surprices. Hooked survivors are afflicted by the deep wounds status effect. After mending, the survivor has 25% chance (per status effect: 1 negative status effect guarantied) to receiving a debuff status effect for 30 / 45 / 60 seconds. "No excuses, no equivocations... No crying." — Amanda Young"
---
200 IQ right there. Bet you’ve caused some people to shit themselves.
---
2 months is basically just here in rotation terms though.
---
God that episode was *The* best
---
tbagging as a concept is literally putting your dick in their (usually deceased) body by telling them to get fucked and they suck.
---
I feel like there should be something in place that makes it so that no matter how much the game needs players, they can’t match ranks like this. 4 reds against a green is ludicrous
---
When you vault through a window and think you're clear but they stretch their arm to hit you.
---
Scenario: Survivor just got unhooked and is dumb enough to run right into me so I down him but he has ds. If I pick him up, he's just gonna get away and if I eventually down him, I would be accused of being a tunneler. Other option: I slug him for a minute, which is shit for both survivor and killer. Then I would be accused for not only tunneling but also slugging.
---
Not broken at all.
---
when will people stop reposting this?
---
This is the most wholesome reply  I've seen so far about gen rushing
---
I really was hoping for Ruin. I get genrushed every game -\_-
---
If you down people quick and want information, thrilling is literally better in every case. If you pick up a survivor, all gens are white except the ones being worked on so you know where they are and where  to go, its a ghetto bbq, and it has the added benefit of blocking gens they were about to get on too.
---
T bagging is about as toxic as it gets, like someone else said, you’re literally dipping your balls on their face, it’s bad manners. But then again do what you want, just don’t be upset if the killer has a staring party with you on the hook.
---
I've had such bullshit moments with window hitboxes. I'll vault a window and be at least 6 feet away and get hit still. It's probably just desync but it drives me up a fucking wall.
---
She was BMing so it’s kinda karma
---
It's disgusting tbh
---
The more they focus on Oni, the more they stray away from the real problem character... Trapper.
---
Seriously traps that hurt you? That's OP
---
So now we either have A) Wait 10 minutes for a laggy killer lobby, or B) Play killer on 2 frames per second.  
---
  
---
On a seperate note, Oni is practically unplayable on certain maps just because of the frame drops from orbs. Really makes me not want to play the game.
---
He looks so cute with the sweater I cant kill him
---
Yet you’re still here
---
FUUMMMMMMMMMMMM
---
It's called bad luck
---
How do? I was under the impression after level 50 you get 4 perks in the bloodweb? I don’t think luck has anything to do with this?
---
But I can get tunneled and can’t do anything the whole game but me tapping my crouch button a couple times is a problem. Killers can take you out the game by tunneling you or face camping without a problem. T bagging ain’t that big to me y’all just gotta chill.
---
This is the state of the game now.
---
Funky Mode? Man I havent had internet for a month and a new killer gets released, Spirit gets nerfed and they added Funky Mode
---
Its no diffrent than showboating or taunting someone needlessly
---
#noskillneeded
---
It works the same, you can go a whole game without tbagging, and the killer can go a whole game without camping. It’s a choice.
---
But that’s in every game. This community acts like it’s a crime to humanity.
---
I think i was the killer in your game, was the killer name Drghast?
---
Can I borrow the meme and post it on another subreddit?
---
I get what you’re saying
---
Where? It always takes me 5+ minutes to find a lobby as a killer on xbox. Im rank 6
---
Epic.
---
I just wanna thank y’all for being civil and not complete assholes
---
Like they banned all those killers who ran IG and Agitation when Basement hooks were glitched out? /s
---
You: But Mr. Cote, I'm nothing without my Exhaustion Perks!
---
Mathieu Cote: If you're nothing without those perks, you shouldn't have them.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel's the best one out of the bunch.
---
*kyah! david- kun!*
---
Me ;)
---
It’s impolite because the killer probably tried their best but you t-bagging just puts them down even more.
---
P.S you probably main Claudette
---
The nerf made it better. Yeah you only get the 75% stagger reduction when not exhausted but the new passive is you make no sound when falling which is actually really good against killers with ears and it was a much needed sound reduction.
---
Funny. I've been rank 1 killer for quite a lot of resets and yet I've never gotten written backlash. I'm not pointing the finger at you, but it may have been something you did. 
---
Worse comes to worse, just turn off messages from people you dont know if it was that much of an issue. 
---
Also, gen rushing? You mean, doing gens as fast as possible to escape? As in, you know, the only thing survivors are expected/supposed to do? Heavensforbid the thought. &gt;_&gt;;
---
I don’t know the sensitivity difference is astronomical from what I can tell
---
I can imagine the entity facepalming after looking at this killer wearing oven mitts and letting survivors do the gens.
---
Just an FYI since I don't know the last time you played but 2 patches ago they removed 5 blink nurse. Now the max is a 3 blink.
---
You are the one sticking your assholish attitude in other people's mud. I wasnt the one who asked your bs comment.
---
Nah bro bloody Steve for a reason
---
I've had a bad stretch of games over the last day. I've had insidious camping bubba's, I've had cloaked camping Wraiths, I had a camping Myers, I had a legion that downed me but left me and I got to watch all three of my teammates work on gens for the next two minutes while I bled, finally when one of them got their hex gen done they came to save me but it was too late. The next game I had two bills unhook me in front of the killer. I was all ready for that sweet BT to get away, only to find out neither Bill had BT, Myers camped again. I've had so many survivors unhooking each other right in front of the killer so the killer has already hooked each of them once at the start of the game. Its infuriating and makes me swear off of playing the game. This game can be the ultimate team work game but I really don't understand why rank 6 players are playing like that. I guess they are either fucking off or they were boosted.
---
Bloody Steve for a reason
---
You are so right
---
The only tracking he has without perks are orbs that don't highlight until they are in your asshole.
---
I once spent like 5 minutes on huntress to give hatch. It spawned in corner. I didnt know that hatch can spawn that deep in corner.
---
Eh I disagree but then again i am always on the receiving end never the giving end so
---
There should be a risk to waiting inside the gate like the entity having a higher probability to snatch you if you linger just past the gate for more than 3 seconds
---
My team mates always do this to me, sadly they either get the hatch or the killer lets the Claudette go.
---
Lol fair enough
---
Yo wtf are these survivor perks?
---
Last shrine was decent, I should of got adrenaline on the last shrine instead of waiting for this shit.
---
Lawsuit ends in june 2020,  but I asked him if he could be released sooner, but as you can see, we’ll have to wait until mid 2020
---
Personally i think both keys and mori's should be removed. They are both a way to cheat a victory.
---
Lol same I got a piggy back for a while knowing if I struggled I died eventually she let me do Gens and power the door when she couldn’t find it
---
Some challenges require you to kill all.
---
Or they just die instantly leaving you in a 1v5 and then vote to kick you because you didn't clutch when they reinforced between objectives while also not reinforcing outside walls.
---
its just legion with extra steps
---
Suicide is badass doesn’t sound too bad ngl
---
Oh flick aim? It's definitely a thing xD need to max out your sensitivity and move yourself and the camera differently to manipulate it to get it right. His charge hit is wonky to aim regardless of what platform though, that's about learning how long to hold it for. You can actually let go after about 1.5 seconds or so and get the slam attack. You can also hold it longer to aim/whatever, but that's what makes it feel so weird.
---
Then it’s fine,if you t bag for 3 seconds then leave once the killer shows up then I don’t see the problem with it’s just for fun
---
Did you do a gen that's toxic. Where you not 2 kilometers away from the hook that's toxic.
---
That... Actually sounds really good. This is probably one of the best nerfs I've heard to these killers.   
---
(For context I have played no one but oni since his release and even without MaA it's too easy to just run up on someone who was repairing in the wrong neighborhood)
---
If only killers has multiple ways to avoid people getting flashlight saves...
---
My only problem is the awful framerate drops on console. Every single time I try to do my big bonk, my game essentially freezes and then the survivor is all the way behind me.
---
She’s a snowball killer. Once everyone’s sick she will destroy survs or they will cleanse and then it’s gg
---
Try monitor to get closer before survs run, play with ur food for the speed for m1s, ruin (slows game at start) and dying light (takes over when ruin is cleansed)
---
Three situations here
---
1) everyone stays sick. Quick m1s and she snowballs
---
2) some people cleanse. Find the sick survivors and hook them, the non sick ones are forced to get sick again AND u have 1 shot uzi
---
3) everyone cleanses and you have perma one shot uzi
---
Just gotta get the vomit happening early and slow the game down enough to snowball.
---
Everyone should start saving up shards for those chapters then, they're not very expensive
---
I play on PC now, less toxicity.
---
Yeah... THOSE are the people that make the community toxic. Please...
---
What do the audio cues mean when playing against oni? I stg I hear like five different cues and have no idea what any of them mean. (Not talking about chase music, I mean mapwide) thank you!
---
Make them Heely’s and you got yourself a deal
---
Shoulda waited behind the door and confused TF outta people when they opened it to you already there
---
I know, I just love it when people call it that.
---
bro what do you mean, clown is clearly the most op killer in the game. he has aoe slows that are totally unavoidable and it's just like he farts on your controller then nuts in your ear. can't believe the devs designed a character so op
---
So is he not just a better leatherface?
---
I’ve been trying to tell people exactly this. You’re wasting it if u spend time walking to save it.
---
God i really hate ghostface most of all. The rest i can kinda deal with and i never had the doctor bug but just staring at ghostface for what feels like an eternity without being able to reveal him just ruins a match for me.
---
still some ppl gonna be pissed because they didnt bought them for a reason but yeah at least they are cheap
---
Makes sense, its his map afterall
---
I wanna see Quentin's tomb, and also if anyone is going to do it
---
Mad respect to you, can’t have been easy hahaha
---
PS4? If so same here from like the last mid chapter patch, doesn’t happen in any other game that I play

I’m a green rank 11 survivor and the only reason i’m that rank is because my killer queue times are 10+ minutes at the minimum and yet my survivor queue times are 30 seconds to a minute long at most. I realllllyyy wanna play killer sometimes but that wait time isnt worth it especially when 50% of the time after waiting so long and finally getting a match somebody ends up disconnecting during the load up screen and i end up right back in the lobby waiting another 10 min for a match -_- have only managed to make it to rank 17 killer due to queue times.
---
Getting Mettle of Man to activate while running No Mither is better than escaping.
---
I miss him playing this game.
---
Sorry mate im not gunna eat a fat dick just because there may be a 1/1000 chance that 4 solos connected at the same time. Im sorry but if it takes me literally 3 sec to get a new lobby, why would i risk it? I get its upsetting to get dodged as i also play solo survivor but hey if the game was balanced killers wouldnt feel the need to dodge. Also its kind of a bad mentality to say “its in the game so deal with it” because literally everything ever that got nerfed was at one point in the game so...
---
Yeah I’ve run medkits pretty often, but not always. There are a lot of different items that are fun, not to mention a med kit can run out or be Franklin’d.
---
I’m not exactly running Self-Care... I do when my aim is to survive for a goal or challenge though. Too many players just wont heal you (ps4 at least).
---
Also with that in mind, I think the idea of everyone else managing to get hooked while a person is self caring is both bad on the player using self care and also bad if they all go down that quick.
---
I dont think shes supposed to be based on Zoey, but her and Dwight both have skins that are based off the characters from left for dead, but they're not necessarily the actual characters
---
Last night, I was actually waiting for a lobby by shaving my facial hair off.  I got into a game and was over half way done.  XD
---
They try so hard that they “sweat”
---
Learn how to read, I said if the connection issues never happened, I would be able to help my teammates
---
Ok this was a good one.
---
There are way too many god loops still in the game
---
I haven't been sent to the top of the map but a lot of animations take forever and will freeze for me lately
---
Why the hell is this downvoted? If they’re still against the window, you can hit them
---
Well I had two of Ace’s perks. The luck increase one, and the better chest luck one. I do get red and purple keys lots.
---
Yeah, I was wondering why the survivors didn't go into the lockers or hide in the corner.
---
dad... get off reddit.
---
So are Pig players now being generalised to be jerks?
---
I like how the Oni's Kanabo is literally Bubba + Billy chainsaws, all in one. It's a machine gun if you walk right into it. It doesn't matter that he hits the ground with the Kanabo 3 times, it's just like Bubba's crazy frenzy when he hits a wall.
---
why did the survivor have to dc lol? op could’ve easily too. it’s neither of their faults
---
I've been waiting for pgtw for months. I had 9000 shards but I bought the Oni yesterday. Just now it comes out in the store. Fucking hell.
---
I'd disagree that it's balanced, it's just shifted quite a bit. I really dislike this native that were in a good place with most killers 3king on average.
---
People STILL act like you can't play with clown, and continue to act like he's far worse than even demo, but the stats show otherwise. I think he's just kind of boring and no one cares. He's huntress without the instant gratification. When people do play him they don't play very well either, because he's not the simple M1 killer some people make him out to be.
---
Wraith fits that bill too, and he's been slept on for a long time while being completely viable. Shit, people would literally say he was worse than a Freddy you could unhook on top of and teabag and still get away from. So ridiculous. He's a strong killer, he's hard to see and you can't hear shit until he's on you. He makes most gens unsafe and thats HUGE, on top of how fucking fast he gets around.
---
I think most killer mains have viable and top tier (or broken, or over powered...) are somehow completely conflated, and this is a really good example of how off someone like trues thinking is in terms of killers and their viability.
---
If I remember right I think walmart is like 11 or 12/h now :^) wraith can go get Learn't
---
*Killer shows up 15 minutes late with baked goods*
---
Fr when they decide to fix her on console
---
I really can't think of any perks that are OP, just annoying
---
maybe they make prices in Iri Shards cheaper
---
Try to protect 3 gens so in the end is really hard for survivors to finish the last one, since you can easily patrol them.
---
Yeah but when survivors get kidnapped by the entity, their bodies are never found. In L4D2, you clearly see Bill's corpse in The Passing.
---
let's not play when we have a slow connection.
---
Right? The bugs I get make me fall face first onto a hook and die instantly as the killer
---
The challenge that requires you to blink 3 or more (how lol) times with Nurse and grab a survivor is gonna be impossible
---
You know how many times I have been downvoted for saying red rank pigs are the biggest cunts to go against? They are the most consistent assholes I have ran into. I got tunneled all game by one 2 days ago
---
I thought you couldn't lagswitch anymore with DeDIcaTEd sErVErs. Lol
---
Would be cool if they still made tomes with DLC characters, but you can only play them as "Splinter offering" characters. No add-ons, no perks. Would at least give people a trial of the character before deciding to buy it, rather than just forcing them down our throat.
---
Self-care isn't as meta anymore due to the nerfs, BT is probably more meta than it
---
What perks are you missing?
---
That's how they all are. If they ever go back to that way of doing it (I can dream), they'd just switch the universal realm hooks out for personalized hooks on all maps, they wouldn't need to create any extra assets. But they probably won't ever do that because there's more stealth killers than just Mike, which was the initial problem.
---
Bid Dick Energy at its finest
---
I don’t think nightmare on elm street will have a tomb but I’d definitely zip through it, Quentin was my first P3
---
I’m rank 1 survivor and rank 14 killer. I mostly get matched with green/yellow rank survivors when I play killer (though I rarely play killer). I do see a lot of purple rank killers when I play survivor tho. Who knows...
---
Clearly not
---
Honestly it sounds like the whole team was having issues there. If 3 other players got downed that quick- that’s a problem. And if the Dwight is missing skill checks... that’s alarming. 
---
At that point it does sound like the hatch is the only was that team (well one person) was escaping.
---
The plag
---
you'll be hearing from BHVR's laywer
---
NOOOOOOOOO
---
Hey ggs only!
---
I only use “its in the game,deal with it.” Because killers say that about camping, tunneling, moris, no ed and other stuff and yea i get that but this 1/100000 chance happend 3 times out of searching 8 times and out of 8 the killers dced 7 times that spurred this bitch about dc
---
Imagine being so unconfident in your ability to kill survivors that you have to bring NOED with an Ebony Mori though.
---
32
---
I would say give legion a power
---
We’re you watching me last night or something? I did this so many times.
---
Bet your fun. Bet your a survivor main with all the uncommon perks like adrenaline, borrowed time, dead hard. noed isnt even hard to counter.
---
Oh!! Thanks for letting me know, I had no idea hahaha
---
Now if you 99 a gate to counter **blood warden** that's different, because that works. I feel like survivors only 99 gates to stop the EGC tho. Which is why it should start when the last gen pops.
---
Feeling cute might tunnel a survivor cause i like them.
---
I found it time based on my region. SEA btw.
---
On day, killers take 3-7 min for queue time, survivors a bit faster. On night however, I guess SWF groups pop up so killers have faster queue times (less than a minute) while solo survivors are screwed with queue times. Then again, it sucks to play against SWF on night since most of them don't speak English
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
He’s honestly a bit annoying, but is countered by a few things. We’ll Make It makes the blood not spawn after unhooking. Sprint burst makes the first hit harder to get off, and therefor, his power. Thought he does counter iron will fully with his ability to spot blood through walls, which is quite annoying. As long as the survivor isn’t hit in the first place, he’s not much more than an m1 killer, making him viable at low ranks, but not so much at high ranks.
---
They should add something that tells you whos all in a swf in pregame lobby. Would help this out a bit
---
People who complain about gen rushing are complaining about the state of generator speeds. Everyone knows that is the only survivor objective. It isn't that hard to understand.
---
Who hurt you? Lol
---
Should have just said gg ez baby killer after all that to piss him off more
---
Dwight there's generators to be done!
---
I had that happen when the game loaded to quickly and I was eating a buffalo wing. Except I was a survivor so i got hooked real quick.
---
It definitely changes how you view survivors. When I’d never played killer and I would see someone getting tunnelled and camped, I’d think ‘wow this killer is a massive dick’ now, I assume the survivor must have done something to deserve it. Like literally just now I had a plague who tunnelled someone and camped them, they then didn’t do it to anyone else so I think I was right!
---
For once I'd like to know what Nobody thinks, they always give no input
---
killer let him go for sharing his pizza

Is this where Dead by Daylight got its inspiration?

Hmm, well guess the perks should be by default integrated but not interchangeable?
---
I think the splinter thing would only work with Killers though, as they are actually original and they have something going on for every one of them (powers). Survivors are just reskins. Whether it's a Dwight running around or a Nancy, it's the same thing, just different sounds/height...... and for a particular one, a big trunk :)
---
They'll figure something out, anyway, as they always do. It's content, and they'll surely milk it until the end, and as chapters progress, we'll never run out of things to do. That, if they do it right.
---
Hahahaha, me too my friend, me too. I think when the nurse challenges come, in just gonna take the L and not do them. I’ll do what I can on the survivor side but... my mental health is more important than playing nurse ever again 😬
---
Next up reddit news: fire is hot. Stay tuned.
---
Nope, PC can go up to (and over) 90° with his flick and shut down all kinds of loops with it. Console gets 45-60° (being generous), even with the thumbstick flick tech (move the sticks opposite directions, which screws up your positioning anyway and can cause you to miss).
---
That and the frame drops make him worse than he is on PC.
---
I know he has a cue for him having his power ready, activating Blood Fury, blood fury running out and I think there’s one for him bashing a pallet with Demon Dash too but Idk too much.
---
Why did you rage instead of just ignoring a troll?
---
Very good question indeed
---
All killers ? Including DLCs? This can’t be! (I do have all killers but wouldn’t be fair for people who don’t, it’s like pay to earn things that are free🤷🏻‍♂️)

Hes the one who raged not me lol i was the killer

This actually scares me.

It's obviously improved version, check the description

I belive it does but its hard to tell
---
Shit for me, i dont want to play wraith. "As Wraith, surprise 20 people off gens after uncloaking for at least 20seconds
---
Iridescent Family Crest is probably the most pointless add-on in the game.
---
They won't make it that far. I expect wraith and Billy, but that's it.
---
Man dont let these folks bring ya down. Dope tattoo. I'm all for getting things that brings you joy in your life. I got a michael myers tat on my arm that was done for basically free lol. Yours looks alot better than mine.....hehe.
---
Trapper - Secondary ability to summon closed traps back to his hand.
---
Wraith - Remove lightburn
---
Hillbilly - Is now 110% movement speed.
---
Nurse - I would rework her completely, but that's for another time.
---
Hag - 115% movement speed, with fewer traps.
---
Doctor - Rework is coming next patch, so this isn't worth discussing.
---
Huntress - Short of a minor rework, I'd simply give her a visible arc when charging her hatchets.
---
Leatherface - Adjust speed curve so he loses less ground when using his saw.
---
Myers - Remove EW1, outside of certain add-ons.
---
Freddy - Make his Dream Pallets *slightly* more distinguishable from normal pallets/can't place them where destroyed pallets were.
---
Pig - Traps trigger on unhook, not on gen completion.
---
Clown - Increase movement speed when reloading/decrease reload time.
---
Spirit - Phase sound audible when more than 8m from the husk.
---
Legion - Revert to pre-3.4.0
---
Plague - Decreased movement speed with Corrupt Purge.
---
Ghostface - None.
---
Demogorgon - Can aim Shred attack.
---
Oni - Too early to say.
---
Look at the fucking generator who modeled that shit
---
while we’re reworking addons can we change the one that lets ghostface see ppl outside his TR when he downs someone and turn it into a pseudo scratched mirror?
---
Huu..the guy in gray it OP and the guy in blue is an other player
---
Ghostface baby
---
how is that not fair she deserves it for being so toxic, juggling survivor at the end to make them die to EGC
---
I was more concerned with the backwards axe
---
Clearly not, since people have been abusing loops even back then.
---
lol.
---
If its the teachable it will appear in every bloodweb until you get it. Otherwise its just like any other perk and will return eventually.
---
Let's just go with the fact that pretty much everything is wrong here
---
Oni for me is also a very very good designed killer
---
Didn’t you read the loading screen tips wraith finds flashlights very unpleasant
---
Licensed killers will NOT get Tomes.
---
Non-licensed DLC killers might. People can just buy them with iridescent shards earned in-game - they're not that expensive. At most it would take even a casual player a month to buy a new character with shards.
---
No mither and unbreakable?
---
Bill tried 4th-D Slip
---
We'll see how quickly they crank them out but I have a feeling it will be like once a year. I don't see dbd surviving much longer anyways.

I feel like adding breakout is a good middle ground for sabo builds to come back. I've been meaning to try a build with sabo, breakout and empathy and maybe MoM but I'm worried I'll get facecamped into next century if I try it

But it only goes to 70...

Oh I forgot about shards, yeah now I don’t think it’s that bad

Oh 😕

Still really proud of this one I made a while back. I would love to see it in the game: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/av1vg8/updated_hillbilly_irridescent_addon/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I did that for the first Time yesterday and it felt real good
---
A little PSA to all them survivors out there as an Oni main, Keep running in straight lines while taking very light corner turns
---
I’ve always thought pre killers would be cool
---
Like imagine child Myers or frank without a mask playing as survivors
---
The perks will be on the shrine, like idk if you noticed at least 1 perk has been a Claudette/Trapper perk every week. The devs specifically said this would be the case, I'm sure this is how it would be for future archives.
---
Also if you noticed, there's only been 1 Claudette challenge and 3 Trapper challenges, none of which you needed to reach the end of a Tome. My guess is for future Archives, they'll do the same for everyone, you'll see the 6 perks rotate through the shrine if you don't have the  characters and you won't immediately have to do the character specific challenges to get the tome done.
---
r/uselessnobody
---
That's what I was thinking too lmao
---
I'm pissed because I've gotten some of the endgame challenges done multiple times in matches, but I don't actually have access to the actual challenge yet, so I can't make it count.  Only being able to do 1 at a time is pretty shit considering how arbitrary and lucky some are.

*Sweating intensifies*
---
Whens DH gonna be out pleaseeeeee I'm rank 3 and don't have it as a teachable.
---
I just snap hit that bin icon if it's a nurse daily. No questions asked.
---
Yeah, it's an exploit that got turned into a feature. I though I had made that clear: I also like chasing/running as opposed to hide-and-seek (kill all p3 blendettes (also kind of an exploit)). But it's still an exploit: looping is exploiting a mechanic that was never intended to be in the game, and is currently poorly implimented as a result of that (So many band-aid fixes, so many bugs). Clown and possibly Oni are the absolute worst on loops, since clown loops at the exact same speed as survivors and Oni feels almost as slow. Once again, just to round it off: pallet looping is the dictionary definition of an exploit. It just became a feature as well.
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Nurse isn't that hard, in my opinion. Also she's really not hard to counter, too.
---
Fixated is Nancy's perk?
---
It's like they want people to farm
---
I have developed endless hate towards claudettes because they do dumb shit like this BUT in the end watching them find the hatch and fail its worth it
---
Pig RBTs now arm when put on, and gens + unhooks accelerate the timer.
---
After hitting an M1, Wraith can hit M2 to instantly recloak and become totally invisible even when moving for around 5 seconds. Also increase cloaked movement speed, but that's two changes.
---
Are you playing it on Xbox Gamepass? I am not sure if that version upgrades for free or not. I have that one so i am hoping that is the case.
---
Realistically that would happen all the time because the trapper doesn’t take his foot off the pressure plate when he sets it again
---
I'm not even gonna lie, I love that 😂😂 or when they're on the other side of the window taunting you so you just swing for shits and giggles and it still hits them. I mean, I know they're mad or confused cause I'd be too but I just find it hilarious. Like how is this even a thing?
---
I have developed endless hate towards claudettes because they do dumb shit like this BUT in the end watching them look for the hatch and fail its worth it
---
We live and die by the gang
---
If they go in order then oh boy, the Mid-Chapter of Summer 2020 will be fun
---
&gt; if you don't have the  characters
---
If you couldn't do character-related challenges, you'd be at a slight disadvantage, because they offer those rift fragments, therefore, you'd need to work more in order to complete the tome, and those that already bought it would be able to skip a few matches to complete it.
---
I love that u have 2 categories that are secret, so if u see that it's a secret u know it's a mori or survivors start away.
---
They should just remove the unfliping offering.
---
Prepare to die edition
---
One meta is in favour of killers who could use their abilities to anti-loop, such as Nurse, Spirit, etc. A killer who can shut it down and not have to waste time chasing excessively to M1 because time is precious.
---
Now the hit and run meta exists. With sloppy buff and self care nerf, it’s viable to smack a guy and leave him, and go hit another guy. Wraith has the mobility to pull it off, and his cloak lets him get that first hit so much more easily with either bell add on.
---
Combined with the fact less survivors are running sloppy, a wraith will injure 2-4 survivors quickly and then start the process of downing/hooking/trading hooks with the best of them. 
---
Wraith can ignore loops and move on because getting an injure with sloppy either forces them to waste a ton of time healing or to remain one shot against a very sneaky mobile killer. Both scenarios favor the wraith.
---
That said you will want either bell add on plus ideally green or purple windstorm but yellow ain’t bad either.
---
Learning to bodyblock is huge too. Block the pallet, sprint in front and block the window, forcing survivors out of position or to change their plan. With practice it is a scary tactic. Works great.
---
I personally run Ruin BBQ Sloppy and Nurses but Thana over BBQ can be good, Pop as well.
---
Hehe. The next step is: everything clicks, yes, but not vs average red ranks survivor but  against godlike swf with 3000 hours. When you start to become a decent/good nurse you are not interested in average red ranks. I am happy when i get strong premades because i have the opportunity to confront them and see which level I am at.
---
I’m always doing some stupid shit in the middle of a DBD match. Ironically tho that’s when the killer never finds me. As soon as I try, nothing goes right lmao
---
yea, but a single challenge doesn't make that much of a difference. That's at worst like 2ish Tiers worth of fragments, assuming they're master challenges that give 5 fragments each, which sure is a couple dozen extra games, but it doesn't make it any more impossible to reach the max then it is.
---
its the same as if the killer catches you at the exit and drops you just far enough away to let you try to crawl and does it again. Gets not benefit from it and its just annoying. Its an in game insult is what i boils down to.
---
The rift is not that hard to complete,I played 3-4 hours a day usually for 3 weeks straight(I had nothing else to do),and I finished it like a week ago.
---
Bubba is a wholesome boy, just dont go to the beasement.
---
Hey, if Sabo ever ever ever becomes meta again, she'll have the perfect hard counter it it ready to go.
---
New funky mode lmaoo
---
That's why you can opt out. If you care about having as fair as match as possible you can. But if you're just playing the game casually and don't really care about that then you can get potentially shorter queue times. It's always good to give players options.
---
He got banned but since the ban didn’t connect with the Microsoft system only steam he was able to make a account on Microsoft. 
---
It’s like getting banned on Xbox and then making a account on PS4 to not be banned. 
---
The developers fixed the problem. 
---
It’s him who tried to AVOID getting banned because one place he wasn’t banned on. It’s kind of like getting sentenced to prison and then somehow run away to Russia. Kind of.
---
The Tbag might be what triggers him to make sure you die on the hook.  You are taunting people that choose to take the Killer role which is harder and more stressful. Might be the wrong group to try to antagonize.
---
Can that entire Archive set be called Baptism by Fire? Her chievos are all friggin blink-gen grab/ blink-interrupt so I imagine her missions would be ungodly hard

Console, xbox
---
"60fps on console" was a goal BHVR had set for themselves months ago when they planned a game performance optimization process, and one of the planned steps was to rewrite a lot of the game's base code into C++, which is an a lot more efficient language than whatever it is in currently. "Base code" turned into "important elements of the base code", turned into not a single word on anything of that sort anymore, and even optimization itself is something BHVR has mostly gone silent about. The game has if anything only gotten even less well-optimized, with recent updates for example introducing what I think are memory leak issues, where after an hour or two, the game will use more RAM and apparently also use it more inefficiently, since freezes start to happen.
---
One thing BHVR could easily do for consoles is something that's already on PC: give console players the option to adjust graphics quality between the ultra/high/medium/low modes. I have no idea why that's not already a thing, unless console manufacturers require developers to have their games run at a set quality?
---
Not sure what you personally can do, since I'm not familiar with consoles. I don't think they are upgrade-able, as in being able to install more RAM, or overclock components. I suppose you could open and clean it up, especially any heatsinks and fans, to reduce the heat buildup which potentially causes the system to downclock and lose performance. And I'm not sure how consoles handle resolution, but maybe it would be possible to reduce the resolution for an increase in performance. If you connect the console to a low-resolution monitor for example, it would have no choice but to reduce resolution (although it will probably not actually render at a lower resolution but use a scaler). Maybe you can reduce the resolution in the system settings of your console?
---
It's not toxic, just not fun to play against. I didn't come here to play Meat Hook Simulator 2019. 
---
Don't get me wrong, idgaf if I lose a chase and get hooked. That's whatever. If I get farmed and go right back on the hook, I do get irritated. I just want to interact with the game, winning or losing is irrelevant as long as I get to have some fun.
---
Luckily this image doesnt have feelings so i’m in the clear
---
It’s mostly a rank issue at grey ranks lobbies are unnecessarily long but at red it takes like 10 seconds
---
I usually do tasks while waiting for a match (the same goes for when I want to play DPS for Overwatch). I usually empty the dishwasher, or clean my room etc. It's a great way to game while also getting some shit done.

Whats the Doctor rework? I have been using him as my main for a few days, well, since i started the game and im getting quiet good at it, at least in the 14-18 skill level.
---
Tbagging is literally teasing, it was made to make the other player upset. its always been like that
---
They didn't
---
There aren't many red rank killers playing and red rank survivors SUCK every rank 1-10 killer into their lobbies in seconds
---
*Sad cautious boop*
---
No,no.It means when this tome of the Archives ends up(Trapper and Claudette),a new one will show up with new characters and challenges.Doctor might be one,and this meme refers to that you might have a hard time if the new tome is about a killer you're not used to.
---
I've seen this happen before I was in a match and a trapper was trapping his totem but ended up putting his traps to close together wich caused this glitch to happen if survivors disarm one of the traps then it should stop.
---
Pop goes the weasel? Yes!
---
Current load out is actually lightweight, boil over, self care and we're gonna live forever. Nice try though. Also good job displaying like every toxic trait this community loves so much 😊😊
---
They had challenges specific to hooking in basement and also running agitation so... they kinda can’t haha
---
Getting punished by rng for playing killer like totem spawns and windows and strong loops connecting with great vaults. Its ridiculous
---
The plague would most definitely step on the hag I mean what is she going to do set a trap

*Laughs in nurse main*
---
Thank you. Same to you complaining about somebody's choice of perks cause you personally don't like them.

What do you mean by a live and no,  i don't cthink it has controller support
---
yes because nurse is extremely easy and brainded to play on pc amirite /s

It's when you evolve into a walking Nurse just to style on survivors that you know you've truly crossed into the realm of insanity.
---
I'm sure there are nice ones out there. I just haven't run into them.
---
I appreciate all your hard work. Or should I say God's work?
---
All right then... I guess I'm going to start downloading something and pinging myself
---
If only we had a killer that makes you go insane... cough cough doctor cough cough
---
I got that without even knowing. I acidentally put additional blink addon and in the beginning of the game while blinking around to find survivors i stumbled across no mither Bill vaulting over window and grabbed him when i intended to hit him. "From the void she kills" appeared on the screen and i didnt even know how, so i had to google it to see why i got it.
---
I play on Xbox as well, it takes 10-40 minutes for me to find a survivor game (I know this because I tried to stream it for my bf) then rage quit doing that, said “here I go killing again” and found a killer lobby in under a minute. If I ready up as killer, I literally don’t have time to choose an add on and offerings before I’m in a lobby.
---
He can see the blood pellets that survivors drop for him to get his power through walls, not the actual puddles, which makes it quite hard to shale him off once you are injured.
---
Both......one hand each
---
I will kill Claudette every time.  They are some of the worst players.
---
Meg archives: miss 50 skillchecks and run away with Sprint Burst.
---
I did the same thing. Best thing I've done in the game. 1000 hours later and I'm still convinced about this.
---
What? Toxic.
---
What's the point of Coulrophobia if you are only gonna use it as a Doctor
---
It was on Hawkins, that top room. I was up there doing the gen, one of my teammates was getting the ruin in the next room.
---
Nurse blinked, hit chick on ruin, blinked and hit me. Dunno how she got the Nea, but after hooking me, she got her somehow.
---
a lot has changed, killers have far more gen stall capabilities, not to mention the emblem changes will literally make it that 4-5 of the people in Marth's experiment will not pip if you care to call pips the win instead of purely basing it off kills/escapes. If I remember correctly, all they did was stick on gens and only went for saves SOMETIMES, usually they ended up leaving the person on the hook if there was a chance that they would end up hook trading or wasted too much time doing so.
---
Killers have far more snowball potential, sure gens can be done fast, but there are also matches where all of a sudden 2+ people are on hooks with another being chased, like you can't ignore that killers are just as capable of instantly turning the tides in a match with 1 or 2 good plays and ending up with 3-4 kills in a short time frame. If you have to assume the survivor can be decent at looping, you should be able to assume the killer is good at ending chases quick, which IS enough a lot of the time, the picture I'm sure what you're going to paint is the same thing Tru3 says where sub 30 second chases aren't enough, but they usually are especially if you're consistent with them.
---
I said dozens of times in this long as thread to several people already, but I'm NOT claiming the game is 100% balanced or that every killer is perfect. I'm just pointing out that it's getting better and we are on the right track for it, several low tier killers are already on track for getting reworks and a couple perks are getting buffed/nerfed every single patch to offer more variety, I mean insta-heals and Balanced were both nerfed not to long ago. This isn't the same game that Marth did his experiment on, and while I did enjoy him back in the day, he is obviously killer biased and I wouldn't exactly go to him for insight on making this game fair.
---
Don't say those things, it's making me cry
---
Coxcombed Clapper, anyone?
---
I actually like. It is a good way to show how sloppy she became after dropping the e-sports team.

What’s a tome?

Oni is new I would expect him to be more used than billy

Damn you right

ill try better thanks for being honest

As long as they provide rewards for the "highest" rank achieved and not "current rank" at the end of the season, I'm fine with it. Reason being is you will have like 3 days before reset where people at rank 1 will just stop playing entirely and queue times will be abysmal if you don't.
---
Also, because there are two sides to ranking up, I think more than 1 month is fine for people who can't play this full time. (Lining up with Rifts sound good tbh.)
---
I don't recall anything in Left for Dead being particularly worse than a teleporting ghost nurse or a giant Japanese hulk. Especially since now he doesn't have 3 heavily armed friends anymore but go off.

I really don't want to be petty but when I spectate my teammate who urban evaded the entire match, neglecting every objective getting chased by the killer I'm always like "YES TRAPPER TEAR THE BITCH APART" Lmao

If you get tier 100 I’ll give you as many auric cells as you want.
---
Nemesis Legion was bs and not on the same level as literally running around a pallet to evade getting stabbed by a killer but ok. On top of that, Nemesis Legion was solved because it was actually a problem. Exploits in games are literally bugs that people take advantage of, not something that was intended to be used one way but is now used differently.

Anyways, keep comparing apples to oranges and hiding your score buddy.

Only people who pop the exit are those with noed, I see you, scummy noed gamer.

Gg piece of shit
---
I think you’re massively over-estimating the impact not completing certain tome challenges will have.
---
Most of the time rewards are for the characters the tote is about.  If you don’t have the character, why care about those rewards/lore?
---
Also, unless I’ve missed something, the *rifts* are time-locked but the *tomes* are not.  So even if the rift closes you can still get the tome lore later, once you have the character.
---
And all of that aside, the “slight advantage” offered by having the killers for Times doesn’t even compare to the advantage of having m, for example, top-tier killer Spirit unlocked.  It has a much bigger impact on the game.
---
Or the perk BBQ (or any other high tier perk), locked behind a licensed killer that *requires* actual money, not just shards.  Yeah, it’ll be in the shrine at some point, but that *slight advantage* for already having it, as you said.
---
Lmfao
---
Dumbest thing I’ve heard. Fix queue times, so force people to play a certain role. Or remove ranking system. They can’t fix queue times when it’s all because of the community. It’s a first come first serve basis
---
I’d rather the focus be on stuff like fixing the dedicated servers. I don’t need my games to be ultra-gorgeous. Can’t use ultra settings on my potato anyway. I just want my games to be functional.
---
Yeah that hasn't been my experience at all. As killer, I get trolly, teabaggy survivors almost every game who send hate mail no matter what you do, and as survivor, I get killers who d/c almost immediately if 2 gens get completed within the first few minutes. Inf act, this is the least "chill" playerbase I have ever experienced. And I'm on PS4. Maybe I just have bad luck though.
---
I started the game with her and I have been maining her for 600 hours (I have 1000 hours in total,400 survivor) and I still think I did the best choice i could. If you put effort in her she's 400% worth it. She's out of the world.
---
I'm gonna repost this meme on Instagram

I’ve leveled up my nurse to 50 and she currently has the build of hex, nurse, barebecue and pop but I have never ever touched her in my time playing this game because as a console player I’m scared of that thing.

I'm honestly just waiting for them iron out whatever problems that they're having. Good servers are a million times better than P2P can ever be. The only thing P2P has over dedicated is that you at least know what you're getting into when you load into the lobby so you can Dodge if it's in the 200+.
---
59 for me with a couple of challenges still undone in tome level 3. I expect to reach max sometime during next week.
---
I know when I started I wanted to try all the killers and my highest level when I started back up again was Huntress. I may try her again, she sounds fun once you get the hang of her. I will force myself to wait on cosmetics
---
Huntress issues is mainly desync. Same as the hotbox issue. God I wish this game was as synced as csgo
---
And then everyone clapped!
---
I personally don’t think it’s possible for a casual player to max out the Rift, even completing all the challenges. 
---
I maxed it out with 2 challenges left on level 3 of Tome and I play easy 20 hours a week. Halving my playtime to 10 hours a week would mean i’d only be around level 35-40 right now.
---
Isn't it for all players? Is a BPS for people who ran out of BPS
---
I don’t understand I played her for like 2 matches and then it was nothing but 4K matches until like rank 3. She’s so easy and always has been you don’t even need addons.
---
"broken killers" ha ok
---
It makes no sense, it means you don’t have to be aware as a survivor anymore. You’re just awful at the game if you struggle to know where the killer is
---
Who are you people and what are you doing in MY home???
---
they nerfed legion and pig, no one is safe
---
The thing that helps the most is being able to use directional keys as well
---
Nah, you're thinking of bloody party streamers. Bound envelope is like the shittier knock off version of it.
---
Yep
---
@Me when a basic task is part of my daily.
---
I mean, I can't completely blame him for being a bit salty about a match like that. Doesn't sound very fun
---
I'm pretty sure it's to encourage casual players to buy up tiers since they know they'll never have the time to finish it through gameplay alone.
---
accurate
---
You sound like you're bad at survivor
---
The comments are the fuck ?
---
Are you on console?
---
been watching a lot of high ranked youtubers and i see emm all using pop.
---
looks like a meta perk to me.
---
It's a good thing, it will be the opportunity to many people to learn to play her !
---
You have to complete the objective to get adrenaline.
---
If I’m not wrong he’s playing on Console. And as a console player, I know it’s harder to look behind since it takes more time + it takes also more time to come to the original state of looking in front of you. 
---
You usually check behind when vaulting. NB: Players who usually check a lot during a straight lined chase are getting ready to 360
---
Its almost as if that red color is known as the iridescent quality along with the red emblems
---
When I said you should think carefully about what has actually changed, I meant about whether or not 3 gens are less likely to be completed after the first chase or not.
---
What changes do you think effect that? What Marth's team did was leave the first guy on the hook until the first 3 gens are done because that frees people up to unhook. Also, if you care about pipping you can power the gates and meme for 5 minutes and get your pips even if bullying and meming gets you killed. Survivors aren't punished for rushing because they can decide to stall at the last minute.
---
Balanced landing and instaheal nerfs don't address the underlying fact that the numbers are in survivors' favor. Survivors get perks and items on top of that as training wheels, bully tools, and meme fuel.
---
This should be fixed in spite of the fact that most survivors can't properly hold m1 on gens and shift W from killers.
---
He's pretty balanced imo, in the right hands he can be nasty but he's also easy enough to counter
---
Hit them full totems. Knock em out, and NOED is unavailable end game and waste of a perk Hatch is basically a NOED type counter. Last survivor getting hatch with multiple gens needed can be infuriating as well. Including survivors may have a key. I will say as a survivor main, it's a bit of an "Oh Shit" moment when NOED hits. Personally, I never feel bad if I'm left hooked by other survivors in those games
---
I'm going to die from a concussion with all this face palming
---
Close quarters god, but easily the most jukeable killer. Your not hitting survivors who know how to run loops with his dash. This type of stuff is just the right place at the right time.
---
Did you play Bill ?
---
Found what half a year ago? The video? This map wasn’t even released at that time...
---
Not to self promote but I mean if you like this vid you can follow me on IG for more. @totem.king 
---
I just repost on Reddit sometimes
---
You also have to be injured or downed. I don't like NOED either, but I don't think it's OP because of how easy it is to counter.
---
Found what half a year ago?
---
But you also get it if the hatch is closed
---
Every single time I equip a loot hunting build. I always ask myself "Why are you not pressuring gens?" Then they chase me for 5 minutes and gens pop and wonder why they lost.
---
Yea! Sink a disproportionate amount of time into a casual game before you express any opinions on the game state. Everything you don't like is purely your fault and the game is balanced. Fuck people that play with friends let's balance the game around lonely 1000 hour killer mains.
---
People are entitled to their opinions. Put your hours on your resume loser. People can talk whatever they want, and you can call out their points and make arguments if you want, but gatekeeping isn't cool and neither are you.
---
what’s a tome and what is it changing about the nurse
---
Perk 3 
---
"just throw me out with the garbage"
---
This perk activates when you have been hooked 2 times before any other survivor has been hooked. The next time the killer attempts the place you on a hook you immediately break out of their grasp and break the hook they attempted to use.
---
*FBI OPEN UP*
---
Except their best add-ons are green.
---
Needs a downside or something. Billy breaking pallets while not stopping sounds really over powered.
---
Is the perk good for the game though?
---
because ‘JuSt dO ToTeMs’
---
Exactly why this game is 90% casuals that quit, and 10% neets with insane hours. Only the autists keep playing then gatekeep conversations on game state because god forbid anyone have fun before they have sunk 500 hours.
---
Missing "Featuring Dante" sticker
---
Noob3
---
that title don’t make sense
---
Thanks, I will! I haven't done much with this "power", not even sure if it was a one time thing or if it's just something that happens under certain circumstances.
---
!!! TOXIC !!!
---
This is gonna make you sound stupid because you don’t read patch notes, rank 16-20 can be ranked with any ranks or they’ll have hour long queues. But surely you knew that before you tried blaming them for matchmaking
---
I'm perfectly OK with Billy's best add-ons being greens TYVM.
---
Bubba could definitely use an add-on rework overall.
---
I mean, yeah, true, that’s why I don’t run those perks because they’re also infuriating to go against. I’m mostly a survivor main, though I play both sides. When Adrenaline or DS hits, I get a slight “Darn.” so I guess I’m kinda exaggerating my experience with NOED because I’m on the receiving end more often
---
Why is Adrenaline a thing
---
Y’all probably heard this a million times already, but why the fuck is Adrenaline a perk. 
---
It’s the most infuriating, aggravating, most bullshit perk I’ve played against. 
---
It’s driving me crazy to be this to close to a kill, everything went perfect, I was going to secure a kill. I chased survivors successfully, hooked them a few times, and even wasted their time, but my kills were denied by the simple activation of a perk. 
---
Like, why is it a perk? It rewards survivors when they’ve already activated the Exit Gates, punishing the killer even more than they already are. 
---
I just... don’t like it. I will never like it. And the only situation I will ever use it, is for the Archives, and even then I will feel disgusted and probably not play for a few days.
---
DDV with urban evasion can juke killer around totem.
---
I was hoping someone would guess it lol
---
THE GEN TAPPING BILL WHO SHAMED ME FOR MISSING ONE HEX SKILL CHECK DESPITE HITTING EVERY SINGLE OTHER ONE
---
And he leaves you to go chase someone else.
---
*insert ugly Claudette face on hook here*
---
Yup. Hooks are now map specific, with the originally designed killer specific hooks now used for certain maps.
---
They do if they have decisive strike
---
I don't think it's bad nor good, it's just a perk imo, one I rarely run into at that
---
Wtf?
---
Balance around new players, you’re smart. Idk where you’re from but “loser” and “cool”, you mad lad
---
Noed is fine how it is. Honestly Yall just bad. learn to deal with it or stop complaining.
---
Not captured in the video: me straight up deleting Leatherface from existence by stepping on his toes.
---
It's gotten to the point where it's more reliable to fake a vault and juke the lunge than it is to actually vault the window.
---
Right! Oh my god. When gavin stepped on a hag tap and used his flashlight i almost cried.
---
50% move speed killer.  His special power is to throw trash cans that cause deep wounds.
---
Np! They have a ton of videos and do new ones whenever an new chapter comes out.
---
Every match. I hit every totem I see given that I can do so safely. Not only for NOED, but it's an easy 1,000 BP per totem. I'll usually try to grab the ones by the gens though so once i'm done I can hop on a gen and help the team.
---
Those types of killers get toxic if anyone escapes
---
getting bloodpoints for 40 levels is shorter than getting the shards for buying it from the shrine.
---
Damn, that turn around tho
---
Found the rank 15!
---
Literally Overwatch. Most shooters. Any game with specific input that is SUPER time sensitive. This isn't serversize. This is clientside that causes the issue. Client registers hit before server sends out notification that the survivor dead harded. Therefore, hit. This is how MOST games work.
---
Yeah, he seems to be doing really well. 
---
I found him at the end of his DBD season so I’m still bitter lol.
---
The other survivors eventually left on the sailboat, it could of taken him then.
---
Don't forget the Huntress hatchets that curve around walls and up stairs.
---
i dont think decisive is something to reward poor gameplay. it can be used for counter play around u getting focused and also theres a skill check lol so its not like it’s guaranteed to hit it 100% . also killers will catch you for the most part since u have limited resources, run at a slower speed, bloodlust, etc . so its really inevitable to escape when u get farmed and thats why ds is a thing
---
Gotta love how some killers just straightup dont have any
---
RIFT CHALLENGES ARE TOO MUCH OF A GRIND. THERE IS NO GOOD REASON THAT ONLY ONE CAN BE SELECTED AT A TIME. THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY VARIABLES THAT YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER DURING A MATCH TO NOT MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE A CHORE. I LIKE HAVING CHALLENGES TO WORK FOR ALONG WITH REWARDS BUT THESE ARE BRUTAL.
---
Instagram gey
---
I am terrible with hatchets so Huntress was a bit of a struggle for me, I still enjoyed playing her and still do occasionally (my boyfriend likes her but he won’t get the game so that’s his killer of choice if he plays on mine)
---
I honestly just have more fun on IG
---
Most likely ruin
---
Do you have any tips? Trying to control how far I go when I blink is fucking hard.
---
Love that. I was ghostface and a survivor asked if he could blind me for challenges, and we helped each other while I killed everyone else. I love when people are nice
---
They’re changing it back today lol
---
It’s S tier wym
---
My house has never been cleaner since I started playing this game
---
Thank God those freddy addons were nerfed, so obnoxious to play against
---
"He has a sweeping instadown attack....we better all cluster up together!"
---
Outplayed
---
Sorry you're still pretty bad.
---
Do bones. Its really that simple.
---
&gt; Same with Ranchor 
---
I will assume you're referring to 'Rancor'. That perk is not on the same level as NOED because you know the killer has it, you can prepare yourself against it. That is the opposite of NOED. You don't know NOED is in the game until it is too late. Assuming every killer has NOED and 'just doing totems' is a long and hard counter for a perk that 'might' be in the game. Yes, NOED is busted and a hard crutch, but Behaviour made a statement some time ago that they're still happy and won't do anything about it.
---
Spirit does require skill but nowhere near the amount of level Nurse does.
---
This.
---
You got a link for that? I wanna print that for myself.
---
Killers should have silly run when they're chasing somebody they can mori
---
im at 48 and i play a shit ton lol . like sometimes 2-4 hours a day. i did all the tomb 1-2 challenges but i think the tomb challenges should be 5 rift fragments and then 10 rift fragments for completion instead of the current 3&amp;5.
---
Noed is actually equivalent to keys in some way. Every one keeps throwing them in the same basket as mori's as if there's a point to be made
---
Heres some snack bars
---
Nope, my bad!
---
Just do that one during a bloodhunt. Survivors will happily farm with you.
---
I suffered the most for the "Merciless Victory" with just her 3 base perks. Because you cannot farm that one and Nurse's Calling is her only good perk.
---
Yeah, got a typo there...
---
Idk man, right now I feel like all those entitled survivors I usually kind of resent
---
Sprint Burst sucks though.
---
Instagram is literally the dustbin for memes from reddit.
---
Well for what it's worth, I had to stop taking it because it literally did not work for me. I tried timing it with the killer lunge, nah, lag didn't let me. So  I started predicting like .25-.5 seconds ahead of lunge. Nah lag wouldn't let me. So I went even further. Lag *still* wouldn't let me. Dead hard was only good for distance, but there are better perks for that.
---
[there you go](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2842263)
---
So why is Oni able to strafe (move left and right) while charging?
---
Freddy nerfs.......
---
"Updated turn ratio of The Oni Demon Dash ability to improve controller turn-rate." 
---
Will Oni now actually be able to flick and turn half decently on console? I really hope so as it's the only thing preventing him from being an A tier killer on console
---
Thanks, friend.
---
This game is full of potatoes
---
Sprint Burst. You can use it an indefinite amount of times in a given match and get reliable, consistent and impactful value out of it.
---
It's common when discussing NOED. The community that absolutely loves using NOED will divert the attention with something that is also a BS, thinking that you are an absolute survivor main and deserve to be shut down immediately with your BS perk. Remember, when you discuss NOED, be prepared to be greeted with all meta perks survivors use, it's their way of justifying NOED. Cheers.
---
BLAME THE STUPID ESCAPE WITHOUT BEING HOOKED WITH SPINE CHILL CHALLENGE
---
Too many SJW’s on Reddit tho
---
Second chance perk for bad play, survivors has them as well.
---
I think it's funny they fixed Oni's sensitivity so quickly, yet Nurse is still waiting for the same thing
---
These are the basics. You have to build your muscle memory. There's no way to teach this. It's like learning to walk. You just practice and practice and practice. Don't use plaid flannel, it distracts you from survivors and tracking is the only nurse's weakness other than your own skill.
---
Lol DBD reddit hates toxicity? That's news to most the survivor mains here
---
URBAN EVASION TEAMMATES WHO CAN'T EVEN DO A GENERATOR WHILE I LOOP THE KILLER
---
That's why there is subs dedicated to them
---
If you only had fun after 500 hours, then I’m sorry for you.
---
Yeah
---
I'm lost, I just started playing again and main her and mama Huntress. Only thing I noticed is her wacky hit reg but what's broken on her?
---
Wow rip Bloody Gloves. I didn't think they were all that good to begin with, but they're pretty unusable now.
---
PLAYED A TRAPPER WHO FACECAMPS AND SAYS ITS FUN AND DOESNT CARE ABOUT PIPPING YET HE MESSAGES ME HE LIKE TO “WIN” TO GET A BETTER RANK AND DOESNT CARE ABOUT THE FUN???? WHAT?!
---
Ohhh might try that actually. Yhhh the adept nurse was an awfull one for me to, i just got it because they fucked their own game, i was literally about to dc of frustration when i down one, and then a injured nea bodyblocks and goes down, and then the 3rd just comes and tries unhooking right under my nose and i got a grab... at that point im juat wondering wrf is going on... surprise surprise the 4 injured bby dweet appears and i just kill him without any mercy, so then i do then i just do the most reasonable ge killer and never looked back
---
I SEE A LOWER CASE “Y”
---
Acceptable if they were keeping killer busy while other 3 worked on gens.
---
That one makes sense tbh, if they're farther away from the window and doing that then it's weird but if they're standing right next to it they're asking to get hit
---
Not trying to be mean, but Stridor and Thanatophobia are definitely not good or even amazing when your game could be over after 5 minutes because you don't have Ruin.
---
I'm pretty much red ranks all the time so those perks were completely useless to me. Maybe Stridor not entirely because some people might have had Iron Will. But other than that, yeah, not that useful.
---
Why'd they remove yours?
---
If the game is for fun they should get rid of ranks or make the pip system less annoying so people who play to win don't get mad when they barely pip or depip because they killed everyone too fast or didnt get chased at all.
---
The basekit nerf unnecessarily hindered her power and crippled her chase potential and map pressure beyond belief. One small slip prolongs a chase for an unreasonably long amount of time and her base movement speed is too low to not be blinking around the map all the time. 
---
There is far too much of a window to make mistakes against Nurse and get off unpunished for it. And pointing any of this out usually gets you lambasted with talk of “blink spam” and “hur dur you just need Omegablink to do well” like...no, I got to rank 1 with addonless Nurse before the rework and now I’m capped at rank 4. There’s a problem here guys, and it’s on top of her being bad it’s that half the time I feel like I’m not able to do anything and it makes me want to rip out my eyeballs.
---
I like it thick on trapper and stealth killers, and normal on almost everyone else
---
&gt;why do you bleed when your sick
---
Google the word: Plague
---
*survivors do something stupid*
---
"THIS KILLER IS OP"
---
dbd in a nutshell
---
Don't feel that way. From being active on this subreddit since the game release I've learned it hard way that when you suggest something that balances one side they're going to call you the other side main. It's just how it is around here, that and free karma memes post, they've been here since day one too.
---
THANKS FOR NERFING ONE OF THE TWO ADD-ONS I USED AS FREDDY, BHVR. NOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO USE IN THAT SLOT? ALL HIS ADD-ONS ARE TRASH.
---
AND STILL NO NERF FOR OoO AGAINST FREDDY WHEN THE USER IS ASLEEP? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!
---
They’re coming in between every chapter and the devs just said last year at the Game Awards that they’re planning on continuing for at least 5 more years.
---
this wouldn’t be included in fixes you retard, literally at top of patch notes. Reading is hard for you but that’s okay
---
Thanat is good when built around. Stridor is great for tracking against Iron Will. Honestly I’d prefer either of those two to NC since nobody heals in the TR to begin with. Only time NC ever nets you perfect eyesight is when you have M&amp;A to combo it with so you get that 24TR out of chase.
---
Imagine being so shit at survivor you can't handle an M1 killer as an SWF

---
Aye but blame the farmer not the killer.
---
Bloody Gloves is still a really strong ad on as it will still show aura's constantly, especially since the duration stacks 2 seconds per absorbed orb.
---
The anniversary of them killing some random janitor then walking into the woods
---
Probably that the cyclops was stupid for falling for it
---
Ds is also fine
---
I don't know.  It was this exact same meme in the context of players coming up to a nearly finished Gen to "help", and then bailing.
---
I finished mine when there was 43 days still left. Started at level 16 as well.
---
True especially with no mother 😩
---
\*gets chased all game by a rank 20 killer who sucks at the game becasue he is new\*
---
\*Last gen pops and Adrenaline goes off when I'm about to get hit\*
---
\*I escape because of Adrenaline\*
---
It's situational tho. Sometimes that happens, sometimes it doesn't. In low ranks, I'd say it is a crutch and NOED is too. In higher ranks, people know there's a counter and don't complain about how bad it is as much (at least not to the killer) even if they do refuse to do dulls.
---
“I did not stab her! I did naaaaaht. Oh, hi Meg”
---
You don't need your insta down if they are injured and visible. with no way to mind game.
---
Woosh
---
Oni can still snap around corners on the attack after the dash, it's a pretty tight turn too if they know what they're doing
---
I won't buy those skins when they arrive in the store nonetheless. $10 is a fucking robbery and I am not sure why people aren't fighting it.
---
Doable yes, likely no.
---
Ive ran no mither plenty of times for fun. And id say 9/10 the killer will go out of their way to make sure to pick you up because you have no mither. 
---
That and id bet even if you got slugged the other survivors would probably pick you up before you could.
---
Hearing a Freddy main complaining for the first time since his (objectvely busted) rework makes me so happy. This is such a great patch :) sorry about your crutch dude.
---
Another reason why backwater swamp is a bad map
---
Doesn't look like it. Oh well, I still have about 12 abdominal dressings to burn though anyways.
---
I literally said I never used a Forever Freddy build, so go elsewhere with your salt.
---
He was already cloaked and we where in mid chase I ran to  a T L wall and  ran around the T and when I came to the pallet to throw it behind me he was in front of it.
---
They had one gen left at the start of the vid and none were down or hooked, they popped the fourth gen after the first guy got hit and he ended up getting them all down
---
"Oops. I dropped the medkit I use for my magnum health state."
---
L-Ts don't have pallets
---
what are you talking about
---
You sure you both ain’t rank 20?
---
No spirit/wraith speed boost fix :(
---
So you, along with everyone else, assumed we can’t handle the plague. We’re red and purple ranks, and have been for 2 years. We don’t play for ranking, we don’t play to be toxic (but I fucking love it), we play for fun. Plague is the LEAST fun to play against, in our opinions. So we run the DC. Why? Cuz it’s funny, and saves us an incredibly boring 10 minute match.
---
They also nerfed his demon dash turning though, so it kinda sounds like a mixed bag.
---
What ghosts are you looking for?
---
I notice the exhaustion meter to the right and the fact that she never even uses balanced landing. She staggers when falling into the exit gate area as well.
---
Get your eyes checked.
---
A result of their latest failed attempt at fixing matchmaking.
---
Less red rank killers and a shit ton of purple/red survivors.   So as soon as you hit rank 9/10 as killer, you nearly instant pop into a suck without friend red rank lobby where they generally proceed to stomp you due to skill difference.   It is an effort in complete frustration because you can't really face those of your own skill level.   They need to separate matchmaking skill and rank.
---
Yeah and that's why I always DC against a good nurse.
---
They're still pretty good. I think this is a fair change as they were the most busted addon in the game previously, basically permanent NC unless people healed.
---
Is this a copy pasta?
---
She’s literally the least fun killer to play against. Imagine trying to have fun with your friends but instead you get put in with the vomit queen
---
The cat wasn't the most overused...in my opinion seeing the millions of posts of Spirit using Rancor killing their survivors at the exit gates got old real fast
---
It's not a free win. When the hatch is in play then the killer had already dominated the game before the gates were powered. That means if the hatch wasn't a thing then the survivor might as well just find the killer and die. Don't forget, your odds in 1 v 1 scenario are really bad unless the killer has literally just picked up the game and you have already few hundred hours in-game. So in order for the survivor to keep playing and trying to survive is the hatch or the gates, but at this point, you only have a tiny chance of surviving anyway based on what I have written previously.
---
And what about Decisive Strike?
---
Nah the difference is that you cant chase people whilst using it and its hitbox is a straight line whilst bubba has a cone. Also I'm pretty sure the fact that it takes time to charge up blood fury counts as a charge up time, coupled with the fact that blood fury is limited. All of this makes up for it having no charge up time.
---
But yeah bubba still sucks ass.
---
Nothing stopping you from delibertely getting into chases once the gens are nearly all done and it's relatively safe.
---
I dont get people that miss old Freddy.
---
He went from Frank killer to top killing machine. That is an underdog success story if I ever heard one.
---
Aww thank you for being nice!
---
If you needed game slowdown addons to 4K as Freddy, you're not a very good Freddy. Sorry to break your bubble, bro.
---
If everything went perfect the last gen wouldnt have popped. Adrenaline rewards survivors for completing all of the generators while NOED rewards killers who failed to complete their objective and stop gens from being completed
---
They made Oni playable on console
---
*cries in I am so happy*
---
Billy can't hit multiple people at once? I've never seen this happen.
---
Why would we make a non stealth killer a stealth killer when using an add on? I have yet to see a reasonable “legion rework” and completely changing his mechanics with an add on is a joke
---
I can't build around Thanatophobia when I can neither choose my character (e.g. Legion or Plague) or other perks (e.g. Sloppy Butcher).
---
I have to play Nurse with her 3 base perks and in that case Thanatophobia doesn't help much. Neither does Stridor when you're not playing Spirit.
---
I used one (1) slow-down add-on cause I didn't know what else to use. I 4k just fine, thanks for your concern.
---
People have stopped playing Killer.
---
Less killers = less supply.
---
Just as much of a pain, really
---
Is this what low IQ sounds like?
---
Right? Atm its either a good nurse or a terrible nurse. No middle ground
---
Huh, so what should the other survivors do? Nothing?
---
What a great time to be a Tapp main. I never thought he'd get cosmetics but now he has a lot of stuff to wear.
---
250 Auric Cells or 4500 Iridescent Shards.
---
glad to see the good ol’ “Featuring Dante from Devil May Cry”
---
Why use a mori when you can facecamp? Just pop them on a hook and stare into their soul and you can feel the raw, unhindered salt coming out of the screen.
---
At 0:15: you are outpositioned, there's no pallet or window around you to run the killer.
---
At 0:28, you dont wait at the pallet for the killer to destroy it. Yet you immediately run without knowing what the killer is going to do.
---
At 1:10 you try to hide in a position that is a Dead Zone if the killer finds you. Instead run towards the other side of the map so the killer has to waste time catching up.
---
You have to keep your camera on the killer more often.
---
Are you ok
---
I think Bills sweater has been available for last week or so but do I see Steve and Yui on that list!!!! Bruh I might to grab those
---
Where's Ash?
---
Check out Steam charts, the game is thriving on PC and has been for a very long time. The playerbase is probably bigger on console.
---
Jeff: "am I a joke to you?"
---
rank 1 SWF against first game rank 20 killer seems balanced
---
see i dont have an issue with tweaking that.  i dont use his purple/pink add ons, personally, because it feels like a little too much.  
---
i dont bother using snares tho.  i'll run dream pallets every game.  i should get better with using snares and i will once my pallet add ons run out and i dont want to spend bp to get more.  
---
im more excited about oni's turning being tuned.
---
FUCK
---
"Search five chests."
---
Whelp...guess I'm going on an adventure!
---
Upvoted because of Moseby.
---
I don’t get how it’s hard to believe?
---
I'm a great example of that.
---
this is probably an unpopular opinion, but while the whole running in a circle mechanic might not be "toxic" because its built into the game, its the definition of unfun for me, both as survivor and when i play killer.  
---
If Last Year gets bigger and fixes their shit, i'll probably start playing that instead of Dead by Daylight. I enjoy the interactions between the survivors and the killers in that game much more than i enjoy DBD's
---
Because power creep.
---
She has the exhaustion meter cause its already been used Einstein, they're zooming around corners with unlimited duration which only stopped once she tried to enter a locker causing them to glitchout even more.
---
Those tabs tho
---
This true?
---
He's not in the banner but he does have a sweater.
---
Why is Yui's 1800 but Jane's 4500?
---
There any difference quality wise or what? I can't check on my own.
---
so you like being facecamped?
---
It's an industry standard now especially ever since Fortnite started selling individual skins for upwards of $20. The skins sold like hotcakes and eventually every developer with a cosmetic micro transaction money model soon followed including BHVR.
---
How dare you
---
Bill tapped into Yamaoka's Haunting. 
---
Nerf Bill.
---
Is she just harder to control or is she actually broken?
---
WHY DO PEOPLE RUN CALL SPIRIT? I JUST DONT GET IT, YOU FREAKS
---
Reset your console. I did the same and I am installing the patch right now.
---
Yeah... obviously going to take the hatch at that point. Killer is just using the 3rd as bait for the 4k.
---
if only there was a killer
---
who wears a sweater
---
who would look extra fucking sexy with a xmas sweater.....
---
but i get licensing limitations.  
---
still would've been nice to get them for some other killers and not just legion.
---
I AGREE WITH YOU, I CAME BACK TO THE GAME A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THE THIRD SET WAS RELEASED AND I CANT POSSIBLY EXPECT TO CATCH UP
---
&gt; First of all, you speak like you have extremely low level of overall gamesense. Im a 2.5k hours, rank 1 player
---
If you start doing this right away then you likely have no decent argument because right off the bat you are not engaging with the actual substance of the comment.
---
&gt; there is no maybe doing gens,
---
lol this is nonsense and you know it.
---
1) that person may also have been trying to make their way for a save
---
2) that person may have been just waiting for team deaths (we all know those players exist)
---
3) immersing during Oni's blood rage is the best counter to it
---
&gt; What makes you lose a killer game is gen progression, not 'free saves' whatever that may be.
---
Free saves are when people in the basement get saved literally behind your back and you just let it happen.
---
And downing 3 people in the basement absolutely wins you games. Do not be ridiculous, please
---
In what world is getting three people down *in the fucking basement* a misplay?
---
survivor mains are wild
---
No, lol, look at the tabs. Haha
---
If he was focused on you the entire match how did you teammates manage to die aswell? Especially when it wasn't even to NOED. I understand one guy dying in an attempt to save you but assuming he'd just facecamp them aswell I don't understand how the other one died, unless the DC fucked you guys over
---
Considerably increased charged time
---
Not gonna lie almost had a heart attack
---
What’s STBFL?
---
Hotfix is supposed to arrive like 15 min ago, so try restarting your xbox or something
---
Thanks for your anecdotal evidence, but the experiences of one person don't really mean anything. Billy can hit multiple people if they are close together
---
Not a fan of the head but if it makes you happy then cool beans
---
half decent players don't give two shits if the killer knows where they are while healthy. Literally all you have to do to counter this is have healthy players eat orbs
---
&gt; Wait until it goes live to see how the strength changes
---
maybe you should take your own advice since you did this first
---
Downloading now thanks
---
People that understand math understand that the action speed debuff add-ons weren't really a problem. It could add up when stacked with Thanatophobia and Dying Light, but that's all add-on slots and half of one's perk slots spent on things that individually don't even matter, and together barely do. Freddy's problem is the fact that he can spam an unlimited amount of Snares without any slowdown or cooldown whatsoever. This makes looping all but impossible, you are forced to drop pallets early and if the pallet is not completely safe, you are still getting hit on it. And not only pallet loops, you are basically forced to leave much of any structure after a single rotation since he can snare the hell out of it, and then you are stuck between a free hit if you stay and potentially a free hit if you don't. At least Freddy loses Bloodlust now whenever he sets a Snare. I think he should have a 5-second cooldown on setting Snares.
---
Interesting that they changed Oni's turn rate rather than controller mechanics, wonder how that will affect Oni on mouse. Bloody Glove sounds pretty bad now - won't survivors constantly be re-absorbing Orbs and denying you your power, where you can only gain it through hitting people and absorbing Orbs left mid-chase?
---
I like the various fixes, especially the not stepping into freshly-set traps as Trapper one, but still no fix for Med-Kit add-ons?
---
On a separate note: please consider linking directly to the patch notes. This way I have to go through twitter, then their overview post.
---
I blame both. He could just as easily go after the farmer and they could have not farmed me.
---
I didn’t mean he facecamped me. I just meant he was facecamping the team the whole match.
---
Nurse is fine on console lol
---
Yep that did it
---
r/boneappletea
---
Bro don’t play with my soul like that lol
---
Pray that he runs after someone else hahaha
---
I fell for this.
---
Standard price.
---
*bHvR oNlY cArEs AbOuT mOnEy* ^(/s)
---
Ok this has to be a copypasta, there is no way someone who owns and plays this game thinks looping is an exploit. Looping literally is the game. If the game was hiding in a corner, this game would be super boring.
---
Yeah dw it is fake news
---
COMMUNITY: THIS GAME IS DOOMED, BHVR ARE WRINGING US FOR PENNIES. 
---
ALSO COMMUNITY: OH BOY ANOTHER CHAPTER THAT DOES NOTHING TO FIX THE OVERARCHING PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME, TAKE MY MONEY BHVR &lt;3
---
Ladies and gentlemen, case closed.
---
Holy fuck finally, I was starting to go insane trying to get Adept Trapper
---
I PLAY MOSTLY KILLER, BUT WHENEVER MY FRIENDS ARE AROUND I PLAY SWF. WHENEVER I PLAY KILLER I FEEL LIKE GENS ARE DONE TOO FAST. TURNS OUT I PLAYED SOLO SURVIVOR TODAY AND GOT A DECENT TEAM. GENS FLEW BY AND IT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME I ESCAPED SOL QUICKLY. I BLAMED SWF FOR THE GEN PART, TURNS OUT MY FRIENDA DO NOT LIKE DOING GENS AND THAT'S WHY WE ALMOST NEVER ESCAPE
---
I wouldn't want to escape
---
Well, theres no “getting good” at using Dream Snares. You just kinda...stand in between the pallet at a loop and place it on one side of the loop and force them to run that side. If they try to loop they’ll get hit.
---
Freddy is still strong and doesnt even need add ons, theres just no build that lets you stack 2 slow down add ons on top of 4 slow down perks on a killer that ends chase incredibly fast and has map control.
---
yes but when youre me thats a lot of shards :(
---
I'm currently trying to complete that challenge, but being a literal Blendette is basically the opposite of my playstyle. I'm pretty much just trying to power through it in hopes that I'll get a killer potato enough to not be able to finish any chases with me.  
---
[This](https://youtu.be/LYdCzs5uPrI?t=64) is and has been my mood for days now. It's the last challenge I have to complete on Tome I Level III. Here's hoping I can complete it before the next level of challenges come out in a week.
---
"Are you taking us to Chuck E Cheese, mom?"
---
Not nearly as hellish to deal with as it used to be. If you spread the pain and realise that the possibility of a DS exists it becomes much easier to deal with. Sometimes it’s unavoidable but most of the time it can be managed if you just juggle survivors and don’t pick up survivors that were unhooked for a while.
---
Ah for god sake, can we please get hex ruin and BBQ please ?
---
Well that just fukin' happened. (noice clip btw)
---
what did the add on do previously?
---
SOMEONE TOLD ME A KILLER GETTING 3 DOWNS IN THE BASEMENT WAS A "MISPLAY" BY THE KILLER LMAO
---
And you’ve ruined it with the obnoxious watermark.
---
LOL for this to be real, snoop dogg would have to have taken over bhvr's PR department
---
What microtransactions? The cosmetics? Those are optional and you don’t have to have them to improve the game.
---
But if these no killer around, then why not? I get that hooked survivors should give up so that the 4th can get the hatch but I don't see why not if the killer isn't around
---
The same thing except the blood orbs were not absorbed by survivors. essentially the change means that healthy survivors can entirely deny the oni his power
---
all those addons needed was making them not stack with eachother which imho would have been a better way to go about it.
---
Sounds like you're just bitching about killers tbh.  If you have more than 5 brain cells you could see that all 4 people were THERE AT THE SHACK.  
---
Fucking absurd to say "the better play was to use Pop" over getting 3 downs.  ESPECIALLY when nobody was on gens.
---
yes, let’s nerf solo que survivors even more!
---
They really should change the Killer-specific (i.e., get 4 traps as Trapper) challenges to a random 'use-killer-x-that-you-own's-power-x-times-successfully' ala the dailies rather than just Trapper all the time.
---
Seriously, the amount of clearly-never-played-Trapper-before-but-I've-got-a-challenge-ers I've played against is just silly.
---
Plus the emblem system seems stacked against her, with how short a lot of her chases normally are.
---
I’m at 50. Honestly I played more then I would in order to complete the rift. From what I remember devs said it should take about 1.5 hour of gameplay each day to complete the entire rift but I feel you have to play more than that. Some of these challenges require you to play more as well. 
---
I like the rift idea but I probably won’t grind as much on the next rift unless there are better cosmetics. Some of these cosmetics are reskins  and how many identical  leaf charms do we need? My OCD is already going nuts seeing so many identical leaf and trapper icons in my inventory. I’m not complaining at all but if devs are out of ideas when creating these charms maybe make the rift shorter. 
---
I also noticed that some of these challenges are more of a chore. more killers are farming and not playing the game in order to complete a challenge. When the 3rd tome became available everyone was fighting for unhooks since it was a challenge. I literally seen one guy dead hard to the hook so that he can get it instead of the other guy. These type of behavior makes the game boring in my opinion.
---
It's always inconsistent. Last night no joke I had killer queues less than 20 seconds. But I was also playing from 11PM - 2AM CST.
---
I'm fairly certain it's just the result of the sheer number of players on both sides. I was still in green ranks (when I should be in purple mind you, previous rank reset and all that) and I got paired with yellow and brown ranks sometimes. There might simply be a surplus of survivors/killers when queue times get too long for the opposing faction.
---
Because Reddit is for the cool, non trend-following memelords and Instagram is for the basic normies. Duh. Have you ever even BEEN on cool subs like r/dankmemes and r/PewDiePieSubmissions ? I thought not.
---
Something needs to be done to slow yhe game down having to rely on ruin every game is not good at all.
---
how would that be a nerf? most games already have ruin.
---
xvideos? Are you serious? Urgh...
---
Because he just runs right back to slug the 3rd and chase the 4th. 
---
Just die if you’re 3rd hook and you get the signal from the 4th. Don’t be selfish.
---
I do feel Billy is  more than playable on console without flicks and Nurse suffers from more of the frames I think.
---
That said, I'm definitely not against them getting similar changes. I would like the consoles to be on par with PC as much as possible.
---
Then go play hide and seek. If you're walking in circles around a loop and not playing any mind games, then you are choosing to lose
---
Well i guess I am not buying the game; (
---
Honestly, i started to be so good at doctor that i don't need ruin on him
---
Weird that they changed his but Plague’s is still the same. And most people dont cleanse against her so its like map wide aura reading
---
Don't YOU DISCONNECT FROM THE MATCH BECAUSE I GOT A GOOD SHOT AT YOU AS HUNTRESS. ALL I WANT TO DO IS SLING HATCHETS AND GET BLOOD POINTS AND YOURE ASS MAKE ME HAVE TO DO MY ACTUAL JOB, EVEN THO IM TO HIGH TO.
---
Or you get a flashlight save and immediately sacrifice yourself on hook to get to the next challenge asap.
---
Salty? I'm in a great mood! What's not to like about this update? :)
---
Just throwing this out there, there's a good chance there won't be tomes for some of the licensed killers, as there's obviously obstacles with cosmetics, and the lore aspect would be boring, since their lore is already established outside of DbD.
---
Ya, because that will happen all the time 😑. Red ranks have the smallest pool of people, what makes you think that will happen often, if at all
---
Oni sucked on console so they had to make him suck on pc too
---
I mean I have trouble playing with male survivors because of how big they are compared to the female survivors. I started on Nea and now playing my just leveled up Dwight is a very odd experience. It feels like the camera is zoomed in more or something.
---
as 90% of the community has said, finding parts/ fuel for gens
---
obviously you havnt ever played survivor or you’d know the feeling of getting found first, running the killer for like 3 minutes, and having no gens pop because ur team can’t work thru ruin.
---
They just need to make gens take like 30 seconds longer or something
---
So level 1 permanent see through walls Myers is absolutely ok and (rightfully) doesn't get touched on but for whatever reason they (always, with every single new killer) feel they have to nerf useful add-ons to death until nobody wants to use them anymore.
---
Being hard to control with a controller is one problem, but on console teleporting drops your frames to like -20 for the duration of the teleport and a few seconds after. Playing nurse on console just feels all around bad.
---
yes she literally does. good observation.
---
Same thing but blood orbs remained, and aura reveal duration didnt stack.
---
even with ranking it happens lmao
---
There’s a code I follow playing as killer...if someone disconnects I’ll let the last person go via door or hatch. If I kill everyone and have the last survivor down I WILL hook them UNLESS I hear the hatch nearby; then I’ll drop em at the hatch. Sometimes even when they’re playing as dicks cause I don’t take shit that seriously.
---
"Fixed an issue that caused the Killers carrying SFX to keep playing after hooking a Survivor. "  
---
This is all what i need
---
in what world are you living boi?
---
waiting for team deaths?! immersion is the best counter? several people on basement is the right play? dude. you are embarassing yourself. 
---
i play both roles, and if i have to pick one of the sides its killer. im not a 'survivor main', far from that....maybe you should try playing both roles as well, and maybe (just maybe) you would actually start to understand how the game works, since you have no clue as of yet.
---
may i ask how many hours you have into the game? you speak with such confidence, yet every word you type makes absolutely no sense.
---
in what world is that a misplay? say they have a 99'd gen, and the remaining survivor pops them both, they procc adrenaline, save their friend with borrowed, which might be running DS, you let them get all of the gen progression for free. downing people doesnt mean its a secured kill, far far from it. maybe in your rank 20 games, idk.
---
yeah I don't get it at all. survivors could actually avoid the oni's but against the plague she sees you every time you puke.
---
but survivors can endlessly complain about something and the devs will change it. it's just that not many plague's use it and not many people play plague, but right now oni is fairly common on PC so it made a bunch of noise and a totally fine add-on got killed
---
yeah holding m1 for longer is just what survivors need to make the game more fun
---
Oh wow ok that’s pretty bad then. I always assumed it was just the controller. That sucks
---
\*ka-dinking intensifies\*
---
Hey there. Just want to say I'm sure I can speak for the entire DbD community here that we're all really impressed with your supposed skills in this game. I bet you get a real kick out of teabagging noobs.
---
Unfortunately, my point was the tediousness and grind due to only being able to select one challenge at a time; not the challenges themselves. Thanks though.

&gt; Cozy Holidays (Susie) - She hated how happy the neighbors were as they enjoyed a warm Christmas dinner together. This year, she'd make them suffer as she had.

---
I don't know about making Ruin baseline, that would really screw over lower rank/newer players.
---
Something should probably be done about Gens at high ranks though. Not sure what BHVR could actually do that wouldn't cause a shit storm though.
---
"Queues are bad at the moment" they are bad this whole year.
---
Let’s just give them a super powerful base ability with no counter AND the ability to have an extra perk slot. 
---
Sounds good.
---
They nerfed the Forever Freddy build without making the percentages complete trash. They’ll still work in decent synergy with Thant if someone wanted to use them without being ridiculous. Not bad at all.
---
It's an online multiplayer game, why wouldn't you?
---
That's a good thing as chances are he's gonna charge off to bam-bam some other schmuck.
---
Thanks for the feedback bud...even if your original comment was harsh haha
---
I *usually* give the hatch to the survivor who played the best. But it's still my choice whether you live or die.
---
Appreciate the explanation, thank you!
---
No she isn't lol
---
Everything cost a lot of shards just be thankful you can get the cosmetics with shards at all considering Susie and joeys base cosmetics are much more shards as well
---
What the hell would they be?
---
Just allowing them to huck their saws like buzzy spears?
---
No, they nerfed PC to be more in line with console. I was just watching Zubat play with him, you can't even turn 90 degrees now. You can now counter Oni by literally going around a corner.
---
no counter? are you saying that the perk
---
##HEX
---
ruin has no counters? you know, like, cleansing???
---
Permanent Tier 1 Myers is fine.
---
I help a bill as huntress to complete his hope challenge in the tome.
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that could cause a desync between clients and host. 
---
I'm so glad this got fixed, had it happen a few times as a survivor and being downed all of a sudden by a killer that was nowhere near me was way too frustrating, especially with all the other issues that were happening. Thanks for fixing it :D
---
Well they aren’t attempting to lightly scratch you...
---
Got them all!
---
“Fixed an issue that could cause The Trapper to get caught in a bear trap that was just set”
---
Finally.
---
Experiences of one person don't really mean anything? I have almost 1500 hours on DBD, former hillbilly main and have played him for a lot of that time. Do you have any videos or something? You can talk about evidence whilst not providing any yourself. He is not supposed to be able to hit multiple survivors so if this has happened before I'm hard pressed to believe it's a bug or glitch. There's an issue with Billy where his chainsaw has broken hitboxes and apparently have gotten people right through objects. This may be a similar case.
---
Regardless, any videos of it happening?
---
You just said make it base for killer. Not a perk
---
WHY IS EVERY ONI SUCH A TRY HARD? THERES NO NEED TO FACE CAMP WHEN YOU CAN RUN ACCROSS THE MAP IN 2 SECONDS?
---
yeah it would still be a hex dimwit
---
It’s basically 100% in one category. Better than the 75% offerings.
---
The legion is one of the easiest killers to get first hits with which makes them viable with the right build
---
Man, you’re a toxic fuck ass that doesn’t know wtf you’re talking about. 
---
Stay salty nerd.
---
thank god they did, that add on makes it so hard to heal or do anything.
---
Well controlling him on console is difficult compared to the controls on pc
---
Oh look it’s the worst part of this community. Everybody point and laugh!
---
&gt; immersion is the best counter?
---
To Oni's power? how is not?
---
&gt; several people on basement is the right play?
---
how is having 3 people in the basement and only one person out of it with two gens not the most ideal situation?
---
&gt; say they have a 99'd gen, and the remaining survivor pops them both, they procc adrenaline, save their friend with borrowed, which might be running DS,
---
lol this is a ridiculous hypothetical. how does one survivor pop a gen and not get found, proceed to pop another and still not get found, and then get 3 saves without a single person dying as they go on this gen popping adventure in one of the strongest basements in the game? the killer would have to be literally braindead to allow that
---
the rest of your comment is not actually engaging at all substantively
---
huh? please explain yourself
---
These adons are getting out of hand.
---
Right? Like I don't get what that comparison is meant to be. Perma tier 1 myers is slower than survivors and cannot catch them in a chase, nor can he get bloodlust since no TR. If anything, these add on balance fixes make them more in line with builds like that one that are actually balanced.
---
i feel its more fun and creative to always mix and match pieces anyway. i dont think i use a complete set on anyone
---
What, can someone explain please
---
Lol I love this. Thanks for reacting the way I wanted you to.
---
Im talking about oni sry didnt mentioned
---
This person is literally fucking brain dead if they think hanging 3 survivors in the basement is a misplay.
---
the shit I read on this sub gets more fucking stupid by the day
---
:o a freddy player with a brain that can see that its not the end of the world, thats a rare find in these parts
---
I did that once when somebody was running out of time in the collapse, since carrying them slows down the timer.
---
How often, maybe once? C'mon with that bs argument, and with your argument right there, it proves rankings are useless and should be removed anyway if it doesnt prevent mismatches in the ranking system.
---
Does nobody read the patch notes
---
I wouldn't call it abuse, seems she just lost connection while the buff was on. And for all we know she could've just been standing still or running into a wall or something in the "actual" game.
---
mmm yes, Daddy likes
---
I’m at 70. I play a few hours each night and quite a bit on weekends. I did complete all the challenges in 1&amp;2 and all the survivor ones in 3.
---
you still get 50% of your power charge by M1ing a healthy survivor so...
---
still, ranking exists for a reason, people need to be paired with people of equal skill level, it would fuck the game up
---
It's more a wound to the ego, really. A neener neener. We're playing tag.
---
Ya I just found a group and made it obvious I wasn't going to kill them.
---
I kept slapping the generator until one person started working on it and did the 3x blink and got the trophy.
---
Why are we still here, just to suffer
---
Let's be real for a moment, not above average, easily in the A+ area.  I'm personally more concerned about his charge. It's just infinite, and bully at least has garbo aim to counter that part.  This addon is UNPRECEDENTED in terms of how much tracking it does, I understand you like the way it is now but coming from a spirit main who was for getting rid of prayer beads this is too much man.  A guy got 50 4ks in a row with Oni, there was a guy infinite sprinting on cold wind on here earlier who downed 3 people at once in the basement, theres something mechanically in need of balancing, not conceptually. I get that you like him but that's just the way I see it.
---
No, there's a difference between challenging and impossible, his proposed change is going to tip it to the latter. 
---
Smart survivors play around the two gates, not just place their bets on one and hope for the best. It's hard and map/killer dependent, but still within the realms of being doable.
---
It’s your post in which you literally state that ruin should be base kit which in turn would make it longer than 30 seconds so what is your point exactly?
---
Being an orphan truly does improve Solidarity
---
Fair enough, my dyslexic ass didn't even realize it was wrong
---
Self entitlement radiates from this place
---
Sorry, but that's just have it works. My anecdote isn't any more valuable than yours, I'm just saying that with the way hillbilly can swivel his chainsaw I have seen him down survivors plural in close proximity. If it's a bug or feature I can't say
---
it would still be a hex, never said it wouldn’t be able to be dissactivated
---
Can you make bear traps into legos
---
Such a power play
---
What’s wrong with it?
---
If I recall correctly when the game first released the Killer's weapon actually had to make physical contact with a Survivor, resulting in a pitiful 30% successful hit rate game-wide.
---
Even with modern 2D games they still use hitboxes instead of pixel-perfect representation as humans are imperfect and NOT doing this will generate more salt than the oceans.
---
They do need to refine the hitboxes but more often than not I find dodgy hits are a ping issue rather than the game itself.
---
If the guy in the video went and used pop instead of getting 3 downs, doesn't that let 4 people hit gens instead?  Is downing more people not keeping them from doing gens, therefor exerting MORE GEN PRESSURE???  Lmao you make no sense.
---
But yeah, better go pop one gen so the 4 survivors can sit on the other 2 have them done by the time you down the next guy...

Remember when nurse was top tier? Rip.  I've been at red ranks for a while and all the nurses just seemed so sad
---
🦀 CARRYING NOISE IS NO LONGER INFINITE 🦀
---
Obviously you're stuck in a rank you don't belong in because working through ruin adds maybe an extra 30-45 seconds tops.
---
I really hope they revert it, they just made him as bad as on console
---
Almost like its the most rare add-on?
---
Hexes aren’t base game and never will be next post.
---
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN I HAVE NOW BEGUN TO IGNORE ARM MOVEMENTS, WHAT CHANGED?!
---
Unfortunately no, he's one of the few killers where healing yourself is pretty vital
---
Cry
---
The hook designs are still there, they're just tied to maps now instead.
---
I think temporary ruin (like 2 minutes) would be fine but not full blown totem etc
---
I blamed then running in a crowd, they should no he can down multiple people, do y'all group together and run against Leatherface?
---
i’m saying that they could change it to make it a special type of totem, jesus is it so hard to understand?
---
yeah, that could also be a possibility
---
tell that to half the damn playerbase. I’m in rank 5 ffs.
---
sounds like you are just really bad at the game tbh, bitching about killers? wtf are you on about dude? you are not making any sense (i dont know why im expecting sense from a reddit user, specially on this subreddit)
---
you cant understand that, in normal circunstances, you would NEVER get 3 downs in the basement. they simply ran into his club, he cant move after swinging, even mediocre survivors would not do that. i dont know what kind of shitshows you are playing on. but context is everything in this kinds of arguments, you simply play a game completely different from mines.  
---
first of all you shouldnt even be there, you should be stoping gen progression. 
---
im done with this. im not arguing with idiots. hf on your yellow ranks endeavours
---
I'm not even close to finishing. Anyone knows what happens if you don't finish it before it closes if you bought the premium pass?
---
Nemesis is suppose to work with furative chase?
---
That opens up some potentially really fun builds.
---
Seriously. It made listening for Survivors a pain in the ass
---
I’m only trying for the killer side of challenges, at least no one can kill the obsession but me (unless they DC)
---
I'm sorry but ive tried searching for anything like this happening and I haven't found anything at all. It's a bit suspicious that literally no one has talked about, tried to replicate or replicated this phenomenon at all. You'd think there'd be some sort of info outside of you seeing him do it.
---
I do love how your bio says “Radiate Positivity!” yet you’re cussing people out, great example of practicing what you preach buddy ;).
---
So what your saying is they need to add a glorified hex totem to base game which will never happen because hexes aren’t base game thus the point of them being perks...
---
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY GREAT PERKS IN THE SHRINE LATELY ITS NOT LIKE THE SHRINE IS GOING TO HAVE 4/4 BANGERS EVERY TIME
---
Nah, because then the survivors would need adrenaline, self care, bond, etc for free as well.
---
WHY IS BHVR FUCKING HOTFIXING ADDON AND KILLER BALANCING OWITH NO WARNING? WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING A CHANCE TO TEST THESE THINGS OUT FIRST? IT SEEMS A BIT SILLY TO JUST OUT OF THE BLUE NERF FREDDY'S ROPE ADDONS AND THE ONI'S ULTRA RARE. WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING PTB IF WE CAN'T TEST THINGS AND GIVE FEEDBACK?
---
fucking finally, this was driving me insane.
---
So they removed everything fun and interesting about Oni. 
---
Cool.
---
I encountered exactly this situation MANY more times when it was a P2P system.
---
But yeah, that wasn't a hitbox, it was a hit-suggestion.
---
I also didn't notice the 4th person there until I read your comment, so hitmaizer is even dumber now, but even if the 4th wasn't there OP did the right thing
---
lol imagine thinking the 4th could pop 2 gens without getting found or anyone on hook dying then pulling off 3 saves in one of the game's strongest basements
---
it's just delusional
---
I thought that too. I think it’s because the way the survivor is glitched, he’s technically not in the match and it ended in the games logic but they both stuck there bc in actuality he’s not gone.
---
Monsters are created not born
---
The ranking system as it is doesnt determine skill levels nearly as much as it does time playing. A true ranking system would reward you more for playing against higher ranks, and less against lower ranks, instead of keeping the same criteria for all ranks, as in you would earn more as a rank 1 survivor against a rank 1 killer than you would against a rank 20 killer. Or vice versa. As is is now, I can do the same regardless of my opposition and be rewarded the same. Aside from the 2 opposite ranks (red and white I believe is the 16-20 color) all you have to do is play and you will eventually reach purple. Which ranges from rank 5 to like 15 or something.
---
you’re right, a game cannot change, it is literally impossible for a game to change, a game has never changed and will never change, once video games are released, that’s the final version and it cannot be changed further. what’s an update?
---
No.
---
I thought totems were just cool decorations. Also, two of my friends were on the hook and I just left cos they can "handle it".
---
They are going to make a Nightmare Edition which will have Clown and maybe Spirit in it
---
So I dont think they will make them free
---
Otherwise nobody gonna buy the edition
---
I mean sarcasm does exist
---
You have read the (rightfully), right?
---
I love how this turned into a roast for a blendette.
---
I'm gonna get my points. Nobody deserves hatch, especially a Blendette. If no one is looping effectively or completing gens I will not give the last person a freebee, if you aren't pulling your weight you don't deserve hatch.
---
you're just having a meltdown because they decimated the only potential argument you had which was that the 4th person wasn't there, but they were
---
Disagree with this however I would advocate for different objectives.
---
When myers came out I'd have staring contests, but for my first few survivor games I'd practically wear trappers traps, or i'd be a chainsaw magnet.
---
Tire 34 currently
---
so does manners, both of which seem to be highly frowned upon in this subreddit
---
*Happy Yui sounds*
---
Should slow down gens/tools/coop so that ruin is not needed to prevent being stomped. It should only be used like other perks to help new/inexperienced players.
---
maybe, i mean, my point is that it’s impossible to get a 4k without ruin, but there are no perks that are necessary for survivors to not die immediately, i guess you could make the point for DS or BT, but it’s hardly necessary
---
I think context plays a big part. Depends how many generators are left, who the killer is. If there is one generator left and the last 3 have had some work done, two people can pull that off. Is it’s not a killer that can sneak or insta down it’s possible too.
---
Right. I'm saying by the time there's a Rift set up for those characters - I'd assume *at least* a year from now - they might be made free. It's just a shot in the dark guess.
---
This post didn’t age well lol.
---
He's not too bad on console, he's just waaaay more difficult.
---
Is it really an exploit or just not working as intended?
---
I'm at max rank with all Challenges completed. I do play a fair amount of DbD though, since I stream it and make youtube content. Probably about 30ish hours a week for me.
---
I think people that I've talked to that play more casually are around the 30-40 mark, maybe a bit higher depending on challenge progress. There's still a month to go, and a whole other tome level to go through, so if you grind out challenges, you could probably make it to 70.
---
It’s not just a ez change the whole concept of hexes involves them being perks adding 30 seconds to gen timers would be a much more efficient system then deciding to make hex PERKS base game
---
took me a year to break rank 15 on survivor, i’m calling bullshit, i’m just bad. i got to rank 10 on killer in a couple of months
---
Context is everything huh?  Then how come you keep making up your own context to the situation instead of watching the fucking video?  "Wut if 99% gens?"  "Wut if they get 2 gens while they have 3 down?"   You must be living in the twilight zone or you're on some really good narcotics.  Watch the video, all 4 are at the shack.  Laury Strode up top, Nancy, Steve, and Claudette all 3 get downed right after he runs past her.    All 4 in shack, 3 in basement now down on the ground not doing anything.
---
Literally all you have to do to win at that point is chase after the laury who is maybe 10 seconds away, within scratch mark visibility.
---
But nah, you gotta make up shit like "99% gens?" to come up with a good reason that your argument would even make sense.
---
Yeah but you don’t get equal amounts in each thing usually
---
Fair enough, I'm not trying to persuade anyone of anything except that I think OP nailed the killer ingredients that went into the Oni stew. If this has all turned out to be some kind of delusion I'll just delete my comment.
---
True but The same applies to any social media
---
That’s what I did with the chainsaw massacre guy right before BBQ went on the shrine.
---
When I try to boop the snoot I get stabbed
---
Funky mode when bhvr?
---
it would be more efficient but way more boring, i LOOOOOOVE holding m1. finding a totem would get you on the move, making urban evasion blendettes less meta
---
Why not just replace unbreakable with no Mither
---
It's really easy. You don't even need a Blendette.  Take Fixated, Sprint Burst, Spine Chill, and Self Care (or Lucky Break - if you're feeling lucky or Adrenaline). Commodious Toolbox w/ Brand New Part and Wire Spool. Then all you do all game is work on Generator's - don't help your team, don't save people from hook. Just hide any time the cat lights up, run away if the killer finds you, and play safe on loops if the killer chases you till they leave you alone or you juke them.
---
Then you know for certain the gens will get done in around 4 minutes, and if your team is bad - well they die first trying to save others, so you run for the hatch anyways (or simply camp 1 door while the killer closes the hatch and walks to the other door).
---
Well you could just answer the question :/
---
3 downs (that would literally never happen in a game with triple digits IQ survivors involved.) FTFY
---
Sloppy butcher will not work.
---
His feral frenzy attacks dont count as m1 attacks anymore, so no "on hit" perks activate with it.
---
There was a time before clown release...oh my, pallet vacuum, pallet citys, abusable windows, how many people miss those old times... (it was fucked up as a killer, yeah)
---
Congrats!
---
Sorry you're being downvoted for the truth, this community needs Jesus lol
---
U can use the 14 days for free if u create new accounts, that's what I do. Search for a YouTube tutorial.
---
Were  you one of those survivors that thought ‘attempt escape’ was effective?
---
Very Nice
---
On the 5s or wat?  It was probably given the fact that you won't play it on an iphone 5s but still. On the app store it says it's compatible.
---
oh no lol
---
do you have any insight into how he plays on console now?
---
It went south pretty fast didn't it haha
---
Nah.
---
I could say the same lol
---
ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
same, idk why i engage with 'reddit killer mains' with 200 hours speaking like they know what they are saying.
---
I do that too but i only do it to close hatch in front of them or hook them next to it.
---
Sloppy Butcher doesn't work with most M2s now. Removing it from Feral Frenzy was only logical.
---
They removed it from Chainsaws (Billy and Cannibal) and Huntress Hatchets.
---
You keep talking about imaginary games, with imaginary situations, all in an effort to discredit the 3 downs in the basement from this video.  Maybe watch the video, maybe don't assume random shit from the other 5 to 10 minutes of the game we didn't see, and maybe don't be a whiney little bitch when people have different opinions?   Cause when you say "I have 2.5k hours" and still say shit as god awfully stupid as you do, it makes it look like you wasted every single one of those 2.5k hours lmao
---
[THEY RELEASE A HOTFIX AND I STILL GET INFINITE LOADING SCREENS](/intensifies)
---
Because Holding m1 on a totem is much more exciting than holding m1 on a gen obviously
---
god bless, now a survivor can actually dodge his ability instead of having oni go through an entire jungle gym loop without letting go of m2 and then instabreaking the pallet i threw at worst.
---
Spirit doesn't keep her speed after phasing like shes suppose to.
---
Wraith doesnt get a speed boost after binging his bell lole hes suppose to.
---
What is it about anything I said that makes you think it has any relation to liking being facecamped?
---
I can dislike being facecamped and still understand that it's a legitimate tactic that's not reportable, not bannable, not restricted by the devs, and certainly not toxic.
---
I defend lgbtq rights too, doesn't mean I like taking it up the ass.
---
If it's certain the that killer is on the other side of the map then why not go for the unhook. Gives both of you more bps as theres time to do more objectives. One example was in a game I just played where I was hooked with meg in a locker opposite where i was hooked. The killer was obviously on the other side of the map but the meg just sat there did nothing until she got crows
---
&gt; As a sidenote Oni feels awful, his flick was nerfed to hell. Hopefully they revert it back
---
you were literally one of the people telling console players who had an issue with this to git gud and learn to play him
---
I'd run infection fright for an easier snowball  
---
There also a build with the two apples for an early game snow ball
---
Sorry for the crop there were some rage quitters and didn't want it taken down for shaming or whatever :s
---
We're talking about the video lmao.  Stop bringing in makebelieve situations to fit your narrative.
---
When the one survivor who didn’t do anything all game opens the door while you’re hooked but just stands at the exit until you die
---
finding a totem, evading the killer, and moving around the map is more exciting
---
I had 3 phases: what you said, only using it once right before I went into struggle, and now only using it when Kindred shows the 3 survivors working on a gen across the map that the killer might be slightly upset that it took him more than 10 seconds to down me.
---
The patch notes answer the question..... on the most recent one it explicitly says that feral frenzy now doesn’t count as a basic attack
---
With pigs, ya Boop the snoot ya live if you don’t then you die
---
I don't know why they changed that UR addon, it basically made it a worse Black Incense. Imagine if BI said "When a survivor throws up it reveals there aura for X seconds and removes 1/4 of the infection progress"
---
**LIGHTBORN IS YOUR BEST FRIEND! LAUGH AWAY AS THEY TRY TO HELPLESSLY BLIND YOU!**
---
I love her but I tbh wouldn’t mind a rework for her. But then again the emblem system could use a rework anyways!
---
They maxed Boldness so they were doing something, i had a Jake using the same glitch to hop between gens and drop pallets
---
Pop actually removes 25% of the maximum amount, so if it's at 25% or less, the gen will go to zero. The wording on the perk is just kinda weird.
---
I already have the sweater for the survivor I use
---
Here it is in case you're curious: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e8q7rw/megs\_instant\_face\_rework/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e8q7rw/megs_instant_face_rework/)
---
I know I was my first couple games. Couldn't figure out why everyone else lasted so long on the hook until I researched.
---
In all fairness the first two times I got to try, both times I got unhooked on the first attempt, so I legitamately thought you just timed it to when the killer was gone.
---
you are so dumb its insane, i would love to see you go against a good SWF of experienced players. you would be in desbelief of such 'delusional' stuff happen to you for the first time in your life.
---
The legion mains will rise
---
Tbh I see no reason to dont make the killers free for a limited time for their rift
---
I think their studio would survive it

I LOVE BEING A FREAK! WE'RE ALL FREAKS HERE!!!!

I still use it when I’m right about to go into struggle 😂

feel better soon

honestly RIP, this kills forever freddy. was fun as fuck for the killer but not as fuck for the survivors lmao
---
LMAO HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU BEING BRAINDEAD AND YOU REPLY WITH "SAME" XD XD XD XD
---
you sir, have been sorrily mistaken. I don't know about you, but for me and just about everybody else she handles as well as a freight truck on console. They really need to give us the option for sensitivity on console. I moved to pc BECAUSE the controls were so much better. And so I didn't have to worry about frame drops.
---
Plot twist, he appears to go after someone else, then LOOPS THE FUCK BACK AROUND AND GETS YOU WITH THE CHARGE
---
Please tell me you killed him
---
Not really... if you find finding a totem exciting good for you I guess
---
Friendly disagree, even at red ranks I run into a lot of campers, having borrowed time built in would free up my builds.
---
this is what happens when devs listen to screaming survivor mains before they have a chance to learn how to play against new killers
---
it's a tradition as old as time
---
I LOVE LIGHTBORN, IT'S SUCH A GOOD PERK BUT IT'S FAR TO NICHE TO EVER CONSIDER RUNNING.
---
Rather than take a perk and make it baseline, I feel it'd be better if we take a look at the base gen repairs and what can be done to tweak that. My suggestion would be to change up the skillchecks that occur.    Rather than having one good section and one great section, I'd split it into three parts, with the third part acting like a hex skillcheck without the regression (meaning it just pauses the gen progress) with it being placed next to the great skillcheck. This means that it'd require survivors to risk trying to go for great skillcheck with a chance of messing up, or play it safe instead.  In turn, Ruin would simply increase the size of this new check and give it the additional power of regression, meaning that Ruin isn't completely removed if this change takes place.
---
Not impossible to 4k just harder. Focus more on map pressure, split pressure, gen rotations, pathing and stable regression and you can do it.
---
This is why you should play the Soulja Boy Console version instead.
---
From the looks of it they’re gonna merge his two modes and instead his passive insanity effect will become an active ability to shock everyone in his terror radius with a cooldown, and his add-ons that impact the skill check appearing on screen now just make it go counter-clockwise.
---
Can you get the sweaters with shards only on christmas or are they always avaible for shards? Might get Joeys one but haven't unlocked Legion yet.

Honestly im ok with this. He never should of been able to traverse like how he was on PBE lmao, he was literally a better billy chainsaw, now all he has going for him is the unstoppable dash if hitting terrain which god bless now i can actually dodge him after he goes through an entire jungle gym and t wall to still instadown me.
---
im replying to 'i dont know why i even bother'. stop being childish , if you have nothing meaningful to add to the conversation.
---
But yeah you’re right they are trash.
---
While I agree that "most busted in the game" is definitely overstating things, if you think Bloody Gloves weren't insanely strong, you're pretty delusional. When Oni's in his power, just about the only thing you can do is hide and wait for it to end, unless the Oni is bad. That's why tracking perks like Infectious and Nurses are so good on him. Bloody Gloves made it so anyone injured that healed or did a gen had borderline permanent aura reading, meaning there was next to no chance for them to hide once you popped your power.
---
Not effectively looping the pallet.
---
I got both of legions sweaters so i’m thinking Yui. I might get jane and nancy as well.

i mean theres a difference between "Hey its forever freddy" and "slightly delayed freddy"
---
How often have you showed mercy to the killer and let him kill you?
---
That was an exploit, but they've also hard capped his turn to about 90 degrees, which is reeeally noticeable. Before he was able to flick around corners, now you just can't.
---
"haha this guy got 3 downs instead of using pop must be rank 20 unlike me an epic rank 1"
---
You are the worst kind of person.
---
I'll try to let u know (if I can remember haha)
---
I mean I just don’t think there should be a penalty for ultra rare addons. Like maybe limit its use for 1 pallet per minute or something but nothing penalizing like movement speed reduction. Otherwise kist dont add it as an ultra-rare addon.
---
He was my first main. He's fun to play at times but lacks map pressure and if survivors just throw pallets early (which most do against him) he can really struggle as it completely negates his "anti-loop" kit. Outside of Legion and maybe Doc, he's down there for possibly the worst in the game. I can still do well with him but not without some pain.
---
Funny how people in denial always say shit like "you have no idea" when something challenges their opinions.  This is shit toddlers do man.  I thought you're a grown adult with 2.5k hours on a game...?  Or are you a man child living with his parents playing all day for that 2.5k? lmao
---
I really wanted to buy Tapp and Ash's but I just can't bring myself to do it when they keep nerfng killers. Freddy again, and Oni's ultra rare ALREADY? this is why we don't spend real money.
---
Then dbd devs spit in the cake and kicked them when they were down
---
I think its crossplay
---
Cross-platform
---
Same here that's why I was amazed I even got that far even though I died anyway xD
---
he’s a dumbass aswell dw, but you’re reply didn’t need to be toxic
---
gl and hf :)
---
Why do you care?
---
To paraphrase, yes, that is his argument at this point lmao.  And now if you look he's gotta attack me for how many hours I have cause his argument holds no water. LOL
---
Damn. Good call.
---
you didn't actually reply to their argument in any meaningful capacity but you know that
---
This, I like this idea. I always thought increasing the gen time by 10-20 secs when in rank 1-5 would help slow the game some more. We have toolboxes that can power through the 100 seconds. Both ideas together would be a challenge for experienced players.
---
Feels like shit on keyboard now
---
High risk high reward, but agree on the three loop. Still a good job imo
---
This is the dumbest song and I fucking love it
---
My rule is if the hatch is still open and you don't struggle, you get it. However if I find it before then it's getting closed, and if you struggle you die.
---
i already know its garbage now lmao. It goes from late game having the entire map covered in orbs making it a minefield, to late game equivilant of hag traps because while your in a chase the other survivors can just eat your orbs removing your potential power.
---
I have the shards, and I got just under 4K shards during that time.
---
You’re the best
---
you’re not shit lmao, dudes just being an ass.
---
Will they also did this apparently: "Fixed an issue that allowed The Oni to rotate faster than intended when using the joysticks during Demon Dash."  Is that why?
---
??? how, his only arguement was "it seperates good from bad"
---
i play since beta, its been 3 years for me. also i go against players like otzdarva, piggyz and tru3talent on regular basis. do you think you know better than that with 200 hours? you're a joke dude, im just not troubled to explain, cuz you honestly wouldn't understand.
---
Make Your Choice could be pretty good with the combo
---
Yea they limited it
---
I guess abusing something that wasn’t meant to work the way it is being used at the moment...soooo yea exploiting.
---
They nerfed him on PC and buffed him on console, who knows why
---
I remember reading about "endless loops" where it was a literal definition. I think a lot of killers got more gray hair from playing those matches :p
---
Game pass doesn’t upgrade the game
---
&gt; Perma tier 1 myers is slower than survivors

Straight facts right there
---
I sure as hell think I know better than you on this.  Especially when your arguments about it consist of "I play with streamers and have 2.5k hours" cause that literally doesn't mean shit when we're talking about A VIDEO, and whether or not what he did IN THE VIDEO was a good move.  It's not your game, it's not my game, it's the OP's game, and you only got to see 30 seconds of it, and then went off assuming a slew of bullshit in an attempt to flex your condescending personality on somebody.
---
So yeah, when you're doing nothing but parroting "I have 2.5k hours and play with streamers" you're just making yourself look dumb, cause that has absolutely nothing to do with "was that the right decision or not in that video?"
---
*NO*

ARE YOU ACTUALLY SAYING POP IS SHITTY? LOL
---
That's not true. he explained the aspect that previously made him too strong and why the new change is too much.
---
I mean he literally said things like "survivors just literally have to turn left or right to dodge him in dash, and short loops literally 100% counter him" which is wildly different than "his only arguement was "it seperates good from bad""
---
but again, I know you know that
---
That’s because it’s over run by 12 year olds. It being Christmas has nothing to do with anything. Lol
---
They also said he was rotating faster than intended and fixed it. I heard it feels exactly the same and he can’t flick on PC now

ON TOP OF THAT, you already said "I'm not arguing with you anymore" but you're still here, so obviously you have a huge fucking ego, to the point that you can't handle being told you're wrong and get defensive about it.  Why else would you sling out your 2.5k hours? Lmao.  It's the last defense ya got.
---
People that understand math understand that the action speed debuff add-ons weren't really a problem. It could add up when stacked with Thanatophobia and Dying Light, but that's all add-on slots and half of one's perk slots spent on things that individually don't even matter, and together still barely do. Freddy's problem is the fact that he can spam an unlimited amount of Snares without any slowdown or cooldown whatsoever. This makes looping all but impossible, you are forced to drop pallets early, and if the pallet is not completely safe, you are still getting hit on it. And not only pallet loops, you are basically forced to leave much of any structure after a single rotation since he can snare the hell out of it, and then you are stuck between a free hit if you stay and potentially a free hit if you don't. At least Freddy loses Bloodlust now whenever he sets a Snare. I think he should have a 5-second cooldown on setting Snares.
---
Interesting that they've changed Oni's turn rate rather than adjust controller mechanics, wonder how that will affect Oni on mouse (from watching Zubat, it seems like they've messed up flick, where the turn rate has been reduced now, and the increase in turn rate only kicks in at the very end of the flick, which is regularly too late to still be able to hit a survivor around a sharp corner). Bloody Glove sounds pretty bad now - survivors will be re-absorbing Orbs and denying you your power, where you can only gain it through hitting people and absorbing Orbs left mid-chase.
---
I like the various fixes, especially the Trapper one, but still no fix for Med-Kit add-ons?
---
He was ass on console I'm still afraid for the frames but at least he is usable now
---
I HAD IT HAPPEN TO ME AS PIG, MY FIRST TIME EVER GETTING THE BUG. IF YOU GRAB A SURVIVOR OFF OF THE GENERATOR, YOU CAN ESCAPE IT. THANK THE ENTITY FOR THAT LAURIE.
---
After reading someone's feedback there are bits where I could have played better but at least I never got hit lol
---
This is a case of normal game play — if i have a pink or purple key, I can use the key right off the bat Mind Channel it. I can’t do that. 
---
It won’t let me and the prompt for Mind Channel doesn’t appear.
---
Get stomped at red ranks enough and you eventually go against rank 20 players. :)
---
Do you have the base image without the text?
---
Yes, that is why they removed it. The game is supposed to be fun for both sides, ideally. Freddy is very powerful as-is.
---
what nerf? it says on ps4 anyway that they improved his turning during demon dash on consoles
---
They didnt intend to fully remove it, just lessen it.
---
Instead they fully removed it.
---
Also wraiths.
---
That's fucking awesome.
---
Intentionally or not they still used it to win the match, its easy to get pallet stuns and win chases when you can clear the map in 10 seconds
---
Three times this year, as recently as Halloween.
---
&gt; Also wraiths.
---
yeah, i know about that bug which is why i didn't say anything
---
&gt; They didnt intend to fully remove it, just lessen it
---
ah i didn't know it was fully gone
---
Shirtless grandpa Myers chasing you while the violin-guitar music plays.
---
More nerf for the killers that is what this game needs is not like the queue times of survivor in red ranks are of 20 minutes or something like
---
What you have to keep in mind though is Oni is still new. It’s always been piss easy to go on an absolute rampage the first 2-3 weeks a killer comes out, because survivors haven’t had the time to adapt and formulate proper counter play yet. His kit has a lot of utility, quite possibly too much, but I want to wait and see how people adapt to it before we start calling for a nerf. Only once the survivors have adapted as best they can to facing Oni can we really figure out what part of his kit is the issue.
---
I want to play funky mode
---
yeah, it just takes practice. I really don’t think you’re bad or anything though, I’ve seen significantly more potato-ish survivors in red ranks tbh. Keep practicing, you’ll be great in no time.
---
Idk, I've been having a lot of good games as him recently and I'm a rank 1 killer
---
It’s a little buggy on pc atm.
---
64 as I play the game religiously...I think I have a problem
---
You can just ignore them if you want, nobody's forcing you to do it. It's additional content, not obligatory.
---
Mind channel will only work when the Key has one of the before mentioned ad ons. If you activate mind channel and there is a drain on your key then that means that it's working and if you don't see the killer or survivors then they are out of the range of your aura reading.
---
check the PC notes
---
I had the exact same experience. People really do suck sometimes.
---
Same honestly just to a lesser extent than you.
---
Sure bud, attack my personal life with things you know nothing about,  its def not pathetic and doesnt make you look like a child or an idiot whatsoever
---
Still think it is a little OP. I think they should either add a cast time when he attacks, while charging, or just dont allow him to turn so easily. Like there really is no counter to it. People say "dont get hit, so he doesnt get orbs", but come on.... Im a killer main and primarily play Legion, Pig, and Huntress..... low tier killers and I know that there is always at least one hit/hook per match.
---
I've been doing well with him.
---
Give it time and learn him.
---
Yeah I'm 99% certain they're all the same exact size.
---
Patrol gens after you hook it keeps pressure on the other 3 survivors and makes sure that gens don't get done insanely fast
---
“&amp; nominations”    Lol
---
When I am in a meeting with my boss and he says that we are having clients reporting issues with our systems I’ll make sure to tell him that they should just avoid using non-necessary systems. 
---
I appreciate the advice
---
Any clue if they're fixing the rank system anytime soon? I'm getting tired of playing with red ranks as a rank 10 killer.
---
Depends. Ghostface for example has a pretty unique lore in dbs compared to his movies (yes, it's not technically the character from the movies because copyright, yada-yada), they could go in a direction like that if the original owners allow it. Or just rely more on their fate post being dragged by the entity. Would be fascinating to hear Michael's lore in dbd considering all we know about him currently.
---
It’s not what they say it’s how they say it. Both sides mirror each other and so do Adrenaline and NOED. That’s why it gets brought up literally every time, because it’s true. You can’t defend one thing and not expect it’s actual counterpart to be brought up.
---
It isn't that much a difference tbh but I've played only 1 match so at first glance I don't see much change sadly
---
It's not worth unlocking all the teachables unless you really plan on playing that killer or are in love with how that survivor looks.  
---
Quentin?  Hard Pass.  
---
Ace?  1/3 of his perks is neat but the other two are garbage that just clog up future blood webs.  
---
Pig?  Make your Choice is great, Surveillance is decent, Hang Man's Trick is awful.  
---
Huntress?  Cool killer with a unique playstyle, 3 pretty much useless teachable perks.  
---
and so on and so forth.  
---
TLDR: Unlocking all the teachables adds a lot of clutter to your blood webs that makes leveling up new characters more expensive and time consuming.
---
lol this fucking shit
---
you aren't even trying to engage with the point at all
---
i have plenty of 4k wins with oni, but his power largely has significant issues actually being used the way it's intended because of the hardware limitations. just because you can still win by cutting out some of the power and relying on survivors being idiots who fall for moonwalking doesn't mean he plays well
---
Ugh. Nurse and Hillbilly are my least favorite killers to play, partially because there's no middle ground. You are either absolute utter garbage, or the fucking terminator. There's no middle ground
---
Do you have any success with that way of playing him? Cause I'm guessing I'd get looped all over the place if I actually tried playing like that haha
---
UK here, haven't noticed anything anything too bad about the servers. Whats good is ping now is always green which saves me leaving and searching for a match again if killer ping was red.
---
Sometimes I get questionable hits but not more frequently than before
---
BNP and Overcharge are the same. DS is much larger.
---
Some of the items (but not all) will appear in the cosmetic shop after 6 months they’ve said
---
The rift items will be added to the store at some point
---
My name will tell you just how much i love this
---
Were you not around when Legion dropped?
---
Did you restart your console then check for an update? Cause 3.4.2 dropped
---
No idea man, I play console as well and though it isn't the same issue everything is breaking. Luckily I'm getting a PC soon to avoid this chaos. I have faith in behavior to fix it
---
I got 3 in a game yday
---
I was facecamped
---
good thing your friends dont mind finger eating or ripping out tongues,
---
Not sure about Spine Chill (I think it does) but Resilience definitely does.
---
I've been watching some of my usual streamers and his flick really seems awful now. They're all struggling to catch people. His PTB flick was actually ridiculous but I don't think the initial live version was that bad to play against. It sucks.
---
Dude, as long as a killer is capable of M1ing, all of them are capable of 4king; that doesn’t mean the killers he listed don’t need a look at.
---
To look for hatch if they think the survivor is waiting for hatch

i dont use resillience that much so idk, but spine chill does, it gives u 6% speed

Yes please Bhvr that be scary and hot at the same imagine Danny Devito in his trashman uniform running after with trash it be like billy and huntress he can charge at you with trash and then throw trash at you or hear me out the Demo power where he crawl out of the couch naked anyone agreev

Close app, press settings button wjule selecting the dbd app, check for updates and u should be goos

not really lol
---
Don’t write a false narrative. He’s meant to have a flick, it’s just that the additional keyboard flick on PC was not intended.  He does suffer from limitations on console and it’s disingenuous to say otherwise. He’s a mess.
---
What is the biggest difficulty of playing nurse on console? Is it the controller or the FPS drops?
---
😔 this reddit is really full of low ranks and it hurts
---
When I started I thought pallets didn't alert killers of position so I dropped them when the killer wasn't around thinking "ha now he can't come from this way and I'm safe"
---
They basically made console Oni easier to control but he doesn't have the same level of turn rate a PC Oni as. So basically easier turning but not as strong as PC because even walls couldn't protect against the Oni and his turn rate
---
SOMEHOW I AM ALWAYS HIGHEST RANKED SURVIVOR BY FAR, BUT WHEN I PLAY KILLER ALL SURVIVORS ARE 6 RANKS ABOVE ME. I FEEL THIS PAIN.
---
It's like everyone else says, Dead by Daylight was designed as a team game and SWF in some fashion are prevalent enough that when you count all of them (casual SWF, 4-mans that only play on the weekend for fun, 2-mans and 3-mans) and all the perks that allow solo coordination (Bond, new Kindred, a well-used Aftercare)...
---
It should just be designed as a team game, like imagine a 20-second delay before DS or BT could be activated on a hooked survivor. This is barely long enough for the killer to break one/two pallets, kick the generator, and move far enough away that they might not decide to turn back around (but a lot of time they turn back around because they haven't gotten into a chase yet unless BBQ&amp;C showed someone outside of a locker, 40 meters away is 10\~ seconds itself).
---
If I put you on the hook and someone unhooks you immediately (within 5 seconds, certainly) I shouldn't be punished because "it's a random you couldn't control"; this is a team game, **your team fucked up**.
---
You shouldn't get Borrowed Time (I wasn't camping), you shouldn't get DS (I wasn't camping) and you shouldn't even get your free exhaustion recovery back (because you weren't on the hook for even 2 seconds); all those things just punish a killer who wasn't doing anything wrong and removes all the pressure they just got for the hook, something M1 killers sorely need to keep for longer than it takes them to turn their back.
---
You should get rehooked because this isn't a 1v1 with the killer where you deserve "**a fair chance**" to get away from a fuck up by your team, this is a 4v1 and you don't deserve any such thing (this is why you have 3 chances in the form of hook states anyway).
---
Funny, original content?!  What are *you* doing on *this* subreddit?

Unbreakable and Iron Will currently. I then run a mix of Plunderer's Instinct,  Tenacity, Technician, Self-Care,  and NOLB, depending on how I feel.

---
medkit bug fix when? :(
---
I thought normal luck didn’t effect what you get from chest
---
Person from photo: "You are teabagging"
---
You: Doing flashlight saves is a part of the game grrrr
---
1. I’m aware you don’t always need the 2nd blink. As far as map pressure goes, that’s 12 meters or pressure you aren’t covering. And since you move less than 4 m/s, just M1ing ur way there takes longer than 3 seconds. Survivors will take 3 seconds flat to cover that 12 meters and they’ll be in ur TR so they’ll know to run. Map pressure takes a giants punch. 
---
2. You talk as if someone will always run recharge addons in your example. That highlights an issue. Addons should not be assumed to always be ran. Repeat after me. Addon reliant killers *should not exist*. If survivors don’t need to rely on items to escape the trial a killer shouldn’t need to rely on addons to win the game. Secondly, to emphasize your second point, who the fuck is breaking pallets with Nurse? Out of a chase you can just walk around them (unless it’s god pallet or some really safe pallet that there’s no way around in which case yeah bust it) and in a chase you blink through them. Your “don’t break pallets” point makes me think that you feel ur talking to a rank 20, not a rank 2. I made it to rank 1 without addons with old Nurse. Current Nurse, I think I have the authority to say, is a wreck of a killer.
---
Literally everybody suffers from limitations on console, whether it's the p12p servers screwing survivors, or nurse being impossible to play. Oni doesnt have it any worse than hillbilly. To say otherwise is disingenuous.
---
He is not meant to be able to 360 at the end of his rush, just like he isnt meant to run through windows.
---
You're one of them lol. You actually cleanse lmaoooo
---
Loadouts are subjective, base it on your playstyle.
---
Sounds like a delicious coffee with hints of Botany Knowledge that will decisively strike your taste buds and get your adrenaline going!
---
2v6 gamemode when?!
---
u may try bbq, to go for someone else right after hooking, this way u start building pressure really well.
---
Kate moans and breath low and have a smaller body, so she can hide better
---
Claud have built in cammo
---
Ace doesn't moan at all
---
So some survivors kinda-ish matter and have some small advantages.
---
Thrilling Tremors + Pop Goes the Weasel is such an underrated combo. Maybe replace Thrilling with BBQ if you’re really hurting for bloodpoints but otherwise keep Thrilling Tremors on, it’s so underrated.
---
If you look through my history with Nurse you’ll see I made it from rank 11 to rank 1 playing addonless Nurse exclusively. And this is exactly why I hate talking about Nurse with ppl who don’t play her. If you have any gripe with the rework ur just thrown into the same nonexistent category of people who go “woe is me my Omegablink is gone”
---
Probably the Topknot addon + the Cane because you can charge the demon dash instantly and run over to then so fast their reaction time is limited also for perks I found infectious fright to be top tier on him as he can down a survivor then run to another. So basically faster charge rate and speed  plus slugging perks or tracking perks.
---
Thank you
---
Will try it, thx
---
What's wrong with them?
---
Bicheal champ
---
If the killer is able to play pacman it's only fair to let the survivors play it as well
---
(I don't have an opinion on this since I didn't encounter it yet so I can't add anything aside from dumb jokes)
---
But how can i prevent them from making gens if im chasing someone??
---
I just got prestige 2 and I wanna die rn
---
Yeah I get more 4ks just m1ing than trying to chainsaw everyone. Some people are really good at constantly using the chainsaw, I’m just not. Looping isn’t too much of an issue surprisingly!

Dive bombing unsuspecting people with Dashes is one of the best things about playing the Pig!

If this was implemented a spirit with hex roulette and anal beads would be hella good
---
God that’s accurate
---
They don’t do anything
---
It used to be thanata
---
Yes they both do.
---
Boy that sounds frustrating. But there's good news! There's a killer perk to counter adrenaline. It's called hex: No one escapes death. If you run that it doesn't matter what health state the survivor is at, You will down them every time. Plus the speed boost they get from adrenaline is negated because you're permanently faster.
---
clown is just boring to me.
---
But those are cosmetics not music
---
I don't mind Pale Rose. But Grim Pantry? Fuck that one
---
I’m talking in a general sense Thanat is great. 
---
Plus Thanat is passive slowdown that can often times scare survivors into healing instead of repairing. Even the extra 12(?) seconds per gen it buys you is very good if you are in the right place at the right time.
---
I do just fine as her at rank 1 just takes a lot of practice she’s playable but fucking hard
---
Oni sounds like a fucking bear
---
I guess it is for the best. I'm just eager to play it on my phone at this point.
---
I understand what you mean by that, but there are 2 things that make it much weaker when applied as a curse.
---
1 - it would only affect a single survivor, granted it is for the remainder of the trial.
---
2 - it is not nearly as potent when applied as a curse (normal Hex: Ruin - good repair skill checks = -3/-4/-5% and great repair skill checks = 0% progression bonus. Curse of Ruin - good repair skill checks = -1.5/-2/-2.5% and great skill checks = 3.5/3/2.5% progression bonus)
---
Ask the killer for help, offer yourself in exchange.
---
I thought it was o e od those back massagers you lie down and roll back and forth on
---
Finally something for my man bill
---
I think the cosmetics are gonna be in store sometime from now but the charms are exclusive since (atleast atm) you cant buy them.
---
Yea.... Just gonna farm hers. The rest I could do but teleporting in a straight line to predict movement is not for me chief
---
dat sounds hawt
---
WE ALREADY GOT POP NOT SO LONG AGO
---
"straight" facts
---
To be fair, every time I mention NOED I am well prepared to just get downvoted. There are too many feelings and not enough rational logic in these discussions. I was against NOED since the release of the game, they made it less bullshit over time until they made it 1 shot from tier 1 but the main issue is still present. Lack of information until it's too late. 
---
As a solo survivor (not main, get this engraved in your minds people) there are two things that commonly happen in my games. 
---
1. All survivors leave, the killer gets an easy kill. 
---
2. Survivors go for the rescue and from 1 kill it turns into 3-4 kills.
---
Jane's gorgeous you're crazy.
---
Honestly i used to gripe about the whole controller vs m+kb thing but i think if they just gave us more freedom with the rotation speed i could get a lot better, especially with Oni too right now. I can barely turn 45° to hit a survivor when coming out of the demon dash because even on 100% the sensitivity is just too slow. So thats my final answer: Sensitivty/rotation speed lmao sorry for the long explanation
---
Is it really that much effort to click ur mouse a few times when loading up the game?
---
Ive reached level 70 of the rift, should we even complete the archives or wait till the next rift opens to save the rift shards from being wasted
---
I've been out of the loop myself for far too long, It's time I spread the truth!
---
They actually said in a dev stream that it’s looking more like a year
---
Not exactly a missed opportunity when they made myers before the 2018 movie came out, plus they only have the license to that one single movir, they would have to re negotiate for other licenses
---
Learn about safe pallets and unsafe pallets so you know which ones you have to break and which ones you can chase and hit the survivor through.  
---
Pallets like the one at the killer shack have to be broken or you will never catch a good survivor at that loop.
---
Surveillance has value. Being able to hear repairs from farther away helps speed up time to initial chase since you don't have to get as close to each gen as you sweep, and the aura detection is good when you are running a 3 gen strat. It slots well with PGTW and Brutal. There are other good aura perk choices, don't get me wrong, but its not trash.
---
MYC is *okay*. It always seems to be a 50/50 waste for me since by the time I get back to the hook, I end up chasing the wrong set of scratches. If it did something like show the MYC target's aura for 3 seconds, it may help pick which set if tracks/ a direction to chase down.
---
Hangman's is garbage, yeah, unless Sabotage plays become a thing again. Its too situational to dedicate a slot too. Like Franklin's it maybe good to fit into if you load into a lobby full of Jake's or toolboxes.
---
BHVR should take it easy with the killer nerfs. I get that they care more about survivor enjoyment than killer enjoyment, but if they keep this up there won’t be any killers to play against. I’m glad they fixed that trapper bug though, it was quite annoying. Hopefully they get around to fixing the trap aura bug too.
---
Just because a killer attacked two healthy survivors doesn't mean he gets a map wide pressure power with a flick 1hko. Oni has the power to instadown in a chase faster then billy can even with instasaw addons.
---
Nobody thinks that he should and you’re just using a strawman argument. 
---
Also, you are aware that due to console limitations, some killers perform significantly worse than their PC counterpart.  Even worse, some can’t even achieve their full functionality that is part of their design.
---
I mean the theme could play with the cosmetics equipped. With the violin-guitar riff playing whenever his evil within levels up.
---
For lazy people like me, yes sir
---
When a random comment on the internet tells you they basically already made a DbD movie, but with a "realistic" setting. 
---
Happy Death Day is basically DbD where the Survivor (the main girl obviously) repeatedly dies over and over to a killer while attempting to simply survive. 
---
I know it's a stretch, but goddamn, they are similar
---
well there’s a difference between a stun and the cooldown. killers make a loud sound when they stunned.
---
u can hide in a closet all match, exit and re-enter  a few times when the birdies come to get rid of them, and hope that after EGC starts, someone gets hooked, them u race to unhook them with borrowed time attached. start running to them as soon as they get downed so someone else doesnt beat u to them
---
I've only played the Oni maybe 3 times since he's came out,  and they didn't full on camp lol. But I haven't had the best experience with him. I haven't learned how to counter him much, since I haven't played him. But I know exactly what you mean,  I looped a huntress, lost her, clensed her totem, she found me again and instantly started camping me. I also paid for the premium pass,  that's why I'm trying to do challenges and get further but I haven't been able to escape since I put that one on. Lolololol. I guess that's how it works sometimes tho, you can do something until you NEED too lol.
---
the game feels more like its 50% queue 44% error 4% loading and 2% game
---
I get it and I think it's fine but on this subreddit like 30% of the playerbase act like the game is on hold until ruin is destroyed.
---
I usually just work through it and let someone else spend half the match searching for it.
---
Why tf would u ever use it anyway? lmao
---
Ugh I really need it on Hag. I like to set up 3-gen camps and harass gens AGGRESSIVELY and I just long to unlock this perk on her lol! One day ;)
---
Licensed killers?
---
I know this. But it's pretty similar if you dont know the difference. Understand now?
---
Another thing too is even on PC with mouse and keyboard she’s still the hardest killer the learn, thats just how Sally is ♥️
---
Hatch is more than fair currently first to find it usually takes the cake. Moris do need changing
---
Im not using it the killer did
---
not really
---
I read the post me dude
---
Sorry, I’m kinda new. What’s the Tapp perk do?
---
What update?
---
If you want to consistently 4k you need to slug the third guy. Sucks but it is what it is.
---
Oni is the only killer I don't have yet,  but that does look like a super good combo!
---
This one:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/112060/](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/112060/)
---
lol theyre not teasing, they want u to not camp the basement so they can unhook the person
---
If you first don’t succeed try again lol
---
Like moths to a fire.
---
The cooldown is super short.
---
Just because it doesn’t regress a gen as hard as pop doesn’t mean it’s worse. You have to consider the intel you get, (if a gen doesn’t surge, you know no one was there), the time saved going to a gen and kicking it, and not being forced to hook someone when it’s smarter to slug and keep snowballing pressure. Pop can literally lose you a game in that respect. Looks like this sub’s hivemind got me again 🤷‍♂️
---
yeah, she's hard in general. but on console she's much harder to learn to control. As soon as I tried her on pc it was like only having you're hands tied vs having your hands tied, feet tied, and a ball n'chain attached.
---
I think they did,it was just not mentioned in the notes.
---
" Fixed an issue that could cause a desync and/or being unable to move as the Killer after damaging a generator."  
---
FINALLY, Got stuck in a gen like four times as Bubba. The only way to get out is to hit a survivor (they can't see you because you become invisible)  which results in you being teleported across the map
---
It's still not something that matters in game canon. Music is still cosmetic. Just not something you can change.
---
You think this because you're brand new.  Camping is actually the worst way you could possibly play if your intention is to consistently win games.  If you stay and camp the others (if they aren't potato) will just plow the gens while you stand there like a scarecrow staring at your 1 kill.  You need to hook them and leave to pressure gens/start your next chase.  Survivors have 3 hook states not 1.  They aren't supposed to die on their first hook.  Camping only beats bad survivors and it won't teach you a thing about how to play the game.  You'll basically be frozen at whatever skill level you're at right now if you camp your hooks.
---
+1! This is great advice, thanks for adding your thoughts :)
---
I love you.
---
There is 99% chance the killer will check the gate. Hide somewhere else
---
Neto Angelo killer: the shadow
---
All of them thought you might have A) Misaligned the trap placement and still go for the save or B) Have their audio mute or can't see what you were doing.
---
And just maybe body block up front for better success than **actually** coming from behind for a death wish?
---
I thought I was going to have to decimate this blasphemous statement by myself but i see my comrades have already arrived!
---
Your kind is not welcome here!!
---
Working only for 1-2 minutes of a trial and then they are completely useless. I want addons to work form me more.
---
This is so wholesome omg &lt;3
---
The curse for Hex: Devour Hope only lasts for a brief amount of time and the curse for Hex: Huntress Lullaby would only make skill checks harder for a single survivor but doesn't increase in potency like normal, instead having to rely on the tier of the perk
---
(normal Hex: Huntress Lullaby - each token makes the audio cue between the cue and the skill check shorter and can even remove it completely and add an additional 2/4/6% regression. Curse of Huntress Lullaby - can only apply 2/3/4 of the tokens depending on it's tier and only applies an additional 1/2/3% regression).
---
I know but eh I dont want to risk getting down
---
Probably because they spent so long getting 0K that they want a few decimation matches to even it out
---
Entity: *gets confused and sends players to Rotten Fields*
---
Because this song, while awesome, is nowhere even close to being as iconic as the one we actually have in the game
---
*that’s right, that’s me baby*
---
It’s only missing the Yakkity Sax music.
---
Think every one was disappointed in Legion, his trailer gave a much different vibe from how he actually plays, imagine if he instead was a stealth killer that disguises as survivors, would be so much more hype.
---
So you want to nerf good killer perks for the sake of making them in the same tier as weak killer perks? What?
---
Please noooooooooo not the NOED Adrenaline false equivalency again.  The two perks shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath man.  NOED stands alone as the biggest crutch perk left in the game since the others all got reworked.  I'm not even here to hate on NOED by the way.  I run Small Game to not give a shit about NOED lol.  I just can't stand the false equivalency that exists of NOED gamers trying to liken it to Adrenaline.  It's absurd.  And please don't make me do the breakdown again detailing this.  It's a dead horse just like this comparison.
---
I used to hide behind tires until the music went away :(
---
You don't always win. All survivor moris are rare, but I'd agree they'd need changing if they were more prevalent. If you're finding something keeps happening you might need to change your playstyle accordingly - hatch and new end game collapse were new to get used to for me, but now I slug 3rd survivor and look for the other one so they don't get the hatch.
---
oh so they got oni to a good place but decided not to leave well enough alone, that's cool
---
at least forever freddy's sort of dead
---
&gt; balanced around fun 
---
This game is doomed.
---
&gt;  Besides if you have time to crush a killer and get all 4 to escape then you had time to cleanse totems. 
---
What about when I don't have time because the killer is using game slowing perks and everyone is on their death hook? Or two survivors are already dead. Noobs using the perk makes them get free kills, a pro using it makes it an overkill. 
---
&gt; Even some of the best use NOED because it counters gen rushing 
---
No, it doesn't, the gens are already done by the time NOED is active. Perks like Ruin and PGTW slows down gen rushing, hooking and injuring survivors slow down gen rushing. Knowing how to play the game slows down gen rushing. It's not very common you get 4 god-tier survivors unless they're in SWF. Besides, most killers are within 70-75% kill rate based on the recent statistics.
---
The wiki, as a fact, proves you wrong. The hatch DOES spawn at the beginning of a trial, however it is both invisible and not interactable with. 
---
Maps DO track the hatch in this state.
---
WITH DEDICATED SERVERS KILLER LAG ONLY HURTS THE KILLER. TRUST ME, BEING A KILLER WHO'S RUBBERBANDING AROUND IS FUCKING CRIPPLING. IF YOU'RE SEEING LAG ON DEDICATED SERVERS, IT'S YOUR CONNECTION THAT'S THE PROBLEM. OR MAYBE THE SERVERS THEMSELVES.
---
Ty&lt;3
---
They wouldn’t Be able buff the oni on console without received a backlash from the Huntress and nurse mains as they are still to receive something similar to their turning too, 
---
imo I just wish they uncapped consoles sensitivity speed because when I go back to console if feels like I’m turning in slow motion
---
"Grab and interrupt 3 people after blinking with the nurse"
---
*Complete this challenge in a single trial*
---
Honestly I'm inclined to say it's just bad luck. I'm a decent enough killer. Just shit luck as survivor
---
I miss it
---
**I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE! BUT I DON'T MIND GETTING BLINDED AT PALLETS BECAUSE I JUST LISTEN FOR THEIR FOOTSTEPS AND THEY LOOSE DISTANCE SO ALL IN ALL IT'S WHATEVER FOR ME!**
---
*camp it
---
Ftfy
---
I’m talking about making other perks more viable. Not seeing the same combination of Ruin and BBQ 7 games in a row
---
ExActly
---
id share my pizza with him 🥺
---
It was 462.something mb for me
---
Okay.. the hatch one, same. Everytime I played with a friend I'd just yell **OMG I THINK I HEARD THE HATCH** then I finally learnt what the hatch actually sounds like and the conditions for it to spawn. I was such a fucking idiot running around the map looking for the hatch when we still had 3 gens to do.. 😂
---
Both do.
---
Totally agree. There’s a lot of complaints about Freddy getting nerfed on twitter but he’s still one of the strongest killers in the game as well as one of the easiest to use, just slightly less annoying to play against now.
---
I hate the pink add-on nerf too, it was the only actual good add-on for him.. now he has NOTHING
---
Version is 1.80? Cool not big at all.
---
Yes, that version
---
The second paragraph was incorrect i meant to put “who ever told you face camping is good...”
---
Most people run the perk for the BB bonus as the grind for them is brutal. Aura reading is just the side benefit to it.
---
So they jumped a .1? Just curious. LOL. That big one last week was1.78 and then 1.80. unless there's a patch that I didn't know about. Odd.
---
Yes, they both affect vault speeds and they stack
---
Yamaoka.
---
The person I was queuing with, "I'm putting Yamaoka on because it's my least favourite map."
---
I’d love to see why it’s not an equivalent. Both perks screw over the other side when activated. The difference is that the only counter to Adrenaline is NOED itself or killing the survivors before the generators pop. Don’t give out the whole “Adrenaline rewards the survivors for doing well” because that’s not a good reason at all. Adrenaline gives survivors an *additional* reward on top of powering the gates. Powering the gates *is* the reward for doing objectives. By then the game is usually decided. They are most definitely equivalents. Maybe not point for point, but they both have the exact same function. The means of getting them is different but that’s irrelevant when they both do the same thing. Adrenaline robs the killer of a kill the same way NOED robs survivors of an escape. Both perks need looked at.
---
Sad... but the OP has pm-ed me if he wants me to take it down, atleast I appreciate that he messaged. So I have given permission for this to be up. 
---
Even if the karma is not mine, atleast it is prove that people like my drawing. And that's still nice
---
That really really matters.  The fact that you get a nice but fleeting 5 second effect as a reward for playing optimal survivor vs a killer perk that includes a much longer lasting and much stronger in game effect as a reward for playing terrible and losing all 5 objectives you were tasked to defend should abolsutely matter and serve to show you why the two perks AREN'T comparable.  NOED stands alone as the single biggest crutch perk left in the game.  I'm not even complaining about the perk people are free to use it if they can't play without it but Jesus Christ the tired old NOED Adrenaline false equivalency has to go.
---
At what point during the game did he face camp?
---
Thanks for the response! I asked because I have a lot of time in this game (3k hours so far) but have never actually played Nurse. It’s for a combination of reasons, but one is that I play on PC but am much more comfortable with controller over m+kb. 
---
But since the Nurse changes, she has some fun build potential so I’ve been tempted to try her out.
---
Legion
---
The most overpowered hex in the game obviously, thrill of the hunt. Gotta get those bp
---
do u know how many fucking blendettes have this shit perk all of them you could run  much better perks to help your team hell lightweight is better because it remove scratch marks quickly
---
Dead hard only gives you a boost about equivalent to a killer lunge, so if a killer is smart they’ll wait a half second or so before they attack. At least that’s been my experience.
---
That's a joke.. when they smell money, they will put it in the store.
---
To scare the survivors that you are running a mori.
---
A stealth player whining about how solo survivor sucks is really quite breathtaking
---
I'd just move on. Sending paragraphs to randoms does nothing
---
Yeah it does. Imagine a noob nurse continuosly spamming blinks. She will eventually catch you. Now instead you have to use your blinks more precisely.
---
This is my first tome (one only had the game a few months ). What characters have always had them?? Other than Claudette and Trapper.
---
I mean, salt is what most people live for and you gave him just that
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you the guy who argued that "homophobia" was an "evil" term that "evil" people use to prevent "good" people from saving gay people from God on that Trixie Mattel video posted here a few months ago?
---
what helmet is that
---
How do you “spam blinks” with 2 blinks lol. 
---
Plus Noob Nurses don’t “eventually” catch you. They *never* catch you. Nurse has always been the killer where if you are better, you never get caught. There is no way around that. Lol 
---
Are you actually a Nurse main?
---
Not likely
---
Why is no one talking about the huge add-on nerf? It was the ONLY good one
---
most people run the perk because it gives them hella information on survivors to not waste time after a hook, the BP is just gravy. Its the reason why nobody fucking runs wglf.
---
An entire health state and 5 second boost all in one go is way more than a “nice fleeting” effect. NOED is counterable, but all a lot of survivors care about currently is rushing the gens and getting out. What’s a totem again? Oh, those aren’t important. If it ain’t glowing I ain’t going for it.
---
I had this today, lol
---
Gens still take 80 seconds to get done wo great skill checks btw. lol
---
I mean... I wouldn't say that considering I can still like a killer while finding them to not be very good, but okay.
---
BBQ exists to help survivors by giving the killer a new target far away from the hooked person, to reduce camping. Juts like Devour Hope, MYC, etc. 
---
Don't know how some people fail to see this.
---
I'm not even a super stealth player. I'm an altruistic player. I play Ash, I want my MoM stacks. But I literally just got unhooked and healed not even a minute earlier, when a Claudette runs right past me. I hoped in vain that the killer would've kept going.
---
If you want the results, you'll just need to go ahead and dump your load on him.
---
Like I said, I play killer too and I know how it feels to get gen rushed. Increase the base time it takes to do gens. That stops survivor gameplay in becoming a hunt for a single totem in a expansive map and lowers a killers dependency on ruin allowing them to try new perks. Win/Win
---
Ultra rare add-ons being "very strong" is bad game design that they've been rightfully trying to steer away from, for the last few killers released/reworked.
---
Those add-ons should be kinda strong sure, but mostly, they should change how the game is played, make the killer unpredictable in his loadout. Like Scratched Mirror Myers, that's a very good add-on. It completely changes his gameplay without being broken, and forces the survivors to understand what they're facing and adapt.
---
Iri hatchet on the other hand, for instance, is just a consumable nuke that allows you to get an easy 4K everytime you activate it. And just like ebony moris, it's kinda dumb in the first place. Most killers should be baseline stronger without add-ons and always viable, and be less reliant on broken crutches to win. Add-ons that switch the gameplay a bit without altering too much the power level of the killer are better in my opinion.
---
Are you on console or PC?
---
Ontop of that you just don't get the same control as you do with a mouse. I play on max sensitivity and I still can't do what people do on PC naturally. I've had a few moments where I felt like I was getting her down, but I always felt limited. They need to make it so max sensitivity is higher.
---
Oh, i think i gave it to bill but i showed him where hatch was before he left
---
No one talking about his add-on nerf?
---
Your logic is severely flawed then, you make other perks viable by making them viable. They’re not going to become magically viable by nerfing other perks lol
---
Toxic survivors is what caused all the toxic killers
---
Well you were on the hook for like 3 seconds, you still have one minute left before struggling
---
100% this! Up the max sensitvity!!!!
---
How many games do you think it’s gonna take to get “decent” at her? I don’t expect to become a nurse god like the others that main her but I do eventually wanna become proficient with her. Any tips or suggestions would be great! I’m a level 8 killer that mostly plays Meyers and Doctor but wanna branch out. This is the only game I get anxiety about playing killer.
---
Because i had to let him repair gens cuz after i looked trough every corridor i found it in very corner of map next to exit gate he been opening.
---
I don’t know your play style, (and this might sound obvious, but it’s not for everyone,) but I would suggest going for the kills before kicking gens, even if they’re chugging hard. Meaning, sometimes killers will see a survivor run away from a gen, and prioritize kicking the gen to stop progression. With this you absolutely want to maximize that gen damage by downing them first. Don’t be afraid to let survivors get a few more seconds on the gen. Your pop can negate it.
---
NOO I WANTED THE GOLD EDITION NOT THE DELUXE
---
If we got more gen base Time then it would be okay but that def needs to happen first also we really do need to buff bad killer perks before nerfing the good ones
---
Haha so true
---
Yeah, neither you nor they come out looking good in this.
---
I can guarantee you the wraith will not like that
---
Bitch better have my extra packets of Parmesan cheese.
---
can anyone confirm this?
---
We're Gonna Live Forever: I don't care what, just give it SOMETHING in-game.  From a BP farming perspective it's not fair that killers have it baked in to one of their best perks.  Imagine how good it would feel if it were combined with Kindred or something
---
Out the loop on this, haven't played for a while. Can someone explain please?
---
I'd absolutely still run it every match for the bloodpoints. Not saying they should remove the aura but saying no one would run it if it didn't have the auras is just wrong when plenty of people do infact dedicate a slot to it or WGLF just for BP.
---
I don’t struggle when I’m the last survivor and I’m being carried. Most of the time I’m too close to the hook for it to matter. Most killers just don’t for me. I’m not a sitting potato, I’m not a blendette, I’m not a flashlight Nea. Killers just most of the time don’t let the last survivor go and I’ve never seen anyone complain about it because it’s the game.
---

---
"Don't give me the whole Adrenaline rewards survivors for doing well"....
---
You don't get to cherry pick facts lol.  That absolutely is a statement against what you say.  They agent comparable because one perk rewards you for actually doing your job and completing objectives.  The other activates as a reward for playing like dogshit and losing all 5 of your objectives.  You could afk in a corner all game and still activate your NOED.  I've played meme Wraiths that do this lol.  So activation scenario already not conparable.
---
Now look at effects 
---
Adrenaline provides a haste effect for 5 seconds.  Then it's gone forever.  NOED provides a permanent haste effect as long as the totem exists.
---
Adrenaline adds one health state just for the survivor running it and only in that 5 second window.  NOED removes one health state from ALL survivors permanently as long as the totem exists.  
---
Both in terms of the trigger event they aren't comparable and when comparing their identical effects NOED is the clear winner in every metric. 
---
Again run crutch if you need it I won't say an ill word about you doing so.  But please for the love of God drop the false equivalency with Adenaline.  You people can run the perk without the mental gymnastics.  Just own it.  Yeah I run NOED so what? That I can respect.  The dead beaten Adrenaline horse just no.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀forever Freddy is dead🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
I just like me some bing bong, just imagine he has 8x STBFL and x3 Devour Hope.
---
I play killer too. I know how BBQ is supposed to work but that doesn’t mean a killer needs to see their target for 5 seconds. It could be a quick 2 second. Giving the killer a vague idea where the survivors are without tracking them with no way to counter it without a very specific perk.
---
Why would you instigate this? It makes you seem like the bad guy.
---
She messed with the wrong Swedish teen.
---
I’m talking about in game terms, she doesn’t hit you with anything but sickness so the theres no reason for you to bleed, its just come as an annoyance. Also, we were never specified which plague the plague has, and within her lore it never stated that they vomited up blood.
---
OK KID
---
like old nurse omega blink wasn't objectively the best
---
like tuning guide + primber bulb isnt objectively best on chainsaw boys
---
like old prayer beads and the everything boost wasnt objectively best on spirit
---
just shut your goddamn cuck mouth
---
You helped him out. You have him a good laugh.
---
Ok, a few matches like that, sure. But still doesn’t change the fact that a 2k usually means it was an even game. 
---
I don’t get why people care so much for the 4K.
---
Then ight they're fucked
---
“As long as the totem exists” 
---
That’s all you need to look at.
---
*insert montage of teabags and flashlight clicks as nurse player slowly becomes monstrous*
---
I've had an Oni straight up standing on the basement stairs with me on my first hook and him with his power ready for any survivors that tried to save. I managed to get saved for a little bit while in struggle and he downed my savior with his one shot. I was able to avoid getting downed as well. He still got me in the end because he camped her and a Dwight that tried to save her. He realised no one was going to save them, so he went out looking for me. 
---
The match after that we had a doctor camping the basement on the Pale Rose boat. He got me shortly after I finished the last gen with a random Claudette and camped me while constantly shocking me on hook. I just stayed on the hook until the Claudette 99'd the gates and I instantly killed myself when she made her way towards me, because we wouldn't stand a chance.
---
My first match as adept Yui I kept juking the Oni in his rage form and I think he got fed up, because as soon as he got me, he face camped me while nodding no. He didn't camp anyone else though.
---
I say make IT when you unhook you see the killer aura for some seceonds. Like DARK sense but with unhooks!
---
They killed the only good add-on which was already an ULTRA rate.. he is already weaker than Billy.. That's so stupid
---
Dude, Google ebola, that shit makes you bleed
---
When I play killer I basically only use BBQ for the bloodpoints stacks, but it is a strong aura reading perk for certain killers with good map control and it bugs me that the survivor equivalent doesn’t give you any extra benefit than just bloodpoints. 
---
But yeah, personally I will never understand why this game is so stingy with bloodpoints/double bp events in general when there are so many characters and perks to level up these days on both sides... and it sucks to have to waste perk slots on bloodpoint perks just because you want to slightly lessen the grind.
---
Two blinks, short fatigue, two blinks again, short fatigue, two blinks again, they can't get distance,  short fatigue. Rinse and repeat. Also old basekit nurse was so strong she could win against crazy swf with no addons. Even if they only nerfed the addons, you could have had: old basekit, that was enough strong even against the sweatiest teams+ new addons that could help you even if you had enough power. Think about it. Now if you have no addons, it's very very difficult to win against the BEST premades, as it should be, because you have NO ADDONS.
---
These perks are the meta because they are so good. Nerf them and killers will try different perks  to see what works for them. That’s why everyone calls perks like corrupt intervention and thrilling tremors bootleg ruin
---
maybe saying nobody was too much, but a VERY small % of people would do it. You won't get good doublin value when you just get no BP cause your down a perk slot.
---
I wish i could see playtime for dbd on PS4 :( and yes definitely try her out. I actually didnt become a nurse main til after the rework, which is weird i know, but i had tried her before and gave up, but this time i put my head down and just stuck through it and havent turned back since
---
See! 🤣
---
&gt; you'll be forced to accept to lose every single game at the beginning. EVERY. SINGLE. GAME.
---
euh.. speak for yourself. thanks
---
It's one of the very first Trapper cosmetic head pieces that was put in the shop. I think it was from around the time when Clown came out.
---
Nerfing good perks isn't going to pave the way for weaker perks to shine, it's just going to make killer games harder. The focus should be on making weak perks better so they have a reason to put them on a build.
---
If the weak perks are still bad, people would still take consistent perks like Ruin or BBQ, only now they'd be nerfed.
---
You sound like you're 5 years old.
---
This is a really good meme. I don't understand, don't care for or don't think 98% of the memes on this sub are funny. But this, this is great.
---
Uh I can atleast as well it my comment. From what I've played as Oni Infectious fright works greatly as stated because it makes all the survivors scream that are in your terror radius meaning you can maybe down them all in one dash, also with slugging perks you can just down a survivor then just leave them to bleed allowing you to focus on the others. For the Cane the movement increase you get is alot and with the Topknot that increases the rate the demon dash charges meaning you will get to survivors faster giving them less time to find safe spot or react to it.
---
Even then, Forever Freddy still exists. Hell, I just fought one. He just isn’t as busted anymore, he’s still a slog though.
---
No it's not.  It's a 5 second window of time and the perk is gone forever.  NOED offers the exact same effects permanently (as long as the totem exists).
---
I don't appreciate the silly what's s totem dialogue you said there framing me as a salty noed complainer which I'm not.  I just get annoyed by noed gamers attempts to liken the crutch falsely to Adrenaline.  If you scroll up I left a comment to OP that details not only how to counter NOED but also why he shouldn't be mad and upset about the perk.  Instead of innacrutsely suggesting I'm a biased survivor main read the threads.

Hey, that tiny knife in the background pictures looks familiar...

Oh my God this made me realize I've been playing for over a year ...

*^(... and I still suck)*
---
The key word in my comment being ideally. This is not an easy game to balance by its nature alone. You can do well with any killer at any rank with enough practice, but obviously some killers are going to be better than others.
---
That I can get behind. And that’s a good point compared to some of the other comments that are acting like I’m skinning their favorite pet. If they can buff perks like No one left behind for survivors they could definitely buff some killer perks.
---
Ugh, that damn cornfield. Got that one 5 matches in a row yesterday. 
---
Swamp is right up there though as far as disliked maps are concerned for me.
---
When Micheal came out it was just before I started playing. I thought tier 3 was a mode where Micheal can stalk you quicker but can’t attack. Yeah I was dumb survivor. I also thought attempt escape meant escape instantly, I was confused when it didn’t work.
---
nah ill activate deadhard, and before i can even get any distance ill get hit and go down while exhausted
---
All i want is elf Dwight
---
Uuuu we have a talent here. Nice. Btw if you don't lose every game during the first few hours, it's not your merit, it's the survivors fault.
---
I really need to throw my wallet away or something
---
I don't play Oni, I just played him like 2 times and got totally steamrolled. But I agree with this post.
---
Well said.
---
gonna have to stop you there atleast teammates with urban evasion do something more than self care users
---
He downed another survivor and i wanted to unhook them but he sat at the hook staring at him and did the same to me
---
NOED is destructible from the start of the match by eliminating totems, rendering the killers “crutch” useless. 
---
Adrenaline, while fleeting, cannot be countered and can seriously mess up a killers momentum at the end game. The effect may seem small to you but that’s far from the truth. 
---
Those are hard facts and there’s nothing more to it. When one perk gets looked at, so must the other, because they both absolutely mess up the momentum of the other side.
---
Distance wasn’t the name of the game with old Nurse. It was juking lol. There’s a reason the saying goes “if ur a bad Nurse you lose if ur a good Nurse you win” bc if you were bad at Nurse you would always get the fat “Entity displeased” after every game and a 0K. And that’s not bc “eventually you’ll catch them”. 
---
And to your final point. This bends into addon reliant killers which is a different subtopic but I’ll put my thought process right here. If survivors can walk into a trial with no items and it be perfectly normal for all 4 of them to escape, then no fucking killer should be reliant on addons to be viable. If items aren’t a necessity, addons shouldn’t be either.
---
I thought this was just a result of the dedicated servers... didn't know it was an actual bug. Glad it's fixed.
---
I just get really annoyed at people who do this
---
Needing good killer perks is already a bad idea as killers get bullied as it is. Ruin is essential, not because it is strong but 90% of games will have 3 gens done before the first hook. Killers can’t pip now because gate keeper now is a lost cause. 
---
Nerfing BBQ will cause a bunch of players to stop playing killer and return to promoting a camping play style. 
---
Its not that these perks are broken or too good. It’s that there are so many terrible perks that you will most likely lose without them
---
Ummmmm well naturally that's a thing because it would be the most broken thing in the game if it wasn't tied to a totem.  That doesn't invalidate all the points I made just because it's a hex.  Soloqueue gamers myself excluded because again I'm that one Weirdo that runs Small Game every game specifically to shut this down but the vast majority of soloqueue survivors do not cleanse all the dulls which means the hex will activate and typically be good for at least one guaranteed down.  SWF are the ones that can trivialize NOED consistently by using each other as totem counters in comms.
---
The first game, my friend was using Metal Jeff and I kept running away thinking they were the killer. They couldn't stop laughing long enough to tell me they were trying to heal me.
---
Legion.
---
I was asking you to think of the game theoretically, not saying it happens every game or is the norm. Follow more carefully. If you insist on thinking of it practically, can you imagine **why** 3 gens usually don't get done by the end of the first chase, or at least before the next one starts? Start timing the first hook, even in games where the killer wins. It takes survivors 5-ish seconds to run to a gen on average, and they can do a gen through ruin in 80 seconds (or less with toolboxes) by hitting greats or ~110 seconds or less tapping. That means in any game where the first survivor is not hooked or slugged within about 115 seconds could have basically began with 3 gens done even if they tap. Any game where the first survivor isn't hooked or slugged by 70 something seconds could have been rushed with toolboxes by hitting greats. (It does get more complicated, but I want you to take this babystep first.)
---
So why doesn't that happen more often? It's not because PGTW buffs or healing nerfs or killer OP. It's because survivors don't follow the solution to the game that Marth showed them, which as I said could be adapted to farm pips off killers.
---
Who didn't immediately try to escape the hook first time?
---
Jake
---
No reason to nerf the flick. What's even the point of playing Oni now?
---
I screenshot myself in a legion game when going to the shack, I could've went as wraith but decided not to
---
I've been trying to get Iron Will for Meg, Claudette, Feng and Steve and STILL NO LUCK TO SEE IT IN THE BLOODWEB FOR ANY OF THEM.
---
Right! I thought they would be the price of full normal cosmetics. So I ended up getting a bunch for 10 bucks.
---
I find that desync seems to happen really often with Ghostface for some reason. Like, I'll get hit halfway across the map sometimes with no idea why.
---
They should just make legion a ninja turtle cosmetic. Julie would be Raphael.
---
Bring a key with Left Behind. Hide in lockers all game until the team dies. Wait for the Killer to close the hatch then go looking for it and escape.
---
I believe you’re thinking of “devotion”
---
Still talking about the in game sickness, I’m confused to why you bleed when sick when the sickness never had that affect in the lore.
---
You shut your whore mouth!  Lalalalala I can't hear you I can't hear you!
---
New item: RIOT JUICE
---
When consumed, decreases movement speed by (20/15/10)% for 45 seconds. Hits that would normally put you into the dying state applies the Deep Wound status effect.
---
"If there's a chance for a riot, I'm getting blasted on grain alcohol."
---
*Cough cough* Plague is not fun to go against.
---
When you think this subreddit cares anymore than the Ghostface.
---
I don’t really care how they do it. Nerfing is just what my friends thought of. If they could buff some perks making them on par with these two and it lowers the dependency of these two perks I would be fine.
---
Really? IDK. Then what is luck for? I know it increases the chance of escaping hook. That’s it?
---
You are goddam right
---
Nah bro why should he be able to punish bad positioning, i should ne able to counter him in a wide open field /s
---
Basically, you have to escape the game without being hooked by the killer using spine chill. I love spine chill I use it all the time. But I just can’t play immersed lol.
---
It absolutely is fair.
---
Otherwise you're asking to have even odds/a fair chance to escape the killer 1v1 no matter what else anyone else does.
---
But if you can 1v1 the killer than so can everyone, and then the killer (who is supposed to be exactly four times stronger than any individual survivor) can't do anything against skilled survivors, the killer is supposed to have agency and you are supposed to go down if they find you (if you weren't supposed to go down, second chances via hook stages wouldn't exist at all).
---
It is fair for each solo survivor to be weaker and incapable of overcoming the killer alone, if those three randoms didn't cleanse the totems and you ate a NOED hit, then you don't deserve some nebulous second chance for the sake of even odds vs. the killer. In return for outnumbering the killer 4v1, you can get screwed by things your team doesn't do, like any team game.
---
You don't see people go "any hero in Overwatch should be able to 1v6 the enemy team if my team just refuses to participate in gameplay"... or maybe Chess would be a better example, if each person took a collection of pieces but 3 of the players refused to ever capture pawns, and those pawns made it to your back row and became Queens, that would be the players ignoring the secondary objective (capturing pieces) for the primary objective (checkmate).
---
But in no universe should you be able to get a fair and even chance against 8 Queens with your handful (4) of pieces because everyone else ignored them, that wouldn't be fair to the other side, and if 4 pieces could kill 8 Queens, you would be overpowered all game.
---
Killer: it says here that this only works for survivors, this is not fair
---
Survivors: y'all hear sum
---
Otz will be so happy
---
ASTOUNDING WORK!! Have you considered doing other DBD characters?
---
I’m pretty sure that’s it
---
Wholesome!
---
Alright I’ll try that, thanks man
---
Because they’re signaling you can ignore their opinion
---
Survivor 1: Look a pallet, oh im traped, sure if i stat under thebpallet someone will save me.
---
Trapper: Im gonna trap in case someone comes for the save.
---
Survivor 2: Ok i saw the trapper put a trap but is my time to shine and save him.
---
Trapper: And this dude fell for it, gota hook and rearm the trap.
---
Survivor 3 who witnessed all: I'll fucking do it again
---
*Cough when was winning easily fun cough nurse cough*
---
It’s not insanely sharp turns. The dash overall had limited movement in loops. You couldn’t activate dash and fuck up someone on a tile at all, even pre-patch. But now it’s even worse. Try to use demon dash even near pallets guarantees their safety as long as they aren’t stupid. Demon dash and his rage in general needs to be strong as hell. The time it takes to earn it must be balanced out with insane down potential which he had before. So no, Oni has counterplay even pre-patch. Right now he’s a worse billy.
---
It's wise to stop here because for like the second or third time you ignored what I said.  Don't tell me if it bothers me run perks to counter it.  I've already told you multiple times now that I run Small Game every game for that exact purpose so on a personal level I don't have to worry about NOED in my games.
---
The only reason I commented at all is to shut down the false adrenaline equivalency.  But yes let's agree to move on because you repeatedly keep ignoring the things I've said anyways lol.
---
I can’t really see them doing it just because they wouldn’t really be able to do any lore rewards for the licensed characters (aside from Ghostface since the dbd version has an original backstory) unless they gave you Entity lore or something
---
Boiled Denim and Rum Ham is a must!!!
---
Bottomless Frank pleaseeee
---
That would be good. But I think it should be two or three gens instead of just one. Making it like a thrilling tremor, corrupt intervention mix
---
Have you ever had teammates searching for a totem for inner strength when they could’ve just selfcared in half the time
---
Why don't you post this on the xbox reddit and not dbd?
---
Grab the pizza, take one step to the left, and then slam the door on him. By the time he breaks the door down, I’m already in Flavor Town.
---
Yeah he really started to hate DBD by the time he quit
---
Oh, so that's my game as trapper last night went well
---
From the lore:
---
"But her faith was tried when she showed the first signs of infection; her cough became a mix of phlegm and blood"
---
Booping my snoot as pig is the quickest way to die
---
I don’t think so. It sure does more. There isn’t much really besides escaping hook and chests that come to mind. I would guess it does both.
---
Compared to the bully shit survivors can pull, there is very little a killer can do to be equally toxic.  "Just using existing game mechanics" is the official defense I believe.
---
Imagine complaining about “teasing” when you openly admit to camping basement lmao
---
Wasn’t ignoring, purposefully dismissing because it wasn’t relevant to the main discussion, that is all.
---
It's a fucking red add-on, it's supposed to be broken. I ain't spending 7k BP on some weak shit.
---
Time to pop those weasels.
---
*cries into unblinkable tiles*
---
This is absolutely ridiculous I mean for one especially on xbox the que time is super long and most of the time your playing against swf which to say the least is almost always toxic to play against most the time you are gen rushed,flash light stunned and teabagged constantly.
---
 And to top it off you think that just because you're the last one alive you should just be giving you your escape why i mean even if I've only killed 1 survivor I'm not considering that a loss its to me a win if I'm playing against a group in party chat. You have 4 people all communicating and gen rushing,teabagging etc to get one kill against that is a win. 
---
Next time you think you should just be givin your exit consider how you played did you bully the killer by gen rushing,teabagging,flash light stunning continuously like an ahole? Maybe think about being the killer who's sat for 15mins to get a match to have to face that and then say I should just be giving you the hatch or door. 
---
Stop being entitled and believing you should just be handed everything if you play the match straight up without being an ahole and the killer respects your gameplay and decides to let you leave then hell yea.
---
But if you play like a scumbag especially in a group and your all playing like scumbags then you deserve what you get. Same goes for killers who tunnel and face camp and use basement with insidious and say "oh I'm farming bloodpoints it's a viable strategy lol". In that case f**k that guy lol.
---
i had one Nurse walking after me during one whole game 'cause she couldn't manage to do one good blink at the start. 
---
That was painful to watch
---
Or they hear that this game is cool, try to play, and realize they are completely barred from content just because they are new to the game and can't possibly grind out enough hours in time to earn the appropriate killer, forcing them to either buy, ignore the challenges, or stop playing out of frustration.
---
Not everyone started this game years ago.  Sure I have everything (minus Stranger Things because I refuse to buy that full price) and enough shards to get me the next survivor and killer too, but that's not the same for everyone.
---
That’s freaking awesome
---
Honestly. I'd rather you kill me then spend 2 minutes searching for the hatch.
---
True, this guy was 100% in character.
---
I can also imagine Ghostface mocking you because he "offended you".
---
On console so ymmv, but I’ve found a lot of success turning at the last second and running right at them and past them.
---
I think everyone knows that feeling. Survivors and Killers alike
---
According to the wiki it says that luck effects the chance of getting out of beartraps and  jumping off the hook. 
---
They need to rework luck
---
But then wouldn’t you be vomiting up blood compared to just bleeding out of your butt hole
---
I do this quite often for the last survivor, not because they deserve it or I feel obligated, but it's just fun for me and I like us both leaving with a positive experience :)
---
But other times I'll Mori all four of them...
---
LAMP
---
Maybe take a sarcasm class before you write a novel on how wrong I am
---
Honestly staying far apart from others really hinders his snowball potential because when I bonk someone's skull in I expect to hear a scream from infectious fright  and if I don't i either have to run around searching for someone to bonk or just hook them and waste my Blood fury, also if you're injured make your blood orb trail confusing or just ya know blood loss like crouching I believe only drops 1 blood orb.
---
I got Nancy, Ash, Jane and Yui. Now I'm just collecting shards for Julie
---
It also has a big bottom piece that has the tallies in wood etch. But I couldn’t post 2 pics unfortunately.
---
*I throw trash all over the ring and I wat the garbage*
---
Generally I’ll let the last one go, especially if I feel like I would’ve won. Also letting someone get the hatch is the easiest way to have someone on your side in end game chat. Really cuts down on toxicity if someone thinks you’re a nice person.
---
I don't actually understand why people hate face camping so much. Sure it's unfun, but if your team is at least decent, then the killer is literally throwing the game just to make sure one person dies.
---
I don’t see why not I mean they’ll be a massive kick off if they was to cap the PC’s game sensitivity so why not make their game equal
---
What kind of sharp adjustments are you talking about? Billys chainsaw works different than normal movement. There is a maximum left and right turnrate (which is very high at the begiining and quickly goes down). A joysticks only disadvantage is that maybe it takes a tiny bit longer to go from full right to full left but that time is miniscue.
---
With your rewording I will definitely agree with Huntress more but the big problem for joysticks when it comes to aiming is the range from tiny adjustments to big adjustments needed. A joystick sensitivity can only really be set for one. So even a high sensitivity for Huntress wont really help that much unless people buy modifications for controller. Dont get me wrong Huntress players will benefit from being able to customize sensitivity more, but Huntress will always be worse with a joystick.
---
Dont think I am a M&amp;K master race guy. Joysticks are better for other things. In Rocket League you "need" a controller for example.
---
"If you're that paranoid about noed run the perk or perks to counter it or memorize spawn spots"......
---
This is you disregarding everything I've said to you about the fact that I already do this and don't need you to tell me to do what I'm already doing.  And I didn't realize that you were the same guy from the other thread on here responding to me so I've already told you I run Small Game about 5 times now.......so yes you're ignoring what I've told you repeatedly and are telling me to do what I'm already doing lol.  Please don't make it a 6th time.
---
Well I’m not really dealing with luck, I’m having perks not show up when they should be but I got the problem solved
---
They made him turn better on console so this won't exactly work as good as it did
---
You think the devs would add a new injury animation specific for one character. They don't have the resources for that shit
---
farming is cancer
---
OH! That finally makes sense why I see new killers do that!
---
What happens if you don't complete a tome before it expires, by the way? Not really all that far along with the current one yet and probably won't manage it.
---
Don't play immersed then, just don't get hooked.
---
If you want to guarentee that you'll get the challenge, play blendette, run Spine Chill and Left Behind and bring a key. Then all you need to do is hide behind a tree the entire game and wait for all your teammates to die.
---
They actually tells you how she acquired her power in Happy Death Day 2!
---
Fixed an issue that made oni playable
---
Oh yeah babyyyyyyyy been a tapp player through it all
---
Could be too many players are picking killer as Freddy and Oni did get tweaks so it natural for people to test them out.
---
Another option would be make the sabo permanent but each survivor can only sabotage a certain amount of hooks and have a total hook sabotage limit. 
---
So let’s say every survivor can sabo three hooks but a total of only 6 hooks can be sabotaged.
---
This way if the survivors are smart they can make a safe area to run to before they’re downed where it’ll be hard for the killer to get to a hook but it stops too many being done that the killer has no options.
---
Seeing the killer wanted to go to Lery's, he got completely the opposite of what he wanted haha
---
1. Your overwatch comparison is different. That’s a team game and is blatantly easier to balance than DBD. You gotta remember survivors are also people who play the game and want to have fun. If they keep getting punished bc of their teammates mistakes, they’re gonna acquire learned helplessness and they’re gonna stop having fun. When people aren’t having fun with a video game, they stop playing it. I agree a lot of stuff should be “win as team lose as team” like 3 gen situations. 
---
2. Again. The point of being punished for mistakes is to learn. If you aren’t being punished for your mistake, *you* aren’t gonna learn shit. If your teammate gets punished for your mistake **you** aren’t gonna Learn shit and are gonna get hyper defensive and make excuses when someone calls you out on it, which is gonna encourage you to continue making bad decisions which is gonna keep getting ur teammates punished for your mistakes and suddenly you’re ruining the fun for a bunch of people. By your logic, this is okay bc it’s a team game? Like dude I get it. 1 survivor should not be anywhere near strong enough to hold the killer all game unless that survivor is stupendously more skilled than the killer. But a survivor should at least have some agency. Being able to stop a killer from tunneling you via decisive strike is not at all anywhere near trying to 1v1 the killer. It’s your insurance policy if your teammate doesn’t have BT. And you shouldn’t have to rely on the whims of perk accessibility in random people to counter a killer who is playing like an asshole.
---
That is the ultimate betrayal
---
Awesome cosplay my dude, want to share this pizza with me?
---
[7 minutes of leatherface cosplay](https://youtu.be/Zk_hBLWCKoI)
---
Agreed she’s harder to learn on console but she’s still the best killer on console
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that could cause a desync and/or being unable to move as the Killer after damaging a generator.
---
Thank you. It was so annoying when it happened
---
Aaaa ok, makes sense.
---
Then don’t create a lobby in the first place if the real world needs your attention...
---
More or less depending on killer like bubba if you camp with bubba just like ew
---
He didn't break any rules, you are the one who is being a jerk by choosing to message him to ridicule him for how he played.
---
Tough to tell, but is that a yuengling?
---
Yeah, who doesn't go into a blind rage every now and then am I right?
---
*tome
---
Ahhh a man of taste. My favorite beer lol that’s a cool tankard bro
---
The thing about WGLF is that survivors by default get less bloodpoints than the killer, as bloodpoints are basically split 4 separate ways between all survivors. One could max out on Gens and another could max out on running the killer around. But they still get less points because they’re not doing other categories. People run WGLF to try a counter that. At least that’s what I do.
---
I had a friend who secretly took the killer to teammates to escape in addition to unhooking without borrowed time lol Eventually my brother pointed it out but I didn't really take it seriously as if that was always the plan but it definitely became apparent. After a long talk she started escaping on her own more or less while adapting to a more stealthy play style to avoid chases
---
Some of the last few trophies I grabbed in the game were the nurse’s (the others were reach prestige 3 and shock people as doc so pretty easy). Pretty sure the only way I could manage the gen grab was by not attacking all game until the survs stopped running because they knew I was harmless.
---
Wait what the fuck there isnt even a sensitivity option?
---
Can you confirm? I won’t be able to get on and check till 6pm
---
Survivors: we have an army.
---
Entity: we have a Oni
---
Billy looks like he's about to summon Arsene.
---
Actually i said the furthest generators meaning several but 3 is essentially what i was going for lol Nice call
---
I would definitely love to see more perk play, from both sides. You guys should try to think of some buffs for weaker perks, too! Maybe share them, that can have an effect sometimes. I know the buffs for Surveillance were definitely a community idea way before they actually happened, so who knows what could come from it?
---
Whenever it will be purchasable by shards i will grab it.
---
I fucking love that video.
---
That’s a human not nea
---
That could work. Increase the time to do gens which lowers the dependency of ruin for killers allowing them to run different perks and not turn the game for survivors into a map wide hunt for a single totem.
---
I used to be completely unaware of the fact that the generators were really tall and you could see them from a distance, so I would never look up and would just aimlessly look around until I found a generator around a corner (like looking for big totems or something.) Also, I didn’t realize completed gens lit up the area, so I would go and try and repair them anyway.
---
If by "so long" you mean a few months then yeah
---
Imagine any killer with 3x Devour Hope
---
Ahh. Didn’t see the plural. That’s my bad
---
Sloppy Me.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Survivor is bloody easy.
---
I am thou to art i
---
I did and i thought other dbd players might want to know if they are eligible or not. As a canadian this offer does not include us.
---
Arrest this man
---
a rework/buff would be the perfect present :D
---
I HAVE SEEN IT CHANGE, TOO. I JUST DON’T RESCUE THEM UNTIL THEY STOP MOVING THEIR ARMS!  IF THEY GET TO SECOND PHASE, THAT IS ON THEM!
---
It doesnt take more time. You just need ti reverse the position of your thumbsgicks to make then opposite eachother
---
i got a 4k like this with Nurse trying to do the Kill Obsession 4 Times Challenge, i got my kill, the door was open, but they wanted to be assholes and it cost them

Need more info.

Hex: The Thicc Appeal
---
Look, as hard as it may be to understand, it’s not that simple. Here is the hard truth people struggle to understand: ruin isn’t broken or in need of nerfs. Wow, who would have guessed. Ruin is a hex perk, it is a perk that can become nothing. Many survivors run small game to beat ruin faster and with the buff to detectives hunch it is even easier. BBQ is in an even better place than it’s ever been. You could always have used barbecue to trick the killer by changing your position when BBQ finishes, and now lockers hide your aura so the killer has to wonder where you are entirely. If you think they nerfed Balanced Landing because it was strong, you know nothing of how unfair Balanced Landing was when players who knew how to abuse it. We need more good perks because the best perks we have are needed to beat growing issues. You want them to just increase the time it takes to complete a gen? Holy fuck, now pop goes the weasel gets a HUGE buff because of how it affects that. Nerf pop? How about overcharge? How much longer would we need for gens to get done? Make it too long and the 3 gen strat becomes the meta. Too little and your argument becomes invalid. You are thinking in a reactionary way when that level of thinking causes it to spiral so hard because with every “fix” you make, a new problem arises and either the survivors or the killers complain while the other says it’s not a problem. “Nerf good perks and buff the bad perks” come on, are we talking numbers alone because that is a lot of numbers that will change nothing, you want perks to be completely reworked? That is a lot of stuff that will need to be scrapped to make every perk something incredibly impactful to the game. Killer perks need to be better than survivor perks because the game alone allows survivors to bully killers, especially without ruin. We need variety? Maybe, but right now there are bigger issues than “ruin and BBQ are too strong”
---
That’s actually a really fun idea. My friends and I like thinking of different ways the game could change. And I’m in the same boat I would love to see more diversity in perk builds for both sides.
---
That's the good stuff. I live right down the road from where they brew it. Awesome beer with an awesome tankard!
---
Sameeeee
---
The spiderman edits are incredible. This is perfection.
---
The claud likely didn't realize you were there, heaven help me how many times I've accidentally led the killer to another survivor. Lol
---
One of the reasons I run Bond now.
---
You're smart
---
holy shit... it's been already a year?!
---
If the devs weren't promising frequent updates, Legion's release could've killed the game
---
I wonder if we will actually get a tome for every character. Not every DbD original character is free, so that puts a paywall on who can complete it. Because of that, it's likely that either there won't be any challenges specific to their character, only their perks, or they won't have tomes for them at all
---
She clearly just went into the Upside Down.

WHY DO YOU INVITE ME TO A PARTY JUST TO TRASH TALK ME AFTER I SAID GG???  I ALREADY SAID YOU WON THE GAME! ALSO, I WASN’T THAT BAD - I KILLED ONE OF YOU AND THE REST WERE ON DEATH HOOK!!! I STILL GOT MORE BP THAN ANYONE ON YOUR SWF TEAM!!!!
---
Correction, they are doing nothing while self-care users are spending their time doing nothing.
---
They worked for me just now. Had an medkit with 16 charges and gel dressings which also gave me charges. Before the hotfix the medkit would be depleted after 1 heal but now the charge addons seem to be working properly because i had some % left on my medkit.
---
I mean, I break totems as I go.
---
I'd say he's relatively balanced but we'll have to see if the addon changes have made a difference
---
Ghostface is and it isn't close.  Ghostface is legit pretty awesome and viable throughout the ranks.
---
Why did they word it like they actually fixed a problem for once? If they wanna put a band aid on everything at least don't lie about it. Yikes.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Be gone, thot.
---
I remember WGLF being bugged a while ago, after it got nerfed. Took a bit of a break, is that still the case? (somewhat old thread, but it doesn't feel worth opening a new one for...)
---
No urban is definitely better than lightweight because it allows you to do a lot more against sentient killers.
---
I don't play immersed, and I was able to complete this solo. The most important things here are good visibility in to what everyone else is doing, and ability to escape chase.
---
I run Spine Chill as part of my regular build, and unless I'm facing a stealth killer or a Spirit, I don't use it for sneaking away. I use it to get a head start in chases, or just to give myself a heads up that I should be looking around for a way out.
---
If you're not super comfortable with looping the killer, then I would try to do your best to work on gens not near the killer. Work on gens with good line of sight, and try not to work on anything with another survivor. If you're alone, the killer is less likely to focus their attention on you, as they want to pressure as many people as possible.
---
Run something like Bond or Empathy so you can see other auras. It'll give you a better idea of what's going on in other parts of the map. If the action is coming to you, then move. If you don't see anyone in your immediate area and your Spine Chill isn't lighting up, then you're probably good to stay where you are.
---
If you find yourself in a chase run to a section of the map where the gens have all been completed. The killer is less likely to want to waste time over there. Consider running Lithe to give you a speed boost after a vault, or Sprint Burst if you think you can lose the chase right away. Both perks can pair well with Quick and Quiet or Dance With Me, and are good for losing the killer.
---
If you're not running an aura reading perk, carry a medkit so you can heal yourself when necessary. You want to be able to take an extra hit ASAP, so a medkit can be important if you can't find someone fast.
---
Hide from BBQ. This is super important, so don't just think it'll be okay one time and stay out in the open. Either get in a locker or get behind an uncompleted gen, and count to 5. I wouldn't try to be close enough to the killer unless you have no other option or are certain he can't see or hear you.
---
I disagree, Freddy is definitely up there but I'd say that Billy is a little bit higher than him
---
waiting inside the exit gates should play that slow rising sound when you're revealing Ghostface and kill you when it finishes
---
Dat shit op
---
Probably bc I used a harley quinn pose as the reference!
---
NO period do not bring fnaf franchise into dbd PLEASE thank you
---
Not when you're without other people in a party. It isn't mechanically hard, it's hard in succeeding alone.
---
It is similar, I'd say Cabin in the Woods also has a video game kinda feel to it
---
What's wrong with saying GG Everyone :D
---
You do gens or you run away from the killer, both are pretty basic.
---
Not that I can remember, and I remember looking forever for some option to increase the sensitivity and it was not there.
---
She was the one who unhooked me. Then I ran right and she went left, then next thing I know she returns with the killer on her tail
---
no one has fun playing against a spirit. And how is doctor boring or easy to beat? you haven't seen many doctors.
---
People, for the love of god, do NOT dc if you get stuck on a gen! There's always a survivor that sees that something isn't right and somehow help you, like tapping the gen again so you can kick it and get unstuck.
---
YES! Thanks for this! I have the DDLM cosmetic, and fucking hate that white shirt! WoOoooooOoooooooooOOoOOooOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
What did he say? I don't have sound
---
The gameplay is basic. Easier said
---
Believe me I play on Console it is still a uphill battle against good survivors at high rank.
---
Or you can use his sprint to move through the map and his lunge to one hit survivors, how it was meant to be (I think that's the bhvr's ideal, because there's no reason to nerf his flick)
---
Urban &gt; Self Care
---
There I said it
---
I never DC, but it’s still frustrating since it happen sometimes as often as twice a game.
---
Don't play it then
---
not even a little bit...
---
For the increased recovery speed
---
&gt; Resourceful: You find scraps to fix up your items. While not using your item, Resourceful will start to refill charges at a rate of 5% charge per second. This perk can refill 50%/75%/100% charges.
---
Holy shit. A new medkit or toolbox every 20 seconds, complete with whatever addons you brought.
---
"killjoy'
---
No pun intended there right?  lol
---
This is my meme. Uploaded on Instagram @sp00kyjeff and Reddit. You won't find anyone who posted it before me.
---
Does he have my pizza? Cause I’ll take it and wish him a good day
---
Aight but I’m still gonna play it
---
Honestly, what's the point of these cosmetics if they're gonna put them in the store anyways?
---
Like, I get with the rift you probably get more then if you would pay for them. But then again, I can't beliebe anyone her likes/uses 50+% of the cosmetics earned from the rift
---
BTW it even says Sp00kyjeff in the corner
---
No, not so much atleast, It happens maybe once, but then the situation gets milked to death
---
It's amazing how many people don't know what it takes to play killer in red ranks, it's no wonder no one likes playing killer in red ranks.
---
Don’t bring a brand new part tho. Use a socket swivel and instructions.
---
Freddy is the most op killer, highest kill rate
---
Ey sane here amigo I love him but the pain you feel is so bad
---
Then clearly it's not actually that big of a deal.
---
OHHHHHHH
---
If I were to do anybody else itd probably be Myers or Spirit.(:
---
She was probably forced that direction and assumed you weren't dumb enough to stay in an unsafe area.
---
He upsetti spaghetti (nice work btw)
---
Somebody already posted something like this ffs
---
I am a fan of music, but i never heard post malone.  I think his music is garbage.  
---
see... that makes no sense
---
Jungle gyms destroy him. If you have your power and a survivor is running to one, let him go
---
Sounds like a you problem, never had this happen nor heard anyone complain about it.
---
Definitely balanced the other perks are ez flashlight farming and invincible pallets too
---
&gt; You can do well with any killer at any rank with enough practice
---
Cough cough...*glances at flair*
---
I actually just queud up with a Jane with those cosmetics
---
Wow, my guess is you’re a killer main
---
Buffing some of the less worthwhile killers perks is a good idea as long as it would lower a killers dependency on these perks
---
Ruin isn’t that strong that’s true. It could be destroyed with the first minute of a game due to bad placement or it could last the entire game because it’s in a dark corner of the map that you can barely see making 4K at 5 gens more common than it needs to be. Making ruin last on a time limit would make it so it allows the killer get a rolling start on survivors but also doesn’t turn the game into an un-winnable situation because survivors can’t get gens done. Making the game a 10 min slaughter. Increasing the time to do gens would make it so even if ruin runs out the killer still has a chance without getting gen rushed.
---
^
---
I am so proud of this community.
---
Yep, it's a very rare line that can play after waiting long enough in the menu or lobby.
---
There's a few other ones, I can't remember them all off the top of my head but from what I can remember...
---
* "Come on kid, push the button."
---
* "Are we gonna be here all day?"
---
* "Can we do something here?"
---
I fucking hate freddy's IMO whenever I get in chases with him they're no fun with his stupid fucking snares which essentially force u to either throw down the pallet or take a hit
---
You can
---
you can
---
Was there more than one locker in the area?
---
Yes, you can still do your challenges afterwards.
---
You indeed can go back and do the old challenges after you progress through that tome
---
"What is this, a staring contest? Come on, let's go!"
---
goofy level?
---
&gt;They did a pretty good job in balance this year
---
I disagree. Especially since the Stranger Things chapter, I think they’ve been messing up quite a bit. Nurse and Spirit were stronger than other killers and as a result were picked more at high ranks. Instead of buffing other killers to be viable at high ranks as well, BHVR decided to nerf Nurse and Spirit. That was a huge mistake in my opinion and the devs having that kind of mentality when it comes to high rank balance makes me worried for the future of the game.
---
They also have this annoying habit of nerfing killers too soon after their release. It’s barely been a week since Oni came out and they’re already making significant changes to his power. They need to allow time for players to flesh out the killer and find counters, these knee-jerk reaction nerfs are dangerous.
---
And rather than address concerns with the speed of gens and the game overall so stuff like [this](https://youtu.be/rJqFxk8U0OY) doesn’t happen, they buffed medkits and made survivor actions even faster.
---
And to top it off, their map design is also suffering. Personally, I think Hawkins lab is a terribly designed map. They’ve also been ignoring the fact that on certain maps “god loops” can spawn and the killer can lose because of map rng.
---
All of this happening in a relatively short time span concerns me. I want to enjoy the game and I want it to have a healthy player base, and I feel like they are pushing people away with their balance and design choices.
---
so incredibly true
---
I thought they fixed that shit.
---
I know what both sides are like at red ranks
---
He said balanced, he didn't say Freddy was the best.
---
lol, thank you
---
Then Claud didn't know you were there.
---
Also, it was still kind of your fault for healing in a very unsafe location.
---
Still not enough time tbh. Make it like 120.
---
“wOw my guess is you’re a killer main hehe”
---
buffing bad killer perks is a good idea obviously. but why nerf the strong ones..? at this point killers need strong perks. every single good killer perk out there is easily countered by survivors if they have 2 brain cells to rub together. just leave them how they are.
---
bhvr can buff the weak perks all they want but it’s not going to stop the fact that 4 gens can get done in 80 seconds. and that’s without toolboxes.
---
I didn't say Freddy was the best. I was saying billy is balanced
---
Agree. Doesn’t sound like much. Hey I will guess also Pig Traps ? But still, making the whole “luck” thing and it only does three things? Not iconic enough.
---
Nice radicals you got there buddy
---
I think that they meant their flare, not yours.
---
Clearly not with a comment you made. Lol
---
Which makes sense
---
I run BBQ on all my killers just like how I run WGLF on survivors.  Half the time I forget I'm running it, especially when after hooking you go to lay traps or are looking for hatchets.  I wish I didn't have to use BBQ and could use more fun perks but I need the sweet, sweet Blood Points.
---
Sick! I am just about to reach devotion 1, probably this week and I am excited. Congrats!
---
Your meme is good and you should feel good!
---
I grabbed Steve, Nancy, Ash, Tapp, Jane and both Legions. Basically all the new ones except Yui
---
Each to their own I guess.  No point in arguing to a closed minded person
---
If it only plays after waiting in the lobby for a long time then it shouldn't be so rare in dbd :p.
---
But that's pretty cool, never knew that!
---
Yeah, no dude. Just no. It’s “scary” to a child but anyone grown up realizes how stupid the FNaF story is. I followed the game since it was just an obscure indie game you could download, and Scott has literally just been piecing the story as he goes. It’s a mess of Loop holes/missing plot.
---
Fnaf is Tumblr-quality horror, like Jeff The Killer or Slenderman. It’s “scary” when you’re young, but that’s it.
---
daring today, aren't we
---
Bill's hands in relation to his arms don't really make sense...
---
You think so?  A mobility ability (lol) that's also an instadown that's accessable for the entire match with no downsides?  Is it balanced that a green and yellow add on combination is his best kit?  
---
Ever noticed they haven't made a killer anywhere near as powerful (after nurse, arguably spirit).
---
I mean for console players it's an absolute win as Oni gets a nice buff and forever Freddy is less of pain in the ass
---
People who play in a way that’s fun for the person playing but not fun for the other players in the game are way this community is so hostile towards each other
---
Oni nerfs (why the fuck) when they STILL aren't doing anything to Legion on the same patch as they get new cosmetics...for fuck sake BHVR.
---
Downvoted....     if any new players are reading this. Please dont take this person seriously...
---
they should bring back old freddy in one way or another while keeping the new one, so the noobs that weren’t able to play him before can now and the old freddy mains can keep playing him without feeling sorrow from their lost friend.
---
Yeah but that’s scummy and holding the game hostage
---
I wonder what he said after seeing that perk.
---
This is real. I haven't played in weeks because I just can't stand the wait times. I don't want to wait longer than I actually get to play.
---
“A bookmark in horror games”
---
Because no game in the history of ever has relied on loud jump scares and little kid voices. 
---
FNaF isn’t this masterpiece of a game like you’re imagining it dude. And it doesn’t belong in Dead By Daylight.
---
well thats like the Definition of meta
---
yeah, but most come at a cost, off the top of my head Judith's tombstone slows you down in tier 3 which makes catching a survivor really difficult and fragrant tuft increases the stalking needed to reach tier 3, nurse's adds a blink but takes away her ability to go through walls, billy flying through pallets at mach 10 with no down side would be nuts.
---
Those wasn't even his best add-on. Lol
---
Damn. You are taking games way to serious. If my gf cuts herself while i'm loading in i will not leave her bleeding.
---
Only a Sith deals in absolutes...
---
Yeah, if I do accidentally down the freshly unhooked then I leave them to be healed.
---
Cool, now I can get Oni for those shards.
---
yeah, no freddy fuckbear for me. only real grown up killers like michael myers. im a big adult who doesn't get scared at horror movie. 'mature grown up' is my middle name.
---
and on top of that you can susualy just wait till last second to make a save before phase 2 and make his waste more time getting a down, probably with borrowed time, then maybe eating a decisive strike, and then have to wait all the way to the end of struggle phase where you should hopefully have the exits opened and can body block for them
---
"I quit the game because I can't understand why the devs push out balance changes"
---
Cool dude, I don't want to gear about it.
---
So no one is going to talk about why she is running so fast!?!
---
If you ever lose a killer then you can heal yourself multiple times easily. And it’s definitely better to run one because if your ever the last alive and are hurt you could easily die. I’ve saved people that were hooked while I was only person not hooked and was able to heal myself then go for a much safer save. For solo survivors it’s a great perk. I’m red rank btw
---
Holy shit is that a spirit's arm? 😥
---
Now he really is just a worse billy
---
didnt know it existed, but isnt that actually the survivor holding it hostage? they have to step in it while youre avoiding attacking them it sounds like...
---
If he says about tbag doesnt mean what our surv tbag. Its like going on other side of the map and still be called camper
---
I assume they paid their way thru it. It is a dollar per tier.
---
Thank fkin god they havent fixed rank update error still after 5months, i just love being on 15rank all the time and owning these newbs.
---
It’s the little things really
---
FNaF is LITERALLY marketed and sold in Schoolastic Book Fairs for toddlers and children. The Merch is everywhere in kids sections and toy stores. You can even find the books in the “Children’s Horror” section of the Library.
---
Adding a FNaF character into Dead By Daylight is like adding a character from Goosebumps into the game. What the fuck is the point?
---
May someone explain to me? Im not playing often but been playinf for 4 years, lol i still dont know jack shit about the game except playing trapper or casually shitting my pants as a survivor
---
It's not even balance changes, the devs nerf killers unreasonably all the time
---
Still stylish as fuck
---
The archives sis t the grindy part. The rift is. 
---
Archives get completed by just playing.
---
Not if they don’t know about the bug either. What I’m saying is if this happens and you just leave them there as opposed to you know killing them and hooking them it’s 100% holding the game hostage.

I’d love the updated stalking theme from 2018 Halloween I love the synths.
---
As long as you abide by the no-struggle rule!
---
And that's why that perk is great.
---
Still no cosmetics for Freddy or Quentin... sigh.
---
Nurse is my favorite killer :(
---
I play on console too, and it's not THAT bad.
---
Was it really that common? I played trapper a decent amount and I never get caught in the trap right after I set it, only walking into it later.
---
The best/worse thing about the patch (depending how you look at it) is that they nerfed Freddy's addons.
---
i love fnaf but i think it would not fit in. but thanks for sharing your idea :D
---
killer: plague, piggy, ghostface, huntress
---
surv: feng, claudette, adam, yui
---
sorry i can’t choose :(
---
That’s another point. Survivors have the flexibility to experiment. You want a chest build go for it, you want a healing build be my guest, you want a running the killer around build why not. 
---
The killers don’t have that. You don’t want to run ruin prepare to be gen rushed, you don’t run NOED good luck, you don’t want to run BBQ for whatever reason have fun get jack in blood points. 
---
There needs to be a rework on something.
---
Welcome to red ranks. Enjoy your stay!
---
Since you're rank 4, it queues at rank 4. Since high rank Survivor queues take forever it'll take forever
---
Wrong, the reason Survivor queue times are so long is because there aren't enough Killers to fill matches. On average over 80% of the player base is Survivor. So if more people played killer matches will fill up faster. More Killers means faster queue times for survivors. That's how it works.
---
 That explains the bad rep. Jesus that sounds like a headache. Thanks for taking the time to explain all of that!
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm always rank 17 and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ all 4 of them, i just hunt and hit them only if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i often repeat to myself, for example, "just do 1 and 3" (referring to whichever survivor from 1-4 at the bottom left). i'd never play any other way.
---
I think he needed tweaked on PC as well so it might be fine.
---
Dying light works to slow the game down even further beyond. Blood echo is good to.
---
my flair is perfect
---
I gave someone hatch yesterday because I was feeling merciful and sniped them with a chainsaw across the map *twice*. The second time they just saw me coming, stopped running, and shined a flashlight at me which was funny enough to make me merciful. It happens, just gotta catch people in the right mood
---
Eh, balanced landing has the additional benefit of reducing stun time from falling
---
S A L T, brother. There's an abundance in this game. Just keep doing your thing! If they didn't want you to hook and guard survivors they would have added some way to block you away from the hooked survivor. It's a viable mechanic. Us survivor mains are just a salty bunch.
---
That’s a Yuinger boi.
---
Can you drop the link you got that from?
---
“Experimentation” as in everybody just swapped to dead hard
---
When everyone is tired of being sent to the swamp 12 times in a row because the game had no idea what map rotation is.
---
Nice job looping, at least.

* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
Yes remind us of how Mt. Ormond was crashing everyone’s platforms, forcing a hard reboot. 
---
I’ve never liked the legion since he came out because all the killers on PS4 literally camped from launch day with them.
---
That I can completely agree on. Gens get done way too fast. Making perks like Ruin a necessity than a nicety. This prevents killers from experimenting with different perks without getting annihilated.
---
stop caring about messages from salty survivors? you play to win not to give them a good time and this is coming from a survivor main. If you have fun keep doing what you do.
---
It was deleted since I forgot to add a flair.
---
how do u not have premium? one $10 payment gets u premium for life because u just keep recycling 1000 ACs from the rift
---
The other one was deleted for no flair.
---
If you look at Forever Freddy, increasing gen time is NOT a good idea. It would be better to add a side objective because then the game wouldn't be boring on the survivor side and the game wouldn't be over so fast if a killer doesn't run Ruin.
---
Happened daily for me. 50 percent of the time while walking forward normally after setting a trap.
---
So the Pig getting nerfed to prevent obvious problems with interactions with traps with an endgame timer is unneeded? The Legion nerf to balance out his buff (which actually does make him better believe it or not) is unneeded? Nurse, the most op killer in the game, was her nerfs unneeded as well?
---
Im talking more about the "The Joy of Creation" spinoff game than the actual games.
---
Well for the basement it's actually not a bad move if they're quick enough and good enough. Keeps you from being able to set up the basement as Trapper can snowball from that like no other.
---
Running at 100% for ten seconds is just running for 10 seconds. I think the chain saw add-ons should greatly increase the chainsaw cool down or the tantrum length when hitting an object. On Billy’s case it should either increase charge time or decrease cool down
---
Sorry about that :0.

---
Damn. I thought cos he invited me it’d be a lower rank lobby. Doesn’t matter tho, we are doing badly so I’m depipping quick
---
I thought about it but didn’t want to do it because I like talking to the survivors with great tech after a fun and intense game. Guessing it’s a commonplace thing based off of your response tho I’ll just have to ignore the toxic stuff
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
i think the best thing bhvr could do is add a secondary objective for survivors. make the game last longer to accommodate for the fast generator speeds.
---
of course, with the increased trial time, you won’t want it to feel like a waste. definitely would have to add a bloodpoint bonus for doing the secondary objective. more chases would be happening as well. just something the community has been talking about lately.
---
Wait till you hit the red ranks...
---
But yeah the previous statement about setting your messages to friends only is a great suggestion. I'm on Xbox and just days after starting this game I ended up doing that and 2+ years later it was the best thing I could have done.
---
Why would you add another effect to Haunted Grounds when it's a perk literally designed with the intent of someone breaking it? Lol
---
You underestimate my brokeness, I can barely scrounge up the money for dlcs when they come out lol.
---
You could have realistically made that bp in a few days if you spam killer games with bbq and let games drag out a bit if youre doing well, as well as the archives and daily rituals.
---
What.  Scared?
---
I wouldn't call it exploiting when it's how they released the killer.  Most people would probably assume that that's how the killer was supposed to be, unless they heard otherwise.
---
stereotypes
---
Happy birthday best killer!
---
\*wait BHVR where are you going with the nerf hammer again\*
---
Yeah idk about that one chief
---
I believe you but I haven’t personally seen it. Sounds par for BHVR’s course.
---
The sensible thing to do is just wait til the end and see how far you got. If you only end up getting to tier 10 it's probably not worth it.
---
It’s not about not caring. You literally have to turn off messaging to play this game. Salty fucks will spam you and make the game unplayable. The update sound is far louder than the game, makes a huge box that obscures vision and you get updated every 3 seconds. 
---
They can send 50 messages in about 2 min. You keep getting the updates after you block them.
---
FINALLY!  A COMMENT NOT GEARED TOWARD RIPPING MY IDEA UP.  Thanks for the kindness my dude.
---
Just most of the player bases opinion about the Legion unless your on Xbox where that’s their main killer lol!
---
I agree. But I guess it's a trade off when survivors only got a Halloween outfit for Jake this year.
---
I’ve run into a few Freddys, it’s hell. A secondary objective would be fun. But the reward would need to be worth it.
---
Yeah when you get unhooked, you are stuck in place for a second and I try my hardest to take the hit but it just wont let me move. Feels worse man.
---
I do rituals and archive and even spent some of my pool on an already owned perk in the shrine. I just only get maybe 2 hrs tops a day to play. But overall probably, 20-30 hrs for something I could have just bought. Also wasted real life money on the clown who I don’t intend to ever play.
---
Finally they nerfed freddy's broken add-ons.
---
If you did 4 gens and looped the killer, you should've had at least 11k bloodpoints. Because you'd have max objective. And I'd imagine you'd get at least 3k points in chase. It does suck that our only option to get more bloodpoints is to run We're Gonna Live Forever.. I wish they'd make it do something else other than just giving you bloodpoints. BBQ and Chili has that.
---
I think you still should, you can message people still, they just cant message you first.
---
Imagine thinking ruin is strong. Lmao
---
It's very brave to have an opinion on this subreddit about NOED, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Ruin, BBQ and Chili, etc.  
---
Like yesterday I got -5 karma for saying that survivor games are generally easier to play than a game of killer when someone asked why survivors get less BP than killers.
---
I play both sides of the game fairly evenly and I'm generally at red or high purple before every rank reset on killer and survivor, so I don't really have a bias.
---
I actually love that the Legion sweaters explain some backstory on Susie and Joe, something they lack since most of Legions bio revolves around Frank.
---
*cries in Quentin*
---
Why does it matter its sooner than June?
---
I personally find it fucking awesome that Steve from Stranger Things, Bill from Left 4 Dead and Detective Tapp from Saw can share a promotional image like this together
---
Ah ok cool that works then. I was just concerned about losing the community aspect of a fun, competitive game such as this. Thank You!

"*Did your husband give it to you?*"
---
The vast majority of solo survivor gate openings happen when they camp a gate waiting for the killer to close the hatch, it wont change much for them, and fuck if it's that big a deal just disable regression when one survivors left, it's a video game people! We  can put in specific conditions for things to work, (also the same exact reason why the devs had no excuse to nerf remember me into the ground)
---
OP defaces bathroom wall and claims it was someone else all for that stabby karma
---
Doctor's punishment mode is getting removed.
---
Thank the entity.
---
How many unhooks, heals did you do? Being altruistic does help.
---
Also did you do totems?
---
Ok otz fanboy. Lol
---
I can win most red ranks games with the better killers, but I still run ruin when I play Clown or other bad killers.
---
Cause 4k's are easy, most people play for chases both as survivor and killer
---
Upvoted for Spider-man meme
---
Thanks! I never hook and guard tho I always hook and look for the next survivor or gen. It kills me when I hook someone, walk away and the survivor who thinks I haven’t noticed them following me all game believes they should be able to unhook within my terror radius then call me a tunneler or camper when I down them. Strange world lol
---
Idunno, Pig's lookin' pretty nerfable.
---
Nobody got hooked until the end of the game and the totems were taken out by people who had inner strength
---
How about Nemesis and Play With Your Food? Legion is pretty much guaranteed to get a first hit wound with Frenzy. Eat the pallet stun, target becomes your Obsession and gains Oblivious, instant  PWYF stack to finish the chase.
---
The meme actually made it so hard to play the Pig now lol. I just wanna play a normal game, but survivors will throw themselves at me to boop, and now if I kill them they get all pissy. Like it’s funny once in a while but jeez.
---
Oni, Spirit, reworked Freddy, Demo
---
Survivor using Game offering what's wrong with you?
---
4k doesn't mean shit if you dont pip. Just sayin'.
---
Nerfing the bloody glove makes Oni weaker on console. And Freddy wasnt overpowered.
---
I’m definitely turning those messages off before red ranks lol I can only imagine what’s it’s like
---
Chase more I guess?
---
How does that make me an otz fanboy?
---
Well, At least David got his achievement.
---
1: I know that even a weaker version of Hex: Ruin is strong as that one survivor will take my longer to do a generator, but I also said that every second skill check is the ruin kind
---
2: The reason I put it as being unable to cleans any dull or hex totems is because of how some perks work. For example, a survivor brings in Inner Strength and break the totem, suddenly they can't break any more totems to fuel Inner Strength, essentially making them run 3 perks now. You could have Hex: No One Escapes Death to keep that one person from potentially breaking the last dull totem or even keep them alive long enough for them to realize what you did, make them unable to get rid of your Hex: No One Escapes Death while you practically ignored them during the match so it would be close to impossible to escape.
---
He's literally the only person I know that uses that excuse for why he doesn't run ruin.
---
Saying gg I’d they play well? So ridiculous my guy /s you’re missing the point clearly. You can leave now
---
Das ist Keydette. No IW required.
---
Pips are meaningless.
---
Lmao it was fun in the beginning but got tiresome very quickly given the quantity of messages. Got the point I was constantly responding to crappy accusations instead of enjoying the game
---
I'm gonna get fucked by a pizza boy, whether its Dwight topping me or Oni, I'm happy either way.
---
Its that and the framerate drops, at least for me. I'm not sure if ps4 Pro does better, but my ps4 certainly does not do well with that.
---
So is going for a 4k with no points.
---
I'm just loading up on match box thingies for this time when it comes
---
If you just follow the killer and blind them while they're in the hooking animation, it will also count. (That way you don't have to actually flashlight save, since that can be pretty difficult without practice.)
---
I know I never hod my name but oh well guess I'm bad at life.
---
That is why you don't run sabo builds without No Mither.
---
Ok, so now Freddy's slowdown add-ons are just garbage.
---
So... this leaves him with only one add-on line that has a desirable effect and then four decent one offs in his upper tiers.
---
...I get that Forever Freddy was annoying, but this is pathetic.
---
They need to fix his god awful lunge animations.  Every time I get hit by him I feel cheated
---
Him and a try hard Claudette but the other two (Nea's)  got the gate. I hated that I had to tunnel and camp but those were extreme circumstances.
---
Mfw premium doesn’t actually help with the god awful grind.
---
Well you're on Ps4 so that makes sense. Guess you should of gotten an Xbox then you wouldn't have that issue.
---
I'll still walk into it anyways
---
She always looks that way to the devs
---
Not arguing, just haven't seen any of these posts enough to be worthy of being called common. Carry on.
---
Maybe with the new elm street movie that they’re looking for scripts on they’ll start releasing Freddy/Quentin stuff

even if you do you still wont even get close to what the killer gets

I love this idea - basement trapper would become so much more funny.  For Killer. Not the survivors.
---
Bold of you to assume everyone can play enough to get the full 1000 AC refund
---
When I first started, I chose Kate. When hooked I always tried to unhook myself first, I didn‘t realize there was a penalty to that. So I often was the first one to die. 
---
Then I switched to Dwight because I thought Kate hat a weak defense stat or something.
---
Seriously though, it's 4 vs 1.

Imagine legion vs David, Bill, Yui, and Jeff armed with hatchets.

I've got high school finals coming up.  TBH i got no time to argue with you.

Yeah I'm not 100% sure why it wasn't showing. It should've said "Legion Portrait," I'm on PC now and I can see that. Weird. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

This is fucking awesome, such a cool style.
---
Mix in sprint burst for a very confused killer. (head-on and sprint burst can activate simultaneously)
---
I use the lettuce head with it , looks p nice
---
For me, that's where the fun is... not farming for points or rank.
---
I’d love to see all of that, you’ve got talent
---
What? BT and DS are the only meta perks, and she’s not even dressed in Blendette clothes. Not very meta tbh.
---
Food
---
And that is the result of French internet, woo!
---
(I'm friends with the Killer, it's all chill)
---
The end result was basically just pc oni getting a flick nerf
---
Just up your sensitivity to adderall overdose.
---
o shit
---
rip.. I read the "adjusted controller flick" and i was so excited to play him just to find out its still bad.  Not to mention auto aim cucking me of dozens of hits
---
As a killer main I feel you. Majority of the player base are all survivors tho so it’s naturally they’d rather appeal to them. There’s def some survivor nerfs that are absolutely needed but that will never happen.
---
I removed the knife &amp; generator aura in the updated link
---
Noed and adrenaline are equal opposites.
---
I main Freddy but don’t use Forever Freddy. Personally, I think they just need to make it so the addons don’t stack. Don’t change the values. The addons are useless now for people who didn’t stack that shit
---
Probably not, true, then again I did get DbD free so I'll take it.
---
They are one of the two windows store users
---
And this is more of what I'm talking about. Salty as fuck because the killer doesn't play by your stupid honor code. I even said I only camp when they're not popping gens or when they wanna play toxic. It's not my job to "give you a chance" that's the most pathetic shit I've heard on this forum.
---
Every time I pop this I get that evil grin. 
---
*”Oh you want to leave this poor chump for me? Let’s play a game”*
---
My hope is that they are bringing down all the top killers so they can finally balance SWF.
---
Because let’s be real, as a solo survivor any good killer will more than likely wipe the floor with you and your team. So for solo survivors I feel these nerfs are fair and just.
---
However SWF is so strong that when you run into those groups and you get rekt’d and all gens pop within minutes then you have to wonder? “Why are survivors so strong”
---
Well truth is they are not, SWF is the thing that’s strong not survivors as a whole.
---
Imagine killing people to teach them the value of life
---
This post was made by stalky-boi gang
---
I likey
---
Honestly Demogorgon is in my opinion the scariest killer in the game. They are a giant 10ft machine of pure unbridled killing rage. All they care about is food and their ass is always hungry.
---
That sucks, because freddy is a really cool character
---
it makes sense, you are just looking on title from the side of the killer. if you look at it from survivor perspective its never too late to fuck up and give up a win when you play vs oni, even if you basically already won
---
It's shitty to win the game? Yeah you're salty lol
---
Definitely. Would allow more unique combos without having spend a bunch of money getting everything.
---
Not really. I dont let this game best me in the emotion department like so many do. I get tea bagged and it's all good. I'll spin in circles. You probably cry about not getting your "4k". I play both sides though bub.
---
And I wanted to add even more stuff
---
I’ve changed my survivor sensitivity on Xbox but haven’t looked to see if it’s there for the killers. Can’t imagine why it wouldn’t be.
---
Those people are even worse
---
Oh believe me I'm not going anywhere.  
---
I started playing some survivor finally.  
---
And I will say that so far, our of 10 or so survivor matches I only had 1 guy who played like this.  
---
Wraith. Hook. Cloak. Sit there.  Oh man what an amazing strategy!
---
Hopefully they nerf Pig and Legion next patch. They really need it
---
legion doctor plag
---
ok ty, and once hit the 15 lvl place pgtw.
---
What's winning? Getting a shitty 4k and no points? Okay guy.
---
Oooh, SB, Decisive, BT, and Prove Thyself. Never seen such a *daring* combo.
---
I've come to realize people are gonna get mad when they lose, no matter how I play anyway.
---
If you can hear the survivor struggling, or are standing somewhere with direct line of sight to see of they get unhooked, you're camping.
---
It's just not fun otherwise. The tactics, mindgaming, bloodlusting, ect, that's fun. Fun = Higher points, whether you want them or not. 
---
Honestly sounds like you're just aiming for a sense of pride in slamming a 4k asap. Can you not 4k if they get the gens done without noed?
---
What in the ever living fuck was balanced about making doing the objective impossibly long while the killer is free to fuck around for the first 10 minutes of a match and still guarantee a free win just for existing on the map. I've got to hear this one. 
---
Gonna take a guess and say that you thought moonwalking borrowed time and running double blade addons before the nerf and before it was a bannable offense before they patched it was "balanced" too right? It's literally an exploit in game design error.
---
I literally just made a post about this exact same thing. The higher rank the survivors are, the more pissed they get about losing. Nothing us killer mains can do besides keep killing. Very odd that some survivors believe killers should play at their pace.
---
Until yout totem is destroyed 20 seconds into the match, i hate hexes
---
If Pig was strong simply because she prevented you from leaving in end game then she was already shit.
---
I've definitely put my previous mains aside as they've fallen, sometimes repeatedly, under the hammer. If they for some reason Myers gets an unnecessary visit, I'd start considering my options.
---
I genuinely just don't get what they've done to Pig or where they're planning on taking her, for example. Her lore and addons and intended gameplay are all pulling in different directions, and I am just kinda baffled.
---
Happy Birthday, victims !
---
Ohhh yeah you're right haha my bad.
---
Quick info.
---
This error comes up every time the game gets some kind of patch or update. I end up having to verify my files before I can play. Anyone have any advice to fix this?
---
Yeah I play both and enjoy it. Not taking is to seriously is the key lol. Thinking getting a shitty "4k" is winning is ridiculous. Oh well...
---
None of that counters any of my arguments.
---
Everyone is complaining about an Oni nerf, when in reality it’s just a fix so he can’t stack flick turnrate with both joystick and keyboard.  He’s literally exactly the same just without that exploit.
---
Mettle of man is a shit perk now and will always be a shit perk until the day they turn the servers off! 
---
I’ve given up on it ever being a remotely decent perk and have spent countless hours now after the updates trying to make it work. Only way I can get tokens, is if I’m up the killers ass waiting for the down to block and take a hit and even then it still doesn’t count as a protection hit and that’s even me unhooking the guy and taking a hit! But I’m throwing the game just to try and get a shitty perk activated that you will only be able to use once in a match and BhVR likes here, you can use it 2 times! 
---
Maybe one day BhVR implements a Hardcore No Pussys allowed mode, where all the OG perks can have their shining spot back in the game!
---
I don't play to farm imaginary points. I play to kill all the survivors. Its fun. :)
---
Haha, you getting salty boi
---
Nah, just good headphones and your sound up.
---
Honestly, I gain satisfaction as a survivor main watching exit teabagging teammates get downed and camped... Watched a flashlight Nea teabag at the exit against a one shot-hatchet Huntress (this wasn't the first time she'd one shot of us so this Nea was just extra stupid). Just leave, man!!
---
All of them. All of the killers are getting nerfed.
---
You don't like seeing funny woman yelling at cat for the nine thousandth time?
---
Some people will be pissed no matter what.
---
I only bought 5 or 6 tiers, and I got to tier 70 over a week ago. It just requires a lot of playing.
---
I just can't do good with them at all.  His power is good, his shred is good, but I get stomped everytime I pull him out ):
---
Game is one of the best maps you can go to as survivor
---
Yeah you get what I'm saying. For fuck's sake, look at some of the replies on here. People saying the 4k shouldn't matter, it should be about points. Oh how fun, I only killed 1 survivor but I got 50k points! Yeah, no lol.
---
If there's another form of that GIF where only one eye is reading the book, then it's actual footage. I skipped over that one specific line while reading it
---
Nurses ability is legit broken whenever I play her because half the time it wont let me m1 after a blink or i try to blink and I get ear raped and cant tell how much it's actually charged
---
lol always nice to reminisce with fellow garbage
---
I have been editing many files a lot and I’ve never had this error. One of my friends had the same issue even tho she hasn’t changed a thing in the files like ever. reinstalling the entire game fixed it for her but it came back 3 patches later. Sadly I didn’t find a fix for her yet. If you find one, could you send it to me as well?
---
You don't need to worry.
---
Tapp and Ash are survivors, so the killer nerfs won't affect the sweaters.
---
Never seen that one. Is it funny?
---
Ah yes, my main is already a year old
---
I dont know what part of my reply you didnt read, but I ve played killer for 2 years. I'm the one who sets the tone for the game.  
---
If I feel like being a little bitch, I'd get a 4k every game.   Get 10k bp and get bored as fuck because theres no challenge in it. 
---
If I want to actually enjoy myself, get some bp, and have survivors actually enjoy themselves, I play my way.  Somehow I have a ton of fun.  
---
If u have fun playing your way, all the power to you.  Just dont come on here and whine about getting salty messages because you 100% earned them.  
---
Accept the fact that you're a toxic killer and co tinue playing your way and dont complain about being hated.  
---
It's quite simple really.
---
Imagine not making a cute sound when someone drops a pallet on you. 
---
This post was made by Piggy gang.
---
Same here. I have to verify steam files and re-download like 3 gigs each time. Total bummer
---
It's really overused on this subreddit
---
And you are why I slug. DS does not work then. Everything has a counter.
---
I play killer and as freddy matches do go on for a long time, but he's far from OP
---
I mostly rely on survivors relying on pallets just for it to be a fake
---
Literally every killer is viable depending on how you play them. This subreddits echo chamber of Legion is unplayable is idiotic. I 4k all day with him at red rank. He’s really fun to me.
---
Totally. This has been happening to me for so long now I've finally cracked and posted. Sometimes verifying the files doesn't even work. I end up having to delete the file in question and verifying so it downloads a new version.
---
“Fair cause rare” is not an argument.  They should be strong not overpowered.
---
1k like
---
Such is life for Tapp mains
---
Imagine having to hit a survivor twice 
---
Holy shit THEY FIXED THAT?? YES! YES!!
---
Nice, corruptet my gamefiles again.. must been the 10time that i had to reinstall dbd because of an "update".
---
"Fixed an issue that made Oni fun to play"
---
Lol god forbid a killer values their rank too. Some survivors don’t like losing rank progress when a killer applies pressure, stops gens and gets hooks. When you consider the fact that dbd tournaments are competitions amongst survivors with a killer that acts as a referee, the current state of the game makes a lot of sense.
---
As a console player all i see is a fairer playing field
---
No, you're supposed to have a few seconds of immunity. the main of the bug was due to delay speed between the killer and the dedicated server. If you lay a trap wait a moment before walking you're fine, but  that's a tedious chore to try and time your stepping over the trap to not be too early or too late, wrecking how most high rank trappers play.
---
Man I must play against only people who don’t play optimally then. Oops
---
Bong and a blintz?

Geez, oh my god, so sorry, i didn't noticed at all 🙃

Holy fucking god, I can play trapper again without everytime stepping back and moving around the fucking trap. It's already hard enough to play a lower tier killer.
---
I need Susie's sweater
---
For someone with no teachable killer perks yet unlocked and for survivor has SB, adren, self care, DS unlocked. Working thru hag for ruin and got into killer role; pretty new to it. Anything worth getting, like PGTW?
---
I'm a rank 1 killer on console as well and the frame rate "issue" is quite apparent. The problem with Oni is pretty much sensitivity. The best way to use his power is to dash at someone, use demon strike, and quickly flick to down them which isn't possible with the sensitivity atm on console. Oni is fine but without flicking, it takes away his optimization and it's why he's below PC Oni and isn't touched by anyone in red ranks besides a few people.
---
Awwww
---
Wait, charges addons on medkits don't work?
---
It does say that, it's just funny that a shot perk can't even get a break
---
So nerfed but only kinda. I don't know if it was a bug or what but she had no blink fatigue on a hit when I was playing her. I could immediately blink again with the second bar.
---
I think he's the most fun killer to go against, he's actually scary like killers should be.
---
You used to be cool.
---
Oh no please no
---
People will bitch no matter what, just play the game. Youre a killer, your goal is to kill people.
---
Lol you sound like such a sore loser. Maybe L2P?

I can see survivor 4 being that really toxic meg that just ran the killer round for 5 seconds before going down.
---
They weren’t since the chapter update, normally a green med kit with Gel dressing and gauze roll would give me 3 heals, and after the update they weren’t adding them and I could burn thru the medkit before healing myself 1 time...
---
Literally am a console player, quit ur whining cuz hes fine
---
So they still haven’t fixed the bug that causes you to get stuck after kicking a generator? Wonderful
---
The turn-rate on her teleport should be increased. I don't want to have 100 sensitivity at all times.
---
My girlfriend does the same to me and that’s healing I won’t be lying.
---
if they're in a wide open field you can just cancel the dash (1 second of not being able to attack) and slam them normally
---
For real, I got destroyed the other day as Myers playing against Red rank survivors (I'm rank 14 btw, great matchmaking). I was really frustrated of this game, and I expected to get shat on in the end game tchat but no, they were really cool and were surprised of the matchmaking as well. TLDR: be cool.
---
Yeah I've come to realize this. I don't let them win and I enjoy getting the 4k, guess I'm toxic. Oh well.
---
It says they're rolling 3.4.1 and this new one into one patch.
---
Its just sad at this point.
---
Me doing the spine chill archive
---
Shhh, let me have fun.
---
That's why I will also run Unbreakable, too. Or at least drop DS for it. I switch up my build a lot.
---
Guess you dont need selfcare anymore😂😂
---
Yeah ur a rank 20 killer or just a **liar**. Survivor is snoozefest with how mind-numbingly EZ it is. A My Little Poney game has more of a challenge than a survivor in dbd would ever face.
---
To me, the killer was spamming traps from the beginning of the game. I just walked in front of him as he was picking them up, and I got stuck. No one could save me, I couldn’t struggle, and I don’t the killer couldn’t pick me up either
---
You mean stacking with other perks or stacking with the other add-ons? Cause neither of those are good options. 
---
If freddys add-ons can't stack with perks then that raises questions as to why other add-ons can, I think that's a bad precedent to set.
---
Even if the add-ons didn't stack it still wouldn't matter. Most forever Freddy's just run the swing chains and for good reason. They are the only add-ons that matter.
---
Both are equally terrifying when starring you down.
---
Hahahahaha
---
In that case nurse must be the weakest killer because she has the lowest kill rate. 🤪
---
He hasen't done anything wrong per say, it's just that he has a personality that can get annoying very quick. Especially this whole *insert killer here* is viable because *insert most powerful add-ons and meta perks here* trend that he's been on.
---
Butt dancing in progress I repeat, butt dancing in progress
---
Because they are bad. M1ing is so hard for survivors hard.
---
I saw the stats but hey it’s really because lower tierd survivors find it hard to orientate. The truth is, nearly all pallets in the game is safe and you can run about three rounds before dropping them in an average chase. So against a common killer it’s super effective. To newer players who can’t find totem or gen, the game is about a death map; but to red ranks who knows where the pallets and loops are, it’s pretty fun.
---
Yamaoka Estate allowed me to complete the 5 traps in one trial Tome challenge.
---
Consoles should have absolutely no problems running DBD. It looks like an early PS3 game lol.
---
i mean ghost face IS the more efficient tbagger but pig can also spam her roar so its pretty close
---

---
I actually use this one singular totem on huntress. "oh someone's touched my totem?? well hehe.. SNIPE!"
---
Imo it largely depends on how many gens are left. If there's only 1 left, I'm going for the save. 2 left, it depends on how that person has been playing all game and if I have faith in it being worth it. 3 gens left? Suicide for hatch is the only way anyone walks out of here alive
---
Clown doesn't need a buff he needs a rework for fun to occur. His entire power just makes looping end slightly early and fuck with peoples vision, not super interesting.
---
Definitely not an Oni main, when he starts charging at you just keep moving in a straight line and wait at all pallets. also you should never heal and finally, if you get hit by his demon strike make sure to call the Oni a trash killer that requires 0 zero skill and should uninstall
---
probably me because I main nurse.
---
But I'm a survivor main tho.
---
This just means that there are no purple/red rank killers queueing up at a similar timeframe, so MM will just toss you into that lobby since you are the highest ranked killer it can find, and it assumes you'll stand more of a chance against them than some poor yellow rank killer. It sucks a lot, but i can understand why the system works the way it does. I just wish they'd give the killer some BP bonus or sth if he's forced to play against people in higher ranks than him.
---
Idk man i cant speak about his personality but whats wrong with a killer needing addons and good perks to be viable?

PC and console balance is very different. Updates must be optimized separately for both. IDK when BHVR will understand this...

Note for those who don't know Hepeating is a recent term that essentially means you say something that is met with little to no response. Somebody than says the exact same thing and is met with praise.
---
Hag is top 5, easy. The fact that people think she isnt blows my mind.
---
What did they nerf? I read the patch notes but didn’t see anything about this unless i missed it!
---
Fool me once shame on you
---
Agitation is still good, lets you get hooks out of the way and back to the patrol, similar it's unlikely the 3-4 needed hooks will be in that area. Whispers, discord, and maybe surveillance would work better in their build.
---
Yeah it's nothing exclusive but I think they said that not 100% of them will come to the shop, but I bet 95%.. so yeah.
---
I like the pass cause that you get more cosmetics than buying similar stuff in the shop.
---
I use only a few of the charms, but I use many of the clothings. I love the one of Claudette, Wraith and Megs is also nice. My favourite is clearly the nurse one and I use the pants for David king too. I use the hag ones too, because her event outfit causes lagging. Dwight is the only one I don't use.. so I'm pretty happy with the amount of good cosmetics
---
Just PGTW for this Shrine.
---
yes exactly, just taught ones you have a chance of getting, not all perks
---
I agree 100% I don’t really see why people are mad, it’s still a damn good exhaustion perk.
---
Do you play on console or something? I see you post here a lot and your takes usually seem off base to me.
---
Just trying to understand the disconnect.
---
Otz is an absolute gem, we don't deserve him.
---
I guess you don't play the game on a daily basis then. In balance, it's not as bad as people on Reddit and other forums paint it out to be.
---
How does this happen and why do I keep seeing videos of it posted?
---
Iridescent chains: after a survivor is hit with a chainsaw attack they are injured instead of downed. They are inflicted with the broken status for the remainder of the trial.
---
Laurie can heal me with her ass anytime 😏
---
food
---
I have 1k5 hour, mostly red ranks and 80% killer
---
1. He is far from too strong. Billy is relatively easy to loop, even experienced Curve Billy's can get ran on. Billy heavily punishes you for a bad play or being out of position. He's almost the perfect balance. If you're smart, understand routing, pathing and when to make a move you'll be fine for the most part. If you're being greedy, don't understand how to loop properly or juke at the right time, you'll be punished.
---
2. Fair enough I suppose, but 115 for Hag is a bit much. That's why when she has her 115% addon, she loses the ability to teleport.
---
3. I know that but any change to it seems like overkill. Spine Chill, a flashlight and decent awareness can help you dodge or see her tells. Though I will admit these won't work 100% of the time and it comes down to if you made the right move and if they're actually a good Spirit or not.
---
4. It's fine. Take proper angles and don't chase someone while in EW1 and you can get through it.
---
Your post makes sense tbh
---
I don't have any custom anything.
---
It has already been A YEAR?!
---
You got some nerve calling me a liar lmao, maybe im just good at the game?
---
food!
---
nEeD tO gET mY 4k! Yeah I'm the sore loser. Dumbass.
---
Sounds like you’re just bad.
---
There is a difference between losing and the killer giving up chase. 
---
I'm just telling you the optimal way of playing the game, take it or leave it.
---
Would this give Jane a hidden passive of healing 100% faster at all times due to more coverage area?
---
**S H O O K E T H**
---
IMO the whole issue of gen-rushing isn't necessarily doing gens but how quickly gens can be done by the most optimal survivors. A gen being done by 2 people can be done before I find one person without Ruin in green ranks...although that could be because I get matched with purple and red rank survivors.
---
technically speaking bbq was just in the shrine, and spirit can be bought for 9000 shards. plus the game has been free on every platform at least once. so the game is pretty f2p if you ask me. the reason it becomes p2w is because it takes so long to level anything up. plus, who wants to spend shards on characters when they can just buy them and use the shards on perks? it's not like mobile games where it's literally p2w.
---
Yep defiantly a lair.
---
Set amount of time. There was a bug that let you step in your own traps immediatly but it was fixed today.
---
I play PS4. How are my takes “off base” pray tell?
---
Sounds like you just don’t like that I don’t toe the narrative you want everyone to
---
People legitimately think gens should be even slower to complete? Lol
---
Never realized that it was bugged lol
---
Thats why I proxy camp
---
Personally I like the Sanctum better due to the vantage point, less patrol since it's smaller, and mostly because of the Buddha statues
---
I also haven't made it past rank 10 as killer.  I imagine at higher levels theres more hating in general.  
---
Sometimes it's not anything you did or didnt do, it's just people being salty.  
---
I've received messages from people telling me I was a fun killer to play against.  I had one group send me voice messages telling me how scared they were of my michael etc etc.  
---
I enjoy those messages all day :)   
---
I dont like to farm or play with survivors.  But if I can take a normal match and make it fun for everyone involved, isnt it so much more enjoyable?    
---
Personally I get bummed when someone dies on the first or 2nd hook.  I don't feel like I got the kill unless they're on the 3rd hook.  
---
Besides,  hooking everyone 3 times and getting a 4k or even a 3k is so much more satisfying.  
---
Like, you guys had all the time and chances to get away and do your gens but I was just too good. 
---
*Pats self on the back"
---
I get not everyone shares my mindset.
---
Very much so
---
Thanks, I’m not trying to argue with anyone I’m just trying to put my view on this game out there, I love this game so much and I enjoy the fact that the community is large enough to play often but if the constant toxicity that has been displayed continues it could potentially drive people away from playing or even buying the game, I don’t want that to happen that’s all! I love you all and I think you’re all great people!
---
Mr. Oni, I seem to not have enough cash. Guess I’ll have to find another way to pay....
---
You know you're forgotten when Bill and Laurie got cosmetics
---
Right
---
That’s why I wait a month to fully invest in a killer now. I’ll drop about half a million into them then grind bp while I wait to hear how they will be “adjusted”.
---
Tear Soaked Tenugui and Wooden Oni Mask
---
Those two add-ons are insanely good.
---
I’m a killer main and the concept of gen rushing is not a thing just like tunneling is not a thing. As a survivor the goal is to complete gens and as a killer anything short of circling or standing by a hook is valid. If I get 20 meters away and someone unhooks, if I haven’t found someone else or a gen I need to kick, I’m turning around. I want that 4K so I can rank up, nothing wrong with wanting to be competitive
---
Its fucking vile...
---
***THAT WAS ME. OINK OINK MOTHERFUCKER***
---
oh my god this so true, especially with Hag. Holy fuck once I start or begin a chase, the whole game starts to freeze up and it’s hard to land a hit sometimes or locate a survivor. Atrocious the FPS.
---
Idk about you but I have no sympathy for people who hate others with better lives. You dont really get more pitiful than that.
---
Atleast remove the mend timer to pause while sprinting. *sigh*
---
Proxy camp while gens get done. I count that as a win!
---
Your choice of cosmetic pairing on him pain me greatly

---
Happened almost nearly every time for me I thought it was just a new feature
---
Sadly i dont think so. I wish they would continue the decorated generators and hooks though.... its a shame.
---
They really went overboard with the new unsafe pallets.
---
Dunno about your lobbies, but the only people burning BPS's in my lobbies when i play killer are SWFs who queue up with toolboxes and keys, and against whom i would sweat my ass off nonetheless.
---
Ghostface mains are so fun to play with sometimes.
---
I just send gg through messages as killer.
---
They make to good of deepdish for me to do that to them.
---
It also said Nurse is the weakest killer
---
Ahh makes a little more sense now.
---
Well there’s a clear skill gap in killers on console vs PC due to killer being First Person and mouse and keyboard will always have that advantage over controller and on top of having lower frames on console.
---
These two things combined and I can see why you wouldn’t have as much trouble on survivor.
---
Playing survivor on controller is pretty comparable to PC but playing Killer is vastly superior on PC.
---
HAHA oh man.. this brings up my favorite spiteful thing I did recently.. 
---
3 of us near the gate, Oni comes after me.. I run him off so someone could open it, as soon as it's open I'm back there within 5 secs.. but nobody there.. and now I'm stuck in a mind game off with the oni on the loading dock of the game he's not budging from the entrance and i'm injured. If I try to go by... I'm dead.. if I run off he's gonna easily catch me and I'm dead.  with end game ticking down and go for it and I end up getting hooked. So what do I see? 
---
I see one of the dudes that was at the door is now way off just camping the hatch and the other person went to the other gate (which the 4th already opened and left) and was kind of hanging out then left.
---
Now they both could have easily just waited at the gate and taken a hit for me allowing us all to escape.. instead one went off for the hatch while the other went to the other door for some reason. 
---
It was my First hook, it was near enough to the door with a body block or BT could have easily made it and they didn't even attempt at a save.. I mean, not even a half ass attempt.. you now.. where you see the person just crouching behind something nearby.
---
so I just fucking stayed on hook and struggled until End Game collapses and killed him and me. And then in end game chat he fucking RAAAAAGEs proceeds to tell me what a piece of shit I am and how bad I am and why didn't I just die so he could escape.
---
&gt; The intel isn't very useful when it's a 32 metre radius
---
Not having to go check if a gen has progress saves more time than you think. You can slug/hook and get right back into the chase.
---
Also you’d be surprised how useful Surge is for a gen at top of Thompson house or the two hard to reach gens on Demo’s map. Knowing those gens are or are not being worked on is critical intel that no other perk gives.
---
&gt; The time saved is more than made up for by the extra regression, especially if you're playing a mobile killer.
---
Yea and that’s my point, and you have to consider the time it takes to pick up a survivor, hook, return to gen, and pop. Whereas Surge activates at the point of the down and begins to regress. You have to consider that extra regression time when downing. Also pop forces you to pick up and hook, which is a crucial point most people miss. If your playstyle is to immediately hook every survivor you down, then ok. But at red ranks, you need to slug and snowball pressure and Pop literally denies you from doing that if you want to get value from it. Also Surge could hit multiple gens. Also Surge meshes great with Surveillance. (Pop is horrible with Surveillance).
---
This is true but if the developers wanted it any different they would’ve changed the numbers, it is intended and yes sometimes it is extremely frustrating but we have to realise such is life. You win some you loose some and with every loss there is something you can take from that and work on, making yourself better so next time you’re more prepared. It’s how you get better, even players like Monto, puppers and Noob (to name a few) make mistakes and loose games and these players are staples of our community and of the best players I’ve seen.
---
Don’t expect to pick up the game and be so good that you never loose and have flawless games because that’s kinda delusional😅
---
I'm a big fan of the panic slash.
---
Came here to say that I got excited to see Bonesaw and then read this whole meme out loud in his voice.
---
It happens when you have multiple traps very close together. It causes a bug which shifts the other traps to your position when you stand in one which causes an infinite loop until the other traps get disarmed by Survivors. Try it out yourself as Trapper. Just gather them up, place them all down close together, stand in one  and enjoy not being able to move.
---
I’ll forever remember when a trapper triple trapped someone on a hook, stepped in his own trap, someone saved the hooked survivor, he tried M1’ing her but stepped in his 2nd trap, everyone dipped, and then he stepped in his 3ed trap trying to chase people around the hook lmfaoooo
---
heh, late 90s gay jokes. Love 'em!
---
The nerf was fucking needed. Those two together was absolutely fucking miserable to go against
---
Try to play as Killer without directional sound/good sound at all. Was rank 20 for days. Back when Rank 20s would pair against 8-10s since matchmaking averaged.
---
Dumb question, but how do you accumulate the stuff to pay for these perks?
---
I've been buying a few here and there but just wondering how I get more to spend.
---
Im killer main and I must say I personally can still play with every killer trey nerfed and get rank up and thats because this nerf just did like nothing oni for example doesn't necessary need this add on or legion was "nerfed" only because his attack in his power doesn't count as standart attack com one that was only necessary for perk build or ghostface just stalk from a little away and then come near expose and then chase ez
---
yea, i miss the oni so much.
---
Pfft. The Huntress took out entire squads of german soldiers armed with guns, a couple of survivors with hatchets ain't nothin' to her.
---
It's only in the steam patchnotes, so if you read any other one, it's not there
---
I have several clips of me getting it to work and I still get it to work pretty regularly, but yeah the insta-down m2 killers (the chainsaw bros) can entirely counter the perk
---
pc killer mains this is going to ruin oni 
---
console killers not giving a shit because they cant flick
---
I watch a lot of PC streaming and survivors don't seem be in the throes of defeat like you constantly all are here
---
so uh i dunno about that, man
---
I completely ignore survivors at loops when oni’s power is activated now
---
Thank you, sir, for helping fucktard get his shit straight and to stop being cringe
---
How was he nerfed?
---
I just chill catch a breather from all the running and hiding while teammates fix the gens
---
That wouldn't fit in dbd
---
You're are incredibly naive to think he is gone.  The majority of the build relied on thana/dying light with the add-ons as a bonus more than anything.  Even without running the ropes/chains, general gen management knowledge (or surveillance if lazy) means you still aren't escaping in a 20 minute timeframe.
---
LOL, I will say though, seeing the VR sticker got me thinking: a VR mode for killer games would be pretty freaking sweet.
---
His demon dash is now just Billy, but slower and more forgiving yet also needs time to build, versus where he was with a power that let you do things Billy couldn't. There's really not a good reason to play him now other than you just aren't good with Billy and need the added maneuverability when dashing around the map.
---
He's worse than Billy. It's like if they took away Plague's ability to hit multiple people with the Corrupt Purge but left everything else about it intact.
---
What?
---
Them killing themselves on hook isn't mercy, that's "Fuck this I'm out"
---
*Laughs in legion ugly sweaters*
---
Why did I hear Benny hill playing in my head while watching this
---
Of course, however there's a big difference between feeling envy and getting consumed by it.
---
One of the killers, Legion, has a sweater so in the future I assume more will get a sweater as well.
---
r/dbdgonebi ?
---
The problem with that line of thinking is that a survivor does not get nerfed, only perks do unless they change survivor audio or something. A killer is their power and add-ons: Legion can't become as consistently good as Nurse, even if they both use the same perks.
---
Claudete hasn't goten ugly sweater either.
---
First off, what? Second, oni is bad now not because of the add on nerf but because he can't flick anymore. At all.
---
Is that right? If you can’t get a full heal it’s obvious bugged, but a full heal should be 16 charges, (3 heals would then be 48) and what you’ve described only provides 44.
---
Ok, I just looked up the freddy one and it's not that bad. Freddy is still a top tier killer.
---
And then the killer will take that experience and learn from it, bettering their chasing game so that next time that doesn’t happen, you aren’t going to win every game.
---
You can still do gens when Ruin is up. You are not forced to cleanse the hex and if you go for the hex instead of working through Ruin, it's your fault if no gens get done. If you hit in the black part of a Ruin skill check, get off the gen until the sparks are gone. You can also gen tap if you know  how to do it correctly.
---
Such a badass song
---
*Laughs harder*
---
Because I dont waste money on cosmetic stuff
---
Simple as.
---
Good thing rank reset is in two days :)
---
I read the patch note they realy just changed the add on
---
Why is ash the only character that talks
---
Well we got ourself a Freddy only main.. waking up is not the problem.. it's that you go wake up, avoiding the killer on the way back to avoid double pressure, then go back to gen, by then 30ish seconds pass, (if you are super quick and it's nearby 10 seconds, 30-50 seconds later.. wow look! Even if Freddy doesn't force you off the gen and is still in chase.. you are back asleep.. smell the roses, I play both sides and it's not the waking up that's hard.. it's staying awake and pressuring gens as a survivor. Hopefully this helps you see why people are happy the add ons were nerfed.
---
He himself wasn't nerfed, just some of his add-ons
---
Freddy was nerfed today, huntress isn’t viable against red rank swf without iri-heads, nurse is only viable on pc cause console frame rate kills her ability, Spirit is cool and you can 4K against a swf group but you have to be immaculate meanwhile survivors can make plenty mistakes as long as two focus on gens, hag is not viable at all against swf cause they can coordinate and have 2-3 survivors run thru your traps then you have to choose which to go to and waste a whole bunch of time chasing and setting traps with her incredibly slow base speed while the rest do gens. Billy is an ok option too but good luck using ability against infinite loops.
---
She has
---
I swear some people turn their brains off around Trapper.
---
Thats what i saw lol, so it looked to me like oni got a slight console buff.
---
Playing killed sucks so hard. I’ve stopped playing for a while now, each time I have the urge I remember how frustrating it is most of the time and how sweaty I have to play and how forced into the meta the killer role is, bleh.
---
Gonna get downgraded into oblivion for saying this but... If one is allowed to play like that, which is not against any TOS, in an asymmetrical PvP game then people shouldn't be mad at the player. Developers made it so and they are the only ones who are capable of changing the way people play. It's very naive to think that by complaining to other players about the way they play in a PvP game will change anything, it's the devs who they should complain to, obviously with logic.
---
Sometimes I feel like those who complain about the "no fun" in DbD never had any real experience with a PvP game (especially MMO) and played only singleplayer games, which is fine imo, you can like whatever you want. I just believe these people don't realize there is a real human being on the other side which might play the way they didn't want him to(again, not talking about hacking, exploiting glitches and not following the objective of the game) because it's the nature of a PvP game.
---
I'm not implying it's ok to, let's say, don't follow an objective, for example, running around at the base doing nothing in a game like Overwatch, especially on ranked, that's just being an asshole and is definitely not fun. DbD is less complicated, it's asymmetrical after all, it's the players who make it complicated.
---
"Don't do this because you will be called bad"  
---
"You have to play this way because otherwise you are ruining my fun"  
---
I could expand on this, but there is not need to, I know people don't share my views.
---
People are hostile because they still live in a bubble and when the reality strikes it they respond with hostility.
---
That actually sound like exactly how camping should be lol, a vacation
---
Well, technically it’s both. It’s a bug that resulted from dedicated servers.
---
You see
---
It would hurt nobody at all
---
Benefit for both side
---
Ah yes, it's so fun to watch the killer's weapon miss you by a massive gap, only to get hit and fall to the ground like 5 feet behind where you actually were on your screen. It wasn't perfect then, but the game worked much better before dedicated servers. Between matchmaking taking 15+ minutes sometimes, getting hit through pallets/windows or by hatchets that curve 90 degrees in the air, and fun new game-breaking bugs that pop up every other update, it really speaks to this game's potential that so many of us still play it all the time. I just wish they fixed serious problems instead of releasing DLC and cosmetics. I know it's different teams working on those things, but I'd be thrilled if BHVR put everyone they had to work on network and matchmaking issues and not have any new DLC or cosmetics until the real issues are fixed.
---
I'm gonna miss playing Forever Freddy. At least I'll still be Time-Consuming Freddy.
---
I tested it about an hour ago. Fixed confirmed.
---
That’s beautiful
---
Wow, I'm blackpilled on ever playing killer again.
---
Me too, but after a single game on him after these nerfs I really regret buying and leveling him to P3L50. It was extremely fun: to turn your mouse and character at maximum angle possible to land that hit. It felt really satisfying and was really useful in chases. Now, well, you don't use his power in chases, devs just made another "fair" killer, who basically has nothing against good survivor.
---
These arguments are allways hilarious because it creates such a devide. Game design 101
---
Create characters and mechanics overpowered so that they can be tweaked on a later basis.
---
You cant run the risk of it being underpowered at the start as you wont get the hard data you need to fix it, as no one will want to play it, or have the oppertunity to create the stretegies that determine balancing.
---
So things are constantly going to get nerfed, especially since in a game like dead by daylight  with so many core mechanics being vastly interchangeable and constantly updated with new dlc theres gonna be a lot of time before anything can be considered balanced, if ever. 
---
Think of dlc and reworks as a ripple in water, every second it takes is an update that attempts to balance or calm the water. But every dlc and character rework is a rock thrown into the water. 
---
Its probably never going to stop, and it never has, people were used to it then, they will be now.
---
Game is not going to die, if the game wasnt being updated with killers getting nerfed  or anything else, the game would most certainly have died allready
---
I know.
---
There are always who complain.
---
Cant make everybody happy
---
No free ones bill has free ugly sweater this asshole
---
##H U N G E Y
---
The fact they felt the need to nerf add ons by 3-4% is nuts lol. Speaks to the unnecessary killer nerfs lately. Spirit was the only killer that absolutely needed it
---
I agree that some killers have been nerfed way to much, however aren't killers in the best state they've ever been in right now? Like, survivors are still stronger, but it used to be way worse with pallet vacuum, 2 pallet loops, insta flashlight, etc.?
---
That Oni add on was way to strong and needed a nerf. Not proud of it but I used it to to get into purple rank
---
You can't do that flick anymore (turn after releasing a demon strike). This change completely killed his power in most loops and made it extremely easy to dodge his power with 180 jukes.
---
Different mentality from the devs that is, not the players. The devs never intended for their game to blow up, they intended it to be a spooky immersion game, but look at where we are now.
---
Laughs in xbox
---
Good.
---
It's that he is making the point that the KILLER is viable, not the build, and people want to make this known to him but he is being oblivious since everyone tried explaining to him his Spirit 'counter' isn't a counter but a way to waste like 20 seconds in an ideal scenario where everything goes in the survivors favour.. from what I've gathered anyway the DbD community is a weird bunch.. makes it Interesting however.
---
i never ran forever freddy builds myself. i only ever run fake pallets paired with either drawing/sketch/masterpiece or shirt/dress. however, i feel like i'm the only person who didn't see forever freddy builds as anything more than a minor inconvenience. it's super easy to counter the build. all you have to do is wake up, which is pretty easy to do. i feel like a lot of people just didn't like the element of having to wake up.
---
You get iridescent shards from increasing your player level. Be sure to play at least one killer AND survivor game per day, because the first game of the day for each role gives you bonus experience.
---
Billy's chainsaw is put on cooldown, so he can't use his chainsaw after using it. Revving your chainsaw but not using it results in a longer cooldown, flicking with the chainsaw sprint is no longer possible and Billy can only run in a straight line, chainsaw sprint is reduced in speed by 20%,  and a missed chainsaw sprint plays a Bubba-style long missed attack animation.
---
Ok. I'm wrong on that one then. I got ~3500 hours, also got to red ranks, and I'm like 65% killer. 
---
But do you agree with what OP is saying? Like he's talking out of his buttcrack for crying out loud.
---
It's so cute you think you play well :) keep sweating you tryhard.
---
Tapp tried it once. Didn't end well for him.
---
Lolol oni was the example I used but he has to collect blood for his instant down and map mobility.
---
 Spirit has a lowered movement speed like hag or huntress but does not have an instant down.
---
Freddy has map mobility when his bar fills up and again no instant down.
---
The demo has to set a limited number of portals, warps on a cool down and doesn't have an instant down.
---
Billy has no downsides like a lowered movement speed, no hoops to jump through and can sprint across the map with a negligible cool down before moving around normally.  I like Billy and I think he's in a good but he is not a balanced killer like Freddy.
---
I don't think they need to explain that. 
---
If they could pump out content for licensed content then they most definitely would... the fact they don't should probably explain the reason.
---
I try to stay far from the basement unless i really need to

I think the issue is less about using good add-ons, but claiming they are top killer while running the iri add-ons. People aren't saying Huntress is the best killer because her iri add-on gives her instant downs on her hatchets.
---
Like there's merit to the Wraith build Tru did, but I don't think his build + silent bell add-on makes Wraith a top 4 killer.
---
The "Wow INCREDIBLE" announcer meme plays over a sped up "Pretty good job so far"
---
*Some of freddy’s add ons were slightly nerfed
---
They should make it so he steps over them.
---
Im goimg to get premium at the 18th because Iam rank 65 so I instantly get my money back if you wouldn't get it back there I wouldn't buy it
---
Yea you don’t have to wait
---
What? How is that even a Tru3 thing? Lol
---
When you cannot feasibly get more than two gens done the entire match entirely because the killer chose add-ons and perks that make the generators take an additional 20+ seconds, on a killer can also teleport to gens and make use of Pop goes the weasel to set you back potentially 40 seconds with one kick, yeah that’s no fun. You COULD win but it takes fucking ages and is really boring and a waste of time you could be playing another match with.
---
And if it doesn’t glow,it also goes
---
Nah more like constantly noticed because I’m 7’4” the whole game
---
All "like Billy", except with downsides. Billy has no real downside.
---
Yeah survivors can vacuum up blood orbs now, and then just loop killer so aura doesn’t matter
---
I know Tru3 can say some questionable things, but can we have a day where we don't bash on the man? Fuck I thought it was bullshit when he says he gets so much hate, but I see these threads weekly.
---
Idk though because i would say spirit is viable but thats only with add ons. I mean she doesnt need anything crazy but just base kit i think is kind of weak. But id still call her viable
---
Was that before the huge bug fix patch if yes then they where probaly swf and one of them had the bug and just lettet them kill you.
---
I didn't know that Billy could charge into jungle gyms and still kill survivors, I'll have to try that feature out.
---
I love how much people overreact to needed nerfs. Lol
---
You forgot to teabag for for ultimate toxicity
---
If it was really that bad, I'm glad I only got him to 43.
---
It was only strong on like two maps, but it was OP on Haddonfield. They didn't nerf BL because it was strong, they nerfed it because of how annoying killers thought it was to play against it on Haddonfield. 
---
Killers already have perks that give more bloodpoints or help with bloodpoint gains but no one uses them because they're useless in most matches. BBQ is the most used one because it's actually good.
---
Was more obvious in real time, with the flickering. Even if I hadn't noticed it during the initial spawn camera pan, it was visible from the generator that's right next to me.
---
Only stealth killers are in a good state if you want to play competitively. If your against a red rank swf group any non stealth killer will be punished by infinite loops which can only be beat by wasting time getting bloodlust and having these extended chases while the other members of swf group do gens together. The unpredictability of stealth is crucial to get 4K and maintain rank

Yes.. I find standing still and get mind fucked by no alteration in animation whatsoever very 'weak'.. and to those who say "JuSt RuN aWaY".. then she just phases and you are injured/downed
---
Really? Took me about 2 seconds on the search bar to find that.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d7mx95/steam_update_problems/
---
Ive had it installed on 3 entirely different systems on 5 different storage units. And ive had that problem on all of them.
---
It’s more to do with the fact most of his addons are useless, especially the blocks.
---
The nerf negates half of his new power, which is based on game slow down.
---
Now the sleep mechanic is basically a useless condition to allow me to use my basic ability.
---
The slowdown made sense, since you are denied most of your power when survivors aren't asleep.
---
Now the incentive to ever wake up as a survivor is basically 0 and survivors can ignore sleep at virtually no cost
---
You don't realize that these changes only make two of his add-ons useless and the swing chains only loses 4% which on forever Freddy is pretty much nothing. This nerf didn't do anything.
---
No, it was yesterday night, a couple days after the patch.
---
Congrats for reposting
---
True. Feeling envy because you're poor and the rich have it all is normal, but letting it keep you from surviving day-to-day isn't good. I know some people have situations where they can't dig themselves out but don't give up trying just because someone has it easier.
---
 Nothing in the patch notes.
---
Huntress is still viable without iri heads it's map dependent though. I've seen some good nurses on console, but you're right it's rare. The hag part? I've seen some pretty good hags. You gotta remember if there are 2-3 survivors trying to mess with your traps while you are chasing someone, thats pretty much only 1 or 0 people doing gens from the gens from the start, and you can place traps instantly at loops. The freddy nerf barely dented him, he's still one of the strongest killers in the game who can teleport and have good map pressure on lerys and the game and shorten loops with his blood pools. And to be fair, if you're a stealth killer you have to deal with infintes too, at least with billy you can instantly abandon the loop and chase someone else. Can't really do that with other stealth killers besides maybe wraith with windstorm add ons. Spirit? Idk man, spirit's ability is still really strong and favors her greatly on any loop, just watch scottjund, its the survivors who have to play immaculate if they wanna stand a chance.  But depending on the map i guess she suffers from map pressure? Still guaranteed to do well with her though. Against most killers really, if the stars align and you're on like, haddonfield and the survivors are the most optimal shits in the world, then yeah survivors are unbeatable. But the killers I mentioned probably stand a better chance than stealth killers in those situations anyways.
---
He uses realy god perks
---
"All together"
---
I kinda feel bad for her now
---
Well it sounds like they're planning to revert some of the change or at least try and tweet his controls again soon. This was part of a post on the Forum just now: 
---
"While we think these changes are introduced to improve the game, we did hear a lot of feedback on the turn speed and controls changes. We feel there is something to improve there.
---
Our design team is planning on changing the turn rate ratio to improve on the feeling of the Dash, allowing you to freely move your camera within the limit. This will be included in a later update."
---
Missed opportunity by the devs! There’s always next year!
---
Dought they’ll have a tomb for licensed characters since they don’t actually own them
---
He's a very good player but also a good streamer and a good sport.
---
This combo is rarer than most people realise.
---
Removal of double pallets, rework of map tiles, removal of infinites, hatch reworked, End Game Collapse
---
Quite the selective memory you got there.
---
One time I caught a guy in the end game collapse, took him down to the basement and then promptly stepped in my own trap at the bottom step. I reset the trap and grabbed him again near the exit gate and took him all the way back downstairs...and then stepped in my stupid trap again. I felt like the biggest idiot and just let him go after downing him again. I was sort of hoping he thought I did all that intentionally. Lol.
---
Yes only by like 3-4% which speaks to the unnecessary nerfs lol. He is still viable imo tho due to dream state he puts survivors in. Only a matter of time until more nerfs on him
---
imagine screeching about Ruin lmfao
---
Yeah, I dont know if anyone complained about those add ons specifically anyways. Oni definitely didnt deserve any nerfs he got recently though.
---
Bold of you to assume I'm going to save all my cells
---
Someone’s not thankful.
---
This meme is astonishingly good. Great job, OP!
---
Its not just for the trapper its for other killers aswell they are all glitching out like ealier i couldnt even throw a bottle for clown until half way through the game because it didnt allow me to do so it was like going into the animation and then just stopping
---
Why not bring Bill's hatch perk?
---
You are wrong in saying that he cannot accept a single loss, he doesn't accept unfair losses, not ones where he gets outplayed
---
I like this. Merry happy 1st bday knife bros.
---
I keep hearing about alleged Doctor rework changes coming soon that seem to have some creedence. 
---
Where is this information coming from? I'd like to see it from the official sources, if possible, because I love the Doctor and I'm not sure if I should be happy about these changes bringing him up to par or not.
---
That's kind of exactly why it's a dumb idea. Crippling one person's ability to do the objective for the entire match isn't a good idea in any way.
---
I just bought Jeff and legion and am excited to use them but I heard nothing but bad things about ghostface and legion. Why are they your favorite?
---
Farming is the most boring shit.
---
They also changed the way you turn during his demon charge thing which hurt his ability.
---
Actually, a higher tick rate server would make gameplay smoother. It updates the game state 3x as often as 20Hz servers so interactions between killer and survivor are more consistent.
---
Thana + sloppy + dying light + ruin/PGTW + 2 of his 3 slow down addons made for painfully slow gens.
---
didn't you hear the bloody trap?
---
Consistent, I like it :)
---
psst
---
those stats are junk
---
That's the problem. Oni can't do that any more either.
---
That was the thing that made the trade off for charging his power worth it, but he can't flick around a corner any more to end loops early because most of his turn speed is now at the END of the swing instead of him having a responsive and smooth turn throughout the swing. You come around the corner like a semi then suddenly turn on a dime, but by then you're so far past the corner that you've missed them.
---
The only way you're popping people around a corner is starting your swing early then hoping they just sit there. Or swing at the corner and hope they don't just hug the loop like they ought to be.
---
That's a way to put it if you want do diminish the nerf.
---
Or you could admit that the items is 33% less effective, which is a gigantic nerf that almost no add-on in the game would jot be changed by.
---
Now with 1 and 2 survivor asleep, the debuff is nothing.
---
On the old one, with 2 asleep, the debuff started to matter
---
But with 'Forever Freddy' it will still take a long time to do things while asleep.. and pressuring survivors to stay asleep is literally Freddy's whole gimmick, he is classed as Hard for a reason, as the way he is to be played relys on that pressure.
---
He just always says optimal
---
Nah man it’s spring wood 3 and 5 for me. I’m so sick of it, even if it may be a survivor-advantaged map I don’t care. Send to me yamaoka, I won’t be able to see anything because of how dark it is but at least I won’t be in springwood
---
Are you by chance of console my friend?
---
Honestly, with survivors like that playing real dumb. Any killer can come back.
---
Eh, I play both roles at red ranks so BS on either side is pretty annoying.
---
GG EZ baby killer, ples uninstell peppega olol :)
---
Yes nothings more fun the chainsaw running around the map and someone runs straight into you :)
---
Nice I always liked the fire starter. I was leaning toward sobble this time around
---
It does seem rare but not a me problem. Just using "steam files update" on the search bar to find that, and i didnt bother to look if there are any others.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cgw9j0/with_every_update_comes_another_file_integrity/
---
Ive had it installed on 3 entirely different systems on 5 different storage units from at least 3 different manufacturers. And ive had that problem on all of them. Although it seems to be rare. But not unique.
---
One time I caught a guy in the end game collapse, took him down to the basement and then promptly stepped in my own trap at the bottom step. I reset the trap and grabbed him again near the exit gate and took him all the way back downstairs...and then stepped in my stupid trap AGAIN. I felt like the biggest idiot and just let him go after downing him again. I was sort of hoping he thought I did all that intentionally. Lol.
---
They were supposed too but are meerly cosmetics
---
That's it? What a surprise that everyone in red ranks wants to play optimally. Lol
---
Because he is a killer with high map awareness and control.  Punishing those who have bad awareness is part of it.
---
Ghostface because I love scaring the living fuck out of people and getting salty messages tbh.
---
Makes huge noise/ presence known just about everywhere
---
It sounds like we agree for the most part. Most killers are only viable when all these different factors come together besides a player just being a great killer. Freddy is still viable for now but I fear those small, 3-4% unnecessary nerfs are a sign of more nerfs coming. Spirits nerf that makes her more static during phase walk took away a bit of the anti-loop power but I agree she can still be viable. Huntress like you said has to depend on a perfect map which imo is not viable. Thing about the hag situation is when you’re high rank and all survivors are swf at least 2 will be following each getting gens done while the other two destroy your trap setups which forces you to choose 1 to chase because hag is very very slow you will not win a chase against any good survivor. If you decide to reset traps you will lose cause by then gens are done. I used to main hag and had to drop her at the higher ranks because she’s capped at 2k-3k if you play well and 4K if swf group sucks but that’s only IF they suck. Billy is still viable with info perks of so you can know where survivors are due to his overwhelming speed even if only use his ability to traverse the map. Every non stealth killer will suffer greatly against a good swf group just cause of infinite loops alone, never mind the nerfs. Only way to beat a infinite loop with a non stealth killers is to waste A LOT of time getting bloodlust and engaging in extended chases. Stealth killers can just use ability and gain the advantage at loop or opt to go after someone else.
---
Clown and fun do not belong in the same sentence, to be fair.
---
He knows....
---
But did they fix the vacuum effect that traps have? I got teleported into a trap when I was chasing a survivor and I still have no clue what happened to be honest. I was walking around my trap and I got yoinked to the left and into the trap :c
---
When you start chasing one, another one breaks the totem, even more with doctor, he's got tracking but nothing more, that's why he's getting a rework
---
"Put more gen pressure". A gen takes 48 seconds to be fully repaired. I'm sorry math is not your strong suit.
---
Lmao. This was great.
---
It's loud as fuck so your position is announced almost all the time, unwieldy to use (not easy to turn through most obstacles), you get penalized for bumping into objects
---
Healing speed, teleporting during pallet drops, fast vault triggers, exhaustion. It’s actually insane how much easier killer is compared to 2-3 years ago.
---
Almost missed the Tom Clancy thing.
---
Def still fine I just hope they don’t nerf him to death when survivors complain those small nerfs to him aren’t enough. This is usually how it starts
---
You know what, I think you're swaying me. I'll try it out on my Demo
---
I wasn't saying Wraith isn't viable, just that I don't think he's in the top 5. In general I don't think there's a killer who is completely unviable. Just a lot of killers require more effort than just playing spirit.
---
But if you aren't using the best rope, what's the problem with using Regression Freddy with a slowdown add-on?
---
I love switching to plague when I see 4 medkits, completely nullifies their item!
---
Yeah, he's the only reason I have twitch installed, I even was able to sub with amazon prime. He will get triggered sometimes but that's to expect, especially in this game.
---
What should I replace self heal with
---
Omfg this is so funny!! How can the second person not check
---
Well tbh I typically play with we’re gonna live forever so perk slots are that important to me. I prefer to have one exhaustion perk and unbreakable to counter slugging
---
People are allowing up to Yellow addons but yes, you don't need any addons to stand still as spirit lol
---
Oni is just a worse billy with extra steps.
---
2 of them were pretty good actually. There's a reason why they completed 5 gens with 4 alive. Claudette just miss calculated her adenaline sprint past me and ace chose to leave the jungle gym and was a split second too late to turn the corner around cow tree and by doing so also gave away quentin on accident.
---
Isn't it a huge hindrance to play DBD with no sound? There's so many audio cues linked to almost all killers, skill checks and heart beat.
---
Getting some strong PS2 Spiderman vibes here.
---
Crap
---
It does the Job, but no it's the strongest survivor perk. Borrowed and decisive are more mandatory than Unbreakable.
---
It's still a meta perk imo
---
It could fit his aesthetic pretty well. :)
---
On pc survivors can do anything a console player can do but better loop, hit great great skill checks, 360 you name it. Now oni gets countered by a 360 on pc...
---
No he isn't fine anymore, he was before the only thing you had to do to more or less counter him was to go to a loop / safe place when you heard him enter demon mode. There used to be a slim chance to down a survivor at loops but now there isn't... 
---
Also the PTB is a thing for a reason I guess...
---
It’s not supposed to “help” with the grind, it’s just there so you actually get more stuff as you play.
---
Well yes that was never in doubt. I'm not saying they can just add any without getting approval. What I mean is they personally aren't limited by whether a cosmetic is canon or not. Maybe if they bring it to the license holder and they don't like it not being canon that's one thing. I simply mean the fact that Pig and Tapp have non canon outfits prove the devs themselves aren't constrained to existing lore.
---
I wouldn't say Oni was in a good place. Once he got his power he would just faceroll teams.
---
At least Freddy has it :)
---
That's a weakness? It's not like the Oni or Demo make a ton of noise whilst also having genuine weaknesses.
---
Aww, thanks.
---
FUD
---
That’s the problem. It should give a bonus exp for people who pay for it. The grind is already bogus.
---
I was saying that yes I wanted the add-ons nerfed not Freddy himself
---
Imagine not being able to stalk 
---
This comment was made by the stealthy-bois
---
I mean Ive only leveled the original 3 release killers, but I just mean in general when there are different rarities of consumable tems that make a player stronger, I think ideally the highest rarity one should not have a penalty, and if it can’t be ‘weakened’ in some way (cooldown, smaller effect, etc) to make it not OP while still being the highest tier then magbe it shouldnt be an item of highest tier. If dbd already doesn’t do that I suppose it useless for me to argue, but thats just how I feel.
---
I'm upset it isn't "Alcohol is not an Escape" or that it IS an escape.. so many options.
---
They should have just made it sonthe add-ons don’t stack tbh
---
I completely agree! It would be something a little different for him, and I think every character should have some cosmetics that stand out from the other ones
---
Killer at high rank are painfull most of the time, you have to tryhard your life against rank 1 SWF, it's a race the second you start the game, you have to make 0 mistakes or you lose ... i won't talk about their toxicity  
---
But Killers are nerf and nerf again, Nurse and Spirit were deserved but not that hard, legion nerf is outrageous, and Oni first nerf at the release and the second now are non-sense ...   
---
If "balance" for you means 1 year will be the year for killer, next will be for survivor by nerfing or buffin one or another each year, yeah i totaly agree with OP, less and less killer tired of the game won't play anymore = longer queue
---
What was changed?
---
Ah fair enough, I had no idea about the intended immunity. I've been playing the game for well over a year at red ranks and had no clue. The more you know.
---
None of the perks are really mandatory. Even if they were I still think Unbreakable has the strongest effect in the game.
---
Luv me Bubba. I just Suuuuuuuuuuuuck when I play him.
---
It is annoying that it limits my options when the games get tough.
---
My iridescents are mostly useless without the benefit of the ropes, so I'm left with pill box (which is filthy, I'll admit) and class photo which alter my gameplay without being strictly better.
---
I feel like I got cheated out of my supply of "make this game winneable against a tough team" add-ons without any warning, PTB test or announcement. 
---
Hell I even learned about Forever Freddy only after I started wondering about the nerf
---
Waking up does not counter Dying Light/Thanatophobia/Pop Goes The Weasel on a killer that has an infinite-range teleport, and most people ignore you if you try to wake them up even in red ranks, especially since it eventually gets as slow as healing after only a few assisted wakeups. It’s almost like Freddy actually *wants* you to be running around the map doing anything other than gens just to try and counter his assisted gen slowdown build, and that the add-ons only made that common build even more oppressive, gee whiz! Not only that, this was a killer that previously had the ability to completely ignore the effects of Borrowed Time, regardless of whether or not the unhooker was awake! 
---
They didn’t even remove the add-ons, they just made it slightly less of a slog to play through when it does get used, which is totally fine in just about any sane person’s eyes. No need to be a cunt.
---
BILL BILL BILL
---
Nancy, Steve, Yui and Jane
---
Base freddy is really good anyway, you don't really need add ons on him.
---
Simmilar situation to Demo where base power is good enough to stand on its own and the add ons are just a small bonus.
---
They fixed the infinite survivor carry music. God bless.
---
I would just fire back with "actually how dare you try to escape when I am supposed to kill you"
---
lol complaining about noed
---
Yeah, I agree with you for the most part. I honestly say what I say about hag based on what hag mains have told me, not really on my overall experience with the killer so I can't really refute what you're saying.
---
I'm still using Thantaphobia on Freddy simply because Freddy is the best at slowing everything down.
---
Best Feeling &lt;3
---
What are your favourite killers/survivors?
---
Demo's isn't direction, Oni is hard to pinpoint as survivor and is a bit more hidden
---
It's not a total weakness but it's not like that shit will sneak up on you.
---
Billy's map mobility isn't like some free teleport; you pretty much tell all survivors where you're going, and once you spot someone you have a stun + have to catch up and actually get looped
---
Agreed. I’m rarely being slugged, even up against killers like Myers and Oni. Unbreakable for me is sort of.... wasteful. I rather use that slot for a different perk.
---
i've never related to anything on reddit more than this
---
Yeah, switching to Nurse to learn her even a few weeks after a derank was just brutal. Seemed like every player knew how to juke me and be just far enough away that I'd miss my lunge and get to enjoy the full duration pause after to run to the next jungle gym or whatever. 
---
I'm still not good at her, but I've gotten some 4Ks when the stars align and I land some clutch hits at the right time. But I am still totally bullyable and it is agonizing.
---
Ik same. I was hoping deliverance would be a perk in the shrine this week but sadly it wasn’t.  Hopefully they’ll  add it in next week.
---
It wastes time and only stops the sleep for a short amount.
---
I think he’s really good after some practice. It’s like learning to play nurse on console...rough to start out and then stronger than you think. He’s fine on loops. Longer loops allow you to charge preemptively and catch up. On short loops just hit them and don’t dash.
---
R.I.P Oni, you'll be missed
---
That's a really bad argument my friend. Cause percentage is relative.
---
If forever Freddy relied soley on the swing chains then yeah it's an enormous nerf, but it doesn't. The swing chains are the springboard for thana and dying light and pop goes.
---
Understand I don't think they need to be nerfed I think they need to be changed to something entirely different. Forever Freddy is stupid, but it's stupid to think he's gone just cause he lost 4%.
---
Do you know how high of a slow you can get with that build? I've played my fair share of forever Freddy matches and I'll tell you it is not hard to have slows of up to 40%-50% on top of the 25% regression from pop goes. 36% compared to 40% doesn't make that much of a difference. 
---
I'm not a god-tier Freddy, but I was one of the first people to ever play this build back on PTB and I've played it to hell and back. It is still fine. Not fun to play against at all, but it didn't get hit that hard.
---
It’s just extra magnified in this game cause it’s 4v1
---
Because it was awfully boring for everyone involved. Also maybe the build was overperforming and warranted nerfing.
---
But the addons are still somewhat viable for slowdown.. and it was the mix of Thana and dying light and the addons that created Forever Freddy. I get that is your point but just slap on Chains and paintbrush and you got a slightly slower forever Freddy if you have a brain and pressure everyone as much as possible
---
Jeff
---
Ahhhhhh ok I thought that was the case. Thank you for clarification.
---
one of her gray addons does that, but it's a crutch
---
Well thats fine. Like i said im just trying to figure out what all the hates about.
---
What just happened here?
---
I wouldn't know, TBH.
---
When I play killer I main Mikey. My perspective on Nurse comes from being on the receiving end.
---
flick removed, so now he can only release his demon strike in a strait line without being able to change the direction once you release it. It makes his power useless in chases and extremely, unfairly easy counterable by simple 180 jukes. Waiting for my refund, because the Oni is ruined for me. I could understand if they made gaining his power harder or reduced its duration, etc, but this change ruined this killer for me.
---
Digital style!
---
I mean, if you kill for fun you have the best motivation of all
---
Damn that happens to me all the time.
---
None, he only lasted a week R.I.P
---
Grab his katana and.....cut the pizza with him :)
---
Yup by i like my music better
---
But his whole concept is slowdown.. that means his builds are slowdown-pressure orientated anyway.. so not much changes.. I understand what you mean but he has few choices anyway.
---
they usually are in reddit videos
---
That could be the tier changes. Like 20/25/30 or something
---
/r/stabbygang
---
The allegation stems from the accidental updating of his Addons. With this most recent patch dropping The Oni, the description of The Doctor’s power and his addons were noticeably different. The devs have stated they wanted to work on updating some older killers and Doc is about as old as it gets for needing a touch up. 
---
While BHVR never specifically came out and said “Doc changes incoming, get ready to get your nipples shocked off” the fact they updated his addons at all, much less that it accidentally found its way into the live patch can all but confirm we can see it coming soon.
---
Now that's a really big brain
---
If you claimed it, and nothing happened, then you have experienced a bug and need to contact BHVR's support.
---
Imagine no more 😉
---
Release freddy was awful to go against. It wasn't just people complaining for no reason.
---
You had to wake up the slugged person before you could pick them up, back then recovering way much slower (it too a whole minute to recover by yourself) and recovery capped at 85%. You'd legit sit slugged all game. It was a complete snooze fest.
---
Killers:Freddy, Myers, Billy
---
Survivors: Jake, Jeff, Bill
---
Huh,  I didn’t know he had other waiting lines. I’m a P3 Ash main and I’ve only ever heard “are we gonna be here.. *all* day?”
---
I was afraid the Legion outfits were gonna cost way more. I think I’ll be able to afford one!
---
Ah yes, map design
---
Stonetoss is a nazi
---
As I said in a previous post here, some asshats just had to come out an abuse the add-on in a stupid build.
---
As you point out, that build is unbalanced, but now casual Freddy players like me get robbed of their best add-ons
---
Billy is definitely the perfect killer...... when not using add ons. Once Billy gets his hands on some of the higher level add ons he becomes absolutely disgusting. Aside from that there’s nothing wrong with him. 
---
If Ghostface’s reveal mechanic wasnt buggy, then I’d argue he’s actually the most balanced killer. Ghostface doesn’t have any bad maps, whereas Billy really struggles on maps like Lery’s or Hawkins. Ghostface can use his power in a multitude of ways, constantly keeping survivor’s on their toes as well as having clear counter play for survivors to put effort into surviving against him. His power is easy to learn, yet takes time to fully master, similar to Billy. He’s got a lot going for him, it’s just that annoying reveal mechanic that needs to be working properly.
---
you're thinking of BS and STBFL
---
Dwight, Claudette, Kate and Nea

People are allowing up to yellow? What do you mean by that? And if u think base spirit is fine but what about billy? He needs like double green to be good, so is billy not viable because he needs greens? And does that mean nurse and spirit are the only viable killers to you or are there other killers whose base kits are viable to you?
---
Not since traps under hooks got fixed.... no never
---
Oh god i hate playing against Freddy:D Myers is super fun to play tho
---
I hope they release the killer for free while the Rift is active, but then lock them for people that didn't buy that killer once the Rift ends
---
Tru3 annoys me because he has the attitude of "Look at me, I know so much about this game. Did i mention that I know a lot about this game? I'm probably better than you because I know a lot about this game. My brain is too big."
---
He seems to have a big ego.
---
People base it off either no add ons, OR DbD tournament standard which limits to yellow add ons.
---
It does seem like some people choose to play Ghostface exclusively to camp though actual Ghostface's are usually pretty cool.
---
Don't you joke on my chonky jesus
---
I assumed it was a cool feature and always faced my character in a way where the direction I wanted to go aftering placing a trap is behind me.
---
Ace
---
You don’t have to fully charge the lunge...you can quick charge it. The power is far from useless. Like I commented below, it’s like learning to play nurse. Just takes practice.
---
Not Jane's. That's for sure.
---
Something Wicked is a little too strong. Needs a way for tokens to be taken away. Hex: Voodoo and the killer herself are both really cool designs though!
---
you are never able to succeed a stalk anyways
---
this comment was made by piggy gang
---
Yeah, but if you nerf his best slow down add-ons, which is supposed to be his purpose, why have add-ons for him altogether?
---
Blocks are useless, dresses are only well designed versus beginners, so I might as well no use any add-ons
---
I sometimes have a similar problem where it'll download the original update, and then keep increasing the "download", say its a 70mb download, then it goes to 1.3GB, then 4.3, etc. I noticed you have to have double what dbd is installed as (think its like 21 gb,so you need 42gb to install), works for me anyways. Hope I helped!
---
I mean if you make the weapon sound lame you could do this with anything.
---
How do you want to fix gentimes when the killrate for every killer is &gt;50?
---
4 hooks until death?
---
*still gets exposed anyway*
---
How do u download it?
---
OH SHIT THIS WAS A BUG?
---
WTF I DIDNT PLAY FOR A AWHILE I JUST THOUGHT THEY ADDED THIS
---
Killer: leather face for that sweet sweet bbq &amp; chili.
---
Survivor: David for that sweet sweet we’re gonna live forever.
---
Admittedly, I am in fact a sucker for blood-points.
---
To me, no not at all, lots of killers have potential, and personally idgaf about viability, I was trying to help you understand it, Nurse and Spirit are strong on PC, but I mean, ghostface is pretty strong too, heck even hag is quite good even under these yellow add on rules.
---
Gotta love matchmaking
---
I agree that the addon change was a straight nerf, but he has other good addons than just that (green charge speed cuts it in half basically, it's extremely good).
---
&gt; None of the perks are really mandatory.
---
Yes they are in the sense that if the killer want to tunnel instead of putting a global pressure, those 2 perks may help you to not die in 2 minutes.
---
And they still help you in most of your games anyway.
---
Unbreakabe is less consistent, more situational. But still, it does the job.
---
Dead hard is the superior exhaustion perk
---
Ash's
---
Ugh, reminds me of a David I had today on temple of purgation. We were up against a spirit with pgtw and David 3-gen'd us, then he proceeded to just run around in circles in the lower floor inside the temple with his key waiting for everyone to die. However a team-mate saw him on bond and got pissed and just bolted straight for him (I was downed) slammed in lockers to get the spirits attention and eventually took him to hell with him. A bit douchy but well deserved.
---
I don’t give hatch that much anymore cause I play Micheal meaning I have a harder time pipping so if one escapes that could be the difference between a pip and no pip so I’m not taking the risk
---
Pm me for help ;)
---
That's my favourite glitch. Nothing is more terrifying than a T-posing Bubba.
---
Any killer can get a 4K every once in a while of course but if you wanna be consistent and viable while affording yourself the ability to make a mistake or two like getting trapped at a loop and chasing for too long or whiffing a swing you have to use a stealth killer and that’s a problem. As a killer main I just want a non stealth killer they don’t nerf to death so I can still maintain my rank while also mixing it up. I can only use other killers when I just wanna have fun and maybe I’ll 4K, maybe I won’t. Oni is a perfect example of the destruction of non stealth killers. His demon strike initially had a whip like thing going for it so he could defeat infinite loops and that was crushed immediately upon release
---
jesus christ dude go meet some friends
---
I mean... His instagram is all about his muscles.
---
He's a good person. But likes to show off a bit. It's his personality. Just don't watch his stream or videos.
---
I wouldn't call Hawkings a good map. 99% of the loops can be walked around and ignored by the killer. This isn't a good direction to take loop design. 
---
It doesn't matter if there is 990432423 pallets if none of them matter as they are super unsafe.
---
Do what I do, tap a gen get it running then look for totems until you find another gen. Tap that gen as well repeat until someone else is being hit or chased by the killer.
---
Also works as him saying he looks like a woman
---
You first
---
t-posing bubba is truly terrifying
---
Pretty much
---
Dwight
---
Despite no mention of it - glad to see the charge addons for the medkits were sorted.
---
"new tier unlocked claim your rewards" my ASS
---
ok, so not to be the "um acthually" guy, but on one x (idk about ps4) I don't get any frame drops on nurse. Granted controller sens sucks, but thats not as bad as frames.
---
THIS IS SCARIER THAN WHEN THEY ARE NORMAL
---
this has to be KYF
---
Are they ever gonna fix dead hard?
---
Now that I think about it, do you think you could combo Tinkerer and Discordance to get there silently but quickly when you activate your power, or will that not work?
---
I think people really miss his point here. What he means by viable isn't "can win" what he means is "is capable of winning even if the survivors are really, really good". Most killers, even with their best addons, will almost never be able to win against a group of coordinated, good players. You might argue that's rare enough to not be relevant, but that's what he's talking about.
---
itS nOT camPiNg iTS gUaRDiNG tHe HOok.
---
They didn't buff console Oni, they just nerfed PC Oni to be the same
---
Well, nobody's stopping you from doing so. But seriously, you'll probably be dead real fast.
---
Ash. I love how the sweater has his boomstick on the back.
---
Trapper and Ghost Face share a similar problem - both of them can have their powers utterly destroyed by certain survivor perks. 
---
There are two main ways to play Ghost Face. The first is to use his power to tag people and one-shot them. The second is to constantly use his ability to cloak in order to get easy grabs, negate Borrrowed Time, and generally give survivors a hard time. One of his perks isn't too bad for map pressure, the second is a bit niche, and the last is *extremely* niche.
---
If you're using fast-setting add-ons to trap loops, then your Trapper is actually pretty close to Freddy. Freddy is easy to get to grips with, his power is strong on loops, and he can often hold his own against coordinated teams. His perks aren't great.
---
Leatherface is utterly reliant on the perk Play with Your Food - or in its absence he can use the instasaw add-on combo. He has a perk that helps you earn Bloodpoints, and that's really all he has going for him.
---
Personally I'd go with Freddy. If you're considering Ghost Face, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He-PltRCDTU) video where he *doesn't* stalk, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-S27H27Xy8) video where he does.
---
Blocks aren't had at all.. unicorn turns OoO into a Blessing! The most annoying survivor perk countered by one add-on, dresses are made to show you whether to fake a gen tele or not, there is so much possibility when playing Freddy, it's just overshadowed by slowdown, now they are more fun to play against and there is likely to be more options.. you ain't thinking with portals my guy.
---
I'm on console and I use to be able to land my hits but for me now it's harder because I have good movement but no flicks
---
Oh ok i didnt know that tourneys only allow to yellow. So i guess we’ll have to wait and see when he does his experiment with only yellow add ons.
---
I kind of wish they just made it so the addons didn’t stack with each other. I know that forever freddy was arguably the dumbest thing to go against but outdoor rope giving 2% slow down is borderline useless.
---
Agreed. A killer holding you in the game longer than it is needed to be is horrible. Kill me or let me go.
---
+ Farming is against the rules too Im pretty sure.
---
FINALLY OH MY GOD
---

---
Why would you hit them? You get more bloodpoints for picking them up out of a trap, and you didn't have save the best for last
---
Ace, David, Jake's, and Susie's.
---
Ghostface, pig, myers. They have a sneaking type of play style unlike billy. They stalk you and wait for the perfect moment to cut you down. Unlike other killers these stealth killers take time and precision to be lethal.
---
It’s weird because if I play killer, I usually rotate through the maps. As survivor, it’ll be 3 games in a row on the same map or realm.
---
Ok thats true
---
I think they need to just get rid of ruin and make gens take 120 seconds. Whats the worst that would happen?
---
Favorite Killer- Wraith, except, I can’t play him. Not in red ranks, at least, if I want to keep my pips. I go with Oni or Huntress for that. 
---
Favorite Survivor- Claudette, because I really like her snazzy cosmetics, like her suit jacket and her yellow skirt! I like looking cute :)
---
You gotta remember Tru3s playstyle also effects the outcome of his experiments, let's say he is in a sneaky mindset, he won't be able to capitalize on key chase moments on Gen Regression Freddy (There is a difference between Forever Freddy and Regression Freddy) and he might not be able to pressure a gen in time to kick a generator and stalling the game.
---
I love this so much
---
He really didn’t. The fact that they took away the whip on demon strike to give a good oni player the power to stop infinite loops is nuts
---
Imagine thinking everyone just has all kinds of expendable income.
---
Yea, but remember only a few killers benefit from Surge and Demo isn't one of them. I believe Nurse, Spirit, GF, Trapper, Legion, Doc and Clown are the only ones that can only down survivors with the m1 attack that procts Surge. It's bad on Demo because I get a lot of downs with the m2 which doesn't count towards Surge. I do think that should be changed as it's really dumb for Surge to not proct if I down survivors with Pig's lunge or Demo's Shred.
---
Making that 4 traps in one game tome look easy
---
If you’re on console I’d advise against it, his power is really sluggish and difficult to use even on max sensitivity. Pc is a different story however.
---
I hate it that he talks its always so annoying
---
If you hit them, it gives you points in Brutality, but if you pick them up, it gives you points in Deviusness.
---
Usually if the game goes well you'll get enough Deviousness points, even without picking survivors up from traps.
---
Holy fuck Ash is aware that this is a game
---
oh, ok
---
I've been waiting in a killer queue for 20-40 minutes a match. Its honestly ridiculous
---
“don’t care, still don’t care, don’t care, I don’t care”
---
Two player SWF to be precise
---
Scott’s channel has video of how much weaker the flick is.
---
Trust brother, ensure you have fun with the game as intended, forget about ranks of they stress you out, learn and then if you are bored after you have learned more try for higher and you'll enjoy the game more, sometimes it does take just meming to actually take a step back and enjoy DbD for the steaming pile of bug infested dog shit it is.
---
Imagine following an old dead guy 
---
This comment was made by the exposed gang
---
Legion then pig then trapper (QoL changes)
---
The current stealth killers are Wraith, Michael, Pig, and Ghostface. They all recieved recieved the undetectable effect on their powers (Tier 1 for Michael and Crouching for Pig) so that their auras can no longer be see
---
People are only saying that Ghostface and to a lesser extent Wraith are quite strong though. This is due to streamer Tru3talent and how he’s decided to play these killers: sneaking in, hitting various targets to apply Sloppy and Than, and then sweeping them up with Nurse’s Calling.
---
So more people playing killer increased the survivor queue times? That doesn’t make sense.
---
Iron Will
---
I feel you there. Fred is one of my fav killers and I would throw the rope add-ons on for a nice little slow in my normal builds.
---
I only play feng and I use lithe, technician, self care and ds or spine chill
---
Console is a different realm than PC is friend lol
---
Just so you know op, you are now creating 5 different timelines.
---
Also: becoming good at killer takes time, so keep banging your head against the wall and try to improve constantly.
---
You'll get there at some point
---
I’m pretty sure the killers are like supercharged by the entity also the entity wouldn’t allow it
---
Claudette’s ugly sweater came out last year, so I don’t know why you’re expecting to just straight up get it like Bill. If you want it for free then save up your shards. Oh, and stop being an asshole.
---
"Fixed an issue that could cause a crash when loading into a match."
---
How many times has this been fixed? They claimed error codes weren't going to be a thing anymore with the last patch, yet low and behold, they STILL FUCKING HAPPEN ALLLLLLLLLLLL THE TIME. 
---
Wait times to get into a match are ABSURD because of these fucking error-a-thons on console.
---
Her title is Vommy Mommy.
---
Another good one is that I did not know rushing actions alerted the killer until I played as spirit one time and I did not know that if you held the attack button you would lunge. In my defense I used a touch pad. I only found that one out until a survivor told me the same mach of the rush thing. Good times. &lt;3
---
I would still say Decisive is stronger. As long as you can hit your skill checks you get immunity from being hooked again for 60 seconds. Besides just that you get immunity from making stupid mistakes for that time span as well. It also synergizes with everything and you can fit into literally any build imaginable. Unbreakable is definitely A tier without a doubt though, especially in high tier games where the killers know the value of slugging compared to just hooking all the time.
---
but if you pay against a survivor team that play optimally (guess you're talking about swf in comms), then you'd need to play perfectly as a killer to be able to win or even just black pip.
---
he is countered by short loops. he cant turn that sharp unless attacking and in short loops, by the time the attack becomes a hitbox you're on the other side of terrain so his attack will wiff
---
well it is for when you are chasing someone and they deadhard past one of your traps, so you have to either pick it up, or if you are full of traps have to place one behind you first or just run through it and trap yourself
---
Don't forget no mither to counter chainsaws and exposed.
---
Yeah, when they’re not being shitheads and teabagging me when I’m the last survivor alive slugged or when they finally down me after 3 gens
---
Uncle Fred just stays in the corner and giggles quietly at the whole ordeal.
---
You didn't get the right timing with the pallet stun because the animation wasn't finished yet but my man that hit was wtf.
---
Are you just active or are you just on here to vent the frustration of DbD? I've seen you in like 7 posts in a row. Respect for keeping with the community but it seems like you are either on the fence or negative in your posts. You all good man?
---
Ghostface, pig, Michael and wraith are the stealth killers. Every other killer got super super nerfed so the unpredictability of a stealth killer is crucial. Freddy is only non stealth killer that’s viable imo but that’s only cause he has heavy debuffs
---
depended on your latency, if you are east or west coast near the servers, or just have great latency in general, it won't affect you.
---
I absolutely love Bubba's dying pig squeals whenever he chainsaws. I just can't help but laugh every time.
---
This is how I feel every time I take a break, just to load into my first match after a while getting either Haddonfield or that god damn swamp.
---
Use his shred when the survivor will get hit if they go to the area they want to
---
Oh i did get the pallet stun thats the thing i just cut the vid right after the hit because i had no reason to show that lmao
---
Not even mentioning Wraith, whose literal description is "A stealth killer" feelsbadman
---
All auras disappear if you are within visual range of the target, no obstructions.
---
That's why some rank 20 killers walk right past a hook, because they didn't see red.
---
And together they make. WATERED DOWN HILLBILLY
---
Happy cake day
---
I mean demo's add ons just make it so he does something a lil bit faster or gets his teleport up more often. No real specialisation options there either. Freddy's add ons also let him do things faster. 
---
If anything his add ons do more to actually change his power as he can switch between snares/pallets. The rest of his add ons are boosts too.
---
Ghostface, Michael Myers and The Pig.
---
Let's see.. counters Bond, Aftercare, Empathy, basically screw you helping your team.. almost like Freddy's goal is to isolate someone and make their life hard to pressure the other survivors and the make flashlight saves harder.. let's be fair, to say that his addons are useless is a bit much, EVERY killer has situational or 'useless' addons, Jesus they made nurse ultra rares memes! Killers have like 1 or 2 'meta' or commonly used builds/addons and no one complaining about all the other killers, it's placebo my friend..
---
It would turn into a Legion backstory situation
---
I love the idea. Survivors strongest perks are usually Exhaustion perks, and they don’t get completely nullified once used. They just go on a short cooldown. I think it’d be neat if the killers had a similar gameplay element.
---
We get a Herbert Daring Dashwood here yall
---
Oops lol
---
You say the same as the others but they get downvoted. The thing is, it’s not always the best play to go after the save.
---
The entity has had enough of y'all's shit and has decided to show off his true form, _A-POSING BUBBA_
---
My build right now is discordance, thana, enduring and spirit fury. The e+sf combo makes easy chase ends if you just bum rush the pallet and get your FF hit at the same time. I also take the FF duration addons and the Legion pin addons. Discordance allows me to find survivors bunched up and then these addons allow to hit all of them with the broken forcing the game to slow down with Thana. 
---
Honestly though just experiment with builds until you find one that you enjoy and can have fun with.
---
I like to play survivor with music. Sometimes I get caught out but it usually helps me loop better lol. Killer is impossible with music though unless you’re going against baby survivors.
---
It feels like more dc’s as soon as I hit purple.
---
Another artist.. god just go into artistry and stop making me.feel insecure by your godly drawings people that aren't me! A+ is what I'm saying my guy.
---
Thanks!!!!
---
Nice tbag
---
He only does the 1 2 3 slam if you actually land a hit, if you miss then you miss. Also, he can’t move while doing the 1 2 3 slam, so do with that info what you will.
---
People just like to always complain man. It's always something
---
Weird that his pantless myers cosmetic is from a different movie. Lead pipe and all.
---
Yeah I know that, I just don't wanna invest my BP into something and then have it come out a day later. It happens far too often
---
I hope the 4th guy didn't fall for that also?
---
"he's a little confused, but he got the spirit."
---
You get slugged so rarely that Unbreakable barely gets used. I’d rather use a perk that could either further help to prevent me or my team from getting downed in the first place or help progress the game than hope that I can use the perk after I do get downed.
---
BHVR wildly overestimates how good haemorrhage and blindness actually are.
---
They aren't completely useless, but do very little for you since you have no way to predict if you're even gonna need it
---
It doesn't look like her at all (read: not like a sleep-deprived bulldog), but I do like your art!
---
For the longest time I didn’t even know you could pick up untriggered traps because of this. Then I thought it was a pc only feature from watching Ohmwrecker and Otzdarva’s streams, but I’ve been able to do it sometimes on PS4.
---
Any good killer knows dying light is useless compared to its alternatives - its countered by baiting as the obsession, and switching the obsession as need be. Thana and PGTW are staples every killers takes for good reason when a gen is complete in 48 seconds. Thana is countered by healing - which with the recent healing others buff is extremely easy to do. Also gives survivors actually a reason to even heal. I never heal unless theres a reason to makes dead hard more readily and i'm good enough not to get hit for a long time. I like how you completely dodge talking about the add ons entirely and harp on perks any killer can use instead. Also yes the killer wants you doing anything instead of working on gens. Thats the killers job. Heres a hint to waking up, its faster to wake up from an unhook and someone waking you up than it is run across the map to your clock. Its also better to wake up these ways better than failing a gen skill check. 
---
Its not the killers fault if your team is bad and doesn't wake up, you don't blame the plague because someone cleanses early. Its also not the killers fault if your team doesn't heal you.
---
Freddys teleport has a long cast time and even gives you an alert long before he makes the teleport - can only tele to gens use that to your advantage over him. Don't just run head first towards another gen he is going to just tele to and get the jump on you. Not to mention be aware of your surroundings as there is a lot of indication for his teleport and the mind game is learning if he doesn't.
---
6% to 2% isn't slightly. Slightly is 6% to 4% or 5%. Don't call people a cunt. It's not nice and you're welcome for the how to counter freddy guide.
---
It wasn’t towards the killer it was more of a nod to the survivor I saved
---
They already admitted they just gutted him and are working on a compromise right now so I'm not sure what the point of this is.
---
Nice to hear i'm not the only one lol.
---
I haven’t been able to find out how to counter him once he gets in that mode besides some lucky 360’s but I don’t mind him being so powerful, honestly makes the game scary for the first time in years. When he is charging at me I have to remember that I’m an adult and screaming like a little girl is frowned upon
---
Btw this is literally just Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, everyone should have this as an option by standard.
---
Except now he's completely shit
---
Can someone tell me if it’s still exclusive or did they gave it to everyone
---
joey's looks so fuckin good
---
no mither too op pls nerf
---
They're pretty rad if you know what you're doing.
---
Oh thank god I thought they changed it on purpose!
---
Don't worry I did that also
---
i still think add ons need an overhaul. like not going away every game, so people don't use the argument of fair cuz rare. survivors get to keep their items if they escape why can't killers keep their add ons if they get a 3 or 4k?
---
The problem people have is that we only just now learned that being able to flick with him was unintentional. If they would have conveyed this from the start then people wouldn't nearly be as upset. However, I do agree with you on that people are overreacting about it. Oni is not dead, he can still have massive snowball potential and he has a built in 1 shot as part of his kit. While he won't be as strong as he was he will still be pretty decent.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e9emsf/thanos_neice/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Extremely boring the survivors have to wake up and try to counterplay a killer. It's fine though the more survivors cry the more you get your lopping simulator.
---
I like the Swamp tho...
---
It’s fun to imagine which arcana the characters would be 
---
Wraith would be Emperor
---
Nurse would be Empress
---
Plague would be High Priestess (duh)
---
Hag would be Magician
---
Dwight would be Fool
---
Feng would be Hermit
---
Pig would be Judgement? 
---
I think Trapper would be Tower based on what we learned in his Tome
---
Spirit would be Star or Moon probably
---
You can idk block them
---
I slug every game for a 4k and don't use deer stalker and it never been an issue for me.
---
Making that base could be way too strong. Imagine how annoying a Trapper Basement could be if he didn’t have to worry about stepping in traps.
---
Actually the fix I want most is for the trap aura not to disappear when stepping closer.
---
also making so there is actually a dramatic different in rarity drops for addons/offering from no prestige to p3 would fix this as well
---
"The flick is gone, it was never intended in the first place"
---
These exact words were written by a dev. I don't understand how anyone can think that they "gutted" a killer by fixing him to be how the devs originally intended him to be in the first place
---
Yeah, i know how you feel. She's terrible on console and incredibly dangerous on pc, just like poor oni.
---
I never said that it was guaranteed to beat sluggers.
---
Thanks man! I don't think I'd ever actually go into artistry though lol, games have stolen my heart. Thanks again for the compliment, though. It makes me happy knowing people like it :)
---
“You’re on the wrong side of history, toxic nea”
---
Technically you don't get your money back, just ingame currency :p
---
It’s kinda crazy how different Legion is compared to their release now. Like...watching their trailer is so freaking different and it makes me miss certain aspects of them only for nostalgia. 
---
I really wish we could get back multiple stabs. Just flying knife attack felt so satisfying and threatening back then. 
---
Happy Birthday, Legion.
---
It's not as rare as you think vs good killers.
---
Same build but I run nurse's instead of shadowborn, which I feel is better for stomping players who don't know nurse matchup but loses harder against better players since they'll abuse fatigue vision and will never be caught on nurse's. I bounce around between rank 2 and 1 but once I actually get good at nurse and swap in shadowborn I think I'll be a comfy 1.
---
Which add-ons combos do you recommend? I actually pretty much only run no add-ons because I'm used to it but I dunno how any of the new add-ons interact besides double charge recovery.
---
There is custom text for these and I wish I had thought of that.
---
I’ve been following Otz for awhile and it’s kind of crazy watching him then someone else with how in depth Otz gets. I watched one of truetalents on Ghostface and he’s incredibly good at DBD but the difference in commentary was very noticeable.
---
I think your talking about the tome the archive is 1-70 the tome is 1-4 (4th isn't out yet)
---
Thanks! Honestly, I think this outfit would make me want to play Doctor way more than his rework would
---
Peanits set it in a post on the Forum.
---
EZ raise.
---
What is it
---
Oh.. Well that just shows my 3-5 hrs a week lol. Thanks for the info
---
No problem! I’m super excited to see how it turns out if you draw it!
---
Honestly, I think a method would be a ranked/competitive mode. I don't think it would split the community too much, if this was applied:
---
Ranked/competitive only allows perks. No items, no offerings, no addons. Prevents moris and it would've prevented instaheals/insane flashlights/haddonfield every game for people who want to play competitively.
---
Empathy and Pop...I still use both of them all the time. I don’t think I’ve used the other two since their chapters were released.
---
You legit can barely turn mid-blink.
---
This makes her DUMMY easy to juke and gives her so little time to aim chain blinks.
---
Start the video at 34 seconds and watch him turn sharp at a short loop.....
---
Using all of them is maximum big brain power
---
Jeff and Legion.
---
This was an issue? 🤔
---
But oni is easier to use, so therefore in the lower ranks of play he will be much more effective. Making him harder to beat, yes in red ranks and potentially high purple billy will we leagues better than the oni due to flicking. That’s my opinion/take on it anyway
---
I’ll definitely tag you when I post it! You’re a genius.

He's referring to this comment though: "While we think these changes are introduced to improve the game, we did hear a lot of feedback on the turn speed and controls changes. We feel there is something to improve there.

So they're already planning on retweaking how he works.

You shitting me? Ay dios mio these devs.

Imagine if they made dbd vr and people literally had to repair the gens with their hands
---
IDK...I played her a lot at rank 1 last year. It took weeks of practice and a lot of teabags but she’s still good on console if you put in the time.
---
I literally haven’t gotten this map in the past two months I just want it once it’s always goddamn haddonfield. And the literally isn’t exaggeration like zero times.
---
I'm half way through 49 and I still have one challenge in tomb 2 and a almost all survivor ones in tomb 3
---
I understand the game pass ultimate. What is being offered to other countries and not to canada is the option to buy into a new xbox x or s for under 400 along with the game pass and get xbox project scarlett as an upgrade. Versus the 450-500 price tag when launched.
---
he wasn't being looped yet. he was coming up to the loop and slightly turned left before getting there so he could make that first turn. like yeah if he isnt fully looping yet, then yeah they don't counter it, but if hes actively looping at a short loop, you can't use his charge
---
I don't always say gg ez...
---
But when I do, it's after the killer 4k's and 5 gens us.
---
No addon nurse is pretty fine to get used to her. Remove nurses because you NEED shadowborn against very good surv (to beat meh survivors you don't need nurses, you can do it anyway, while shadowborn helps alot with tracking which is the only nurses weakness. Also good survs will never heal in ur tr). Use badman keepsake if you want a 60 seconds nurses calling. It is actually decent because I can see survivors I slugged seconds earlier so I can interrupt the heal and either chase the healer or pick up the dying survivor. 
---
As for the addons: the best combo imo is kavanagh's last breath and fragile wheeze( tremendously increases blink range and the other considerably increase blink recharge time). An other interesting combo is maximum blink range( ad you noticed range addons are still the best)+ that addon that makes you blink automatically after a fully charged blink. That is pretty nutty.

---
My experience with playing Oni has been the opposite mid to high ranks are pretty good against him while noobs just get stomped. But yea him being easier to use will make him great against low ranks kinda like all the killers we've been getting tbh
---
The Quentin department's busy working on his face.
---
It’s crazy how the killer can be obsessed with one survivor long enough to chase him around the map the entire game and ignoring other survivors
---
The devs don’t know what they want to do with this killer or at least aren’t in agreement about it
---
Honestly. there's literally no reason to make his traps spawn at random places unless he has the iridescent stone. either make that base kit or give him all the traps. 
---
I actually think giving him iridescent stone would be fine, he'd be high tier but not OP. the game is like 4 years old BHVR. time to get with the times here.
---
Nurse is the weakest killer on console and it's two consoles vs pc so if they bundle up everyone together then nurse is going to be dragged down by console players.
---
it’s due to the tome
---
Yes please.
---
Im talking about infinite sprintburst/balanced landing dont play stupid
---
Ah ok thank you! I'll try it out. I guess I just have to experiment with them all to fit my play style. I have a question though, why do you use spine chill?
---
I wish you could play as legion without the mask.
---
I mean if there's like 4 gens left and this situation happens, you're better off cutting your losses.
---
"we did here a lot of feedback on the turn speed and controls changes"
---
Which basically translates to "people won't stop bitching about it so we're changing it to make you happy." He's honestly fine right now without the ability to flick at crazy angles. Billy has been considered one of the top 3 killers for years now and he's never had the ability to go around corners mid dash like Oni could. I just don't understand why people feel the need to complain about something that isn't even bad
---
I'm sure at Rank 1 SWF groups playing to win are the worst to play against, but I've found that at purple/low red ranks they are suicidally overconfident.
---
There's no fucking way I'm going to pick up your friend when I know there's a 100% chance you're around the corner with a flashlight, Jake. I'm just going to pause for a second then get free hits when you rush out. And like fuck I'm just gonna beeline it away from the hook when I can smell your morning breath from behind that tree, Nea. It's laughable sometimes.
---
In patch notes they don't put a lot of know problems I guess your new as reading all the patch notes is long but reading them as they come out takes 3 min top and let's you know what is change and what bugs have been removed
---
I'm taking in account her claw hand. It's probably pretty sharp. You'd have to like chop it off with the hatchet.
---
The "fix" to his turn is worse than what it seems. Sure he still has a hit-down ability but it takes quite some time to charge (getting into blood fury, specially at the beginning of the game) and it doesn't even last a good amount of time, while Billy can do it whenever. Sure the mobilty of the oni during the dash is better than Billy's sprint. But just give the survivor literally any loop and you won't be able to use the hit-down ability on them, you will have to normally m1 them, making the ability pretty useless, since it lasts really not that much. In my opinion, being able to hit 90 degrees just after the dash was one of the main reasons that made him viable.
---
u/biggestboy08
---
Just leave, if you want to give free points, then go to the middle of the map instead of tbagging at the exit gate
---
You really went to the upside down!
---
&gt; The first survivor went down pretty fast, due to the camping bubba
---
This doesn't make sense
---
I played Leatherface on Haddonfield and won even though my mic died. I even managed to find the hatch.
---
Tbh oni is quite safe in regards to effectiveness with kills, the one I’m worried about is legion, they’re still pretty viable in rank 9-20 but anything above that and they’re insanely hard to use effectively. Pretty much just an M1 killer for the games in 9-1. Making them pretty ineffective and easy to loop and beat. I’m not going to say they need a buff I just think the devs need to take a step back and look at what they’ve done.
---
It’s giving the killer a free kill, rather than DCing and shorting BBQ and sacrificial points, and it sets the survivors at a disadvantage.
---
Cancer is you
---
Nice FNAF posters bro
---
Have fun, and good luck!
---
Demogorgon does. his portals are useless unless you move all over to put two at a good distance from each other. 
---
They could do wonders for him just by letting him instantly teleport to any portal without having to place a new one, as long as he's got one left. it's not enough, but it'd be a start.
---
Further proof that survivors are the real killers
---
Drake, where's the exit gate?
---
It's right there
---
I told you to 99% it so we can escape after unhooking everyone 
---
Dude I'm gonna

*heartbeat noises*
---
Oh I see the problem here
---
OH DO YA
---
I always thought that was a feature, not a bug.
---
Because people bought him and learned how to play with him and also bought him based on the way he was able to perform and then they go and remove that, it's basically false advertising. People feel like they spent the money on him because of how he was coming out of the ptb and now they want to change him and remove what made him fun to use for them.
---
that's back again? ffs
---
And then Huntress wanted a divorce
---
Can't you still flick up to 50 degrees?
---
literally all they had to do was prevent Hex from spawning on certain points like gens and shack and have the spawn a minimum distance from any survivor.
---
I second this, Oni and Nurse are incredibly harder to play on console than compared to pc.
---
I want more lore about the others instead of just frank 
---
That would be a nice archive
---
How do the killers communicate with him. Like all killers have some type of sentience. Do they treat him like a dog and pet him when he does good or something
---
OH my God why didn't I think of that earlier. I've been having problems going against stealth killers lately. I had used SC before I knew stealth killers were a thing so I found it kinda useless and forgot about it. Thank you again, I appreciate it.
---
Thank you, I hoping I can bump it out playing a bunch of survivor games since killer games take forever.
---
Thank fuck for  that
---
That’s what I’m talking about. There is no incentive to buy their pass until you’re done. It doesn’t help early on for the people with lives. 
---
I’m off most the time no lifing this game, and I’m still further out than I should be. People with 9-5 jobs can’t finish the rift.
---
So that's what happened in that game where I never saw the killer and heard his trap going off over and over the whole time. I thought he was just trolling

This is the most beautiful thing i have ever seen &lt;3

That's actually Jane. The Entity just hasn't taken her yet

---
&gt;"What the hell is this picking system BHVR?"  
---
Random. It's pure RNG. Unless the devs have to personally step in due to some kind of bug, but even then I'm fairly certain they just re-roll the Shrine.
---
That’s because I call out their bs. I’m not here to join the hive mind meta or make memes. Nobody really talks about strat, and if you do, you get the hammer for free thinking.
---
Ngl what you’re thinking is probably a head canon thing. They eat you’re saying is it assuming that all the killers just hang out with each other in between trials, which would be pretty cool. I think what actually goes down is that the Entity separates the killers so they down try to kill each other, and tortures them so they’ll stay obedient to it. Or I am literally about to be whoooshed over the ocean

Such loading screen, much wow, bet it was haunted grounds.

The Bubba buff we need

Oni was already hyper limited by the power going away and still being dumb easy to loop around anything that wasn’t a straight line. Billy has the advantage cuz he doesn’t need to slowly suck up blood to activate his power and Insta-Saw exists for billy
---
I’m a bb killer but if there’s just two people left and I just put someone on first hook, why would I look for the hatch? I’d much rather patrol gens instead, since they’re more of a “threat” for me.
---
Again, I’m very new to this game but I would personally play like this. If the third survivor was at second hook or dead on hook then it’d be a different story.
---
Thank you for this. You have inspired me to learn Sally’s ways.
---
Happy birthday Frow-ouch-*ahhhhohgod*
---
I balanced it, what he said was fair.
---
They'll never fix totem spawns, if anything they actually cant, they just have to change how hex perks work. 
---
No matter what eventually survivors will learn about common spawn locations because its a game, its programmed to do something the same way every time no matter the variations, in this case procedural maps
---
&gt;There’s a rank 16 and rank 8 in a rank 4 killer lobby
---
Rank 8 is normal matchmaking and rank 16 is probably SWF or simply because he is 16 which isn't affected by matchmaking.

In my experience the purple ranks are way more toxic and entitled than the red ranks. We're all friends up here :)

The patch notes aren’t showing on their website on mobile??

Oh, they finally killed Oni. Took them awhile though, we got much more fun than it was intended I guess.

Most on here know about BHVRs BS but it is nice to take a time out and just laugh at memes.

Every now and then I get a match where I have smooth framerate and it feels *amazing*. But that only makes it more frustrating the next match when I get Red Forest with thick mist offerings and my xbox immolates.
---
&gt; since everyone tried explaining to him his Spirit 'counter' isn't a counter 
---
He doesn't call it a counter. He specifically talks about how you can't "counter" killers, since it's not a 1v1. He just explains that it's not "random" and that there are decisions you can make to extend chases.
---
the number of times i’ve been farmed against my will because i don’t want to be/didn’t want to be involved is ridiculous, just kill me already i don’t want to play this match
---
How is life as Rin Yamaoka
---
I don't have any problems when tabbing out, what problems are you running into?
---
Spirit can be viable yes. Nurse not so much on console cause of the frame cap. It really hurts those reads as there’s no guarantee the survivor will still be there
---
Janes! I love the coloring, very cute.
---
I'm a simple killer, I see toxic neon colored survivor, I face camp them.   I dont care if I derank from the other 3 escaping, the neon hair dies.
---
And they also made it darker. I hope it's a bug

Honestly I kinda like Hawkins, it looks cool

I actually like that map

Could it partly matchmaker with a life time hidden rank of some sort when it can not find a match in the current rank?

Who needs to sit and think when you actually killed them in game
---
People shouldn't be downvoted unless what they are saying is universally wrong. Thanks.
---
Thank you! I can’t speak for everyone but I appreciate it☺️
---
I think you’re right about the separating thing but not the torture. All killers made a deal with the entity. They obey him and he allows them to kill to their hearts content. The cannon I like though is that the killers have something equivalent to the survivors campfire where they hang out between matches, it’s a fun thought
---
These people just don't listen to his actual point. 
---
He isn't talking about "viable" as in "can kill survivors". He means "can kill a group of *excellent*, coordinated survivors. There are only a few killers that are capable of going toe to toe with a group like that, even with their best addons.

If you somehow find yourself out of bounds all you gotta do is fall off the edge and the game will reset your position, or escape but you might depip &amp; or screw your teammates over

Jeff is so loud when he's injured. Kinda makes Iron Will necessary.
---
Same Joey, same
---
I don't get why someone lists all the strengths of a killer, none of the weaknesses, and acts like they've contributed to the conversation.
---
Oni *really* struggles at high level of play. If survivors just play safe, drop pallets early, and hide when he gets his power, he just turns into a low teir m1 killer.
---
On the flip side, against *not* top tier survivors he's incredibly strong with his mobility and insta down. He really punishes being out of position or making mistakes on loops (e.g. most survivors)
---
Balance is a lot more nuanced than people seem to think.
---
Now I want a power plug Ghostface head piece lol.
---
I have no problem doing gens against Ruin when I'm survivor. 
---
There's three types of games against Ruin that I get and what I call them isn't called that by everyone:
---
1: Cleanse the hex we win Kappa. In this type of game, 2 or more survivors are probably looking for the hex to cum on it's sexy fire. This causes one or no gens to get done. It is the survivors fault if this happens.
---
2: Decent Survivors. In this type of game, only 1 (if any) is trying to find the hex. This causes gens to get popped with Ruin up and shows that Ruin is balanced because unlike with Forever ___ builds, gens with ruin that take Forever to finish.
---
3. My Hex is Ruined. In this type of game, the survivor spawns next to or close to the Ruin totem. "That was easy"
---
&gt; Nice thats pretty funny. I doubt that will happen again...
---
&gt;Wait.
---
I've seen a buddy of mine run Make your Choice and do decently well with it by gen-porting. But that's a niche strat
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't intentionally fixed. Probably fixing some other bug spaghetti'd it's way to the charge code and just unintentionally fixed it
---
Baiting out hits during Breakout with No Mither/Dead Hard sounds like it is gonna be wild. OP you're gonna be quick on your feet if you go this route!
---
Well to be honest, the concept behind Ruin is to slow down the game juuust a 'lil bit.
---
I run BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel, and usually Enduring or Thanatophobia in the 4 slot. Mostly Enduring though because at the end of the day Fredward is still an M1 killer and Enduring is T-I-T-S on M1 killers.
---
the devs can hardly think of good ideas for 6 perks a chapter, no way they are gonna think of decent ones for events.
---
See usually they’re fun to go against but the last 3 I’ve had have been either camping or straight up face camping.
---
*optional 5th panel* I BRING FRANKLIN'S AS WELL&gt;:D
---
counterplay and counter are not the same thing. 
---
&gt; but as Scott explains if the spirit decides to path the same way you do, not only do you waste a pallet, but you get hit,  
---
Sure? I agree with the collision change. But realistically that doesn't happen that often anyways if you do what tru3 recommends. Collisions happen against walls and at chokes, not usually during random walking in an open area.
---
&gt;but what does that do if your team can't sustain the same pressure in a chase? 
---
I'm confused by this. It's 4v1, if your teammates don't do well you *should* lose.
---
I think ds is better
---
You don’t have to like it but that’s a solid strategy.
---
Just realised this was probably posted in the wrong category. But whatever.
---
come to argentina and you'll get one!
---
third times the charm amirite
---
The logic that’s is being insinuated here (and yes BHVR very well may have wanted this because they have always endorsed immersed gameplay vs bold and altruistic when it comes to survivors) is that survivors are only meant to hide and die. 
---
That simply was a poor idea. To think that NO ONE would find a way to fight back, or try to use any means of escape/staying alive possible is asinine. People found different styles of playing, something that happens on pretty much ALL games. They found different layers to the game. And frankly, to majority of people,playing completely immersed all the time is extremely boring. People like the chase because it exciting, and even losing in the end on both sides can still end on a positive note. 
---
That is why I like about DBD. You have different styles of play, different ways you can go about things. It wasn’t a survivors fault that in year one, and kickstart stages the developers didn’t have common sense to realize their map layouts needs to be changed. It’s better now, but now it sometimes does the opposite extreme. Sorry ply games where half the map is a total dead zone, not even T walls or small sight blinders, no vault no pallets. Also not the point but still.
---
The game has always had serious RNG problems.

Maybe I just play against dumb killers, but I like to do gens right next to the basement and as soon as spine chill glows and i start hearing the terror radius, I just hop down there. They usually never check the basement lol

No, if you're not using the add on you don't have to worry about losing your orbs anyway. He's saying that Plague with her aura reading add on is not C tier, and neither is Oni.

Nice one! Never gotten further than 4 myself, this is great!

Nah, we NEED to discuss this.

Having an easier time than me I’d assume. Just hide in those bamboo thickets and you’re essentially invisible if you don’t move.
