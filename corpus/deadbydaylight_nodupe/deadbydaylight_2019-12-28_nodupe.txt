Funny thing is all OP had to do is literally just press X twice and theyd be back in the game - no need to make the post

I expected the Skyrim, title spoiled the spicy meme

Ever heard about perk named bamboozled
---
Yeah but he has no choice
---
Honestly, someone ip ban this guy. We don‚Äôt want you sorry

totally but i guess s/he thought s/he got banned or something hahaha

In tome two, the challenge for "sacrifice 10 people" counted if you played as survivor.

oh hey, I was the kate. that nurse seemed confused asf lol

Not going to lie I asked my team to 99% gens they find so that I can run an just one tap them.

Host has to add everyone in order for the match to work.  Yup its stupid.

Hey ass butt

Beautiful.

&gt;6 ranks apart seems like a bit much

Would you rather not play the game at all because of queue times?

&gt;Horvath - There are some instances where a lobby will no longer... I'm gonna try to be vague about this, I'm sorry. There are some situations where a lobby will get the incorrect rank for the killer. We are looking into this. But that ends up having a result on the killer you're gonna have. So the killer might be rank 20 playing against rank 1s and there is a bug in our system that just didn't match up correctly. We are looking into this. We are not gonna have it fixed before Christmas. Some time next year... Whenever. We are going to be able to get that done and it should be better. That's an issue with our system at the moment and not an actual desired design.
---
&gt;Horvath - High-ranked killers can also be matched against low-ranked survivors because of how the SWF matchmaking system currently works, which is also something that the design team are looking into and may or may not get changed.
---
Yo stabby gang
---
What's up my dude
---
What's the item that allows him to kill them immediately?
---
Ruin and corrupt for me has worked very well, so I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot great‚Äù. I will say though that it depends greatly on the killer your playing though, and also that Pop works very well. 
---
From my experience, I have a tendency to catch survivors at the start of matches either close to my totem or already on it; essentially a free down. However, survivors watching your movements to see if they find your totem could potentially be an issue.
---
Then there should be the opposite offering to this one to add more lockers to the trial. Sounds fun tbh.
---
When in yellow ranks, you get reset to 17, when you‚Äòre at 17, you get deranked to 20
---
Ah yes, another soldier from ninjas 7 year old army
---
it sounds to me like you dying had nothing to really do with the other player, so i dont really get this post
---
A little tip, though: you get more emblem points for many chases as opposed to killing the survivors as fast as possible. There will be more chance for you to double pip when you slug the unhooked and then chase the unhooker.
---
Ok but here is the thing.
---
Missions like 'escape as Claudette' or 'escape with Spine Chill with out getting hooked' are stupid simple compared to 'Kill all 4 survivors in the basment'
---
Those teabaggers got what they fucking deserved.
---
that sounds cool, how do you know?
---
Wait. I have a question....I‚Äôm sorry what?
---
Thank man

Ill take 3 for each of my games
---
You what M8?
---
The only reason I play survivor right now is because ranks are broken and I am tired of getting Rank 1 survivors as a mid rank killer.
---
And I have a friend who I am getting into the game, and there isnt a 2 killer option...
---
Background story, my swf got moried and I used the chance to make the killer smile a bit, he send me the screenshot afterwards.
---
I did my research, you're lying. Take your sarcastic good day response and shove it up your ass, racist.
---
Happy Cake day
---
My team has tried 99ing but we keep getting super sweaty killers.
---
It was a long game. Fully pipped all iridescent. Plus some add-ons and BBq+chili.
---
idk who tydetyme is but im sure he isnt the decider of which perks are best. if adrenaline isnt top 5 idk what is lol.

Yahtzee!

yes indeed. thank you for contributing to scientific advancement!

Stab gang forever
---
Same here. I'll be glued to my screen when/if that happens. Maybe we can get some 200k BP's
---
It wasn't a waste though...

He didnt get hit, so it wasn't wasted.
---
I swear it's always a Michael too.

looks good

---
Who is tydetyme?
---
There is a small bonus, I think there's like 10 points towards sacrifice emblem for "All Survivors Hooked"
---
There is a superior PC version that's usually on sale for $5
---
The first one is far too long. It should throw the killer off for a few seconds, not deter them for an entire minute. 
---
 
---
 Survivor bloodtrails/scratch Mark's don't even last that long, why should a killers? Once again, too long. 
---
 So it's a permanent overcharge, but you get to progress the gen a tiny bit if you hit it? That's pretty bad honestly.
---
They *are* playing Nea.
---
I watched one of his vids when he played against pig. "I am juking her"
---
*waste KS pallet 5 meters away from her*
---
One guy DC'd, but that was after the power stopped working.
---
Then you are honestly just being a dick. You're just here looking for people to pay you on the back so you don't feel bad about making a dick move on purpose. If you weren't even gone from the hook, and someone saved, and you go for the person just unhooked rather than the dumbass who saved, that indeed makes you a tunneler, and a dickhead at the same time.
---
Thoinks
---
Exactly my thoughts
---
They admitted there was a bug with matchmaking that they‚Äôre working on. This isn‚Äôt intentional.
---
I get your point, but at the same time if they had waited 15 to 20 seconds they would‚Äôve been good. I‚Äôll try and not always go for the unhooked person if it means getting another hook, but I won‚Äôt always just let a person go, especially if the unhooker just dips
---
It's not though. I made it on a meme generator earlier today...
---
So BP addons?
---
And
---
Do this √•s leatherface to confuse them

I'll just copy and paste a comment I made earlier here, not sure how much you know about the game.

Not everyone who disagrees with you is a fan of his. Quit your pretentious bullshit.
---
How hard is it. Like seriously just throw down pallets and force them to break it.
---
Skill check Doc is using Doc to make skill check as hard as possible (By using Huntress' Lullaby, Overcharge and Unnerving Presence) and make TR bigger (Calm addon and Distressing) to benefit Unnerving Presence and tier-up survivor's madness faster (Skillcheck will appear random place on the screen). It doesn't work too well on high-rank survivor.
---
Forever Freddy is using Freddy, his add-on and some Perk(Micheal's Dying Light, Nurse's Thanatophobia) to make gen speed as slow as possible. It's not as strong as before (due to being nerfed) but it's still worth running.
---
For survivor, I like playing Meg because she's just the one I started out with, but looking to use Yui because reasons üëÄ  
---
Killer is Legion because zoom zoom stab stab. And I like that they are fairly "normal" for a killer.
---
I too read it as "you have been suspended FROM Dead by Daylight" at first glance.
---
My point exactly, Dog. It's a toxic and unfun behaviour that is genuinely only hurting the community. No real argument can be made that it at all helps people have more fun or helps the community grow.
---
Seems like Ninja already made kids play DBD
---
His point is a whataboutism. Noob3's, or anyone else's, actions don't justify Ninja's.
---
Can we lowkey have a "he's a phantom" style skin?
---
i had a killer get 31900 the other day and it physically hurt me to see it
---
Nice
---
Maybe wanted a survivor Map so the game would go much faster just so he could pull a end game clutch with NOED and BW
---
Look at BBQ counter before asking these questions
---
What that thing then when he stabs the person in the back a ton then takes a selfie?
---
which white mask? Ghostface tiny guy that leans around or Myers that just stands still and looks at u.
---
if ur talking about getting killed right away not even hooked that is Myers who with 2 different addons Tombstone piece and the tombstone can mori survivors instantly when he is in tier 3 it is stupid and only counter is to get in a locker if u know he has tombstone or do gens fast
---
There absolutely are and no, it is absolutely not fine. It's actively hurting the community and despite how badly I want to see BHVR go out of business? I'd rather it not be a death by a thousand cuts because the community slowly killed itself creating awful habits which I've noticed are becoming more prevalent as of late.
---
I put too much effort into [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/egclji/i_ranked_the_killers_based_on_how_fun_they_are_to/).
---
B r u h
---
You could always play until tier 2 and then go AFK. I've gone AFK halfway through a bad match with other killers and had all the survivors come up and run all around me trying to get me to move or something.
---
Beautiful üëÄüëÄüëÄ
---
Also don‚Äôt let him get in your lines of sight. If he looks at you for more than what, 3/5 secs? You might as well just do your best to run or let him finish you off.
---
That has never existed lol
---
his mori?
---
It's Adrenaline + Injured speed boost and, I think, Lithe
---
What you‚Äôre describing is an offering called a Mori. It allows you to kill a survivor by your own hand after they‚Äôve been hooked once.
---
Well I'm safe to say that i haven't been banned from DBD
---
Had this myself
---
You have to get blinded again
---
This is true.  My point is, nothing Ninja has done stands out to justify this backlash in the first place.
---
Cultural exhange: *brings no mither*

Congrats! I reached rank 8 for the first time myself last season! Unfortunately haven't had much time to play since the reset :(.

[Voila](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/egjgs2/as_per_the_request_of_uguardianofthecrystal_i/)
---
u loop him at loops that he will have a hard time throwing optimal bottles and watch him suffer being a M1 killer
---
Oh thank you I was curious on how I did that it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve played
---
Probably because he stopped playing ? I stopped playing and my friends as well, thought the game was sort of dead, but nope, it's still going strong.
---
You just focus on things other than escapes. ‚ÄúHey two teammates DC‚Äôd and the killer tunneled the hell out of me but I got some really nice loops/plays in‚Äù can keep you going. Plus queue times are better so it‚Äôs not as hard to shake off a shitty game.
---
Yes, there are absolutely times where tunneling is actually the best possible approach to a situation in-game. I myself just yesterday was put up against a 4 man SWF who I struggled tremendously against, my strategy was to tunnel two down and cut their strength in half whilst still attempting to apply pressure to the other 2 to ensure gens didn't fly. It saved me the game and got me a 4k where I otherwise would likely have been lucky to get 2.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Tunneling at times is exactly what is needed, my entire point with this post, as I tried to point out, is that it should not be the go-to strategy that new players are encouraged to resort to the second they don't have survivors throw themselves into their arms. New killers/weaker killer players should be taught how to improve rather than coddled and told their pity kills are good because eventually they're bound to hit a wall where people steamroll them as a result of the utter lack of pressure on anyone but 1 person. That wall very well may just result in them leaving the game entirely, which is unfortunate.
---
I'd like /everyone/ to be happy. Not a select few.
---
From what lol? Her power doesn't directly help her in chases, her mobility is already standard, she is already tall so mind-games is already difficult enough to do. As is plague could do with a healthy buff that lets her better use her power. Whether that's by denying survivors the opportunity to cleanse at all or giving them heavy incentives to do so , so she can use her actual power corrupt purge  more when she wants to rather than that always being up to the survivors.
---
No problem! Each killer has their own cut scene for their mori, and there are a few different rarities of mori.
---
i finally found a friendly killer that farmed with me for a bit because two people disconnted in the first minute, finally got 4 pallet stuns and i was so happy, skip to the end of game and for some reason the challange still did not complete..
---
To be fair, I doubt that he can really give out non public information about the game during his free time playing the game on stream. Agree on the second one though.
---
Can you give an example
---
Fair enough. But ill be waiting on console for the golden day of finding him by chance.
---
Defaults as no mither.
---
That huntress needs a hug
---
I'm saying the killer only had 2 BBQ stacks, meaning 2 people weren't even hooked yet.
---
We can complain all we want about survivors but at some point the blame can be put on the killer just having a bad game.
---
4 tracking perks on a killer with built-in tracking already is already a bad sign.
---
30 even 45 seconds is not enough for 3 gens to get done.
---
Nope, PC. Don't get me wrong, I definitely face *good* Nurses (the ones who don't feel the need to run Ruin and still get a 4k) but they still miss blinks and are jukeable.
---
My 14 tombstone, tuff combo on Myers with 13 black wards and 12 ebony moris I think it's time to unleash hell upon this world
---
dont go near trees or high structures he rly is a meh killer bc his power barely does anything
---
Meg because she was free and had Sprint burst, which was good enough for me to get through the rift challenges and play enough with some friends occasionally without being a sandbag. She's still level 15, but I'm in purple ranks thanks to her. 
---
Killers is Hag and Spirit, because I like mindgames and feeling like I earned the kill. Only started playing spirit after the Beads nerf, because then she actually felt like a challenge to play vs people who know what they're doing. Add in the fact that I have hearing problems, and it means I have to work to find them when I'm phasing. Hag is just fun, especially with mint rag + make your choice.
---
Which perks are you using? I am new to the game
---
Well that was an exaggeration but i spawned in looked around for 3-4 minutes I got into a chase them boom 3 gens just popped like nothing
---
I still think shes better off a survivor.... i just wish this game gets a map called the Moment of Sunrise and the killers and survivors could escape its grasps.
---
Okay thanks
---
I like the idea of laying down something static and it doing something!
---
Calls the killer a stream sniper 
---
Killer running bbq lol
---
Hoping for any game mechanics other than repeat killers at this point is a longshot seeing as the devs are sorta looking like they're giving up on anything actually original.
---
So... yes, I will blame the community for not bettering the situation which they absolutely can better when the devs refuse to do so. My entire post here is trying to point out how we can better the in-game community and not constantly maintain the very noticeable air of hatred between killers and survivors. One side gets mad at the other, calls names, ruins games, rinse and repeat. Forever. Ruining what could be a nice community.
---
He's gonna become worse than OchiDO

IM LOSING MY FUCKIGN SHIT KSWEMSLDK
---
Ruin and pop is bad enough
---
Jason needs no chainsaw. BRUTE STRENGHT
---
well that sounds like ur own fault if it took u 4 min to find a chase
---
Yuuup. Gen-rushers are merciless.
---
tombstone, is it an addon (assuming you mean so since you said, but just asking for clarification) and not an actual perk? And if so...I've been like "save them for a rainy day" kind of person as far as addons go, as they only seem to last for a match, which seems like SUCH a waste since I'm so bad anyways :P Is it only when you are going to "try hard" or making videos like these (montage esc)?
---
Also, I've had 2 killers against me using something called "Hex:Ruin" and it was a epic perk. And how in the WORLD am I supposed to counter is as a survivor, or is there just no counter play to it other than having the reaction times of a cheetah? :P The two times I met someone using it, we just instantly wiped and only got 1 generator destroyed. The killer just walked around killing us over and over the whole game :P
---
I learned this from my 2 friends with about 100 hours in the game both. Apperantly I've just gotten so used to the different chainsaws that I can easily tell them appart but they cant.
---
The point is its an insult. Stop reading too much into it. You are draining all the fun out.
---
Look at the cute lil' Suzie
---
That new ultimate slow down meta Freddy is really getting to me. Ghost face not so much. I can respect a good ghost face. But people with something like ruin, thana., and all the slowest possible addons really make it pretty difficult at times.
---
The calm best add-ons overcharge, huntress lullaby, distressing, unnerving presence and for a offering use the game map as it's the second smallest map and the smallest is the new yamaoke map so you can use that and hope for a 50/50 on a good map
---
Someone posted an amazing strat for it and I got it 2nd try. Woulda done it first time but I committed to the final gen and got grabbed a second before it popped. Went it next game with the same build and done.
---
wtf sorry you got downvoted for that
---
Urban evasion won't help you in a chase, though; what do you do if you're running a loop and suddenly trigger a trap?
---
I'm considering running it in my main build, kinda conflicted though because it best counters two of the killers I like the least. (hag and huntress) Should I be equipping perks because I want to have them, or because I don't want to not have them? hmm.
---
Seriously? That was your first understanding of that? Talk about sensitive.
---
Luckily rank 8 only got knocked down to rank 9
---
I see a great deal of low rank players getting incredibly hostile and toxic in post-game chats and do their best to BM in-game too. It may be a regional thing or just horrendously bad luck but I have seen very few people in the past months who have just been friendly, it becomes an almost infectious mindset to not become part of the problem when drowning in the sea of aggression.
---
As for the rest of your comment, Fruit? I don't understand half of what you said as your English skills are a touch iffy.
---
Why dont you?
---
1) If I wanted a pat on the back, I would‚Äôve gone to r/DeadByDaylightKillers. Plenty of people in the comments aren‚Äôt saying ‚Äúgood job buddy, herher‚Äù, they are telling me that there are better options and what I‚Äôm doing is wrong. 
---
2) Why would I chase after the dumbass if I know they will make mistakes later? I could go hook someone else and wait for them to eagerly unhook them and then finish them too. Not to mention, I don‚Äôt just wait for the unhook to happen, I hook and then follow the unhooker. 
---
3) If it‚Äôs considered tunneling, then I guess I‚Äôm a tunneler, I‚Äôd rather be that then someone who doesn‚Äôt take a easy sacrifice and a chase on the idiot who wasn‚Äôt patient enough.
---
"Everyone who disagrees with me must be a seven year old Ninja fan, thus making every valid point they have completely meaningless!"

My heart cant take such cuteness.
---
Nah I think they're a colonel at best
---
Time to get the rope hold on.
---
Just give him Brass Knuckles. Nuff said.
---
Only other thing you might be describing is rancor a spirit perk, when all gens are done you expose the obsession and can mori them or devour hope but that requires hooking a few times and being far away when they're rescued, devour hope is hag perk I believe
---
We really get this thread once a month
---
Hillbilly can get away with it though.
---
Let me guess: BBQC (guaranteed) + Infectious Fright/Enduring + SF/TT/Whispers (pick 3) ?
---
I hate these sort of players. They're so unbelievably cocky, and if anything doesn't go their way they just leave. If they lose, they're awfully sore losers, but they're also sore winners. Them DCing was probably for the best, cos otherwise they'll just be unpleasant.
---
I could care less about taking that much time to find a chase the point is them disconnecting like little babies just cause they got hooked once in the basement it‚Äôs like the survivors just want me to let them do the gens and I sit there doing nothing it‚Äôs even worse bc they were red ranks the other two got hooked twice and they didn‚Äôt disconnect instead they just fixed the gens and left like a normal survivor would do not dc do to anger
---
Because hes a toxic asshat and hes not helping the community or spreading positivity. Hes not the same as for example Noob3 who has a reason to be toxic as for his series. Hes just toxic in general. Hes not like otz who knows about the game and discourages toxic behavior. I support him for playing dbd and giving us more players, but ffs did he have to give his fanboys a reaosn to be like him.
---
It‚Äôs kind of weird. Doing all the gens and escaping as quickly as possible is the goal of the game. However; if the survivors are really optimal with gens then the game can be over in like 3 minutes. If the game is over so soon then the survivors won‚Äôt pip as they likely will not have enough emblem points and the killer won‚Äôt pip. On top of that, neither side will get than many bloodpoints. The game actually penalizes survivors for playing optimally in a way lol.
---
First one is interesting but definitely needs a bigger range to be at all useful. 
---
Second one is interesting but I don't see it being all that useful.
---
You are way too damn optimistic to ever think something like the third one would work out well in this buggy mess of a game but its an interesting concept at least.
---
OhPedo....?
---
Wow OP, what incredibly DBD related content! I love browsing /r/DeadByDaylight for content relating to and discussing Dead By Daylight.
---
TBH I want story a chapter about redemption for Spirit. She becomes a survivor or give cosmetics to existing survivors based off the killers.
---
Ik and the other two teammates ended up escaping while they got hooked twice. The first two instantly dc‚Äôd without even letting there teammates rescue them
---
Smells like dedicated servers to me
---
Well I couldn‚Äôt use the ticket to buy dbd for free because I already had dbd...
---
I have no sympathy for Survivors past rank 12-ish. They show no mercy to me, and will gladly click their little flashlights and Tea-bag after stunning me, and taunt at the exit gates.
---
Fuck 'em.
---
If they hadn't teabagged I wouldn't do it. It's not like I ever indicated that I was friendly. I had hooked the Nea twice already and killed two other people. Not once had I acted "friendly". So when she teabagged and was at 99 stalk, I saw an opportunity and took it. I'm not obligated to be a "good sport", especially when she isn't a good sport.
---
Yeah. I never knew of the concept of a sore winner until I started playing DBD. People really just don't know how to be respectful.
---
You dropped your Feral Frenzy
---
From the 100 games I did this season, I've only seen one Freddy boi .. :/
---
Hmm... the entity doesnt allow unfaithful pawns though. There would need to be a pararel version of her as a survivor. There are pararel universes and it would be interesting seeing them two seeing each other. Would it cause confusion?
---
how is my asking why it‚Äôs an insult reading too much into the fact that it‚Äôs an insult?
---
Around 4 minute gen repairs just for him to come kick it with pop again it‚Äôs a blast
---
If i get one i will put on my tombstone
---
The worst part is when they win tbh. They'll of left a dozen or so games which didn't go their way, and then claim that the one where they got out by the skin of their teeth was "ezpz". Had some idiots like this earlier today, who then got me again in the following game. Let's just say I didn't play nice in that second one.
---
I can agree with the game being clunky and the game mechanics not being amazing although I believe they said somewhere Jason is meant to win for the majority of games
---
Read that outloud to yourself im sure you can understand my point. Its stupid is what im saying.
---
You're free to your opinion
---
I haven't had much experience with camping Wraiths. Dumb question, but are they cloaked or uncloaked? Since if he's cloaked the rescuer can probably unhook without getting hit.. but it won't trigger BT, but if he's uncloaked it's probably going to be a 1 for 1
---
Corrupt and ruin? Then you will Most of the time only play around 2 perks. Imo you should switch one of them for thanphobia
---
Play around with other killers you haven't before. I used to just main gf but now I play him, clown and spirit. Huntress can be really fun if you get really good at aiming her hatchets. Hillbilly can also be really fun cuz his chainsaw is instadown but it takes some practice to get right. Good luck and have fun
---
A toxic youtuber/streamer who isn't really a prominent member of the community anymore and imo isn't worth watching because he's incredibly arrogant and self-righteous.
---
There's a lot more promise with predator. Their staff has tripled since they started F13, Hunting Grounds doesn't rely on a Kickstarter budget, instead having full support of finance from SONY. Tbf, their support for F13 would have grown to be way more mainstream if not for Sean Cunningham and Victor Miller's lawsuit hell shutting off everything F13 related.
---
Self care bad
---
Ironically, this is exactly why they aren‚Äôt showing ranks. Having low ranks obviously demotivates the other survivors and makes them want to leave the lobby which ends up hurting queue times even more. They mentioned this on the last Q&amp;A. I guess it‚Äôs actually working lol.
---
Am I too late to get in on this? I‚Äôd love to drop by! :)
---
Nice, I bought one myself right before Black Friday. What did yours run for?
---
They do reset ranks. The game has many bugs to fix as well. but, what do you two really think then, eh? You speak up now son.
---
Not at all, messaging you the invite now!
---
Ok asshole
---
I didn't ask you why you did it, man. You can do whatever you want. It's embarrassing to put it online though.
---
Boi just don‚Äôt heal it‚Äôs that easy you don‚Äôt need to heal if you‚Äôre at the exit gate ready to leave
---
I am so glad I finished the Rift with level 3 and dont have to worry about grinding level 4
---
I feel like im being sacrificed to the entity when i look at this. 
---
Translation:i fucken love it.
---
If they win it was ez, if they lose the killer camped and tunneled the whole team simultaneously, killer was using op perks (while they're using a full set of meta perks), the killer was using otzcheats.com and there were server issues. This isn't everyone, but the ones that do this are more common than they should be.
---
It‚Äôs not exactly a bug. It‚Äôs a flawed ranking up system. You essentially don‚Äôt get the chaser (and maybe devour?) that the game wants for you to rank up or even black pip.
---
Him being a bad influencer in the fortnite community,Im really concerned he can hurt this games community for a while
---
Dude it's not new and all of freddy's slowdown addons literally got nerfed quite hard why are people still complaining about this??? They hardly do anything now
---
Dude... If you're saying dcing just cuz you got beat makes me the asshole, you really don't understand how this game is played.
---
It wasnt a sarcastic question it was genuine
---
Always makes me afraid to see players that are clearly friends. They'll 70% of the time always help the friend that becomes Jason. Doesn't really make me hate the game so much like everyone else does. Just came back to it the other day, and it's refreshing to have more than one objective and a killer who can't be bullied without consequence.
---
They wanna get fragments for the rift
---
I leave ruin off whenever I run something like devour. Hopefully by the time they realize what‚Äôs happening it‚Äôs too late
---
Thanks for the detailed answer! I'm surprised that her average speed, even with two blinks at a time, isn't much faster than default killer speed.
---
Yeah I completely agree. I don't know how many times after a solid 4k game they all tried their hardest to talk shit about my perks or my play style. Just take the L and play another match. Smoke some green if it stresses you out so much.
---
Getting reset is not the same as smurfing though. People seem to misuse the term. Smurfing is playing on a new account to verse players of lower skill level, this ain‚Äôt it.
---
So was this comment.
---
Mamushka!
---
When did you buy the battle pass? Also if you didn't know you can do the free track and you can buy the premium one whenever you want and you'll get all the rewards you've earned
---
Yeah like they‚Äôre entitled to win but the killer hooking all survivors is the most forbidden thing in the game for them that‚Äôs were they draw the line when they lose all of a sudden messages just get spammed into your inboxü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I would like them to move to a DBD2 with a new engine. I‚Äôm guessing one of the reasons that the game is semi consistently in a buggy state is that the code at the very base of the game is poorly written.
---
I've never hated anything more
---
Except for when the killer is going full sweaty, the randos are running from the killer in a pair and the other is searching a chest... with 4 gens left.
---
How do you get the game on mobile? And does it work on IOS?

Kinda brutal
---
This.
---
If they just completely reworked the game it would keep it so fresh and alive for a long time.
---
I didnt see that, I wasnt trying to be rude
---
I have NAT type 2 but I understand that some people may be stuck with type 3 due to isp issues or their living situations.
---
I don't think ranking them that way is useful.
---
There aren't any killers that are fun to fight. Fun is derived mostly from you and your team making plays.
---
That's not to say different killers don't feel different to fight, but "fun" isn't how I'd put it.
---
It's a matter of satisfaction more than it is fun.
---
Trapper is less fun to fight than Legion since he's harder to beat, but he's also morr satisfying exactly because of that challenge.
---
Other than his lack of map pressure, one of Clown's biggest weaknesses are pallets. Since you vault pallets at full speed even while under the effects of his tonic, there's not much a Clown can do to you other than to break said pallet ASAP, assuming you're at a safe loop.
---
I did that with a David but BT and a well timed DH meant we both escaped. He rescued me from a face camp. I returned the favour
---
Where a killer focuses on removing one survivor from the game and will only target specifically them.
---
Don't listen to Tru3tal3nt foreheads relying on only stealth not stalk strats. Stalk when you have the perfect opportunity, then follow up with close range ambush. If there's no chance of gaining the mark, that is when you rely on stealth attacks. Can never understand when they say Ghost Face's stalk is horrible when his stalk in base kit is way faster than The Shape's. Those players probably never use the lean mechanic.
---
Awesome! Thanks again for the help!
---
are you trolling?
---
I think that DBD has the potential to be the next game like Fortnite where it could get ridiculously popular and start a trend of other games trying to be like it even more than it already has. But it‚Äôs so damn buggy, camping/tunneling suck the fun out of the game for survivors, extreme toxicity, map issues and more really hold the game back. The concept is really really good though.
---
Alright, thanks.
---
I just played a match where I slaughtered three guys around the basement during endgame collapse and got entity displeased.
---
Yup. Honestly, BHVR created this strict meta when they continually refuse to allow Survivors to see each other's perks. I'll explain.
---
SWF has such a massive advantage that it fundamentally alters the flow of the game. If the Killer is facing four randoms, the Survivors have zero means of communicating or coordinating. They're essentially blind, and surely have redundant perk builds. With SWF, every person in the group can create the most synergistic build possible, giving each player a specific role.
---
Given the sporadic nature of matchmaking, these two VASTLY different experiences occur randomly, preventing any truly accurate measure of the game's balance. So, what we have now, is a strict meta, where one side almost always gets steamrolled, depending completely on RNG. By allowing all Survivors to see each other's perks, they can plan around them. This would really help BHVR gather data on usage/success rates across the board.
---
I cant always keep track of the patches but it became popular at some point. Even nerfed, all of the stuff combined can be irritating. I at least try to stay through it anyways. So many people still dc.
---
What I‚Äôve been doing is going to the farthest gen and using night shroud. Then I stalk them from afar and just tunnel them till they‚Äôre down. Is that a good tactic?
---
Hahaha. I thought the aroma was familiar üòÇ
---
I'm ok with two perks at mid-end game, survivors either clease or stay sick for 1hit, so a little slug is good to split pressure
---
This might be a long shot but do you want to play together?
---
I hate Ninja so much...
---
I thought he was notorious for his H1Z1 rage
---
It would definitely cause confusion. I have something to add to that theory. What about reincarnation? Someone whose exactly like Rin almost except she was born years before or years later and potentially in a different country.
---
What is forever Freddy?
---
That‚Äôd be cool as hell on a t shirt
---
I would love parallel reality killers and survivors.
---
Rin, Phillip Ojomo, Bubba Sawyer, and even Adris are all tragic on some level. On the flip-flop, David King has a mean streak, Ash has been possessed by Kanderian demons, and Dwight seems like the kind of on edge guy who‚Äôs ready to snap.
---
Can we not talk about this, please? This could restart an old conversation that can create toxicity. We need to move away from this.
---
"You get what you fuckin' deserve!!!"
---
3 gens done in less than a minute, and two of them were flashlight clicking you as well. Man, those must be some new survivor perks that let 2 people complete gens so fast. 
---
 That, or you're majorly exaggerating what actually happened in the game. For all we really know. You could have face camped in the basement and that's why two of them quit out.
---
*Laughs in Oni*
---
Same difference imo. He is just bad.... lol
---
Oh yeah , thanks man
---
I don't know one person who plays on switch
---

---
Lmao. I can imagine dwights ability being about lockers. But i like the ideas.
---
The worst part was her father saw this and though ‚ÄúYeah, she needs to die too...‚Äù
---
Good Clown's will be able to catch you at pretty much any loop. A well placed bottle will cut infinites short, make most pallets unsafe, and can actually take away all your options at a loop once he sets up. However, his big weakness is he has absolutely no map pressure beyond the person he's chasing.
---
So to counter Clown you do two things: first and most importantly, make optimal use of your time when you aren't being chased. You can pretty much track where he is by the giant pink clouds, so if he's not on you get your ass on a gen. 
---
Second, bias yourself to throw pallets early. Maybe you can only loop once before you throw it. Maybe you can't loop it at all and just stand there and "waste" it. Like any m1 killer, if he just chases you through all the pallets on the map the gens will be done long before you run out. Work in windows when you can but for the most part you can't stay at them, even if it's usually a god loop. If you're worried about saving pallets then commit to not throwing any down until you're injured, but most of the time it's worth just not letting him hit you. Even better for you if he runs out of bottles and has to reload, giving you more time to run straight before you throw another one down.
---
nope, killers also get a penalty for wining fast, exactly as survivors get, in the end u just shouldnt win that fast, the only benefit ull get will be making the other side depip in other words being a d
---
I think you're vastly overestimating the thought put into these decisions.
---
1. These devs often just make changes with no real justifiable reason, just because.
---
2. Even if the devs think it's fair, whether they're right or not is another matter entirely. 
---
3. "Just go for a grab" has to be a joke. Grabs haven't worked properly for months now.
---
No problem, but I should also clarify that you need to be running in order to vault pallets fast, of course. The only time you vault them slowly is if you're not running.
---
Hmm.... i doubt it would work though. We have proof of the entity messing with life and death but reincarnation? No proof.
---
Ohh yeah this is big brain time
---
Hey at least you killed one

Sure, I'm on PC. And fair warning I am rank 1 surv. Add me on steam Cool Steve

She‚Äôs definitely one of the harder killers to use as her power isn‚Äôt as straightforward as most others but you can get used to it after playing her. A couple things to note though. 
---
This is probably the worst time to play Spirit. Her power is currently bugged so that she doesn‚Äôt get her speed boost out of it, survivors can now run through her, and the sounds for footsteps aren‚Äôt working properly. Therefore tracking a non injured survivor is harder than it usually is and on top of that, if the survivor runs through her, it can be difficult for her to catch them due to the inability to correct for this and the inability to track them well through footsteps.
---
Have you considered adding Play With Your Food for that extra little speed boost when you start your murder rampage?

I‚Äôm proud of you for trying. And yeah, removing them probably shouldn‚Äôt happen as Keys have functions other then opening the hatch, a mostly want Keys to lose the ability to open the hatch while Gens are still yet to be done when theres more then person left.
---
I didn‚Äôt say that killers didn‚Äôt get a penalty for winning fast lol.
---
Killer is an even bigger mess entirely. A killer can have a nice, good game and 3K but not pip because the majority of the downs came from one shots and or the survivors got 1 or 2 hooked lol. The entire system is kind of mess rn.

I dont play dbd so i dont understand most of these memes but i do know legion sucks . i would play dbd if i had a pc tho
---
Does the "help focus" come before or after healing? And if "help focus" doesn't include a slap to the face, I don't want it. Because it had the potential to mess with survivors for 45 seconds, it would need a longer cooldown. 
---
 Distract is way too powerful. Six skillchecks that automatically fail? And result in the explosion audio cue for the killer. Because you were hit once? And absolutely no cooldown for the ability? This would instantly be a top perk because just going around hitting survivors stops any and all progress of the game. This isn't even a real perk and it already needs a heavy nerf. 
---
 The hex perk seems.... bad. Not for the survivor. For the killer. Just because I don't hear your killer radius, that isn't gonna stop me from looking around. Too many silent killers have already made survivors not trust the terror radius. If you think 8 meters is enough to somehow not notice an oni, or a Michael, or a trapper coming towards me, then you are very much mistaken.
---
but wont you tiering up to tier ii give them a clue that you are not actually afking?
---
It is possible to use that way of play, but I would say stalking at an appropriate level of closeness gives you a bigger element of surprise to ambush and down them. I would say it's a little funny stalking them from afar, Watching them freak out lol.
---
And you‚Äôre toxic
---
Fuck this shit, survivors get 5 perks now ?

/ragequit
---
He doesn't know hiw things work when it's right in front of him and readable. Anything that could happen with any aura reading perk is hacking or stream sniping. Any killer who finds him is a filthy asshole or a hacker who he'll shittalk to all oblivion. On his streams he plays and talks about dbd as if it's modern warfrare 2 with the find of kid shittalk in it's prime. Said shit like "you're mom" etc. To shittalk his teammates in the pregame and then bitches at them when he doesn't get healed or unhooked. Anytime he gets oneshot, "HOW DID HE ONE SHOT ME" broken game with a hacker killer.
---
If someone‚Äôs teabagging I tunnel
---
Can see why you're called fruit loops. You're an absolute nut.
---
No it's almost like I think using tactics that don't allow new players to play the game will drive players away as I've discovered with first hand experience. (There's also quite a few threads on this now so... not alone) if you wanna keep the player base the size it is and keep killer queues long... more power to you.
---
As for teaching new players. There's no in game voice chat so warning new players isn't a doable thing with the way the game is set up survivor side...
---
why does everyone care that ninja plays dbd
---
You mean The Shape/Michael Myers? 
---
His ability allows him to stalk survivors to Evil Within III that allows him to instantly down people for a period of time. When you play against him you want to stay hidden as much as possible so he can't stalk you. Unfortunately if your teammates give him a lot of stalk you can't do much but hide while he's in Evil Within III.
---
Not really.
---
Oni needs his power to do that, and picking up a survivor ends his power.
---
The only ways that can happen are if Oni had his power, but didn't use it to down this guy, or if Oni hit somebody while carrying the body.
---
I never face camped in my killer games I resent killers that camp the hook when I play as survivor you hook them and leave that simple go disrupt a gen heat the unhook notification go back hit the one that unhooked him and I let the unhooked person go heal themselves
---
Im not sure if you‚Äôre talking about me ( OP ) or ninja
---
Afaik the "official" definition of genrushing is prioritizing gens over unhooking. The opposite of tunneling, I guess.
---
BULGE
---
You do realise how big the perk pool is right? You do realise the likelihood of picking the perks to counter your perks is very slim...
---
Right?
---
There we go, you have finally answered my question
---
I have already been playing DBD
---
I just think noed is a little desperate. It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúLooks like the survivors did their job well because you couldn‚Äôt stop them, so here one shot everyone.‚Äù Like... if you have to run noed you need to work on gen control and chase time.
---
I have clinical PTSD, I would definitely flip off the guy who gave it to me.
---
You mean ochido?
---
:'(
---
Yea this is PS4. He‚Äôs pretty meh imo. The best thing about him on console is that the controller issue with him didn‚Äôt get fixed until the same patch where he got nerfed so in the end, he ended up staying relatively the same on console. Unlike PC players who got to play God Oni and then Top tier Oni and now have to play regular Oni lmao.
---
This coming from somebody who played all 3 versions but mainly plays console now.
---
Ninja just a grown as baby he gets mad at losing fortnite fucking FORTINITE calling them cheaters instantly imagine him playing any other game besides that he‚Äôll instantly call everyone a cheater if they make him lose in any way
---
1 after the healing. And I guess the animation would just be a slap and a backslap two or three times.
---
2 Let that scape, but I guess I will nerf it.
---
3 ok, sorry for that. I guess it could just work against some low ranks.
---
But didn't get it but imagine every time you press r3 a pallet drops on their head
---
UwU
---
Wasn't expecting that, nicely played
---
Lovely x
---
I dont play the game toxic at all actually. He just annoys me because he thinks he can do no wrong and nobody can beat him at anything. It would be nice to see him get upset at getting a dose of reality from a random player. Not only that I dont appreciate the fact that he voices his opinions on things like game balance when he doesn't have enough experience with it yet to truly know, on top of that because of the size of his audience and how many he can get to echo him he could cause bad balance changes. He is already claiming the pig is op and haddonfield is too tough of a map as a survivor....
---
Every community has a ‚Äúbad‚Äù community. I joined not too long ago. I didn‚Äôt hear jack all about the toxic community. It‚Äôs something you experience becoming part of the community. New players will come. It‚Äôs whether or not they stay.
---
Funny because even six months ago, it was the opposite sentiment. People at high ranks were extremely fuckin tired of seeing Billy every game
---
Oof
---
Exactly my point.
---
Clown is really fun to play against if only because his laughing is really fucking funny.
---
Ghostface is also pretty fun to play against because I love knocking him out of stealth. &gt;:)
---
Pretty sure someone else poster this 3 days ago...
---
Adding you now!
---
One thing I noticed, at the start you were uncertain as to where to go, and kind of walked in a circle initially. Only costed you a few seconds, but time management is a huge part of playing killer; becoming aware of how you can squeeze out more time in everything you do is very useful.
---
Watch some streamers play, and learn from watching them. Otzdarva, Zubetlel, ScottJund, just to throw some names out. You will learn A LOT. They might not always explain what they're doing, but with everything they do ask yourself "why did they do that?" If they make a mistake they usually will say "Oh that was dumb" or something, so unless they admit to that, everything they do should be with intent.
---
Yea
---
You do realise that in that cartoon, Tom's army of pussycats are ineffective against Jerry?
---
Talk about meme gone wrong.
---
Only the best for dbd
---
Yeah no problem
---
&gt;The game actually penalizes survivors for playing optimally in a way lol.
---
No I know that. I was without a PS4 since like September just got another one for me and the kids for Christmas a couple weeks ago and played it for a couple weeks. I never buy the battle pass unless I know I can complete it. So I was trying to see how far I could get. But got sidetracked lol. Plus been busy playing other games. I dunno I guess I don't have the dedication for battle passes. Just not my thing.
---
I did buy the first one they released for apex cuz I got heavy into it and thought it would actually complete it. Then Mk11 came out and I forgot all bout the game and that I had even bought the pass lol.
---
&gt; No it's almost like I think using tactics that don't allow new players to play the game will drive players away as I've discovered with first hand experience.
---
Ever heard of a game called Dark Souls? where nobody from PvE to PvP cares about being nice to new players they more like destroying new players and yet Dark Souls still stays popular so it almost becomes subjective or maybe its cos people know it is Dark Souls but there are more games 
---
CSGO, R6 or even any battleroyal game hell even COD especially the new one where ppl use the best strats they can to win sure CSGO and r6 are competitive games and DBD is a unbalanced mess which is why I added COD MW *the new one* where maps are so fucking flawed camping is easier but yet it stays popular. 
---
DBD is known as a game that is 1. unbalanced 2. toxic and 3. a fucking mess if you even expected a fair game where ppl agree to set rules that the devs never gave a shit about then go ask for a casual mode. You can disagree all u want and I am gonna keep saying that just bc it might turn 1 or 2 survivors off from the game it could in turn make the killer even more interested even branching to try new things and to final end up where all killer mains end up not giving a shit and just play bc we can.
---
You wanna sit there and make up shitty insults go for it but maybe u should learn that this is the most subjective shit ever and my opinion is as valid as the OP is
---
I think they are definitely creative. I would like to see perks like this in the game but they are a little bit overpowered. With a little tweaking they would make more sense. Good ideasüëå
---
I mean he basically wastes the whole game just trying to stalk people so I'd say its semi balanced especially since they made it so you can't multi stalk anymore
---
If someone un-hooks right in front of me I'll swing and if I hit the hooked person I'll leave them down so someone can pick them up and I'll go after the asshole who thought they are funny.
---
I don't like being farmed so I don't do it to other people
---
Now it's 3 of us.
---
Would probably work similar to the insta heal needle. Just appears as a small timed thing next to the 4 perks
---
Even noob3 would be like "oh shit that's toxic as hell'
---
oh yeah huh
---
Try TOTH, become the totem protecter
---
when it works it is broken when it doesn't it is useless it is the biggest hit or miss addon combo in the game tbh
---
I‚Äôd say Jane is ENFP
---
The game penalizing survivors for playing optimally=/the game not penalizing killers for playing optimally. The statement being true does not mean the inverse is true. If a killer plays optimally and snowballs super hard off of survivor mistakes, then they also will not pip.
---
Yeah, I'm not embarrassed. Take your moral highground somewhere else, I'm not interested in listening to it.
---
I‚Äôm that type of survivor that dips immediately, unless if someone is hooked, then I‚Äôll try and save them.
---
How to know who the killer is:
---
Nurse: Loud ass wheezing and screeching
---
Trapper: Somebody else steps in the trap
---
Doctor: You don‚Äôt find him- he finds you. Why? Because screw you that‚Äôs why.
---
Hillbilly: RRRRRRRRRRHN!
---
Legion: Why is everybody bleeding?!
---
Plague: Why is everybody vomiting?!
---
Clown: I can‚Äôt see-There‚Äôs glass in my eyes- and why is everybody coughing?!
---
Wraith: Bing Bong doing gens is wrong!
---
Shape: Man I wonder who the killer is- OH SHIT!
---
Pig: Man I wonder who the killer is- never mind there‚Äôs a Jigsaw box right there.
---
Cannibal: RRRRRRRRRRHN but with autistic screeching!
---
Spirit: r/woooosh.
---
Oni: RAAAAAAAAAAH!
---
Demogorgon: H‚àÄ‚àÄ‚àÄ‚àÄ‚àÄ‚àÄ‚àÄ‚àÄ‚àÄ‚àÄ·¥ö
---
Ghostface: Hide and seek but with extra steps.
---
Huntress: *Ominous humming* and/or *Agressive grunts of murderous intent followed by the woosh of an axe shaving your ass hair*
---
Nightmare (Pre-rework): One... Two... wait come back.
---
Nightmare (Post-rework): Literally just look down at the indicator.
---
Hag: You wish somebody else stepped in the trap.
---
Omfg amazing lol
---
This might be the best thing I've ever seen.
---
thank you! funny
---
Did you manage to get through tier 2 without them suspecting??
---
This happened again, 3 rank 20-19 survs, me (rank 8) and a rank 20 smurf killer. Honestly, I‚Äôm kind of in the same boat, it‚Äôs just because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a killer match. I was more focused on the 3 noobs I had to deal with.
---
This is nothing compared to 20 killers going against rank 1 swf.....
---
Lol getting culture exchange and get self care off the other survivor
---
facts, they just be chilling above the basement
---
Too much thinking for this meme
---
This post requires too much thinking
---
that devour hope looks tasty, finally a hex perk that i'm interested in.
---
Yeah, wtf is this
---
Are you playing killer or survivor or both.  
---
What do you feel you do well? 
---
What's your favorite perk?
---
The killer isn't getting punished for it. Sure most killers will probably just be over zealous and swing right away, but if the killer just sits there and wait, it's essentially the equivalent of having 2 survivors on 1 hook without any penalty to the Chaser emblem either since you're right there with him.
---
Facecamping is just toxic in general if you really wanted to be toxic shoulda played bubba
---
There's literally so many things wrong with this post
---
Nah I'm a hunteress main btw I don't play like this just for the vid
---
Smurfing is playing on a low level account as a skilled player. While everyone seems to believe you cant depip past 16 there are ways to do so.
---
For channels, Otzdarva and Fungoose are two really good streamers that also upload guides to their youtube channels, both are killer main's, fungoose is more focused on the meta builds while otz is very varietal, both great people for new players and veterans to learn from. Painreliever is a youtuber who also has guides, explains what he does in his gameplays at key moments and does gameplay critiques of footage sent to him. All those guys really helped me out early on.
---
Ok thanks really appreciate it because I'm trying to get into art
---
Most people can.
---
Sad theres no ENFP :c
---
I mean yeah but we want them to stay. A larger player base helps with the problems with rank matchmaking and lobby times that is currently a problem. So sure, we're always going to get a flux of new players every now and then but if only a couple of them stay it's not really good.
---
#WANNA HEAR DAT BEAT THO
---
He hooked ya.
---
In a perfect world
---
Literally just hit continue and get back into the main menu lol
---
YESSSS The Entity blessed me!
---
why must we cheat
---
Maybe use object? Bait the killer, get their attention
---
Just camp pallets. But hide just beside them. If you‚Äôre on console just make sure you have a good connection. Sucks but if you get an aggressive enduring spirit fury killer it‚Äôll go by fast
---
&gt;OP perks such as Ruin and NOED
---
This is a joke, right? Or are you just a rank 20?
---
What's even better is when you accidentally lure out the flashlight when in reality you are just putting a bear trap on the survivor.
---
He is 5 inches.
---
Ninja ü§Æ
---
Yes
---
Considering the amount of views he gets on his videos doubt it will make much of a difference. And if his fans play how he plays then at some point they‚Äôll get tired of being demolished over and over again but killers that aren‚Äôt brain dead
---
Imma try this.
---
fix your lag
---
Nope, you can still get them
---
Ok babe, I'll stop.
---
Then why are you on this sub?
---
What I do is farm with them and when all gens are done I smack them with Noed and hook them all and laugh.
---
Ok dickwad.
---
Heard a while ago he was playing? 
---
I don't follow his career, is he playing dbd a lot now?
---
Should have specified that by maxed, I mean by level. So how many BP is required to get every character to P3/50. The numbers come from manually counting trends of bloodweb costs at different levels.
---
Make a yt chanel and create more. Will 100% subscribe! And also, It was the funniest DBD realated video I watched
---
&gt;Most kids won't even be allowed this game.
---
dude lets be honest what parent of 2019 are gonna give a shit about violent games
---
I just don't want ninjas fans in the game just to see the dumbest of posts on here but that is just me tho
---
Amazing!! :0
---
Damn she's thick!  Love it
---
fuck off I don't want to wait in a 5 min que just for sitting around for 10 min to get less BP I could have gotten
---
they should remove the splinters for ppl that fucking own the characters
---
I mean you can only get splinters for killers you don't own
---
Why?
---
i love how people are freaking out saying "he is toxic and will only bring toxicity to the community" when he was literally playing with hexy, one of the biggest cunts in the community.
---
People should be complaining about hexy, not ninja
---
I'm just so glad to have a computer because I'm sure mostly console players will be affected.
---
For everything else.
---
*brushes dust of shoulder* 
---
I'm too high ranked to speak peasant  :P
---
Yea same. Usually for me on PS4 its yellow rank killers vs purple survivors, with your reds and greens sprinkled throughout
---
Except Leatherface. 
---
Basement Leatherface from the beginning of the match is hilarious if nobody sees him while grabbing the chest.
---
Now do a disconnect icon for the full DBD experience
---
Toxic indeed.
---
Video is ok, used the same sound effects a number of times, not the best editing.
---
why should I have splinters filling my bloodweb for a killer I already own it is stupid
---
ngl I don't know if they have fixed it but I remember getting splinters for killers I own
---
Sorry I had limited sound Effects at my disposal to use for this btw I dont actually play like this
---
tbh since he is playing with Hexy that is gonna paint his view of the game in a different light from how it could have been painted a real mess
---
excuse me, but what is a Forever Freddy? I'm not... in. I just play the game
---
I think they already fixed it. Now you won't get splinters if you own all older killers
---
thank god
---
Trapper: primary win condition - placing traps near the last 3 gens.  How to play against.  If you can have him chase you away from the traps, your team can disarm the traps.
---
Wraith: primary win condition - surprise attacks (free hits).  How to play against.  He's easily loopable.  A common build is to use a nurses calling, so be extra careful when healing, try to heal when you know where he is.
---
Hillbilly: primary win condition. To down you faster than you can save.  Slugging is common.  How to play against.  Stealth/Playing around strong loops to stop from going down against the chainsaw.  He has almost no ability to stealth himself.
---
Nurse:  A very slow killer, but can teleport.  You're looking to lose line of sight and gain distance.
---
Shape/Michael Myers:  He has 3 tiers, tier 1-no terror radius. tier 2 - he's an M1 killer. tier 3- he can 1 shot you and he moves faster.
---
How to play against.  Use cover to stop him from stalking.  Another effective strategy is to use a flashlight while he's stalking.  While he's at tier 3, it's very important that you avoid having your entire team go down.  You may need to make sacrafices, like allowing a team mate to go down an extra stage while on hook if that means that you don't all get slugged.
---
Hag - She's strongest around hooks and basements - however she's weak during the chase.  To beat her you need to prioritize gens over saves.  If someone goes down in the basement, you may want to consider letting them die on hook.  It is possible to save them, but you'll probably just end up in the basement too.
---
Doctor- doctor has a madness mechanic that's fairly involved and you should look into them on your own.  But as a general rule.  You want to be at madness 2 as a survivor but avoid getting to madness 3 at all costs.  Do not go for a save unless you are at madness 2.  If you are near madness 3 get away from the doctors terror radius, if it's not possible to get away, get into a locker (but be careful, doctors expect survivors to hide in lockers)  If you're outside of the terror radius you can push down your madness by crouching.  Your madness does not go down while you are working on a generator.  
---
Huntress - Can throw hatchets or use a basic M1 attack.  You'll be able to hear her humming before you hear her heartbeat.  Treat her humming as a sign that she's right on you because Huntresses often run Monitor and abuse which will reduce her terror radius.  You generally want to have as much distance as you can from her.  Do not vault or use pallets while there is line of sight, otherwise you will get hit.  Look over your shoulder to dodge hatchets, be careful not to run into walls.
---
Bubba/Cannibal - when versing a Bubba you'll need to identify if this is an insidious bubba (insidious removes your terror radius if you stop moving)  If it is an insidious Bubba, do not go for a save.  You win by pressuring generators.  Avoid grouping up because his attack is an area of attack and he can down multiple survivors at once.
---
Freddy/Nightmare- Freddy is worth looking at his abilities.  He's got a bunch and they're all powerful.  He can teleport to any generator that isn't complete, he can create either a blood puddle or a fake pallet.  You are on a timer and then you'll enter the dream world.  You'll also enter if he hits you.  Once in the dream world he'll be able to use the blood puddle or pallets against you.  When teleporting to a generator blood will start spewing from it, however, he can fake the teleport.  It's worth looking into his add-ons to see what other abilities he has.  Freddy is currently the strongest killer (IMO) but countering him is all about knowing when to be asleep and awake.  You can wake up using an alarm clock or missing a skill check on a generator or having a team mate wake you up.  You won't be able to stay awake for very long, so like I said it's about knowing when it's most advantageous to be awake.  Also pay attention to where the completed generators are, they're the safest locations on the map against Freddy.
---
I've been writing this for a while now, so hopefully others will continue where I left off.
---
It really depends on how popular DBD stays. If it's bringing in a lot of money and maintaining a good playerbase, it'll probably be supported for longer. Also, BHVR right now has nothing to fall back on, and unless that changes in the next couple of years, we'll still keep getting DBD stuff. If they can't make another successful, long lasting game, we probably will see a DBD2. 
---
As the existing comments say, the buggyness, asshole killers, toxicity on both sides, and map issues NEED to be fixed if this game is gonna survive a couple more years. People have been getting burnt out hardcore, especially with the rift having a negative effect on some people (like myself). 
---
Also, DBD as it is is just too simple of a game. Simply adding a new killer every few months isn't gonna be enough, especially when those killers have similar abilities. We need something major to shake up the gameplay. Honestly the right move DOES seem to be making DBD2, but who knows if they could survive for that long if they stopped releasing DBD content.
---
I don‚Äôt main as a specific survivor. I just play with whoever I‚Äôm feeling, but I guess I prefer Feng. I wish I had a clue as to why. Probably because her perks are pretty cool? 
---
As for killer, Myers is my all time favorite. Not just to play as but to play against because for some reason it seems like everyone who plays Myers has a great sense of humor and it just makes the game fun.
---
someome complained to you that ur hogging the gen? Didn't know it was that common, only happened once for me
---
Mm yes
---
legion broke the lvl wheel well shit now he needs another skin and another nerf
---
Looks like you dropped your rubbish bag.
---
Is he still terrible as survivor as he was like 2 weeks ago when that video of him playing was posted?
---
Quality or Quanitiy?  Right now we have neither so why not more.  You admitted yourself it's toxic already so might as well have more people in general.
---
Honestly I might do that, that‚Äôd be very funny lol
---
i dont think hanging with hexy will make him see the game how its supposed to be.
---
Hexy is so unbelievably annoying, and i can see ninja learning from him, and thats terrible
---
I wasn't..
---
This was the most amazing video ive ever watched and if I had any rewards id give them to you
---
Agree with the first part probably will affect console.  Second part not really it's easy ot get red ranks in this game.  I have 60 hours and reached red ranks at 46 hours mainly SoloQ sometimes with 1 friend that was new like me.  
---
So not to take you off your high horse but forced casual ranking systems mean nothing.
---
You you so much for the platinum, kind stranger!
---
For DBD2 we‚Äôd need a complete overhaul. Graphics, animations, physics, sound, bugs, etc. all need sorted and improved. We also need new stuff to keep us interested and I think a main thing for that would be a new game mode/game modes.
---
Abusing pallets? That‚Äôs a weird way to say wasting pallets
---
Huh. It's every other post for me.
---
It's stupid it's like wow you're doing exactly what you don't like others doing to you to someone that hasn't done crap to you way to go lol
---
Can someone plz tell me what AFK means (I know I‚Äôm gonna feel dumb after someone tells me). Thx üòä
---
Wow. I've had 3 quit and the hatch spawned next to me, so I took it. Definitely didn't talk crap to the killer, though. I like how he called you a noob when he's a lower rank than you. Lol
---
I was talking in the part of matchmaking not in the community bc ultimately it wont change do u want more low rank scrubs that will make the already fucked matchmaking worse or can we just stay with the current that is fucked but not at fuck capacity I dont know how to word this better
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs all about juggling as killer. It‚Äôs a 4v1 so you‚Äôve either gotta get very quick downs or keep all the survivors active/injured. Really depends on killer ofc, no way you can play for 12 hooks against a somewhat decent team as clown
---
Bit of a jump there mate calm down.
---
Their game could have crashed, it happens.
---
I'm a low mid-rank killer (14-13, sometimes hitting 12 and immediately getting stomped back to 13) consistently getting matched with survivors at rank 8-6. Out of five matches, only one survivor was rank 9, the rest were all purple with one or two at rank 5. I don't like to complain because I often get a kill or two but honestly? It feels horrible tryibg to do a Huntress daily when I've played maybe three matches as her (for dailies) and my aim is horrendous.
---
Thanks for telling me that this shit head is playing dbd. I now hate the game that much more
---
This is absolutely amazing man
---
No it was intentional. Usually, if it's a game crash, the DC doesn't make a noise.
---
Not sick enough, we want more.
---
I never watched him play.  I just saw the barrage of hate posts and honestly got tired of seeing them.  I wish mods would just delete new posts hating on him or his community not because I'm a fan (because I'm not) but it's repetitive, boring and toxic.
---
Why do people care, 99% of this sub are keyboard warriors in post game. Reddit warriors are the most toxic so how bout stop giving a fuck abt ninja.
---
They were mostly ghostfaces with no way to tell they were camping hidden with their 2nd hook they can't know that.
---
6' vs. 5'13"
---
I'm a survivor main and this was still really satisfying to watch.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised what a 7 year-old can get their hands on regardless of cost
---
Personally I only stream snipe people I randomly met, I do not arash someone.
---
Relatable, i just quit but i will probably start playing again in a few months or so
---
correct me if I am wrong.  It was made eaiser to rank up due to Red ranks having insane queue times.  (I hit red rank in 45 hours game time, I don't even think I am good, I do not deserve to be this high.  If the game has more players the ranknig system could potentially be reverted as more new players come in eventually they are gonig to get better and will climb naturally meaning evne higher ranks queues will be lower.
---
Wouldn't you agree that's better?
---
The spirit one is pretty much what the devs think counterplay is.
---
What kind of killer brings a haddonfield offering
---
Away from keyboard
---
Why did the killer just sit and watch you?
---
Imma say this now because I agree with you here, it wasn‚Äôt wasted because it‚Äôs terribly unsafe. But if you do that with other pallets that can be looped multiple times before you are forced to drop then yes it would be a waste.
---
No a lot of them still do it straight away even when they're winning by a mile with the strongest perks, many hexes and camping as ghostface of all killers.
---
BART, YOU WANNA SEE MY NEW CHAINSAW AND HOCKEY MASK!?
---
the survivor ranking system was made harder killer is still like going on a swing stupidly fucking easy I barely give a shit and miss hits contently 500+ hours and yet I always end up at rank 1 as killer.
---
it has not been made easier what has happened is the rank reset system was changed and for some reason it resulted in low ranks being stuck with high ranks until they get around rank 14 I think.
---
The thing that this game needs besides fixing maps is a better matchmaking system that fucking works or to remove ranks completely
---
I like to run Surge, Surveillance (Helps cut down patrol times significantly by letting you know where survivors are not working on gens, procs on Surge, and the extra 8M hearing range on gen repairs basically saves you 2-4 seconds on a patrol near a gen if you got sharp ears), and Ruin.
---
DS for me is I never even remotely get tunneled, but if I don't have it, I get hook farmed by a fuckwit meg.
---
ninja bad, upvotes to the left
---
Keeps Survivors on their toes man
---
Clown (one of the worst killers in the game) brings a Mori noed and pinky‚Äôs and all he wants to do is see the mori? Damn that tbagging was pretty toxic tho fam
---
Possibly, but game modes also end up splitting the playerbase. One of the big complaints right now is how long queue times are, and that would only make it worse. Though, if they did do all those things for DBD2, it may be able to sustain multiple game modes. They also would have problems convincing people to move over if they didn't bring over every existing character, every existing cosmetic, and give them to previous owners for free in the new game. If they made a completely separate game and was like "ok bye guys, all your stuff stays in DBD1!" I bet that would piss off sooo many people. They'd have to do DBD2 like Blizzard is doing Overwatch 2.
---
Ruin serves it's purpose if it last long enough for you to get your first down before it pops.
---
Hag would be INFJ üò≠
---
She wanted to see me die to the trap probably
---
That‚Äôs true, but I‚Äôd imagine by that point they‚Äôll have implemented some sort of account system that‚Äôs allows cross-platform progression. This would make it easy to transfer everything over.
---
I heard 72hrs is good, check him out and ask about it.
---
Imagine teabagging vs ANY killer that has instadowns
---
we never said that, we said that it gets u exhausted yet u still get the hit
---
Buy him from the in game store. That‚Äôs the only way to use auric cells.
---
Ok? If I where on Reddit every day I probably woulda seen it then
---
I understand as that is completely justified and balanced
---
You can‚Äôt buy Freddy with auric cells because he is a licensed killer
---
Really I see no point in trying to be toxic to Ninja... he just wants to play Dead By Daylight, leave the man alone.
---
Nothing of him in the store.
---
Let them come, easy 4k
---
I have amanda.
---
I play a lot of Hag and Billy in red ranks so it's not like you need to play spirit.
---
"fun"
---
.. and not make the same mistake twice
---
Yeah it's weird, any time Jason is depicted by non hardcore horror fans, he always looks exactly like this: hockey mask, chainsaw, navy blue jumpsuit.
---
The survivors yearn and prey for the campfire light. It‚Äôs their only source of relief in the realm. They want to escape so they can just go back to the campfire. Every time they get sacrificed and don‚Äôt escape they lose a part of their soul. When their soul is torn apart the entity throws their souls away into The Void as it has no more use to the Entity. If anything it would be the opposite.
---
Nah the high horse was just me memeing.
---
I dont care about most. And to be high ranks you gotta be SOMEWHAT useful. 
---
And as theres no way of communication Im sure the toxicity wont be too much for the casual survivor
---
Haddonfield is cancer enough.
---
I honestly find the most annoying part that people care enough to complain about it. I cant stand him but any posts related to the fact a random dude plays dbd is just annoying.
---
and the sandbag too lmao F
---
Yeah would be pretty mad if someone healed me and I lost my exhaustion perk or charged inner strength.
---
I dunno when I‚Äôm playing Ghostie and me and a survivor are bagging at the exit gates like that I always see it as friendly conversation lol.
---
I believe OP has low graphics settings on
---
Wasn‚Äôt that in part 7 where he chased some guy through the woods with this thing that had a saw at the end of it?
---
No, Horror Inc killed him by refusing to deal with Victor Miller.
---
Those are one of the best killers. I thik? Hag is very good. Billy idk. I like spirit beacuse its easier to deal with annoying very safe loops.
---
Soo any tips on pig and ghostface?
---
(Havent tried ghostface yet, only leveled up.)
---
My tactic is usually double slugging. So there are 3 people off gens most of the time. (With spirit) cant achieve same with pig.
---
I got it for 1500 on Black Friday, down from 2000. Worth every penny, I love the thing
---
I‚Äôve had this happen a lot recently, and every time when I try to find killer (with spine chill aswell), I can never find them and it always ends up being a wraith?-
---
But why specifically does not being able to see your teamates ranks make you want to leave the game?  Is it so you can dodge the lobbies when you don't like what you see?  If so that's the reason they scrapped it.
---
they can never nerf Sussies cuteness tho
---
Matches take forever, regardless. And games are laggy because you're playing in dedicated servers. This isn't a "your internet" issue, it's a servers issue.
---
Freddy can only be bought with real money, not auric cells. Afraid you wasted auric cells, friend.
---
Would kill for this on a t-shirt.
---
He is not even in the shop...
---
It means the killer has NOED.  Cleanse the totems lol.
---
Congrats you‚Äôre gay
---
I hear he appears in dreams, have you tried putting your xbox in rest mode?
---
My point exactly it's a tad obsessive tbh
---
I don‚Äôt think NOED is overpowered in the slightest
---
the good ol' shyamalan twist
---
I bought him with auric cells...
---
Ah fair enough then sarcasm can be hard to see via text with the /s.
---
So being forced to play a shitty match with yellow ranks survivors against a red rank killer good to you?
---
It's also very possible to use the models geometry as collider in most engines, which makes me question why DbD has such a weird system for this kind of game.
---
Yeah I didn't say it was.  Just making fun of the fact that 9/10 when a killer gets gen rushed hard it's because they aren't playing to pressure gens.  This typically means they're running NOED.  If gens start flying you'll want to focus bones.
---
I  used to fuck up this always but in killershack it would piss me off so much
---
Maybe that wasn‚Äôt the best example but the point still stands. He‚Äôs already whined about BBQ &amp; chili being overpowered. What‚Äôs next, ruin?
---
Behaviour has already nerfed 5 killers since the last patch and I‚Äôm very scared that if this Ninja thing picks up whatever balance is left in this game will go to shit in favor of all the streamers that will inevitably jump on the bandwagon. It‚Äôs simple. Bog streamers get their brain dead followers (and their parents‚Äô money) into the game, BHVR makes more money, BHVR wants to keep the money coming in so they cave in to the person advertising the game to the largest amount of people. Guess who‚Äôs that going to be? If the devs didn‚Äôt listen to the community until now do you think it‚Äôs gonna get better with a wave of new people complaining about the skill gap? I don‚Äôt think so.
---
Confused me when I first saw this too.
---
Currently there are 6 killers who can consistently do amazing in red ranks if played by someone who knows what they are doing
---
Hag, Freddy, Billy, Spirit, nurse, GF.
---
While you will get your ass handed to you if you play a killer like clown or doc. I honestly dont understand why people say only top tiers are viable at red ranks. 
---
Most of the time when i play mid tiers i get at least 2 kills average. I almost never run into god swfs that everyone complains about.
---
Play killers you enjoy, honestly if they are mid tier or higher you will do just fine
---
Exactly, ‚ÄúGen rushing‚Äù is easily countered
---
I love this comment thanks for making my day.
---
Then post this in r/FridayThe13thGame
---
You can‚Äôt die if the timer runs out while you‚Äôre removing the trap so you were safe w/wo DH
---
XGP for pc, man.
---
I did :)
---
‚ÄúComplete trials without any chests searched ‚Äú
---
Are you insane?
---
Dodging lobbies is a massive problem on killer side and something that should eventually be addressed, the devs figured they'd remove it as a problem from survivor side.
---
I think we should all play the lobbies we queue into regardless of what side we're playing.  I've had plenty of potato red rank teamates.  I've also had great teamates with potato ranks too.
---
Freddy is definetly viable honestly yeah. I play him alot too. GF is alot of fun. I do agree with you on those. Would be fun if they buffed kilkers like the pig.
---
 Instead of going through the game store, try checking the xbox marketplace and straight up buying him from there.
---
This is why I don't delete Reddit, art like this
---
Oh I thought of seen people die while digging through the box, I‚Äôm pretty sure you can unless they nerfed her even more
---
Not Myers?
---
I thought the same thing, I would wave my hands warning them if a trap is nearby. like Hot and cold. the faster I wave the closer they are to danger XD And I do nearly full unhook animation if no one is coming for me :'D
---
Same I legit let the last player go if they don't wiggle... or last 2.... because I get more satisfaction from the 'thank yous' than the 'baby killer'
---
REALLY? Damn that sucks, have they given any info on when this is gonna be fixed? I thought it was odd how when I got close i heard their breath and that was it.
---
I think pig can have minor changes, pig is a lot better then people think she is.
---
I think they should focus on largely buffing the weaker killers and slightly tweaking the mid tiers to make them better at higher ranks
---
Even the entity can't approve of this level of sadism.
---
You can't seriously compare potato red ranks against yellow survivor you either trolling or you haven't played against red ranks because someone who doesn't even do gens and just stays in a corner of the map hiding while you die on hook is someone I certainly do not want to play with at red ranks, even as killer I do not want to play against a baby survivor because you don't even have to mindgame them and their pathing is trash makes for a shitty game both sides
---
Hard to master yeah...
---
I know they probably never will but if they do add him I want him to use his bare fists or maybe be able to have a bunch of different weapons that dont link to his power, because believe it or not, he's used a hell of a lot more than just a mechete
---
...Post it there and not here in an unrelated subreddit I meant...
---
This is a subreddit for Dead By Daylight, not Friday the 13th...
---
And they aren't really in competion because as far as I know, nobody on either side reallt cares to show any hate or disliking of the other game
---
This is like posting that you're about to get Overwatch in the Call of Duty subreddit simply based on the fact that they are in "competition," first off, they really don't have a war that's sticking out in any way shape or form, and second, the only similarity between that games is the core concept, shoot other people. Both designs, while revolved around the same general idea, are very much different, I just see no point in posting this here.
---
?  No NOED isn't a counter to gen rushing it's one of the main causes for it.  Killers playstyles with that perk rarely involve gen pressure period.  They allow the gens to complete.  This is due to a combination of inexperience/reliance on the instadown carrying them for a gimme down and final kill at the end. 
---
Counters for gen rushing would be perks like Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, Pop Goes the Weasel, Dying Light, Thanataphobia, Discordance, Surveillance, etc...
---
Also just countering gen rushing is a playstyle thing.  Don't camp hooks otherwise you invite it.  That kind of stuff.
---
If she wanted to watch you die, she would have stuck next to you, not run ahead and go somewhere else. Give the nice killer their due I stead of thinking the worst of them.
---
his ability and perks give way to insidious bubba, which is kinda op and real annoying
---
Nah they mean ruins but useful for the survivor you negative Nancy
---
‚ÄúGen rushing‚Äù isn‚Äôt hard to counter, people act like doing gens is toxic and shit
---
Nah you must not play pig, if she stuck by me like that I coulda kept activating chase so my timer would stop, she has to either crouch or run away to make my timer continue
---
just do what u like something that feels nice ofc u wouldn't want to bind ur action key on like m or o
---
Or she could have just knocked you down, and put you on a hook to kill you. But instead of going for you, she went for someone else.
---
Dude I play with terrible red rank Claudettes who can't run killers or work through ruin on a daily basis.  Rank isn't everything and I think it's beyond trash to cherry pick opponents.  I queue into a lobby and i play said lobby.  Queue times are too fucked for players to be that tryhard that they're only willing to play certain lobbies.
---
They talked about being aware of her power being broken in the last developed Q&amp;A so that might get hotfixed in a few weeks. The sounds probably won‚Äôt get touched until the next major patch. Sounds get broken pretty often. Breathing, footsteps, music, etc get bugged every patch in some way. I‚Äôve heard that you can‚Äôt hear survivors on the ground but can‚Äôt confirm. Before the hotfix, there was a glitch where the pickup/hooking sound would play for the rest of the game. Essentially; it‚Äôs probably best to not get your hopes up on them fixing sounds anytime soon.
---
no, he is F tier for fucking trash at least legion can use his power consistently
---
Could you say that in english?
---
*laughs in console user*
---
That's a you issue
---
Iirc adrenaline, dead hard, borrowed time and decisive strike. But dead hard has been pretty broken lately.
---
Yeah, part 7 the new blood. It was the douchey therapist I'm pretty sure.
---
She went for someone else because op was about to die, why would she just sit there instead of continuing to pressure?
---
This hurts equally as trying to drop a pallet but go in a locker when looping a jungle gym
---
When the timer runs out while you‚Äôre removing the trap, you would die right after if you fail to remove the trap
---
Aka Carrie vs Jason
---
You can die while searching the box?
---
Probably cause someone said it in the chat and he probably checked the huntress‚Äôs steam to make sure
---
As a fellow Ghostface player, I approve of this message.
---
"BHVR would never make a clown killer"
---
She could easily have downed him, but didn't. Even after he was no longer working on it. Instead she ran somewhere else. That, to me, seems to be a nice killer who didn't want to be seen as tunneling, not as a killer who just wanted to "watch him die".
---
The community would agree if he didnt have such a huge ass following
---
He's not available in the Windows Store or Switch versions.
---
bc she requires a special play style to play rather than just hit chase hook next like trapper but unlike trapper who can win with stupid luck, plague is either with a good build fucking OP or with a meh build a shitty M1 killer.
---
I like to play Plague sometimes but I know when I play her without the mid game win condition that I just need to do my best in loops sure they are 1 hit away from being downed but good survivors play safer and it usually works
---
If they didn't make surv easier then they should because I am in no way a red rank player yet here I am red rank.
---
I agree the MM is kinda shitty but at the same time more players = the more they can spread people out without queue times being harshly affected.
---
I am haven't touched too much killer but so far I've felt like it was harder.
---
I'm the same man. I love serious games as the next man but matchmaking is so whack atm that you get all types including rank15+
---
That‚Äôs what the content store is for, if they ever do add him
---
You're gonna get hate for it, but I agree. Had a killer message the survivors to farm, and when I declined es he disconnected from the game. Wasted everyone's time because we didn't want to help him complete his archive challenge.
---
Toxic*
---
Its like legion, but better
---
It's on the Microsoft store, [but only for XB1(https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/p/dead-by-daylight-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-chapter/c016hjpptw16?rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab). I don't want to risk my money for that.
---
You spelled Badham wrong
---
No thank you, I like being able to juke.
---
Why not?
---
holy shit, im mad FOR that pig
---
‚ÄúAfter using feral frenzy the legion can use dead hard to catch up to survivors‚Äù
---
I already get hate but I am here to que for a fucking normal survivor game or even killer game at least as a killer I can end the game as survivor I have to hope the killer is gonna get mad at me for not farming and kill me or play the game normally OH HOW FUN WAITING JUST TO NOT PLAY THE GAME MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

Trees improve water quality by slowing and filtering rain water, as well as protecting aquifers and watersheds.
---
I'd love to see a compilation of your after-game chats.
---
As I said you can't seriously compare yellow ranks against potato red ranks and queues were fine for me whenever I played you clearly have your PoV I already stated mine take care
---
That's what I was hoping, that the killer would play a nor al match if we declined, but he disconnected to find other survivors who would help him.
---
Omg. Feng a Leng. I'm sorry. 2 die and 2 live. Default skins get higher priority, sorry.
---
I barely play enough survivor to be high rank so I stay in rank 15 and usually I am stuck there bc I have to deal with shitty team mates which is why I don't want more noobies that can't learn

Licensing issues. Recently rights for NoES in the USA reverted back to Wes Craven's estate, while the international rights are still owned by someone else.

Or something like that.

I honestly do not know why people care so much.  Free karma?  Want to be part of the "cool club"?  Only reasons I can think of to be honest.
---
That was perfect english, negative nancy. 
---
Let me rephrase it for a proper smooth brain. 
---
The Person was referring to the already existing Hex:ruin perk. It wasn't designed to be like overcharge.
---
In fact it was supposed to be exactly like said Hex:Ruins but instead of just giving you a normal repairing speed, a great skillcheck would give you a higher benefit. 
---
See it as literally said Hex:Ruin but with added Gen speed benefits.
---
"-normie memes"  
---
Reddit post. You wut
---
Only gotta find him once.
---
For rank 1, generally something along the lines of Sprint Burst (or preferred exhaustion perk), Iron will, Unbreakable or Adrenaline, DS. Often replacing one with Borrowed time so I can hook tech
---
If he goes down then the timer stops, and hooking him would have taken even more time, letting him die to the trap right there would have turned the game into a 3v1, a huge advantage to the killer. (Also it seems she left him because she assumed he would have died before he got to the correct box)
---
spent a lot of time on it
---
Super cute! I'm weirdly still holding out for survivor Rin.
---
Niceu! I managed to snag one for 1200, also down from 2000, on Amazon C: Worth every penny here as well.
---
Pewdiepie did that once and he still hasnt recovered from the backlash. And atleast he owned up to it and apologized unlike Alinity...
---
Also you should respect the fact that there are actually non native english speakers out there. The world doesn't revolve around america
---
I‚Äôm gonna quickly bang out time 4 to get the charm then I‚Äôm going back and completing all the challenges I skipped from tome 3/finish off tome 4. 
---
I hope to god I can go from 36 to 70 over this week I have off work. =w=
---
You're right it is a game and you should be punished for choosing to shit all over the other 4 peoples game by yeeting away because you didn't like something.
---
No, it's running like overcharge, not ruin. Overcharge is when hooking someone, the next gen hit gains a tremendously hard skill check. 
---
 This new perk requires the generator to also be kicked, and also gains a tremendously hard skill check. The only difference is that overcharge doesn't grant gen progression and this one does.
---
Yep. DS generally triggers people even more.
---
I‚Äôm sure there are some dumbasses who think that. I‚Äôve hd somebody tell me that Myers is OP, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised in the slightest if somebody thinks Bubba is OP.
---
Only problem with that is Plague is insanely good when she does get her power, like a hybrid of Clown and Huntress. Having that tracking ability as basekit will completely throw off her balance. She needs a secondary power to help her in chase imo.
---
Why are killer mains are always this psychotic, and act like drama queen? 
---
How would seven year old even play this game?
---
Yet Jason has used a harpoon gun
---
And on those days you deserve to be punished. No one should get a free pass to be a douche just because "its one of those days"
---
Mmm yes MYC hag op, or maybe just don't trigger her damn traps by running in like a dumbass?
---
Exactly what I'm saying. Hit a great skillcheck get benefits.
---
My add-on was meant to be an interpretation if what a good version of this Perk could be like.
---
As I see "good start" as more of a beginnings thing.
---
Then again. It would be the same as Brand nee Parts.
---
And downing/hooking could have placed him even farther from a box, guaranteeing his death, rather than hoping he doesn't make it to the next box. Idk mate, the killer didn't seem like she was hoping he would die, more like she didn't want to keep tunneling a single survivor.
---
I never thought of this but now that you mention it I agree
---
I have it on low and it doesn't look like that
---
Thank you doctor for doing such kind thing
---
I think he got it from Leslie Jones.
---
Like with literally every other game ninja "tries out" the only ones that will keep playing are the ones already playing / that enjoy it. The rest are just gonna keep following him around to whatever game he swaps to after he rage quits.
---
Ah yees, TydeTyme...I wish he would go back to liking Dead by Daylight but Last Year has him now.
---
This is the OC that I love to see in my feed! This is getting saved
---
No shit sherlock, but if you're going to "correct" someone, then you should use proper grammar so you are able to be understood by the person whom you are trying to correct.
---
That is why I said almost.
---
I just got the plague last night, I think she's very fun to play, suits my play style well. I haven't had a bad game with her so far, but as survivor I don't see her very often either. When she first came out there was a lot of them, but I think people gave up on her because people opted out of cleansing.
---
They should make the chances of getting the trap off on the 1st or 2nd box extremely low and like a 40% chance for the 3rd with the stock timer a bit shorter. She only gets 5 traps at most per match so they need to really be putting pressure on survivors to get them off.
---
Suspense at it's finest LMAO!
---
It still counts if you just contribute a little bit, right? As long as the generator doesn‚Äôt fully regress to zero?
---
The way to beat this is to spread out your progress as much as possible. Do five percent on a generator then find another generator and do five percent on that one. Start working for real once you‚Äôve worked on five different generators. Go back and check on your generators once generators start popping. Hopefully the killer won‚Äôt bother damaging ones that are barely started. 
---
Ye gods, fuck these challenges. This isn‚Äôt promoting new play styles it‚Äôs just goading people to find the best way to game the system.
---
I don‚Äôt even feel satisfied juking him in power around loops because you literally just make sure that you make sharp turns around the loop if he goes for dash and run the loop normally if he doesn‚Äôt go for dash. Considering that he gets looped normally when he doesn‚Äôt power, makes the killer‚Äôs design less interesting imo.
---
Nice.
---
As the op stated, this perk does t run like ruin. The skillcheck that this perk brings is the same one stated in the killer perk "Overcharged" . And as I said, the only difference between the two perks is that this perk as a small amount of gen progression for hitting it, and overcharged doesn't. So its literally just a clone of overcharge with a slight variation.
---
Bedham isn't that bad.
---
i play stretched res, idk if that may have an effect on it
---
I don‚Äôt know how good your friends are but Freddy is the furthest away from being a trash killer.  He can be so lethal with his ability to traverse the map quickly as well as completely negate pallets. 
---
If you want to watch someone completely dominate with Freddy almost every game then go check out Fungoose‚Äôs YouTube. He‚Äôs also an educational streamer that has a 100+ win streak on the plague. He‚Äôs a super cool guy too!
---
he carries around a baseball bat and instadowns anyone he finds inside them
---
Man you bring out some wise words for someone that records their videos with their phone. LULW.
---
I corrected you mainly because all you did was using negative input to completely butter down someones creativity.
---
If you want to be a smartass use your intelligence for some bright input that can help the person to improve their ideas. 
---
We're all stuck in this world and for that matter in Dead by Daylight.
---
Instead if being negative. How about you bring pros and cons to help the perso improve their entire character.
---
Use your intelligence to bring others up not to knock them down.
---
I like this a lot. DBD needs a native survivor.
---
You spelled Badham wrong... again.
---
Freddy trash?
---
He is actually very good now.
---
Who said DH can‚Äôt be used for distance? The only use for DH is distance making so the killer can‚Äôt either hit you  or you make distance to get away from killer
---
I said at the top that was just my input of improving what OP had planned first
---
I recorded it with my phone because my playstation records my friends and I talking. Nice to see you stalking my profile page. 
---
 I critiqued his skills as most people do. It's not a good perk, its lazy writing to steal another perks abilities, add a small change to it, and call it a new perk.
---
Bubba is a very weak killer unless you use a combination of perks like PWYF and Nemesis. Then he can be pretty hard to stop especially if people don‚Äôt expect it.
---
Sadly.
---
Really, cause it looks like you said op was referring to the perk hex:ruin, not that you were meaning it should work like the perk hex ruin.
---
My friends are pretty trash lol and they've had the game longer than me. They're both rank 20 or 19 and scream like little girls whenever the killer chases them and they're guys who are old enough to drive lmao. So I could very much see them being wrong about Freddy, especially since I've never watched any gameplay from him. 
---
But I'm still mad that legion isn't a killer who can disguise himself as a survivor, so I'm gonna call him trash.
---
Killer is waiting next to the to him searching the box to see if he gets it off, if op got it off they would have downed and hooked, the RBT was so close to getting off that if op didn't have DH (even though they went into a wall) the RBT would have killed them, hence the reason piggy left op
---
You don't  know OP and you don't  know their thoughts behind the perk.
---
Never judge a book by its cover.
---
Its hard to pull complete new ideas out of  your butt. 
---
Negativity doesn't bring improvement but kills Ideas and sparking talents
---
Did he use to suck?
---
Never in any part of this post did they say that it was the other players fault for them dying. The whole point of the post is that they were annoyed at the fact that it seemed as if this other player was messing everything up on purpose. They were doing fine being stealthy and then the other person came along and messed it up for them.
---
... I'm going to need a dark mode friendly version of this. I can only read the purple and gold running for an hour part
---
As said. Terrible grammar skills I'm not a native english speaker. Im getting help right now as well as for most of the input I bring on reddit
---
I mean it's like a tree falling in the woods but for dbd, if the survivor teabags in the match but the killer isn't there to see it is it toxic?
---
pig bc boops tbh
---
considered maining other killers, ran wraith for a while, thought about legion for a bit, but when I found out about snoot boops, that‚Äôs all she wrote
---
Yes, you can buy the licensed killers with auric cells. Stop feeding people false information.
---
Connor Kenway!
---
You might also notice that I have no clue how the reply system here works LOL
---
He's said a racial sour on stream twice, not to mention all the other shit he's done. When he took back his charitable donation to the ADL, he made a video about it while wearing an iron cross. He's a neo-Nazi asshole.
---
Myreply is the thing I just posted :'I
---
I mean I don't see it being an issue , making it basekit would serve the purpose of providing an incentive to cleanse. And honestly not much would change from the way she currently is anyways. 
---
If you play enough games you can afford to just burn through blood web and ALWAYS play with that addon anyways. All keeping it addon dependant does is hurt the experience of newer players who haven't been playing long enough to amass enough of an addon stockpile.

Yup, altough as far as I remember there is a movie poster where he is seen with one, I just don't remember where that is from.
---
Sounds good clearly an entitled lobby Dodger.  Probably do the same thing in your killer games too.  Take care.
---
Most of the survivors don't play in teams, and even less play with mics. Most of the playerbase is solo.
---
Imo it's solo survivor &gt; Killer &gt; 3 man &gt; 4 man in terms of difficulty.
---
Bubba is one of those Killers that has a very specific build combo that works very well with him (PWYF and Nemesis) and other than that he's garbage.
---
Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful!
---
Never judge a book by its cover? Coming from the guy judging someone for recording with their phone? Hypocrite much?
---
 And positivity only doesn't induce character growth, or even allow someone to learn from their mistakes. You can clap op on the back and tell them what a great job they did. I'll let op know that the perk is much to close to another perk the game already has. Only one of those actually helps op learn to make better and better perks.
---
I feel like BHVR does this to go hand and hand with the solidarity of the game. Just like the zero communication unless you are in a party. The initial feel was to be on your own and not know who‚Äôs doing what, and if they are two Claudette‚Äôs you may not know who is who.
---
Lmaoooo
---
Oh man, well played! Were you screaming while running after that hook escape? If not, no worries. I screamed for you.
---
Me with Shadowborn lol
---
Vsauce
---
I looked and he gets like 600 viewers max when he streams dbd. I highly doubt BHVR is going to change anything based on ninja thinking it's OP.
---
You didn't start talking about your version of the perk till what, the third reply? So I'm confused where this conversation is about your version of how the perk should work.
---
Oh hey post number 1064 of the joke of a totem being cleansed but is haunted grounds.

Well I am rank 4 was 3 and only took me 45 hours?  Who says new players cannot learn?  Isn't that rather close minded?  I mainly played soloq sometimes with 1 friend wo has roughly same hours as me.  Maybe teammates are not the issue?

Every toxic nea's dream

what do u wanna get into quick?

That's hilarious.
---
That wasnt an iron cross. He debunked it himself and he was accused of the same shit a while ago. Also he took back his donation to the ADL because his followers told him not to and give it to a better group that they would choose. Also, he said that his donation to the ADL was because he needed to choose a group to donate to because he was going on his honeymoon iirc. Also he said the nword once on stream and quickly apologized for it and took the blame too. Don't know where's the second one coming from if you could link it it would be great :)
---
Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
---
This editing gave me aids
---
Yep, he was terrible. He only just received a rework not long ago.
---
Yea but if you had sprint burst you wouldn't even have to worry about not having time.
---
also no one said that, thats literally the only effective way to use DH
---
it's because lorewise, the tombstones are Myers disobeying the Entity and killing the survivors for his own pleasure and not the Entity. It's also why in general Mori's get you less points for a pip.
---
The ghost of hawkins lab
---
I find it easiest to think of the Killers in the type of style they play:
---
**Trap Killers**
---
* The Trapper - His traps immobilize, but they can be disarmed/destroyed
---
* The Hag - Her traps are much harder to see, and they allow her to teleport to the trap location. They can be destroyed with a flashlight.
---
* The Nightmare - The Nightmare has two versions of "traps". The first version are those he uses in a chase - these traps slow sleeping survivors when stepped on. The second "trap" involves use of the generators, allowing The Nightmare to teleport around the map via generators. It should be noted, unlike others these traps can be used while still moving and/or in chase.
---
* The Demogorgon - It has the most limited number of "traps", but the traps cannot be seen by survivors until used. He uses these traps to teleport around the map and notify him when a survivor is near a trap. Survivors can destroy the traps, though does require a notable time investment.
---
**Insta-down Killers**
---
* The Hillbilly - He sprints across the map with his chainsaw, and instantly puts survivors into the dying state if he makes contact.
---
* The Shape - A hybrid with stealth killers, The Shape starts off fairly slow, but gains power as he cumulatively stalks survivors. After stalking for a long enough period, The Shape has the ability to insta-down survivors for ~1 minute. This process repeats until the match is over.
---
* The Cannibal - As with Hillbilly, The Cannibal (aka Bubba) uses his chainsaw to insta-down survivors; however, rather than sprinting forward, Bubba waves his chainsaw side to side - sacrificing the Hillbilly's speed boost to allow him to down multiple survivors at once. 
---
* The Ghost Face - Another hybrid stealth killer, similar to The Shape; however, The Ghost Face stalks a single survivor, allowing him to insta-down that specific survivor for ~20 seconds. It should be noted, Ghost Face has the ability to be MUCH stealthier than The Shape.
---
* The Oni - The newest killer, with many similarities to Hillbilly. The most notable difference is The Oni must gather blood (from hitting survivors) before entering his Rage mode. In Rage mode, The Oni can sprint around the map and insta-down any survivor he comes into contact with. Notable advantage for this killer - injured survivors can easily be tracked with the blood drops they leave floating in the air.
---
**Stealth Killers**
---
* The Wraith - Arguably the stealthiest killer in the game, The Wraith is mostly invisible with no terror radius. The Wraith can only be seen when he moves around by the shimmer effect of his character model.
---
* The Shape - see above
---
* The Pig - The Pig has the ability to crouch an lose her terror radius (at the cost of her field of view). This allows her to sneak up on survivors to grab them off generators or make a flying lunge attack to start the encounter. Further, she has a trap-like mechanic she uses to delay the game. Once downed, The Pig can put a trap on a survivor, and once the next generator is complete (and the survivor is off the ground/hook) a timer starts. The survivor has to run to "Puzzle Boxes" around the map to remove the trap from their head; if they fail to do this in ~3 minutes - they die.
---
* The Ghost Face - See Above.
---
**Ranged Killers**
---
* The Huntress - The Huntress throws hatches at survivors - putting them into the injured (or dying) state if they make contact. The number of hatchets carried is limited, and you must regularly go to a locker to restock.
---
* The Clown - Similar to the Huntress, The Clown throws bottles of gas at survivors; while within the gas cloud, survivors are slowed and disorientated. The number of bottles The Clown can hold at one time is limited, so he must reduce his movement speed while refilling new bottles to throw.
---
* The Plague - The Plague shoots vomit of two types. The most common type of vomit is green and can be used to spread sickness over items or put directly on survivors. This green vomit will eventually make a survivor broken, removing their ability to be healed - until the survivor cleanses them-self. After the survivor cleanses, The Plague can drink the water used in the cleansing to upgrade her vomit - making it black for ~45 seconds. This black vomit no longer spreads sickness - it inflicts damage just as a normal hit would. 
---
**The Chasers**
---
* The Nurse - The Nurse has a low movement speed, but makes up for this with the ability to teleport through objects and over long distances.
---
* The Doctor - The Doctor effectively removes the ability to survivors to stealth around the map with his madness ability. This ability is slightly complex, but the abridged version - the more time the survivor is near The Doctor, the more troublesome basic actions become - due to screams and hallucinations. Further, The Doctor's shock ability locks all survivor actions for a very brief period of time (e.g. they can't do anything but run).
---
* The Spirit - One of the most controversial killers, The Spirit has the ability to become invisible for short bursts of time. During this burst, The Spirit moves VERY quickly and is forced to track survivors via sound (mostly). Further, The Spirit has a passive ability to "phase" for brief moments when not using her power - making it extremely difficult to tell what she is doing.
---
* The Legion - The Legion is actually multiple people (hints the name), and their power is Feral Frenzy. The simplest way to explain this is The Legion goes berserk and starts sprinting around stabbing survivors; these stabs cause the survivors to bleed and will cause them to enter the dying state if the survivor is not mended; hitting a survivor with one of these bleeding attacks extends the frenzy and allows you to run after the next survivor. It should be noted, any survivor in The Legion's terror radius while in frenzy will give a constant heartbeat location of the survivor. This sounds good on paper, but it is largely considered the weakest killer power in the game.

Killer

Newest killer: M E G

Gen rushing is when the killer fails to apply pressure to the gens due to being looped, and then blames the survivors for his own failure.

---
Sorry about the spelling my auto correct kicked in.
---
Actually, keep ruin and leave DS. Game's hard enough for killers as it is.
---
It was just one guy, though, at least from what I saw. It kinda threw me off
---
We dont need anymore characters, period.
---
too spooky for me!
---
Recommended build: Kindred, Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, We'll Make It
---
With Kindred you'll be able to see if the killer is coming your way, if he does use sprint burst to gain distance.  You want to sprint towards a large structure with a window.  If the killer is following you, try to put as much of the structure between you and the killer.
---
If the killer isn't coming towards you, then you need to read the situation.  Should you finish your generator, do you need to go for the save,  maybe you need to take the hit for the survivor that the killer is going towards (might be needed if that survivor is on death hook and you're not).  If you do go for the save, We'll Make It will allow you to heal them quickly.  And adrenaline is your ace in the hole.  Once the generators are nearing completion the killer will be more likely to slug, to try to pressure the board.  This will get you up off the ground if you're slugged, it will heal you if you're hurt, and you'll get a nice speed boost.  You're number 1 priority when adrenaline is first look for a noed totem and 2 identify where the killer is and go to the other door.
---
Nothing about new charracters was said.l of course that would be nice. But id rather take some reworks etc. i dont see why you wouldnt want more charracters.
---
I'm fairly certain you have to be on the gen when it pops for it to count. Anything else is irrelevant.
---
Thanks so much for taking the time to write all this! I‚Äôll definitely take into consideration everything you said :)
---
Yes, because every map in a realm is an exact replica of each other. 
---
Especially Mother‚Äôs swelling and temple of purgation. Those maps are spot on replicas if each other
---
Ah yes. The classic blunder
---
Because we got more than enough perks? Abd adding even more (specially at this pace) will get the game stall, with no more ideas?
---
Is that a insult or a compliment/ joke
---
I still dont understand you. Ehh.. opinions.
---
Your survivors get more toxic as you go lower?
---
I've usually had the opposite experiences
---
i mean we need more low rank survivors, on all platforms i assume. some of them are probably gonna be asshats, but it's not like we can stop it at this point. he's playing the game and fans are gonna pick it up, gatekeeping will just justify shitty behaviour in their eyes. i was an asshole when i was a kid, but the easiest way to shut me down was to just not engage
---
maybe i'm just too nice, but i'd rather be welcoming and helpful and get proven wrong than participate in a vicious cycle of toxicity.
---
Have you got a YouTube channel I can sub to? That‚Äôs was pure gold
---
Did a gen, looked for ruin couldn't find it so I went to save my teammate. Got downed put in basement, farmed, basement again and then saved and clip happens. I didn't do well on my part but if that hit doesn't happen I have a chance to pip up.
---
There are too many plagues in ranks under 10, same with Michaels and Clowns. Honestly these are my 3 most hated killers not because they're op but because they're annoying as shit to play against. Plague makes you puke, Michael gets fed his EW and clowns blurs your vision and makes you scream. Fuck that
---
It's so amazing. They run to a pallet in the time you would have healed them. So dam stupid
---
https://youtu.be/i3p3SYV9DwY
---
UwU notices bulge
---
Oh
---
Seeing bad players think survivors are weaker than killers is always funny.
---
I even pressed "leave game" not just close application. You can never please some people
---
For Map pressure With the crouchy dudes I'd say the key  is to not stick to a chase if it's going on too long. Just leave, preferably with them injured, and patrol gens. That's the only way to build up map pressure.
---
The fun thing with ghost face is I find there are diffrent ways and strategies to use with him. I dont want to get super into it cause I dont know what I'm talking. But basically, I'd expirement with maps (indoor maps are op on stealth killers) and play around with him. You can use your power mid chase for mind games (no red stain) and gen grabs. I find being undetectable trumps his stalking ability. There are so many fun ways to use his power. Maybe check out some guides? I dont find either of those killers to be easy by any means. It took me a while to get a handle on how to play ghost face and I certainly dont rely on marking survivors. I only do it when its convenient or mid chase if I can. I'd keep trying to figure them out because Ghosty boy is quite strong in my opinion. Pig is pretty mid-tier but like all killers she can be good in the right hands.
---
Idk maybe this will help
---
Love the Doctor one. Also Spirit's remind me of the Irelia nerf in LoL, -5 movement speed should balance her out
---
I like how it just looks like  
---
Pig: "Micheal......what are you doing?"
---
Micheal: "Um...oink?"
---
I don't wanna level Bubba tho :P
---
The point of challenges are the rewards. If the game itself isn‚Äôt enough to keep you engaged so much so that arbitrarily difficult tasks are what you need, you‚Äôre probably better off doing something else with your time.
---
Thanks alot, yeah ghostface is looking hella fun and good. The gen grabs do work sometimes but arent reliable.
---
If that's what you get from my post, not sure what to say.
---
Holy crap, this sounds like it takes forever to learn and understand. Thank you so much for taking the time to put in the detail and explanations for each killer. I really appreciate it! :)
---
Please no just no.
---
Your anecdotes aren't similar to mine.
---
Posting here for tomorrow morning.
---
Far too tired to actually give advice, but don't want to forget about it and not be able to give tips.
---
2000 IQ logic right there.
---
I just need to unlock Jane and level her thicc ass up to unlock the last perks for my P3 Claudette.
---
Yeah they're broken from what I hear
---
I get told I'm tunneling and camping (less camping but a lot of tunnel) since I go for the injured person/the one that doesnt go to a pallet first. If you play dumb I'll down you and hook you back up because I'm not losing free pressure. If you repeat the same mistakes 3x and die for it its your damn fault not mine
---
I'd almost say Cultural Exchange would need a few extra seconds like 20/30/40. Not sure how you make use of any perk in a short time but regardless I like them all.
---
Nice get that head on! Claudette was my second P3 survivor with all T3 perks.
---
I've jumped back in after last playing on nurse release and man I have spent days trying to work out how to get that perk to activate, so much has changed..
---
Not that I don‚Äôt agree but I just know he wouldn‚Äôt play it. He‚Äôs pretty much built a career on playing Fortnite like every other millennial that couldn‚Äôt find a real job.
---
I was wrong about that second slur, I admit fault on that.
---
He was in fact wearing an iron cross. You can watch the video and see it with your own eyes. That bullshit about it not really being an iron cross is dumb, I'm not taking a Twitter PDP stan's word lol.
---
Bottom line, if you defend PDP you defend alt-right racism.
---
Asparagus is a member of the lily family, which also includes onions, leeks, and garlic, but asparagus has a unique mild flavor, nothing like the flavor of its onion cousins.
---
The "Iron Cross" is an ornament at the Bolnisi Sioni church in Georgia and literally means "Lord have mercy on us". Try better.
---
It would be weird to see a map in the lobby considering you can change maps with offerings.
---

as gretchen wieners said best, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt sit with us!‚Äù
---
Thanks for being honest
---
Nibba lamp. Trust me
---
Level up bill or don‚Äôt prestige, BT is too good
---
I know, I don't want to, and I haven't on a single challenge.  I'm level 8, and I don't play the style that is a swinging dick looper.  Thanks for the constructive replies, I'll try the baiting
---
looks great! good work! hopefully you enjoyed it and will keep it up!
---
I only play on Switch and it is fine. Killer can take a bit to find a match, but that is every platform. I can get into one in somehwere between 5-30 mins sometimes quick sometimes a little longer. Survivor takes no longer than 5 mins to find a match.
---
The game is a bit uglier on Switch, but it holds a pretty dang solid 30fps handheld which is how I almost always play. I would recommend it if you are considering it!
---
&gt;Clearly you dont know how to have a discussion. 
---
I dared disagree with you by citing my position so I clearly don't know how to have a discussion.  Got ya.
---
&gt; I'm not going to keep replying if your going to act like a fucking bitch the entire time.  
---
Bye Felicia.  
---
&gt; If my original post was insulting to you then you really need to get off the internet man..whatever I'll give it one more shot. 
---
I'll give it one more shot after calling you several names.  Oh thank you.  I feel blessed.
---
&gt; A high school team vsing pros would be like a literal first time player vs a rank 1. 
---
No, that'd be like a 5 year old with his first basketball but your ability to think critically is obviously deficient.  
---
&gt; We all get annoyed by teabagging and flashlight spam. If you cant get over it, that's your problem. 
---
So, I can't voice my annoyance?  Um, OK.  
---
&gt; And I stand by my final point. It's a garbage argument and you havent said otherwise so yeah. 
---
What you‚Äôve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
Bullshit lol you're fucking dumb. He wore an iron cross while taking his donation away from a Jewish organization. Oops, another heated gamer moment!
---
Open your mouth wide for another hot slice of bullshit from Papa Pewds
---
It‚Äôs situational in my opinion. If the killer is hard camping, yeah it can be worth it. But if the killer is kinda far but you still get a heartbeat, there‚Äôs a good chance that BT will run out by the time the killer smacks the person you unhooked. I suggest getting borrowed time from the shrine because it‚Äôs there right now, save up BP, then prestige
---
Pig and Plague
---
Pig and Freddy
---
would be unstoppable
---
There are georgian letters on the collar of the shirt though lol
---
Same I like Kate I also kinda like playing as you and frng for some reason
---
Judging by the comments that explain how this idea for a perk would work... eh, don‚Äôt see it being used to be honest.
---
Nope.
---
alright thanks
---
Sure buddy :D
---
Eh, I‚Äôm not too big a fan. That‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm too tired to think about how it would work in game though, so that‚Äôs ok.
---
No one said that but ok
---
Borrowed Time is in the shrine right now if you have the shards.
---
80% of the time BT is used, it's when the killer is really close by, so he will either smack the person unhooked or go for you, either way you saved a guy. Unless it's Leatherface, then you will both die
---
I would straight up have a heart attack
---
As soon as I hear you tier up once I‚Äôm playing it safe lol
---
There will be a new rift after this one has ended.
---
The new rift will contain DIFFERENT things than the current one.
---
So what you don't get now, you won't get in the future.
---
But it's not a big thing if you don't reach max level before rift closes.
---
Might be due to how matches are much more personal than the usual 12-8 man matches in other games, thus the encounters with rude people have much higher chances of occurring.
---
"The¬†Bolnisi cross¬†(·Éë·Éù·Éö·Éú·Éò·É°·Éò·É° ·ÉØ·Éï·Éê·É†·Éò bolnisis «∞vari) is a¬†cross¬†symbol, taken from a 5th-century ornament at the¬†Bolnisi¬†Sioni church, which came to be used as a national symbol of Georgia. It is a variant of the¬†Cross¬†patt√©e popular in Christian symbolism of late antiquity and the early medieval period." The letters are on the collar of his shirt and is supposedly designed by Demna Gvasalia "The shirt is thought to be designed by Georgian designer Demna Gvasalia, with the symbol being a Bolnisi Cross, a national symbol of Georgia." Atleast give arguments to your side. It'd be nice having a good argument for once instead of just "haha pewds bad media good"
---
I agree. Increase gate distance.
---
Also if I was the entity I would be laughing my ass off
---
Not on all maps but there are a few where they are right next to each other and it‚Äôs ridiculous
---
Just a quick mention the name could be changed, as we already have a huntress. Nothing else to add, just thought it might be worth mentioning.
---
You're piling a heaping helping of pure bullshit on my plate, and I'm not interested. There is no reason he would wear something like that. It was an iron cross, he needed an alibi, he got one, you all drank the kool-aid.
---
Done here. Good night!
---
So you turn into Godzilla. That's not too bad.
---
May I join the fun? Casual gamer here but just want to PLAY when I can! Still learning but learning quickly!
---
Ah my apologies, I meant increase the gate distance by removing the chance of them spawning extremely close by.

Unrelated note, I‚Äôm a little bored so I‚Äôm traveling through some 20+day old posts that are under ‚Äúconcept‚Äù when I searched.
---
Dwight has filled this role well recently.
---
I thought they said all cosmetics will be made available after multiple rifts after they close?
---
He didn't say it, he had to apologize after. He wore it quite often too but you would rather say that someone is a nazi because he's a public figure and you hate him because he makes a living out of video games. You're one of the people that promote cancel culture, one of the most disgusting things ever. Or you're baiting me and I'd rather it being that than being this moronic and not able to change their own views when presented by proof.
---
Yall got any body pillows in stock? Asking for a friend....
---
you must certainly may! Sent you a message!
---
Michael is that one killer who actually scares many people and is the most basic on this game.
---
Sounds like a good trade off.
---
Lol it‚Äôs fine but it‚Äôs ridiculous with endgame lol
---
Here's a reply-minder
---
honestly tho. truer words have never been spoken
---
I'm asking what the issue on my end could be. I don't get this issue in any other game, only dead by daylight and only in those two circumstances.
---
Im a ruthless Killer because of these challenges lol.
---
If you have a type 3 NAT then that‚Äôs your internet svc provider. Some many isp company‚Äôs in the USA are such dog shit and fall so behind on the rest of the world for Internet. It will be 2040 and isp will still be trash charging high prices.
---
Why are you stepping on trash? Not very hygenic of you.
---
Invite
---
I thinks its just that people remember the toxic chats rather than the majority boring ggs every game.
---
You are a genius. plain and simple
---
I would love if we could place down our owm hex totem honestly. This seems dumb as it would make pallet respecting "good" and would make looping a lot easier
---
I really like her rift hair but I sadly can't get it due to school fucking me over. At least I get the shirt and pants.
---
there's a serious learning curve to playing her well, which might stop a lot of people playing her
---
also, she's gross. i love her but i can imagine it's real off-putting
---
Oh my goodness haha &lt;3
---
Might wanna block the names as its against the rules
---
The devs are the devs. They decide what is fair, NOT the players. I don‚Äôt always agree with them either, but accept it because I‚Äôm not a dev. Get used to it kid. Welcome to DBD.
---
Great minds think alike I guess. I think it would be cool. Maybe far from meta but cool
---
Truly heartwarming
---
Yeah the legion did not live up to the hype of its trailer.
---
Great movie. Billy Madison's a classic.
---
Detective tapp dat ass‚Äô
---
No such things as jokes these days. As a minoirty but not a jew i admit some of pewds content is pre funny and i dont consider him to be racist.
---
yep that seems fair, 4 survivors voting for haddonfield vs one killer voting for Coal tower.
---
i see nothing wrong with this logic
---
‚ÄúThe only effective way to use DH‚Äù Uhh dodging attacks and getting to pallets. Distance is not the only use of DH.
---
Huntress &amp; Myers and Wrath &amp; Spirit have been going at it for a bit now
---
Just a bunch of sperm cells on a laptop.
---
Unsurprisingly\*
---
I've heard so many horrible things about laggy skill checks on console. With all of that on top of the doctors bullshit is honestly just abusive.
---
As you said people would DC in the lobby, upping queue times even more. Players would take the most broken shit on certain maps because they know it works well. Offerings would be ran everytime to get another map and fuck up the killer/survivors with their build. No one would take Nurse on a L√©ry either so you would only see 2-3 killers per map (no billy, nurse, hag for indoor maps). It would be ridiculously dumb
---
You're making a lot of assumptions there buddy. I love AutoHaven. Some of my friends hate it, and love Coldwind Farm. Some hate that but love Yamaoka. Considering what OP said, voting is the fairest way to go about it.
---
Thanata, Pop, Dying light, Ruin is a combo i tend to enjoy on plague, also switching out pop for spies from the shadow, because im terrible and lose people all the time
---
I really loved this, it makes me happy as a killer main/survivor off who always gets ‚Äútold how to to play‚Äù by survivors. Like just  shut up and let me play my off meta and different ways, if you can do it in the game it‚Äôs a strat, and if you fall for it that‚Äôs your fault.
---
Thana, ruin/corrupt, pop, bbq/whispers. Puke on everyone once to get them tagged then chase.  Thana Corrupt Infectious and BBQ work very well too with your power
---
The maps are way 2 different in terms of balance to have this.
---
See you can do this in a game like COD since for the most part everyone is on the same lvl of lethality as they would be on other maps.
---
But with DBD there is so much shit to factor in with this, for example.
---
Map offerings
---
Killers power making them MUCH stronger/weaker depending on the map (e.x GF on Hawkins vs GF on Blood lodge)
---
Maps being either killer or survivor sided.
---
Dodging lobbys due to having a shit map
---
Not having enough time to edit a whole build by the time you see what map it is 
---
ect
---
Jesus every survivor perk is toxic these days.
---
Loool
---
The problem i can see with this is that certain builds are stupidly op on certain maps, both for killer and survivor, so if you could see it ahead of time you could just switch to whatever build is op for that map
---
Thanks
---
Happy to help! If you're trying to find a "main" killer, I'd nudge you towards eithe The Shape, The Hag, or The Nurse. 
---
All three are really powerful and good to start with. The Shape has the insta-down and stealth, making his learning curve much more gradual. The Hag is slightly more complex, but her mobility and certain builds make her crazy strong. The Nurse... is just broken. You'll be absolute garbage with her - until one day you're not. On that day, you just kill everyone without trying.
---
Hey, it's 2019
---
WAAAAAH THE QUEUES ARE TOO LONG!  WAAAAH THE INFLUX IF NEW PLAYERS DONT PLAY LIKE VETERANS WAAAAAHHHH CRRRYYY CRRRRYYYYYY
---
Agreed couldn‚Äôt get pass 1min
---
Well if there were 3 survivor left then 1 gen needs to be left
---
I fuck with iron will over self care erry damn day. Cause yeah sc is so gd slow
---
the way hatch works is you need to complete 1 gen more then there are survivors left for it to spawn, so if there is 2 survivors you need to have done 3 gens, 3 survivors its 4 gens, and 4 survivors its all 5 gens
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be a repost considered I made the meme last night with meme maker haha.
---
I loooove that hahahah
---
and mettle of man still bothers you?
---
No, they would need to remake everything with a new graphic engine and shit like that. Would take a while and don't think its their main focus
---
Everybody gangsta until the kid start looping around the house dropping shit and them start t-baggin
---
Yep in the same boat, took me a good couple weeks to grind for her hair. All worth it in the end
---
Who would the killer be though? Would it be one of the family members? Just asking, but who would it be?
---
In Part V Roy gets attacked with a chainsaw in a barn. That kiiiiinda counts right?
---
(For those unaware, Roy was the Killer of that film).
---
Insidious bubba isnt op. Annoying as fuck? Hell yeah. OP? Far from it. Stop being so altruistic and just stick to gens if you don't hear a heartbeat anywhere and no one got hurt/chased if obsession if you KNOW its a LF. It sucks but thats how you play against that. If you're in comms its a lot easier though
---
I'm fortunate since I main survivor (rank 4) and my killer is brown ranks. Steamrolled them on that challenge, and honestly felt bad about it since they're so new.
---
And barbed wire.
---
Someone told me that Bubba is OP and I should kill myself for it, that an instadown is "too strong". I'm rank 7 so I wasnt expecting a dumbass to say that. I prob got the screenshot somewhere
---
I find it‚Äôs more of a method to seek people who are hatch hunting or going to unhook others during the endgame collapse. Altruism should come with some risk imo.
---
Ninjas a fucking idiot when it comes to this game. Like i saw one of his vids today for dbd called baiting freddy kreuger where he hides in the corner if a doorway freddy comes around the front of the house(ninja currently at the back door) and complains how freddy found him it‚Äôs fucking great how dumb he is.
---
Is pop tier 1 still worth the slot?
---
I like the idea of Jason using the tools and environment around him to get survivors. IMO, hes one of the more *resourceful* killers, and that should be portrayed in his powers.
---
You imagine how fucking terrifying it would be to see Huntress using Feral Frenzy?
---
I would love to get BBQ but she's level 44 and still hasn't gotten it, I'll have to prestige and hope for the best
---
Dude, he uploaded another one today. The killer used Barbeque and Chili to find him, *and Ninja said he was stream sniping*
---
It would be awesome if he could use the environment against survivors or even get temporary pick ups that change up his playstyle in a way
---
The huntress agrees with this post ü§≠
---
Oh interesting. Glad I got it done then
---
NANI!!!
---
No need to prestige for it, and you even get 3-4 perks per bloodweb with 2 obtainable at lvl 50, making the grind a little less hard. If you want to prestige her you should stock up on atleast 1M bloodpoints for lvl 40 again (if you use the bloodpoints right)
---
It‚Äôs the fornite man it‚Äôs autism radiates onto the players and never goes away
---
You can. Theres a difference between auric cells and iridescent shards
---
DBd is far from balanced and a single objective makes it mind numbingly boring for survivor.
---
Auric cells arent iridescent shards. You can buy him with auric cells. I did it and I have him but not Quentin for the 500 cells
---
It's normal for things like this happens to me lol, luckily i'm a very patient person and don't give a shit of what others talk to me unless it's a constructive criticism
---
I was gonna p3 before I started going past the first 50 web because it seemed like a waste of points if I wanted to get the bloody cosmetics.
---
I'll definitely save up 1mil though, I can easily make that up that with my hag
---
Feels bad üò≠
---
He's trolling or he's a poser. If you're a Metalhead and don't play Dead By Daylight or at least know what it is. Something is wrong. Or he probably likes garbage like Disturbed, Five Finger Deathpunch and Linkin Park and thinks that's "metal".
---
Getting prestiged isnt too important, you just want your baseline perks to farm your points. If you really want P3 before leveling her seriously and getting her perks playing hag will definitely give you a lot of bloodpoints for it. Honestly think that prestige is more of a "I have nothing else to do" thing. Except P1. P1 for a bloody weapon is cool since you see it often imo
---
I have no counter-argument, therefore I will back myself up with the last bit of dignity I still have left : ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
You realise Ninja is like 27 or 28 right?  He isn't a millenial.  content creation IS a real job.  He was already popular before Fortnite he wasn't a nobody he just played other BRs like H1Z1, PUBg etc.  That being said he wasn't more widely known until fortnite yes.
---
Right, so what's stopping people from just voting for the most survivor sided maps in the game? You and you're friends mean nothing when there are people out there that would easily abuse this.
---
Why even let the killer vote? They will never get the map they want unless the survivors have already voted for that
---
exactly I want more traffic in this game.  The peop,e trying to gatekeep are just honestly...assholes pretending that they aren't toxic themselves I'd say for most.
---
You should have shown the chat after!
---
Well borrowed time is in the shine of secrets right now so you can get it for 2000 iridescent shards and get it as a teachable for everyone again.
---
Dodging attacks is inconsistent, please tell me how many times you have heard "I PRESSED E" or "IM EXHAUSTED ON THE FLOOR" from your friends?
---
Also "and getting to pallets"... So distance?
---
How do you hide the sound/music that he makes when he reaches T2? Wouldn't they hear it and know that you are not AFK?
---
Yeah the way I remember is you add up the number of people alive and the number of gens left and if it‚Äôs less than or equal to 4 then hatch is spawned.
---
I hope he doesn‚Äôt kill DBD
---
He's just standing there, MENACINGLY!

I've played around 300 hours of plague at rank 1 on PC, you're going to love her snowball, if you can get the ball rolling. A big thing for any killer is getting a good start, this is crucial for her against a solid team. Perks like Discordance and Monitor and Abuse seem to be the most important perks for beating meta teams. Discordance will trigger almost instantly giving you instant direction to where they are at as soon as you get into the match. Monitor and Abuse is so good on her because it really throws people off by reducing your terror radius to 24 you will see much less distance being gained by even the most aware survivors. Players can't be stealthy against you once they are infected, that means they will be very cautious when looking out for you so they dont go down in one hit, Monitor and Abuse makes things so confusing for them. Thanatophobia is good on her but very overrated. The numbers you get for taking up a perk slot are not worth in my opinion. Reply for more info :)
---
To keep Survivors guessing?
---
That's why I do it sometimes. I want them to panic look around for Ghostface or Michael for a bit longer.
---
because people aren't already doing that now? With the offerings?  One person decides. At least this way it's more fair.
---
If it's so obvious, you should be able to put it into words, right? Instead of acting like a snide asshole?
---
Kinda sounds like he was intentionally doing that. If that happens again, I would assk them about it and then report the persom for griefing.
---
Pass the checks 4head, wow why didn't I think of that.
---
nice! that would make a cute af sticker
---
must have been a mistake bc I never said he was just about luck if you think I said that which u seem to have done you should learn to read
---
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I can help with Hag! Some youtuber called SpaceCoconut did an Hag guide with great explanation on how to play her. So, by that logic, if you know how to play her, you can counter her. Hag doesn't camp much but uses range addons. I'll always TP to a trap unless I'm next to a free kill since its more pressure. Most good hags will put a single trap infront of the hook. Start crouching at around 1 dead hard distance incase she has the trigger range addon. If she has mint rag, good luck. Most hags run MYC since it synergizes well with her power so try not to trigger a trap. For a totem, hags often run ruin and devour. They'll put their trap a bit infront of the totem but not directly so it wastes more time crouching for you and, when you break it, if you run she'll TP and if you don't she's coming (moderately, 110% speed) fast. Hope it helps a bit lol
---
I still see dumbasses doing gens at the corners of the map leavin me with a 3 gen while they hide in corners
---
Those people deserve to be banned that is truly how u fuck with the matchmaking
---
yes it is, even if it‚Äôs just tier 1 Pop will help you out so much as killer
---
There‚Äôs always risk to unhooks, it notifies the killer to the location of two survivors, there‚Äôs also make your choice and perks like it that don‚Äôt require the survivors to almost escape to activate. Noed is just a perk that rewards bad gameplay for a last chance to get kills.
---
It seems to me that more often certain killers are good on certain maps rather than specific builds. But also, is that necessarily a bad thing? Both sides can swap
---
But you're already a clown.
---
Corrupt and ruin dont go well together, if they know you have corrupt and ruin they'll go find the ruin where its blocked off and relatively safe since you wont go there to find them since its a waste of time. If its not there then it just reduces the search. I'd rather use thanatophobia or dying light. If it works for you though it works for you
---
Simple but effective. Top points for the meme
---
I'm impressed they managed to make the unreal engine look this bad.
---
Survivor ‚Äúcan‚Äù be less stressful then killer if your team isn‚Äôt a bunch of potato‚Äôs, killer main myself decided to hard commit to survivor for a rank reset got from like rank 17 to 2 and overall it was a decent experience ( I was solo ) can be heaps better with a friend
---
Thanks!
---
It‚Äôs an attempt by the devs to encourage people to have more fulfilling games. If all Killers needed to do was get a 4k they‚Äôd just slug and be done with it. Not a fun game for the survivors.
---
And if all that mattered for a survivor was escaping, then you could just hide the entire match and let everyone else die on first hook. That‚Äôs also not a fun game for anyone.
---
Just me that thinks map offerings should get removed? I am getting tired of haddonfield
---
I was just giving you a little advice to help you have fun, bud. Hex ruin doesn't do anything like the amount of harm to the playerbase as toxic whiners like you do when someone's just trying to be nice.
---
Cant tell you how many times I've accidentally dropped the pallet because people kept crawling when I tried to heal them.
---
Tbh I don't even wear the bloody cosmetics. I just hoard them because ?????
---
"Too many Billy's and Nurse's"
---
Oh how those times were taken for granted really. I myself am so exhausting seeing Freddy and Ghostface in Red Ranks and always get excited when I hear a Billy now.
---
No shit if u go too fucking fast u don't get a 2 pip which is the dumbest fucking logic like "oh sorry u did too good gonna have to dum it down a bit"
---
Cannibal/Leatherface and Hag are the most important. Plague can be great because of a perk that reduces the playing grounds for 2 minutes (the 3 furthest generators from the killer are blocked for 2 minutes. Other than that Michael's DLC is great because of decisive strike (Laurie Strode perk, stuns the killer for 5 seconds after being unhooked and lasts 60 seconds) and Michael (The Shape) is pretty friendly towards newer killers since he makes you learn the basics well whilst being strong to play as.
---
Yeah, I dont think they're really a good addition to the game

---
Omg you're awesome! I rewatched after reading your comment and it was very fun
---
I think you deserve it. Pretty fantastic if you ask me.
---
The game has a big healthy playerbase, such problems should not exist. They should either rework how ranks work and reward them properly or make the matchmaking as tight as possible.
---
At the cost of having devour up indefinitely, and I like the second idea as well.
---
I felt like this would be one of those gimmicky perks that you question why is it even in the game.
---
Like monstrous shrine
---
Can you paint the DC sign next?
---
Yeah same, got P3 on my Nurse but usually wear the Blight outfit. Same for my Doc. Poor Doc needs more blood on his cosmetics :(
---
I imagine most of them got a good laugh out of it.
---
Killer probably had bag ping
---
That would require people to even care about their rank and to add they still have mori offerings in the game and top tier killers are still hard to 2 pip with bc they are too fucking good in the 250 hours I've put in on nurse I never fucking 2 pip anymore and I don't rly care but I am not even slugging or tunneling.
---
if they wanted to " encourage people to have more fulfilling games " they'd balance the fuckin game and make the low tier killers just as good or better so we don't have this gap from Bubba fucking shit to Nurse fucking broken
---
how do you even do that kill animation?
---
So, if I were to have a full group who don't cleanse, a 16% penalty to gen repair, healing, and sabotage still isn't worth it?
---
I also figured it would be good to kind of force people's hands into cleansing.
---
I definitely need to save my shards and unlock legion, I really think discordance would be a great fit for her.
---
Oh, and thank you for the advice! &lt;3
---
I've never seen lag this bad,  and also two matches back to back? With random survivors experiencing the same?
---
These gimmicky perks dont see play because they hurt you more than anything. To how easy it is to get stunned (ie people staying at pallets waiting for a swing) or just dropping after a hit to stun, it would be like MoM. Hard to use for almost nothing
---
Like even with the balance landing nerf fucking haddonfield just sucks I hate it even as a survivor and lets not talk about mount ormond it is fucking HUGE seriously devs fix these maps
---
all I am saying is.  If someone like myself can pick up the game and get red rank, so can you.  Maybe you're not the perfect teammate either?  (Not saying I am)
---
How did the survivors fall for that though? Doesn't the myers jingle play when you hit tier 2? They should have known you weren't afk after that, but you were still getting them at tier 3?
---
You can't do that with certain killers, and that also just waste time. Since perks need progression for there tiers, there could be certain amount of times the killer has to be stunned before it breaks
---
No that was just dead hard working as intended
---
/s ü§£
---
People hate Iri Hatchets as well. You also forgot Clown's add-on. 
---
But NOED is just one of those perks where you could play very well and then all of a sudden you just get downed because the killer now moves faster and 1 shots you. Doesn't help there's no warning to it either.
---
Let them hate. Hang them on the hooks.
---
Those blight outfits are awesome.
---
I got the Plague yesterday because I had 30 serum and needed an outfit to buy, I really liked hers so I figured I'd give it a shot.
---
She might replace hag as my main, which is nutty lol
---
Yeah but again the killer will just be scared of getting stunned to lose TWO of their perks (hex + this one). It will extend loops even more
---
Ds ia for tunnelera ,dh easy to counter, MoM its sucks to get but Can save tou sometimes but 3 hit for the killer and protection hit are rlly strange to get them so ok, and bt its for tunnelers too but a little Op i think
---
So that perks is ez to counter
---
And noed is not a Op perk its good because you dont know that the killer have it so you didnt expect it like a t3 infinity myers you can counter because you know he have it, but noed is a surprise, you always Will play like you have to take 2 hits and loose a match because of that perk
---
And the bad english is because im Brazilian so, Sorry If you got confuses Reading this
---
I like how you assume this has anything to do with me and how badly designed hex ruin is.
---
&gt;The game has a big healthy playerbase, such problems should not exist. They should either rework how ranks work and reward them properly or make the matchmaking as tight as possible.
---
On PC 20.000 average players **worldwide** isn't that big imo. Some regions suffer more than others during low population time of the day. 
---
If they make matchmaking "as tight as possible" a lot of people won't be able to play unless they try during peak time and even then, killers might not be able to play because apparently there is a set number of lobbies that can be created at the same time.
---
I would be nice to have more information on how lobby creation works but a while ago you could just immediately open yours and wait for survivors. Now you have to wait until there is an open spot to join a lobby and only then, survivors start joining.
---
I don't like Plagues and Trappers blight cosmetics. The rest are awesome though. Also Hag is fun but sometime a less big brain killer is fun too lol
---
He‚Äôs also pretty damn generous in setting up his family with houses, property &amp; gifts. Also donates to a few different charitys, definitely a swell guy.
---
It all boils down to kills, it‚Äôs the killers main goal and should be achieved by any means and noed is most definitely a means to do so. If a killer wants to run noed and cleans house, the survivors should just take the L and move on because hoo boy does it bring the salt.
---
Its not the exposed status effect that we hate, its the fact that you literally failed your objective and got rewarded for it. Hell you could be like the front page video where you can afk for 5 gens and get a 4k for it.
---
Everything you listed, with the exception of iri hatchet, you have to work for or at least can be played around. Noed has no indication other then you suddenly go down in one hit endgame, now sure you could just play super safe and drop pallets early until its confirmed no NOED, or you know 5 totems have been cleansed, but part of the games design is taking that first hit in chases.
---
NOED is, you lost 5 gens, its time to get downs for free for literally no reason other then you guys missed a totem.
---
The real question is, can it boop?
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve played both sides from the start and almost never get mad at the killer. They camp, tunnel, get triggerhappy with moris or win a lost game with noed? It‚Äôs not exactly fun but ultimately it‚Äôs on me to counterplay it; it‚Äôs their objective to kill me, after all. If they managed it using some cheesy bullshit I clearly need to improve my own gameplay to counter it more effectively. 
---
Teammates, though, that‚Äôs a whole different level. Sandbagging, farming, hatch camping, wasting time with immersion or trash perks like urban evasion/self care... It‚Äôs definitely frustrating. Luckily, I (usually) get to watch them die. That makes me feel better.
---
I don't play a lot of killers, but I like Hag, Plague and Demoboy the best. Nurse is fun but really exhausting to play lol
---
People don't play Plague much because other killers have an easier time earning emblems and getting points.
---
I usually get lag after playing a few games so after a game with lag I will restart my game and there will be no lag for like 7 games.
---
Generous acts I agree but doing stuff like that doesn't exactly make you a great person.  Not trying to say it isn't a nice thing to do just wanted to point that out.
---
I'm not a high ranking killer (hella suck at the game) but isn't it a bad thing to get a stunned. And a perk has to come with counter play
---
Hag is really fun. Plague too though she's pain to play against imo. Demodoggo isn't rewarding to play to me though... And I agree Nurse is exhausting. You need to have a lot of micro play, between managing your range, blinks, fatigue... Its a lot lol
---
I think I‚Äôll take one :)
---
Noed brings a lot of fun to the end of the match in my opinion. Surprises and salt everywhere haha. It also adds more risk to the endgame collapse. Your english is wonderful and I read it perfectly.
---
He used his Shadow clone to fool you
---
or maybe u have something my team mates dont have a different mind but when I have to hear survivors call the killer shit when they fucked up all game and the killer did nothing wrong I get offended on the killers half like I am not playing survivor to win I usually play just to loop bc that to me is fun I am decent at it sometimes greedy and sometimes I mess up but I live for the times I can loop a killer for a couple gens to the point the killer gives up and just looks at me and says "fuck this" and finds someone else.
---
And to get this back on track with Ninja since I've seen him play with Hexy a kinda toxic survivor main what picture does that paint for Ninjas community if they hear Hexy and look up his stuff and get into DBD now to be fair Hexy isn't as fucking toxic as someone like Ochido or the old No0b3 but here is the thing Ochido has gotten like hushed out and No0b3 has changed he is nicer now *ochido is still a asshole as far as I know* but I will admit I dont know everything about Hexy but I know he isnt the kind the DBD community would want to rep us rather I think most people would want Otzdrava a super nice killer main. But my point is if Hexy while playing with Ninja makes ninja start playing like him even DCing and shit what light does that shine on the game from his viewers eyes
---
Because it rewards camping like a moron no matter how you look at it. 
---
Do totems? You've stayed off gens and rewarded the killer for camping.
---
Do gens? You've given the killer free NOED and rewarded him for camping.
---
I don't mind the effects of noed, but the fact that the killer can sit on his ass and get free 1 shots is ludicrous. It should work on a token based system like Lullaby so that the killer has to actually do *something* to make it work.
---
He on pc i didn‚Äôt check?
---
Spine Chill bc it gives a small boost in vault speed among other things while Premonition doesnt
---
Legend
---
It depends on where you get stunned. Usually, on an unsafe pallet you do not want the stun since you can mindgame the pallet easily for a quick hit. Just bait out the pallet. On a safer loop though, you swing through it so that if the survivor's reaction time is a little off, you can hit them through AND break a pallet at the same time. You don't lose much getting stunned if you swing through for a chance at a hit if you end the hit earlier than the stun/when it connects
---
Also no cool down either
---
Not at all! I enjoy it when it‚Äôs used because it still adds somewhat of a challenge. The reason I made this meme in the first place was to call out how swf groups like the bully killers sometimes haha.
---
Ugh tell me about it. Since I ranked down a bunch with plague I'm afraid to play the nurse again. They'll bully me lmao
---
I'm not sure what it is exactly I like about demodog, I think I just feel like he's well rounded, I have a good lunge ability, a means to apply pressure, it just feels very easy to stop the survivors in their tracks with him.
---
Plus I mindgamed a meg into thinking I was using the portal and then moried her at the exit gate lol
---
In a perfect world starting with everyone getting infected super fast, Thana would be amazing. Unfortunately this is extremely rare. You will find yourself getting one or two people sick at the beginning at best in most of your games. This means that if no one cleanses you will likely not break them all until two or three gens are completed. Pop goes the weasel is just going to be so much more efficient for you and deny confident survivors who love to gen tap in your face super hard. Also i know a lot of people are going to pressure into changing your view, but please do not waste you time with dying light. That perk is noob bait in my opinion. Its just going to not do anything until 4 or 5 stacks and it takes too long to make a difference. Dying Light will make 12+ minute games free, but by getting to 12+ minutes you will have already won long before then :)
---
very true
---
I‚Äôm about to pee myself from laughing at this post
---
THIS IS SO CUTE OMG- HER NAILS!!!
---
Can someone be a midget illegally?
---
Freddy found dead
---
Just realise sometimes people are trying to be nice and help out, don't take your frustration out on them. 
---
More on hex ruin though, don't get worked up over it. Maybe take small game as a counter or just eat the added time how I described above. You can either have fun in the game and work round this shit, you can say they're flaws sure, or you can complain and *not* have fun. I'd rather you do the first is all.
---
I look at it like this....if Ninja can bring g in thousands of new ppl to play this game...then maybe BHVR can make more money and maybe invest it in its servers and other places to improve the game.
---
I can confirm the last part. It's rare for me to be mad at the Killer. If I'm salty at all, it's usually at my teammates for being useless or myself for being dumb lmao.
---
no one wants to listen to edm while watching somebody repair a generator for 2 minutes. if you‚Äôre going to do edited compilations, don‚Äôt forget the actual editing part
---
Oof, noted about dying light.
---
At the start of the game I find a surv or two, and slug them, so that the others will rush over and infect themselves. It's been a pretty efficient way of having most of the team sick in the first two-three minutes
---
Furtive chase and PWYF are awful perks on ghostface. Or anyone except PWYF for Bubba. PWYF needs to be stacked to be useful and you lose the stacks quickly and furtive chase only works in chases. Sloppy butcher instead of furtive chase and Nurses calling instead of PWYF would give you a lot of info and would greatly synergize with Ghostface's power, being stealthy and giving him a quick first hit. Other than that, just play the game more. Learn how to counter loops, which pallets to break, survivor spawns, mindgames, how much time you need to waste on a survivor before you need to pressure elsewhere.... Killer is all about time efficiency. You don't have a second to relax as a killer
---
I agree, but nonetheless it‚Äôs still desperate.
---
Damn next time I'll expect it
---
In your comment you agreed with the guy supporting hardcore tunneling 1 survivor that was not stated to show any BM, just because they would have "truly lost" if they stopped and chased someone else.
---
K cool u can leave now thank u very much
---
But most of those things don't take much work to put in either. And the 1st hit shouldn't be a part of the chase. You shouldn't have to get hit once to get away from the killer. Characters you would take NOED on typically have a terror radius, so you shouldn't wait in it so long that soaking hit should be a huge concern. That's one way to play around it. With the chainsaws you don't have to put in work except hitting them, which is just as much work as NOED, only a handicap in steering, but usable from the start. And if you pull off a 4k completely from endgame, the survivors are at fault, anyways.
---
*Laughter*  you dumb bitch
---
No one here will ever admit it though lmao
---
no worries, good luck with the next attempt
---
I LOVE IT, THANK YOU FOR THIS
---
Isn't distance the only thing that makes dead hard any good after the first time you use it?
---
Yes, Instead of chasing the survivor chase the air, that's how you win
---
I would've expected it if he was injured lol
---
You‚Äôre 
---
And no
---
im gonna cry please not the only game i love
---
If I was paying attention to the broken sounds I would have clearly heard the direction his real footsteps were making forehead
---
Nurse takes a while to learn but is very rewarding once you learn her. Like Huntress across the map hatchets except its perfect blinks on people. Demo just feels weird to play, like his kit doesnt fit together. On one side his portals promote a quick gameplay and map pressure with a little stealth but he's not stealthy at all. If he hits someone or misses his shred you know he's on someone so you're 100% safe. Shred feels a little weird to use at times but maybe its just me. Satisfying as hell to play though and definitely fun, just doesnt feel rewarding to learn unlike a lot of killers too
---
chainsaw requires good positioning, you should almost never get a chainsaw down vs a good survivor unless you outpositioned them massively with already thrown pallets.
---
Taking a hit while healthy is literally part of the chase loop and saves pallets from being thrown, resetting bloodlust and allowing for longer chases.
---
If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm a desperate hecker xD There‚Äôs a YouTuber that camps with insidious and people message him and call him salty and bad but hey, they are the ones that died. There are so many play styles the killers can take and it doesn‚Äôt matter which one will be played, some will judge them as bad or unskilled. I‚Äôm just out here trying to get kills and rack up the blood points :)
---
EXACTLY, You should've know to never trust your eyes and only trust your ears, then again your ears are lying to you too
---
Working as a token system would be good fix, which I know is seen in Devour Hope (which I enjoy much more, anyways). And camping is a fault in the player, not the perk. It takes little work to face camp someone on a hook, but you can't yell at a system in the game for someone being a shit bag.
---
It feels like premonition should at least show the killer /traps for that much of a draw back. Seriously not worth running.
---
I frequently do a kill your friends match with a few people to do practice runs with nurse, it's been helping a lot!
---
I feel what you mean about shred though, it doesn't turn at all when you feel like you should be able to, and unless a survivor is running in a straight line it's hard to pull off properly.
---
He could get the op laser or insane heat tracking and be op af
---
You're a shining example of what this community should be, Send_Ass_Pics

unsolicited post-game advice is the strongest BM
---
Spinechill all dAy no need for reasoning
---
It gets cleansed like 30 seconds after the gates are powered for me most of the time.
---
Yeah, this just reeks of bias. Hating Fortnite is still popular and cool for some reason. The same thing happened to Minecraft several years ago and now Minecraft is back, mark my words the same shit will happen to Fortnite in the new decade.
---
A bigger playerbase is always a good thing. The more support DBD gets, the more content we can get.
---
just wanna point in myself as a killer main with 500+ hours and even I feel that noed is a stupid safety net for killers that clearly have a hard time winning the few times ive played survivor I have seen it several times *always wraiths for some reason* it annoys bc I dislike safety perks like Old MoM and I feel that noed is like a adren that just stole ur game but for survivors.
---
not to add the fact that u have a 1.5% chance of actually countering it IF u did all 5 totems and that is the most waste of time when all other perks u can fucking tell when they are used before u get fucked by them this is the bullshit with noed u wont know until u get downed and then left to die bc survivors cant do much about it unless someone was lucky and found it not to add the fucking 4% haste u get giving u a easier time with chases just catapulting it as a perk to help u when u suck
---
I guess thats fair
---
Don't if you've heard, but there's a whole Predator game coming next year.
---
Indeed it do
---
You might actually be right. I reread her lore again and she acts more like an ENFP.
---
 a lot of perks need a new coat of paint tbh
---
is there anyway a perk of this nature could be viable, (thank you for your constructive input, hard to that these days)
---
Do people really find this funny?
---
I used to like Feng but then I saw Meg with good hair and ditched her for the redhead. Then biker Kate came out so I swapped again and p3'd her. Now that Yui is here I'm probably going to swap between Yui, Kate, and Laurie since I'm buying her outfit soon along with Jane.
---
Oh no.
---
can u imagine some PC players miss P2P smh
---
Maybe not everyone can afford great internet or they may live in an location that doesn‚Äôt have great infrastructure.
---
Not everyone can live in their mums basement in the suburbs like you kiddo.
---
Fuck, I don't know what's worse, another exposed or some Aurora reading that just shuts down immersive play (which would make him yet another killer that's only good against the poorer ranks that can't loop as well)
---
Nah I'm on PC lol. Ty for asking though lol. Its honestly more that there arent enough good players that are my friends for it. Got two people that play often but they're rank 12+ and I'm rank 6-7. And I feel like I'm a pretty good Nurse too so I'd most likely piss them off and make them stop playing. Only reason I don't rank up with Nurse is cuz I p3 50 her and I dont have ruin/infectious unlocked
---
I mean, she moves at 115 like everyone else, she's not slower.
---
Really? I haven't heard anything. Who's making it? Ubisoft involved by chance seeing as they had a predator dlc in GR wildlands?
---
&gt;can u imagine some PC players miss P2P smh
---
On servers killers with bad internet also offer a shitty experience for survivors but in a different way. 
---
Instead of having your game lagging, you'll see them teleporting nonstop which makes it harder to evade them during a chase. You'll get hit out of nowhere. Granted that they will also struggle to keep track of you.
---
Mmm honestly there's already spirit fury but thats not an hex perk and it rewards getting stunned. If something like that would be added (stun removes perk) it would need to be on the perk itself because you couldnt add it on a no hex build and would make the perk useless. Otherwise I don't think that, with the way we play the game currently, it would be viable on anyone other than Huntress and maybe Hillbilly if played correctly (and the survivor doesn't know the timing for the stun during chainsaw)
---
The editing is dogshit and you're boosted.
---
no one asked
---
you have to invite friends but you dont need a full lobby to start, as long as you have a killer and a survivor youre good
---
What's your reason for profiling me? kiddo
---
Well shit.
---
We must destroy him before he reaches ochido levels
---
literally it has fixed matchmaking for me as a survivor I am actually not forced to sit and dodge 10+ lobbies bc killers have a ping of 100+ I know dedicated servers arent work perfectly for everyone but its clearly working for a good amount
---
Ok hater
---
Lolol I had to set special rules for it so no one gets mad. No hooks unless it's to try out a strategy or perk. Three downs, I win. Gens done, they win. Then we just practice loops or blinds or whatever else.
---
I don't put too much stock in ranks because I've been rank 1, but I've also been locked in at rank 10 so I just ignore it mostly.
---
I just play legion for the skins Sussie Christmas shirt is sups cutes
---
Ok, while I agree that he isn't very good and that the ending is subpar, you don't have to be a dick about it.
---
Nobody fucking cares.
---
Its actually normal. The rank 4 and the rank 16 most likely were in a SWF and since DBD's matchmaking searches for the highest rank in a group to base their matchmaking of, and is in a 6 difference, having a rank 10 and 4 in the same game is supposed to happen. Dumb? Yes. Unbalanced? Totally. The difference between rank 4 and 10 is massive but thats how the game is..
---
I take it you don't play survivor much? Literally just had a match vs an iridescent huntress, I ran her for 2 gens, I completed 3. She camped and tunneled the hell out of her first two kills (which was why I could completely do 3 gens). She ended up with a 4k because of NOED. She had ZERO skill, got demolished all game, but still ended up with a 4k because of NOED. If you don't hate that, then I doubt you've ever had it happen to you. And I'm a Killer main. Nothing screams "I'm terrible at the game" to me more than NOED.
---
I‚Äôve been playing switch consistently since it‚Äôs launch. At the expense of a graphics downgrade in handheld mode, it‚Äôs the usual dead by daylight but you can play while shitting. In docked the game looks fine and once again it‚Äôs the usual dbd. (FYI Freddy isn‚Äôt in the game yet)

As  killer main, you are my hero.

Ranks mainly mean time spent on the game but it can be a good indicator of the player's skill imo. A rank 10 won't play as well as most rank 1s. Also nice rules honestly they sound pretty fun and fair lol
---
Oh well, back to the drawing board, thank you for being respectful.
---
And bothering to give input, I was half expecting this to just get either shitters or no one at all
---
Not just wraiths, frosty eye killers.
---
The Hallowed Blight pants go well with the ugly sweater.
---
everyone knows Megs are sugar gliders at heart
---
Damn, everyone killed him.
---
&gt;literally it has fixed matchmaking for me as a survivor I am actually not forced to sit and dodge 10+ lobbies bc killers have a ping of 100+ I know dedicated servers arent work perfectly for everyone but its clearly working for a good amount
---
That is true and it would be one of the benefits of servers, not having to dodge lobbies. You queue to your server rather than the nearest killer.
---
As for lobby dodging because of the ping, in my experience 70ms to server is far worse yet more stable than 110ms ~ 150ms to a killer. On servers the hits after a window vault have never been this bad on p2p. 
---
I wouldn't say "its working for a good amount". To add other experiences to the argument other than my own, most if not all the streams I watch face the same issues as I do but most people aren't very tech savvy so they wouldn't know what the issue is (servers). Some of them even blame hitboxes because they learned to complain about them from the other members of the community.
---
Finally, servers are still being tweaked so there is hope. Truth be told they improved significantly from the first time we saw them back on Plague's PTB to today.
---
&gt;On PC 20.000 average players worldwide isn't that big imo. Some regions suffer more than others during low population time of the day.
---
There's crossplay involved.
---
&gt;If they make matchmaking "as tight as possible" a lot of people won't be able to play unless they try during peak time and even then, killers might not be able to play because apparently there is a set number of lobbies that can be created at the same time.
---
Sure. That could be an issue if this happened in New Zealand at 5am. 
---
Alas, this happened in EU **at peak hours.** 
---
&gt;It would be nice to have more information on how lobby creation works but a while ago you could just immediately open yours and wait for survivors. Now you have to wait until there is an open spot to join a lobby and only then, survivors start joining.
---
Agree with you there. This is still a very big issue and clearly not an edge case, hence why I decided to make the post.
---
&gt;So yeah... "fixing matchmaking" is a lot deeper than most of us, ignorant players, can ever think of.
---
Not all of us are just "ignorant players".
---
&gt;People are just too stupid to think about it for a brief second and instead they just spam threads pushing the devs to do something that might not even work.
---
You had to go there. The rest of your post was pretty articulate so this came unexpected. 
---
I saw an issue that had a very broad spec and decided to shine some light on it. If people didn't complain, this would never get any attention and get fixed. 
---
Again, it's important to remember this was not an edge case. This happened around 9pm EU time, on an EU server. There's clearly something very wrong happening.
---
imo, BT is one of several perks that are good no matter what level they‚Äôre at.

Is your name fruit loops on dbd? If so I played you today or yesterday technically

toxic cuties
---
Run the perk ‚ÄúSpine chill.‚Äù If it lights up and stays lit when you haven‚Äôt heard any terror radius and haven‚Äôt seen anyone else go down, look around you carefully and try to move to a safer position because you‚Äôre almost definitely being stalked. 
---
Ghostface stalks individual survivors until they are ‚Äúexposed‚Äù (meaning they go down in one hit), and you can tell you are exposed by Ghostface when there‚Äôs a red circle around your icon/username in the bottom lefthand corner. Ghostface has to stalk you for a certain amount of time in order to do this, so try to break line of sight and, if possible, keep him near the middle of your screen when you look at him; this stops him being able to use his power. 
---
Michael Myers stalks the whole team collectively. He charges up his power by stalking multiple survivors (rather than just one) and once he levels his power up past a certain point, he can down any survivor in one hit, regardless as to whether he‚Äôs stalked that specific survivor or not. 
---
As said, playing with spine chill is the strongest counter to these killers and this playstyle. They‚Äôre also pretty weak in loops (at least before you‚Äôre exposed) so consider picking up Kate Denson (or just her perk ‚ÄúWindows of Opportunity‚Äù) so you can always easily find pallets/windows to help you escape the killer.
---
No problem haha, just having fun answering a bit to everyone on the subreddit rn. Its pretty fun, especially to these idea threads lol. Most people that made these are great to have a talk with and are open to different point of views. Also I agree about people being shitters but its the DBD sub what do you expect lol. This sub is so toxic and full of circlejerking lol. Its great to find the little pearls in the community though. Just ignore the assholes and move on with it lol
---
And people say decisive strike has counter play...
---
no I have it set as ohFruit for now I haven't used this user name on DBD in a while
---
Holy Lag Batman!
---
It'll be a another stealthy, exposed killer and Arnold will have useless perks ala Ash or atleast nothing fitting someone as bad ass as him.
---
But I got an upvote which means someone cares
---
&gt;There's crossplay involved.
---
I am assuming you know that this crossplay is PC to PC still. With that being said, do you firmly believe a significant amount of people choose to buy DBD on Microsoft Store over Steam? Genuinely curious, not trying to be mean. 
---
&gt;Again, it's important to remember this was not an edge case. This happened around 9pm EU time, on an EU server. There's clearly something very wrong happening.
---
The "something very wrong" is vaguely explained by Horvath on my first comment. The rest of my comments were regarding matchmaking as a whole, excluding this anomaly that is causing rank 20 killers to face full roster of rank 1 survivors.

I wish we had more people to do it, it's usually just me, my boyfriend and occasionally my mom lol

I'd like to play a round like that with a full four survivors so everyone I know can personally bully my nurse lmao

Same goes for nurses. Also if they start at the beginning of the match you KNOW they know what the fuck they're doin. At least with nurses.

Cries in console

ENFP is very supportive and charming which is what Jane is!
---
Honestly from what I know playing nurse on console is super hard so gratz for even trying lol. Also maybe your nurse gets bullied but after a while you learn your range by charge time. Its a lot of muscle memory lol. Same for how much time you have between chain blinks before you get fatigued
---
What? *Not* adding new characters and new perks is what would lead the game to being stale...
---
It pains me that they had to do ash wrong like that and not give him perks fitting for the god Bruce Campbell is
---
The devs that made Friday The 13th.
---
have an upboop
---
Except, Survivors that no longer care about anything are essentially thrown to the void. The Entity only keeps around those who have strong emotions. Survivors canonically all have hope, fear the killer, etc. It's the same with original Killers, they are either insane, angry, extremely malicious or all of the above. All of those things have strong emotional responses. Technically, Survivors are non toxic and Killers are toxic by canon.
---
... I do not know how to feel about that
---
I'm sorry you have to deal with such toxicity. I think there are a lot people who play DBD that don't realize if they approached messages in a kind informative manor, the person they're insulting would be more receptive. Instead, people just want a reaction, which is childish.
---
I screamed "Noooo!"
---
I run a ‚ÄúForever Freddy‚Äù build on Legion, using Dying Light, Hex: Ruin, Stridor (replaceable) and Thanatophobia. Using the Legion Pin and Stolen Sketchbook add on causes survivors to go into the broken state guaranteeing Thanatophobia is in effect. It‚Äôs fun seeing all 4 survivors with the broken status effect if done right and watching them struggle to get anything done.
---
I did mine with Hag, Iron Grasp/Ruin/BBQ and something else I don‚Äôt remember. Brown addons (I think increase trap trigger distance + increase duration?) Took a few games because of DCs/hiding on the far side of the map, but I got lucky pretty quickly. Iron grasp was only t1 so that may not have even been totally necessary. 
---
Tips:
---
-find the three generators closest to the basement and defend those
---
-if you have to chase someone further from the basement, just hook them as close as you can and wait for the unhook to take them the rest of the way
---
-prioritize people on death hook when they‚Äôre in basement range
---
-don‚Äôt camp; you want your terror radius away from the basement so more people try to commit to the save. you may even need to go pretty far from your defended area to chase people off gens and encourage them to go save
---
-if you *really* need to run NoED or whatever other ‚Äútoxic‚Äù perks/addons to get the challenge done, just do it; one really scummy game is better than a dozen only-kind-of-scummy games.
---
It's so boring to play both roles when most of the game is hoping to get lucky and wandering around
---
I really like how the bracelets on her arm look with the pustula serum for some reason. Since I bought the Medusa skin months ago, I wasn't too excited with her rift cosmetics tbh. 
---
But yes, she's so much fun! She's been my main killer for two years.
---
Yeah, I didn't think about that. I still think working with that general idea but making the percentages less severe would make her power be a lot more useful in keeping survivors off of objectives for a period of time compared to how it is now.
---
Wait were gonna live forever is a top tier perk now?
---
Just how I remember the movies
---
I tried it expressly because everyone said it was really hard! I did okay in green ranks, but that fatigue is murderous and I still suck at chain blinks.
---
Was really proud that I got my first blink and grab someone off a gen the other day
---
27-28 is definitely millennial age
---
Happened to me today too, same level and everything lol.
---
I just dont like his gameplay. Like yes I get he‚Äôs a noob and he will get better at sometimes but my god it just physically hurts me and not knowing any killer perks besides ruin. Like at least do research on what your opponent might have
---
*‚Äùfuck, she‚Äôs got her eyes closed. Where‚Äôs the tape?‚Äù*

I main Dweet, Meg, Ash and Kate and I don‚Äôt have a killer main I switch between them but my fav are GhostFace, Myers, Demo and Pig.

---
There‚Äôs are viable killers at high ranks besides Spirit. Nurse is an obvious one, just need to get practice as her. Billy, Freddy and Huntress are also very strong killers.
---
It's supposed to be "The amount of gens done needs to be 1 more than the amount of survivors left",  but your calculation still works as well lol
---
I like your style.
---
Not enough higher ranking killers playing because it is an absolute painis in the anus at high ranks and dicking around is near impossible so the game finds the closest matching rank... In your case there was no one above 20 at the time... Or the game hates you.
---
Billy: Peace was never an option
---
i assume being a rank 1 killer is like being a stressed soccer mom who foolishly offered to take the team out for ice-cream, and everyone assumes you have it under control because you have a rich husband and a big car and designer shoes, but the kids are all hopped up on sugar running around wrecking the place and you haven't seen little tommy in 20 minutes and honestly you just want to go home and drink a bottle of wine
---
Also, McLean, in his stream acknowledged not only an imbalance with SWFs but also in rank matching.  They are aware it's a problem but it was clear by the solutions he was offering that they aren't really going to fix it.  They prioritize SWF gameplay over killer and solo queues.

I can tell what realm I going into when the game is about to start. Takes practice l. The color pallet of each map is different like how Macmillan‚Äôs are blue and Autohaven is green. A second before the game loads, you can see the sky. Just look at the color and u know what map. Small little tip.

No, I actually thought the crossplay option was meant for the consoles. But a quick google search shows the same issues on consoles. Thanks for informing me on that.
---
&gt;excluding this anomaly that is causing rank 20 killers to face full roster of rank 1 survivors.
---
That's my main concern and the motivation behind this post. I never saw the QNA, only knew it existed because of Reddit anyway. I'm guessing most newcomers didn't see it either. 
---
They said it will take them **a while** to fix. Can you imagine how many new players this "bug" will deter if this keeps happening?
---
&gt;The rest of my comments were regarding matchmaking as a whole
---
I still think there's something very wrong with ranks and matchmaking. I've been playing killer at rank 10 to 8 lately, various hours, and I've only been getting matched with rank 5 or better and usually teams.
---
 Funnily enough the skill level ranges widely, which leads me to believe some of them should be at the ranks that are currently not occupied. But that's just my observations and a discussion for another time.
---
You gotta start cutting your corners a lot more tighter. 
---
You could have caught him by the second loop, but you‚Äôre taking HUGE turns through the middle of the doorways/halls.

Fucking genius

Are we talking swf or solo?
---
Goooooooodbyyyyyyeeeeee Mooonmennn
---
No, that‚Äôs Mike Sawyer-Vorhees, from Texas Halloween Massacre (The 13th one)
---
I don't know how this would be balanced
---
If it's a killer offering it would be useless and hurt huntress if she used it and if it's a survivor offering if you ever decided to hide in a locker the killer would just have to check less to find you
---
1. I'm really sick of this I'm on the opposite side but I agree opinion. Of course one person is going to be on the opposite side (killer) and agree (noed is cringe), this doesn't make it fucking objective. Every fucking Youtube video with an opinion has this opinion (pewdiepie saying n word for example), you're not objective for agreeing.
---
2. How the fuck can someone who doesn't use full stops for a full paragraph get upvoted? Like what is this shit.
---
3. You didn't read my paragraph at all so I'll repeat my point. Noed is not a strong perk or else more killers would be running it. No one runs it past rank 12 because it doesn't impact the game at the most important point. Hex ruin is actually run every game yet people complain about noed. Why?
---
To clarify, I was one of the survivors not the killer. 
---
I don't think the game being unable to find a survivor team that's not in the red ranks at peak EU hours with 20k players online is normal.
---
That timing was perfect
---
I cut the corners just fine the second loop I took it wide to predict the pallet drop so I could insta break it without getting stunned
---

---
&gt; Funnily enough the skill level ranges widely, which leads me to believe some of them should be at the ranks that are currently not occupied. But that's just my observations and a discussion for another time.
---
Let me inform you a little more then:
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;# If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other 
---
* [DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
As you can see, this is intended by the devs (rank 10 killers going against up to rank 4 survivors). They can't make things stricter than +6-6 because of queue times. Queue times go both way, even if you still manage to find games with a stricter matchmaking, the other side might not.
---
I SURE LOVE USING ALL CAPS IN MY TITLES AND COMMENTS!
---
Spend some bp dude. Dang
---
The absolute maximum you can get in the same match would be 256k base points + 5 bloody party streamers + BBQ + bloodhunt.
---
you really went out of your way to say that huh... did it really offend you that badly? im sorry my friend
---
Edged into Rank 7 finally.  Got matched against Tofu.  Like that would have been a reasonable match.  Dodged.
---
This is the best thing to have ever graced this sub. The "You get what you fucking deserve" had me chortling.
---
I find I dont like it on my switch...the killer ques are insanely long and I dont feel like it's as responsive as it should be. Like I see skill check I hit skill check and the delay tells me I missed skill check. And playing as survivor killers dc like mad. The moment you get ahead they will just say nope and dc
---
I had to as a spirit main lol.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs my biggest head scratcher it‚Äôs such an obvious noise. Maybe most survivors just thought it was an audio glitch or thought it was an accident/didn‚Äôt matter because he wasn‚Äôt moving?
---
Man I miss old freddy so damb much! He was different and fun to play as!
---
Try keeping as many people as injuired as possible. If a chase is going too long, frenzy them to find someone else. 
---
Only thing legion is good at is constantly injuiring people, so take advantage of that. You are a low tier killer, you have to make use of your power.
---
bc im not a asshole that just blames shitty survivors or acts like a grammar nazi but idc its not about the survivors the perk teachers new killers the wrong idea and that is why I rly don't like it it requires no attention to work and often rewards you when ur fucking up.
---
It makes me sad when the devs say they are happy with how NOED currently is yes it is a weak perk bc if u dont go for end game then it is a waste of a perk slot and I think any killer new or not can win before end game if they know their mistakes but NOED just teaches them that you can have a ruff time in the beginning its fine here have 4% speed and insta downs.
---
idk what u wanted said with ur first point it confuses me a bit but if it is about me saying that I am a killer main it is bc ur first part is literally survivors crying like stop it
---
The insidious run was the best ngl
---
Using all caps on reddit is the fastest way to say you want downvotes, especially since the content is not unique or exciting, my friends and I have had several occasions where we've successfully escaped the hook. I'm not saying the content isnt exciting for you, however using full caps on content others know about isnt exciting for us.
---
I believe Wraith, Billy and Nurse are "first in line" for the next tomes but I can't wait for a Huntress one. My favorite character in DBD by a mile.
---
That red one is way cooler though I agree, but that head piece with the blight body is great
---
My twitch is gzmo12 I main adiris but play almost every killer but shes the favorite atm! Even at red ranks she can destroy swf and random teams.
---
Don‚Äôt forget keys and P3 outfits. Those certainly won‚Äôt increase the amount of Mori‚Äôs and iridescents you see.

GIMME

---
How??
---
1. well not rly im not blind
---
2. eh pretty normal now
---
3. pretty normal in high ranks
---
4. nah ttvs are usually chill or shit and toxic ones are always shit
---
5. well i already go against swf in rank 3 so it doesnt matter
---
how about we dont dodge
---
I just need Jake and Im good to start gettin all the perks on daddy jeff
---
I actually enjoy playing against TTVs. It often allows me to watch their VOD after the match and see their reactions, even if that means getting cursed at.
---
As a Huntress player who loves throwing hatchets from great distances and unexpected places, landing these shots on TTVs is good stuff to watch later.

Yes, I was already in the know about this. I had my suspicions but researched around before making a post asking and found out. 
---
&gt;They can't make things stricter than +6-6 because of queue times. Queue times go both way, even if you still manage to find games with a stricter matchmaking, the other side might not.
---
Sure. And that would be fine if it wasn't the case for at least 90% of the games. You get way more +6 games than say +3 or under.
---
That's a really thing to discuss without knowing the actual hard numbers of player rankings though so it's best left on the devs to figure out.
---
no not rly dont dc
---
It's just the base description of the "we'll make it" perk with the gold shoved in place of the norma time frame

"Helping others heightens your morale. For each Survivor you rescue from a Hook, gain an additional¬†70/80/100¬†%¬†speed increase to healing up others for[[[[[¬†30/60/90¬†seconds.]]]]]]
---
Cumulative Healing Speed bonuses cannot exceed¬†100¬†%."
---
[Gold text]
---
I don't see why certain characters couldn't be both. Like have a "before" character that is a survivor. It makes sense with her backstory.
---
well ofc why would a person at BHVR take reports seriously anymore when they had to go out and say "HEY CAMPING, TUNNELING, DRIBBLING *back when old ds was a thing*, TBAGGING, LOOPING AND SANDBAGGING ARENT BANNABLE" like ffs
---
I knew if one of us was going to escape, the other would have to dc. I did what I thought was right.

honestly i really want wraith if only for some explanation how he went from "put his boss in a crusher" to "spooky pseudo-voodoo ghost man"
---
I'm havin' nightmares tonight
---
well not very nice to the Myers idk the full game ofc but it seems he did good
---
Well, why would we be nice to him if he's going to tunnel two of us to death?
---
Ticked sented
---
Ooh what does it smell like?
---
sounds like you've not become the old people version of a DBD killer
---
Mettle of man? What is this April 2019? Good shot post though
---
They probably saw your trapper level and thought there was no way that your level 5 could beat their higher level characters. 
---
 That said, they said whatever you did was super obvious, so I'm now wanting to see the entire game that made your hacking "super obvious".
---
why would he give u a easier escape?
---
Definitely, and they guy went on a rant on me and my buddies about gen rushing him and im like bro then we lose what do you mean XD. If your going to be complaining at least make sense or just dont suck.
---
ur speed is not the only part that matters for dedicated servers
---
Welcome to the sub. Dbd is also available on console btw.
---
Uhh, no problem... I guess
---
Exactly especially when ppl teabag me as I'm playing billy like I'm not saying I'm gonna guarantee get you but it's not a good idea overall
---
Personally, I don't enjoy the challenges you have to complete in a single trial. I don't find them fun so am more than happy to farm them.
---
I didn't downvote you... but ig I will now
---
I don't know about dcing, but you could have just annoyed him. Run around the map constantly jumping through windows and pallets. He can't find the other player if he is constantly being bombarded with explosions. If he's not gonna knock you down, then just annoy the shit out of him till he stops tunneling.
---
I mean we can describe DBD as you walk and hope to hold m1 while occasionally tapping space.
---
Yeah I've been helping killers with their basement hook challenges. In my opinion, the complete in one game challenges just aren't fun so am happy to help out killers when I can.
---
That's the thing, I have no idea. I put traps where pallets were, I've fallen for it as a survivor (Rank 12 survivor currently). I missed several attacks because I don't know the lunge hitbox for killers. They kept trying to loop me around a single tree so that confused me.  
---
Your guess is as good as mine. They are rank 18-16 and have Very Rare/Rare perks, so I think they were just being salty or something.
---
That's a semantic argument, the other versions of the game have implemented it and the base for it has been discussed for the system in question- you are fully aware it is an abuse of the current working of the game and purposely attempted to manipulated the game by system that is meant to help with legitimate connection issues not dynanics of the trial itself.
---
I'll give ya the other two but disturbed ain't bad. Defs not metal tho. Fucking mayhem is where it's at man
---
So just dodge if it looks like this trial is going to be a challenge? Yeah, that's what I thought.
---
Keep at it! Hardwork will pay off!
---
You're aware some fortnite skins cost just as much as the base game, right? If primary school kids can get that, they can get this game.
---
Yeah but you didn‚Äôt have to be rude about it lol.
---
Rough Christmas? Relax man it ain‚Äôt that serious
---
But at least you get to loop a killer and not just die or destroy him
---
To be fair, he was coerced by the Entity to kill her :(
---
Ok Ryan, nobody told you to get off of discord and come up in here trying to fake roast people for internet points, we already know were both losers.
---
Lunging is pretty much the same for every killer.
---
Oh, ideas &gt;:)
---
This is kinda like how I did it. Hag basement is so powerful because you can trap up the basement really well making it impossible to get a free save. I used distance green teleport distance add-on and green duration add -on. I used Agitation, Iron Grasp, Ruin, and NOED. I made sure to keep the gens close to basement untouched. I also unintentionally did this with Hexes Hag. Two spawned on a generator by killer shack where one of my totems were at. My Thrill went off and I went over there. One of them were body blocking and it ended up being Haunted goind off lol. I downed them both and got them down there. Someone tripped one of my traps (I have Mint rag and Rusty Shackles) and I decided to wait before teleporting into the basement. I downed the dude qnd he got one person off, I teleported to the guy that escaped and got him again. No obsession so I hooked him again. The other guy killed himself on hook as I hooked the 3rd guy. I went up and saw scratch marks nearby. Found him and hit him. He tried to kamikaze to hook but he forgot I was Hag lmao so I just teleported down there and snatched him.
---
Not sure if it was on purpose but it sure felt like it. If it wasnt, I've never seen someone that was that terrible at fixing a generator. It's not really all that hard pushing the L1 things. He was also playing as one of the characters from Stranger Things so I'm sure he wasnt new to the game.
---
I'm sorry? Lmao
---
While that may or not be true it doesn‚Äôt change what you said lmao you absolute knob lol
---
I just took a look at his videos on Youtube, and tbh it‚Äôs mostly cute how new and bad he is. He yells a lot but we were all like that in the beginning and at least it means he‚Äôs *somewhat* passionate about it. I think the exposure could be good for the game, and while i don‚Äôt advocate for toxicity, this game was literally born and molded in toxic sludge. It probably can‚Äôt get much worse, and if he ever decides to play killer consistently in the future he‚Äôll probably mellow out like a lot of people.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted a jungle map
---
His job is literally to kill you and stop you from escaping. If you can't handle that, then you shouldn't play the game.
---
hey dummy mute the chat then this is like saying ur getting bullied on the internet bc u cant ur choosing to get the hate when there is a mute button
---
This is happens to both sides.
---
Gentlemen, I present to you in its purest form: Mankind.
---
But seriously, that's the kind of shit I would record and ship on a rocket to scare the living coitus out of some aliens.
---
I must‚Äôve missed so much
---
You cant even hook up with the girl that likes you because you're scared of girls who play video games.
---
That's not how this works.
---
BHVR decides what changes to make.
---
It's up to us, the schmucks who haven't quit the game out of frustration at the devs yet, to rule on whether those are good changes, and (spoiler alert) most of the time, they tend to make bad changes.
---
Whether they listen to their players is up to them, but patience is a finite resource and they're going on their fourth year of it.
---
You evil fuck, amazing.
---
you'll understand soon
---
Yea they won't do that. Proly nerf half the killers and remove the 2nd exit gate so kids can find it easier. So nerf buff? Idk not actually good. Maybe hillbilly will get a ninja hair skin who knows
---
Yeah, when I see someone drop an item or boop me on the nose I'll immediately soften up.
---
As the pig, I like to spam the ambush button, but not all the way, as a mean of communication with them. Toxic players, like you said, will not see my soft side. But I have a tough time making the choice of "Should I kill this last survivor or let them escape?" And most of the time I let them go
---
ü§î
---
*did you mean*: Pallet Lodge?
---
lmao true because I still have feelings for another person which is both cool and probably true for like 90% of this subreddit
---
Beta, they talked about how they tried it out but doesn‚Äôt fit into the game
---
"That's what you get for being matched with a stranger you have no control over who only cares about bloodpoints."
---
It's satisfying when you manage to get out, yes, but the match itself is just stressful.
---
If they ever do a wolf killer I want a survivor to get a wolf costume for Halloween
---
first she gets the bing then the dong
---
She already rejected you, that's called stalking at this point.
---
lmao bruh it ain‚Äôt that serious Nathan
---
I know, it's ok though this guys post will probably get lost in new. At least he has a story to tell.
---
My God lmfao
---
That can be your Christmas card for next year.
---
True he will probably look in this thread and be like what the fuck these two tards are talking to each other in Reddit
---
Annoying the killer causes non tunnelling killers to tunnel. I don't think it would change the way he plays but I appreciate the suggestion!
---
Who's frustrated? I don't have a problem with hex ruin I can manage it. Again, you decide to assume again. You're offering help to someone who doesn't need your help.
---
I feel bad because they have to make new content to keep development cash flowing but there‚Äôs so much of everything that needs updating from a dbd from a different time. I wish they would update add-ons, perks and offerings faster. 
---
The Detective‚Äôs Hunch and Kindred perk changes we‚Äôre actually very good but those were the only few perks changed in a sea of bad survivor perks(well aware killers have lotsa bad ones too). 
---
I think map add-ons are mostly very bad aside from 2 or 3 (there‚Äôs also just not a lot of add-ons for them either). Flashlights are almost throwing garbage after several deserved nerfs/changes/perks that made them very weak with so much counterplay, doesn‚Äôt mean they shouldn‚Äôt be changed though, etc.
---
"N-NANI?? HAVE I BEEN CHASING HIS AFTERIMAGE THIS WHOLE TIME?!"
---
I expect my implicit ‚Äúhow do you do‚Äù to be readily returned
---
am i missing something? i thought the initial post was an obvious tongue-in-cheek joke about said toxic 12 year olds in game
---
You name it more than likely did it. They reported me not only in game but on PSN as well.
---
Thats exactly how I play
---
"I'll be in the tall grass if yall need me." - Blendette
---
Exactly lmao. Not sure how do people get confused with that...but it sure did seem like it was on purpose. I dont care that I died. It's just the fact that it would of been so much easier if Steve Harrington wouldn't keep ruining my stealth since I'm a stealth player. You can almost call him a griefer at this point
---
I did it in a custom match with my friends. It was just 2 of us left and our friend said he was gonna save me for last. I kept doing it around the map and he was unable to tell if it was me or our other friend and he eventually went for me.
---
Trapper: I'm *hooked* onto you
---
Doctor: I can sense a spark between us
---
Spirit: I would walk across glass for your love
---
Huntress: I would sing 1000 songs to show my love for you.
---
Some of these aren't pickup lines but I tried making something sweet based off a few characters.
---
how do you tunnel two people?
---
Jason's power allows him to pick up pallets and hurl them at survivors like a Left 4 Dead Tank
---
Maps need reworking, addons need reworking, items need reworking, perks need reworking, some powers need more tunning, killers need QoL updates as well as any updates and Dedicated Servers need more fixing
---
As survivor whenever I see a pig I have to try and boop the snoot. It gets me killed 98% of the time but I live for the 2% chance of succeeding lol.
---
Welp. This meat can't beat itself.
---
You either freeze in the room or slowly back out
---
alright listen Huntress knows one song the one song her mom sang to her
---
This was indeed romantic, I smell a novel.
---
If that's the case it's not a balanced game and you can expect people to abandon it
---
Time to switch to killer main
---
Your right huntress knows one song....well she would sing that one song to put you to sleep
---
Plague: I'm going to make you wet
---
well this is console so maybe ur connection was shittier
---
True
---
or she would throw everything for someone
---
maybe if you cant afford good internet you should go deal with than on your own instead of forcing 4 other people to get fucked over for 20 minutes
---
horror cons are a thing? i need to look into that, damn
---
Yeah I thought they said something like that
---
Look whose shitting in the tall grass!
---
Wait wait wait lmfao     survivors "how dirty can you get ? " plague " I'll throw up on you and use it as lube" survivors " Oh that's dirty"
---
Hag: someone say dirty
---
one Person plays the game in a way you dont like, the other Person just straight up quits, denying everyone and himself of playtime and points.
---
Not sure how this would make you a good person
---
This probably got you on some sort of a watch list, somewhere.
---

That's a big rip, atleast your tried

obvious trolls, dont Feed them
---
By other versions you mean PC and Switch; not the phone version, PlayStation version and neither the Xbox version. Realistically, disconnecting isn't all that bad. Other players in the session get compensation for your absence; You may free yourself from a tunnelling/camping killer, even bad teammates at that, and it could also be used to help other teammates.
---
If people disconnecting really was this huge problem people make it out to be, why are you still able to do it? They have it in the game so you have an option to close out of a match you are not having fun with. They have it as an option so you are able to leave and go something else. Personally I'm not a huge fan of the penalty myself. Not because I disconnect a lot, because I don't -but because people are going to get punished for doing nothing wrong.
---
*clicks flashlight*
---
Leather face in your radius wants to beat your meat
---
I'm rank 1 looking for anyone to swf in red to purple ranks, playing on PC and steam username is cum milkshake. Don't really care about rank just wanna have a fun time and get better at the game
---
How is this possible
---
I find both really boring. All ghostsface use nurses, sloppy butcher, thano, or anti healing perks. They sneak up on you while doing a gen and hit you, but they don‚Äôt chase. They keep everyone injured, so they don‚Äôt have to chase people. Cloak, hit someone trying to heal, hook. It‚Äôs really boring to deal with imo.
---
And that leads him to tunnel you. That still doesn't change up their play style. After they finally kill you, they're just going to tunnel someone else.
---
By tunnelling one to death, then tunnel another to death.
---
I thought that the double crouch when you meet a team mate indicated a bow.
---
It's called a selfless act.
---
yeah imma need you to use your brain
---
Like I said, BHVR has consistently done whatever the hell its wanted to DBD. They rarely listen to the true critical feedback, because they handle the slightest criticism. There are plenty of even worse thing that‚Äôs refuse to see reason for. You learn to suck it up. This is a tiny blip compared to plenty of other issues. 
---
Keep being patient if you want. But that doesn‚Äôt change their minds. BHVR honestly doesn‚Äôt seem to care.
---
Part two of attempting romantic lines
---
Demogorgon: I'd go to the upside down and back for you.
---
Nurse: I would heal your broken heart to make you happy
---
Hag: I would make a sigil for you if I knew it would protect you.
---
Freddy: I wish you have restful night's and sweet dreams.
---
And make sexy noises in your ear as he does it lol
---
its called cheating the System. You lost against the Killer and decided to use unfair methods to allow one person to escape, makes you a sits loser at best.
---
"Bart, I don't want to alarm you, but there may be a boogeyman or boogey*men* in the house!"
---
*Evil Within tier 3 intensifies*
---
Legion: listen, it's either an orgy or nothing
---
You could probably make your own page with these love stories, maybe a series?  It would honestly make dead by daylight be seen in a different but sweet light.
---
Bubba: I want your face on mine ;)
---
Jesus lol
---
Well yes, but your whole plan was to get yourself out of the game.
---
And so is tunnelling. He is using unfair methods to secure all 4 kills.
---
I want to put your face on a chair and sit on it lol
---
I like going against an obvious 4 man SWF groups with at least 2 flashlights, then pretend to be really bad, and a few moments after they start bullying me instead of doing gens I start playing normally and enjoy the sudden shit show.
---
You're asking a stupid question. I answered it accordingly. You need to use your brain.
---
For perks I had barbecue, monitor, thanata, and sloppy
---
no he isnt? tunneling isnt against any rules and doesnt rely on forcefully closing the game...just accept it, you didnt do something great
---
I do like writting stories but I'm always afraid of upsetting a fandom people love and getting backlash. If I was more confident I would probably make little love stories and stuff on some one them. Or at least lighthearted stories.
---
Replace baby dwight with rank 4 Nea and this still applies lol
---
Oni-chan, what are we going to do on the bed?
---
It happening in the preschool on Remake Freddy‚Äôs map id fitting as well
---
You can‚Äôt start with the money shot you fool. You gotta lead me to it with a little build up, get me excited first.
---
No points in Sacrifice because you don‚Äôt hook survivors. No points in Brutality because you aren‚Äôt hitting survivors or making them go to different stages on hooks. No points in Chaser because you aren‚Äôt hitting survivors during chases. So you only have Gatekeeper to pip off of. No surprise there really
---
I.. Kinda wanna know how üëÄ
---
I'm not quite sure I follow you. If you're talking about escaping; who doesn't go into a game with the intention of escaping? If you're talking about disconnecting; It wasn't my intention to disconnect. I noticed the killer tunnelling, I knew the slim chance we had at escaping so I did what I thought was right.
---
"Looking for red to purple ranks"
---
"Don't really care about rank"
---
-_-
---
Well done
---
Many people like myself considering tunnelling 'unfair methods', if you don't, that's fine. Personally I think I did something good and others in this thread agree.
---
Oh they care, they just have no idea what they're doing. 
---
They're great at *making* the game it's just that they're god awful at *managing* the game.
---
for hex perks you have to find the lit up totem and destroy it. beware though, there are some hex perks that will damage survivors that destroy the totems (like haunted grounds)
---
Basically I was saying you should go and annoy the killer as far from the hatch as possible till he puts you on the hook, and you immediately kill yourself on hook so the other person could escape. You don't depip, you keep the earned BP from the match, and 4th player still might escape.
---
Mamulya
---
Yes officer, this oni right here
---
Laurie: wait for it.. wait for it.. RUN!
---
I meant stability but the rubber band dead hards kept happening
---
And my job is to escape and help my teammates at any means possible. I did what I had to.
---
Once I had a match where there was a Wraith who went invisible afk the whole time. Once all generators were repaired, my team mates went looking for hm, they found him and got downed by noed. I was the only one who escaped and he got three kills.
---
Bill because of L4D, Dwight because he's lovable with great cosmetics, Meg was my first and I love her basketball sweater, also Nancy because of ST and she's cute.
---
For killers I find myself playing Myers and Billy the most because I generally find them the most fun.
---
well he did something "you" believe is unfair and you did something that is factual unfair, you can Call it what you want, you just were a dick to that Killer, nothing else
---
The Babysitter made me fall in love with Samara Weaving and this movie proved that her star power wasnt just a one time thing.
---
I understand what you mean. That definitely could've been possible and I appreciate the suggestion. I might try that next time.
---
Beam me up-
---
And so was he to us. There's not a difference in sight.
---
Would you rather run Spine Chill, a perk that warns you about danger, lets you enter the killer‚Äôs mind, counters all the stealth and mobile killers and also has uses in chase
---
Or
---
Premonition, that once a year reminds you, that the killer is in fact somewhere in the game with its large cone and longass cooldown
---
Killers objective is to kill survivors, not defend gens. We call them killers not "gen defenders". NOED also removes a perk slot for 90% of the game which is a huge downside. It is fine for newer killers who cant cope with crazy fast gen speeds.
---
ty
---
this is so carthartic after playing against red ranks as a rank 19 killer and getting more teabags dropped than the entire boston harbor
---
sweat
---
Thx still kinda new to the game but been farming blood points to try out this build so happy it succeeded
---
It's rule #1 in the hillbilly handbook that you gotta rev up your chainsaw to assert dominance over the survivors
---
Don't they hear when you go from Evil within I, II and III?
---
&gt;If people disconnecting really was this huge problem people make it out to be, why are you still able to do it? They have it in the game so you have an option to close out of a match you are not having fun with
---
thats some next level bs. You can disconnect in every online game and 90% of them will ban you for it
---
that is on ur side
---
Don‚Äôt get me started on Left Behind. Broken af. /s
---
dude...you are the most obvious troll Ive seen in a long Time and it seems I actually fell for you
---
What is the name of the one perk where they couldn't leave through the exit gates?
---
I don't get how is it broken if there's a 50/50 that means that its balenced if its either very good or very bad
---
I block you first!
---
Jeff is Yusuke
---
Most people who find out about it when they first start claim its broken. I mean shit my friends who are rank 1 and have hundreds of hours still call it a crutch perk
---
Just make love stories for each person, like different books of the same story, they can be long or short, example: hag always wanted to love but everyone kept running away from her, day after day they ran away from her love but all they seen was a monster, eventually her love turned into rage and she started hurting them so furious was her rage for not loving her, hag thought how could she make them love her ? Hag was clueless, then Hag thought "what if I trapped them somewhere they couldn't escape ? Yes ! Then no one will run from my love no where to go right ? " Hag starting catch and hook them in a place where she knew they could not escape from, the basement in a Forrest in the middle of nowhere, Hag knew even if they did escape they could not find their way out she would just fine them again and bring them back, then Hag went threw with her plan, one by one each person fell to her claws, hooking them in the basement one by one and eventually capturing all of them, each day Hag asked them " do you love me ?" They survivors replied " NO!!! WHO COULD LOVE A MONSTER LIKE YOU!!!" Hag struck the survivors for being so rude, only deepening the wound of the lost love she so desperately wanted, each day Hag would ask them the same question, only to get the same response, Hag struck them again and hissed, each day the results would be the same, Hag started to wonder if she would ever find love, "maybe one day" ( Hag thought) " maybe if I keep doing this eventually someone would love me" (a single tear slowly drips down her face onto the ground) 
---
To be continued
---
End
---
Something like that.
---
How so?
---
Damn I love your style Yui is so cute~! üòç
---
Eh, it was just a theory. It doesn't catch everyone of course. If people are clicking flashlights I generally ignore them and kill their friends first.
---
I literally went to your channel and subbed because of this.

Everyone who has seen his other meme videos:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXZ5axuXqRxf-mRJhVwXnfg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXZ5axuXqRxf-mRJhVwXnfg)
---
The dude used to be a professional halo player after years of grinding. Just because hes not the best fortnite player doesn't mean he isnt a skilled gamer with a brain. Its not like this game is super hard....
---
I have found motivation to write. I gotta open Google docs immediately-
---
Doesn't that not work anymore? I swear in the spirit nerf they made it so she has no collision and also makes the phasing noise regardless of distance right? Or am I going insane
---
I like Hawkin‚Äôs. It‚Äôs got good loops in the rooms but bad pallets in between the rooms, so you can‚Äôt string pallet loops together
---
No. Very few games actually counter this problem. Take Rainbow Six Siege for example. You have to disconnect out of say 3 games in a close period of time to be banned. It's a fair system there. The one we currently have on Dead by Daylight is not fair.
---
Noice mate !!!
---
Thought this was a serious post at first
---
No this is a very serious post. I need validation!
---
*chants in the background* Hobo Myers, Hobo Myers, Hobo Myers
---
In honestly though, the hag, spirit and ghostface need more stories written about then. I don't see much on them on Wattpad or other writting sites
---
These all have to be kids. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt know how they function in society.
---
You poor thing. I‚Äôm you just don‚Äôt realize it yet.
---
xD
---
well lets look at LoL, Overwatch, even smash or even R6
---
All those Games will punish you if you DC too often, no matter the reason and dbd will too, the first Test Phase for DC penalties is just over
---
No...
---
No0b3 has become this, or at least he was this last time I gave up on his videos. Shame really.
---
The spirit deserves more hairstyles.
---
Hospital map would be awesome. I loved Halloween pt 2
---
You don't need a lot of information to make a story, all you need is this certain question in your head that links to their small story "what if "
---
Your post reads "fuck you devs, fuck you devs, fuck you devs". I'm not sure why you said anything to begin with because the devs generally ignore whiny babies. There are reasons for everything you're whining about but you didn't ask for explanations, you just want to complain.
---
Bubba falls into the same category as doctor and clown, can be great 1v1 but have 0 map pressure putting them very low tier. People wonder why these killers camp and tunnel and it's because it's the best way to win with their kit.
---
If by jumpscare you mean Scratched Mirror, you don‚Äôt need Monitor &amp; Abuse. Undetectable gives you no terror radius. I‚Äôd swap in Bamboozle or Pop, if you have it.
---
We must prepare for the seven year old army and fight back with even more toxicity so they rage quit
---
Would it be possible you did shirtless Myers next?
---
Thank the lord it's now over. I pray for my brothers over on PC!
---
I am actually afraid
---
Yeah the wiki said it was a .6 terror radius so I wasn‚Äôt  sure it was level 1 because I just picked it up in his blood web but I may farm for pop when I get the chance thx for the advice
---
What if questions will always lead into a good story üìñ I'm sure if people wanted to write about some of the killers and survivors they would make an amazing story if they could and get good reactions.
---
If you say so, my guy. I'm not here to change your mind
---
None of them even broke 10k but yeah YOURE the hacker. Lol 
---
This is hilarious to me as a survivor main. What the hell did they even do all game to have such shit points. Especially the 7k
---
Just don‚Äôt bother engaging. Some people just want to be mad.
---
Brain damaged killer mains be like,  "friends are op."  Get some you rage quitting fucktard.
---
Bro... do you have any idea how much crap rb6 has gotten for their servers?
---
No sweat. I think the wiki info was before Undetectable was added as a killer status.
---
It was never implemented as a way to leave a game your not having fun with or to be considered as any sort of tactic in the game. That has always been an unfortunate side effect of coding in place to deal with legitimate disconnections. A game without logical code to deal with disconnections would be glitched beyond belief- they include a compensation because the matches are designed to be 4v1 and something disrupting that before a valid time in the game is extremely detrimental. You will always be able to do it because its code necessary to deal with disconnections.
---
The fact that people are abusing something they can't reverse without doing damage to game function in fact CALLS for a penalty. If the players can't handle running the game to a natural conclusion, then they need to pay the price for affecting the game for others.  It's no more fun for a team to have someone disconnect then it is for a player to get tunneled- but tunneling is, again, a valid if dick method of using the trial specifics. To say its fair to DC when facing a method you don't like is basically the slippery slope to saying anything you can do is valid- "I CAN hack so it must be okay because if the game didn't want me to make this more fun why can I do this?" 
---
Either use the systems as they are meant (to deal with a legitimate disconnections as in something comes up and you have to leave game all together or system messes up)  or understand that you will only receive validation for the misuse of a system from people who are content to misuse the system for their own gain not true betterment of the game.
---
I actually never seen any of these bugs and I‚Äôve been playing for a few months, are they common? (Console player)
---
Yea the powers are actually items for the killer. That‚Äôs how trapper picks hits traps up and why he has no power icon when he has no traps. 
---
Back in the day you could find a chainsaw on the map no matter what killer you were playing
---
To be fair.  He may not care about rank, but he is going to drag anyone he plays with to his rank.  And if you've never played a rank 1 killer before let me tell you, if even one person is not a red rank.  The whole team will fail.
---
You know... i love ur comment so much, using emojis is fucking... CANCEROUS AND NORMIE AF, they shall go and do tik toks singing.
---
Exactly! Make a page and start writing stories, eventually people will join and eventually you'll have a while series of different stories of the killers and survivors, maybe even make 2 books out of it, dead by daylight will keep coming out with new characters so the stories will just keep coming in.
---
You can even use my story as an example for the page I don't mind.
---
Hex Ruin is a perk that you 100% have to use in higher ranks unless you want to get destroyed as a killer. It's a must have, and you'll see it basically in every game when you rank up.
---
Guess you‚Äôre the best player in the game kudos, it‚Äôs an honour to meet you.üëè
---
**You did it! You‚Äôve escaped!**
---
Return to main menu?
---
I'll think about making a page for writting but for now I'll be jotting down ideas and probably just posting stuff on Wattpad. I'm barley on Reddit anyways.
---
You quit because you aren't willing to actually learn how to play the game and loop the killer long enough for gens to be complete.
---
That is utter nonsense. It's not some inceedibly difficult feat to get to rank 1, it's just time consuming. Rank 1 killers aren't all as good as you seem to be implying.
---
Its Baby Sitter tier 4 perk. Protection at any cost comes with a dc
---
Alright mate sweet travels.
---
You too :)
---
Hillbilly has my support üòÇ

They also said they wouldn‚Äôt do monster killers but then we got Demo

They could just be SWF memeing and laughing on voice chat. I occasionally accuse the other side of hacking after getting absolutely destroyed, mostly for the benefit of the people I‚Äôm playing with.
---
I really dont care that he played dbd it's just his fan base that scares me. Games already toxic and u mix forknife kids it's just asking for trouble .
---
Why would you DC after someone breaks Ruin?
---
You still have a chance to at least 3K
---
Most people with similar names/outfits I‚Äôve gone against are pretty chill and mostly just meme around and go for dumb plays. Maybe that changes in red or purple ranks. It‚Äôs less wholesome if there‚Äôs only two of them for sure.
---
A very big boi
---
No idea, this always happens in red ranks xD
---
Thank you!
---
It's not only add ons, it's how the kit interacts with the build. Ruin, pop, sloppy and thana are slowing down the game well enough on their own, and combined with freddy's synergy with pop and the add ons still giving that 6% it's still not that thrilling to go vs. It's just boring.
---
Core of the whole thing is that slowdown build focuses on the less interesting part of the game (the gens) instead of the more interesting one, which is the chase aspect and killer/survivor interaction.
---
Ah so they changd their mind?
---
I do know however they shut down a killer who can morph into a survivor because it would be OP and it wouldn't exactly work in SWF.
---
So are you gonna keep complaining about your "problem" or are you going to do something about it?
---
How dare you still live after mori!?
---
Maybe, I‚Äôd have to improve on male chests a bit, but it‚Äôs not out of the realm of possibility. Just depends on how I‚Äôm feeling
---
That was because the killer was very bad
---
Good luck with the grind. I'm about to hit a milestone myself. I've never been red rank killer and I'm 1 pip off from rank 1 killer and I'm a rank 1 survivor.
---
You can hate them, but they had a massive impact on pop music and introduced rap to a new demographic that otherwise might not have been exposed to it.
---
Thing with the popular way to play GF is that it's pretty boring, as he doesn't interact with you much. He sneaks up on you, gets you injured and leaves. Then once his power is up he comes back and downs you since you don't know he's coming.
---
Chases and interaction with the killer are the fun part of playing survivor, so a killer that focuses on as little interaction as possible is pretty boring. GF on Hawkings is literally the most sleep inducing thing.
---
God I remember that one time when you could equip that chainsaw to every other killer- those were times
---
I‚Äôm sure fixing toxicity with toxicity is a fucking A+ idea 
---
Let‚Äôs prove how garbage our community is
---
Lol. Chasing you is not tunneling.
---
Screenshot it and you have a nice ps wallpaper
---
At the end of the day, it's still your primary objective to escape the Killer. Endgame is how people screw up and get hooked themselves. When I did play survivor, I was almost too altruistic. I'd be right at the exit ready to roll out but then I'd see a teammate still getting downed and hooked. I'd go help, give them borrowed time and end up getting hooked. What did they do? All I see is the status of the other survivors appear as "Escaped."
---
I agree it‚Äôs not super hard. I just mean if you rage and be toxic in a game like Fortnite, you probably don‚Äôt have the heart for DBD
---
Accurate
---
Yeah, Billy is really engaging for both sides if it's not instasaw or crack. The other two focus on less interactive strategies.
---
Here is an advice from a solo queue player: Always leave. 
---
EVERY... SINGLE... TIME... I came back for others, unhooked and ended up hooked in their place, they left ASAP without thinking twice.
---
Last time I tried to change this mindset, me and another random came back for a Claudette and we both ended up hooked. She didn't think twice before leaving even though both of us were on first hook.
---
Looks better then the games I play. I'm rank 2 killer and I get greens all the time.
---
Ouch. Yeah, not very fair or fun
---
Somehow I feel like the killers should be hiding with full lobby of Arnold/David.
---
It clearly is!
---
I know how to loop the killer. It's a shame the ranking is terrible and I get killers who tunnel my teammates to death. Why do you think I'm at red ranks?
---
Jan 2nd - Jan 6th
---
This is absolutely amazing
---
No. This is just completely false
---
Thanks man
---
If it was any other killer, you probably could have gone back for them. But end game requires haste to rescue people, and you don't make haste with the trapper.
---
Being alone is a staple of the horror genre. Psychologically, humans are social creatures greatly soothed by having another being on their side (likely an evolutionary trait stemming from loners being more likely to be eaten by a gator than procreate).
---
The game just works as a better experience if you feel a little helpless against the killer, and being alone helps that. That‚Äôs also why there are perks designed to help survivors group up more and benefit from doing so, as well as killers designed to be more effective if survivors group up.
---
Sprint Burst &amp; Technician are good for new players.
---
I did it on a ps4 custom match lol
---
If my son were to ever drop a pallet on my head, start pointing at me and star tbagging, I'm breaking his fingers
---
Here is my opinion‚Üì
---
Tenacity - bad
---
Calm spirit - good
---
Sprint burst - good
---
Dead hard - bad
---
Detectives hunch - ok
---
Lithe - bad
---
Breakdown - ok
---
Technician - good
---
Deliverance - bad
---
Unbreakable - good?
---
i thought it was a kid calling his mum a default and default dancing
---

No, they are that good.  Even if you hit red ranks as survivor, most games you'll play purple or green rank killers.  But rank 1 killers rarely lose.  Fungoose has a 4k win streak with Plague of over 100 games. Tru3 has a win streak with ghost face and wraith of about 50 games each.  These are streamers, but this is the caliber  of rank 1 killers.  Just like there are solo survivors with thousands of hours as survivors, there are killers that have P3'd most killers in the game.  They will destroy teams that have low ranks as part of the party.  It's a slaughter.  I've seen it time and time again whenever a 3 man joins one of my red rank games.
---
Is it tricky to pull off?
---
I mean, hasn't this been fixed already? XD
---
Ashley J. Williams, difficulty, easy. None of these things make sense.
---
&gt;	scream like little girls
---
I have 700 hours and I still scream when I get chased or the killer comes out of nowhere. I‚Äôm just excitable.
---
They are very different yes, but I‚Äòm the only one who can in my friend group who can differentiate easily
---
Thanks for all the up votes i didnt think it waould reach this many in less than 24hrs lol since all of you are wondering how this happened i was on a ps4 custom match! Started in spectator mode have everyone ready up and the bar on the side should disappear but then reappear once it reappears click the button to switch yourself to killer and you should connect woth no problems 
---
NOTE: IT MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO CONNECT SINCE THEIR ARE 2 KILLERS LOADING IN! 
---
Thanks once again!
---
Idk if they did change their mind or not, but they said no to monster killers awhile ago then demo came out
---
No its not i just posted how to in a mass message on the photo lol
---
Every time I try to play him I get cucked by his charge cancelling when it looks full at least 3-4 times. Feels like a waste of his charge time addons when you still have to wait .5 seconds to make sure it doesn‚Äôt cancel.
---
Really good holy fuk
---
Don‚Äôt be upset when you get to red ranks and every survivor has DS.
---
Oh yes you may boop the Michael he loves the boops ;)
---
Are you frying bacon while playing? The fuck is that noise?
---
You guys ever feel like you're just in the presence of an old deity that nobody remembers and it's just going to one day come back and fuck the world?

I might post more of these mash up powers later on! So stay tuned!
---
I must be wrong then or at least that‚Äôs how I remember it to be, could be a bug.
---
had the same bug and it looks like bhvr isn't aware
---
You tried different perks in this video, which combination was your favorite?
---
I‚Äôd say wait until they‚Äôre stronger.
---
Bond is absolutely necessary, Prove thyself and a repair kit are recommended too.
---
Except this is LITERALLY a game concept that comes out next year. Im dead serious, look it up. Most companies that make games based on certain characters also often sign a one year deal to make them exclusive to said game for that amount of time and baring other video game companies from using said characters.
---
There is never a "wrong" choice with this kind of situation- part of the fun of the game is the moralism. But they can be upset if they want, they did die. However, to be aggressive about it- answer is always "its just a game"
---
If you choose to mirror the actions of lesser men then that is all there will ever be. 
---
Choose to be better, choose to go back, choose the honorable death.
---
Only then will others be inspired to do the same. 
---
You always have a choice.
---
Bit the bullet or found less than 3% of the population
---
Tunneling and camping is the killer. Urban Evading, Selfcaring and other stuff is the survivor's fault. I can go more in depth because its not just black and white but stuff like this just burns me out from dbd.
---
Would of bin great if he put the "are u not intertained" meme, after the entity displeased
---
Yes!!
---
I've done this so many times that this is a mood at this point.
---
They'll likely just give it the badham treatment. Same buildings and obstacles but different layouts/variations
---
Are you running tenacity?
---
because you're the only ten I see.
---
This is actually good. Young people can be imprinted on so even if they are toxic people can change them.
---
‚ÄúTHE FUCK YOU SAY TO ME YOU LITTLE SHIT‚Äù

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh (pointing at you well smiling)

Yeah honestly from what I've seen his wife is 100x worse than he is.
---
Another 20 hour player, eh? Lemme explain in simple terms:
---
SWF group use mic to talk to other player. other players spread out so killer can not hurt faster than survivor heal. killer no have momentum, killer get genrush and die. The end.
---
you're making progress in your drawings good work go on.

If something isn't balanced properly, it can be abused. Duh.
---
Actually nobody, would be more like the Ash DLC. But if i had to choose, i would pick the grandmother.
---
Spine chill, as it gives more precise readings of where a killer is. Premonition does give an audible warning when the killer is close, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they are coming to you. On maps like the game especially these readings can be almost useless. Spine chill, had no cool down and tells you when the killer is looking at you, and grants action speed bonuses. It can help weed out stalking killers, stealth killers, allows you to remain stealthy, etc. overall, learn to read spine chill well and it is very useful
---
Yup, basically all killers with high mobility benefits the perk the most. Wraith, spirit, nurse and even hag.
---
What I expect: Meg and Wraith or Billy.
---
What I wish: Because there is no Halloween Event, we will have less lore about these serum stuff and also have no cosmetics based on the serum. So that in mind, it would be cool if the Tome focus on 2 survivors and 2 Killers. There would be enough lore and enough cosmetics to not be empty like when you ignore the serum of the current tome
---
Don‚Äôt prestige, it only makes ranking up and high rank gameplay extremely difficult, and just wastes no for a single cosmetic
---
Look I'm not a fan of Ninja at all. But can we be happy about something?
---
Ninja is (possible) bringing a crowd of new users in. If anything wouldn't we want this game to get more popular so devs could maybe work more on the stuff we complain about?
---
If they're going sheerly off of whoring themselves out to the most played characters to make money? Meg and Hillbilly. They're both in the original characters, and Meg and Claudette get all the cosmetics because people spam them more than anything.
---
Big keyword: Can. Sprintburst is one of the better ones, but Lithe and Balanced landing can't always be used unless you stay near the spots you can use em. Deadhard is good for looping but the distance you gain is insignificant unless you're already near the pallet and just need that tiny boost.
---
on the other hand, SWF abuse them by using them and switching aggro off to another person who has another exhaustion perk. If you can't gain momentum as killer, you're gonna get genrushed, and you can't get momentum if every survivor has sprintburst on comment, atleast not faster than coordinated groups can heal.
---
It's only one part of the problem
---
I just had a squad with 3 flashlights on identical P3 Neas. 4ked them, and not a single useful blind was had.
---
I think we need more survivors with long hair,always medium or short (even bald)
---
For context: I was playing a match Solo and as I was doing a gen, I saw how a Dwight led the killer who happened to the wraith to a locker which hiding another Dwight that was injured. Poor dude was using inner strength to heal but couldn't complete it due to some stupid sandbagger.
---
Seeing this pissed me off. Then this cunt accidently gets hit by the wraith as he tried hitting the good Dwight. Sandbagger Dwight comes to me asking for a heal, to which I "sandbagged" him. 
---
Good Dwight was the only survivor that managed to survive that trail. Good on you good Dwight.
---
Ash is kinda a meme character. Flip-Flop is used for ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt hook this‚Äù builds, but I have never gotten much use out of it. Mettle of man is way to difficult to get and use consistently. And buckle up is a perk that I again just never see it‚Äôs use greatly affecting the game. 
---
All of ghost face‚Äôs perks have use, so go for him. Furitive chase is good when paired with play with your food. Thrilling tremors give great info when read correctly. And I‚Äôm all ears is useful for mind gaming windows and predicting movement.
---
I have no problem with new players. My own issue with it (and as the meme says) is that he's a toxic pos when it comes to playing the game. And those kids that he's bringing to the game, they're watching him do those toxic things and they're going to mimic it, consistently bringing in *toxic children*. New players is great, but I'm just not thrilled that it's *his* crowd.
---
Gonna get my spirit deleted for her buttcheeks. üòì
---
tombstone piece and tuft of hair lmao
---
I had 3 dwight's today same outfits... they had me laughing so hard I let all 4 survivors go...
---
If this was some big brain mind game so they would survive the trial it worked.
---
But I would have to agree the majority I've faced with matching cosmetics or names are just chillin and rocking the meme. 
---
And of they aren't sometimes you win sometimes you lose.
---
He just having fun with you
---
Well fuck. I figured it seemed (from the look of it and not knowing anything) that it was too good to be true :P
---
So basically I'm gonna see it all the time then if I continue to play this game?...damn. Is there no way to actually counter  it except for hitting perfect skill checks?
---
I see. Is that the ONLY counter play? To instead of going for the generators, I should go for the hex totems scattered around?
---
*Good Dwight and Bad Dwight*
---
Perfectly Balanced, as all things should be
---
You mean like let others purposely go, because I tend to follow someone until I lose them entirely or if someone closer is nearby.
---
Ok, so what did the banning message say? Did it give you a reason for it?
---
You can either
---
A) Man it up and try to hit as many great skill checks as you can. You will fail some (as in, hitting "good" skill checks). When you fail those, let go of the gen for 2 secs because it stops progressing those 2 secs but you can still get a skill check.
---
B) Try to find the glowing totem and destroy it
---
C) DONT DO THIS: Gentapping, I just mention it so you don't do it because its a bad idea.
---
I recommend watching some videos of good players PLAYING seriously (not tutorials, and not goofing around like monto), like tru3tal3nt, so you get a feel.
---
you can also just work through the ruin, but thats  really only if you can hit great skill checks consistently, youre working with survivors, or you have a toolbox.
---
"Strategic killer"
---
I actually went to a Best Buy on black Friday and all the DBDs were gone, found that interesting
---
Oh wow, sperm cells? That's sooooo 0001 !
---
That's console for you
---
Lol not my point, I'm just tired of people telling me that I should run X perk just because I lost. Probably the same time of people that get salty when I win.
---
Thankfully DBD isn't fortnite. The learning curve is steep, they will play a bit and they won't be a happy after being tbagged every match or always being the first one found/sacrificed.
---
graphics are really bad but if you still love the game, go for it
---
I see. Yeah, I'm not confident enough to hit even 50% skill checks for perfect, so not gonna try that :P But alright, guess working with others (I always try that, but guess I got to do that even more now) or having one of those items with me is going to be a must-have :) Thanks
---
The errors may provide some clue.
---
But maybe contact support.
---
I'm impressed at how you are suprised that BHVR messed something up.
---
How do y'all do that multiple killers thing
---
I'd suggest Freddy because he's strong &amp; Ghostface because he's generally fun. Myers is also good.
---
Also Nurse
---
Yeah, a) is prolyl out of the question xD I dont even hit 50% of great skill checks, so not even worth it to try I feel.
---
B) seems like the thing I need to go for, cus I don't know what gentapping is? :P I guess I'll watch some videos. The only "known" players I know that play dbd is ScottJund who used to play dark souls (and I love that game so followed him back then) but he is a killer only player, so not much to learn from his streams as far as countering hex:ruin.
---
How do you know Legion sucks if you've never played as him or even the game itself?
---
Wait unbeakable is good? I thought that would be for more experienced players from videos i've seen although I'm not exprt on perks, I only know small game, empathy, bond, botany, self care and iron will are decent for new players
---
CUTE
---
I'm I'm on PC.
---
Seen in twice in the last maybe 20 games? Once I got stuck, another time another player got stuck.
---
 Spine chill is very great against these sneaky killers I have had many games where I hid pretty well despite being stalked it helps so much staying hidden from them
---
You wrote, from right to left, „ÇÜ„ÅÑÊú®Êùë. Spaced out for each character, it's „ÇÜ:„ÅÑ:Êú®:Êùë. You separated the second and fourth characters. The second character being separated especially confused me cause it looked like to me it said "„ÇÜ„Åó„ÄÅ" or "yushi,"
---
Same, but reddit alway offended by TAHXIK TEABAGING is like teabags killed ther family or something
---
Galaxy Brain
---
exactly ... !!!
---
all of the perks in this game are easy to understand tbh. like dead hard may be the most complicated one but it's just a short little dash where you're invulnerable it's not too difficult to use
---
P3 billy mains out there can relate
---
Yeah you‚Äôd go down best thing to do is fake the save then run and dodge the saw
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt know Japanese and I can‚Äôt edit the post without deleting it and reposting so unfortunately it has to stay as is
---
I ask myself the same question
---
Switch is really bad. It feels like you‚Äôre on ice and you can‚Äôt even do 360s
---
For me the main problems with Clown are: 4 bottles aren't enough, reloading takes too long and his map pressure is non existent. Other than he is pretty fine killer. He can counter loops effectively and more than often whenever a Clown catches you are pretty much dead because you won't be able to reach a pallet or a window.
---
Also a complaint that I have is that because his ability is so simple and straightforward you cant really create interesting builds with perk/addon combos. For example you can use Infectious Fright and dead rabbit on Myers to find everyone, you can use Distressing on Doctor to get the most out of Treatement mode, you can use Infectious Fright X Legion Pin or Nurse's Calling X Defaced Pin or Irri Button X perks that work with your TR like Unnerving Presence etc There aren't really any perks that can maximize your power's potential or any addons that can be combined with perks.

At the beginning of each trial the game tells you the realm and map in the bottom left corner. At least it works that way on pc. Let me know if it's different on other platforms
---
is it good or bad for new players though I'm not too familiar with it.
---
The devs said the cosmetics from closed rifts will be available in the store after a still undetermined amount of time (at least several months), so if you want something specific you can buy it later.
---
I jus saw some streamers who have these bs cases too so i came here asking but i dont see any notice.
---
I guess so. You really cant just have a civil discussion online, can you?
---
Try 360‚Äôing him and when he misses you then go for the unhook. Probably gunna have to sacrifice yourself though.
---
Unbreakable reduces the time it takes for you to get picked up off the ground and once per game allows yourself to get picked up.  I don't like it in low rank games because slugging is much more common at high ranks.  Low rank killers generally don't know when a slug will benefit them.
---
Tbh that has such a small impact compared to the mobility the chainsaw gives you. You're not gonna get any extra hits or anything because of it
---
I'd say it's a weak perk for new players.  However, it's one of the strongest perks in the game.  If you're willing to practice with it , it'll definitely prove worth your while.
---
tnx

Bad:
---
-Calm spirit, 
---
-breakdown, 
---
-detectives hunch 
---
-technician 
---
are bad perks straight up. Bad not saying u cant use them. 
---
Tenacity is more towards the bad side but isint at the level of technician 
---
Good:
---
-Sprint burst is very good 
---
-dead hard but that takes abit of getting used to, -lithe 
---
-Unbreakable is by some people arguably the    best perk in the game
---
Perks can be looked at individually or in the context of a build.  For example certain perks make other perks a lot better.  Decisive strike and inner strength are a powerful combo because if you were recently hooked and the killer chases you you can run into a locker and if the killer pulls you out you can decisive off, and if they don't you can get your 8 second heal.
---
I would highly recommend running Kindred.  It's my go to perk after it was recently buffed.
---
like other people have already said freddy‚Äôs pretty strong rn but im a plague/ghostface main so those guys are pretty cool too. michael is also v fun but harder to master than the others. oni is shit
---
Save The Best For Last is pretty good paired with his power. Otherwise that‚Äôs pretty much it.
---
Grinch power: Salty "Nuts"
---
Grinch can throw his "Nuts" at survivor. Survivor hit with "Nut" suffer from Hindred and Traumatized Status Effect.
---
Salty "Nuts" Add-ons:
---
-Salt (Common)
---
Traumatized Status Effect lasts slightly longer
---
-Salty Salt (Uncommon)
---
Traumatized Status Effect lasts Slightly longer than slightly longer 
---
-Saltier Salt (Rare) 
---
Analogical
---
-The Saltiest Salt (Very Rare) 
---
Analogical 
---
-The Saltiestest Salt Ever (Ultra Rare) 
---
Traumatized Status Effect lasts for duration of the trial. Survivor hit with Salty "Nuts" suffer from Exposed Status Effect for 10 seconds 
---
"*Salty, Just like my Nuts*" ~ Grinch 
---
I don't know why the fuck I waste time writing this
---
Right in the legions
---
at high ranks it‚Äôs very good cause killer tend to slug a lot and it has a huge impact on the game. not that good at higher ranks cause the killers usually just pick you up right after downing you
---
calm spirit and breakdown are actually fairly good, they just don‚Äôt really compete with the meta perks
---
There are so many possible ways to combo his ability that I discover new ones every day. The build I use and suggest is:
---
Ruin because obviously.
---
BBQ because sweet sweet BPs plus Legion's map pressure means he can get a lot of use out of the info.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel because it's a giant middle finger to gen progression and combined with ruin makes the survivors waste a shit ton of time and with enough patrolling you will end matches with one or two gens done max.
---
Thrilling Tremors because its info is a lot more reliable than BBQ (because it doesn't have a 40 meter range and instead shows you which gens are currently being worked on) so you know exactly where to go, plus it's another middle finger to gen progression.
---
You can also use Infectious Fright, it combines very well with Legion Pin and Distressing.
---
Basically, try to find ways to use perks and addons to maximize your power's potential and create different ways to use it. You can also combine builds to create even more new ones.
---
You can play anti healing Legion with Sloppy, Nurse's and Defaced Pin to completely stop any healing.
---
You can play super speed Legion with Nemesis  and Play With Your Food to always have max stacks which means plus 15% movement speed.
---
You can play Ultra Instinct Legion with Irri Button which makes your TR affect the whole map and perks that activate inside your Terror Radius like Unnerving Presence, Coulrophobia, Overwhelming Presence etc to get the most out of them. Works well with the super speed build because, since you have more movement speed and you can also see everyone on the map you can chain hits more effectively.
---
You can play vault master Legion with Irri Button to break pallets and Bamboozle to vault faster. Works greatly with Spirit Fury and Enduring.
---
Legion has a shit ton of perk/addon combos and offer so many different ways to play them that you will never get bored. Don't let this sub take you down, Legion is neither nor low tier nor the worst killer in the game. Far from that. He definitely takes more time to master but when you do, it's gonna be a bloodbath.

I agree with most of the people in the comments, I only go for hook saves during endgame collapse if it‚Äôs one of my buddies, and even then I don‚Äôt do it that much.

The 2 killer glitch now bugs out the game and messes with killer's powers. Example: Huntresses hatchets fall straight down when thrown, Clown's bottles dont create cloud of gass and sometimes killers switch abilities or get none at all.

It‚Äôs a toxicology behavior, yes.

Yeah but Save The Best For Last works well with most m1 killers, his power is just too straightforward and he needs a perk that makes his power truly special with some interesting builds (sorry for the English if i misspelled something)
---

---
I main her because she is fun to play but you do not get rewarded for playing her. You can get 4k and still only get 21k BP. If you want to get some decent medals/BP on her you have to ignore your ability which makes her very boring to play.
---
Well yeah I‚Äôm playing to grind BP but I never said not having perks was a problem. Just people like you making it a problem as i haven‚Äôt played as much as you....
---
No that's what unbreakable is for
---
Oh no you misunderstand me. I had noticed over the past 24 hrs prior to my comment that there was a huge influx of new players that don't seem to be attempting to learn the ropes and are leaving people to die on hook or whos skill sets are poor so they clearly haven't unlocked a lot and I couldn't figure out what had caused this besides dbd being on sale which didnt seem to be enough for the sheer number of new people, I am happy for the fresh blood but no one seems to be teaching them gamr ethics which is bad.
---
The Haste is definitely unnecessary. By the end of the Trial, you most likely have already broken most of the Pallets around the map, so trying to survive a chase with a Killer who now has 4% faster movespeed and one-hits is a little much. 
---
I think it would be just fine with the Speed removed.
---
isn't that actually Unreal Engine new updates fucking up the game rather than BHVR?
---
Remove huntress
---
Omg she‚Äôs adorable
---
I do like the aura reading capabilities of keys add-ons, makes it so you don't have to bring certain perks lol
---
Looks good
---
Dbd players when there are new players buying because of media properties like Stranger Things: nice, now i can be toxic to new players so they will never play again!
---
Dbd players when kids take the game up because their fave streamer took it up: ugh. Now i MUST be toxic to new players so they never play again!
---
So this is what REALLY happens when the entity consumes your soul..
---
I agree with you at some degree. On the other hand, isn't it logical to have something like this as last resort to get you out of sticky situations?
---
He really just needs a re-work or something else added to his power.
---
His lore states that he makes all kinds of concoctions/gasses/anaesthetics, so why not add more variety with his Add-Ons? Maybe let us cycle through a couple different Bottles with different effects? 
---
He is a very boring Killer, and pretty much only succeeds at ending chases fast. Even then, you‚Äôre better off equipping Spirit Fury/Enduring/Brutal Strength because you‚Äôre going to be eating a lot of Pallets anyway.
---
It really depends cuz if u want all the perks and cant buy any chapters then u can buy them there but don't spend any shards to buy bloodpoints it's not worth it
---
I do see where you're coming from but this would mean unbreakable would be useless
---
You probably crawled away from where the killer downed you while he was hooking or chasing other survivors so no, you shouldn't be able to get up.
---
Perhaps the option bleed out faster if anything, only when you are the last survivor in dying state.
---
Oh that makes sense. But if I‚Äôm planning on leveling Bill, it‚Äôs probably not a great idea to buy borrowed time from the shrine right?
---
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Are you on PS4?
---
I've seen people from the age of 5 to 90 play this game.
---
But more
---
Nah man this isn‚Äôt about the quality of the perk itself, it‚Äôs about the archives challenge ‚Äúcomplete 4 generators with dark sense equipped in a single trial‚Äù
---
I'd rather have less people with less toxicity
---
I feel like this is aimed at me from 6 months or something ago, I was an adolescent Dwight trying out the so called flashlight
---
I cornered myself and tried to flashlight the killer as he walked towards me 
---
It didn‚Äôt work very well
---
Instead of going in for the rescue when a killer is camping the hook go do gens, you can get 3 gens done in the time it takes for 1 guy to die on a hook. By going in for the rescue you do exactly what the killer wants. His tactic worked, you got boned and now you try to play it of as poor gameplay...
---
I know we are going to get the standard: *"But everyone should have fun!"* bullshit replies. But really: *"No, not everyone has fun in these types of games, not unless you can live with loss from time to time."* The killer has no rules, he can do what he wants, kill who and however he wants, he doesn't need to ask for permission just like no killer should bitch about how fast gens get done sometimes. That's just how it is...
---
I'd say 1-3 seconds of direct contact from flashlights. Im unsure but i'd say that is accurate.
---
I still see people trying to do this well into green and purple ranks. I'll never understand why.
---
Ninja is a veteran in dbd btw
---
I heard you should always stay on the current Version your started with because a new update could mess up your whole project. 
---
I still don‚Äòt know why they update the engine.
---
It takes 15 seconds to heal when you could be doing gens waiting for teammates to come to it and heal you after you do the gen getting the gen done and healing faster than self care bonus points if you have resilience, the comment is true and you are defending one of the worst perks in the game
---
You actually care about fake internet points LOL
---
Noob3 has matured a lot from back when he has banned, unlike Ninja he whines all day and calls killers trash for hitting him.
---
Yeah I learned quickly that day, I think that everyone should at least try a flashlight in the yellow ranks to learn how to use it a little bit because cornering yourself with a flashlight anytime later than rank 15 is a death sentence
---
my mates did this with a pig and bubba 
---
its iconic to say the least
---
I mean I personally don‚Äôt heal and just run resilience and I escape 80% of the time through exit gates even if I did all the gens while my team was being a bunch of asshats
---
That would suck for people who're arachnophobic LMAO
---
They're reverting him to have a 90 degree flick.  BHVR is just on vacation right now so it'll be a while before it happens.
---
I think given what we know now about the Yamaokas, more likely it was pressure from The Entity and Oni‚Äôs dormant rage.
---
I found that all the clown needs really is movement speed more then anything else, every perk that makes him do stuff faster is usually good. That combined with his bottles and Bamboozle to cut of loops he can be pretty hard to shake of that way.
---
What the clown lacks is playfield dominance, he has nothing to prohibit survivors from doing gens or to really track 'em down other then his own vision and is only a threat once he has found you. But once he has found you he can be a real hard ass to get rid off!
---
Noob3 isn't even close Ninja in terms of toxicity. Noob3 dont call killers names when things dont go his way. He doesn't camp hatch until the killer finds him instead of leaving straight away. He doesn't t-bag only to be downed straight away and screech his lungs out.
---
That‚Äôs debatable. Breakdown only works against tunneling (barely) and calm spirit is bad
---
‚ÄúYou must be Anna‚Äôs little bubby...‚Äù
---
You don't even look close to the window. Sucks man sorry you didn't get out :(
---
He means dropping them too early, essentially wasting them completely
---
It says to "complete" a gen 4 times with dark sense. Meaning you have to be on it when it pops
---
I seriously hate the toxic ones, I had this one guy who used this one loop constantly and by just chasing I couldn‚Äôt get him, had 1 guy dead and two on hooks and this guy was being cheeky, taunting me behind a fence with a vault in it. Mind you, I‚Äôm Nurse, first made him think I was stupid, couldn‚Äôt get through using blink so he got extra cheeky, getting closer to the fence because he thought I couldn‚Äôt get through. Surprise, blinked through behind him and down him, instead of admitting his defeat he DCd, couldn‚Äôt comprehend the outsmarting of his outsmarting.
---
wat
---
You could also try and get the killer to farm, which is what I did
---
wat wat
---
He was feeling safe and comfortable, so he decided to stay for a while and tease the killer. Its as simple as that.
---
 Those must have been some long mints
---
Ah yes, fight off POTENTIAL toxicity with actual toxicity. Fucking genius
---
God I'm so trash at this game, cant loop the killer for shit and I'm like rank 8. Like wtf.
---
DDOS ? Is it 2012 again ?
---
I got DDOS'd after I slaughtered a team on Destiny 2 but never on this
---
No its not lmao
---
Lmao sorry I meant months
---
I fucking felt this to the max üòÇ
---
The rank 15 and the rank 9 were with me
---
Bond, prove thyself, iron will, and of course dark sense. Just run to a gen being worked on by teammates and use bond to see if you can solo vs help finish a gen. I would say save if they are hooked close to you and you know the killer isn't going to come straight back (going to chase someone off of a gen with BBQ) and boom now you have a prove thyself partner.
---
i dont really care much for the archives and the missions, and im the kind of player that literally never wants to waste pallets, hence why it took me over 2 days to finish the ‚Äúdrop 15 pallets while being chased‚Äù mission
---
Corrupt is usually used to allow killers to gain momentum to snowball without losing too many generators, or for allowing ripe for killers that require setup (ex: trapper) to eat set for the game
---
I knew something like that was gonna happen because you look behind yourself way too much
---
Yeah I know I was just teasing
---
Honestly, MYC is a perk that sounds great on paper, but is actually bad when actually playing the game. The only two killers MYC is actually good on is Hag, Nurse, and Demogorgon. Maybe Freddy if you‚Äôre good enough.
---
Why? Well because MYC kinda forces you to stick around the area if you want use out of it. You‚Äôre pretty much camping, which is heavily punished by decent survivors. 
---
Let‚Äôs say you hook a survivor and you don‚Äôt want to go too far away to catch your MYC. This wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea, except for the fact that the hooked survivor could be saved in 5 seconds or 50 seconds. That‚Äôs potentially up to a minute where you aren‚Äôt doing anything. And, even if MYC DOES activate rather quickly, the person with MYC can still loop you. If you go against a survivor who is remotely decent at looping, the timer will run out before you catch them.
---
Don‚Äôt use this perk on any killer except for Hag, Nurse, or Demogorgon.
---
Not really I did all of tier 4 in one day and tier 3 in 2 or so days they only take a few games to do and aren‚Äôt that hard besides the sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement because people dc so you don‚Äôt get it
---
Forever Freddy and Crippling Plague reporting in.
---
So my laptop?
---
I think I want it
---
I'm pretty sure when one killer becomes "too reliable" from a survivor's stand point they will complain for it to be nerfed, same with killers to survivor perks when it performs too well
---
Spirit stops loops easily especially if you can predict survivors. But the first thing is kinda true.
---
There‚Äôs already some on mine
---
How does that work? Do you have both actions on the same button?
---
Check out the big dick on the perkless red rank
---
Needs more brightness on this ps2 game
---
He is already going for ochido levels of toxicity and that‚Äôs probably the person he watches play DbD considering how he acts
---
True, but again, it kinda promotes camping. Which is bad because you‚Äôre not pressuring other survivors.
---
I should clarify, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with camping when you have to. However, camping is the wrong move 90% of the time since you‚Äôre not pressuring gens
---
it makes you lose 'cause of a lack of chase time, lack of hit, lack of hooks. So i think we can safely say it's not quite efficient
---
Camping is not my playstile honestly. I like double slugging. First downing one person and going for second so i got 3 people occupied. Any good perks for that?
---
Ah yes yelling at a killer telling them they are trash even if they 4K calling them a camper and tunneler and streamsniper not toxic I guess?
---
It literally looks like the hitbox on the hatchet is twice as big as the actual thing
---
satanic panic all over again as if it were the eighties
---
I ususally only bring my mori when I suspect a 4 man swf with maps, keys, flashlights and OoO
---
I like legion and I don't like legion are the obvious truths here
---
Ninja is ochido part 2 so most likely they will
---
A monstist
---
Dwight: Every time he opens a locker, the Exposed effect is active until he leaves said locker.
---
ahem I would like to introduce shitty matchmaking where as a rank 1 killer I can get rank 19s in my lobby non SWF
---
That‚Äôs that studded thing he slams into people when his wrath is up, right?
---
Classic ninja, look up his don't bully people video.
---
First of all, you should only slug if you down a survivor and you immediately see another survivor infront of you, and you think you can at least get one hit on them. You shouldn‚Äôt slug if you don‚Äôt see any other survivors around.
---
If you want to slug, I think knockout is a good perk to use. However, the problem with this is that swf and small maps pretty much make this perk useless. You could also try Sloppy Butcher. You should definitely stay away from Thanatophobia and Dying Light though. They‚Äôre pretty trash perks that only work on some killers like Plague or Freddy
---
Yeah thats what i was saying? Down dirst guy and go after the other one thats running away/hiding.
---
Now this,
---
This is pod racing
---
Yeah, but DH and especially MoM though oof, tons of toxicity stemming from those two.
---
Oh, then yeah it‚Äôs a good strategy. Survivors will get annoyed by this since they don‚Äôt like being slugged for too long.
---
He probably watched videos and thought hey this game is pretty sick I wonder if it has a sub reddit
---
True but... i mean you gotta get that pressure right. Anyways what are your thoughts on make your choice?
---
Well we got l√©ry's
---
I would‚Äôve stopped and used my last two brain cells and break the pallet, but as Nurse I‚Äôd just blink and hit ‚Äòem there.
---
No. Get out of here Rob Zombie.
---
Man it's obvious how little people play both sides when the best way to buff a killer is "add ultra rare to base kit". Se doesn't need that vision by default.
---
MYC is pretty bad overall. Just my opinion. Gives you too much tunnel vision and makes you proxy camp if you want use out of it
---
It might be just me being paranoid but it is pretty fucking funny how when I kill a certain toxic survivor, my internet ceases to exist. And everytime my internet ceases to exists, its after a survivor kill.
---
Atm my build is PGTW, Thrilling Tremors and stridor on spirit. Number 4 would have been myc buuut. What would you choose as #4?
---
I‚Äôm not defending self care I‚Äôm defending my use of it as I literally don‚Äôt have any other meaningful perks. As I‚Äôve stated numerous times....
---
I didn‚Äôt rush the hook. I was in chase a fair bit away from the hook and the second the unhook happened the killer just dropped the chase with me and went for the mori.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre reading into it more than you need to and finding correlations based on your own experience more than any other data. 
---
Going back to the original point of the post... #fuckninja
---
I remember one time where me and my freinds each took turns as billy to see who could stay in the hill billy chainsaw running mode the longest and i came 2nd 4 seconds behind my freind only because a survivor ran into me
---
I wamt to say Nurse and Jake, maybe they alternate between male killer female survivor and then female killer male survivor
---
Should have just started with meg for sprint burst and adrenaline and would still be better if you switched now with no items and one perk
---
Away from kontroler
---
I....I must do this now
---
Ruin or Corrupt Intervention if you want to stall the game a bit.
---
Haunted Grounds is also good since she‚Äôs good at landing first hits. However, good survivors won‚Äôt cleanse lit totems if there‚Äôs no Ruin against a Spirit since they expect HG from her. 
---
Devour Hope is pretty good on her but it‚Äôs always 50/50 with that perk.
---
Personally, I would either use Discordance or Ruin. Surveillance could also be good on her since she moves so slow
---
Oh yes.
---
pretty good job so far
---
Aight thanks :)
---
So you're just gonna drop this photo here without giving us any details? Could you pick it up? Could you equip it?
---
Seems more like  a case of "Well only two of em left, i can fuck about with this chase". If he did that to every pallet though then a different questions arises, how did he get two kills?
---
[deleted]
---
Console
---
Corrupt would probably be better beacuse mid-late game PGTw and thrilling tremors work extremely well?
---
Ah, a fellow metal jesus main
---
meh it counters the perk nicely, its op as fuck i run it on pretty much every build
---
It happened while I was playing customs, one of my friends did the second killer glitch which I didnt know it was still possible, and we were huntress and legion. This meant that we could share our perks and abilities. When he stabbed someone, I could see everyone with killer instinct as well, same for nurses etc. He had to leave, so he just... dropped his feral frenzy?
---
One use perk that half of the time people miss, hardly optimal.
---
Legion really deserves a cool power, they have a great design when it comes to appearance, sounds and the animations, I just really wish they were healthier for the game
---
What Clown skin is this?
---
Pig: "Watchu got there, Mikey?"
---
Mikey: "Uhhh.. A slushie."
---
This doesn‚Äôt relate to the topic at hand and have 1,000 hours
---
I mean this is funny to me really I have nothing better to do while waiting in my 7 minute ques at red ranks so I‚Äôm fine making sure I don‚Äôt have another idiot with self care healing in a corner of the map instead of saving, just make sure you don‚Äôt become the most hated type of player in this game ‚Äúthe immersed‚Äù and do gens perhaps learn to loop? It‚Äôs really advice.
---
Nice reposting a top post, very imaginative.
---
I wish I could watch his videos but my god is he obnoxious with his voiceover. Ear rape for days
---
Literally me yesterday. A Billy was carrying somebody to the basement. I tried to flashlight save them outside of the entrance of the killer shack. It was a purple flash light and I held it on them, constantly, from the starting point until they hit the bottom step by the lockers.
---
I was like, shit I'm either awful at flashlight saves or he has light born. He did not have light born.
---
Looks fire
---
The possible chance he accidentally goes too far and gets up in front of the killer.
---
In my opinion, yes. The start of the game is when killers are at their weakest. Hence why many killers use Ruin. Though I feel you‚Äôre opposed to using Ruin, so Corrupt is a good substitute. 
---
Once you gain momentum, PGTW and Thrilling Tremors will do a lot of damage.
---
No, Deerstalker is one of my permanent perks because of this. Nothing better than letting a survivor ‚Äúget away‚Äù only to mori them last second.
---
Arachne wouldn't work as a killer needs to be extremely humanoid. Demogorgon is pretty much their limit and doing the vault animation was them pushing it. Devorah type could work but it'd be a let down for me personally.
---
I think your really talented. If you practice you could paint things like killers or things like a survivor popping gennies.
---
Alright thanks alot!! Really appriciate your help.
---
I want to know as well!
---
Kwispy
---
Really crisp lines, Love it!
---
Ok that shit actually looks scary
---
It's sometimes ok. Kinda guestionable. Some killer can just leave you on the ground, cause they see you are a baby.
---
When you start a mori with Legion and they try to push you away
---
Yeah, to be honest I haven't fought enough Bubbas to tell so I just assume it's Billy whenever I hear vroom.
---
When you use a stealth killer and instantly get spotted
---
Can I just get base haddonfield without mile long fences?
---
Yeah, i just want to wish luck to your survivors to ddos dedicated servers. It's not p2p anymore.
---
Awesome! The knife just needs to be a sharpened candy cane!
---
I play legion alot around rank 11 and I dont think shes as bad as people say I 4k with legion more than I do any other killer
---
man, blood warden is such a cool perk. i'm tempted to buy freddy just for it. i know it's not a GOOD perk but still.
---
It's almost as if perks are used as band-aid fixes instead of proper ones
---
What??
---
The difference between the two is time management. Red rank survivors will know WHERE to cleanse and when, and that's what makes the Plague weak in comparison to Myers. Two things will happen: 1) You stay in Vile mode, everyone stays infected, you basically get looped as a shitty M1 killer. Everyone else finishes the generators while you're chasing your target. 2) They cleanse at the furthest outskirt fountains. You can either continue chasing in Vile or walk allllllllllll the way to the fountain, drink it, then walk alllllllllllll the way back to the generators being worked on. Not to mention you have to re-track them if they're cleansed since they're not puking all over the place. Myers doesn't have to waste time building up his power and even while he's doing so, he's actively TRACKING survivors.
---
This is satisfying! Much better than the -
---
2
---
18
---
I keep getting üòê
---
But isn't this a bad strategy?
---
No way, like with the other three they better work their ass to catch mine, no one just gets a free kill. As a Killer your job is to hunt and sacrifice, and so best believe this guy is going to do everything (besides DC) in his power to avoid it.
---
getting to pallets is using it for distance? and dodging hits doesnt work if the killer is even somewhat good
---
Beautiful
---
Just because it makes sense in the scoring system, doesn't mean it makes sense gameplay wise.
---
Honestly, I feel like the ranking system should be adjusted for each killer. It's virtually impossible to get a -1 as Legion since you will always max out Chaser and Malicious because you enter a million chases and win ten million of them. Meanwhile someone like Plague gets a whole lot less since they spend a full minute vomiting on someone before one-hit downing, only getting one long chase done. That combined with the fact that a lot of the killer emblem events are combined (hooking survivors is in both Sacrifice and Malicious, hitting survivors is in both Malicious and Chaser), the system really just favors one playstyle, while leaving the more "fun" playstyles out of the window.
---
His mask seems to be smiling for some reason
---
An Iron Cross ist a Nazi thing
---
I love when otz does this shit with blood warden
---
"ha ha ha I'm such a memer guys, look at me meg just a memer"
---
Then he hooks someone, blood warden pops
---
"Die bitches"
---
I thought of it as a counter to d-s locker hiding.
---
I am on xbox but there is a sale right now so that was what I figured was going on.
---
Oh, I didn't know it was possibly either (is it just the method of switching to killer at the same time or is there a new method?). Thanks for delivering tho lol. That's pretty interesting.
---
Servers are only enabled for PC players and mobile or switch IIRC. Every other platform is P2P.
---
Red rank p350 ghostface here. I dont use anything to do with healing. Tremor/Pop/Surge/flex perk, usually BBQ or Corrupt or Ruin. Down someone, surge breaks nearby gens, pick them up, tremor locks the broken gens, reveals what gens are worked on and where to use Pop. Very momentum-based stall build, the game goes slower depending on how well I do
---
For one, it was a mistake, and I fully acknowledge any misunderstandings it may have caused, and take responsibility for them.
---
For two, it is still a significant issue. I messaged support multiple times, and apparently they're still working on it. This post was made in order to make the community aware of this issue, and to remind the devs that this bug still exists and wasn't solved. A lot of people got this bug fixed with the mid-chapter update, but me as well as many others STILL suffer from this bug, even after it was allegedly fixed back in August.
---
&gt;It's almost as if perks are used as band-aid fixes instead of proper ones
---
They pushed recovery bar to 95% to help players counter slugging. What are you talking about? 
---
Devs obviously don't want to completely remove the impact of a slugged survivor.
---
I don't see anywhere that he was playing on ps or xbox
---
Oh no don‚Äôt say it like that üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
That too is the wheel of infinite 0 xp
---
Gotta love when killer's are blind, a ruin protective billy walked on top of my head and looked like he looked right through me, the ruin was around a tractor so you can kinda imagine how it went
---
&gt;I don't see anywhere that he was playing on ps or xbox
---
Yeah he didn't mention the platform but still worth mentioning servers aren't a reality yet.
---
As a killer main I encounter this a lot, I don‚Äôt wait like this killer did to hit them but I always feel ‚Äúslightly‚Äù bad when this happens.
---
#1 Horror Movie cliche come true.
---
What is ddos?
---
Since it's Myers, they 'bout to get mori'd

---
There's another video clip of a similar situation I uploaded yesterday on my channel if anyone is interested I guess
---
*looks straight up*
---
Blinding Time
---
If you aim perfectly for the killers eyes it takes around 1.10 seconds to blind a killer with a yellow flashlight.
---
Purple Flashlight theoretically takes 15% less time to blind the killer so should blind them at around 0.935 seconds
---
Blindness Duration
---
Blindness lasts roughly 2.15 seconds at base. This can be extended using add-ons.
---
Utility Flashlight increases blindness duration by 15%. This means a 2.4725 second blind with the base purple flashlight

This is so cute!
---
Damn this is perfect film making...look at those toxic inbreds as the momentum builds up you know that Myers will have his Justice...
---
Put this on Youtube if you want a million views
---
Same feels mostly a killer but trying to get my little brother to Survive is the most fun I‚Äôve had in this game
---
Imagine only being tier 11 with 12 days left
---
You cant wiggle slowly. No matter how fast you spin or move the analog stick it still wiggles at the exact same speed.
---
Currently the matchmaking system is broken and the Devs are aware of it. The system they implemented has some issues regarding the rank checkers.
---
The reason a fix has not been released is because the BHVR dev team are currently on christmas holidays but I imagine they will quickly fix it when they return from their holidays.
---
Well its still possible to DDOS even without servers, correct? Cause the killer is the host under my understanding so if you just overflow the router im using, it will just not work.
---
Man I watched his newest video and he has almost no clue what he‚Äôs doing. It‚Äôs better to actually help him out and be nice so that we get actual new players to DbD instead of feeding into the toxic stereotype we‚Äôve built for ourselves. He may not know everything the game has to offer and that‚Äôs fine. He started casually playing the game a couple weeks ago and as far as I‚Äôve seen has pretty much only been playing survivor, if we want to shed our toxicity it starts with welcoming new streamers and players and having a better influence, rather than building a circle jerk here and saying ‚ÄúOh HaHa NiNjA bAd, FoRtNiTe BaD‚Äù we should rather join his stream, give him tips and help him so we can better our community.
---
I was surprised too! The only explanation as to why seems to be that the generator somehow fell through the roof!
---
&gt;Reply
---
At the end of the day, nobody here can say what any random killer you meets find fun. Maybe he was having a bad day, and wanted to let loose some steam by 4 Man wiping?
---
For me, I only use Ebony Mori's when I want to kill as many of them as possible. This only happens at high ranks, usually when I know they are assholes, or just arrogant fucks who are better than me and still get matched up with me.
---
Haven't done it in a while.
---
As far as the key thing goes, I've had lots of fun in SWF trying to organise a 4 man Key escape. Had to use a key earlier to get an "Escape as Claudette" challenge after not managing to escape the entire day.
---
Same applies to the rank 20 killers during rank reset
---
I checked his stream on mixer and it gave me a prompt stated that it was intended for people over 18, so we most likely won‚Äôt be seeing Fortnite kids joining us
---
cause doing bones is disgusting, imagine having to touch a satanic arranged pile of femurs with a skull on top, 1000 bp arent worth it

---
No I don‚Äôt think I will
---
He understands T bags but he only uses them to say hi to other survivors
---
lmao whoever downvoted you must think they‚Äôre really cool. take this upvote to balance it out. Also, we all start somewhere, you‚Äôll be good at looping as long as you take opportunities to loop and practice often.
---
So long as you dont use self care, you're fine
---
its ok until he meets toxic killers, toxicity has to be treated with toxicity
---
He‚Äôs too pure I won‚Äôt do it
---
u/repostsleuthbot
---
You are probably trash because you get no practice
---
Really really cool! Great job!
---
Because why use OoO if  you dont want to get tunneled. Did you even read the first panel?

Make no mistake, the Dwight is the real killer

What's the Impossible Skill-checks Doc? I can guess Unnerving Presence and Distressing, maybe Overcharge and Brutal Strength, but what else?
---
He could‚Äôve seen people talking about him on this sub or watched tier list rankings. I always watch videos on games I find cool or ones I want to buy so he could‚Äôve done the same
---
For now he probably won‚Äôt have to worry about that as he is only rank 19 but if the time comes I fill teach him
---
Don't blink as a nurse in indoor maps. Everyone just hides and it's really hard to catch anyone at that point

ah i forgot the changes to rank reset.... yea the time will arrive. hope you dont meet umbra
---
I was a soldier main in TF2 and joined into many tournaments when I was 13(2012)
---
I was so scared for a second because you almost screwed that up
---
well...its far from perfect...but it will def be hell if Ninja starts playing it...the toxicity would cause...unpredictable things to happen
---
A good survivor group does totems and gens
---
Waiting 2 minutes is an awful play.
---
The best way to activate MoM is either with a team or body blocking a hook
---
Thanks, need the information for my build. Thinking what kind of playstyle i should play (ruin is just boring and rng)
---
Do you usually find other people at the gen you are working on?
---
No ed is a lame clutch perk. If you need Noed to get kills then I don't think you really deserve them.
---
I would do uncorrupted gens until seen by the killer. If a chase would be initiated I would try to get the killer to chase me to the side of the corrupted gens to allow my team to work on uncorrupted gens without worrying about the killer.
---
Thanks alot :)
---
And then Freddy can spam the absolute fuck out of loops to make them unsafe and the only part of the match that was interesting is now frustrating.
---
When I‚Äôm survivor, do I usually find others on the gen with me? No. I work them alone often. 
---
Discordance isn‚Äôt a good replacement if you‚Äôre wondering
---
I miss billy
---
Nah, just beacuse im curious. My build is Corrupt, PGTW, tremors and stridor on spirit. Corrupt for early game and pgtw tremors for rest. Stridor for tracking.
---
I need it so i can possibly double slug or go back to the gen to scare the survivors off. Perhaps fake a phase to the person running away from me while going to the guy hiding near a gen.
---
Aah hahaha know that too damn well.
---
She did not struggle at all,  Guess she knew she fucked up.
---
I actually want more famous people to play the game so there will be less waiting time for matches
---
Make sure to bring some extra clothes with you so that you come into the game with pre-made cosmetics.

Who the fuck is asking for another spirit nerf? They nerfed prayer beads and some of her bullshit mind gaming crap and that was really all anyone wanted. She's fine now.

Can I get an invite? Sounds like something I'd like to get in on. ^^-^
---
Oh, so you played with me then :((
---
I try and flick the flashlight, I don't know how it works. I blinded the killer once tho. I'm sure I just look like a dick spamming the shit out of the flashlight, but I just dont know how to use it
---
Let me tell you what bothers me about this. Ninja‚Äôs fanbase is primarily younger kids. From the range of 10-13 in the high numbers, and these kids are sheep. They‚Äôll play anything that he plays.
---
I play survivor and killer equally, and I don‚Äôt want to be repairing gens with some kid who hides in a locker all game or runs around dropping pallets with no killer is sight.
---
I‚Äôm not going to take pleasure in killing these kids either, there‚Äôs no challenge to bullying some no brain kid on rank reset
---
That's kind of the point though
---
I just bought this because of this post and now I don‚Äôt know what to think since now I always have 2 nostrils looking at me and now I feel like I should have bought the other sword

Look up the "now is best friends" meme. The post made me chuckle. Any excuse for an Otz post is fine by me.

Oh right I‚Äôm just lying. Mkay.

Pls explain how having rank 15 teammates that go down like flies  and then killing themselves on first hook is ez bp
---
Hag main big brain
---
I'm not gonna stand in the way of someone trying to unlock the story in the archives. I'll take the bloodpoint hit for that match. Mind you, only happens for the one person.. I ain't a charity.
---
No
---
Well darn
---
Cuz the killers probably a bad rank as well. Which means you'll get lots of chase points fast. And if he's tunnel visioned like the 90% of bad killers, he will chase the whole game and you can just wait for your team to do the gens and leave.
---
Big oof
---
Because rng is fun in a game where the better player should always win
---
Blood Warden.  
---
It's a teachable from Freddy.
---
That's a feels bad man. But at least you'll learn to play her the right way. Start at the top, stay at the top i suppose. Hypothetically at least.

Nah mate  , not the games im having rn ... my team literally goes down  in the first Minute and then They They either dc or kill themselves in that time im getting one Gen done and when im getting chased  im still depipping
---
Haha! My boyfriend was with me and I kept going 'JOHNJOHNJOHNJOHN!' in panic!
---
Firstly to compare DBD to RB6 and Dark souls is literally idiotic.
---
Both are big franchises. One has competitive esports attached to it and the other is notorious for its difficulty due to the continued coverage they get due to their popularity.
---
Most people are discovering DBD through offers look Game Pass and youtubers like OHMwrecker and H20Deliriois who are not competitive players.
---
Your reply is literally just an attempt to wash your hands and justify the toxic behaviour. "Well it's renowned for toxic behaviour... so".
---
The game in not renowned at all. It's finding its feet now because of game pass, ps offers and now Ninja. Like I stated if you want to keep scaring people off because you cant truly play the game efficiently then go ahead... stick with your 10 to 20 minute killer queues. üëç
---
As for learning about this being subjective shit. Yeah... one arguement wants the player base to grow the other... well yeah... advocates for keeping the player base as small as possible. So who's the shitty one? ü§îüòâ
---
What are your perks
---
Oke good to know thanks :)
---
Oh well then it is BHVR's fault :yellowratface:
---
Try equipping left behind. I love that perk when that stuff happens. Not saying it will get you 2 pips or anything but it should get you at least a safety pip majority of the time. At least it normally works for me anyway.
---
That's probably the most intelligent post i've seen around there.
---
I think I saw this happen on a stream. If it's what I'm thinking of, you should be able to use the left and right arrows (whatever the console equivalent is) to switch characters and that should hopefully free you.
---
Insult you egg *downvotes*
---
This is not really accurate, you can still DDOS a players network.
---
It wont drop the server/players.. just the killer.
---
no.
---
Agreed
---
Actually.. you‚Äôre onto something..
---
Me after I get one flashlight save. I‚Äôll think I‚Äôm a god... and then constantly fail and realise that it was a fluke.
---
Yes this would be great so they don‚Äôt all run the same top tier perks
---
Then why upload it lol Reddit is for quality clutches not full length YouTube vids
---
Was a rank one survivor last season, I'm still not able to do a proper flashlight save. I can blind them at pallets, cuz it's super easy but never ever it worked when he picks somebody up, I saw tutorials on yt, always waited for the exact timing to blind, nothing happens. Yesterday i got downed exactly like the baby Dwight...
---
This is where the fun begins.
---
Quit being a hiippo crip.
---
Well, as a Killer Main this will be definitely the best option. But as a Survivor player I think it would discourage some people to play together, especially these who want just play and not to bully the killer. If it was based like if the highest rank in SWF is higher than the killer then it would reduce the perk slots.
---
Eh, if I'm gonna be punished because I want to play a game with my friends, I'd rather just delete this game and play something else. 
---
  Telling players that they will lose perk customization for playing with friends will cause a lot of players to seek other games that celebrate playing together. The playerbase is small enough without chasing away people only here for swf.
---
The guy isn't even there. They are having fun at nobody's expense, since their assumption is that the guy isn't there.
---
It's like making funny faces at pictures or statues or other inanimate objects. You assume that there isn't anybody actually seeing what you're doing.
---
If not, it's ear rape from the nurse
---
What
---
Literally all fair killer players just want compensation for playing against them. 
---
With your suggestion it makes the game less fun. What happens if you find a 4 stack SWF, they get tunneled/camped because not all can‚Äôt have DS and Borrowed. This isn‚Äôt fun or interactive. 
---
Also it‚Äôs very rare that 4 SWFs are all talented in chases. A presence of SWF doesn‚Äôt mean the killer loses the game.
---
How about the devs just fix match making to begin with, Red ranks Killer and survivor should not be paired with low green and yellow ranks players. It just ruins the game for one side or anthor.
---
Any killer that just reduces your movement speed will be boring, since there isn't really anything to outplay about their power. You just have to play really safe and boring.
---
If you're vs billy, nurse or huntress you get to get ballsy at a risk of betting punished. I can go for a risky juke, run a tile in an unpredictable way. With freddy or clown you know there will be a slow field on your 2nd run around a loop and that's that.
---
Don't worry man, i'm having fun playing this game, i'm just good on how to ignore people
---
&gt; This is not really accurate, you can still DDOS a players network.
---
Very true. 
---
I am not very familiar with this subject but wouldn't you need that players IP to do that? In P2P you effortlessly have access to everyone's IP but with servers wouldn't it be extra work to DDOS someone?
---
Yep, but it is miles better than this

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/egqrv3/just_a_regular_glitch_just_got_stuck_in_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
The main reason is that there's a chance that we will see more toxic behavior towards the killer, more toxic people in general that think they can play and T-bag at every pallet. And of course more tunneling and camping on lower ranks.
---
Ninja isn't a God in Dead By Daylight, he still has a lot to learn and learn how to stay calm and not being toxic. The time will show us, what will happen, if queues would be shorter or if he would be OchiDo 2.0
---
Ok, THIS is the worst suggestion ive heard on this topic. I dont even play with swf, hell, I hardly play survivor anymore.
---
And i like both maps, as killer and survivor, just fricking nuke hawkins national laboratory and gideons meat plant
---
This is literaly almost every post-game chat. It's nothing extraordinary in the DBD comunity.
---
We all know how killer is extremely powerful against solo players.
---
How about the killer's perks become inactive for each solo player in the match?
---
How does that sound? Stupid right?
---
Ghostface or Freddy
---
Imagine facing a yellow rank and only getting 12k
---
Not everyone is there but I did make extra variations for stuff I see a lot of.
---
High saturation/ sparkles means flashy clothing or bought cosmetics in general. Dark red with the 3 red lines means tier 3.
---
Now make killer chart
---
Blendete has truly become one with the wood
---
It looks really good. Nice job!
---
It can be, it does depend on how the service works overall, but normally someone would look for other methods to find a persons ip address. Awhile ago you could get it through Skype. People who had a game name and Skype name that matched were easier to DDOS. etc.
---
A lot of work was put in here, I Love it &lt;3
---
Killer is quite varied but I could do a hybrid of perks + cosmetics
---
Things like frosty eyes universally being a combination of maximum toxic + maximum nooby
---
God damn. Killer players are fucking dickheads.
---
You have every advantage in the game, yet you want to take away the only one survivors get. The ability to work together.
---
Would you like people to line up and get fucked? 
---
Weren't there just posts for adding more ways for survivors to communicate with each other? I know for a fact that adding built in VoIP has been requested over and over.
---
But go ahead, take away things that keep survivors playing. It's not like you need four times as many survivors to dickhead killers in order to launch games. But you dickheads go on and enjoy your hour long queue times.
---
Exactly why I think billy and huntress are the most balanced and best killers to verse and why I want to neck when I verse a Freddy or clown.
---
Did you change your unhook keybind?
---
And as soon as you hit rank 9 or 8, you will consistently be faced off against teams of red ranks. I'm lucky to get 2 kills now. 
---
I love Legion but it gets incredibly frustrating.
---
I'll have to come up with some when I get home from work
---
I don‚Äôt mind swamp. I hate yamaoka, ormund and fucking coldwind farm
---
Unless you run a red Flashlight dont bother \^\^ (i mean 1 sec is like forever to look away so your only chance is to get infront of killer when he picks up a survivor - which also can be avoided by killer or countered by spamming R and dropping the survivor when you hear the steps and think he will get the blind in time).
---
You realise they probably only got objective points and escaped right?
---
just figured out it was the i button, why do they have a button to invert controls wtf
---
I can't tell if you're just being homophobic or just stupid
---
I'm sad you're getting down voted. 
---
Using gay slangs as an insult *is* homophobic and as we work on improving as a society, it's a behavior that should stop.
---
As a killer main, this is actually stupid. I'd rather buff communication of solo survivors and balance the game around better communication altogether, because discouraging swfs will just lead to much less survivors overall
---
I really like Demogorgon for that factor too. Fun to play as and against imo, and engaging in a chase.
---
making the playerbase more pure will bring back a lot of other solo player since the game will be more balanced toward solo teams or nerfed swf teams
---
I like the swamp, fuck Ormond tho
---
I gonna up vote you for being accurate, but also want to down vote you cause the emblems are crap.
---
Very conflicting.
---
I can't belive you all, for me Ninja is just a random fortnite streamer who sold his ass to Mixer, and you guys wants to show his audience toxic AF behaviour to prevent his toddler army to come in the game ?
---
You already prove that the community is toxic AF by doing that, his audience can't get put it in a worse state than it is already is.
---
I suggested exactly that monthes ago but i don't thinks devs want to make the game balanced. They aren't hardcore players of their own game. They don't really understand how big is the swf advantage compared to a solo team, they don't really see the issue.
---
More pure? What, cause swf players make the playerbase tainted? That's some stupid ass logic.
---
Its so Good to have a non heated civil conversation with fellow gamers. 
---
I love seeing such a non biased and educated response from some of our top players.
---
Exactly, this is a dumb suggestion.
---
I bring object and cultural exchange
---
You were 13 for 5 years? Hold shit dude you might wanna see a doctor about thag
---
Kindred is best perk
---
Going up against solo players is how the game was designed. That's why there's so many perks with aura reading capabilities. The point of the idea is to make it so FULL MAN swf have to actually make a plan to synergise their perks to compensate for the buff they having being able to communicate. 2 people going in with 3 perks is barely noticeable, I play with my friend in a 2 man swf and the comms alone gives us both huge advantages because we can plan how to evade the killer.
---
Ok maybe explain why instead of throwing blank comments.
---
I was gonna comment about this. I'm like how the hell do you abuse a pallet? But it sounds like you meant to say wasting pallets
---
Dude shut the fuck up im getting tired of you spamming this under every post with the huntress
---
This is in southeast Pennsylvania lol
---
Now im no baby dwight, but i still HATE using flashlights with a burning passion.

---
Spammer u/LelandWojciechowsk is hiding spam site in twitter post
---
Click with caution!
---
For real. The along amount of times survivors have revealed themselves trying to figure out where I'm coming from is staggering.
---
Not every Dwight is like this!
---
If taking away perk slots doesn't make the game less fun, then letting them keep the perk slots doesn't make the game less fun either.
---
 Synergising perks doesn't work in a game like this. Just because my friend has balanced landing or dead hard wont make me getting chased any easier. Me having we'll make it or borrowed time helps nobody if I'm the one on the hook. Explain how one gains the benefits of exhaustion or protection perks from another survivor. Should we all run DS to avoid being tunneled. Should we all run borrowed time because any of us could be put on the hook? 
---
 The idea is dumb. If survivors are gonna be penalized for playing with friends, then they should be given extra advantages when playing without. As someone else already stated, your idea is just as bad as a killer losing perk slots for every solo queue survivor in the game.
---
Why does everyone on this sub require an explaination? Are you that blind to your stupidity?
---
No CaPtAiN, I hAd nO iDea!
---
I think he was talking about the guy that said
---
&gt; I dont play dbd so i dont understand most of these memes but i do know legion sucks . i would play dbd if i had a pc tho
---
Nais.
---
I know, I was telling him that, that person could‚Äôve done the things I said in my comment
---
You mean a used candy cane?
---
I had my first perfect this week too :)
---
Gratz
---
They definitely need to add a vampire and a mummy. Mr Hyde could be really cool as well.
---
I don‚Äôt mind a 2 &amp; 2 man game. I don‚Äôt think it upsets the balance in a big way.
---
3 man is problematic and 4 man - regardless of what the devs say - completely unbalances the game.
---
With 4 people on comms the survivors control the map, control which gens are done, who does the unhooking and when etc etc and when one player is being chased, the rest hammer gens because they KNOW the killer is after someone else whereas solos often tend to play much more conservative. A huge advantage is that gens never regress. You kick one off a gen at 99% and go chase them, they just tell their buddy over the mic to go finish it. Whereas if I play solo gens can be left to regress from 99% to almost 0% if I‚Äôm the one being chased. Another huge advantage is totems, once one sees a totem they all know where it is. Cleansing all 5 to avoid NOED too is a piece of cake.
---
I don‚Äôt know what the answer is. Smaller maps would help for a start. On a huge map like red forest swf get to control that map.
---
As has been suggested before, there should be at minimum a bloodpoint increase for the killer to encourage people to not lobby dodge.
---
Assigning a player to be "dedicated borrowed tume" does nothing if they are the one on the hook. 
---
 A killer being DS'd once in a match isn't going to make them suddenly believe everyone has DS.  Not sure why you believe killers would be that gullible. Especially if this idea was implemented.
---
 There are many 4v1 games that are fine with player communication without punishing the team for having friends.
---
I know it's never going to happen  and I don't even know what his power would be, but because the Arkham series is one of my favorite games I'd love to see scarecrow. You could justify him as the entity grabbed him after Arkham knight
---
And Crotus Prenn.
---
Used? You mean, eaten on? I haven't seen someone eat it to a point before, usually a stub -- unless some maniac out there bites pieces off massive candy canes, lol!
---
it's not logic or not logic, it's just that since the game isn't only solo or only swf it can't be balanced properly
---
I mean used as in when you lick a candy cane enough that it turns super sharp
---
He played Spirit too much so he stopped using his brain.
---
And if that assigned player with BT is hooked? You open the door to tunneling. If you find ANY BT player, they die immediately. This idea of yours also eliminates adrenaline as a perk considering most probably wouldn‚Äôt use that perk alone. That‚Äôs one meta perk down.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt think everyone has DS. You can guess who has what perks. If you see no exhaustion perk in the chase, then you assume it‚Äôs DS/BT/other. The best chasers need these exhaustion perks. So like I said, if you find anybody that doesn‚Äôt have DS, they just die. 
---
I have very few problems with 4 man SWFs. This sub tends to overrate good SWFs and their frequency. The problem is the chase, not the friends. SWF CAN turn meh players into good players when it comes to gens but playing with people doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre good in chases. 
---
Therefore, if you end every single chase quickly, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether they‚Äôre friends or not, you win. Hence why the fastest chase ending killers are the strongest...
---
Your idea isn‚Äôt interactive and it‚Äôs very limiting and boring. If you want to propose some other form of setback then go for it, but this isn‚Äôt the one.  
---
If you made this post on a personal note, like you‚Äôre failing against SWFs, then I would make sure you played absolutely perfect before you blame your shortcomings on average SWFs.
---
In that situation. Leave. They would do the same thing. üëç
---
As a solo survivor you gotta make the judgement call to be altruistic or not and usually that comes down to the situation, your current health state and perks.
---
You realize you insta down people in lockers anyways right?
---
I always look down at them and nod whenever they get trapped, as a sign that I understand their pain. Then they get a good smacking
---
If the game was "balanced" or "fair", killers wouldn't have Mori, or be able to move faster than survivors. Killers have pretty much all the advantages in the game. Small communication is a slight advantage, but it is nowhere near game ending. Swf are not guaranteed to win like most killer mains complain it is.
---
Ash the centrist.
---
This makes ghostface literal
---
No. As a survivor main I hate that people DC out of frustration because they made a mistake or to further the game. Look after yourself. Tombstone myers is a cunt but it's rare.... work around it or just die.
---
Yea how can they mess it up so hard... It's almost... UNREAL

Did you read the post?
---
This is pretty standard. I‚Äôm catching up on killer challenges now. Started at rank 10, now rank 9. Every game is consistently four red ranks. Every single game.
---
It pisses me off because I‚Äôm rank 4 survivor yet every game I get out with people from ranks 8 if I‚Äôm lucky all the way up to 20. Last night had a rank 20 noob that ran into the basement injured to hide knowing full well the Hag was nearby coming. Needless to say that didnt end well.
---
I click on someones profiles when I‚Äô playing survivor they have 28 hours on record. I click on a profile when playing killer and it‚Äôs 5,200 hours on record. This is not an exaggeration, these are genuine profiles from last night. 
---
It‚Äôs fucking infuriating. I‚Äôm not asking for easy games I‚Äôm just asking for consistency. If I have weak survivors on my side then I want weak survivors when I play killer. If I have strong survivors when I play killer then I want strong survivors when I play survivor.
---
At the moment I get pro survivors when I play killer who know how to get the most out of every loop yet I get complete potatoes when I play survivor. I know everyone says this but in my case it‚Äôs evidenced with the endgame ranks. Consistently 4 red ranks as killer, but when I play survivor I‚Äôm always the only red rank in the game and the survivors are often green ranks. It really fucking blows and makes me hate the game.

I like to imagine other entertainers refusing to work with women because they might be seen as an item. I get that it's a little different when you have a live chat full of an ungodly amount of people constantly giving you feedback, but it's always felt like such a BS reason.

A selfless act in that instance is being hooked second time and letting yourself die giving up struggle points. You decided to cheat the system... that's not charitable or selfless it's a dick move.

I want a tattoo of this.  Can I get a tattoo of this??

I was about to argue so much.

I hate tunnelers and tombstone Myers is a dick but if you identify it early. Get on those gens and sacrifice those being tunneled in order to get one or two people out.

But now you want to agree. And just like that, peace has come to the dbd community.

As an overly altruistic solo queuer, it's not worth it to sacrifice yourself for someone else 80% of the time.

Play both killer and survivor. Best way to learn weaknesses and strengths. Work towards teachable skills, not leveling up a ‚Äúfavorite.‚Äù Maybe watch some videos (I like Monto). Most importantly, have fun. If it stops being fun, try something completely new or screwy. Your goal isn‚Äôt to escape every time or kill everyone: it‚Äôs to grow as a player.
---
Why does that sound like a good place for a map?
---
Good bot
---
If the killer hits you, don‚Äôt drop a pallet or vault, because then you‚Äôll lose your momentary speed boost. A good way to loop is to make as many circles around the terrain as you can, then drop the pallet when the killer is about to catch up to you. Then, while they‚Äôre either stunned by the pallet or breaking it, run to the next set of obstacles/pallets.
---
As a killer, breaking a pallet will make you lose any Bloodlust that you gained, so it‚Äôs good to not break the pallet unless it‚Äôs a god pallet.
---
Get rid of deer stalker and use thantophobia.

Sweet!

Congrats! I just did it 5 minutes ago. I my heart was beating pretty fast and it was the first game of the day. The afterchat was very wholesome, I felt bad but I finally got it out the way.

No.

Ok thanks

Dead by daylight is not free, and if they were able to get to the forum on steam to talk about it, he would know how to spell dead by daylight. Either way he wouldn't type 'ded' definitely a joke. (Can't  say the same for the response tho) xD
---
I‚Äôm relatively new, but wasn‚Äôt he using the addon that makes it so you only have tier 3 and it just takes forever to get to
---
Right killer looks like Ryuk from Death Note.

---
As a survivor, you need to do a little bit of everything if you want to get to high ranks. Just doing gens is not enough, you need to win chases and be altruistic in all of your games.
---
Entity will check the level of Your inner strength, if you are worthy - will open the passage
---
That actually makes sense
---
I‚Äôd rather use combat straps and video tape
---
You have a lot of map awareness perks. You might wanna swap out some for something to help with chases or slow down gen progression.
---
The running theory behind legion is that they were supposed to mimic being a Survivor and disguise themselves as a Survivor, it was too OP during testing and to hit the release deadline they just told the Devs to slap a speed boost, and limit the survivor stuff to an ability.
---
They saw that was too OP on its own so they gave survivors an extra health bar, legion players found a way to abuse this into a strength and they basically fought the players to fix their crap glued together killer.
---
They finally got it to work as "intended" and now they are total garbo. The end.
---
Figured I could rank up from just doing the objective alone. Though I guess it prevents other survivors from leeching off of others and doing totems the entire match.
---
Weren‚Äôt you the guy who talked about ruin being boring? 
---
Ruin is always better unless you‚Äôre on like trapper or hag.
---
Toxic, her song
---
You're not even worng, that was 100% me
---
I never level Discordance over tier 1 due to notification times. I'd ditch Deerstalker for I'm All Ears or Save The Best For Last. Add ons are fine but some good replacements for Tampered Timer are Video Tape, Last Will, and Bag of Gears since they aren't Very Rare
---
The flying killer is pretty specific though. They would have to change a lot of maps to make that work. Lots of trees in the way and I'm sure maps like haddonfield get really weird
---
Mhm, it is boring. A perk thats mainly rng whitch i try to avoid (keyword try).
---
Honestly I had little idea what bloodlust was until now. Figured it was a movement speed buff activated from long chases but didn't know how it deactivates.
---
Pretty useful info, thanks.

It‚Äôs still used for dodging attacks no matter if it‚Äôs inconsistent so distance isn‚Äôt its only use.
---
You're lucky he didn't have NOED.
---
I reckon you‚Äôve nailed that approximate %, sigh.
---
Reading this post and comments made me realize...
---
I basically hate every map that isn‚Äôt Autohaven or MacMillian themed. Badham is alright I guess
---
The build's good but I'd recommend surge on pig. Instead of downing someone, kicking a gen, putting a hat on someone and then taking someone to the hook or downing someone, putting the hat on them and hooking them and then going back to use pop goes the weasal on it. Surge would kick it for you and save you time or to also know what gen people are on.
---
Well Ruin is very inconsistent as its usefulness is determined by the map, spawn of totem and also the survivors. While CI does the job, for only 120 sec, and it doesn't slow down gens as it only stops some from being competed. I would say that it is up to you, play a few games with both and see which one feels best. If you can finish chases pretty fast maybe Ruin or CI are just too much, maybe you'll do fine with just PGTW.
---
It‚Äôs be advice if you weren‚Äôt quite so condescending and missing the original point.
---
Walk and keep an eye out for the killer. When I first started I would run everywhere. Now I just walk and wait until I can see the killer.
---
&gt; Small communication is a slight advantage,
---
it removes every choices survivors have to take regarding game management : unhook or not, which gen to do, when it's safe to rush gen, when someone is down under a pallet or not, which one of us should unhook in the basement regarding our perks, in which side of the map pallets have been broken already, where does the key have been dropped, where did my teamate found the hatch, who is the killer ? is he chasing someone already ? In which side of the map ? Did my teamates already guess which perks/addons the killer is using ?
---
And a lot more guess or choices a solo survivor have to take which make the games extremely more difficult to manage for him than for a player in swf.
---
I think that might've actually worked before I read your comment. But I really appreciate it. :-) Either it worked, or I had a single item suddenly that I somehow saw as already purchased... But I think it somehow made the last item purchase-able again so I could complete it.
---
A bit late for that now. B I‚Äôve moved on to nea anyways. C I‚Äôm still trying to find a perk that better helps the survivors. I just got borrowed time from the shrine so I‚Äôm figuring that‚Äôll help.
---
Have you played SWF yourself? This is just all-around horrible suggestion. Perks are the biggest game changers in this game. They bring variety and different kinds of enjoyments in to the game and taking them away from players is insane.
---
Rebind your keys
---
I can finnish chases fast. But i do like it when there are more people in a cluster. So is CI better for me?

Thx, im a surv main but i have to say It noed is not op and not toxic
---
What would of been cooler would of been to not show his face, kinda ruins the mystique
---
Best strat 2019
---
That‚Äôs a new one for me. I‚Äôve personally never seen it. How did the game end? Did someone have to DC?
---
If you have the game, you probably know who it is, so you probably searched on him, seeing this
---
The problem is not that they need a rework, we all adress that. The big issue is What kind of power would they have instead? Devs have mentioned that a disguise mechanic not only would be incredibly hard to implement, but even if they pulled it off, comms and SWF would have the same level advantage that they have agaisn't trappers
---
YESSSS OLD LAURIE! Fucking badass
---
I don't get this
---
Don't swing or use Bubba
---
No killer in this game needs a nerf considering none of them are viable, but would sure be nice to get a redesign to some gameplay elements to have a more fun experience as survivor.
---
*Then again* they still haven't fixed chase music, sounds in general, basement bug still happens apparently, and matchmaking is still broken, so meaningful balance changes might happen, uh... arounmd 2027, maybe.
---
Who was stupid enough to decide to show his face? Now he's not scary anymore
---
Typical Leatherface main
---
What do you mean by never?
---
It does get updated, just not right when the Shrine changes, because that is in the middle of the night for the active editors.
---
Did it first try on the first day against green rank babies
---
Say what you will about Doctor, he is a Bloodpoint machine
---
The serum becomes nothing after the event all you got to do is hope that it remembers you have serum for next year
---
Im all ears is also pretty good. Is it any good on spirit?
---
Had a SWF team last night running 3 flashlights that just swarmed the moment I downed someone. It turned into a 4K with 5 gems left because they would stay so close.
---
Why you shit talking my boy detectives hunch, that's a great perk
---
Never said it did. Was just responding to OP‚Äôs post as to why tombstone Myers doesn‚Äôt pip almost ever
---
As far as the shop goes yes they will stay
---
The cosmetics will remain purchaseable with cells forever, the serum will expire like a week or two after the rift closes.
---
I have tomophobia and arachnophobia so that would be double trouble
---
X is my dead hard. Oh well
---
Hell yeah (look at my flair)
---
That‚Äôs not how flashlight saves work
---
Play both sides. Dont focus on a single player as killers. if he is good, let them be and go after them when they have no resources nearby. As survivor you need to learn how to loop effectively and how to use pallets efficiently. I would recommend you not to use the meta perks of the game (with exception of ruin) since it can make you learn faster to deal with loops, genrush, building pressure and track efficiently.
---
I'm with you - I'd rather stay at higher ranks without ruin than let it carry me to the low ranks
---
Not that it seems to affect matchmaking anyways though lol
---
‚ÄúStream snipers‚Äù
---
Aka bbq and chili
---

---
I believe the serum hours away after the rift closes.
---
The skins you can get with it will provably come again next halloween though
---
Shoot, thanks for the info very helpful!
---
Being without ruin teaches you how to apply alot of pressure and make the survivors feel unsafe. I like CI beacuse it makes it so the survivors only have 4 gens to work on at the start so i can pressure all 4 easily
---
Got it, thank you. I dont know why I couldnt find that in my earlier search.
---
He made racist jokes 10 years ago, so Twitter has been trying to cancel him ever since.
---
I feel so good when i hit like 10 greats in a row while the game is just spamming skillchecks to make me mess up
---
Yea .-.
---
Finish four gens in one trial
---
Not impossible but everyone finishing gens without me
---
Get 5 great skill checks with this is not happening in one trial
---
  Had to run no mither because I can't just get hit once and not get hooked
---
  People getting mad at me cus they're running well make it
---
  People geting mad at me for running no mither saying I'm costing them the game
---
 Three times I had almost got it someone else had finished a gen across the stage ending the game
---
I can't use the flashlight at all. I have tried so many times, is there a trick to it? I've even used it on a cloaked wraith, what am I doing wrong?
---
A whole minute? Now that‚Äôs broken. 20-30 seconds.
---
Their original kit allowed the player to chip away at the deep wound bar with each successful stab which ultimately allowed killer-players to focus down survivor-players one at a time. 
---
It took 3 or 4 additional stabs after the application of DW to down a surv. Frank's Mix Tape originally made it so DW would remove one or two stabs from totally depleting a surv's dw timer. 
---
This doesn't include the killers using a moonwalking exploit which made it so a survivor's deep wound timer would run down in chase. This ultimately led to the dev's initial rework so DW wouldn't run down at all while in TR. (RIP Moonwalking Pig)
---
Now the DW timer doesn't run down unless the surv is stopped and not being mended. DW is what activates when borrowed time activates now as well.
---
Aww man this has me written all over üò≠üò≠
---
They were the most broken killer when they launched as they were incredibly weak against a coordinated team but absolutely busted in a 1v1 chase. They then received nerf after nerf so now they are an annoyance to play as and against.
---

Hook two people in the endgame with no one escapes death, it didn't say kill and previously when it said sacrifice you just had to hook them; nope you're an ideot for not realizing we meant it as an alternative
---
I don't have to wonder how much more $$$ they make from selling skins than fix the current matchmaking issues... They will always choose money first. I don't they'll fix those known issues anytime soon.
---
Skins and gameplay are different things. You can‚Äôt expect the skin design team to do nothing or help the gameplay side. They work together doing different things. So that‚Äôs a poor argument

---

---
you are so clueless from the game mechanics and what is important regarding survivor side.
---
The number of post in this sub talking about the issue of being one hooked 'cause everyone though an other player would go for the save just prove how dumb your first answer is for exemple.
---
Most of the time people manage to unhook 'cause they do the right guess, but it's still a guess. Sometimes they are wrong and we give a free hook state to the killer. Sometimes we guess right but we didn't know the killer was camping so we left the gen and waste time for nothing since we can't safely unhook etc...
---
You're like a child who can see further than his nose. You don't understand yet all the implication of the slightest share of information your teamates give you.
---
The problem isn't that you still don't understand all that, the issue is that your mind is so close that no one can learn you anything.
---
For anyone with two functional neurons and who is used to play solo and used to swf as well, it's so basic knowledge that it seems a waste to even detailed all the difference between both play.
---
Fixed chase music? What?
---
It seems to go the other way too. I'm a rank  7 survivor right now and played about 5 matches yesterday.  Of the 3 other survivors and killer, I only saw two greens I think.  Everyone else was yellow or brown.  Blew my mind.
---
Nerf  worthy or not, you can‚Äôt tell me she‚Äôs enjoyable to go up against.
---
I‚Äôve heard that but on the Q&amp;A stream, they said that they were still looking into it.
---
Is the picture on the right actually what they showed? Of so, that's disappointing.
---
Movies like Friday the 13th I feel pull off unmaskings perfectly for the character they're portraying. But a character like Michael Myers I feel is a lot more terrifying due to the mystery of what he looks like considering there's nothing supernatural about him.
---
Uhh, carry music, my bad.
---
And then you leave the gen and it explodes randomly because a skill check started 0.1 secs before you left the gen
---
*cough* there's actually.... *cough* one more panel but I don't know if I can post it here lol. (on my Instagram .////v////.)
---
I like to play Dwight vanilla style. It reminds me of the good old baby Dweet days.
---
Thats fair
---
I win and survive more games as a solo queue player than I do when I'm playing swf. I get you killer mains absolutely believe that all swf games are extre.ely toxic and unfair, but they're not. It's just people wanting to play a game they like with friends. As I already stated, punishing them for doing so will drive them away from the game. And queue times already show this game doesn't have a big player base anymore. Losing all the swf would be a sizable impact on the dbd community. 
---
 But at least then your one game every half hour will be balanced, right?
---
Imagine escaping with 12k points
---
Wait. Ur surprised that BHVR screwed something up? 
---
U must be new here
---
Looking at that tiny center point of light right in the eye sockets of Myers for nothing is frustrating.
---
The best one I‚Äôve seen is that you can place other Legion members in lockers and you can interact with a locker to hide in it and switch to another member. 
---
People mostly want you to actually utilize all 4 members in some way.
---
Unlearning old flashlight is hard. I relearned it three times. Now I just don't get it and keep trying old methods.
---
At that same zone. It's basically free to get to that rank so long as you can hit skill checks and rescue people. It feels like looping is my weakest point but I also lack any exhaustion perk and DS which seem required.
---
Killers and survivors from rank 20 up to rank 16 are an interesting case, as the MM is too preoccupied with just getting them to a lobby that it will stick them wherever, just to make sure they can actually play the game. 
---
I can understand why BHVR is doing it, but i do question how a white rank survivor is gonna enjoy getting stomped by a red rank killer, and how a white rank killer will enjoy a 0 hook game against red rank survivors.
---
in the movie they only show the side of his face, this photo op is posting its a behind the scenes pic, its not canon
---
That's because, considering he now plays with women, it IS a BS reason. You can play withba woman and not flirt. It's easy. Myself and thousands of dudes do it every time.
---
no, its not, thats a pic taken behind the scenes, in the movie u can only see the side of his face and the damaged eye, in a really thight angle
---
This wont change anything at all and will just make people who do play with friends play less. Perks arent what makes SWF better than Solo, it's the communication. I can guarantee you that a 4 man SWF group that takes no perks will still do better than your run of the mill solo survivors.
---
Theres no real way to punish SWF groups other than to give solos more ways to communicate and then buff killer appropriately. The problem is that that's going to be so hard to get right without completely alienating part of the player base. 
---
To put it shortly if you punish people for playing with their friends in a way that doesn't actually change anything is just gonna make those players want to stop playing.
---
Whilst I agree that killers deserve some compensation for playing against a more difficult team with comms(swf), I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary to limit/reduce amount of perks that survivors can run.
---
I mainly play in a swf group in red ranks, and like many other swf groups, we only play for fun and to try out stupid things we wouldn‚Äôt be able to do in solo que. It‚Äôs easy to complain about the bad swf groups who are playing just to win, but a majority of groups play to try out stupid things with friends and to have fun. You‚Äôll find a majority of these groups are over-altruistic too. 
---
Also I think with such a change to mechanics of swf, many players would stop playing the game or play less often than they do now. To many people, this game is a lot less enjoyable without friends, and while they still can play with friends with this change, it wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as fun with the reduction of perks. 
---
I think the reduction of perks is not a necessity. I think the killer should just be granted more bloodpoints for playing against a swf team. 50% more for a 2 stack and 100% more for a 4 stack would make it more encouraging for a killer to go against swf. It would still be a challenge but it would be rewarded no matter what.
---
I keep screaming where is my jungle gym? F I can't loop F I can't loop F. F. F. It's my biggest weakness and it feels like the only thing left.

Oooh great idea!!
---
Last night on ps4, i was playing a pretty decent game as the hag for how drunk i was. As it gets down to the last survivor, i have located the hatch and trapped the grass around it when i catch a glimpse of the shirtless david whos been t baggin me all game. He runs towards me, t bags and the game goes back to the campfire. No error msg, no daily progress. Like the game never happened. Im not saying that the salty shirtless david somehow sabotaged my game, but it certainly felt that way.

QandQ?

A pure scooby doo clone would kill this game

The way you play chases confuses me
---
Are these teams and how many people are on them decided at random? If people have been complaining about the bugs for 3+ years, surely whoever the head is could make bug fixing more of a priority instead of deciding to pump out more and more content?
---
From my own personal experience, Ash needs to shoot straight up from his current point

You might get new cosmetics but you will probably never get new maps. Most you might get is variations like with the preschool.

Even Pig who is the fully licensed killer with the most cosmetics hasn't gotten a new map ( I technically don't count ghostface considering he's only half licensed)

I swear to god the number of times I have to yell at my friend for sticking his neck out for some of the most mentally disabled players in the game is staggering.

this is probably the most balanced chapter ever

people are saying overboard is op which it isn't true hex perks should have huge effects so they have a reason to be destroyed not just mild annoyance like the third seal and huntresses lullaby
---
Why the fuck are you asking here?
---
imo, they are not comparable, ruin buys u time, ci buys u space, if u want less map for patrolling early or set a 3 gen for late then ci is better, if u want passive gen slow then use ruin
---
Serum will disappear 2 weeks after the rift closes. The items you can purchase with it will be in the store to purchase with cells forever.
---
Get him, girls!
---
I feel like I have to go for the save, just because it's like im leaving before the game is over
---
Yes I do, and that's how I know how strong it can be. The problem I personally find with that argument is 9/10 times the perks swf bring are all the same ones, DS, Borrowed, Dead hard, adrenaline, some few between but that's generally the go to load out, in my entire time playing I've maybe seen one group running"fun perks".
---
Pgtw would work good with ci right? Due to pgtw starting to snowball after the firsst hook whitch ci makes sure that you get fast and many of due to only 4 gens during 2 mins.
---
But Santa.. drinking fence hopping and drinking from a hamster water basin.. that don't seem normal
---
This is sucha good idea, in facct so good you had to post it twice
---
NOED on Myers is a serious bruh moment
---
There's gotta be the original source somewhere
---
Doesnt he rage at basically every game? From what I've seen
---
He‚Äôs not the best killer, but I like him. In fact when I use him he helps me rank up real quick. I think him and the wraith are known to be good for pipping. Also him and wraith almost always guarantee a first hit. He works well when the team is clumped together cause you can really slow down the game if you get everyone mending. And sometimes they won‚Äôt bother healing so you can down them quicker. His main weakness is getting that second hit. Like any M1 killer with no traps he has trouble stopping loops, so you need to mind game a lot.... A LOT.

They allegedly did. But this is clearly still fucked

Lol its fine, just pointing it out. As long as the content inside is good lol
---
ci does nothing to get u a first hook fast, as i said it only makes the map "smaller" if survivors play well u may not get that hook, for combo with pgtw ill try something that tells u what gens have been worked, for example TT, surveillance or my favourite discordance
---
I think it‚Äôs mainly cause every person he kills besides like the last 1-3 in the final minutes of the movie he goes stealth and chainsaw doesn‚Äôt fit his sneaky vibes
---
 Other than that is a more specific issue: there have always been complaints
---
Already using tt. I main spirit so pretty easy to catch them. CI makes it so the survivors get a smaller area to work with/in. Making it easier to find people and slug. Tho i would really want to hear what i should use as my #4 perk.
---
Dracula killer, Van Helsing survivor
---
Yeah, Stridor is a bit of an odd choice. Maybe replace it with PGTW for even more gen slowdown, or some perk to help you with chases, which will be an issue for Legion. Enduring, Bamboozle or Brutal Strength could be good choices for that.
---
I guess that may be why it doesnt feel as good for me lol. I only have it level 1 sp I dont go much faster.

Omg the archive challenge to blind the killer 4 times was the worst. Thankfully I found a fun killer to help me get 3 of them.

Then I needed to do it again and SAVE SOMEONE FROM THEIR GRASP?! Realized it didn't say flashlight, so I used one of my last fire crackers ‚ù§Ô∏è

Please fuck off to your safe space and never get out of it again.

You're supposed to blind the killer when he can't react to the flashlight, like when he's vaulting a window or breaking a pallet.
---
Quick and Quiet.
---
I understand your view point but it's the sweaty ones that break the game, and unfortunately I come across them much more often. It's like saying a majority of spirits didn't run prayer beads so we shouldn't nerf it because it's only a handful of players who abused it. But those who did abuse it, abused it hard enough to warrant a nerf.
---
There's already been talks about buffing solo players, which is why I made this post to begin with, because I've not heard talks about even compensating the killer for going against a bigger challenge. Giving solos communication I still feel is the wrong way to go about it, because this is intended as a Survival horror game, but the role of Survivor ESPECIALLY in swf is a joke in terms of actually being scary, that would just turn every game into some sort of E sports, which is not the reason I enjoy the game. 
---
I do like the idea of a blood point buff but it does nothing to killers who want to pip getting stomped against a full team, unless they do something to remedy the point system. 
---
Again this is an idea not a message to the devs as a cry for help.
---
The most important thing is to abandon stealth. If you rely on it too much you end up flopping in chases, so I recommend instead of hiding when you know the killer is close, just try running and let them know you‚Äôre there. Sure, at the beginning you‚Äôll die a lot more, but it‚Äôll help teach you the basics of looping. Just try your best and eventually you‚Äôll get it down.
---
so now playing in the smartest way u can is toxic oh I see
---
Try getting an item on another bloodweb or maybe play a game. I've had this before but can't remember what happened I only remember it was resolved easily.
---
if ppl miss it half of the time then they suck as long as ive played nobody has missed it
---
I had my first version of this yesterday as a survivor. Was weirdly annoying but I got out... üëç
---
Has someone done a YouTube video on it or something?
---
then u are fine, pgtw+tt is enough slowdown for u, u will know exactly where to kick with pop, i personally wont waste more perk slots for gen slowing, add some oneshot perk maybe?
---
I have played plenty of survivor. Never played against an iri though. Ive used a good few of them, though, and get much less backlash than NOED. I feel its more like bad people use NOED, but I dont think using it makes you bad.
---
My dead hard is R3. There's also L3, square or whatever they're called on Xbox. There are enough buttons.

---
Nea players can reach rank 4? New to me... :o
---
That's good
---
Make your choice? Got that one unlocked a while ago while leveling up pig. It takes a full charge to get away from the hook without addons for it to be able to activate. Maybe kick a gen in that time.

üòØ I might come back with more questions later, thankyou.
---
Actually, it is handbook of Network and System Administration
---
Probably not any time soon lmao
---
i just disconnected, because killer and i could not do anything
---
The real question here is why two of them are using Lithe
---
Or you could disconnect so your teammate has a chance to escape.
---
yeah myc is good, i just walk away and use the power to come back right after hearing the scream
---
Why only 3 perks?
---
Nah you go for it! They like all fanart around there! Got quite a few artists in my discord who have started going to it! To each their own I say üòÄ
---
I can only see one
---
What scream? Whitch power?
---
I'd love for them to eventually overhaul some of the visuals and make the game look cleaner, but I'd rather the optimise the game first so it runs smoother on all platforms.
---
Right now, it's a pain to play the Doctor cause the game drops to 3fps every time you shock someone.
---
That sucks though, i'd cop a 10G update too
---
Deerstalker isn‚Äôt very useful. If I were you I would put a slowdown perk in its place such as Ruin, Pop, or Corrupt Intervention.
---
Not to be a butt; if you hate them that much you could try gen tapping?
---
Chaos Marie and Low Roar
---
Many killers just boosted and can‚Äôt take a hard game
---
Fuck everyone in here, you're right
---
I would if it didn't give off the impression I was fucking the generator. Killer would probably tunnel me out of pity.
---
Yeah but Dwight would insta down them *really* ***really*** hard !
---
Chaos marie doesn‚Äôt have lithe
---
myc makes the survivor exposed and scream if u are 32m away, once u hear the scream, u phase walk back to the hook and downt the exposed guy
---
Mkay ty
---
What about on scratched mirror Myers
---
A Nurse‚Äôs calling on Plague
---
I've played for over a year and half, I stay in red ranks and have dealt with swf on many occasion, the problem I have is not with my success at beating them in the past, it is they have the potential to be a huge buff with literally no downsides, it doesn't let people who play it get better at the game like solo does because they always get to rely on their teammates. It's also a issue when smurfers (people who derank to get low rank killers) are in a swf and obliterate newer killers, and it DOES happen often.
---
  As a response to the BT guy getting hooked, does everyone in every game run it? Does it mean the game is lost if no one uses it? No you'd play the game as usual and a killer wouldn't know he was going against a swf anyway so he wouldn't assume who has what perks
---
As a response to DS, no you don't know if people have it, and generally people at higher ranks don't immediately pick up a downed person for fear of getting DS'd so long as the obsession symbol is in the game.
---
As a response to chasers, even the fastest chasers can get crippled by gen speed, unless they slug or are on a huge map.
---
Spirit was Nerfed because of the potential she could do, not because every spirit player ever got a 4k every time.
---
You down them through the floor
---
Is that a problem on PC? I coincidentally started to main Doc and I haven't experienced this issue.
---
The real person isn't in there. They might as well be a bot.
---
They'd probably be a survivor main with spine chill
---
For me to disconnect allowing my teammate to escape -that is a selfless act. You're looking at this through Myers perspective. He was a tunneller, so he got what he deserved.
---
If I had given up and let Myers kill me, not only would both myself and the Meg die, he would close the hatch and continue on like nothing had happened. He would continue tunnelling people for no good reason. Though the impact I made would've been small, it teaches him a lesson.
---
Me too pal, me too
---
What do you think would fix this for you? Just curious
---
Tried that; it ended with me disconnecting and the Meg getting the hatch.
---
"oh, hi Michael."
---
Yeah. I'm sick of the exposed stuff, but even more sick of the no TR + one-shot ability (beit via exposed or otherwise).
---
Yea, you don't seem to get much for running the killer.
---
Thank you. You're a good man.
---
I actually prefer it this way for Myers, while I agree with the issue for Legion and Plague, it shouldn't cater to instantly Mori'ing survivors without hooking a single one.
---
That's right.. was just a joke
---
Chances are that i will go for the flashlight survivor and leave the downed one because flashlights are satans brood
---
It's a noob console player thing. A lot of console players tend to play more stealthy, and they also can't hit skill checks so they find it impossible. You can literally hit Rank 1 with just Ruin and no other perks.
---
And... how would that help?
---
What‚Äôs the ‚Äúthat‚Äù that you‚Äôre referring to?
---
https://cargocollective.com/chrismaggio/Male-Chef-Christmas
---
I think that they didn't completely understand what kind of a rework the community expected. We expected the kind of Legion rework so that they would be deleted from the game.
---
Fortunately it wasn't a sacrifice, I was at full health and limped out of the gate safely, I was just annoyed by the sportsmanship against an obviously new killer who was playing fairly.
---
They could make it so all 4 members are present in the game at once and you can switch between who you'll controll and the other 3 would be controlled by basice level ai that would chase the survivors at a low speed like 3.4 m/s or something. Or maybe this is a shit idea that would never work.
---
That was it! Didn't wanna risk it.
---
Being able to actually fuck the generator rather than just look like I am.
---
Depends. If the survivor is capable of running you for ages, then yeah it's a bad strategy, because you could be wasting time on someone who knows what they're doing. 
---
But a lot of the time, it's fairly effective, and a lot of things in the game encourage you to tunnel to gain usefulness out of it. It's just unfun to play against and seen as BM by others, but there's nothing in the actual game preventing you from doing it and it's not bannable.
---
Yes.

The problem is that they have half a dozen downsides to using their power unlike any other killer.
---
The power at it's core is fine and CAN do some damage, it is just hard to pull off using that power consistently, and VERY easy to get punished yourself if you make 1 wrong move while using it. Which is why I still believe the last patch was still a hard nerf, making the DW at it's core even easier to manage for survivors is not the direction Legion's power needed.
---
If Legion rework actually happens in the future. I hope they give Legion disguise ability just like in the Legion's trailer. It's actually more interesting. Killer powers currently somewhat are overlapped each others.
---
Then you should have let meg die and taken the hatch. It wasnt your time.
---
Ikr?, tryhards who slug should be banned from the game
---
No because that's not a game mechanic.
---
thats exactly wtf im thinking
---
I Know it's the communication, and the more there are, the more communication, the reason I suggest touching the perks is to make them as individuals weaker, so that the killer can keep on toe with gen speed, we can't stop communication from swf but we can make them slightly weaker, this is why I don't understand the swf mentality, it won't make them a weaker unit, but they get upset at the prospect of not being able to drown you in 4 different second chance perks split between 4 people who can all communicate. And if they improve communication with solos and buff killer then people will still leave because then they'll say killer is op, but currently killers leave because of the sweaty swf types, because it's unfun to be at such a disadvantage. Not everyone will be happy with any outcome but remember it is a 4v1. I just don't think this much coordination is in the spirit of the game. And this is a open discussion, I'm glad you're giving a human response because alot of people are acting so volitile about it.
---
Yeah, my heart literally sunk
---
No. In this video he used:

Judith‚Äôs tombstone: for the ability to Mori healthy and injured survivors
---
Fragrant Tuft of Hair: for infinite EWIII
---
Tombstone Piece: like Judith‚Äôs Tombstone, except it drains EWIII to Mori people
---
 J. Myers Memorial: Increases EW stacking
---
As far as I know, there are no addons that do that
---
absolutely! same with those toxic People that dont give the hatch to the last survivor, dont know why thats still allowed
---
I got match maked with a swf rank 20 group and rank 20 killer yesterday. They invited me to the party and these kids didn't know much at all. One guy took a flashlight in and spent the whole game trying to flashlight the killer and kept complaining when it wouldn't work. I tried to tell him it's a really hard thing to learn and to not bother. Well we lost that game.
---
If thats6the smartest way you think you can play when it comes to inexperienced players then you are indeed a dumb dumb. üëç
---
Thanks for clarifying.
---
You clearly didn't read the post. Both the killer and I knew where the hatch was. The Meg stumbled upon it and I disconnected so she could have a chance at surviving.
---
It is a game mechanic.
---
Saaaaave mee!
---
Nice thought out response please alaborate.
---
Then you let meg die and take the hatch. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I play as survivor only and disconnecting is some toxic bs no matter what the situation.
---
Well, what‚Äôs the problem with Legion in the first place? He‚Äôs not fun and pretty much forces himself to be an m1 killer. Making him have a fun power that uses the coolest thing about the killer would fix the fact that people hate playing against him.

People go into games solo or not and have no one use borrowed, it makes no difference, it's just an option, the fact that they would have to then be careful about unhooking instead of just running up to the killers face and doing would actually introduce smarter plays, the killers isn't going to know your a swf unless you make it obvious

This is why I suggested the more swf, the more perk slots used up, because 2 man is still pretty good, I frequently go with another friend and the information we can relay to each other has saved our asses like solo can't. It's aimed at the sweaty 4 man swf smurfers who really impact the game.

---
Yeah, I faced Trapper today who done this challenge with Insidious as well.
---
It is a dick move, but Killer job is to Kill
---
Might be a bot in some other game. We are talking about dbd here, there are no bot killers or survivors
---
Hmmm, after thinking about this for a bit I think the only solution is to nerf legion again
---
Ooohh
---
  
---
Now imagine this survivor paired with a Wendigo killer.
---
Love the perk ideas.
---
All you do if there is distance during a loop and he starts his slam is to run towards and diagonally away so he lunges past you and can't flick you
---
Moral of the story. Down a survivor and but them on the hook. Dont be a dick. Unless you have a mori thats ok in my book, as long as your waiting for people to be sacrificed.
---
YES
---
Which is pretty stupid. Its impossible to do gens or save people when you're the only one the killer chases all game. I should also mention it was a Bubba
---
I'm used to shit heads like a lot of people on this subreddit. I appreciate what you said though. I've thyink enough skin for trolls and think-alike bitch boys.
---
Unfortunately
---
I like the idea that they have all four on the map at the same time and you can switch between them. The inactive ones would patrol a small area and alert the killer if they see a survivor and attack but not down if they come in contact with a survivor. Have it so when a killer switches they can't see scratch marks for 3-5 seconds or put a cool down similar to freddy''s teleport on the switching
---
I‚Äôm going to assume it would require more licensing and direct allowance  of the actor himself. Probably more hassle than what it‚Äôs worth.
---
insidious leatherface, easy challenge
---
And maybe each member gives a different status effect when hitting a survivor with frenzy
---
Frank gives survivors hemorrhage, Julie Oblivious, Joey exhaustion, and Susie blindness until the survivor mends.
---
They don't wanna buff a killer that made racist jokes 10 years ago.
---
Finally, some good ideas coming from the community!
---
Totally photoshopped. You can clearly see the black guys head put on a white body.
---
/s
---
Yes, because that's what it was. If it was a funny homophobic insult that would be something else. At least there would be humor to it. I'm not even mad, just thought it was funny that that's the insult they went with.
---
So do they refund every cosmetic? Or is it paying to start as a different character? What if you liked playing Frank pre rework but Susie has a better power?
---
Lol thank you I needed this laugh
---
That would only buff swf, which works against what the devs are trying to do.
---
And it was used as an insult. Implying negative connotation to a man sucking dick, i.e. being gay.
---
Sp you cheated the system because you saw no other way. See got there in the end. üëç
---
This looks more like your cat is giving a pose for bhvr to use for the next huntress mask
---
THIS. I just let them do it so that there‚Äôs one less person trying to do that fucking challenge.
---
Taking them away puts the game in balance and makes the individual Survivors play smarter instead of relying on clutch perks that solo needs more than swf. And the idea of solos getting advantages has already been discussed by the devs, hence why I'm making this post. The idea of having single perks is to give each person a ROLE like other 4v1's do because a full team has all the possible roles in their aresenel at any given time, how many 4v1 games with built in communication let you be the healer, the tank, the saver, the objective all at once? None, because DBD was never built with SWF in mind.

it would mainly help to make them actually be "Legion"
---
You know, multiple people
---
right now it's just one guy you're playing when their whole deal is that they're a gang of 4
---
Pahaha me too
---
I'll usually try but it rarely works for me
---
&gt;but even if they pulled it off, comms and SWF would have the same level advantage that they have against Trappers
---
Okay?? Newsflash - comms and SWF have a huge advantage over EVERY killer. Even if the advantage really was just against Trapper and a theoretical disguise-based Legion rework (and, I assume by the same logic, Hag)... well, I don't see many people suggesting that Trapper needs a new killer ability. This seems like a very flimsy excuse. You can't balance/design the game around the fact that Discord exists.
---
I always risk my character for everyone else's. Because losing the game is ok to me. "Yatata its about the ride, not the destination, something something."
---
I've been thinking about something about this disguise feature, in the trailer Frank didn't disguised as anyone, he just took his mask off.
---
technically legion can oneshot u with ff, just need a dumb survivor that stands still insted of mending and there u got oneshot legion, just hope devs dont read this cuz they will be nerfin asap

I played a match of doctor in which I had to go afk at the beginning cause some family stopped by.  I came back at the end to the survivors leaving.

I did a good thing. Maybe that's not the case for the Myers but he should learn to not be a dick.

A Spirit using:  Dying Light, Rancor, Save the Best for Last, Unnerving Presence
---
This was back before the Dying Light rework, meaning that her 3 obsession perks all actively worked against each other.  Dying Light requires her to kill her obsession quickly to gain any benefit, but Rancor is just a worse Bitter Murmur if her obsession doesn't survive until the end.  Save the Best for Last requires that she avoid hitting her obsession, yet if she doesn't hit them she doesn't get Dying Light to work, and if she gets Dying Light to work she doesn't get Rancor and if she gets Rancor... what?  Also Unnerving Presence on Spirit is just... why?  Why would you do that?
---
Anyway, 3 gens popped before she downed the obsession (me) and then she immediately rage quit after downing me.  It was weird.

If they made the power recharge start the second fatigue does like nurse, reduced fatigue time and made missing a hit drain some of your remaining power gauge instead of the whole thing he will be gucci.

yes you did hear that in Arnies voice.

You tell them, I concur that getting a get out of jail free card perk and denying the only counterplay it has so you can continue doing the shit immortal survivors would do is fine.

doooong.

Not always but it‚Äôs not the most fun thing so most will try not to tunnel

Pig trapping without losing wiggle on dropping, chasing out another surv that could try to save them during carrying, general slugging, perk stacks and points

&gt;If it was a funny homophobic insult that would be something else.
---
&gt;I'm not even mad, just thought it was funny that that's the insult they went with.
---
You contradicted yourself. But that aside, its an insult. Why are you reading so much on an insult. Just because someone is called a cocksucker for example doesnt mean I BELIEVE that man is gay and thats why I insult him.
---
Not my idea lol.
---
And it‚Äôs because Legion feels oppressive since he‚Äôs much faster now and guarantees a first hit on you, which people find boring. I‚Äôve had plenty of DCs since the recent change because Ruin/Dying Light/Thana/Pop with broken pin and sketchbook isn‚Äôt fun to play against, even in red ranks.

A bit out of the question but devs said that whoever illegitimately tries to go for one specific Survivor / Killer and ignoring everyone else IS a report. Meaning if the person only wants to either secure a kill or wasting time just to bully as a goal match next to match is going to be a thing.
---
You need more practice with the clown if u do that. You need to throw it at certain loop points or throw it above the killer shack, etc. Its all about create choke points and neutralizing loops.
---

This was brilliantly executed and hilariously cut together. 10/10

David has one farming perk, one perk that needs momentum and one that makes him injured the whole game. Difficulty: intermediate.
---
hate when the match starts and the killer starts toxic walking towards us with his toxic ruin spawned in the middle of the corn omg i insta dc dont need to tolerate that bs
---
While idk. Maybe give them regressions too. Frank-Healing, Julie-Unhooks, Joey-Running (but not by a lot), and Susie gen repair

* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).

That's not a contradiction bud, I didn't find his insult funny. Just the fact that what he went with. There's a separation. :)

oh you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA
---
Stop being dumb.
---
I hate playing against legion
---
Tunnelling isn't a perk. Most killers and survivors dislike tunnelling as it ruins the fun for others. We both did a shitty thing.
---
Why is it important which killer it was? You excelled in 1 out of 4 emblems and you need to do that at least at 2 emblems. If you escaped you would've pipped.
---
stop acting like clown requires any thought
---
You should try the game, it's super fun. I personally love playing as ghostface from Scream
---
Prayer Beads needed a nerf lol
---
...Come again?
---
Spirit cannot see auras while phasing so no, but the perk is still fine. You could get an idea where someone is going and phase over there.
---
It's good to be appreciated
---
Yeah, its more useful for m1 killers like spoopyface.
---
I dont even play legion around letting mending go down. More of a tracking build. Bloodhound is pretty good if you want to track blood, because after you get out of your power you csn only see blood for a bit, so it helps if you lose the survivor. Definitely like the speed boost on pallets and such now though
---
Personally I am not a fan of MYC, but Surveillance is a nice perk. But I  would rather combo PGTW with Thrilling Tremors, so after you hook someone you know what gens they are working on, so you go over there and kick it with PGTW.
---
Patriotism at its best.
---
What perks do you think would be good for spirit. I have tt, pgtw and stridor, dont know what the final perk should be tho.
---
If you do all 5 gens and die you won't pip. If you just unhook and heal whole game and die you won't pip. If you do jack shit and escape you won't pip. Being chased by the killer has the same ranking value as the other categories.
---
Its not acting. You are the one who plays him like a brainless idiot by throwing the bottles on your feet. Just because you don't understand how to play him at a higher level doesn't mean that others share your opinion.
---
Message sent!
---
that isn't that effective you know, and that build works on several other killers, do you DC against them too?
---
The issue with Legion is that for them to make that oppressive build work, they need near constant use of Frenzy which isn't simple to do and if done, Legion themselves aren't making any progress of the current game state since they can't down anyone.
---
Is this a running joke from his stream or are you actually serious?
---
It just seems like Deep Wound is such a non-threat. I feel like the ability is only good for scouting everyone else's position and getting everyone wounded.
---
Very well done.

You just got another subscriber. Satisfying to see those teabaggers get wrecked and funny as fuck too. Job well done!
---
I wouldn't use Stridor as it makes survivors sound closer than they are, also you might get confused when not using it.
---
Wraith is my favorite killer to play. Maybe I need to play Legion the same? Like just get everyone wounded and pressure the map using movement speed and wasting time?
---
I like how you out brained the tough editing process by not editing anything at all.
---

---
You‚Äôre delusional, playing Clown is the most sleeper thing to do in the game stop trying to make him seem like a rocket science killer LMAO
---
We need to just keep nerfing the legion until they become survivors
---
People get really heated on here sometimes so I hope you're able to drown out all the nastiness.
---
In response I honestly do get where you're coming from and I do think changes need to come somehow I just dont really know how to go about that without alienating a good portion of both the player base and the target audience. 
---
At the end of the day BHVR is still a business and while, according to their stats, SWF groups dont make up that big a portion of the player base there is still a good portion of people who consider coming to this game because of the idea of playing with friends.
---
Like I said I dont really know what the best way to deal with it is but hopefully BHVR figures something out.
---
It actually helps me alot. You dont even know hoe many times it came in clutch. Anyways what should the fourth perk be in your opinion? I have been thinking CI but i already got two gen perks. MYC requires too mutch baby sitting. Sooo, im out of ideas...
---
Gens being being done while you're being chased is supposed to contribute to lightbringer
---
Delusional? Says the guy who can't understand how to use him correctly. Pfft, stay at the lower ranks kid.
---
When your teammate fucking with you and the killer so you decide to beat the shit outta her
---
Just aim at the floor better idiot. Pfft, stay at the lower ranks kid.
---
Dont play spirit a lot, but i run BBQ, Ruin, PGTW and TT and that has been working out fine. But Spirit is one of those killers you could do fine with even without perks, as long as you know how to play her.
---
I do what I can edit wise without a pc, it's not amazing content but its something
---
How you like vom mom?
---
Either way that survivor is wasting time. You would probably slug them anyway. Either eat the DS, find someone else, or wait it out. 3 options.
---
Cya stupid troll. Get blocked.
---
It's like that is what this post is about.
---
It's not really op, it's easily exploitable as long as you know the maps well. You still Sprint fast enough to never get hit.
---
No, we need to nerf Legion until Survivors can kill them.
---
aim the block at the floor to channel your inner clown main
---
Hmmm, true. Have been noticing that lately. Do you have any ideas tho? Im not sure what im missing in the build to make it perfect.

---
Yes! Please! This is like Dream Witch on Identity V, my favorite hunter there.
---
The best is when its a 4 man SWF telling you before the match starts that they are going to troll the shit out of you and then piss n moan when you sac two of them instead of playing their stupid game. Some survivors really deserve a tumor.
---
Unless it‚Äôs pennywise :))
---
From my personal experience and opinion, It‚Äôs very much effective for me and many others. It forces survivors to take the Thana penalty because healing is completely useless since he can track you with frenzy and can now actually catch up with you and re injure you. The problem with that is if they just decide to not heal and take the 16% and rising penalty on gens, Legion becomes boring for both parties, which is the problem. 
---
Sure, not being able to down someone hurts, but getting that free 1st hit alongside the information the power gives isn‚Äôt too bad.
---
Use monitor and abuse for a 40 meter range feral frenzy without add-ons. Surge allows you to just down someone and kick the gen nearby instead of downing, kicking the gen then picking then up or downing hooking then going back to kick it with pop. Thanataphobia works on him well since you're supposed to keep everyone injured and try to get as many frenzy chain hits as possible. If you're in feral frenzy, when the bar is 99% down you can do a lunge to keep your frenzy from deactivating and staggering you for 4 seconds and in that lunge you can either get more distance you otherwise wouldn't get or you can hit someone resetting the power gauge. Surge and pop isn't a bad idea because you can surge a close gen and then pop a far gen after seeing people on bbq or get 33% regression on one gen because someone was tunneling the gen when you downed and hooked someone.
---
They showed his face in the first film back in the 70s. All these motherfuckers acting like they know better when they've literally never seen the movies.
---
I wouldn't mind this but I'd rather have Pennywise tbh.
---
These films are pretty shit, lets be real. Gore for the sake of having gore.
---
For me, it's important to run Thanataphobia with it, and maybe broken add-ons to further force a slowdown.
---
Yeah I love using his power to gain distance! Especially after you hook someone, go kick a gen and run right back to the hook, that‚Äôs usually about time they unhook, you just slap them all! Also use is perk just for info. Like if you stab someone and there is no heartbeat, then that means no one else is on that part of the map. So don‚Äôt commit to the chase too much because most likely everyone else is on a gen. Slap them, let them mend. I‚Äôm also kinda new so it‚Äôs not the best tips but I hope it helps :D also Make sure you have Hex Ruin or something to slow down the game. Discordance is also good on him and he comes with it. If you can, make sure never to level that perk up, so it updates more often. And don‚Äôt be afraid to run a few addons to make his power longer. The default one kinda runs out by the time you catch up to the second guy if they run in opposite directions :/
---
1)Eat the DS, which is not a counterplay to DS;  
---
2)Abandon them, which is the same as losing the chase every time they find a locker;  
---
3)Wait for DS to end, which is like stunning yourself for 40 seconds, or facecamping a hookstage which isn't really there.  
---
You don't really understand what counterplay is.

Would probably just amount to leaving one clone by each gen - then watching if a survivor lead one away and moving it back to a gen

Why do people DC against billy? I play him sometimes and people love DCing on their 2nd or 3rd hook for some reason.
---
Oh and one more tip. Just like Myers, don‚Äôt pop your ability until you are close for a guaranteed hit. And don‚Äôt do it next to a pallet. Vaulting spots are best, they never see it coming ;)

---
I believe you only needed "this is not happening" equipped and get the great skill checks. Didnt have to be injured.
---
I main Legion I know how it works, I know how effective it can be, I also know how good that build is on several other killers. That doesn't mean you should DC against them. The Frenzy still has too many downsides for this to be consistently good
---
Last thing we need is people claiming that a low tier killer can be this oppressive, or else BHVR will continue to keep their mindset of Legion being in a good spot which they aren't.
---
You could just slug them the whole game, let them bleed out
---
Pennywise is so unique though, boiling it down to ‚Äòjust another clown‚Äô doesn‚Äôt really do him justice
---
This is fucking stupid
---
I thought Thor was a really good edit of Jeff for a second.
---
Swf can give more detailed information on Trapper than other killers. Sure you can call out ‚Äúhey, the killer is chasing me‚Äù but with trapper you can call ‚Äúhey I see trapper. He put a trap on the meat tree, window on shack, and the pallet by the hay.‚Äù Which is more crippling information for Trapper.
---
Me too. Are we sadistic?
---
Insidious on any already sneaky killer like Wraith.
---
Epic
---
And despise the fact that rule is still on report system which literally says under its description.
---
If you're gonna be at it like this then sure, go ahead.
---
id love it
---
but 2 problems.  1.  they have a predator game coming out in the spring, so i imagine some sort of licensing issues.
---
2.  wraith is pretty much predator.  So predator would have to have some sort of a different power.  you figure if he can cloak AND have a secondary power it makes wraith look weak. Sure you can have different dynamics for the "disappearing" act (i.e. stalking with myers and ghosty).

I love the Nurse costume, reminds me of the Roller Nurses in the upcoming Dark Deception Chapter. Awesome art!

He implied that it didn't matter if he was flirting or not, people would assume they have a thing. I wonder if being married has changed his Outlook on that or if genuinely realized how dumb the whole position was
---
Please have good perks.
---
I didn't even need insidious. I just played normally and got lucky.
---
I got *SUPER* lucky and got it on my first try last night! Killer was a new Oni so he didn‚Äôt have ruin. I just played with bond and a toolbox and avoided chase while everyone else occupied the killer and got saves. I spawned on the first gen with a teammate, the second gen was a solo so i used a toolbox to minimize other gens popping while i worked, the third gen did pop without me, the fourth gen was about 75% done when i  hopped on it and i only found it cuz of bond, and the last gen was tag teamed with the person from the 4th gen. Just super lucky to not get chased and find the gens that others worked on. No ruin helped as well.
---
Maybe,or we just like watching people get screwed in an instant

Literally every killer can kill without hooking a survivor.

Thank you. Do you have any specific tips for if you have deep wound on somebody and you want to finish them but you are still in FF? I have been trying to get right next to them while they don‚Äôt have a pallet or window next to them so I can get a good start to the chase. I also have canceled it while falling to overall reduce how the FF expiring affects me. Not sure if there is any other ‚ÄúTech‚Äù that I can use.

both silent Hill and DBD use the same method to add new survivors, massive amounts of fog. This could be perfect for a Silent Hill DBD lore cross over....or just add pyramid head lol

I'm rank 1 surv and get rank 15-8 killers. They usually dc.
---
Or, since he wasn't attacking you you should have done gens so both of you got out? Survs being able to leave is really annoying when you're doing well. You get like, 500ish if they leave vs the amount you would have gotten for my chases and hooking. What he was doing was a strat for his perks. What you did abused the game. He definitely could have gotten a 3-4k but you leaving made him get a 2k-500ish extra points. Kinda scummy
---
Some of the characters are designed for slugging like the nurse and leatherface. I'll slug if I've already hooked you twice early on to let you have one more chance. Obviously not camping after doing it. Hate it when I die too early.
---
As a killer, Survivor and swf player I think adding communication for solo would be a bad idea, the reason half the perks in this game exist is to give information, give everyone the ability to talk and everyone is super coordinated, call me crazy but part of the fun of this game is it's uncertainty. I do feel Survivors who play solo need a buff of some form, in fact there are talks of it within the devs. But I also feel the potential swf have to break the game is kinda bad, especially when things killers have that break the game are nerfed without a second glance (God blink nurse, spirit prayer beads) though to be fair it took a year. If they buff killers to compensate for buffed solos then swf will still complain , if they don't buff killers to compensate for extra communication the killers will complain. I also don't understand the mentality of "if I have less perks it's less fun" because the game is certainly playable without perks provided your not going against a killer who loves to tunnel or camp (this only happens frequently in lower ranks). Just a suggestion and discussion though.
---
I‚Äôd love to see new game mods too ... like one in which you can‚Äôt change your 3 characters perks (only the ones he comes with) + the fourth being chosen among the shared perks between characters + can‚Äôt have the same survivors in a trial. 
---
I‚Äôd also love to see a lot of perks being reworked for variety reasons. Tired of seeing the same perks over and over. 
---
And maps rework. 
---
And less strong loops. 
---
And less time pressure for killer.
---
And bug fixes. 
---
And no more laggs.
---
Hell, even stream sniping isn't there.
---
 I mean, it's a user's choice extreme, nobody's forcing them to, but in most games it's bannable. I kind of like how it's not here, due to difficulty to prove and all.
---
Is this gonna be a thing, that‚Äôd be dope
---
Gangbang incoming
---
Are you able to play killers like oni and nurse on the switch?
---
Yes but they dont know when or what they are buffing
---
You can bodyblock while in the feral frenzy cancel stun so you can block pallets or windows with it. If you get stunned to leave your frenzy you only get the normal stun time and not the 4 seconds frenzy stun time.
---
And yet the white noise eminating still has nothing of value to contribute whilst his army of minions cheer him on from the depths of his ignorance. Also "She"
---
I‚Äôve got a bad feeling about this
---
I didn't even get a safety pip. That's why its annoying.
---
Pc is perfect, not a single bug. Finely tuned vessel.
---
Every time a killer tires this my one of my teammates will just dc.
---
I think a lot of people forget that quite a few grown ass adults play this game, I mean, I don't blame them when almost everyone acts like spoilt children, what with all the tea bagging and abusive messages.
---
Same here, and I‚Äôm sorry you haven‚Äôt had great experience with it so far. But I‚Äôm also not going to downplay how good I think they are because of potential BHVR nerfs. I did the Tru3 and Otz 17 game viability check at red ranks and got 17 4ks so while I do respect your opinion, I‚Äôm standing by what I say that I think they‚Äôre better than people give credit for.
---
Besides, I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre too busy listening to people hype up the Wraith for them to care about Legion.
---
You are a life saver sir. Now I dont have to piss off all the killers i see :,))))

Bubba would be proud. You could also 3 gen survivors anywhere as long as the gens are by lockers.

I don‚Äôt really think DS is that important unless you find yourself getting tunneled very frequently, I almost never use it. However, it is very useful in the circumstance that you are tunneled or the killer is unlucky enough to find you within the 60 second period

Survivors complain about BBQ is insane. 90% of the time BBQ makes kills leave the hook. Lol. Great satire.
---
The only problem about the DW change is that survivors can now run across the entire map before mending meaning you have no idea where they went when they finished mending, before you knew the general area they had to be in.
---
Can confirm.

............... you're literally killing me right now. I'm out. Gotta hibernate to regain brain cells I've lost during this conversation. Good bye.

mmmm... was depip or black pip?
---
You know when a good moonwalk happend when you hear Micheal Jackson yelling in the background.
---
I agree, but the potential to bully the killer is the driving force behind the suggestion, spirit beads spirit was not in every game I've vsed her, but the potential to break the game with the add on was enough to get it nerfed. Same goes for God blink nurse. I feel the same way about mori's especially ebony. They're way too strong and break the game if the killer chooses to.
---
Love your comment!
---
Because a two mans SWF for example will just need the other 2 solos WHO DIDN'T ASKED FOR ANYTHING ! Imagine being a solo survivor casually playing, imagine that there's another survivor playing solo exactly like you.
---
Just because there's 2 player in a team means that both of you will get nerfed for no fucking reason.
---
Even worse if there's only one survivor playing solo, now he's down to only 2 perks for no fucking reasons AGAIN. Are you starting to see the problem now ?
---
I'll develop more just in case: with how fucked up the matchmaking system is, a 3 man SWF will need an already weaker survivor yet again FOR. NO. REASONS.
---
Also: Repeating a particular comment that someone used against you to use it against them in return DOES NOT make you seem any smarter whatsoever, therefore I'm not going to repeat the "Are you that blind to your stupidity ?" part for this exact reason and out of basic respect even tho you'd deserve it.

I think they recently went to unreal engine 4 didn‚Äôt they? So possibly in the future, most likely once the next gen consoles come out so they don‚Äôt have to worry about preformance like they do with the current gens but it most likely won‚Äôt happen for a few years
---
agitation alone IMO.
---
If the door is open and the Killer is carrying someone on death hook I'm getting out.
---
I have a comment that says my new perk list and ruin is on it and no deerstalker
---
Googling their username will get you there

Also, rip earphone users. 
---
If you can somehow make it out, you can hear survivors breathing as if right next to me.
---
Yes but you don‚Äôt chase you just pop out around a corner stab them and leave I was also at Larry‚Äôs so that helped out a lot
---
Um not sure if this would work without being OP or at the very least, frustrating to go against.
---
But if they managed to pull it of well, then this would be a cool concept for sure.
---
My son and I were kicking around the idea of all the legion being posted up around the map with an idle animation (no stain or terror radius) then the player can control one at a time and jump from character to character on the fly leaving the previously controlled to post up in the idle position.
---
Then give them add-ons that give some form of false stain/terror radius, aura reading proximity, or bonus for hits right after a switch.
---
r/stabbygang assemble!
---
Legion did not get nerfed, in fact they received a speed boost which makes stabbing more fun again.

Because of dead hard probably and devs know nobody runs no mither
---
I get consistent 3k to 4ks to. Most of my 3ks being be not caring about the boring hatch game at the end.
---
I know they can be good, but to warrant DCing against them, yea those survivors just suck. I'm also not taking what Tru3 says seriously personally, even though he actually looks more positively on Legion than other streamers.
---
So his power's effectiveness is based on luck and totally independant of the killer's control, what a wonderful idea.
---
There is most definitely something super natural about Michael Myers.
---
Holy shit, someone's actually shipping one of the two canon couples!
---
It's a Christmas miracle!

---
This would be funnier if anyone actually used these.
---
üëå Shut
---
Julie would probably be the strongest. Exhaustion isn't that great when survivors aren't running the related perks, not to mention Legion hardly gets countered from exhaustion perks as is.
---
You can do a lot more damage with Oblivious + everyone being almost always injured.
---
I'm a legion main and sad this is real sadboi hours
---
Are you playing dbd when it's under a thick layer of ice?
---
**ALWAYS** check the locker in front of a downed Survivor. Best case scenario you'll find someone there then it'll be 2 downed Survivors, worst case scenario you lose a few seconds.
---
I'm not going to accept my idea is bad unless you give me any reason to suggest otherwise, or give me legitimate feedback on an alternative. Don't go commenting on discussion posts if you have nothing of value to bring, if balance ideas trigger you I suggest leaving this sub. 
---
Since you have none to give I'll just assume your one of the entitled elitists who believe the game should bow down to their personal fun and not other sides.

Bye.

I thought he was playing while taking a hot shower.

That would work too I suppose
---

oh haha,,, I use Cypress' alot tbh so I figured atleast some people would
---
The game has difficulty finding matches for newer players, so eventually will start pairing them up with other players so they don't have to wait longer in queue. Not saying this is the only possibility, but it's definitely one we've seen happen frequently in the past.
---
Im playing on a switch and taking a photo with a phone... but ok
---
What? Theres more than enough buttons lol
---
Happened to my friend. Check my profile for a video of it. It's a game with a Spirit.
---
How would taking away perks be balanced? 
---
Should killers lose perks for every solo survivor?
---
I just want the Clown from Spawn for a outfit choice -_- gladly pay the money üí∞
---
I baited a survivor in a similar situation once with Billy.
---
They were the last 2 alive, I hooked that Feng and the Claudette (who was really trying to hooksave everyone like I never saw her doing anything else, everytime I found her was because she unhooked someone)
---
Anyway, I hook the Feng, I'm ready to turn around, then I see the Claudette right behind the rock that us behind the hook, so I get away a little, start the chainsaw for like a split second she fall for the bait, I stop the chainsaw and grab her immediately.
---
I had a game where im killer r17 vs  3 3 2 1 lol
---
Well actually i like coldwindfarm too, but i get so many variations of this map, that i'm kind of tired of it too :D

r/thathappened
---
I mean as a noob it‚Äôs one of the worst maps you can get. As a seasoned player you just feel bad for killer whenever they get haddonfield.
---
I‚Äôm new at the DBD game, so...
---
*Whats a nerf?*
---
Then I laugh because I always check lockers before pickup.
---
Can you explain this to a noob a little more please? I put in my survivor and killer data in the notepad; i try to open the script but it jist keeps closing so i dont know what to do from here
---
I did try that, it didn't count it.
---
That‚Äôs good! I‚Äôm glad other people are doing well with them.
---
Yeah DCing isn‚Äôt the answer. I think people just have bad tastes in their mouths from how they used to be since I always see people talking about how they despise Legion. I just think an overhaul of the power that utilizes all 4 members would be healthy for the game and more fun for the killer, even though I personally find Frenzy fun.
---
It might be different depending on platform, i play xbox

I don't think you actually read my post. A 2 man SWF would lose a perk, which by the way is STILL STRONG because I do play swf alot, but the 2 solos would retain their perks. SOLO WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED. Please actually read properly before commenting back.
---
And I don't see how me repeating a idiotic comment makes me try to appear smarter as much as it just makes the op look like tool for coming into a discussion post to spread volatile drivel.
---
They can't hear or see anything. True terror.

Honestly I get fucked in games and somehow the killer gets me right after DS ends and when I'm about to revive myself.

As a Jake main I‚Äôm proud he‚Äôs considered mostly no bullshit.
---
What heart I gave it to the entity to give me inner strength... I still don't have it
---
Now watch the next time you try they dc too. Really feels bad.
---
What a dumb argument. If you are saying old legion was ok then let me explain (and if you where talking about pre rework legion, you really should have specified more.)
---
Bubba is one of the worst killers in the game, his chainsaw does litterally nothing against decent survivors. He slows down when revving his saw so you have to back scratch without add-ons to get a single down, but that's so hard since by the time you catch up, the survivor probably had a window or pallet nearby.
---
Now billy, the most balanced killer in the game. He has a chainsaw that he gets a massive speed boost from that one shot downs you, sounds OP right? Wrong. He loses a lot of his control around 1 sec in, allowing him to curve around objects but can easily be dodged if you have a Brain. 
---
Billy and bubba don't ignore the survivors only defense, a good survivor vs a good billy could loop a billy for 5 gens if he is good enough. And bubba is self explanatory. Sure they can break pallets while they are chainsaw sprinting, but they can also be stunned while doing so, which means a good survivor can punish even using you're chainsaw. 
---
So, what's the difference with old legion? A god survivor vs a legion that just knows how he works. The legion will always win. His power wasn't interactive, it there was litterally no thoughts of mind games or strats. For the killer it was, M2, recharge, M2, Recharge, M2, Recharge, M2, down.
---
There was litterally nothing a survivor could do. He ignored every defense the survivors had, and even if he missed his attack he could hit you immediately after.
---
I use them.
---
Such a charming and cute style :)
---
Somebody else suggested that they hide in lockers and you can switch control to them. If someone tried to enter the locker they‚Äôd be injured by the one hiding in there. Would be pretty fun and great for map pressure!

* Not a LFG request; please use our other weekly threads for these questions.
---
I would say yes because then you basically have to switch to that killer/survivor or build, and not everyone has every killer/survivor/perk, so everyone else could switch, it screws over the new/broke people
---
Killing is difficult to incorporate into a killers power. Myers is the only one capable and the add-ons that allow him to do it require absurd amounts of Evil leeched. The trade-off is supposed to be, you can pour a bunch of time into eliminating someone of your choice. This game is all about time management, I'm not the first to say this. So when someone is getting killed, it can't just be handed off except cough cough memento mori cough cough
---
If a killer does injure, or deal damage, survivors are not healing. If survivors are not healing, they're either running or doing gens. You can only chase one person realistically, so gens will be done fast against this killer. 
---
I guess I'm not really trying to make a point here, just whatever you may have in mind for a power like that should be interesting because it certainly isn't easy to balance.
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
it doesn't get better. i'm rank one and can't loop for shit
---
Your art reminds me of Afrobull
---
I don‚Äôt speak cheeki breeki but that was very blyatefull

This post is proof that you should think before you post and not post every single thing that pops in your head. Nowhere in your post did you make anything even remotely resembling a rational thought. I take pity on you
---
I don‚Äôt care about legion and I will always hate him
---
Also remember when that was really a thing?
---
I have been playing for 3 years. I am fully aware of what swf are capable of. 
---
You sit here talking about communication being the top contributor of swf being strong. Yet, your suggestion is to take away gameplay mechanics to somehow balance this.
---
Thatd be like taking killstreaks away from people who party up in CoD. Solves nothing and makes people less inclined to play.
---
Imo, the issue lies with perks themselves, I am convinced bhvr just comes up with a perk and ships it out without ever testing it nor synergizing it with other perks. 
---
Alot of killer success comes from the killer knowing when to and not to chase a certain survivor. Clicky click trying to get your attention? Don't bother, why does he do it? Because people are inexperienced and chase him, thus making him do it more often. 
---
The gameplay is dated, 5 gens is simply not enough anymore. Hell, 3 hooks would almost be bs if anymore gameplay was added. 
---
I digress. The game is mostly at error because of shit thought process and lack of QC. Simply taking away perks for people grouping up is not only bad for game health but just stupid.
---
Inb4 "BhVr SaId SwF iSn'T thEiR mAiN pLaYer BaSe" is a lie. Every. Single. Bit. Of. Salt. Is. Swf related. Whether its a 2 man or 4 man is irrelevant, your idea is just bad.
---
Damn you Nea

Chainsaw noises give it away. And if he doesnt use his chainsaw he's an m1 killer soo
---
What did they nerf?
---
Nope i did it 2 times in a row , and it worked , that demo make your choice build is very good for this lol
---
Wrong flair.  Also can we get less shitposts in general on this sub and more genuine discussion and threads to help players out and talk actual strategy and shit?
---
I feel like these shitposts primarily exist to just take up spots on the sub and farm karma.  Occasionally you'll come across one that was really well thought out and creative but for every one of those you get a 100 of these.
---
Neither, buy Myers or uninstall.
---
Rational thought these nuts in your mom's mouth, kid. My dad works for Microsoft and can get you banned.

A good player using dead hard uses it for distance, you could even argue that dodging attacks is using it for distance.

Lol I've bought myers a long time ago love em but need someone new

Can confirm
---
"Nerf" is a kind of video game lingo word, not exactly exclusive to DBD. When something is "nerfed" inside a video game, it means it was weakened somehow, or obstructed to be more difficult.

---
good job. I love playing as the doctor, against him not so much haha
---
I started playing in December 2018, and figured this would be a game I only played with my friends. Now, I play solo 95% of the time, and DBD was my most played game of the year.
---
Personally, I'm not looking for events or game modes. Events are nice, but they don't increase my interest in the game. I don't like double BP events where a lot of the games are either camping or farming. Match quality is important to me and it's what keeps my interest in the game.
---
A lot of the technical/balance issues that people talk about with the game don't affect me too much. I'm pretty easy going and don't expect things to be perfect, but understand that things could always be better. I wish the frame rates on console were better so I could have a bit more fun playing Nurse. I might play more killer if that were the case.
---
My biggest issue this past year would probably be that the Tome challenges really cause the match quality to degrade. I have video of instances where I got downed, and everyone wants the unhook so badly that they are just following the killer while they are carrying me. The first few days of a new tome are like this, so it's usually not a long term thing, but I feel that it shouldn't be difficult to understand that certain challenges will change people's in game behaviour, causing the match to be less enjoyable for everyone.
---
I'm not sure I have one stand out highlight this year, but maybe just playing the game was that highlight. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in 4 or 5 years.
---
I appreciate that BHVR is trying to continue to improve the game, even though it may seem slow at times, and that they struggle with getting some things right. I'm a developer myself, and understand that it can be a difficult process. I wouldn't be opposed to them skipping a chapter to focus on game health or even reworking some of the things they have in queue. Heck, I'd even help them out if they'd let me.
---
Ok do you have any proof or are those numbers pulled out your ass? :)
---
Personally id go with Pig. Demo is super boring. Look at some videos to help you decide.
---
You're gonna make comments like this then call me a kid?! That's fucking rich. Just making yourself look stupid

---
‚ÄúA dumb argument‚Äù not in the slightest. All of this is your opinion lmao. If someone is good with any killer the killer can do damage against even the best survivors.  Old legion literally was annoying to go against it wasn‚Äôt ever god tier. The lack of cool down after missed shots was what was ridiculous and unfair. Other then that get over it. I don‚Äôt need a lesson in killers or how it is for survivors.  The only time i‚Äôm not a red rank survivor is after reset. There are numerous killers that can down you in one hit was my entire point  here. The fact that survivors still complain about legion  when there are killers that you could actually complain about is my point.  If you aren‚Äôt a brain dead billy he isn‚Äôt so balanced so I don‚Äôt know what you were getting at there.
---
dodge the hatches that can hit you from anywhere, great plan lol
---
Ps4 here too and yes shit is annoying.
---
Yeah, I understand that trapper is affected more by comms. My points are:
---
1) The difference between a coordinated group that can talk to one another in real time and a solo queue group that can only communicate with two gestures &amp; aura reading is already massive, no matter who the killer is.
---
2) Saying Behavior can't give Legion a disguise-themed rework because voice chat would be extra-strong against it doesn't hold water when voice chat is already extra-strong against Trapper and Hag, but no one is suggesting their powers be fundamentally reworked.

Everyone cries about Legion, but everyone forgets that Clown is equally bad.
---
Using the analogy of call of duty is a very strange caparison, considering cod is a 8v8 with both sides being on even footing and dead by daylight being a 4v1 with questionable balance problems. 
---
But removing perks barely effects enjoyment outside of gimick groups that like to sabo or something, it's meeting in the criteria of balance, and doing or saying nothing means the game won't change or evolve, if people play this game for fun, removing the ability to have the same meta build you bring every game shouldn't be an issue.
---
Taking away perks does not remove gameplay mechanics in any way, people can still loop and rush gens, the difference it makes is not being able to abuse the mechanics whilst falling on clutch perks AND having constant communication.
---
Wraith and Nurse.
---
Oh yeah let me just go get all my relevant paperwork that I have compiled on this exact topic
---
Listen it‚Äôs quite obvious that he‚Äôs marketed towards young kids in their early teens. It‚Äôs his demographic, that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so popular
---
If he revvs up on the first kill you know its LF though. And if you hearno TR and no one is in a chase he's camping. Quite easy to know lol
---
..my comments a joke uwu

True but it still kinda ruined it for me a bit. Still a fun horror though

BHVR responds with ‚Äúits nerf or nothing‚Äù
---
This is really cool, Hag was my first killer to get all killer perks at level 3, and i only need kate and jeff 2 perks from each of them and i will have every perk level 3 on my claudette. However, i don't like prestiging, i think it's a waste of time and bloodpoints, because it doesn't really effect the bloodweb. But claudette is P2, and David is P3 for me.
---
Deep Wound is now countered by just sprinting, so all Legion does is just make you injured a bit faster.
---
Okay so you're actually oblivious to jokes, got it. So, this is the internet. My name is TotallyNotScrooge. I make funnies and people get its not actually true.

Yes I did and it's still stupid, out of all the alternative solution to SWF I saw, one that remove perk slots is one of the worst. Not mentioning the fact the problem is still there, you just reversed it. If it's two man SWF but they are both weak and are just trying to farm together then you once again need them for no reason while the higher player that just so happened to okay solo is fully operational. The problem doesn't come from the way it work, but from the idea itself to begin with.
---
And if you don't see how repeating something someone else said (we'll call it a punchline to make it shorter and simpler) then you need to watch absolutely every debate in the world including on Reddit, repeating your opponents punchline after saying your argument or debunking their own point is used by most people, it remind everyone of that decent punchline, it maintain the debate at a certain level of rythms and using someone else's argument against them is also a nice humiliation attempt that work most of the time. Well it work only people are on your side at the moment and if you are actually right and shit but most of time it works.
---
Repeating someone else's comment is pretty r/iamverysmart worthy to begin with, it's called "demonstrating by the absurd" (or disproving, or proving or anything equivalent in that case).
---
This is even more obvious when you try to use slightly complicated terms to appear smarter by using "volatile drivel" when "useless/repetitive rambling" is right here.
---
It is bad because you just end looking like something you are maybe not, in that case, an arrogant know-it-all dumbass. Which is bad because for all I know, you are maybe a pretty normal human being and shit but how would I know ? The only thing I know about you are entitled opinions accompanied with snarky comments.
---
Bonus: 
---
I know you might consider this hypocrite when I see how much I explain stuff in this particular comment and how long it is but basically, one phrase I repeat a lot is this: There's the words, and the meaning of words. Basically don't try to sound like an asshole if you don't want people to see you that way. And if you're sure it's not your fault then just don't care about it, it's the other person who misunderstood you.
---
That's huh... That's it.
---
so you just leave every survivor on the hook when its LF? and how do you know nobody is being chased? it only tells you when the obsession is being chased
---
I always kill them...maybe I should help the baby dweeght
---
Quit summoning demons.
---
I‚Äôm no god or anything but what helped me is just slowing down. Watch the killers movements, plan an exit route and a backup exit route. Don‚Äôt panic. Also learning what loops are good and bad is key. You‚Äôll get it friend :)
---
Since his move to mixer he's went back to more of his swearing type content.  He's no longer a PG streamer from what I have been told by a few friends that still watch him (all 20+ btw).  His numbers have dropped massively since he moved so I doubt most of the kids are still around to be fair.  Not saying it's 100% what is happening but I can imagine since he has went to playing other games a lot more and has dropped the PG act for the most part.
---
Oh I'm sorry you're actually implying there's a joke in there somewhere?!
---
No, it really isn't. It's silly and shouldn't be taken seriously. It's equal to being called a doo doo head and you people getting genuinely offended by it is hilarious to me.
---
Actually don't hit me up, you're too slow for my taste.
---
i 100% agree with my comrade **–¥—Ä—É–≥** here
---
(jk i don't speak vladimir)
---
Getting a 4k with hillbilly, mori, noed, etc. Doesn't make you a good killer either.
---
Did you get penalized for DCing? What a waste of time. That really sucks.
---
The hag's a DLC? I had no idea bc she came included with my Xbox Game Pass edition. She's currently my favorite. I'm trash at the other DLC killers like Doctor and Nurse. 
---
Also, I am a fairly new player but I've been ranking up quickly. My biggest weakness is winning chases. I've won quite a few but I know that every time I get in one, there's a 90% chance I'm getting put on a hook. I tend to opt for a more stealthy play style. How tf do people juke so good and do 360s? Whenever I try, it's an immediate down
---
Understandable, if you have someone that actually uses their ability to track it can be annoying as hell.
---
What lmao that‚Äôs like a slightly faster M1 killer, what‚Äôs even the point? Like if you get hit you‚Äôre going to be sprinting anyway
---
I thought that was an "D" instead of "O" and was rather confused for a couple minutes
---
But you have to hook then unless its a Cyprus
---
You mean they showed kid Myers? I watched the first film maybe a year ago (There's a Family Video open in my town still, for those who don't know like Blockbuster, but not) and I don't remember it showing Myer's adult face, did I miss something?

You can see his face in a couple of the older Halloweens.  In addition to him being unmasked in the very first one he's unmasked again in number 4 or 5 I can't remember which one but it's when he's trying to kill his little niece.  Also in the most recent Halloween you don't see any of this.  This was behind the scenes.  You just see part of his face in a limited shot mostly just the damaged eye.
---
You think what you said was jokes and claim to be funny and wanna say I'm the slow one...yeah ok. And don't flatter yourself...I wasn't planning on hitting you up anyway bc I'm not gonna waste my time on someone with your lack of self awareness and intelligence
---
I mean I'm having way more fun with the post-buff Legion than before. 
---
Vaulting stuff faster and running faster feels so much better and I couldn't give less of a crap about losing like 4 seconds off mending which I didn't care that much about in the first place. I want to get people injured, game delay is a tiny bonus.
---
Oh true
---
I have hit a stride with creating my Killer builds and having the confidence to go in, lose, and figure out how to synergize their abilities and perks. I have a way better sense of how to play a balanced game and switch priorities so that my games are meaty and interesting, and I'm super proud of the Killers I've built and the way they pressure my survivors :)
---
Also, there's so much less BS and BMing now that the ECG is a thing. It still sucks to get my ass handed to me by high ranked optimal/efficient survivors but it is a whole lot more helpful that ECG moves the game to a close when they don't want to leave. Overall I see the fandom wanting to address the toxicity and take responsibility for changing the culture and that's pretty encouraging
---
My biggest disappointment was seeing what I felt was a deterioration in quality of the women characters and increased sexualization at the expense of well-rounded and unique writing. Jane had great potential as a unique character and it's a shame to me she's only seen as thicc by the fandom; The Pig got slightly feminized too despite starting as more of a haggard, greasy, filthy killer. While there is a place for sexuality and feminity in media and in the fandom, and it's unavoidable, I had a much better impression of the original cast of Meg, Claudette, Nea, Huntress and Nurse for their grittiness, depth and individuality. I'm hoping that the creators can strike a balance so that the characters always have depth and complexity no matter how hot they are (or aren't)
---
It's killer instinct
---
No i did not but i lost my green flashlight and my escape cake
---
God you're actually a degenerate.
---
Then why not advocate for communication to be removed.
---
Two words.
---
Apple Cider Vinegar.
---
and thats a fact
---
Pig  because she makes cute noises when you pallet stun her
---
Both.
---
I'm just kidding, love you.
---
Wdym regressions? Like during deep wound? Doesn't really sound that effective besides Joey's.
---
I'm sry I got the game 2 days ago is that a perk?
---
Yeah man, just as Loomis finally shows up at the end, Laurie pulls his mask off.
---
Pretty dude.
---
Yeah I did some research on that as well as I am kinda fascinated with actual serial killers and after reading those revelation logs she was the first thing to come to mind. It really looks like this is the next chapter with the amount of detail put into her backstory.
---
This happens to me every time i use a splinter to play freddy, every other splinter I've tried has no issues
---
Exhaustion perks are meta for a reason. Legion still needs to down the survivor as m1 killer and exhaustion perks can make that way harder.
---
Isn't that obvious?
---
I have horrible memory so I must've forgot... time to take another trip to Family Video...
---
Not during deep wound but make like a minute or two after mending
---
And now their's no shortage of people posting the ragemail they receive by survivors feeling entitled to put their perks too use.
---
I can‚Äôt find a balance. I‚Äôll have games when I just figure out crazy ass loops and juke the killer for 3 gens, but other games I‚Äôll get downed in 20 seconds
---
My mom died when I was 4
---
Naw was definitely OP
---
I wouldn't say any other killer, trapper has plenty.
---
Good ur mom was probably a slut anyways
---
I don‚Äôt see a descive
---
&gt; I'd take a spirit any day 
---
Really?
---
(Probably unpopular opinion) The rank system change was terrible. I can't reach rank 1 playing casually anymore. Also, it makes adept achievements very hard to get because rank 10 survivors are already rank 1 at looping and some killers have shit perks.
---
I get what you're saying, but it sounds like you're upset that people have preferences. With a game with multiple characters, you're going to HAVE some that are more played then others. That's just how it goes. 
---
The idea of those two have the most cosmetics though sounds like a solid idea to follow though.
---
Well you can't really use head on and sprint burst
---
r/woosh
---
Ohhhh
---
i like nurses. also ruin&gt;pgtw imo
---
Uh wow. No kidding, you got a fairly decent matchmaking.
---
Wcbkirdbnk
---
You can loop Myers until the exhauste effect is gone but that's just a test build so maybe you're right
---
You just got a upvote good sir
---
I always felt that that was on purpose because one of the chests is locked behind finishing a gen, unlike any other map.
---
Replace the toxin with the extra box. Replace I‚Äôm all ears (only good on stealth killers who move at normal speed) with something for chases or maybe PGTW
---
Imo ruin is too rng so thats why i never use it. Tho nurses is solid
---
You guys got anything else to bring to this convo or are you just gonna parrot what everyone else says?
---
You also mend faster now
---
Absolutely. I hate Legion - as the killer or survivor. 
---
It's like the Devs came up with a cool idea, couldn't implement it in the game, and said fuck it we can make money of this and put him in anyway.
---
Why did you delete it? it's still pretty good and other people can make improvements
---
And i would've done it, if it wasn't for those mettling kids.
---
We need more people like you
---
Because deleted him would honestly be a buff
---
From what I've read generally Legion still has the problem of not being that interesting to play against. You still can't really do anything to avoid getting hit when he's in his power (even tho it's not lethal anymore) and besides that he's just the same old m1 115% killer. Not much to write home about.
---
Also survivors generally get bored working on gens and holding m1 for minutes, I believe one of the reasons they lowered the time it takes to mend was because people found **more** reasons to hold m1 to be pretty boring.
---
Killer: The Wolf
---
Power: Woof Woof
---
The bot deleted it because i didn't choose a flair
---
The original post was a joke. This man's initial response was also a joke. After that, he made a couple well-known jokes, but a couple comments do make him sound like a dick. Even after explaining that it was a joke because he realized you were taking it seriously, you still didn't understand. Not calling you out or anything, sarcasm is hard to understand through the internet. Just saying, it's all a joke.
---
He is not.  Clown is nearly fine, just needs some passive bottle regen (like 1 every 10 seconds) and to hold 5 by default.  Clown‚Äôs issues are game issues, i.e. bad map design and overall game speed being too fast.  These are issues for every killer though.
---
I have screwed all of their mothers in protest of these heinous and bannable acts.
---
I'm not saying they are useless. But saying Exhaustion is the best debuff a killer can give is a pretty far stretch. Especially since technically the only exhaustion perk this will probably counter is Dead Hard, as any other one would probably be used before you hit them with Frenzy.
---
Also not EVERY survivor runs exhaustion, so if the main draw of your ability is exhaustion then you are essentially weaker when facing them. With Hemorrhage, Oblivious, and Blindness you are at least guaranteed some sort of benefit of inflicting it, whether it is worth or it not is debatable. The debuff makes sense on an add-on or perk, but not as the main core  of a power.
---
I'm still confused
---
It's not? When did they say this?
---
You know because no one is running around being chased and getting hit. And yes, leave the person there and work through the gens
---
You‚Äôre misunderstanding them. Specifically where they say ‚Äúone specific survivor.‚Äù
---
If you get into a lobby and see a Twitch streamer and decide to focus on killing them no matter what, that‚Äôs targeted harassment. That‚Äôs what the devs were talking about.
---
If you find a survivor and down them, and then focus on killing them over other survivors because you want to rush into a 3v1 situation, and they happen to be the most efficient path towards that, that‚Äôs unlucky for the survivor, but well within the allowed actions.
---
The fact that you‚Äôre so willing to twist what the Devs said to fit your bias is an issue.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs strange matchmaking is working correctly. Huh.
---
But in all seriousness the survivors window is supposed to be +6 or -6 that of the killers.
---
This comment is edgy enough to let you join the Legion.
---
Well, he started not playing with women after he got married, according to him. I still call BS though.
---
It's not just bannable, its Inhumane, Barbaric, Its an act of total anarchy!, it's against the law to camp
---
You got me at USELESS FUCKING TOE lmao
---
Don't worry nea, soon I'll have the spectator camera
---
they could just be good and not getting hit, and you cant see everywhere on the map at once, i rarely if ever actually see the survivor looping the killer
---
To be fair this is far more balanced than i have seen in months.
---
Legion doesn‚Äôt need to actually change between the members, but they could do a personality shift and have one of them take over that you cycle through, altering your power depending on who is in charge at the moment.  This could also give them unique terror radius/chase music based off of their mix tapes.
---
Hardly anyone wants to use this in my region....
---
He feel sad cuz Meg died because of him.
---
Wish if during Frenzy you hit an uninjured survivor, another member of the Legion ambushes an uninjured survivor from above and then vanishes in a cloud of angst and metal. Puts either a wound or timer on them.
---
No Frenzy hits can down. Same basic idea, hurting everybody quickly, and you get to see the entire gang. Find the weakest link, smack 'em repeatedly, go for basic attacks once you've spread it.
---
Irisdescent could allow downing in Frenzy if no other survivors are available for injury. More common could give you notifications when another Legion smacks somebody, akin to the aura Frenzy now gives, could add status effects, etc.
---
Whispers and monitor and abuse work really well with her. Once whispers activated immediately crouch. Watch FunGoose and Ardetha on YouTube they have a few good tricks with pig. Head traps aren‚Äôt meant to kill survivors just slow them down don‚Äôt expect to get kills that way.
---
Everbody gangsta til you miss the skillcheck
---
Reported for waiting out ds.
---
Literally been told this before.
---
But Legion at least plays the game, vs Spirit you are just flipping a coin and hoping the guy playing her doesn't have headphones. 
---
That's so boring for both sides to me, it's like I'm playing a singleplayer game when I'm using her power.

B i g feelzbad

I hate all of it.
---
If you tap an Overcharged generator and let go, you can still hit the skillcheck to prevent it from exploding, why not regular skillchecks?
---
Also there are some generators I get 20 skill checks (the average is supposedly 6.4, because you have an 8% chance of a skill check for each of the 80 charges in the generator) and others I get none for the entirety of the repair, spending a minute of nearly back-to-back Ruin skill checks is stressful even when I am hitting the greats.
---
TR, getting hit, chainsaw noises... All that reveal that its LF. You can just be good and not get hit once but at some point you will get hit. Unless the killer is rank 20 and survis rank 1 and even then it CAN happen.
---
I don't, I'm just messing with you
---
u did ur bones today?
---
Laurie pulls his mask off and he nearly looks like combination of Kurt Russell and handsome Squidward.
---
That's so boring to play against tho. You can't avoid the hit if the guy playing is competent and you just get % slowed for the entire chase &amp; exhausted.
---
Most people would then take Joey since out of those 4 movement speed would be most impactful. Nothing really interesting about them in a chase you are just slower, that's boring + you get exhausted for the entire chase on top of that. That's so awful.
---
Don‚Äôt worry your not alone. I tried to do KYF with people on Xbox and it‚Äôs a bad experience. We were only able to get in 3 games in 2 hours because of all the game restarting and connection issues
---
It‚Äôs literally a team game
---
So you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs the shitty players abusing the DC system that‚Äôs the problem instead of the challenge itself?
---
Sounds about right.
---
Start banning people that DC. Watch the challenge get a whole lot easier, yeah?
---
? the TR and getting hit doesnt reveal its LF? every killer has the same TR and hit notification?? and even just between moderate survivor and killer they can avoid getting hit for a minute or two, which will let the guy on hook hit second stage at least
---

It‚Äôs you. You were the joke the whole time!
---
Is good joke. But you need to work on your delivery. Cause right now, it‚Äôs DiGiorno.
---
If the guy is on hook and there is a TR away from the hook its safe. Same for a hit. If someone else is hit, either they're unhooking or getting chased. You can determine it by TR too
---
*laughs in Puppers*
---
You've not looked at this subreddit at all have you?
---
If you had you would have seen countless posts just like this
---
A fellow Nintendo Switch dbd player. My cat usually just bites my Nintendo. Lucky
---
I'm confused, still
---
From using his power does trapper lose the ability to down someone? Is Trapper punished for placing his trap incorrectly? Does he have a long timer between placing his traps? Does he lose sight of blood and scratches and gens after placing a trap?
---
keep in mind I said from simply using, not exactly just counters of which most every killer has a couple perks for that.
---
4 second stun after using Frenzy. 20 second recharge. The survivors generate no trails while in Frenzy while it also erasing any existing ones. You can't physically down a survivor with your power at all. A single miss completely drains your power and gives you the aforementioned stun and recharge.
---
That's what I'm pointing to when I say the actual usage of the power punishes you more than any other killer. You lose so much baseline a standard killer has and also get several restrictions to it as well.
---
I have no idea why Legion was nerfed to begin with. He was fun. Sure, tunneling was a thing with him, but the game doesn‚Äôt reward killers in any way for tunneling. You might get one survivor by tunneling, but I have a hard time believing at least two survivors can‚Äôt escape with a tunneling killer every time. His old power, smack and run to the next survivor. Sure you can technically still do this, but you miss that crucial stab and your whole kit is broken now and waiting on cool down.
---
At least Clown has benefit in a chase.
---
The only way Pig gets any sort of benefit is to sneak up slower than a survivor can even move, and her pressure tends to drag out the game in a way most survivors can immerse through and leave her with no net gain unless you're running Whispers and amazing at proxying the boxes without surrendering generator pressure entirely.
---
Even then they can just rush you out and leave the one in your RBT to die more often than not.
---
In fact Clown shuts down loops so well that giving him other benefits to engage might make him as annoying as Ghostface (basically downed at a generator since he moves full speed without any indications from behind cover, and leans to expose for 2 seconds before stabbing you); the nearby pallet will only save you once.
---
Most good Clowns use the bottles to scout with anyway, I think him getting addons to change what his bottles inflict is interesting, but that you're going to go down if he finds you means making it easier for him than it already is (hello random bottle behind the rock or on the gen from miles away) to find you is going to be salt-inducing.
---
It's the best debuff they can give besides slows. Dead hard, Lithe and BL might as well be an extra health state if used for distance.
---
&gt;Also not EVERY survivor runs exhaustion
---
And not every killer runs ruin (ok nwm, they all do, lets go with bbq) but I'd wager you'd see at least 2 exhaustion perk per match.
---
&gt;With Hemorrhage, Oblivious, and Blindness
---
Hemorrhage does nothing. There is a reason nobody uses blocks on Freddy.
---
They first 2 guys will finish mending by the time you injure the last guy, so Oblivious won't have much of an impact.
---
Blindness is only worth anything if it's permanent (3rd seal) since they can't find the hooked guy, if you are chasing them it does nothing.
---
Exhaustion is the most impactful one of the bunch.

I've been watching your vids for some years now. Cool to see you're playing cbc and fear comics
---
Fax, Im legion main and I hate playing against legion lmao
---
Happens to everyone, I got over 800 hours I still miss that thing
---
thats only if you hear the TR come by you?? usually killers hook and run away to find someone else, so there is never a TR near the hook usually, and a survivor getting hit takes time, and in that time the guy hits second stage
---
I've got less than 400 sadly, and can't play much except for a little on XB1 instead of PS4 or PC. I've come to notice that PS4 has suuuuper shitty ends for their skillchecks. It's on every platform, but I get so much more frame lag on there.
---
lol
---
no, if we get another MOM thats just going to be another useless perk in a month.
---
Be happy with what we are getting now, we have actually gotten decent to good perks recently compared to the year of actual garbage we got before the stranger things chapter.
---
Killers got constant top tier perks while we got close to nothing. Game breaking perks are not even fun so whats the point
---
rainbow perks?
---
IMO getting a 4K as killer should guarantee a safety pip if not an actual pip and escaping as a survivor (not through the hatch) should guarantee a safety pip as well
---
[kim k voice] it's what she deserves
---
Bro I run Small Game I do bones all day everyday just so players like you don't get that gimme down and hook at the end even in soloqueue lol.  Just saying NOED is the mark of an inexperienced or new player.  Dudes aren't looking for this as advice ever.  NOED is what you run when you don't know how to do anything else yet.  That OR you just want to do your Tome 3 Challenge.
---
Don't worry. You did the best you could.
---
Yes you are. It‚Äôs exactly like ps4 and Xbox. But NOT on TV mode it lag SOOO much and it‚Äôs like going through hell.
---
I didn't think Bond let you see the auras of survivors in lockers.
---
Agreed.
---
so it is only active while the survivor is in Deep Wounds? If so then they all suck and you are at best only getting the benefit of any of these debuffs on 1 person, i.e. the 1 you choose to chase at the end of your Frenzy.
---
How impactful is Exhaustion if the survivor isn't running a related perk? Not at all, it is very possible to play without said perks.
---
My point wasn't to say it's the worst, but it definitely isn't worth being a base use of your power since survivors don't always rely on exhaustion or at least get use out of it before you can even apply it. It definitely isn't the best, honestly I would say between the 4 the OP mentioned, it's only better than Hemorrhage.
---
The other half of my argument was Oblivious being the better option, because having no indication of the killer coming towards you while you are injured is basically a guaranteed down. Which is why the kinda meta forming around stealth killers is picking up so much lately.
---
INTJ-T
---
It doesn't, they just see you until you get in then it disappears and if it disappears you know they went into a locker
---
I'd rather replace it with mad grit for the rare times survivors try to bodyblock at the hook.
---
Or just bring agitation only.
---
If killers had this logic then Insta heals, DS, BT, MOM, Pallets, BNPs, exhaust perks, ect would all still be like they where before.
---
Asking for game balance in a game that you play a lot is something that should happen. The excuse of "life isnt fair" is such a dumb argument since video games can be edited and changed unlike real life.
---
Video games are made for entertainment, remember that.
---
Or, instead...

We take the ground and lighting of Swamp, add the weather and snow from Ormund and the Corn from Coldwind.

Just figured it would be a detterant for some.
---
The TR is on most killers 32m. Thats a lot. And there are few maps indoor where you cant see the killer/survivor running in a chase.
---
(1) Trapper loses the ability to do anything else while collecting his power (a process that takes some time); this includes everything on your list. (He can't down people, he can't look for blood or scratchmarks around the generators or other points of interest, he loses generators entirely for going to pick up his traps).
---
(2) He can't cross over his own trap, he loses the ability to down or hook people based on where it is (he can step it and drop the survivor, the survivor can Dead Hard over it and prevent the Trapper from following without breaking the chase, the survivor can use the trap as an artificial pallet to ward the Trapper off) if he uses it incorrectly (and often, even if he doesn't).
---
(3) Trapper's ability does not put the survivor into the dying state innately, unless he's very close to them (and they don't have help getting out) it only injures them when they escape. He has to drop everything he's doing and run across the map (**a lot slower than Legion does**) in the hopes of getting a hit on the survivor who stepped into his trap.
---
Trapper doesn't get any information from his power despite having to collect it unless the survivors disarm the trap specifically (or step in it, of course); Legion gets a Killing Instinct proc on all the survivors within their Terror Radius, revealing their location, on hitting any survivor with Feral Frenzy (which refreshes the duration).
---
This means "not seeing scratch marks" doesn't really matter, you get to see exactly where they are, which makes it easy to defend a hook since you can spot them at a large distance and intercept successfully despite the self-stun, or injure multiple people and force them to mend while you chase down the unhooker.
---
It also makes him better at the 3 or 4-gen than Trapper, because Legion can chase all game normally (instead of having to collect traps) and then hard-defend the last 4 gens because finding one person repairing lets you find all of them, injure them, and force them to mend.
---
Rinse repeat; Legion can use addons to force the mend-repair cycle to take 4 minutes for one survivor to pop a generator, Trapper still gets rushed out.
---
You‚Äôre a champ! Wish I went against people like you... Instead today I go against a streamer who morid me off first hook at five gens because he didn‚Äôt like the hook tech used to save me :-(
---
Yes queen.
---
Literally every Mexican family when I walk into a building.
---
it's a fantastic insult to send via Xbox Message because it really gets my point across and I can't be reported for it.

*"You're a useless toe of a teammate. Thanks for nothing."*
---
and you know the person on the receiving end has the be like, wtf? which makes it even funnier.  
---
Feel free to try it. Let me know the results hahaha.
---
Nah, he'll never be removed. And players will continue exploiting him to the point that the game will be unplayable for you scumbags.
---
Can I have an invite?
---
That's just reverse Iron Maiden

oh i meant you deserved the hook lmao
---
that poor hag just wanted to eat some guts
---
1. It depends on which country your in 2. Yes
---
So he‚Äôs just a survivor with a knife now, neat
---
No. Remove Please :)
---
Trapper has plenty of downsides when it comes down to his power. 
---
&gt;Does he have a long timer between placing his traps?
---
He has to go around the map to pick his power up before he can even use it, which drastically weakens his early game. Trapper's bag is basically a must.
---
&gt;Is Trapper punished for placing his trap incorrectly?
---
Yes, actually. They have a smaller hitbox then their model would lead you to believe. If you place the trap too close to the window the survivor can vault it and be fine but [if you vault it you will get caught in the trap](https://youtu.be/_9zYM-ALris?t=219). If you don't place the trap correctly the survivor can walk around it but you can't without getting caught.
---
I mean listen, if *you* don't want easy Rift completions...
---
Am in canada, not sure if i can get it
---
Dw, I'm agreeing with you üòÇ I ran her on one of the houses, obvious hook from that alone since BHVR can't map out a decent game.
---
Bruh I play both sides plenty , the fact of the matter is when survivors don't cleanse it just leads to boring 1 hit-down slugging matches where you will still most likely lose as plauge. In the event you actually win your getting fuck all for bloodpoints due to the way her power works. She needs something to force survivors to cleanse, if it aint that then the ONLY other options are either A survivors go down after X amount of time not cleansing or B survivors get X universal slowdown while infected. Pick your posion something needs to change.
---
All of these suggestions sound very circumstantial, that you have to be in the right place at the right time, or just wait till someone else gets hit, and the whole time there is at least one guy dying on a hook
---
Because you CANT have communication removed, especially on PC, there will just be 3rd party team speech. Xbox and PlayStation could probably do it, but the playerbase is PC focused.
---
About an hour ago I was recommended your Bad Guy video, what the fuck

---
It kinda ruins the mistique to have a maskless Myers as a skin. His face is only briefly shown in the 1978 movie, and in the 2018 movie his face is never shown fully on screen.
---
Its something you experience in every game unless you're immersed as hell, and you wont save if immersed. Seeing the killer run around and the heartbeat happens often
---
oof, easy mistake. but at least it wasn't so rough there was nothing to learn, i've definitely taken a few beatings as killer where i just look at the end screen like "wow i don't know what happened at all"
---
I don‚Äôt watch hexy nor do I know who that is. I also do not care. You have an opinion. I have mine. I do not need a lesson on killers or survivors like I said.  I literally specified after rework so why are you bent out of shape lmao.  I never once said they were op , not one time, my entire point was that any killer in the hands of someone who knows how to use them can be good and that plenty of killers have one hit downs. What is your damage.
---
That David running right into the cameraman with Dead Hard.
---
I'm guessing some survivors DC-d, so the killer (Me) has decided to take pitty on the remaining survivors and farm points together. While the killer and the survivor are farming points together, another survivor (the guy staring across tables) doesn't understand the killer is being friendly and keeps acting as if killer was hostile.

If you blind to early you can click the flashlight to blind them again and they'll drop the survivor.  This trick is also useful when you need to gain distance after blinding a killer at a pallet.

Yes. Though sometimes you gotta just leave son the killer gets one sacrifice instead of two

Killer: Nurse, might be the slowest killer but it is so satisfying to blink right to a survivor and smack them, have them run, and then immediately blink and down them, you can see the confusion/hate in the survivors. Did get a few disconnects though.

&gt;Killer is stressed enough, being disrespected is extra

It stops being stressful the moment you realize it's a videogame and nothing important is at stake. Stop pretending you're in a tournament and you'll see how silly it is to care so much about someone pressing a button a couple of times, jesus.
---
I'm not even saying it as "just relax bro" thing, I stopped treating my matches seriously a long time ago and I'm enjoying this game way more since then. I'm still rank 1 every season, I'm still getting a lot of good matches, but I'm no longer acting like it's a competitive game. Let it go.
---
&gt;Stfu

You're the one against being "rude" in a game yet you're the one in this discussion who stoops to that level of arguing? :\

RIGHT?! We were both taking bets on whose locker she‚Äôd check first, but we were so shocked when she just left! We stayed there for a good 20 more seconds after the clip just because we thoughts when was baiting us out

Most of the selfish dbd players miss this point because they want the game all to themselves. Any growth in the community is good for the community, the queue times, and the devs.

This is a remake of a scene from tom and jerry
---
It happens in most smaller games to be honest.  They don't want attention brought to it because "I don't want bad teammates" or some other stupid reason.  Always makes me laugh though because these new players won't be in there games unless 1. They are also bad and low rank 2. They deranked to bully low level killers etc anyway
---
Nope, just killers at low ranks don‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôs better to injure multiple survivors then to tunnel. Once they get out of the starter rank survivors will punish a tunneling killer because they will all have decisive strike and adrenaline.
---
Thank you, so do you
---
&gt; sloppy, STBFL
---
No, this nerf didn't really do anything. If you were playing against competent survivors then this change doesn't affect you since they wouldn't be healing against you anyways. It's a waste of time to heal vs Legion. If they are injured then STBFL isn't really being of that much use to you, you are downing everyone in 1 hit.
---
&gt;Third Seal
---
That's the only one that I will genuinely agree with.
---
&gt;etc
---
No that's pretty much it. This change really didn't do that much, I'll take it in exchange for faster vaults and ms which have been way more impactful for me than sloppy ever was vs competent survivors.
---
Could be a SWF group.
---
This is at red rank.....I am new but the ranking system seems flawed as I am floating between rank 3 and 5
---
Damn the sexualization thing is way to correct
---
They did. Same as pc now
---
This might be your rank as survivor? My survivor rank is mad low, and I see face campers and tunnelers all the time.
---
 I don't think there are perks that get boosts for that. There's atleast one that you need hooks to build up on Huntress, but you don't need to tunnel. I don't know anything past that.
---
Well then idk how he got to red ranks. Must be lucky and face potato survivors. That never touch a gen while the killer camps and rewards him for tunneling and camping.
---
Funny how Sally doesn't even give a shit.
---
Rather have Pennywise. Also movie was gargled horse cock
---
‚Äúgentlement‚Äù
---
I feel they can but it might be a little complex i guess
---
Maybe, like, give it a try and improve in the long run?
---
How about ‚ÄúDark Waters‚Äù for the chapter title
---
Hag &amp; Doc are DLC on PC, free on console. Lucky us :) 
---
And yeah 360s are stronger on console than PC, but they‚Äôre still best used as a last resort option. Good survivors focus on good positioning rather than good hiding spots (e.g. killer approaching = get to a pallet/window tile and play stealthy there so you‚Äôre ready to start looping if they find you) and then looping around pallets/jungle gyms/LT walls etc to improve your chase game. 
---
I focused on this stuff without using exhaustion perks at first in order to avoid becoming overly reliant on them. Windows of Opportunity is a great perk for learning tiles and map layouts, too. You may also want to watch some streamers/youtubers like Ussylis or OhTofu if you‚Äôre not sure how looping works or just want to improve your chases in general.
---
Sprint Burst/Lithe is a terrible Idea with Headon. You lose a perk.
---
Windows Of Opportunity is only needed if you're bad
---
and Quick and Quiet is a good perk.
---
No, unfortunately there's not. They actually changed it so that not even NOED and Sloppy Butcher works with it.
---
If they did, I would at least want it if the majority of the FNAF community that are not the younger side to follow it.  I do think that with the addition of a FNAF game in Unreal Engine 4 that will come out soon will have potential to maybe ensure more maturity within the franchise, as seen when Cawthon decided to create a complete new, separate set of lore with the release of Help Wanted which follows a bloodthirsty cult.
---
However, me ‚Äòhoping‚Äô obviously does not suffice and I just hope FNAF starts to branch into more mature audiences soon.
---
They were probably SWF which would make this a normal matchmaking.
---
You're really undervaluing STBFL, it's incredibly useful even when everyone is injured and FF made it really easy to get 8 stacks.
---
Well it's different people if you read the post.
---
Between rank 3-5 is my surv rank so sometimes it's a red rank killer others purple.
---
Same on my side I‚Äôm rank 11 and get matched up with rank 20 killers and survivors while it makes ranking up easier I feel that when I hit a higher rank I‚Äôm not gonna have the skill gap to compete with the killers because I‚Äôm just bullying baby killers
---
Use looking for group posts.U might get some competant teams there.
---
sandbaggin is farmin a teammate off the hook in front of the killer for example, teabaggin is repeatedly crouching
---
I mean...dbd is a solved game. There's not much strategy or anything involved because it's kind of shallow gameplay wise and the vast majority of gameplay comes from countering your opponents perk and/or killer choices. This games too shallow to really allow for any strategy, and the limited degree of it has been tried and true. The old guides are fine and don't really need much updating so just read those.
---
remember you have to follow the rules of having a perk that is: better than 2 of your perks, a perk that is mediocre and a perk that sucks
---
Myers and Huntress
---
Do you or your friend repeatedly press the crouch button and/or flashlight click while in view of the killer?
---
I've no idea then. Killers are just super toxic I guess. That sucks, sorry man.
---
Noclip them into the Backrooms
---
Let me boop plz
---
So... You're saying you're a bad player who needs to dodge against toolboxes? 4 items literally means nothing. TTV means nothing, why tf would you dodge a ttv
---
people in a swf you shouldn't dodge. It seems like you're just trying to get easy games because SoloQ is the weakest side in this game. Although I will admit if you have to dodge players in order to get bad players/people with a major disadvantage then I understand and I hope you get better at this game.
---
T-bagging is just when a character in a video game repeatable presses the crouch button. Sandbagging in when someone stands in front of someone, and thanks to the coalition in the game it won't allow a player to walk through them.  T-bagging isn't really that harmful, it's just BM. Sandbagging on the other hand you're actually ruining the game from someone.
---
ok,,,
---
and then lick them
---
Yeah you're a good person, but there's a dc on your record and you got no points for that match. Meanwhile Meyers still got the points for your dc all so that another survivor could escape. You would also have been a good person for just staying in the match and finishing it normally though, with the only penalty being Meg's death
---
I had a 4 man all using legacy cosmetics take an azarovs key, not ashamed to say i dc'd in loading
---
I thought sandbagging is when you block a teammate. In front of a pallet for example, so the killer can hit him.
---
Those are two completely different departments. Coders aren't making cosmetics and their art teams can't go in and fix bugs.
---
Yes we know that's not what he means
---
You can try Leatherface with Insidious, Iron Grasp, Agitation, and Mad Grit and just camp the basement. However many people dc over this which will prevent you from getting the challenge
---
So Sandbagging is body blocking from another survivor? Like if I'm on the ground and someone's trying to heal me, it's another survivor blocking them from healing me?
---
Dead hard maybe? but its so easy to counter.
---
Decisive is easy to counter, stop pretending it isnt.
---
Deliverance can be taken out before its even used, and you get punished for using it with the injured effect. If deliverance is 2nd chance then NOED is more then a 2nd chance perk.
---
Stop, I‚Äôm blushing
---
They're salty and spiteful. Mystery solved.
---
by getting inner strength duh
---
For those asking me to give myself some perks, I think I did an ok job.
---
PERKS
---
Compensation
---
You have a tendency to pick up the slack of others. When no generators have been worked on for 15 seconds and there is at least 1 other survivor alive in the trial, you gain a 15/20/25% repair speed bonus for 10/11/12 seconds.
---
This Ends Now!
---
Every victory, no matter how small, gives you motivation to do what needs to be done. Every time you successfully stun the killer with a pallet, This Ends Now gains a token, up to 3/4/5 tokens. For every token, you gain a 6% bonus to healing, unhooking, cleansing totems, and opening exit gates. Lose 2 tokens upon being hooked.
---
Dedicated
---
When you want something done, it gets done, no matter what. If hit by the killer while repairing generators, healing, unhooking, cleansing a totem, opening a chest or the exit gate, you will not be interrupted. Upon being hit while performing any of these actions while injured, gain the Endurance status effect for 4/8/12 seconds.
---
Omg no not the toolboxes! No never the toolboxes! 
---
In all actuality this is the reason people Last Second Switch. There's no reason why Last Second Switching is toxic, it's just a good strategy. sure the killer can't plan ahead or dodge, but that's why it's a good strategy.
---
Game 1: Just do gens
---
Game 2: Do gens
---
Game 3: That sucks
---
Game 4: That sucks
---
Game 5: That sucks
---
Game 6: Do what you can (do gens)
---
Game 7: Some players like to cleanse some don't, that's just the game, also do gens when she is patrolling
---
Game 8: That sucks.
---
Understandable
---
thats an example too, is whatever u do to "friendly fire" a teammate
---
I‚Äôm sure they can but they might all be 10 dollar skins or something because it changes the whole character
---
As a P3 Dwight with like every good cosmetic, can confirm hella toxic. Unsure about Scary though (this means scary to go against as killer right?) anyways love the chart!!
---
If the people you are chasing are all injured then stbfl only really comes into play around hook saves. In any other situation you down the guy and pick him up faster.
---
I use stbfl on my Demo and if every1 im chasing is injured then I only really get to pick them up faster.
---
Yeah, though you shouldn‚Äôt worry too much trying to pip. Some games you just happened to get camped and tunneled or whatever.
---
new killers when "clicking flashlight" isn't a report option
---
Bruh no one asked for your negativity
---
T bagging is spamming the crouch button as a form of BM. Sandbagging is when you do anything to purposely hurt a teammate. That could be dropping or blocking pallets in front of them or unhooking them in front of the killer or repeatedly vaulting a window so someone else can‚Äôt
---
If you think this is bad, you should see rank 1, because most people only get there by using cheap tactics to get an advantage. There are few people with actual honor at rank 1
---
So when Russians write just '(' without ':', they actually mean ':(' ?
---
Lol why is he getting downvotes?
---
Michael‚Äôs mask is his face to me. The licensors will never allow him to walk around unmasked.
---
Wow I actually didn‚Äôt know this was gonna go well
---
So what exactly is the point of this post? yea, i would fucking hope every killer would be good if they where put in the right hands, but guess what, a 5k hour nurse main will do MUCH better then a 5k hour legion main.
---
Who cares about one hit downs? its fair game, if you are not complaining about it, why bring it up? im confused on what this post is even about. are you trying to say billy/bubba are 2 good? are you trying to say legion is 2 bad? are you trying to say killer in general is to good? what are you even trying to go for here?
---
Well I haven't heard of it in that context. Think of it like this, you are looping the killer and you run through a pallet, but a survivor is on the other side (so you are in between one survivor and a killer) and the survivor stands in the middle of the pallet cause you not to be able to pull down the pallet without getting hit.
---
Cup killers are people who enter the world of beauty and the beast and chuck chip on the floor till he smashes.

This is canon in DBD lore

That clears it up, thanks

&gt;instant gratification and everything handed to you instead of working for it.

also you give off hella "that one uncle at thanksgiving that starts fights over politics every time for no reason" vibes
---
I've never heard of a "cup killer", who was you playing? That might help us figure it out lol
---
?
---
clown isn't bad because he's bad. he's bad because of the current state of the game. something almost every killer struggles from
---
Still have to deal with reverse skill checks.
---
&gt;The eternal "sKiN dEsIgNeRs CaN't BaLaNcE tHe GaMe LoL" argument is met with its eternal rebuttal:
---
&gt;"Why does Behaviour have so many skin designers and no one on the gameplay team?"
---
In swf you get comms, make safest saves, and does not have to waste time (e.g. save vs gen, looking for ruin etc).
---
This is far better than any other info perk (i,e. Bond/kindred) and if killer does not camp, eliminates the need for BT. Hell, just run DS and you dont even need BT for safe unhook
---
So by olaying i swf, its almost like you have at least +1 perk advantage. I do think OP‚Äô idea is overkill removing 3 perks for 4 man swf, but removing 1 is fine. Its information perk slot.
---
I think it would be nice of a gesture, but lacking in execution, because it‚Äôs always good to see a ‚ÄúSmAll‚Äù indie dev get recognized in bigger media. Sure Scott isn‚Äôt that small anymore but you get the idea.
---
Well you seem sure of yourself so it is what it is. This was just meant to be a discussion, devs aren't going to see this and be like WE NEED THIS PERSON ON OUR BALANCE DEPARTMENT and fly me to their studio with a skeleton key to the game. Just my opinion, if you don't agree fair enough.
---
So if someone uses a strategy to force you to eat a perk You will tunnel and camp them? Seems about right for someone who dodges toolboxes.
---
&gt;What is my purpose?
---
-
---
&gt;You buff Borrowed Time.
---
&gt;Oh my god.
---
Eat the stun or get kicked in the buns
---
Lowkey though, true is good.
---
 Tyde, HA. what a world
---
All killers have breathing, but you usually don‚Äôt notice it. Freddy has the whitest breathing and some of them like ghost face don‚Äôt even sound like breathing. But if you are playing legion or Michael or anyone with a mask you can hear your own breathing louder
---
They did with not queef. Anything is possible. We must be careful.
---
Teabagging is spamming crouch over and over again. Sandbagging is setting up your teammates for failure, whatever that may be. For example unhooking right in front of the killer, blocking a teammate being chased, leading the killer to another survivor on purpose to get the heat off you, etc.
---
i don't either
---
Huntress is one of those killer that are very map dependent, so the problem is some maps are very hard to play on cause of it. The solution to that would not be to buff her, this would just make her better on the maps she is bad on and a nightmare on maps she is already good on.
---
If they added in FNAF into DBD, I feel like it would be a killer spectacular. There's of course the various versions of the main 4 (mostly skins with the main 4 being the killers), you have Willy A, as well as the puppet and all 3 of her forms (lefty being the 3rd), as well as all the knockoff characters, namely Orville and the gang.
---
You could very easily make 30+ skins, with up to 6 or 7 new killers just to fit all the animatronics in. Main 4, Willy A, puppet, and maybe mangle.
---
Wait I'm lost
---
Im all for balancing swf cuz most of them are cocky, dc-ing c words. Screws up my game waiting for 5 minutes..just to get killed cuz you are t good.
---
That said, removing 2-3 perks are too much. Removing 1 is enough even for 4man swf. Essentially discord gives you information you need..which eliminates need for likes of bond/kindred/BT, etc...and that‚Äôs justifiably. But 3? Is a bit much.
---
Sure your 4man swf will have 1 guy who will run prove thyself and rush gen, but thats balancing Prove thyself,  it the swf part. (Since technically you can do prove thyself as solo with bond or something)
---
One perk slot, no more. Its overkill otherwise and penalises solo survivor as he/she will more likely die if found (as swf will not risk their lives)
---
Are you making it obvious your trying to pull of a basement 4K?
---
If you always try to haul ass towards the meat shack with a slug they will 100% of the time understand what your angle is for the match. 
---
Put your first hook near the basement so if they go for a rescue (90% of the time against Freddy/trapper they will because fuck us right?). 
---
Grab your second slug and throw them in the basement. 
---
Another thing that will help is to ALWAYS setup a patrol path. Your going to lose at least 1-2 gens accept that and let them take the safest ones. 
---
Most newbies won‚Äôt realize what‚Äôs going on but really experienced players will notice your setting up the last 3-5 gens to be in horrible positioning. 
---
Keep an eye out for sneaky vets who will try to fix gens on your patrol route forcing you to make a LONGER and WIDER loop. 
---
Also keep an eye out for the hatch, traps all over it because if you wind up in a scenario where you‚Äôve got a 3k basement that last guy will almost always just look for the hatch. 
---
If you have 1-2 slugs on basement hook and the hatch is open the last survivor will usually assume your going to guard the basement kills.
---
I always love when Otz gets excited.
---
I mean. Adept Ash was easy back when you didn't need protection hits for MoM. Completely passive perks. Now though, using MoM is probably the hardest thing to do in this game.
---
Same with ")" for ":)".
---
Slowdown while charging should stay, and making her 115 would just defeat the purpose of her hatchets. You‚Äôre saying all this stuff would help, but why not some kind of huntress addon that reduces the amount of RNG stuff in the map?
---
If your the last surviver it opens and you can escape witjout doing the rest of the gens or opening the doors
---
So how exactly is cutting down their designers/shop releases gonna help them fix bugs? If one part of the game needs improvement, how is cutting an unrelated, successful part of the game productive? Give me one reason that's not you throwing a temper tantrum.
---
And there's "no one on the gameplay team"? So bugs are just magically getting added and fixed, and content is just materializing out of nothing. A miracle!
---
Otzdarva also has some good pig gameplay, I think.
---
Streamsniping is considered cheating, besides being unsportsmanlike
---
tbh, i don't want a whole new power. i just want them to replace deep wounds with anything else. i love the theme of being a really fast stabby boi. just wish it was rewarding to do so
---
It's not bannable. I checked.
---
It's not cool, but not bannable.
---
Tbh i find using Stridor actually proves more of a liability than help. Since i've grown accustomed to playing without it, and being able to judge the distance between me and a survivor in a jungle gym just by sound alone, Stridor throws me completely off guard, as someone who i'd normally assume to be in lunge range without it will end up actually not being so, so me lunging through a pallet will just allow them to make even more distance.
---
Well the hatch will spawn when the amount of gens done is equal to the amount of players still alive +1, so if 2 people are alive there needs to be 3 gens left. But if you are the only survivor alive the hatch will automatically spawn, no matter how many gens are done. The hatch only opens once 1 survivor is left or a very rare key or Ultra rare key is used (when a key is used thew hatch stays open for 3 sec I think). The killer has the ability to close the hatch, this completes all gens and allows the survivors to open the gates. If a survivor jumps into a hatch they will instantly escape and get 5000 escape points and also 2000 extra for hatch escape.
---
Chances are it's a slur in another language.
---
Pretty sure we‚Äôve had bans in the past from this, but maybe they changed it. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm still fairly certain it‚Äôs considered cheating
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hatch
---
I think for sure it should be Afton.  Again, the link I sent I feel would really work.  The other skins I feel won‚Äôt really do justice, unless if it‚Äôs really realistic and less plastic if that makes sense.
---
People come on here running Self Care and immediately tossing pallets as survivor wondering why they lose to OP killers every game.
---
People come on here running Unrelenting and NOED complaining about how this games impossible and survivors just gen rush every game what's the point.
---
My point is there are players on this sub that desperately need help to improve their horrifically bad play and they simply won't find or get it in a sea of shit posts and low effort memes.  They're just karma farms they serve no purpose.  
---
Also agree to disagree there is quite a bit of thought, counterplay and skill that goes into both sides at the top level of compettion in this game.  There are things to talk about and advice to impart on here.
---
#~~Huntress~~ Dedicated Servers needs some ~~tweaks~~ removal.
---
There. Fixed the name of your thread.
---
I get this is a shitpost, but it wasn't funny at all. Next time post a DBD meme.
---
Don't.
---
There's your advice.
---
Yeah, I did notice they tend to write brackets without anything else... Is there a reason for that?
---
Are you okay here? Can you read? Did you even read it?It‚Äôs literally about legion continuing to be nerfed. Why even fucking comment on it if you aren‚Äôt going to read it. I don‚Äôt have time for whining or high handed comments.  I literally, if you can read it, said it‚Äôs about legion being nerfed and people continuing to complain about him after he‚Äôs been nerfed to hell. I do not give a shit about one hit downs.
---
That's what I thought at first but I posted a pic of the chat in this subreddit (it was removed), someone said it was canon in DBD lore
---
Yeah you are right, farming off hook is just farming. Sandbagging is slowing your team mate by body blocking whether intentional or not
---
True, but it does make it a lot easier... even shitty killers should be able to get the hit with 1 stack.
---
A small price to pay for 5K
---
Nah
---
Step 1. Buy Halloween DLC
---
Step 2. Play Laurie
---
Step 3. Get Decisive Strike
---
Congrats. There's your counter to camping and tunneling.
---
What? You don't want to spend $7 on a DLC just to get one perk that's literally mandatory to play the game because we can't balance it? Go fuck yourself we're Behavior Interactive give us your money! üòÇ
---
üôÇ
---
Because they aren't going to tailer the map design of every single map in the game for 1 killer let alone in an addon form. How the fuck would that even work anyways?. The point of the hatchets is to hit people from range or to set-up a quick 2 hit down if your close enough. The issue is with nearly ALL maps now there are very few spans of map you have the time to charge up your hatchet and actually throw it before they get behind some type of debree or obstacle. 
---
Making her standard 115 and not slowing her down while charging would fix multiple issues with her and make it so the developers don't have to make a second version of EVERY MAP IN THE GAME. Which they sure as hell won't do.
---
I have never heard that term before in my life.
---
I'm the one getting "hard patrolled" in all these scenarios
---
I can loop for like a minute max, not the greatest survivor in the world, but my spawn location must have a big glowing sign over it or something.
---
that's what is frustrating me - I feel like I have no agency in most of these games
---
There are a certain amount of gens and survivors in order for it to spawn. (Sorry for the layout, I am on mobile).
---
‚Ä¢4 survivors alive = 5 gens completed
---
‚Ä¢3 survivors alive = 4 gens completed
---
‚Ä¢2 survivors alive = 3 gens completed
---
If you are the last remaining survivor, it does not matter how many gens are completed the hatch will spawn. If the killer finds the hatch before you, they can close it, which will then power the exit gates and allow you open them to leave (unless the killer finds you and kills you). You can also use a key to open the hatch and escape as well. Only the dull key (purple one) and the skeleton key (red one) will open the hatch though.
---

Honestly, none of them do. Fungoose never plays her because he considers her the second weakest killer, weaker than Doctor. Ardetha has more videos on her, but nothing special. And Otzdarva considers she's one of the killers he knows less, giving his knowledge on her 2 out of 5.

Scorpionz is the streamer you want for Pig. He has around 4 or 5,000 hours on her alone.

SANDBAGGING is leading the killer to another survivor and getting them to take a hit or lead the chase. 
---
THAT IS ALL.

The definition is quite literally *‚ÄúTo deceive or coerce in the attempt to acquire an upper hand‚Äù*

You get chased, take a hit ‚ÄúBIG F-‚Äú.

This is useful info. However, I‚Äôll point out that they reference ‚Äúdribbling‚Äù, which is a pretty dated tech which applied back when Decisive Strike‚Äôs skillcheck showed *after* getting picked up, instead of during the pickup. Maybe we should do some more digging on this

---
Winning or losing because your playing a killer thats skill is only relavent 20% of the time is bad game design. Speeding her up to 115 and not slowing her down when charging her hatchet is the correct decision. She might be somewhat stronger on some maps she was already decent on but that doesn't suddenly make her opressive on those maps.
---
 If she could chuck a hatchet at you over an obstacle before moving 5% faster isn't going to make a difference your still eating that hatchet. Where it will make a difference is when she is on like the 80% or so of the maps that don't give her a clear shot for more than 1 second because of the map design.
---
That was one of the reasons as to why it didn‚Äôt work actually it‚Äôs been actual years since they‚Äôve talked about it though so I don‚Äôt remember all of the details.
---
Playing survivor alone if you are new or not that experienced is really painful, but I would just say find people to play with.

Why are your perks that color?

Oh fuck now I want loony tunes DBD
---
This is the funniest comment I've seen, and very descriptive and immersive. Thank you for that, paha
---
Dedicated servers certainly hurt her but going back to peer to peer wouldn't fix all the issues her design has with the newer map design the developers are forcing onto every map since last year.
---
Guess we should remove cannibal and Ghostface because we already have Billy and Micheal.
---
No i'm not toxic, I play games for fun and try and make it fun for everyone.  If I am killer and someone wastes a bunch of my time but his/her team did like no gens I will give them hatch or let them out.

I've escaped a few times using palettes and windows, but overall, I'm pretty trash lmao. I definitely need to learn how to get through chases better. I'm the type of survivor that usually hides, and often in closets. Which I guess you're not supposed to do because I haven't seen a single experienced streamer do it yet.
---
You might need a new monitor if the recording isn't showing it
---
Another option would be like in IDV where normally you can have as a big a group as you want but then in the red rank equivalent you can have a max swf of 2 that way people can play with friends and still have communication but they don‚Äôt have as much knowledge because they don‚Äôt know what the other 2 people are doing
---
Make a casual mode, dump SWF in there, combine it with KYF so it's like a casual free-for-all, and make ranked mode solo queue only. There, I fixed two problems with one answer.

I would say buffing her when the problem is the maps is poor balance. Let's say you are playing a certain level on Left 4 Dead that is really difficult, would you buff the weapons the characters are using? No you would make the map "easier" to play on. Same applies to Huntress, she has a slow down cause she has a ranged attack, I'm fine with removing he slowdown of her when charging but not make her 115% MS. And 5% MS is huge, why do you think everyone complains when we get 110% MS killers. 
---
Some loops as Huntress you can't win with Hatchets, so what do you do? You find a way by mind gaming or just leaving them. One easy thing to do is just to chase, cause eventually you will be close enough to M1 them, and in a lot of cases survivors might not drop the pallet cause that means they get hit my a hatchet resulting in them just running away after taking a hit.
---
Many people DC over me playing fair. I go out of ny way not to tunnel or camp and they still DC so there's absolutely 0% chance they won't DC over that.
---
Yeah. And as survivor it‚Äôs very hard to get bloodpoints cause picture this 
---
Team mate 1-Is getting in a lot of chases with the killer and winning(Boldness)
---
Team mate 2-Is doing gens(Objectives)
---
Team mate 3-Is healing and unhooking people(Alturism)
---
Team mate 4-Everyone else died and they escaped
---
One survivor is going to get more bloodpoints in each respective category cause out of every one else they did the most in that category. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs easier to get bloodpoints as killer. You are sharing with anyone and are working by yourself. But it is possible to get a lot of bloodpoints in all 4 categories but very unlikely

Never combine Sprint Burst with any other Exhaustion perk other than Adrenaline.  It doesn't allow you to use other exhaustion perks alongside it.  The Sprint Burst will steal your exhaustion everytime.

Legion, Doctor, Freddy. These three killers are completely and totally unfun to play against. If I have to stop playing the game every minute to hit skill checks in order to do anything, I‚Äôm not having fun. With Freddy it‚Äôs more the Forever Freddy build that is stupid as fuck. Skill checks aren‚Äôt immersive gameplay. Fix it.

Yes PUNISH people for playing with their friends. No, just no. I'm just gonna be honest here, the devs aren't gonna nerf Survivors JUST because they're playing with friends. No other online game does that so why should DbD? And not to mention it's not a smart business decision, cause anybody wanting to play with their friends would just go play some other game that doesn't punish them for doing so.

---
yeah, more advanced survivors tend to use lockers just for avoiding BBQ for 4 seconds after someone‚Äôs hooked, or in order to guarantee a decisive strike attempt (instead of running the risk of being slugged). 
---
the higher you climb the better killers will get at guessing when someone‚Äôs hiding in a locker. 
---
while learning loops, you‚Äôll die a lot because it takes a while to learn just how far away from the killer you need to be in order to avoid a hit, how to guarantee fast vaults, other timings &amp;c. it feels like you‚Äôre not getting better (or maybe even getting worse) but you really are improving every time you go toe to toe with a killer.
---
Well, ok, but that still could be said of any killer he plays. He's an extremely good player overall.
---
Freddy needs to keep his invisibility to awake survivors out of a certain range. IMO it needs to be a smaller range at base. It's stupid how far away I can see Freddy when I'm awake.
---
toxic swfs are players that abuse the time it takes to do gens and really safe loops to make it almost impossible for a killer to both down survivors at a reasonable rate and apply enough gen pressure to actually win. Its possible but the amount of sweat a killer has to produce to beat a swf is enough to drown a person, while the swfs just have to use basic mechanics in an extremely coordinated way.
---
Basically as long as you aren't tryharding then you'll be fine. You'll do better than most solo queue players simply because you'll be more coordinated but if you aren't specifically making a lot of effort to fuck the killer over then they killer has a reasonable chance to do well. The only way to make toxic swfs more fair is for the devs to change gen speed and reduce the amount safe loops. The problem with gen speed is that its pretty fair for solo queue so changing it to be balanced for swfs would screw over regular players.
---
As an Ash main, I declare all toxic Ashs ungroovy.
---
Nope, all is fine.
---
I like the running part of his power. But I think they should do a personality disorder type killer. Since the four members were taken at the same time, they could be linked. So imagine if you could switch between 4 powers (one of them being feral frenzy) and it would switch your character. 
---
They would have to make it so in the outfit selection screen could customize each legion member separately. I.e. having Frank be los muertos while Susie is sweater Susie.
---
They could make a new Susie and Joe skin go give to everyone who bought the original Susie and Joey. (Since this would require the two members be free.)
---
Yeah it's just "playing the game without spiciness thrown on top"
---
teabags and clicking are obvious examples of it, but there are more subtle things too like survivors interactions with other survivors. Sandbagging/ hook farming- "no bullshit" means generally respectful and focused on the game.
---
There are some cases though where even "no bullshit" survivors end up getting spicy. Like if the killer is facecamping someone for seemingly no reason, everyone else will throw in teabags/ clicks to get their attention and rub in how much they dislike the killer.
---
"No bullshit" is generally an awareness of the respect going both ways.

---

---
The game comparison doesn't really apply here. Additionally, THEY WILL NOT make a second version of every single map in the game JUST for the huntress. It's just not going to happen period. Leaving her in the mostly unplayable state she is currently in isn't the solution either.
---
5% movement speed is what she needs if she is going to be playable in the new map design environment. She already has to invest a signifigant amount of time reloading her limited power. She just isn't balanced properly anymore and that needs to change.
---
 You can say that because she has ranged hatchets she needs to be slower to balance that out but the fact of the matter is if she can't ever USE said hatchets because of the way the maps are designed then it isn't balanced anymore. Thats also assuming somehow having hatchets itself demands the nerf to her baseline kit.
---
Look at the hillbilly one of the most balanced killers in the game. He has a 1 shot down AND immense map mobility. Does that mean he should be 110% to make up for the shorter chase/travel times he gets? No of course not the same principle applies to the huntress. I don't know when it started to apply but the notion that a killers power/addons MUST have severe signigiant drawbacks to using it is as stupid as can be.

Your the fucking killer not some asthmatic crippled hobble.

You can counter Dead Hard if they don't use it right. If they always try to bait out the swing, yes, you can counter it. But anyone who is good will use Dead Hard for distance. If your chasing someone, you can't do anything if they use dead hard to make it to the window or pallet, you can't do anything. DS can be countered by leaving them slugged, but with Unbreakable being more popular, it doesn't matter. Leave them slugged, they use Unbreakable, you pick them up, DS, your fucked either way. Deliverance yes can be countered, but then you have to predict someone has it, and tunnel them so they can't use it.

No idea but considering how dbd's underlying systems work it appears it gave the debuff again. I don't believe dbd has any line of code for purely visuals or purely debuffs. Pretty sure they're interconnected.

I personally didn't see the OP in this thread, honestly all the statuses suck if it only lasts while in Deep Wound with how easy it is to mend. It's not a good change to Legion at all if this were the case, which also won't happen since we have 2 add-ons that literally do 2 of these affects but better in the pins.

So make him the strongest killer in the game by far?

Eh, this actually is an improvement for the Halloween community. We all know what Michael looks like without a mask, and when the movies first came out, Michael beneath the mask (Nick Castle) looked like Adam Sandler. Now Michael beneath the mask looks like a much scarier motherfucker. With Nick's age and proper makeup, they made him look horrifying, but Nick in his prime could never have pulled off a good, scary face reveal. Hes too lovable. 
---
[This](https://bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Nick-Castle.jpg) and [this](https://bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/nick-castle-halloween-2018.jpg) show just how lovable the guy looks. I think old age is the only thing that allowed him to actually pull off a face reveal, which he definitely deserves. This may be the last Nick Castle Halloween we see, and he deserves to be immortalized in such an iconic role on the big screen.

So all I'm seeing is if the Trapper plays badly then he's punished for it. All but 1 of the downsides I pointed out for Legion are what you're going to always run into as Legion no matter how well you play or what perks/add-ons you run. You still lose that baseline tracking, still had the long cooldowns and stuns, still lose the ability to down unless you're gonna argue that the 5 Frenzy hits with Frank's is worth it, and hell are even punished in even getting your power from regular M1's outside of it.
---
more downsides than trapper for sure. Again, not pointing out counters or how easily you can play like an idiot as Trapper or any other killer.

---
I actually believe he is a lot of fun to play as. As mentioned before by me and others, if he finds you, you are pretty much dead plus his slowdown is a lot more effective than Freddy's because he doesn't have to place traps and can use his bottles freely, he can use his bottle outside of loops and prevent survivors from reaching them and the intoxicated person is disoriented which really fucks with their vision. Sure he doesn't have gen teleportation or fake pallets and has to reload his bottles while Freddy can place them freely but there is some beauty in his simplicity.
---
That is encouragement
---
Dogs are the ones that meow, right?
---
A survivor tried doing this to me once jts pretty easy to catch especially if they run towards the locker
---
The crossplay they have implemented is for windows and steam users to play together and not for PC &amp; console players. PC killers would destroy console survivors so it wouldn‚Äôt be fair. 
---
If they were to bring crossplay between PC &amp; console then they would have to do something to balance them.

Dad beats the shit out of kid trying to take his daughter on a date

I wouldn't mind testing it out. My theory would be that survivor had DS as well and the game got confused somewhere and thought that stun was a DS stun and made them the obsession but not really? I play on PC btw. I could be wrong about the stacks thing. It's always inconsistent with how stacks work in this game anyways lol. 
---
I agree the perk pretty bad. You need to put alot of work into it while buffing a survivor you want to avoid and you may only have it for like 1 or 2 chases at full potential anyways.
---
Who the hell cares? I'm going with Franklin's Demise and Franklin himself. And you bet i'll slug everyone.

Dedicated Servers made Huntress about 100 times worse on both sides. Huntress went from one of my favorite Killers to play against to my third most hated Killer. There's not a single hatchet that hits anymore which doesn't make me say "HOW DID **THAT** HIT?!"
---
I wish Behavior would just admit that they screwed up with Dedicated Servers and go back to peer-to-peer. I'd have a lot more respect for them if they admitted their faults instead of pretending that nothing is wrong and having the game suffer as a result.
---
You mean all killers are viable. 
---
Depends on what kind of group you're going against. I think the main problem of this game is that they need to try and balance around both SWF and solo queue. With lack of critical info solo queue is at a mega disadvantage compared to SWF so decision making fails.
---
It's like if in a MOBA you didn't have a minimal and the ability to see what was going on in lanes. You might overextend if you didn't know the jungler was not, etc. Kindred buff helps but it's not enough really.
---
There were so many times I was able to escape because of DS. I owe it my soul.

Nothing that's what

His noises.
---
I'd like to see springtrap added.
---
For what his power could be I got this idea form another post that talk about springtrap.
---
His power would take elements from doctor and spirit.
---
While survivors are outside his TR they would build up a status called dread which is similar to madness.
---
To Lower dread suevrneed to be within sprintraps TR or look at him.
---
However his other Power is built up when survivors do that.
---
He can do something akin to spirit where he can phase through areas however his version has some differences.
---
He has to have survivors in his TR or have them look directly at him to increase his power gauge unlike spirit who recharges it other time.
---
Another difference is that he can see survivors whilw phasing however he isn't completely invisible as you can still see him the same way you would see cloaked Wraith and his red stain is slightly visible.
---
The idea is that survivors have to look at Springtrap to remove dread otherwise they suffer severe penalties but if they do sprintrap will be able to use his phase power which to a degree is stronger than spirits but he can't use it as much so he's like Oni in this regard.

Just had a game where I faced someone with DS. Even after chasing someone else for a bit, this claudette caught my attention and I chased. She jumped into a locker which instantly makes me lose all pressure. Aka she got away for free, but I‚Äôve recently adopted a new rule for myself where I‚Äôll eat the DS and then tunnel them till they‚Äôre dead if 2 or more gens are done.  
---
DS into locker is just too strong for a survivor to have as a power.  
---
I can‚Äôt put any pressure on someone with DS in a locker, unless I want to waste 60 seconds in front of the locker.
---
I shouldn't need to have recording software active at all times just to catch someone holding the game hostage. I understand that hacks and other such things are not easily foreseeable but a problem with the game which has existed since its release should be fixed by the devs by now.
---
But considering that they added the Six Feet Under challenge and didn't make DCs count for the challenge I don't think these devs know anything about their game or their community.

I ended up with 2 kills and slugged a third  before the last guy figured out what I was trying to do. I got it, but that last asshole kept running across the opposite side of the map. Had to pick up the slugged guy who was on top of the hatch (which spawned in the killer shack where the basement was). Hooked him, he died, saw the last guy, knew he was going for the hatch, downed him, picked him up, hooked him and closed the hatch. 4k basement challenge complete. I used Trapper though.
---
Seizure inducing.
---
He is hot, bill use him to light his smoke stick :p
---
Undetectable only removes terror radius and red stain, it does not affect spine chill.
---
...I feel bad, just got the 4K in the basement as Nurse.
---
_Didn‚Äôt have the challenge so I know I won‚Äôt be getting it later._
---
i was literally in the middle of typing the explanation comment. how did you comment so fast. this post was made like 20 seconds ago lol
---
I got told I was getting reported for body blocking as the killer to make them step in my trap on way out of basement. I tried to explain that is meant for survivor sandbagging each other and they weren‚Äôt having any of it . Still waiting for my ban
---
As long as it only happens in a small radius, the dread idea is really nice actually.  Maybe a different name, but I like it.
---
you mean diving the hook in front of the killer and faking a rescue to make him whiff?
---
Jutsu* not jitsu
---
Jitsu is a form of close quarters combat. 
---
Jutsu is a mystical ninja combat art. :-p
---
Which technique was that though? Maybe the 4th speed/teleport thing?
---
Well true he is more effective than Freddy in slow down I think that he's just too simple. I think Huntress is way more fun than clown but she isn't simple as the way the clown is. I am a Trapper main and I understand beauty in simplicity. I wish the clown had more levels of gameplay. I saw a idea about switching up the tonics. I would totally play clown if you could do that but its one for now
---
You literally started repeating what I said as examples of "being political" so don't lie and give me that bs! And idk what guy has shortygirl as their name but ok lol! And I can't ignore your point when you don't have one....*furry Nea* Bahaha wtf kinda cringe üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
OP
---
Against experienced survivors camping basically forfeits the rest of the game
---
I like how people are having mixed feelings about this clearly cynical comment chain so some of them are downvoted and some are upvoted
---
I think it's worse he uses THE SAME FUCKING BACKGROUND MUSIC IN EVERY SINGLE FUCKING VIDEO.
---
really a rollercoaster of emotions lol
---
I don‚Äôt get why people do this just keep working on gen . I get it would go up for a bit but you‚Äôre just wasting time
---
Nerf Ruin first.
---
Why is this comment getting downvoted? Buying a character cause you think they look cool is completely reasonable. I bought The Clown cause I hella love clowns and the fact that he laughs whenever he gets a hit or gets his skull caved in with a pallet.
---
 a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often amusing as a result:  
---
"the **irony** is that I thought he could help me"   
---
Okay.
---
This particular scene comes from survivors being found in the bathroom at gideon's meat plant
---
i remember that name lmao
---
I mean it goes both ways. I've had survivors get mad about me using the meme Hex: Russian Roulette build.
---
Thanks for the correction I obviously don't watch enough anime lol
---
I‚Äôve actually come up with an idea for dogs myself AGES ago...
---
You could issue them three commands.
---
‚ÄúBark‚Äù
---
Just a noise indicator for the killer at least 15m away from yourself 
---
‚ÄúFetch‚Äù
---
If a chest is nearby, the dog will grab the item in it for you and bring it to your position
---
‚ÄúAttack‚Äù
---
The dog charges at the killer if he is nearby. If the dog hits the killer, he is stunned for a tiny bit. The killer can hit the dog mid-charge to interrupt and kill it.
---
Problem would be all the buttons tho.
---
&gt; They rely on survivors being worse, and the survivor making a mistake. So perks that let survivors fix their mistakes, with almost no counter at all, is very unfair.
---
Yikes dude are we in 2018. if you play a top tier killer, you are on fair game with the survivors. Hell i do really well with mid tier and low tier killers as well.
---
DS last 60 secs, why would you chase someone when they have been hook recently? there is always another survivor close that you can chase. 
---
DS should have its timer halfed when someone gets hooked though. i think that would be a good change.
---
You complain about DH being used like that but SB is literally just DH but on crack. 
---
Deliverance doesnt even have that much of a benefit, and its much easier to counter then NOED. that one person has to get a safe hook rescue and not get hooked previously while with NOED you have to hunt down 5 totems on a map that somtimes is impossible depending on the map.
---
Telling the OP that OP is OP
---
The others are correct, but instead of saying +1 just count the killer, too.  
---
The amount of people in a game determine how many gens need to be completed for the gen to appear. So at 5 people alive(including killer) 5 gens need to be completed in order for the hatch to spawn.  
---
I found it confusing at first to keep remembering what the rule is, but seeing the killer as a person helped me with the count.
---
*Teleports behind you*
---
Terror could be the name of it.
---
For balance springtrap should have a normal sized TR so he can't abuse terror and his add ons would focus on lowering his TR or increasing terror and phase build up.
---
It puts survivors into a bad situation where if you don't look at Springtrap you'll suffer from bad status Effects but if you do he'll be able to use his phase power.
---
The would give him some chase potential and make it harder to loop him to a degree.
---
I still got my hook and someone came down to save them and they dc. So I feel bad for the person that got caught down there to help them lol
---
" a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often amusing as a result. "  
---
Irony has more than definition bud
---
Clearly they didn't look at their Spine Chill icon.
---
Is reporting as unsportsmanlike for rage dc‚Äôs okay?
---
It certainly does work, I got the skill checks without being injured and it counted. Wouldn't be surprised if it was bugged though
---
Make the punishment harsher at base, but give exponentially more benefits the more you chain Frenzy hits. I think the recent buffs to the pins are the perfect example of encouraging Legion to always spread between multiple targets. The pins do nothing to the first target, but afflict the following survivors with the hemorrhage/blind/broken which I think is an excellent change.
---
Make the base frenzy stun like 5 seconds, but every survivor you hit after the first decreases the stun by .5 seconds. Make the Frenzy speed increase .2m/s or 5% up to a certain cap every time you hit a survivor to help apply more pressure, even slow it down at base beforehand to balance it out. Increase the duration by 1 second for each survivor hit with frenzy to further encourage and apply the pressure, if it's too much I would decrease the current Frenzy from 10 seconds to like 6 seconds, and then make the increase be several seconds per frenzy hit so you still have to work for that first hit.
---
Rework all the add-ons with this in mind, particularly I think the tapes should each focus on 1 aspect of Legion and further boost it. Tracking, Slowdown, Speed, Damage, and rework the Fuming one to give Legion infinite Frenzy with a drastic cooldown and stun but in turn always have Deep Wounds going down for survivors no matter what. Keeping in mind only 1 tape can be used at once. Have the tracking one replace killer instinct with auras, reveal gen progression of gens, and have like a built-in bloodhound effect, Have the speed one greatly increase your speed at the cost of slightly faster drain of your power, Have the slowdown one apply a repair/healing debuff (similar to how Huntress and the chainsaws do) for a set amount of time, like say 15ish seconds (since I am aware how easy it is to frenzy hit) on the first target than an additional 5 seconds on subsequent targets. Have the damage one apply Mangled and also remove a 1/3rd of the deep wound timer each time you hit a survivor IF it isn't the same survivor in a row, to encourage you to bounce between the targets and also potentially down survivors with frenzy for once if used correctly.
---
reward Legion adequately for actually pulling off 4+ Frenzy hits and also encourage them to go for it. Don't punish them so harshly for fucking it up since at base usage it is impossible to even get a survivor downed/incapacitated in the first place.
---

yea no actually i have a point, you said IRI heads dont need to be changed bc life isnt fair, but then in the same breath you said that i want instant gratification and everything handed to me. 
---
Do you have any sense of irony? IRI heads are literally just easy mode huntress, its literally getting a participation trophy
---
I dunno if these are supposed to be sarcastic, but NM with UB creates super fast recovery that you can use infinitely. Pretty nice.
---
Nah we want both pc and console. Have it as an option so people like you dont have to use it.
---
Thats because it‚Äôs called idling
---
I was able to get it twice in a row using trapper (the first time was the five hooks in the basement, I just happened to get everyone in there). For add ons, use the purple dye that darkens the traps and blends in with the wood, and maybe the add on that puts survivors in dying state. The most important thing is don‚Äôt stay too close to the basement after hooking.
---
Ghostface isn't really a good killer to try this with, but you should also definitely swap out mad grit and monstrous shrine, neither of them usually do anything to help, especially monstrous shrine. Swap atleast one out for ruin so you have more time in the match to actually get them to the basement
---
No Mither + Med-Kit with Syringe.

Plz Nerf wes is too much of a god

The song is Age of Consent - Heartbreak for anyone wondering. This video is just for fun :) Majority of clips were in red and purple ranks

Yes and it still doesn‚Äôt apply to what was said ‚Äúbud‚Äù

So you never see the killer and leave the trial feeling cheated?
---
Love this idea.
---
I dont think its that deep. You can say on fortnite pc players destroy console but its not that deep. I played PC but I prefer console. And have it as an option so people scared of crossplay dont have to use it.
---
OP?
---
I love the survivor's who get mad at 5 totem meme hex builds
---
That hook tech is actually stupid. Killer just doesn't swing and now 1 survivor is on a hook while the other is doing literally nothing while the killer just has to hang out.
---
What about Quentin?
---
Turned it down. Not enough upward mobility and I really don‚Äôt want to work with my mother.
---
Im on pc as well if you want to test it , if your interested whisper me. But yea its pretty bad but thats just the way bhvr recently. Pretty much anything fun gets nerfed/removed and anything killer related has some severe drawback to use it because reasons.
---
His ability to get hit By every hatchet possible
---
No Mither + Self-care + Unbreakable + Adrenaline
---
Med-kit with syringe
---
Honestly the best way to counter this is to get into purple ranks. Sounds dumb but killers who pull that shit will never rank up past green. The game won't let them. Newish killers don't realize how negatively that affects their games. And bad killers don't care as long as they get at least one kill but they will never rank up past green. Obviously you will find campers in every rank but it's much much less common below rank 8. Killers camping below rank 8 are super salty at either you or their last game. I know that isn't what you wanted to hear but it's really the only way. If it's a genuine facecamp there isn't anything you can do. Just genrush them while they waste time and hurry to lower ranks.
---
Your on the map- Reported

Add my will to live up there and you got yourself a true statement

Sounds pretty complicated
---
Awww triggered by emojis bc I'm literally laughing at your stupidity lol! Sorry but being a furry is cringe not using emojis. And idgaf about iri heads bc I'm not gonna cry about how unfair the game is when a huntress uses it and that they should've let me win whaa whaa so why do you keep bringing it up?! Move on...
---
Not necessarily but he obviously doesn‚Äôt know how to play it
---
Why am i seeing sprint burst everywhere all the sudden?
---
inb4 deep wound actually downs you
---
The exhausted effect doesn't deplete while you're running
---
I want to know too
---
I kinda wanted it that way. It gives the legion a high skill floor but a big payoff if you can play them right.
---
Yea going back to peer to peer would probably be better for the game overall but they've already invested too much money and manpower to get the shitty dedicated servers we have now. In addition dedicated servers assuming they do work properly , prevents some cheating like lag-switching and can properly track disconnects. Hopefully, they iron out the many game-breaking bugs dedicated servers brought sooner rather than later.
---
Dead hard can allow you to get to a pallet you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have made. It can allow you to make god windows you might not have made otherwise. You can even use it against a huntress as a free health state by avoiding her hatchet that would otherwise miss. You can‚Äôt play around those. Sure, you can play around someone using it in the middle of nothing, or if youre right on top of them and wait it out.
---
DS can not be countered if someone jumps in a locker. Or if they‚Äôre close to an open gate and have the time to crawl out. You also can‚Äôt counter things like unbreakable unless you‚Äôre camping someone that‚Äôs slugged. The only way you can counter DS is by slugging, and that‚Äôs boring as shit for everyone, and again survivors can prevent this by jumping in lockers and forcing you to either eat the DS or letting them run around.
---
Deliverance isn‚Äôt something you counter. Either they have it and used it and succeeded to get off or they didn‚Äôt. If they happen to have DS it also activated that. Only way to counter it is to camp a hook and force them into 2nd stage. Or they get bad RNG.
---
If a killer has to hook someone near the gate they can deliverance off the hook and if they have DS it‚Äôs activated making it potentially impossible for a killer to kill them unless said player misses the skill check.
---
NOED is literally a useless perk 90% of the time and I can‚Äôt even comprehend survivors that get upset about it.
---
Yeah, mood
---
It's true, my friend. I am sorry.
---
I was the killer when it happened, I killed the toxic guy, showed his friend I killed him, hung him, and both of us kinda left him there. He DCd.

Sounds like you're a hacker

---
What Killer you trying it on? I find stealthier Killers have an easier time, I quite consistently get 3 stacks on Pig. After that, it either gets cleansed or I'm winning so hard it doesn't matter.
---
Thrill combos well with it I suppose, if you're playing a mobile hero like Hag or Billy, generally though, don't be too obvious when checking on it but always either A) Steer near it and dont veer too far or B) Avoid the area it's in as much as possible and try to make the Survs focus on the opposite side.
---
Generally though, it's 99% luck on where it spawns, In a corner near nothing of interest? Nobody is likely to find it until they know you have it. Also, don't run it with other Hexes except Thrill, because Hexes will cause them to go totem hunting.
---
In the back story its shown that the other members don't really kill and some lacked enough heart to do it without others goading them . 
---
I think just patrolling the area (making sure no one catches them in their crime is more appropriate) is better
---
üò≥ Thank you
---
If you do really well with mid to low tier killers, then what rank are you as killer? At red ranks, hell even purple ranks survivors have way more tools then killers do to get their objective done. Top tier killer's are being proven to be on a downhill. Oni was at least A tier when he came out, but now he's been nerfed into the ground. Both Spirit and Nurse got nerfs to them as well, while Spirit only got addons nerfed and is imo more fair, Nurse's fatigue is so long and she can get juked so hard she's not nearly close to what she was before. Hillbilly and Huntress are pretty much the only good killers left, and I wouldn't be suprised if they get nerfed as well. The idea that 1 survivor perk that almost everyone runs should excuse you from getting chased by the killer is just busted by design. Your saying that if all 4 have DS, I shouldn't chase any of them for 60 seconds? 60 seconds is huge, a gen getting done by 1 survivor with no great skill checks or no toolboxs or speed up perks takes 80 seconds, so not chasing a survivor for that long lets them get too much done. Sprint Burst is nearly as bad as Dead Hard, but at least Sprint Burst forces the survivor to walk everywhere or else they risk it being on cooldown when you get to them. Dead Hard doesn't hinder the survivor in any way, and if they use it correct (for distance not for baiting) then their is nothing you can do about it. Again, NOED is able to be countered by the survivors before it is used, and while Deliverence is too, you have to be lucky that the survivor you just hooked had it, and that the unhooker doesn't.

The irony of the situation is that your statement implied that dedicated servers fixed the issues with the mcdonalds wifi killers, even though they 1. didn't and 2. prevent you from seeing if or when you are being matched with them because you can no longer see their ping, OR their ping to the server you are both playing on. That is a state of affairs that is contrary to what is expected from reading your statement, and thus it is rather amusing.
---
And I don't want to be jump scared when stepping in my traps as trapper
---
No, all killers can be played but none are viable. Viability means you can at least technically achieve victory by playing correctly. You can't win while playing flawlessly if the survivors also play flawlessly. The balance is, at the highest level, survivors will always win. It's not a huge deal because few teams are a.) cohesively good enough and then also b.) tryhard, but that's the general balance of DbD. It also obviously scales. Good teams that will fuck up ocassionally still can't lose against the worst of the worst killers even with good players behind them, then solid teams with okay teamwork will lose against a super good high tier killer etc. There's lots of scaling and every individual player's mistakes can change a whole match drastically. But in a purely design point of view, no killer is viable.
---
And yes, the issue is the discrepancy of swf and solo. Bhvr is somehow delusional enough to think requiring solos to waste perk slots to get info swf gets for free is closing the gap, when it's not at all. They're really bad at maintaining the game, truthfully, especially considering the solution is obvious: Buff survivors globally in meaningful ways that majorly affect solos but minimally affect premades, then globally buff killers to compete with that. Also increase pallet counts but remove non-mindgame loops (and probably remove these stupidly unsafe pallets that are 100% death in 5 seconds, they're dumb.

PC players with mouse &amp; keyboard have an unfair advantage over console players with a controller. A controller is very limiting with movements. Shooting games like you mention can give console players strong aim assist to counter pc players control but it‚Äôs difficult to balance in the same way in dead by daylight. PC nurse players would completely destroy console players experience without a doubt.
---
It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúpeople scared of crossplay‚Äù but it‚Äôs the unfair advantage of keyboard and mouse and the frame rate limitations of consoles.
---
My bad, they both are about the same skin color and the only thing you can kinda see is their eyes (not being racist, look at the image and tell me that you can easily tell the difference)

I would use the fuck out of a grandma Laurie Skin

I'll shoot you a whisper but wouldn't we need a 3rd person to test this with? 1 to die on hook as obsession a second have head-on and the killer?
---
Which one?
---
Prolly has the kill 4 people in basement challenge
---
Dunno
---
Good meme, I like it.
---
Exactly, the idea was someone else's and I can't remember if it was here or in a twitch chat I saw it first. But basically the other sentinel, legions would only apply deep wounds if you made direct contact with them and after hitting a survivor they would get stunned for a period of time
---
Red rank survivors are not the same as red rank killers. Almost all survivors hang out in red because pipping is too easy. This causes two things: it makes red pull killers from red, purple, and sometimes green, and it also makes the skill variety in red absolutely absurd. You're essentially playing a sort of "unranked" mode (aka, there *is* no matchmaking) once you get to purple, because red has everyone from SWF swat teams to potatoes that have 100 hrs. They just need to make red rank more exclusive somehow so that it maps more closely to player skill and the matchmaking starts working again.
---
Point is, just play through it. Red numbers are meaningless, you're essentially just playing against literally everyone at every skill level.
---
Well, if you're playing the hag, you're the one trying to give a heart attack to your survivors :p
---
Thank you it happens way to often for me

Cute drawings and I like as a legion main

Yeah but have it as an option. So people like me who think this game is fun not competitive wouldnt care about this slight edge. Hence the option.
---
It's always dudes with Cyrillic names that dc when they go down first.
---
Awww!, He had wholesome intent okay
---
It's both occasions as well.
---
If you're Killer and you witness that they are going only for one specific person through the entirety of the match. Let it alone last half an hour to make an estimate of pure annoyance where they want to toy around with one person or abuse trust and etc. they don't care about others. This is what the report description mainly goes for. If they waste time on spoiling only one person's gameplay. Even if it is SWF or not SWF. They just want to show in-game how they hate the living guts out of you or want your attention. (Let it alone be a streamer but not always steamers can be bad hearted) Besides, I had moments where the Killer ignored everyone and wanted me just because I dropped a pallet or he wasted whole match against me and for example it can also be a newbie but those matches last short and not a subtle thing to report for.
---
As for Survivors who want only attention and crave for it immensely as they use THOSE perks to get to you and obviously most of the time flashlight users. I don't need to explain this one because most of them are going to disconnect as soon as they're downed. Because they expect a soft user who's playing Killer. They don't care about gens. They care about pallets or loops to waste your time. Thus the obvious to spam crouch button and flick their flashlights at you. It's also very common to see them being followers of YouTubers /Streamers who are a wannabe players that think they're hot but they aren't. ...Because they also tend to leave the game where the Killer completely ignores them or even picking Killer that they don't want to go against. This is basically half of the community right now in Dead by Daylight too.
---
Also, also I apologize if I made a vague start but I meant to address it formally. Again, the report description on this one exists and states one.
---
cus it gets clicks when you post it like that. people dont like doing this but you tube forces you too if you want anyone too see your videos.
---
i had a somewhat similar [idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ed9qr3/legion_rework_concept/) what do ye think?
---
Twitch.tv
---
Very much so Sir, I, Like many killers, need wall hacks to find survivors. Not like this game makes it piss easy.
---
they're streamers, ttv means twitch.tv
---
There's a difference between a word that has two distinct definitions, such as lame, and the argument at hand. 
---
But I will humor you and your blatant attempt at trolling or purposefully ignoring the point: 
---
Yes, if I was around a physically impaired person who told me the term 'lame' hurt their feelings because it implied they were lesser, I would apologize and refrain from using it, because that's what a sensible human would do.
---
Ah ok, thanks.

Ok, that somewhat explains there behavior, they were doing the typical antics that that ochido dude did, trying to be annoying little shits.

Yeah I was just correcting you because I thought it was funny

Underrated comment

I'm using Ghostface becausr he is one of my best killers and he is one of the killers with the most perks available.
---
I‚Äôve been trying with Pig for like 2 hours and *finally*  just got it! 
---
I ended up doing the full Hex build (Ruin, HG, TOTH, and DH) and that worked. I was alternating full hex and then only Devour to see which would work.
---
I just got it off the shrine, so Pig is the only killer I have it on, but I‚Äôll have to level some others and give it a shot!

I am not gonna kill any dogs :(
---
We already have demodoggo
---
Apparently not
---
They should increase its time and make it deactivate if someone else gets hooked
---
Rank up should be harder is the solution to the biggest problem in the matchmaking now in red you have like survivor a very long queue and killer is insta and in the grey ranks is the opposite  if you make harder rank up that would reduce the poblation of survivors in red ranks and increse the poblation of survivors in the lower ranks
---
This is the way.
---
I have literally never seen anything positive happen from including 'twitch' in your name, in literally any game I've ever played.
---
I said it you are not making an actual game change it would be just points to make it more attractive to play so not everyone would play ruin/corrupt.

since hags traps trigger from walking/running near, and hag cannot crouch, hag would trigger her traps 100% of the time as she is walking away

---
I play mostly Scoops Steve and P3 Nancy and Yui, and I feel like I'm a pretty "No bullshit" player. But I did main mostly killer until recently so.

I suffered the same, but the survivor wanted to do gens and I realized he had the dark sense challenge so I let him do it and he let me kill him, I love it
---
Ash would snap Hag in half and we all know it

Honestly they should make it to where the crows start forming over you if you haven‚Äôt worked on a gen in so long. That ways if they keep hiding eventually you will have their location from the crows
---
What about making smoke signals show the auras of all the gens in the map for a few seconds for everyone?
---
That way it's a support perk and it remains different from detective's hunch.
---
Could only be used once or twice per match though.
---
That's still horribly inefficient considering this pallet should take you 5 seconds max to get a down on.
---
Copped
---
Wtf is boop the snoot
---
Seems I am the ultimate centrist
---
Here's a reminder that you reply-reminded.
---
Myers and Literally Anyone.
---
Think about it: If Myers hits Tier 3, all survivors have Exposed. They go down one hit from every killer, not just Myers. 
---
Pair Myers with a high mobility killer and its hard to win
---
Bring back the flick
---
Right after placing a bear trap, you can safely walk right over it. But if you come back, you get caught in it
---
The whole rating thing is pretty stupid anyway. Besides David and Laurie no one has perks that really hamper them as survivor.
---
Killers are supposably rated on how easy they are to understand and use, not their skill level. Trapper is easy, he picks up traps and sets them.
---
David is 100% himbo. Rapscallion troublemaker. Maybe gets into some street fights, might cause some property damage, but that‚Äôs showbiz innit? Big dumb lunk. Rocks for brains. Nose flick.
---
Life of a Jake main :(
---
No, just no.
---
Feeling that so much. So often I'd have a nice game, and then assholes start teabag ging a killer who played fair and square; get that shit out of here srsly
---
Same here.
---
Also, I take these words to heart: Ghost Beaters never leave a man behind
---
If someone's hooked, you bet your ass I'll get em!
---
(if people can't read the picture)
---
- Susie, Joey, and Frank are played each match
---
- While playing, press the power button to conjure a mall catalog to switch character, switching cues a 1.5 second animation
---
- Each Legion member gets 1 chance to link to a survivor, while not being controlled, they follow that survivor at a very low speed (70%)
---
-Switching characters gives a loud audible warning to survivors so they can start running just in case their linked member is right by them.
---
- Each member applies different debuffs with their m1 - Frank is Deep Wound (Must be mended) - Julie is mangled (Must be healed) - Joey is oblivious (Lasts 60 seconds, hitting the same survivor does not refresh or pause the timer if it's still up) - Susie is hindered (Lasts 10 Seconds
---
- Legion moves at 110% movement speed
---
- Normal Lunge and Terror Radius
---
How'd you bully her?
---
Then how is Wraith intermediate? He cloaks, and he uncloaks.

My cat usually tries to lay on the screen lol

billy
---
Does anyone know why I can‚Äôt see chat after my games? Do you have to get to red ranks or something?
---
I dont remember when it was removed, but I think it was because of the new survivor lobby
---
It means you mori them for all their streamers to see
---
We constantly ran infinites, flashlight spam, teabagged, camped pallets, and my friend with Object kept teabagging at Ruin even though we worked around it.
---
What rank are you?
---
The doctors treatment sparks are missing textures... The transparent photoshop background
---
Also the usual bodyblocking and hook taunting
---
Huntress and Tapp
---
You're giving the killer tier 2 and making it easier for him to catch you, why would you stay there and let him get his ability up? One person not doing gens is better than one person doing a gen just to get hooked 30 seconds later
---
It's an invulnerability perk, not an anti-tunneling perk.
---
Because there was a glitch involving it where you could prestige another character without levelling them up to 50. I'm pretty sure it also allowed you to get infinite add ons in the bloodweb, such as iridescent heads. Ngl, I'm a piece of shit but I actually stockpiled on moris and heads... for future use.

No I mean when someone fucks up gen skill check and they stand up and point . I know how Myers works lol
---
What was the point of the legion nerf again
---
Love how you assume the Survivor will actually be good. Most aren't. Only ever see good survivors every 60 matches or so. Even at purple ranks
---
Why play like that?
---
Then my frail, naked buns shall ravaged on this blessed night!
---
I doubt that will happen, in the last stream they straight up said it was unintended and not something they wanted in his kit

Rank 8. I wasn't originally planning on playing today, but screw it.

I wish I knew about this

Clown should get slowed down by his bottles, Freddy should trigger his snares, Plague should get affacted by her vomit and die, Doctor shouldn‚Äôt be able to use his power because he reaches madness III, etc...

We can add all of these by your logic right?
---
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre serious or not lmao
---
Ah shit, I feel like a dickhead now
---
The first key feature in the game's Steam description is 
---
**Survive Together... Or Not**
---
"- Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone."
---
Not to mention the several perks that benefit you and you alone.
---
It's only a team game if you make it a team game.
---
meanwhile my responds: "Sorry i don't understand your alien glyphs"
---
I am sorry to everyone,
---
Holy shit. Legion actually had the upper hand all along.
---
Oh my bad, didnt see the time this was posted.
---
Its kk, I wasnt doing anything else lol
---
It‚Äôs fine I could have been clearer. I edited it to make it make more sense
---
His heart is in the right place but he's got the wrong idea.
---
Or just don‚Äôt insult people at all, what‚Äôs the point ?
---
I play on pc
---
dogs would inevitably be killed, i'm against this
---
Sprint burst is becoming more meta because it can be activated anytime, not just situationally like other excavation perks. That is my understanding at least
---
I'm a Laurie main and I never use it cause I always fuck up the skill check. I had better luck with adrenaline/deliverance.
---
Who cares, people complain about balance and bugs but then they want them to fix ratings that mean fuck all.
---
Two yamaokas one dweet
---
No Mither + Iron Will + Unbreakable + Tenacity on Ace for the big brain galaxy plays
---
It's fine as is.
---
Becuase you cant swing whilst cloaked, so its not just 4.6 chase constantly

Finna hop on my switch just to t-bad that pussycat
---
I know how he works. Thanks
---
It‚Äôs not really what they mean. They were referring to targeting. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not against the rules to stream snipe per se, but they can get the person on targeting a specific player and going out of their way to make their games miserable.  For instance, if I have a grudge against JohhnySexKitten and every time he queues up in my lobby I bring a Mori specifically for him and go out of my way to only get him, then it‚Äôs reportable.  It‚Äôs very tough to prove, but technically it‚Äôs against they rules to target a specific player match to match based on who they are.
---
Perfection
---
VIABLE?????!?!??
---
*blows balloons, only thing it does is give away location TO survivors*
---
Nah Ayrun‚Äôs are definitely still worse lol
---
Make the inability not work in the basement I guess
---
I‚Äôve read this twice and it just sounds like you need to learn how to play trapper and be more perceptive to where you place your traps. 
---
If someone is looping you too well then you need to disengage and find a new target.
---
when I do 3 gens entirely by myself, im leaving the gate without looking back. I'm not carrying the team the entire game
---
repairing its booped beak? nea is a vet
---
Legion might not be a great killer but he‚Äôs fun
---
no you just stand behind the survivor. Its counterable if you dont just blindly swing at the hooked survivor
---
Since feral frenzy is getting removed with this I'd just play susie to make them only move at 140% movement speed aftwr hitting them
---
I've been on and off of the game, so what is slugging exactly?
---
Congrats. Hexes are risky business tbh, I run Ruin on a few killers and DH on Pig as she can benefit a lot from it, but other than that I almost never do hexes. Too inconsistent.
---
Claudette and billy
---
I have a question, is it possible to beat someone in this loop as Oni?
---
We were just fucking around and it was actually working, so we stuck with it. It's PS4, so we'd had a long day of shitty connections and tunnelers and it kinda came out.
---
Wait I thought deep wounds doesnt count down when in terror radius?
---
True only bothers me because he spams with uploads. I like how Monto will post maybe one or two videos a day (and they‚Äôre usually at least slightly edited too). True posts like his entire stream in separate parts and it just spams my subscriber feed lol
---
Smh abusing infinites. Entitled survivors these days smh my head
---
Now its freddy and quentin that is redacted on console
---
Yeah, that's why I unsubscribed and not interested on him
---
Or the devs could fix their bugs for once...
---
Because in the next 3 seconds or so after failing a ruin skill check the gen progress won't go up regardless, so it's better to not work on it so you don't get other skill checks.
---
That‚Äôs not Nick Castle in the movie, though.....
---
Is standing up pointing and starting about 3 seconds ? I always assumed that‚Äôs why
---
PC Player Here, name on steam is "stealthy boi". Looking for people to play and chill with in KYF (maybe Practicing/Testing Builds, Mindgames and other Techs, why not?) \[Do Not Be Toxic\] I will play with EVERYONE regardless the Age, the Rank, Hours spent in the game. Just be kind, My nick on discord is "Not TriHarder#7617" but you can call me Dany, feel free to add me! (Time Zone CET / UTC+1)
---
Coco large
---
&gt;I would apologize and refrain from using it, because that's what a sensible human would do.
---
I like how you imply that I would keep saying it around them. I won't stop using words like lame, except around who specifically ask me not to. Just like I won't tell people to stop calling people "gay," or "cocksuckers" (when it's a reference to someone being a shit person, rather than the person actually being homophobic. Like it is in the original comment) because even though I'm gay, I don't give a shit. It's just a word.
---
Yes this plz it‚Äôs fucking painful to play huntress on some maps and 115 would make it somewhat easier.
---
you might have to click the button with 2 arrows on it to open the chat when in the after match screen
---
Actually made me lol. Caught me off guard. Ty op
---
Please, make it stop.
---
For me its just doesnt find lobbys on survivor :(
---
It's Mario Kart and I love it
---
There are perks that could and should be base for survivors and killers in general but instead they're always added as perks, nothing exciting is ever added to the actual gameplay.
---
I love his music. It‚Äôs usually from Donkey Kong Country and Mario games haha
---
You misunderstood. There's a bug right now affecting Trapper where he instantly steps in a trap he has just set. By the time he frees himself, it's active again and so he's stunned again. Repeat x infinity. In other words, it has nothing to do with the player, it's the devs not fixing a gamebreaking bug. But hey, buy an ugly winter jacket for Nea, because priorities.
---
What? I‚Äôm complaining about them not fixing a bug that you can‚Äôt get out of hence endless loop of getting stuck in his trap, there was nothing I could do there.
---
Please, it hurts me
---
It‚Äôs telling your future
---
Dear o dear, we'll probably get a horde of salty 12 year olds to us
---
As someone who just uses the yt homepage instead of my sub feed, I like having a channel that I know will have a ton of backup dbd videos if I‚Äôm ever bored. I can see how the sub feed spam could get very annoying tho lol
---
There ARE bugs like that for survivor... basement blind glitch still happens, you still can't struggle sometimes, and the bug where you couldn't leave lasted for AGES.
---
yes then i instantly jumped into depression
---
Finally, a good opinion for once.
---
yea I guess breakdown is kinda situational, same with calm spirit. doesn‚Äôt make them bad though, they just only work in certain situations and can‚Äôt compete with meta perks
---
You can use it on someone else tho
---
They changed it now it's if the survivor is running it won't go down I think there is another case where it won't go down but I can't remember
---
Because the people who do the graphics and design cosmetics are definitely the same people who program the game.
---
HeT
---
I dunno why people are genuinely upset about this. The good far outweighs the bad.
---
Yes please
---
Unbreakable is great on No Mither because the killer doesn't expect you to get up that fast. And Adrenaline picks you up immediately plus 5 second sprint burst. Not really sure why you think those are particularly bad combos
---
This
---
We don‚Äôt need a bunch of 8 year olds on our game
---
Nah, tru3's are definitely worse. That and the 20 uploads a day
---
Idk, i know a 360 is enough for progress to resume lol. People still doing it because of the meme factor more likely.
---
Then make it part of a new killers power.
---
This happened to me, a survivor came along and saved me somehow.
---
Its balanced and even a little weak at times. What are they even on about?
---
Because it's easier for them to delete something than to fix bugs related to that.
---
We need more then a revolution, we need a crusade.
---
Yeah sorry I meant to send that to the guy you replied to lmao
---
Imagine teaching someone dbd when you can't read shit on the screen telling you how the game works.
---
If I do it, it's not for efficiency, it's to try and keep things suspensful for a bit longer than they normally would.
---
Lol
---
Ya, would be interesting to know what power she have and I hope her design will be creepy like Hag.
---
Again, bad game design. How many times do I have to repeat this? Imagine being so dumb you can't see past that. You even said it. It's basically mandatory. If you *have* to run something then your game is not balanced.
---
This bug is annoying af since you have to have a survivor save you from your own traps but trying to say there aren't game breaking bugs for survivors shows how biased OP is.
---
Because his style of content creation is wayyy different. Don‚Äôt sub if you don‚Äôt wanna see all the uploads, but I would rather see 10 videos with less work on a thumbnail than 1 video against rank 14 killers lol
---
You must have been fed lucky charms as a child because there's no way someone as dumb as you wouldn't have accidentally killed yourself yet.
---
That's great!
---
My go to is rat, or horrendous
---
I didn‚Äôt say there wasn‚Äôt game breaking bugs for survivor, I said that the devs prioritize any other killer or survivor bug that exists at the moment over trapper
---
That's just your opinion though
---
"I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TUNNELED ME JUST BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY SURVIVOR IN YOUR EYELINE AND THE OTHERS WERE TRYING TO BODY BLOCK YOU! BABY KILLER EZ!!!!! TO SAY NOTHING OF 'TUNNELING' NOT EVEN BEING PENALIZED IN-GAME THE WAY FACECAMPING IS SO IT'S REALLY MORE ABOUT STRATEGY THAN TROLLING!!!!"
---
I WILL TANK MY OWN SCORE JUST TO ENSURE YOU'RE HAVING A SHITTY TIME!
---
Would be cool to have some kind of unranked queue for playing with players from whatever platform. 
---
However I have to wonder if it would hurt ranked queues across all platforms due to players leaving for the unranked multi-platform queue. Seperating players isn't always the best thing. Who knows though.
---
Pretty much all CIS countries as well, such as Ukraine and Belarus. 
---
It‚Äôs not actually the same thing, people out there use both. It‚Äôs more of saying something with a little grin/smirk on your face rather than actually smiling.
---
 It mostly affects the intonation, the way you‚Äôre supposed to read this, so ‚ÄúHello‚Äù is just a common greeting, while ‚ÄúHello)‚Äù is the way of telling through typing that you‚Äôre saying the same thing a little bit more gainly, while ‚ÄúHello :)‚Äù is more of actually smiling after saying this.
---
Why does pretty much the whole world lacks this way of conveying your intonation? I‚Äôve got no idea.
---
Oh god
---
the game's already got an iffy playerbase
---
Clown main here, is he simple...yes yes he is but he's not as simple as "throw bottle at your feet and repeat". You can actually do a lot of things with his bottles such as aiming up at trees to get a bigger gas cloud, pseudo tracking by throwing one at a generator, and sniping someone going for a hooksave to prevent them from getting it to name a few. He's still simple and not a great killer due to having very little pressure outside of the chase, but he's still got a few tricks he can do
---
TRUE, WHEN I CAME BACK AFTER HIATUS AND HAD TO CLAW BACK UP FROM 20 AS A KILLER, I SAW A LOT MORE HIGH-RANKED SURVIVORS! IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY FRUSTRATING IF I DIDN'T HAVE A STRONG BASELINE LEARNED SKILL TO FALL BACK ON!!!
---
sorry, boring, just collection of cliches
---
She's a bit thiccer than she normally is, but otherwise it's great
---
What do you think of it?
---
No why does ranked matter to you anyway? I reached rank 1 so many times so what no one takes it seriously. Its a fun game so it shouldnt be that deep oh advantage sod off
---
I like it
---
u/heyimhungry_
---
Disconnecting against the ‚Äúmost balanced killer?‚Äù Imagine that
---
It happened to me earlier. I wasn't sure exactly where it was but I had a good idea because I'd heard the sound so I was carrying an Elf Dwight in that direction and he started wiggling. I felt like I'd just been slapped in the face. How. Dare. You. Wiggle.
---
Wait so now we have to heal to get the perk activated??
---
You literally said if there was any survivor bug that hindered for them a patch would be submitted asap. The sloppy butcher wraith bug which caused blood to continously shoot out and get stacked to the point it'd crash your game took forever for them to fix, the previous person also mentioned a few bugs. Not being able to leave the game through the gates or even see your own character after being hooked in the basement hinders gameplay believe it or not.
---
They are still brought in closer
---
Are people going to ask for a rework of billy now?
---
But how can you signal everything that exists on the map without having known it exist? Perhaps EVERY thing you've encountered so far gets illuminated to everyone!!
---
I don‚Äôt understand. Please explain why he made people miserable. I have only 10 hours in the game and never played against Legion, sorry.
---
A better change would be *auto uses deliverance when you're on stuggle or death hook*
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry little one‚Äù
---
You don't take ranked serious so the entire ranked system should be compromised by cross platforms unfair advatanges because you desire it?
---
Ok, nevermind I thought this was a discussion.
---
"Fortnite man bad, Give me upvotes"
---
nope. This is just a concept
---
Yes, if the timer runs out, you die, it doesn't matter if you're on the last box, you will die without finishing the box
---
it would be cool yeah, but if they make it like that killers should not lose points if they are camping survivors
---
No many people dont care about ranked and this advantage your on isnt even that deep its so minor. Just have it as an option similar to windows and steam atm. Im sure there isnt a problem there so people like me who dont mind because we play for fun can use it.
---
Honestly okay with this, it‚Äôs good for growth and even though it‚Äôll be a phase for a lot of watchers a few will stick around.
---
Why are people in the comments downvoting actual smart killers?
---
my dumb ass is so bad at timing i just switched to sprint burst :&lt; üò≠
---
Well he doesn‚Äôt anymore. But Before his ‚Äúrework‚Äù (which was really just 21 nerfs trying to sneak into an R-Rated game) he could down no matter what. There was no counterplay because he was fast, he could swing without cooldown, and he could vault pallets and windows. Meaning survivors had no escape from him. 
---
He was garbage because his power took 4 stabs to down. BUT he could start his power gauge at 15% so good legions could do this really quickly. This was an unavoidable down where your skill meant nothing against the legion. Thus, nobody cared to play against him because the chase would end when the power of the legion decided, and not when you made a mistake. He was garbage, but he was uncounterable.
---
Dogs would be better for a new killer than survivor.
---
I guess no one can give you more or less decent answer regarding these brackets. It's just something that we're used to and this habit dates back to early 2010s if not earlier
---
Oh god, that would have been awful
---
leaving someone to lay on the ground in the dying state like a slug.
---
BK Meyers found his match.
---
Ah, I get it now. Thanks for the clarification!
---
Yo.
---
Happy üç∞Day.
---
Ah yes, your fourth deadhard meme.
---
the thigh gap is a bit big
---
About to be FUBAR
---
So. Fast but weak stabby. Got it.
---
Just every match is different, depending on perks used, killer used, it‚Äôs not for everyone
---
Come on, Jeff isn't THAT scary, right?
---
Yeah but this might introduce an even more toxic fan base to dbd (also 8 y/os)
---
Blah blah you don't comprehend shit the advantage isn't minor between a controller and keyboard/mouse 
---
Why you think gears of war, call of duty, halo , whatever game you can think of doesn't cross platform console to pc? Its a bad idea and is only good for YOU because your friend wants to play with you.
---
But of course, Vsauce is Dwight.
---
#fuckninja
---
but that's the point of the "ignores anyone else" bit.
---
hard facecamping on first hook is doing exactly that
---
Bloodlust gamer \o/
---
Well, that was a bad idea and the Oni is mediocre now
---
The game's current AFK detection is terrible. I was playing "hide-and-immersed" with some friends in SWF once and I discovered how absolutely godawful the AFK detection was. You can literally just spin around in a circle and crows won't spawn it's a complete joke.
---
Its not very fun to play
---
I watched one of the videos to see how bad it was, it was pretty hard to watch. 
---
But I still think it will ultimately a good thing if the game increases in popularity.
---
I guess you won't be able to find a person who cannot see that this is russian.
---
I kinda understand that guy. When you are 11 rank killer and you get against those juicy 2-5 ranks :/
---
I don't have the Tweet but there was a great post someone made where they showed all the bullshit hits that people get on DS, with the caption of "I'd prefer to get killed once in a blue moon to a lag switching Killer who's mad I broke his hooks than experience this every game."
---
Yes, be better at prediction and actually use speed fury to close the gap.
---
It can't get worse imo
---
It only pauses when sprinting or mending
---
Something about the perk Nemesis, blah blah blah, made old Legion come back, blah blah, they needed to change one Killer's entire power &amp; add-ons just to accommodate a new Killer's perk...
---
Ridiculous.
---
Because a bunch of 20-something-year olds who tell people to kill themselves, which we currently have, is much better.
---
Xbox: 
---
Sanctum of Wrath still has the Basement glitch.
---
Yea but the people who hate him are gonna start hating this game and also all the people who watch his videos are like 8
---
Noted
---
I love how some aaron wannabes try this on me and cry about camping when i just stand there waiting for them to move :D
---
‚ÄúBaiting Freddy Krueger‚Äù *Pig in thumbnail*
---
Thank
---
That‚Äôs the goal
---
Lol u have a point
---
This is my jam
---
A buff to an already strong and annoying perk? Nah, thanks, I don't want seeing more Deliverance &amp; DS &amp; Unbreakable &amp; Adrenaline shitbags who play stealthy the whole game and get carried to the exit by op combination of perks
---
The fact that you think trapper is the only character the devs don't "prioritize" fixes for is hilarious. Stop making a fool of yourself.
---
It‚Äôs more than a slight edge. The developers are constantly pushing out updates to tweak gameplay to balance the game. It would be counter intuitive to bring in something that would imbalance it. I get you want to play with your friend but it‚Äôs not as simple as putting in a button to have crossplay active. There is much more that goes into it and this would be game breaking with the current state of the game.
---
i'd like to hear this as well, i didnt play when he launched, but i do know that at launch he could stab you repeatedly while in feral frenzy, and iirc each attack would reduce the timer on deep wound but i'm not 100% certain on that one, but it seemed like he could just glue himself to you until you went down and there was no getting away from it.
---
I just don‚Äôt want him to ruin our game
---
It takes forever because too many people want to play killer and not enough want to play survivor. I hear it gets better at higher ranks cause more people are around rank 10
---
Ghost face is licensed, BHVR can‚Äôt do this.
---
No sensing, only saw.
---
Looks like a lagswitch if you ask me, fucking hate em
---
But have you actually tried it?
---
Seeing billy and running in the only place on the map where you cannot dodge his saw? Something's got to be wrong with the killer, not the survivor being bad
---
Then you're a sadist and it's good you are taking care of those urges in video games and not real life... i guess
---
Actually the mask and name are licensed, not the actual body cosmetic.
---
Well there goes the awesome club's test to determine whether or not you're an OG survivor. G fucking g.

All I need is borrowed on my david and I'll be the savior man
---
that is part of the description I believe
---
On ps4 i find killer games in 2 min and survivor in 15
---
I get that, That's one reason i like him, i don't get to catch his streams so i love having a constant supply of videos to binge.
---
Yes came here to agree. I play flashy beautiful stylish Jake and his position couldn't be any better. I can mostly hold my own but sometimes I derp and die hard. And the "no bullshit" rating is true, I don't fuck around unless killer is actually being a loser I'll kinda play along. But only if it's absolutely necessary. Gotta play fair.
---
Pretty sure those most of those dudes are 12, too. So actually, worse.
---
"ruin" All he is doing is playing it, sure a lot of young people are going to join the game, but is that really anything new? 
---
Ochido and no0b3 already had a shit ton of toxic babys following them.
---
we already have a shit ton of toxicity, instead of complaining about someone joining the game, why dont we actually realize the reason why he is being somewhat toxic is bc he plays with Hexy.
---
It‚Äôs still is ghostface
---
I feel your pain brother
---
It's you again! But l√©ry's is better for Michael and to better hide my ruin totem you keep cleansing
---
Yup, one person even let their teammate die on first hook because they really wanted to hook tech
---
Lol this happened to me 2 days ago.  I was setting traps all in the one room so they'd see I wasn't seriously playing and just wanted to wrap up my Trapper challenge and when I went to put the last one down somehow it teleported the one I set about 6 feet next to it directly next to my body as I set this one. It began the infinity trap loop.  Other survivors caught on and did nothing to even attempt to help me out of it (sometimes a weapon hit can break glitches in game).  They just pointed and stared and disarmed the traps so I quit the game because dude i can't play and you aren't even trying to help break the exploit.
---
It rather should be:
---
- Me using Dead Hard
---
- Me geting hit
---
- Me blaming lag and telling killer that was lagswitch
---
No, people who see him playing that game will think it sucks because he is playing
---
Wake Up is a good perk, if niche; Pharmacy is mediocre, and Vigil sucks.
---
He fits.
---
Laughs in Dwight and Nea

ty, didn't even notice that lol. im still trying to improve, ty for pointing out some blatent mistakes i didn't notice &lt;3
---
This is why you should do research before you purchase something.
---
When i don't run ds i get tunneled, when i do, i barely get any use out of it
---
That's the thing about DBD, you're allowed to play how you want to play.
---
Looping is bannable rip guess I should have a life ban
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
NOT bannable
---
Well Oni's easy to beat if you know what you're doing
---
Finally someone gets it! Thank you
---
All I got to say is ***menacing***
---
I have never come across it before. I was so confused.
---
Inefficient but fun
---
How you feel about it belongs to you and I happen to feel differently.
---
When I was a child, people threw the word gay like an insult. I didn't know what being gay meant, all I knew is that it must have been something bad and shameful. That's a connotation I wish for future generations not to have anymore. If we don't actively work on it, it will never change.  
---
Racial slurs are pretty much universally frowned upon now and that's a good thing. I'm sure a lot of people said "it's just a word" but it's more than that. It's about the implications of institutionalized hatred and discrimination behind them.
---
I know it's a silly internet argument with strangers and in the end, it won't change the world and it might not even change anyone's opinion. Still, I felt like it's worth talking about.
---
On ps4 is short at night but daytime is a long wait.
---
It says ‚Äúthe following are not considered bannable offenses‚Äù
---
No fat no sauce
---
Idk. They dont like that they get an aura reading every time they hook a survivor. One friend runs distortion specifically because of it.
---
I use them just to make survs play cautious

I just like the drama of it. Lol
---
All im saying is adding it as an option. If those of us that want to use it we can. If you dont because your worried a huntress might hatchet flick a little easier or mouse sensitivity might help the killer a little with your 360s fine dont play with it.
---
Have all 4 on the map and you can teleport between lockers, each time you teleport you're a different one.
---
It's the best when you stand on the middle of the hatch and they're trying to enter and you're like 
---
*Looks at watch*
---
You done?
---
*They back up slightly*
---
*Closes the hatch*
---
I like it, but it just looks like an anime character resembling spirit. Try for something a little scarier and detailed.
---
Mate I said add an option. Many people want crossplay hence the survey was done. So let us have the option to use it and pussys like you who are scared of an advantage in sensitivity or frames in a COOP fun game can stick to what your doing now. HOW is that wrong it wont effect you its an option.
---
What constitutes a killer win? Survivors is quite clear but for killers people flop between what is a "win" to them.
---
It is always ridiculously funny wherever you interrupt a survivor doing something.
---
##The Legion
---
###Primary Weapon: Knife
---
###Power: We are One
---
The Legion can see all lockers within **56 meters** by **holding down the Power button**. While hovering their reticle over a highlighted locker, they can send another Legion member to it by **tapping the Attack button**. Up to **3** lockers can be occupied at a time. With the Power button held, The Legion can switch to a different member by **holding down the Attack button** while hovering their reticle over an **occupied locker**. Upon switching characters, the previous Killer uses a smoke bomb to cover their tracks. The Legion must wait **30 seconds** before being able to change characters again.
---
If a Survivor comes within **3 meters** of a locker containing a Legion member:
---
- They're attacked, putting them into the Injured state.
---
- They're afflicted with the **Deep Wound** status effect.
---
- Their location is revealed to the **active Killer**.
---
- The Legion member who attacked them drops a smoke bomb, and vanishes.
---
- The Legion member cannot be sent to a locker again for **30 seconds**.
---
A Survivor can ensure a locker is safe by standing within **6 meters** of it, and listening for breathing that occurs every **7 seconds** when a locker is occupied by The Legion.
---
###Power: Feral Frenzy
---
The Legion has a **power gauge** that builds up over time. Once the gauge is full, Feral Frenzy can be activated by **tapping the Actions button**, causing the power gauge to drain over **12 seconds**.
---
While Feral Frenzy is **active:**
---
- The Legion is granted a **10%** speed boost.
---
- The Legion can't put Survivors into the Dying state.
---
- The Legion can quickly vault over obstacles and pallets.
---
Striking a Survivor while Feral Frenzy is active applies the **Mangled** status effect. Striking the same Survivor twice, or not landing a hit on any Survivors results in an **extended recovery cooldown**, and ends the power. Feral Frenzy can be activated every **20 seconds**. *The extended recovery cooldown does NOT trigger upon missed attacks.*
---
###Perks
---
*Perks remain the same, except Iron Maiden becomes a base perk, and Hex: Anarchy is added to The Legion's kit.*
---
**Hex: Anarchy**
---
You have cursed Survivors with a totem that punishes their lack of cooperation. If only one Survivor is repairing a generator or healing another Survivor, their progress is slowed by **20/30/40%**. This effect is disabled if the Hex: Anarchy totem is cleansed.
---
Check out perksbydaylight subreddit. These monkeys will be trolling you for days
---
You keep saying that she‚Äôs supposed to hit people from range, but no speed boost or charge change  would solve that if there‚Äôs still things in the way. Every single map is randomly generated, I don‚Äôt see why there couldn‚Äôt be addons to change something. Why not addons to increase move speed while holding a hatchet? Changing base stats will just make people complain more about being hit by ghost hatchets
---
I don't understand how would whispers 2 be better than tire 3
---
Is that flair an erb reference?
---
That's not really true though. It increases clicks for sure but its not a requirement
---
Same. Rip old Freddy
---
Pretty sure he's talking about your concept of needing to heal a survivor in addition to unhooking
---
Th-.... the shag....
---
Either or, really. You can consider pipping a win or killing 3-4 people. Neither will happen if survivors play perfectly, even if you do the same.
---
If everything is OP, then nothing is
---
Ps4
---
Loading into my first game as the nightmare the map name stayed on screen the entire game preventing the hud from appearing.
---
Haha, this is tremendous!
---
I never heard of or watched this guy and made the mistake of watching one video... wow. Just... wow. They are yelling at each other like they are playing CoD. It's... bad.
---
Same from her description from the lore and from the devs. The next killers power is anti loop and a simple one aswell and from her lore she seems to have a lure aspect to her. So maybe her power is she can lure survivors to her.
---
Fuck anyone doing that "new hook tech". Basically a license for killer to facecamp.
---
Yesterday I took down 3 survivors, had one left and decided to let them go. It was a rare breed of claudette that didn't try to use incredibly dark skin to blend in but also wasn't like the bright neas and fengs that try to annoy me or expose their teammates, sorry to the fengs and neas that aren't like that. Me being a dumbass had decided to do this after closing the hatch, and tryed carrying her to gates She wiggled out the first time and I panicked and tryed to get her down, then bring her back to the gate, where she got it open and unfortunately got grabbed by the entity at the spot where most survivors stand so your forced to hit them to make them crawl away.
---
That explains things. I'm stupid.
---
&gt; it‚Äôs boring as hell competitively
---
This isn't a competitive game. Not by a long shot, way too much RNG involved.
---
Oh no...
---
Brother Cope had a creative way to deal with it as Plague. Just spam puke on the person until they get Broken.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about them according to low ranks playing killer is banable.
---
**checkmate**
---
*Looks at the Overwatch Community* Riiiight....
---
[Here you go](https://ibb.co/DCvtsH0)
---
&gt;5 gens
---
wtf were you guys doing lol
---
Guess you need a big sign "SARCASM" to understand it?
---
Camping is such a shitty thing to do. Outside of times where it makes sense (endgame collapse) it's probably the worse thing you can do. The second everyone realises you're camping the hooked guy they're just going to do gens. At that point you're not camping to win, you're camping solely to be an asshole and ruin someone's game. It genuinely baffles me how you have the power to create a fun and memorable match for both sides but just choose not to in favour of being a dick. God knows why the devs don't do anything about it.
---
Did he respond?
---
it was a joke
---
If you‚Äôre using whispers 3 with the pig and crouch when it goes off, the survivors will hear your heartbeat for a slight second. With whispers 2 you can crouch when it goes off and the survivors won‚Äôt hear you.
---
FORGOT ABOUT ACE.
---
Hey, ^they were being sarcastic
---
It's gunna be OK kid, show us on the doll where this game touched you
---
Nothing negative about it, just said it confused me. Damn this sub is defensive
---
No, killers who either pick you up and activate DS or dont and you activate unbreakable
---
I respect your opinion but I don't think this is such a huge buff, I don't see how the 4% of not getting the Broken Effect can be a problem, healing a survivor is something that also "Second Wind" does and I personally don't think this is a top tier perk, stealthy playstyle is an option too.
---
*laughs in old Billy flick*
---
Didn‚Äôt ask lmao
---
Usually my policy is if they wiggle they die
---
Plague to break them, Bubba just rev the saw, Myers 99 his stalk, Huntress with double haft add ons to double tap. For some killers it's an absolute win
---
Wraith insidious
---
Yes ‚Äúadding it as a option‚Äù is not as easy as you are making it out to be. 
---
This will be my last response here because your posting a thread asking for crossplay but you aren‚Äôt even acknowledging anyones legitimate counter points... The developers aren‚Äôt going to go out of their way to implement something that would cause such an imbalance, plain &amp; simple.
---
It isn‚Äôt healthy to get angry and break controllers over a game

Hiding in lockers or behind a gen counters it though..

That's the joke I didn't destroy anything, well over than toxic SWFs

Doing gens, you? /s

Honestly though, we were just being stupid for the first 5 minutes.

What is a boomer, I don‚Äôt get these new kids words.

:\*
---
In all honesty, I would rather prefer the appearance the mask has in the newest Halloween along with its sequel, or the appearance Michael has in rob zombies remake.
---
I love doing that, also when I play bubba and they enter the locker to not get one shot and then they exit the locker when I've rammed into it as if walking into a raging bubba can't one shot them still
---
He clearly doesnt get how to use the insult of "ok boomer" so jokes on him.
---
people born between 1946 and 1964
---
"Let me have it!"
---
it's just a meme at this point
---
Take a seat right over here
---
ok? what exactly does it change then? are people scared of people joining the game or people NOT joining the game?
---
yeah and if they are 19 they should've known I was doing it for the meme lol
---
It's always been bad, just now is beyond useless.
---
I used competitive as a euphemism. This could‚Äôve also meant the people who take dbd very serious or even the people who are just really good at the game.
---
This was my main game I reach devotion seven and stop playing killer to become a survivor main who but my opinions doesnt change swf are bullshit and need to be deleted and in the last two months I star to hate the people who use self care
---
We don‚Äôt want the wrong people to join
---
I wear that head 24/7 and sometimes I get a camped for being "toxic". Toxic is flash spamming t-baging.not pallet looping,flashlight saving,and wearing cosmetics. people who say flashlight saving is "toxic" ya see there's this thing it's called KEEPING YOUR TEAM ALIVE.
---
i need this.
---
i need this now.
---
*laughs in butter billy*
---
Nope lol
---
Everything has its situation tho. The better perks just come into play more and have a bigger effect
---
And yes, I depipped
---
idk then, maybe check your privacy settings on Steam and your settings in DBD
---
I'm saving up iri shards to buy the Susie sweater even though I don't play a ton of legion, cause it's just that great
---
ReDdIt HeRe I cOmE
---
depending on what u choose, killer or survivor, the game is different, every match is different, from map, spawns, characters, and there is also a lot of playstyles; as killer u can be stealthy, agressive, strategic, depending on the killer and build, as survivor u can be a gen jockey, a healer, a savior, a looper, just for mentioning some of them
---
how are the other 2 pairs ironic? You still get picked up and the speed boost with Adrenaline, and you still get the faster recovery with Unbreakable. It isn't "bad", at least on the level of self-care, to run either of those perks with No Mither.
---
Dwight has the best cosmetics in my opinion and Trapper just feels really strong to me. Being able to force a survivor away from a loop is just helpful .
---
We all know lol idk I guess they just want the killer to have to find the next survivor completely blind again like when the game starts out.
---
Can‚Äôt agree harder. Why does anyone think this is witty or worth upvoting?
---
You must be one of the DC's :)
---
Must say, you nailed my cosmetic Kate my dude, haha
---
Not on pc
---
Dude, are you a child because you sure are acting like one? Are you not able to have a discussion without name calling for not agreeing with your opinion? Your not even acknowledging the issues in your crossplay option but instead calling someone a pussy who doesn‚Äôt want to conform to your idea
---
Have you thought about doing some studies on anatomy or fabric? You've got a great subject and you can clearly finish a piece, so I think a good next step would be to challenge yourself with a few studies on how to proportion a body, how the body curves, and how to draw out ruffles
---
I bet a year from now you will be able to redraw this piece and surprise yourself with your development if you take just an hour or so every once in a while to study a new technique :)
---
If I was that Susie I would cry.
---
Have you ever played with no hud as a survivor? Man it sucks ass, you don‚Äôt get skill checks or anything. You just get the notification of a skill check and have to guess when to hit it.
---
Mad respect red rank wraith on console
---
Yeah, and on some killers it can be better to get 1 or 2 survivors injured rather than hooking the one that‚Äôs downed- you then have 3 targets wasting time healing or down to one shot.
---
What's so bad about that ?
---
Legion used to damage the deep wound timer whwn getting a second frenzy hit, and the timer only paused in chases. So you could look away from a survivor and follow their blood trail, moonwalking behind them and forcing a down no matter what. If they stopped to mend, you could hit them. If they kept running, they would be downed anyway.
---
Don't worry she killed all my friends at the end. She was a good sport afterwards.
---
It's a cool idea that is not good. Survivors could be in 4 different locations and none of them capable of getting on a gen.
---
Ed, Edd, and Ead by Daylight
---
I like how you marked your own name out even though it‚Äôs you reddit name as well
---
Are there maps/objects that do this? Almost everything has a hitbox about above the actual physical thing. Except Generators which for some reason suck your hitbox into theirs.
---
I had a killer disconnect when someone threw the very first pallet early instead of doing one more loop.  He said he was disconnecting because we were clearly bad and he only likes playing when survivors will try to mind game him.  I took that to mean that he‚Äôs bad and as soon as he knows a survivor won‚Äôt let him get a free hit he disconnects.  He was running the super meta Nurses Calling + Sloppy Butcher Wraith build, btw.
---
I had a very similar idea with the exception of the killer being Terminator! It would be really cool to see a shape shifting killer. Love your idea!
---
I feel like they should definitely take advantage of the fact that there are four of them. 
---
I dunno what would be balanced but, honestly Legion is my only prestige Killer as they're my mains.
---
And I wonder why honestly
---
I'll upvote to equal out against survivor mains being salty they can't use their perk
---
Wraith , sloppy , thana , ruin , nurses . Thank me later ;)
---
ty :D
---
I will definetly look more into that. Ty for actually giving advice instead of just saying it sucks and to fuck off lol
---
I think the problem is there is a slight desync between the model and character location so it looks like it missed buy the game thinks your hitbox is in fact there
---
Ik, plus flashlight saving does require some timing. It is definetly annoying as killer, but its a game feature, and you can just look at a wall or bait and scare off the saver. I mainly use the cosmetic cause it looks comfy
---
Not true at all regarding the first part. I play in red ranks and constantly get camped.
---
Brought to you by the people behind such grand titles such as: Phineas and Ferb: Quest for Cool Stuff and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked.

---
My cat doesn't exist :(
---
On PS4 it's even worse. 90% of the Survivor playerbase are actually stupid as all hell. It's basically impossible to survivor there, even IF you're good, because your team isn't.
---
Can't wait til RE Resistance releases. Will hopefully forever be done
---
I'm not disagreeing. I'm saying that yes the only killer in the entire game who can cross the map and have a survivor instadowned in \*watches video\* ***12 seconds*** is without a doubt, the most balanced killer. This is the level all other killers need to be at. Only then will DBD truly be balanced.
---
OMG YOU DO THE DETROIT BECOME HUMAN COMICS I LIKE TOO!
---
Oh my God, you are my favorite, I'm fan hurling super hard right now
---
That looks a lot like a Vanoss thumbnail
---
Perhaps instead of ruin, I would personally run corrupt intervention, some people are mighty good at great skill checks.
---
No what I think reformed peridot meant was that he essentially is like shrek, showing no mercy to those that invades his land and demands to know what they are doing in his domain, except instead of the swamps outside of happily ever after, it's the lockers that the entity places around the map. Therefore when he opens a locker and finds someone else inside it, he begins to pull them out and vigorously wails on them, till they are gone to the big locker in the sky.

The real crime here is calling Sprint Burst OP in current year

Fuck legion tbh

Fuck I forgot this episode of Ben ten. That was a good show man.

You could do Dying Light instead of PWYF if you wanted to slow gens even more than with just Ruin and Thanatophobia.

This actually isn't true. I was streaming at the time and I just double checked my footage, I did 2 on left hook and 2 on front hook. I *did* have to repeat it before though. I'm not 100% sure why, but I *think* it may have been because I started the EGC by closing the hatch before the last sacrifice. I made sure not to do that the second time and I got it.

Nice! Keep drawing. It takes bravery to show off your work; just remember to be patient with yourself when you see all the flaws. Most of them are bigger in your head anyway ;)

*LETS GIVE SURVIVORS PALLETS BACK EACH GEN AND MAKE THE DOORS AUTO OPEN*
---
Exactly lol sometimes obvious jokes are just to obvious
---
Deadass, I love him for the in game music. It speaks to me.
---
On top of how when someone thinks I don‚Äôt see them, I walk a bit past them, pop frenzy and scare the shit out of them. 
---
Reminds me of the good ol days on Evolve
---
it's funny until it happens to you I guess haha. I'm always dissapointed when someone does it to me, but I chuckle
---
David and Jake
---
DS? balanced?
---
I'm really trying to wrap my head around this logic here lol. So, they dont think its OP smd broken, but rather its unfair(?) because it gives the killer a counterable advantage like perks are supposed to do?
---
I played against a clown with my friend... he camped the crap out of everyone, one of the other survivors died on their FIRST hook... the clown was rank 20, no perks. My friend killed themself for me to go for the hatch. To bad that NS doesn't have a aftergame chat...
---
Yes, have you not slugged?
---
Yeah, I run that and recommended it to him, but hes got one perk atm because he didnt get any BP for dying so fast. I might try and farm a few matches before we play again to get some party streamers and help him
---
I read all of this and hate/love dbd.  I completely agree about fuck survivors/killers.  As killer I hated playing anything past rank 12 and now I'm picking off red ranks like fleas with trapper and and spirit.  As survivor all I do is juke and bamf to the other side while the killer is left holding their dick.  The game is shit and its fundamentally broken and you'll usually find someone better than you and those games are the ones that stand out and sting the most because FUCK.  So, yeah.
---
TL;DL: Doesn't matter go shoo.
---
So dying light and monitor instead of pwf and nemesis?
---
Still kinda the same basic concept of gameplay tho
---
Neas are usually just bad Noob3 wannabes. Dweards are the guys you gotta watch out for
---
I see, i get what you mean. Bad choice of word though as it already has a set meaning in gaming world :P
---
Who's hexy?
---
You could do Monitor, but I think you're right with Nemesis if they don't cleanse. If they do cleanse, probably M &amp; A. I'm not a red rank though lol.
---
A minute of invincibility really isn't reasonable. You can slug and not find anyone else, giving up pressure. Or the survivor can just say fuck you and jump in a locker.
---
[Download link](http://www.mediafire.com/view/asen27fiegaea0b/KK_charSelect_portrait.png) for the character portrait.  
---
Also a heads up to you guys: I will probably not make a lot of comics anymore in the near future, I'm so sorry to the people who liked them!  
---
I tried to finish the archives before the rift closes, but now I kinda burned myself out from playing the game too much.   
---
I'll still do these little illustrations and maybe a few of the comic ideas I still have, but I won't be playing a lot the coming weeks (maybe months?) so eventually the stories run out
---
I have literally never had a survivor go easy on me the way they expect from killers
---
Its a messed up as the game itself
---
tutorials give a nice amount of bp, maybe he could start with that
---
Legion is my favorite. No one else feels as good to me as Susie. GOTTA GO FAST.
---
u kinda didnt read the part i say that the gameplay changes depending on all those factors but ok
---
Almost all of the decent streamers have been extremely repetitive lately, this is just another one.  Between Tru's obsession with Ghostface and constant whining, and Monto's incessant shrieking in every video, it's just not worth watching anyone lately.
---
Otz is fine but ya'll need to climb off his dick, it's reaching Keanu levels of creepy.
---
holy shit i forgot all about the tutorials. thanks dude, i am a bad friend lol
---
I mean, increased bp isn't that bad
---
lmao np
---
Its not invincibility survivors may act like it they are and using it will reduce your pressure because its true. Slug em and you continue pressure, someone has to pick em up, someone else is being chased, leaving one person on a gen. Not to mention when you play survivor and go against a killer that wants to tunnel it gives you a second chance. Unbreakable is still a thing but its def not as common as DS. Cocky survivors with DS "invincibility" is just an easy way to 4k by slug.
---
It‚Äôs just a word.
---
Well if you're on PC then I can lend a hand if you need it for future rifts
---
Not enough red rank killers. Because we all get shit on by red rank swfs and have no way forward besides using asshole gameplay.
---
https://twitter.com/BunBoiArts 
---
I tweet sometimes.
---
So nerf for nemesis interaction or what I don't play that often but I'm curious what is this about
---
If you time it right, the survivors will never hear your heartbeat with whispers 3
---
I mean, if it brings more people to the game then great! Also, the comments about toxicity getting worse.... have you seen this community? Lol it's already toxic as fuuuuck. Also, 8 year olds won't matter when there isn't game chat and just ignore their party invites in you're on console.
---
Oh maybe thats it , same first time i closed the hatch and it didnt worked
---
Idk when but matchmaking changed to where u get paired with ppl six ranks within ur own thus getting rank 4‚Äôs and 3‚Äôs as a rank 10 is now possible. As for why its like this i really dont know my guess would be to shorten queue times. I personally hate this its one of the worst things implemented imo esp in conjunction with the new rank reset system. Ranks atm basically do not matter at all, not one bit. they need to rework ranking all together imo.
---
It's not "punishing" anybody for playing with their friends. It's punishing people who use voice comms, and not really even then, since voice comms gives several perks' worth of information and then some without taking up a single perk slot.
---
i made a smurf account specifically for helping new friends, but with matchmaking/queues the way they are i'm not sure how much difference it makes.
---
honestly all i can think is employing the most annoying tactics you can think of (t-bagging, flashlight clicking, etc.) or try and convince some killers to farm so he can  get some bp and time with the mechanics. i've seen some people say they've messaged killers to tell them their friend is new and ask for help teaching them the ropes, but idk how viable that is really.
---
Otzdarva made a great video with Hag/Myers...it‚Äôs scary
---
Tunneling takes a survivor out of the game faster than being kind and hooking survivors 1 by 1. It's an incredibly efficient strategy. It's nice not to tunnel, but it's kind of ridiculous survivors have built up this community mindset that the killer's strategy is toxic and you're a bad killer if you do it.
---
Haha, no.
---
We can nerf Ruin when genrush gets nerfed. How's that? :)
---
With W3 and M&amp;A ur terror radius is 24 metres and you will know a survivor is near within 32 meters (this has to do with starting to crouch to get an hit while someone is doing an gen). With only whispers 2 ur tr is 32 metres and you will know when to crouch at 40 metres. You will have to walk 8 meters more (8 metres really isnt that much tbh) at an decreased 21,7% but you will have one more perk to work with
---
In my opinion legion is a relaxing killer to play.
---
My idea is to have an option. Not saying has to be immediate fix your servers and apply it. Pussy players out.
---
Okay for real I think the changing in lockers and shit I've been reading is nice but hear me out on this one. What if they were able to set booby traps or pranks on the survivor. At the end of the day they are just teenagers so what if they could booby trap things like windows and chests and what not. When a survivor interacts with it they'd get scared revealing their location and maybe possibly injured but not downed. As for pallets maybe they can have an ultra rare were the legion uses the pallet against the survivor to stun them? These are all ideas of course but I would love to see legion get some love in the end.
---

"Genrush" is literally just playing the game. Ruin is a perk that shitty killers use because they can't do their job.

What about people who don't have mic but still play with friends? They're affected by this aswell. Believe it or not, not everyone can afford a mic.
---
Just make a new steam you can steam share on any account as many times as you want sure you lose your perks but it lets your new friend play vs new killers
---
I've gotten to the point where I'm learning what exactly I'm doing wrong and where I messed up. I agree that it seems like you lose a lot on both sides, but I chalk that that up as me being a dumbass at both sides of the game. xD

Is this true? It never used to be like that on Freddy release
---
Illinois
---
You really think the "Speed Boost when sleeping someone" addons were his best? I find all they really did was negate the "Speed Penalty" you get for like a second when you first slept someone. I think those were the worst OG Freddy addons.
---
My favorite OG Freddy addons were the dresses for less skill check chance, range (stacked you could sleep people across the map) addons.
---
Red Paint Brush + Z-block with monitor and abuse for 3 second sleep transition and 0 TR in dream world. I'd run that on Lery's for hilarity. 
---
I think OG Freddy's BEST addon though was definitely Class Photo (Wallhacks on everybody during sleep transition) since it meant you could easily chain-sleep everyone. 
---
I agree new Freddy's addons are crap. His best combo was the slowdown addons but those got nerfed after survivors complained even though it wasn't THAT bad. Even his best slowdown addons stacked was less than base-kit old freddy. 
---
If Freddy was comboing Jump Rope + Swing Chains it was 24% slow with everybody asleep. Pretty heavy maybe, but you can just fail a skill check to wake up since if he's using both slowdown addons he can't be running Red Paint Brush. 
---
I also semi-mained OG Freddy. I think the reworked Freddy is better when played conventionally, but I do miss the old one since he was extremely underrated and was decent even at high ranks if you knew how to play him (You had to constantly juggle targets and drop chases. OG Freddy's kit was literally *designed* around rapidly switching targets but 99% of people trying him would let themselves get looped for 5 gens chasing one guy) since looping Freddy often resulted in survivors wasting their own time since Freddy would just switch targets if he felt like he couldn't catch you easily.

I once gamed a killer by running to an empty locker and pointing. They went over and opened the locker while I ran away with lithe.

I played before I saw Ninja playing it.  I don't know what this is?  These ninja posts are fucking boring and old (No i'm not a fan just because I disagree with this toxic communities gatekeeping doesn't make me one)
---
Which you think you would have an understanding of prior to buying it
---
That's exactly the same as hooking a survivor except you don't progress their sacrifice process. You are giving up pressure by slugging a survivor with DS.
---
And you can't slug a survivor in a locker.
---
Any niche hag builds, mr and ms Hag mains? I really hate devour hope is basically her signature perk yet getting it to work, even with hag, is extremely tedious.
---
It's a huge problem with this game, I hate having to try hard every single match some times I just wanna play around and have fun with a killer I'm bad at.
---
NOED is fine for new killers, it's a sort of training wheels perk to help the killer get a grasp of the game mechanics and get some points to get better perks and addons. It's only when high rank and high tier killers use the perk. I used to run the perk on the pig when I just bought her and after I figured out how she works, then swapped it out for something to help me mid-game. 
---
Oh, and the difference between the powers/perks you listed is that you don't earn NOED. You have to aim the chainsaws and get penalised for missing, Iri head you have to aim, Devour hope you have to earn, you get the point.
---
Tbh there not that bad but what really bugs me is the stupid pointless red arrows pointing to the obvious thing.

I just love when people post hieroglyphs in the chat instead of English like every other (most of them also non native English speaking) person...
---
Honestly, what is going through these guys' heads üôÑ
---
Slugging two survivors then finding the 3rd and slugging/hooking them results in a nearly won game, the pressure is all on the last survivor whats the chances they're gonna create a chain reaction of saves resulting in a lost besides an adrenaline play which also isn't as popular as it use to be.

---
Seems like a good buff tbh. But seriously, are you sure your connection to the killer wasn't bad?
---
wE dOnT nEeD aNoThEr ClOwN is a terrible argument
---
&gt; True only bothers me because he spams with uploads.
---
This is why I never subbed to him, among other things.  Just...put it in one video dude, you don't need to upload six 10 minute videos.
---
I think your issue is as a killer, survivors are too good, and as survivor, your teammates are too bad.
---
Hook techs have been patched out lol
---
The Ali A of DBD? The red arrows and oP? Seems like it.
---
It absolutely did fix them. I have a problem with lag maybe 10% as much as I used to.
---
Unsurprisingly, he's a claud main who only plays swf from what I've seen
---
But these people are worse
---
You don‚Äôt know what hypocrite means either apparently ‚Äúdumbass‚Äù. It‚Äôs not contrary at all because lag has improved tremendously
---
Because it‚Äôs much easier to rank up as Survivor than it is for Killer. 
---
Not only that but there‚Äôs not many playing Killer and those that do either don‚Äôt rank up because of the weird Emblem system or they purposely stay away from high ranks as it‚Äôs not worth it. 
---
This results in a large majority of the Killer player base being in purple/green ranks and Survivors being in red ranks. This means high rank Survivors are waiting forever for games so the matchmaking has to eventually throw them into a game and so chooses the next available Killer.

There was a time when he wasn't scary ?!!!

Yes that is an effective strategy that works well, but it has to be in a scenario where slugging is actually a viable tactic. If you slug and don't get to capitalize on it, you've just wasted your own time.
---
r/ninjaishexruiningdbd
---
I actually agree with this. It's kinda sad that dead by daylight has like the worst content creators of all game's. It's either blatant click bait like this or just straight up shrieking and screaming and whining in their videos. Probably why I like Ussylis so much right now because he's pretty laid back and just gives his opinion on why he likes something and has good commentary

---
Can‚Äôt be bothered to always put an offering
---
Forgetting this much? I see 2-3 offerings being used every game at most. Its honestly an habit to me to bring an offering every game for the little BP more it can give honestly
---
Ace doesn't need good perks. His smile is a perk.
---
It takes a second for quite a bit more bloodpoints though, and you got that time when looking for a match
---
&gt; just straight up shrieking and screaming and whining in their videos
---
This in particular really grinds my gears.  I learned a lot from Monto but I've had to stop watching him lately because every single video is just...he picks something to shout, and then shouts it 4-5 times in a row every time something happens.  It's annoying as fuck and not funny - you have a professional sound setup bro, you don't need to scream into the mic.  And I get that it can be hard to come up with "new content" for every video, but at this point I'd rather just watch in silence than having to hear BAM BAM COMING FOR THAT BOOTY at full volume every 20 seconds for half an hour.
---
The gains are pretty small and most people don't think about it if they're not grinding.

The **Simple Border COLORED COMPLETE PACK** is here
---
! all the addons they are not yet colored !
---
most important for updates for colored icon is to keep the perks update the objects icon will be secondary
---
and i'm not extremely good for making colored icons
---
and I merge the files of the normal version and the colored version because
---
I‚Äôm limited to 3000 characters on Steam so I can‚Äôt make new pack
---
I want to thank [u/shineclear](https://www.reddit.com/u/shineclear/) who made several icons in the pack and I also thank [u/WerewolfPenguin](https://www.reddit.com/u/WerewolfPenguin/) (happy clown)

do you like to change your dead by daylight? come on reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/)
---
OoO probably isn't a good idea, I personally get extra sweaty show less mercy when someone has it.
---
I'd personally go for a support build:
---
1. We'll make it or botany knowledge for quicker heals.
---
2. Any exhaustion perk that will make you sprint, so you can butt in quicker when you want.
---
3. Bond to keep track of your friend. Sympathy could also be used, but most newbies don't last long once injured.
---
4. Any perk you personally like. Maybe borrowed time depending on what kind of killers you play against.
---
Maybe even take some medkits with styptic agents and just use it on your friend as soon as he's injured, again most newbies don't last long in chases so he could very well be hit again within 8 seconds.
---
Another idea could even be to change your usernames, though that could backfire depending on the kind of killer you play against.   
---
If your newbie friend changes his name to dweet and you+ other friend change it to dweet bodyguard 1 and 2 , some killers might realize that he's actually new and be a bit more lenient. Or again it could backfire and they'll tunnel dweet, I'll let you figure that one out yourself lol
---
Until the killer counters both of them by just picking you up often.
---
I guess your perks did the job, a real anti slugging perk.
---
50%-100% more BP in a category (or 25% on all) is pretty good for 3k as something you get so often honestly and you really don't lose much doing it
---
People say that a lot. Bugs persist for months, but you can count on mediocre cosmetics never being delayed, even if they're broken (shirtless david, classic ghostface)
---
Just saying. They should hire some better or more programmers or move people from designing cosmetics because they should care about bug fixes more.
---
They‚Äôre marginally beneficial at best most of the time, not nearly useful enough for me to actual remember they exist most of the time unless I‚Äôm grinding BP
---
Can't wait for the "SOLE SURVIVOR META, OP ?"
---
this really doesn't need it's own subreddit 
---
is he really impacting the game that much
---
why
---
Telling people that if they play this game with friends then they get less perk slots is definitely punishing players who are playing with friends. You're not punishing for voice communication, as the game cant detect that in any way. People would stop playing this game if it so strongly discouraged having fun with your friends. 
---
 Hell, I only got this game cause my roommate had it and I wanted to play it with him. Had he told me that I get to use less perks because of that reason, I would never have bought the game. This idea not only makes people who play it suddenly not like the game anymore, it also discourages new players from playing it either. 
---
 The game has been out for a long time. Most new people to the game are here because a friend showed it to them.
---
Yeah, I understand that, but people just forget.
---
With old Freddy I used to camp and tunnel all the time, and oddly enough it worked, I ended up with a lot of 4Ks and a bunch of new friends.
---
Quality meme sir, continue the memeing
---
Thanks for the heads up ‚Äúchecks doctors inventory‚Äù
---
ah yes, a sub for something incredibly specific that will definitely be very active and last more than a week!
---
You get them in your bloodweb so often and for 3k-5k you get everything back and a little bit more from it. Its just free bloodpoints honestly
---
Started testing in a KYF after. It‚Äôs pretty buggy with the hit box on doorways that connect to side halls...
---
Because most players are stupid and think they need to save and hoard things. 
---
The game is designed and balanced around everyone bringing an item and offering, theres literally no reason not to. Even if its just mist or luck or whatever.
---
Oni is actually pretty weak in my opinion
---
How are 360's satisfying?
---
Most people should make it an habit to use them imo. You get them anyway to level up so why not use them to gain back those bloodpoints and maybe even more?
---
This was truly entertaining, +1 sub :)
---
When you average 25k bloodpoints a match anyways, the benefit is so marginal it‚Äôs just not that big a deal, I rarely remember they exist
---
We need a overweight survivor already a fat neck beard
---
HUZZAH!! A man of culture!
---
Thanks for the offer, that's very kind of you! But right now I think it's best for me to just take a little break from the game and pick it up when I'm actually excited to play again :')
---
they just are. getting the killer to miss a hit while you spin around him like a beyblade? that's epic
---
That's interesting. Lerys is a tough map for bubba with all the tight corners and door ways so this is crazy.
---
UP!
---
Indeed you right seems I failed to pay attention
---
It‚Äôs not ideal, but it really isn‚Äôt that bad. I‚Äôve seen much much worse. Also, with the new changes to rank reset, purple ranks are much much worse than before.
---
The iridescent button is very useful. It gets rid of having to break pallets while in frenzy. Besides that there's an add on that gives the broken effect off a hit on a survivor with deep wound. Besides that just try to end a loop asap and use discordance and mad grit to your advantage
---
Yes it's crap
---
That's a great description, didn't see it anywhere on xbox even though it's fairly obvious.
---
I play both ways depending on which killer it is. Mike and ghost face genuinely scare me, I spend those games urban evading look every goddamn direction. Any other killer then hey, just a game and I don't get spooked at all.
---
25k bloodpoints used in getting offerings, addons and items, but mainly offerings since they're everywhere. Bringing a BP offering gives you everything back and a little more for doing normal things in a match. And even the little it gives helps against the immense grind in this game for everything (perks/teachables addons, items).
---
It may do well with Beast of Prey and I'm All Ears for stealthy killers to pressure survivors from losing line of sight. If the Killer can outstealth a survivor, the survivor loses confidence in their escape routes
---
Cool story, bruh.
---
You can be matched against people within 6 ranks of you. This is normal matchmaking
---
I‚Äôve already got everything, what do I need extra BP for? It‚Äôs just not that consequential, I gain enough BP normally to be ready when new characters drop, I just can‚Äôt be fucked to use offerings when I don‚Äôt need them
---
&gt; with Beast of Prey
---
Undetectable removes terror radius already.
---
He‚Äôs very fun, perks aren‚Äôt great but the killer itself is great.
---
Rule 3
---
Gamer moment
---
I love it. It reminds me of a potato. 
---
Also, sad to hear that the rift burned you out and will slow your comic making. I get it though, it‚Äôs definitely taking the life out of the game for many. You‚Äôre art styles are great and I love the adorable comics!
---
Please look at the highlighted offering
---
I at least use a common BP offering every game just for the sake of it but the difference in games is so marginal it‚Äôs not paramount for most players.
---
Say you get the max 8K in one category and so gain 4K with your offering, that‚Äôs an extra 400,000 BP over 100 games. 
---
100 games would take me on average around 30 hours to play. 400,000 extra BP in that time is almost unnoticeable, and that‚Äôs only if you get the 8K max every game anyway.
---
Not against any rules just a dick move.
---
When i first bought pig, she came with 2 glass splinter offerings to play as the pig with no perks.
---
The thing is, these offerings stack up anyway, so the little you get lets you gain back the BP it cost you for the offering itself
---
You think they do this on purpose?
---
100% of the time
---
I have no idea, but buying them with cells or the dlc still dropping them is the dumbest thing
---
I understand that it‚Äôs morally wrong and I‚Äôve started just slugging the person and chasing after the unhooker and going after them. But if I see an injured person during that chase (assuming they unhooker isn‚Äôt injured) I‚Äôll go after them for another down
---
What was the username of the killer? This seems a little too familiar
---
That sir would be the decent thing to do yesüëç
---
The username is censored so rule 3 allows it
---
I just respond to salt with random stuff.
---
"I like chocolate milk" has been a longtime go to
---
But Legion's mori is already one of the best ones. Can we just let him keep something he has that's good?!
---
The username can clearly be seen so no it doesn't
---
üòÇ
---
Like, the three that you aren't playing as appear out of nowhere and stab the Mori'd survivor Julius Caesar style, then you finish them off?
---
Last time I used it on somebody I watched them let somebody else heal them next to the gen we all could have finished in the middle of the hospital map.  
---
 Ya gotta have a sense of humor as a solo survivor.
---
As a Feng player I'm all about that urban evasion. Can't touch this.
---
I drawn over it on my screen , I can't see it
---
More addons and items mainly. Good for you if you have everything but most players dont, yet I still almost never see 4+ offerings
---
"Eichel90"
---
ummm, pardon me for the silly question but why is azarovs key bad? is it because it spawns a lot of pallets or is there some other reason?
---
Im not sure whats hard its a pretty common thing to call a crutch perk same as ruin or NOED. Same as killers saying adrenaline is.
---
They say they shouldn't have to jump into a locker that the killer should just not get that free aura. It is pretty powerful.
---
While I will admit that it displeases next when the slugged person get back up, I still haven‚Äôt had any horrible games where I only get one or two kills. I guess I thought that if I didn‚Äôt hook the survivor again they were out of my claws forever. I was wrong
---
It says the username eichel90 right there, I'm not blind
---
Thank you! I found how downvoted I was strange since I was just giving out a gameplay tip.
