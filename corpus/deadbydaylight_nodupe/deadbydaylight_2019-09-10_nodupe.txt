If we could get the Halloween 3 masks for Micheal it would be a cool callback, even if he never existed in that universe
---
---
---
&gt; Again my point stands, he did NOT pressure any gens.
---

---
Again, you're incorrect. Pressuring survivors is pressuring gens, given a survivors only side objective is to do a generator.
---
This is a joke right?
---
Killers really rush and swing wildly when haunted grounds is expiring. I had my most amazing chase while I was just running for my life for the whole 60 seconds
---
Legion.... oh wait.
---
No, they really should just take out all survivor perks so it will be Balanced.
---
Id use unbreakable, borrowed time, and dead 'ard
---
last time i saw a monto video all he did was whine constantly and then complain when survivor got hatch
---
he runs ruin every build and acts like its interesting content
---
idk just not my type of content creator i guess
---
otz was the first killer content creator that i thought played in a really fair way while not running a shitload of crutches and still having a good time with it
---
Spine chill is actually a fantastic perk to know if the killers heading your way or chasing someone and it's also good in chases to know if they are still chasing you or mindgaming.
---
Tapp, All stranger things characters,
---
Yeah i wasn't sure if they even were being toxic because they wouldn't teabag, just jump in.
---
Classic *BABY* killer. Next you will say noed should be buffed.
---
Before Freddy change I had someone waiting who was awake. I waited for him to jump in but he must've thought he was safe with the putting to sleep thing or that I couldn't shut it, I dunno. Point being I did and he ran and died lmao
---
If this post and your comment was an attempt at sarcasm, you have failed miserably.
---
Lmao let them be hooked
---
I play both survivor and killer, and honestly i feel like this game is not balanced right now. I mean, if you are a really good killer with spirit or nurse you can destroy rank 1 teams, but if you are avarage survs can just bully you. Now noed will be useless cuz everyone will just destroy totems in order to heal, nurse calling will have an indirect nerf, again cuz of the new perks that heal without an animation. Just nerf adrenaline, both speed and healing is too strong. Borrowed time is also an annoying perk, but i guess it prevents tunneling. With all these issues they are going to give 6 new surv perks, well, gg i guess

I think Puppers is fine, DbD can be really tilting sometimes.
---
More than anything though I think Puppers, monto, and noob all have really cringey communities like jeesus I can't watch any of them stream for longer than half an hour because of how bad the donos are. Couldn't imagine trying to put on a grateful face for 8 hours a day with some of the shit they get said to them.
---
&gt; Literally ever since Spirit came out, that was when I started having serious trouble with this game as a survivor.
---
Maybe you're just not actually very good at the game then? Being able to easily beat 14/16 killers consistently doesn't mean you're some god, it just means those killers are just so weak. I find it hilarious that by your own admission the moment they introduce a killer that breaks the standard meta or can't be beaten the same way you scream BROKEN. lol, get gud.
---
Did you read my whole reply, friend? 
---
I said he pressured the wrong survivors! He only attacked two survivors, who which were doing NOTHING. That means there was three survivors pumping away at gens while he threw a bunch of bottles at some guy in the middle of a field.
---
This is NOT how you pressure what-so-ever, hence why gens flew by and he lost the game.
---
It he put adequate pressure he would not have lost as badly as he did, understand? 
---
Rotation, rotation, rotation. The most important thing for a killer to do. What did True do? Throw bottle, throw bottle, throw bottle. This really ain't it Chief.
---
I thought blood hunts usually start on a Friday/Saturday? (cough cough 15th cough cough)
---
Good to know. I thought the skill check difficulty increase wouldn't be worth the trade. I guess you just got to get good if you want to use it efficiently.
---
Calling Plague the worst killer is a massive stretch. A lot of the perks actually have their uses as well. Zubat likes to use Infectious Fright on Nurse and does wonders with it. Dark Devotion admittedly doesn't see a lot of use but sounds amazing on paper. Corrupt Intervention many people consider a viable alternative to Ruin, though it's now rivalled by Thrilling Tremors. 
---
Plague is easily mid-tier and there are arguably many killers that are worse. Trapper's strength is mostly add-on and survivor awareness based, Pig keeps receiving nerfs, Wraith was low tier for the longest time, Leatherface has an awful power but excellent perks to make up for it, Freddy was busted for over a year, etc. 
---
You contradict yourself a ton in this comment. I still see more Jane's running around than I do Plague. People only don't know how to counter Plague because she's almost never played. I guarantee she probably has the lowest pick rate out of any other character. She's probably only rivalled by Leatherface for lowest pick rate.
---
You wouldn’t ;0
---
youre right it wouldnt have because true has a serious problem(like many killer mains) of thinking "i have ruin that means i can just completely ignore gens and they wont get done"
---
he IGNORED gens the ENTIRE GAME what was supposed to happen? if he wants survivors that don't do gens maybe he shouldnt be a red rank killer. god knows he already whines like he's in yellow ranks
---
&gt; This really ain't it Chief.
---
You clearly didn't read my reply.
---
If he'd left the two survivors he kept busy alone, they would have gone and done gens as soon as he'd left. Leaving him in a much worse position.
---
You're wrong on this point. No amount of rotations would have stopped the survivors.
---
I also hate noed, but hey, if you meet an adrenaline-ds-bt-dead hard team it is completly justified
---
He used facecam for some of his Outlast videos. He's a cool guy but there is definitely something subtly off about the way his face looks.
---
For me, he's been fun on the game, where there is practically no LOS. He can make some sneaky plays, and can tbag back if necessary. Not bad by any means, but definitely not spirit.
---
i agree with sir or madam, survivors are too strong and should have  only gotten 3 perks, i mean 6 op perks? smh my head
---
My bad, that’s actually a complete coincidence.
---
 the skill check difficulty is only slightly noticable so it won't effect you that much.
---
I miss Tom.
---
Think of it this way, ghost face came out without a survivor, this is just balancing that.
---
Guarentee you that David, Bill, Ash and Laurie would kill the Legion if they grabbed the axes inside lockers
---
&gt; ENTIRE GAME
---
Seems like you forgot the entire game is over in 4 minutes and 30s.
---
So is the entity a species? Does it need to breed?
---
I don't think you understand the point of the game for survivors. So I'll just post it here so there's no further confusion. How you play is your business, however nothing I said was wrong. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;The aim of the survivor is to find and repair several generators scattered across the map in order to power the exit gates required to escape!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The killer's aim is to find and catch survivors in order to place them on meat hooks on the map so they can be sacrificed to "The Entity". A mysterious being that feeds off the hope of the survivors trapped in its realm.
---

---
&gt;Ohhh so now he's just unlucky? I thought you said he was outplayed?
---
I never changed my point, I just added some additional context to make clear that there are more factors that come in to play. However the strategy starts the second you choose your character and pick your build going in. He choose poorly and was outplayed the entire match by players who were doing the objectives. 
---
Which is what they were supposed to do. Those are not mutually exclusives concepts bud. 
---
Also I said nothing negative about the man, and I can't see how you'd even insinuate that from anything I did say. Again, we all have bad games. As a survivor main for almost 2 years, I've seen it go the other way plenty of times. Enough so, that this isn't an issue. If it is for you, perhaps you need to up your game and start putting together builds that will nullify this from happening.
---
You act surprised or upset that not being at the top of your game with a high skill cap character is going to lead to you not performing well. This whole thread is a goddamn mess.
---
Shut up, Meg.
---
Why such the hard-on for tru? The guy lost. Big deal. Stop defending his crappy gameplay.
---
From the next update it will no longer be a problem with the new locker healer perk
---
No nurse is better than billy (on pc at least)
---
I think you're having a comprehension problem. I said ... 
---
&gt;I can't speculate on what he could have done without knowing for sure if it was a SWF group he was up against. 
---
There's no point in wasting my time addressing that as one way it's unfair to him and the other it's his own play that caused it. We don't know which so … next!
---
 And then offer my opinion on SWF in general. 
---
&gt;Personally, I don't want them grouped with me as a solo player either and there isn't much you can do without negatively impacting  solo players. You need to separate them.
---
You ignored that when posting your reply despite it addressing your question. 
---
I never said the objective was to escape as quickly as possible and everyone knows that doesn't always happen. As I've said before, there are a lot of circumstances that dictate the match. I'm literally just repeating myself.
---
Happy to help my friend
---
Wut
---
Even on pc 2 blink nurses get destroyed easily
---
Yeah, you're right. It doesn't follow the the format of this meme. And, even if that doesn't matter, it's confusing to read. It looks like "Mom: We have At home \[Dead by Daylight\]."
---
OP has failed at memery. I, therefore, recommend beheading.
---
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Hoo boy, no. Steve is lvl 36 and Nancy is lvl 15.
---
Poor rank 13
---
there's no way this isn't bait
---
I almost wanted to die watching someone sacrifice their lunacy ticket
---
It’s kinda weird that steam allows people to have the exact same username
---
what location is it available?
---
Makes the game more enjoyable IMO
---
Honestly, that’s a fine low level build. At level 15 you should try out dead hard since it’s terrible to figure out if you don’t know. But it’s quite useful
---
Yeah that’s farming. It allows you to still play the game while also having both sides rack up points.
---
Omg did you just make a meme with a Shawn the sheep ep. Your amazing.
---
Survivors in the endgame lobby: "That was a great game, everyone! Let's talk about the most exciting moments of that match, and share what we found the most fun and interesting about it!"

No
---
It _is_ a crutch tho. Lots of killers think about it like a winning ace and wait for it to get sacrifices, when their mentality should be winning before the gens are done. I have seen some dc's because noed didnt activate lol
---
Its the only form of use dead hard
---
Yes, reports do result in suspensions or even bans. Chat reports are probably the easiest bans for the support team to deliver.
---
Just report this player in-game and that should be enough. If he doesn't get immediately punished (which I highly doubt), it certainly will create a history so the next time it might not go overlooked.
---
It costs you $0 to not type what you just did
---
Just adds to the no mither meme
---
That was a good game, quality meme I remember it like it was yesterday
---
You can always make them bigger to compensate. 
---
They least they can do is give it tweaks.
---
Just next to the gen pieces
---
The few times I have it just makes me *more angry*
---
Nice rank 20 response dude.
---
Its not unnecessary cause lunges need fixing, they arent proportionate to the killers actual hitting distance. Plus why make all the killers basically the same? Why not add some variety and difficulty to make things much more interesting and not so one dimensional.
---
&gt; I mostly meant that since she came out I started seeing/having a MULTITUDE of issues with the game.
---
Yet you didn't mention any of these "MULTITUDE of issues", only how Spirit isn't fair because you can't beat her because by your own admission she's not a cake walk like almost all the others.
---
I know what ping is. I can tell the difference between a hit that obviously lagged. But having a killer legit miss you but still hit cause of the wonky animation that doesnt go with the actual hitbox is just poor design and laziness.
---
On PC yes, but on Xbox and PS4 no.
---
People have their own steam id which means that multiple people can have the exact display name. Also the username is not the same as a display name because the display name is the name which shows when people look at your profile or see your name in game and the login username is the one that has to be unique I'm pretty sure.
---
(Example: This is mine  [https://steamid.io/lookup/76561198087139090](https://steamid.io/lookup/76561198087139090)  versus someone's on my friends list  [https://steamid.io/lookup/76561198305469253](https://steamid.io/lookup/76561198305469253) )
---
I don't know why you are being downvoted..
---
However, I did add to it out of peer pressure.
---
If you don't want to save with Noed that's reasonable, some people just don't wanna gamble
---
I agree, thanks for that
---
Mmmmm image quality
---
Oh, you want to escape with an item? Sorry, every killer is going to immediately tunnel and camp you for the next 50 games
---
(In my opinion)
---
Side note, god does the reboot look fucking dumb. Name it literally ANYTHING else and I’m on board, but that’s not Black Christmas.
---
Easily spotted, but still harder to spot than the original mask.
---
I see you're an Xbox player
---
Ahh man that would have been so much better
---
Is-Is that Nea riding alongside the killers?
---
I dont run we'll make it because of this. I legit chased someone across the entire map and i couldnt catch up to them before well make it ended
---
Dwight gets a 0.5 boost in repair speed whenever someone gets injured, downed, or hooked. Stops boosting at 30. 
---
Should this be a % or whatever the other option is?
---
What is noed? New player
---
Not a solution yet, but i did contact support and they said i have to make sure that my NAT type is set to 1 and and to restart my router if the problem is still going, i did the router option, didn't work and my NAT type has been set to 2 so that might be the problem, but i swear i've never hit nat type 1 and i've been playing as killer perfectly fine till this problem ocurred, im only hoping i can change my internet company because its honestly trash, and also hope that with the September update this is fix.
---
No One Escapes Death, a killer perk that leaves you exposed (one hit).
---
Also, welcome!
---
Oink
---
STANDO POWA!
---
I had a match the other day in the PTB where the leather face had NOED, I didn't know where the totem was and he downed all 3 of my teammates right before I opened the gate. Needless to say he saw me trying to revive one of my teammates and came after and got me right before I could hit the final tap to open the gate. I didn't make it. 
---
In the post chat the killer questioned why I went back when it was impossible for me to save them and said I should have just left. He was right, but my response was fuck it ... it's just a game. I have to try. I wish more people played that way. The game would be so much more fun.
---
It literally doesnt matter, you shouldnt be popping EW3 unless youre in swing/lunge range of the survivor as well. 
---
I hit red ranks with Michael consistently, I just barrel at them after Tier 2 and charge it to 99% as im chasing them. Pop EW3 when youre basically touching them and down them, no waste and you werent wasting much time.
---
Mike is like the 2nd or 3rd tallest killer, the survivor WILL see you no matter what.
---
Nah man it’s not you’re fault don’t worry, I personally am just irked by all the requests
---
Roflmao! Sounds like something my friend would do
---
Can’t afford pc sadly
---
I actually have a few questions for you, some related some not
---
1 - What is devotion? I saw this once somewhere but idk what it means
---
2 - How effective is Iron Will against you? I know blood pools are still easy to track, but if you're running against an Iron will and you have stridor, does this negate it?
---
I guess that's it lmao, I can't think of anything else even though I know I had another question, if I think of it I'll drop it again
---
thanks! i'm trying something different now with some more editing :) practice makes perfect I guess!
---
P3 Claudette: "I sense a disturbance in the force."
---
You are going to struggle the most with survival category, there are few perks that grant you bp in this category: deliverance (1500 bp) decisive strike (1000), head on (500 for each stun) self care (300 bp, I'd suggest to take a medkit instead)
---
I do stick around in some games, I guess it just depends on how I feel. I think what fueled me the most to leave in this situation was the hatch being right in front of me, in these situations I never know where it is so I will just go full send and attempt to save.
---
I once had a baby Dweet drop pallets on me because he thought I was the killer.
---
Because I may or may not have an opposing Political opinion you feel like my overall opinion is invalidated?  See, you're the worst type of person.   If you base everything in your life off of identity politics like this, then you are the real danger here.  
---
You should probably go outside and rethink your life.
---
Those are the worst addons to use since you break people very fast with the standard vomit. If people don't cleanse, your addons are absolutely no use one everyone is broken which happens easily and early. Charge speed, cooldown reduction, movement speed, and apples are the best to use. Especially apples.
---
Devotion is basically player level 100. So I'm around player level 1500.
---
Not really. Stridor allows me to hear you at 25% sound. So as long as I pay attention, iron will doesn't stop me at all. But again, that's with lots of experience and practice.
---
im gonna tell you what i tell every other killer that says that: stop being a tiny dick little beta bitch boy. literally anything a survivor can do can be countered by killer, either through a perk or through skill. this game has NEVER been more killer sided than it is now. at this point the ONLY advantage survivors have(yes even 4man swfs) is the speed that generators get done. there is no more instablinds, no more pallet vaccums, no more pallets every 5 feet, no more instant ds, no more mom, and any strong item a survivor can bring is countered by Franklin's. the game isnt brokenly in favor of survivors. weak killers were made stronger. literally the only thing holding you back from getting at least two kills every game(which is the balance the devs are going for btw, just because you dont 4k every game doesnt mean the game favors survivors) is your own lack of skill. git fucking gud and stop being a whiney ass killer for the fucking love of god. you are the power role. you decide everything in this game. without you survivors are bots that hold r1/m1/whatever and do gens..NOTHING ELSE. it is YOUR job as killer to stop them from doing that. it's not the games fault you cant. it's your own.
---
I read 11.99 somewhere; going to see if I can find it again.
---
I don’t know, grunting and the droplets of blood makes walking and sneaking pretty difficult
---
&lt;3 thanks
---
But nah they're unpublished, the assets that I've put together/ modified are published though including some that haven't been in a video yet
---
Bill is good at blending in with grass, he is wearing cameo.
---
Pretty much anyone that plays her uses those lol, theyre universally considered the best. The standard vomit takes way too long in a loop, you can literally hit them with one blast with stacked add ons and down as if it were EW3. 
---
Its your opinion, but pretty much every "OP" build uses those add ons.
---
The sub is dominated by phaggots like you that live in this bizarro world reality. People like you are absolute cancer. The kind of guy that will cry endlessly when the killer uses a mori, or the killer doesn't play by your rules, or the killer uses NOED. 
---
OP, you will never get through to these people. These people are entitled phaggots that were never told no, mommy and daddy failed disciplining them and they have no idea how the real world works. Because let me tell you survivor phaggots this: if you go through life believing everyone has to cater to you then you'll be nothing. You'll continue being a POS.
---
I usually hook survivors 2 times if we're farming. 
---
The other day 2 of the survivors got scared and left their 2 buddies on the hook even though I made it clear we were farming and nobody was at risk. 
---
They trashtalked me in the lobby and I tried to point out their friends left them, it had nothing to do with me....but you can't tell some people anything.
---
Absolutely and with the coming dedicated severs itll be way easier to punish these people. And with a mouth lie that that is totally a temp ban
---
either salt, or they can't be bothered to wait through the mori (lots of fun btw, moris are fun /s )

that mematic crop though

yes

Looks like the pig finally got the buff she deserved.
---
Removed for salty game chat
---
I did a ghost face for 15 under main building in swamp, i was then t-bagged and face camped the rest of the game
---
pink bulb is awful, youre better off using a addon that increase's accuracy and longer battery life
---
Especially against Michael... do you want to become exposed with all the survivors in a close proximity with no progress being made on generators?
---
This looks like some kind or obscure porn.
---
I just had the last guy DC as I was like two feet from him. I just want to experience a Mori
---
I will try it if they make it work while injured.
---
First, the best addons are either batteries or blind duration.
---
Second, you have to time the blind so it blinds the killer right after they end the pickup animation and they can move. (about 2 seconds after they start picking them up)
---
Were you playing as Nea?
---
Fuck I forgot
---
Must be tough living without sex 😔
---
I was playing Michael and I killed 3 survivors in the first 5 minutes of the game, I let the last guy have hatch and he teabagged before he went in. I wish I could’ve grabbed him in time lol
---
well people find mori's as "bullshit and unfun" which is another reason as they might dc, to prevent you from doing the mori.
---
“Outplayed” proceeds to hide in a bush the entire game making it a 3v1 LUL
---
I've been saying this so much. The shred only seems good because people suck at dodging it currently but once people get better against it and the portals in general he'll just be a mid tier killer. Apparently the shred isn't supposed to work with STBFL and NOED(from what I heard could be wrong) also meaning it will be even worse
---
This actually made me laugh really hard, I hope you let that survivor live.
---
I like to use tenacity with that.  It is so fun just to mess around with that build.
---
If you will not serve in ~~combat~~ gen rushing then you will serve on the firing line
---
COME BRAWL ME I GOT A FLASHLIGHT BRO
---
I mean yes?  
---
Why not kill them, it's not like they lose points for dieing after they've farmed out max in each field.
---
I run m&amp;a and sometimes dead rabbit. So the range I give off a heartbeat, even in EW2, is quite small.
---
I can assure the difference is so minimal that it literally does not matter
---
perfectly what i need to see after im off of nea
---
And he is clearly letting them farm, especially since he said “farming with them” instead of “farming them”
---
how hard would it be to code a second exit line like 5 feet past???
---
soo... you're agreeing with me?!
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
I'm on Xbox too! No judgement.
---
Ayyyy
---
Nah
---
We can play sometime if you play survivor.
---
It's his mori
---
Meaning the buff wouldn’t be op...?
---
That pimple got me woozed
---
Following the road map looks like when chapter 13 gets released or a little after
---
I am that special forces.. hi everyone! I can do gens  while you fucking make the killer cry
---
I'm don't mind the perk existing but I'm not gonna stop swearing when I get fucked by it
---
It would be pointless. Is the buff needed?
---
He also abused the fuck out of bugs and glitches and showcased them a lot in his content.
---
I’d love that honestly
---
He's not a clown, he's the entire circus
---
Regardless, youre still detectable by Spine Chill, which is an insanely popular perk, and Premonition. I guarantee you wont be as stealthy as youre looking to be past tier 2 since they know what to look for, the only true Mike stealth build is scratched mirror on lery's.
---
Seriously, dont worry about stealth and being seen as Myers, its just going to make you do worse the more you worry about it.
---
100% not a joke..
---
either in solo queue or when i play with friends, i'll patrol gens looking for people to do coop with, but i'm not touching a solo gen..
---
i try not to skip my fun regardless of who the killer is. if nobody wants to do generators i'm not gonna do them either.
---
as for if I worry about the killer, my teammates and i get points for rescuing each other. even if the killer is really bad i'm expecting people to go on the hook or the game is boring &amp; i move on. 
---
notice all of my scoring categories were maxed already and we were doing the last generator.. 
---
i just reference a different play style maybe.
---
I was thinking a picture from a scene in some sort of haunted house set-up but yeah sure.. porn.
---
Honestly it's all ranks on all platforms
---
It’s even funnier when you’re pig and they think you’re one of them at first
---
idek but it’s probably harder than we think if they dont do it.
---
I mean..yeah? Lol NOED is a problem against any killer. Not only do they get insta downs, they can 4% faster speed which is basically bloodlust (and for failing to protect gens but that’s a different story). 
---
Thrill of The Hunt is useless if they’re gonna patrol dull totems then they’re wasting time. 
---
Bloodwarden isn’t hard to counter, only works on stupid SwFs. Just 99% the door, and if you’re going for a save then unhook the door as you guy’s are running to avoid BW
---
Make Your Choice will be pretty good on Demo because he can go right back to the hook so yeah that’s a problem. But any killer could have the same thing since most killers proxy hooks so they’re usually close
---
These outfits shouldn't exist in the game in the first place.  
---
It takes away skill to stealth gameplay on top of being highly unfair to people who are colourblind or vision impaired.  
---
Competitive games actively avoid making the experience worse for people who are colourblind or vision impaired, yet DbD a casual game refuses to do the same.
---
There’s jackshit you can do in this situation. 
---
You find NOED, LF gets a notification where you are so he’ll be prepared to insta down you with chainsaw if you go for unhook. 
---
You don’t find NOED, insta down. 
---
I only go for saves when NOED is present if the killer isn’t facecamping, because I run Borrowed Time (it should be a default in literally everyone’s build, it makes the basement “bare-able,” counters all facecampers except Bubba, allows for cool end of game saves, etc. If no Borrowed Time and no NOED then can you bodyblock providing there’s no Make Your Choice too
---
I would always rather teammates leave so the guy running on NOED gets fucked for relying on a perk like that, you’re literally planning for loss
---
Dead Hard/Adrenaline/Windows 
---
Windows is a great perk and one of the most underrated in the game. Don't listen to the people that call it a training wheels perk. It's not meant to help you memorize pallet locations, it's meant to show you which pallets haven't been used by your idiotic teammmates. I consider myself a good looper, and I can't tell you how many times I went down very quickly to a bad killer because every single pallet location I went to was already turned into a dead zone 5 minutes into the match.
---
I really like Dance With Me as well, but I would advise making a seperate build for it since it doesn't synergize with any of the perks you listed
---
Which survivor is borrowed time for? I should start leveling that one up
---
i mean... chainsaws do cut through logs :\
---
I mentioned the point. It makes the game flow nicer for the killer. Players see full perspective in 3rd person and killer sees in 1st person. So the use of the mechanic is actually of a more technical aspect so that when your playing as the killer you have the choice to use it as a tactical advantage if you learn how to use it properly.
---
Kinda yeah lol
---
Not enough 2s imo
---
Or you can turn and look, as you suffer no movement speed penalty for moving sideways or backwards. It's a feature no one will ever use as in the heat of the moment they will just turn instead of holding an extra button to turn just their head. It's a bad idea, sorry man.
---
Just aim at chin. Try doing it in a kyf
---
Bill. He also comes with Unbreakable (was recovering from dying state once per match + 30% or 35% recovery) and Left Behind which is useless in its current state but in the next update when Stranger Things is released it’ll let you see the hatch in a certain distance during endgame
---
Ohtofu just made a whole flashlight guide, I recommend watching that since it shows stuff like aim, range, and what add ons do what
---
Once I get self care done I’ll go with him. Thanks for this
---
&gt;and fame famous
---
daaamn, Id like some fame famous

Identity V is partnerd with dbd they’re not supposed to be competing

Always hate those moments. You say to your self "OMG we are going to make it". Then the feeling of disappointment sets in.

I'd say prove thyslef, dance with me, dead hard adrenaline.
---
Adreniline: Just a great perk that can fit in any build.
---
Prove thyself:semi counters the really common ruin.
---
Dead Hard+Dance with me: dead hard to a vault, killer swings misses and can't find you again because of dance with me.

After you get more teachables, I suggest you swap Proveyhyself for borrowed time or Iron will

WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF BRO
---
#O U T P L A Y E D
---
I know, the way I panned over perfectly. Though I had no suspicion anything was there, I didn't even know who the killer was yet. Super spooks :(
---
How do I get mori with killers I’m new to the game and don’t know how killers work but my ritual is get one kill with the chain saw guy for 60k blood points
---
I think it's mint rag hag with extra steps.
---
It's mint rag basicly
---
That is a very nice pillow.
---
"felt skanky, might delete later"
---
I disappointed myself on this one...
---
ohhh yessss
---
o.o
---
😂😂😂💀💀💀
---
I’m not new actually, I just wanted it to do it. I only needed like 1,000 more BP before I got off last night, mostly just trying to stack up my survivors with perks and consumables so none of them are naked. 
---
Thank you for the thought though
---
Tru3Ta1ent: -misses- FOOKIN DED 'ARD
---
/s, he's fun to watch but he really seems unsure any time he ever misses lol
---
Ace in the hole, it is the only perk I have used for the last 8 months or so
---
Existing is a hard counter to Legion.
---
As others stated no but it does make the survivors want to die if you play demogorgon as he screeches when attacking
---
That's ONLY for altruism bloodpoints.... and it doesnt give you 100% bonus total BP earned... its 100% bloodpoints that you do gain during the match in the altruism category.
---
The way BBQ works is at the end of the match you get 100% bonus bloodpoints, of your total.
---
The way wglf works is you get 100% bonus altruism BP during the match... this means that your altruism BP is still maxed at 8k bloodpoints. You just earn the max 8k faster.
---
Bbq works better because instead of maxing at 8k during the match... at the end of the match is rewards your bloodpoints as 100% of your normal total... so if you get 7k in deviousness then you'll make that 14k with bbq at the end...
---
Where as survivor if you get 8k altruism with were gunna live forever... you still get 8k.
---
Did I explain that right?
---
In my opinion its not toxic at all i actually feel like it hurts the survivor more than it hurts me since i can hear him anyways. Most good killers have this view.
---
Flashlight stun after picking up someone is a lot more annoying but its part of the game.
---
Ps4
---
Constant Entity noises when playing survivor against the Doctor.  Was very off putting.
---
In some hypothetical situation it may.
---
On the other side closest to killer
---
I've never seen that happen. I imagine it probably happened a lot right after the vaccuum pallet change
---
the demogorgon is not a whore, it just has a very distinguished style ok?
---
Not to any degree of reality
---
I’m going to get the demogorgon, but only because it’s and angry inter dimensional creature
---
We would get a broken gate. They can’t add those now that the game was out for this long. 
---
If they just increased some specific stats for some survivors, everyone would switch to the best one and it’d be a straight up buff to survivors 
---
The bonus would also have to be so miniscule to not break the game too much, it would hardly be noticeable
---
Unless they nerfed other things, which would make it less enjoyable as survivors would get worse across the board.
---
Also, imagine that you have all the perks and cosmectics on your ace and he gets passive 5% luck, while Meg has like 2% movement speed or faster exhaustion recovery.
---
Nice job, you dont know how many ppl I see mess it up when I'm killer
---
Ok, im telling you it doesnt matter and youre wasting your time worrying about it. Neither is camouflaged more because "camo" isnt useful in this game as Myers
---
In Portuguese, only "Entidade (female)".
---
Thank you and geez that must be embarrassing for them oof
---
Wow your title I..I like it
---
I deranked like three times in one and a half hours because of the matchmaking...
---
What is even happening?
---
r/emojipolice
---
I love how no one even checks the flair and instantly thinks this person is serious
---
jUsT ApPly PResSurE LoL
---
Guy probably didn't lag-switch, people just can't figure out that if the killer has bad internet, it effects everything. Host connection is a hard concept
---
Tbh dont know why she didn't wait after the first locker play lol
---
As a healer main, this speaks to me.
---
Imagine having friends lmao
---
Yea I’ve been playing since launch and my friends and I will occasionally if not most of the time screw up the pallets throwing them to early or blinding to early so take the wins when you can
---
People say not to use the ambush with Pig, but crouching and ambushing Mid-chase can be exactly what you need to close a gap sometimes...but I am biased, I love Pig
---
I mean, some stuff "in the game" is highly debatable if it should actually be in the game. Moris for example.
---
But flashlights at pallets? i much rather face that than people with toolboxes
---
The disappointment as ghost face stays around to tunnel with his non existent TR
---
hahahahah
---
It's the same thing with piggy's  ambush attack.It doesn't get any stbfl stacks AND doesn't down exposed people,but it consumes a token from play with your food.
---
It also does not work with franklin's.
---
Thanks lol
---
1) We also had a chainsaw guy, and got bubah. We had legion and got ghostface etc. So thats not realy an issue with bhvr
---
2) The personification of evil that can trandform into anything and likes to eat children is boring and dull ? To each theur own i guess
---
Have you not seen a pro play nurse or is this just bait?
---
Sorry, I'm lightborn and am at tier 3. No sunlight for me.
---
Probably not that hard, the problem is that the glitch doesnt affect just the gate. It prevents a lot of interactions in a match, so it's more to do with interactions of a specific kind than the gate
---
She had noed for sure
---
Sigh. uwu
---
TBH I don't want to rank, I just want to have an even game because I suck and want to improve.
---
this is amazing
---
For that mask
---
Didn't know jumping off the map gave you balanced landing
---
Freddy with moveable generators+1 bootleg Nurse blink = Demogorgen
---
why pp hard
---
Please tell me. Is that a Myers stalking behind that beautiful pillow? I must know. :D
---
Oooh this is fantastic!
---
Until you realize it's _because_ you were trash the whole game
---
I'd think you were even more of a fool, trying to teabag at someone when THEY owned YOU..but okay
---
Kind of look like the meme where the guy is looking over his shoulder at another girl
---
Nah,iron grasp,agitation,mad grit and bbq and chili.then you equip her drill weapon cosmetic and the fun begins.
---
Empathy for life
---
If I saw somebody with that in the store I would loop and drop a book stand on them.
---
See, that’s the way to make the concept your own! Incorporate info and insight into potential perks and abilities, then people won’t ridicule you even though you’re new :) the politeness you bring is rare so cherish your ability to have it ;)
---
The only similarity is with mint rag hag, otherwise he's his own killer, much like ghost face who is a blend of two killers but the play style is completely different from both of them and you won't do too well if you play him like either one
---
Yeah, we call Jane Big Booty. XD
---
Why is everyone else's Ghostface so nice but mine just hooks and walks around the fucking corner waiting!?
---
If you’re running Calm Spirit it causes you to skip that state because it counts as a scream and calm spirit stops you from screaming.
---
i ditched my old reddit account for this username
---
i don't regret it
---
Any chance that's a reference to Gavin from Achievement Hunter :O
---
Omg I'm such a dumb dumb
---
You were actually starting to make up a point but then when you started gloryfing clown over freddy you totally lost all credibility. You like clown but are biased towards him thats why your opinion is basically worthless
---
And the last time i checked tru3 and otz they said clown is shit, i even remember the date of the tru3 stream - 2 of september, watch the vod if you dont believe me
---
Ugh. Jesus. Gross.
---
I knew what was gonna happen and still made me laugh more than expected lol
---
If I'm not mistaken, Otzdarva and OhTofu has recent ones? I'd definitely check YouTube.
---
That was just a good play by you and bad play by Myers, tbh. He could have mostly avoided the possible flashlight blind by facing the wall next to him on pickup. He missed the hook next to him, and - even worse - chose to walk through a pallet to get the endgame hook knowing a survivor was nearby, being way too certain he'd win that race, when he can easily predict adrenaline might be about to happen.
---
I didn't expect much from him, both my friends were rank 17
---
S t a l k
---
Least favorite is probably the plague. Favorite is probably Michael. Although a good Spirit or Nurse can be terrifying.
---
No, I mean once the pallet is down, they get succ to the same side the killer is on
---
Quick and Quiet kinda relies on them being in "chase mode" where they don't think about lockers for a sec (or 3 sec &gt;:D) even though realistically there is no other place you could be to disappear like that.
---
It is very lucky to get a save like the video I linked without baiting it out in something like SWF to be fair.
---
Hex: Devour Salt
---
Ya know I played Bo2 a lot when it was out and played zombies probably more than the multiplayer, I never once played it with sound because it was PS3 and sibling rules are no headphones no sound, that is seriously a creepy song and would've made that zombie mode even better
---
It gets worse btw. If you play a full match 5 gens get done and the killer doesn't like that they can close the app and prevent all survivors that are alive from getting any points.
---
If they leave game via pause screen you get points.
---
The word for entity is female in French. This has come up like 100 times, and no, they've confirmed it's just an “it.”
---
The moment when you are the last bubba main and everyone is laughing
---
If I know someone's being chased, I'll try to wait until they're uninjured.
---
Otherwise, if it glows, it's getting cleansed. I've lost games due to not cleansing Ruin/Devour when I had the chance, couldn't get back to it, and no one else could find it.
---
That's a useless nobody right there.
---
Freddy, Wraith, Doctor and Hag I find extremely unfun to play against.  I like playing against Trapper, Billy, Ghost Face, Pretty much the rest. Freddy, wraith, doc and Hag just feel cheap and too powerful.
---
This isn’t a request or suggestion post so much as it is for fun.
---
Yea for sure imma spend some but I wanna have exactly a million to spend on the dlc. And thank u for being the only person with human decency in this thread lol
---
Normally u don't, but after carrying him to the gen when it was just two and he didnt realize, I decided to see exactly how long it would take him
---
when you loop the killer then dead hard into the vault instead of vaulting.... thats my routine.
---
Dudes kind of an asshole for not letting you find the hatch. Obviously it’s not his fault this glitch happens and no one asked for it but you earned that escape.
---
Go Franklin's! Yeeet! *smacks the flashlight and smile out of her*
---
Well thats True in MOST cases, but as i play both sides i understand why People do "toxic" things, like not leaving the hook right away cos somebody didn't show up on bbq, no reason to give someone an ez unhook
---
I'll add you, I need more people to play with when my friends are offline
---
Lmfao
---
&gt;Neither is camouflaged more because "camo" isn't useful in this game as Myers.
---
What? Just because camouflage is arguably useless with Myer's doesn't mean one outfit arrangement doesn't provide more camouflage. Your argument makes no sense.
---
One color arrangement of Myer's is outfit is going to blend in better with the environment, even if only by a tiny margin.
---
Lmao I can just feel the panic in your mouse movement
---
I hate playing against the Hag lol
---
no worries dude. I'm OCD with my points so thats why i spend a good amount sometimes if the bloodweb is being kind ill only spend 10000. do you have some survivor pudding add ons saved?
---
Me, too. I just take hits for teammates to rack up the tokens. I will work through a huge portion of a generator thinking, "That person has been on the hook for a long time. I guess no one is working on saving them." I get to the hook and there is a survivor hiding in bushes two feet away from the hook.
---
Lmao
---
Well, you got the killer part right, killer makes way more points than survivor, simply because they can't be "removed" from a match like survivor can. Perks like BBQ, beast of prey, Distressing, WGLF, and prove thyself help a lot with points, as you know.
---
As survivor, don't be a dick, and live as long as you can. If you play like a dick, you're gonna be killed a lot faster, which means less points. And this means don't farm your teammates for WGLF stacks, too. If they get killed, that's one less target for the killer, and you're probably next. Adjust your playstyle when you need to, like if you have full objective, go save/heal somebody or distract the killer for a while.
---
The don't be a dick thing applies to killer, too... if you tunnel/camp, you're giving the other survivors plenty of time to get gens done and finish the game faster, meaning less points for you.
---
TLDR: Don't play like a dick. The longer you're in the match, the more points you'll earn.
---
It changes fairly regularly, but:
---
Least favorite:  Recently I’ve been getting a lot of Hags who are just the absolute worst.  The kind that will lay 5 traps around a hook, then proceed to camp 10 feet away anyways.  The kind that, with 5 generators remaining, refuses to ever move outside of their pre-ordained 3 gen box, the kind that never use their traps in a chase then act all pissy when you loop them, the kind that makes you fold your arms and frown and wonder how the hell people can have fun doing this
---
Favorite:  After getting completely neutered, it seems like the only people who are still playing Legion are the ones who just genuinely enjoy that edgy teenaged shitlord and have fun doing so.  Legion players seem pretty chill now.
---
&gt;1) Camp Hooks
---
That was a really quick way to destroy credibility.
---
But really tho how often does that happen? I mean it happen to some people but that's not a reason to not main survivor.  I can say I dont main killer because I dont want to play against a squad of SWF. You see where I'm going with this? Its gonna happen and theres not much you can do about it just play what you can and run another one
---
When you stalk someone at a gen and they turn have spine chill
---
Not to any 100th or even 1000th of a percent mate, the difference is about as minor as being able to tell the difference between two blades of grass
---
badass alert 😲 ok gamer ur so epic!! 😎👌
---
Least favourite are Hag and Spirit
---
Favourite are good trappers, doc, ghost face, pig, billy
---
People these days...
---
That image... where is it from?
---
Plus your post history. Are you a troll?
---
You can easily hide in a random bush away from gens and simply change bushes on every hook. The killer will never find you without Whispers or searching every bush on the map. But more importantly, it funnels the killer towards your teammates because he never finds you. They get hooked multiple times faster, and every survivor that dies accelerates the process.
---
The game is designed around chases and looping, not hide and seek. If you're using Spine Chill / Urban to lose the killer during a chase, more power to you. But if you're using it to avoid chases completely, your teammates probably hate you and you're a net loss to your team.

---
If you really believe that p3 claudettes don't have a significant advantage, I can only assume you're either a mutant with developing superpowers, or you don't play killer.
---
I picked this up back in October of 2018 and played for a few weeks but just recently got into it. At first I hated the rank system too, but its shown me how different players use mechanics as you increase rank. I would say stick with it and you will improve. You will learn to love perks that change the game in your favor. Question is,  are you killer or survior?
---
You don't play killer at a high level. There's no way you do. Simply saying "no more pallets every 5 feet" leads me to believe you haven't even played a killer match on Temple of Purgation or Mt Ormond.
---
Uninstall the game btw pls
---
Thank you, finally another sensible person.
---
Spine chill doesn't work vs T1 myers
---
Take a break. There is no shame in that.
---
It helps me a lot to just not touch that game in a week or so and start anew in the new week. 
---
Good luck !
---
Eh, p3 Claudette is such a significant advantage over every other cosmetic. Simple as that.
---
Fun Fact, you can actually hear him around 3 second mark. If you're wearing headphones it's just on the left side too!
---
If you never have fun, you shouldn't play a game. That's why I quit Dota even after playing it for 15 years. Wins were just relief from the frustration and losses were maddening at best.

You have limited free time, don't waste it on something you don't enjoy.

Demogorgon is only similar to a hag with the mint rag offering. Base kit they’re completely different.
---
If you start the vid when the vid you posted hits 15 seconds the music transitions at the same time the Meg gets downed. Just thought it was a perfect fit.
---
Lmao that Myers sneak attack
---
Sorry but if you aren't going to leave you will just have to get used to this, or find some people to play SWF/KYF.
---
Below any add on it’ll say “stacks” if the effect stacks
---
no mercy man, my heart stopped for a good second
---
Considering he looks like a testicle this is literally perfect and he has a chain around his neck in the captured demogorgon set, so does that me the demogorgon just has a large testicle cuff on him?
---
David can punch tf outta the killer to assert dominance.
---
They meant that survivors will feel safer bringing good items since the Killer is less likely to waste a perk slot on Franklins unless they know they need it. And Killers will still dodge lobbies if they don’t like the map.
---
Wanted to comment this :D
---
This does put a smile on my face.
---
I shit you not yesterday I was running that really big pallet loop on pale rose against Michael and I got a really good lead on him cuz I was on one side and he was on the other, I turn my camera away for not even a second and when I turn it back he’s right in front of me. Like there’s no way you can do this with any add ons, perks or anything. He just straight up fucking teleported. I’m not even mad about it, when it happened I just laughed my ass off.
---
Spider like monsters tend to be female, Don't look at me, I'm sure you recall that scene from "Enemy" even if you haven't seen the movie
---
Omg nice catch! I wear headphones but I guess I wasn't attentive enough.
---
Somehow, it gets worse(?) I am always hovering around  rank 5 as killer (and somehow always stuck at rank 15 as survivor) and survivors are very organized. Like, always survive with friend groups. And they are frustrating. And to top it off, usually the ones who die are the ones who aren't actually swf, which is unfortunate for me, since I fall into that category. So basically your being handicapped for not playing the game with the party system which was never balanced for the game anyway. You usually have to be an asshole in order to actually get kills or prevent yourself from getting messed with, so it kinda sucks the fun out of it. Usually decent games are far and few between, but they are usually good if you can tell. But then there is all the crap in-between it and it makes you want to never play again.
---
Sure. I still want to know which one is more camouflaged.
---
if they're universally considered the best, why are you getting downvoted? monkaHmm

3/4 games as killer I play, I let everyone go if they co-operate and farm. Still not banned.
---
Dude same shit happened to me earlier. 3, 3, 2, 19 ranks. Boosted trash.
---
Same
---
Well I’m sick of playing against Billy in Rotten Fields and Michael on Lehry’s, but that doesn’t mean I DC every time I load in. I’m also sick of going against Killers who bring a Mori with the full intention of tunneling people off hook for an easy win.
---
I don't... totally get it
---
Same lol. I have yet to meet a Nice Killer GF but I assume it's because he has a way of communicating to survivors by crouching over and over. Like why I use Wraith (so I can ring bell over and over).
---
yup, I got downed a bit later and I was left behind by the other two without hesitation. :(
---
That's why I always wait with the cleanse until someone gets hit (unless I know they 100% have ruin)
---
Yet I get mori'd or they camp the 2nd to last survivor to be hooked when I try to save them.
---
Downvote cause stolen
---
It'll be ok to ban for deranking as soon as I can enjoybl the game again at high ranks and not have to play at my very best to avoid being called trash and to end my own suffering already.

I randomly turned around while doing a gen not knowing who the killer was and ghost face was just watching me!!! Waiting!!! That was the most scared I’ve been while playing so far ;_;

nice name

Pallets barely slow you down if you pre-rev when they're about to drop it

Idc about rank. It was still bs lol
---
There’s no magic playstyle that fixes how other people play. If you’re not having fun, don’t play.

Favorite: Michael &amp; Nurse

Less Favorite: Hags are cheap and annoying. And lately Huntresses have been really mean and cocky.

Yeah, sometimes you’ll get useless teammates like the person on the left who is not running meta perks

Thanks! I recently got back into the game when I noticed BBQ in the Shrine. Haven’t dealt with any toxicity since then, shockingly.

I hate how ghost face's daily requires you to be leaning

I honestly feel like fixing 1 makes 2 a much smaller issue as some of the design issues are placement and distance of generstors (which can be completed in 44 seconds with 2 survivors lol)
---
I'm more thinking of little crap, no necessarily nerfs but strange calls by the devs; like the EGC nerf to pig, the (currently not final) nerfs to the initial Demogorgon perks, freddy not being able to teleport in the beginning of the game, trapper not having a bag as default, bubba not even having an iridescent add-on, etc.
---
It's getting better but it's a long road ahead
---
But the actual glove is cooler
---
I've ran ebony moris before and never got to use it because of good survivors with good add ons. Not saying Ebony's are ok, but that is someone using an offering. I just want to play a killer and have fun, but there's always the chance of getting on lampkin.
---
im confused at what advice you are looking for
---
don't apologise friend, not everyone wants to or has to stay in the loop of what's happening
---
And takes more effort to draw.
---
I can hear this picture
---
It’s true
---
Full Zap set ⚡️
---
Flashlights are already useless in my opinion as I can hear survivors and I can counter flashlight saves well. I consider lightborn the ugly cousin while shadowborn is 10/10
---
Unfortunately I'm on console so nurse is extremely difficult. Spirit is fine I just don't enjoy that killer.
---
It’s demogorgon and the femur breaker from the SCP universe
---
If your saying you should main LF after getting 1 4k with him?
---
My answer is hell no those survivors most have been braindead AF to die by LF
---
NOT RIGHT?
---
Not toxic,  in fact it makes you lose distance on the killer more often than not, but hey I respect the grind and I know you want those juicy boldness points
---
this offends me, i don't camp :(
---
Isn't that from ' Scary Movie '?
---
It was a splinter too lol
---
Thats even worse
---
Because IMO LF is one of the worst killers just above wraith
---
BHVR is kinda shit at both system building and admitting when they've done something stupid. 
---
So rather than addressing the elephant in the room and correcting a clear error - they've doubled down and call it a feature.
---
I'm on console too so I understand the pain. Everytime I play Billy and get that map I DC tho cuz it's just not fun and why would I play something that isn't fun.
---
Ahhh ok ao thats why prove thyself was the only one going off since it affects gens. Thanks didnt read that sadly lol
---
that is rng for you dc just because you get something you do not like is the same as a survivor for dc when they get a killer they do not like
---
Camping makes you more skilled you noob.
---
I think wraith is better tbh but yea that's console for you smh
---
Its always fucking rank 2s

He just wanted to take a look, it's not that bad

i mean for 1 win we did not see the match we cannot really say anything
---
I think the release will be next week, the 17th, 2 weeks from the ptb but idk
---
Exactly! I enjoy playing leatherface a lot, but he is soooo bad on that map do to the small corridors and multiple buildings. The only time I seem to do well on that map is when I resort to extremely scummy tactics. Which is equally unfun and boring. Would rather DC and give everyone a better game in 5 minutes.
---
Gonna have to seriously disagree with you there. He’s traded his aura reading for insane map pressure, and it’s miles better. Freddy’s power used to be having to wait seven seconds to hit someone. It was terribly frustrating. 
---
New Freddy with BBQ and Pop Goes the Weasel is a nightmare
---
Did you try him pre rework lol? It was painful to try to play that. Get what you mean tho about him not being fun. Maybe try tea bagging with ghost face it's kind entertaining all the DCs I can get
---
I hope so! I just wanna pounce 😭
---
Man, if only there were some kind of on-screen notification to let the Baby Dwight know that you have We'll Make It...
---
Oh well maybe someday
---
Hope it doesnt suck for killers
---
I can hear both of these image and I don't like it
---
Honestly stupid item since it denies both killer and survivors of pip potential. You basically only run it to ruin the game for others and yourself.
---
This is how you know you captured the soul of a killer perfectly in your game, where merely standing there can make someone jump!
---
This is a "Rules for killers as written by survivors" rule that I can stand behind.

I'm leveling Nancy for her perks and will likely never play her. She has better perks, but Steve is the man. He's where it's really at.

wow, the way he swings his weapon in game is incredibly accurate to this

It's so hard to try and play seriously as Ghostface.
---
Sniff...Yes...

Oh Jesus gross.

---
PTB ends on Wednesday, just a heads-up!
---
I know, twitter told me!
---
Before I watch the video I will just say after watching all good gameplay and playing him myself he’s not best killer he’s high b tier low a tier at the moment because his shred ability is great for getting early one hit kills but it can be countered by A. using lockers B. Vaulting C. Juking. He does have good map control  with portals but not as good as someone like Freddy who can put dream snares down and constantly be on survivors. Demogorgan portals can be destroyed and he can still be looped unlike nurse or spirit and it does get difficult for him to go against things like dead hard or balanced landing because after that shred ability is used he’s a m1 killer with portals, so overall he’s a great killer i think but not the best or top tier I hope they don’t nerf or buff him though I like him where’s he at.
---
At this point you need to just make a 1:1 scale of The Game
---
This is great!!
---
If you haven’t seen the parody of DBD on YT you are missing out !
---
Yeah. I flipped my shit when they revealed that Steve is gonna get his scoops.
---
The game honestly sucks once you hit red ranks. It's a constant onslaught of Spirit and ebony mori's. Everyone seems to just hate the game and play to be toxic once their rank turns red.
---
I say it's an onslaught of spirits but I had a weirdly large number of games against trapper today...
---
Flashlights just infuriate me. Just the fact that your dumbass thought you were going to make me drop my slug is beyond annoying. I only got caught once or twice by a flashlight but every other time I just look up

That's almost what he says word for word lmao 😂😂😂

Yeah I totally understand that ppl have their bad days and I get that playing the game everyday can really fuck my mentality up. Though, its sad to see him mostly playing DBD and not take a break. Thank you for being respectful with my comments. Appreciate your approach &lt;3

Doctor counters stealth.

So did old Freddy.

Countering stealth is meaningless if you're dogshit in chases.

I mean farming is against the rules. If we broke it, why give them the courtesy to live?

'Kill one survivor by hand."
---
Use yellow or green Mori, everyone DCs or kills themself on first hook.
---
Give up on that, use Devour Hope, it instantly gets cleansed despite being in a good spawn and the only Hex.

I just play with my team and when the killer has it we just hide until it goes away lol
---
Half of us got it for free, when they were selling it in 2-packs.

I play meg 1/10,000th as many times as I play AAdam, and I play Adam only for dailies. I don't think I have ever had a Meg daily in 2 years.
---
I know for sure in French they use the feminine version of words when talking about the Entity. Since French is spoken by a number of the developers it is likely that they did in house translation since it was a small team at the start.
---
Myers with tombstone
---
The Trapper change is a little too much. By removing the ability to sabotage the traps he just puts 1 at each gate-lever and guarantees catches.
---
Myers it’s so satisfying to get to tier 3.
---
Let's see.. we got The Pig, The Shape, The Nightmare, The Cannibal, and soon the Demogorgon. I'd say most fun would be the Demogorgon but talking now i'd say the Nightmare. Not only can he be pretty strong but he has a bit of anything in an interesting way. The dreamworld looks awesome, you can place snares or switch them to dreampallets with an add on, you can teleport... i'd say he is out of all licensed characters the strongest right now and he's pretty fun aswell. ALSO there is a sale right now on humblebundle i think where you can get 50% the dlc.
---
Whenever I do this, the killer just chases me immediately...
---
Probably Freddy
---
I thought at first you'll rant about killer and how you'll uninstall the game. I would relate to that. Killer at low purple ranks is disgusting. I feel that if you play any other killer that's not top tier, you're gonna regret it 7/10 trials. Most of the times there's going to be SWF groups and if not, they are so skilled, a mid tier killer has no chance and not necessarily because of the player's skill but because of the killer's weak/imbalanced power. Reaching 20 killers in DBD to choose from and it's pointless, cause only 3-4 are viable at low ranks.
---
The game needs secondary objectives for sure and hopefully instead of bringing all these new killers, actually boost those that you already have and make them have a purpose in this game. It's sickening to go against Spirit and Billy all the time. It's sickening to see the power side of the game, the killer, literally mocked and just a joke (spamming flashlight, body-blocking at every downed survivor, chasing around to blind you or stun at every pick up) to survivors. I understand those strategies when it happens to be around, fair enough, but to actually follow the killer all 4 the entire map to do that...no words.
---
As a survivor I don't give a rat's ass anymore cause as stated above you pretty much can pee all over the killers and I feel absolutely bad for doing it. I sometimes let myself die so the killers wouldn't quit the game. I know their frustration. I do play sometimes with potatoes but I try to let it go even if I die first hook.
---
My advice: look for your actual skill rank and stay there.
---
Nurse will always be the best killer in the game and there will never ever be a better killer than the Nurse and thats a fact
---
How can I play this game? It seems really fun!
---
He's saying your meme has potential to make it into hot, aka popular status
---
Those games, where 1 or 2 players are the children of ghosts and ninjas, so all you do is alternate hooking the others, until all that's left is a 20 minute game of hide and seek.
---
Ohhhh I see, lol I didn’t know that😂😂
---
She tunneled earlier in the match.
---
That's just flat out wrong lol.
---
Disarming a trap and sabotaging it are two different things entirely.
---
It's nice to know he'll always be the king. Ghostface peeking doesn't really match the sheer spook of Myers just standing and staring.
---
The only thing that comes close is when you think pig is a survivor before she roars. The deception hurts.

---
That some dedication right there, and is it just me or with the bloody cosmetics, do it look even more like a rashy testicle.
---
Yeah I figured that would get hate but I'm just trying to give an unbiased look at his power. It's situational and hard to use consistently and quite frankly, camping is pretty inherent in his design. Using his power to camp hooks is free and easy and will consistently net you kills if you have no shame about it. Like, his power even hard counters Borrowed Time so you can mark the rescuer, down them and then farm the unhooked person for free. Using his power to pressure gens and mindgame loops actually takes skill, but there's obviously a lot more room for error. That's why PTB Ghostface was nothing but proxy campers or Ghostfaces getting stomped. People were bad with him (and there were bugs preventing you from using his power correctly) and that was the easiest, most consistent way to actually expose people. 
---
I'm not saying hide around the corner everytime you get a hook because not only is that a bad strategy, it makes you a douche of a killer. But if you have most of the gens on one side of the map and you get a hook in the corner, it's worth considering giving up gen pressure in order to leverage the survivors having to approach you. He's a momentum based killer, just like Meyers. If you can't get quick downs and snowball with him, odds are you don't down fast enough to stop the gens.
---
Basically a boring strategy that allows one to have more pressure then usually, unfortunately this comes at the expense of the caught survivor's rank(killers too if survs are good) as normally he gets 2 hooked instantly at the start.
---
You gotta understand that if a team is good on gens&amp;looping they can always win,
---
This is also why higher rank players usually loose to camping and actually cause it not knowingly, the killers there know they can wait by the hook because higher rank teams are worse on gens and are a lot more altruistic which basically means they are always ready to get hook rescues.
---
From my experience (in high ranks) there's never more than 1 person on a gen which is very killer sided as it means hes juggling 3 people (while 1 is hooked) and the 4th one is free to do what he wants.
---
Disagree on the Hag needing more as last I knew she actually owned the highest kill rate of any killer.
---
Trapper should still be able to step in his own trap and survivors should still be able to DH over them. Strong agree on giving him his traps at the start and fixing the aura of his traps to be more visible. Disagree on removing the sabotage action, wouldn't be opposed to speeding up the respawn on them though as having survivors not doing gens helps him more than it hurts him (imo).
---
With Clown I think his bottles are fine as is, but he does have a serious map control problem that i'm unsure of how to fix. Maybe buffing some of his numbers fixes this, but I would have to see it to have a full opinion on it.
---
A lot of these are actually number changes like with Wraith and Cannibal. It would be cool to see them tinker with the numbers on the lower end killers once in awhile in a PTB just to see how much of a difference it would make as spitting out numbers isn't really enough for me to know if its good, not enough, or overboard.
---
Legion was just a terrible idea from the beginning. We already had a perk at the time that was fairly inconsistent thanks to it being based around being in a chase (lithe) and then they decided to make a killer's power work off of that inconsistent mechanic. I'm glad the days of moon walking, lunge spamming, infinite mending, or throwing on bloodhound and looking down are over, but it would be nice to give a complete rework here.
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts, I love these types of discussion.
---
Oink Mistress.

Freddy is really fun
---
This is why I use bond
---
Assuming DBD came out the past week, I could say that every survivor has his own role, rather than "the best"...Dwight gens, meg the runner (the basic characters) but yeah, after this many chapters I couldnt know what roles  would be Adam, or Ash, that would mean that they start to branch like...some survivors could "multitask"
---
You telling me they didn't meme on the killer with sabo builds?
---
This is hilarious
---
Tbh if by fun you mean you just wanna goof around then Ghostface, if you wanna win every game then Freddy, if you want to torment survs then Myers and if you wanna join a cult then Saw's piggy
---
When I play solo I gotta use borrowed XD and just HOPE that the rando can be smart and use it to take a hit for me while they escape XD
---
That good user name
---
I'd like to believe it puts more pressure but if there is a say pretty high rank team playing most of then won't go for the un hook and would rather do gens at least in my experience. tbh I'm more of a gen jockey rather than a looper but when I get caught it's always camping and tunneling. I also forgot to add I play on consle so people's connection also is worse causing looping to be even harder. I just think there should be some type of punishment because I've seen some amazing killers who never camped nor tunneled and they get 4ks, if there a good killer they won't need to camp or tunnel I feel like it's just a cheap way to win and should have some type of punishment for it. Because it takes away all the enjoyment especially when I'm waiting in que for 20min just to be tunneled and camped.

Tbf that timeline isn’t even canon anymore. The creators said they made it up because they were pressured by studios. In the 2018 sequel they actively mock it.

You mean you don't care about feeding your man period blood just to get you off. Ew

Think of player level as overall experience. They are close because you both have played about as much as each other. Nothing to worry about.

Personally, whenever I get into red ranks as killer, the calibur of survivor goes up so high that I feel compelled to be sweaty. There are only a few killers that I can play that I feel I can even get a 3-4k with.  
---
There was some good advice I'm going to follow the next time I get into red ranks, though.  
---
Which is to just meme around with whatever killer you want, try silly builds, and make sure you're having fun. Be sweaty every once in a while, but don't forget to have fun.

I'm specifically talking about the glitch where the Survivor would hit the Skill Check, Decisive Strike would trigger, the Stun timer for Decisive Strike would appear on the Killer's HUD, but nothing would happen if the Killer happened to be in a stun/recovery animation (f.e. after swinging, which was easier with hitting an object, because that increases the duration of the recovery) already.
---
The most frustrating part of the glitch was that it wouid actually use up Decisive Strike 'because it triggered'.

Wraith has good add-ons already. His base power holds him back

And the fix is so easy, just match around highest rank. If you want to introduce your new friend to the game, fine, but you carry him then.
---
OhTofu and Aaron plays are pretty good at loops so look at gameplay and how they run loops and OhTofu has a looping guide I believe. It's more so practicing then watching videos to get good at looping. I'll just give some tips, run around the pallet tightly to keep distance, learn the killers Abilities and best ways to counter them and dont throw down pallets instantly loop them for awhile m
---
It’s like a good huntress though
---
 GF main, not the best but I play high purple on PC with him. Just wanted to pitch in on that killer specifically:
---
* Fixed a bug causing Ghostface to be flagged as "being spotted" for 0.3 seconds after he ducks behind cover.
---
&gt;Please and thank you. I feel this will only be exasperated by dedicated servers. Though, honestly, they may have put it in to make it easier to mark him with the latency difference so hopefully this is already on their roadmap. They also need to fix marking him in general though, or at least explain how it's supposed to work if they're doing something weird like using the survivor model's LOS not the player's camera.
---
* Fixed a bug that made it impossible to Spot Ghostface through the non-mossy spots on the Chain Link Fences in Badham Preschool.
---
&gt;Yup. Should be the same rules as GF marking survs.
---
* Any marks you place will not have their timers begin until you leave Night Shroud.
---
&gt;This actually lowers the skill ceiling while raising the floor and doesn't really do anything to his tier at all. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the way to do this currently is to *commit* to it, and just start chasing them at 99% and mark them just before your shroud breaks.
---
* Re-entering Night Shroud will not pause timers that have already begun, this simply gives Ghostface more time to trigger his placed marks if he can stay in Night Shroud.
---
&gt;Needed if the above change was accepted, ofc.
---
* Striking a partially marked survivor no longer removes Mark progress.
---
&gt;I'm on the fence about this. It would certainly make him higher tier, but in a way that just raises his skill floor. It also removes an option of survivor counterplay and makes playing against him have a lower skill ceiling.  
---
&gt;I of course prefer options that raise skill ceilings, and I especially am wary of things that raise floors because of the effect it has in low rank. It would be nice if killers all had higher skill ceilings (and sometimes lower floors) so that you start out at rank 20 not getting 4ks every game for playing poorly and you can learn your way all the way to rank 1.  
---
&gt;I have my reservations, but this could be an option to raise his tier, one way or another.
---
* Changed Ghostface's daily from "Stab 3 marked survivors that you marked while leaning" to "Stab 3 marked survivors".
---
&gt;Obligatory.
---
* Night Shroud Cooldown decreased from 30 seconds to 12.
---
&gt;First off, I do not think this should be combined with the "hits no longer remove mark progress" idea. This would hardly reward survivors at all for going out of their way, maybe losing distance, to reveal GF. It buys them 12 seconds before gaining more exposed, sure, but he can be a regular M1 in the meantime *and lose nothing for it*. He will just take advantage of the lower distance gap for a shorter chase, keep all his exposed progress for after you unhook, and cash in on it later. You've extended your original chase but shortened the next one.  
---
&gt;Moving forward assuming this is NOT combined with the other change, I think we need to middle ground here. Revealing GF needs to be counterplay. It needs to be long enough that it doesn't work out for him to just wait it out while chasing. GF could just feign going for a regular 2-hit kill, but deliberately make some mistakes and keep the distance short but never quite closing in. Then he could pop shroud after 12 seconds and lean for the win, if they're not already at 99%.  
---
&gt;Maybe 12 seconds with mox CD addons, but I think this is too extreme for basline. On the other hand, 30 seconds feels too high if you put it next to genspeed. So I am for lowering it, but this is a bit too extreme, IMO.
---
* Ghostface no longer needs to be in Night Shroud to lean around Corners.
---
&gt;I think this would be good. This could punish survivors that aren't paying enough attention by zoning them during chases and making them leave gens. It would combo with M&amp;A and Furtive for some fake-out GF. Not sure it'd be meta and I don't think it'd help his tier much but anything that increases the skill cap on both ends, even very slightly, is a good change in my opinion.
---
* Ghostface gains the *undetectable* status while in Night Shroud.
---
&gt;I had always assumed this was coming anyway. The devs didn't specifically name GF but said something about adding it to previous killers, which would be GF and Pig. Much needed nurf to OoO, which completely obliterates stealth killers and is a relic from a time when there weren't any except Myers, who had an exemption put in for himself.
---
I did look at your other killer suggestions as well and I am very impressed. They all seem very good for the most part and well thought out so I didn't feel at all qualified to say anything about them. Excellent discussion thread, sir.
---
Maybe working on the dedicated servers since they're still not ready.
---
I'm definitely doing this with all my survivors vs Ghostface with mori now lmao
---
&gt;Most people in Quebec have VERY bad english.
---
You can clearly hear that in some dev streams.
---
You just experienced the baby Dwight preservation movement.
---
For me it's the opposite. It's usually the moment a Bubba sees a survivor, bam, time to run them for 6 gens. How 6? Exactly!
---
hooked? you okay there buddy?
---
Is this rank 20? This is the dumbest shit I’ve ever seen to think it’s even upvoted
---
Make it zap someone on contact like those hand buzzer toys
---
As a killer main, I wish I saw this more. So many people get under pallets when downed but almost no one ever takes advantage. I get it though, it's usually better to stay on gens unless you happen to be like 2ft away.
---
There's also the Leatherface DLC which came without a survivor :)
---
I think the roar is scarier
---
Legendary photo incoming

r/uselessnobody
---
These jukes cured my gingivitis!
---
A mod, like for this subreddit?
---
TrU3Ta1ent is who I watched to get better at survivors he does random survivors and random perks and explains what's the strengths and weaknesses of each. He also goes over mistakes other player do
---
This reminds me of Smoker from L4D
---
And you know, that means SFWs can come and save the Survivors, and in case of good Survivors they can quickly save a pulled Survivors.
---
This needs a cleaned idea to implement, else it can be too good or too weak.
---
The flashlights blinds with controller, mad respect
---
Lmao stalking while carrying a survivor? I wish
---
Me wife only plays the switch. And I'm excited for this to release on the switch just so I can watch her freak out in these moments. Cant wait.
---
He might’ve had a key also
---
r/dbdgonewild ?
---
Haha it’s tempting to post it there
---
Feel like it’s not steamy enough though
---
His name isn't Drew!
---
I've been having a blast with GhostFace last day. Literally well over 10 games in a row I had 3-4 kills. Just activate the power and roam around, when getting spotted look where from and you found someone, plus you can stalk someone and later just press M2 once on them and get a free kill.
---
Problem is BHVR doesn't use the steam ID or any other unique Identifier In-Game. Therefore same names cause weird glitches on the survivor display (bottom left on the UI). Mostly messing up Hooking stages such as a survivor is shown without progress bar on Hook and stuff like that.
---
Some people use this on purpose.
---
Demogorgeous
---
You could certainly post it and see what happens, how you frame it is up to yourself. Good luck.
---
With that perk you can face your problems.. head on
---
No official date yet
---
Eh, I think you're missing the strengths and weaknesses of almost all of those survivor perks.
---
Iron Will &amp; Calm Spirit - Sure they negate downsides to various things, but they're weak as fuck. Iron will doesn't hide your blood at all, meaning that at best you can get a cheeky play on a killer on Macmillan. And Calm Spirit not setting off crows is such a non-issue that I genuinely can't see how that perk benefits survivors in like any way.
---
Quick and Quiet - The fuck? "A free out to the notification if you have to fast action, which is only something you have to do if you fucked up"? Survivors doing a fast vault is only something they have to do if they fucked up? Getting in a locker at jank times to activate head on is the survivor fucking up? Quick and Quiet is good, but it only works well if the survivor actively plays with it, it's by no means "a free out" if they fuck up. That would be Dead Hard.
---
Decisive Strike - Yeah this one should be changed, at least it sorta prevents tunneling? The issue is that the survivors don't really do anything to earn Decisive besides for play like shit and get downed pretty much.
---
Adrenaline - Yeah, this perk is super demoralizing, but it's something that survivors have to earn. Getting all 5 gens done is their goal, and they have to work to it in order to get one health state and sprinto bursto. I would agree with nerfing this perk, if not for the fact that it's something that survivors have to earn.
---
NOED - Well, the issue with this one, is that it rewards killers for playing like shit. Sure, there's some times where if you're playing wraith or pig without ruin, all 5 gens popping is kind of inevitability, but most of the time, realistically, the perk just activates because you're losing. What do killers have to do to get noed activated? Literally just play like shit. There's no pre-set condition for the killers to work towards, no goal for them to achieve to activate NOED. It's literally just "when do bad get 1 hit free".
---
In terms of counterplay, "cleansing totems" isn't it chief. This perk is shit. You achieve the conditions for using it by playing like shit. And suggesting that survivors cleanse all dull totems in order to counter a perk that's only run like 2-5% of the time is shit.
---
Also, I can guarantee that you cannot stealth a good killer. Between all the perks that reveal survivor locations like Discordance and BBQ, running stealth on survivor only works against bad killers, or if you're MathMan200.
---
And that mindset leads to your death. "Im not going to cleanse dull totems just because i dont want to waste time on a game changer for the killer"  The perk is balanced. It has a counter. Thats why its a HEX not an actual ability. 
---
&gt;Also, you can't tell how many totems were cleansed in solos
---
No shit. But you can see someone else is also cleasing totems if you see a cleansed totem. It doesnt stop you from probably cleansing all of them now does it? 
---
&gt;When the killer is doing well the last thing survivors should focus are the dull totems.
---
Thats why its the first thing survivors focus on.
---
bad killers feel bad when they get called out for using bad perks
---
So Pennywise is a she not an It. The world shall know
---
There are skilled and unskilled players, there are no other types.Sometimes good players predict incorrectly and it backfires, sometimes bad player tries to play safe and it backfires. The idea of reactionary/predictionary/hybrid specific player types is laughable.
---
What's a gen? Why are we not trying to escape?
---
-Baby Megs
---
imo
---
Nancy, Nancy, Steve, depends on the player that plays them (also Nancy is loud af and i don't think it's worth it, even tho i'm gonna main her)
---
Thank you for the criticisms, I do appreciate it and realized that Covered Wars can be pretty OP lmao. I've put some changes on it. Let me know if they make it a bit more fair!
---
&gt; In terms of counterplay, "cleansing totems" isn't it chief.
---
It. Is. Literally. THE. ONLY. Counterplay. 
---
I can't tell you how many times me and my SWF group have intentionally found all the totems (usually quite quickly) then focused on gens, gotten them done, escaped, and get to the stat screen and find out the Killer had NOED and then laugh our asses off thinking about their likely reactions when they hit one of us at the end. 
---
As for "cannot stealth a good killer", are you for real? So you're saying all those times I've Urbaned around some boxes as the Killer goes by, where they literally cannot see me - that was just them "not being good". Come on.
---
It looks to me like the first 2 perks will not be used that often, especially the first one, the last one though looks like a good one! Combine it with borrowed time and camping killers are no more!
---
You too, my little passive-agressive survivor
---
How to know the killer has noed:
---
Does he suck?
---
Yes? He has noed 100% of the time
---
No? He has noed 15% of the time
---
I have seen this before and clipped it. It happened when a friend was healing me on the side of map beside a tree. The game lagged and boom he is on other side of wall. He tried running a round but then it said he escaped. Was not repeatable.
---
Hey better then it being delayed(which it most likely won't as it would kill hype)
---
You deserve more awards than that.
---
“If someone is messin’ with your fly girl, give em one of these”

---
I'm gonna need you to step to the side for a moment so we can talk about your username..
---
I'm a killer main
---
What's the mask on the second shelf? (under myers mask).
---
They attempted to stun you with dwight on your shoulders which would have caused you to drop him instantly but they got the timing wrong and messed it up.
---
You hear his steps followed by his heavy breathing from 0:01 - 0:03
---
When using dead hard look at the killer when you see his swing animation start use dead hard
---
I like to play both sides equal a butt getting 0 kills as a killer is something you would have to try to do. Either that or you're new to the game and getting bullied by survive with friends or high rank sub using the rank system. 
---
My friend was complaining about this so I made an ALT account. Rank 20 perkless freddy(pre rework). If they were noobs I would let them Escape. If they were hardcore players I would try to kill them. I had three rank 2s and a rank 20. The rank 20 had an account that was one day old. They also trash talked in the post game chat. No need to ask by the way. I killed two of them but they still felt the need to bm.
---
Disclaimer: I'm terrible at being a killer and I know it. I'm trying to get better but it's stressful so I don't do it often.
---
That being said... tonight I had a match where this one guy kept teabagging at me. Once he tried doing it to bait me into coming in the way of a pallet, but instead, I lunged at him. I got hit but so did he. So I hooked him pretty easily and nobody came to save him. Long story short, I somehow managed to get 4/4, and then the guy called me "low-level trash" in the chat at the end. 
---
I replied with, "Sorry :-) I'll try harder next time"
---
... Brenda?
---
Leather face by far is the most fun for me. Nothing beats insidious camping in the basement and clapping a survivors unsuspecting cheeks.  It’s only always a bonus when they tilt and tell me how bad I am. Good times.
---
Killer instinct shows the location of survivors near the portal, not just when sealing it
---
The thing with ghostface is he is staking them to find the part of them where hitting is going to hurt the most or Insta down or at least that's what I thought
---
Pretty sure this was posted a few hours ago.
---
I like being killer in red ranks, the games are tense and fun when they’re so close. Only annoying thing is that a lot of survivors use keys in SWF. Being survivor in red ranks is awful though due to the amount of moris. If the devs removed moris (atleast ebony ones, or made it a different activation condition) and keys, the game would be so much better at high ranks.
---
I thought the Netflix one was pretty awful TBH
---
BHVR: We've added in a feature for ghost faces Mori pictures to be saved.  
---
Also BHVR: We are aware of a bug where using the Mori will cause an instant crash.
---
You are just allowing them to take an extra a loop though, smart survivors will abuse that. Of course it works sometimes but it’s just better to take the pallet imo.
---
Dunno. I said he never pretended to be actively hunting them, he was letting them unhook in front of him directly.
---
Anyway, he got back to me and told me he got into a match with a Freddy who let him and his friend farm, then get downed his friend because he realized they were rank 1s who don’t need to pop.
---
Hoes mad x24
---
Same can be said for killers who run bbq and ruin all the time. I dont have a problem with those perks but they are meta.
---
You don’t need to rank up anymore xD
---
What do they do to mock it in the 2018 version?
---
Bad wording on "counter play." I meant that it's a really fucking boring way to counter noed. And of course you can stealth killers. It's just not a good way to consistently get all 5 gens/survive.
---
But I can type faster with a controller then keyboard
---
wasnt this posted yesterday?
---
just report it for spam
---
IIRC someone says something like "Wasn't Laurie actually his sister?" and someone replies that it was just a myth
---
This issue is making me not want to play killer cause I'm just getting bullied by rank 2s I'm only rank 15 killer also makes it impossible to rank up lol
---
Does falling from really high up alert the killer?
---
You can hear his breathing even before you looked at him :P
---
Turning around just in time to catch the Demogorgon lunging at you is up there imo. Fucker almost made my heart stop because the chase music was bugged out so I didn't know he was following me.
---
Is the Huntress an absolute speed demon all of a sudden? She has NOED 115%
---
Thanks :D
---
Yeah in order for NOED to be usefull they should change it to it activates when all totems are gone.
---
If they’re close enough they can hear you grunt as you hit the ground.
---
The Druid (or any of the slashers) from Slasher
---
*claps* BRAVO BRAVO
---
Happy Cakeday buddy!
---
TBH? I've got over 1000 hrs in the game. Mostly survivor grinding BPs and dumping them all into killer once I got all the good survivor perks. 
---
My problem mainly is chasing? I lose survivors so easy, as soon as they break LOS I lose them. Esp after a hit. Double so if the map/survivor colors are just so bland they blend in. It's a bit of a vision thing, but more than that.
---
Not actually sure. It's been a popular format on r/memes for a few days.
---
This wasn't necessarily staying around to tunnel though.
---
There's 13 seconds between Ghostface leaving and Bill unhooking himself.
---
It takes 12 seconds from Bill unhooking himself for him to unhook Adam and reach the top of stairs.
---
This is a classic example of unhooking or attempting to unhook too soon, if it takes the survivor about/as long to leave the area (12 seconds) as it takes the Killer to return (13 seconds) then the survivor fucked up.
---
Ghostface could have ran away in a straight line for 13 seconds and turned back around after the unhook notification and still gotten there in time to hit Bill via a lunge.
---
Footsteps and breathing
---
A Dweet in need is a friend indeed!
---
Showing someone else's face without their consent is kinda creepy though.
---
Disgustang!
---
On the bright side op, you are a king ! LOOOOONG LIFE THE KING !
---
After looking at your post and comment history I don’t think they’d let you
---
Ikr, im on ps4 so cant message them post game to thank them 😭
---
Scary, but not the scariest jump scare. That honour goes to a gen grabbing prayer bead spirit.
---
Understood. Thank you! I only have 2 loadout slots right now so I’m sure that will help lol. I see so many people taking their load outs so seriously, I just want to make sure I’m not wasting my time trying to get through a game.
---
Instant buy 💰
---
Would you be ok with your picture becoming a meme without even knowing it because you had the audacity to use social medias in the 21st century? There's a huge difference between posting a profile picture on one's own profile, and having people sharing this picture on the internet "because it's funny".
---
Hint: one is perfectly normal, the other isn't.
---
Great idea
---
Yeah people using run the meta builds, just try what works for you :)
---
But all I’m saying is he’s putting himself out there on the internet to have that a possibility.
---
I really like surveillance on him
---
Oh god...
---
Oh yeah, he provoked it. When you laugh about someone without that person knowing, this isn't a joke. FYI. Have a good day.
---
Hey I didn’t say I stood up for it, I was just stating my point. You have a good day too.
---
Or the jeff/meg cosmetic?
---
Genuine question, how can "gg" be considered rude?
---
Been saying GG for a quite a long time now, and have honestly never had someone accuse me of being rude by saying it.
---
When you sprint you leave scratchmarks behind, multiple small orange red lines that act like a trail to show the killer where you went.
---
Also, don’t panic too often. Attempt to formulate a plan as you make your way silently (walking or crouching) to a place you can hide if killer is coming. unless you know you won’t be able to avoid a chase, this will be of great use.
---
In the start of a match, don’t immediately do a gen, sometimes the killer spawns nearby and if he notices the nearby generator had been worked on (the bumping and thumping sounds of it working) then they knows a survivor must have been nearby as of recent.
---
If you vault over something while sprinting, the killer gets a visual and audio cue telling them, regardless of where the killer is on the map, where you just vaulted.
---
Failing a skillcheck on a generator will make it explode, alerting the killer like when you sprint vault
---
You can vault over dropped pallets, but you should never drop pallets the moment you find them. Use them when in a chase to stagger the killer just before they hit you, or if you know they’re not close enough to reach you yet, try to loop them around that pallet. At this point, it’s all about loop mindgames. What will you do? What will they do? You want to make sure you can reach the pallet before they can hit you when trying to loop a killer.
---
Vaulting has 3 speeds. Fast, medium, slow. Fast is when you sprint directly into a window at a realistic angle to vault it, quickly letting you vault. Medium vault is when you do it from an unrealistic angle, so you don’t get as much momentum. Slow is when you aren’t sprint but rather crouching or walking to the window.
---
Same here. I love the rank reset because it is more pure and way less meta. Sometimes I just want to fuck around with Deja Vu or Beast of Prey and casually play for shits and giggles.
---
Quentin 😫❤️ Myers is my fav killer, just because of the jumpscares like these
---
Every time an adrenaline goes off in the middle of the chase, part of me dies inside. Yes I am killer main.
---
Apparently my headset sucks because I hear nothing like that :(
---
I still find Myers scarier than Ghostface
---
This. I literally screenshot this. This will directly impact my gameplay and was exactly what I was looking for. Thank you, I mainly just needed a strategy for basic gameplay as a survivor. This helps a fuck ton. Everything else is appreciated, but at the level I’m at, this is what I needed. Thanks lol, very much appreciated
---
Don't they give you more points if you kill after hooking someone for the second time? I usually do that and it makes the match play a lot better than the usual DC fest that is bringing an ebony.
---
Its a mask i found online
---

I love this perk! It's pathetic, bad, and fanny perk!:D
---
Me running away after throwing a pallet
---
How is this nsfw?
---
Why’s is nsfw?
---
I'm saying that calling p3 Claudette "a certain character with certain cosmetics" is rather dismissive of the actual reason people choose to mori them: the skin gives a player an in-game advantage over every other skin in the game, it's annoying to play against, *and that is the exact reason why those players are using the skin*.
---
I don't mori them myself (cause I don't have enough moris), but I think they deserve what they get. Reap what you sow.
---
Go play some Civilization my dude.
---
Not sure, my fiance's friend bought them for her birthday, I'll let ya know when i find out.
---
Can someone explain this meme to me?
---
Millions of Americans suffer every year.
---
trapper
---
They'll have to make lot more trophies
---
&gt; Mostly survivor grinding BPs
---
But this is way easier as Killer.
---
Mistakeeee
---
I would up vote but ur at 69 don't wanna ruin that for u
---
I hope dedicated servers will have an option to join SWF free matches. I am a 13 and have an 18, 15 bringing along their rank 5 and lower friends to join the match. How is this considered match making when people can essentially form the team I go against?
---
Yeah but if you run something like premonition or spine chill it isn’t bad
---
I would do everything he said but one thing. At the beginning of a game do a gen(Searching a nearby chest is also ok). If the killer finds you, you should learn to Have a good chase to waste his time.  when the killer is on you, that means he's not interupting other people doing generators.
---
(This is pretty advanced so don't worry about it right now) While you are on that first gen, try to identify what killer you are facing and what perks they have. This will make late game a lot easier.
---
 Sprinting in or out of a locker will notify killer. 
---
Fast vaulting a window 3 times will block it off making it unusable for you for a short time. 
---
To learn how to loop, I suggest watching entertainment streamers or YouTubers instead of information ones. Information ones care too much about teaching, and entertainment ones do it naturaly and you can copy what they are doing. Looping is When you run around the same car or debree while the killer is chasing you and then when they are about to catch up, you Throw the pallet down. 
---
So general advice: always be doing something beneficial to your team. Wether it's a hook, save, gen, Distraction, heal etc. It's a good thing. Never just hide in a corner for 10 hours when the killer isn't near. 
---
And that's some of my game sense to you! Have fun and Good luck! See you in the fog!
---
Hopefully next week... Bit i think Last September week
---
the Senate will decide your fate
---
What is this thread? All three seasons of the Scream series was produced by MTV.
---
That’ll never happen. Most killers would avoid, making it hard for SWF to fond games, they stop playing, making it hard to find games.
---
I hope it will be release next week. Don't think they have any reason to keep it till the end of September
---
Adrenaline, DS, BT, unbreakable, infinites with balance, keys, instaheals but waaaahhhh i can't cleanse dull totems for 15 seconds waaaahhhh NOeD bad
---
I’m crying this is absolutely perfect
---
They get a 625 point quitter bonus, so yes it is essentially already a thing
---
When Inner stength come out I'll start use Haunted Graonds.
---
I can beat it: once as spirit I phased with a claudette opening a door just outside of my terror radius, and I timed the uncloak just right so I grabbed her as soon as I appeared behjnd her. I know I made her shit a little bit.
---
Yeah but at the same time he kinda looks like a survivor with a mask
---
That's not the reason it reads "The Entity herself" there. The devs also spoke of her as a female entity when talking English.
---
I know it is, but see: bad at killer. Doesn’t matter of killers get more BP if you aren’t getting downs. Also I just hated looking stupid. Gg ez gives me a sad. 
---
My logic was if I have the crutch perks at tut 3, I’d have an edge.  I always am running Nurses and M&amp;A on most. (M&amp;A because it really does let me consistently get a jump on survivors).
---
Well of course the most spiteful thing in existence is a female
---
Myers acting like a douche-nugget, even opening the gates and all in an attempt to assert dominance.
---
Farm those BP. You can have up to a million ready to drop.
---
When you see him and its too late and you already hear the tier 3 music playing
---
The part of the community we don't talk about.
---
I haven’t laughed at a dbd meme in a while, this was amazinf
---
Avoid picking up a stealthy immerse playstyle in the beginning because it will greatly hinder your ability to actively practice the most important aspect of gameplay aka the chase. Therefore avoid the perks that promote this playstyle in the beginning (most notoriously Urban Evasion) and pick them up later if you'd like. Definitely get familiar with exhaustion perks and choose which one you like the most and include that one in your general build (Sprint Burst - kind of annoying to play around but is reliable and leaves  minor counterplay for the killer,  Balanced Landing - situational and can be absolutely useless on a select few maps but is extremely strong due to also having a passive effect and  you can make sure to only use it when you need it unlike Sprint Burst, Lithe - I don't have this one, but I guess it's also situationally strong, Dead Hard - this is the most popular choice among high rank survivors because you can theoretically always use it during a chase but this ones leaves the most room for the killer to counterplay accordingly especially after they know you have it and it's also technically useless against instadowns, Head On - this one is just for fun builds) I personally use Balanced Landing as of now. Watch videos on youtube that get you familiar with basic looping, pallet looping and the tiles that can spawn on maps.

You just said I would ruin the fundemental mechanics of the game when that is the actual problem. They want it all to be the same but have characters of different sizes and they dont match up to the hitbox that is a BASE to all killer attacks.
---
You either tweak them to fit or you make them all different and actually add more variety and difficulty.
---
You can also make shorter killers have shorter cooldowns on lunges if theirs is gonna have less range
---
Lol no sarcasm, I’m down for a perk like that to add into the arsenal, imagine running past a locker and the killer is right behind you and all of ah sudden “WHACK” locker door to the face, that knocks the killer on his ass!
---
“Open up a locker door” I’m sure they know Head On exists but imagine slamming a door during a chase? Would be hard to do considering most lockers aren’t placed like that but would be hilarious
---

*shirtless daddy Myers talk intensifies*
---
They gotta do sum bout that🤦🏻‍♂️ and it be the games that I actually have good items that they DC
---
Yeah I realized that now after reading it 10 times over lol
---
God I wish I had teammates like you. I get chased and tunneled the whole ass game and they crouchwalk across the entire map and let me die on deathhook even though the killer is already in another chase
---
Savage!
---
Pretty much my thoughts.
---
I've missed this format.
---
Usually I think it’s that someone is behind me keeping an eye on me, rather than my target. It’s also a trick to not have the person I’m chasing break me. I know it’s about bob and weave there. 
---
What addons help chase stalk? I’m decent at Michael so I know how to do it in a chase, but what helps? 
---
Also the Ghostface ritual is BS. Lean to mark a target then down them. That’s some hard shit compared to “hit with power four times”.
---
Or same with bps, and cakes
---
Painteliver makes me so happy! His voice is so deadpan matter of fact! Learned a lot of good killer tips watching him
---
I mean it's only purple
---
You could always use certain tracking perks to help you with following survivors. 
---
A few good options: 
---
Bloodhound: Makes blood **very** bright and visible, when paired with sloppy butcher it’s almost impossible to lose the survivor once they’ve been hit. 
---
Stridor: Injured survivors moan louder, allowing for easier directional location. Very decent if you’re trying to learn the spirit. 
---
Predator: not particularly recommended but it does cause scratch marks to last longer, potentially helping you stay in the chase even if you get confused and go in the wrong direction temporarily. 
---
In the end though, practice makes perfect. As you play more and more, you’ll understand how good Survivors path and be able to predict their movements/hikes depending on what tile they are on or heading towards. 
---
Good luck in the fog!
---
You dont want to know how bad the translation to german is.
---
Is monitor good on the huntress? Shes one of the killers I dont play, but I always figured the song she hums would make monitor pointless
---
No he still can get stunned, but yeah having another way to have fear lowers would be good
---
And they wonder why I use SC
---
Any comment about power/perks/add-ons? I try to make the power to be smoothy but it seems a bit bulky atm.
---
Good survivors usually don't run away in her hum, with M&amp;A she has 12m TR and can trick survivors with that. Jumpscare Huntress.
---
So that's what I hear. No wonder. Good catch.
---
There are a handful of them, I don't recall which ones they are but they're common green quality addons, they're the ones that make people become marked faster when not leaning from cover. 
---
If someone is following you though make sure to take advantage of the reveal marker so you know where they are, Night Shroud is good bait for finding missing survivors because it lets you know when someone is nearby.
---
Spine chill doesn't work on him when he's cloaked!
---
It's funny that Doctor's Perk being shitty on himself
---
They are calling out killers for needing a "crutch" during the point of the game where survivors essentially run out the exit gate. Chances are people will escape if they have been avoiding the killer up to endgame. Ironic how they are telling us that they need their hand to be held because endgame is too scary and that cleansing is inconvenient.
---
Bad on spirit? Can someone elaborate on that? Dropping her already low terror radius is not good?
---
"It was fuckin' one of yous!"
---
Freddy pig and Myers
---
How is M&amp;A good on Billy? Survivors will hear your chainsaw regardless.
---
It makes the woosh on her power more prominent, thereby alerting survivors more often.
---
You bring that with iron will and UE and now you'll be a silent stalker in any state
---
In my personal experience, don’t let anyone guilt you into playing a certain way. I’ve dealt with that my whole playing experience. You play in a way that makes you happy, and take advice where you will.
---
I first started back in 2016 when it first came out, and the game was very different with way less perks, BUT... A perk I couldn’t live without when I was a noob was Premonition. With the amount of stealthy killers out now, the perk is even better. It pushes you to be aware of your surroundings and enhances your ability to hide and evade when the killer is near.
---
My second tip is to not see pallets as disposable. Don’t hop from pallet to pallet, throwing it down the second you’re beside it. Just because YOU are near a pallet doesn’t mean the killer is near you as well. The only time that pallet needs to immediately be thrown down is if the killer is close enough to land a hit.
---
Which brings me to my next time. There is one thing that you absolutely have to learn how to do in order to be a good survivor: always, always look behind you while in a chase. Good killers will mind game you. You’re giving them the advantage by always looking straight ahead. If they can look at you, you should be looking at them.
---
My next tip is mainly for the start of the game, but it applies to mid and late game as well. Always be prepared to deal with a silent killer. Ghost face, pig, michael, wraith. Not all killers will always have a heartbeat. When you’re on a gen, never stop surveying the area around you. Be as observant as possible. Never assume who the killer will be.
---
Another tip is to not always assume the killer has BBQ. That’s a Leatherface perk that can be unlocked. It allows the killers to see survivors after they hook someone for 4 seconds I believe? Maybe more or less. It’s deathly on nurse and hillbilly’s, but a large majority of higher rank killers will have this perk. If you know someone is about to be hooked, try to hide your aura by hopping in a locker or standing behind a gen. It’ll save you from a chase a million times over.
---
My next tip is very important, because it causes many games to go to absolute shit in about 2 minutes: altruism isn’t everything. Just because someone is hooked does not mean you have to stop what you are doing. Gauge whether or not it’s a good time to get that. If they’re hooked far away, don’t waste time running to them; chances are, somebody is closer and already on their way. If not? Them slowly dying on the hook buys you time and keeps the killer distracted. When everyone rushes for a save, the killer will pick up on this, and never leave the hook. This always ends up in a game of musical chairs on the hooks and everyone ends up dying.
---
Another important thing to remember in this game, in my opinion, is selflessness and common sense. If two other survivors are dead, only one gen has been popped, and you’re on the hook? Just let yourself die and let the other person get the hatch. If you don’t do that, then you’ll both end up dying. Remember that it’s their job to look out for themselves as well. We gotta be homies and help out the team. But, this tip is subjective.
---
Something else that is subjective is NOED. It’s a Hex perk that allows the killer to down you in one hit once all the gens have been completed. 9/10 times, if a killer has NOED and then someone gets hooked, just leave. It’s almost never worth it to save them and always results in a lot more people dying than necessary.
---
Another suggestion: Avoid exhaustion perks. This is just my own personal opinion. For me, they become a crutch and weaken my gameplay. Once I take the exhaustion perk(s) off, I become a lost puppy. You won’t always be able to sprint burst or balanced landing your way away from a problem. Learn how to escape without those perks, then have fun with them here and there.
---
Also, this is obvious, but don’t unhook a survivor when a killer is within heartbeat range (unless they’re literally about to die). Play it smart, and don’t screw your teammate over.
---
My last suggestion is this. Don’t let anger build up. It’s a mistake I still make literally every day. The more frustrated you get, the shittier you play. Learn to know your limits, take a step back, and come back to the game later. This can be a very challenging game to learn and it takes a very long time. Patience is practice. Once you master it though, it’s endless fun(:

Gotta love the crutch perk that's basically a get out of jail free card (borrowed time)
---
I can keep going.
---
All perks are crutches. Noed is fine. Stop complaining.
---
I thought the TR appears after 5 seconds, with M&amp;A or not
---
That second point is tricky, it feels like the time to react is so small. They need an addon to extend the time survivors need to break you out.
---
Did you get your name from a song? Also, I just binged one as Trapper and had a blast. Last game 3 survivors got out with a key but I got my blood points so I’m not mad.
---
But it's still bad because you can't shock survivors with your field after revealing yourself. That works at the beginning or with a specific gameplay
---
I would agree but after I tried DbD mobile Identity feels like a dream!

I’d buy it.
---
I am confused about borrowed time and landing in a trap. When a survivor lands in a trap and you hit them (dont pick them up), BT procs and they immediately get back up. Shouldnt BT not proc because they have been downed?
---
Can't be 24th since the servers come with the new chapter. The deadline for the servers is 23th.
---
I mean there are neutral things, but masculine pronouns are used for neutral.
---
It'd be cool but i honestly don't think a killer is nessicary
---
&gt; The trick of BBQ is you gotta hook them, heh. My biggest challenge is losing a survivor in a chase. As soon as they break LOS they disappear. I know follow scratches/blood but scratches are so vague.
---
Provided you are not colorblind (not like you can't see colors but the one where struggle to differ between two/three colors e.g. red/green), this does get easier with practice. You can also play with the perk that makes blood easier to see for a couple of games to get the hang of where blood spawns. Oh and try your monitor settings these can also help.
---
Using sound is a must aswell though, especially once you have hit a survivor once. You can always hear if they are getting away from you, or if they are hiding somewhere (unless they have Iron Will but that's not very common).
---
When I started I used to main Doctor and well he basically always knows where everyone is with his normal build (not the M&amp;A + Calm build). Helps to understand how survivors "work" and the tactics they like to use to hide from you, atleast for me this really helped me understand where survivors are. Now when playing Huntress I'll usually know where they are before I've seen/heard them yet and if chasing them it becomes really obvious where they want to go most (I'm not perfect either) of the time.
---
It's not personal. If you're the weakest link, a strategy is to eliminate you asap so it becomes a 3v1. You're easy prey if you also don't have borrwed time status or decisive strike.
---
Bruh the Adam should of body blocked

A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.

Just run around the map once and you will find it. Usually takes less than a full minute to find it. Alternatively, announce in the vc with your friends that it is needed to ruin the ruin. If everyone goes one direction it takes literally just a few seconds to find it. We do this every time we encounter it
---
I think you got some perks mixed up, friend. "Distortion" is a survivor perk.
---
Hag traps and Myers are the OG jump scares.
---
Getting a random pallet dropped on your head out of n where as killer is the worst jump scare in today’s game.
---

Theyre not lol
---
Invest in Stake-Out and just work through it. I tell my friends all the time, stop worrying about Ruin and just do the gen. My last game I powered through three gens, two of them solo with Ruin up and my friends were still like “where is the totem? We need to get that totem!” And I’m just like, dude.....the games already almost over. Ruin stopped being a threat a long time ago.
---
Can't do great skill checks with a shitty computer, so I choose the other option
---
Some disagreements
---
Pig: Whispers + M&amp;A give her insane stealth because you can crouch as soon as Whispers pops and they will never hear your tr. Even without Whispers, with practice you will get the time to crouch down and free up a perk slot if you don't like Whispers.
---
Doc: When everyone is in Madness 2, His static field doesn't do much, so patrolling in Punishment is the better option. This combined with Calm makes him a Myers with less lethality but more tracking and stall. Though I get it can hurt him, I think it's average on him cause he likes both a big AND small tr.
---
Legion: Less warning is key when they stay injured, and with the extended tr in chase, he gets the tracking of Distressing but the surpirse factor of a 24m tr.
---
Plague: Again, if they don't cleanse, they are permainjured, and since she'll be a m1 killer at that point you want to start the chase as close as possible. 
---
Otherwise, I like the list.
---
I mean it's ez to farm items as survivor
---
If someone DC's on first hook because they were found shortly after start they were going to DC regardless. Not a gameplay mechanic but a personality flaw. Besides if everyone saw who the killer was they could adequately prepare for that killer. No fun. Also switching loadout at last minute is a good way to fool a killer. Example: four flashlights at first, the killer will probably throw on lightborn, then when you take them off at last minute the killer will have wasted a perk slot.
---
Okay but I was expecting either a DC or NOED.
---
I'm confused. I find m&amp;a useful on all killers and I read all your comebacks. The only people I don't think it works best on are Ghostface and kind of doctor
---
Not technically because they’re still injured when they are in the trapped state. If you suspect someone has BT just pick them up and you’re good to go.
---
Me too, skill checks are super laggy most of the time but if you just stick at it you get a feel for them even with the lag.
---
He for sure meant Discordance
---
Ah it's been awhile since we've had a clip from Scary Movie posted.

Obviously you play however you'd like, but it's really not worth bringing Small Game to find totems. You can learn how totem spawns work and know where they are most of the time. The only thing Small Game really does is make up for being forgetful by allowing you to just scan an area close to you and hear a ding.
---
As an example of how totem spawns work: Generally they are tucked into corners unless it's a cornfield and they tend to not be close to each other. Like if you find a totem at the killer shack, you know you're probably gonna have to run a decent distance to find the next totem as opposed to a potential spawn directly beside the one you broke.
---
I'm both and so is my brother theres options on your TV to adjust the brightness and color....

---
Doesn’t pig kinda roar?
---
I have a PC and dont PTB, ruins the experience
---
It’s more like a battle cry than a roar, since she’s shouting as she attacks.
---
If you’re the first one found, that’s where you can start to change your gameplay. Take notice of your surroundings before working on a gen. Are there pallets nearby? Is there a good window if you have Balanced Landing? Can you get to a safe area quickly if you heard a sudden heartbeat? Are there crows nearby that can give off your location? Are you just running around leaving scratch marks to your first destination? 
---
There’s a lot of factors why you get found first that you can change. The other part though is you needing to be more evasive. When a killer knows you’re a weaker link, they don’t want you on gens, they want you for map pressure. And it’s not malicious in any means, but I can’t remember a time the survivors took it easy on me so I don’t expect killers to do the same when they’re ahead.
---
https://pics.me.me/oh-dear-it-seems-you-ve-seen-it-kira-template-60229848.png
---
No Claudette! Why are you unhooking me when the killer is chasing you?!
---
Just gotta tap it if you can’t hit skill checks.
---
Surge goes off before Thrilling Tremors activates in a normal case. You down someone, Surge goes off, you immediately block the gens with Tremors after you pick them up.
---
True, although the lack of directional input means that sometimes survivors will see it light up and run right into me because they think I'm coming from the opposite direction. Very funny.
---
Now that the hum isn't directional, monitor allows you to get even closer before heart beat.
---
Doing gens, u?
---
I mean, at least the Demogorgon doesn’t have to break the biggest bone in its body, risking permanent damage and possibly impairing it’s ability to walk, just to be a screamy boi.
---
Depends.
---
If they just load in together, I'm fine.
---
If 3-4 P3 claudettes load in together with flashlights, you bet your ass I'm dodging that.
---
Bubba smash!
---
Can't blame ya for that lol
---
Absolutely. Why put it in a category that is reasonable to max out still, and not the category that CANNOT gain max points because of the DC?
---
That’s why I don’t run them together.
---
Thank you very much for the tips and I did try both of the builds and I like both of them. But at the moment I am stuck in the red ranks that why I use more like meme perks instead of something that's actually good. But again I really appreciate you trying to help me.
---
Yep, I was incredibly hyped with a million BP banked.  Decided to spend it on other characters last night.  I'm not sure if I'm even going to rank up any of the stranger things characters when they release.
---
Very Epic
---
I used NOED wraith for like 3 matches until (not at all humble brag) I realized I never got to the end of a match. Most xbox players are either worse than me, or DC after the second hit.
---
When I run DH alone they still immediately  get it.
---
Yeah moniter and abuse mixed with whispers is really good on pig bc u can crouch when whispers pops up and they wont hear your terror radius.
---
What killer do you main?
---
[source](https://twitter.com/TwitchAyrun/status/1170088799268933634?s=19). apparently this particular juke was originated by Loleriz, who i'm not familiar with. the shit people come up with in this game is fantastic, tho.
---
People already have. It’s called “not running in a straight line”. His Shred ability comes in handy when a survivor has to move in a linear path to go to, say, a vault point.
---
He wanted me to kill him last, but he's the Dying Light Obsession so he had to go.
---
This shit happens to me all the time, it's not tunneling. I usually have to check lockers around the upstairs and make sure nobody is creeping around waiting for me to walk away so they can go for the unhook. These guys unhooked really fast, that's probably what this guy was doing and he was probably just there when it happened.
---
Photobomb
---
For me it's the inconsistency, my game has micro stutters so like, one skill check may be fine, and then another stutters at the beginning, etc.
---
Hope you are right
---
there was noed, you can click on the continue watching after the clip  https://clips.twitch.tv/PlausibleSaltyMonkeyPupper
---
Really informative comment and I agree with everything you said, i personally think its especially good on pig and plague
---
You don't need to really memorize the spawn locations of totems, just how they spawn on a given map though I won't lie it got a lot harder at some point. Like on Haddonfield you used to see a totem just about 100% of the time on each end of the street behind the cement blocks. It feels rare for me to see that now.
---
All you really need to remember is generally where the totems can spawn and generally they're in key locations anyways that you'll see all the time. For examples: T L walls can have a totem spawn usually between 2 barrels, jungle gyms can have a totem spawn tucked in the corner by a pallet spawn, cornfields can have totem spawns, main building of each map usually has a totem spawn, killer shack can have 1 in the corner by the pallet, etc.
---
Again of course you play how you like. I just feel like mentioning the totem spawn thing because it really isn't as bad as you may think since aside from specific maps that are unique in their design, the totem spawns are fairly consistent. Small Game realistically isn't even a bad perk, just that other options are better. Small Game can realistically save you a ton of time even if you DO know how totems can spawn just because they sometimes want to be dickheads and go in some bizarre locations that you might not even know exist. I can't even count how many times I've said to myself, "The hell? Since when could a totem spawn here?" Like on The Game there's the corner room with the stairs up to that big drop, turns out a totem spawn can be behind the barrels near those stairs and at the bottom of the drop right behind where you fall in the corner there is often a totem there.
---
When you drop a pallet. Sometimes the killer will play loops with you hoping to land a hit. Other times they destroy it immediately because they don’t want to deal with a loop or because it genuinely benefits them. Take note and run away whenever you drop it if you know they will break it.
---
For those who wishes to watch the rest - https://clips.twitch.tv/PlausibleSaltyMonkeyPupper
---
I can't tell if you're misusing "clap some cheeks" or if things get really weird down in the basement
---
Do legion's vaults benefit from perks that increase vault speed?
---
If he's a killer why would he want to help us? 🤔
---
I'm positive I've said those exact words to the people at school who call me psychotic. Great cosplay as well.
---
Thanks for the tips.  What's a devotion mean?  I feel put of the loop.
---
Nah, think I’d rather get the totem tbh, can’t hit greats to save my life on console, too unpredictable

Amen brother, amen.

Same here. Whenever the skill check noise notification pops up, I quickly look at the ground. This helps with fps and the inconsistency issues since the game has less things to render.

...aside from teabagging, you mean playing the game normally? Decisive is literally useless if you don't get tunnelled. Pallet looping, how do you expect the survivors to you know... survive?
---
Because people will complain about anything that doesn’t give them an advantage
---
Nobody:
---
-
---
IndiGrimm: "You fucks spamming "useless nobody" are infinitely more annoying than the useless nobody itself."
---
So basically
---
If 2 People work on a gen, and they are PERFECTLY SYNCHRONIZED, so that 1 tapps and 1 pauses, they get exqctly 100% Gen progress speed.
---
If both work on it, both get 90% speed, so it's 180%
---
Whenever one of them gets "only" a normal skillcheck, they can't progress for 2 sec, so they should all stop doing the gen. You don't want to get a skillcheck during a no-progress time.
---
TV show is OP, doesn't even need to be in the locker to use Head On.
---
The only perks he complains about are borrowed time and DS, clearly an ape that facecamps and tunnels, no point in arguing with him.
---
Wowww
---
And BT is just a given at this point
---
Sensible. They lucky I didnt facecamp then for using flashlights but eh
---
It's not a shortcut. It's them quitting. If anything they're admitting they lost so you deserve the points for beating them
---
I also didn't say it should be 2000 sacrifice points or some shit, just that it should go to a category that will ALWAYS have space for points if someone quits, rather than brutality that can reach 8000 making the "quitter" bonus 0 points.
---
Idk Tim this sounds pretty one sided to me.
---
The short answer is Tapping is never better. The trick i just recently learned is that, when the progress gets stopped by someone hitting a normal skill check, everybody should stop repairing for that time and start repairing afterwards (for optimal effectiveness).
---
The reason is that while you repair for that time you can still get skill checks although you're not even getting progress for that time.
---
Decisive strike is not useless omg. When you're playing a killer that is tunneling it can save you especially if you have a sprint burst. 5 seconds to get out of the killers line of sight is quite a bit figuring I'm stuck in animation and cant see direction.
---
It does none of the things the above players mentioned.
---
The whoosh sound always happens at the same radius, it's a distance and not a factor of terror radius.
---
The spirit husk that Rin leaves behind is perkless. You might have M&amp;A, but the husk doesnt. As soon as you spoop the terror radius goes back up to normal perkless spirit radius.
---
Also I know it doesn’t happen a lot but I’ve had skill checks pop up while tapping and then the gen explodes.
---
W
---
they did??
---
Besides this meme is for fun as is the game. Pallet loop me but dont message me crying I tunneled. I just beat you in the game of cat and mouse this time
---
Oh really you liked them both? :) awesome! Did you have one that you liked more? The first build or the second one? 
---
Also I understand your pain im now in red ranks as a Wraith granted im a Myers main but ive been using wraith for bloodpoints hes very good at BP gains and ive been doing really good as wraith I personally think hes slept on yeah hes not the best killer but if you know how to use him you can do very well. I just like stealth killers in general.
---
Doctor can be really good if you know how to use him. 
---
But if you want meme builds you can do a fuck your healing build
---
With stuff like distressing, couloraphobia, sloppy butcher, nurses calling or thanotophobia for an even worse healing speed.
---
I never understood, this, games that go to Best are ones where ruin is destroyed early.
---
A totem tends to be near a generator, if every spawned away from each other, and assuming the killer goes finds one person early on, that means there's 3 people available to quickly check the totem by their generator and a 3/5 chance ruin can be out right away.
---
Might as well check the nearest totem
---
WOW! ITZ BOOTIFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Rank 9

[Michael Myers Info](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Michael_Myers)
---
Well, Ghostface is literally the funniest killer in the game. His around the corner stalking looks really funny.  I think Scary Movie just ruined the (original) character. Not that I mind.
---
Okay? You mean they are bad and he has no good perks?
---
Yes, but*
---
That's only the case for her without other things fucking with her radius. Perks do not apply to the terror radius of her spirit husk, so spoopy whoosh will always be heard if you are outside of the HUSK's TR, but not if inside it.
---
It does not do this thing.
---
No its just the only perks you run into. Playing high rank you literally see those perks more often than not. Dont insult me rather than ask. This game and meme were fun
---
This guy probably runs noed, ruin, bbq, and nurses calling and he’s here crying about survivors
---
My second time ever playing killer was against 4 SWF claudettes all with medkits and the same outfit. The hook swarm was insane.
---
Camping hooks is already a penalty for killers. I've accidentally lost points because of it.
---
I play both sides and i actually think this would be op FOR THE KILLER lol. Knowing there is no survivors near could be too good.
---
to be fair if you do tunnel do not be mad if a survivor escapes you then teabags and i say it is even honestly
---
Unless they changed the algorithm, if you use a single totem it's guaranteed to spawn in one side of the map on all maps.  Someone figured this out a little while ago.  So if it dies quick, that's most likely why.  I'll see if I can find the post.
---
I leave people slugged and chase too. I play freddy and absolutely love him with fired up. I play gens and run surveillance. It helps me watch the far out gens and use his ability to pop in once in awhile if need be. 
---
Yesterday I ran into a team of two rank 3 players running that set up (decisive strike, borrowed, etc,.) It does happen. Not everyone plays with morals
---
&gt; No.
---
It can be used to hold a game hostage forcing the survivor to stay wasting their time and destroying the experience.
---
Read the third point...
---
&gt; Survivors don't need another crutch/second chance.
---
Why would a Killer stay a full minute next to the hook when he knows no other survivor is whitin 32m of it?
---
Interesting. Thanks
---
Dwight’s gonna slap them cheeks boi
---
IDK guys, if you know where specific totems are it doesn't hurt to check. A lot of people can't land skill checks.
---
Can anyone who consistently runs away after being unhooked explain &amp; defend their position?
---
I did not say it was useless. If you get tunneled, then of course its not useless. Thats the point of the perk. To prevent tunnelling. If you get hit by decisive, then thats your fault for tunneling. I play killer and survivor 50/50 and simply assume every single person has decisive and borrowed time, so I don't tunnel. Because when I play survivor I make sure to run those perks because there are killers that don't have any shame in tunneling a player out of the game, or camping.
---
If you read between the lines, this is actually a Killer buff.
---
Cha cha real smooth
---
And you think that camping killers wont notice that? 1 min is hella long
---
You could always try KYF and have a friend run a few hex perks and run around a few maps to get an idea
---
How about the demigorgon in the femur breaker?
---
I don't know why I thought they would try to release it by this Friday. That would make too much sense.
---
You’ve clearly never heard of basement trapper
---
That would be sweet
---
Dope. Thanks!
---
Spooky
---
I'm all for intrinsic punishments for camping (no. Losing chaser emblem points isn't punishment) but these ideas are a bit much, especially that last one. 
---
What they need to do is make Kindred base kit, make T1 Myers (and all killers about to be invulnerable to aura revealing perks) revealed by it. Then they need to make it so that if the killer camps too long, any BT user has the endurance status placed on them as well as the unhooked, and so that the stun timer for Decisive strike doubles if the killer camps too long.
---
Does blindness apply to scratch marks shown by Fixated perk?
---
&gt;Survivors don't need another crutch/second chance.
---
At least it's not like killers who have literal game mechanics that are crutches
---
It's a joke really. Survive how you want and I'll kill how I want. I WILL NEVER blame a survior who pallet loops me the entire match .. that would be my fault as a killer. That's something I've learned quite recently, when to drop off of chase's and switch back to putting pressure on gens. 
---
You gotta ask yourself sometimes what it's worth to get a survior. Is he taunting me and will taking him out affect how well the other surviors work together
---
Think what gets me is the survivors who clearly know you are trying to pick them up but refuse to move out of glitched spots out of fairness, unless she was unable to move till picked up. Still though, see a lot of clips of people taking advantage of this.
---
Yea, sure, but 32m is too much and only if hooks instakill when the gens are done
---
I'm not sure how a buff that would make a survivor invincible for 15 seconds helps me in any way. 32m is way to big. Face camping is a low level issues that quickly gets stomped on . It doesn't need all this.  I used to face camp when I first started, I eventually got my ass whooped. It also kills the survivors ability to stealth unhook, which makes the game less fun.
---
Ignore the haters, this be a killer main subreddit.
---
Honestly I’m not super experienced as killer either but I’m slowly learning. Here are my quick tips:
---
You can’t afford to waste a single second. Everything is fast paced. Focus on finding survivors and killing them efficiently. It’s GO GO GO TIME!
---
Whenever you pick up a survivor, make sure your body is facing a wall or some kind of block. It’ll prevent survivors from being able to run in front of you and flashlight blind you.
---
Don’t be stubborn with chases and learn to let someone go.
---
It’s okay to tunnel and camp if you want. But I find camping to be inefficient and it’ll hurt you more than help you.
---
The perk predator has helped me tremendously with tracking.
---
Use Hex Ruin asap.
---
Because surviors only have a handful of perks worth using, so why wouldnt we use perks to counter lazy, sweaty tryhards that just want to win with the least amount of effort possible? 
---
BT pisses you off? Stop fucking camping.
---
DS pisses you off? Stop fucking tunneling. 
---
Teabagging pisses you off? Pressure gens instead of getting triggered. 
---
You get baited into playing poorly and then complain survivors are toxic. 
---
Dont worry, you always have Noed to bail you out.
---
I agree 100%
---
I feel I just take too long doing that. Even if you get them exposed, I still think a good survivor can loop you for 45 seconds. Especially at the beginning of the game where all the pallets ar available. That's why I think the stalk thing is stronge late in the game. Less survivors, less pallets....
---
Things like basement Bubba is exactly what this suggestion is trying to get rid of.
---
I’ve used an ebony mori once, and that was because it was the first one I’d ever gotten
---
&gt; I'm not sure how a buff that would make a survivor invincible for 15 seconds helps me in any way.
---
There is 0 reasons to stay a full minute next to a hook when you know 0 survivor is whitin 32m of it.
---
I usually run enduring fury with him to fix that issue.
---
Bloodhound is extremely useful for slower killers, since the expiry time on the scratches is often not enough to find survs again
---
I think kindred should activate even if the perk is not equip if the killer is within N meters of the hook for X seconds.
---
It doesn't shake things up but it let's everyone know, hey, he is camping, consider doing gens instead of unhooking
---
True gamers only eat Belle Delphine's bath water.
---
Fix the gate glitch by adding a few hatches outside the walls
---
&gt; these ideas are a bit much, especially that last one.
---
No Killer would stay a full minute next to a hook when they KNOW there is no survivor whitin 32m of it, unless you are toxic face camping out of salt.
---
The last one made my day.
---
For me ghostface can be the funnest killer to go against ornone of the worst
---
I got into an argument with someone on here who swore up and down this doesn’t happen. And I WAS the one downvoted for it.
---
No sir please check my page out and my other responses here. I do not like tunneling nor do I like to face camp hook- face camping hook is just as shitty as teabagging imo 
---
I play gens and like putting pressure on surviors as a group rather than one
---
I am more irritated she didn't kick it first, otherwise seems like she had little reason to keep hovering unless whispers?
---
&gt;it can be used to hold a game hostage
---
While I do not like the idea OP proposed, this wouldn't be the case, you can always kill yourself on hook
---
&gt; 32m is too much
---
You also get to know no survivors is within 32m of it. I actually think this helps Killers more than survivors.
---
How the fuck is Decisive made for bad players who cant loop? Its to stop killers tunnelling the shit out of people without getting punished, as well as Borrowed Time basically only being good late game or if the killer is camping so again I dont see how its crutch, you seem like someone who plays 1 side more than the other so I understand the frustration but theres bad shit on both sides but to act like some of these perks which are extremely niche and made to counter a specific situation are crutch af is crazy
---
If you’re bad at Ghostface then stick to survivor. He’s absolutely broken. If you can’t play him then you can’t play any killer. This is just he opinion of a filthy casual tho so I may not know that much.
---
Does the aura reading in rancor affect stealth killers (excluding tier 1 Mike) like OoO
---
You don't?
---
Unless I’m running bbq and chill, I need my blood points man
---
Okay thank you for that last sentence cause I was feeling hurt for a second lol
---
Yeah I really need to level up hag to get ruin on my other killers and sometimes I'm not sure if it's worth chasing people or not. I try not to camp if I can avoid it, even if I know it'd be good in certain situations because it makes me feel like an asshole. Thanks for the input!
---
Especially because of the third point. If a Killer stays for a full minute you get out easily.
---
Damn. This makes me wish we had more killers who were just regular psychos instead of spooky psychos. Don’t get me wrong I love the killers (thank you again BHVR) but damn, the terror of being chased by what looks like a regular person is just something else.
---
I have no idea how you encounter solid GFs at red ranks. On PS4 there are none. I barely find a GF at purple rank and he might play so mediocre that I feel sorry for him (cause he is my main too).
---
His power to expose has no use at lower ranks. You simply have to use it for different purposes - Stealth and sneak attacks with Nurse Calling. Best method to apply pressure on skilled survivors is to hit and go after another. Night Shroud and trail back for those injured, cause they'll heal. Easy down. If you start chasing someone or expose a survivor from distance, there's no chance you'll catch it (they know how to loop and where, not to mention they can work together to fuck you up).
---
Unfortunately, his power is not that great in what was intended to do, but works great for surprise attacks. All you need now is a surveillance and a delaying perk.
---
I believe nobody could camp anymore with a suggestion like that.
---
I've been playing for 3 months and have finally just broke through the yellow ranks into green, and close to purple as I'm 11 now, I can hit skill checks, i understand what perks to use, and how to use loops, I've stocked up on as much information as i can but the actual execution almost never goes right. I've watched painreliever and tons of tips videos and dbd is the main game I'm playing at the moment, but I feel like I've hit a huge roadblock as my friends are already red and purple and I started earlier than them, any advice for better chases, not hiding but actual better chasing and jukes. 
---
P.S I'm in ps4 if that helps at all
---
I could actually get behind that.
---
Ok, but you gotta admit that it’s a little overkill to make mettle of decisive adrenaline deliverance
---
lol
---
There should be a perk where you don’t have skill checks within a certain proximity of the killer like 12/24/36
---
You do have a point, but then i think it would be used in a swf party more than a solo game
---
:18 You can almost hear the player rage at knowing they most likely lost Dwight.
---
I play console too and tbh I always do 1-2 gems before hard looking for it. Worst case scenario you’ll typically get the gen done at 70% speed if you hit no great skill checks. I’ll look around places while I run to another gen. It’s just such a bad position when people start getting hooked and the game is hectic and we have no gens done because everyone is scrambling to find ruin. If anything when I SWF we’ll have one person look for it and 3 doing gens
---
A lot of them are though, sadly. 
---
And I get it. I’ve played like a toxic asshole with friends before. It can be funny. But whenever I’m playing killer, I generally try to avoid going against a super coordinated team of four. Unless I go all out try-hard with perks and offerings, I’m basically asking for failure. (I’m not super good at killer, which is why this is my stance).
---
Not toxic but a good incentive for the killer to tunnel you
---
And tbh anyone that thinks this suggestion helps survivors has no idea what they're talking about. If this suggestion was ever implemented it would probably help Killers way too much lol
---
Killers who already aren't campers would be helped so much by this.
---
Yeah me too I like the first one better as well. 
---
But I thought of another meme build. 
---
The Hooker build ;) 
---
Hangmans Trick, so they cant keep your hooks destroyed and you can reuse hooks that people have died on
---
BBQ&amp;C, so you can see surva when you hook people + BP.
---
Agitation and Iron Grasp to get them to the hooks fast.
---
Could also use other perks that involves hooks like pop for the gen regression or Furtive Chase just bc it activates by hooking and unhooking, or make your choice because well it also takes effect when someone unhooks. Or monstrous shrine for just the memes.
---
Ohhh i just remembered (last build i promise lol)
---
Heres a really fun build based around attack cooldowns and the such
---
Unrelenting (not a good perk but still when u miss you will recover faster) 
---
Save the best for last (great perk and allows you to have a fast cooldown after successful attacks)
---
Mad Grit (no cooldown on missed attacks while carrying someone) 
---
Fourth perk can be anything you want like ruin lol, this build is really fun if u wanna mess around.
---
Look man, at the end of the day your trying to make big changes to a rank 19 killer. Or someone doing a troll bubba basement build. All instead of face camping I'll just sit 33 m out and peek back in and see the alert if a survivor is nearby. You wont solve face camps. It's a low level thing that people grow out of
---
Pennywise isn't actually a clown, it is actually a demon that manifests itself as your greatest fear.
---
Hmmm, idea here. What if they could bring in a killer like that, that each survivor see differently based on something they fear? Would it be possible to have one killer appear as, up to, four different emanations based on the survivor that is seeing it?
---
I'm rank 3 and it's common to be matched in a low level lobby and I can always tell off the first chase.
---
Its not. The point of this suggestion is to remove toxic face camping. 
---
This "mettle decisive" would only ever happen if a Killer really wanted to be toxic. There is 0 reasons to face camp when you know there is no other survivors whitin 32m of the hook.
---
eveyr time i see a 4 man p3 claudete group
---
EBONY MORI TIS!
---
10/10 camera angle
---
Wat water
---
He is a toxic killer
---
&gt; All instead of face camping I'll just sit 33 m out and peek back in and see the alert if a survivor is nearby.
---
That's the first intelligent reply i've read in this topic. I guess a Billy that camps at 33m would indeed be difficult to counter.
---
I aint cool tho..... or am I?
---
It would be unfair fir killers with terror radius perk, specially unnerving presence since it completely ruins the point of the perk
---
I agree with your points. If I tunnel as a killer I have to accept that my poor judgment WILL cost me gens.
---
 That's something I've learned ranking up- survivors are strategic on baiting killers and I assume people communicate in parties so I'm cautious in chases. I'll drop off of chase if my fake outs aren't throwing the survior off. 
---
Freddy's pallets are awesome too cause you throw em out early and chase around them during dream state.
---
well People complain about the Killer most of the time, but Camping on the hook or tunnel Vision chasing a specific Survivor to kill him asap, usually result in more complaints and insults
---
Honestly let's not forget that a survivor killing themselves on the hook should grant you the points of the extra hook events because essentially they are stealing points from you.
---
Oh and the full hook/sacrifice points should be granted the moment a survivor is hooked if they are on the last hook. Currently it has too much of a gap to allow survivors to DC which loses killers points.
---
Don’t directly stay next to survivors while hooked
---
The other survivors will hate you and get generators done
---
Don’t focus on a survivor when it’s not beneficial (this is called tunnelling)
---
Other than that have fun and don’t pay attention to survivors that hate you for killing people as killer.
---
They aren’t Netlflix seasons. Those 2 seasons premiered on MTV 4-5 years ago. I still have them recorded on my DVR.
---
He did. He tried using his chainsaw and hit the wall. Only reason I made it out I bet.
---
that's absolutely horrifying, thank you.
---
&gt;Trash
---
25% slow. Better than Thanatophobia. 
---
Also note this Ace was a Sabo-Ace with Alex's Toolbox, Hacksaw, and Cutting Wire. I feel he was going to have every hook 99'd and I was lucky he was the obsession.
---
Insta-med is the surv crutch and yet it wasn't even among his list lol
---
So you want to erase a whole playstyle just because you dont like it? Its a valid tactic since there are perks for the basement.
---
Hol' up
---
Playing Ghostface is Hard. Especially it feels like no matter what I do someone is watching me and kicking me out of my power. I get the impression I’m being followed and observed. The response time to duck away when someone is looking feels so short. Any advice on not getting seen?
---
I agree. If he doesn't hit the wall or just comes to you, he probably gets you. He panicked a little.
---
Sure as long as we can get an extra objective for survivors so that killers won't have to resort to tunnelling and camping to salvage some sort of dignity after getting gen rushed in 6 mins
---
&gt; but I am also currently rank 1 survivor.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If you stop getting caught with your pants down d strike becomes much less effective.
---
I would imagine you don't get hook farmed very often at rank 1.
---
Am I the only one who basically changes the camera view constantly? I'm paranoid the killer could come from anywhere so I just end up looking everywhere lol
---
I like to gamble lives in the basement
---
Thank god I don't have to play on pc holy shit

I normally can't hit great skillchecks so i work on gens but if i find ruin im going to cleanse it.
---
😭😂😂😂😂
---
Wait until you get to higher ranks. At low ranks killers dominate survivors at high ranks it is the other way round
---
Not a fix but a workaround.
---
Not the worst idea though.
---
If killer 3ks the hatch still spawns for the last surv so I'm going to go with no - Games not over till it's over.
---
32 meters is the average terror radius. That's not camping and it's too large to punish the killer for it. Also, survivors within that range aren't necessary just rushing or camping the hook so that whole idea is just total bunk
---
&gt; If a survivor's hook progression is paused for more than 1 minute, He is suddenly unhooked, fully healed, speed boost for 5 seconds, and for the next 15 seconds hits will not injure him.
---
peak moron survivor main. amazing
---
what? what are you even trying to say?
---
your brain is bunk
---
If the killer wants to tunnel, he's gonna come right back. If you have BT, I'll stick around.
---
I cant say if you're serious or not. Hes not the best killer but also not the worst.
---
I had a game against a Freddy a couple of days ago. Both times I was downed felt very unfair. It’s like his arm extended 3 times longer.
---
What if they don't bully though? Like I said not all of them are toxic.
---
Why that when I play shirtless david I get tunneled/moried/BM'ed? Even tho I play normal, I treasure hunt chests and loop the killer usually around 0.5 to 1 minute, don't teabag (only when I see survivors), is there something like Moving Flags to bulls that atract rage to shirtless davids?
---
&gt; I've accidentally lost points because of it.
---
be trapper
---
hook survivor
---
kick pallet
---
set trap
---
pick up new trap
---
congrats, your emblem has been damaged for camping 
---
fucking stupid
---
Those were some amazing jukes, as a killer main I think you should have won that for sure.
---
A - The Anti Camp solution is teamwork, BT and DS
---
B - Camaraderie is going to pause the hook timer for you if your buddies are in the close radius for 30 seconds
---
C - Camping is part of the game, killers lose out on BP when they do it tho so there’s the biggest incentive
---
&lt;3. Also let me guess cows i am probably found it he is the exploit god
---
LOL we're not all this godtier, promise 😅
---
Anyone else heard anything about charms (new cosmetic coming?) I saw it in someone's video who leaked some stuff on the dev build of the game but never really got any info on them. Is there anything about it online yet?
---
This speaks to skill level
---
I'm on PS4. Started to play him more after I found some solid GFs rank 4 and up. Getting 4k against 4 red ranks survivors. And got decent games after I tried that strat. Im now rank 3 survivor and rank 7 killer. 
---
Yes, most of the times you wont be able to expose a survivor at higher ranks. Thats why you should work on game pressure first, destroy all the pallets you can, hook them and keep them busy and away from gens. And for that, having 0m TR at 4,6m/s is HUGE. As I said, no other killer offers you that. Ok, he's no myers with his tier 3 for all survivors, and he's no Pig with the traps that can slow the game down. But all those resources are limited. Every 30s you can have 0 TR. And you can stalk with no limit. I think it worth a chance...
---
If you play dbd I think you are a good boy too ;)
---
Yep, happened to me a couple of days ago. Surv was downed right under a window. I couldn't find an angle to pick him up (yep, I tried to stand with my back to the window), swing a weapon a couple of times to show that he's unreachable and it would be kind of him if he moved. He didn't. Oh well, I just came after another guy. When I returned he wasn't there, so he wasn't stuck, slugged away somewhere (caught him later with hatch-adrenaline at exit gate).
---
If every survivor just took a week to work on hitting great skill checks and working through ruin, the perk would have to be completely re-worked cause it'd be worthless.
---
One time my SWF partner and myself spawned next to a gen with a third survivor and we all got on it. She had Prove Thyself and a toolbox. Gen was done in 15 seconds
---
b e c a u s e  T H E  G A M E  I S  R E T A R D E D
---
'genrushing' is a valid tactic since there are perks for doing gens quickly...yet killers want that issue patched to oblivion
---
If a surv is doing good loops and the chase is lasting too long just break off and go hunt down his friend, They're usually far easier and have no clue how to loop.
---
Yes, also that. But I find it very situational and not happened very often.
---
&gt; Knowing if survivors are near the hook or not is really OP.
---
weird because you keep screeching about how strong it would actually be for killers
---
&gt; You have no idea what you are playing lol
---
I mean, everyone disagrees with you. And only you. But okay, sport
---
Would you really want to get better at skillchecks? Play kill your friends as survivor against piggy. Get a mask on, go to saw machine but don't finish removing mask so you practice skillchecks for as long as you like!
---
But don't get a notification is far away?
---
Other than self care, yes. Easily.
---
I'm a killer main and I dont mimd genrushing. I also have experienced that if the survivors play smart you can punish the shit out of a camping killer.
---
whatever ya say, sporto
---
Me: whatever, I have enough practice to hit the greats.
---
Occasional PS4 frame rate: No.
---
I mean... future projects. Next imma do The Ironworks
---
its possible if the killer gets kind of pushed near the locker by the wiggling survivor
---
Nothing yet.
---
&gt; I am red ranks on both sides.
---
you were talking about being green ranks like 5 days ago. but okay lmfao
---
I would love to find that video and shove it in your face
---
But why would you want to pip as a killer tho
---
You're a meme so that puts a target on you.
---
Yeah i usually do that but ive had games where his friend is playing immersed so when i get close to him he just dissapears and his friend takes all the attention, and if i öeave his friend they usually just start chasing me witch just gives me the urge to kill them even more so yeah.
---
That’s a weird way to spell Lithe
---
Or, if you have godlike level of hearing like puppers, you can just run normally and hear the totem
---
I'm still getting this error. I haven't been able to play since June
---
We all just get annoyed of how cocky he is in it (yes we understand that it suits his character) but still we all hate it
---
I paid for that shit, I want to use but I can't
---
Well he's kind of a joke at higher ranks. Still suffers from the same problem as many other killers: loops and pallets. But at low ranks all killers might be broken if he's considered broken lol. My post is meant to find if there's any hope for him at high ranks... against good swf, he's still bad.
---
It's not fixed for me.
---
some dude who sucks at the game but thinks he's a genius
---
LOL true xD
---
Honestly WGLF should be exhaustion with how strong it is
---
&gt; weird because you keep screeching about how strong it would actually be for killers
---
Exactly. As Killer if you KNOW if survivors are near the hook or not, it helps you
---
okay edge lord
---
I mean i could post my rank 1 screenshot as survivor?
---
I actually did derank as Killer because red ranks are annoying lol
---
i love that scene in the movie
---
When all four survivors spawn on the same gen and complete it before you can reasonably do anything... feels bad. Not sure which feels more demoralising, that or the thunder clap of an instant Ruin cleanse.
---
Run because she is scaring me
---
&gt; Survivors can still "win" the match even if they die
---
haha only dipshit tru3 cultists would say something like this
---
About Rank 3 and lower. Rank 4 to rank 6 are actually quite a nice balance between killer and survivor.
---
It might have nothing to do with myers perks, he might have 'bbq and chili', a cannibal teachable perk. Google that, itll kill you endlessly til you understand it. Distortion is a good survivor perk to learn when your aura is being seen by the killer. Also, myers does have one addon that lets him see your aura at all times when stalking within 12 meters. But its rare. Maybe youve been getting hit w a combination, but id bet BBQ+Chili in most cases.
---
Same here, like just stop ruining our fun and use the PTB to actually test the new content,
---
&gt; Tru3 had no map pressure so the survivors could just chill on gens. He got out played, simple as that.
---
OP is like "he couldn't do anything to stop gens!" but maybe he could have patrolled gens rather than going back to the hook? what a concept
---
&gt; Was it a SWF that beat him?
---
was he screeching about SWF? I couldn't watch with sound
---
For **c**heese, **c**heap, or making survivors **c**ry?
---
&gt; If you aren't a high rank, then you can't complain about NOED. You play with idiots so I imagine most if not every killer perk frustrates the fuck out of you.
---
Except I didn't complain about NOED so I'm not sure what the fuck you are on about?
---
&gt;Borrowed Time and DS are pretty much noob perks used to counter idiotic play.
---
......That's exactly what I'm saying. If my teammates or the killer are idiots (And a lot of the time they are) these perks are useful.
---
It's not about "Being caught with your pants down" since all it takes is a dumb hook from a team mate and DS is useful - That doesn't mean you misplayed.
---
They don't even need to skip a chapter for this, it would also perfectly fit into a midchapter patch just like the Freddy rework.
---
I am gunna make another one from the survivor side when I get a game with a toxic survivor.
---
C for crap. Every hillbilly I fight is trash
---
That is a really good piece of advice. Thank you.
---
new to DBD reddit who are you starting to say when you cutoff Ja
---
oh wow so you're just admitting that you're being intentionally misleading
---
girl bye
---
The problem with bt and ds is not that they counter tunneling. The problem is that they can be abused- being able to thansform reckless hook-bombing into a legit space creation strategy, because of a saved guy body-blocking the bt hit and having 60 second invulnerability period is. While the disgn of these perks is good, the way people, especially SWF can abuse them is what feels kinda unfair.
---
but you just said it's not that strong
---
fuck off with this talking out both sides of your mouth shit
---
So hear me out: there’s this perk called whispers.
---
Wait what how did you turn your camera like that while turning left and right and I’m so confused
---
I can't see where I said that, but probably "Jack"
---
They are testing stuff - Just not the stuff you want them to.
---
Non issue.
---
Small game team boys
---
Lol yes you do. A couple of times I’ve bought a purple flashlight and a white ward, and checked that I’ve got for example 3 purple flashlights. During the game killer then closes the app so we dc and I’ve lost the white ward and the flashlight.
---
it was when you were starting to name off killers they added and the stopped spelling after Ja and said nevermind he isn't happening. is that jack from the Shining?
---
Claudette is shaking
---
Glorifying Clown over Freddy, the fuck? Freddy is A tier, Clown is C tier at best lmao. Never said Clown was better, I said Freddy's snares aren't anything amazing, but are still good. Please find anywhere in my post where I said Clown is overall better. You're reaching really hard there to try and discredit me, mate. And yes, I literally said in my post, "Both are pretty shit" referring to Clown and Wraith. But yes, I guess my opinion is worthless because you don't know how to read and just like to take things out of context because someone doesn't share your opinions. Also, yes, I like Clown, but I know he's low tier. I just think Wraith is a bit worse :)
---
Jason, lol
---
If you lose survivors super easily, try boodhound (wraith perk). If you hit a survivor, their blood will make them damn near impossible to lose :)
---
I swing violently and pretend like I am going to actually hit something as if they were dumb enough to continue standing in front of me. I mean there's always a chance, right?
---
Why are only Male survivors topless?!?! Its sexist!
---
/sarcasm
---
At least you added the noise notification.
---
Demogorgon's a gurl because he got no PP.
---
Its gotta be a bug man. Thats just not how the game works.
---
I wish I would encounter more GFs at red ranks. I could use some techniques playing against SWF groups at low ranks. But, GF has no map pressure, you need to apply it yourself, by constantly injuring them, giving some other objective other than gens.
---
I run BBQ, Ruin for delay, Bamboozle for a standing chance on loops and Nurse's Calling. Still have difficulties with low rank survivors. Maybe you got other advice?
---
tru3 played so poorly that everyone deranked lmao
---
horror scary game
---
artificial apples? nice try
---
you are literally brainwashed by a twitch streamer manchild. that is so sad
---
It isn't
---
Didn't Spine Chill used to have a built in vault speed increase? I don't see it in the tooltip anymore (or has it always been a hidden bonus?)
---
I can't tell if I'm confusing myself with Resilience
---
I believed they were mentioned in the dev stream talking about The Archive a while back as a reward for completing certain goals.  No recent information but should come to light as they get ready to launch The Archive.
---
You complained about pallet looping, DS and BT. Both perks that mostly punish campers and/or tunnelers. What did you expect?
---
Ah wasn’t aware of that, learned something new today.
---
Yeah I think that's what this meme should've been directed towards. 
---
Didnt share that information in the meme cause well it's a meme but YES!!! I cant even keep count of the times body blockers have ran bt out of basement. Defeats purpose of basement so I keep monstrous shrine on freddy.
---
the obsess.. ahahah, I see what you did there
---
I'm not a poor sport but you are being a dick
---
(Currently maining freddy with surveillance, fire up, ruin, and monstrous shrine)
---
&gt; If you get hit by decisive, then thats your fault for tunneling 
---
Thats the most common reason to get hit by DS, however no the only reason, you can also just accidentaly run into the unhooked player or they bait the DS by getting hit on purpose shortly after an unhook.
---
These reasons may not be to common but they do exist.
---
Like I said, I don't care about the advantage. One is more camouflaged. One blends in better. Even if it's by a miniscule event.
---
If you don't know which one just say it initially, going around the question like this just wastes my time.
---
There are 3 reasons to keep repairing:
---
1) they don't know about it (**BOOSTED**)
---
2) they don't care about it / are to lazy
---
3) they want more Bloodpoints, since even Repairing with 0% progress gives you points. It's like ... idk, 100 or 200 more points to keep repairing? Not worth it, if you get one or two additional checks because of it.
---
Most people care more about chase efficiancy then gen efficiancy. Understandable though
---
Perhaps the only use case where Kate's perk would help
---
That is not my issue. My issue is that people test NONE of the new stuff which. This killer didn't play any of the new stuff at all he just wanted to use his Mori because he wouldn't lose it after the PTB ends. Plus people DC from the games so it is never a proper DBD game because of it.
---
So you don't know which one. Got it.
---
I’m assuming you’re in-between rank 11-7. Lockers are the only place survivors can go to avoid screaming. So by having iron maiden on doc you’re countering that. Good job. I’m going to try this
---
A user on my meme shared exactly my thoughts on why I made the meme 
---
The problem with bt and ds is not that they counter tunneling. The problem is that they can be abused- being able to thansform reckless hook-bombing into a legit space creation strategy, because of a saved guy body-blocking the bt hit and having 60 second invulnerability period. While the design of these perks is good, the way people, especially SWF can abuse them is what feels kinda unfair.
---
The number of times surviors have run in basement with borrowed time and body block is insane. It's the reason I run monstrous shrine.
---
It was in the moment, I wasn't ready to get my ass handed to me in a bullshit match
---
I'm a nice killer :) i tend to let people go.
---
Plus i used to main Survivor, until BBQ came and my BP addiction chained me to playing killer. Sometimes i do SWF though
---
You can do that and not use all of your iridescent add-ons/offerings.
---
why is the mouth movement so ^(perfect)
---
Yeah it's nice but I'm at rank 2 right now
---
It's a sign
---
Well maybe that case red rank survivors complain about anything they don’t escape from
---
It is. The entity is a feminine noun in French, rather than a neuter noun like in English. It's more of a translation error or oversight than an intentional statement, I believe. While it could very well be a she, it's generally referred to as an it, so I don't see why they'd change that now.
---
True. Whenever someone got a "normal" ruin check,
---
EVERYONE
---
Need to stop repairing. Every second repairing with 0 progress is just an unneeded risk to get another skillcheck.
---
Worst case scenario:
---
Gen is at 50%. One person got ruin check, bam 45%. No progress. 1 or 2 sec into nonprogress next person gets skillcheck, bam down to 40%  ... etc.
---
True
---
I let survior through hatch cause he had ttv in his name and did not teabag me a single time during the match. He earned it.
---
Camaraderie, BT, DS, Unbreakable, Dead Hard, WGLF, Head On, Bond, Deliverance, etc.  All of these perks can help a camp situation just do gens and work as a team to unhook
---
I am callin r/emojipolice you gonna get arrested
---
I have never seen anyone call Legion mid-tier post-nerf
---
Legion is not the worst because bubba exists. Legions power not only keeps people injured but also can kick people off gens. Basically hes got a one shot like bubba except he also has gen pressure. 
---
Mid tier is a huge exaggeration for legion though. He is still incredibly low tier, but not the worst.
---
noed is literally adrenaline for killers, so no its not toxic
---
Operation Health :D
---
&gt;Camaraderie
---
Only works if a teammate is gonna try to save you or if they're near the hook. Doesn't counter Camping. Buys time for the team to accommodate for 1 less person on a gen. 
---
&gt;BT, DS,
---
Both have counters. Slugging, hooktrading. 
---
&gt;Unbreakable
---
Only counters slugging and if used in case of DS counter most killers camp the slug. 
---
&gt;WGLF
---
We're gonna farm forever (ftfy) and it doesn't do anything. 
---
&gt;Head On,
---
Who the fuck walks into Head on range with a survivor in tow?
---
&gt;Bond
---
Omegalul. 
---
&gt;Deliverance
---
Doesn't counter camping.
---
big yikes
---
Lol where the hell are you finding someone that calls him mid tier? He’s still garbage and can’t really do anything post nerfs. They got rid of his one real strategy because people thought it was annoying not because it was particularly broken.
---
No, but in that case I wouldnt have blamed him.
---
Well that is pretty douchey, but doesn't warrant the "GTFO", in addition, as people have mentioned maybe they wanted to try new lobbies and servers. Also when me and my friend were playing the PTB most survivors who were DC'ing DC'ed because we weren't the new killer
---
I would save them for a character in the Stranger Things DLC, or if you buy the whole DLC use it for  cosmetics.
---
&gt; No its just the only perks I typically run into. Playing high rank you literally see those perks more often than not.
---
you're rank 10
---
Personally, I don’t think that this idea will work.
---
What’s to stop both survivors and killers from dodging every game until they get the map that they want? As a survivor I would dodge every The Game/Hospital map. As a killer I’d dodge the Disturbed Ward, Swamp maps, and Yamaoka Estate. Why play a game I know I’m gonna hate, ya feel?
---
I get what you’re saying though and I do wish they’d change up the lobby situation. I always thought that while it made sense for survivors to not know who the killer is at first, it seemed unfair. But, survivors love to complain about dodging killers, but imagine how many survivors would dodge based on which killer someone is playing. So that kills my idea.
---
did you come for stranger things? if so this game is just a huge "fuck you" to everybody playing
---
ohh its showing the youtubers profile pic
---
&gt;Wasn’t the Huntress bugged to one-shot again? I’d be willing to bet that’s more why they DCed...
---
1 shots out of nowhere and hits going through survivors, hitting multiple if they were lined up.
---
That is a legit theory but most of them literally stuck around for post game chat to call me out for not playing Demogorgon.
---
This leads into my second idea: Killer Exhaustion Perks. Or better yet, Hex Exhaustion perks!
---
Neck snap
---
I don’t see the beam
---
I'm saying that because I use spine chill.
---
No killer has ever scared me more than myers. Turning a corner and having him in your face alreafy when you don't even know the killer yet is terrifying
---
I believe they're planned to be released with the Archive stuff, but we have no way of knowing when that'll actually happen. For now, they're just something we got to see a little sneak peek of in the leaked dev build.
---
Every time I bring Stake Out, I face a Myers....
---
well okay, but if they didnt have bt then they’ll just be unable to get out of the basement, so it counters the basement and it counters tunneling
---
You would only end up using 2 of the one time use perks and ds would most likely be available if the killer slugged you again.  I’m also only offering a loadout to solve your issue, that’s a meme build at best.  I don’t know how many campers you run into but I rarely can’t do anything about it. On top of that, the killer basically loses the game if he chooses to do that, unless your team is searching for ruin and not doing gens or failing to save and running away and self caring repeatedly.
---
lol how is a murky reagent bad
---
#):
---
Both perks increase vault speed
---
Love when that happens, saves so much time, and basically almost wins the game with a very early hook in the basement.
---
Whatever. If I had Ghostface I would exclusively try to startle Survivors with corner-peeks. He's adorable.
---
&gt;I’m also only offering a loadout to solve your issue,
---
My builds are stealth focused. I don't have to worry about getting camped bc a solid 70% of the time I avoid a chase altogether by staying hidden.
---
That is because a lot of the people want to play against the new killer hence the DC. I never DC but I am getting tired of the same Myers with the same build with OP add-ons and ebony Mori (3 times I have played against this guy)
---
&gt; how's this work out with multiple people working on a gen though?
---
survivors should 100 percent not work on the same gen when Ruin is up. It blows my mind that people do that
---
If you get them as a whole, I think you get a different variation of their shirts, like Steve’s and Nancy’s other variation shirts has rips and tears in them, but you can use the cells on cosmetics for characters you already have.
---
That's because Ghostface is a nerd crouch-walking and Michael is THERE.
---
You're gonna go against the same thing in the live servers. Consider it practice.
---
APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD
---
There are the cases where DS is used just to piss off the killer
---
I meant 1000 more than a dull totem
---
Hey op did you let the meg escape? Lol
---
Certanily it is. The basement should never be a walk in the park. I acknowledged your point, but in both discussions with you you're not acknowledging my points. I feel like you're either choosing not to or maybe there's miscommunication.
---
Lmaooo I love this 😂
---
I normally like to tunnel and camp toxic survivors who t-bag and then complain about me being toxic back. Also you don't need to complain about DS or BT or especially pallet looping a way to play the game right, you should be grateful for the little amount of survivors who actually know how to play the game and loop.
---
Man I'd love to see a RE character I'm DBD (specially Leon)
---
MEH
---
-Nea
---
The new killer is literally 9/10 matches on the PTB, if you're so impatient that you can't wait for a non-demogorgon match to be over maybe you need to do something about it
---
Damn it took me like 6 play overs to catch the breathing, spidey senses
---
Using in-game addons/offerings =/= toxic
---
No I won't. It is like every survivor that isn't playing Nancy/Steve has a insta heal or a key. No where near as many get used in normal DBD. I have seen over 10 Mori's used today and about 40 keys or insta heals.
---
Then he drops you on the hatch and closes it instantly, proceeding to murder your ass with a cypress mori.
---
Does working with friends actually slow down gens then? Assuming they're also getting Goods.
---
I guess there's also Unnerving Presence and Huntress' Lullaby sometimes.
---
I’d just toss the entire pc out lol
---
Okay, first off we’ve been going at it for a bit so let me say, no hard feelings it’s just a game that we love, but, I am a survivor that has no issues extending chases for full games most trials.  I have experience juking, mindgaming and from my own personal experience I don’t see camping as an issue, I don’t think that there’s any way to remove it from the game either, and adding mechanics that make it even harder for the killer to succeed just seems unfair, this is coming from a S main
---
What if you have no interest in the new perks? My build on PTB was the same from live, I just added Inner Strength because the other perks were underwhelming or just didn't interest me.
---
Each 100 player levels earns you a devotion
---
Shame the weapon doesn't look the same as it does in the promo art.
---
I just assumed there was some jank at work and it would refill faster after the 2 seconds.
---
Look at it like the current ds. It's a perk that will usually change the game when it activates. A killer doesn't know if a survivor is running it, but he may choose to slug or not even down the unhooked survivor even though it puts him at a small disadvantage. Killers are perfectly fine doing that when a lot of the time survs may not even be running ds.
---
no. In purple Killers get easily more than 2K. It's not balanced at all before rank 3.
---
&gt; The basement should never be a walk in the park
---
No, it shouldn't. Which is why they use perks to counter it. The basement shouldn't also be such a concern for killers and you seem way too intent on using it
---
&gt; but in both discussions with you you're not acknowledging my points.
---
you're just crying about being countered. there's nothing to acknowledge
---
But hey! It's fun when it happens
---
It is not that. It is every match that isn't a Demogorgon match there is a Mori and iridescent add-ons.
---
How about buying some dignity instead of overpriced store items?
---
Using Cells for characters is a waste of money. You essentially spend double the real $$ compared to just buying the DLC.
---
You are right, the Spirit truly needs a fix
---
I see what you did there. Not let me escort you to the door for that.
---
When his character was turned away from the killer but his camera wasn’t there is a delay for the flashlight because the survivor’s character has to turn around to use it
---
I love this even the end mmm whatcha say 😂😂😂
---
What? No, I checked that series; the mask sucked and the plot was My Bloody Valentine, instead.
---
Look at it closer you can see the beam for a split second.
---
You mean r/dbdgonewild?
---
That is fine, I don't expect you not to play the PTB if you wanna test things. But don't use all your OP items because you will get them back at the end of PTB.
---
Maybe for each event, change the trap texture into something else from the franchise. (RBT, Venus flytrap, shotgun collar.) just an idea
---
Sir, I am not crying but I value respect and decency  during my discussions. 
---
I use basement hook to change momentum of game if need be after ruin is destroyed.
---
I just wish people wouldn't body block the person who saved cause that's the person I want to hang next. I hope I dont continue to see this as I increase rank.
---
I personally enjoy Pig and Nightmare but I know Myers and GF are also fun. Really all the licensed killers are fun at low ranks and most are fun at high(except cannibal)
---
Pennywise should shapeshift. 
---
He should appear as a random killer to each player until he hooks them then should be able to appear as that hooked player until they get unhooked. Once you’ve been hooked as a survivor you appear to other survivors as pennywise in clown form with red light and everything.
---
people bitch about unbreakable? a perk that probably comes in handy like once every 4 games?
---
Uhm, have you seen dbdgonewild?
---
Cringe
---
The third season is called Scream Resurrection and ignores the first two. It has the iconic Ghostface mask and also sucks too.
---
The PTB is like fun for 5 minutes, see the new killer/survivor, try them out with their respective perks and get a feel for them, then nope out of there.
---
Otherwise it turns into a toxic pit on both sides. Killers play normal killers and use all their saved toxic stuff, survivors do the same and it's more of a DBD wet dream.
---
Oh, you know what I mean. Someone spamming flashlight, vaults, disarming every trap for their lower-rank teammates, and I don't have every single perk on every single Killer like everyone assumes you do around here, not that I could change after starting, so don't give me the high horse. There aren't always walls around when you down someone, and I sure did my best to use one when I did.
---
I didn't feel like getting bullied all game, so I didn't. Derankers aren't entitled to my misery.
---
Sorry, I took it as you were bragging about the DC, not that you felt remorseful. Just miscommunication
---
Its literally better to completely ignore hex ruin until you find the hex totem.
---
It only adds a few seconds to each generator and if anyone is half decent at looping the killer you will still power through them in under 5 minutes. 
---
You dont need to have godlike reactions, you dont need to play perfectly, you just need to do gens and you will escape and there is nothing the killer can do.
---
Doctogorgon doesn't exist, he can't hurt you
---
Doctogorgon:
---
Do briefly stop while you can see sparks flying, though! That halts progression but can still trigger a skillcheck
---
That's what Doctogorgon wants you to think
---
Imagine putting down someone for their personal play style
---
Tbh I try to find all the totems anyway just in case the killer is using NOED as an end game crutch. I’m sure we’ve all seen many would-be perfect games turn into a 2 or 3 survivor sacrifice because of NOED and it just feels so unearned after outplaying the killer so well the whole game
---
Next level up, DbD is the Identity V at home.
---
The level after that, you go get a fun game.
---
I actually forgot about this. A battle pass is going to be great for this game tbh, more money more content!
---
If you’re asking about the genre; it’s mostly psychological thriller with some paranormal activities. It’s a classic and I honestly would recommend it. It has hiding and chasing too. The build up is amazingly well done too.
---
Yeah, the PTB isn't just a demo, it's a "stress test" for new content
---
It is a meme Dude, get over yourself. I am just saying after the same Myers with the same build and Mori 3 times today I am sick and tired of it. I have no problem with Demogorgon' bringing Mori's at all. I have a problem with people using the PTB as a reason to be as toxic as possible. It isn't just my experience either. I have seen loads of survivors do the same thing to killers too.
---
why are your words black only?
---
THATS RACIST
---
lol funny and true!
---
spine chill gives 6% action speed (which includes vaulting) when the killer is looking at you within the required range
---
Netflix buys streaming rights to other shows and slaps Netflix Original on them for international releases. 
---
Riverdale is a Netflix Original internationally but is a CW produced show. Titans is a Netflix original internationally as well but was actually made for DC’s streaming service in the states. 
---
Scream Resurrection is the third season to the MTV show but because it switched from MTV to VH1 for broadcasting Netflix doesn’t have the rights to stream it so it only has the first two seasons.
---
Don't put your dick in that
---
Imagine being mad at someone for actually using a viable strat to handicap the rest of the survivors, like the killer is supposed to.
---
Well, it IS a mobile game. But they didn't fix infinites, allow closing the hatch, or add a collapse timer, so right now bullying is even more powerful.
---
I dont think most people take it that seriously dude
---
the only reason i use noed is to counter tbaggers so just dont be a douche and noed shouldnt effect you
---
Apparently they came to an agreement to use DbD's core gameplay, which is why it's such a clone, but there's no ongoing partnership.
---
You know what I mean. 
---
Noed is just a signal that someone is a noob. It's like people that use self care still. It kinda tells a lot about them.
---
Myself and two others working on a gen, one of them fails a skill check and they both point at me. Damn.
---
The only exception to that is if someone has prove thyself or leader which theoretically increases gen speed sufficiently to make it still acceptable to work on the gen
---
Yeah, if you rolled him. Most people didn't.
---
Would anyone like team up on PC? Just for fun :)
---
Thank you for the clarification kind stranger 😊 Makes sense
---
Did she do the motion capture for demogorgon?
---
What weird-ass nice Survivors are you finding?
---
&gt; Sir, I am not crying but I value respect and decency during my discussions.
---
You're crying.
---
&gt; I use basement hook to change momentum of game if need be after ruin is destroyed.
---
Ruin dependency is bad. You only really need to to establish starting map pressure
---
&gt; I just wish people wouldn't body block the person who saved cause that's the person I want to hang next.
---
how dare they not let you injure their teammates
---
I personally think if they did license him, he would have a power relating to the Overlook or something. But I think your suggestion is an awesome idea too!
---
Yeah his power is kinda broke ATM, can be staring right at him and it doesn't reveal him other times you reveal him through walls. That's been my experience with it anyways.
---
You want an op build. Mad grit. Agitation. Iron grasp. Thrilling tremors. You’ll have the enemy super confused chasing down a survivor while carrying a survivor. SWF group? Easy 4 man down when they think they’re gonna do a pro gamer move body block on hook. I’ve never lost a match using this. I’m rank 16 so you know it’s good.
---
Sure, it's a perk that makes it significantly easier to get at least one kill on an ended game. I think stating that it's a sign of "weakness" and "insecurity" as a killer is maybe looking into it a bit much, but go off my man
---
Hmmm never saw it that way
---
Thank you, but I a Blendette hide in tall grass in front of the Killer. Then I just get smacked cause I accidentally sneezed.
---
Jack would actually be a good Killer.
---
Thats the same question I have for you.
---
Funny, did laugh!
---
Kind of ruined by the fact that you run NOED on Billy.
---
Chances are if they're toxic in the PTB, they're toxic outside the PTB, the PTB doesn't have to be just brown/yellow addons and one perk slot, treat it as you would the live servers but with new content. I also think you need to get over yourself telling people to get the fuck out of the PTB if they're not testing any new content actively
---
Ascended gamers eat pizza and drink Belle Delphine Bath Water.
---
Isn’t this supposed to be Freddy he looks like a bottom bitch
---
Double engravings and he knows how to curve, way worse
---
Imagine actually wanting to test new stuff out in the ptb that is meant to teat new stuff out
---
This is a great meme template.
---
How do you use noed to counter tea baggers when you haven’t even entered the game to experience their teabagging
---
I just run small game usually
---
Neither is more camouflaged since they dont do anything to change the color of what they are on.
---
an apple a day keeps the doctogorgen away
---
да, это время большой мозг
---
People already cleanse haunted because you don’t know what hex it could be
---
Double engravings and a billy who knows how to curve, way worse
---
XD oof. I can almost feel the Thomas has never seen such bull shit emotions that ghost face was feeling
---
Oh i stealth asap. It’s more when I’m approaching survivor A on a gen, I think Survivor B is behind me looking. So it’s not like the one I’m stalking is seeing me. By the time I turn around and find cove I’m out.
---
Maybe but I wanted to see if a memey super speed vault would work before I invest!
---
It keeps him away half of the time
---
So true, I always feel like I need 5 perks on GF. I was considering Corrupt Intervention too. 120 sec at the beginning of the trial + Ruin gives a lot of time to find at least 2 survivors.
---
Demogorgon be like "oh shit here we go again"
---
Is what new?
---
welp you're an actual fucking idiot
---
Hey do you have any more salt? My foods a little bland :/
---
That happens to me all the time. Except then they hook me right next to it and then close it.
---
Not anymore, this was changed in the Legion update
---
everyone else is wrong. this is the government trying to communicate with you
---
also you're linking my post but like, did you even read it? or did you just assume its salty upon seeing the word "keys"
---
In all fairness, FOV of a the killer literally doesn't allow to see people that sit right under their feet. LITERALLY.
---
I don’t want the killers to be at a disadvantage but at the same time, 2 iridescent add ons and a ebony is going to make me want to not play pretty quick
---

Boi you came to the right place. Here. *Sharp Inhale*. 
---
FUCKING CRUTCH PERK NOED CAMPING TUNNELLING KILLER I HOPE YOU DIE IRL I FUCKED UR MOM UR MUM GAY KYS LMAO WHO USES RUIN FUCK YOU FACECAMPING DICKMUNCHER!
---
I don't even get his dlc and the times I heard the last survivor played was p3 david
---
I recommend to check your immediate area before continuing with gen. I see it all the time where the totem is literally right beside the gen but the survivor didn't rotate the camera and see it.
---
most survivors tbag at exit gates so i bring noed to shut it down before it begins
---
I play with my friend. If he brings a burrito he looks, otherwise I run around with my Small Game. If you see someone else running around looking for it, just do gens while they do.
---
Sometimes it feels like I vault things really slow when I’m holding shift. Why is that?
---
How do I drop somebody as the killer?
---
Is there a way to get out of cabinets faster?
---
Should I get head on from the shrine to combine it with my quick and quiet or keep using lithe?
---
Finally, when is the stranger things update supposed to come out?
---
Thanks y’all!
---
pretty sad that people have to resort to this type of immersion breaking bullshit tbh...
---
I had it on an older laptop, 20 fps average, no way to do consistent great skillchecks, ruin is pay to win bullshit imo
---
Pretty sure Jane has an orgasm.
---
Just listen to yourself ... yikes. Why don’t we just go abort all children to shut crime down before it begins?
---
17th probably but that’s just a guess
---
His strategy wasn't tunneling one person in frenzy, but stab as many people as he can during one frenzy. Him being better in former pre rework was more of a byproduct than desired effect.
---
He just looks so dissapointed
---
Killer instinct what pinging what? You mean when I’m spotted?
---
I think whispers is counter productive. I approach a gen making noise, I am in cover, and I’m still getting spotted. In his situation the whispers would be going off because someone is on the Gen. so there are 2 survivors on this situation. I’d need to run From the survivors to know if I’m being followed.
---
Ussylis is by far the most efficient looper of all of the youtubers i have watched or seen, check him out
---
Spirit Beads
---
I'll check it out, thanks!
---
Not much can be better than being able to ignore every map element and being extremely mobile. That’s why Nurse will always be in her own tier.
---
People disagree about who’s the worst killer now because all the contenders are various flavours of bad. Anyone calling Legion mid tier is wrong though in my opinion, Legion is one of the weakest.
---
Ghost in the game. The fog speaks to you
---
My favs are fungoose, tru3talent, and pain reliever
---
That's magic of scratched mirror Myers.
---
My rule is if you don’t wiggle (and I’m not trying to do something) I’ll give hatch. Not everyone does it, but it’s something nice I like to try
---
When a generator explodes from a failed skill check or sizzles from Hex: Ruin progress is halted for a couple seconds.
---
1. Does working on the gen while it's halted make it recover any faster or is it useless? 
---
2. If I'm using a toolbox while it's halted will it still consume charges?
---
I was just referring to them as a Netflix series because thats how I watched em, wasn’t saying they were as seen from this whole thread, no need to downvote lmao
---
Step 1: Run out of the exit gate to save a man
---
Step 2: Give them your key and lead them to hatch
---
Step 3: Go save the other man after securing the first
---
Step 4: Make it back home soldier
---
if you listen carefully you can hear michaels heavy breating in the background as they aren't looking.
---
Imagine his freak out when he hears "look who's shitting in the tall grass"
---
Oh my fucking god these killed me. OP, did you make this?
---
You can hear the faintest of a breaths from OP when he sees Michael and it screams "HOLY SHIT MY HEART IS GOING TO EXPLODE!"
---
Dang I always thought with Ruin, it's just faster overall to single repair. So I always run to another gen if someone comes over and I or the other guy keeps missing skill checks.
---
I like the idea, but I also feel that this will end up being like a lower tier, even with the strength of a portable hook, a stun causing a killer to lose his rank basically means he would be useless at higher ranks with DS, Wiggle, Pallet Stuns, Flashlight saves, etc
---
I think changing him to be a potential stalker while tinkering with how it works will be a lot more effective 
---
Power remains mostly the same, but instead of it being an interaction akin to doctor, it works much the same as a stalk
---
Allow him to teleport to a locker at any point, BUT, as he tiers up he will gain different bonuses as well as letting survivors experience his stuff
---
When Pennywise enters a locker there will be a loud notification, probably giggling that changes based on the Fear factor of the survivor
---
Pennywise will tier up based on how many times he has scared survivors, he will essentially be a mix of Myers, and Doctor 
---
Scaring survivors increases their debuffs, whereas it increases his power, he will gain the bonuses regardless of the survivors, If a survivor in Tier 1 sees a PW in Tier 3, the survivor will see a Tier 3 PW, but they will not be able to see balloons
---
Tier 1 - Very decreased heartbeat, some lowered stats to compensate, on "stalking" a survivor that survivors camera is slowly turned towards Pennywise, as the stalk continues the heartbeat will continue to get louder and louder, after a short time the survivor will have their camera ripped towards PW and he will gain a large bonus to his Tier meter, the survivor will then hear a cackle that will change based on how far into his power PW is. 
---
In this state he still appears like a clown, pretty normal 
---
Afflicted Survivors cannot see balloons within this state, nor can they interact with the balloons 
---
Lockers will glow with faint eyes, and faint giggling will be heard from the locker PW is in, as well as the occasional shuffling ( like the doors opening or closing slowly ) 
---
Tier 2 - Slightly reduced heartbeat, mediocre stats, "stalking" goes a lot faster and causes a jump scare noise on the survivor, the same stuff still applies as tier one in terms of fear
---
Slightly disfigured, limbs jerking or maybe too long, mouth slightly agape 
---
Afflicted Survivors will now see balloons and they can now be "interacted with", on coming too close to a balloon it will pop, giving the loud noise notification, as well as causing blood to fly on the screen like a hit sound 
---
When Pennywise enters a locker any locker near a survivor within tier 2 will have the effect of Pennywise being in a locker ( think freddy add - on ) 
---
Survivors who aren't afraid can help their terrified allies by doing something similar to waking up,
---
Tier 3 - Larger heartbeat, slightly increased stats ( like 116% base speed or something, just enough for him to be slightly stronger than base ) you can still fear a survivor and this will cause a heartbeat to be on them at full volume, as well as manipulating the red stain to appear behind you ( not based off of your screen, instead based off of your rotation ) a fear at this point will essentially cause your survivor to scream
---
Balloons will now slowly float in small circles ( essentially causing more areas for coverage ) 
---
All lockers will shake and the giggling will be heard when teleporting ( for tier 3 survivors ) 
---
Tier 3 survivors can "Get a hold of themselves" which is essentially a method of calming themselves down much like with doctor, this will be much like how people playing against Plague or Freddy can choose to ignore the afflictions 
---
Pennywise can use a special interaction on Dying targets when he is in tier 3, this will be a 10ish second interval where Pennywise makes survivors float, floating survivors are essentially hooked but move through their sacrifice with a slightly decreased timer ( takes less time before they die ) you can try to " wake yourself up " which is essentially struggling, your teammates won't be able to see your aura as strongly like this ( it will be dimmer ) and it will take them longer to "unhook" their allies, all of these will be very slight, but enough to incentivize PW players into using their own Float over normal hooks. The Entity will be summoned from above ( think of how you get killed ) and will grab you once the sacrifice is complete, the struggle phase will still be a quick time, but will essentially be you attempting to fight back mentally as you watch the entity slowly approach you, this will aptly be called "remain calm" or something of the sort 
---
This will essentially create a gameplay where survivors are trying their best to survive against what is aptly, a power far beyond anything they should be able to survive, but if they face their fears they will make it through, and yeah sorry if stuff is jumbled lol
---
You need to keep an eye when vaulting while holding shift, if the prompt comes up as "running vault" then you will fast vault. These are relatively easy to obtain once you learn how to angle your vaults properly, if angled in correctly you will be caught in the medium vault animation which is much slower than a fast vault but still faster than a slow vault
---
Not sure as I don't play on PC but I'm pretty sure it's R to drop a survivor
---
Hold shift while exiting cabinets/lockers to exit faster but be aware this alerts the killer
---
Head on is a good perk but very situational, I recommend picking it up and testing it for yourself and make a decision yourself as it depends on your playstyle. It's a really good perk with Quick and Quiet.
---
The PTB ends soon so it's usually a week after so the Strangers things Dlc should hopefully be out around the 17th. Don't quote me on that though
---
Hope I helped :)
---
Check out my post history. I main killer and I think survivors are total whiny ass babies
---
but nice try, sport
---
I know right, what's the point of sitting around waiting for the hatch on the ptb. Most of the Steves and Nancys have been fun to play against because they seem to want to be on the ptb to use it as the ptb.
---
Funny thing about the Blendette was, I found her almost immediately, so much for stealth. XD
---
Thx bro
---
You play as you want, you can play preyer beads spirit, your ways doens't change the fact that you are being a scummy person
---
Trying to play killer more and I really like hag, but I am struggling with getting gen rushed into oblivion as I figure her out. What gen slowing perks would you recommend on her? Is corrupt intervention any good?
---
Any particular addons of hers more noob friendly?
---
The problem with Doc is his skill gap is too big for being a mediocre killer at best. A really, really good Doc will still be sooo much weaker than a good Nurse or even Billy
---
Loved that ending.
---
You have clearly not been around for very long
---
Pig. :\
---
Small game gang rise up
---
But they can tho. Once the gates are powered just attack the lever
---
Worst of all, it does fit the character. they should really add it.
---
Huh. I could have sworn Dull Totems were 500. Then again, I don't really pay attention to the numbers that pop up, I tend to focus on the environment and trying to not get stabbed
---
The most fun I ever have with killer is when I’m high. It just relieves so much tension so I don’t really have to stress whether or not I’m getting kills
---
I have been around for ~1 year so i may not know everything. Care you explain why you assumed this?
---
\*BOOONNGGG\* iron maiden
---
Dying light is getting reworked literally because devs don't agree with the way that the actuall dying light Works, the devs literally don't agree with the OP's playstyle, you don't need to whitknight everyone
---
That's an issue of Nurse and Billy being too strong, not Doc being too weak. Don't make him easier and more rewarding.
---
I have said I have NO PROBLEM with Demogorgon players using a Mori, I think the new Mori is awesome. I have a problem with people using the PTB as an excuse to be as toxic as possible.
---
Peep the meg bouncing off the edge right before you do lol
---
Oh no
---
Guess you're playing with a full premade team uh? Have you ever tried soloing or duo? 90% of the people playing can't either loop the killer or doing hex gens. If you're playing with randoms you're gonna lose the game if you don't get the ruin down in the first 2 mins. I'm talking about Red ranks.
---
halloween?
---
I noticed the old lady the first time I saw the movie and none of my friends did. It was probably the creepiest scene in the movie tbh.
---
Who chases a single survivor for 110 seconds!?
---
Her traps took a pretty big nerf. They don’t activate until the next generator is completed. If the trap is put on after the last generator is completed, it will never explode. It was when End Game was added, but it was really a pointless nerf to an already meh killer
---
A while back I spent some time figuring out how long in actually takes to work through ruin while hitting only the good skill checks. Here are some [results](https://imgur.com/a/eoXPAZ7) from a simulation of completing 10 million generators. That being said, the ultimate way to counter ruin is to git gud and just hit the skill checks.  
---
  
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
A quick blurb about the confusion on this topic: At an 8% chance to proc a skill check per second, most people figure that you get about 6 skill checks per gen. The problem is that each missed skill check adds time and allows the opportunity for the game to generate additional skill checks. Not only does missing a skill check cause regression, but it also disables the gen from receiving repair progress for about 3 seconds. This makes it quite a difficult problem to solve analytically, which is ultimately why I did a simulation instead. It was far easier for me to write a python program to simulate this in like half an hour than it would have been for me to solve analytically.
---
~80 seconds per gen standard
---
~4 seconds lost for a good skill check with ruin tier 3
---
~100 seconds for a gen with ruin and 5 good skill checks 
---
~14 seconds to cleanse a totem
---
If you manage to have 2 people doing gens while 2 keep the killer busy, even if you leave ruin up and get 10 good skill checks per generator (which would be very unlucky), it takes about 5 minutes to do all the gens (not including travel time)
---
You'd be surprised.
---
Lol you brought up unbreakable 😂 
---
Adrenaline, reward for doing gens. 
---
DS, anti tunnel
---
Borrowed time, anti camp
---
And honestly, how often do you ever see an Instaheal or a key?  Rarely ever see that shit in my games.  Most of my games people go in without shit. 
---
But hey, if you need your crutch perk because you did trash, by all means.
---
Surviviors can take the exit gates with an inactive trap on their head
---
My mistake, the wiki said it gave an increase
---
Actually breaking a chase is very difficult, see impossible. Instead what you want to is to make chase last as long as possible so the Killer gives up himself. Learn shack looping, T wall looping, Pallet looping, etc.
---
This is literally the first result that Google produces when you search "Stranger Things Steve Babysitter."
---
Iron Will and Urban Evasion: the ultimate stealth combo.
---
Lightweight too if you wanna go the extra mile.
---
That’s man doesn’t abide by “Juss a lil bit”
---
Alright, but you did include 10 moris in your comment, but yeah it could also be how a player uses the mori.
---
The killer think youre so hot they cant take their eyes off you
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d29vwx/ui_bug_on_ps4/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
This is the good wholesome side of the community, apologizing to each other because they thought they sounded rude to each other, I love it
---
And then proceeds to call NOeD a crutch perk
---
The game has been through tons and tons and tons of utterly game breaking bugs. From 2 killers being in 1 game to being able to get in lots of unreachable places with dead hard to being able to get the killer stuck in a hole for the rest of the game.
---
They are finding tons of stuff every patch and the game is not in a place where it's actually not a bug fest. 
---
Yes they need to continue but they are continuing. 
---
I think saying they are not fixing enough bugs is a stretch.
---
Behaviour be like *making a functional video game noises.*
---
Imagine this scenario
---
I hook you, get out because ain't nobody got time to camp unless you want to lose.
---
You get saved, I down another survivor and then somehow find you again right away because you're either bad or unlucky.
---
Are you saying I'm supposed not to chase you because I hooked you recently?
---
This is a simple sort of question, will we get to have Quentin's original head model as an optional cosmetic if Kyle GallnerR's likeness is added?
---
I actually really like his appearance, and I've grown to think of him as The DBD universes true Quentin. Same with all the licensed characters. It's the dbd iteration. Not an actor.
---
Maybe a hacker, but there are also many bugs that could let that happen
---
I'm told I'm legit scary as Freddy. I know how to use his powers and catch survivors off guard constantly. I don't camp basement and don't focus my attention on basement. If I get someone down there, I'll lay traps hinder them one way or the other, forcing blindness, bleeding, etc with up to 60 seconds, giving me enough time to worry about them later. And if I don't get to them, oh well, I'm on another survivor or kicking a gen and I will find them. Because I will get them.
---
I'd like for them to skip a few chapters in order to "rerelease" some of the weaker ones. Demise of the Faithful was a failure, Pig and Tapp have some iffy perks, Quentin could use a rework to accompany Freddy... As hyped as I am for Stranger Things we don't need more characters bogging down the game.
---
No they are fixing enough bugs but i feel they could push out more patches if they have extra people, AKA Not doing s content update so they can move more developers onto bug fixing/finding.
---
I wouldn’t enjoy it, but it would be a good update either way.
---
If Nurse, Billy or Spirit we’re considered too strong, they would have already been nerfed. They have been in the game forever now so we have to assume that is the standard for the strongest killers. Like I said, the skill gap for Doc (imho hardest killer to master) is very high for being a “meh” killer at best
---
Buffing Doc won’t make him OP, and my suggestion is merely a suggestion. We want to see more variety at red ranks, not just the top 3.
---
The fact that you think I would try to stealth around and not be aware of nearby loops (and the fact that you think you can see through fucking objects people are using to stealth your ass) is ironically what makes your own words apply to you. Not me. 
---
But nice try! Also - of course you're a chainsaw user, haha.
---
I wish i could play against a myers. Still havent had the chance too
---
\*puts in basement instead.\*
---
Baby Dweet: OH SHI-
---
Nurse is getting nerfed and has been nerfed. 
---
Spirit needs nerfed and so does Billy.
---
The edge from this hurt me so bad I'm in the dying state, but fr good cosplay man!
---
Running prove thyself too
---
Spirit beads
---
No to most of these changes.
---
Tenacity is lowkey super strong.
---
I know you're not using it. I just felt the need to say it.
---
T wal?
---
Killers and survivors don't deserve anything. It is pretty silly to make etiquette for a game about blood thirsty killers and people trying to survive. Both sides need to accept that people will either escape or get killed while playing this game and accept it.
---
Yeah I know sorry didn’t really make that clear - I still think killers should be able to pinpoint people using their headphones however.
---
Yes, as a SWF group, it's easy to keep track of how many totems have been cleansed. Then it's just a matter of looking around a bit while you run from one gen to the next.
---
But, if this sub hasn't stressed this fact enough: **This game is not balanced around SWF.**
---
If the survivors are anything less than a 3-man SWF, NOED is gonna pop. You just can't coordinate an efficient search effort that finds all of them, unless you spend so long not doing gens that you lose the game anyway. People know this, so they just don't bother. Which means NOED fails to accomplish what it was designed to do.
---
I mean, what else can you do with cypress moris
---
Don’t play the PTB then
---
What this guy said ^
---
Killers should be balanced around a certain threshold of effectiveness. When one exceeds that threshold, you don’t buff everything else to match, you tune it down a bit until it’s satisfying to play against. Otherwise you get power-creep and you make old killers kits’ ineffective.
---
That being said, Doc stun is already incredibly annoying to play against, I honestly think the lockout time should be &lt;VERY&gt; slightly reduced if anything.
---
(Would be a nice QoL update if the stun didn’t have a ~0.1 second delay before it actually stunned though, but that’s just a greedy ask from a filthy doc main)
---
You've been cocky our entire exchange so I'll pass this time.
---
Ruin combined with corrupt is strong. Add-ons that increase range and setting speed are strong.
---
Nurse isn’t getting nerfed, her add ons are. I’m not talking about add ons, I’m talking about base kit. And no Billy and Spirits base kits do not need nerfing either.
---
To bad i buy the chapters as soon as they release. Great sale for those who want different chapters.
---
Why is this even a gif?
---
Iron Maiden is pretty trash unless you're playing The Huntress and maybe The Doctor.
---
Hey i do the same thing! If you wiggle even once as the last survivor ill hook ya but if not im fine with giving you hatch.
---
I gave hatch to someone I accidentally ended up "tunneling" because his teammate set him up. 
---
I dropped him, got the teammate on hook, and since he didn't DC, I dropped him on hatch and teleported to another gen.
---
I moried another survivor who pointed out their teammate hiding in a locker. Knocked her down and moried her. Screw that toxic play.
---
No because they don't get their Mori's back. If they do it in the live game they never get that Mori back. If they are only in the PTB to be as toxic as possible (like the Myers I went up against 3 times or the ghost face in this situation) then they should get out of the PTB and do it in main game (but they won't because then they lose their offering).

Playing as Survivor. Game loaded into the 360 camera swoop and the name of the map (Blood Lodge, Autohaven Wreckers) appeared as normal. Once gameplay started the map name remained onscreen and no in-game UI appeared at all; no Survivor statuses, no button prompts, no skill check wheel, nothing. Completely rendered the game unplayable.
---
Reproduction rate of 0, never had this before.
---
If you don't think nerfing her add-ons is nerfing her then idk what to say. 
---
Spirit most definitely is too strong as is Billy. Billy should not be able to cross the entire map by doing the ever skillful act of holding M2 and have no cooldown to worry about. And Spirit should not be a dice roll of a chase.
---
What’s most? You think these killers are fine the way they are?
---
Woah! Also how do you only have two perks and a map?
---
Yeah, he killed her in every timeline.
---
How my supposed to play against the new killer then?
---
Wait for him to be on live lel
---
Oh, great. For a second I thought there was more Scream somewhere, but I guess it died with Wes Craven.
---
Not sure
---
No, it's September
---
haha
---
"shit i was wrong better act self-righteous and leave"
---
lmfao thanks for playing
---
Not rly, I play with IRL friends the most but thats not often.
---
I primarily play killer while solo but do play survivor solo when the killer queue times are particularly bad. 
---
Im talking more from experience that people these days just completely ignore hex ruin and still breeze through gens. If it takes me more than 30 seconds to catch someone its still a losing play for me because 3 more people are doing gens. If they keep 2 people on gens at all times it is while not impossible, significantly more difficult to win if they dont make a major mistake.
---
Perhaps its my fault that I let chases last that long but I really enjoy my myers and his chase game isnt great
---
Ever killer game us up against 2 instaheals and a key. It's like people like using really strong stuff without losing it.
---
Ain't got time to worry about ruin
---
This is exactly how I use freddy and basement then surveillance to put pressure on gens!
---
I ready your tag flair as Adept Hug, and that made me smile
---
I don't agree with any of these. They're like bandaid fixes.
---
This is true, but what I’ve always said is that you get an invisible bonus just for playing Doc, just like you do with Nurse/Spirit/(Legion? In 2019?). survivors hate facing some killers, either because they’re just amazing (Nurse, Spirit) or they’re super annoying (Doc, Plague, Legion? Question mark?)
---
It doesn’t come into play much at red ranks, but buffing him much would spell literal disaster for pre-green rank survivors imo
---
This is why i use decisive
---
You need to be running straight for 2.5 metres to do a fast vault instead of a medium vault.
---
Press E or the same button to drop items as a survivor.
---
Just sprint out of it..
---
Head on is a bit too niche to bother with but it is at least a fun perk and a surprise.
---
Later this month for sure
---
I donno man, i play on PC and if the killer DC's you dont lose items. You never have.
---
Can I ask why this sub so big on leader? It doesn’t help on gens just everything else. I try to run 2-3 team perks per game and recently took leader off cause I felt it didn’t help the team enough.
---
How the hell did he do any of what he just did
---
In the words of the assholes on the DBD Discord:
---
&gt;JUST HIDE :4head:
---
My salt about the awful Discord community aside: when the Killer gets locked in an animation (breaking a pallet, vaulting a window, getting stunned, heck even when they hit you) try to take the time to duck behind some cover. The Killer's first person perspective can make it very hard to see a Survivor who's right in front of them.

Urban Evasion (perk from Nea) and *especially* Iron Will (perk from Jake) are very good to help you hide. Iron Will in particular will save you more times than you can imagine, since the pained grunts a Survivor makes when injured is one of the main ways a Killer can find you when you try to hide mid-chase.
---
Don't focus on 360s too often. It gets featured in montages often but it's usually used as a last-ditch effort by a Survivor. Instead focus on learning how to loop pallets and windows better. Learn when to drop a pallet or when to get greedy. Recognizing Killers who respect pallets too heavily can really help you extend chases.
---
I’m told I’m slow(mentally) as Freddy. Great times.🙃
---
In-Game
---
When a Survivor d/cs the other Survivors recieve no bloodpoint penalties and the Killer is in fact given the 'Quitter' bloodpoints at the end of the game.
---
When the Killer d/cs the Survivors lose ALL bloodpoints gained in the match.
---
Happens EVERY time a Killer d/cs.
---
Survivors should keep what bloodpoints they had earned in the trial up until the Killer d/cing.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Oh no I haven’t checked in a while...
---
Yeah, the new remake
---
Thoughts on why? I agree, but at least contribute something luv. Op has a decent ground for discussion at the very least.
---
Try sticking the corner of a sticky note in the center of this screen. This helps with revealing him. And also some killers, like huntress nurse, etc.
---
I don't know really. The recovery time on hitting objects seem to be either the same or a bit longer?
---
When I will never be against him because I am red ranks. I rarely see any killer that isn't Nurse/Billy/Spirit.
---
one joke
---
Don't use treatment mode at all until after your first hook. Survivors only scream from it when they level up madness and you want to be paying attention when it happens and not catch a group of them all at once. It will show you who comes in for the rescue first since the hooked survivor won't build madness.
---
Because I just said I’m talking about base kit. A killer should be playable without addons, and Nurse is still extremely strong without addons, as is Billy. You think everyone rolls around with a 17 blink Nurse? Come on man, ofc it’s getting changed. I don’t use add ons on either of these killers, ever. My buff ideas are to buff killers base kits to bring them closer together.
---
Second, If you really feel that strongly about Billy and Nurse being nerfed, then good for you. Go make a post on it, my post isn’t even directed towards Billy or Nurse.
---
It's not at all uncommon to get hit by DS after hooking someone else. It last for 60 seconds which is like 20 percent of the match.
---
Trust me, everyone will probably be using him for the first few days or weeks on live. My point was just enjoy the ptb no need to complain about items if people wanna fool around lol.
---
i'd assume it was a low ranked killer, too many chances for the killer to pull them out of the locker
---
I had a killer do this to me in a recent survivor game but we walked around for like a minute and he couldn't find it but if you're out there random Ghostface, I appreciate the intent
---
I'd put it on very strong on hag. Reduces her terror radius to 16m and pairs wicked strong with nurses calling. It's dumb the amount of times survivors have just walked right into me while running it on slappy grandma
---
True, but without mori good luck killing your obsession before all gens done. that's why this perk is trash and needed a rework.
---
I think that change to Doc would actually be way too strong
---
RBTs need to stay how they are. other two suggestions for her are mint tho
---
Is it normal to be grouped with 12-13 rank teams as a new killer? I've been playing survivor and generally killer was about same rank.
---
Decided to start learning killer and as a rank 20 nurse i'm constantly grouped with ~13 rank people, after suffering for 3 games i just want to lie down and cry :(
---
Also are there any streamers that main Nurse? It seems everyone and their mother is playing billy, huntress or spirit these days.
---
r/whoosh
---
yeah, but my issue with this is the game tends to know you are about to stop and does a skill check a second before i quit repairing and and then fails
---
How does spirits power work? When does she give a notification she is phasing?
---
This is the reason I moved skill checks to my mouse button, it's nice being able to have a free hand and also not accidentally slamming the space bar like an ape haha
---
A wall that’s shaped like a T and has a window vault. Can find a bunch of good tips on YouTube
---
If your on pc verify files. I used to get this everytime there was an update, so annoying
---
My idea with LF is since he lacks mobility or stealth, he could use a TR buff. He’s just a big buffoon running around the map right now. There shouldn’t be a “I’ll just play Billy instead” since he’s basically a weaker version of Billy atm.
---
With the Freddy buff, I just feel like Clown is yesterday’s news. If you’re a Clown main, do you honestly believe he’s fine the way he is?
---
And for Pig. Sure why not? If we give Pig the letter, she’s still gonna be much weaker than the top 3.
---
Wow. Relax man. Take a deep breath.
---
First of all, I said that this perk would go away after 60/70/75 seconds. There would be no “randomly switching to Adrenaline.”
---
Secondly, obviously any perks effects would disappear if you chose to replace it (such as deliverance).
---
Lastly, did you read what I said? You do EVERYTHING slower for the rest of the game, you move slower and are exposed for the next two minutes, and you can’t use items. That’s if you swap out four perks.
---
This was merely a suggestion. I’m more than receptive to constructive criticism; but not childish attacks.
---
It is definitely more of a fun than effective exhaustion perk, especially while new. I would focus on more reliable exhausting perks like lithe or sprint burst, then revisit head on once you are feeling more competent in the game.
---
&gt;Here comes the Trapper!  
---
&gt;You better watch out for his traps.  
---
&gt;You better don't step in his traps...
---
No, wait, pls do step in his traps!
---
The best add-ons I like to use are increase teleport range and either trap size increase, or an add-on that reveals survivor aura for 5 sec when they trip a trap
---
&gt; You're doing something wrong if you save her traps till the endgame.
---
not necessarily. end game amanda is a legit tactic. it's just that now you have to set it up sooner which isn't a big deal
---
People are massively overreacting to Legion's nerf. For one Leatherface exists, but excluding that they're still playable. They excel against teams that play together and can get downs pretty fast on more open maps.
---
Legion is personally in C- tier for me. C tier on my tier list means that the Killer's power has inherent weaknesses that make them harder to play consistently when compared to higher tier Killers. (Other Killers in this tier include Trapper and Wraith due to their setup time and decloak time respectively.) The minus is attributed to the fact that Legion really suffers due to RNG aspects. On larger maps or maps with a lot of windows they're a lot weaker than normal.
---
To be fair my perspective on Legion is skewed by the fact that I'm just *good at Legion.* r/humblebrag lol but I've always preferred playing low tier Killers, and actually main the likes of Legion, Clown, Trapper, and Wraith. I've never really had that much of a problem playing Legion which is why I don't really understand the hate towards them. I still find them very fun and effective. They're not Nurse obviously, but it feels great to win with a Killer most people expect not to do anything.
---
That's why dying light got reworked
---
100% true I'm just trying to see from other sides.
---
As a killer main. I always find it hilarious when survivors immediately call me trash when I get a 4k. Mostly because they always considered me camping. In your opinion what's the difference between camping and a tight patrol? Even though in this game camping is a legit strategy if not playing for pips.
---
I disagree. Her traps are activated after the next generator is completed. This affects her even before End Game is activates. The traps took a big nerf and lose a lot of their pressure because of this. They were already not good before the nerf, why make them worse? It was a pointless nerf is all I’m saying.
---
I like to think NOED is the killer's version of adrenaline, as in the last moments of a game everything you have at your disposal needs to be utilized to down either all or some of the remaining survivors, that and survivors tend to forget that NOED doesn't necessarily guarantee a kill.
---
Lol. Thanks for the gold fam.
---
eh myers doesn't rely on stealth to get to tier 3
---
My point is that DS is bullshit and I don't camp.
---
Unbreakable is the new ds.
---
FriskyNicks: DrPorkChops_: Nice meme
---
You should always give up on those guys instead of getting looped. Pick the other guys off to make it easier on you later. Face walls when  you pick people up and dont vault unless you have to. Its frustrating yes but killers can make the game just as unfun for survivors.
---
I’d be good with this too.
---
Your friends can get mad sure, but the actual problem is from their own gameplay rather than what the hillbilly did. It should definitely not happen that he gets everyone in that little time
---
That sounds cool, like each survivor can see different events that others cant
---
if you wanna do end game amanda just set it up at 1 gen. like it's barely a change at all
---
Is dbd mobile dailys  not loading for anyone else?
---
The problem with unbreakable is its literally useless if you don't face a slugger, and 80%+ of killers don't slug.
---
Also, i think the root issues isn't the slugging, its that this guy literally was able to end all of our chases really fast. Unbreakable would only have delayed our lost.
---
If a guy isn't able to end the chases fast, the slugs won't work.
---
He could have been just trying out different builds. I like to do that from time to time to mix it up. I have been trying to get all the perks on each killer so when I get the perks to run certain builds I do it. It makes the game more fun in my opinion to try new styles, builds, plays, etc. Try not overthink it each time a killer, or survivor for that matter plays a certain way. It could just be them trying out new or fun things for them.
---
And I'm happy about it.
---
Just definitely not because "devs didn't like that playstyle".
---
Blade is much bigger in the concept image lol.
---
I am deceased
---
It's all about context,
---
As far as toxicity: nothing is toxic with slugging inherently, the only time it's toxic is when the killer does it when everyone alive is slugged and purposely doesn't hook them as he wants to be an ass and waste their time after he has already won. That's the only time it's toxic
---
As far as it's effectiveness: I mean a killer can do it, just in my opinion the only time it's actually effective is when there are two survivors left and you slug one so the other can't escape through hatch. That's effective.
---
What's not effective, in my opinion, is what the killer you faced did. You only get one hook on everyone and he likely caused everyone including himself to de-pip due to a lackluster game.
---
[I made a crappy guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1547234731) and while I'm obviously not flawless when it comes to my judgment I tried my best to write an objective guide based on tier lists. With that in mind on subject of licensed characters:
---
* Michael Myers is very fun and strong, ~~but Laurie is also good so tbh I'd just recommend buying the DLC outright.~~ Seeing as you already have Laurie I would honestly recommend buying Michael.
---
* Freddy is very strong now after his rework. He's also very fun and has a good amount of perks. Quentin not so much so...
---
* Pig and Tapp are both mid tier. Tapp is a good Survivor for beginners though as his perk Stakeout can really help against Hex: Ruin.
---
* Don't buy Ash unless you want him for cosmetic reasons. His perks are trash.
---
So as far as licensed characters go I'd suggest either Freddy or Michael. Buy the SAW Chapter on a sale or something.
---
Or just hold onto those Cells and buy yourself a nice hat or something.
---
Scream 3?! Where can i watch it?!
---
The external wiki covers her power in far greater detail than I could here.
---
As for the other question - if the survivor is outside her Terror Radius when she starts to Phase, they'll hear her.
---
Right next to the Laurie too? What is this madness?   
---
I see that Quentin eyeing your brown health kit..
---
I could be wrong but i think the reason he got us all so fast is because his skill level was much higher than ours. But the reason such a good player is such a low rank is that a quick win by slug will not pip him up.
---
Try doing a kyf with Meyers. You can hear him breathing behind the mask. It'd a sound that once you notice it's hard to stop nothing it. Personally I never heard the grass, but that masked breathing though.
---
Once you activate your ability, your entire screen like turn greyish, after your bar is complete then it shows you are phasing
---
Ahhh yeah sorry my dumb ass forgot to put a smaller image of whats posted above as the thread image. So it shows my Youtube profile picture. The Corpse is from a movie called Poltergeist 2.
---
&gt; The shock is already annoying and when timed right is a free hit.
---
the shock isn't annoying. the SFX when you tier up is, but the shock itself? nah. but setting that aside, using the shock to get a free hit is not simple. the slow down you experience when using it is excruciating and the range without an add-on is abysmal. and even half decent survivors know how to run after a shock to avoid being unable to use a pallet
---
We need shirtless clown more than anything
---
Hit the other survivor
---
I’m not even talking End game Amanda man. I’m not talking exploding traps. Ask yourself this, were her traps in need of any nerf? No, they were weak already and gave her a small bit of map pressure. Now, you can run around until the next gen is completed before you even have to worry about traps. You lose pressure.
---
There is the sound of someone breathing behind a mask. Once you hear it you'll hear it all the time when you play vs him. It's similar to ghost face cloak sound but quieter
---
&gt; As far as toxicity: nothing is toxic with slugging inherently, the only time it's toxic is when the killer does it when everyone alive is slugged and purposely doesn't hook them as he wants to be an ass and waste their time after he has already won. That's the only time it's toxic
---
he didn't do that. My friends DCed and then he hooked me immediately.
---
&gt; What's not effective, in my opinion, is what the killer you faced did. You only get one hook on everyone and he likely caused everyone including himself to de-pip due to a lackluster game.
---
He likely got safety pip from it. But in my opinion he is purposely not ranking up so he can get more easy 4Ks
---
Ah so intelligent is just people who don't directly disagree with you?
---
We need both now
---
You're saying it like if you know I'm playing Ghostface and you're threatening me :D
---
Once you've mastered Nurse she's pretty overpowering. This means she's not very fun or entertaining to watch, which is why many streamers will just avoid playing her. Ardetha made a [very good Nurse guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfnmZvK4l88), it's worth your time.
---
As for matchmaking, for the best killer experience you'll want to be on during "prime time". Otherwise you'll be matched against whatever people are available - the focus is on ping and location first, rank second.
---
It's a legimately bad tactic. I'll give you that.
---
This made my hour, thanks 🤣
---
You thought there was no one behind you, but no, it was me, Michael!
---
Lol are you enjoying yourself? You have lost my respect man that's all I'm saying. Continue to respond with punchlines to make yourself feel superior.
---
&gt; were her traps in need of any nerf?
---
yes, because the Pig could easily save a trap, toss it on someone, and then just crouch follow them to prevent any chance of escape. that's not good balance.
---
He used a very valid argument i found no counter argument for. Most other people replied with stuff which was simply plain wrong.
---
It's "The Shining" :p
---
I run the thing that tells me when I'm looking at a totem solely because I got tired of people not doing gens with ruin, so when I find out there's ruin I literally run like a madman to find it and break it so three other people aren't slowly wandering around. I don't play enough to rank any better than 10-7 or so, so I get a lot of doofuses, and it's just easier to out doofus them.
---
I mean, I usually just get to madness 3 without hurting them until there's two gens left and my NOED activates
---
Use ruin, franklins demise, sloppy butcher, and corrupt intervention on her and gens will never get done
---
No it's from a hilarious fan made DbD Twitter account - https://twitter.com/DbDMemes
---
I actually lol’d so you deserve it.
---
Every DLC comes with exclusive cosmetics for the Survivor (mostly), which is why buying the DLC is generally a better choice. Purchasing the DLC as a whole is also cheaper than buying each character separately.
---
* Laurie gets her "casual clothes" (grey sweater + yellow pants) if you buy the Halloween DLC.
---
* Ace gets his tuxedo if you buy the Flesh and Mud DLC.
---
* Feng gets her casual clothes if you buy the Spark of Madness DLC.
---
* Dwight gets a black eye cosmetic if you buy the Leatherface DLC.
---
* Quentin gets his "school clothes" (hat, casual shirt, jeans) if you buy the Nightmare on Elm Street DLC.
---
* Tapp gets his casual clothes (no hat, jacket, jeans) if you buy the SAW DLC.
---
* Kate gets a white top if you buy the Curtain Call DLC.
---
* Adam gets a slightly different vest underneath his jacket if you buy the Shattered Bloodline DLC.
---
* Jeff gets a darker jacket if you buy the Darkness Among Us DLC. (You can buy a Brown-tier cosmetic in the in-game store for like 900 Shards to get pretty much the same thing)
---
* Jane gets a Hawaiian shirt (under her suit) if you buy the Demise of the Faithful DLC.
---
* Ash gets a different hand if you buy him as a DLC. It's barely noticeable but the price is the same if you buy him as a DLC or with Cells.
---
* Ghostface gets a white knife and white cloak if you buy him as a DLC.
---
Then what are you talking about when you say her traps were nerfed???
---
Jendanise reference username? Check.
---
Acts like an asshole? Check.
---
And only Tombstone Myers doesn't care.
---
Damn I was gonna compliment you on how good it is. Still, great find!
---
again, not necessarily. i know that survivor mains insist that the only way to play pig is by using hats as soon as possible, but that's not de facto true
---
Impossible to pip slugging all 4 so yeah he's doing it to either be a dick, derank, or both.
---
Damn got excited before I realised it was NA. Last sale EU had Ghostface wasn’t on sale so would’ve liked to maybe get him but oh well
---
Unbreakable is a really good combo with DS. If you have 20 secs left with DS when you go into the dying state there’s no way you’re getting hooked since you can either DS the killer or unbreakable.
---
looooooooooooooool
---
Unless you can grab him while he's unhooking, chances are you are just giving him a speed boost, allowing the guy with BT to then block and take a hit, while their teammates are swarming to also block hits.
---
Unless they're exposed somehow, but that's not always possible.
---
You can, it just makes you stick out. 
---
I don't do it myself, personally. Tunnelling and camping just lets the other people do gens. But in a game about hiding you don't want to stick out.
---
Camping is watching the hook area from any distance at which you can do damage to either the rescuing or unhooked survivors.
---
Patrolling is walking around an area looking for other survivors instead of checking for them in another area of the map. For instance, you could patrol a hook area, you could patrol an area with close gens, you could patrol totems.
---
They were never nerfed like that. Only the endgame part was changed.
---
Ahhh couldnt take credit for this masterpiece
---
Imagine daily for Meg be like this:
---
"Don't be seen by the killer until the Endgame Collapse and then repeatedly crouch at the gates"
---
Dude I feel like all my points get thrown and tossed to end game every post I have with you. Again for the third time, I’m not talking about End game. The changes relieved some pressure off her traps during the trial because of a gen not progressing.
---
Poor killer!
---
Yay, ethics!
---
Tactical Slugging is what I do to prevent hatch escapes (It’s the only sure way to get a 4K now because the hatch spawns by you or the survivor. There’s no in between).
---
Now slugging with knockout/third seal, deer stalker, infectious fright, and nurses calling is just being an ass. 
---
Though, it doesn’t need nerfing because there’s no reward for doing it  (Unless you want to de-pip) and there are multiple perks that counter it. Bottom line, it’s an isolated issue that isn’t really part of normal game play (Like body blocking)
---
&gt; not Doc being too weak. Don't make him easier and more rewarding.
---
eh, disagree on this. he *is* too weak and his shock is *bad*. it isn't a matter of skill or learning, it is a matter of it genuinely being pretty bad and not always working right. the stacked slow down makes it *absurdly* easy for survivors to plan around loops and shut down the "free" hit
---
Matchmaking is a bit off these days. I read somewhere that the longer matchmaking takes, the more likely you'll be paired with someone who may not be your rank. I am not sure of the source on that, so take it for what it's worth.
---
Nurse is a very hard killer to learn if you are just starting out as killer. You're probably going to have a really rough time unless you're matched up with people your rank. I speak from experience, as my first killer was Nurse, and I leveled her all the way to 50 before I touched another killer. Once I got a better understanding of how to actually win with another killer, I started playing better with the Nurse.
---
Instead of looking for streamers who play Nurse, I would search for youtube tutorial videos. Most of the streamers who play are going to be fairly experienced, which may not help you much either.
---
Alright fair. I guess the patch notes screwed with me and I’m not remembering the Pig fully
---
My friend and I started a smurf because reasons ( sue me idgaf lmao ) and some things I started to notice around the lower ranks is that people have a very, very bad habit of not using the information they're given. I'm dumb, and have the attention span of a squirrel so I know I forgot some things, but w/e
---
* Just because a killer is nearby, does not mean they have found you, they may patrol the area, but this still does not mean they have spotted you, I personally have a bad habit of doing this, but don't sprint off a gen unless you have to, you would be surprised how many times I sat directly in front of a killers PoV and they didn't see me 
---
* Basement bad, stop going in there, stop going near there, establish where the basement is, and if you know you're going to go down within the area, just get as much distance as possible from it, a basement hook puts an extreme amount of pressure on the team, especially early 
---
* CHECK YOUR GODDAMNED BACK, For the love of all that is holy, look behind you, you don't have to do it all the time, you don't need to even do it for very long ( when switching between loops, I only look behind me for about half a second or so to get a good idea of where the killer is approaching from ) 
---
* When looping a killer, WATCH THE DAMN KILLER, people also don't like to do this, and this almost always guarantees a hit, watch them whenever you can and always try to keep a good idea of where they are
---
* Break LoS whenever possible, the second the killer doesn't have LoS on you, they are trying to predict where you're going, where you are, and what your plan of action is, this is especially vital against a nurse 
---
* Always have an escape plan, keep an idea of where key pallets are ( god pallet, infinite pallets, etc ) and whether or not they have been thrown down 
---
* If you need practice on looping, aggro the killer by killer shack and work on keeping them there until you get hit
---
* Lockers are not safe havens, unless you have hard-on for memen 
---
* If someone gets hooked, keep working on a gen, if you're 75% by the time they get hooked, finish the gen then go unhook, if its less use your judgment, I usually wait and judge 
---
If you have questions lmk, I got the game a month or so ago if I'm thinkin right, and my highest rank was 3, was debating on grinding to 1, but with some of my friends getting the game I left it and started a smurf so I can help them with the game instead of introducing them to the wonderfully fun and intuitive gameplay of sweaty ruthless killers
---
I'm not a fan of DCs at all. I have a few hundred hours in the game and I've DC'd maybe three or four times. In this case, if I were killer, I would have immediately DC'd.  I may have left a message such as "sorry, not playing if you're going to exploit map bugs" and left. There's no use arguing with the players or trading insults. If you can't play fair, there's no point in playing. There's nothing more to say.
---
After the game, I would have sent the footage BVHR to show them the map bug and move on. Yes, you lose points and a pip, but to me that's worth it.
---
Ah ok. Well I was wrong then, just didn’t remember it at all evidently. Disregard all this then
---
I went to the oatch notes and it says this "RBTs only become active whenever a generator is completed."
---
but it's always been that way. there's a reason everyone is telling you you're wrong
---
the devs didn't say this because it was a change, they said it to clarify the change to EGC
---
Uh oh
---
Nah he has 4K hrs and has been playing since the game came out
---
I use spine chill to know if I've been spotted, and premonition to know in what direction to run.
---
Billy probably wouldn't have slugged had your team not all been grouped together as they were. If they were all downed in less than a minute then that is the team's fault for not clearing the area and basically just giving him the game. 
---
Sometimes slugging is the way to go if you have the opportunity. It's not toxic or bad in my opinion to slug. Just means the survivors messed up and gave the killer an easy win. 
---
Dont know why survivors complain about slugging. Whenever I slug it's only because the survivors were doing dumb shit and I caught them out on it lol.
---
Most survivors didn't have Unbreakable so to let them bleed out its a nice idea sometimes.
---
Exactly. Both sides argue the same things.
---
For Leatherface it's honestly less that he needs buffs so much as Hillbilly needs nerfs. Under the context that Hillbilly didn't exist Leatherface would honestly be way stronger. The main issue with Leatherface is honestly that his power doesn't function most of the time (cough Chili addons cough) so if they fixed that he'd honestly be mid tier. I can go into my rant how a Killer who has the best mobility in the game shouldn't *also* have an instadown **and** a fast pallet break, but that's another discussion entirely.
---
Clown isn't fine as he is but giving him his three strongest addons on base is not the way to go about it. Honestly the easiest solution to Clown's issues is to remove his 2 second 15% slow when he uses his power which slows Survivors down by 15% for 2 seconds. Clown is a chase Killer who can not use his power to chase, which means he can only use his power on loops which honestly doesn't even work on most safe loops. I realize that Behaviour doesn't want Clown to just spam bottles but Clown's weakness that stops him from just spamming bottles is his ammo count; he doesn't need to slow himself down as well.  
---
I really recommend [this video](https://youtu.be/4EYd5izzAsQ) that goes over a lot of the problems with Clown but putting Flask of Free Win and "I don't have to aim my bottles" on base is not the way to go. Clown (like Leatherface) is a Killer plagued more by bugs and design oversights than actual balance problems. He simply needs bug fixes, not a rework and not his best addons as baselines.
---
Amanda's Letter is literally Mirror Michael with a slightly lower range and considerably longer lunge. Amanda's Letter is a huge sleeper addon ngl and it's incredibly potent (if not for the -3 RBTs which I think should only be -2 instead.)  
---
I have a feeling you meant to say Ruleset No. 2 instead of Amanda's Letter? Ruleset No. 2 is incredibly weak for an Ultra Rare and I've seen it suggested several times that it should be baseline. While I think RS2 being base is a bit overkill (if the RBT nerfs remain you can put a Hindered RBT on a Survivor and then they don't have Sprint Burst) I do definitely think a variation of hiding the boxes on base would be good. It's really stupid that a Survivor can pick the best route to each box as soon as they're unhooked.
---
Exactally it's such a hassle! Either rely on luck or spend money, I dont know how I feel about this.
---
Lol so much of the stuff used on ptb is just stupid.  I have so much to rest with this key and instaheal.  I can't wait to get on the ptb and test these things out.  Hmmmm fascinating the key still gives me an early escape and the instaheal still heals me up instantly.  Good thing I tried these out here.
---
Killer shows up.  I can't wait to test out NOED on the ptb.  Hmmmm still instadowns players after I lose all my gens.  See this is what ptb is all about.  Testing out brand new ideas and strats.
---
if I'm last alive I sometimes wiggle for the first two key presses out of muscle memory before I go to limp noodle
---
dang im sure they had a ton of fun not getting any points then having to wait 5 minutes because you wanted to be an asshole
---
He says why it looks like that at 1:40
---
Ill have to get it in the BW and try it out. I prestige’s for the second time on dwhite so only like Lvl 25
---
slugging is fine. it's 100 percent necessary pretty often, but doing it with the intention of bleed outs is rude
---
Bubba lookin thicc
---
But the R6 community complains about operation health.
---
fuck...
---
Why does this happen? Still new to the game.
---
If that was the case and you don't camp/tunnel, then you shouldn't have a problem with BT and DS. So something is wrong here. That's why people are attacking you here and they are right I am afraid. Both perks defend "toxic"/noob killers that camp or tunnel. You are either a camper that also tunnels or your post makes no sense

I haven’t been around for a while but aren’t they bannable?
---
holy fuck after looking at your history you have literally never played killer
---
lmao
---
What if the killer wants to catch mr 4 and he has mr 3 on the floor? Hooking 3 just let’s 4 find the hatch more effectively since it will open faster if 3 is hooked due to him likely not going to rescue 3 but instead focus on finding hatch?
---
What if the (open) gate is too far from a hook and it’s the last survivor left? Would it be ok if I bring them far as possible away from gate then drop them?
---
That's a shame you made some decent points earlier.  Shame it was coming from a biased killer main.  Your blanket statement about survivors is absurd.  That's just as stupid as me saying I main survivor and I think killers are total whiny ass, hypocritical babies.  Objectivity goes so much further in this game.  You'll enjoy it more if you pull your head from your ass and look at the game from both sides equally.  Bias just leads to unfun games and bad attitudes.

I’ve right so many of these comments that I could start a collection with them. Problem is no one is like that in the purple-red ranks
---
oh look here you are proving me right
---
&gt; Even if you instantly understood the direction, how would it change matters? What are you going to do then that you couldn't have already done when you got into position? You need to think ahead - be where the survivors aren't likely to be.
---
I can’t see what you’re talking about. If you are hiding behind a wall stalking survivor A, and Survivor B is behind you, you what? Go around the wall, now exposed to survivor A? It works for Lery’s but lots of maps lackk the density of objects to let you hide from any angle or have multiple cover spots. 
---
And while you’re taking your time planning ahead and moving to the perfect angle there’s multiple survivors working on gens out there. You got to Mpve. Go go go. The gens will pop any minute.
---
And your scenario is map start. Okay. What do you do when you hook a survivor and turn to walk away. Now there’s a hooked survivor behind you, and three unknowns. One is likely going behind you to get the save. How do you even move to go anywhere, esp when someone is coming in for the Save, while the downed/hooked survivor is setting off your whispers.
---
Oh. Thanks.
---
oh okay. I get it. that's what I was kinda thinkin, cuz im only an okay survivor. I notice that at least 1 surv will be better than me, 1 will be worse, and 1 is a wildcard. sometimes I loop killers for a few good minutes and sometimes I get rekt in less than 30 secs lol. even tho I'm a killer main I still am having a hard time getting better by learning the opposite role more. Ty for reply!
---
How could you say something so bold yet so controversial? 
---
Jokes aside you bring up a lot of good points
---
How so.  I literally took what you said and changed one word to illustrate a point.  You're incredibly biased and think the worst of all survivors.  You're no better than the douchey survivor mains that think every killer is a camping asshole deserving teabags at every loop.  You're both two sides of the same shitty community ruining coin.
---
He even kinda looks like myers aha

I haven’t. I’m only rank 16 so I’m pretty casual

Aren’t those the same perk icons as in his normal videos? I was wondering whether you meant the perk icons or not because the video you chose, but I guess your best bet would be to check his discord and maybe ask him there or in twitter

go fix that

---
Doing Gens, you?
---
Technically unless you have perks that boost teamwork you’ll always be doing Gens faster if you’re on separate ones. If the other person doesn’t stop working on the Gen during the hex regression and they get a skill check yeah it’s slower than you by yourself hitting goods
---
Nah freddy is pretty good so i disagree
---
Those 2 get an exposed status on survivors for stalking. It has to be earned with line of sight and survivors unaware.
---
Legion's was part of their power. Your upset the power was debuffed to only cause a bleeding status while also telling you where everyone is. You need to adapt a new playstyle if you're going to use Legion anymore, instead of complaining that their only good move is removed.
---
There are a ton of better perks out there so it's kind of a wasted slot even without ruin.   And generally you aren't in the scenario where all four survivors are injured if you're securing downs.
---
Is it counterproductive to play two exhaustion perks? Like say Adrenaline and Dead Hard
---
I like to think he wasn't actually stalking OP, he was just standibg there to see how long it would take.
---
You and me both. Two to three people on a gen is still a good way to counter Ruin especially when everyone goes a good few seconds without triggering a skill check. Certain perks also exist to counter Ruin as well (Stake Out and Prove Thyself I prefer). But noooo everyone wants to go find the totem instead making the game even longer than it should be.

No I am complaining about the key, but posts of people at red ranks use iron will I was just going for a generic toxic red rank survivor build. In the PTB I have been using Bl, fixated, inner strength and we'll make it.
---
I hear you.
---
I personally never took the term toxic in a very literal sense, but I’m sure plenty do.
---
Oh tell me about it. I get on my other accounts that I haven’t played in awhile and i find the dumbest noobs lmao
---
False, I'm rank three and just gave a hatch to a Claudette who was very Friendly
---
Lol it was a joke to begin with! I didn't think it would recieve this reception
---
Sure he doesn’t owe him anything but that doesn’t mean he’s not still an asshole. We’re all working together in this community and although it’s not a perfect game by any means we still don’t need to perpetuate it.
---
Lol. Not quite. They told me how bad I was playing scratched mirror Myers on blood lodge tho.
---
"Please unalive yourself now." -Deadpool
---
Teabagging is nowhere near as bad as face camping. One is just trolling harmlessly for the most part and one is ruining a persons game.
---
If you listen carefully you can hear the killer's footsteps and breathing right at the beginning
---
See that's what I always think. I typically walk a nice circle around the closest gens after a hook and then walk back. It's comical the amount of rage I get though
---
Just give her back Game Over
---
Dude I dead ass get the killers attention if I see someone tapping. Like.. I get it's annoying but dont fucking cheat you little shit.
---
Chill out dude. They are both shitty gestures in my opinion.
---
The hatch doesn't spawn when there is only 1 gen done and there are 4 survivors.
---
I'm assuming this came from Ayrun lol
---
New survivor: sans 
---
New killer: Monica
---
There should be one person sneaking around looking for that ruin and the rest should do gens
---
Avoid strong building loops like that until the situation calls for you to commit to one.  I won't even follow survivors to buildings half the time.  I'll pressure gens and initiate a chase with someone else instead.  Building chases on the trouble maps are more of a late game thing for me after some people have died.
---
That's the second glitched spot I've seen on this particular map.

Bruh I’m only a rank 17 killer but main survivor but I’m so good at mindgaming rank 18 survivors as billy. I’m way better st killer than survivor and rank 18s will assume your following there every move and don’t expect you to go around the other side. I played a swf and the best rank was a rank 13 and even she didn’t stand a chance. I have her the jumpscare of her life as ghostface. Ran around the other side, jumped out of nowhere and grabbed her from the window.
---
Metal of Man was essentially an extra health state survivors got for doing absolutely nothing other than running the perk and could only be bypassed by non-m1 killers.  It had to be nerfed or altered. I personally think it was hit too hard, and that safe hook rescues also should give it tokens, but Devs apparently thought that was still too strong. So yeah, now it’s dead because of how Devs handled the change. It had to be done though, because it was ridiculously strong.
---
Dying
---
She has a add-on where she doesn't make this sound, but idk the name of it
---
And NOED is an easy down for killer who cant play control.
---
K so what are the downvotes for lol
---
Adrenaline with any other exhaustion perks is okay because the former proccs even if you're already exhausted. I wouldn't use a combo of other exhaustion perks (sprint burst+dead hard, dead hard+balanced) though. 
---
Caveat is that balanced landing will give you the fall stun reduction even when you're exhausted which is super helpful for certain levels.
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
You should be doing solo gens anyways with Ruin up.  Arguably solo gens in general is the way to go regardless of killer loadout.
---
I'm not sure how you could encourage it any more. You get BP, you potentially stop a perk that rewards the Killer highly just for being bad, generally. Like...
---
Most people already have the ridiculous mindset that it's "not worth the time", so. Maybe if cleansing a totem gave that survivor a boost in gen repair speed for a brief time? That's about all I can think of.
---
Which doesn’t change my point at all. There’s 3 timelines.
---
1) H 1-6
---
2) H1-2, H2O/HR
---
3) H1, H2018
---
Only the third one matters.
---
Mega gamers drink pizza and eat bella Delphines bath water
---
Yeah he's solid but vs 4 good survivors doing gens he isn't gonna be able to do anything. You have to end chases super quickly to be viable and also have some map pressure. Freddy has snares but survivors will just throw the pallet down early. Like with clown.

---
He's just standing there... *menacingly.*
---
I havent found what I want my fourth perk to be with freddy. Right now I run ruin, surveillance, fire up, and monstrous. Pressure on gens and monstrous shrine is useful if survior brings chase to basement.  
---
I've reached rank 9 for killer today but now I'm playing survior to get a better understanding of how teams work together. I'm looking to cover some ground after reset and put some respect on my name.
---
tbh matches like that make me question if i actually want to play killer, especially if they happen in succession.

Amazing job bud
---
Does hex ruin effect every generator on the first skillcheck?
---
My take on it is if you're doing it intentionally to irritate someone and not for any tactical reason, then it's toxic
---
Then just down the player right away and hook them, the survivor would need to get away and be healed for mom to work as designed.
---
Stop being a scrub, its as easy as cleansing a totem, it's also just as easy to just take out the totem.
---
WOW
---
I actually had no idea, thank you for sharing
---
Yes, every gen is affected if hex ruin is in the killer loadout.
---
Me: Uses a flashlight to save my friend from instant death.
---
🅱️ruh
---
That's exactly why I hate this game as much as I love it. The killer looks to the right and attacks and you ran to left and you get hit, you throw a pallet down and the killer teleports through it and is able to hit you even if you get the points for stunning him (and by teleport I mean literally coming to the side where I stand and is able to chase me because he don't have to break the pallet)
---
or... in 2019 shirtless myers meme is dead af

I would never willing associate myself with that cunt.   User name is my sincerest desire to the assholes who don't know how to chew anything with their mouths closed.   There are 3 of them stationed nearby in my workplace and are the first to go when they implement the Purge.

Hahahaha true story bro xD
---
As long as he hooks everyone once their all down I'm not too bothered by slugging.
---
yea apparently they changed it sometime recently and i had no idea
---
Yeah but he isn't as good in chase as spirit and nurse. They have both
---
Is that a map of the US?
---
I have no Idea, expect for the part where I am looking how a Survivor get's Memento Moried by a Nurse
---
I don't use leader mainly because I just find there are better perks. If I'm using any of Dwight's perks its either Bond or Prove Thyself. Most of the things that Leader helps you with require you to be too close to the survivor while they do it i.e. Sabotaging, unhooking, and cleansing. Prove Thyself though, you're very close to other survivors when doing gens anyways so itll help a lot more often.
---
I love doing this as a "gg", my buddies don't get it and get mad at me for wasting an item. They yell at me saying "dude the killer can't even use it WTH don't waste your item"
---
But I feel like that's kind of the point, knowing that it is wasted makes it such a fun/silly/nice gesture. As you're willing to give it up solely as a gg/meme
---
Mettle of man could work even without needing to heal. If you got hit twice and downed, that’s 2 tokens of the 3. If you got dehooked and hit again without getting to heal, that’s all 3 tokens. And you still wouldn’t be dead on hook. You’d have it ready and all you had to do was get hit by the killer. With no counter except insta downs or moris.
---

---
Let's say you can't grab em, that means they're done unhooking, that means they get a speed boost when you hit them, that means the borrowed time guy can body block or take a hit for his teammate and guarantee an escape.
---
There's a hook, me and 1-3 other survivors. Are you expecting me to fuck off to the other side of the map while the door is open while I see the other survivors rushing to the hook like a moth to a flame?
---
You try to tell me I have a small brain but you sound like the human equivalent of internet explorer.
---
Yes it was easy to counter Mettle of Man. Just camp, waiting for the rescue, pray there isn't Borrowed Time, pray there isn't DS, and pray that the other survivors don't just ignore the camping killer trying to counter Mettle of Man by just doing gens and leaving.
---
Very smart of you sir.
---
Kinda, to the person playing the killer, here's just one thing, but each survivor see something different from another survivor. This would encourage players to play all the survivors.  They could even make the killer appear as other killers in the game. There killer would still have his/her own unique abilities that wouldn't change, but one survivor would see Trapper, another Doctor, another Freddy, another Nurse. The killer wouldn't have their abilities, but it would screw with the survivors at first.
---
Was this planned? That's hilarious
---
I wish killers were more chill with memeing around like this sometimes, whenever someone photobombs me when I'm mori-ing someone I let them run away then get back to the game. But whenever I do it as survivor the killer just insta slashes me and moris me right on top of the other guys body lol. Like relax, it's okay to meme sometime
---
&gt;ruin is pay to win bullshit

Legion needs a buff too
---
As a main I kinda get upset that they are being forgotten by the devs
---
I juggle between 4 and 5, and I always do this.
---
 stake out gang
---
Keep a mental timer with you at all times. Has it been a minute since you last hooked that survivor who inexplicably ran right at you? No? Leave them on the ground for a while.  
---
Slugging puts a decent amount of pressure on the survivors anyway, so it's a win-win.
---
It’s for gen protection not for mid chase.
---
DS is already a really powerful meta perk that debatably lasts wayyyy too long as is. It’s fine, doesn’t need a buff at all. It’s not meant to be a second chance, it’s more of an anti-tunnel thing that occasionally gives a second chance. A free health state + killer stun SHOULD be situational.
---
I constantly see anti sfw stuff left and right. And any decent killer can easily patrol totems.
---
Your blind to your own perks but absolutely refuse to see any other option but your own. I myself would be fine if we all had a live and let live.
---
But no, your perks good, other parks bad. You wont listen and keep hand waving others work as trivial like the game isn't intended to be advantageous to killers. Well, get gud then if you need mom nerfed but not your own crutch perks.
---
Hell, I just had a match that got wreaked by a no perk MM. He makes you look like a bitch.
---
That’s all good numbers wise. But in practice, it’s different because I never want to settle for normals, but if I try for greats every time, I will inevitably miss one by overshooting. And then you’ve revealed your location, so speed and percents be damned. By tapping I can take that mind game out of the equation. No skillchecks, no boom. It’s worth it to me.
---
I mean, you're kind of right though. Single Repair isnalways the fastest. 
---
If 4 people all work on one single gen, that's 80-120 sec to get 4 gens done.
---
If 2 people work in pairs, that's 50-150 seconds to get 2!!!! Gens done. If the pair both only get's normal skillchecks, they both get punished for it. So basically... against ruin, single repair is a bit better.
---
No I said it annoys me when people burn ebonies and it isn't the new killer. I said anyone that uses OP add-on/items/offerings just because it is the PTB is a bit scummy imo.
---
&gt;  So it’s all day long again spirits slightly proxy camping
---
I just did a post about camping and everyone on the sub agrees camping is really fun. Just let the people have what they want and camp them. You will slowly derank with that strategy and then get easier matches at lower ranks.
---
The only thing these 3 have - mobility, that is all. Imagine if billy and spirit used they power in normal 110 or 115 speed. Billy would be as useless as bubba, probably even more so. 
---
Hag is up where too, if survivors step in her traps, she can travel long distance fast.
---
Omg, thank you so much &lt;3
---
You’re tapping too long
---
If i tbag a killer, it’s because I want him to chase me, and forget about my teammates banging out gens in the background, if, as a killer, I get tbagged, I typically interpret that as a survivor wanting my attention, and sometimes I’ll gladly give it to them. While I don’t think every Nea tbagging at a pallet is thinking “I’m a tactical genius, I’ve psychologically outplayed the killer” I do believe there is a fair amount of subconscious strategy behind every tbagger, and I also believe that it’s not inherently toxic, as most the community perceives it
---
It’s not actually fixed, I still have it happen all the time. Granted, it’s all just visual glitches and doesn’t effect the game play
---
Total n00b here. Why does everyone bring up the stereotype of Claudette always hiding in bushes? She was my first main but none of her abilities (unless I'm missing something) make her better at hiding than anyone else. Is it just the self-heal thing?
---
It's very hard to pull off the nurse stun, just as a heads up man.
---
Practice.
---
Believe me, do it without tapping. Even if you TOTALLY ignore great skillchecks, you get the gen done 15-30 seconds faster.
---
DS buffs? You’re losing it my guy.
---
No, it’s fine as is.
---
I dont even stalk with GF. Hell I use his NS as a tracking tool to figure out the general area a survivor is. It works for me as I get at least 3ks pretty often.
---
Run Unbreakable and Bring a key.
---
PRAISE PEANUT.
---
Jesus H. Christ, you have a frail ego.
---
Nah, it doesn't need a buff.  It's just a safety net against getting tunneled now instead of a 1/4 chance to have an escape from jail free card.
---
Hahah May be a good idea.  I was playing facecamping bubba to lose some rank xD I hope they had a good time dying on that first hook
---
I swing my camera around CONSTANTLY while working on gens, I can't not do it, I am so paranoid!
---
While I'm not easily tilted by BM, like I said, I'm a believer in turnabout, not everyone is the same. 
---
Besides that, just because we're on competing sides, and you want to win, try to remember that I'm also a human being trying to pass the time by having fun with a video game that I bought. Yes, I acknowledge that you bought this game too and are at your own liberty to be a dick, but by that logic, anyone who buys a gun is at liberty to shoot it at anyone and anything. My liberty to live takes priority over your desire to shoot me. Same with games. My liberty to have fun takes priority over your desire to be a dick. If you can't see that, I can't change that, but you need to reconsider your priorities if you winning by any means matters more than not being a dick.
---
Holding the game hostage means the game can’t progress because the killer is doing something (body blocking the last survivor in a corner or the basement and just standing there, something like that). 
---
This is not holding the game hostage, it’s just a strategy to get a 4K. Is it not the most fun thing in the world? Sure. But it doesn’t need to be changed. It’s fine, if the killer wants to go for a 4K then they’re allowed to.
---
Or if they're chasing the obsession, the pincers around their name will start twitching
---
God damn breaking ankles over here. Billy prolly left them alone rest of the match after that like "fuuuuuck this"
---
Might be better this time around since there is actually some survivor content.
---
Happen to me and it just respawned me at the exit again about where i jumped from too. On Xbox
---
Yes!
---
You literally say in this post “kinda a dick move but not toxic.”
---
Isn’t the whole point of the word toxic that it basically means being a dick? Lmao
---
If you tea bag, you’re a dick, and therefore “toxic.” That’s not to say It should be banned or your a monster, but it’s “toxic” behavior that drives our new players and makes the experience less fun. 
---
You may be playing to win, but most of us are playing for fun.
---
Prayer beads.
---
&gt; By that point, the killer has enough pips and generally has around 28-30k BP. So extending the game for 7-15 minutes is worth the 4k?
---
The answer is that if the Killer cares about ranking up, yes its extremely worth it. If 1 survivor escapes, you only get silver emblem for Kills, but if you kill all of them, you might get gold or red. A 2 emblem difference is huge and is usually the difference between pip and depip for the killer.
---
&gt;  Especially when you can just hook the survivor far away and barbecue over to the last survivor. 
---
This does not work, a good survivor will go in a locker.
---
&gt; How to fix this issue? I have no idea lmao. extending the bleed out timer won't work and changing the endgame would be too radical. It just comes down to the killer recognizing that it shouldn't be worth employing the endgame slug strategy when they already have a high chance of finding the last survivor by other means. If the final survivor gets away then it's a GG. Move on instead of holding the game hostage to get a 4k.
---
Easy. The Killer shouldn't be forced to 4K to get a hope of a victory. Getting a 3K should be enough to mean a victory.
---
I know. I get it. I shouldn’t try for the greats. But I can do them, so I can’t help myself. But I always get distracted and regret it.
---
Or better yet, HANDS
---
I don't agree on every single point, mainly the "GG EZ" at the end of the game that shouldn't fall under the   
---
"psychological warfare" sign anymore since the game is already done so there's no mistakes to be made anymore; but since you're mainly right, you explained your point of view well and you're bold enough to say something that isn't the popular opinion, have my upvote.
---
if im the slugged survivor aka 3rd survivor i instantly dc and give the 4th survivor the ability to search for the hatch...imagine 2019 and still killers crave to 4k...lmao
---
No they aren't. And the fact that you're getting downvoted for it kinda shows that.
---
BHVR made the rule:
---
You are at 100% speed, minus 10% for every other survivor on this gen.
---
This makes teamwork possible, but not OP.
---
That's crazy haha
---
You xould say you got...
---
BAMBOOzled
---
Not on Mount Ormond. Everything’s fucking white. It’s literally the only map that Blendette isn’t at an advantage in.
---
Tea bagging is a gesture, yes it is shitty, but doesn't stop anyone from playing. Face camping ruins the game for the person and wastes that persons items and time. Can't really say they are both equal in shittyness. I am calm and my comment wasn't worded in a way to suggest otherwise :)
---
That's not really how either of the powers work.  
---
They are both significantly stronger for forcing a slow vault, especially with Freddy.  Don't waste your time trapping pallets and focus on the windows.
---
Ok if ruin is active, what’s the most effective way to continue doing the gen while my teammates look for ruin
---
Thank you for seeing it from an understanding point of view.
---
Big brain reply
---
Small game ftw
---
I normally do but I started recording because the lag was really bad and wanted to capture any lag-related funny moments. Instead I got this.

I’ll never let a spirit get me. I’ll die bleeding out before she’s allowed to get me

Damn! That's awesome mate
---
This is a post about the community’s perception of toxicity, particularly the rampant hypocrisy of one-sided players who think any tactic the other side employs is nuclear level toxic and needs to be removed immediately. We can talk about the finer details of what detrimental to the over all experience, but first we need to use broader strokes to unify a majority of the community and start a discussion from there
---
Cool,The Clown got a Leatherface disguise
---
I understand both of your opinions. 
---
There is definitely a huge portion of this community that thinks every little thing is toxic, when in reality, I do think it’s just cheating and harassment that’s toxic. Unfortunately, there is a ton of harassment (getting spammed messages about how garbage you are post game on Xbox is never fun).
---
About Zappyboi. If he will keep his treatment mode speed, he should be a viable choice in red ranks, although he won't be as powerful as great trio. However he needs some rework, not a buff. Since problem with him is that he is overpowered at ranks 20-10, still powerful at 10-5 but slightly underpowered at red ranks.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d27i2m/anticamping_suggestion/
---
This was a suggestion to fix camping and everyone replied that facing campers is way too fun to do that. So just keep camping them, most players enjoy facing that as you can see.
---
It’s ok big guy, you can hook me
---
You're honestly pretty shit at the game if you lost to Myers without perks. Even worse if you unironically believe that the game has been balanced with killer favoritism in mind.
---
Look at previous instances of the game and tell me what you think of Brand New parts fully repairing gens. Or old DS. Or pallet vacuums. Or Exhaustion recovery while running. Or permanently sabotaged hooks.
---
If you believe that killers are op or that each and every killer perk doesn't come with super obvious counters, you need to get good.
---
sucks when it happens, but slugging in itself is a risk/reward strat, since the other survivors can get them back up while you're chasing.
---
Try your best to hit the great skillchecks. If you miss it, let go of the Feb for a few seconds while it's sparking (it won't progress during this time and you continuing to repair only risks proccing another skillchecks).
---
They can, but it buys you some time to set traps. It also takes them longer to realize ruin is up since they have walk to a farther away gen and get a skillcheck. By the time they see ruin you already have all traps set up. Once ruin and corrupt are gone, sloppy and franklins slow down heals and eliminate toolboxes, medkits, and flashlights which slows everything down. Its a good build for slowing the game down with hag
---
Personally I'm still figuring out which killer is my favorite; I've been trying out eat and every one of them for the time being. (I got all of the DLC in a big sale, except for Ghost Face, so I have lots to choose from.) There's so many killers I never see played so I'm really liking all of the variety; it's so annoying how every other match is either Huntress or Trapper when there's fun (albeit suboptimal) options like Doctor or Plague.
---
Gimmick Wiggle Build!  
---
Tenacity, Flip Flop, Unbreakable, and Boil Over  
---
Recover super fast on the ground while moving, when the killer picks you up you get a percentage of your recovery as the wiggle bar and your struggles are more effective.
---
What's stopping them from abandoning their chase and coming right back to me? I've seen it done enough.
---
The dev's discarded this idea.
---
That doesnt mean it wont ever happen, just that they're looking for other solutions.
---
Too bad Bill died right after haha
---
Or literally any player with experience and a functional brain.
---
Here comes the crapper
---
r/DBDGoneWild
---
you get the vibe eyyyy
---
The thing about this game is that it seems the majority of the player base possess a very competitive mind set. While having fun is important to a gaming environment, it is my experience that most of the player base leans more towards a competitive experience, in which the sole enjoyment comes from attaining a win condition and outplaying the opposing team. It is with this in mind that things such as psychological warfare and tilt tactic move from “dick move bro” to legitimate facets of regular play. This could be alleviated if there were a way to make a distinction between casual players looking for fun, and competitive players trying to win by any means, but at the moment, no such distinction can be made, so conversation unfortunate must lean towards the majority player base, the competitive side
---
So many people **STILL** don't get it, I swear. I'll walk to a hook, stare at it for a second and do a head shake/don't hook them, and they KEEP WIGGLING.
---
I get scared sometime bc I’ll walk past a locker and that bitch just jumps I don’t even know she’s in their
---
Good idea. There's a serious issue with tunnelling and facecamping in this game, and I thinks current perks don't help as much as they should. I hope they bring back the old Borrowed Time dual protection so that the the effect is applied to the rescuer as well.
---
I've gotten to rank 1 as a survivor and I honestly have to agree. Even the wait times for survivor in red ranks can take a while; I can only imagine how bad it is for the killer. I got my achievement, then noped out of the reds and back to purple/green where the game can be more casual and enjoyable for everyone.
---
As far as deranking, there are 3 ways you can potentially do it. Leave the game (2 depips per leave, but this causes the survivors to lose their offerings), AFK for the match, or purposely suck/lose/gamethrow. Leaving is the fastest way though since there is no penalty.
---
Maybe you should stick to posing your children's toys on instagram if this game rustles your jimmies so much.
---
Had that happen in a killer shack corner and was also Spirit.  Is this Spirit specific?  I haven't had this survivor corner issue with any of the other killers yet.
---
It says clip is no longer available
---
nice
---
What the fuck, it's completely fine as it is. What's next, buffs for Adrenaline?
---
same here
---
Nooooo not Bill :(
---
That just means you are playing with bad teammates who won't pick you up.
---
I suggest you run Unbreakable.
---
Insidious camping sucks tbf
---
This isn't really a fun perk build or any weird theme or gimmick but what I actually use 90% of my games.  
---
Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time and Bond.  Although lately I've been swapping out D strike for Head On.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s Hannibal Buress on the Eric Andre Show
---
Idk if anyone else relates but I haven’t faced a Freddy since his rework
---
Personally I think that depends on rank, which I’m sure you’d agree with. Higher ranks are definitely more competitive than lower. When’s the last time you’ve seen a red rank killer give the last survivor hatch? Then think about green or even yellow ranks. 
---
Competitiveness comes with ranking up in the game, in my opinion. And regardless, that doesn’t mean you need to stoop low and be an asshole. You can be competitive and win without being a cunt.
---
Oh, ow. That really hurt.
---
Since you can't argue a single point or see others point of view, it must have taken a lot of strength to attack me personally.
---
Kinda agree with almost everything, especially Trapper buffs. Altough to be fair these look more like hotfixes, for example Bubba needs a complete rework just like Freddy at this point. Also Amanda's Letter would need some nerfing to be in Pig's base toolkit but other than that, solid ideas.
---
By the way why people downvote this instead of adding something into discussion?
---
What is Mori cancelling?
---
watch out, fucking comedy genius over here
---
I always thought the rank system for killers should just be:
---
0-1 Kill, Depip
---
2 Kills, safety pip
---
3 Kills, 1 pip
---
4 Kills, 2 pips
---
Why is this guy holding hands with the air? Wtf nobody is there but he looks like hes holding hands with somebody

Yep. The graphics are bad too, but then again, it's still on beta.

Bing bong boi
---
Starting the mori, stopping, and then doing that over and over. It's like the killer version of t-bagging pretty much.
---
I agree. And to be honest as a survivor in my experience is even worst I tell you why. I sometimes sit on the lobby simulator for 5+ minutes and when I found 1 it’s a lobby with 200Ping RIP I have to dodge and back to the lobby sim. Feels bad
---
I *think* it's when you hold down the button to Mori someone, but stop before the bar fills so it doesn't actually kill them. It's a way of teasing it, saying "I can kill you right now. I might do it, I might not". Maybe it's a type of 'griefing' but I doubt it? Not sure why it would warrant a ban unless he just stood there and did it over and over and over for minutes on end.
---
If the killer wants to ruin someone's day to get it, then no, it isn't.
---
Being a dick so you can win is stupid
---
Sometimes people just don’t want to change the way they think or step out of their comfort zone, who can blame them.
---
Yup. Every time I find a high ranking lobby, it likes to match me with people in...I dunno, fucking Narnia or something which makes the whole thing even worse.
---
I completely disagree with you on what ruining someone’s day is then. There’s toxic ways to ruin someone’s day on this game, slugging is not one of them.
---
* This image link is either dead, deleted or broken. Please resubmit with a better link.
---
Apparently he was shit talking the devs earlier on stream, some people in his chat think maybe they just got him for whatever they could because of that.
---
It really depends on a variety of factors. As a killer main, it comes down to if I can win the current chase quickly, how close to death each person is, how close I am to the hook, and how skilled each player is.
---
Ok if Killers are banned for their version of T bagging, can survivors be banned too for T bagging?
---
Obvious answer is no, i'm trying to illustrate how stupid this ban is, unless he did it for such a long amount of time that it becomes holding the game hostage.
---
There a clip of him seeing this?
---
I don't have a clip, but he's live right now talking about it. He mori cancelled someone who was stream sniping him and got on his nerves.
---
Lmao didnt think I'd meet you again
---
Rank 1 is full of tryhards its not a suprise. People play the best killers. Any survivor with a hundred hours or more can ignore ruin, its seen basically every game
---
Damn minus three upvotes
---
He is fun but if you’re brand new you should get LeatherFace for his perk, pretty much essential for getting a good piece of blood points
---
Nope, you don't even have to mash the buttons super fast either.
---
For killer what play style do you want to try there’s a bunch of different types, you could be stealthy like pig Myers and ghost face, oh and spirit is great but if your new then I’d learn about how the game works before jumping to top tier. Have anyone your interested in?
---
So I've been fairly new and i finally have enough shards for a character. I was just wondering whether shards are better for saving up for shrine or buying characters.
---
They do seem artificially enhanced to be bigger
---
Isn’t he the worst tho?
---
this needs to happen lmao
---
Its another thing they should just patch but instead ban for. I dont get it
---
I had a game where apparently a nea knew how to do this somehow because I downed her about three times and everytime I did she threw herself in a spot like this where I couldn't get her and I know she wasn't stuck cause I left the first two times and she crawled out and got healed. The third time I stood on top of her and let her bleed until she left then messaged me hating on me for slugging and standing there like that saying I was trash.
---
Yeah I want the new demogorgon form stranger things he looks cool and ghost face looks fun and so does the pig
---
Lololol, I am, hope you can get out from under that cloud man.
---
He himself isn’t the Best But his bbq perk is very important for getting bloodpoints
---
Maybe they should buff non SWF players, possibly show each surivors perks and Items in the lobby?
---
Relatable
---
&gt;. There's a serious issue with tunnelling and facecamping in this game
---
Maybe at rank 20-10 maybe even lower than 10.. face camping is just an easy win for survivors, anti tunnelling perk like Ds works just fine to deal with it
---
&gt;and I thinks current perks don't help as much as they should. I hope they bring back the old Borrowed Time dual protection so that the the effect is applied to the rescuer as well.
---
I'm sorry, but you should get better, that's it. There's a reason why they removed it, is abusable. I know you wanna have so many second chances but no. DS it's totally fine now, I use that and I don't feel bad about it anymore after the change since was broken af before. Now works just fine and make me do plays I couldn't do before
---
Which means I can level up other players faster?
---
Exactly. If they think cancelling a mori is so bad just fucking make it not possible to do. Tbh i've seen many killers do it and i thought it was simply the "killer version" of the T bag. When i mostly laughed it off.
---
So than why are other things that are normal game mechanics considered toxic ? IE camping, NOED
---
Dude I think you are in one of pain relievers videos, its one called playing as the spirit
---
Only thing I like the pregame lobby for is checking connection speeds... and that won't be an issue soon so yeah get rid of it.
---
Hey man, I quit. What's up with keeping up?
---
So basically barbecue and chill is a perk that every time you hook someone you can see every survivors aura outside 40 meters and you get a token for every survivor you hook that increases your bonus bloodpoints you get at the end of the match up to 100% more
---
Imagine in 2019 still dcing lol
---
Because people think they have special treatment,  if its in the game. Dont be afraid to use it
---
Can't argue with ya there.
---
Again. I don't have a problem with people testing stuff but just using their old builds and all their op items (keys and insta heals) just because they don't lose them in the live build. I made this after I made a killer sided one. I went up against the same Myers with an ebony 4 times today and 1 additional time with an ivory because he had ran out of ebony's.
---
And yes bloodpoints are needed to level every character up survivor and killer ppl tend to play killer to stack bloodpoints and then spend them however they want
---
\^\^\^\^\^\^ this omfg
---
IM JUST IN TEARS AT THE OFFICE MAN
---
Best to go with characters unless a really good perk comes into the shrine. Characters are guaranteed perks while the shrine is random, and you could be waiting months for a specific perk to show up.
---
It should activate twice a game, if you get tunneled off the hook once then there's a good chance you're going to be tunneled a second time as well. It should also deactivate if another survivor gets hooked.
---
I was hoping you'd have a rebuttal for why you felt mettle of man was balanced and interested in what you have to say.
---
Pretty sure it's only banable if done expansively, 1 ir 2 times isnt banable (hope so at least, lol)
---
They haven’t confirmed anything on dates het
---
Nah cos it only affects one survivor, therefore only the injured one is really gonna care about it
---
?
---
The same logic can be compared to any of the meta survivor perks
---
p3 omega nurse comes around the corner
---
God Ive been trying to use Mettle for so long, but even when the game says protection after i take an obvious hit made for someone else half the time i still dont get a stack, sad times.
---
BRING BACK SAFE HOOK METTLE MAKE IT LIKE 4 STACKS IF YOU NEED TO
---
That sucks, thanks anyway
---
Fair enough
---
Pgtw?
---
The person that got banned said he did it around 5 times.
---
Oh fuc-
---
I said my piece, you didnt want to listen. Then you went for blood. You win. I quit. 
---
What do you want. Here, I unsubscribed to this sub and I am uninstalling dbd. I'm out you win for life there champ.
---
Hope your wait times are short.
---
Pop goes the weasel
---
😮😮😮😬😬😬🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
---
Not a Gen tapper... But if I get constant skill checks when the Gen is at &gt;95%,imma start tapping cuz I know this game isn't gonna stop trolling me.
---
&gt;I'm not spending an entire game miserible because someone decided to bully, and I don't think anyone else is obligated to.
---
Oh the irony.
---
I think she has a cast on.
---
I feel this, I would love to have Jack with his axe.
---
NOED is overpowered. Camping isn't toxic, it's just bad play.
---
Tapping is fine, depending on how many skill checks you get.
---
We need the clip boys. Go to work reddit
---
\#freemyman
---
This game still amazes me
---
The streamer who got banned for it often shit talks the devs so some of his viewers think he got banned for the tiniest infraction they could find for that.
---
Some other people think that they might finally be cracking down on toxic behavior, but who knows.
---
😂😂😂
---
not always dude, there are times where you'll get only a second or so of repair before getting another skill check, consistently. I can usually hit skill checks but there are times where ill literally get 3 in less than 2 seconds, and bam, back to the start
---
Only 5 times btw. So it wasn't holding game hostage or anything.
---
Hexy on stream said they did it only because he shit talked the devs, they did it as revenge.
---
hexy is fucking trash who cares
---
Oh poor thing..
---
&gt;Move on instead of **holding the game hostage** to get a 4k.
---
"Holding the game hostage" haha do you even know what does it mean? You know you'll eventually die in 2 min right? That's not HOLDING THE GAME HOSTAGE entitled kid
---
&gt;slugging in general is fine. Switching to that strat in the end is unnecessary
---
Play killer, you are way too obvious to ever touched killer above rank 15.. god damn these entitled players these days..
---
I don't even need to take every point you made apart, they are all over the place already. Seriously, instead of crying because you're bad or can't bare 2min of slug or taking, idk, unbreakable as perk, do better and stop it, get some help
---
&gt; The streamer who got banned for it often shit talks the devs so some of his viewers think he got banned for the tiniest infraction they could find for that.
---
True could easily be that.
---
What I do is work on gens only if I'm solo(it's a lot slower to team gens due to ruin causing progress to halt for everyone.) otherwise I check totem spawns on my way to the next Gen. Usually also try to see where the killer goes first, as half the time they make a b line to ruin/their hex totem.
---
Wow nicely done!
---
Then please let the person who suggested hag have the same advice lmao. Spirit is stupid easy, probably the easiest killer to play imo. Obvs ignoring doctor
---
nah dude you just got outplayed
---
I have noticed a lot of people suggesting a hatch outside the exit gate as well just in case this happens. I personally think it's a decent idea since I've experienced this myself and seen it happen pretty often to others.
---
Myers has many different Tiers of gameplay. He’s easily the most unpredictable killer because he could be slow all game and suddenly mori everyone, he could be very fast, extremely fast and one shot everyone all game or very slow but get map hacks for the entire game. All of it is very balanced, however. Nothing he does is overpowered because Myers has to build for it and earn it.
---
The Hex is applied to survivors, not generators. 
---
All survivors will have 0% bonus progression on a Great skillcheck, or a certain amount of regression for a Good one. 
---
The regression only affects the generator that the survivor was working on when they got the skillcheck.
---
Does that make it a little clearer?
---
True, but they made the choice to play with low ranked people. Why should the killer be punished for something someone else chose to do? Plus it's not difficult to rank up especially as survivor so they could definitely get closer to their friends rank. I also agree with what someone else said to make it so you can only queue with people 5 ranks below or above you. That way with what I said earlier wouldn't be so dramatic of a difference.
---
Cool, I don't care about the player level number.  Just wanted to be sure it didn't affect rank and matchmaking, and it looks like that's the case.
---
DC's during a Mori should fucking be perm banned, they did say in patch notes a while back Mori spams would lead to a ban. (Before and after ds rework) as survivors also  bitched how picking up and dropping to avoid ds was abuse of game mechanics
---
This is nightmare fuel for all killer mains
---
If you dont like the post dont comment
---
What the hell is wrong with you?
---
Plz
---
Dying light on a survivor would be cool. As long as the obsession is alive, they receive the healing speed buff. Would encourage them to try to keep obsession alive
---
You would basically NEED scratched mirror for this to work because tier 1 myers is slow and has almost no lunge even with the boyfriend memo.  
---
For my scratched mirror build I use the memo and the mirror but for perks I run Make Your Choice, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher and Pop Goes the Weasel.  Devour hope is cool when it works but is also a giant gamble.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Because he's popular and makes more money in 1 hour than that guy makes in a week so he's jealous lol
---
You first, since T-bagging IS THE EXACT SAME THING.
---
They're both things people do to disrespect their opponents. 
---
In regards to your other comment:
---
&gt;it's still an actual negative thing that the receiving person has to endure. it's not comparable at all
---
Has to endure? Get the fuck over yourself. If I slugged someone for the full 4 minutes and just stood on their body instead of mori canceling that certainly wouldn't be ban worthy. Yet add a little spicy disrespect into the mix and suddenly the survivor "has to endure" it?
---
To paraphrase what I constantly see in discussions about teabagging "It's just someone clicking M1 bro, don't be so soft and offended by it"
---
You would be exposed but you wouldn't scream I'm pretty sure.
---
Oh man, the poor swfs with all those disadvantages that the game inflicts on them 😒 that part was insufferable BUT yeah this is not fun for anyone including killers; I think hatch needs to be a bit less available but also more accessible if that makes any sense at all; basically make it harder to get to but once you've got it you're for sure getting out.
---
No it really really can't.   That would just be a another false equivalency.  Objectively I think it's hard to place any other perk be it killer or survivor next to NOED.  It's just so badly designed man.  Old Decisive and MoM were the closest equivalent survivor crutch to it but then they both got reworked and rebalanced leaving NOED very much alone in that conversation at this point.
---
did you just assume my gender
---
imagine in 2019 and still killer mains cry and complain about dcing...pepelaugh
---
I am. But if by chill you mean "give them the hatch", that's never going to happen.
---
Bamboozle on a survivor. Vault a window and block the killer from using it, not pointless.
---
So what should noed's rework be then, keep the exposed but get rid of the haste or?
---
No the correct answer is to watch where killer goes first, then go over there and destroy the ruin after he leaves.
---
I feel like the strategy is to just crawl towards the exit gate. Because that’s the way to get it over the fastest. Either you crawl out, he picks you up and hooks you, or he keeps picking you up and messing with you enough that you wiggle out and can maybe escape. Either that or he moris you.
---
If you don't mind, can I ask how did you make your custom flair stay how you set it?
---
When I set it it dissapears for some reason
---
If I prestige a character, what happens to their teachables? Do they disappear, or do they continue to spawn without me being forced to buy them again?
---
Survivors on PS4 getting to triggered with the mori spam to even bother remembering to clip anyway, killers spam it all the time
---
**not bing**
---
Im calling the cops.
---
Im afraid I wouldn’t know, must be some kind of glitch
---
Also possible he's new and doesn't understand the rank system. Intuitively the killers goal is to 4k, and the survivors goal is to escape. But killer can depip from a 4k if he only gets one hook on everyone (or 3k+ hatch) , and survivors can depip even if they escape(like the post from a week ago where everyone dcd and hatch spawned for that thread's OP, meaning he escaped in 30seconds but depipped anyway.) 
---
Like it isn't intuitive at all as to how to rank up. And killers emblem system is even a little contradictory.
---
only rank 9 so far, haven't been playing very long. I have only been able to successfully circle juke like that once, but immediately got hit during the next chase, lmao. nice move though.
---
Bruh fuck that hitting ACTUAL greats is how I get gens done so fast, hex skill checks rob me of that opportunity. You know I'm either finding ruin or dying with 5 gens left
---
Imagine in 2019 be an entitled survivor main that dc for anything because can't take a loss
---
I disagree with you but gotta admit your quote is really well timed haha :P
---
Work it like normal. If you or anyone else on the Gen makes it fizzle, get off of it for 2 seconds to “reset” your Skillchecks.
---
Nothing worse than all 3 Survivors removing progress at roughly the same time.
---
You don't need NoEd on an instadown killer with that much map pressure.
---
If you prestige a character, their teachables will keep appearing in other characters bloodweb, this applies for all prestiges.
---
I only give hatch on disconnects during the lobby startjng ike its a 3v1 with 5 gens then I give hatch, 2 I am playing nurse or spirit and I have already gotten 9~10 hooks, 3 its a baby survivor. All of these are void though if any single person teebags or runs an infinite
---
Spirit is not stupid easy, there is definitely a learning curve to fully maximizing her phasing and being able to track with it
---
☠️☠️☠️☠️
---
I had a game yesterday where a Stealth Wraith was slugging everyone because they were all close together. Instead of running away to the other side of the map, they chose to just try looping near the guy who got slugged, which means that anyone else trying to heal him would get smacked. Slugging is fine if they aren't being smart  about it.
---
If you get slugged, crawl as far as you can from the Killer so you can be healed safely. Don't keep them close to the downed teammate.
---
first class meme
---
• when do stranger things dlc come out on console
---
•are you able to get event items from prestige 3?
---
Yes, thats exactly what i meant, but theres no /s tag for things that just contain a slightly hidden meaning and if people only realize the wrong "meaning" in the 5 seconds they need to read it, they are gonna downvote it
---
Not to mention his chat is always bloodthirsty
---
As a killer, I'd run Bond and Balanced Landing.
---
Or just like edit the order of the perks. Good idea +1
---
Where better to learn than in the ranks with other new people. Any killer has a learning curve. The game has a learning curve. EVERY GAME has a learning curve. OP asked for killer suggestions and I gave my opinion. Bye lmao
---
Disconnects are different. I'll fool around then. But standard game? No hatch for anyone.
---
Reverse bamboozle + Lithe would be great for buildings like killer shack. We just gotta be creative and think about how a perk would help the other side. An example could be reverse leader, where survivors within whatever distance of each other do actions 25% slower-
---
Imagine michael myers somehow entering a locker so he can head on the shit out of you like if he wasn't scary enough to begin with
---
Because I do enjoy the office meme but you're telling me I dont. You're being a cunt by assuming that.
---
Dull totems are a "side objective"?
---
Imagine a survivor with fire up, getting faster with their main objective
---
Then why did you make a sarcastic comment about it being unfunny
---
XD
---
As a beginner they asked, like I said spirit is not a killer for a beginner
---
I do this for survivors but they don’t realize I’m trying to help so they wiggle out and drop a pallet on me to get away and hide they keep doing this and finally I’m just like fuck it and kill them
---
Never once said it was unfunny, so keep assuming. Should I have just typed "Lol boobs" so it'll be easier for you tiny brain?
---
Wiggling too fast may even be a disadvantage, because sometimes the game doesn't register the keystrokes correctly and you stop progressing the bar.
---
Leave the crapper alone he’s just trying his best
---
Ok you do you
---
He mori cancelled 5 times. Banning him for that is like banning someone for teabagging at pallets.
---
It just doesn’t make sense.
---
Samination gang gang
---
Ah yes, free sprint burst for 5 seconds + instant Healy state, invincibility for 60 seconds, Invincibility when you just got off an hook, having the ability to make chases last longer aren't crutch perks but a per that can be countered before it even activates, oh God only the worst use that :(((
---
Who the fuck types hahahahahaha boobs hahahhahaha, except for a person being sarcastic. Sorry if your brain is that small that you commented that and meant it.
---
I play both dumbass
---
What's the point of this comment? There's no evidence in anything that you said - you're only making yourself look like a fool.
---
behavior: god no
---
It punishes them for not doing a side objective you only sometimes have to do because maybe the killer is running a certain perk. 
---
Obviously the gens being completed doesn't mean you've lost, I never said that. But you are doing worse than if there are 1-4 gens completed and being rewarded for it with a speed boost and instadown.
---
Every other hex totem either punishes survivors for actively making mistakes, rewards the killer for getting hooks or has an effect throughout the game that lets survivors know it's active and they should be destroying totems or even that it's in the game in the first place. Noed does nothing 90% of the game, suddenly punishes them for holding m1 on the thing that actually let them know it would matter throughout the game and then rewards the killer for letting all 5 gens get completed.
---
Sorry you assume so much. Now stop harassing me over something you thought.
---
I hope they do something about the chronic DC'ing some survivors do. When I'm playing survivor and it turns into a 3 man game because someone got salty and quit a minute or two into the game, it gets a little frustrating lol.
---
Haha just watched it, he has a nice voice! That wasn't me though, but vaulting into a spirit looks like something I would do
---
these are awesome. did you make them or order them?
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
Ash always hangs out with the young people
---
I play as Nea and a pig mercilessly killed  our team and she downed me at the end but I was next to a hook so I didn’t wiggle but she walked up to it and shook from side to side like she was saying no and then she brought me to the hatch
---
Just finish the last gen and wait for the tears from killer when adrenaline kicks in for you both.
---
Every fucking time I unhook someone when I have we'll make it
---
I give them a good 20 seconds to stop running until I say fuck it and leave, you can't help stupid

Im done with this silly kindergarden argument, epecially because im not gonna get banned for uncivil behaviour
---
I’m just imagining his character model t posing in the locker with his arms and head poking out
---
what is funny is they did patch the canceling out but bought it back in for unknown reasons
---
Because you start drama. Now go away.
---
I swear i get 6 skillchecks before 40% gen progress
---
Ah, well you know what he thinks about that outfit now lmao
---
I always single repair when the killer has ruin, because I never trust the other player to hit the great, and I never trust them to stop repairing while the gen is frozen. I find that they'll usually miss the skill check entirely and lure the killer because they're trying too hard to hit the great or they'll just stunlock the generator again and again by continuing to work on it while it's already stunned
---
Nice
---
So I should be allowed to suffer just cause some douche tryhard wants fake points?
---
Thank you! I appreciate your kind words! I'm rank 13, and pretty proud when I can pull off moves like these :')
---
to be fair it is not the first time a streamer has lied about a ban not saying this is the case but you never know
---
The best part was it was my first game ever.
---
Oh yeah because a speed boost with a one shot down is so sick.  It should be one or the other, not both.  And like i said.  You're rewarded with adrenaline, they did their objective of gens.  And borrowed time and DS counter camping and tunneling.  Something that is unhealthy for game.  But yeah keep going.
---
Wraith is very simple to use. Ignore the people saying spirit and hag, they will be tough to learn for a beginner.
---
Ah, that makes sense. It also tells me maybe I shouldn't be running around with a bright red shirt on...
---
what toxic thing are they cracking down on? only toxic thing a survivor can do that ik is teabag
---
I feel like its rude to wiggle on last hook
---
Bring the proper perks buddy
---
Wow love the art style
---
Yes, I had a daily, thank you for asking
---
Awesome work buddy!
---
everyone on this post is big mad about NOED haha, I don't even have a reason why I ran it that match, I see it as a useless perk cuz typically if I haven't killed everyone by the time the gates are open it's GG for me already. I was only playing billy for the daily I had, anyways
---
It’s Texas, from the eyes of someone disabled.
---
She was probably teabagging the other survivor, it happens a lot.
---
Yeah nobody should run balanced landing so the killer can catch them instantly /s
---
 What about prayer beads spirit?
---
Yes I am
---
Yeah, I was too tired to even try to play seriously. I only took Bubba because I needed the blood-points fast. And it was pretty fast, with only 2 gens done. People just don't know how to play against him :( 
---
It's so easy to win against him, but altruism gets the better of survivors and they commit to stupid save attempts... It's sad really when you think about it, but from my perspective it just was a quick way to get bloodpoints, even if it cost me like getting 0 pips or losing one (at least I got the BP tho).
---

Hi everyone. I picked up Huntress as killer and got to rank 6 (console) in my first two and a half weeks of playing, while using recently a build composed of Ruin, BBQ, A Nurse's Calling and Whispers. I read this build here and seems to be the way to go with Huntress. Although this helps slowing down the game and detecting Survivors, my question is, should I replace Whispers with a perk that helps me in chases like Brutal Strength or the Hillbilly's one where you get stunned less from pallets? I noticed that I tend to prolong the chases because I miss hatchets sometimes honestly, so maybe one of those perks could help out. Other than that I wanted to know if there is a way to properly figure out the hitboxes of the hatchets and Survivors because sometimes I feel like I shouldn't hit certain throws while others seem obvious to me (I have not been using any kind of crosshair until now). Thanks in advance bois
---
Ordered from a fellow redditor!
---
It's still kind of a dick move to fuck over your teammates like that
---
It's probably because most of us run wglf we'll do anything for our stacks man
---
Well maybe I wanna run something else for once.
---
We need a 5th perk slot
---
Yes, could be that. Didn't think of that. Nevertheless, doesn't make it less enjoyable for me, sorry :)
---
yes,plz put this in the game lol
---
Try Kate Denson's unique perk, Windows of Opportunity. This has saved me from finding myself with no pallets, and goes well with any build!
---
Nailed it.
---
"I hope you brought enough med kits for the whole class"
---
Make it like mobile where each of the perks have their own category
---
Pretty good, here an up vote
---
Shit. That’s one more reason to go to the USA. I’m from Europe
---
Not pointless at all. I still get off the killer's back enough time to make it relevant.
---
Insidious basement time
---
&gt; Stridor to hear killers breathing more, Myers and Pig I'm referring to you.
---
I would be terrified to hear Myers breathing even louder.
---
wiggling off is rare and usually involve the Killer making a mistake.
---
The don’t have a release date like several posts have stated.. just unblock killers and get better ked lul
---
Combine that with resilience and spine chill, get even more faster vaults
---
The huntress chapter has always been free for everyone.
---
But what's urban evasion for
---
I had an amazing time with doctor
---
Don't know what's with all the downvotes. Still, it should be making us play specific killer loadouts, I feel like. Things like legion's crazy purple addon would have been discovered way earlier if we had access to their whole kit to start with.
---
I think they confirmed spine chill doesn't make vaults faster, at least anymore. I could be wrong so please correct me if I am.
---
Wouldn't be the first time a dev/mod/whatever position of power has banned someone over something minor for saying stuff they didn't like, if it did happen. 
---
It's just really weird he got banned for mori cancelling of all things, when he's toxic AF in general.
---
Why does it get worse as you teir up?
---
Lol too funny
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
My Devour Hope was destroyed right when I just started channeling animation, please ban that guy for cancelling my Mori.
---
Fog whisperers are allowed to have an opinion. 
---
And he got banned for exhibiting a toxic behavior, not his opinion.
---
You deserve to get grabbed just like that for using a font like that
---
She has a very rare addon called plaid flannel that lets her see how far she can blink, is that what you are thinking of?
---
Are you sure youre not blinking inside of an object? Also make sure you look slightly up when blinking for more range
---
I'll usually just give the hatch to the last guy if he understands when I'm trying to be nice. Or else I just throw them on a hook.
---
*wake me up inSIDEEEE*
---
I'm talking about the scenario where he closes hatch and you're in dying lol
---
His knees weren’t sore enough yet so he went down for one more go.
---
Ohm
---
Hayden, listen buddy...i come home from a long day at work and want to play a relaxed game...but instead im slugged and wait for an urban evasion or crouching pepega survivor to decide to pick me up or for a killer to camp my slugging body just because he wants to 4k...do u want me to pathetically see myself bleeding for 4 minutes? dc is the only option to go to another game which will be more exciting...u know :) entitled survivor? lmao...just realistic... peace out✌🏻
---
Hmm. I have a level two nurse, but haven’t played her in over a year. It must have been changed.
---
Because staying on a gen for 80 seconds takes skill lmao yeah whatever bye
---
PB Spirit is a right jumpscare, but imo when you notice that you've been stared at for an undetermined amount of time, it's a super creepy type of jumpscare and stays with you for a while.
---
Nah it got added back. It's just not in the description of the perk
---
I did this as Freddy on Xbox to someone who thought I was behind them but I gen-hopped in front of them lol
---
btw the pic is just stretched, i don't play this way
---
They just did it for the clip, you can see the scoreboard at the end.
---
If you play killer and count survivors grunts (they escape on the 10th) every time you are carrying someone, you would change your mind.
---
When you down a survivor right under or right next to a hooked survivor, depending on the map the next available hook will be a considerable distance (in other maps there will be a hook right next to it), causing you to hook that person when he is between his 6th or even 9th grunt. Had a single person body blocked, that person would go free.
---
In maps like Suffocation Pit and Azarovs Resting Place, when a survivor dies in one of the sides taking that hook with him, that whole area becomes a huge deadzone hook wise. 
---
The Game map is also a huge problem because often times you need to find a stairs to either go down or up in order to hook someone. 
---
TL;DR
---
Some maps have way too many hooks and others too few, the current wiggle mechanic when assisted by a single bodyblock will get you free in certain situations.
---
I definitely wouldn't take it personal since there was two of them. I teabag others when I first see them to say hello, emotes are a bit limited for us to communicate when playing survivor. If she was alone and you seen it on BBQ it was directed towards you.
---
If she teabagged you directly during the game it was deserved, if not you were toxic to someone who didn't deserve it sadly, although it was by misunderstanding.
---
Ace is probably in his mid to late 40s, though.
---
Sexy time has begun!
---
Good to know, thanks! I just hope it doesn't get become useless with the status effects.
---
&gt; *If you are hiding behind a wall stalking survivor A, and Survivor B is behind you, you what?*
---
Why would another survivor be randomly passing between me and a map edge?
---
&gt; *You got to Mpve*
---
With that logic, why play a stalking killer then? At any rate, most players will use Ruin, or at the very least the best slowdown perk they have. Stalking takes time because the payoff is the instadown, but if you're not going to stalk then there's really no point to playing a stalking killer...
---
&gt; *What do you do when you hook a survivor and turn to walk away*
---
Firstly, I choose a hook that has the characteristics I desire - it really depends on what's happening at that moment. I am unlikely to be within 32m of the hook (7s walking, 9s crouching) unless everyone is 99% and I'm *expecting* someone to come in for a Borrowed Time save (hard countered by my 0m TR), in which case I can hide almost anywhere I *like* near my chosen hook (and in this situation I would want a hook near the edge so that I can hide on the "edge" side, drastically reducing the odds of a survivor walking into me) so that I can ideally down two people at once. Outside of that very specific scenario, I'm going to be looking for the next Discordance/Barbecue ping, or using Whispers on a gen patrol - and I'll be circling the outskirts of the map, just like I would at game start. There's no reason for me to be in a situation where I'm in a survivor sandwich *unless it's something I've built for and have chosen to do*.
---
**If someone was playing Ghostface by staying in heavy traffic areas, not using cover, and not leaning, with their back to the middle of the map, then I'd have to wonder if Ghostface is really the best killer for them to use.**
---
Im sorry for annoying you, tbh I just wanted to be funny with the "damn minus 5 upvotes" but when you responded swearing I should have just left it like that. 
---
Truth is I usually dont give last hatch to anyone anyway (even when I do they try to wiggle out)
---
Lets just forget this stupid situation shall we?
---
What about a P1 Ash, P3 David, and baby David? We have a variety of different items but get lobby dodged all the time, even tho there's only three of us. I feel some people dodge without knowing why, they just do it because people who know what they're talking about say that THEY do
---
Yeah, I’ve had someone do it to me until I was almost bled out. I didn’t even do anything BM during the game, he just apparently didn’t like having to chase me for so long. 
---
Canceling is okay, but maybe there should be a limit. Like after the 5th cancel it just locks the animation and the mori autocompletes.
---
He really is toxic :D But that's not a reason for banning if he follows the rules. The entire game is toxic. 
---
Who else then got banned for saying stuff? Really don't think these devs would do that though. They might be occasionally incompetent but they're not unfair like that.
---
As a main killer I love when they do this, since I cant give anything back, I usually hit the wall in purpose. Sometimes they  do a little teabag and leave, sometimes they let me hit them to win some more points.
---
Ok don’t @ me but I hate NOED and it ruins the experience
---
Survivors can run instaheals all they want without losing them. So, no. Stop your whining please.
---
I was picked up the other day and carried to the hatch. Killer put me down far enough away that I couldn't just hop in, kicked it closed, then carried me to a hook. I was beyond upset that they trolled me that hard.
---
what? I was trying to reveal him, I was hoping I can but I was wrong.
---
i did that one time. (i was killer)
---
&gt;Can someone tell me when the dedicated servers will be live? i blocked so many try hard killers on mlga and it takes forever to find lobbies (rank 4-6)...
---
Why exactly are you asking for dedicated servers then? MLGA won't work and you'll be going against these killers again.
---
I don't like that either.
---
Also happens, I usually do that to annoying red rankers
---
Exactly!
---
that seems good at first but someone will glitch out somehow or something like that... probably even glitch out with bloodwarden or find a hitbox for the activation promt of the hatch through a wall of the gate....
---
I don’t know it could go either way.
---
Everyone did it at least once, it makes you feel good for a reason
---
1. Likely the 17th
---
2. not sure what you mean. Do you mean getting items like the spooky flashlight or anniversary cake from the bloodweb at Prestige 3? You get infinite bloodwebs once youre at 50 at any prestige and event items will show up in them
---
Or allow us to create a certain amount of perk loadouts that we can switch between quickly in between matches?
---
I think for today, we'll be using the Selfie Mori. You?
---
Where does one get it for mobile? I have an iPhone and have not seen it anywhere
---
WHY IS MY GAME SO BRIGHT?
---
NVIDIA FREESTYLE
---
You want to play vs them again? On dedicated servers you won't have your mlga anymore
---
Correct, he is bing bong boi, not ding dong doi.
---
My favorite part of these is watching them without audio cause you can *see* the scare with the camera shake
---
Whispers is good, but I prefer Discordance. Helps when slowing gens and finding survivors a bit better imo. If you find yourself needing brutal or enduring you can use that though. 
---
For missing hatchets, you really just have to practice. Im not really a huntress main so I dont know how to help you there. Maybe someone else can link you to a good huntress main on youtube?
---
That's something i'd like as well. Like a call of duty class loadout.
---
What pic
---
Welcome to the club
---
Killers just see the item, they can't know the quality or even if you're actually any good with it - therefore they assume the worst case scenario (for them) and act accordingly.
---
Tracking perks are sauce for the goose - if you work together with other survivors then you increase your odds of getting away. If you're the only person pinged by Bitter Murmur, you're in trouble. If you're one of three survivors pinged, you've a good chance of getting away with it.
---
Remember, good killers are thinking about time management - they'll tend to make "efficient" choices, and that's what you want to exploit as a survivor.
---
Wait nvm it took a minute to load
---
Sneak away for a sandwich.
---
Do people not remember that this used to be a thing? (a bug), alot of killers running bond (perks were locked to rank 1 though, still kinda fucked, this was going on with the power change bug for killers I believe, floating head Michael and all that).
---
Happens to me as a big sometimes
---
I didn't DC, It just something I always do to show my angery, you can see me sacrificed in the end
---
Yeah it's just a conspiracy theory some people in his chat were talking about.
---
Apparently he was shit talking the devs really hard earlier before he did the mori cancel thing, and then he gets banned so some people got suspicious. At least that's what I picked up from the 5 minutes I watched his stream earlier to get details lol.
---
The only bloody clothing I had is what Meg was wearing. I’m back to level one as well and I don’t know if that’s normal
---
Second. It makes last minute rescues that much harder.
---
very true, hoping they find a reasonable solution for this.
---
Uhh those arent perks vro those are just perk slot warmers idk wym
---
*Shhhhhhhh*
---
Adrenaline is a strong perk but its not OP
---
NOED is OP when your intention is to get more kills, but its not if your intention is to pip up.
---
We did a... you knwo the rest
---
Noed is good. And im a survivor main
---
I watched a couple of minutes of his stream out of curiosity and he was complaining about being banned for mori spam and not being toxic in end game chat or whatever so... I don’t really feel too bad for him. If you don’t want consequences for toxicity, don’t be toxic.
---
I think it's only been released in some countries. This was released in mine about a month ago but I only started playing 3 or 4 days ago.
---
You can check out their twitter if they announce other release dates, here's the link:
---
Check out Dead by Daylight Mobile (@DbDMobile): https://twitter.com/DbDMobile?s=09
---
Thanks for the reply. As far as hatchets go, I will keep practicing (she is my favourite killer so far). For now I am following on yt TrueTalent which is very skilled on every killer including Huntress but he plays on pc so aiming with a mouse is a whole different story. So any recommendation for Huntress mains on console are greatly appreciated. Thanks again
---
If it lasted like 5 minutes then this becomes "holding the game hostage" and its no longer OK imo.
---
But the banned streamer did it for like 5 seconds.
---
As a killer main, the only way I can see camping being completely gone from the game is like give all survivors a stupid huge bonus to gen repairing speed if all of the survivors are on gens (of course excluding the one on the hook) and the killer is very close/close to the hooked person or something like that. But this fix could be used to punish killer who aren't camping so I don't really know. People just have to understand that camping is not good for the killer most of the time.
---
Is he selling the stuff still? or was it a one time thing?/private? (I really want some)
---
yeah, thanks for pointing him this out
---
It's a really fun club
---
Claudette who?
---
it doesn't look **bad** necessarily, but yeah they could have done more with it.
---
You're right. I must keep my mouth shut.
---
i bought demise of the faithful yesterday..........
---
There's really only two things that I call toxic, and they both stem from the same problem. People being assholes either with teabagging or in chat are shitty and people shouldn't do them, but ultimately they don't create the issue that toxic things do.
---
I think it's toxic when someone is effectively unable to play the game in the first place. I think there are two situations where this happens: when killers camp/tunnel someone early and when swf teams use comms to never be found. Everything else that gets complained about does not prevent people from being able to play, being able to try.
---
That's not to say I think it's never appropriate to camp or tunnel early, but really that only happens once someone gets above rank 7 or so or when someone faces a solid swf team (not a coincidence that this is how survivors can be toxic) because in all other games, it's not a matter of winning or losing but winning while preventing someone from being able to play or winning while letting everyone play.
---
Everything else has counterplay. Everything else allows people to actually play the game. They might lose, but that's how games work.
---
(Also obviously bugs and glitches get included, but those aren't intentionally part of the game and can get people banned)
---
I don't but I didn't join until after Freddy but before Pig.
---
I dont think noed should apply to survivors that haven't been hooked all game and actually win chases. It should be changed into a token perk where it only affects players who have been hooked
---
Then hook him next to hatch and close it afterwards :D
---
Sent!
---
Leader is fairly good I do swap it with prove thyself every once and a while but leader makes the game rub a wee bit faster
---
It was a mess, remember sending an email about it but devs were on vacation and had to postpone a fix.
---
I’ve recently started playing killer, I have my own rules: so long as nobody dc’s, I’ll let the last one go. If I get overly taunted then I’ll do my best to spare nobody!
---
That is a true merciless killer
---
No not at all. However I'm the person who thinks noed and Adreniline aren't toxic(Bc they aren't). It's annoying but hey that means they aren't doing gens
---
Its break my heart how quickly it breaks though. Took ruin in a few matches last night and the survivors exploded it before I could even walk across the map xD
---
Balanced landing is pretty much 1.5 perks in one. The speed boost is amazing, but that passive fall recovery in tandem is unbelievably good on some maps, (especially the new one)
---
sure i will!
---
I missed all the good bugs like 2 killers, Myers with chainsaw and such.
---
honestly with how generally bad ambush is, it wouldn't change that much
---
wtf happened here
---
Why is everyone doing finger-guns except for Ace. Finger-guns are all Ace stands for in DBD
---
Did you prestige the meg the day before if not the rank rest is glitching
---
I like the way you explain setting up a perimeter. My usual habit has just to start tossing around traps around where I spawn until someone starts triggering the area I have zoned off. Being more proactive about beelining to a nice gen cluster sounds like a more methodical approach. 
---
Would you consider agitation worth running over nurse calling? I dont have trapper or nurse leveled up yet for their teachables, so wondering who I should prioritize. I've seen a lot of users recommend the m&amp;a + nurses combo on her. 
---
Thank you for all the information!!!
---
That's the big thing people are missing is that word "including" 
---
Old content including the new. They want you to test all of it in the ptb. Not just the new content. It's not just a demo for the new stuff
---
ahhh it's bait, keep on doing you buddy lmao
---
If you have taken the teachables, they will become available in other survivor's / killer's bloodweb. If you prestige your character, the teachables remain available to other characters and you don't have to rebuy them on lvl 30 / 35 / 40.
---
Prestiging does remove all perk slots, current items, add-ons and offerings, as well as all perks you've collected with that character.
---
I'm not really that worried about it, I'm just goofing lol. We cool.
---
Trust me, it was worse going through it than missing it haha
---
How do I get those perk colors
---
I mean, why not
---
100% those aren't David mains
---
&gt;Not rly, I play with IRL friends the most but thats not often.
---
So you usually play premade dude, wtf are we discussing at. If you met people under 1k hrs most of the time they can't do shit and start tbagging the gen or look for the ruin.
---
We'll pretend 360ing doesn't exist
---
&gt;TL;DR: Things that aren’t toxic: Teabagging, “GG EZ”.
---
You're 100% wrong about these.  They serve no purpose other than to antagonize people.  Toxic behavior.
---
becuzz you're funni
---
Said the rank 20.
---
lmao :D didn’t know this can happen...pepesad
---
Or the Killer's high ping just left me as the last survivor and I just gave up. ~~and then they said gg even though they know 3 people DC'ed cause of the 700ms ping~~
---
Nah I'm just the one looping you for those gens 🙆‍♂️
---
For the most part the game is balanced.  Make gens take 100 seconds, make DS tier 3, 45 seconds.  Get rid of NOED.  You sound like the type of dude who would bash urban evasion if it was meta 😂
---
Is legion fun to play as? I’ve never played as/against legion and am considering buying him with shards.
---
Still better to work through the gen.

---
My dude. Why *wouldn't* you do exactly that? It's literally the prime time to use all your strongest stuff and see how effective it all can be.  
---
In the PTB, the main thing being tested is the new killer. The new killer *will* be using the strongest stuff they can get their hands on, and so will survivors, because what really matters is how well the killer performs at high levels of play with and against the strongest stuff the game has to offer.  
---
If you're gonna go to Reddit and complain about that, then I'm sorry, but you really don't belong on the PTB.
---
These are very nice!
---
None of you know the struggle of trying to get autodidact stacks with randos like I have to run empathy to even be useful
---
At least it was amusing. The main bugs I've experienced is never stop bleeding Wraith with sloppy butcher, giant distorted version of my survivor covering my screen, can't heal/wiggle/escape and so forth.
---
So does it really matter if I continue to repair when missing a great skill check or not? Because I just continue to repair.
---
Best tip to have fun is to give up when you realize it's a spirit and fuck around instead
---
Yeah you're the type of guy who would die to the simplest of the mind games and dc on first hook lmao
---
Claudette Morel AKA: Snoopy Boi
---
To be honest I don’t know what prestige is
---
Yeah you caught me bro 😂 one of the chillest dudes to killer.  But yeee you figured it out.
---
Do I need to wait for the bloodweb update before I prestige? Will it not work if I prestige before the update?
---
STONEWALL. Every 5/4/3 pallets broken the next time you get a pallet dropped on you the stun is negated.  *does not work with spirit fury*
---
KILLER CONFIDENCE. When chasing for 50/40/30 seconds the next chase you enter bloodlust tiers are gained 6/7/8% faster
---
OMNIPOTENT. When a survivor is searching a chest, getting in a locker, or slow vaulting see their aura from 10/15/20 meters away
---
Tbagging is the equivalent of a survivor trying to grab your attention and ignore his team, and “GG EZ” is a deflection weak players use to mask their insecurities, both are inherently harmless unless you choose to let it bother you
---
tunneling is only ok against an OOO user (if you're a stealth killer but its getting changed anywho) or if you're running Dying Light  
---
But sometimes you just run against super organized survivors, nothin you can do  
---
just pick yourself back up and keep goin my guy
---
I'm not kidding when I'm saying on a bad day where I missed every check, I spent 3ish minutes working on a gen because of the sheer amount of skill checks that popped up back to back
---
Yeah your spelling is so great I couldn't understand half of your phrase, and you want to tell me how I have to play?
---
Your trapper idea is almost Freddy's dream snares tho
---
If you enjoy playing games on the hardest settings, yes.
---
The licensed characters (from Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Saw, etc.) will cost actual money but luckily the others can be bought with in-game iridescent shards after grinding levels. The latter will take a good while but it can save you a few bucks if you're tight on cash.
---
Players like Leatherface for his Barbecue and Chili perk but since that was in the Shrine recently it probably won't be on again for a good while.
---
Personally I'd say pick up anyone who seems cool to you. I'm fairly new too without some of the characters with meta perks but I'm still having fun.
---
Definitely wasn't peaking. Was like right out in the open. Like we could have been getting ready for an old west draw. But then my icon is red and I am exposed. Might have been that add on though.
---
Agreed, the way would probably be to fix the bug and not add another hatch or 2nd exit trigger since it stops other mechanics like wiggle
---
Try running Small Game? Things will likely change a bit when the new chapter comes out. People may be cleansing everything soon.
---
These are awesome, could you do Myers in game portrait by chance?
---
I dont like being outted like this
---
Wait what is that
---
Too bad not many people play The Pig anymore. Haven't seen her in a while. I got gen-picked up by The Ghostface not too long ago.
---
It's been a while for me, but if I remember correctly getting a regular skill check stops all progress on the generator but you can still get a skill check during that time. If you fail the skill check or get another normal, it's bad because you'll blow the gen if you miss entirely or freeze it again if you get a normal. It's always better in my opinion to let go of the generator for a few seconds just to let the stun effect end since it doesn't have any negative affect
---
Haha yep yw! I was having the same problem and wondering wtf was up
---
NOED is OP but not by a lot. All we need is a totem counter and clear indication NOED is at play right after the last gen is completed and it should be just fine. Adrenaline is very powerful maybe borderline OP but I feel like if it's going to be changed the whole idea of instantheals should be reworked with it.
---
Yeah let's punish all the killers instead only those who dodge. What about no? 
---
I never dodge so why I should be punished? If you want to tackle that issue, just suggest killers who do this have to wait like 5 minutes to search a game again.
---
2nd exit trigger sounds like a quick solution that they could make work.
---
Holy fucking shit, finally someone said it
---
Haha oh so now were going for spelling.  Low blow bro...low blow.  
---
Lol and if you look way tf back in the thread.  As I said, do what you want, doesnt mean you're not using a crutch. But I see reading comprehension isn't your strong suit.  😥
---
ah fuck autocorrect is a bitch I meant bug
---
yeah but the bug also stops the ability to wiggle,self heal, sabo, and other stuff
---
It is part of my future plans to work on a Myers album.   
---
Currently working towards making something for Sekiro: Shadows die twice
---
At character level 50 there’s a blood tree like normal but there’s a skull in the middle did you hold down the a button on your controller if so you prestige’s up and you got a bloody pice of clothing and every perk and amount of blood points you had are gone but it’s really easy to get them back because the killer would go for the non prestiged
---
&gt; Tbagging is the equivalent of a survivor trying to grab your attention and ignore his team
---
You and I both know that's not why people do it 98% of the time.
---
&gt;“GG EZ” is a deflection weak players use to mask their insecurities, both are inherently harmless unless you choose to let it bother you
---
So we should pretend bad behavior isn't bad behavior because it doesn't ruin the game?  lol k
---
Bond and self care. Nice flex
---
When you get to level 50 with your character you unlock the prestige option, which will totally reset your character but you will win different clothes depending on the prestige.
---
Huntress and Nurse are always free.
---
I had a spirit running prayer beads, mother's Ring, ruin, discord, barbeque, and noed accuse my team of tryharding the other day because a few of us happened to have red add-ons. 
---
It was... surreal, to say the least.
---
Iniatiate a mori and then do it again, and so on
---
^ I second this. As a newer player, I'm currently buying several chapters to try new characters and just taking advantage of the sale over on Humble Bundle. Definitely recommend it for anyone looking to buy new chapters! The only thing to keep in mind is the Ghost Face chapter cannot be bought on there, had to get it full price from steam :(
---
His power is based on a tier system.
---
He starts in tier 1, where he moves slower than any killer besides nurse. He can still catch you but he moves very slowly. In this tier he has a very small terror radius and can sneak up on you.
---
He moves between tiers by stalking survivors, which he does by holding m2 while looking at you. He moves slower while stalking. It takes him around 9? seconds to stalk you to full(It varies on distance i think).
---
In tier 2 he has the same stats as a normal 115 speed killer(trapper is a good example of a 115 speed killer for reference). The only difference is his terror radius is half a normal terror radius. In this mode he can stalk to tier 3.
---
In tier 3, he keeps the same stats as tier 2 except for a slightly longer lunge and faster vault speed and the ability to down healthy survivors in 1 hit. The reason he seems so fast is because of the longer lunge and faster vault speed. He loses tier 3 after 1 minute and is reset to tier 2, where he must stalk again to get to tier 3.
---
He also has an addon that allows him to instantly kill survivors, but that requires him to stalk for much, much longer, and reduces his movement speed.
---
 I would recommend watching some videos of him being played to see how to counter him, as he's my favorite killer to play as and against
---
Oh
---
If you'd play at high ranks you would be not only motion sick lol
---
I always shake my head no if they are wiggling, if they keep wiggling ,they go on a hook, otherwise they get hatch.
---
Especially using it on a baby Dwight. Hehe
---
I think it was kept in the game for the situation where survivors run up to pose with the mori, but if theyre banning for it then ?????
---
90% sure he just flat out wrote that with a pen.
---
very funny did laugh
---
While I don't like NOED, you can counter it by doing bones. Plus, if you learn they have NOED just freaking leave, there is wayyy to much altruism agaisnt NOED and it goes from the killer only having one kill to the killer having a 4k.
---
If I get downed by a guy with NOED I practically have to yell at my buddies to leave rather than trying to rescue me, JUST LEAVE
---
Because killers usually will get almost 4x the blood points of the survivor, it's just nice to give whichever one was able to survive for the longest that 7.5k boost.
---
I barely see ghostfaces anymore but when I do they are like this
---
you still aren't understanding then...   
---
farming, involves letting the killer get max hooks, break pallets, hit players  
---
while letting survivors do gens and heal eachother, along with getting pallet stuns  
---
"getting farmed" is when someone unhooks you in front of the killer, for you to get downed and hooked again immediately   
---
I made it clear which I was talking about and explained to you the difference. And from what he said to you, you were mistaken the whole time... so I repeat what I said from the start, thx for the downvotes
---
That might make sense. I've had some killers Mori cancel me a few times (only like 4 or 5 then they walked away or hooked me) and it never bothered me so it's hard to think of why it's bannable (like I mentioned, unless they do it for several minutes straight and spam it). I think you might be right though, if he was shit talking there might have been more to it.
---
Can imagine those just being annoying, remember myself ragequitting back then which I usually don’t do (but when a michael without terror radius, a floating head oneshots you because he has a chainsaw you can’t hear or see and he’s using bond) it just got frustrating, had some though putting a trapper trap as my item on survivor and showing the killer where I was constantly.
---
11th commandment: If thou wiggles, thou shall be yeeted on a hook
---
Adrenaline +exhaustion perk is fine imo. If the last gen is completed and you're exhausted you won't get the sprint burst but you will still heal one health state.
---
Thanks, dude. Besides my body parts not being fully attached and my father being a complete piece of dogshit...Things are going hauntingly well.
---
*-Spirit-*
---
camping is being on the map after hooking a survivor- samination,circa some time
---
Bold assumption. Rank 4 survivor here. I wouldnt expect any less from someone who. Makes excuses dor their lack od skill 😬
---
Cold as fucking ice.
---
Classic Myers.
---
Tbagging serves no other purpose aside from grabbing a killers attention, doing it under any other context accomplishes nothing, and is therefore irrelevant. Being a cunt in chat is something weak players do, that’s just how it is, let them learn and grow, we can chastise them if they get out of hand, but meaningless comments aren’t a big deal unless you let them bother you
---
ew xbox xbox sucks the only good console is the leap pad
---
Oh boy, smooching time!
---
Sucks to be you
---
I don't recall another skillcheck popping up right after I failed one. Maybe it's been patched?
---
is sexy not a fog whisper anymore?
---
You can gen tap, but its ineffective. Id recommend using practicing great skill checks, they arent super difficult if with some practice. If you hit only a good skill check, let go of the gen until it stops sparking. You dont make any progress when its sparking and youre risking missing another ruin skill check and losing more progress
---
Possibly, it's been months since I last played
---
Others have mentioned it was because he was talking trash about the devs in his stream, which might have something to do with it (I don't follow streamers at all so I wouldn't know). 
---
I think it's a bit...odd that mori cancelling would be a bannable offense. If it's just doing it a few times then killing, hooking, or letting them go after then whatever, that's fine. I can understand if you did it like 50 times for a minute or two straight how that would be along the lines of griefing but outside of that....I don't get it.
---
I've had killers mori cancel me a handful of times before and it never bothered or bugged me. I got a chuckle.
---
If that's solely the reason he was banned I'd like to know what category/offense it falls under.
---
Leatherface gets so much hate for the people that camp, but moments like these change views
---
r/fuckemojipolice
---
Thanks
---
I think you're in the wrong subreddit
---
Intention now determines the objective strength of a perk? 
---
Do you read what you type?
---
Exactly but normally 2-3 times then kill you lol
---
&gt;Hayden, listen buddy...i come home from a long day at work and want to play a relaxed game...
---
I can't care less about your life.
---
&gt;but instead im slugged and wait for an urban evasion or crouching pepega survivor to decide to pick me up or for a killer to camp my slugging body just because he wants to 4k
---
Blame the emblem system that punish you in many ways. It's a common strategy to get a 4k without being punished hardcore by the mechanics of the game just to give more and more chances when you shouldn't. Also the matchmaking that is broken rn matching people with potatoes unless you're swf
---
&gt;want me to pathetically see myself bleeding for 4 minutes? dc is the only option to go to another game which will be more exciting...u know :)
---
You could also bring, idk, unbreakable? Look for the hatch or a better spot with tenacity? Dcing just because you don't give a f about others but only about yourself does actually make you entitled. You are entitled to enjoy your game and DC when you get annoyed about something regardless of others is the peek of entitlement, you can do it but then don't cry when people call you out on that
---
&gt;entitled survivor? lmao...just realistic... peace out✌🏻
---
As I explained before, yes
---
Realistic? Yup if we are gonna talk about reality you should acknowledge your entitlement and not caring about anyone involved in the game except your own fun. If so I suggest you to play offline games instead
---
Get in a chat with them for the game. I’m assuming you have a headset. Don’t act like the elites are the only way to communicate with other players
---
Sure it’s wrong if they banned just because they don’t like him but he does seem to be toxic most of the time
---
I think they’re both fine, but I’d like if NOED gave an indication that it was active before someone got downed.
---
"I already say that I dont use noed, How ashould i" the pot calling the kettle back.  This is the internet, not a fucking college essay. I could tear your whole comment apart and show you how it "should be written", but once again, this isn't an essay. So shut your bitch ass up.
---
Think of it like a kind of watching thing, I'm going off of some of the movie stuff where he would watch the characters and then they would notice
---
Essentially it would be an interaction that he casts, that slowly afflicts a survivor ( similar to old freddy ) except once the "cast" finishes, the survivors screen would get ripped towards PW ( similar to hag ) and they would get the debuff / more afflictions to the debuff ( similar to doctor's shock ) 
---
If that makes sense lol
---
No idea what these are, but they are awesome. Could you explain this? :)
---
I’m dying.
---
Even if you cant hit skillchecks the gen will be done eventually. Running around like a headless chicken for 15 minutes helps nobody
---
Well atleast you got the points...
---
Emotes *
---
Someone call the police, this guys already see it elsewhere
---
This happened a while ago. A plague using the generator corrupt purge thingy, noed, ruin, corrupt intervention and infectious fright straight up destroyed us. I was the last survivor and there was nothing I could do. As I stand peacefully she full vomits on me, downs me with noed and takes me to hatch. Then closes it and moris me.
---
STOP YHE PRESS EVERYONE. This guy has already seen this before.
---
Amen
---
Getting hit while unhooking is probably the easiest, just make sure you have Borrowed Time so the other person doesn’t get farmed
---
29 times to be specific...:-)
---
A ding ding ding  
---
Meeting shall now come to order
---
Many people don't have a headset or simply don't want to talk to strangers
---
Playing as trapper getting trap daily. I used Diamond stone because I didn't want a second Match with the killer queue. I think I got like 12 traps. Final 2, I found the hatch, and put a couple traps by it. Was carrying the final Claudette to the hatch when she wiggled out and stepped on a trap running to the hatch. That was a serious dilemma whether to let her go, again, or punish. I was merciful that day, but it was tough.
---
PC
---
Not a bad perk idea at all. But add the ability to do a super jump! J/k btw
---
I wish they could do the hallowed blight again, like.. make it an annual thing. Or at least something similar
---
You don't even need to stun, if you flash a Nurse they can't charge a blink unless they turn away.
---
That head bob from Demi Logorgon is a lot cuter than it should be
---
nothing about iron maiden is op on doctor
---
its good for gimmicky bs when a survivor hops out of a locker nearby but the exposed effect is too short for you to actually make major gamechanging things
---
i use it on him every once and a while but at most i get 1 insta down
---
it’s really only good on léry’s
---
Wow this post again
---
True lol. I said that before he showed that video
---
Yeah, spooky flashlights and cakes and stuff. So event items are available!
---
GF is so wonky. I like the concept but it’s so awkward
---
Oh, ok well I’m pretty sure I’m a good trapper
---
Understandable
---
Hes fun but he isnt very good. He is good for bloodpoint farming though
---
wonder why
---
Oh you're 12. Well that's explain the excessive use of the emojis. Share those stats, I'll wait. Also, I can hit skillchecks in case you were wondering, but sadly it's not a metter of hitting them if the other players can't do it, and can't loop a killer for more than 10 seconds. If you were so good playing SOLO, you would've been rank 1 and not stuck in rank 4.
---
Yesterday I had a game where it was two yellow rank and two red rank survivors vs a purple rank killer. The two yellow ranks went down super quick and me and the other red rank did our best but theres only so much you can do.
---
Neither bother me because it makes the game easier for me.
---
I blame Otz for trapper propaganda
---
Ok, I thought it was just me who got scared when running into tier one Myers
---
Never said you werent, for being your  first games you are already placing traps at the shack which is a great and smart strategy. The part about running into the same trap is what I mean with rabk 20's being pretty bad
---
It’s not the fact that they’ll die/lose a lot. It’s more so the experienced players that hang around in low ranks and will insult them and just to get off on bullying new players. Hence my post above. Another example was how literally in my first week of playing the game I was called a f**got just for doing badly in the game. I took it in stride, because I’m new and I’ve seen enough of the toxicity that it didn’t put me down too much. But that was still coming from a rank 13 to a rank 18 baby Wraith/Trapper (can’t remember who I was).
---
Except they did put themselves in that position. You don’t NEED one, but you’re much better off with one. I can free dive with a shark with no form of protection, but I’d be better off with some. Its a 4 player game when playing survivor, obviously communication is gonna make for an easier experience. You don’t want to communicate, that’s fine, but it’s the decision YOU as a player chose. Don’t bitch about not being able to communicate when you most certainly could have
---
Clearly you haven't met my friend PatheticNoobYT

I don't get it. Why people do that?

Oh nice! This is the first time that i have seen this post around here

I get really close a lot when i run decisive and deliverance, because using both perks and escaping almost gives you 8k escape points

Amazing stuff. Good job 👍
---

---
Clearly not, for the most part then
---
For me it's when I hit them and they dc. I want my bbq stack dang it &gt;:(
---
u r suggesting that i should prophylactically bring antislugging perks because the killer decides to play this kinda way? why should i change the way i play? lmao
---
how am i ruining others gameplay by dcing when i said im dcing for the 4th survivor to get the hatch? 
---
if u r referring that i mess with the killers experience...u r entitled and want to get the 4k which btw will not give u a 2pip...guess why! because u slug. 
---
4k doesnt necessarily mean pip or 2pip
---
if the killer makes my experience insufferable then im dcing and to finish ur endless charade, the dc button exist for a reason...if its there i might as well use it.

When I get hatemail telling me how to play. It gets exhausting.
---
I personally just ignore people trying to be toxic, since a reaction is what they want, but nobody can get upset with you rightfully for tunneling him if he started off trying to ruin your match for you first
---
You’re fucking dumb. I never said people need to ruin their own experience, but if you make the decision to not talk to your teammates, don’t expect to have it as easy as the people who do. They can communicate where totems are, they can make sure they don’t get hit with NOED. You aren’t entitled to anymore then that, because you make the decision to not communicate. God damn some of you people are brick walls

Your post was removed for the following reason
---
Rule 7- The subreddit is not a self advertisement platform
---
It’s a great feeling when you’re running Adrenaline and have a key ready to go. That triggers the Killer real good.
---
I saw this already
---
My initial problem was the suggestion of a counter. If there was a totem counter, it wouldn’t would as a simple solution to NOED, it would in essence take it out of the game.  The perk would never go off. Survivors would look at the counter, and see that if any  totem remains, they’d  take it out everytime just to be safe. What you’re proposing isn’t a solution, it’s borderline erasing it. Solo shouldn’t be as strong as SWF, because SWF is already the strongest thing in the game. You guys need to understand you’re asking for a perk that already can be countered, and doesn’t even activate till end game, to be weakened. You don’t have to like it, I don’t, but what most people propose doesn’t make any sense

Wow, what's that? Like 7% difference between the two? Your argument just collapsed on itself. A majority of the randoms who ultimately cause their team to fail are green ranks and under.  I can hit skillchecks but sadly i get the holy fuck tunneled and camped out of me seeing as i play in a swf more than I play solo.

A majority of the pseudo-infis in the game are achieved by having balanced landing. Truth is the stagger reduction should be on a cooldown at least if it's still going to work when exhausted.   
---
People tend to get super pissed when you point that out though and I expect a shitload of downvotes for this.
---
When these type of suggestions get thrown out, (and I mean no offense for what I’m about to say), it becomes painfully clear that the person who suggest it only plays one side. Think about how strong your suggestion makes one perk then multiply it by 4. It doesn’t seem fair to multiply it right, because it’s just your perk. But there’s 4 survivors and one killer, so mathematically you HAVE to when considering balances between survivor and killer.
---
Do you honestly believe a killer should have to dance circles to hook you? Guess what becomes the new meta? Camping. DS already punishes tunnelers. It also punishes really good killers and rewards really bad survivors. I’m not sure what else you want from a single perk.
---
Well well we’ll if it ain’t the unoriginal cunt
---
Bing bong
---
Based on a true story. I've seen it.
---
Is ghost face any good as a killer? I was considering buying him.
---
Just report the post and move on guys
---
Legion need some therapy
---
Yeah, I wouldn't have continued with the game. It only becomes personal after that. The exploiter won't see their behavior as the problem. They'll just be angry that you ruined their fun. 
---
Ending the game just cuts to the chase and it gets you into another game faster. Mind you, that's one of the few times I'd DC. If I'm getting spanked or playing bad, I'll happily go down with the ship.
---
A couple days ago I was Spirit and I absolutely dominated the survivors but then when I closed the hatch I found Claudette and she just walked towards me and stood in front of me. I couldn’t kill her because of her puppy eyes so I let her go. If she ran I would’ve killed her but for some reason her giving up and accepting her fate made me sympathetic
---
Ok it’s time I actually look into what makes prayer beads so fucking op
---
Is there really a BP multiplier for repairs in the terror radius, or was it just because of Prove Thyself?
---
I feel 32 meters on left behind is a bit much, would prefer it to be around 20 at max, but good changes to perks that needed them.
---
GET ON 🛵
---
emblem multiplier.. helps you do very well easily in the emblem scoring, not so much blood points.
---
i appreciate your support
---
well 32 meters is way more than the hearing distance
---
I'm taking away your comment privileges
---
Not disgusting probably looked fucking disgusting for the billy tho messing with the survivor movement like that
---
He’s a solid mid tier. Super unique gameplay so it’s very worth
---
My hate for people who play annoying characters
---
If I'm the last one downed and everyone else is dead, I never wiggle. No point to really try at that point. That and I don't in hope's that the killer will me hatch. Every time they are nice enough to give it to me, I make sure to thank them lol
---
You thought I was another survivor, but it was me Ghostman!
---
As a friendly Pig main I like to imagine you're one of the survivors ive let go &lt;3
---
I always get furious when I see People throw down pallets after getting Hit....Like why?! the Killer needs to stop anyways
---
Didnt even think about being drunk! Yes, they’d be destroyed on a drunk DBD night for sure lol
---
Straight fire.
---
Yeah but if you're wiggling when last alive it's almost patronising to the killer as you think you have a chance of getting out. If the last survivor wiggles, I kill them. If not, I give hatch.
---
While it does suck when they teleport like that, it is the result of the fix that prevents them from getting trapped inside the pallet, literally costing them the game.
---
It doesn’t matter when you prestige. When the new bloodwebs roll out, it will be reflected whenever you level next and generate a new bloodweb
---
Holy shit that’s good
---
Nice job! I just my Rank 8 back this morning.

Platform: PC (ptb)
---
Type of Bug: ingame
---
Description: The Demogorgon tried climbing through a window where I was crouched on the other side. This caused him to just glide around the map in the crawl formation. Managed to get him to follow to a pallet and once stunned it reset him to where he could move normally.
---
Video though not the best quality; https://youtu.be/Kr_c9CECEpg
---
What?
---
This is late but I never heard anything about him and kids, thought they were all over 18
---
Its not extremely complex to understand this concept.
---
Its like saying urban evasion is good if you want to play immersed but it sucks if you want to mostly run at the killer
---
Considering identity v is a free game and dbd is not what’s really there to compete? The only things u can buy in identity v are skins and characters but you can get all the characters free from just playing the game. They both have the 1v4 style gameplay but it has its own mechanics and perks only able to be used by its own character so it’s not the same both are still very fun tho
---
But it doesn’t so it’s the best currently aside from Adrenaline.
---
#she has ASCENDED
---
Yeah but still. Its a petk banking on you being the last survivor alive and the killer not already knowing where the hatch is
---
Agitation vs. A Nurse's Calling is really a question of playstyle - I'm very much playing to keep people in a certain area, and Agitation makes that happen. A Nurse's Calling is good on an aggressive build, where you're bouncing between traps and hitting survivors left, right, and centre - it's a lot easier to reacquire survivors when your Terror Radius is *tiny* and they're being lit up by A Nurse's Calling.
---
Iron Grasp is the budget version of Agitation, it's a general perk so there should be no issues there. You won't move as fast, which means survivors have more time to pop all your traps, but you can still cover a fair distance. Sloppy Butcher can help slow survivors down a bit too, even if you don't have A Nurse's Calling to capitalise on it - time spent healing is time away from gens, and that's always good.
---
I wouldn't say one playstyle is stronger than the other - they're both pretty valid, it's just a question of which works best for you.
---
He is a low tier killer, not as good as Myers. 
---
You will struggle against higher ranked and skilled survivors. 
---
I enjoy using him in custom games against friends. He can be fun. I use him mainly only when I don’t want to rank up but still get points, and when his daily pops.
---
Honestly for me, I was disappointed after I purchased, he’s fun but not as fun as I thought he would be. He’s a weak killer cause he can be taken out of his power. However when you get matched with lower ranked survivors that don’t know exactly how to play against him he can be really fun and successful. 
---
Also you can teabag with him ;)
---
I would have downvoted if you use the incorrect term of “infinites”
---
I shall spare you.
---
Yeah, there is a cone. So what? I still don't get it since it doesn't affect much, the distance of the lunge still the same, it's just a visual problem but still can tell when a lunge would hit you or not
---
Did you fact check that?
---
Nope. Huntress, Bill, and Nurse are all free.
---
Imagine someone getting downed. You are there with a flashlight ready to save. 
---
But the killer goes away and there is a possibility of just going to the survivor and healing him, or in this case pick him up on your shoulder. Move to a different place and heal there. 
---
Someone else suggested being able to recover while being carried. Could be nice?
---
Gears shouldn't be a hex.
---
How did you get these because ima get this as my perk set up
---
You know chess is a game about capitalizing on mistakes right?
---
Hex: Bloddy (assuming bloody) Gears is waaay too strong. Every time a gen gets done the survivors can't do gens for 35 seconds? That is soooo much time to be forced to do nothing productive.
---
In the opposite direction, Unseen Footprints isn't beneficial and it has a downside rofl. 4 seconds of no scratch marks after you just got hit is actually worthless. The killer isn't going to lose track of you if they just hit you. All the perk does is give yourself hemorrhage lol.
---
Thanks again, good luck to you too with your games
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
this was a risky click...
---
I was actually thinking about this today. I got about 150 hours into this game. Not once have I broken free with a struggle. I usually just don't even bother and let myself get hooked. When I first got the game, I would mash the struggle keys so hard. Now I'm just like meh.
---
Though I think this is interesting. However, massively over complicated aha. How about jack of all trade applies when - if you heal another player you have an option to swap perks with them
---
Ye
---
Oh, it was Hag I was thinking of
---
IMO try a few games with each build to get a feel for what works better for you.
---
I find that Ruin, M&amp;A, Nurses, and Sloppy Butcher are a good combo for me at mid ranks. SB makes healing take longer so you're more likely to catch people with Nurse's it. M&amp;A pairs nicely with Nurses since it increases your FOV and lets you get closer before they notice your terror radius.
---
Lol you do realize by your logic adrenaline has a counter? It’s counter is just not let all the hens get done
---
*SIGNED*
---
I played as Hag for a long time before I found that out.
---
Rest In Peace pancake flipping nurse
---
Unless the killer is ghostface and he shuts the hatch and just teabags you until you die
---
Basically she can just surprise you whenever she wants without any sound indication
---
Yeah the game definitely doesn't hold your hand for some things
---
It was, but you've done it

---
Run Bond.  It's superior to Empathy in almost every way except range.
---
No way. It is powerful enough to be used by most red rank survivors, that says something. Another perk that might work as an alternative deterrent like a borrowed time that applies to yourself would be welcome but ds does not deserve a buff.
---
You've died twice because of it?  I've had dozens of games completely thrown away because I got stuck  in a pallet. Unlike dying if you get stuck, you either have to wait for the survivors to get out, or DC. Several times I've had the survivors just taunt for 15+ minutes before they decided to leave. All the change does is spit you out on the side they're closer to. Compared to literally becoming helpless for the rest of the match I'd say it's a pretty decent fix, if it's consistently happening to you try throwing the pallet earlier so they won't be on the same side.

Okay, first of all, if you're just looking for some excuse to bitch about other players and assume that the many, many people who object to NOED are just plain lazy, then go right ahead. Rant and rave and have a little hissy fit all you like.
---
Meanwhile, other folks are gonna have a proper discussion on game design, DbD's philosophy of passively influencing behavior, and how NOED doesn't quite fulfill that philosophy. We don't need you bringing pissy reductionist politics into this.
---
So if all you've got is insults, you can kindly make like a P3 Claudette, and disappear. Either way, it's obvious I'm not gonna get an actual conversation here, so I'm not even gonna bother reading whatever reply you're planning to fart out. And we're deep into the nested comments by now, so there's really no reason to bother. Good day.
---
P.S: Nice lack of reading comprehension. I'm not sure how you managed to miss the word "exposed", or the phrase "work like a regular hex".
---
I have like 74 hours in the game :D started a month ago playing it
---
"Killer is spirit" is all that's needed to make me give up on life
---
Just learning the ins and outs of all the obsession perks is a research project and the in game tutorials are so sparse and rarely updated, it's hilarious.
---
I think they'll do the same or something similar this year, but with way less blood points and just as much grind.
---
That's if they have an event at all, which I'm not sure they even will.
---
Nahhh I’m with the boyssss
---
Que the two Spider-Mans pointing at each other.
---
I'm sorry little one. r/dbdgonewild
---
Ah, sorry, just a salty veteran remembering the bad old times
---
&gt;u r suggesting that i should prophylactically bring antislugging perks because the killer decides to play this kinda way? why should i change the way i play? lmao
---
It's called adapt. I know you are so lazy that you wanna play in the same way against every killer, not even trying to adapt to different mechanics or strategies since would be too difficult but the reality is you should. You have the option but instead you are an entitled kid that want to play the same way and win doing the same thing over and over again, something that doesn't happen even in MMOs these days. So yeah, like killers adapt their playstyle for each killer they play or the survivors meta or the whole game meta, also you have to adapt
---
If you cannot understand this I don't know what to tell you, I can't speak Boomers language
---
&gt;how am i ruining others gameplay by dcing when i said im dcing for the 4th survivor to get the hatch?
---
Depriving points for the killer to a deserved 4k and sacrifice points that influence the emblems. If you do that you cannot ever blame the killer to do anything, camping, tunnelling etc because you do worse
---
&gt;if u r referring that i mess with the killers experience...u r entitled and want to get the 4k which btw will not give u a 2pip...guess why! because u slug. 
---
Oh that's cute. Welp, you are entitled to ruin a game to someone else just because there is no repercussion. It's because of people like you we should have a matchmaking punishment, like in any other game, for dcing. Btw why slug would make you not 2pip? It doesn't make sense
---
&gt;4k doesnt necessarily mean pip or 2pip.
---
"Makes my experience insufferable" for being slugged? Bring unbreakable.
---
4k doesn't necessarily means 2 pip but you are depriving someone of extra BP trying to abuse a hole in the system by dcing and actively trying to deprive people of those.
---
"The dc button exist for a reason"
---
Yes, also in any other game where a team vs another team face each other exist that button. But guess what, they get punished and is usually used if you have some emergency not if you feel entitled to throw a middle finger to the other side. I know using your brain is difficult but anyone would know that if they played ANY online game before. You can use it (abuse it) but then when they will introduce, hopefully soon, punishments for people like you, don't complain.
---
Welp based on your mindset, you can't complain period since you actively abuse the dc button to create a situation where the opposing team would get in a bad position and incapable of changing playstyle depending on the situation.
---
So, people like you are really the worst players anyone could encounter, hopefully they will do the same to you dcing before you get out so you get 0bp and no pip from the match. It's something that people like you deserve no matter which side they play
---
Hahaha no problem dude
---
Nothing in this game balanced, except Nurse, because she floats.
---
Im sorry but the crapper is clearly better than the trapper. For one, the crapper doesnt have to run around the map picking up his craps to place them down later. He just has to crap. Another thing- he has a dope terror radius: (Here comes the crapper, you better watch out for his craps). Finally, the fear that I feel when i step in a pile of the crappers crap and get my leg stuck cant compare to the slight agony of a bear trap biting into my leg. Fucking hell, its a bear trap, not a human trap.
---
You don't even want to get me started on the crappers teachables.
---

Servers are down for everyone, don't worry about it mate.

Okay, I gotta be honest, I jumped in my seat just now.
---
you can use a cypress to intimidate the survivors with your black offering
---
Where's that transition ○_°
---
Lotta people calling pseudos  simply "infis" just weren't around when real infinites still existed. A loop that's such a bad freaking idea to chase that it'll lose you multiple gens to do so is not the same thing as an infinite. So I respect where you're coming from bro.
---
GitGud
---
They would have all got disconnected.
---
Did it happen to be on red forest on PC?
---
Again wrong. Stop assuming. He wasn't civil. That's why the mods removed his posts.
---
So kinda like jumpscare Myers build but... fucking invisible
---
I kind of like the idea of it deactivating after another player is hooked but having a potential 8 decisive strike escapes in one game is ridiculous.
---
ill see if the killer is friendly but if they arent im just gonna loop them as long as possible and then die on first hook.
---
Just happened to me too. Worst part is it was just at the very end of the game, when the last survivor made it through to the hatch. So I got an "Entity Displeased" followed by the game crashing.
---
He so cute
---
I like the idea but to effectively use this it would be better as an ultra rare offering. Because in this state you would probably want to swap out it and the other ones you want to swap out making it normal to get two or more levels of penelties.
---
I still try most the time as killer or survivor, I wouldn’t be as upset at the killer as I would the survivors as we both lose do and bps that way. Sometimes I’m friendly as killer if it’s the last one or a glitch happens that just destroys them.
---
oh darn, i completly forgot the cooldown for attention seeker! I was thinking of either it working like pebble or gaining a token after a person as been hooked
---
Says the one who DC because get slugged.
---
Pfft entitled "pepega" survivor
---
Pretty damn good looking for someone that age.
---
The guy came here and assumed I didn't like the post because I typed it in a way he felt wasn't appropriate. I told him to stop being a cunt and causing fake drama.
---
I'd pay good money for a DLC that gave the option to play against bots to test things out.
---
No, sadly. It was Prenn Asylum on mobile
---
Same tbh
---
Without testing EVERYTHING, we wouldn't know about the bugs that are not on the new characters.
---
That aside, I don't know how many people need to test out the meta perks, but I think we can say we have a ton of data about the most hardcore Gen rushes VS omega Mori nurse.
---
Jesus I didn't even know that, I thought they'd just twitch randomly now and then. Thanks for educating me!
---
found the guy who thinks Spirit has “mindgames” lol
---
Noob doctor doesn't know he gets a guaranteed hook grab if he uses shock instead of punishment for m1
---
Pretty much

One of yours as well since you called them a cunt which is uncalled for
---
Have not watched Stranger Things S3. I was talking about Freddy
---
You don't have to apologize or feel guilty about the servers going down, problems with your internet/storms, pets or younger siblings doing something that yanks the plug, etc.
---
It works for that but for the most part, I see it being used by survivors to play fast and loose, it's like a minute of star power after being unhooked.
---
As you can see we have some new members
---
Yup! A very good idea
---
It removes all sound during phasing including footsteps
---
Would you mind removing the player name if you decide to repost this? Thanks.
---
It’s over, Kate! I have the high ground!
---
Prayer beads or not the recovery and charge addons are still bullshit and make for a sweaty ass game. She can teleport around the map with very little concern for saving her power
---
Yes
---
Oh I know. I'm not saying what I said to him was nice. But starting drama for no reason was set me off.
---
Imagine SPAMMING it lol, endless screaming would make me alt f4 lol, I need this perk in game!
---
I don't think it's even just the last 4 patches. Like 2 years ago I had it happen to me once. I let the killer get the last hit on me for points, downed me and there was exit hitbox. Ended up crawling around for a minute before deciding to crawl into the void below which happened to warp me directly onto the hatch, but I'm not sure if it was meant to send me to the hatch or to a fixed location on the map that happened to have the hatch.
---
Sometimes people think they can get around one more time and get hit right when they drop it. Unless you mean the killer is like 10 meters away then yeah
---
Dead Hard 2: Dead Harder
---
this shit has happened to me countless times across several killers. Makes me turn the game off for days at a time.
---
Oh no you have to play differently atleast it’s not nurse and you can actually do things do get away from spirit
---
I love doing this! More fun than killing everyone, cause then I would be alone. Again
---
Not sure how it normally lasts as this is the first I've participated in but yesterday the official dead by daylight page over on twitter posted it had two more days.
---
Not sure you'd get a big benefit from Brutal Strength or Enduring - survivors on a pallet can often be an easy hatchet, per [ScottJund's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQRDijaX5Io&amp;t=12m45s) (12m 45s). Besides, Whispers is one of the most important perks on Huntress because it cuts down on time spent patrolling an area that survivors are *nowhere near* - remember that Huntress is *slow* for a killer.
---
&gt; *if there is a way to properly figure out the hitboxes*
---
The rule of thumb is that everything is a little wider than it appears to be.
---
depends, are they T H I C C enough?
---
Its all good, as long as you didn't keep calling him that and being uncivil too (which you didnt).
---
Why is this nsfw
---
Let me introduce you to our lord and savior Spine Chill
---
Its a parting gift
---
If spamming the mori for a minute can be classed as griefing wouldn't slugging after the hatch is closed come under this category too? (just wondering what people's thoughts about this is)
---
I mean like when you smack them and then they drop it. you usually can tell if you can make another round, or at least you should in Red ranks
---
This is my favorite thing on reddit. More of these. Need em.
---
I mean hes not the best but im rank 4 and i get 4ks with him like 90% of the time.
---
You should include your desired rank.
---
You will need perks to counter Legions flaws.  most will recommend Sloppy Butcher and Bloodhound because you lose scratch marks while you're in Frenzy. Since Legion kills slower than most Killers you'll need to slow the game down with perks like Ruin.
---
This is literally impossible according to the wiki's explanation of the emblems system
---
You know how hat they say about good intentions
---
 "Is no one alarmed by their clones running up to them?" 
---
Fucking LOL
---
Yeah, and I regret calling him a "cunt". Had a big test for my GED today so I was already in a mood. Sorry for the commotion. Next time I'll just ignore it instead of being a ass back.
---
You're insane. I play trapper and he would be viable if he could carry 2 traps as part of his base kit. This other shit is nuts
---
I've never seen a friendly killer.  Would like to though.
---
Honestly this is how it feels
---
Everyone gets like that at some point, no need to apologize for it! As long as you didnt keep at it for many more comments or commenting something like kys to him.
---
It would only apply if you actually tunnel someone. It could also deactivate after being healed.
---
Fun is going to be a subjective thing - I'd suggest watching some streamers so that you can get a rough feel for whether or not Legion is your kind of thing.
---
In terms of perk value, Discordance is pretty useful for several killers. I wouldn't really rate the other two at the moment, although Iron Maiden might make a comeback when the Stranger Things update hits.
---
Legion is very good at finding and injuring survivors, not so good at downing them. If you have Save the Best for Last unlocked (Myers teachable) then it gets a lot easier to seal the deal - Legion's Feral Frenzy builds stacks, even though it doesn't benefit from the perk, and you can very quickly max it out within two activations. When everyone is injured and crowding you, you'll find it a lot easier to drop them all with the improved recovery.
---
Is there a confirmed release date for Stranger Things?
---
100% sure that killer reported him for hacks.
---
Think you cancelled it and press the skillcheck at the same time, so it went down even more.
---
As far as I know, we been complaining about operation health because what the fuck did it really even do. The game I'd argue is in a worse state now then it was then, though I also really only started playing at all like earlier last year.
---
Some people, myself included, have been asking for an operation health 2.0 because there is so much nonsense with the game and each season adds more on top of it. Current season has had the worst audio issues of any game I think I've ever played. Countless times where footsteps are coming from the polar opposite end of where they should be. One that comes to mind is pushing up a staircase where I knew 2 people were, hear footsteps directly above me, one of my friends hears it as well and makes sure I heard it. Nope, few seconds later dude kills me from the 1st floor just to the right of where I was. Dude fully sprinted like half way across the map and somehow I heard his footsteps on the 2nd floor directly above me.
---
Yeah, I'd never wish death on someone for a reddit disagreement. hahaha Thanks for understanding.
---
Nice!  I recently rolled a self-save as well, right after opening the gate and unhooking my teammate.  We both ended up getting away :)
---
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrekt
---
NP, good luck on your GED!
---
How do you open doors as killer? I thought there was a way to did this with the Endgame collapse update to mindgame the survivors?
---
If you've done something wrong, you'd get the message about being banned.
---
Are you trying to play during "prime time"? Are you in a region that doesn't have many players?

Are you on ptb and what's your main build?

I’m gonna guess the downside of it being a hex though means first time it pops survivors are just gonna use that 35 seconds to find and destroy it
---
Good, it's annoying when killers camp until the entity takes the last survivor.  Just hook them or let them crawl out.
---
Bloody gears basically defeats the purpose of thrilling tremors
---
Doing what?

Holy fuck, I just got into it and popped up that

thing and at the bottom of my phone screen I could see a tittie.
---
Holy damn, I won't be visiting it ever again.
---
You mean to say doing anything you can as survivor to, ya know, survive, is patronizing?
---
You could do that now, it'd still be on a timer and still deactivate after hooking someone, it'd literally only punish people who tunnel the same person right off the hook twice in a row.
---
I've had games where there were two people on a hook and one down and a generator still gets done. How much more pressure do I need to apply exactly?
---
There was no nearby hook. Wasn’t going to let anyone escape. Plus the clock had already ticked all the way down to about 1/4th left before I got Goblin boy to the ground.
---
Oh god. Imagine him not only leaping at you but also shocking you at loops etc
---
Not confirmed, but usually around 2 weeks after the PTB release is when the update comes out.
---
No, but if you're the last person and you've been downed and picked up, you have an extremely small chance of wiggling off before you get hooked so why try? It's almost rude.
---
How so?
---
Takes you to basement.

Yeah, 5 minutes games sucks for everyone, but in most cases (i.e. when it's not a 4-man toxic SWF with toolboxes and Prove Thyself, which makes for a very low percentage of all games), it's more the killer's fault than survivors. If you can't apply pressure, gens are done. 
---
Most "genrushs" I've seen are in solo queue, no coordination or will to "genrush" whatsoever, we just all spawn, start doing gens, and snowball the game without realizing it until it's done. In the end it's not a good game, the killer is miserable, we survive with a safety pip, but there's not really anything to do about it.
---
Yea there is a reason there are no perks that have RNG to activate
---
You’re welcome! (I’m 99% sure that was me.) It was one of my softer moments
---
I got a 4K with Tombstone &amp; Tuft of Hair Myers with 2 gens left and got “The Entity Displeased” at the end. What sorcery is this?
---
LOL, I've heard some dumb ways to divert the obvious but this takes the cake.
---
I’d like to know how to get these!
---
I try because it's a chance. Like what If the killer for some reason doesn't see the newest hook or two? I'm not common but it's happened, and it's a chance to get out
---
Ah, fair enough then!  I always spectate my matches when I'm dead and I see killers constantly taunting people, hitting then when they're down, etc.  My least favorite is carrying them to the hatch then shutting it in their face. My feelings is they're roleplaying a bit too seriously as a sadist :P  
---
But in your situation, it was a fair strategy.
---
Bro I’ll stop and point at empty lockers and run when they check em. Love this kid of shit.
---
What is the song playing in the background? Source please.
---
David is in his 20s
---
You can only do it if the EGC hasn't started yet. You just walk up and hold space or m1.
---
A lot of killers are more likely to let you go if you just don't bother. I usually even give them a chance, if they wiggle I drop them straight away and shake my head loads. If they keep wiggling it's instant death.
---
They aren't releasing those skins when the chapter isn't even out yet.
---
Yeah I've had that happen. Had a fuckery of a game once and decided to let the last guy who actually seemed to be trying have the hatch and it took me 2 minutes to get him to understand that he could go search for the hatch.
---
you can't get -2 pips without dc'ing
---
If they add this I will never dc against legions
---
Servers have been down for a bit, so that *may* be the issue right now.
---
Yea, you can do it now, that is a major part of its usefulness as a team perk. Top survivors make the most of every perk they use. It would go like this, you get hooked, get rescued and block hits on the person who rescued you. You go down again and ds. That's two denied hooks. You can then potentially try to loop the killer while the others hide or do gens. Loop til you're downed and you can be rescued and block/lure go down and ds again, wasting a ton of time. All with one perk. Potential to encourage camping as well once they see you have ds.
---
They release new skins every week?
---
Balanced landing is the only one I can think of: if there are no falling points its dead
---
Both EasyAntiCheat and BHVR have said it's not bannable. BHVR said there was a very tiny chance it could happen but nobody has been banned for it so far. You'll be fine if you use them, they probably said that to cover their ass just in case.
---
did you just..
---
well, it happend quite a while ago, not like I got any warning of it....
---
What? Doing totems is a legit counter though. Saying "just not let all the hens get done" would be the equivalent of trying to say "just don't get hit" is a counter for Noed.
---
The game can only start as a 3 v 1 if someone DCs as soon as they load in now
---
main
---
That's a different situation imo. That makes sense, because there's communication. Don't fuck around and you get to survive
---
Hey this is pretty neat man. Clear out the pool wouldn't work seeing as how we have thrilling tremors and Surge coming (which kicks all nearby gens and forces a 12% regression.  ) so I would definitely change that one, but it's a clever idea! Also, maybe he, after avenging his wife, tried to kill himself using some of the pool items and THATS when the entity takes him, so he can have a more grotesque killer form.
---
Low terror radius killers are good for beginners.   Wrath (free), Spirit (shards) Shape(paid), Ghostface (paid). 
---
Why low terror radius killers?  Because when survivors hear your terror radius approaching they will run away, and newbie killers are usually bad at both searching, and chasing survivors.    
---
Wraith for example is good at searching, as you will likely see the survivor before you uncloak and can watch them run off.  His draw back is a really long and loud uncloak time (with out addons) and no instant down so unless survivors are newbies or potatoes you are going to be given a long run.  He has a low skillcap, and moderately skilled survivors will work him over and there is nothing he can do about it.  His big advantage is he is FREE.
---
The spirit has a low terror radius of 24m, which means survivors will only have about 4 seconds to hide/run away from you as you approach. Even less if you are using your power to reach the gen.  Her -5% movement speed compared to other killers isn't a big deal when you Vs potatoes or newbies, and vs skilled players you can 'eventually' learn how to use your power to outplay them.  Of these killers she is the worst at getting the drop on survivors.  But between her power and Spirit fury perk you can 'learn' to be the best out of all of them at actually chasing down survivors.  But its going to be painful while you learn.  
---
The shape once he gets to tier 2 has a super low terror radius of 16m (8 with rabbit addon), which leaves survivors with a tiny head start on you.  He is ALMOST as good as the wraith at sneaking up on survivors.  Except he doesn't have to uncloak, which eliminates the entire drawback of the wraith.  Monitor and Abuse (doctor perk) makes it even better.   If you cant down survivors right away, he turns into your average joe running pallets,  except you you have the choice to wander off to catch them off guard later or pop tier 3 and end it in one stab.
---
Ghostface is the wraith and shapes baby.  When his powers are on hes a super wraith.  A quick stalk and you can instant down.  No decloaking drawback, no running out of evil within.  But if survivors 'look' at you a bit too much your power goes poof and you are a normal killer with a normal terror radius until it recharges which can be a very serious problem for him.   
---
I'd actually suggest going with The Wraith for now..  As it is getting near to Halloween and there is almost always an Event and a sale which then would be a better time to pick up Paid DLC's if you are unsure about them.
---
During a chapter. This current chapters cosmetics are over. When the next chapter comes out, the cosmetics will start again.
---
may the force be with ghostface
---
Oh yea but that isnt rng of the perk itself that's just getting unlucky with the map. If it said 75% chance of not staggering when falling no one would run it
---
Not sure what you mean, the other survivor was opening the door, it's not uncommon for someone to teabag or point at a survivor opening a door
---
BL is a fucked perk. It has probably 1 of the strongest effects if not the strongest effect for a survivor perk. But so many matches that I've played where there is never an opportunity to trigger it so I end up with essentially just 3 perks. Then you go onto some maps like Haddonfield and it's just insanely broken creating infinites.
---
Knees weak arms spaghetti.
---
I like your input. I was thinking just a pause and yeah I was thinking of those two perks but I didn't want to make it too much.
---
HELL YEAAHH
---
It’s just the way people are
---
It happened because the servers went down, and registered the game as a dc. Had something similar happen to me last week as survivor.
---
*Michael Jackson noises*
---
The second you hear the phasing, you should’ve gotten off the gate anyways.
---
That's 5 perks lol.
---
Someone attempted that locker shit on me with Freddy and failed hardcore.
---
Rule number 1 as killer -don’t kill. I see the mistakes I have made.
---
What would you guys do if a modern Nurse was released? I bet your minds would explode. Seriously, God forbid any shit killers get a decent buff.
---
How do you check that? On xbox
---
Jan is best killer.
---
Hey I’m sorry if this has already been asked but when does the Stranger Things update come out?
---
Yeah, which is more of a problem with the game/rank system. Survivors shouldn't be punished for bad killers since they're a source of over half the pips you get. If the game ends in less than 9 minutes that's a gold unbroken.
---
Benevolence requires healing others and if you're not getting hit then good luck (and unhooks, but you're not even getting these)
---
Oh. And you know, the lack of chases for evader. Genrushing ruins the game for both parties because of that. I'm not saying to farm, but taking it back for a minute to drag the game on so you can at least secure an iridescent unbroken, maybe even a bit of benevolence too.
---
Meeeeeeeeh... I think that people should just get over it. I’ve been moried a lot in my playthrough (1.2 k hours) and I used to get hella mad sometimes but now I’m more chilled out about it. Sometimes yku just gotta accept things as they are...

Thank you
---
When all gens are completed, walk up to the switch and use your normal interact button. Flicking the switch is about as fast as a gen kick, you don't have to sit there and hold the button like survivors have to.
---
Note that if you've closed the Hatch, you *cannot* open the gates - a survivor would have to do it.
---
R/Wooosh
---
RemindMe! 2 Hours
---
It would render them pointless other than being a cool alternative to a final hook. They could also be detrimental to you winning as sometimes a hook is faster and you can get aura reading from BBQ. They are strong but both sides have very strong things they can bring into a match. 
---
I personally think a good change to Ebony and Ivory Moris would be to only make them useable after every Survivor has already been hooked once, just to prevent the proxy camp/tunnel/mori/remove someone from the game asap without them having a chance to try and play.

|-|-|-|-|
---
it completely sways the game though, as soon as someone gets mori'd after their first hook, they might as have dc'd. I'm sure everyone knows what a 3 man game is like.
---
Yeah, that map sucks
---
No events this year so far apparently since they wanna focus on making the game the best version it can be
---
Im gonna chase this mfker with another mfker
---
Thank you for the nostalgia
---
Bugged from the beginning of the match. I’ve had this happen a few times, and it’s really frustrating when it’s a good match. You’re actually still making progress on certain actions it just doesn’t know if I’m not mistaken. Same applies for when healing and getting healed.
---
On a Monday? Very unlikely. 
---
Then again, nothing stops BHVR from becoming unpredictable out of nowhere so we'll see. It would definitely break their pattern.
---
There are two kinds of people evidently.
---
This has been coming up for me as soon as the game is about to load for a little over a week now
---
What's the song from the "loading into lobbies" one?
---
I feel you its so difficult but i found i get it best when i actually feel like playing the killer and my mind set isnt on getting the acheivment but simply just trying to kill all the survivors
---
Technically there are such things as tactical DCs. The second to last survivor can DC after they get downed to open up the hatch for the last survivor. It's quicker than letting urself die on the hook and also prevents slug 4Ks. But at that point you already lost anyways so what's the real point unless you are trying to stop a toxic killer from getting a 4K.
---
Not at all since they do it at different times and thrilling is more of a counter pick to bbq. Also it's a hex perk and tbh it seems fairly balanced. Maybe lower the seconds by 5 for each level tho
---
Yes spine chill still works. You can also use it to tell what direction she's going if she uses it mid chase.
---
Impressive that the camera dind't broke,Jesus Nea and Quentin in the same screen, i think i heard a "crack" on my screen 😮
---
Let's not pretend like you're not running it for the BP eh
---
why does the revealing noise last forever
---
I was wondering this as well. I haven’t received any rewards lately.
---
No one would go for hooks Lmao
---
Damn that’s annoying. Thanks for explaining man!
---
Or maybe just maybe you can fix it now and stop bitching about something that 0.0000000000001% of the player base had an issue with.
---
They should give Burrowed Time a one time use only instead of infinite since it's pretty much the strongest survivor perk.
---
Yea. I’ve had this same sort of thing happen trying to let people leave through hatch or whatever. Stop struggling when there’s no hope left. I’m trying to spare you, but I do this on my terms, lol.
---
a 3% reduction isnt too much, that is about .4 seconds on a generator... If its removed when hooked or healed it should be like 10% to make it important to get rid of I would say
---
Clear the pool is what Surge should be, I like this perk
---
Wow 55 k bp on survivors how dude
---
It doesn't matter because it's in the game and doesn't prevent the game from ending because the survivor will bleedout if the killer just mori cancels the entire time. It's absolutely a BM thing to do, but so it tbaging, flashlight clicking, and spamming a pallet/locker. None of those prevent the game from advancing, and thus should not be bannable no matter how annoying it is.
---
I've had that happen to me b4 too. It happens if you pick them up right as the game is ending
---
This is me every game.
---
Nancy: Demi, NO
---
Demi: yis
---
Nancy: DEMI
---
Nancy: GET OUT OF HERE DEMI
---
Demi: :(
---
If you mage to go to tractor on rotten fields it can be pretty annoying if u play it right
---
Yes because t bagging as you infinite loop with balanced landing while in a chase is just fellow camaraderie.
---
Well, yeah, Identity V is better in general. It just has more Survivor abuse.
---
I haven't been getting the daily rewards for the past few days either. But on teachables. With Meg (at least this was how it was for me). Q&amp;Q at 20. Sprint Burst at 30 and Adrenaline at 40.
---
This are all really good, great job!
---
Thank you, I do.
---
Sometimes the Mori is faster than carrying someone to a hook, and you completely counter Decisive Strike, Flashlight or pallet saves, bodyblocks, sabos. So it would not strictly be detrimental to your game. And survivors have nothing that compares to the game-shifting power of an Ebony, by quite some margin. As it stands, burning an Ebony all but guarantees your win if you are a somewhat competent killer.
---
I agree with the proposal of making Moris only be usable once every survivors has been hooked. That way they could not be combined with the already strong tactic of tunelling, and would not be quite as devastating to groups of survivors who otherwise lose their first member very early on, crippling their chances of survival before the game has even really begun.
---
Especially sucks if you have a good game, with the anticipation of escaping... and you just keep on running.
---
Cool. I may start using Spine Chill more.
---
You killed em to fast lol
---
*Stares absentmindedly in Wraith*
---
Can the mods classify this beaten to death meme as oversaturated content already and remove these posts?
---
Mr. Ding Dong was my first killer. I can usually down* all the survivors with him. but that has a lot to do with how infrequently I play killer, which allows for me to group with rank 20s, vs the fact that for once in my life I'm pretty decent at this game.
---
I really enjoy toying with overly altruistic players even though I know it's wrong, but I do try to balance this by letting the match run on and letting players go every now and again.
---
* as in knockdown and not hooked.
---
Kates new outfit with brown hair 👌🏻
