I‚Äôd recommend balanced landing or lithe over sprint burst. SB can be a bit too restrictive since you have to walk everywhere to prevent activating the perk when you‚Äôre not in a chase
---
---
---
somehow my head? That does not make any sense.
---
Three?  Nah man, 4 perks.  Usually throw a lithe or balanced landing in there too.  Maybe an insta-heal for good measure.
---
Maybe, but thats still something they should not do. Dead by Daylight is not a free game like fortnite is and too many cosmetics are already only available trough purchase with auric cells
---
What makes you think I give 2 fucks about upvotes? REEEEEE DOWNVOTE ME AND REMOVE ALL MY PRECIOUS KARMA AHHHHHHH
---
Uhhhhh.. we can already unlock them over time. This bucket of hot garbage would probably be bonus bloodpoints/ free offerings with purchase of the pack.
---
How do you miss four whole gens
---
You obi have a bad taste in characters since ur name is "IggyUwu"
---
I went against two trappers today so can‚Äôt recall off hand. One was in the miner outfit and the other was a P2+ with frosty eyes.
---
fortnite bad

---
upboats to the left
---
Gens popping quickly can be a result of 1. They are focusing on doing gens before going to rescue.  2. The people on the hooks had some progress on a gen or two. 3. They have toolboxes or are working as a group. 
---
It‚Äôs their goal to finish gens just as it‚Äôs your goal to kill them.
---
Surveillance is the only better than average perk
---
Yeah, some people are for it or neutral but the people that are against it say they‚Äôll straight up stop playing if this happens (myself included) so I don‚Äôt think its really going to happen.
---
I admit that would be garbage. And your point. Makes the other option garbage. All in all a battle pass isn't a  good fit for this game. But I don't see it as unfair or pay to win
---
"I'd be ok with a battle pass if it wasn't a battle pass"
---
Sorry, I couldn't resist :) I know what you mean tho. Eh, idk about the battle pass to be honest. I mean I would get it if it was cheap more than likely lol but how battle passes currently are now doesn't make much sense applied to DBD directly. I
---
The confusion probably comes from being able to buy cosmetics with shards AND cells
---
So that's all you have? How about you just go crawl back under your rock man. I dont even know what's going on with that freddy rework as of right now. I just know it's something complicated and it will probably take a decent amount of time to smooth out. It's a complete rework so I imagine thats why it's taking so long which I'm cool with. I'm glad they aren't just rushing out bullshit on a platter. As for everything ask it's basically what we asked for. Before legions rework was announced you didnt really find a lot of people who didnt hate him. Even then if you play him you will always get dcs so something had to be done. The end game collapse is a great idea. Not only does it solve the issue of people hanging around but it will also stop those pesky locker glitchers that hijack my games for 45 minutes. The only thing we never asked for it the pig rework which is something they took upon themselves to do because it seems like it made sense but it doesnt so I dont expect the changes to be the final outcome. People complained about the new matchmaking and boom reversed. If you think the dev's aren't listening you are probably just clueless and have some kind of grudge or chip on your shoulder. Maybe you are just immature? Who knows.
---
This is like your only post on the subreddit that makes you look like a more tolerable person
---
I run discordance with surveillance. If they're all on separate generators chances are I'll find one out of the 4 gens being worked on, push someone off it, and surveillance it. Most of the time however, survivors like to work on gens together in the beginning because they spawn together, discordance helps me know what those starting gens that get popped in thirty seconds are, and again I'll surveillance it.
---
I guess that means liking nea is also bad taste
---
That would be poetic. BHVR pls
---
Yes that's it! How did you find him? The Alien v Predator w Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ridley is amazing too
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs stupid. While I wouldn‚Äôt quit over it, stuff like this really has no place in a game that isn‚Äôt free to play and I can understand people who don‚Äôt want to support it.  This is doubly true because the game has a lot of bugs and issues at the minute that should take priority over extra monetisation
---
 I really like this look! Amazing job. I wouldn't mind all my perks being that style. If you aren't feeling up to it, any chance you could upload the template? I can manage them on my own. :)
---
Thikque
---
It is the same button for a skillcheck on a gen', when using the map (PS4).
---
I can't believe how much you get downvoted when you bring up pay to win with bloodpoints. The game might not exactly be balanced, but giving the paying group more items just seems bullshit to me.
---
An overall bloodpoint increase is what we need
---
Why don‚Äôt you get Hook Sabotage points after the gates are powered?
---
Why didn't this make it to the front page
---
It also discourages chaining chases, since you lose out on it entirely if you need to chase somebody after a hook.
---
It's simply not always practical to beeline straight to a generator after every hook because you *will* find survivors, and it simply isn't worth losing the momentum.
---
Is Dead by Daylight free?
---
Shocking's good, usually you don't need to shock that much, because survivors tiering up in your terror radius will add to the deviousness counter, so I'd focus on using shocks to get hooks. I.E. stopping pallets and vaults for hits.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'd definitely recommend bringing a Raven Wreath if you can.
---
Once as killer I was told to vomit suicide and that they was all coming to rape me and nobody loved me :,) there is toxicity on both sides and I‚Äôve not played killer since that day. I feel afraid of the insults l.
---
Works fine for me. My tip is to make sure the killer is in range of the doors when you come out. Even if they‚Äôre walking or running by, you‚Äôll get the stun.
---
Without giving there name away, was this Deus (blank) by chance?
---
Wild.
---
Let's break it down, then. You're worried about the game becoming pay to win, which is an understandable concern. But what, specifically, do you dislike about pay to win games? Is it because of an element of "fair play", where people who spent more time and effort deserve to win more? 
---
My big problem with pay to win games is that I'm forced to waste either time or money simply reaching the baseline where I'm allowed to have fun. The devs intentionally gut their games to force whales to pay, and they try to squeeze out extra money from me when I have other things to spend my money on.
---
When it comes to Dead By Daylight, we're not talking about a structural change. Bloodpoints aren't going to get more grindy in order to accomodate the new "battlepass", and they don't need to, since there's already a shitload of random abilities you need to unlock. There are already people with thousands of hours and infinite moris, the only question is whether I have to invest thousands of hours or hundreds of dollars to match up to them. The game has gotten so much worse, grind-wise, since the start, since they've been adding new characters and perks but no easy bloodpoint gains. 
---
So, if I'm playing the game anyway, with the understanding I will never be able to grind enough to unlock everything for every character because of how much grinding there is, what do I care that there's now a paid option to unlock things faster? Either I don't use it, in which case there's slightly more people with moris and otherwise my life is unchanged, or I do, in which case the game is strictly better than when I couldn't. Either way, I don't have a problem with it.
---
Well, no. I do have a problem with it. But I have a problem with the amount of grinding currently in the game, not this proposed (((solution))).
---
I want the tall man
---
mmm eat burger i must
---
Yep. Good thing I don‚Äôt care about karma at all. The downvotes just show me how many people disagree which is interesting
---
You also have survivors that claim you tunnel and camp when you don‚Äôt ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I'd be totally interested if its reasonably priced, and for cosmetics and whatnot only.
---
SAME

Incredible work
---
Is his phone a piece of watermelon?
---
I'm always stuck with "aw shit, who do I play" - this is such an amazing idea. Def gonna do it now, especially for killer. Thanks so much!
---
I don't care about the karma either, but I don't like it when I see the majority of people disagree with something I tought almost everyone would agree with
---
This 100%
---
I think Battlepasses are a great idea and a great way to monetize games. Fortnite's monetization system is fantastic for that, since it's a free to play game and the battlepass doesn't grant any advantage.
---
DbD is paid and has paid DLC already, and paid skins as well. It's pure greed if they add BPs.
---
It was like this before they reworked the map.. now theres is a lot less pallets in there
---
E X A C T L Y

I see your point but I still prefer it the way it is.

I would honestly let the survivor go if they default danced

good job on being the problem

Dwights: *screams internally*

Claudettes are either the awful stereotype or actual legends that will do anything to help their teammates escape, I've found.
---
You need to Shock them then hit them with an attack. After Shocking a Survivor you have like a 3-5 second window to hit them to get an ‚Äúattack bonus‚Äù and extra points in Deviousness.
---
it would be fine with me but only if they used the battlepass money for FIXING the game
---
It‚Äôs definitely the fair play thing you mentioned. I hate having to play hundreds of hours to get what someone else can pay 30$ for. I don‚Äôt have enough money to throw at this game to achieve that. The sense of achievement for doing something difficult is one of the main reasons I play this game.
---
so on PC spacebar?

Survivor: Object of Obsession and Streetwise
---
Killer: Surveillance and Iron Maiden
---
Yeah, no. If you play like an asshole im going to laugh at you. Im sympathetic to camping your only kill when gates are powered though. If you're just straight up bad and rely on noed for your pip then you need to learn how to play killer.

Black Ops 4 is super good tho
---
Last week they had a post about some streamers perk changes they supposedly paid someone commission to make. The difference was a 5 min color change in a program.
---
PLEASE never excuse the devs ever adding in a mechanic to reduce a grind that affects *gameplay*.
---
[removed]
---
Or they could use the money from all the DLCs and hundreds of cosmetics they have to fix the game we bought?
---
Aim low and achieve - That‚Äôs my motto lol
---
&gt;You can easily get 20k still and have all the survivors escape if you just didn't tunnel and hooked everyone twice or close.
---
I doubt killers that get 20k bp are the ones quitting, but I suppose there are killers that care about kills and not bp and get upset at 0 kills by the time gens are done. I couldn't care less about the kills I just want to bp and bbq stacks since those pay the bills and rank doesn't.
---
&gt;Force them out?? It's only an M1 away lol
---
I shouldn't have to waste my time coming over to spank the survivors out, that's what the EGC is going to be for. I only wait around as a survivor if there is someone unaccounted for or injure/hooked, if all survivors are accounted for then they should just leave.
---
that would be great too. either way works for me

I'm gonna have to report this for stealing an Instagram post

Is this an actual thing they're considering? Fuck that, they're already fucking up on promises, if they make you pay to get season rewards or straight up actual advantages to games, I'm done with it.

No offense or anything but are you really getting mad/upset because people are using their perks and addons?

I asked because we definitely aren't in disagreement that the current grinding system needs change, and that a battle-pass type subscription shouldn't be the solution.

That's my entire last sentiment in that comment.

They asked a lot of questions about me as a person and my hobbies, they already datamine us, why do we need to do the work for them.

if you have rancor on you you should leave instantly even if you hid in a locker the whole game

&gt;side character

---
All they asked was how would we feel about it, never said anything about adding it in the near future. As long as their main focus is fixing bugs and known issues I don‚Äôt have a problem with them adding a pass. I‚Äôd rather spend $10 on a pass than $10 on a outfit in the shop, now if it was loot boxes I‚Äôd have a problem with it.
---
Let me clarify, you think the grind is too hard for new players so they should be able to pay to make it less so they can catch up to the people who have dedicated hundreds of hours? I‚Äôm definitely one of those people that gets angry when a grind is lessened because of paying.
---
And above we see someone who bought all the DLC
---
I use always Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Mettle of Man and as my last perk DS or Borrowed Time.
---
You said it yourself lol. My tastes are bad. So liking nea must be bad :)
---
Probably doing us a disservice by saying "no i wouldnt recommend dbd to a friend as it is" while they are also asking if we are interested in a new game release...
---
BHVR you better not just abandon ship.

---
I honestly never break dull totems. I would rather NOED appear on a totem I know the location of versus the final dull we as a team never even saw. Unbroken dull totems give you a higher chance of being able to find if if you recall where they are.
---
Are all your one liners supposed to be doing something? I dont have time for your low effort arguement. If you dislike the dev's so much and apparently anyone who decides they want dlc or whatever maybe you should go find something better to do with your time? You are pretty much just a troll.
---
Imo it would depend entirely on what they get

If you need me to explain how to make head on work %100 of the time, let me know.

I know right, I absolutely adore her and will never stop playing as her.

Tbh the community hates every character and Claudette is worse than Meg
---
It wouldn't be pay to win??? I don't want a battle pass either but saying it would be pay to win is ignorant.
---
If it‚Äôs all cosmetics and they prioritise bugs before this then yeah I wouldn‚Äôt have a big problem with it. 
---
But again I agree, if lootboxes come into the mix then a lot of people are gonna have issues
---
The bar still goes red when prove thyself is active and there is de-buffs.
---
I count getting extra bloodpoints or double bloodpoint boosters as pay to win
---
Old flashlights were kinda bad to deal with, but they're really not a problem anymore. Idk why people would hate them, they're easily counterable
---
Do you not understand how pallets are setup? most of the time there is not a pallet close enough for this to work. Also perks like Enduring and spirit fury will legit make this change horrible (if not already bad) and killers like huntress, spirit, and nurse will also make this change horrible for survivors
---
no problem :)
---
Maybe exhaustion, but definetly not broken. Especially since half of the perk involves you healing
---
resolution that allows you to see around corners far easier and for killer it's basically built in lightborn. it looks different on the game but that's just how it records

Because fuck any idea that could give us cosmetics and stuff cheaper than what we have now, which is 10‚Ç¨ for every decent skin. As long as they dont mess up with Blood Points, really whats the problem with something like that?
---
The killer seeing you the next time you heal bit is moot because you can just 99% a heal and then only heal up to full when the killer gets close. That way, you're healed but not really healed, and there's literally no downside to MoM like there should be.
---
Seems like a useless nerf and still doesn't fix the problem created by this perk, which is not being able to end a chase.
---
By the time a survivor gets to MoM protection he is probably exhausted already and how being broken helps, exactly? My MoM usually triggers when I am injured anyway.
---
No sadly you are mistaken!! :/
---
Payed bloodpoint bounesrs isn‚Äôt pay 2 win because you don‚Äôt gain an unfair advantage over your opponents, even if the bloodpoints are earned quicker meaning new players get a perk a little bit earlier, it‚Äôs still not pay 2 win because that perk can still be obtained regardless of if you own the battlepass or not.
---
I don't think they meant it would be pay to win, just cosmetics and stuff
---
I dont even use it, so I dont want you to think I'm defending a crutch perk because it's my favorite perk or something right now. But I'm gonna say 99ing yourself is a valid strategy for the perk ONLY because the devs say camping and tunneling are valid strategies for killers
---
10 traps is way to many. 5 would be fine.
---
I guess to prevent you from staying in the game to farm points and therefore holding the game hostage.
---
I don't see why people are so opposed to it, the only downside I can imagine is that console survivors aren't going to be able to 360 pc killers.
---
I want P E B B L E
---
Was hoping for MoM :(
---
The problem stems when its *the only* method of progression.          For DBD, what you get out of a match is the Bloodpoints and Shards not mention whether or not your Challenges were completed.          A Battle-Pass would be made redundant with the shop unless they were strictly Seasonal.                All that said: yes, it should all be Cosmetic only.
---
They DCed the moment I downed. Not even hooking yet
---
domme huntress??

Bruh why tf is this flailed as lore, Anyway that Nea got what she deserved
---
i cry, errtime.
---
Yep, more options help everyone.
---
Yea it‚Äôs easy for people who‚Äôve had the game since release or whatever, but for newer players it‚Äôs a massive turn off. My partner recently started playing and I‚Äôve been playing since early 2017 and he‚Äôs hating the grind. It‚Äôs easy for me coz I know the game, I know the bloodweb and I know how to grind quickly, plus I‚Äôve already got almost everything! He‚Äôs got nothing and he‚Äôs had to learn the game, new dlcs keep coming and if you don‚Äôt buy them then you have to buy the perks in the shrine which is random, whereas I have all the other teachables on the characters I own so when a new one pops up I‚Äôve already got enough shards for it. I feel like people decide not to get the game or new players stop playing coz of the grind.
---
This is mostly to deal with a surv in an endgame chase getting hit MoMing, then having adrenaline proc &amp; reset the chase entirely.
---
The anticipation of it is what I mean. I seem to be the only survivor trying to unhook and prevent a tunnel in matches I play and when people dc I ask why cause I was gonna save them. The usual response them not wanting camped or tunneled.
---
sorry to say but, i only put ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù....
---
i‚Äôm sorry. i have failed.
---
How unfortunate. I had thought everyone who every played this game would have read my post
---
It‚Äôs just super immersed üòÇ
---
The game is already pay to win, in order to get the best perks in the game, you have to pay, I don't see how getting a battle pass cosmetic changes that.
---
no, that‚Äôs thicc. there‚Äôs a difference.
---
doing the default fortnite dance just before a rbt snaps your head is something that would please me very much.
---
My gripe is just buck-standard they've become and how bloody linear they are.         Unlike Fortnite where they're the main source of income (next to V-Buck Packs) DBD already has paid-Chapters &amp; the in-game storefront.
---
Download?
---
&gt;This is mostly to deal with a surv in an endgame chase getting hit MoMing, then having adrenaline proc &amp; reset the chase entirely.
---
Now I understand. Makes sense, then. I always think of MoM as a perk often used mid match.
---
I run prove thyself just about every game and the only time that's true is when you have 3 people on a gen. If it's red with 2 people there has to be some sort of debuff slowing you down.
---
You already know the answer. Your point?
---
Lol most of the collapsed/negative comments are me.
---
I honestly think that they should've stayed to determine if they we're gonna get camped/tunneled, but I understand what you mean.
---
He wouldn't work and frankly he would be a stupid addition similar to freddy in terms of lore.
---
Oh. My. God. :(
---
How do you know that the battlepass progression system won't have free options? Maybe everyone could progress but only the cosmetics are locked behind payment, but everyone could still get the bloodpoints, shards, or complete quests.

No, it‚Äôs not. She‚Äôs gut a big but yes, but it‚Äôs not thicc. Fat =/= Thicc

Hey now, as a Dwight main I resent not being able to hit skill checks. Ruin checks still fuck me, but if you can't repair the generator as Dwight, then you need to go back to Dwight school.
---
I would immediately think to incorporate a system similar to Warframe.
---
https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/TennoGen
---
The community creates skins through the provided TennoGen tool and then they upload them to the Steam Workshop. The community votes on ones they like and then the devs place some of the most popular ones in the shop with the creator seeing a small portion of the revenue earned.
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs a pretty genius system that lets the community do the developing of content for practically no cost to the actual devs.
---
Did you miss the point where I said strategy. If it is considered a strategy for killers to camp and tunnels and there is no punishment for it, it should be considered a strategy for a survivor to 99 themselves.
---
Is lobby dodging such an issue?
---
Would ping be considered seeing as I dodge like 20 300 ping lobbies in a row? What if I forget to turn the oven off and leave the lobby then?
---
Such a weird thing to be considering with the current state of the game
---
Why not asking what they would include instead of rejecting the idea completely beforehand?
---
3/4 ain't bad
---
Between paid DLC Chapters and the in-game Shop, my disapproval stems more from the sheer abundance of monetization strategies for DBD.    Added, this is pay-to-play game to begin with unlike Fortnite.    If it was strictly cosmetic, however?           Then I probably wouldn't mind all that much.
---
üí≤üí≤üí≤üí≤
---
Metal of Man is beyond situational. And it requires getting hit THREE times. It's fine as is.
---
Why are you farming. It‚Äôs stupid.
---
SquaDwight is never as bad as Squadette. Never.
---
And this is said as someone who doesn't even use the perk.
---
How tf do you take the survey??
---
because i used bps and wanted everyone to get their fair share.
---
Did you miss the point where I said a killer may or may not be camping/tunneling? So you're literally punishing all killers by 99%ing your heal even if they aren't tunneling/camping.
---
What about Bill?
---
Default Jakes? I haven't seen a Jake in ages.
---
RIP. I think they do that on purpose? Like they don't wanna waste time dealing with you if they can just insta-kill you later. But then why would they chase? Odd.
---
This right here killed my hype
---
There's a link on the dbd forums
---
Y'ALL BETTER UPVOTE THIS CAUSE ITS THE FUCKING TRUTH THEY ARE TRYING TO GET FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE THE GAME.
---
Yes I love it
---
I mean, to be fair, we're now seeing the Entity consume survivors in another way as of the Endgame Collapse. The hooks are just a gimmick in the Entity's game that serves to stimulate survivors' hope; it could always manifest an alternative device or devise another parallel mechanic for unusual killers that require it, such as pits for Chucky to drag survivors to and dump them in or something else closer to the ground. 
---
I'm not necessarily desperately wanting Chucky in the game, but I would still like to see him -- partially just because I love crossovers/mashups and always enjoy seeing more licensed characters join the fray, but also because I'm very interested in seeing more of the Entity's direct influence, its intervention in special cases, and the like.
---
That‚Äôs the hokage my nigga
---
In regard to your argument for more BP, consider the following; Doing gens gets me pretty good BP at low risk, and I don't need to hop off a gen if I'm not in a chase and/or don't need to go for a save. Sure, I could do dull totems, but unless you're a killer who's very likely to run NOED like pig or wraith then I don't exactly feel compelled to bother.
---
Hmmm... more nicknames:
---
Dwight's Existential Crisis
---
Self-Care &amp; Botany's Third Wheel
---
I See You and I Know You're Annoying (or "Pick me to die first!")
---
Big Piggy's Watching You
---
And not all survivors 99 themselves or even run the perk. So a camping and tunneling killer can be punishing a survivor who isnt running MoM, 99ing themselves, or BMing at all. So do you want to continue with your point?
---
No, thicc had a meaning before fat girls started saying they‚Äôre thicc not fat. Thicc as a bigger but but no fat
---
Ima need sauce
---
/s right ?
---
Screams in locker *and* getting out.
---
I'm probably a minority, but I personally enjoy battle pass type things because it gives more goals and reasons to keep playing. Especially considering they generally make it really high in value as far as cost vs amount of cosmetics you get. This game is already pretty grindy but getting cosmetics at set amount of levels would be dope.
---
Surveillance is pretty good. When you go to a gen that's been worked on and cant find the survivor so you kick it and leave. See it light up yellow and go back.
---
It felt odd to me. Maybe they had a mori daily ritual? Not sure
---
Hell, Warframe just added a free one and it's been one of the most hated additions to the game.
---
Feeling pressure to progress in a time-limited pass, paid or otherwise kills my motivation for a game when I can't just feel like I'm playing for fun or my own goals.
---
Then gen progress should be tied based on killer with Nurse and Billy being faster and Trapper like ones being far slower followed by turning Ruin into a different perk. 
---
The reason that Nurse and Billy are good is that they can easily pressure everywhere equally where as Trapper has to pick a few spots to bully.
---
&gt;I get its strong, hence why I agreed with part of the nerf. I own ash so ive touched it a few times and seen how strong it is, but I dont use it more than once or twice a week when I just feel like playing Ash. But becoming broken, exhausted, and having your aura revealed to the killer when you heal after having to meet a set if requirements is making the perk completely useless
---
After being downed, your aura is no longer visible and you can continue to play normally but the damage caused by the perk stays. Killers that had momentum lose it completely or its severely reduced. Killers that were close to "winning", can lose the game just because of one survivor with MoM. 
---
I unlocked MoM teachable and been using as my main loadout. I recommend using this perk 24/7 so you can get a better understanding of its effect and how broken it is.
---
I would also be worried about the nurse on pc vs the nurse on console
---
Thanks for explaining! I came here feeling pretty stupid and looking for a better explanation. Great ELI5 here!

okay, seriously. jane isn‚Äôt fat, she is thicc. due to her not having a fat stomach, her stomach is toned, meaning it‚Äôs not flabby, and only big thighs and ass, she is considered thicc not fat.
---
I'd be fine with a Battle Pass type of thing, IF it we're accessible to all players for free. If we'd have to pay real money for it, then no, not interested at all.
---
Honestly it sucks to see the series fucking fail. Miss bo1 bo2 and even bo3.  Cod just can‚Äôt succeed anymore
---
Yeah, you wanna continue with yours? Because my point was brought up to counter what you're doing.
---
Samination newest animation YouTube
---
And I countered your only even semi valid point with a point of my own
---
Is Object a good perk to use?
---
I never run obsession perks so wondering if this is worth getting for my other survivors? I already have Laurie but I doubt I'll actually level her up if I'm being honest.
---
to your edit, i have never gained less by farming so idk wtf you‚Äôre talking about. one game i farmed in i almost gained 32k bp‚Äôs i had 31k something so idk wtf you‚Äôre talking about.
---
^^^^^looks whos shittin' in the tall grass
---
Let me get this straight. You skip past my entire comment and then misunderstand the last paragraph, and then you down vote me. I'm sad I fell for this bait.
---
im pretty sure its talking about skins a shards, mabey even blood points
---
If BHVR adds a battle pass before adding rank reset rewards, I'm quitting the game.
---
&amp; also, if you hate farmers then why did you even comment when farming is literally in the title.
---
You can have the best perks and add-ons and still not win a game. Battle passes(from my personal experience in different games) generally only include cosmetics :/
---
Can‚Äôt succeed anymore? Are you delusional or just dumb? Black Ops 4 made a half a billion dollars in its first 3 days of sales. A ‚Äúfailing‚Äù call of duty game is more successful then most regular games launch.
---
We already pay for the chapters so I don‚Äôt see how a pass would even make sense
---
They're both a little gimmicky in my experience, Iron Maiden more so. It's decent for not wasting as much time searching lockers and can help with location awareness by itself, but it is very helpful in tandem with Barbecue &amp; Chili. 
---
Surveillance is a good generator defense perk but as a killer you'll eventually get a feel for when Survivors are in the area and which generators they're going to prioritize, so I don't run it very much anymore. It can be pretty helpful though if you're trying to get a 3-gen strat going because it really helps you keep an eye on them, but if we're going that route I prefer Overcharge.
---
SHIRTLESS HUNTRESS DO IT NOW!
---
yes that was it , tyvm =)
---
...Which I just countered. I'm not getting into a pissing contest with you.
---
There's a tagged people button on the bottom left. Its super obvious this is stolen. Why do people never think before they upvote?
---
it's "shaking my head" my head
---
it was a joke
---
2700 perks are DLC perks appearing on the shrine for the first time. While they cost more, they give more bloodpoints per shard cost.
---
your so thirsty for that meta
---
I actually had a survivor many months ago go down in a jungle gym a nd their head was underneath a totem. For some reason I just couldn't grab them no matter how I positioned myself (they were completely still, IDK what exactly happened. Maybe they DC'd but somehow the game didn't recognize it?) so I just let them bleed out. They never got revived too so maybe other survivors couldn't heal them up either.
---
Happy to see that im not the only one finding this a terrible idea. These pass things are always a bad thing. Look at Black Ops like someone in the comments mentioned.
---
I think you might have a point here. Though neither side is innocent. Survivors can be insanely rude to the killer and team up with the sole intention of tilting them. Let's also not forget postgame harassment. Again, neither side is innocent.
---
 A female dominant in a BDSM relationship.
---
But you're fine with people paying money to get new killers/survivors with perks that give you an advantage?
---
Getting matched with console survivors would kill me inside, the game quality would drop dramatically.
---
Pls do not ever introduce this
---
Yeah to be honest that would be more reasonable
---
Asking one person isn‚Äôt getting the games permission.
---
I‚Äôm close minded? Hahaha.
---
You‚Äôre a kid who has no idea, so ima go.
---
I'm all for a battle pass! If you can't afford 9 dollars you shouldn't be spending time playing games.
---
As a killer main that used to play nurse heavily. Yeah she is broken. It's a massive power trip
---
*onomatopoeia*
---
If it was just skins/cosmetics, I'd be all for it. Anything else is a hard no.
---
Oh it‚Äôs you again. First you say killers need to stop bitching, then you talk about how you will face call survivors with leatherface, and now this? If your gonna be a troll account at least put actual effort into not making it obvious it‚Äôs the same guy over and over again
---
i asked every single person in the game and they all said yes, so stop assuming before you have all the information. yes, you are VERY close minded. i‚Äôm not a kid, with the way you‚Äôre talking and spelling things and how you are taking this little disagreement, it seems like you are the eleven year old here bud. have a good one. ü§£
---
Pharmacy should be a joint
---
I was thinking about that but I thought that only applied to profiting from it. Assuming their is no cost to community content, wouldn't this allow for it? I could be wrong though.
---
Fuck these devs are getting greedy. 
---
Do you want to lose more players? Your game doesn't even function properly most of the time and you're looking to milk your players even more? This isn't a free to play game.
---
Cut your cosmetic prices. Why is it $6 for a haircut? $12 for an outfit? I keep looking in the store for stuff to buy at a reasonable price. I leave with nothing. I want to give you guys money. I bought all the DLC for my other fav games. Micro transactions are so scammy with your alternate currencies. It's not a mobile game. 
---
You also need to release some free stuff for your community. Give us a reason to keep playing. Events are ok - but grindy (to up your numbers) to earn outfits we don't care about, for characters we need to buy. 
---
in before all the "how do you expect them to make money" You young and don't remember the old days when this horse shit didn't exist in gaming.
---
Dead by daylight would be a dam site more successful if they did copy Fortnites model. Hell they gave the game away for free on for psn and that month the game was the most relevant it had ever been.
---
I love dead by daylight, just being realistic. A fortnite style battlepass would be a perfect fit to this game. Leveling up to get new outfits, loading screens, emotes, hell even a new killer/survivor! It'd be a great way to incentivise players and keep them hooked.
---
ahhh gotcha. 
---
so would the outfit be rubber or??? just like the weird black leather kinda stuff?
---
Link to the poll?
---
God no. I hate Slenderman. I remember the original SomethingAwful forums thread when he was invented as a social experiment to try to make an urban legend &amp; it was funny at the time, but it's also like, the least scary/most boring urban legend imaginable.
---
It's a joke how people went through James Gunn post history.
---
Were you the one who downvoted? I got my eyes on you.
---
On mobile atm but it's on their Twitter and in the dbd announcements on the discord server.
---
Rainbow six siege you get a huge advantage if you have the DLC ops
---
Because I only had the title space
---
Lol... Okay? I didn't downvote you, but now I definitely want to.
---
It's a game dont get upset when people want to win.
---
I'd love to see another game with killers but with more ways to kill a survivor..like brutally kill them. Not 2 hits and hook.. and also more mechanics than repairing a generator.
---
But my main thing is just a way to kill them all the time
---
I get your points for sure, but for the first rebuttal yeah that can happen but think of all the one-shot killers and perks. That's not how it happens every time. And even then, you have to be in an extremely ideal situation for letting the extra hit to extend a chase that much. And for the second point, why would that matter? I watch hours of DBD gameplay every week, and from the MULTIPLE matches I've seen people use MoM it's not that useful. And every streamer I watch (all usually between rank 8 and rank 1 survivors) agree that's it's quite situational. MoM doesn't need to be nerfed. And the point of me saying that I don't use it in the first place is because I find it not worth using because of what I've seen. Don't need to play with No Mither or other perks to know they're bad perks. Why not the same for perks that are only okay or "good"?
---
To me the surprising thing is that these killers in large part aren't actually OP if you look at what survivors can do in a very well coordinated and top gameplay setting.
---
Its just the rest are so piss poor that you're giving yourself a much harder time for no reason other than you like the character with the worst part is they never get significant enough buffs with exception to the hag.
---
Pretty much just those, learn how to use them properly and you'll do fine until you get better perks.
---
That isn‚Äôt how you play Dwight, I think you‚Äôre doing something wrong
---
Thanks but I see people like ochido with a purple self care how do you get it?
---
There's a big difference between camping when there are gens left to patrol and camping when the gates are open. It's stupid to camp when you could go get someone else going a gen, just like it's stupid to walk away from your hook when there's no gens left and you know all the survivors are just waiting to get their teammate out.
---
Plain and simple, the bone crunching sounds of a hook meeting flesh!
---
"Behavior please dont consider adding a battle pass if it's going to be pay to win" 
---
Boom.
---
Is there a double BP event coming up?
---
You can buy all of them without money... it‚Äôs a grind, sure but you can still do it. I feel you don‚Äôt have a grasp on what exactly pay2win actually is.
---
Actually if you don't close your game and walk down the  street it's still considered camping
---
I hate that the characters have stereotypes ...
---
It pains me that it's so common in For Honor too. It takes fucking forever to grind until 15000 steel in a game I bought for $60 and the new Hitokiri hero is coming out and I really wanna play em but my ass has to grind about a week straight and a little more maybe. And I don't even have the Black Prior yet too.
---
I'm a killer main but sometimes when I get flexed on by a butt-dancing survivor I just want to pass on that pain lol
---
Maybe they had the entities help from the beginning :o
---
Nobody:

---
The color of the perks indicate their rank (mostly). You will get the purple version after some time, leveling this specific character.
---
The more you advance in the bloodweb the higher level perks you get
---
You arent sharing you arent even giving credit. You're just a lazy asshole who wants free internet points for something they didnt make. Dont try to play off like sharing when you arenstealing.
---
It's sad that I play this game so much and love it for the most part. But I gave it a zero when asked how likely I am to reccomend it to a friend.
---
Imagine having to start with no fucking perks on all characters. The grind was horrible at release. Then it got """better""" but there is so many perks now, chances are you will have to go through at least 50 60 lvl50 bloodwebs just to get the perk loadout you want on a character.
---
If my save file corrupted somehow I would honestly just uninstall and never come back.
---
I know this is controversial but I would LOVE to be able to buy bloodpoints for $$$.
---
I know it's meant to be a grind and I could somewhat tolerate it while I was at uni still so I had more free time overall. I have a job now and definitely don't have time to grind.
---
I still can't play the Plague normally because I didn't get any good perks. I still play almost every day just way less games per day than before.
---
The grind is killing the game
---
He is dabbing
---
Try all perks, practice and you will find out by yourself. This way will be more fun. Good luck :)
---
You don‚Äôt need to buy it??? Are you being held at gunpoint. If you aren‚Äôt into it- don‚Äôt buy it. Simple. It‚Äôs as if people just want to bitch and complain about anything they can sink their claws into. Sure it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù one to make money, but it literally doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone by having it.
---
All perks you'll get from the bloodweb. Keep leveling up
---
What's ever happened? That battle passes tend to ruin games? Yes, it has happened and continues to happen. Pay to win is not fair and promotes an unhealthy approach to the game, hence the battlepass issue. However, they're asking us about it which means we can always say 'no' to it.
---
Too strong, PGTW is likely already in a good spot. There are other perks that need updating way before PGTW.
---
My night mode just turned on and I agree. Hey Mikie!
---
If it was only cosmetics, but I still wouldn‚Äôt be thrilled. They seem to be focusing on monetization features as opposed to fixing the crippling issues in the game
---
I demand a Billy cosmetic. I want to carry him on my toolboxes and healthkits.
---
Same thing tho
---
***\*spirit fingers\****
---
Especially if there is 2 or more streamers in the SWF.
---
Mmmm I see your point but unfortunately I cannot change the title now
---
A lot of the best perks come from free characters, plus you have the ability to buy them from the Shrine of Secrets.
---
And then people hate you for being a selfish hook dive bombing wank stain. Really helps with lowering the stress of playing and grinding /s
---
But whose fault is that? the fault of the killer or the survivors who straight up DC and screw over their team? Just food for thought.
---
he is a real one, idk why it made u laught
---
pc
---
grants bonus and rewards = increased blood point gains / shards. More blood points means more add-ons means advantage in game.
---
It works fine for the most part in free-to-play games (including Fortnite). Paid games not so much.
---
It takes about 25 hours per operator. I guess it‚Äôs more pay to progress which is also not something that is good
---
i already add him at friend list and im asking to him to go to a priv game right now and he is changing the topic.
---
Or play against it since you‚Äôre obviously a survivor main. No one cares that you don‚Äôt use it. It exist. As a matter of fact, since you don‚Äôt use it nor play against it, you‚Äôre opinion should just be apathetic. The perk makes the matches hot garbage for killers.

Hey, I‚Äôm doing an article for an online publication about gamers who can‚Äôt help but blow hard earned cash on useless cosmetic stuff in video games.  Can I ask you a few questions in an attempt to understand how developers identify and exploit this mindset?
---
Love the sneaking - hate the chases.
---
EA bad
---
Epic Games bad
---
Geraldo good
---
My biggest problem with the game is that it is designed to be stressful and leave at least 1 person in misery.
---
The reason why 1 live game modes work for something like CS:GO, Siege, and most other shooters is because there are multiple rounds. If you happen to get decked in the first minute of the match, it is not that infuriating because you have plenty of opportunities to help your teammates and get back into the action the next round and still have a good match.
---
With DBD, you have none of that. If you are solo queuing, you can't coordinate with your teammates before or after death. It takes forever to find matches sometimes, half the time the match ping is awful, people frequently DC at the start, then you get sandbagged in the first minute and it is just soul crushing. That can easily take up to 25 minutes for a 2 minute match where you come out with 600-2000 BP or more if you are lucky. This is really the problem with the game.
---
I don't know if multiple rounds would work, but maybe the game could have multiple phases in each match, providing players the opportunity to do really well initially and not just get molly whopped and feel like they wasted their time. But I am not too sure how they would to this. It is honestly really hard to see how the game could be changed at this point.
---
It‚Äôs his mobility more than anything. Both him and the nurse have unrivalled mobility options and that makes winning with them considerably easier than any killer. I wouldn‚Äôt call Billy OP, but he‚Äôs absolutely the second best killer right now
---
This was so damn satisfying to watch. Well played my dude.

**Earn 2 X Bloodpoints! On every platform."**
---
It's already pay to win lmao. You know how many times bbq and chilli has been on the store to earn in game? Like 3 times since bubba released. Fucking bbq, ruin, mettle of man, the new gen locking killer perk ect ect. What's funny is you buy a killer like Micheal because Micheal is cool and seems fun, then you find out through playing that not running pallet perks like enduring and spirit fury isnt optimal so now you need to buy the spirit DLC, but oh if you have bamboozle you can completely wreck windows so now you need clown dlc, and of course without ruin it's pointless so now you need hag dlc. Its bs. Games should stick to cosmetics.
---
Of course cleaning totems is on there. They couldn‚Äôt think of any other objectives for survivors and didn‚Äôt want to list ‚Äúdoing gens‚Äù multiple times.
---
And here we have exhibit A why very few (and diminishing) amount of players like playing killer. The typical mindset of a lot of the playerbase where you can't use something thats in the game.
---
Meanwhile MoM is fine, Adrenaline is fine, so is any number of second chance perks but NOED somehow isn't.
---
but we don't know its p2w OP just jumped to conclusion that it was p2w.
---
I'd just like to see it have a gameplay benefit. The killer equivalent, BBQ and Chili gives bonus bloodpoints AND is a powerful tracking perk. WGLF just gives bloodpoints with no other benefit.
---
It doesn't need an amazing benefit, just something beyond sacrificing a perk slot to reduce the grind.
---
always go for the perk, any perk that you don't get will reappear, so if you want a specific perk, keep buying them
---
The best thing this game can do is to continue having exclusive events. You play this much during the event and you can unlock x rewards from it.
---
Well executed. Bravo
---
Nope.
---
I think community added skins would be cool, but at the same time, it might not be great for the game.  
---
I only speak from past experience of TF2, when community skins were added, it slowly turned into the community creating all the new content, and the dev team just soaking up money from other peoples' ideas.  
---
Now that i think about it, the community doing more might not be a bad thing...
---
BRB. Gotta puke.
---
I got so tilted the other day. Going as spirit for a daily (who I never play) and they knock 4 gens out like its nothing. I get 2 hooks and maybe 3 hits on top of that. I messaged the best one on the team like, bitch, did you even pip??? I was in the wrong but still... I'm rank 10 killer. This was swf with 6, 6, 8, and 12 like I didnt stand a chance. And to top it off you won't even let me get a couple more hooks??? I'll never forget that match
---
Rank 16 survivors are generally way worse than rank 16 killers. Not gonna knock you at all,  but once you get to higher ranks, survivors generally will give you much more trouble. As a 50/50 player, I find survivor much easier to succeed unless I get a potato team.

I won. Got all of her totems (for NOED) and did a gen next to her. She couldn‚Äôt do anything about it cause if she got close I would just get off the gen. She thought she still had NOED when I completed the gen so she tried to down me but it didn‚Äôt work Lmao. Hence I got hatch
---
I am more than just my job! :P
---
If you look at her from any angle besides directly forward, you can see her 'thiccness' is all thigh and no ass
---
Where‚Äôs the pay to win part?
---
^this, I may not play survivor much, but this is a big thing I learned playing with survivor main friends
---
It just takes practice, I've been playing killer for a year now and it's become super easy to get 40k bloodpoint games (plus barbecue of course) without camping or tunnelling. You seem to be missing the part where you realize that those survivors are other people trying to enjoy the game rather than computer programs for your amusement, why not play in a way that's fun for them too? I find the game to be a lot more fun when I get a lot of chases and dominate in the end and super boring when I just camp a hook.
---
I agree 100%
---
I'll probably play her for her jumpscare value. That's why I played the pig alot, real nice seeing a baby survivor almost do a complete 360 from jumping that hard.
---
Crotus Pren Asylum
---
Devs have also said that they would never make a non-human killer, but a lot of people counter this with "they also said they would never make a clown killer".
---
Honestly I don't think the Xenomorph would be a good fit for the game IMO.
---
This is an over reaction. Didn't know cosmetics are pay to win. They would never add rewards in a pass that would be P2W. A pass that rewards cosmetics/player icons/skins for items isn't PW2. Nor would i care if they added a pass. Cosmetics aren't P2W and theres no way they'd ever add items that affect gameplay in a pass, Imagine the outrage if they had BP rewards or addons etc. Im 100% sure they purley mean a pass with lobby emotes,player icons, item skins, player skins etc. A pass like that for ¬£8 wouldn't be bad. They could add a free version and a version thats paid for where you get extra cosmetics. Keeps you playing for a season to earn all rewards. I support this idea as long as its not P2W. But you know people love to shit on devs for coming up with ideas that will support themselves and also give the community something to play for. A free pass and a paid pass with pure cosmetic items would be fine.
---
You wanted them to let you get hooks? That's not how this works.
---
Yeah we get to juggle
---
7 gens
---
4 survivors 
---
2 exit gates after gens
---
Any hooked survivors plus remaining gens or exit gates
---
All while dealing with t-bagging and flash lighting 
---
Then survivors get low and high tension moments
---
Huh, hadn't thought of that. Makes a lot of sense, thanks.
---
Loot boxes would be ok if they were character based and not all round with the addition of a potential to open them for free or with $$, and no chance at duplicates.
---
Survivor: farms other survivor then uses them as a shield
---
Survivors: stop fucking tunneling
---
You really think enough people play this game for that? Matchmaking would completely break, as its already extremely slow
---
lol accurate
---
Oh please...
---
survivors ! are ! more ! toxic ! than ! killers !

Easiest part of the Survey.
---
*Instagram Post*
---
Welp, unnecessary downvotes on this one. It's from the latest Samination video, it's pretty funny.
---
Surveillance works pretty well until (some) survivors find out you have it, other than that after its rework awhile back  its become a pretty solid perk that gives you information about where the survivors are and aren't.
---
Iron Maiden isn't that great on its own, but people also use lockers to find from BBQ so it works very well in that regard. Additionally, it pairs with BBQ well, because once they find out you have it, they might not risk going into the locker and you'll see their aura. And if they go into the locker anyways, they'll scream upon exiting and give up their position anyways.
---
What about a killer version with wraith or myers watching and the trapper as the one opening the gate now that killers will be able to do it soon too.
---
I understand where OP is coming from though. Over half of the content in the game is already DLC, and adding a battle pass on top of this would only be walling off more content.
---
Honestly I'm against it too (even if it's not p2w) cause I feel like it's just too much at this point
---
I kept looking all over the image for what they were talking about, AND COMPLETELY forgot about the menu button! I felt so stupid until you explained this. TY ü§£
---
When survivors take too long to match into a game, the system just matches them with the lobvy with the best ping, regardless of ranks.
---
Welcome to r/deadbydaylight
---
Honestly I like your iteration of the perk a lot better. It definitely seems more useful than it is now. A kind of good perk for newer players but not as useful for people with experience.
---
The average rank of the survivors is 11, a difference in ranks of +-2 is normal and nothing to complain about.
---
Dear god, this formatting is worse than I thought.
---
I mean, if they are able to bring DBD to stable 60FPS then I would do crossplay.
---
But that probably won't happen until the next console comes out. In its current state, some skill checks skip the whole zone and most are choppy, and there's minor FPS drops on some exhaustion perks.
---
So until then, I would prefer that they keep it closed. Keep the population in its platform instead of some leaving to crossplay and shrinking the pool even further. Like some Xbox One X/PS4 Pro users might experience less of a hindrance, so they leave, making the OG X1 and PS4 play in a smaller population.
---
I went to one of those perk roulette places and I roll for what killer, then I reroll the killer wheel to use that one's teachables. So I could get Hag with Trapper perks or Nurse with Clown perks etc. It's a fun little challenge
---
Yes, but I'm saying that I'm pretty sure I've seen this exact picture posted in the sub Reddit every single day for the past several days by different people
---
You got a 3k what ya complaining about?
---
Oh no it's all good man I enjoy the conversation.
---
"How often do you visit art galleries and museums?" I really didn't understand some of the questions they asked.
---
I'm not complaining, I was actually wondering why the ranks are so different so often. Hence why I tagged the post "Question" and not "Salt".
---
Yeah, they made me realize how little stuff I like to do lol
---
Christ what the fuck is wrong with the devs
---
Yeah a lot of killers can be toxic, but it‚Äôs kind of deserved, it‚Äôs no excuse but survivors are much more toxic than killers, and also if you 4 die 2 mins in they probably pissed because they still got entity displeased (seriously fuck that), same with 4 escape.
---
This game is far too toxic, and depending on who you play with changes how each individual handles it.
---
I generally when playing survivor or killer try to not be toxic and I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve ever intentionally DC‚Äôd, but I‚Äôm willing to slug some motherfuckers if I come across a toxic SWF
---
da 100%
---
that one day this squad will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
---
Mostly because he doesn‚Äôt use his own clips most of the time
---
Uhh obviously bubbas basement!
---
Saw two Davids farming each other last night.
---
You could fucking repair the gens yourself and they would still complain
---
Do you eat skulls with or without the peel?
---
Also what you say doesn't determine rank. 
---
I'm glad they asked about voice communication satisfaction from the killer perspective. If you're not playing a top tier killer a coordinated SWF makes the game extremely less enjoyable. You are opting to play the game at a severe handicap with no incentives.
---
This is the best thing in this game, combine it with bloodwarden to ruin their day. My leatherface has NOED, Insidious, Blood Warden and BBQ just so I can do this and 4k some assholes
---
Hag isn't DLC
---
She‚Äôs DLC on PC but not console
---
Ochido was a piece of shit.
---
Its unfun but also loses them the game in a competent player environment. So really I dont have a problem with it and more of a problem with survivors who just refuse to acknowledge its counter. Because when I play survivor and the killer camps I will finish a gen or two easy. Maybe go for some great skill checks.
---
More importantly why tf run M&amp;A on doc at all?
---
How do you not become shit at being the killer? I struggle to kill more than one person a game. Closest I've gotten is 3 people with Hillbilly. Only like 7 hours of playtime.
---
ohh ok I didn't know that, thanks for the clarification!
---
No problem
---
Course it does. Tell BHVR that in the player survey and maybe they'll think of changing it eventually.
---
No one should have to put up with that harassment. The game is supposed to be enjoyable for everyone. The community really spoils the game in general.

I really don‚Äôt care because it‚Äôs dbd and I‚Äôll buy whatever they sell üëÅüëÑüëÅ
---
If they made lore for the movie killers, then I don't think this could be much of a problem.
---
Stop trying to nerf it. I love this damn perk..  I made a clown DC today because of it. It was glorious. He got a claudette down by the exit gate I had just finished opening so he picks her up I crouch down. And make my way to the hook.  I dance around him and he throws his bottles then he hits me. I save her hits me again, Mom procs. She gets away we get almost out the door and he dcs...  haha.. I mean he already had a 2k I didnt see the point of dcing..  but I laughed and I saved the random!! 
---
I mean we have killers with insta downs. We need an op Perk!! Seems fair
---
The /s means that the person writing the comment means it in a sarcastic way.
---
Don‚Äôt use it, run everywhere unless the killer is nearby or likely to be on his way - be efficient. Don‚Äôt wait for the killer to pass - start a generator. Look on YouTube and watch videos of ‚Äúthe depip squad‚Äù and you can see how to play efficiently, so you can climb ranks and have more challenging games.
---
Rank 19‚Äôs and 20‚Äôs with like 10‚Äôs and 9‚Äôs are usually SWF
---
Practice, don't respect pallets as much, practice some more. Helps to learn to hate blendettes and make it your mission to render them extinct.
---
here's an idea: do NOT so this
---
Yea I stopped using it today
---
I mean it made sense with them. half of them prob just got bribed. I do not think that would work with slender
---
It's ok to say this doesn't make me comfortable. I find the state of the game to not be appealing at my rank due to the value of killers. I would like a change so I can feel safe again.
---
We can‚Äôt support a game we enjoy? Nice logic
---
as a ps4 killer main i can confirm that mine is 50/50 but i also like to chat to nice people and farm salt from those people
---
This shit is as terrifying as can be when you're on lery's or the game.
---
Unpeeled like an orange
---
I think people mainly hate that what was previously attainable by everyone, now forced you to grind through Night wave. Definitely a mistake on DE's part, though it should be easy enough for them to make alerts useful again.
---
I like making masks out of the peel after
---
When I first started playing killer, I used Michael. Although, as I found out although I really enjoyed playing against him, I'm really pretty crap when playing as him. When the Pig came out, I tried using her and it was immediately different - I was getting a lot more 4ks and even when I didn't, I tended to pose much more of a threat than I typically did as Mike.
---
So my point is, for me at least there are just some killers whose playstyles I just don't seem to be very good with, while for whatever reason others just work more for me. So first off, I'd recommend trying out another killer - however, that can be painful when you're at a high level, since trying out killers you've never played is likely to go pretty badly initially if the survivors are skilled. 
---
But it's also worth saying... you'll likely never be able to get rid of that frustration altogether. Even when you're skilled and good with a killer, every now and again you'll just come up against survivors who are better - who loop you well, and pop three gens before you've hooked a single one. I'm similar to you, in the sense that I get stressed and can get really frustrated if I'm losing hard to a survivor group. And as the ranking system works, you'll almost always end up at some point facing people who are better than you, because you'll rank up until you get to people who actually provide a constant challenge. At that point, you can either decide to hit the brakes until the rank reset, or accept that you're gonna have more losses and try to learn from them. I enjoy survivor and never feel the stress that I do as a killer, so that's often the time I'll swap to primarily playing survivor.
---
So yeah, in summary, I think your options are - try some new killers and see if they feel more natural for you, possibly watch some strategy videos or something, or perhaps just take a break until the rank reset where you can try some new killers against weaker survivor groups.
---
It's not always the case. I was solo survivor today rank 6 against a rank 13 killer. All of us were solo and all between 10-6.
---
The issue is actually Sony's insistence that crossplay is bad. They refuse to let crossplay be a thing so it would be only between xbox, pc and switch. Pc would dominate (I'm on xbox myself, this is unbiased truth not pc master race stuff) and xbox would destroy switch players. I would love it if sony would allow console cross-play though, My buddy is looking into getting an xbox just so we can play games together
---
It is a little harder now that they've updated the spawn areas but they're all usually in the same area type depending on the map. Hardest ones to find for me are on the game meat packaging plant, yamaoka estate and the swamp. But I check the edges of the map first always.
---
It just happens.

Boo missing the point of the post. Booo

He may have been banned but that doesn‚Äôt change hat fact
---
I'm not a NOED hater by any means, but NOED on any killer with a built in 1 shot is just...annoying
---
i took it 100% seriously. i hope everyone else who took it did too.
---
ah yes. although not sure how that would work for slender
---
i wish jason could be in dbd
---
They'll probably just ass pull it
---
What is the difference?
---
Discordance is only good on killers who can either:
---
A: Move around quickly and/or snowball.
---
B: Leave a lasting status effect on survivors that hinders their ability.
---
That means that barring some niche builds, the only killers that can utilize this perk effectively are: Nurse, Billy, Myers in tier 3, Doctor, Plague, Freddy, and Spirit.  All other killers would most of the time hinder themselves when using this perk.
---
Yea, I pulled that shader all the way down.
---
This..like seriously wait until they bring actual substance to an idea before shitting on it.
---
A cosmetic only BP people would love, not me specifically but I understand people like things they like an can spend their money how they see fit
---
Iron maiden is dumb because once they know you have it, noone will go in a locker. kinda like spirit fury in after they know, they drop pallets early.
---
i mean they really aren't that hard to find. if i usually run into 4/5 when just being in a chase or moving to another part of the map to find another gen. i cleanse them along the way. if i don't find the 5th one i dedicate like a minute or two and i find it. then boom, all 5 totems cleansed. no chance of noed.
---
and? it‚Äôs not our fault you‚Äôre poorüòå
---
Micheal does what he does because Micheal Myers is...Micheal Myers.
---
I'm dead serious when I say I've had survivors try to waste my time for almost an hour. I went upstairs and emptied the dishwasher, got the laundry started, called my wife to ask what she wanted me to make for dinner, got that started, and played with my cat and glued some guardsmen. Turned the tv back on and three of four of them were still there. Vaulting windows and occasionally click clicking.

It's happend maybe three times, but holy shit some people have nothing better to do.

You know you on reddit when a anon say battle pass is good for a game that you have to pay. How much you are you being paid right now?

Well that's what my teammates seem to do every match

eh who cares about shirtless myers really?

i just want shirtless kate.

Lets be real. If you're running insidious, you're probably not at high ranks.
---
I've got nothing but respect for Devour Soap players.  Takes multiple hooks to make it work all without us stumbling onto their totem beforehand.  Confidence in ones game to make the totem work with lots of midgame hooks is the balls that NOED gamers lack.  Anyone can play like shit and get instadown for losing their objectives.  DH players go out and earn that shit.
---
Is there a way to subscribe to this sub without seeing the Shitposts? I really, really don't need the extra dose of "OMG KILLERS SUCK LOL" and "OMG THIS SURVIVOR IS LITERALLY CANCER WTF" constantly, but I would still like to see news and other actual content.
---
I am really getting tired of the community around this game and I hope that it won't ultimately drive me to stop playing entirely.

I agree I love using it just for the chance at a mori
---
Well if survivors understood to stick to gens at rank 15 maybe they would. But here I am at rank 10, going for a daily, and getting people who try and heal me when I have a med kit while running resilience
---
Creed? What the heck are you talking about? Not to sound rude, but you don't know what I'm referencing, do you?
---
Rank 1, excuse you. And using no addons and reaching tier 3 as Myers in less than 2 seconds from the first time you stalk someone isnt being angry, its pointing out the actual possibility that a easy to install hack for myers is going around. If that's the case, its something that needs to be looked into

No such thing mate, itvis possible to get t3 within 10 seconds with no add-ons.
---
It‚Äôs not hacks, blame your stupid teammates for t-bagging instead of breaking LoS.
---
Your article sucks if you're approaching it with that level of bias and asking loaded questions like that.
---
This is really good all around
---
You cannot reach evil within 3 in 2 seconds eith no add ons. I dont care how much my teammates are teabagging. Might want to actually look at my post before responding. Never once did I say 10 seconds, I know that is possible.
---
hey man, I have a pretty good spin in mind for this idea, is it cool if I do my own post on this concept while giving you credit? It'll show up tomorrow because I need some sleep.
---
What about Jeffs using the Black Metal skin?
---
Check my post history and you'll see in a killer main/flex, im rank 1 trapper, keep your narrow mindedness out of here this sub as enough already, you didnt find shit.
---
You have to be pretty good at the game in order to actually have object be useful, but otherwise it's useless.
---
Constant wallhacks is what Freddy gets even without addons?
---
You do realize it's incredibly easy to put a file to the ps4, right? If you think its hard, you should probably not touch an electronic. All a hack is is a file, so as long as you own a computer, and have basic computer knowledge, hacking on ps4 games is incredibly easy. The fact that I'm trying to bring awareness to a possible hack going around so that the game doesnt get overtaken by it and you're upset with me for that proves how much you dont care about the game itself, and are just a troll and most likely one of the players who consistently BMs when playing.
---
I would get Streetwise if it weren't for the fact i'm saving up for Kate dem\\nson and some cosmetics for her.
---
You have to pay like 10$ to work your ass off on daily challenges to occasionally get a cool cosmetic you could have just bought directly, and if they put exclusive game altering add ons or offerings that‚Äôll be even worse. Don‚Äôt even get me started on making fun of people cuz they didn‚Äôt want to spend 10$ to work their ass of to get a shitty cosmetic everybody will forget about in a month. Maybe I‚Äôm just biased against this because of Fortnite but that still doesn‚Äôt make it a good idea. If they do this I don‚Äôt want to have to stop playing this fun game but if they do add this I might just do so.
---
Yep, journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
---
"...generators being too easy and killers having almost no room for any errors at all..."
---
Agree to disagree, killers have plenty of room for mistakes, I main both, I know the struggles of both sides, and trust me, both sides are equally stressful, survivors have the same amount of room for error as killers, killers are meant to play off survivor mistakes as a matter of fact, so if you find it hard to be killer and see survivors not messing up, it's because you have to put lots of work into killer, learning to mindgame and stuff, forcing a mistake upon the survivors, because that's killer, and errors don't mean much, and yes, sometimes you have to let a chase go, sometimes survivors have to let a gen go, it's doing what you find smart. And the survivor getting a get out of chase free card, just get them later, so whaf you don't hook hat one survivor, there are 3 others doing really important things.
---
Absolutely. Tonight in particular has been worse. But I went several matches in a row where I'd go to black loading screen only to immediately be disconnected from the lobby. 
---
They've been weird.
---
Then how would he get them on the hook? Yeet them on by their ankle?
---
I say it is pretty high but we will not know until may 28th
---
Probably how killers feel during the dark times and more recently
---
What‚Äôs it do?
---
You just found the actor for Kate in the DBD movie
---
 Closes off exit gate for 1 minute.
---
No, I just generally think a battlepass would be "copy and paste". I don't want DBD to spiral down a $$$ rabbit hole. And i thought our play more for reward system was  the Devotion Levels.
---
i want crossplay so baddddd
---
Trapper must suck at the game so he has to use noed
---
"Memento Mori" means "Remember, you will die".  Mori is latin for death
---
Who said it had anything to do with money? I could buy it, but we have a functioning reward system (Devotion) and I dont want dbd to spiral down a money rabbit hole.
---
I can't ever find a haircut for less than $15, so I guess $6 isn't too bad.
---
the whole thing about monetization is that it‚Äôs OPTIONAL

Shrine and Shards can get you both with enough play time.

---
It's number 5. They are all hilarious.
---
Survivors: omg noed is trash such a clutch perk no skill
---
Also survivors: *uses adrenaline, self care, exaustion perks (except DH)*
---
I mean, if a perk is good, then fokin use it
---
i get getting points off hook saves, but when i‚Äôm first hook and a surv runs behind the killer and takes me off right in front of him, then runs away instead of body blocking idgi ):&lt;
---
I wonder if they will/should add that back with the endgame collapse
---
A fishing hook could be super cool too
---
For almost all survivors, P1 you get bloody body, P2 you get bloody legs, then P3 you get bloody head. For Ash I think it might be different because Hand is one of those three, but I'm not sure (I don't own Ash). 
---
Then for killer, at P1 you get bloody weapon, P2 you get bloody body, and P3 you get bloody head.
---
If you're hacking, why would you?
---
Is that what they meant with the "if you see a new game is released on the store, would you buy it?" 
---
I legitimately read it as "if you see literally any new game on the psn store/xbox store/steam, would you buy it" and was so confused so I said 'neither agree nor disagree'
---
I understand not everyone will believe me, and if you dont, you dont. I'm just trying to raise awareness to a possible problem that could overtake dead by daylight if we dont do something to stop it
---
But offerings are a hexagon. There's no octagons in the game.
---
I agree. It's really boring and disheartening to consecutively play against multiple hillbillies with BBQ/Ruin/Enduring. Every match plays the same and it just isn't fun.
---
(Boomer Groan...)
---
(Boomer Rage!!)
---
You're right I'm an idiot and need sleep
---
I thought it was bp boosters tbh
---
It would be fairer to the killer at least, because they could still get the points for the kills. and they still dont get BP for DCing, as well as loose items, which isn't much, but enough for some people.
---
luck is neither strategy nor skill.
---
To be honest, I'd like seeing something done with the base damage that happens when a killer kicks a gen. There's a little damage done to the gen during the actual kick, and then it regresses normally. However, it's stupid that a survivor can just run up, insta-tap that shit down, and run off like nothing happened. Kicking a gen really doesn't mean anything when an immersed Claudette is just hanging around nearby, waiting for the killer to kick the gen and leave so they can instantly save it.
---
I'd watch that
---
I hate these people. Just was in a match where EVERYONE was doing this, and I refused to go to the exit gates. Dragged on 15 minutes longer than it should have. Got spammed with "ez baby killer." Reported them all after.
---
What the fuck did I just watch.
---
I'd watch it. Especially the hag hand video
---
No. Never. Stacks are all. All hail the stacks.
---
**ENTITY:  NOT UPSET, JUST DISAPPOINTED**
---
Confirm I picked that too.
---
was this stolen off... no, it can‚Äôt be... NORMIE instagram?
---
yeah, kinda how it goes against competent survivors.
---
I mean, you could get injured or killed by any of the weapons in game, it just depends on how the weapon is being applied and *where* it's being applied to.
---
Yeah I kinda see that
---
I wonder if people will even look at these anymore now that we can't bitch about BBQ
---
I fine if they wanna make Killers pay to use NOED.   
---
Like... every single time they use it.
---
There shouldn't be an in between
---
Well since most of the time it's on the back, and I'm kinda certain that a small butter fly knife can't kill you in one swing from a morbidly obese man in a clown suit
---
it‚Äôs stupid funny, I like it

Not sure how effective it is in red/purple ranks but you‚Äôd be surprised at the amount of people in the double digit ranks that will drop a pallet and then vault right into you if you just stand still and act like you phased.
---
I'm confused, are you suggesting you don't like DBD?
---
Ace cleansed the noed after the Kate dc‚Äôed and the Nea or whoever it was died. I was mid chase and got outplayed which is my fault but Ace was already injured from before and when he went to save he got downed and dc‚Äôed
---
Died from the noed I mean
---
Nea died from the noed I mean
---
If it was cosmetics only I would be OK with it but then again that would kinda defeat the purpose of the store. Maybe if they were really detailed outfits kinda like the Hallowed Blight stuff. I don't know maybe I should shut up lol
---
I took it as any new game, not just by Behaviour, but I felt that they were implying something.
---
It‚Äôs fun enough, but I don‚Äôt like the dev team. I don‚Äôt like they lie. I don‚Äôt like how they choose to handle controversial killers like Freddy and Legion (or that they lied about never repeating the Freddy fuck up then did JUST that). I don‚Äôt like how they ignore PTB feedback and bug reports.
---
So I‚Äôd rather not put up with another game by them.
---
Why not turn the devotion into the battle pass thingy but for cosmetics only. You can choose to speed it up with $ or grind it out. Now the real test comes with the grind I'm all for it as long as it's not absurd like some games *cough*Bo4*cough*. It's tricky cause these days it seems like devs wanna just milk us for our money :(.
---
I'd like to see emotes that fit with the character like the characters from Overwatch cause it can make a little difference to how emotes work in DBD. Just not any dances because its a horror setting.
---
I think this is from Dead By Daylight parody from YouTube. I just found the series the other day too.
---
ik that but look in the bottom left corner
---
I'm going to disagree with you on a couple of these, I feel that flip flop, deliverance, breakdown and distortion are a lot better than you're giving them credit for. But I totally agree on Rancor, it's pretty much a "fuck you for existing" perk to the obsession.
---
Is it good? I need something to binge
---
Oh God, that game was an absolute disaster. Bo3 was one of my favorite games ever and black ops 4 just ruined everything. Supply drops, super long and shitty battle pass, season pass and the game itself is full price 60$
---
If I saw that shit as killer I‚Äôd tunnel the person to death. I‚Äôve had a Claudette make it so no one could unhook me and the killer saw and downed her. She dced and sadly I had dced before she did. Also this was when I was around rank 11 and the killer was a rank 2 huntress so whether or not the Claud was being a bitch we were screwed.
---
[From the wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Skill_Check), the default chances of skill checks when repairing a generator is 8%.
---
Is this per charge? As in 80 charges to fix a generator x 8% per charge = 6.4 skill checks on average?
---
Where does it hint pay to win? The bonuses and rewards might not relate to any in - game advantages
---
Flip flop has very few practical uses, less than unbreakable (which is stronger) but I definitely wanted it as a perk for a while. Deliverance feels more conditional than even unbreakable. The amount of times I get the first hook is way too low. Im usually downed first or if someone else is I'm doing a gen on the other end of a map. And if you get it most of the time someone is there to save you anyways. Breakdown and distortion are actually good I'll give you that. But what I mean is survivors get fun/silly/gap filling perks where killers got powerful game changers. Especially rancor lol.
---
Well I'd hope that they get at least it to be a minimum of 30 fps at all time on console by the time servers come out. They would have to rewrite the code to be event based instead of tick based and have servers before 60fps would probably be possible. But it will definitely be possible with cpu and gpu optimizations and having servers calculate things. And to be fair, I'm sure more pc players play with less than 60 fps than over 60 fps, because while its no where near as bad as console it still isn't optimized very well for pc too.
---
I think self care is fine at any rank it does fill a need.
---
Doctor looking at chainsaw: So yeah DBD is completely wrong about this. It wound instantly kill not down.
---
Really good. Sadly there won't more seasons after 3.
---
Run the add-on that makes the bell silent, and the one that lets you see survivor auras while cloaked. Then utilize line of sight blocks and sneak up on them. Uncloak behind walls and dash in. Works wonders and they cant do much to combat it.
---
Aww cool what your twitch channel I‚Äôd like to come by and drop you a follow
---
really appreciate her ASSets

The bottom left icon is from Instagram:

Stolen from Instagram, you can see in bottom left

But en everything in the game is already bought with money so what would be the big difference

OH NO

If you dont have a health kit bring it. You never know if you will need it.
---
I still haven't spend a penny on a game since I got it on PS plus, because devs show nothing but incompetence. You want me to spend 10 euros for one better skin??? Are you mad, that's how much your whole game cost, when it's on sale. And survivor waiting times are fucked on PS4, because where isn't enough killers, and I get why. As killer I get match in 2 seconds. It is almost unplayable, it's so choppy, resolution is so low you will never see blendette, and you miss half your swings, and if you get bloodlust, oh boi, game just freezes. How can be so bad at optimizing the game? They promised optimizations when game was on ps plus, we still got shit, just more promises. They lowered the resolution, what's it, optimization pass or that ever it was called done.
---
You are not gonna play against rank 16 survivors as a rank 16 killer. There just isn't enough players. When I started recently you only face rank 15 - 5 survivors even when you are still rank 20 with no perks.
---
There's also a lot of killers that do this.
---
I have met numerous killers that leave when they get looped longer than they would like or as soon as their ruin gets cleansed.
---
A big part of the problem is, the game is usually far too short and/or you risk not seeing your obsession often enough to get full stacks before the last gen is finished. This leads to tunneling, to get as many stacks as possible in the fastest way possible. There needs to be a better way to gain stacks for the killer that doesn't basically require tunneling to get the full effect of before the last gen is powered.
---
That's the choice you're making. Either kick a gen or committing to a chase. Not all perks have to be without negatives, especially when it has a direct effect on the other team.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, she‚Äôs just upset.
---
last second swap against ur teammates
---
This hurt my heart...
---
I've had a nurse d/c before cause she kept missing her teleport hits.
---
An OFFICE SPACE MEME.heres my reply. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt break dull totems because I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äù
---
FILTHY but perfect that it only works on assholes who deserve it. There's only 2 left and they're both in the gate, there's literally no other reason to be there.
---
By the time you got your second hook that 4 stack has 1 gen left.
---
Deliverance is going to be my last perk. I did just buy ash so it will be either deliverance or mettle of man.
---
I've gotten comments on these on games that I get a freaking 4k on even lol. A week ago I got a 4k as wraith(no moris or camping or anything, nothing "toxic") and I had 2 people spamming ez for more than a minute.
---
Don‚Äôt let the door hit you on the way out.
---
That's definitely not new, and still needs to be fixed. Survivors shouldn't be able to cheese an escape like that.
---
It's just aren't enough killers, you can't fix that. As a killer I get matches in 2 seconds. And it's because game is unplayable for killers. I'm happy to get a hit from third swing, because it's so choppy.
---
The most disappointing experience ive ever had in this game was checking Leatherfaces cosmetic selection and not seeing his suit or Pretty Lady mask from the original movie. I'd be so happy if they added it.
---
In addition to what whatissandbag said, choosing to suicide on hook and die is a mechanic in the game that you have the choice to use or not. Pressing ESC and clicking the leave button isn't meant to be used as an insta-suicide button so someone else can get the hatch.
---
That might be on r/dbdgonewild
---
I've stopped playing Destiny 2 for a bit because of all the seasonal events. Like they'll add new Eververse armor sets and even the Vow/Arbalest but they won't bring the planetary sets up to Y2 standards.
---
That and me just not being a fan of gambit are keeping me on hold until the Season of Opulence probably.
---
Remember Me is the reason why Freddy has a reputation of being a tunneler. He can make really good use of the perk, but in a way, it can also hurt him as well.
---
Freddies can tunnel with or without Remember Me. RM has its own issues, as I detailed in my comment.
---
It's not. I played on PC with controller, was rank 1 survivor and rank 4 killer(don't play killer that much). The bigger issue is performance. People on PC playing in 4k 60fps vs console 480p 20fps would be quite a difference. You probably never hit competent PC 360, because even on console performance is so bad, you miss half your swings.
---
Yes, I want to make more wallpapers
---
I wish I knew why survivors did this. It usually just ends up screwing everyone over.  I can't count how many times all four survivors could have escaped if it wasn't for this kind of behavior....they're basically giving the killer free kills.
---
&gt;What if its just a cosmetics challenges pass? Do XYZ through set timespan get such and such cosmetics.
---
No Blood points/shards, just skins and BS people are already spending money on?
---
Like I said, that's  fine, that's not what I'm worried about and mentioned as much.
---
&gt;Let's wait until BHVR actually puts information to ideas before we all start assuming anything about something none of us know anything about.
---
When it comes to monetization schemes like  this, I no longer give any game company the benefit of the doubt. That ship has sailed.
---
...Frank. I like his feral frenzy sounds, the scream at the end and his panting while using the ability. @ \~ @
---
I thought it was a d20
---
Pretty!!
---
Would buy legion for this
---
Yea, it's why I quit rocket league. Game become to predatory on trying to get every penny I have.
---
Make one yourself! They‚Äôre really fun! It‚Äôs just popsicle sticks, twine, paint and a hot glue gun.
---
My friend made one and inspired me so I‚Äôve made 2 so far. It‚Äôs super fun to make.
---
Who doesn't love watching the Match Lobby, after all it's what you see the most since the game keeps crashing during loading.
---
Out of all the things to call out the devs for, you call them out for a hypothetical p2w battlepass. I don't even know a game where a battlepass is p2w, it's just cosmetics.
---
Not that unpopular. I think all of this is common sense.
---
The victimhood in unreal. Killers can literally close the hatch and set a death time off for survivors.
---
I've had this happen too.... almost exact same scenario (I mean with the DC and everything) it feels too weird to be a mishap
---
I think it would be different to just add new Moris animations, cosmetics, and extra blood point bonuses. Would be something I‚Äôm down for üëç
---
It starts on the 2nd not the 1st.
---
I just see lots of baby killers complaining about "toxic" survivors, when the survivors are literally just playing the game, but doing it smarter than them.
---
I mean, what would the pass do? Unlocks all the killers/survs to be released that year, and gives weekly iridescent shard challenges?
---
thanks‚ô•
---
New killer: The Stagehand
---
It‚Äôs usually 19:00 UTC (2pm Eastern) but I haven‚Äôt seen that confirmed yet.
---
Yeah and today (right now) is the 1st of May in like 90% of the world, that‚Äòs why I‚Äòm asking
---
It‚Äôs already Wednesday for most of the world.
---
I forgot to set the map once and ended up in Thompson House. After the first down it was like easy mode. Claudettes hiding in the corn for the unhook like i couldn‚Äôt see them, and also not expecting me because it wasn‚Äôt lery‚Äôs or the game. After getting two on the hook at the same time they just kept switching places. Probably the fastest game as jump scare Myers i‚Äôve had.
---
Like Id last 2 minutes anyway.
---
Where was this survey?
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Seconded. He‚Äôs posted the same video of him being toxic as Bubba like, four times now, and then is surprised when there‚Äôs backlash each time. 
---
I completely agree with this video though. That Nea should‚Äôve just left.
---
That or it could stab you right where the brain stem and spinal cord meet.
---
Yes, 2nd-6th
---
It's a neat idea but if a powerful being swung anything at you, it's gonna injure you in some way. Especially if they're hitting your back. That's where your spine is and you kinda need that.
---
It is just so discouraging that every time you want to try something new the game says "yeah you can do that, but you have to play 100+ hours of the same old thing AND get lucky before you can do that".
---
Democracy is a form of government where EVERYBODY can vote on leaders to rule the country or make decisions, just in case you didn‚Äôt know
---
I left it in the middle. I spend a lot of my downtime at work hanging out in twitch chats, and most of them are lovely. It‚Äôs primarily the people who get super salty during and after the game that give the community a bad name.
---
Yeah, now I'm too afraid to play as killer.
---
Simple fix for this - if ANY DC occurs, the hatch doesn't open. No reward for DCing, behavior stops.
---
Its aliens. No doubt
---
New killer leak!
---
Exactly, every time something new gets added it gets even worse for beginners. I mean when you just start out you dont really care about perks, but soon you get a hang of the game and develop a playstyle. At that point you look at what perk combination you think will fit that playstyle but getting them is a huge time investment and gamble. And you cant even try if the perk will fit your build/playstyle, you have to grind till you get it on your "main" and when the perk does not fit you just wasted all that time.
---
Guarantee it was a SWF, if the ranks are this scattered its usually easy to tell
---
That‚Äôs what I was picturing too. Like a traditional season pass where you pre-order all the DLCs for the year at a slightly discounted price and get a couple bonus cosmetics or something.
---
SHIRTLESS PIG, SHIRTLESSPIG!!!
---
Getting lvl 50 is easy but pointless. It feels more punishing than rewarding, too. You wont gain much at that point and you sure as hell cant prestige because its the only survivor you have perks on. After a certain point, when you know a bit about the game, it is all about trying out stuff and changing it up. But the game wont let you do that easily, it always pulls you back to play your "main" with all the perks so you can farm up Bloodpoints fast.
---
I want prom cosmetics for everyone tbh
---
Dbd movie confirmed?
---
Prestige is a joke for anyone that cant play the game religiously.
---
I've been doing the quests with a friend and I ask him what one of the missions even means. I got really sad to find out it's only possible after a later mission. I feel robbed of 3k standing.
---
I also hear he likes to Michael Myers while he Michael Myers.
---
I have a simple rule: If I cleansed 2 dull totems and there is noed I leave. They fucked themselfes.
---
I did.
---
What would be his powers ? Hmmm
---
Trying out different/new stuff because you want to is fun. But i dont like being forced upon what i have to try next, i want to be able to decide myself what perk combination or survivor i play.
---
Like how people have an obvious advantage already when they buy all the killers/survivors so they have all the perks...
---
Its already a bit unfair but if the battlepass doesnt give add ons then I think it‚Äôs a good idea.
---
It would basically mean cheaper cosmetics if u okay a lot
---
Did you actually read their post? They were saying that the hypothetical battle pass would probably be cosmetic based, not p2w. Which is honestly how I interpreted the question as well.
---
Do you use ethernet cable or wifi? Could be that your connection was cutting out at some point in the game.
---
Will also add that after I got to the end game screen, I clicked 'leave game' and the game was just an endless spinning entity circle without loading anything else. So yeah, feels like DDOS because otherwise it'd tell me I have no connection, right?
---
i literally just had this happen, and in postgame chat she was all like ‚Äúyou should have let me go! i basically won!‚Äù uh, no, you chose to stay there and be a dick when you *could* have left
---
I only do it when I have borrowed time and the gates are open.
---
If u play a couple hours every day and do ur orders ur are more then capable of gaining enough steel to unlock all new heroes
---
Bowel movement?
---
True blindness: temporary blind the survivor with a bright light.
---
I don't advocate for doing this for the entirety of your game or being toxic with it, but slugging slows down the game a lot. I'm talking about slugging situationally. If I down a survivor and I know that somebody else is around (trying to get a pallet stun, flashlight save, body block, working a gen), I'll leave that person on the ground instead of hooking them. One person on the ground + one person getting chased + one person recovering the downed survivor = one person doing gens maybe.
---
damn, we just had 2 weeks of god tier perks on the shrine, and now we are back to this again
---
Adrenaline is an amazing teachable from Meg that is probably the best survivor perk in the game. It provides a free heal when all the gens are complete &amp; a massive speed boost to save you from chases or allow you to reach an exit gate fast. 
---
Self-care is a decent perk it's just that it takes around 32 seconds to pull of a heal. In that length of time, you can almost finish have a gen. That time you wasted not being on a gen can allow the killer to chase &amp; hook a survivor while no progress has been made which is why the perk is considered relatively weak. If you combine it with botany knowledge then its improved drastically but that's 2 perk slots for a weak heal which you could rely on team mates for.
---
Like I know your timezone.
---
‚ÄúDevotion‚Äù a reward system lul
---
Where can I find the survey the dev team put out?
---
Wow, I‚Äôd love seeing how people take it very seriously in my sarcastic joke. That‚Äôs literally funny.
---
Damn
---
I get that some people don‚Äôt have the time to unlock a whole battle pas in time.
---
But don‚Äôt u think people who play a lot deserve to be rewarded for it.

I mean like if you were to get hit by it, would it be like the injuries in the game / how getting g hit by it would actually be like

I don't care if it has been, nor am I going to consider such. I merely responded with what information was correct to me because I've seen a lot of people get the start date mixed up. Good night.
---
It's kinda nice to let the killer hit you for free bloodpoints at the exit I thought. Didn't realise people whined about it, guess I'll stop.

This is cursed
---
killer main, i completely agree with you. it‚Äôs perfectly fine to pallet stun and flashlight blind (though it is annoying as fuck lol) so long as you aren‚Äôt being toxic
---
Holy shit finally that dumb ass icon makes sense
---
They get rewarded by being able to buy most cosmetics using shards instead of auric cells
---
‚ÄúBilly is balanced‚Äù ask any non-killer main
---
maybe. ;D
---
U barely get any shards though and u already need them to buy perks from the shrine if u dont want to buy all survivors
---
It could have a reward for those who stay on the match after a DC happens
---
You‚Äôve reached your final form.
---
Well that's obviously a no for most of the weapons. All they do is bleed and limp around. Like I said though it is a neat idea. I could see some sort of mini series on the ole YouTube for it. They could explore a lot, like the actual impact getting hooked would have, etc.
---
Can be fine, fuck the ‚Äúbattle pass‚Äù idea, if only there was a real reward for leve-ling up
---
Anyone any idea how long it will last for?
---
 Nonyou are toxic sorry
---
You sound like the devs... minus the Moro and be bonus üòÇ
---
I'm sorry, ur right üòîü§ô
---
You get tetanus from hooks. HIV if your lucky
---
Nah, he has the powers of strobe lights and dubstep.
---
Maybe that could work then
---
Her jiggle physics though
---
I'd love a myers one. Or trapper. Or really any killer.
---
I mean if they're rusty, which they might not be. Look at the killers who clean their weapon after each hit. They're monsters but even they don't fuck around with cross contamination.
---
Pebble has been in the shrine a couple of times. A lot more than Nurses, BBQ and Ruin
---
BHVR we need omg
---
One more hit and I can start the sacrifice to m- OH my weapons dirty on sec
---
guess what other game has a battle pass that only gives cosemtics?
---
fortnite.
---
we should avoid this at all costs
---
Wow. I looked through them and you are a insidious camping son of a bitch. You met Bruce Campbell to and i hate you for it. RAGE RAAAAAGE.
---
Yup 100 percent
---
Theres one season on UK Netflix. Apparently the show was cancelled so I dont know if I want to continue or leave it as a season 1 ending.
---
I do this on Wraith when I can. Sneak up to the side, sit still, wait for Dwight to creep out and give him the NOED caress. I'm too nice though, so I usually let them crawl away, hoping they learned something.
---
Not necessarily. This is what happens if you lose enough signal for everyone to dc. I have had it happen and I push through the end screen and.i get dc bonuses but it happened because of my connection. I figured with ddos your internet would be tied up for a moment.
---
I love it, but I can't play Joey or Susie until they have unique voices, totally ruins them for me.
---
Currently maybe, with the proposed change though it gives it no downside. You can just kick a gen as you pass it.
---
His will states he wants to be buried in these shorts.
---
I've done this several times and I never felt bad. 
---
I mean it happens as killer too and I don't really care about it. You get your DC Compensation, can que for the next game and just start killing again.
---
And how do you want to fix it ? What if you solo survivor and 3 mates just DC? Sounds pretty annoying to me.
---
Hello, I'm from the future. I am contacting you from Wednesday.
---
God damnit dwight
---
Usually I'm just fucking panicking I'm so sorry.
---
Or. Run whispers so you know if they are near the hatch or not.
---
Bruh
---
Well yea
---
Damn Future Man, you're just a wee bit late.
---
Agreed, Devour Hope rewards you for completing one of you main objectives while NOED rewards you for failing one of your main objectives
---
I'd rather his laugh was map wide, lets me track what boxes have been done and makes for some great spook.
---
Bro, I hate camping Ash because I hate hearing his groans of pain as he dies. Terrible, terrible, terrible....
---
You say its unplayable for killers (and I'm not saying you're wrong) but as a survivor I feel exactly the same. 
---
The lag and connection issues make it almost impossible to enter into a chase with any killer except Stevie Wonder due either the killer lagging forward, me lagging back or the insane cross map hit boxes. It's not my connection as I have absolutely no issues on other games, connection speed and ping to most servers is fine but in dbd it's like I'm trying to play on a server at the other end of the world.
---
As a killer what makes the game unplayable for you?
---
I voted extremely interested for the crafting gameplay. Maybe if it‚Äôs like deconstructing items for bloodpoints or materials which you can build better items with. Maybe disassemble 4 brown toolboxes and you get enough scrap to rebuild a yellow one. I don‚Äôt know, I just hate prestige games and wasting all my items.
---
This would return me to playing daily, it wouldnt be perks or anything, just bloodpoints and cosmetics, right now with 1700 hours and every perk for everything I play, I don't really have much need to play every day anymore, somthing to work towards would be pretty good.
---
Multiple capitalization faults, missed punctuation points ( **I.e.** \*they're\*)
---
But then you try to be edgy and point out a typo. Lol, you Gen Z are so fucking pathetic that I don't even feel sorry for you anymore. Try to be more original, or keep making your dumbass memes that only you think are funny. Good day and remember to drink the orange juice with your Cheerios.
---
!remindme 45 days
---
I'll follow that rule. But I bump it to four totems. Cuz I'm an over achiever.
---
Because getting dodged for the character you use would be great.
---
Great I'm not the only one to see this
---
there were a lot of other great ideas in there luckily. definitely want cosmetics designed by the community

Baby killers expect the survivors to run in a straight line and throw down every pallet in sight lmao
---
The only reason survivors want emotes in the game
---
Personally I run into many delightful people in game. Just yesterday I had a mori daily for huntress, who I'm quite good at, and got a mori before a gen even was done. After the game which ended in a 4k, a nea asked me why I ran the perks I did in my build. In the end, we had a very constructive conversation on how to make builds that allow everyone to enjoy the game. Now i run only perks like iron maiden and shadowborn because they make my gameplay feel good without making it unfun for other people. That was a nice conversation. Then I was wrecked by a 4 stack 2 games in a row. So I pulled out a trusty iridescent head and absolutely wrecked house and remembered how good it is to feel OP. Morel of the story is dont listen to nea. Ever. She is wrong. Jk actually I do use that build most games because I would rather everyone have fun. Most people I find are nice like that. Or spam camper in chat after a game when I camp after a gate is open behind me. Those people I just pray for whoever deals with them daily. This got really off topic...
---
separated survivors on separate gens is worse than multiple on one gen guys, can't believe you still haven't figured it out. (not directed at OP)
---
link?
---
No Freddy don't!
---
Wait, maybe it's because I've already taken it that it brought me to that webpage
---
sorry for playing well
---
would be funny if it wasn't more like 3 pallets
---
That's because that is what some survivors do. I dont know whether to stop them for the sake of my opponents or to encourage them for my sake as a killer.
---
And then he gets the nickname 'the rave'
---
i would love it, if they reduced the grind for killers. survivors can max out one character and they're fine (which still takes ages). killer players need to grind every single killer..
---
yea but I'm talking about solo queue, pretty sure any killer can be countered with swf, even nurse but not very well. you just have to outplay them.
---
disarming traps saves your team and looping gives your team time to actually be productive, though they'll still just cleanse every dull totem whilst you get chased if it's solo. 
---
just didn't like that it was in a thread talking about toxic behaviour because, unless they sit at the trap tbagging, disarming them is just a good play

---
Is this an instagram repost?
---
Immersed players will wait. If you look for them you may never find them and during that time other gens get worked on. You check other gens and come back it's been worked on but no scratch Marks are near it and no one is in sight so you go to leave and....quickly turn around! to see nea running off with her tool box. That wastes a lot of time. It's just kind of hard to protect every gen they will usually get a few without any issue as long as they aren't potatoes.
---
In my eyes, OP means it is veru hard to win a match, which is the case against a good Nurse. Yes, a good Billy is fucking scary as well (especially because if the dumb chaimsaw hitboxes), I totally agree, but a well-organized survivor team (not necessarily swf) can beat a good Billy.
---
&gt; Hell, Warframe just added a free one and it's been one of the most hated additions to the game.
---
is it though? a few people burned out on it pretty fast, because they wanted to finish every single weekly when DE cleary said, that you dont have to, to get all the rewards. 
---
for me it seems like people liked the rewards. its a way of experiencing many different types of content you normally wouldn't
---
Maybe on a chainsaw killer. On myers I kinda get it. You have to stalk all the way to t3 before someone gets to a gate. It's a better safe than sorry situation. It's still overkill.
---
Friday the 13th didn't fail too bad though. There's still plenty enough people playing it to get a game easily.
---
It's nowhere near as dead as the hot trash garbage that is Last Year The Nightmare
---
Was it only in there if you said yes to "Do you have demise of the faithful"?
---
Looking fierce ready to stab some killers with a piece of wood
---
You don't have very good sentence structure but I'd pay for a cosmetic pass. Its optional. You dont have to buy it to have any advantages over other players so in that sense it doesnt even matter unless I want to play dress up.
---
Huh, I thought it was just me. Queued as a 4 stack, which is usually instant since we only need to find a single killer. However, each matchmaking took a few minutes. We just chalked it up to the algorithm not being able to find a suitable killer due to our varying ranks.
---
You ever feel like Hillbilly and the Trapper were meant to imitate Leatherface and Jason?
---
Hillbilly has a hammer and chainsaw, and a messed up looking face.
---
Trapper has a signature mask and a machete style weapon, as well as being all mangled and damaged.
---
It depends... like, if I see a dull and there's one gen left that should be just about due to pop, might as well leave it. If it's like 2 seconds into the game...
---
Ok
---
No pal, ok YOU.
---
That or give us the butcher. He was in silent hill origins and his weapon was smaller and he didnt have to drag it around.
---
Do you seriously thing all players who complain about NOED are like that?
---
Lmao BHVR - you tried.
---
NOBODY wants a subscription based system. It is the toxic cancer of game development.
---
As a Wraith/Myers main, I can say with 100% certainty that the only reason I am levelling up or even occasionally playing Billy/Huntress is so I can at least have a decent bit of fun as I rank up. 
---
I end up in some situations where my lack of map control or downing potential can get me caught in some situations where I just, do not have any options in regards to how to outplay the survivors, Billy and Huntress at the very least, make some mind-game options possible.
---
Dude...
---
Just go watch some porn.
---
I usually start before the terror radius is back. I finish and I will try to take aggro but I suddenly become invisible to the killer. The question is why is the killer kill rushing instead of going for a guy that hasn't been hooked even once.
---
Is it just me that sees a Hot Dog in Iron Maiden every time?
---
I only scimmed your post (am busy), so sorry if you mentioned this:
---
I doubt BHVR will actively make the grind *worse* in order to push a Battlepass. They could've added in paid Bloodpoint boosters a year ago. They could've made pay-2-win cosmetics and DLC perks.

They haven't done those things. Unfortunately, DBD needs microtransactions to survive. Game purchases and tri-monthly DLC purchases aren't enough to sustain the amount of support BHVR gives us, especially given the lack of a publisher.
---
So I trust BHVR not to screw the community over. After all, if they push us away, I don't think the studio could support itself.
---
That said, paid Iridescent Shard boosters wouldn't be that bad. Earn certain cosmetics faster and be able to more reliably afford Shrine of Secrets perks? That wouldn't harm anyone.
---
Points are points, right? (Though hypothetically, you could be in a situation where leaving and getting into a new match would give you more points, like getting slug-camped without having done much...)
---
First post, if you switch the reddit to "Hot".
---
No. They would need a handicapped accessible hook. The hook itself rests on the ground and after he jabs you with it he cranks it and hangs you up like a hoist.
---
I really don't care as long as there is no competitive advantage. You're getting flashlights and med kits anyways.
---
Let him be like a l4d2 jockey and ride on you and stab ya.
---
He's a licensed solo dlc wanted for one strong meta perk.
---
It's gonna be the next BBQ and take forever to go on shrine.
---
Bill won't be an issue as he is just a skin at the end of the day. Consoles have access to all three of his perks so pc players wouldn't have an advantage there. If it was a killer that was platform exclusive then that would cause issues
---
What?
---
First, no match takes 30 minutes... ever. Especially with the End Game Collapse coming next week, matches will rarely last more than 10-15.
---
Plus, a level 50 bloodweb costs about 50k BP to get through. That means 2-4 matches for an entire bloodweb.
---
Not great, but nowhere near as bad as you're making it out to be.
---
If I take of ds and deliverance then I will get camped and tunneled.
---
Perkless survivor is manageable. You can even get away with meme builds like no mither + self care
---
But playing mid tier killers at red ranks with no perks is literally impossible.
---
"Max"... Lies, he is and has always been William Thompson to me.
---
It has a place with cosmetic rewards. I dont have the money to spend 100 dollars on 10 outfits.
---
The vocal majority are.
---
How does people do this like how does everyone have talent but me.
---
I might cry. What are you going to do about it?
---
First of all I‚Äôm not surprised there‚Äôs backlash. I‚Äôm looking for backlash, don‚Äôt get it twisted honey pie. And second, I only posted the video once. Prove me wrong.
---
Does anyone have a link to this survey?
---
Just takes some time and dedication to learning, bud. You could do it
---
Thanks dad
---
Oho my friend, you overestimate the competence of matchmaking üòÇüòÇ
---
Well one of the people who is in charge of getting the licenses for the game said on twitter last year they we‚Äôre working on it and given how long Kate Denson had existed and Bruce Campbell saying he was recording lines for a video game a little after ash vs evil dead got canceled (around this time last year) I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs almost definite. Also the demand is high and the only reason it wouldn‚Äôt have been able to happen sooner is because of the whole rebranding of the company who owns it due to the whole Harvey Weinstein shit, same reason the tv show isn‚Äôt out yet and a bunch of other films from the company have been shelved
---
Oh no, now even walllpapers are bugged, the mori animation is stuck.

With that logic stop asking for shirtless Myers lol
---
And yea, just go watch porn mate
---
Nobody thinks any of these is toxic?
---
if its just cosmetically, probably, maybe more emotes than point and get over here, idunno i like emotes, kinda hoped when they added the point and get over here ones that it'd include voice clips so you could grab survivors or killers attention
---
Same deal for me today. I played 5 survivor games today and got mori‚Äôd in 3 of them.
---
only complaint is that the open the gate a little has 3 red lights and open the gate only has 1. shoulda been reversed
---
I mean Psyonix added the Rocket Pass to Rocket League, but when you purchase the premium pass they also provide the money for the next Rocket Pass after the current one has ended. This, on the other hand, is a great idea imo.
---
I see your point however if I really wanted to I could always let my obsession heal so I can get all them 6 stacks but with the new remember me there is no point in letting the obsession heal because youre capped at 4 stacks so this just encourages tunneling even more
---
Everyone is freaking out about a battlepass type feature in the game and how weird it was to even ask in the survey, but no one is talking about the question where they ask you if you "walk for pleasure" often.  
---
I play video games. I barely even walk.
---
I‚Äôd be ok for this idea if it applied to everyone in the match, other survivors AND the killer. If more than one person uses the ‚Äúbattlepass‚Äù,  it would stack and everyone would benefit.
---
And it should not be usable in kill your friends or survive with friends. 
---
Alternatively, it can be used in Survive with Friends, but is limited to only yourself, one of your friends, and the killer. If a 4-man SWF wants everyone benefiting, you need 2 survivors using the battle pass with no stacking on survivors but the stacking applies to the killer.
---
Another alternative. Battlepass users are visibly marked and suffer some ‚ÄúBattle Weary‚Äù status effect that makes the match more challenging for them. This effect should not be removable in the match or undone by any item, perk, or power.
---
The pass should be both a challenge and a gamble, not an easy pay-to-advance certificate.
---
Little feet go pat pat 0w0
---
Who wants to run a 4 man immersed Claudette squad to prove it wrong?
---
Humans can survive for a couple of days without food. I don't wanna play for so long non-stop. And neither does the killer.
---
Sounds like quitter talk.
---
Exactly!
---
The real problem is that most of the maps are unbalanced. There are maps with busted set ups and if you have good survivors who exploit these set ups and you arent playing Hag/Nurse/Huntress/Spirit (essentially a killer who can completely deny loops) then you are basically screwed.
---
Like Haddonfield basement house with balanced landing, basically the entirety of Lerys at the moment, Coldwind maps, Preschool, Swamp... 
---
Killers get screwed because of maps. I feel bad for Huntress mains especially because every map released so far has had random clutter in the way blocking all of your hatchets, and a middle building that is a pain to go around at 110 speed.
---
The maps suck.
---
1. Breaking dull totems is a huge waste of time especially at the start of a game
---
2. What the fuck is this meme template. Straight out of 2010
---
Thankfully I haven‚Äôt had to go up against this yet. According to the devs, you don‚Äôt need to report it, they‚Äôll be able to detect when it happens.
---
What? It never said his name was William.
---
It is
---
I have been on there too many times not to know
---
HOLD THE DOOR! HOLTHEDOOR! HOLDOOR!HODOR! HODOR! HODOR!
---
These devs are a joke. The console editions are just a cash grab.
---
&gt; Lose 50-70 hours of progress for a fucking default clothing item with a blood splatter texture on it
---
I guess unpopular opinion but, isn't that the point? To show how much you have actually played. It's like this across pretty much any game with a prestige system.
---
Terrible idea. You would then have to pick and play the survivor with the ‚Äúbest‚Äù innate perk. Actually an awful suggestion. 
---
What needs to happen is a major rebalancing on perks. 99% of perks are in desperate need of a rework/major buff on both sides. That would actually make the game fresh and new again, more so than releasing a new killer and survivor would do.
---
Are you on ps4 ? Ddos is definitely 100% a thing, I can hook you up with the right programs. It's like $20-$50 a month
---
Well, it said it was Thompson, and William=Billy...
---
You couldn't be  more wrong . I ddos people all the time
---
Use watermarks then :)))))))))
---
I had no idea there was one coming up! I'm super stoked now
---
I don't get it. You can get a new killer up to level 37 with max blood points, and then it's just a few games to get them the rest of the way to 50, after which they probably have enough perks to stand on their own?
---
It's at rank 4 too, and I generally don't even get lobbies of similar ranks.
---
It's a lack of killers.
---
Yeah what a fucking drama queen.
---
Let the skin addicts get their battle pass, doesn't affect me at all, but lets just get outraged about anything i guess
---
I‚Äôve had it twice on ps4 and it was always against a swf‚Äôs getting slapped. 
---
As soon as the first/second died my whole internet went.
---
You realize that their battlepass system they have in mind is probably one thats entirely cosmetic? It‚Äôd just be another dumb cash grab. Get people to spend $10 to slowly trickle them some recolors on Dwight‚Äôs pants, or a recolor of Trappers Mask.
---
No idea why they‚Äôd want to do one when they have people dropping $10 on a new cosmetic set everytime it releases.
---
Hello darling, could you please give me credits for the meme? And please share the link to Samination's video as the template's from there. (@dont_nerf_claudette on IG) It'd be much appreciated if you did :)
---
I can kind of understand it for solo survs. Getting potatoe mates all day and then having killers do annoying stuff like camping and tunneling every other match. Then getting into a match with a killer that might do nothing wrong, then you loop him for ages while your team can't even finish a single gen and then you get hooked with no hope for rescue from your team (or at best getting farmed while the killer just turned around to leave the hook). You can get salty and direct your anger in the wrong direction.
---
For SWF no idea though, i guess group mentality, amd just wanting to be cool to impress your online friends.
---
Thanks for the kind comments, I'll pass them onto the artist. Twitch name is NickRPGreen, stream DBD every Tuesday and Thursday from 8pm BST.
---
You don't get to decide that you moron
---
I took the survey very seriously.
---
PTB was only a stress test
---
Iron Maiden doesn't last long enough for you to actually exploit it, even though people commonly duck into lockers to evade BBQ. 
---
Surveillance is very strong, especially on killers like Spirit or coupled with Corrupt Intervention.
---
That‚Äôs would be neat
---
How is it broken?
---
&gt; I dont want to pay 10 dollars for a outfit. But I would pay a subscription based fee to get more outfits per month like 5 full cosmetics for 10 or 20.
---
Thats exactly what they have in mind, Im 99% sure. Thats how it works in all popular games that have a battle pass. Fortnite being the obvious one that popularized the concept. It‚Äôd probably be 950 auric cells and you‚Äôd get 950 auric cells back if you complete all 100 tiers. It‚Äôd be filled with cosmetics for all the characters. Not sure what they‚Äôd do for a ‚Äútier 100‚Äù reward. 
---
This doesnt seem like the game that would benefit from a battle pass system. They are popular in BRs because BRs are very repetitive by nature and the Battle pass makes you feel like you are making progress towards something. We already have the bloodweb/bloodpoints.
---
I've always wondered why the Loadout icon had such a weird shape. Good catch
---
Maybe don't use such an overdramatic title if you wanna avoid people calling you out for it.
---
Little drama queen. One question in a survwy and you go all "reee muh p2w battlepass"
---
I wouldnt call it ‚Äúfair‚Äù. Its definitely underpowered and not worth running in red ranks because it gets destroyed before it does anything. If it only spawned a hex totem AFTER you got 2 hooks then it would actually be a viable choice. NOED is obviously overtuned because their entire ‚Äúsecondary objective‚Äù (dull totems) is based around this one crutch perk. Talk about bad game design.
---
I'd be down with that. Honestly I'd prefer if all hexes worked like that (only becomes a hex totem when the perk actually does something), Ruin's the only viable one right now because it's the only one that does something in the 30 seconds before it gets broken.
---
What do all these custom icons have in common?
---
They all look significantly worse than the default ones.
---
Rancor apperead 2 times and costed 2700 both Times
---
the last 2 shrines were amazing so fair enough to have a shittier one this time. 
---
*at least we have 2 perks for each side instead of 3 survivor perks tho*
---
There's a bit of a difference...
---
i run no terror radius doc with haunted grounds
---
minute that totem pops **EVERYBODY SCREAM**
---
*heavy breathing*
---
when youve paid 60+ bucks and regurarily buy every dlc I dont think it's too much to ask that you should all the playable content. Cosmetics are one thing but a battlepass would also probs include quests for shards or BP etc.
---
No worries, I hope you've slept well! :D
---
yes slugging someone to avoid the hatch opening is an incredibly toxic thing to do 
---
i mean killers are faster and dont have to worry about being killed by a killer so they already have an advantage in finding the hatch first. 
---
the guy who DCed in this situation is a good person
---
in other SCP related games, SCP-049 has been depicted as slower than an ordinary human. As such it would never work in DBD.
---
PS4 has a built in recording feature and its super easy to record and upload a clip from your PS4 to youtube. 
---
It is impossible to ‚Äúhack‚Äù on console. They may be doing some exploit that lets them Tier 3 faster than normal, but its not a hack.
---
Y E E T outa the game
---
I think the folks at r/dbdgonewild know what to do.
---
Iron will against nurse in a jungle gym üëª
---
I know your pain. I work through every games double XP weekends.
---
Two things, no, it's not impossible in the slightest. All a hack is is a file or assortment of files within directories. Place the security file in your root directory and place the hack files in your games directory.
---
And I'm not uploading a 10 second video of Myers hacking to my channel. If you want to believe um lying to everyone when all I want to do is bring awareness to a possible problem spreading around dbd, then that's all up to you.
---
D-strike is hardly meta anymore and Adrenaline is a useless perk slot till 5 gens are done tbh.
---
but hey its what people do.
---
well, he's a skin, but that still doesn't mean he's allowed on non-steam platforms. I'd make it so he displays as a different character to players that are on other platforms.
---
it also can be used to make a small amount of progress on a generator without making the repair sound that the killer can hear.
---
Battle passes are for f2p games, i wonder why they‚Äôre even considering this
---
darn
---
Yeah not saying you did anything wrong, just that that survivor had it's fill of shit for the day already.
---
And to be honest this game has problems that make you rage even if everyone would behave like a saint, hitboxes all over the place, strange lag at the most inconvinient times (like during skill checks, could my needle not jump for once?)
---
I'd hate it if they were to introduce a leaderboard.
---
There would be a ton of super sweaty people that want an ego trip of getting to rank 1, ebony moris and broken add ons every game, no altruism and just doing gens &amp; getting out every game. The quality of the matches would plummet.
---
Tomorrow May 2nd until May 6th. Probably will start around 11:00EST
---
For honor has the same issues I broke a controller over lag.  Yeah I hope they do some good quality of life updates to the game.  They seem to have tried it already which is nice
---
ooooohohohoho
---
yes please
---
Hex: Aegon *snickers in r/freefolk*
---
30 seconds hmm? I wanna play versus the survivors you get
---
Totems in general are just flawed. It all comes down to map knowledge and memorizing totem placements. The powerful hex totems also light up like a christmas tree, which sorta makes sense but in actual gameplay against good survivors this makes them even easier to spot. If totems werent ‚Äútotems‚Äù and instead were something that blended in with the maps design, they would actually be a threat for good survivors too. But then that makes them too strong against new players.
---
Thats why totems are just flawed. If you try to make them stronger or harder to find, all it will do is mildly inconvenience good survivors for a week and then its back to where you started, but it will have a huge lasting impact on bad survivors.
---
Found the Bubba main
---
Aw, that Killer is a cutey.
---
Precisely, though it also needs to be taken into account that some players camp and tunnel just because it's easy/it's all they know how to do/they're jerks. Conversely, a secondary objective of some sort needs to be added to slow down gens because getting smashed in 3 minutes by a SFW is equally unfun. Until any of this is fixed, DCs will continue to run rampant and new players will be scared away quickly
---
&gt;Two things, no, it's not impossible in the slightest. All a hack is is a file or assortment of files within directories. Place the security file in your root directory and place the hack files in your games directory.
---
Dude what? Lmao
---
Flashlights are the weakest item in the game.
---
I think it may be a good idea if maybe you get skins that usually cost more or simply bloodpoints bc you don't have anything to do besides play so now if they add that you can grind towards something that you want it could be a good idea, depends how they might do it if they do
---
If theres 3 or less gens left the only way to get a 4k is to slug the third and search for the 4th survivor, unless you risk the other one escape through the hatch or have a hatch standoff which is too annoying.
---
Its annoying, you have the chance to get the 4k and the survivors decide to not give you the 4k that you worked to get. Its annoying.
---
Yeah, understandable. I think we need more people who run fun, interesting builds
---
Slugging isnt toxic, its a strategy, if you want a 4k and theres 3 or less gens left thats the only way to assure a 4k. The guy who DCed was a dirt bag, the game was already over they lost but they couldnt accept that they lost.
---
There is no pay to win, you can have the best add ons and perks in the world and still be garbage and the game and get destroyed. 
---
I see it happen all the time.

---
queenssolitude meantioned that situation will be gone shortly. The new "endgame collapse" will help prevent hatch standoffs lasting infinitely.
---
They'll be resolved eventually in favor of the killer if the survivor stands at it never jumping in. The survivor should continue as they always have had if the killer is at the hatch, attempting to repair generators and avoid being seen. If the killer closes the hatch, the exit gates will unlock instead regardless of number of generators completed.

I wish they'd put what the perks are next to the satisfaction one. The only new ones I know by name are the plague corrupt intervention, head on, flip flop and mom. I like the other Jane one but don't recall the name.
---
I voted very disinterested or not at all or whatever. Paying in advanced so they half ass shit? Nahhh
---
Remember when they did 1.5x BP for survivors and it felt right? Lol
---
If your new distortion, you will know if they have bbq-chili, after the first token hop in a locker anytime someone is fixing to be hook, save those for the end game, makes a world of difference if your on a gate and they hook someone, they will go after who they see. Plus you will know if they have murmur and nurses calling, then play around with spine chill after you get seasoned at the game.
---
Quentin‚Äôs favourite underwear
---
it's hypocrite to say that 'cause once you have every perks unlock you just use the same 10 viable perks.
---
"it's funny" until you try your try "smart" build and you understand it only work once out of 15 games.
---
It's a bug. If you were to get saved by either a flashlight blind or pallet save and hit the skill check at the same time if that save then it uses up DS but the next time you get picked up by the Killer DS activates. In this vid it was the f lb. Adhlight that saved you and you hit the skill check at the same time of the save so it saved your DS for later.
---
Why not? Fortnite have multiple exclusive skins but people who crossplay can still see those skins. You just wouldn't be able to use the Bill skin on non-steam platforms. It would, however, cause a slight imbalance because PC players have to level Bill up to lvl40 before they can unlock the teachables for Bill whereas non PC get them as basic survivor perks. A negligible benefit for consoles but still there
---
Killers getting them flashbangs now
---
Trapper finna get an ar-15 next
---
A: you can use points. B: you know what you're getting when you buy those. You know what happens with battle passes in not AAA games? Half assed everything since they already paid. Why work to make a product really good when good will do and there's no incentive since they already paid? Plus, the outfits could be for other DLC characters so possibly the rewards would be locked behind two paywalls. Adding extra BP/shards/perks is just a disaster
---
When he takes you into his basement
---
Just Girly things
---
Please don't add gimmick skins / emotes with a battle pass or bullshit blood points microtransactions to the game. Please don't.
---
I just wanna deliver my damn pizzas but noOoOoO the killers go all barbecue on my ass when they find out my Dwight accidentally brought them Hawaiian pizza
---
As a killer main who doesn't run NOED: yes, please, you absolutely SHOULD waste your time cleansing dull totems on a speculative basis instead of genrushing and getting out before I can get momentum going :)
---
Lol 8% you can throw that number out the window! On PS4 if the killer is running hex ruin I‚Äôve had skills checks out my ass like every 2-4 seconds and most games it‚Äôs allot more than 8% per gen, unless your playing against a Freddy or Myers, then that 8% might apply with those two. Not sure about pc
---
True
---
Wth was WGLF before because they changed it to what I thought it always was..
---
you just have to be patient. You get to lvl 50 and stock 1 million BP then prestige etc etc...
---
But coming up against a PC nurse on console is no different to playing against a PC nurse on PC. The survivors have no differences on console over PC so the fact the nurses are "better" when played on PC makes no difference to the survivors. Also, ranking makes it so the good killers regardless of platform go up against the good survivors regardless of platform
---
MOTHMAN COMETH
---
My buddy was, he reset his internet and then was ok
---
There's a fucking *what?!*
---
I would love to be able to create myself through skins, essentially.
---
maybe the killers see a very high ping for him.
---
Just gonna interject here, I'm from the U.K. and whenever I play with my friends - British or American - we have horrific wait times to find a killer. Horrific. If we don't have an American with us to host - it's likely we won't find a match any time soon.
---
It can indeed take up to forty minutes when we have been timing it. Don't even get me started on waiting 20 minutes for a game to just have the killer disconnect soon as we drop into the campfire and start our wait all over again. That shit is soul destroying. I'd go as far to say at least 60% of my time on this game is *waiting* to find a killer.
---
It matches quickly if you load in on your own (most of the time) but... I wanna play with friends. There's plenty of other games that I can play with my friends so I generally just don't bother with Campfire Simulator anymore.
---
It's 2019... Every other game in the world can matchmake you and get you into a game in 5 minutes but DbD is just plain ridiculous.
---
No chance would I pay for a battle pass in a campfire sim.
---
Note: I play on PS4. I dunno if it's this dire on PC.
---
I honestly wasn't expecting that, haha. I hope he saw the humor in it.
---
problem with devour hope is that it almost never work on "weak" killer" and like for everything let the two  really strong killers snowball even more.
---
i'd make an incremental change to the perk and see how it changes its use and success rate. Make it light a totem after 1 hook. Still doesn't do anything yet but the initial exploratory phase of the map is probably done by then.
---
I didn't get this question in my survey. Did they shorten it? (Just took it now)
---
I-
---
He is getting downvoted cause he uses the word baby killer and its known that toxic, trolling and after game chat shit talking survivors use that word
---
sis i-
---
can't deny that.
---
Please don't I had two claudettes who did this to me who didn't do anything for 20 minutes.
---
it's pronounced ***M E G A C Y*** sir.
---
a passive as in you get 5 slots or 3?
---
I approve of this. my only disappointment is the lack of suspenders teasingly covering her tits
---
Dunno, maybe.
---
I just wish each surv had a perk that only they could have, not one of the teachables but like an extra strong perk that you unlock at say lvl 50 and it will never be teachable or something.

Kinda bummed out that there was nothing about the progression system. Probably a lot of players will disagree with me but when I first bought this, I had no idea that you have go start with David King as a Survivor or buy Leatherface DLC if you want points as a killer, I just tried to learn the game and didn't earn much points while leveling other things.
---
The grind feels like shit, especially when you have almost no offerings too. It didnt felt so punishing to not have perks, items or offerings as a Survivor because you can rely on your team mates for some help but for a killer the experience was awful.
---
Anyway, I guess that's not an issue for the developers.
---
look lets not forget r/dbdgonewild is probably the only place legion is liked
---
Btw im low rank killer since this is my new account
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be a choice perk then it would be mandatory.
---
omg bruh ur right
---
It's kind of sad, I've played this game for a long time I've got about 2k hours in it and I enjoy this game so much I love it and all its flaws but lately I just almost have no desire to play it, what's the point of playing killer if nobody actually wants to play survivor.
---
Maybe OP thinks it says lure. Like as: leather daddy wants to lure pretty little Nea‚Äôs into his basement to show off his chainsaw collection.
---
How the fuck did I ned notice this before
---
Wow looks awesome, nice work!
---
I like how everyone agrees that we all suck
---
Same
---
Great system amirite
---
Have you checked your sound settings?
---
I only play as Claudette, Dwight and Ash.
---
My two main perks I use are Urban and Self Care, the rest I juggle round.
---
The ones I'll normally use are Prove Thyself, We're Gonna Live Forever, We'll Make It, Lithe, Dark Sense.
---
I'll sometimes bring Small Game if I've went up against a lot of killers who run Ruin or NOED.
---
\*shrugs* i don't pretend to know what deal the fortnite devs have made in regards to that.
---
just that bill the character is exclusive, and could potentially need some additional red tape to get the character across.
---
But that's how noob3 got to his 50 escapes that everybody defended.
---
Urban Evasion, Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Self Care.  Sometimes I'll switch out Adrenaline and BL for Ace in the Hole and Plunderer's Instinct if I'm feeling like looting.  
---
On killer (Nurse mainly) I use Nurse's Calling, BBQ and Chilli, Hex: Ruin and Bitter Murmur (which I'm considering swapping for something else).  
---
Mainly the "standard"/meta perks I guess.
---
Just curious, do you use a headset?
---
Good meme
---
It seems like it's just me but I've rarely actually got any DCs, on both the survivor and killer (rank 10 Nurse) side. Not sure if it's because of region (Australia) or something though
---
So you had at least two teammates still left alive, and you literally just sat in a fucking locker and watched this person who was one bodyblock away from wriggling off get hooked?
---
God how I wish we could block players from our lobbies.
---
:(
---
If course you'd pay for a cosmetic pass ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I am woke
---
I read his stupid post and he said adding a pass would be good.
---
[deleted]
---
It's an okay at best perk. It works well in the Survivalist build, but in most situations it's very underwhelming.  
---
If you really want it, just grind Nea. It's definitely not worth your Shards.
---
DH, Adren, Alert, Flex
---
Alert gives you so much information, even when you loop its good for jungle gyms.
---
If they had emotes like this and the survivors were doing this at the exit gates, my Myers would join them and start break dancing! This is hilarious!
---
Sprint Burst, Self-Care, Borrowed Time, WGLF
---
This one sparks joy
---
and I think legion imitate Ghostface
---
Teenagers with a white mask and a knife
---
He was so innocent. RIP Jeff.
---
Holy shit ive always wondered what those shapes meant
---
You‚Äôre the reason why survivors gen rush, teabag and use DS.
---
Yes your doing the Lords work and are a very valuable member of the team! I wish they would up the BP for breaking dull totems to 1500 and 3k for hex totems, more people would start knocking those out so NOED has no ground to be used much.
---
Nah hes right. You an average player playing average people wondering why you ain't being rewarded for being average. Looking at those scores. You didn't deserve to pip
---
Keep up the good work, out of all custom perks I've seen, I like your perks the most.
---
What? So what is thicc then? Muscle?
---
Are u kidding? if u get a 4k u should get a pip
---
I didn't get this question because i don't own the chapter :(
---
You can fail, the killer can call you on your bait and win the mindgame. 
---
It's the same with moonwalking, the survivor can eat the bait or predict you and not fall for it.
---
Thank you, nothing brightens my day more than seeing filthy t-baggers getting rekt.
---
They cost 2700 because they're new perks, having been added in one of the latest Chapters/DLC's.  
---
Since Rancor was 2700 in a recent shrine, after the Demise of the Faithful DLC was released, I reckon any perks added in the last 3 Chapters are considered new, and thus they cost extra.
---
Was hoping for Pop goes the weasel so that I don't need to put points into Clown.
---
I find him really boring to play so those points will be wasted ;w;
---
I think that's the Crapper, the Trapper's cousin we've heard so much about
---
If you don‚Äôt have video proof there‚Äôs no way anyone can believe you without seeing it. Just saying.
---
You post I more than one time and then take it down no one cares enough to try and find your links but everyone knows you‚Äôve posted it more than once
---
no
---
its a bug happening lately.
---
You really shouldnt.
---
spicy
---
Again, bronze chaser, ZERO Gatekeeper emblem. If one guy did all the gens, you should be happy you safety pipped. Point is, this isn't "to good". 17k points, no pip on a 4k at Rank 14 means you did everything poorly. This system was made specifically for players like you to stay at these ranks.
---
As I've said to everyone else that's brought it up, you ront need to believe me if you dont want to. I'm just trying to raise awareness to a possible situation. Besides, I wasn't aware that people havking on an online game was such a rare occurrence that nobody believes it without video evidence
---
You really shouldnt. Its tragic that you think you deserve to pip from that game.
---
As a main WGLF, I always use borrowed time, and also take a hit from the hook, is 2 stacks and my moral isn't broken (even tho the unhooked survivor run in straight lines in BW and get downed)
---
If you are good at chases you can waste a lot of the killer's time. It's really good vs Huntress.
---
Most of the time Object of Obsession will guarantee that the killer will ignore you tho.
---
Those fucking ranks tho
---
He's not human
---
In my opinion, turning perks into passives would not only require a bit of work, but it would also make a lot of people mad since they couldn't use certain perks on their favorite characters.
---
Ez gains.
---
How is that a reply to his comment???? 
---
Address the points hes making.
---
Part of me wanted to put it all the way to the left but in reality I‚Äôve had a bunch of nice experiences with people in this community that kinda balance it out
---
Why would I watch that dumbfuck? He's a shit stain, and the world is better off without his existence.
---
he‚Äôs kidding :D
---
It's okay I have enough scrap for full upgraded pipe and helmet.
---
I'm just saying that in my opinion i played a good game of dbd, got a 4k, and had chases while kicking gens, yet i wasnt even close to pipping. my point is that the ranking system is shit not that im such a good killer that deserves rank 1
---
Head on works properly, it just looks like it doesn't.  
---
Basically when you exit the locker, if the killer is in range, the killer will be stunned at the END of the exit animation, so if the killer is out of range, then you start it and they go into range, doesn't count, if they are in range, you start it then they go out of range, it counts  
---
Since the stun happens at the end of the animation, this also means killers can swing in time to hit and even grab sometimes
---
What in-game advantage? They didn't mention in-game p2w stuff.
---
trust a week to be insecure enough to post about this shit, put your tensile strength gaming wrist grips back on and shut the fuck up.
---
That's why I decided to make the stats just a 1% boost, not more. It's cool to have it but it's such a small bonus that you can still keep your playstyle with your fave character since these stats don't really affect much.
---
Ace 
---
Bond,dead ard,adrenaline and (hook perk) ie borrowed time or were gonna farm forever
---
I‚Äôm not a p3 claudette, p3 all perk bill main here, but I don‚Äôt face camp anyone really unless they were really toxic. Usually if it‚Äôs a p3 Claud with flashlight I will just bring franklins Demise.
---
I just don‚Äôt think it would be good for the game if it was more and if it didn‚Äôt affect much then it‚Äôs not worth putting into the game
---
Ye in your opinion you played good. What we and the score system are telling you is that you didn't. You played average. Plain and simple. Stop kicking and screaming and have some self awareness. You pip as a way to get into the higher ranks. You demonstrated a level of play that does not belong in the high rank. So you didn't pip.
---
and it's toxic in basically all of those
---
It's literally all about finding the right killer and equip him with 4 perks that aren't just bad. I started playing the game just a few days ago and I am already on killer rank 13 and can often get all 4 people dead before they even repaired 2 generators. 
---
But it's not that I am some sort of natural talent. I can literally just play that one specific killer competetive. I suck with other killers just as much as you do. Like I tried to play the cannibal much too and I never had a single round on which I didn't derank. Doesn't mean the killer is bad. When I played survivor I saw cannibals that ended the match for us in under 3 minutes. 
---
Some general tips here: Don't let them troll you. If they wait at a pallet stop the very second they want to drop it so you don't get stunned. Don't run after somebody if you aren't faster then them - instead try to cut their way.
---
Get every teachable perk you can because it will show up on every bloodweb until you unlock it you don't.
---
Yeah I really hope the red auras on Ormond get fixed. Can't use my BBQ &amp; Chili there.
---
JUST ADD A PROGRESSION SYSTEM FFS
---
NO MICROTRANSACTIONS, NO SCUMMY PRACTICES, JUST REWARD THE PLAYER FOR DOING SHIT
---
Battle passes in general are a terrible idea. They kill games by making their player base play the game even when the player wishes not to, which then evidently makes the player get tired of the game much more rapidly.
---
It doesn't matter how often it happens. Its the reason you don't get an unearned pip for doing so. 
---
And yes no impact on the game, perhaps the survivors were too altruistic, perhaps noed was the factor, maybe your a killer with insta downs. Point is you didn't play well they just made some bad decisions.
---
Dude just let it go, it's not worth discussing this
---
You monster :(
---
I'm just saying BH aren't trying to make us "they are actually working on someting",
---
They're just making a survey
---
Damn. Really wish I got BBQ and chili when it was around 2 weeks ago. Now I‚Äôm gonna have to sift through trash till something nice pops up
---
To be honest if this were to get introduced to the game it should be introduced for all survivors.
---
Reasons why:
---
1) A full squad of SWF will count anyway, so making it a point to hide this information is unnecessary.
---
2) Not everyone queues with a full squad, I mostly play as 2 or 3, so we still don‚Äôt know how many totems the random(s) did.
---
I do agree, however, that it would be a nice addition to the game. If it‚Äôs fair/balanced, especially since it somewhat counters NOED, is another thing entirely.
---
As a survivor player I am obviously biased in wanting it since it does make keeping track easier.
---
wait is this a real post? seems so fake
---
Yes it matters since it has never happend to me ever or anyone i know. i dont even care anymore my point is just that the ranking system sucks something that u probably didnt understand
---
yeah same, i met my best friend through a dbd game where someone dc'd and i was playing huntress. so i look at the good more than the bad too
---
It feels like you are misinterpreting on purpose just so you can argue because I don't think you are not that dumb to not understand what I meant.
---
Better idea, just use both lol
---
Ye no. Everyone else is wrong. Not you.
---
&gt; ‚ÄúPick me to die first!‚Äù
---
To be fair at higher ranks I know the OoO guy WANTS to be chased so for the most part I‚Äôll leave him alone. If anything they can often lead me to other teammates
---
Unless they‚Äôre SWF, which is the one circumstance I‚Äôll often tunnel someone off the hook
---
Except for me, I totally don't suck, right guys? ^^^right?
---
Honestly kinda tired of people saying The Nurse is ‚ÄúOP‚Äù. Is she strong af? Yes. But is she easy? Hell no. She‚Äôs by far the hardest killer in the game, and people who actually are good at her are legitimately good at the game and deserve a full team wipe. Is she annoying? Yes. Is she strong? Yes. But I feel like considering her difficulty, she‚Äôs not OP, just yet another strong killer like all other killers.
---
I left the locker multiple times with the killer right there infront of me while he just looked at me and either grabed me or slashed me in the face.
---
 I know what u mean with that he always has to be in range but the perk just doesnt work sometimes and its annoying.
---
Id tell you if I knew it, my brother found it
---
It just seemed like you were hating on them for just making a survey which lets the community communicate how they feel about many different aspects of the game
---
When you spend 9000 iridescent shards to buy the legion for the sole purpose of trying out iron maiden, and it's in the shrine 3 days later
---
But thats opinions since you didnt see my game right? therefore you didnt know how i played or what i did. you only judged based on the emblems which is what my point is - that they fucking suck
---
I understand what your trying to say but its incorrect. While the point of the game is to kill survivors its actually more then that. Hitting and killing only make up 50% of the scoring categories. Thats the reason you didn't pip, you didn't capitalize on all the categories. Just the ‚Äúprimary‚Äù ones.
---
Nah, trust me, it‚Äôs consistent, just doesn‚Äôt look it, I‚Äôd need a video of what ur talking about to understand
---
\-16 comment karam wonder why?
---
Plus seeing as he has the books, a movie on the way (unless it was cancelled?) I can see him saying yes to letting them run around killing. Lots of cosmetic choices too that I am sure some people would go nuts for unless they wanted to have multiple animatronics around the map like Pig boxes that the killer can jump to and reactivate.
---
That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs born to to he‚Äôs F‚ÄôING INVISIBLE and it‚Äôs real ex to get 4 k games
---
Tombstone
---
How does a battle pass make it Pay to Win? Looking at games with other Battle Passes are strictly cosmetics rewards. You don't get any kind of advantage over another player for simply having a cosmetic. The game is already Pay to Play as the game isn't free.
---
You should probably try to get as many teachables as you can. It means that you can experiment with different builds and you will have a more fun overall experience.
---
Nobody would like something that was originally free to get, from the community though.
---
These kinds of things I am grateful are not in Dead by Daylight and I confess my love for the game would suffer greatly if they are added. Please, PLEASE do not try to turn Dead by Daylight into Overwatch or Fortnite. It's Dead by Daylight let it STAY that way.
---
Implement more rules against BMing and such.
---
Pay to win mechanic for the goddamn battle pass. Pay to play for the goddamn battle pass, as in you get stuff every level compared to every 50 levels you get with the free battle pass.
---
24 year old man arguing with a kid on the internet over a game damn ur life is sad
---
"Men only wants one thing and it's fucking disgusting"
---
Me:
---
I‚Äôm just impressed you can see P3 Claudette‚Äôs. üòÇ
---
Serious answer:
---
From a psychological point of view... failure and disappointment are uncomfortable, and even more so if the fault is partially/fully your own. 
---
It's much easier to point a finger and say "no, it w as not my fault. It was the killers/survivors (exploiting cheap mechanics/playing dirty/cheating/etc...) that caused the game to go this way."
---
Of course, removing yourself from momentary discomfort also removes you from a very useful learning environment... so if someone does this they pretty much doom themselves to keep having shitty games... but there ya go
---
And he keeps waving hands, this means he needs help getting off the hook, let‚Äôs go other survivors!
---
This depends on the player. I personally have every killer teachable perk unlocked and now I'm trying to do the same with survivors. After I unlock all teachable perks I'm only gonna play Dwight as survivor and for killer I'll play 1 at a time to get them to P3. Do you want every perk just for the sake of having it or do you just want to unlock meta/good perks? The choice is yours
---
I wanna know who the fuck chose HEARTY to be one of the two options?
---
Swap L√©ry's for Haddonfield. You're otherwise spot on.
---
Bro I was about to go off then see /s
---
You don't win games by having cosmetics. Battle Passes have been purely cosmetics in other games, and I would be ok with DBD having one. What the difference of doing a battle pass for 10$ or releasing a new skin for 10$? If the battle pass has a free version you should be grateful for getting anything instead of just a cosmetic you would have to pay for.
---
Aim for level 40 with each survivor to begin with, gets you teachables so then everyone can use every perk. Killers too if u want to play them. Being level 40 should also give you enough perk choice, which will expand more as you keep playing.
---
I know. It's honestly quite shameful to say the least.
---
Gonna be honest I won't mind getting face camped by him.
---
... but they're in a snowy mountain in the middle of Alberta
---
What would bonus mean if not shards or bloodpoints? Auric cells, for example, may fall into the "rewards", but a bonus implies an increased / easier gain of something already accessible. Maybe bonus cosmetics? But it seems much more likely the bonus constitutes blood points or shards.
---
its just a little protest not a hate crime
---
I understand this reference.
---
Desperation; hoping you'll get away. It's a sacrifice play
---
But I only do that when there's no one else able to save you
---
Unless you're Trapper. It stops being funny the moment the first trap is disarmed.
---
Most serial killers prefer not to be identified.
---
No u.
---
Welcome to 2019. Stay. On. Topic.
---
The problem with getting teachable perks is it pollutes your bloodweb with crappy perks you'll never use, meaning each survivor will have a larger pool of potential perks, with less chance of rolling decent perks as their two options on a new bloodweb.
---
The problem with NOT getting teachable perks when they come available is that they keep showing up, which means your only other choice will be one regular perk (i.e, no choice between two at all).
---
So really your only choice is to make it progressively harder to level your survivors efficiently. For some survivors that have a crap level 35 perk, you can get away with leaving it locked as long as they're not your main (there's no reason that you can't leave Adam with Autodidact permanently locked, for example).
---
You can mitigate this by unlocking the best perks/survivors early and then levelling up your people around that, to maximise the chance you'll have a usable perk loadout by level 50.
---
why give exhaustion to something that doesnt come back?
---
I was pretty far right. Sure, people like to complain on this sub, but there are 100k subs here, so I'd say only about 10% complain about anything. 90k of you are pretty all right. 
---
In game, I've never had any issues. When survivor, I will usually call out any other survivor being a dick post-chat, and as killer, I let the last person go 90% of the time so post-game chat is always pretty chill.
---
both wrong "Thats how you play Wraith" 
---
HELL NAW!
---
"checking on generators across the mal and doesnt return to the unhooked" also wrong.
---
Three are many wrong things here
---
That's a really good way to look at it
---
Its a popular scene dude. im dead serious when I say that I had no idea of a post you made over 6.5 months ago. I purposely searched up words similar in my title and nothing showed up.
---
Meta !
---
*William Shatner mask
---
that only really works on low ranks
---
woah bro I wish I had your fully sick grinding skillz, you show those tryhards who's boss.
---
The doggo reminded me of something: you know which killer I would like to see in the future? A chupacabra. That would be creepy as fuck (go check it on google images if you don't know what that is)
---
lmao, well no shit! And by "protecting the gate" it means now chasing the person that was opening the gate while you go self-care a mile away and no-one opens the gate!
---
needs to be timed for when you finish the animation, not much else to it.
---
It will appear on EVERY blood web? How? Like I want to play the hag until lvl 35 to get teachable hex ruin and then move on to another killer ... so hex third seal can only show for the next 5 levels on the hag (31, 32, 33, 34) and then never again or do I miss something? 
---
If you want to explain in German (your username) it would be okay to me.
---
Thanks! I swear, some psyche grad student would have a field day with this community =P
---
What would be considered BMing? Repeating an animation? Using emotes to "taunt"? Hitting survivor on hook? C'mon...
---
We can report people who spew shit at you in post game chat (which anyone can close btw). Honestly, if someone gets tilted by an animation in a video game they're playing the wrong game.
---
Other forms of BM? End game collapse ensures survivors either GTFO or die so no more hiding around the map forever once gates are open and if you do it long enough it's bannable anyways. Same goes for any type of holding the game hostage (killer blocking survivors in a corner etc).
---
Neat
---
Or you can actually you know level-up Leatherface. Seriously doesn't take long.
---
double speed add ons with make your choice, punish all the unhooks :p
---
I can feel the wetness from that nose
---
LOL. Devs do this all the time. They literally asked if they wanted us to have p2w put on place. BHVR only cares about money and the only thing that survey was about is how to make more money off players.
---
I wasn't saying it's a good idea
---
Who the hell plays for BP rather than to have fun? Unless you want to do a daily my main objective is to have fun
---
But do you hate the rework?
---
I chose the middle option. Ash kinda covered her up, surprisingly
---
Lmao
---
As a Michael and Amanda main, I may have to start using these map offerings
---
(Also, swamp is fucking terrible for Amanda)
---
Survivor: Dead Hard, Mettle of Man, Decisive Strike, and Adrenaline.
---
Killer: Hex: Ruin, Discordance, Spirit Fury, Barbecue and Chili.
---
Feels nice seeing people talk about legion as an actual part of the game now that they're reworked.
---
Imagine using noed and thinking you‚Äôre better than your opponents
---
(sadly my German is very bad so I might as well proceed in English). Get the teachable once you see it show up on the bloodweb. If you don't, it will still show up on every bloodweb along with some other perk. It will still be there even on lvl 35, it's not like your regular perks. So get them as fast as you can, even if you don't want it and you're not going to use it. There's always 2 perks on the bloodweb, one of them being the teachable if you haven't unlocked it. Get the teachable - and for the next 4 bloodwebs you'll get different perks. And on lvl 35 you'll 100% get another teachable(otherwise you will get 2 teachables but the one teachable you didn't get will continue showing up on every bloodweb blocking the slot for other perks you might need(bc as I said there's always just 2 perk slots per bloodweb).
---
So if you get found early you just walk around injured the rest of the game, and hope the killer doesn't find you before the last gen pops? I prefer to have the luxury of being able to disengage and heal up.
---
That's coldwind farm map?
---
And dodge the Billy's chainsaw with ease
---
I was watching a stream the other day where this was the case as well.
---
Maybe, but considering a new cosmetic can't drop without something completely unrelated breaking makes me say no to this. This 1% increase on whatever would inevitably cause survivors to spawn on the hook or some shit.
---
*Kanye Impersionation*
---
Bhvr doesnt care about console players
---
It doesn't work for Hag? Or did you mean Trapper? I've never used the perk before
---
yeah. Inarguably the worst map for killer and legitimately unwinnable as anyone but nurse vs decent players.
---
THOUGH: the devs have actually acknowledged this, on the PTB coldwind is actually really fucking good, so this post will be outdated soon.
---
It's probably just cosmetics
---
Just answer me this. Did you ever had the feeling  that it was too hard for favorable perks to appear on blood web? Like I think unlocking perks is fun and I would like to unlock as many as I can but my biggest fear is that I level up a new killer all the way too lvl 40 or so and BBQ + Chili didn‚Äôt even appear on the web because the pool of perk options was just too big.
---
With peer to peer you're basically giving out your electronic address. This was very common at the start of the game. Can still work with a small script and Wireshark. This is the real reason most of us cried or about P2P connection. It had little to do with it being a cheap and dirty alternative to servers.
---
It's not OP survs just dont wanna take the time to cleanse but get upset when they get one hit
---
Dance with Me, Lithe, Borrowed Time, and Self Care/Adrenaline (I run SC if I‚Äôm playing solo, Adrenaline if I‚Äôm SWF) is my main build right now. 
---
Sometimes I‚Äôll swap Lithe for Balanced Landing and Borrowed Time for Quick &amp; Quiet which also works fairly well for me.
---
Yep, he's definitely getting downvoted because of triggered baby killers.
---
It's not OP, it's more frustrating because you realize you were the only one cleansing totems.
---
Cheap way for killers to guarantee a kill and potentially snowball on it.
---
I just have the hardest time on the meat packing map and lerys. I can usually find them on swamp.
---
Their to busy looking at the MOBA community. *"you rock!  Cancel that!"*
---
Now you just sound like an ahole
---
You put Coldwind above Haddonfield? 
---
Billy can dominate coldwind.
---
Paying for one cosmetic to play and unlock a whole bunch of cosmetics??? I would do that, idk why your so mad at an idea.
---
Lmao it's soooo easy to 360 console killers
---
Billy gets looped. Coldwind has exclusively see-through loops. 
---
Haddonfield is also dogshit and an instant "nope" from me, I play coldwind as RNG, but haddonfield Im out faster than my dad from my life no matter if offered or RNG.
---
I mean, Billy is decent because at least he can traverse all that stuff. Trapper to if he hides his traps well
---
But Dead by Daylight isn't a shooter game with a battle royal. Adding a battle pass would do nothing but add cosmetics to the game which are *100% optional*. It wouldn't be adding perks / killers into a battle pass, it's adding cosmetics which are *100% optional*. If given the option of a battle pass for 10$ or a new cosmetic for 10$ I'm going to pick the battle pass as they will generally have more to offer cosmetic wise. Yes you have to pay to  get items from a battle pass but the items in the battle pass are *100% optional*, doesn't add anything of value other than changing the looks of characters, or giving emotes/voice lines. Which again will **NOT** doing anything to help you play the game better, or give you an advantage over another player that has not spent money on the game. 
---
**Pay to win** means that money *gives* you an *advantage* over another player that has spent money on a game. For instance, mobiles game with gacha systems. Having better cards and a better team will give you advantage over people who are strictly F2P in a PvP setting. 
---
**Cosmetics** adds emotes, voice lines, and skins to a character that doens't change the base gameplay of the game and does *not give an advantage* over someone who hasn't bought. 
---
For instance, if you had two people and they both played similar the same skill level. One player wouldn't have an "edge" or "advantage" over the other one for simply having a skin, emote or voice line. 
---
Cosmetics =/= Skill : You don't suddenly get better for having a cosmetic from any source either it be from a battle pass, event, store, or anywhere. 
---
I hope that you can understand this a little bit better.

P.S. I didn't bring up the Rank System. That shit needs to be fixed. It's been broken since D1 and rank doesn't mean anything in terms of skills, or anything it's always been a "playtime" rank as in the more you play the more you rank up and that's just about it.
---
Yes, it feels like it's hard to get ruin and BBQ in the blood web  and some of my killers do t have either but it doesn't bother me. Im ok with whatever perks I get by random in the blood web.
---
People just hate the exposed status us general.
---
Yeah Billy gets looped but I can take solace in the fact that the good loops are DECENTLY spread out. 
---
Haddonfield is the only map I will DC on, whether it‚Äôs offered or not...and I don‚Äôt advocate for quitting.

---
Yeah but coldwind is huge so trapper can only reasonably fetch like half of his traps. 
---
It's disgustingly good for Nurse though, since if you can see well through foliage the survs basically have nothing to hide behind.
---
Ironically I said it's to the right :P You guys like to shit on eachother alot (not literally) but this is a pretty chill community you can very easily chill and have a convo with someone and memes as shit as some are, are pretty good xD
---
Yeah she's a dirty bitch.
---
Why was he so obsessed with the fortune teller anyway? (Insert joke about Jeff's lack of future here)
---
Not really op, just hella annoying, since you've pretty much already won and then you get one shot right at the gate, and the killers who run NOED have "all survivors need to go fuck themselves" policy" and not give you any sort of Mercy and kills you.
---
It's either a bug or a new feature to throw people off for obsession based perks.
---
I dont advocate for quitting either that's just what I'd rather do, though party streamers are an exception I try not to make those go into waste.
---
Its a very powerful perk. That's seen quite a few reworked. 
---
I think its a great perk, especially for the less powerful killers because it can really snowball a game for the killer if the survivors caught in a bad area of the map.
---
The main way to counter it is by cleansing totems, people say cleansing is a waste of time. But honestly if everyone was assertive moving from gen to gen you could cleanse the whole map, its just most people prefer to just rush the gens and ignore totems unless its a hex totem or in those dumb instances of *Megs cleaning a dull one while Jake is on the hook and you have the killer with you on the other side of the map*. **Seriously MEG!**
---
Ruin, Whisper, BBQ, preference perk.
---
Really is
---
I play on consol
---
Thats why i run Save the best for last and Rancor, because i LITERALLY Save the best for last
---
It is easy on console it‚Äôs more smooth
---
then i probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend nurse :P
---
Imagine having to camp as the wraith! You must be dog shit at killer. he has amazing addons that he can zoom around cloaked and check gens and find someone else. I'm really sick of stupid people on dbd reddit always justifying bad play style. Get some skills make the game fun on both sides. I dont need to camp or tunnel as killer and I'm not even that good and I usually at least get a 3k because I don't slug or camp hatch either.  Or if the survivors are really good I might not get any kills.. it is what it is. I'm not supposed to get a 4k every match and survivors arent ment to survive every match.
---
What else do you run and on who?
---
YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You rude
---
Lmao your the most unlikeable guy in this subreddit. Do you even have friends or something?
---
This week's shrine is absolutely garbage lol.  Guess I'm sitting on my shards another week.
---
I though Flip Flop was going to be the best perk ever. Unbreakable + Flip Flop + Tenacity + Boil Over.
---
Haven't had much luck with it..
---
Can't wait to fortnite dance on the killer at the exit gate
---
Well I have to work too so I can't dedicate all that time to For Honor, and it's frustrating.
---
Why i have no problem with the blinks
---
No because I want gameplay fixes. Like yknow, proper balance.
---
because *fuck my drag for cycling through me killers and i just happened to be a huntress in that match and not a doctor right?*
---
You did not read a single thing i wrote about what i meant by p2w did you?
---
 **Pay to win mechanic for the battle pass ----&gt; You have to pay to get items from the battle pass**
---
**Cod br game has that, it is literally impossible to get all shit without getting a boost (paying for a boost)**
---
PAY TO WIN THE BATTLE PASS
---
I never said you get better. It adds variety wich this game desperately needs. 
---
Also p2w on some cosmetics can be debatable cough cough p3 claudette cough cough
---
The picture that shows up when to lookup "Sardonic" in the dictionary.
---
And yes I know, different teams different tasks. But it's still them being able to be lazy on other aspects of the game to make a quick buck.
---
As if the search times aren't long enough, let's just go ahead and add more game modes..
---
I tried to be as fair as possible in the answers but I it was hard not to feel pretty bummed afterwards, realizing how many negative answers I had to give. :(
---
hurrr everyone who disagrees with me is an edgy kid durr MUH GEN X MUH TYPOS 
---
yeah. top quality cunt material. sad old man.
---
To be honest I experience either very kind people who give the killer advice or tell him that he did well OR ultra salty and toxic gg ez baby killer motherfu
---
So are survivors supposed to stand out in the open and just go afk so you can get an easy 4k. Dude you get bloodlust and theres enduring and spirit fury to help with looping pallets.
---
It feels like it is displeasing because there are some people who are just super toxic, the kind that only exists because there are no repercussions for and they know they can just say every shitty thing they want.  There are definitely a lot of people who are enjoyable to play with, that will say GG and have fun with the games instead of trying to make the opposite side as angry as possible.
---
Behavior absolutely does have a meaningful impact to their community and can reform them.  I think the Blizzard approach is absolutely wrong, no one should be banned for things that they say or how they act in and post game.  However there are ways to incentivize positive behaviors.  If a player consistently is a good sport and is fun to play with and receives positive rep at the end of a match, that player should be rewarded.  The player seeing that they were rewarded for their good behavior will encourage not only that player to continue being a positive player, but other people who hear about this will want to reach that status for the reward.  Negative people should not be banned, outright punished, or moved to their own separate toxic queue but they can miss out on good player rewards, maybe give them a notification of their extreme toxic behavior to let them know they are not even close to getting their positive player rewards, and maybe even a lower priority in queuing.  A lower priority will not stop them from matching with anyone, but it might take them a bit longer to find a match, and allows positive players to get matched quicker over them leading to more positive games.  Positive people's spirits can be contagious, so it would be important to foster that.  Also one more thing, there needs to be forgiveness, a reason for a toxic player to stop, like a reset of toxic status every month with the rank reset, or every other reset.
---
O shit I care
---
LOL! wraith is FAR from OP, he is low tier killer at most being a only m1 killer
---
I run it on spirit because im trying her new and thats the only perks i can use for her at the moment xD My built isnt anything special i just found that the combination of Save the best and rancor work since i dont have to worry about the obssession at the endgame. Also the other 2 perks i just put random shit.
---
And have you noticed that the skin-covered half of the ebony one seems like it's screaming in agony while it's not on the green and yellow moris ?
---
You should try using haunted grounds
---
at red ranks it‚Äôs probably very hard if the survivors know how to juke a nurse.
---
Billy is balanced
---
This community isn‚Äôt toxic change my mind
---
Not OP just a crutch perk
---
Imagine leatherface doing the default dance before he moris you
---
Your point of it now clogging up other character's bloodwebs is fair, but I don't think you're going to see any real effect. Each survivor already starts with 17-20 perk options (3 personal and 14 all survivor + Bill's 3 on console). Adding perks to that pool causes such a small probability change to the RNG I wouldn't worry about it. 
---
That being said, I get everyone's teachable perks just to get them off that character's bloodweb. Unless you unlock the teachable, it's going to keep popping up for you to unlock every time you level up instead of another usable perk. I get it out of the way so I can go back to getting the actual loadout I want on that character.
---
ooh yeah thats the other thing i have on her, haunted grounds and ruin, i couldnt remember xD
---
Well if they're fucking around, they completely deserve what's coming next
---
I'm convinced we (survivor mains) are all just a bunch of masochists.
---
Pay to win? If they did add a pass it would just be cosmetics
---
Damn, that‚Äôs some good short shit right there homie. How is something like this made?
---
See you must be having a really hard time comprehending what I said. 
---
Pay to win gives you advantage, like you said in Call of Duty. But Dead by Daylight isn't Call of Duty. The only thing that devs can put behind a paywall in a battle pass to make it a pay to win mechanic is to lock perks, new characters, and new killers in a battle pass. Outside of that anything you get from a battle pass wouldn't be pay to win, and would be again 100% OPTIONAL. 
---
1 - P3 Claudette, can be obtained by anyone making it a "Free" option, she isn't locked to a chapter and is unlocked by putting time into. No other cosmetics in the game, and if you look at the cosmetics that came out in the store they are all bright, colorful and do the opposite as making it easier to hide.
---
This should be fixed on the PTB at least.
---
I felt so bad when I didnt notice the tombstone Myers tiering up on me... lost us that entire game X)
---
he's gotta get those *precious* internet points, ya know
---
oh yeah definitely if I see a stropde key, lerys glasses or a heart locket in the loading screen im just gonna pull up the task manager, at that point they wasted their own party streamers.
---
Then 1 member will run smallgame in the swf. Making them even more powerful. You think having a team helps them count? Try swf after playing a few games in a row. They will forget they broke totems or think they broke more when it was the game before. Throw in certainty and yeh gg. Rip noed.
---
Its a nice thought and id like it since im the totem breaker on the team but when you take a moment to honestly think about it. Its not good
---
Trick question: the answer is Premonition. I prefer it to Spine Chill bc I don't just know if the killer sees me/is coming, I know what direction they're coming from. I kept running smack into the killer with Spine Chill.
---
They will become a part of you
---
Killers have complained that survivors need a secondary objective while also clamoring that totems are just that. I think itll be fine, survivors rarely do them anyways unless they see them glow.
---
Sad thing s just, it's the latter kind that everyone tends to remember.
---
Omfg i thought i was the only one
---
Exposed son
---
you said no hate because you know youre trash for camping and will get hate for it right?
---
I play pretty close to equal and if you factor in that there's 4x as many survivors as there are killers in every game, you'll see the % is pretty close. Remember, every survivor team has 4 chances of asshole while you'd have to play 4 killers to equal the potential
---
I play on PS4 but my brother plays on PC and he‚Äôll send me some pretty funny names he comes across haha
---
feng:
---
build isnt complete because neither wglf or dead hard will show up in my damn bloodweb but whatever
---
Iron will (wglf and dead hard when i get them) and adrenaline
---
Literally just had some random Reddit account, who I‚Äôve never seen before, call me bad because I refuse to play Haddonfield. 
---
Good thing this person has won as killer and been crushed as survivor on that map so that validates why you should play.
---
Yeah, I put it two notches to the right
---
It doesn't tell you NOED is active until it's too late.
---
Solo survivors have no way of telling how many totems were cleansed. 
---
It gives you an absurd speed boost in late game phase where there are much fewer pallets.
---
 It can secure a kill or two which if you might have not deserved in the first place. 
---
I will not get into a discussion about it. Just stating what makes it OP.
---
it's not about kills. It's about general gameplay enjoyment. Yes, degenerate survivors will still lose, even in that map, but that doesnt mean the match was worth playing for the killer.
---
You cant juke nurse
---
In the newest BHVR survey asking for suggestions for improvement to dbd, they ask if we‚Äôd be interested in a *colorblind option*
---
It‚Äôs about time üëç
---
No it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want the guy getting reported also killers can do whatever strategy we WANT all these survivor mains won‚Äôt tell us what we do plus do generators when we camp smh the devs love survivor mains too much
---
Ok who does that is pathetic. And I like playing bong boy. Not cash money for us moral players
---
Happy Halloween! :D Happy Halloween! :D Happy Halloween! :D Happy Halloween! :D
---
some pc nurses can be juked, so some console nurses definitely can too.
---
I thought it was cool how Ash has a couple lines when he gets loaded into a lobby. I thought maybe the other Survivors could do this too. Maybe at random one of them will say a line.
---
helllll yeah that's why even some of the best players in the game insta-DC the map, they're obviously bad because they dont want to play in a dogshit maze of houses and great walls.
---
LMAO
---
ERROR 404: RESPECT NOT FOUND
---
Yes
---
It sounds like you're describing dinner not a community
---
why so toxic?
---
There is honestly no better surprise than finding someone in a locker and all you wanted was hatchets lol
---
Let‚Äôs see, you are:
---
- offering absolutely nothing to the conversation, whereas I actually explained my reasoning for disliking the post. 
---
- actually ARE trying to trigger an emotional response by the feeble use of ‚Äòmom‚Äô jokes and crude language. 
---
- constantly coming back only to make even more rude statements. 
---
If all that goes over your head, I guess I‚Äôll have to defer to a type of language you‚Äôre able to understand. 
---
You‚Äôre being an actual cunt.
---
how do you even 360 on console? i try to do it but my dumbass ends up running right into the killer as they swing SKSKSK
---
Nope, i give up, you are actually iliterate. IM GONNA GIVE YOU ONE MORE FUCKING CHANCE DUDE. READ THIS WORD FOR WORD AND CONNECT THEM
---
I DREW A FUCKING ARROW FOR YOU YOU CANT BE THAT BRAINDEAD
---
because he is.
---
Op not at all, annoying as hell yes
---
You on ps4? I'll prove it.
---
the Wraith that grabbed someone out of the hatch? how is that toxic lol
---
But really hard to juke nurse
---
Why would *anybody* leave a hooked survivor when the gates are powered? If they get unhooked, theres a very high chance that they'll escape, especially if they're running BT&amp;Adrenaline
---
did you read the whole post? he camped every hook, and he seems proud of it. it‚Äôs disgusting.
---
I actually really like the progression system, the grind is part of the appeal for me. 
---
If we got everything too fast/too easily I'd probably get bored. The prestiege system speaks to my inner completionist, haha.
---
Would be funny if Legion activates feral frenzy but falls because of the sandals
---
Oh never mind you are the trash camping op lol.  Your comment was weird dude made no sense too.  Also why do you want me to sit on a hook is it so you can trashcamp me with your Insidious legend?
---
üòÇ don‚Äôt you like getting tbagged?
---
I get that but its also not rly grinding if u only have to play a bit every day
---
Just get the pallet buster perk:speeds up breaking the gens and pallets,also use doc and making pallet illusions are fun
---
Let me tell you a story, about my Feng Min after I started playing on PS4 (when my then-computer stopped wanting to run games.)
---
Feng Min was the third character I got to 40 (Claudette, Nea, Feng Min.) Feng Min did not have Self Care. I got her to 50. No Self Care. Now, I don't run Self Care all the time, but I like having it as an option for when I'm solo queue for long periods of time &amp; fall into one of the periods with a series of unhelpful teammates. I got everyone else to level 40 -- which, at the time, was Dwight, Jake, Ace, Laurie &amp; David King.
---
Then I figured, well, I was planning on prestiging Feng Min eventually anyway, so let's do it, instead of continually putting bloodpoints into her past level 50.
---
Do you know when I eventually got Self Care on Feng Min? Prestige 3, level 5. So yes, it can be absurdly difficult to get the perks you want.
---
My suggestion is as follows: put bloodpoints into whichever character you intend to "main," and get them a workable perk set based on what you currently have unlocked... then go back &amp; unlock all other perks on other people. This way, your "main" starts out with only the perks you really want, and you can still unlock perks that are good little bonuses after the fact. Nothing says you can't stop putting bloodpoints into someone for now, and return to it later.
---
So basically what I guess I'm saying is, if you want Adrenaline on your Claudette, get Meg to level 40 &amp; then do bloodwebs on Claudette until you get Adrenaline. If you decide you then want Iron Will, get Jake to 30 &amp; then do bloodwebs on Claudette until you get Iron Will. You can isolate what perk you're looking for a little that way.
---
You're lucky. Seems like my summer vacation is over.
---
My frames don't drop as often or as hard so... console Master race is OUT OF HERE!
---
Did u see the part where he said he was dwight?
---
This change wouldn‚Äôt effect swf at all, it would just helps solo survivors to coordinated better.
---
You really think swf don‚Äôt count totem? Have you ever really played in a good swf, they will mostly 100% search for totems before powering the last gens so Noed is gone anyway with them.
---
I really can‚Äôt see your point since this, like I said, would buff just solo survivors
---
In coming Trapper: The Musical
---
I honestly hate the stealth aspect on both sides.
---
Hiding from the killer doesn't thrill me, it's just sitting in one spot and not moving. As killer looking for the survivor is the most boring thing in the world.
---
O shit that's deep
---
Loading screens and icons yes
---
Emotes have big gay
---
That's the worst part about it though.  OP refuses to acknowledge that's what he did.  He clearly Insidious camped into Mori but he continues to claim he was "experimenting" with Insidious and did not use it once.  So full of shit lol.  I'd actually have more respect for the trashcan if he admitted that's what he did lol.
---
David main here.
---
WMI, DH, WGLF, and BT.
---
O shit I'm 14
---
Good point with that one. If a killer plays 10 matches in a day they‚Äôve interacted with 40 people, if you play survivor you‚Äôve only interacted with 10 killers. I just always look at it like survivors have more of an ability to be toxic. SWF stacks teabagging, running annoying perks/items, and generally BM‚Äôing, stuff like that. The worst thing a killer could do is have annoying perks and facecamp, but even facecamping is detrimental to the success of the game itself for the killer. Whereas survivors can be as toxic as they want and still be actively winning the game.
---
Yeah got called a camper after facing an excessively altruistic 4-man SWF. Anytime I got into a chase, here comes 3 other survivors to flashlight blind me. Anytime I got someone downed, here comes 3 other survivors to bodyblock and flashlight blind me on my way to the hook. Anytime I hooked someone, here comes 1 survivor tbagging out in the open clearly trying to "pull aggro" and get me to chase them.
---
So yeah I'll absolutely patrol that hook when this particular survivor team has taught me that they **will** all show up in short order to save the guy.
---
he clearly didnt Camp every hook or he wouldnt have gotten 22k Points.
---
Also, OP is a new Player, so he probably doesnt know that it gets you faster Kills if you let people unhook.
---
Also, he probably doesnt really know how Wraiths Power(which is pretty weak) can be used aside from that
---
O shit me too
---
Wasn‚Äôt there a word they banned in Overwatch pro live streams even though the word was in one of the characters abilities?
---
Unless you're dead on hook, don't do that. Being chased is as important as opening the gate. Most players have enough empathy to at least attempt a rescue if you get hooked after the gates open.
---
It‚Äôs works both for trapper and hag, but we can easily see trapper‚Äôs traps and with hag you can crouch so it makes the perk useless in that aspect
---
First look at new emote
---
‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ Summon the Freddy plans ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ we were promised mid chapter! My boy will finally be changed
---
he SAID he camped hooks. try looking at the title. also, rank doesn‚Äôt mean anything, someone proud of camping is still proud of camping.
---
It's literally optional cosmetics.
---
If you don't want to use the battle pass, it doesn't affect you at all.
---
hahahahahaahah
---
And slugging
---
Would love for this to be added. It just needs to be default for everyone playing including killer.
---
i didnt say you can't camp, i just said youre trash for it.
---
Can you also do this without the legacy stuff?
---
Summer collection for survivors
---
Speedo ace, bikini Meg, birthday suit Kate, dwight can also get a bikini
---
Not really in the game anymore but Trapper‚Äôs beta stun noise.
---
just run bond and find a teammate. gives them altruism points, and you can find a gen and work on it together after.
---
Well my initial "crude" response to you was you acting like a cunt in the conversations,  am not trying to trigger something mate,  don't be offended and cry about people writing to you on a gaming subreddit
---
Again would advice stop acting like a whiny cunt.
---
Props to you for writing in bullets tho!
---
now you didnt read my comment lol.
---
He cant have Camped EVERY  hook like you claimed.
---
and Im not talking about his rank, but his actual level, he is lvl 15, probably played less then 10 games
---
A lot of people enjoy battle passes in other games, why not ask about it?
---
Plus it's all optional cosmetics, they don't affect gameplay.
---
ok, but camping hooks in general is bad, it makes no difference.
---
Solidarity? I‚Äôm a guy who loves making fun builds with new perks but I think Solidarity is too situational. The game is too centered around chase being started and ended for you to consistently get use out of it IMO. Unless you‚Äôre brown shirt Claudette with Iron Will among other stealth perks. Chase should probably end with you/someone else getting hooked. 
---
Dance With Me is okay, I just wish it had an active time indicator as well as 2 more seconds to make it not so reliant on combos.
---
Deliverance is very risky albeit a time saver indeed. But I also think the broken status lasts a smidge too long.
---
Distortion is alright but boring.
---
I get what you mean but a lot of perks suffer from being inconsistent even in entire builds made for them which is why people stick to wildly powerful perks like MoM+Adr. Flip Flop SUCKS. I‚Äôve run the entire build for it aka FF, Unbreakable, Ten, and BO- even in the most optimal situations, like I‚Äôm inside an obscure place with stuff to bump into, fully recovered for full flip-flop(which doesn‚Äôt even go up to 50 wiggle like it says lol) and I get hooked.
---
If a killer is camping a hook, as in literally standing there near the hook to the exclusion of checking gens, that's a losing move. Sure it's unfun for the camped survivor, but that's a free win for everyone else.
---
Either the killer will notice that they continuously lose games when they camp, or you'll rank up and leave such killers behind because killers like that don't rank up.
---
no, as a survivor I have the opinion that giving survivors even more information is going to cause more roflstomped killers.
---
Yeah it could be nice if it was added to the killer too
---
As long as it remains super subtle and doesn't become fortnite I'm fine.
---
It's in this but it doesn't say

Here comes the Trapper you better watch out for his traps
---
Trapper: On ice!
---
ye....but if no one explains why, to new players they take way longer to unterstand why.
---
So instead if throwing random insults, try to explain it to them next time :)
---
I don't feel that way at all, I've played a lot of Leatherface, Wraith &amp; Myers and still stayed in the red ranks.
---
You can see players like ScottJund, ZubatLeL etc. playing random killers with random perks at high ranks and still win almost every game. It's really not that bad if you know how to play killer well.
---
Because only a small, newb portion of the killer base complain about this kind of stuff and it complains about the opinion being unpopular. It‚Äôs not. 90% of the killers are thinking, ‚Äúyea well no shit‚Äù.
---
Your save file you see in the PTB is backed up at a certain date prior to the PTB's launch, so whatever your stats were in live game at that time is what you start as in PTB. They don't do these back-ups in the middle of the PTB, so the next PTB-related backup will be prior to the NEXT PTB.
---
What the hell? This community isn't toxic! Go die. How dare you call us toxic you dick!
---
Thought so.
---
Can you look around while in insidious?
---
What kind of rewards are we talking about here?
---
Fuckin got em.
---
What more information do solo have?
---
This could be a nice step to reunite the gap between solos and swf.
---
And reducing this would benefit us all since then if you want to nerf a survivor you can nerf without worrying of getting solos nerfed to hell
---
Its to see what demographic plays their game.
---
Idk bout y'all but I'm loving the wraith
---
plot twist: hes actually an0nymooose
---
No this should not be a thing because it would remove survivors incentive to move around the map. 
---
They shouldn‚Äôt add anything like that for survivors. That removes an aspect from the game; TERROR. Survivors of the game should be terrified looking around for objectives, and walking around the map looking for totems is part of that equation. Survivors already have a ‚Äúnotification‚Äù type system when important totems are taken. 
---
To add, totems are already weak right now. I understand that you‚Äôre saying this from a solo point of view, but killers still have games vs solo survivors where important totems get taken down in the first minute of the game. Now the killer has useless perks because his totems are gone. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt think this is a good idea.
---
Everyone knows its gonna be a battle pass battle pass=uninstall
---
But you don't need to buy DLC, and you can unlock non- licensed killers with shards and everything. Perks too.
---
What res is this?
---
Try not going on the steam forums
---
Just donk em for some blood points and watch them run like gerbils
---
Balanced landing, aftercare, adrenaline and iron will/quick and quiet
---
My favorite map for Trapper is Grim Pantry, because the grassy areas below stairs/ramps always catches people.
---
I find generally that certain trap spots are "Expected," like shack window &amp; most pallets, and good survivors will work around them instead of stepping in them, but nobody seems to suspect random high-traffic grassy areas.

Yeah I don't really get the lobby dodging thing.
---
If you get high ping lobbies several times in a row then you shouldn't be punished for choosing not to play them out.
---
Hey kid? Have you attended any operas or ballets recently?
---
I haven't played dbd in like 2 months and the first game I got a camping/tunneling Micheal with infinite tier 3, with Noed and I'm rank 16
---
Going to be blunt. Is it hard to keep track of five totems? Like maybe if one is chased all game but, imo, as one is hopping from gen to gen just be aware.
---
But I want to floss like a boss when I pallet stun the Killer.
---
Our nurses are trash, so we got that goin' for us.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if this is being sarcastic or just further proving my point lol
---
tip: dont start off with nurse. Start off with like myers or billy. easy to learn and very rewarding. Nurse isnt worth it to start out with. Also, even though you might want to,  youll get better by not camping.
---
Lol a rank 20 noob wraith camping people? I am shocked.
---
Just a heads up OP, that weak ass camping and tunneling strategy will only get you so far.
---
I see you're on ps4... Maybe I should get on my smurf account and teach some lessons
---
Just bust the pallet and boom
---
I don‚Äôt agree with your whole point of terror since I find this useless.
---
After you play a few matches this game is no longer scary so I don‚Äôt see your point.
---
When were survivors scared of going around the map? High ranks don‚Äôt care about that.
---
Also this doesn‚Äôt remove the incentive but makes you wanna go looking for it too.
---
Before it was useless because you couldn‚Äôt know how many there were but with this survivors will go looking more often
---
Yeah david king for were gonna live forever and dead hard is probably the best choice starting out
---
It‚Äôs not op, it‚Äôs just annoying to solo survivors or very altruistic survivors. Lila can still easily be looped if they have no ed.
---
The fact that it's not obvious that I was kidding still proves your point
---
Also a good point! Much more room for toxic survivors
---
Maybe it's because it's the fact that They're ready to make a feature absolutely nobody wanted, but refuse to add dedicated servers.
---
Horror game, lul. For a killer that is
---
Learn from it, because survivors were OP at some point alot of toxic people came in, they cant reverse it, they just have to learn that bad balance brings in toxic people
---
Because I enjoy the premise of the game. The negative behaviors I experience from other players in the match and on this subreddit aren‚Äôt enough to deter me from playing, but does that automatically mean I can‚Äôt complain?
---
I'll accept defeat,gimme blood points and lemme learn from it
---
Plus you can grab the survivor out of it if you click early enough. And this incredibly situational stun that is fully banking on the killer not paying attention is affected by enduring.
---
Exhaustion perk btw.
---
Not at all. If he was camping hooks you all should have slammed gens while he stood still letting you.
---
Punish campers, get shit done.
---
It‚Äôs not the fact of keeping track, it‚Äôs the fact that you don‚Äôt know how many remains.
---
Like you could have been spending 3 minutes looking for 4 of them and you couldn‚Äôt find the last one. Was the last one cleansed or not? That is the problem with solos
---
True!! Out of all the hate on the subreddit from both sides, it‚Äôs always nice to see some positive memes!!
---
This hurts my soul.   
---
I'm so close to quitting the game after days of numerous crashing when offering something good. &lt;/3
---
i laughed harder than i should have
---
as a legion main i REALLY WANT THIS
---
I‚Äôm on xbox ...
---
OUR\* boy.
---
I‚Äôve been that person in the locker. They even told me afterwards they didn‚Äôt mean to find me there üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs so true!! lol
---
Looks like the final shot of an entity porno
---
I'm not colorblind but I instantly put "Very Interested" when I saw it. I see so many posts from colorblind people on the forums and subreddit and I feel awful knowing that there are people who find this game a lot harder to play just because Behavior refuses to add accessibility options.
---
You should always have more accessibility options in your game. More people playing is never a bad thing, and allowing people who otherwise can't play games to play your game is a great way to promote inclusivity and access a niche market.
---
I've seen a lot of gamers with disabilities on YouTube and Twitch and it's always sad to see the lengths they have to go to in order to play the games that they love. But at the same time it's truly a joy to see these people having fun despite their disabilities.
---
Its not OP its cheap, it gifts free kills to shit killers
---
More like the killer trying survive vs four savage killers lol
---
he didn‚Äôt ask me what was wrong when i told him to get a life, he just insulted back, which shows that he knows camping is bad. imagine defending campers :/
---
Yeah but nothing you can do about that lol. Some people are just asses :D
---
Ace would be the dad that's forced to be there to make sure nobody is dirty dancing, but in reality he doesn't give a shit and lets it happen lol
---
It doesnt matter what killer you play if you just camp
---
I'm tired of being camped all the time, that why I started playing killer. Now I have my own rules I don't bring moris unless its a one person mori and no franklins I don't tunnel or camp and I respect good plays. Thats how killers standards should be so thats what I do.
---
Complaining for no reason, not cringe at all
---
Trust me, you should invest in pallets; upgraded pipes are so last year.
---
Preach.
---
I'm an Aussie red ranks Survivor (because I play often) and am effectively banned from playing on XB1. Not actually banned but my que time is generally minimum 10 minutes and also experience these duo disconnects so not actual games either. Last 2 games were 14 and 21 minute 'searching for lobby'
---
Seeing red rank ANYONE is rare these days (not hard to see why with the DC's) so there are no suitable match's for me? 
---
SHOULD I START TO RUIN THE GAME FOR OTHERS  BY DC'ing MYSELF SO THAT I MAY PLAY THIS GAME? SEEMS COUNTER INTUITIVE AND DISREPECTFUL OF MINE AND OTHERS TIME!!
---
no...that just means he doesnt like being insulted in the first place *lol*
---
Balanced landing giving me Pearl from steven universe vibes
---
As fun as it sounds it would actually be a pretty bad idea considering you would have people who would only pick one meta character.
---
I mean the amount of squadettes you would see you would literally make you want to puke
---
More like David in a locker! AM I RIGHT LADIES?!

---
And the survivors don't get an option of dodging ebony mori instasaw billys/omegablink nurses/purple add ons spirits/exhaustion &amp; bleach clowns?
---
Why should only one side have that privelage? Either make it so both sides can see or remove the option for both sides.
---
As a killer main, don't worry I won't dodge you.
---
But.  I would like to extend this to also say many survivors need to man up when the trial starts.  This of course if not directly aimed at OP (I feel your plight), so take it as a general message.
---
Lots of players in this game are cowards.  I know killers dodge, and that's unfortunate.  Just the same though, survivors oftentimes don't want to play out an entire trial.
---
If I down a survivor early, or get Evil Within II quickly off of your teammate, don't you dare disconnect on me.  You're in here with me.  This ends when you get out, or when you get sacrificed on that hook.
---
Now that said, it's going to happen whether I want it to or not.  As a killer there is nothing I can do to keep a stranger from disconnecting.  I don't honestly want penalties for disconnecting, but what I do want is appropriate compensation.  I should get credit for each of the disconnected survivor's remaining possible hooks and the sacrifice, at MINIMUM.  I'm not even asking for the chase, attacking, and special ability points.  I just want what is fairly mine, since we all know that almost every time a survivor disconnects, it is because the killer is going to do well against them.
---
*Legion frenzy stun noises remixed into Megalovania*
---
Lovely.
---
I think it's either to gauge interests on what kind of killer/survivor/cosmetics they could introduce, or to figure out a demographic of their playerbase.
---
A lot of those questions were definitely weird though.
---
Found it on Facebook my dude, I‚Äôm sorry
---
You're a trash wraith then
---
Not to say that League of Legends is a beacon of kindness, but I like the honor system.  Let players get swag for being upvoted enough.  Give them a particular bonus for being upvoted a lot by the opposite team.
---
It won't erase the problem, but it would help.
---
Exactly.
---
Steam Workshop for Dead by Daylight would be fantastic. Yes we would get some great skins and it would be a wonderful way for talented community members to contribute to the game, but think about it like this:
---
We start with custom cosmetics and then we get a map creator or animation creator. And after getting access to those we might even be able to pich in beta ideas for new Killer powers or new perks.
---
Community created cosmetics would be the first step to the community being able to work nearly one-on-one with the developers in order create new and exciting content.
---
In the words of Ben Brode: "There's an infinite number of players out there when compared to our development team." You never know who's out there waiting to create the next Michael Myers. Or the next Freddy, to be fair.
---
This is def a waste of money. I'd buy ten if it was Feng though.
---
I play both evenly, I just love those perks that give only small benefits, makes the game more fun for me.
---
&gt; so as to avoid getting skill checks.
---
oh. What's it called then when you repair a gen for a moment and then move on to a different gen so that when the killer comes by they'll see the pistons moving and "waste" their time damaging it? I always thought that was called gen tapping because you're tapping the gen to get it started.
---
But of course its gonna have super boring challenges or challenges for killer like sacrifice x number of survivors and bad killers will just facecamp their whole life
---
It doesn't, you're a garbage wraith
---
That whole interaction between Dany and Sansa was so funny. It's like "heyyyy girl I'm fuckin yo brother!"
---
I Like To Wear Shorts! They‚Äôre comfy and easy to wear!
---
Now you‚Äôre getting it
---
Bad mannered/Bad manners
---
Do you have a Dwight legacy one? These are so cool!
---
It's literally cosmetics, who cares about cosmetics?
---
You are bringing up gameplay affecting microtransactions, while we are talking about battle passes that give you cosmetic items. And we're not getting rid of the in-game shop, so I don't get what the problem is?
---
We're not introducing Overwatch's only-lootboxes model.
---
I've only been playing a couple months and as a killer I'm already at the point where I'm just ignoring chat altogether.  i'm putting survivors on hooks, but the real sociopaths are on the other team.
---
Not OP, but extremely frustrating. It's the same reason that old Decisive Strike was so hated. It's a very cheap reward.
---
Honestly I don't think the perks work well as a collective. I get the point of a perk is to have something unique that gives you an advantage but in this case there is a lack of uniformity in it. It would be nice to have a style for each character, but keeping a central theme for the sake of having a mix-and-match compatibility, there are some perks that I do like in your pack, though there are some that are lacking. An example of this is having Balanced Landing just colored purple, but the other perks have a mire consistent place. Really the only thing that ties Balanced Landing with the perk adjacent to it is the top perk has purple where they connect and I don't think you did that on purpose. I do like the color grading that Nea walks past. It would look appealing to have Nea colored in a minimalistic style with flashy colors in the background or even a patterned brick background to keep the theme of "Street Rat" that she is and I saw that you tried it with concrete which is nice. I think my favorite perk you've done is Distortion though, I like that one a lot. I just wish the other perks for the characters had a matching theme on a per-character basis.
---
What if it was free stuff? Like a workshop on steam?
---
Just play survivor until you get a match with her and study every move she makes like a popular one where she pretends to phase and you vault the window so she hits you and add-ons are your best bet for longer phasing and remember you can pull people off gens if you cant get near the gen like if you were a survivor to fix it that means there is a survivor in front of you which means if you come out of phase be fast and ready to pick up a survivor off of the gen and on your way to the hook don't be afraid to hit a survivor.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking
---
I will but it's honestly harder the more you do because I'm running into the issue of making too many perks too similar in coloring.
---
to communicate with fellow survivors outside of voice chat? wave = follow me. point = go that way / killer is that way.
---
Perk though are just whatever works for you.
---
He moris a survivor then brings them back to help with the other 3
---
I have no idea why they even made the Hearty option, nobody chose that.
---
Yes, since I was on a phone call irl, since that call was more important than a video game. So yeah I was in a locker. Also Dwights live in lockers, but I guess you missed that part.
---
This! Lobby wait times are ridiculous as of late! I've never waited this long before and when I do finally get a lobby...red ping üòí
---
Credit to @dont_nerf_claudette
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
The community is soft as fuck. 
---
Theres people demanding a solution to the "problem" of survivors not running through the exit unless chased. The obvious solution is to just walk at them so they're forced to leave, but people bitch and moan about how they "shouldn't have to". Then, in the next comment, they complain about how their role doesn't get to control the pace of the game and don't see the irony.
---
I'm all for the end game collapse because I've had to quit games before when survivor(s) made a point to hide, and this will fix that. But the whole complaining about a free hit at the end thing is the biggest eye-roll ever. How soft can they be? If they lose and see "gg ez" I bet they literally cry.
---
When I was traveling for work I took my PS4 with me and bought DbD. It was amazingly easy for both sides. Couldn't play Nurse at all though, due to FPS issues.
---
Oh no someone downvoted my comment and called me a moron on the internet! Time to go cry in the shower
---
I mean staying on separate gens and forcing to killer to only apply pressure on 1 survivor/have very long patrol routes is the most optimal way to play, yeah.
---
Nobody else would see it cuz you'd have to subscribe to it, but would be cool.
---
But unlike old DS, there's actual counterplay here. Survivors seem like they just don't want to do it.
---
If I got facecamped by a dog, I honestly wouldn't mind.
---
i would continue watching if i were you, its get pretty damn interesting.
---
Oh yeah I knew that, thanks
---
thats like waiting the students to beg the teacher to teach them.....Its the Job of the elders to Pass on their knowledge(Sounds actually pretty serious lol)
---
There was counterplay to old DS as well. Slugging.
---
Cleansing dull totems is not an objective. Killing survivors or doing gens are an objective.
---
in terms of being a scary killer i think hes quite attractive his face looks like its made of wood just like how he treats his survivors
---
how do you not know if you‚Äôre in this sub reddit
---
GG EZ FLOOFY KILLER
---
you right. although i still gotta stick with the og trapper.
---
I think you're mixing me with someone else. I have not done Distortion and this is the first series of my pack I've uploaded. Still nice feedback tho
---
At what price point?   They are already gouging price for the cosmetics they have.
---
Yeah, that would be cool
---
Doing the main survivor objective well, the horror!
---
I call my build, the gen jockey chicken build. I run spinechill, self heal, alert, and technician.
---
Mercy? As if you deserve to escape? And ypu don't win until the game is over. Just because the last gen is done doesn't mean the game is over.
---
You know. Its hard to argue balence with someone who I can only assume is a low rank maybe never even attempted killer. Dunno maybe your a esport dbd leet player with 10k hours and full legacy loadouts. You could be a dev idk.
---
So I wont. Ask Marth, tydetime, tru see what they say. Tyde will most likely full debate you but honestly dont know his thoughts on the matter.
---
I actually really appreciate the devs do this, this is an unusual amount of dev communication.
---
FLOOFY BEBE KILLER
---
Woops, we found the commie
---
I‚Äôve come across more and more friendly post match chats than ever before in these last months 
---
Still get your ochido wannabes tho
---
Sorry man, I thought this was all the same guy. That completely justifies the difference in style. I'd like to see more from you! I'm not trying to be nit-picky but it's just my view on it.
---
Why not?
---
Phantom of the opera incoming?
---
It's been a while since I've played. I've noticed however that because you no longer lose -2 pips from disconnecting, many people are abusing this system to preserve their ranks. Will this be addressed in the future?
---
No one dislikes dead by daylight more than people who play dead by daylight.
---
Crouching in the corner for 3 minutes despite hearing no heartbeat like at least 2 teammates in every single team I get, smh.
---
you could just get it from the shrine but eh do what you want
---
It was a joke because it has has a lot of neck and forth lately. 
---
It tries to match similar ranks together whenever possible, but things like SWF at different ranks, wait times, and overall disproportion of people per tier (purple, red, etc.) make it difficult.
---
Basic enough. The problem I see is that emotes are just used for BM'ing. Too many people enjoying SWF anyway.
---
what an idiot
---
It could be like animated emojis in end game chat or displayed next to you‚Äôre rank, doesn‚Äôt have to be an animation for the character
---
Am I the only person that went pretty far right? This community is one of the most personable gaming communities on reddit. I can actually joke with you people. I can post legitimate criticisms here without getting harassed by some no-life gatekeeper telling me to kill my self. We have a tag for shitposts! We meme like crazy here. I love this community.
---
I think the simpler solution would be to just brighten all of her outfits a bit.  I don‚Äôt know what fucking genius decided ‚Äúlet‚Äôs give the shortest, darkest, and quietest character in the game a pitch-black ninja costume‚Äù, but once they‚Äôve been forcibly lobotomized (assuming they had a brain in the first place) and never allowed to make decisions on costume design ever again, brightening all of her existing brown and black costumes to tan and grey should alleviate most of the problems inherent in Claudette being an overpowered fucking bitch.
---
A tad bit too strong imo. The token system is by far one of the better ways to balance perks like this don't get me wrong, but when used by high mobility killers, that now need to worry a lot less about kicking a gen, they can instead cause pressure on survivors and kick a gen when they feel like it and this seems really problematic in my eyes since the time is the only thing keeping it from being godly on high mobility killers. Not to forget going for intentional 3 gen strats can be made somewhat easier with this.
---
Could you not take the time to atleast get rid of the little account tag mark in the corner? Like if you are gonna steal memes from Instagram, atleast be patient enough to wait for it to fade out :/
---
Flattered
---
The new cucked you. Run what you want.
---
Actually I didn‚Äôt even crop it, once again I found it on a Facebook in a group I‚Äôm in.
---
Yeah, completely up to the killer in that situation.
---
Left thumbstick goes clock wise + Right thumbstick goes left
---
Left thumbstick goes counter-clockwise + right thumbstick goes right
---
Also new decisive fits the text pretty well
---
It's fine. I got downvoted for calling out someone who complaining about omega nurse withebony mori is unbalanced compared to swf, when that literally requires two ultra rare items to even use that build.
---
It looks handmade. I have one handmade but it‚Äôs GIR from invader zim
---
On a scale from "displeasing" to "hearty"?
---
I'm a little confused by this.  I'm a killer main, and I'd say I get people loading in after like, 15-60 seconds.  This isn't slow or ultra fast, but I also feel like the survivors I get matched with are inconsistently the right rank for me.  Sometimes all the survivors are 3 ranks ahead of me, sometimes they're 3 ranks behind me.  Usually it's pretty good, but from my end I'm not seeing the overwhelming abundance of survivors.
---
I am one with the force, the force is with me.
---
I honestly only experienced fps issues during that bug where it dipped when u opened the store tbh. I mean its not amazing FPS but it doesnt make it as unplayable as some describe it. Though i play on a monitor and have a PS4 Pro
---
No one believes it cause it's didn't happen bungo
---
Drops pallet on killer as Dwight dressed in a hotdog suit*
---
Dabs*
---
PC ingame bug.  
---
I was playing as plague when this happened. Infected a survivor fuly for the first time and I got the Sloppy Butcher effects for some reason, AS KILLER btw.
---
You can easily add an algorithm to stop that though. I don't know how to, and looking at the spaghetti code... I don't think they could.
---
Many people probably have let me tell you, i alone had a disqushion about it on a stream no less with a few people. We ended up agreeing this perk needs some form of penalty or else it becomes too godly with certain killers/playstyles. Also due to people coming to this logical conclusion many perk "ideas" are never spoken.
---
I would love a download like, the gold icons would look good as hell with legacy! (Or the feng cosmetics I won‚Äôt spend 1000 bucks on)
---
It should be a cone effect like premonition
---
Exactly my thinking
---
I also played on a monitor and PS4 pro. FPS was generally fine (except some of the maps) but there is definitely lag whenever you blink as well as swing.
---
That's some S tier skill there buddy
---
Was expecting him to start default dancing right at the end
---
Damnit
---
Honestly just refusing messages from non friends made the game 1000x more enjoyable
---
No good.
---
looks hella cool! whered you get the perk template if you don't mind me asking?
---
It's a sad community but some of us are nice
---
It's a pretty common demographic question for market research. You'd also be surprised how many theater professionals and enthusiasts love horror.
---
I mean terror as in not wanting to get killed. It ruins the mind game aspect of the game. Survivors should be scrambling to find totems that have already been completed. I don‚Äôt think survivors should ever be on the same page. It should be a confusing game where you have to choose between looking for totems or hope that your team has done them
---
Just started playing the game last night and can only find survivor lobbies. Haven‚Äôt been able to play as killer yet. Is this common?
---
the maps have always been the biggest issue of game-balance, ever.
---
Not perks. Not items. Not mist. Not "genrush". Maps.
---
You must not know 'bout me.
---
Hell yes.
---
I play on PC so I had to look up what Avoid Me was.
---
That's seriously fucked.  If I were the devs I'd take one look at that and make the killer anonymous unless they chose to reveal themselves post game.  There is nothing cool about this happening.
---
The only thing I would like to add from the survey is that I don't want to use a try hard build but I have been forced to when I'm getting camped and then tunneled when I do get saved. I would rather use a different perk then DS or BT, I just want a fun build. But it feels like PS4 all the killers the last few days are just camp, tunnel, rinse repeat. 
---
To be fair being killer can be hard (when I'm killer I miss ALOT of my hits) but I feel like these killers can't be making much in the points or ranking up very well.
---
It could effect cosmetics and future killer/survivor ideas and bios. If they have a bunch of people who like the opera they might put in cosmetics for lesser known operas.
---
If everyone thinks I'm misspelling Oprah when I type opera they probably won't do that.
---
Same with the other questions. Tons of sports fans? Maybe make something sports related, or possibly look into cutting deals with relevant teams. Lots of people think hockey involves throwing a ball at a circle protruding from a wall and you can't use your hands? Maybe not.
---
I think that‚Äôs a great number! It means that 75% of bonus content can be earned for free. I‚Äôm fine with that amount honestly, even tho some would complain about it.
---
PRIEST WRATH GUYS , RING THE BELLS , CHURCH IS COMING
---
These really fit Nea. I would love to see how you do Laurie‚Äôs!
---
I mean doesn't it depend on the "bonus and rewards"?
---
like if it's skins or free chapters i don't see the problem.
---
They are in the game files
---
Yes, Leatherface by a mile
---
It‚Äôs like they expect survivors to walk around the map and look at the decor.
---
I‚Äôm mad at the idea because we all saw how this worked with Fortnite, people would make fun of others because they couldn‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt want to buy an overpriced battle pass to work their ass of to get shitty cosmetics. I‚Äôm tired of this shitty trend and all the games that have done it suck except for rocket league and even then it kinda sucked the fun out of it.
---
While I'm pretty sure that post is a joke, I don't entirely disagree. I find the pallet/looping mechanics to be infuriating as a killer, and a driving force as to why I've been playing a lot of Nurse recently even though I don't really like her as a killer. It's worth it to not have to deal with that nonsense.
---
Majority of them are just copies of hillbillys
---
I was just mathemetizing to pass the time, was also gonna add prices but the current sale would throw things off
---
Really, I feel like his pink addons do more than Pigs /s
---
After care sprint burst bond and prove thyself
---
I was just looking at the forums and one of the devs said it starts 00:00 UTC Thursday night. So 8:00pm EST Thursday. Which is when they used to start but it‚Äôs been a while since they did it that way, so it‚Äôs weird. And is technically May 3rd at that point for most people.
---
Nobody deserves to escape, some people just let them.  I let survivors escape sometimes just because I'm not going for kills, I'm going for trophies or dailies. Other times, I just kill the annoying ones. And yes, you're right, games done when you escape, not when Gens are done. Some people just have that "I got this win in the bag" sort of mindset
---
Claudette: 1080 cells (400/each)

I remember when I first got her I started to regret the decision because she was so hard. I just kept playing and now she‚Äôs basically the only killer I play. Sound is very important; my strategy is to only phase walk for scouting gens and to finish a chase with someone who has already been hit. It‚Äôs not too smart to use if they haven‚Äôt been injured yet and the chase has just begun, as you can‚Äôt hear their groaning. Faster recovery add-ons are perfect for when you are learning how to use her. Remember, she is a Hard killer, so don‚Äôt give up!
---
People really be out here using rocket league as an example of a good game lul
---
1440x1080 you can simply change this in the gamefiles
---
True, so both Pig and LF their addons suck? We agree on that?
---
I see I've met my opposite.  
---
As someone who used to play a whole lot of TF2, I was rarely ever impressed by the community's contributions to the roster of cosmetics, skins or emotes/taunts.  
---
I would love to hear your reasoning and opinions, OP. I'd like to better understand the other side of the argument.
---
I actually think every single one is a copy of Billy's.  I cannot think of single unique one
---
agreed
---
Most killers don't like being run around the infinite loop in the strode house.
---
I put it to the right as well. We can all agree that the in game community leaves a lot to be desired, but the community outside of the game is pretty great. I've made actual real friends because of this game and I've only been playing a few months. The Twitch community is incredibly generous with gift subs and general support. There are far worse communities out there
---
Yay!
---
Yes they are comfy but a bit small
---
Piggy definitely has the worst add-ons in my opinion
---
Oh really? I seriously thought I used my skill to juke her. Why so negative.
---
I‚Äôd also like some voice lines in game, even if they are only client side so that the killer can‚Äôt hear them.
---
they cant fix it if no one is playing on PS4
---
Did they ever state that they would fix him or acknowledge that he needed a fix? I definitely want one. Just curious if they ever mentioned it
---
Every time I decide to play Huntress, someone pops out a Haddonfield offering.... so I never actually play Huntress ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A cosmetic system would be nice, as long as it isn't time gated (like a battle pass) and doesn't come until after the core issues with the game are dealt with.
---
I find battle passes to be more irritating than fun because it essentially forces you to play during a certain time period if there's something you want from it rather than playing the game for fun.
---
What is bad about it?
---
Now it all makes sense!

Source: Peanits posted this on the forums today.
---
You‚Äôre speaking gibberish now.
---
A: Yeah? That's still half of the cast. B: It is almost always true, and I will admit Ash being the only licensed killer with cosmetics hurts my argument, but doesn't invalidate it, and again, if you want to rely on the shrine to get Licensed killer perks, that's laughable. We finally got BBQ after 2 years a few weeks ago.
---
There still is no real difference between buying LF for BBQ &amp; having a flat 1.25x BP multiplier on games, the only difference is the means, one is a perk, one is a season pass, both require you to pay.
---
Sorry buddy, only some people are able to get that munnyyyy. If you can‚Äôt play the game then go home. You gotta be fkn rrrrruthless if you wanna be the killer.
---
I mean this is just gauging public opinion, i highly doubt we'll see either of these anytime soon.
---
The cosmetic one might have a higher chance tho as BHVR know the community is 10x more creative then them and they love money so much they'd leap at the opportunity to make more.
---
Dead by Dancing

If ur sorry then credit him smh
---
hard disagree. 
---
I never run it, and do mostly ok for my games. 
---
If you want to run hexes, you can.
---
If you don't want to you don't have to, you just have to play more brutally and efficiently.
---
It's 100% a sarcastic post, he lists all the trigger words that will cause fighting.
---
Cake time
---
I already did...?
---
dedicated servers are worse than the current ones, and bug patches will come overtime as they introduce new maps/killers/survivors etc.
---
Othersise, I agree with what you‚Äôre saying generally
---
Where?
---
Look through the comments dude
---
he gets this creepy af outfit in the mid-chapter
---
Oh God it's strong with these new totem locations
---
It's hard to settle on any one build, but the one I use the most often is lightweight, urban evasion, spine chill and wake up.
---
Kate has always been a tasty snack. She is waifu!

To be fair you could 4K with Claudette at that rank.
---
Huh? What outfit? Did i miss somethingthe devs said they would add?
---
Or dont camp.. nothing I can do with a camping Billy and bubba.. just trading places or we all go down. .. I save all the time against camping killers. Had a clown DC because I saved without borrowed time but my mom activated and he was shook by it haha.

I DC no matter what map or killer because I'm so quirky haha counterplay? What's that?

‚ÄúCore issues of the game‚Äù, hitboxes? Servers? Bugs? Idk what you mean, but most of those things will come overtime. And I would enjoy timed rewards for the purpose of introducing new cosmetics regularly, keeping the game alive.
---
one or the other, I think?
---
The community skins seem like a great idea to get some creative talent out there, but the emotes personally wouldn‚Äôt fit with the serious tone of DBD.
---
NOED IS A GOOD USABLE PERK. IT PROVIDES ENDGAME STRATEGIES FOR KILLERS WHO HAVE NO GEN PRESSURE (LIKE FREDDY). DOWNVOTE ME TO OBLIVION, BUT I PREFER TO PLAY FREDDY WITH NOED
---
yep you missed it. it should be easy to find in their recent Tweets
---
You have more faith in this community's untapped creative potential than I do.
---
For a game that's been out for a considerable amount of time, both in early access and full release, has microtransactions, has insane amounts of DLC and rarely releasing free content, is out on 3 different platforms with a 4th one coming up soon and potentially mobile phones, tournaments, etc., you expect the game to be functional before they add in more microtransactions.
---
That Spirit really tunneled me hard. All I did was drop pallets on her face and loop the shack to near perfection because of her messed up Wraith forms. Good times
---
holy shit you're a genius lmao
---
Bro he is only rank 18.  They're trash still and haven't learned how to play the game yet.  All killers camp at that rank.
---
It's always worth trying ya never know how it will go... I hate playing on a lot of maps as killer but I get the job done.
---
Shit, ill go look.
---
You said it!!
---
IMO the response shouldn't be about the subreddit, at all. It's a third party community hub, that has nothing to do with the game itself. It should just be about meeting players in game. 
---
Either way, I was slightly more positive than not. But then again I disagree with a LOT of accusations of toxicity, even when I would never engage in such behaviour myself. I just laugh at teabagging - it's kinda funny. I hate face camping, but I just move on and assume they weren't a very good player, or were just desperate for a kill for some reason. 
---
There have only been a COUPLE of times where I've felt bullied as a killer by a SWF group. Other than that, there are annoying players but I wouldn't gripe too much about it. That's just online gaming.
---
Honestly I wouldn't prefer it even knowing that many games get away with it. It's nice knowing that seeing a survivor with a loaded perk deck must have earned it by playing the game for a hot minute. I suppose its elitism at work but I don't want to see other players running around having all the good stuff I have in only a fraction of the time I played by being more willing to drop money dollars than I would.
---
He looks so ugly in the new outfit they're gonna release lmao.
---
Oh right, the puppet one, its cool but people like the doctor or meg get new cosmetics every 15 minutes it seems
---
Well yeah, that‚Äôs the point of the survey, it‚Äôs nice to know they have it in mind tho
---
Battle Passes don't belong in a paid game.
---
Idk, DBD isn‚Äôt really serious
---
BHVR, YOU BETTER NOT GET RID OF FREDDY'S BUILT-IN STALL AND AURA-READING WHEN FIXING FREDDY!!!
---
ALSO, THEY SHOULD BE FUCKING *ASHAMED* OF HOW LONG IT'S TAKEN FOR THEM TO FIX HIM. A FUCKING YEAR AND A HALF, MEANWHILE NEWER KILLERS ARE GETTING FIXED WITHIN A FEW *WEEKS* OR *MONTHS* OF THEM GETTING RELEASED.
---
Yea, a Battlepass for a Free-2-Play game is fine and nearly expected at this point. Everyone understands BHVR needs to make money but be reasonable.
---
Dead by Daylight is a $20 game with nearly $70 in content DLC. It's closer to $90 if you include the cosmetics packs. Plus of course in-game cosmetic spending. We've been waiting years for some type of ranked reward or anything to encourage people to play constantly and remain in red ranks.
---
If they release a battlepass, we can kiss that goodbye. 
---
So OP needs to get the fuck out of here with stupid strawman arguments. Nearly everyone understands BHVR needs to make money with cosmetics, just because you found a single dumb comment or two doesn't mean suddenly everyone wants BHVR to work for free.
---
I've just been running Small Game so I can destroy all the totems.  I enjoy seeing killers not get their NOED when the gens are all done.  And it also takes care of Ruin too, since everyone seems to run that these days.
---
exactly
---
LEGION MAY SUCK AT KLLING AND AS AN ACTUAL STORY KILLER, BUT GODDAMMIT I ENJOY PLAYING AS HIM, YA'LL NEED TO STOP ROASTING KILLERS WHO JUST WANNA FUCK AROUND! I LIKE THE WHOOSHY WHOOSH WHEN HE RUNS AND I LIKE BEING ABLE TO VAULT AS KILLER, SO JUST LET ME BE A LEGION MAIN DAMMIT
---
New extreme types of BM incomming... you think t-bagging after a pallet stun is bad? Nodding while facecamping? Just you w8...
---
Oh it was unclear since you cant see it lol, nice.
---
How many games do you play where sabotage is actually a thing, though?
---
Now how many of those games is sabo actually a threat, versus just one moron with a brown toolbox screwing over his team by not doing gens, just so he can get some 20k ritual rather than rerolling it, because he can't do math?
---
tbh true. Equip Lightborn or Franklin's for ez game.
---
Freddy is the only acceptable killer to run noed. Everyone agrees with this. But we all know hes gonna run it so cleanse cleanse.
---
*opens wallet*
---
Your observation skills are astounding. Thanks.
---
This would have been great when the hatch standoff was still a thing (but when killers are able to close the hatch‚Ä¶ dancing kinda lost its appeal‚Ä¶ I guess you can dance at the exit if anything)
---
I agree. I just care about a teammate position is if he's close to me. I don't care if he's injured and running away from the killer a mile away.
---
Like Pig. Then being toxic may get you really screwed.
---
I agree with the not getting everything too fast part. Needing to do some amount of farming or grinding to get stuff is fine, but in this game its just too much. Especially since you cant try it out. What i really would like for example is making the Tier 1 of the Perk available for everyone as soon as you unlock it and just having Tier 2 and 3 in the Bloodweb. That way i can try out if i like the perk and want to invest more time/resources into getting it.
---
IS THIS E-Z MODE? IS THIS E-Z MODE? IS THIS E-Z MODE? IS THIS E-Z MODE? IS THIS E-Z MODE? IS THIS E-Z MODE? IS THIS E-Z MODE?

I‚Äôm loving these, but can we pleeeeaaaase get some Feng cosmetics soon. Feels like she‚Äôs barely gotten anything
---
Actually from my point of view, I‚Äôm the most likeable guy in the sub and I have plenty o‚Äô friends.
---
I already did. I‚Äôm done with the 30 minute routine
---
1.	Loads game, 2 survivors
---
2.	loads game, disconnected from host
---
3.	loads game, game freezes during loading
---
4.	loads game, 3 survivors
---
5.	loads game, 2 survivors
---
6.	loads game, Legion, everyone DC‚Äôs
---
7.	loads game, disconnected from host
---
8.	repeat
---
9.	repeat
---
10. Repeat
---
Plague has a couple good ones and a lot of bullshit
---
lmao okay guy calm down
---
They never said the Legion change was a rework. They said it was a update/change, but they specified that Freddy is getting reworked
---
you can do it whenever really, like say a survivor misses a skill check, just dance on their dumbass
---
u ok hun?
---
Question: How much does it take you to make these?
---
It didn't. I don't know how to counter survivors looping pallet routes. I know if I stop to break a pallet or leave the survivor I'm screwed.
---
All of them look great!!! Kate looks kinda weird imo though, anyone else?
---
Lol I hope you enjoy being facecamped.  Seriously I don't know if anyone has noticed this but literally everytime I look up a profile that says they are from Brazil they play like absolute filth.  Over the years I'd say my sample size is about 60 or 70 games or so and they have played like absolute filth everytime.  Very odd regional thing I noticed.  Anyone else experienced this?
---
F I N G E R G U N S
---
Console should be the only platform that can play with each other. It would be unfair for purple rank console killers to have to play against 360ers on PC or console survivors having to play against PC nurses
---
All of the above and they should be the priority over cosmetics and new content.
---
They can introduce new cosmetics regularly without saying "you have a few weeks to earn or buy this and then it's gone forever". If anything having a battlepass will lower the amount of available cosmetics in the long run.
---
Not the first one because it could make gameplay look weird to have a fucking dwight DANCE
---
The thing is I switch to killer and almost instantly get a full lobby
---
Doc and Hag look cool
---
Claudette and Kate look like hookers
---
Jeff is meh
---
Why do people act like it's completely irrational to not want to spend 60 seconds- almost a whole sixth gen- cleansing five totems, just on the offchance the killer is running NOED? Against a decent killer, that 60 seconds is better than Ruin and Pop Goes the Weasel, and can easily mean death.
---
I get you put alot of effort into this edit but It'd take away from the way the game's supposed to be played, four strangers with four different playstyles that could help or hurt their teammates, with the ability to see the other's perks pregame the builds would stack and people would know who's going to be doing all the looping, it'd basically just be swf but with randoms. plus people might use perks like left behind or sole survivor and it'd make other salty players not save them, and people would be upset knowing another player put up a game offering.
---
I'M SO FUCKING SICK OF SWF HAVING COMMS. I'M SO TIRED OF SURVIVORS THINKING THEY ARE ACTUALLY GOOD AND TEABAGGING AT THE GATES BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY GOT SKILLZ TO PAY THE BILLS, LIKE THEY DIDNT HAVE THEIR FUCKING FRIENDS TELLING THEM WHERE I AM, WHERE THE TOTEMS ARE, WHEN ITS OK TO UNHOOK, IF THEY SHOULD USE SABO TOOLBOXES JUST TO BE TROLLFAGS. I'M FUCKING SICK OF IT. THE GAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE 1 KILLER VS. 4 SOLO RANDOM SURVIVORS, NOT SURVIVORS THAT ARE FUCKING "TELEPATHIC"!!! THAT SHIT ISN'T FUCKING FUN. I MAY AS WELL JUST TUNNEL, SLUG, AND MORI EVERYONE OF THESE MOTHERFUCKING SURVIVORS BECAUSE I'M GONNA GET FLAMING DOGSHIT HATEMAIL NO MATTER WHAT I FUCKING DO. 
---
FUCK SWF TEAMS AND THEIR COMMS. AT LEAST MAKING A FUCKING RANKED OPTION MAKES IT SO IT'S ONLY RANDOM SOLO SURVIVORS BECAUSE I HAVE HAD IT UP TO MY FUCKING EYEBALLS WITH THESE ASSHOLE SWF TEAMS TROLLING ME LIKE THEY THINK THEY ARE GOOD. THERE ARE LESS AND LESS KILLERS BECAUSE OF THIS SHIT AND SURVS WANNA COMPLAIN ABOUT WAIT TIMES IN QUEUE BUT THEIR BULLSHIT BEHAVIOR IS WHATS CAUSING THIS FUCKING PROBLEM. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
---
Funnily enough, a dev made a joke about the survey question in a thread announcing the Gold and Silk skin collection release. Lots of opera themed skins have been unveiled recently, like the Tragic Love Opera collection with Wraith and Nurse for instance. 
---
The question on whether or not they make more relies on the survey.
---
Yeah, like what if you had a bite nails emote like he does in the loading screen, like not dancing just simple shit
---
i cleaned my glasses twice before i realized that was not in english :(
---
I‚Äôd rather go to another generator instead (if I know the killer isn‚Äôt in chase, that skill fail is sure to bring them there)
---
Well you shouldn‚Äôt be doing gens together anyway to be fair
---
Well you‚Äôre lucky I‚Äôm from aus and the wait times suck ass
---
That would be an Ace emote
---
Leveling with me consists of admitting the vast majority of people who buy LF have absolutely no interest in playing him, and are buying him solely for his perks.
---
I don't know why that would be considered cheating. It is just a different resolution then 16:9
---
I like to think they dont do it because of a thing called bystander apathy(highly suggest looking this up. It kinda makes you lose faith in humanity and hipefully encourages people aware of it to take charge. It also applies to why a group of solos wont go for hook saves). They just assume someone else will deal with the responsibility of breaking dull totems or they are decent enough to deal with the problem later. I mean why brk totems if you can tell all the 4perks the killer is running? Or if your team is getting slaughtered and you know it will be a hatch game. 
---
They do need a 2nd objective but totems aight it chief. There is very little effort in breaking a dull totem, no skill checks, barely an inconvenience. If they ignore totems but cry about noed its on them.
---
Cousin Trapper, but you can call me Crapper.
---
Mmmmm... no, dont quite agree with you there. Suiciding on the hook is a strat... but DC'ing in that case is garbage.
---
That risk is a part of this game. If you don't want to perform the counter, don't whine when you get hit by NOED. You don't get to keep your cake and eat it too.
---
And 4 ENTITLED Survivors
---
It literalky tells you that you lose all your items, addons, offerings, and perks. Your fault for losing that if you didn‚Äôt want to lose your time getting BP onto character
---
It is the same why everybody was playing Fortnite in 4:3. The game is not stretched in the width but in the height so you can actually see more.
---
Hex: No One Escapes Stupidity
---
Killer disconnects ruin the game for four people who have probably had to queue for ten + minutes to get a game (if playing console at least) - that is the ultimate act of toxicity in this whole game and happens fairly often, sometimes even if there‚Äôs an offering they don‚Äôt fancy
---
I play both sides and agree that both can clearly be toxic but nothing fucks me off more than a killer DC
---
Yes but why
---
Pretty much. It‚Äôs also to show off you‚Äôre toxic if you‚Äôre a p3 Nea or Mig
---
Test
---
So..  think hard about it will you...  if you wait as a survivor and you dont wait as a killer who has more players playing??  obviously survivors..   How long is your typical game let's just say 10mins (but could be way longer).  So if there are limited amount of killers (and most only play their dailies and move on) and lots of survivors the wait is going to be at least 10mins per game and then survivors are also broken down into 4 man teams both SWF, trios and duos and solos..  so basically there is always a longer wait for survivors...
---
I don't know why you're being downvoted for that. I really enjoy playing Apex Legends as well
---
Yes,no,begone thot and I don‚Äôt know about that one chief
---
Maybe just rank rewards instead?
---
i personally would like it if you could buy all characters at once for a discount i would love that it would be great for new players
---
#metoo
---
I'm calm lmao. Never was I not calm while typing any of this lmao. XD still needs to fuck off to 05, my opinion stands on that.
---
Ik and I got tunneled and moried afterwards to
---
I don‚Äôt know, my friend plays dbd on controller on PC and he does just fine. Maybe just at high rank there is separation or maybe an option to disable it would be good too, though.
---
Not all of them. Had a few nurses that gave me a glimpse of what they must deal with on PC. Was not fun
---
He's very fun, going from Survivor to Survivor and whittling through them.  Honestly I'm just praying they don't turn him into a soulless chase killer like Clown &lt;_&lt;
---
IM FUCKING TIRED OF DYING TO BAD HITBOXES AND LAGSWITCHERS IT REALLY TILTS ME AAAAAAAAAAAAAAS1203891203218S21ZDASDCGAS
---
I like Hangman's trick. I just wish Sabotage was more viable so I would have more of a reason to run it
---
Did you read what he said or what
---
I didn‚Äôt mean to drop the pallet so early it was just a dumb mistake I did cause he was usually disrespecting pallets that game and I thought he was gonna swing right thru but either way I could of ran and he would of missed
---
O shit
---
No, I just don't believe you :\
---
the clown is good hes a solid m1 killer being able to catch up to people faster than most killers is pretty helpful
---
Ik maybe its how toxic my character is i am p3 claudette so I kinda expected to jumped by killer mains.
---
r/funnyandsad
---
Once dedicated servers are up and running they'll have more info of what caused the disconnects. If they do it right they should never wrongly punish legit ones.
---
https://youtu.be/_fcS1pnC3Pc
---
No one said it was impossible. It‚Äôs just way harder if you‚Äôre not Now Legion or Nurse to play against 4 mans
---
To preface, I think that it allowed me to place more traps in a more concentrated area, and forced the survivors into that area. This allowed me to snowball by getting easier hits. 
---
However, I don‚Äôt know if this will work consistently, so I‚Äôll be testing it out more. I‚Äôm looking for alternatives to Ruin since it‚Äôs broken within the first minute 50% of the time.
---
If anyone is interested in high rank Hag gameplay, I‚Äôm going to start uploading plenty of videos to my channel. :)
---
You‚Äôd be stupid to leave that hook, with the gates open there is quite literally nothing else left to defend other than that sacrifice
---
If the gates are open and you got a hook you got nothing else to do but camp.
---
Thanks for proving my point
---
If you are a killer them the lobby is gonna be almost instantaneous. If you are a survivors then yes, expect wait times. This is because, due to swf teams toxic bullshit, killers will either: A) Become √ºber toxic(tunneling, facecamping, etc), B) Killers will just switch to being survivor almost 24/7, or C) they will just drank to oblivion to avoid SWF trollfags (which even this is temporary because now swf are starting to do it too) 
---
You can downvote this to the abyss, but I'm a killer main and even I'm starting to play survivor more because it's less annoying/stress inducing and I FUCKING LOVE PLAYING KILLER.
---
What do you mean? I just see a wall from Haddonfield, could you post a picture with the Claudette outfit?
---
Woops found the fascist
---
IT IS NOT TUNNELING IF YOU GET UNHOOKED AND THEN PROCEED TO GET CAUGHT IN THE MOST COMMON TRAP SPOT ON DISTURBED WARD, DAVID
---
Respect for the work. I have two questions.
---
1. Do you recolor just the perks or do you want to recolor addons etc. asswell.
---
2. Will you do a public pack of it?
---
I really have to say that these perks are very well done. I recolored nearly everything on my own and it took me a month to do everything but it's way not as pretty as yours. So keep going nice work\^\^.
---
Cheers
---
It‚Äôs annoying because he says camping is skillful and that the survivors new to adapt to it? Bitch no one can adapt to it once they go down they just get camped and can‚Äôt do anything for the rest of the game
---
Baa baaaaaaaaa sheep
---
or just edit claudettes lighting yo be like adams... slight edits to the problematic things on her.
---
Fair point. I'll agree that far too many people are concerned with rank rather than fun. Some streamers especially.  
---
However, even if they were to implement community-made cosmetics, chances of those cosmetics being for any licensed characters are extremely slim. The developers would need to alter the contract/agreement they've made with the copyright owners, which would not only be pricey, but also potentially risky.
---
Pig has the worst add ons in the game by far, hell even her iridescent add ons aren't that good. Imo her only good add ons are combat straps, video tape, last will, crate of gears and tampered timer. The rest are crap or decent
---
Depending on your rank and region as well as time, finding lobbies as a new killer is a bit rough. Your first l games may not be balanced too as a result.
---
i took it seriously ofc because i dont rat on this game as much as other people as it seems like
---
Yes you‚Äôre a sheep that follows the majority üëè
---
&gt;I feel bad for Huntress mains especially because every map released so far has had random clutter in the way blocking all of your hatchets
---
This is honestly the most frustrating thing for me. With every map release Huntress slips lower and lower down the tier list. If the trend continues there'll honestly be little point in playing her without offerings. Even the dedicated Huntress mains are starting to play other killers because of it.
---
You camp them in the basement either that or your whole build is based around your failure
---
i think the happy death day killer has a even higher chance of being a legion skin tbh
---
Console master race? ^^^/s
---
Oof. Feelsbad
---
It isnt if its not inside the match.
---
I agree mostly with that, but those corn fields are just straight up unenjoyable - seriously feel like I need to pop a paracetamol every time I try looking for survivors in them
---
object of obsession time
---
IM A RANK 20 KILLER AND I CANT FUCKING RANK UP CUZ RANK 20 SURVIVORS DONT EXIST
---
Can‚Äôt wait for them to ask for money on stolen dances
---
YES I WILL HANG HERE AND GET MY STRUGGLE BP'S NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU HIT ME.
---
They don't drop as far because we're already only getting 15-20 fps. Can't lose 40 frames if you didn't have them to begin with.
---
Gens were done. I opened the exit door and rushed for the save.
---
Thanks! Seeing this movie in theater as a kid is a great memory for me!
---
I agree there's already a divide and I think this will increase it. I don't think new players are going to hop in and immediately buy a battlepass like everyone seems to think. A lot more things seem like they would be more enticing to new players, such as DLC characters with good perks like LF. The main people who buy the Battlepass will probably be seasoned veterans who want the outfits or whatever else is included and use the bloodpoint boost to get a bunch of pink items or whatever. I just fear this will accelerate the growth of those who are already far enough into the game where you already know you like the game enough to buy optional content and not the newer player. The semi new battle pass players (assuming they buy it to make the grind lesser) would soon have an advantage over newer non Battlepass players and the divide could turn off some newer players. None of it really impacts me personally since I have all the perks on one survivor but I just don't like it as a concept for this game personally. I don't think it will be healthy and it's clearly already a hot topic in the community after they simply mentioned the idea in a survey.. I just see more bad than good coming from it in my opinion. A straight bloodpoint increase for everyone to lessen the grind I am 1000% behind
---
crows let you track the killer around the map, so it's a free spine chill/premonition. Several perks ofc are specifically made to give information about the killer (bond, empathy, SC, etc) not to mention map knowledge and where you should run to when killer comes from x direction.
---
the point i was trying to make is that the better the survivors get the less information you need to survive. the first 10 hrs I couldn't imagine ever playing without spine chill and now I can't imagine I'd ever needed it. at the higher ranks survivors really start to bully the killer instead of being scared of him
---
This has to be an Aldi or LiDl lmao. Only two places where the cashier scans that fast.
---
Vile
---
Then what do you expect the killer to do if the doors open ? Genuine question what do you think the killer should do ?
---
I'd take the corn any day over haddonfield
---
Speedo Myers

If I hooked the last person I downed, there was a chance I wouldn't reach there in time before the dying on hook animation ended.

Okie dokie then

On topic, I pretty much pitch Coldwind games as a loss, focus on BP and safety pip in those games. I‚Äôll typically just hope for a 4 stack of BBQ if that on coldwind.
---
I mean people loved Ash and Laurie and bill are well liked. But Quentin wasn‚Äôt who people wanted from a NOES chapter. I think if there was a scream dlc people would go hype for Sid.
---
Thank you, it is nice to finally get a little recognition for all that I do.
---
*goes back to animating the game frame by frame in a flip-book as it is faster than waiting for the frame rate to recover in an actual match.
---
I mean you do have the option of trying it out in kyf, even if you don't have friends to play it with you can get a group together on dbd discord/forums.
---
Yea ig so lmfao
---
Clearly shows a problem with the game when certain maps are losses by default :/ good on you for your positivity though
---
I don't want to get into a tierlist war, so I'm not going to comment on killer strengths.  What I'm talking about here, is how it feels to use and face the power.  Right now Freddy's power, for all it's drawbacks, is super fun to use, and (in my opinion) face.  You get the sp00ky singing when awake, and when Freddy pulls you in he phases in and out of reality.  This gives him a fun 7 second mindgame that's super satisfying to pull off, while also feeling like a flavorful addition.
---
Then you have Clown, a killer who just yeets bottles.  They're fun to chuck, but they don't feel particularly rewarding without something like Ether 10% and Flask of Bleach, and as a Survivor he just smudges the screen and occasionally forces an early drop or gets a hit.  Only things *not* boring about him are his aesthetic and demeanor IMO.
---
I really don't mind Haddonfield - maybe it's just the low fps on PS4 problem that makes Coldwind so insufferable for me
---
Yeah its definitely different, its a bigass bright red circle instead of a cone that gets wider and brighter from the killer. But they it could also be the strange resolution + distressing.
---
I wanted voice lines so I can call the killer a wanker as David
---
I've never played as him but I heard hes difficult and takes a lot of time to get into dream world.  BUT PEOPLE RUNNING NOED ON BILLY AND MYERS IS JUST EMBARRASSING
---
Listen play your game man. If you have to camp the last guy to get a kill by all means. If you wanna camp all 4 players go ahead. It's a game and you can play however you want people just have a sense of entitlement about how everyone else should be made to play. Its a game. Just play it and move on.
---
Yes please

I have more fun playing against 4/3 men especially if they are good than random people teams, those are usually really boring because you don't get any challenge/don't even need to think about what you're doing most of the time.
---
I'm probably doing only perks and I have no issues sharing them so once I'm done I'll probably make em public.
---
I CAN'T HEAR LOWERCASE MA'AM
---
XD I love her outfit though
---
extra vertical FOV, you see more things vertically, helps in rare cases but those rare cases can matter in a game
---
Her new torso makes her look like a caveman prostitute.
---
This
---
AGREED, BUT ITS A WASTE OF A PERK SPOT IN MY EYES. ID RATHER NOT GET TO END GAME. INWANT PERKS TO HELP ME THROUGH THE BEGINING AND MIDDLE MORE THAN THE END.
---
this is actually pretty pathetic, i bet the survivor would laugh his ass off if he saw you make a reddit post like this
---
PC survivors don't really have an advantage over console survivors, and sure some PC killers can perform better than their console counterparts but they don't compete with their console counterparts, they compete with survivors. 
---
It would be a shock for console survivors to play against skilled PC Nurses, but from the killer side it wouldn't be very noticeable if you were playing against console or PC survivors.
---
I've been playing since 2017? Right after legacy left. I forget how bad the grind is for new players now.... I cant imagine starting the game at this point. I'd feel so overwhelmed by perk choices and the massive grind even though I get to play a lot for an adult. Cant imagine lol. Definately an issue that does not get enough attention.

WHEN YOU INBOX ME HATEFUL SHIT BECAUSE YOU DIED DON‚ÄôT BE SURPRISED WHEN I RUIN YOUR FAVORITE SHOWS AND MOVIES.
---
I interpreted the question to be about the community as a whole, not just in-game antics. The subreddit can turn into a cesspool of negativity really fast when a few people meme about something they don't like. I don't think they can change much of the way the community interacts but they can encourage more positivity.
---
Ty
---
Um no, I clearly said cosmetics should be cheaper. It's stupid to pay $10 for a a cosmetic for a video game. I can buy a real shirt for that. Hell I got some name brand Jean's at tjmaxx for $10. Lmaooo
---
Ah yes I love seeing their loadout endgame and knowing that NOED was eradicated. We need more NOED destroyers like you. Please help us.
---
I love stealth. It used be soo powerful. And when urban evasion got buffed there was a whole new level of stealthing for me lol. I love evading the killer when he comes to my gen and watching him wonder where I am lol. Most survs dont even bother trying to hide when the killer comes by but it's such a time booster for survs when the killer wastes time looking for you unsuccessfully. 
---
Chasing can also be super fun as its fast paced and full of action. 
---
The combination of the two is what made the game so fun to me as a survivor main.
---
I actually didn‚Äôt get it when I did it as survivor. I did get it as killer when the survivors did it though. It was glitches though.
---
I‚Äôm being silly
---
Yeah I get that perspective too. I want them too just don‚Äôt like getting teleported back to the killer after vaulting haha
---
It's true PC survivors with better framerate would hit more skillchecks, and more greats, but they don't have any more options than console survivors.  The platform does not increase or decrease how well they perform in a chase, or the strategic choices they can make. Maybe PC survivors would very slightly outperform console survivors but as a killer it would be largely negligible.  Some killers can perform much better with a mouse/better framerate but anything a PC survivor could do against a PC Nurse, a console survivor could do just as well.
---
Hes part of them? That's a wildly unfounded ludacris accusation.
---
IF the pass is free, then good. It rewards the player for, well, playing.  
---
HOWEVER, if it's paid, then, wtf, might as well buy the skins with my shards/cells.
---
I could get behind this
---
yeah totally understandable
---
I don‚Äôt camp when the gates are open as killer. As a survivor I don‚Äôt get bent by it though.
---
What's your killer rank?
---
They could have a battle pass reward track be open to everyone and anyone can level it up, but then buying the actual pass unlocks the cosmetic rewards along the way. If you don't buy it then you could still get the bloodpoints and shards in between the cosmetics, they could even put in some free recolors are small amounts of cells.
---
I was playing as Trapper and I did get the trophy because the four survivors went through the hatch. I'm not sure if it's supposed to work that way or if it was glitched at the time.
---
NO FFS
---
IM SAYING PAY TO WIN THE BATTLEPASS
---
PAY TO PROGRESS THE BATTLE PASS THAT YOU COULDNT NORMALLY. Aka cod battlepasses.
---
But yes, getting free stuff is a great way to keep your playerbase from crumbling (monster hunter world)
---
Unless you are in a game held hostage, disconnecting is poor sportsmanship and I look forward to the day bans are issued for it
---
You need to be empathetic at the same time though. Treat others how you would want to be treated unless they treat you bad first is who I play. A fair game is a fair game no one can complain about that when you 4k.
---
post some shit from survivors. the narrative you're trying to create is tiring
---
There‚Äôs not a lot of survivors complaining from what I‚Äôve seen on the forms at least sorry man
---
That makes sense to me, even if i dont really get upset at killers using Ruin. Just out of curiousity, does the Game feel much harder without Ruin?
---
I hate gideon's and lerys. Coldwind is only hard if you are the killer. When it's someone else the corn is nothing. Killers chase me through there and never lose me sometimes.
---
yeah but neither one takes that much skill to use its much more rng based than anything
---
Yeah, hence why I said possibly, but it's still nice to dream :'^)
---
This time is confirmed by the devs.
---
I never camp. But camping at the end of the game is perfectly fine. You're trying to secure a kill or two and I see nothing wrong in that. I don't know why survivors would complain about endgame camping.
---
*stalking intensifies*
---
What's that song tho
---
"based on the selective shit my brother is sending me, survivors never complain!1!"
---
lol okay guy

Calm down, Tru3ta1ent

Phantom of the Opera killer confirmed

55 DOLLARS? This pillow has a massage option incorporated or what? Sooooooo greedy.
---
When one person DC's and you're at 5 generators with Hex: Ruin still up and 2/3 of the survivors were already hooked once, then it just becomes a general waste of time. The amount of BP you get from that point to the end won't be significant and there's just no use. 
---
I never DC, but if the scenario comes up that I just mentioned and I'm one of the survivors that's still in the game, then I will most likely just stop running mid-chase and let myself get hit twice, attempt to escape the hook 3 times, and then not struggle on the 2nd hook stage. 
---
People can complain, but the fact of the matter is, this is a 4v1 game, if one person DC's, then the 3 are at a severe disadvantage and the game just becomes boring (even if I'm playing as killer and someone DCs, I have to either decide to get it over with quickly or just *let* them live so at least they'll get some points. But honestly, I would rather the killer just kill me so I can hurry up and leave.)
---
IMO, Hex: Ruin is *ruining* the game. Killers complain that it's "the only way to stand a chance," but I stopped using it a long time ago and am able to get 2\~4 kills every match on Wraith and Plague, and don't even get me started on Huntress and Nurse. Whenever Ruin pops up,I already have it in my mind that the first person hooked will simply DC. Every ***single*** game past Rank 10 is just Ruin, Ruin, and more Ruin. It's not even fun anymore because it forces you to either run around like a chicken with its head cut off, or to use Small game, which still requires you to run around the entire map because the totem is always the \*last\* totem that you find, for whatever reason, not to mention that it's effectively a waste of a perk slot when it all comes down to it.
---
If Hex: Ruin isn't part of the equation, then people that DC are just sore losers. But in my experience, Ruin is the sole perk that has, for some reason, become "mandatory." I'm really hoping that they're going to do something about it because it changes the tone of the entire game once you see that skill check, and not in a good way.
---
true. it would be easy to disable crouching inside of the gate area
---
So basically the perk Dark Devotion but it can be set on certain objects or left in a certain location
---
Fun is more important than rank. Unless you you enjoy all the disconnections.
---
These types of questions are used in algorithms by research companies to code respondents into types.  I could explain more but me talking about research is boring me.  Lol.
---
to me it feels around the same when i play survivor
---
I have the forms too dude, I haven‚Äôt seen a lot of survivors complain and if they do it isnt as stupid as the killers ideas they propose to ‚Äúfix the game‚Äù
---
did you 4k?
---
They would still be mature it's just to discourage toxic behaviour..
---
I never understood why people get so offended by tbagging. You're playing a game about literally murder and you draw the line at the funny speed crouching.
---
I haven't rubber banded in a while though. My forced dcs have been a handful of times and the infinite loading screen happened to me once. Overall the bugged incidents are like a low 10% of the time for me.
---
Give him some anti corn / grass / wheat ability to go with his background and lore, and finally give some counterplay to trying to hide in fields

lmfao the shit on this very subreddit disproves that nonsense.
---
tactical advantages in a party game PepeLaugh
---
Only one died, but as far as I remember everyone was on their last hook. Dont know if that makes it any better though.
---
Alright so it‚Äôs starting in approx 31 hours
---
sounds great
---
This is quality. Take my gold

When you're an Ace and you kobe because of your glorious luck so you farm yourself denying David and teaching Adam the superior plays.

TO THE CLAUDETTE WHO STAYED IN THE GAME FOR OVER 5 MINUTES AFTER THE REST OF US LEFT TO TEA BAG THAT PERSON LEARNING NURSE, YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT
---
I think he needed the \\s at the end of his post. Heroes dont put \\s at the end. However, when they dont, you get these people thinking they are idiots when the idiots are in fact someone else \*wink wink\*
---
I'd do it just for surprises.
---
Fuckkkk
---
i would say they are both equally good most of the time
---
I've had some success with Flip Flop and Boil Over, but honestly, there are better things to run most of the time.
---
Make examples out of BM big community figures. Those that stream and constantly DC, whine when the killer does something they dont like, and bullies the hell out of any killer they find.
---
The one that comes to mind the most is an angry dude with a pink beard or whatever gimmick he's doing these days
---
*is a dick to someone*
---
"Hey can you not be a dick?"
---
"Wow you would prefer I'm not a dick? ***Life is going to break you***"

Seems very interesting, so sure.
---
I started a few days ago and your question motivated me to spend 5 seconds on google.  BM = Bad Manners.
---
This was at rank 7, just saying... But I can feel you
---
I think most of the credit there goes to your trap placement, tbh. Nice use of antelope traps
---
IF YOU COULD STOP TAKING USELESS HITS WHILE KILLER IS CARING SURVIVOR, WHAT WOULD BE GREAT
---
FUCKING SURVIVORS HELPING THE KILLER MAKES ME FUCKING SICK.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è just trying to post something that people would find funny, not just targeting killers cuz survivors have some dumb ideas too
---
I mean... Yeah? Most people don't stop being dicks when asked nicely
---
Hello?!
---
Of course. I thought it would still be decently fun, it just turned out to be way too situational.
---
When the survivor escapes the chase, the timer goes back to red and starts counting again.
---
Thank you! :D Although I like to think it brought them all into the area allowing me to spread the pain more. :) I want this perk to work so badly! üòÇ
---
i mean why not its their choice
---
Chk his hour..
---
Not at all interested!

Glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one

Lmao oh the rank 20s
---
Yes.
---
DUDE, GTX 1060 BARELY GETS 60FPS AT 1080P. WITH DROPS. THIS GAME HAVE NO OPTIMIZATION ON BOTH PC AND CONSOLES.
---
My problem with it is that it's like a hex perk, gets gone real quick then you're stuck with 3 perks. 
---
My hag is the same as yours, nurses/monitor/butcher with a swing perk slot. Usually I'll either bbq for point farming or Franklin's. 
---
Survivors will kill themselves trying to get a trapped yellow item back.
---
huntress actually benefits from pallets locking survivors into animations is easy hits.
---
if i had to use a pallet perk for her brutal strength. as for bamboozle hag i'll allow it if its body blocker hag.
---
so to see spirit fury huntress and bamboozle hag suprises me.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Well you shouldn't really run enduring and spirit fury on huntress because you shouldn't really drop a whole lit of pallets because that's an inst hit for them.  
---
Hag can just place traps by window vaults so bamboozle isnt needed.. 
---
Now do you get it. Lmaooo
---
Congrats my dude!

Can we PLEASE get new mori animations?

Yaaaas Ms. Hag is living in that gold dress!!
---
Ur gonna get alot more cause rank 20 survivors dont do gens
---
I recently finished my Computer Science studies and would be interested in more details. please elaborate !
---
Where was I a dick to someone?
---
you're making shit up.
---
If the game was always insta downs I dont think people would play survivor as much it wouldn't be fun.
---
Yes people use it in Fortnite to make models appear larger so that they are easier to hit/see, but in DBD you are just giving up precious FOV in a game where it is most important.
---
Oh look guys a killermain getting salty.. who would of thought?
---
There are no set in stone rules in DbD. If you need to camp, camp. Same goes for slugging, tunneling, etc. I play the game how I'd like it to be played against me, so I don't go out of my way to tunnel or camp, but I get it when people do. I don't camp, but if someone is down to 20 seconds left in second hook state, I'm setting up a tent. Everything is situational.
---
I‚ÄôM ACTUALLY SCARED ABOUT THE WHOLE FREDDY REWORK THING, BECAUSE I‚ÄôM JUST STARTING TO MAINING HIM, SO I‚ÄôLL HAVE TO START AGAIN PLAYING HIM ANEW WHEN THE FIXES CONE.
---
Teabagging has been around for all of online gaming and started in shooting games, which incidentally are also about murder. It's also been considered a rude gesture that entire time. I don't understand why survivors pretend as though that isn't the case; I guess that's probably Jendenise's fault.
---
Camping is the wrong idea and is a bad line of play IF you have something else to do. 
---
When the gates are open you likely have nothing else to do. Idk what people don‚Äôt understand about this.
---
What worries me is if they‚Äôre asking these things now it will be a long time before we could actually see them implemented.  A lot of the things they asked were highly requested features for a long time (such as rank rework, daily ritual, leaderbords), and now they‚Äôre just taking a survey to decide which directions to go from here.
---
The tears keep flowing! They just won‚Äôt stop!
---
Gotta get those sweet benevolence üòä
---
Lmaooo okay I'll allow itüòÇü§£
---
I know you are making a joke, but you're actually quite right.
---
It's because PC has better fps than console most of the time. A controller user on PC can do fine because of 60 fps, but console players on this sub don't get good fps (i see them complain about it almost all the time)
---
This is an easy way to semi-fix it:
---
Don't have chrome open whilst loading in, on my old laptop over a year ago, I didn't load into about half of my rounds, then I started closing chrome and it worked. its all chromes fault.
---
Jebaited
---
4 survs t-bagging at the exit gate while waving at you and blinding you with a flashlight...sounds nice
---
you forgot to add the 2-4 killers glitch!
---
True, there's not much to talk about it.
---
When you're getting into purple ranks the SWFs are way more boring to vs. At first you're like "sure i'll accept the challenge." that moment you get against the lot of 3 or 4 men in purple ranks you're like "are you kidding me, do i have to play this?"
---
sometimes the 1st scenario can merge into the 2nd
---
With the "Gold and Silk Collection" just announced today...Phantom of the Opera killer? /s
---
So it doesn't even start on the 2nd for most of the world :/
---
You got a 3k!! Love it live it.
---
Yeah bro, survivors are def just giving me a free hit when they wait at a door for me so they can leave as soon as I get there. It's a very positive experience when instead of the game ending and survivors taking their win, I have to go to one gate, then walk away to show the people immersing around that gate that they can leave, then go to the other gate to see the teabaggers there out, then go to the first gate again to see the last.
---
Even if you're being "nice" no killer cares about the 500bp. Killer bloodpoint gain is insane.
---
like i said, i don't problem with them running those perks but it's quite unexpecting since... well, you can run other perks to benefit a lot from?
---
I remember this one time when i was playing dwight where i had the huntress follow me around the map and would watch me do gens and then she gave me the hatch
---
If adding a completely optional battlepass makes you quit, then you were either going to quit anyway and are just looking for any excuse, or you don't like the game as much as you think you do.
---
Tomorrow. The 2nd.
---
had the same thing happening, then switched controller now it's working perfectly. try swapping controller or try not to push down on you thumbsticks to much.
---
yes of course but its their choice
---
but, Legion is a counter? Plus theres numerous perks to stop looping, bamboozle, spirit fury, enduring, brutal strength....
---
You are absolutely correct, lol
---
With how many perks there are it might be hard to make a big variety of styles. Do your best though! Love the concept so far, would love to see more, even if some are similar to others.
---
That gave me a pure feeling of satisfaction.
---
up the ante op pls nrf

---
Tbagging isn't toxic. It's players who get mad at it that make it toxic
---
HOW ELSE CAN I GET 4 WGLF STACKS.
---
I play spirit. Top tier killer. I never get the extremely toxic bs other killers get. You know why? I play fair. I dont take advantage of the poor balance and matchmaking issues on the killer side. I dont use op garbage and stack it with more OP garbage. I dont tunnel the noobs to death. I dont crutch myself with noed. I dont use ruin bc it's an annoying perk to go up against. I dont camp unless I absolutley have to. As surv I dont mind all camping. It can be a really fun to go up against but when it's the only thing the killer does to get cheap easy kills...its just plain scummy. As killer I have far more control of the match and so I make sure the game is fun and fair. You have very little control as a solo surv. 
---
Killer mains have it easy. If you want to win in dbd you can just play a top tier killer or use a ridiculously overpowered add on. i get beads and green add ons on every web! And killers make waaay more points considering they live through every match. As surv you dont have that option. 1, even 4 insta heals does not even compare to beads or insta hatchets. If you solo you're flipping a coin, hoping you get a decent team against red rank killers (if they actually all load into the game.) The game is in such a bad state rn but killers continue to use their op crutches and sweaty hex ruin nurses. Killers dont care about giving survs a fun match so what do survs do? They all DC or suicide on the hook. Survs are also forced to play with every killer that is released but it's clear most survivors do not want to play with every killer. I think the game would be far more fun if you could choose what kind of killer to play against. 
---
killers can keep feeling entitled to playing in unfun ways but now we dont have a playable game. Everyone is in a toxic war with eachother. You can either be toxic or play nice. Doesnt matter if you are playing legitimately. Players will not stay in a game if it isnt fun.
---
underrated post 10/10 good meme
---
Does this mean we can finally get fingerguns for Ace? After all these years?
---
I just wan't a thumbs up and thumb down. Imagine failing a skill check only to have a really suburban neighborhood dwight getting up at giving you the thumbs down. Hurts more than the middle finger dude :'(
---
I WANT TO PLAY LOW TIER KILLERS WITHOUT RUIN AND SOMETHING LIKE HEX: DEVOUR HOPE AND NOT JUST BILLY AND NURSE AND HAG WITH RUIN, I JUST WANNA HAVE FUN BING BONGING AND STALKING PEOPLE AND GASSING PEOPLE, MAYBE EVEN PUTTING SOME BEARTRAPS DOWN.  
---
I JUST MIGHT NEED TO GET GOOD OR SOMETHING
---
Quite the opposite.
---
You're taking your own personal viewpoint and trying to speak for every killer.
---
I don't mind the free hit. Clearing the exits is part of the game. There's also no argument against it if someone is alive besides the survivor and not present at the exit. The killer needs to spend time chasing you out, which could afford someone an opportunity to open the other gate.
---
If this is really an issue for someone, there's mechanics in the game that combat it. Run instakill meyers, or bait people with iridescent hatchets. Run the freddy perk that blocks exit gates or makes them take longer to open.
---
Survivor mains and killer mains complain almost equally on this sub
---
I'm assuming it'll go off of EST or PST, like you said.
---
Lmao this guy
---
She's honestly the only face that looks in genuine pain. During the part of the pig mori where the blade goes through her hand she visibly cringes. She's the only good pain face imo.
---
I think he means the rest of the survivors adapt to it. It usually pretty easy to detect a basement camper if you have suspicions first.
---
and this, folx, is the definition of "unconstructive criticism". why do you feel these are "no good"?
---
I LIKE WHEN SURVIVORS TRY TO TELL ME THEY AREN'T IN COMMS
---
I HOOKED SOMEONE AND THE GEN BLEW UP SECONDS AFTER I STARTED WALKING TOWARDS YOU AS 8M TERROR RADIUS MYERS, I'M NOT STUPID
---
What else should the cosmetic team be doing?????
---
I'm in red ranks, I face them often. All of what I've said refers to red ranks.
---
I agree with you. I never camp, except when the Exit Games are open and i dont see myself in a Situation where i could get another Kill. I thought that most People think so too, but i recently got Comments like these when i did it, so I was curious if People on Reddit also think that you shouldnt.
---
I don't know why people here would rather Discordance than Surveillance. Surveillance is way more powerful than Discordance.
---
Discordance only shows 2 people or more working on a generator. Surveillance shows  if a a regressed generator is being worked.
---
If you use Discordance you really have to hope that two people work on a generator (plus, if they realize you have that perk, they just start doing gens alone, making the perk useless) , when with Surveillance you can say for sure one person will work on a generator you regressed, its just a matter of time to see when the generator will change to yellow.
---
Each game is different, there will be games where all 4 survivors do a single generator each time (which of course Discordance will work better), and there will be games where 4 gens will pop as 4 people were doing gens at the same time. (Which Surveillance will work better).
---
What Im trying to say is that Surveillance works most of the time and is way more trustable than Discordance.
---
I'm getting African vibes from this hook and it makes me wanna play RE5 again..
---
Lets be honest, this isn‚Äôt your best bait
---
"Are you gonna camp me? Yes you are! Yes you are! Whose a good killer? Is it you, are you a good boy? Yes you aware! Awww you're such a good killer!"
---
-Me, getting camped by The Doggo
---
I‚Äôll try swapping after I move tomorrow.
---
Did I ever tell you how I deflected a Hunting Hatching after chucking a pebble right at her? The match was phenomenal even The Entity stopped what it was doing just watching in awe.
---
I doubt they'd lock perks behind it. They might lock cosmetics and maybe emotes and possibly give out rare items/add ons tho
---
Copernicus
---
He could do better than this one tbh
---
Browsing subreddit of a party game WeirdChamp
---
I think it should be perks and exclusive battle pass killers. Like maybe hellraiser or Steve martin
---
Yall can down vote all you want. I'm just speaking the truth. Survivors can report people and DC all day but no one says a word.
---
This meme works for both sides :'(
---
/r/ihadastroke
---
You forgot the Claudette with both WGFF and deliverance.
---
I can maybe see some perks but not killers. They're all about money and they'd make more money selling the killers to everyone for 5 than locking them behind a pass
---
These are facts
---
I‚ÄôM ABSOLUTELY FINE WITH SWF EXISTING SO LONG AS THEY IMPLEMENT PENALTIES TO MAKE THE GAME MORE DIFFICULT. REMOVING THE ABILITY TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS WOULD KILL SO MUCH FUN THAT THE GAME HAS AND MAKE THE ENTIRE THING A SWEAT FEST. 
---
SWF SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF PENALTY TO GEN TIMES, REMOVE ITEMS, LIMIT PERKS, OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE IT‚ÄôS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREVENT DISCORD FROM BEING USED BY PARTIES.
---
you havent heard of my patented build of No Mither, Self Care, Solidarity, and Deja Vu B)
---
yeah same
---
I'd let him kill me if that actually becomes a skin
---
Her new top was very disappointing, though. Wish I could get the skirt and those nice shoes without paying real money.
---
There is no way to completely counter looping. You just run around them in the same direction until you catch up and then when they throw the pallet you break it and catch back up to them
---
feeling cute might stalk some survivors later
---
I really hope we get to see the results üòÜ
---
The decision to use Quentin and New Freddy instead of Nancy and Old Freddy was perplexing, to say the very least.
---
I probably will end up watching it at some point. For now I'll leave it because now I have plenty of other shows I need to catch up with :P.
---
i'd prefer OoO over DV
---
How would that help? The community is toxic enough.
---
but yeah, i would've understand if they were trying to do a fun build but i'm pretty sure they didn't
---
I'm betting that there's actually going to be an opera singer killer soon or something like that and this was an early hint. Possibly the next chapter? Just a guess.
---
Its more fodder for the cattle. Their game is fucking broken, with an DC epidemic. They're not doing themselves a service by pumping out cosmetics.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it would help, but I was seeing if they only disagreed cuz survivors would be the only ones to have it
---
Well the counter argument is that if you are injured then you are commonly in 2 different situations. 
---
One is where you are injured &amp; in a chase. At this point, you have no time to heal so you preoccupy the killer as much as possible
---
The other is where you are unhooked &amp; injured. Usually, your teammate will heal you under the hook so you do not need Self-care.
---
In a rare situation where you are injured &amp; the killer leaves you, instead of self-caring you can take the time looking around gens for other survivors to heal you. 
---
There is also the issue with killers that are anti-healing such as the plague &amp; Legion. Killers who also use perks like Sloppy can make healing take an extra 8 seconds. That makes healing take 40 seconds with Self-Care. You can easily spend that time looking for another survivor working on a gen to heal you without sacrificing the perk slot.
---
The problem is it is a viable strategy, if you taunt a killer to hard tunnel you as a good surv it is easier to win, I think mental is part of the game that you have to stay cool and control.
---
I saw one dude complaining he didn't win with facecamping Leatherface.
---
I'm rank 10 on survivor and 12 with killer, I have a p3 huntress, a p3 meg, and a p3 claudette, I've played this game before
---
Prove Thyself though, gotta MAX those Objective points early so doing gens becomes meaningless /s
---
Why do you keep replying in the wrong place dumbass
---

Blizzard has banned many inane things because it may have one particular definition that can be used that's naughty even though...  In the context of where it was said that wasn't the intent at all.  But gotta have that ultra squeaky clean corporate image, cant' let any bad thoughts come through no sir, gag and bind anyone who even remotely through very vague interpretations could be bad and penalize them.  Even search through their personal life and find anything at all that could ruin their image, ban them.
---
Blizzard is pretty god damn insane when it comes to overwatch.  They never seemed overly heavy handed in other games but when overwatch came out holy shit they snapped the knob off from trying to turn it past 11.
---
Most the cosmetics that require shards COST TOO MUCH to be worth grinding for.

I thought this was Bih not a random troll?

Omg yes I can't stand those fucking hedges and fences. It makes me wish I was good with the Nurse lol

I understand why they ended up doing a remake dlc but it‚Äôs still a bit upsetting lol
---
Its Bih
---
he's a troll
---
don't listen to him
---
I see Amanda I upvote.

Just force them out? It‚Äôs only really tilting if you let it be
---
10/10 shitpost. Some braindead killers think ‚Äúpatrolling‚Äù isn‚Äôt camping lol. I‚Äôm surprised people can‚Äôt see this post is sarcasm
---
I can stand in one spot and its camping but if I turn, it's not camping.
---
Whatever helps u sleep at night.
---
Of we use fornicate for an example, the cosmetics increased after the battle pass. But yes, I agree that bugs should be fixed, but haunting all progress on the game will only kill it faster.
---
Survivor DC's also fuckin suck and ruin the game and is much more of a common thing to happen.  There really, really needs to be a heavy penalty for disconnects because it's a VERY bad problem, honestly having a game where someone DOESN'T DC at all feels like a nice surprise.
---
Glad you understand

Enduring, Brutal strength and Spirit fury

We got ourselves an epic fortnite gamer

From what I can gather from the post, the event starts *tomorrow*, not tonight. Midnight UTC May 2nd is actually in 6 hours or so for me, but Peanits says he means tomorrow, so 30 hours from now.

---
The total number of cosmetics in the game goes up, sure. But for any new players or people who missed a pass due to life events or just taking a break from the game, the number of available cosmetics goes way down.
---
Fortnite also has the issue of not everything available in the store being sold at all times.

AS A KILLER YES PLEASE. DUMBASS CLAUDETTE TRIED TO FLASHLIGHT ME WHILE I HAD AN ACTIVE DEVOUR HOPE

That‚Äôs what I was saying kind of. ‚ÄúBattle pass‚Äù was the term fortnite used. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what they meant and people are FUMING while misinterpreting it. I‚Äôm fine no matter what happens TBH, I just was new content before the games stagnates.

You do know that the team that does the skins has no say or input into making balance changes/bug fixes?
---
I learned from past experiences that placing traps this way is a mistake, you should only place a trap in each 4 sides of the trap, otherwise you are gonna get confused and teleport to the wrong traps, hit the survivor and lose the last survivor in the hit recharge.

yeah, no

GO IN WITHOUT THE ATTITUDE OF WANTING TO WIN, AND YOULL LOSE THE STRESS. PLAYED A GAME AS MYERS WITH THE VANITY MIRROR BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE A FAST WALLHACKY BOI AND GOT 2 SURVIVORS. WOULD HAVE GOT MORE BUT CLAUDETTE HAD A KEY AND HER TEAMMATE HAD UNBREAKABLE. DEVS FIX KEYS REEEEEEEE

WTF I have a problem finding a 4 survivor game and you‚Äôre getting paired with a brazilian of them?!
---
I was rank 10 im rank 16 now
---
I want default dancing myers tho :(
---
I WASN'T WITHIN 32M AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT ANYWAY
---
They said ‚Äúreward system‚Äù not ‚Äúbattlepass‚Äù. They also never said they would stop making bug fixes. Stopping progress on the game say from a few bug fixes is how games are killed.
---
It‚Äôs pretty good I‚Äôd replace monstrous shrine with something else, maybe NOED, deer stalker, Mad grit.
---
WHY DOES EVERYTHING IN THE GODDAMN STORE NEED TO BE BOUGHT WITH AURIC CELLS !!! FUCK THIS MUFFAGIN GAME!
---
Exactly
---
Pls
---
Once the Golden Week sale is done I'll probably tally it all together to see how bad it is
---
She has a reduced terror radius, so monitor further reduces it. If you see someone healing with nurses, keep ANYTHING between you and them as you run up on them. They will think that they have more time than they do to heal or move as you come WHIPPING around cover to smack em.
---
Also, keep in mind that hag traps snap camera angles, thus effect survivor running. Place traps so that you pull survivors in chases into corners or AWAY from loops (the antelope trap. Anti-loop) so that you can get a free whack on them. 
---
And faking a trap placement over a downed survivor is a great way to draw out someone waiting to pallet stun or flashlight your survivor pickup.
---
So much more, but man, you just enjoy the ride. Hag really rewards being a devious bastard with her trap placements =)
---
What's with PS4?
---
Yeah that makes sense, even I can tell shrine kinda sucks üòÇ but still Idk I love to have my perks set up so they all compliment eatchother of that makes sense
---
have you ever totem hunted on maps like swamp or lerys? its a nightmare, cleaning totems without a 4Q is pointless due to just how worthless some teammates can be, you need to rush gens if you are not playing SWF
---
no, you got it from yourself because it's a troll, and it's probably you
---
THANKS, ITS BETTER NOW
---
Maybe __*noed*__ üòÇ
---
They could, theoretically, let some of the cosmetics crew go so they could hire more competent developers or at least a QA squad to boost the quality of their game. So yes, the cosmetics team can have an input on the balancing/bug fixing team.
---
People are so upset they downvoted your comment. Stray from the majority‚Äôs opinion and it‚Äôs over. I also enjoy how you were taking both sides and it‚Äôs still an absurd ideology.
---
The argument of people missing cosmetics isn't stupid. The argument for exclusive timed content is elitist and/or anti-consumer.

If someone pressing a key triggers you that badly I suggest finding another hobby.
---
People hate exposed when its in a situation were you should not be insta downed, I love playing against myers bc i at least expect and can work around his exposed effect, But killers like clown with insta down addons that are just amazingly broken make people not want to play the game, NOED is the same thing, it rewards bad play (Unlike DH) and people just say "just Cleanse totems" like that isnt a complete joke
---
This is why I hate them.
---
they need to make it a 180¬∞ radius 'cause right know the killer can dodge by opening from the side.
---
More fun? How is it more fun? It rewards ppl that has money and forces the ppl who doesn't have the money or isn't able to play to deal without. It would be more fair to implement it into a rank reward or devotion reward system. It's only fun for the ppl who can afford it. And if they did a reward system rather than a battle pass like a lot of the community wants how would you suffer exactly? Either way u would have to play, the only difference is it's free. Besides I feel like battle passes only gives ppl bragging rights. "I have the money so I have better cosmetics than you do scrub". Ive experienced this in multiple games with Battle passes and honestly it makes the community even more toxic than it already is.
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
---
rank 20 problems poor guy ):
---
I've switched to this game from Fortnite a couple months ago now and I think the community is awesome, or at least on the subreddit that is. I'm baffled how everyone finds it displeasing.
---
Can i just say somthing? every single legacy player i run into sucks ass, like i see all of these legacy players on Youtube kicking ass, but yesterday i got a legacy 2 claud that switched to dwight, He was wearing a BRIGHT RED shirt with urban evasion 1.
---
That's hardly funny. Why force the killer to dc over a glitch. I had someone stuck in a locker do that the other day for like 30 minutes. They did it on purpose though.
---
WIGGLE YOUR ARMS ON HOOK TO SIGNAL THAT THE KILLER IS NEAR YOU.
---
STOPPING WIGGLING WHEN THE KILLER IS GONE AND IT'S SAFE TO COME UNHOOK YOU.
---
Ok THE GAME IS FREE if you can‚Äôt afford the pass then don‚Äôt buy it 
---
It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs going to have items to break the game or give anyone an unfair advantage stop whining and being petty if you‚Äôre broke be broke stop trying to ruin everyone else‚Äôs enjoyment just because you can‚Äôt afford something
---
AY, IT'S A FREE 700-800 BP, WHY NOT! THEY CAN JUST DEAL WITH IT.
---
why are you talking about an issue that doesn't exist? just nobody wants a battlepass, and if you think they should you're deserving of a vicious beating until they break your bones into dust, making sure to never hit the head so you're conscious the whole way through.
---
I AM A FREDDY MAIN AND I DISAGREE WITH USING NOED. KEEP PRESSURE AT START AND IT MIGht take 2 or 3 gens but you can control the game with 2 gens left if you are good. But noed is not fun for survivors nor its a skill for a killer.
---
How do you get pallet looped as Billy? Don't respect pallets, just use your chainsaw or Enduring+Spirit Fury. You have 115% base movement speed.
---
HOLY FUCK LUCKY YOU, HAVEN'T SEEN ONE HAG IN LIKE A WEEK. MAYBE NOT, SHE IS ANNOYING AS FUCK. WHATS WHY I MAIN HER MUHAHAHAHAHA
---
Bunny mom is so cute
---
OH MY GOD I JUST SAW i am a failure to all Kates
---
AGAIN! How on Earth will you be "suffering" if the freaking cosmetics are free!? Both ways it's a progression system, only difference is the way I suggested is free and ones not. However my way everyone gets it and your way it's a limited time and maybe half the community may get it IF they play enough. And dude, it's not my fault I have bills to pay so can u please stop bringing up "your broke" that's really dumb and immature and most of all disrespectful.

This must be on Auto Lodge then, because I rarely have games where I can go from pallet to pallet seamlessly with a Billy. Usually because some other asshole already wasted them.
---
Amanda's letter is excellent
---
How is disabling crouching in a small square where you have no use for it punishing good players? The fuck.. If you haven't noticed theres been massive changes to the game to punish and reward so obviously it's not like it's uncommon to make changes. It's the smallest suggested change to simply discourage toxic behaviour and there's plenty of other places to hide and no one said make crouching outside the gate impossible don't assume things. The same can go for you if not being able to crouch in a small square that has no use gets you THAT mad then you should take a break and breathe.
---
I can already see the total tally.
---
"TOO MUCH".
---
*Bunp
---
Better to recover than move
---
Well so would a reward system through ranks and devotion. Both of them is a progression system. And IF it is a limited time event I would be fine with it if they eventually put it on the store for Auric cells OR shards.
---
You can agree that exclusivity has value, correct? On top of this it‚Äôs purely cosmetic, a incentive to play the game, it‚Äôs not giving you a fifth perk slot. And value is important in every game, if it be an ego boost, bragging rights, or whatever the fuck.
---
I unlocked my fps lover year ago and no problems
---
PLAY WITH WHATEVER PERKS YOU WANT ITS YOUR GAME WHO GIVES A SHIT IF PEOPLE PLAYING SURVIVORS CAN DO THE SAME
---
Could be a couple of reasons most likely of which is they are healing themselves as much as they can so someone can reach them for a quick save. 
---
They might also think they are hidden where they are and moving might give them away.
---
Lastly they might just want the killer to pick them up either because they‚Äôve given up, they think being saved off the hook might be quicker, or because they have decisive strike ready to go.
---
Play it like a bongo
---
KKonaW
---
I think it means Freddy dreams about it too
---
I agree... it‚Äôs quite sad. :( The gens get rushed and I don‚Äôt like using NOED, I prefer to win before they all get done. Life‚Äôs hard as a killer. 
---
Definitely the most reliable perk build. :).

I HONESTLY CAN'T PLAY KILLER TOO OFTEN BECAUSE IT STRESSED ME THE FUCK OUT
---
I'm too normie for this.
---
Eradication shouldn't be the objective. The removal of mechanics that make it easier or more beneficial to camp should be.
---
Corrupt intervention over ruin any day. It is guaranteed to work for 2 whole minutes and lets you manage a smaller area easily since it will be unlikely that survivors will dare to go there
---
It's not incest if they're not related by blood
---
That's **never** going to go well. another shirtless guy though? absolutely.
---
YOU LOOK LIKE THAT GUY WE CAN'T HEAR BECAUSE YOU DON'T TYPE IN CAPS.
---
Only survivors get it. For a while it was glitched and killers got it but not survivors. That has since been fixed.
---
I DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY GO TOWARDS HER, IT WAS WELL AFTER THE HOOK HAPPENED
---
AND I'M NOT GONNA SIT AND ARGUE THIS WITH YOU REGARDLESS, WITH THE AMOUNT OF PRIVATE PROFILE SURVIVORS WHO'VE TRIED TO INSIST THEY AREN'T SWF AT ALL AFTER I SAW THEM ON EVERYONE ELSE'S FRIEND LIST I'M MORE THAN AWARE THAT THEY WERE IN VOICE AS MUCH AS THEY WANT TO LIE ABOUT IT
---
It is unfair, Its no ones fault, neither of us should have to give up our blood points, but the game has bugs. If a perk like head on(im not sure if this is the culprit or not, I believe it is) is causing bugs it should be disabled. Its my first time using the perk and the first time this has happened to me so im just assuming its the perk.  Again its unfortunate for both parties no ones arguing that
---
Is anyone more concerned about all of those ducks under their TV?
---
Just gonna reply to everyone at once, I think they more mean how we interact in post-game chats and in the external gathering places, not teabagging mid-game.
---
I don't think Doctor is OP, I just think he is the most annoying killer to play against before Legion because you can't hide unless you have that one specific perk no one runs.
---
Well sounds to me the problem you are refering to is a whole different problem from hillbilly per say. Pallet management is a def underlooked and vital part of suceeding on chases. You can def move from tile to tile early/mid match if you know how to play around them
---
yeah, you're right, you should be given a vicious beating until they break your bones into dust, making sure to never hit the head so you're conscious the whole way through, and once your body is so broken they can't do any more damage, they start bashing your head in. jaw first. then skull.

Incel
---
You must be one of those technicality assholes :p by your definition bubba is pay to win because bbq and chili gives double BP. I don't find any of it to be pay to win. Even if you bout 10 million bloodpoints and maxed out a killer, it wouldn't give you a win. It would help sure, but it's not gonna win for you :p that's just my opinion. And even thou dbd has things held behind a pay wall, none will give you a win.
---
Not a nice family Mom and dad split up but I love both step mom tho she a thot and i don't hit women, but I will fuck a bitch up.

oof

Honestly i think the best thing is to constantly put the unreportable graphic in the news everyday so people can see it pop up every damn day
---
Hahahaha this right here is why I wish everyone could see everyone else's emblems. Try and claim that I'm camping when you can see I got iri in all categories. Now that would be amusing.
---
Keep playing, dude! It gets better with time. There are toxic people and you'll definitely interact with them, but many players are great
---
I solo queue, there is no pallet management to be had. Pallet management is finding out on the go which pallets have been eaten/used and which haven't. Sometimes you can get really unlucky with pallet spawns as it is. Anywho, I have just never seen Pallet looping being that big a deal to Billy of all Killers. He has so many tools to deal with Pallets and most Billies run the insta chainsaw add-ons.
---
I personally just don't see why he still has a base movement speed of 115% when Nurse is slow as molasses and Spirit is 110%. All 3 of these killers are capable of flying around the map as high speed, so why is Billy the boy with the 115% privilege here? Yes, I know it is because he was part of the original 3 killers who all had 115% movement speed.
---
If i cant default dance at the exit gates, whats even the point?
---
Wasn't it also discovered that players that unlocked their framerate were getting stuck in the basements for that one period of time?
---
Say what you will, pallet looping is a dumb and boring mechanic that just feels so bad and silly to the killer.  
---
  
---
Removing pallets isn't gonna balance the game though, since people are just gonna loop on the main buildings with windows...  
---
Also it's gonna break the game.  
---
I suggest a mechanic where the survivor is punished( not necessarily directly) for making a beeline for pallets and loops, and for staying in the same general area for too long.  
---
This would incentive the survivors to try and hide from the killer when running away, and not just get the next loop ready, and it would also punish the survivor for looping around the same general area for 2-3 loops, making the game look like a Tom and Jerry cartoon.  
---
They should also add a mechanic that rewards killers for proper time management that isn't invisible. That way, the killer might not find it worth the time to keep chasing, giving survivors a chance to escape even when injured. Maybe something like, after being in a chase for a certain amount of time, the killer gets the ability to kick a gen and start regression on 3/4/5/6 other gens, exploding the once that are being worked on, notifying the killer of new survivors to find and chase.  
---
This would give the survivors a better experience IMO since it would diversify the chases and who gets chased, all while slowing down the game for everyone, but not in a pure "hold M1 longer" kinda way.  
---
This would be healthy for the game, making the game more fun for both killers AND survivors. Add in a few other QoL improvement and the game would be much healthier than it is now.
---
Yeah but unless they have kindered or its swf it‚Äôs pretty hard to know if an insidious camper is camping the basement
---
Confession time: I once sandbagged a survivor that‚Äôs been teabagging, flashlight clicking and taunting poor Piggy. We both died eventually because of that, but I still think I did a right thing ‚Äî if you ruin other people‚Äôs experience, others may ruin yours. Even your teammates.
---
ban everything. remove crouch. The Killer despawns after every hook. Noed now makes it take 3 hits. MoM makes it 1 hit. Matter of fact make the Killer only give hugs and nap times and the Survivors gotta wake each other up and work on ovens to give the killer snacks
---
When the p3 Claudette takes being immersive to another level

I can't get off to step family stuff.
---
Not taboo enough
---
Thing is, even though most of his add ons are copies of hillbilly, at least they're good. Decreased charge time and cool down are really good and help with him especially since he's a weaker killer. The marks are also very good and make him almost decent, making his chainsaw run faster. He does have a lot of crap add ons though(chili add ons have little to no effect, speed limiter makes him a large piece of shit and noise add ons aren't that helpful). Pig barely has any good add ons. Even her iridescent add ons aren't that good
---
I like to combo it with BBQ, and absolutely love running it on Doctor or Huntress (Doctor because survivors can hide in lockers to avoid their madness tiering up, and huntress for faster reload if nothing else). I would absolutely say grab it while you can. It can be extremely useful with the right killers/in the right builds.
---
if i dont see the killer leave the killer shack or am suspicious of a camper I go to the top floor or halfway down the stairs. you can hear them breathing if you do that
---
I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK!
---
Bunny Feng soon.
---
Everyone would die because the killer would have an extra 5 minutes while everyone kept finding the same broken full and had no idea how many were left.
---
It'll be caught up to whatever it was the day they backed it up again.
---
So, for example, 6 weeks prior to the PTB (just an example, I don't know when they backed it up this time,) they create a copy of your information and use that for the PTB instead of having your PTB progress impact your live-game progress.
---
"and you play camping" "i didn't camp" "and so are you" idk but i'm dying here
---
Where did they announce the bloodhunt?
---
i thought i was coming off as condescending to who i replied to, Didnt think people would think i was serious.
---
We're gonna farm forever, nice
---
Yeah there is a counter to pallets... break them...
---
When does blood hunt start?
---
Still better than emojis.
---
&gt; I'm not colorblind but I instantly put "Very Interested" when I saw it.
---
glad im not the only one
---
Camping and tunneling is killing the game
---
Nobody expects a killer/survivor to just stand still. It underrated Strat 1.
---
Unless it's Bubba and he has someone hanging out.
---
Yup, but the majority my dude
---
Ur just unlucky
---
Tombstone Piece. Mori only works in Evil Within III and only with a close-proximity quick M1 attack (no lunge).
---
Really nice if you can save a mori for a hatch standoff.
---
you've still failed your objective of stopping the gens. the endgame is just you picking up the pieces from your lack of kills.
---
you're rewarded more if the game doesn't make it to endgame since you prevented the gens from being completed.
---
I need The Comic mask!

Stop killers from being able to face camp
---
Wait what? So if the perks are decent then they cost more?
---
I think a cool feature would be an alternate Mori for some killers rather than Fortnite style emotes
---
So, if they implemented automatic bans for DC, it would only be for players that manually DCed and not for internet connection issues, correct?
---
I‚Äôd love for sour players to be punished for screwing people over, but I wouldn‚Äôt want someone punished for a bad connection.
---
That's not at all why they're offended. They're offended because it's used as a way to taunt the other side, usually when they're losing or has lost.
---
i think they are bad at communicating since peanits said its 30 hours from now about an hour ago so it starts midnight may 3rd UTC

Eh, we'll see tomorrow nonetheless.

Lol
---
That'd never happen.
---
I believe the reason it cost more is because it's the first time it's been on the shrine, has nothing to do with quality for sure though.
---
You need to practice with his chainsaws, some maps stop him from using his chainsaw and can be looped like any other killer . He‚Äôs fine the way he is.

How is this being negative? A good nurse wouldn't spam her attack out like that. I wonder how the game went after this. by looks of this that nurse is not good. Can you show a full game of you doing this against a high rank nurse multiple times in a single game by standing still? Standing still is the worst way to deal with a nurse.
---
Is doc that bad
---
OMG. Thanks so much for getting this post on most controversial of all time! I kind of figured this would happen in the dbd community, but jeez! Again, thank you so much, this was fun to make and even more fun to see reactions! Have a wonderful day

No, it‚Äôs not a good use of precious perk slots
---
welp when you marry someone  you become family yet you still fuck
---
It's the first time in the shrine
---
throughout the game, your goal is to prevent the gens from being completed. if you don't defend the gens, they will be repaired. I see a lot of killers whine that they were genrushed, when they didn't kick me off a gen once. if the gens are completed you've failed your primary objective, after that your objective changes to just trying to get extra kills. so, yes, you did fail an objective. you could play terribly and not defend any gens at all, and you'll be rewarded with NOED.
---
I'm not saying NOED isn't counterable, but I am saying that there's no earning factor apart from failing to defend gens, and that's not even "earning" it, that's the entity trying to give you pity kills because it feels bad for you.
---
Ohh got it. Thanks
---
I said most of the time for the first one. Most of them will let you get some hit points at gate
---
Never heard that. Was it killers, survivors or both?
---
Still better than Friday the 13th ever was and ever will be. The devs here actually give a damn
---
\- Everyone: Complains about the community.  
---
\- BHV : Makes game single-player only  
---
\- Everyone: Excuse-me wtf
---
Nice, has he done this for killer perks as well?
---
I had a couple of instances on the dedicated server PTB where 1) it started with less than 5 players (thought it was supposed to bounce back to the lobby) and 2) which rolls into point 1, people getting stuck in an infinite load screen, which I thought was fixed in this build.
---
If they are more recent considering legion was 2nd last new killer to be added into the game. They would cost more.
---
Nope, just feels more comfortable to me.
---
did you get 2 killers?
---
If they add skins and not addons items and offerings than I think it‚Äôll be fine
---
Other people are sayin it costs more cuz it‚Äôs the first time on the web
---
That's good to hear. I wish there were an official stance on it, though. With the money I've put into this game, being banned would absolutely suck.
---
Make the broken pallet leave behind an area of rough terrain that slows for ~1 minute after breaking.
---
I think NOED *is* the only perk killers have that's worth mentioning before they have a bunch of DLC and teachables. What are the meta builds? BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury for m1 killers. BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's/M&amp;A, one free choice for anyone whose power lets them play around pallets. All teachables, only two of which are from a free killer. What's the best build you can put together with only universal perks and, say, Hillbilly's teachables? Bitter Murmur/Tinkerer, Sloppy Butcher, Enduring, NOED?
---
I'm somewhat convinced the game teaches new players to tunnel a survivor to death while all the gens pop then try to snowball off NOED for the last three survivors just because that's their best chance of getting a 3k with what they have. Obviously if you have a bajillion hours like the good twitch streamers do, you can just grab Nurse or Hillbilly and slug your way to victory with zero perks against even the best survivors. But when we're talking about new players...
---
ID BE HAPPY IF THEY JUST LET KILLERS PICK UP DOWNED SURVIVORS BEING HEALED WHICH IS CLEARLY AND OVERSIGHT BUT THEY IGNORE IT.
---
Thank you!!
---
Could be possible also.
---
So actually try playing killer for a while and getting better instead of rage quitting when it doesn't go your way?
---
I rarely play a game where I don‚Äôt get upset messages regardless of the match outcome üòì
---
Unamused speaks to me and I would use it more than any other
---
I FUCKING HATE TRYHARDING A 3V1 OR LESS BUT IM SICK OF ALL THESE 3V1S SO IM TRYHARDING IN THE 3V1S AND RARER 2V1S AND 1V1S WETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT
---
I'll definitely make some more of these. I've got a lot of ideas.
---
Discordance just promotes survivors playing optimally though. Bamboozle is situationally useful and can be substituted by simply knowing how to run certain loops with windows. Make your choice is only good on high mobility killers and generally promotes not tunneling which I thought was good.
---
Plus make your choice is pretty old and I wouldnt say recent.
---
Rancor isnt at all good besides getting to mori the survivor who is the obsession at the end. It's pretty situationally useful since it happens on gen pop.
---
Pop goes the weasel isnt at all good plus so few builds use it that you cant honestly tell me its strong. It's just alright.
---
Haunted grounds is a band aid for the problem that hex totems are too easy to find and is just ok as it relies on survivors just cleansing any hex totem. If you communicated you could avoid popping it when a survivor is about to be hit.
---
Corrupt intervention does literally nothing except give survivors 2 minutes to go search for totems.
---
On top of that, they probably spend more time each each reviewing and planning new cosmetic ideas too
---
Sounds like a NOED user to me
---
I‚Äôve never run into it so I have no idea. Tbh it‚Äôs not devs fault when people abuse exploits, which is why it should be reported.
---
SOMEONE ACTUALLY MADE THIS HAHAHAHAHA
---
What build do you use for trapper?
---
This feels like more of a coop event, which could work. Imagine this:
---
The survivors and killers decide to break the endless loop of killing, even if only for one day. The entity, however, is very displeased, so it starts to destroy the realm they are in. All the players spawn in the same area, possibly with voice chat. They have to obtain little floaty orbs scattered throughout the map. Some are too high for anyone to reach however, and this is where the teamwork comes in. 
---
Instead of a weapon, the killer can click on a survivor to request to pick them up. The survivor can accept or reject. If accepted they get on the killers shoulder, and can reach the higher floating orbs, as well as move with the killer at killer speed. The killer would have 115% movement speed. If their power is movement based (Legion, Nurse, Hillbilly, etc.) they would keep their power. If it isn‚Äôt movement bases, then the killer gets 5% more movement speed. All players would need 10 orbs, before they can power the exit gates.
---
There would be four levers, each for one survivor, and a pedestal in the front with a button the killer can press. The door would need to be powering up for 150 seconds. Every player powering up would would power 1 second per second, capping at 5 seconds per second. 
---
Seems cool to me. Sorry for the weird formatting of the paragraphs.
---
I think why they chose the remake is probably because it's licence is way cheaper than the original.
---
I read what you said hence why I said my statement. And hacking xbox automatically detects and can ban you for it. Hence why not many people hack on most games on console as much as they used to. And it still applies. Like the whole appeasing the mass mk 11 is still behind several patches on PC like it used to be on console. Graphics are still shit for both PC and switch for mk 11. While consoles got top tier. My point is they focus on what made them successful to begin with and they deal with the rest later. PC holds the most playerbase.
---
That's... actually the correct play though. Unless you're an absolute god at doing gens and can hit great skillchecks 100% of the time, it's much more efficient if you do a gen solo and power through ruin skillchecks, than doing a gen with a teammate and having to deal with twice as much downtime.
---
The mori we deserve.
---
Haha, joke's on whoever farmed me killer had Dying Light and I was the obsession, you played yourself.
---
Ruin, Agitation, Iron Grasp, and BBQ
---
I already have it, might cop it for the 270k BP
---
I think why they chose the remake is probably because the remake's license is WAY cheaper than the originals'.
---
I wouldnt mind that, would be the one time someone did want me
---
Thank you! I just got the game 3 days ago and I want to main trapper, I‚Äôll start grinding for these perks
---
[Consider it done](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bjkxz5/legion_undertale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
What add-ons were you running, global?
---
The issue itself was fixed by the devs, but after an update, a number of survivors would enter the basement, and when trying to leave would only be teleported back inside.
---
 I don't know if there was any proof that the two were related, but I recall seeing several posts of those affected saying they unlocked their framerate.
---
It was a joke lol, in reality, I wouldn't really mind if they implemented a battle pass type reward system just as long as they fix the game before they start adding more monetary decisions. But I get the whole mood of the community seems to be overreacting to the questions from the survey.
---
You‚Äôre are indeed correct.
---
We already got phantom and christine skins
---
What characters are they on?
---
With all due respect, you're a cunt.
---
Lmao don‚Äôt get too shock therapy aggressive with him, you have a whole game to run around. He‚Äôs one of my mains and honestly the only time I ever actually zap people is when they are running a close ranged loop, only shock them once or twice until they get to tier 2 madness, then focus on hitting them. 
---
Your goal with Herman is to get everyone to t2 madness, t3 is a bonus but it‚Äôs not what you should look for when playing him. Survivors can escape 3, not 2. Having every survivor in t2 makes the end game tremendously easy, as if you want to go for the 4k, allow a slug to crawl but they‚Äôll still scream from madness.
---
His addons other than the very rare stuff aren‚Äôt good. I wouldn‚Äôt concern myself with them. 
---
Keep the shock therapy out until meeting a survivor. 
---
Other than that, it‚Äôs basic gameplay. Hope this helps
---
It is a big but, with a curvy waist
---
Again it takes less time to develop cosmetics then to balance the game plus there is two different teams and one is a lot easier to do
---
masterpiece
---
My favorite are the ones who pop in front of me while I chase someone else, teabag, then run expecting to distract me from the one I had. I ignore them, so they then chase after me and try for my attention while I concentrate on the first one. and I'm like, "sure neon Meg, ill incapacitate you both, dont mind if I do."
---
As if I'm going to fall for Meg's distraction till her adrenaline activates.
---
Very helpful thanks
---
Yea I agree. Although they have messed up they didn't plan for the exploit to be in and although it sounds like an easier fix to just remove the add-ons until the fix maybe they can't do it after all the code is all jumbled up and a mess.
---
Spoiler tag would probably be a good idea
---
Lmao that's good for FPS not a game where FOV is more important than pixel perfect aim. But whatever works for you, as long as you are doing good you go right ahead.
---
Nope, I was running longer phantasm duration. And I didn't even trap hooks.
---
I'm gonna facecamp you if I ever find you in the fog
---
You're gonna have a bad time alright
---
I mean the community tends to do that over every little decision tho
---
The objective is to kill survivors. If they make it out the gate the killer failed. It doesn't matter when they die.
---
You.. I hate you..
---
I guess some survivors see dying as being camped then
---
The reason I call him that because he is very annoying and no mere mortal can take on Herman
---
Yeah, a replay system would be great as well
---
It's me
---
Background info: Played as Wraith and always checked the surroundings after I hook someone. They were 4 surv friends and often tried to block my path while I had someone on my shoulder, so someone almost always was close. Only got the last kill, because he ran straight into my arms after he got unhooked, over half of the map. If I saw someone running to the hooked guy or scratchmarks in general I'd follow them and pursue the "unhooker".  
---
AITA for following someone when he wants to unhook?
---
And skillchecks on Anna's map. please no more. *please*
---
I would love that so much
---
Stop speaking sense, the people who make these posts ar obviously master coders 
---
/s
---
The playerbase itself is full of masochists
---
lol
---
You most likely won't get banned for modifying the Engine.ini, but I would refrain from touching that file, as it can be used to more malicious ends. You want to unlock your framerate in the GameUserSettings.ini anyway.
---
My two favorite games in one meme. I approve.
---
They‚Äôre not bugged by themselves (I don‚Äôt think?) so if I‚Äôm right theres no point in disabling or removing the addons
---
Seriously? I‚Äôm confused why there‚Äôs hate on ps4 but not xbone?
---
The motorcycle helmet: The Stig üòÇ
---
Double the dying rate? Seems that would encourage slugging. How about a 4% chance to hit unbreakable and get up. Want to make it so killers WONT slug.
---
I put low quality. Kate is bbg for life
---
Dude. Spoiler tag.   
---
Think please.
---
9/10 times, it's better to recover than to go hide. Even if you start to crawl, you make loud noises and bleed everywhere and can be found easily anyway. In the event someone else was in the area and can distract "just long enough" you can be brought up fairly quickly. It's better to recover than waste 30 seconds hiding (unless it's just 2 left and the killer is slugging to prevent hatch...that's your 1/10 scenario)
---
you‚Äôre new to the game and you already camp? oh my. don‚Äôt be too desperate to get kills. can‚Äôt expect to kill every single survivor in every game. that‚Äôs not how this game works buddy
---
I was sold by the banana with blades tied to it.
---
Had to check I hadn't accidentally stumbled into dbdgonewild after a title like that
---
It is! I had enough cells for the weapon, which alone is amazing.
---
Couldn't agree more. Doesn't matter if it hit my skillchecks when the person next to me is constantly regressing the gen on me. Much rather do my own gen with ruin active.
---
"Lore"
---
Actually I got a 144hz monitor so fps does matter for me D:
---
Definitely the guy who wants all gay people to die.
---
I mean didn‚Äôt we already get his pubes on his Santa skin? Shirtless clown is the only natural next step
---
I dunno, I remember when it was possible to get to outside/on top of the asylum. They put up a big warning saying that if you are reported and proven doing that to expect a ban.  
---
Seems to make sense. Patches take time, warnings a lot less, and can be deployed while a patch is being put together.
---
I LIKE WHERE YOUR HEAD IS AT, BUT IF SWF ARE ASSHOLES ALL THE FUCKING TIME, NO AMOUNT OF BP IS GONNA HELP THAT. ASIDE FROM MAYBE ON SPECIAL EVENTS.
---
Preventing the completion of the generators is still an objective, there can be multiple objectives.
---
Oh right. All businesses are the same. My bad. You‚Äôre totally right.
---
Oops too early in the morning to post.
---
Mistakes were made.
---
Total regerts.
---
I know it's not but he is fine tbh. Pennywise is one of my all time favorite movie monsters. It would just be too hard to implement tbh. Plus I'm pretty sure the entity (my headcanon really) is a Todash Vampire like Pennywise is. Can't have two of those beings together or all hell will break loose
---
No, don't use noed
---
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NURSE. THANK YOU.
---
im sorry to disagree but we just dont see eye to eye on this subject, i see no problem whatsoever with billy. i do recon beforehand being in a chase, i know exactly where there is pallet or where it isnt newarby so that i can work my way on chase if needed. i always have a 'plan' ofc it doesnt always work and i get caught by billies just like everyone else. but i think billy is a killer that you can give a pretty good run for his time. way longer way worth than with nurse. the % of win games vs billy is not even close to the games vs nurses.
---
You think so? Yeah a couple others said they liked unamused too, it's weird to me because I was on the verge of erasing it haha, thanks so much:)
---
I literally said MoM is too strong in my last statement. I don't want strong perks, I want perks that allow me to play the game differently.
---
Deliverance is pretty bad. Not only is it conditional on getting an unhook you then usually have a teammate coming to save you anyway, and it is pretty bad if you play with friends. Distortion is also bad, name a loadout that you would actually take Distortion in over other perks. 
---
The problem I am talking about is that the developers are not giving survivors new/fun perks to play with. The last 3 meta changing events were MoM, DS nerf, Self Care nerf. Two of these just reduced the amount of usable perks.
---
You can prevent gens being done for 7 hours and still not win the game. Killing survivors is the objectives. Generators are a side objective like totems.
---
I literally had the exact same idea
---
I mean yea I'm not disagreeing with ya
---
*myers pulls out t4 meat scepter*
---
LEARNING NURSE IS HARD
---
Completely understandable. I don‚Äôt main killer, but I‚Äôll play for fun and boy howdy is it not fun to go against survivors that wanna ruin your day on purpose. I appreciate your feedback and good luck out there Mistah/Mizz Killah.
---
Ever heard of pop goes the weasel and corrupt intervention aka perks that survivors literally can't counter and will work 100% of the time. There is never a good reason to use noed
---
Trapper: Oh a bread crum!
---
Haddonfield is a survivor sided map.  If they got 4 Balance Landing on that map and you don't play Nurse, you might as well DC. Even without Balance Landing, it's still a terrible map for Hillbilly and Huntress and a pretty bad map for Spirit tho. For Hag and Trapper is a good map, Nurse is meh on this map ( lots of LOS blockers for her, but with a good prediction, so should be fine ) and a terrible map for anyone else.
---
SWF itself isn‚Äôt toxic. SWFs just don‚Äôt usually care about the killer‚Äôs and/or randos fun, so they‚Äôre all seen as toxic by a lot of killer mains. A lot of them are also entitled survivors. If they have comms it‚Äôs boring to go against them because they take away the fun in the game, not knowing where everything is till you see it. Long as you don‚Äôt skip gate snd say GG BABY KILLER because of it I dont care at all about you being a SWF. I do dodge if I keep getting against a lot em tho
---
I JUST SPENT 4 DAYS GETTING KICKED HALFWAY THROUGH ALL MY SURVIVOR GAMES. THERE'S ONE FIX THAT DOESN'T EVEN ALWAYS WORK.
---
[FIX.](/intensifies)[YOUR.](/intensifies)[FUCKING.](/intensifies) [GAME.](/intensifies)
---
I can see where they are coming from then. It does suck to be bullied on that game as it seems some people don‚Äôt hold their punches. I‚Äôve actually never had a killer mad at us for being SWF, it‚Äôs only been on the forums that I‚Äôm seeing a lot of conversation about it and was super curious. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Yeah everyone on this sub can code. The devs are just 3 years olds. But even 3 year olds can do it. My cousin is 1 month and made the most popular game in the world
---
Not toxic necessarily, but certainly strong. Even if they're super nice, a solid SWF group is pretty annoying to play against. Most killers don't stand a chance (unless the killer is at a decidedly higher skill level than the SWF group).
---
As for SWF groups that are *also* being toxic, it's the only thing that I'll DC for as a killer. Don't care if it's childish or cowardly, there is just nothing enjoyable about being in a match with them.
---
Don‚Äôt HAVE to be, but almost always will be.
---
ironically this is the map i got adept on nurse
---
I think just having a timeout session of so many minutes would be the best bet. People love to depip to get easier games and at a certain point people just don't care about bloodpoints as they just want to play.
---
Having a timeout system would stop a lot of the on purpose dc's imo.
---
and you can't use dead hard after adrenaline...
---
It is skillful. It takes patience and there‚Äôs a lot of risk involved. They might catch on  and not go for a save. I, however, am slick af and they never see me coming.
---
The only real incentive to play doc is if you REALLY struggle with finding survivors at the start of the game, but there are many ways to find your first survivor. You can use whispers or look at many of the available guides on YouTube. A good killer to play that is quite easy to pick up and play is Billy, if you‚Äôre on PC search in YouTube ‚ÄòHillbilly Q and E‚Äô and thank me later. Hillbilly is a strong killer that is relatively easy to use, with solid perks. A great starting killer
---
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, can you let me know why it‚Äôs boring to go against them in particular?
---
Not cool man tag for spoilers
---
Beast marks and doom marks increase speed. Chili increases acceleration. 
---
Chili is bugged and does nothing. It's supposed to make you reach max speed sooner.
---
I like Clown to play, mostly due to Santa clown, but Freddy is more FUN to play and I agree with you. Idc about winning so it amps that even harder
---
It literally is better to work on separate gens, mainly due to the 3 second downtime affecting ALL players on that gen and skill check chances being the same for each survivor as if they were doing it solo, meaning that you have 4x the odds of getting the 3 second downtime.
---
Unless you're misunderstanding and are only trying to say that survs should just power through ruin instead of searching for the totem, in which case I agree, there should only ever be one surv at max searching for the totem, chances are that someone's going to stumble upon it randomly sometime during the match anyway.
---
Wraith is definitely not qualified for this kind of check-up.
---
That is a good point.
---
give this man all the upvotes
---
Lery's is very RNG reliant and can become quickly one of the most survivors sided maps in the game. I saw someone played Scratched Mirror Myers on Lery's. Survivors got all the good windows on that map. It's useless to say that he was looped to death.
---
I feel spoiled as Spirit has no bad add-ons. Her worse ones affect passive phasing.
---
*vaults pallet*
---
What? You think I‚Äôm gonna stand there and break it?
---
I don‚Äôt get playing survivor with WGLF for points. As killer, even without BBQ, you can get more points than a survivor could ever get.
---
I‚Äôm honestly middle of the road when it comes to hitting greats so I‚Äôm afraid of messing up and getting someone hooked. If I‚Äôm alone I‚Äôll stay til the killer finds me.
---
I play a lot of killer, and for me playing SWF games is almost too much fun because you can use that to have an advantage in mind games. Also with how many boosted survivors there are it is a nice change of pace.
---
What is it with BHVR and ps4? I see a lot of these memes but I don't really get it. (I play PC)
---
Okay to be actually correct, very few (if any) animals purposefully express bright colours to dissuade predators - rather, natural selection has favoured their survival and propagation of the bright phenotype as wary predators can identify them better and leave them be.
---
That in itself is the case in few species that live in isolated ecosystems where such interactions can be consistent. Bright colours on animals (toxic or not) actually act to counter the survival pressure of locating mates in dense, varied ecological settings, rather than to combat predation. Being more visible is a very poor trait survival wise as it makes animals more susceptible to visual predators, but is often by increased mating opportunities. 
---
TL;DR: The above headline is a pretty sensationalist take on convergent morphology and not necessarily universally true.
---
True gaming intellectual.
---
Why do people keep saying BHVR is disregarding ps4 opinions?
---
Both accounts would get banned from psn.
---
Well devour hope is really bad , i've never managed to make it last 5 minutes . Most half decent survivors can easily get it before it does it's thing .
---
Fucking spoilers
---
I prefer recover than crawling. Right when I get hit I figure it's pointless to crawl because where am I gonna go. Killer is right there. If I want to get away I have to know which direction the kill will go and then crawl the opposite way. If I want to recover, it's easier to do that immediately so that I can just get sweeped up in a second.
---
I can see where you‚Äôre coming from, especially if the group is purposely being toxic. I guess I just don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs particularly annoying if they aren‚Äôt. I guess because they are organized so it‚Äôs a lot harder to beat them.
---
That's one thing that noed users don't understand, one of your objectives is to protect generators, if you stay near hooked survivors to tunnel them when the survivor gets unhooked, you're gonna get genrushed because you're not doing your objective. That's why they use noed most of the time. Devour hope users get rewarded for moving on to the next objective without staying nearby hooked survivors.
---
I'm gonna fix that ~~spaghetti~~ lack of JoJo memes
---
I think adrenaline is more heavy on the "may never be used" side of things since it's a one time proc while NOED is as long as the totem is up. My issue is if I play survivor in solo which i have to, my teammates will literally walk by totems, and I dont always run small game. I know where many, many totems spawn but not knowing if I missed one is what gets me
---
I‚Äôve done gens with other people with ruin active. I think it is effective if everyone stops doing the gen anytime someone fails to hit a great. At least that way it minimizes the total amount of skill checks.
---
I don't think the axes have different sensitivities, but the sensitivity changing randomly has happened to me sometimes as well, though mostly only when tabbing out of and back into the game.
---
For a more consistent sensitivity, you can try putting
---
[/Script/Engine.InputSettings]
---
bEnableMouseSmoothing=False
---
at the end of your Input.ini, then setting the file to read-only. I think the game uses DirectInput, so it's not cursor-based and therefore not affected by cursor settings, but it certainly doesn't seem raw either.
---
For sensitivity itself, these two entries are used, in the same file:
---
AxisMappings=(AxisName="LookUp",Scale=-1.000000,Key=MouseY)
---
AxisMappings=(AxisName="Turn",Scale=1.000000,Key=MouseX)
---
So if you still feel like either of the axes is more sensitive than the other, you can adjust them individually using these, where MouseY is obviously vertical, and MouseX horizontal sensitivity.

One of the Legion members?

No it's a bug. Happened to me in a recording. It was funny because right when I cleansed it, I jokingly went "KABOOM" and the thunder never happened and I was all "wtf"
---
A lot of them have comms or gen rush. It‚Äôs either one of those two or they‚Äôre immersed survivors which makes it even more boring. Assuming they have comms, they‚Äôll tell everyone in the SWF where the hex is so a hex can go down in less than a minute. SWF groups will usually run adrenaline, BT, Iron will, an exhaustion perk, self care, MoM, or Decisive. Some DC a lot against killers or offerings they hate. I‚Äôve had a 3 man all force close the game because I brought in a secret offering (they don‚Äôt it in 4 mans surprisingly only 3 mans).
---
Yes I didn't. Trapping hooks is a waste of time and resources.
---
I‚Äôve had some experience with other killers including billy and find him quite fun but I was planning on expanding my killers but needed some advice with doc cus I was interested in him thanks either way
---
I love hope, for the quote and for how useful it is
---
Well that‚Äôs nice to hear at least! I hope my fellow survivor mains are treating you nicely out there then!
---
LITERALLY AFK FUCKING TEAM.
---
NO ONE UNHOOKS PEOPLE.

NO ONE HEALS.

NO ONE DOES FUCKING GENS.

I'M PRETTY SURE NO ONE'S DOING FUCKING TOTEMS.

ASH IS RUNNING BUCKLE UP, FLIP-FLOP, UNBREAKABLE, AND DARK SENSE.  
---
JANE IS RUNNING SLIPPERY MEAT, POISED, DEJA VU, AND FUCKING SMALL GAME.

SAID JANE WITHOUT SELF CARE RUNS ACROSS THE LITERAL ENTIRE MAP AFTER I UNHOOK HER WHEN I HAVE WE'LL MAKE IT AND A GOOD MEDKIT.
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR FUCKING ASS

THIS IS RANK FUCKING 8 NOT RANK 80.

P.S. WHY DOES HITTING A HOOKED SURVIVOR WITH A HATCHET STOP THE UNHOOKING ANIMATION?

With how the game is right now, I'm not even sure I can be assed to open up DBD to take advantage of this.
---
You gonna elaborate or is this just bait?
---
You are dumb because you get angered by me being better at a game than you
---
I'm not defending anything, but I don't think shortening the grind for perks in DbD is pay to win. I don't like pay to win games and will not buy them, but DbD isn't pay to win :p
---
Ouch. You‚Äôre on Reddit. You can only expect a spoiler somewhere
---
I wanna pet him.
---
That's a visual bug. It jumps to 3 once a gen is completed.
---
crawldette
---
It may not do anything but I don't see anyone else coming up with something better that's not hilariously survivor-sided or comically killer-sided.  This would give the killer an edge when fighting for the final gen.  Especially with my version of Ruin.
---
8 PM *EST*? The hell?
---
I don't play console but I feel like it'd be too much of a hassle to do so on console

Gotcha. Well thanks for explaining to me! I can see where that could be a boring game for the killers side with everything more easily laid out for survivor groups. I do have to disagree with gen rushing as it is the survivors objective to finish gens, so I never saw the point of people calling it gen rushing. That‚Äôs pretty cool that you see patterns with SWF about their perks and who dc‚Äôs and who doesn‚Äôt, I would have never thought that.
---
*puts on my robe and wizard hat*
---
THERE WAS NO BATTLEPASS "IDEA". IT WAS A SURVEY.
---
COSMETICS DON'T REALLY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE GAME UNLESS YOU WANT THE KILLER TO SEE YOUR PINK HAIR AND KILL YOU FASTER.
---
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU THINK EITHER OF THESE INDICATE GREED.

well you're wrong
---
Claudette looks fit in her new outfit üòç
---
I got it on shelter woods (shocking, I know)
---
\*inhales\* (*MAYBE FIX THE FUCKING GAME FIRST!!!!!)* \*exhales\* sure that'd be cool bro
---
Please no. I LOVE this perk and it has never left my build. It's a non-immersion based stealth perk and has let me escape so many chases. Loop the killer around a pallet, gen pops, drop pallet and get away. 
---
Adrenaline + Poised is also godlike against tunneling/NOED killers
---
*puts on tiny robe and wizard hat for meat sceptre*
---
You can buy like 1 second if you the killer has to walk over to you
---
I strongly agree with you, this is a way better idea.
---
Better regression would be pretty helpful. Honestly regression now does nothing by itself. Me kicking a gen looking for who is fixing it then leaving because I literally cant waste time to look around for too long even if I know they are there somewhere is a joke. People know what they are doing that's skill. If 4 people are doing that good luck.
---
I had this same bug...
---
I wouldn‚Äôt bash our great Entity Nea, she‚Äôs always listening lol
---
Open wallet to skip content is pay to win, no matter how small or large.   By supporting the minor examples, you are encouraging more predatory models.  The devs are chasing shitty monetization streams, and this type of attitude will see us getting half the bloodpoints we get now, with a "boost" for sale to bring it to current levels.
---
Omg please do, this is great. On par with the drag race memes
---
I can‚Äôt find anything about it being the addons alone are bugged. 
---
They‚Äôre probably not patching it because either: 
---
A. They aren‚Äôt bugged on their own
---
Or B. It takes time to fix bugs, so they‚Äôre not fixing it in case it takes too long
---
Okay why is this guy forgetting to put the /s thing or whatever at the end of his comments it‚Äôs annoying and makes me think he‚Äôs serious
---
mine defintely wasnt skilled there was a claudette trying to get me to chase her as the rest immersioned poorly around the map because stridor
---
Completely disagree with your opinion. It‚Äôs not bad or lazy. It‚Äôs skillful. I‚Äôm literally risking losing the match by waiting in one spot. However, I‚Äôm able to still get 4/4 even when the gens get finished. I love the way I play, I play like a pro.
---
Second, what‚Äôs your instagram ;D
---
ThIS gAmE iS tRaSh AnD sO ArE yOu.
---
I'm sure they only say that to cover their ass. I find it hard to believe EAC is checking PNG content to see if it's been tampered. anti cheats really only ever check to see if you're running another program, or if another program is interacting with the game,
---
Seems they're catering to Europe, Asia and Australia for once, as opposed to the Americas.
---
You know that their weekly livestreams start around 4am here in Australia? Rather inconvenient.
---
the rogi mask by trapper was made by someone in the community
---
FPS the genre, not the frame rate.
---
If survivors don‚Äôt mend by the time the bar runs out, they are downed (similarly to borrowed time)
---
As for whether he‚Äôs a bad killer, he‚Äôs certainly not the best, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the worst. Somewhere around the middle thanks to him exerting a bit of map control and his heightened run speed.
---
Surprisingly there wasn't any haha
---
Gens are definitely objectives for killers as well as killing survivors.  Funny thing is the NOED apologists call totems objectives for survivors even though we have no means to track them yet you're saying the generators are not objectives for killers.  That's such a load of horseshit man.  Dude I take out dulls everytime I see them but I soloqueue mostly and randoms don't.  I can't be reasonably expected to take out all 5 myself every game.  I average 3 to 4 and still eat NOED regularly.  In soloqueue games terrible killers that need to run the crutch can and will get their totem to proc and get that last mindless down endgame.  It's a tool for lazy and/or bad killers that can't be bothered with learning the mechanics of the game to get their kills without it.
---
Why dont we just delete survivors? That would be fair.
---
They announced it on the last stream.
---
ignore everything i say then i guess
---
Isn't the steam forums more mentally challenged than Bubba Sawyer?  Like, incoherent fear yelling that sounds like what I imagine a yeti being chased by bees ?
---
Yeah Freddy has no map control early on and if he has no add ons it‚Äôs basically a death sentence for him, except if he has the right perks and add ons then he can bring a total loss to a 2-3k if they‚Äôre smart/lucky
---
No they said report it. You just don't have to supply video evidence with it only report it at the end of the game.
---
Standing still isn‚Äôt a skill and neither is taking the risk that you‚Äôre playing against low ranks because you couldn‚Äôt get away with camping at high ranks
---
Ruin is just awful. I'm in-between green and purple ranks at any given time and every killer fucking runs it. Not running it just fucks you so hard.
---
woah
---
It's been patched in the Legion re-work that was on PTB. I think they just want to leave it for when that releases for everyone.
---
What the fuck is up with the hate? Some of us don't have internet connections that can handle pc play, so we play on ps4. God, don't hate just because we play on PS4.
---
Aftercare takes comparatively more work to set up and is too easily lost, imo.
---
No one has fun while playing dbd
---
Honestly I play ps4 version.  I migrated over after playing with a friend. For me the game seems less stressful as killer and I don't have to read toxic post game chat. Sure frame rate can chug now and then but its not a so try hard and toxic.
---
Xbox used to be WAAYYY worse with exclusive games and content. The only reason they aren‚Äôt now is because PlayStation is way more popular now. Plus PlayStation has bomb ass exclusives, so I‚Äôm not complaining.
---
I know and that's not the cases for everyone.
---
I FUCKING HATE SURVIVORS HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO CATCH THEM WHEN THEY CAN 360 AND SLIDE ACROSS PALLETS AND SHIT
---
What about PS4? I'm PS4!
---
I DOESN'T HAVE A HARD COUNTER. IF YOU MEAN DOING THE 5 TOTEMS THEN NOED BECOMES A WAY BETTER RUIN AND RUIN IS ALREADY PRETTY MUCH A MUST.
---
You dont need better internet for PC. The internet literally doesnt even make a difference?
---
If you really have to ask yourself if you're triggered, you might be. And the "I made a joke" bit tacked onto the end of you being an ass doesn't do anything for you. You made a shitty comment because you're a shitty person. This doesn't even involve me and I'm triggered by how much of twat you are.
---
I think there should be one tbh, maybe like a 5 second cooldown after a few crouch‚Äôs
---
The official stance is that BHVR won't ban you by hand, but IF eac triggers off of it, they aren't going to unban you, either.
---
meme aside, This would be the kind of corny shit that would actually make me stop playing unless they gave an option to disable player made skins
---
&lt;3
---
Then its B. In case it takes too long to fix it, they‚Äôre not doing it as if it was fast they wouldve fixed it now, before Legion changes come
---
"Used to", yes used to. And it has nothing to do with Playstation, it's the fact that Microsoft saw potential in bringing their exclusives to the PC market, and its brought them A LOT of money. Exclusivity shouldn't be a thing, period.  Again, fuck Sony.
---
I had the same thing happen to me a couple days ago.
---
Had to power cycle everything
---
TY guys. I'm still learning how to be an efficient killer!
---
LMFAO SHIT SURVIVOR MAINS SAY
---
That's not really a downside it's just a requirement that in order to activate the perk you have to down and hook someone.
---
It does for me. I've tried pc play. My internet doesn't support it good.
---
They could do competitions where that best fan made cosmetics get added to the game.
---
I don‚Äôt understand what you guys mean by spoiler tag??? I‚Äôm new to Reddit. I just post my memes on Instagram and I can give warnings there. I said sorry because spoilers
---
It's in 27 hours. It's currently May 1st for PST.
---
She's obviously performing CPR but really wrong.
---
It happens most of the time players tbag at gate. Sure, they‚Äôre tbagging, but most of the time they WANT you to get that free hit
---
Where's the Haddonfield music?
---
‚ÄúReverse CPR‚Äù
---
Black Box is the worst add-on in the game, change my mind.
---
Im a PS4 Player :)
---
True. I don't want to be all "*That's racist!"* but Feng does deserve more variation-themed costumes.
---
That is true. It's just my personal prefence out of all of them.
---
I dont mind it if the other survivors with me isnt constantly missing their greats though and I find that survivors who actually attempt to do gens through ruin tend to hit most of their greats, but not always.
---
Could you post the stun sound please?
---
I did not know the devs talked about it. That‚Äôs super interesting. I just feel like talking strat is part of the game as survivors can talk before the game in chat to figure out how to start the game. I didn‚Äôt say this in my post but I also think voice comms with my friends just make the game more fun for me as we usually don‚Äôt take the game very seriously and we can be goofs in the game. If I didn‚Äôt chat with them i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be as fun for me personally. Thanks for commenting, I‚Äôm gonna definitely check out what the devs say on this matter and such.
---
I BOUGHT MYERS AS MY FIRST DLC KILLER, AND IN MY FIRST 3 GAMES OF PLAYING HIM I GOT COLDWIND FARM 3 TIMES IN A ROW, NO OFFERINGS. 
---
WHY THE FUCK CAN'T YOU STALK THROUGH LIKE 3 FEET OF CORN.
---
Its player choice, but I hate it when i run from the killer and instead of being smart and going for the ones who are easier to get, they keep coming after me and then camp when they finally catch me because all the gens are done. Its bullshit. I just want a fair game man, not a fuck fest of dissapointment.
---
If I‚Äôm gonna die I‚Äôm gonna look fabulous while doing so
---
I disagree with the "too niche."
---
First of all Tales From the Crypt is a huge name in horror. Not sure who owns the rights to it (prob HBO) but if someone were to reboot the anthology show or make a movie based on it, having a tie-in with a successful video game would be helpful.
---
Also, licensing the rights to something lesser known would likely be less expensive than the bigger names. The horror genre is full of property that if licensed on the cheap could provide a lot of content for DbD.
---
Most of the time toxicity is referring to if survivors are playing a game of hide-and-seek but not doing gens, then one of them slips up and gets hooked, then they all proceed to t-bag, flashlight spam, and bodyblock in that order. It's usually followed by a rude message.
---
This is exactly what I was hoping the link led to
---
doing gens is the most boring shit in this game so whats the point in making them slower? if you really wanna give killers more time you should give cool objectives for survivors that require time but arent m1 holding till bar is full yay.
---
Yeah in YOUR case but not everyones.
---
Boy I‚Äôm rank 9 rn and still getting 4/4. Watch when I get to rank 1, ill get 10/4
---
There can be ways to prevent that like you cannot cancel an emote, once you start it and you have to wait for it to finish, and the emote animation makes you exposed.
---
Just an idea, maybe its too much idk
---
Tomorrow at 8:00 PM EST or 5:00 PM PST.

If you live on the east coast it will be 8 o'clock in the evening. 5 o'clock in the afternoon if you are west coast.
---
I sure am jealous of the 30 FPS underpowered hardware that can't even handle basic anti-aliasing or render objects more than 30 feet.
---
Ugh, I don‚Äôt see how they could ever have fun being jerks to random people online like that. Makes sense that voice comms and SWF would make that 100% worse.
---
Exactly it's more OP, but for a reason
---
DEAR MEG WHO WAS BUTT DANCING FOR FIVE MINUTES AT THE RIDICULOUS IRONWORKS LOOP, I HOPE BMING ME INSTEAD OF WORKING ON A GENERATOR AND ACTUALLY BEING USEFUL TO YOUR TEAM WAS WORTH IT.
---
Adrenaline and toolboxes just destroys slugging
---
WE ARE ALL PS4
---
Of course survivors think it's a "healthy" perk, it's one of the weakest perks in the game for killer. 
---
That's like killers getting together and saying Dance with Me is a "healthy" perk. Yeah, because it sucks.
---
Is your argument now that game's look better on Xbox?
---
Nobody left behind
---
Nobody.
---
So basically... neo skin users are single ?
---
That's a major downside to peer to peer connections.  Dedicated servers should prevent them from grabbing your up address.
---
I mean, we already payed for the game. We already payed for additional characters. Some people payed for additional cosmetics. You know damn well that most people bought the Leatherface DLC purely for the BBQ perk because it's been on the Shrine exactly twice since it was released.
---
Rather than paying to catch up, or encouraging them to enshrine the current grind by adding the option to pay-to-skip-the-grind, we should be lobbying for them to reduce the grind.
---
I get that devs are afraid to have 0 progression in their games these days. People don't play games just for fun anymore and without that dopamine hook you'll lose your audience. But it doesn't need to take hundreds and hundreds of hours to even approach getting half the perks on most of the killers in the game.
---
MK11 has some exploit going around right now where you can skip all of the grinding by just spamming a button in a crypt or something (I'm fuzzy on the details). But none of that content is even behind a paywall. People are losing their minds because they get access to the content that they've payed for before they spent dozens or hundreds of additional hours earning the right to use it.
---
I'm sure there are some people who legit think this would be pay-to-win, but they're missing the point. This is a horrible precedent for BHVR to set and all but guarantees that they will never address the bloodweb system.
---
Yeah I liked most of the ideas they pitched
---
This was not one of the ideas
---
There should be a way to edit the post and Mark it as a spoiler so that it blurs it for people scrolling past it
---
There‚Äôs nothing inherently toxic about SWF, but most toxic players will play SWF because it‚Äôs easy mode and allows them to jerk around and try to piss off the killer.
---
People need to show more respect in this game. Some people are bad winners/losers. If a killer did good I tell them, no need for drama.
---
White = regressing. If they hit 0% they go red again
---
We try to challenge the killers we go against, but most of the time we just goof it up with our Kate and Laurie lol hopefully the survivors are treating you right out there and challenging you. Thanks for commenting!
---
I got it! Thank you. Again I‚Äôm sorry
---
Oh hell no. All games look TERRIBLE on console. But at least Microsoft gives the option of getting their exclusives on PC so I can run a game on a higher framerate than most twitter gifs.
---
[Here](https://www.tickcounter.com/countdown/1164773/bloodhunt-may-2nd-may-6th) is the countdown for those interested
---
You need more killers playing to fix it.
---
I MEAN, WHY ?
---
And even a BP multiplier... With how many people have so many BP and filled inventories of rare items that they just dc the second a game turns bad, it'll do more for newer players than vets
---
They don‚Äôt really give a shit abt console, it‚Äôs generally worse to play on
---
You‚Äôre literally an idiot lol. The games are on PC because Microsoft has almost EVERYTHING to do with PC‚Äôs.... Sony has all the exclusive content NOW because they‚Äôre better than Xbox, whereas Xbox used to be better than Ps4 but they‚Äôre not anymore.
---
You have to kick the gen for it to turn white. It will turn yellow when someone touches it
---
r/suddenlycommunist
---
Show me exactly where they ask if we want pay to win.
---
The risk is letting them get away because they did the gens while I camped one person. I‚Äôm still able to camp one person while 4 gens get done AND get the rest, or at least 2 more before the end. Skill. Most campers would get blindsided and probably lose their hooked victim and get 0/4. Not me boi. 4/4, 3/4 guaranteed
---
Dead by daylight on steam community page where people can post stuff
---
I hated this too. Ended up just deleting it from my files. Actually boosted my startup time quite a lot. Win win.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel is terrible.
---
Too OP please nerf
---
So it‚Äôs just a magnet for the bad killers. That sucks that people have to be toxic and ruin good things for people. I guess I wouldn‚Äôt call it easy mode, but I guess it makes it easier for survivors depending on the killer.
---
THAT ALSO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ME I WAS GOING FOR ADEPT ON PS4
---
I reported someone for it with video evidence and the support told me you don't need the video just report them end of the game and they know and will do something. Whether they mean it who knows lol.
---
no it's not, it's one of my favorite perks.
---
WHAT DIDN‚ÄôT HAVE A HARD COUNTER WAS PRE FIX LEGION. NOED HAS SO MANY COUNTERS AND WEAKNESSES

Perhaps it might be some apps in the background causing it. See what you have and close anything you can before you play the game. Verify integrity of the game catche if you haven't and probably do a factory reset of your router, google how to do it, very easy, check anything related to network connection which might help. You didn't give us much to start with except the issue you're having though.
---
How about instead of releasing new skins or killers, they fix this broken, unplayable game? I know I'm gonna get downvoted for saying it, but you all know it's true.
---
The timer doesn't last long enough for anyone, but Billy and Nurse to really use it. And you have to find a Gen with enough progress to make it worth it. If it gave stacks it'd be far better. Might even use it over Ruin.
---
 u/VredditDownloader
---
What's with the ad hominem? You realize you lose the argument when you insult someone right? You realize PS4 makes game exclusive to stay relevant right? They don't bring games to PC because their gaming side of the company would die out.
---
I use a modded version of the one most streamers use (although I can‚Äôt remember the name off hand), however I‚Äôve ran all of mine through filters and edits to make them unique and look a little more sci fi than they were.

Go do the survey and find it yourself. It doesn't take much to find out what they're really asking. Think from a company point of view of why you'd be asking those questions.

I literally just drop em grab hatchets then pick up. Unless it's that random basement locker find, rare, but happens.

Currently: SWF is strong and promotes toxicity

Remove SWF: No reason to play because I cannot play with friends

Add Voice Chat: Everyone is getting too smart game is hard
---
Community is torn and the dev's can only choose the lesser evil which is probably do nothing because people will complain anyways. But if they added a change it will only bring more attention to our dilemma making people even more angry.It's the nature of an asymmetrical game mode. Right now I'd prefer if they didn't add voice chat because I enjoy the craziness and retardation. Don't want people playing crazy efficient like they are some navy seal special ops 101st squadron commando chasing the killer around changing the name from dead by daylight to alive by sundown. Just my opinion.

How long are you doing nothing for my dood?

Fourth survivor must be a P3 Claudette. That explains the invisible icon.
---
I see your point but people will just spin in circles or moonwalk . there is just people who will want to BM. I stopped caring about TB at gates. I do tunnel TB some times just to make team think I will always as a mind game.   I have got a fee pulls off gens because they thought for sure I was going after TB bait. Remember to be the one in charge of flow of the game. If they try to frustrate you and you allow it then they win. I personally don't TB at gates but if it was a good game and killer was cool why not let him get some points at game. Yesterday we all made it to gates and let clown chase us and hit with bottles and he understood and even if he did get a person down he let the heal go and knee game was over but he appreciated the free bp.
---
If you're having trouble finding a lobby, there might not be enough killers to go around.
---
Well, I don't have this issue so I wouldn't be so quick with conclussions. If it happens as often as you make it out to be then it could be something on your side.
---
C'MERE, BOY!
---
Then you haven't been around here long. They do these surveys every now and again and the only thing they do with them is tweak the store or what is being offered with real world transactions. If you can't connect the dots that's your fault. I'm not here to play journalist. Do it yourself kid.

Xbox is owned by Microsoft, who also owns Windows, the most popular PC operating system. They aren't being as generous as you think.

Obviously they‚Äôd have to be reviewed and approved by BHVR like how Warframe sells player-made cosmetics.

I‚Äôm all for it.

I hooked each survivor 2 or 3 times and sacrificed all 4

If the tunnels and camping stopped maybe the disconnections wouldn't happen as often.

Doing the same thing monotonously over and over again is very uncreative, yes. Me run around pallet #7, killer get too close, me drop pallet, repeat. I would like some things other than pallets and window vaults [which aren't that safe all things considered, although DWM+Lithe+Q&amp;Q+Lightweight is pretty fun] at this point. The only thing I can even think of is the occasional wall juke, which almost never happens at high ranks.
---
IT JUST SUCKS HARD THAT FREDDYS RARELY GET TO USE NOED ANYWAY SINCE EVERYONE KNOWS HE WILL USE IT, SO THEY END UP DOING ALL THE TOTEMS

I'VE HAD A SHITTON OF PEOPLE ACCUSE OF DOING SWF AND THEN NOT BELIEVE US WHEN WE SAY WE WEREN'T. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SURVIVORS WHO JUST STRATEGIZE WELL. IVE HAD GAMES WITH SOLOS WHERE WE WERE MORE ORGANIZED THAN GAMES IVE PLAYED WITH MY FRIENDS
---
Maybe people dont enjoy playing killer?
---
for sure! it is really good!!
---
BUT HOW WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT THEIR FAVORITE SHOWS AND MOVIES ARE?
---
I PLAY ON PS4 AND I MESSAGE EACH AND EVERY NURSE I PLAY LETTING THEM KNOW HOW COOL IT IS THAT PEOPLE PLAY NURSE ON PS4 AND THAT I THINK VERY HIGHLY OF THEM AND HOPE THAT THEY STICK WITH IT. I HATE WHEN PEOPLE BRING NEGATIVITY TO THE KILLER WITH THE HIGHEST SKILL FLOOR IN THE GAME
---
Exclusivity only has any value to people who want to lord something over others. 
---
We already have one set of exclusive items for the original characters (the old prestige outfit) and honestly that's more than enough but if they did more I hope they'd be in a similar fashion (just the default cosmetic but altered).
---
As I said in my first comment, I'm cool with there being another progression system for cosmetics (like the prestige we already have) but I don't want anything to be completely miss-able. If that means they do a battle pass and then put all the outfits in the store for auric cells after, that'd be great (same as how they've done the current event cosmetics).

WIGGLING YOUR ARMS WHEN KILLERS NEAR MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND IS ALL YOU NEED. 
---
IF SOMEONE GETS MAD AT YOU CAUSE YOU CAN'T COUNT/READ HIS WAVING MORSE CODE - HE DESERVED TO DIE.

No, stop with that bullshit of skins, the game needs focus on more important issues
---
Darn

I JUST LOST MY FLASHLIGHT WITH AN ODD BULB TO A KILLER WHO DC'D AT THE END OF A 2K GAME WHERE HE HAD AT LEAST 8 HOOK ACTIONS AND PLAYED PRETTY WELL CONSIDERING HE WAS A RANK 13 FREDDY AGAINST AN 11, 9, 9, 8.
---
WORST OF ALL I USED A BLACK WARD!!!! SO IF I DIE I KEEP IT BUT NOT IF THE KILLER QUITS? FUCK'S SAKE.
---
ITS UP TO YOU, HERO, TO PASS IT ON IN POST GAME LOBBIES.
---
ITS HOW WE'LL ALL LEARN.
---
I know I'm super late to the party, but thanks for finally adding my main Quentin to one of your awesome memes :D
---
Obviously dude... just dumb and a waste of perk spot I dont think some new killers realize it.
---
Yea but killer can get 30k without any bp perks and then more with bbq and bp addons, all the while having a good fun game.
---
Seems like you can‚Äôt dodge chainsaws
---
No need for calling him names my man, let's keep it civil. And sony being "better" is a matter of opinion.
---
Wait is there more to this? Like did y'all have fun farming or something? I like to know the details of such positive interactions please.
---
Slugging isn't a cheese tactic. DC-ing so your teammate can get the hatch is, instead of risking that you both might die (oh no!)
---
Ah yea for sure, I just meant it sucks we don't get the same points for Moris, or Insta downs. I get why, but it makes builds like that, only for rainy days. I just had one as the spirit, the purple add-on for no sounds, and irricent for super fast but no scratch marks. I pulled survivors off gens/totems maybe 6 or 7 times. I got like no points because there was barely any chase time or hits :p buts it was about the jump scares
---
DC-ing isn't "adapting", lmao.
---

---
These are one of those hits that I understand why it hit me, but I don't feel good about it.
---
Ehhh, last weeks shrine was decent at best.
---
It contained the worst survivor perk, the worth exhaustion perk before the introdcution of Head-On. And 2 okay killer perks, one of which is unlocked as early as L30.
---
Not to mention that all the perks belonged to base characters, so you only really saved yourself a weekend of grinding.

I GUESS BY SPOILING EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE. IT‚ÄôS THE WORLDS LARGEST TEXT

Ughhhh why can‚Äôt they make it an entire week :( I work tomorrow night-Sunday night and I work 12‚Äôs so I won‚Äôt even be able to play until Monday

While wearing the helmet, all hits landed on survivors instantly put them into dying but if someone drops a pallet on you, you get put into dying.

MAN, I'VE BEEN PLAYING A TON OF KILLER LATELY AND HITTING THE POINT WHERE I CAN'T RANK UP ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY SWF WITH COMS OR SOMEONE QUITS IMMEDIATELY AND I GET SCREWED OUT OF SHARDS.  DECIDED TO TRY OUT SURVIVOR AGAIN AND HAVE GONE AGAINST TRYHARD LF IN A 3V1, A FACECAMPING LF, AND A TUNNELING WRAITH SO FAR.  WAY TO REMIND ME WHY I STILL HAVE FAR MORE SYMPATHY FOR SURVIVORS.
---
I‚Äôm helping Jane by body shaming her. Hopefully she will lose weight and be able to run faster from the killer. You are killing her thanks dickhead. I care about Jane, you don‚Äôt. You want her to die!!!! Fuck you dude!!!!
---
It happened to me too, made the game unplayable, couldn't run sideways or backwards, I had to keep my camera straight and never strafe or go backwards
---
You could‚Äôve said ‚ÄúTunnel me down-‚Äú to stick closer to the original ‚ÄúStrike me down-‚Äú.
---
Pro tip for anyone who's the not hooked person when someone cramps like this. Stop wasting your time at hook and go do gens.
---
It takes 2 minutes for the person on the hook to die. Gens take 80 seconds. If all three people work gens you can get 3 gens done and have another three half way done just from the time at the hook. If it takes the killer a minute to hook the person that they camp then that gives you enough time complete every gen.
---
Oh my bad F

This is the internet bruh. When you want someone to do something, don't tell or ask them to.

This is why I love the community
---
This is how you get 0k with anyone except billy &amp; nurse unfortunately.
---
Wait, how can you delete it? And isn‚Äôt it dangerous to change the files?
---
Most console players or on PS4. It's not about hating PS4, it's just that the ones who make the memes just didn't think of the Xone.
---
Go stand in the corner with Frank.
---
Hard disagree. Nurse has to guess every time survivors break LoS. Lery's gives a lot of chances to break LoS.
---
#[**ACE FINGER GUNS !!!!!**](/intensifies)
---
camping means being on the map when a survivor   is hooked
---
lol what? nah I‚Äôm not selfish
---
Both sides have bullshit perks.  If you use Adrenaline, DH, BT, DS, MoM, or any other second chance perks, you're just as trashy as a killer who uses NOED.
---
Oh my God you have a Dance Gavin Dance mask. +100 respec
---
Oh uh, Haha no I dont know what that is actually, but cool idea
---
The Congregation of Ducks deems it so. But for all seriousness, I've seen this hiccup in the system once or twice when a killer lags out of the game.
---
my shock cock hard
---
You‚Äôre probably right, I thought he rage quit bc we popped 3 gens back to back but he hit someone immediately before the DC so I don‚Äôt think they had time in between hitting someone and leaving the match on their own
---
i‚Äôm in this image and i like it
---
That's ricardo myers
---
I am saying its their fault because it exists, these aren‚Äôt super hard to reproduce and a little testing and work could have stopped it.  We hold moms responsible if they dont try to stop their kids from drinking bleech, but not devs from taking time to test their shit?
---
just remove dead hard and add an insta heal
---
Bamboozle still doesnt help with the car shed infinite or the red barn infinite or the myers house infinite.
---
Was just messing around with Sharefactory on PS4 since when I tried to upload the match through video trim, it froze up on me. Thought this music kind of worked well which was in Sharefactory, so yeah! Enjoy, hopefully :D
---
I stopped using them cuz I literally haven't had a game for the last 3 months where all gens are done...
---
Survivors uh,  find a way.
---
Given some of the questions asked about how we would feel, namely;
---
&gt; A purchasable pass that grants bonus and rewards over a defined period of time
---
and
---
&gt;More in-game customization options like animated emote, voice lines, loading screens, icons, etc.
---
I think it's safe to say BHVR is heavily considering a season/battle pass like we've seen in Fortnite and Apex.
---
Which is really fucking weird.
---
I'm just going to remove myself from this earth because people are overanalyzing a shit post
---
Gotcha! I originally thought he rage quit bc we popped 3 gens before he hit anyone.
---
i can absolutely attest for this ;)
---
Really disappointed with the Kate. Her cosmetic selection is pretty sparse and she won't get anymore cosmetics soon.
---
Interesting i didnt know that, however if a killer knows you asre in a locker you're fucked anyway because you can locker catch you in the animation.
---
Are the new cosmetics out already?
---
But for real.
---
Some guy yelled at me post match for being an idiot because he was trying to tell me he had a key and to go to the hatch after unhooking me. 
---
Except from my POV on the hook, he was just teabagging the ground/waving and I assumed he wanted me to kill myself so he could escape (I was on my first hook and the last gen was like 95%, he hadn't been hooked yet either).
---
I dunno, I get lobby dodged all night long when Im playing solo.
---
Probably go through 2-3x more lobbies than games as a solo survivor because the killer sees something they dont like (3+ toolboxes or flashlights) and just takes the easy way out.
---
Maybe they can't hot fix it? The problem might be more complicated than we know. Just because the opportunity is there to cheat doesn't mean we should take it. There is an exploit to have multiple killers that I believe uses SWF somehow so with your thinking they should just disable that till its fixed but that would ruin a lot of peoples fun. As someone pointed out on this thread the add-ons on their own are ok.
---
Maybe they want to create their own store like Epic... /s

---
Steam comments and forums are a retched hive of scum and degeneracy. It's like 99 percent of people there are legitimately mentally challenged and its sad.
---
An hour is terrible...  Hope when you got one it was decent.  Are there less dc's there?  Like are the games appreciated more because of the wait?
---
You sound like Jendenise thinking franklins is toxic. Franklins is a situational perk that you should use as killer when you see stacked loadouts.
---
3 and 4 mans dc more in my opinion. If a killer isn't easy to play against they won't play vs it at all or if they actually give it a chance, they play vs him only if he's bad at the killer. If something goes wrong they dc. 3 mans are worse tho when they dc because they screw over a rando. When I get a killer who lets me escape in 1v1s I love them because it happens so little (which is why i just walk up to a hook and have em kill me).
---
Here come the bikinis and topless men.
---
I dont think they have time to test every single item combination before releasing anything
---
oh shit, seriously? thanks :O
---
Completely missed welcome to DBDL

Thank you so much! I love your style, I really do hope you make more. :)

Thank you.

We can come up with a lot of suggestions,  they don't and would never care about them. You can see this through the years this game has been out. Even to this day the hitboxes are a real mess and they are releasing cosmetics like mad. I don't want to know what's next.

The video is in the game files. Just look through the folders until you find it then delete it. EAC doesn't check that so it's fine.

ALSO IT'S ONE LAST FUCK YOU TO THE KILLER AND WASTES THEIR TIME

I ALWAYS DO IT BECAUSE I'M A PETTY BITCH

yes please punish me for getting kicked out of the match thanks
---
It‚Äôs a quality shit post since I actually did that.
---
- Deliverance from hook
---
- Get tunneled and downed
---
- Get grabbed and DS escaped
---
- Get tunneled til Adrenaline proc
---
- Get second hit
---
- Get third hit but MoM triggered 
---
- Used insta-heal in front of killer 
---
- Get hit again but already reached the exit gate
---
Killer cried then DC after I left. GG
---
Not my proudest fap
---
Which makes it works. Also, wouldn't you care if someone took your shit from one site posted it on another as their own? That'd fucking sucks
---
np!

i believe fps affects sensitivity. its annoying af. happens to survivor too. just an engine problem.

THIS ALSO SOMEWHAT APPLIES TO PEOPLE WHO RUN ALL TOP TIER TRYHARD PERKS. THAT'S OKAY, BUT YOU SHOULD EXPECT THE SAME.

Doesn't bother me in the slightest. If someone were to dodge a fellow survivor over 1 perk choice, they aren't somebody I want on my team to begin with.

Everyones saying it remind them of some dude from hotline Miami but I have no idea what that is Haha, I just fucking adore the idea of a motorcycle helmet on them, it just sounds so cool
---
Lucky you, when  killers do that for me their profile is privated :(
---
Which part about Legion was bullshit, might I ask? The changes to him in the recent PTB make him a less cancerous killer without actually putting him in the dumpster. He's mid-tier, not actually bad, and against survivors that heal he's even above average.
---
I‚ÄôVE LEARNED THAT I HAVE TO TOE THE LINE BETWEEN WANTING TO WIN AND WANTING TO HAVE FUN. I‚ÄôM SUPER LIMITED IN MOST KILLER BUILDS BECAUSE THE GAME ENDS TOO QUICKLY WITHOUT RUIN AND I NEED BP SO I RUN BBQ. THAT ONLY LEAVES TWO PERKS. BUT WHAT IF I WANT TO RUN HUNTRESS LULLABY, PGTW, BRUTAL STRENGTH, AND OVERCHARGE TO SEE IF I CAN RESET A GEN TO 0? OR JUST ANY NUMBER OF MEME BUILDS?
---
WHEN I CAN GO IN TRYING TO HAVE FUN BUT NOT EXPECTING TO WIN I HAVE MORE FUN BUT DO WORSE. ITS A TOSS UP

And on days like these, survivors like you...
---
***Shouldn't ask what Frank and Joey and doing in order for this to exist***
---
looks more like the killer misses his attack and the attack sound that hit you was actually you failing a skillcheck
---
Michael's are the best, undisputed. The only one that's "bad" per se is Vanity Mirror.
---
That's not the case for everyone just because you have a lot of survivors give you a free hit doesn't mean that most survivors do. For someone else they have the opposite. Your experience doesn't mean everyone's.
---
booooooooooo
---
THE ONLY TIME I DONT LIKE NOED IS WHEN IM BEING CHASED FOR LIKE 3 GENS AND FAIL TO SHAKE THE KILLER BY THE TIME THE LAST ONE POPS AND GET DESTROYED BY IT. LOSING TWO HEALTH STATES REALLY HURTS, BUT THAT EXTRA SPEED BOOST IS WHAT ALWAYS GETS ME. EVEN THEN, I DONT HATE IT I JUST HATE THE CARDS I WAS DEALT
---
I wouldn't consider it selfish at that point. But I respect that.

Yeah dude I want to, in one of those who had like rare but huge spurts of inspiration, I'm working on drawing and fleshing out an entire killer concept that I want full art for and somehow I'm going to try and get simulated gameplay, like that's how amped I am for it, but its def going to be a process, maybe you'll see it in the future
---
Yup. Saw it in the last two weeks with my boyfriend. Quite humorous, nothing that we regret watching.
---
I personally have no opposition to giving demographical information, but I understand people's desire for privacy, that being said, at least in this case you have the option. (There was an N/A option for almost every single question)
---
Cooler older brother
---
To clarify, this is how I rate the addons on how well they do they're job.  The purpose of an addon IMO is to not only improve a killer but also provide variances to a killer's playstyle. Obviously nurse's addons are dumb but they offer no real change to nurse's gameplay. You still blink and hit.  Myers and wraith addons make them wbere there are multiple ways to play. For example Wraith can choose to focus on defending gens and patroling the map or mainting strong power in a chase. Myers can focus on knowing where survivors are and jumpscaring them, or finding several survivors instantaneously with T3 charge addons and Infectious Fright etc.

---
I really do have no idea what the hotline Miami thing is, and huntress already has a wolf mask? I'm so lost dude haha
---
Is your name Stop Booli Me? üòÅ
---
YOU DO YOU, BUT THE KILLER NEEDS TO KNOW IF HE'S JUST GONNA CAMP - YOU'RE GONNA TELL EVERYONE TO JUST STAY AWAY AND WORK ON THOSE GENS IN PEACE.
---
Huntress has nothing to do with this.
---
Dude fuuuuuuuuck, I saw them like 5 months ago, they were coming back to San Antonio again, and I wanted to see them again so bad, but of course some shit has to come up, I was so mad, legit I'm thinking of taking a road trip and going to the Denver show that's coming up
---
Drops survivor to mori
---
Devour breaks before you can start the mori animation
---
Last gen pops and the survivor you dropped yeets away with adrenaline
---
This. One missed hex skillcheck affects everyone on the gen. Ruin = solo gens

Thanks man

---
RED RANK SOLO PLAYER HERE IF I SEE YOU SPAMMING M1 THERE IS NO WAY I AM GETTING OFF THIS GEN. SPAM M1=KILLER NEAR BY FAKE KOBE ATTEMPT= NO ONE IS COMING PLEASE COME GET ME.
---
I consider Rusty Shackles and/or Mint Rag as a different playstyle, and those are effective used properly.  Plus, bodyblocker hag isnt terrible on small maps.  Obviously teleporting would be better but it's still a different playstyle.
---
I RESPECT IT
---
IT'S YOUR KEYBOARD, MAN
---
I don't think you're far off. The sound leak had me thinking Jack the Ripper or Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde.
---
Your explaining references to something I dont know lol

It's like me telling you, shit man we should add another Legionaire for Jon Mess and his mori would be his lines from Head Hunter or Lightning
---
The comic one looks really cool. I can imagine The Legion being in a cartoonish looking outfit with that mask.
---
And then they yell out you for slugging.
---
^(To be fair, you're being more clear than I am.)
---
Oh shit like black and white cell shades, now that would be bad ass
---
In all seriousness though it's a dope little detail
---
STOP CRAWLING TO ME INSTEAD OF HEALING EITHER HEAL UP FULLY OR DON'T COME NEAR ME. I AM FED UP OF PEOPLE RATTING OUT MY HIDING SPOT WHEN I AM DEAD ON HOOK AMD THE LAST PERSON IN THE GAME. FUCK OFF AN DIE OR HEAL UP SO I CAN HEAL YOU.
---
Hell yeah!That would be cool.
---
Saw this suggested last year and got a phenomenal response. Absolutely agree.
---
Never thought of that. Great idea.
---
How could you not like to play against a 3 blinks/ 5 blinks nurse tsk git gud
---
CAN CONFIRM I PLAY SOLO SURVIVOR AT RED RANKS AMD GET ACCUSED OF SWF ALL THE TIME. I USE BOND, PROVE THYSELF, ADRENALINE AND BALANCED LANDING. I USE BOND TO FIND OUT IF THE CHASE IS NEAR ME OR NOT AND TO GET ON GENS SO I GET CALLED A GEN RUSHING SWF A LOT WHEN IN FACT 90% OF THE TIME I AM PLAYING SOLO. ESPECIALLY IF I AM RANK 3 AND THE KILLER OS RANK 1.

(Turn sound on)
---
Go for the unhooker
---
Mint Rag is just an advanced camping tool, its only real use is to get MYC to proc then insta down the unhooker, which is super cheesy. Effective maybe, but unfun and unskillful. Bodyblocker hag yeah is worse than teleporting, it can be ok though I agree. 
---
I just feel like Hag should be on 'Decent addons, few that alter playstyle' because she only really has one that affects her playstyle, bodyblocker.
---
How was that a fast vault

---
Source Filmmaker.
---
Cant with MoM active. Hit the unhooker twice, MoM procs. Hit the hooked, borrowed time procs. There is no way to outplay it aside from an insta down
---
If they don't care about surviving then they are easy kills? I don't understand what the problem is.
---
&gt;usually they end up escaping anyway bc game is so easy for survivors.
---
Then they do care about surviving and are just playing better than you? I don't get the motive for dodging players who might be better than you, you will never going to get better at the game if you only play out games with potato survivors.

I HATE WHEN I RUN WMI AND THE SURVIVOR BOLTS ACROSS THE MAP. I UNDERSTAND NOT NECESSARILY WANTING TO BE HEALED AFTER BEING UNHOOKED EVEN IF THE KILLER IS BUSY BECAUSE IT COULD BE SEEN AS A WASTE OF TIME, BUT WITH WMI IT DOESNT TAKE LONG TO HEAL AND PROBABLY BUYS A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME IN CHASE
---
I love Claudette‚Äôs top tbh. And her hairstyle. Not a fan of dresses so I‚Äôm going for those two at some point!
---
Because the show has been cancelled

YAH I ALWAYS GET COLDWIND OR THE SWAMP WITH MYERS ALL THE FUCKING TIME! FUCKING HATE HOW THESE SCRUB DEVS DONT KNOW HOW TO CODE A GAME FOR SHIT!
---
Cause he can't see you  :-p
---
I didn't cry...
---
Im curious, in a game where the killer's goal is to kill people and "tunneling is bad", how is downing the unhooker bad skill?
---
Ok. That's sad. I was waiting for that juicy season 4.
---
Been closed for couple days now
---
Funny, that doesn't look like Legion
---
Instadowns don't work on MoM or BT.
---
YEAH I HAD A TTV ONE GAME COMPLAIN THAT I WAS TRYHARDING BECAUSE IT WAS A 3V1 AND I WAS SLUGGING FOR THE 3K IT'S LIKE IM NOT GOING EASY BECAUSE HALF OR MORE OF MY GAMES ARE 3V1S ??
---
SURE, THE FIRST 1 OR 2 GAMES IT HAPPENS ILL FARM. BUT BY 3RD? SCREW IT TRYHARD TIME MYBE HIDE IN THE CORNER SOON AS U POP THAT 2ND GEN  INSTEAD OF RUNNING OUT IN THE OPEN LOOKING FOR HATCH WHEN IT DIDNT SPAWN
---
&gt;no one else sees the change
---
Nobody else has to
---
Tunneling is still lame, however make your choice is literally the opposit of tunneling.  Plus as hag as my secondary main mint rag is more than just waiting for unhooks.
---
Well if you look at it that way the "rest of the world" gets it for a longer night on the 6th so it balances out. Who cares.
---
They totally should. Ive seen ideas where the more you prestige, the cheaper the bloodweb becomes.

I hope I'll see it cause now I'm hyped too!
