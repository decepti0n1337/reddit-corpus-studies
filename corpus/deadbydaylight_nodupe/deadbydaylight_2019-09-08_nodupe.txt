Can you be burned while uncloaked?

* Workshop Grease and Razor Wire actually indirectly helps the Survivors, since more skill checks means more chances for Greats. What's more is that they increase the chance for skill checks by 1% and 2% respectively which is goddamn pathetic.
---

---
* Amanda's Secret, to my understanding, is bugged.
---
She also has a ton of addons which are pretty much worthless. Broken Syringe is a crutch for bad players, Utility Blades and Face Mask are only useful in very specific builds, Interlocking Razor literally only works with one perk (Unnerving Presence) or against potatoes, Tampered Timer and Ruleset No. 2 are far too weak for their rarity, and Amanda's Letter is rather weak too. I made a [post about it](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ao7c57/pig_really_needs_some_addon_reworking/) awhile ago.
---
Just started playing, plus ebonys are common. And there's a special way to get the mobile version.
---
That's genius.
---
I'd say she didn't see you, probably because she was so focused on the other person. Nice work not panicking and running off.
---
Enduring was 75% resistance tho right?
---
Thanks for that information! Sadly I was uncloaked throughout the entire chase and during each stun.
---
Yeah, the short answer here is that every single change they make has a ripple effect that might break something else, and can be missed during 'simple' testing. Actual gameplay from large groups of people is the only way to find little bugs that you might not find when doing a 'standard checklist' of 'did this break'. This is what PTB is for.
---
Later in the game I died and she was right in front of me. I was in the struggle phase.
---
that's a wraith thing. if they shine a light on you(at all not just your face) while your cloaked or uncloaking it will burn you out of your cloak. this can also be done to nurse while charging her blink(and can prevent her from blinking) and should theoretically affect spirit(because her phase walk is going through the shadow realm or what the fuck ever the lore is, which is also how wraith cloaks and nurse blinks) but she's pretty much immune to flashlights cuz spirit lol
---
This has to be bait
---
i use dead hard and honestly doesn‚Äôt help in tunnelling situations, it helps make the chase longer but doesn‚Äôt stop the chase entirely, whereas i feel like BT can sometimes make a killer completely stop chasing you
---
I play pig a lot. Everyone gets one trap and I don‚Äôt patrol boxes unless there‚Äôs no one else to chase.  
---
You‚Äôre not alone though. Most pigs I face as survivor hard camp and tunnel. Defeats the whole purpose of her power.
---
But who cares about this? It‚Äôs just people trying to have fun lol
---
r/UnexpectedJojo
---
It can be in the beginning of chase's and loops but yeah still underpowered. Doesn't stop me from being Frank tho lol
---
yeah i‚Äôve only found it to be recent too, before hand i was kinda okay with it every now n then but recently i go 2/3 games in a row just straight up getting tunnelled
---
I took it yesterday
---
Just finishing the preparations for the next trial.
---
Woah, you can cancel Nurse's blinks? Thanks for this information!
---
Is that kinda holding the game hostage? Did you have to wait the whole 3 minutes to die?
---
VOCAL PERCUSSION
---
Except it's not. It gives you a safety net that you really shouldn't need. Either you can dominate to the endgame and make NOED pointless, are running an Endgame build which I personally see no point in on most killers, or you get the shit kicked out of you and then you get back up, dust yourself off, spend some bloodpoints, think "How could I have played better?", and then you repeat this until you get good enough that NOED is worthless to you. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You're not doing well for yourself, and you're certainly not doing anything to get better. You're only gaining a short term benefit that won't help you in the long run. And for a Hag build, if you're going for totems, you will want Devour Hope over NOED simply because either they bust Ruin and don't see Devour Hope coming with Haunted Grounds still up, bust Devour Hope and you keep your trump card of Ruin and Haunted Grounds is still active, or bust Haunted Grounds and give you the ability to oneshot people which enables Devour Hope and you keep Ruin. All of these are better options than NOED.
---
that feel when you would rather tongue freddy at make out point than even give Quentin a grandma cheek smooch
---
I stopped playing dbd for a Hour because of the Junpscare
---
Its the same for survivors, get used to it
---
Couldn't have said it better myself
---
pig main here, still shit :(
---
Wow there killer, that's OP
---
well what if it was something like chasing for 3 minutes with the nurse, I wouldnt be doing too hot lol
---
Pretty much, eventually picked me up, took me to the door, hit it a few times, dropped me and picked me up - kept doing until I could run, hit me until i died again... you know, standard fun game stuff :)
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so hard to balance this game. Four survivors who work well together, even without comms, and it‚Äôs survivor sided. One dumb ass and it shifts back to the killer.
---
id seriously advise you to not try it but good luck
---
I personally like Balanced Landing for the loops it can open up for you. Ex. Houses on Haddonfield, tractors on Coldwind, and the Factory on Ironworks.
---
But like some others said, some maps don't have any drop downs or it is just a hill.
---
Really it's down to how you play. I think Lithe has more potential to lose the killer while Balanced more extends chases.
---
The gen went from something to nothing 
---
üòî‚úä

üòîüëä
---
I remember that bug, me and a friend were talking about old bugs like that recently
---
on two occasions I got a skillcheck while searching a chest, it was very fast and didn't have any space to hit it and nothing happened when it went by.
---
[deleted]
---
Honestly I don't get it
---
Ps4- ingame
---
Frequently when I kick a gen as killer, it won‚Äôt give me the destruction (or whatev) points nor does the gen spark. It looks as if I did nothing to it.
---
Steps to reproduce- I‚Äôm not sure what triggers it as it seems to be random.
---
targeting?
---
I have yet to get a single flashlight save in my 145 levels worth of gameplay. But why do you advise against it?
---
You aren't in a chase when she crouches, because she's "hidden", otherwise when you're skulking around and you're following a survivor around the chase music would start and give you away
---
think it‚Äôs time to move on from being a toxic nea.... toxic Kate sounds better anyway
---
I would love an Elvira skin for Jane. I think it would fit her too
---
I think the drawings great I just think the killer himself is reminiscent of the botanical species..
---
They really do lol the worst is when I save someone at the last second in endgame who wasnt very good to begin with, block them, and they tbag at the killer like BRO GET TF OUT lolol you didnt earn this shitttt
---
Lol why does he have The Trapper's standing animation?
---
I sometimes play a 3 man SWF. They always say to let random die but I never do. I play enough solo to know how it feels to be left behind so I never let a teammate die, I go as far as to just trade with them and take the death instead.
---
Love my solo survivors.
---
Playing against SWF really isn‚Äôt as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Based on statistics, the largest number of SWF players are playing duo, and half the community is playing solo. So many of the killer perks give important information about where survivors are and what they‚Äôre doing. You also seem not to realize that you can actually use a SWF to your advantage, especially as a spirit or other high mobility killers (you start chasing someone you ‚Äúsuspect‚Äù to be in a SWF, they presumably will say that the killer is chasing them, which will cause the their friends to relax, but you can use that as a bait and switch to get them when they‚Äôre not expecting it). Even if voice communication wasn‚Äôt allowed/was prevented (which it‚Äôs not), a SWF would still be stronger than a bunch of randoms.... friends know how their friends play, and they can compensate for what the other can‚Äôt do. 
---
Also, some of y‚Äôall need to just get over it: sometimes you‚Äôre going to lose. You‚Äôre not going to win every single match you play. The game is designed so that is impossible (completely regardless of how everyone plays, RNG can swing the match completely in a way more powerful than any SWF). 
---
Also, you‚Äôre so wrong about it ‚Äúhurting the killers desire to play.‚Äù There‚Äôs a higher rate of killers queueing across all platforms (which is partly why survivor queue times take so long). Even having a ‚Äúbad‚Äù match as killer still earns you more points than an average match as survivor... lmao
---
Are you listening BHVR? Get in here, we got a thing for you to do.
---
This is fucking hilarious
---
Tunneling.
---
because it's nurse and she will fuck your asshole with your dumb little light stick.
---
So ... I mean... did it autocorrect for you when you tried to spell "insence"?
---
Crouching is 50% the speed
---
Targeting the Ace
---
I think so
---
This happened in-canon (more or less) and he was
---
This is personally why I'm against straight up nerfing survivors just because a small minority of 4 mans are really strong together.
---
I see just as many games turn into an easy 4k off of 1-2 mistakes just as often as I see them turn into 4 man escapes off of 1-2 mistakes.
---
Steve with a Rochelle voice- This is some deep shit we got ourselves into
---
You're as dark red as the generator you was hiding behind, the killer was merely too focused on the survivors that were running away to notice you.
---
Hi I'm commenting, you're a fucking moron
---
[removed]
---
Meaning he was after the Ace
---
I see it as a win win, no more noed but also gens won‚Äôt be finished within the first minute.
---
Animation set is not the same to body model though.
---
Kate is bae
---
You obviously haven‚Äôt played with my 3 man crew. One of usually dies to save the random. And I‚Äôll definitely pull you off the hook I need them blood points and wglf stacks.
---
‚ÄúSteve what is this ‚Äòcoldwind farms‚Äô and why do we keep getting sent here?‚Äù
---
To be fair, the devs made it a RANKED game, therefore instilling the believe that it is, in fact, a competitive game. I don‚Äôt think of it as a competitive game, since there are too many factors outside of a player‚Äôs skill that can determine the outcome of a match, but many people do.
---
He steals them from other people and watermarks it as his own

This all I can afford ü•á
---
It will still show her husk.
---
ive had a couple meyers round a t wall and grab me just like that
---
Why survivors are a bunch of assholes?
---
Yeah lol only autohaven maps had those pallets for some reason
---
Not game hostage. Game hostage is when there is no other option then to DC. Here the survivor was either going to bleed out or die from EGC.
---
This is scummy but not bannable.
---
Yeah, but spine chill was the perk that saved you from a yoink. Prayer Beads is an add-on that you can't really counter anyways
---
That‚Äôs a funny way to spell survivors
---
Toxic Killer Exposed
---
You clearly have no idea what "aggrieving a player" means. By your logic, putting a character on a hook fits that description.
---
No this is not holding the game hostage since there is now a timer that will force the game to end. 
---
Having multiple survivors refusing to leave I would consider holding the game hostage
---
Well lots of people don‚Äôt even get to play the mobile version at all yet :/
---
It's to keep lobbies flowing. If everyone chats for awhile then the lobby is held up and the next batch of players can't get in.
---
I agree, he is cute with his smile.
---
As long as your name is some variation of Chris or Kris or Krees we'll allow it
---
Still dying from when Jigmac ratted you out lmao
---
Exactly- this isn't Friday the 12th, where you only get XP if you sit around spectating until the end of the match, you're out of there in like five seconds after you die
---
Gotta be that straight cheddar
---
Of course it's doctor
---
This is hilarious üòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs anything wrong with it
---
Yeah but demos collar boneüòô
---
No because then it‚Äôs a wasted perk for 3 people adrenaline is sprint burst and a heal. With noed you still should easily catch them considering you‚Äôre still faster in the long run. If you can‚Äôt catch someone with adrenaline I bet they also had hope too, to cancel the noed speed boost.
---
If that give more variety of killers come the buff
---
Is inner strength worth running over self care though? Inner strength doesn‚Äôt allow you to heal whenever/wherever you want. Once a couple totems are cleansed it‚Äôs gonna be pretty hard to heal with it
---
Thanks
---
I'm still sensitive about that lmao
---
I‚Äôm a HUGE fan of Until Dawn, I completely agree. I‚Äôve played that game at least 8 times through since its release day, got the platinum trophy, and I still play it from time to time. Man of Medan was a disappointing downgrade :(
---
Self care isn‚Äôt worth running period really. Being able to heal whenever is nice but self care takes far too much valuable time. Either run Inner Strength, Bond, or bring a med kit if you‚Äôre worried about heals, never self care
---
Facts.
---
What is sand but a lot of small rocks?
---
Most of the older survivors just look terrible. There's only a few exceptions imo and I'm sure a lot of people would argue those ones look bad too. I'd say honestly that only really since Kate that survivor faces have been good. I'm not even saying that because I like Kate, I literally have never played her and shes at level 2 (that will change because I'm buying that costume on pay day) but since then, Adam, Jeff, and Ash have all looked great. 
---
As much as I love and Play pretty much every survivor, but damn I gotta admit, they're mostly not great looking. Though, ignoring people like Quentin, most aren't bad enough to really be a problem or make me feel like they need a change. It was just the ary style then and cosmetics can improve and fix stuff like better hair or makeup on "Night Out Nea".
---
Not having one
---
Both sides are toxic, that‚Äôs it. 
---
Survivors fucking suck ass. Teabagging at a dropped pallet, getting blinded when breaking pallets followed by more teabagging and then the wonder why killers become aggressive and focus on them. 
---
Yes I am a survivor who does these things and guess what, when I get tunneled I laugh it off because I know that I absolutely deserve every bit of it. 
---
Killers fucking suck ass. Sorry your fucking totem got cleansed in the first 30 seconds learn how to be better without a crutch of a totem!!! 
---
Yes I am a killer that not tunnel anyone, however, I will absolutely go after someone who teabags and is annoying as fuck, that‚Äôs how it works. And yes I run ruin and absolutely get upset when it gets cleansed but guess what? That‚Äôs my own fault for using it against a swf. 
---
Cue the backlash.....
---
:(
---
I know, I don‚Äôt run self care either. I‚Äôm just saying that if you want healing that badly, then self care is better
---
Nah, he'll be like huntress and sing when he's near, except it'll be All Star by Smash Mouth playing from the Boom Box he beats you to death with.
---
That‚Äôs gonna be a hard disagree from me chief, Inner Strength is gonna save tons of time that can be used for repairs, especially since high rank players aren‚Äôt gonna have any trouble finding totems, they‚Äôll barely have to go out of their way to activate the perk
---
Love the back story
---
I really like these! Mountain Monsters is a fantastic show and I would love to see Wild Bill stun The Woman of the Woods
---
only through money
---
because it causes problems if people just leave the chat open.
---
survivors against old freddy
---
Def not, every second counts and self care is far too slow, Inner Strength is gonna see a lot of use, I guarantee it
---
I mean we already have established character lore that Nea is Swedish, so why not?
---
Old DbD looked absolutely terrifying for Killer.
---
I never teabag anyone. Killer are more toxics
---
Do tell...

I‚Äôm going to make some assumptions that you never play killer, so I wouldn‚Äôt expect you to understand the logic. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre in their shoes, you‚Äôll never understand.
---
Finding totems isn‚Äôt hard if you know the spawns, killers aren‚Äôt gonna be hard patrolling full totems, and Inner Strength is faster than a team heal, it‚Äôs a strong perk, and I expect it to see plenty of use
---
That must be Ass

I sometimes play killer and I can understand but tunneling and camping a survivor who don't Teabagged u is Toxic
---
&gt;Someone
---
Some - BODY once told me. Fixed bud :)
---
kate looks p good actually
---
Eh she shoulda hit you with a hatchet on the stairs so she coulda grabbed you at the window or threw another if you put the pallet down. Dead Hard could save you though.
---
How? the timer is supposed to be paused when you're in their terror radius
---
r/lostredditors
---
It (pen)is, butt life goes on
---
Ik it‚Äôs great
---
yeah people also say the earth is flat and vaccines cause autism, who gives a fuck what they say if it's wrong?
---
Fuck yea, a RuneScape reference in a dbd sub
---
Finding and cleansing a totem and finding and standing in a locker will take more time than even Self-Caring through Sloppy Butcher 99% of the time.
---
Saying all killers are toxic followed by defunding that some survivors aren‚Äôt isn‚Äôt fair so I‚Äôm just gonna stop 
---
Your logic needs work
---
0.5 charging is basically a animation charging
---
You should not use neither Noed nor whispers for the reasons i named earlier. Try surveillance + surge. Play 3 gen strat and have fun
---
Thank you, it Leo should have been locker and not closet...
---
Wtf i wonder what the devs were thinking at the time
---
ooh no.. they'll see scratches.. scratches last for 7 seconds... less if you take a perk. They all lessen over that 7 seconds making them harder to track.  it's seriously not a big deal, even less so if you can actually run the killer and loop. 
---
Urban evasion is a shit perk, nearly as shit as self care..  so is crouch walking and walking everywhere because you're scared of leaving marks.
---
I'll vento d'oro 3:45 starts playing
---
You dont understand how this sub works do you? its got shitpost/meme flair, the joke is related to the game &amp; its mechanics
---
...
---
Yo that's really cool.
---
Before the ptb came out a lot of people were saying that it was basically hag. Because it can teleport, since people seem to think that teleporting=hag clone for some reason.
---
Most of the time, I usually use Mori when I'm playing kill your friends but the last time I used one in a public match was just to get it out of my inventory so I wouldn't have any rare items before I prestiged. 
---
I agree with the keys for sure. Played a match where I managed to get one and the other three just opened the hatch completely killing and ending the game. Whole thing lasted maybe 5 minutes.
---
Thanks my man. I want to make something more elaborate next.
---
Apparently it only stops when the survivor is in a "chase".
---
Oh girl you should have said nurse they only have two settings, Doug everyone in seconds or camp cuz they got lucky lmaoooo
---
that's not how you balance games. You balance from the top down. Where the skill ceiling is.
---
We‚Äôre just gonna have to agree to disagree here guy, in the long run I absolutely believe the time spent cleansing is more than worth it, and 9 times out of 10 you‚Äôll usually spawn right next to a totem anyways, meaning you can guarantee an 8 second heal as soon as the match starts. Inner Strength &gt; Self Care any day
---
To me, this is a great example of a player holding the game hostage. If you take away that it was a killer and a survivor was standing at the gate tbagging for 2 minutes they would be holding the game hostage, right? It doesn't seem different to me. I have never had this happen to me so it's intresting to see.rhe response. Thank you for letting me know .
---
No, I joined a public match
---
Going after the unhooked is literally tunneling. Regardless of fault, that is textbook tunneling.
---
You put a comment cool
---
No it really doesn't
---
Can‚Äôt remember fully, but I think I have STBFL, BBQ, Devour, and I swap around the fourth one a lot. I‚Äôm not a big fan of using ruin, it‚Äôs a perk that‚Äôs very random if it‚Äôs going to last 5 minutes or 5 seconds, so I only use it sometimes. I‚Äôm in the process of getting pop unlocked though
---
So if a survivor was doing this for 2 minutes  would it be ok because they were just playing as round?
---
Meg.
---
Thats honestly not a very good combo. Sprint burst is stronger than like 70% perks, but that‚Äôs cause most perks are trash. Out of exhaustion perks, sprint burst is probably the weakest because you can‚Äôt use it on demand like the other ones. It‚Äôs also not time efficient to save it because it‚Äôs way slower moving around the map at walking speed, even with fixated.
---
I don't get it. Butt isn't in the title
---
When Steve gets hooked*
---
Hello fellow WAHthers
---
Not exactly no repercussions, lose a shit ton of BP and emblem score letting a survivor bleed out instead of sacrificing
---
https://youtu.be/YXwtonjeOkA
---
Ohhhhh ok. My eyes auto corrected it. Didn't even see it üëçüèª
---
The weirdest part about this picture is that all of you stand on the shack
---
Spirit is the second best killer in the game while plague is more towards mid-tier. Fun is subjective, so you‚Äôd probably want to watch gameplay of both and see which one‚Äôs playstyle you think you‚Äôd enjoy more.
---
Is that two killers?
---
Not really..so the way the game used to be the survivors would have to leave in order for the game to end. Which mean that if a player wanted to be a horribly toxic person, they could hide in lockers or just become super immersive so the killer is constantly on the hunt for them desperate for the game to end. 
---
A survivor teabagging at the exit gate I would either hit, which usually results in them leaving, if they that for two minutes I‚Äôll let them just for the chance they let the EGC kill them.
---
I‚Äôm so glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one seeing this
---
Alright come on, he definitely skips leg day. But have you seen his torso? dude is top heavy.
---
More bamf is always good.  I can get behind that.
---
Survivors refusing to leave can be forced out, so that‚Äôs not holding the game hostage, and neither is this. Both the bleed out timer and the EGC would end the game in this scenario, holding the game hostage is when you‚Äôre in a situation where the only action you can take is DC‚Äôing, this doesn‚Äôt apply
---
‚ÄúI think we did a pretty good job‚Äù
---
That cosmetic looks like it would make more sense for a legion
---
Just tap tap the gen. But it take years to do gen.
---
I mean if I chased you for fifteen minutes I'd facecamp you too. That was probably infuriating for him hahaha.
---
Mobile has a way to test killers out (but controls are different so not sure if that's be beneficial to you or not.) But all in all I find the Plague more fun personally plus her perks are pretty good as well. If survivors don't cleanse they're one-shotted. If they do you've got the corrupt vile or whatever it's called that's easy to knock multiple people down with.
---
Im only one trophy off 100% and its the medic one
---
Yet i got wounded healer a month ago. :( 
---
Wounded Healer is bugged
---
While i think medic is unobtainable.
---
What? Why would we not get lost licensed killers anymore? Am I out of the loop?
---
I believe them. 
---
Soooo many players play both sides.  You really are a troll.
---
The entity is an influence on the killers
---
This would be somewhat hard to implement because they would have to model the blood for every cosmetic since they all have different geometric. 
---
They could just make it so that each cosmetic has a bloodied up version for prestige but that would also require them to go back and add it for old cosmetics. 
---
It isn‚Äôt impossible for them to have bloodied cosmetics for prestige, but it also isn‚Äôt so simple to do. It would definitely be time consuming and they have pretty full plates I imagine.
---
Smh cleanse rushing /s
---
The Entity: Blood Warden
---
The Killer: NOED
---
Also, sorry for shitty cropping.
---
Yea he may has a instadown but he can barely use it at all since he moves so slow when charging it meaning it's useless in chases and really only good in dead zones or basement camping. As someone that played leatherface alot he is by far the worse killer ingame
---
oddly satisfying
---
Based
---
Okay since context clues are lost on you lol
---
Yes it is okay if a survivor does it as well. The EGC will stop them from doing it forever. People just take things too seriously and get their feelings hurt over a video game. 
---
A killer can BM, a survivor can BM and they BOTH will. As long as their is a competitive edge to this game then people will BM each other. It's how it goes. You can't be a baby and cry everytime it happens or else I suggest you don't play an online game lol. (Not saying YOU are crying just speaking generally : -) ) 
---
The EGC was implemented for the exact reason of stopping people from BMing until they elicit a DC. Now you just have to stick it out for the couple minutes then move on to the next game. 
---
Nothing wrong with it as long as you keep a light-hearted attitude. : -)
---
Maybe if more survivors protected the unhooked by starting a chase/ body blocking and giving them time to heal and do gens it wouldn't be a problem.
---
That's almost NSFW tag worthy
---
What is blood warden?
---
Seems to be back
---
A lot of people were saying that when the power was first revealed, 'cause they thought the portals were like Hag traps.  Throw in the similarities of being feral and eating people, I'm sure you can see how things could spiral out of control.
---
A perk where you hook someone to trigger the gates to be blocked for 60 seconds
---
Shut the fuck up, pussy
---
No 4 escape for ur toxic swf this game, deal with it
---
My solution to the problem is i facecamp first hooked guy til death with lf EVERY GAME
---
Basically Steve and Nancy are shrieking in fright at the Demogorgon, who the more Fog-Experienced Ace and Nea confuse for a taller Hag.
---
I think diversion is fine where it‚Äôs at, but this is a cool idea if it ever needs changed
---
Skill checks are never 60fps, at least the red arrow never moves at 60fps. It could be that it's just visual and internally they work at 60, but I doubt it.
---
I‚Äôm a pro gamer, and I approve this message
---
No.  You can save shards and completed daily's.  I usually have a million and shards ready for each new chapter.  It's also worth saving BPS/puddings/cakes for when you need them.
---
Go back to roblox kid
---
Doesn't matter. :) DM me is probably safer so that I get the notification and actually check them. Haha
---
Saw a suggestion that cap should increase with devotion levels, thought it was a pretty good idea, but I doubt the devs would ever even consider it
---
if the killer is going to tunnel, they're going around you. it's that easy.
---
It's a video game..calm down. Dying in a video game and moving on to the next game is not that big of a deal.
---
If this was Nea's last box to search she already had 3 out of 4 chances to get her hat off. She got unlucky and the killer wanted to see her die from a game over. So what?
---
Clearly the pig found her before she had a chance to get the hat off and could have just downed and hooked her, she would have died anyway. Wanting to watch the reverse bear trap death animation 1 game out of 100 when you get lucky enough to secure a kill with it does not make this player "filth."
---
Throw a couple bucks down and support the devs.
---
Depends on what I‚Äôm feeling, I like Sloppy, discordance, thanataphobia, maybe whispers.. I like running Sloppy and Thanat together, because then it takes ages to heal and slows the game more than ruin
---
Haha, indeed. she had passed through there safely before, but I trapped the corner right after I put her on hook, but she couldn't see me place it thru the flames of the barrel.
---
Cosmetic discounts are rare as hell and it really depends what cosmetics you want
---
I'd be concerned too if I was expected to make sacrifices while also being the Wraith
---
Damn, what you‚Äôd do to set him off like that? Looped him to the end of time? Teabag at a pallet stun? Never seen a ghostface become this ‚Äúexcited‚Äù and I‚Äôm a ghostface main myself
---
It‚Äôs almost like matchmaking has been absolute ass these past few weeks and low rank killers are getting matched way out of their league
---
that's never worked from what I've seen in any game ever.
---
Came here looking for the hamster eating a banana picture.
---
how the hell did you know i was playing roblox
---
I do like the sound of that. Its nothing to crazy since youd have to be a really dedicated player to have milions of bp
---
So you're the nerd who always DMs me after I do my chase daily's.
---
Its a bunch of rocks that have been beaten till they become small and  sad. Just like how a joke is overused Rocks corrode over time.
---
Ranks?
---
All purple
---
Exactly, especially since the reason the cap exists is to stop players from opening new accounts and glitching millions of BP, just to get banned and do it all again, plus it‚Äôll actually give a purpose to devotion levels
---
HOORAH!
---
I‚Äôd recommend saving your cells until it comes out. No reason to believe that there‚Äôll be a sale
---
PTB?
---
Freddy may like that but I'm sure Quentin is horrified.
---
Who is this cosmetic for
---
Brown hair looks great on it, I personally really like the hair it comes with, a lot of the other hairs don‚Äôt really work great with it though which is a shame (in my opinion)
---
Okay, cool thanks. Like to ask in case I missed some word from BHVR or something eluding to some kind of sale. I'll save them for now. Don't need any of them that bad. Thanks!
---
Lol uve never played ghostface legion or wraith before then bitch
---
We already know devs tend to reuse assets, they even complained about demogorgon because they couldnt use any of the old assets on it.
---
Playing Freddy can be a *nightmare* for me sometimes because the game decides to shit itself if I have too many pallets

You can tell where she's going with ooo
---
Erm, doc is second on low tier? Okay. Wait. HAG IS HIGH TIER? Her map pressure is counterd ‚Äúeasily‚Äù with urban evasion. If this list is going on low ranks. Then no. Hag is useful as a box of crayons if she doesn‚Äôt have the right add ons, but in high ranks, sure. Acceptable,
---
I really hate hag.

But the doctor in both low and high ranks can be also good if with the right skill and add ons, can easily tear apart a game.

Just my opinion, completely fine with everything on this tier list otherwise

Nea DEFINITELY needs more cosmetics with piercings, we only have Night Out Nea atm and I don't understand why BHVR haven't decided to make more like it yet.
---
So they can happen across your scratch marks? I'd much rather be a ghost and take a second or two getting somewhere than leave a direct trail to me or others when the killer is just roaming the map. 
---
Sprinting should only be used when the killer is on you already, IMO
---
Comment above "farmers not understanding 24 meters."
---
Also, farmers moving at the last minute before a throw.
---
Why do I feel like I'm the only one who would rather go against spirit than Billy?
---
Perhaps iron will has something to do with it
---
dude he legit scared the fuck out of me, the music doesnt help either lmao
---
We're on console as well.  Probably why it took so long.
---
I saw the movie and I thought he could be named The Terror or The Fear or something like that. For his power I would want to involve the deadlights so maybe he can enter Predator Mode. In this mode his terror radius increases immensely and gains a soeed buff. His attack button would have him open his mouth and shine the deadlights. If a survivor sees the light beam they start to see things like zombified survivors running at them or jump scaring them. They would be faced with a series of skillchecks and if they fail they scream and stumble out of fear. This may be op idk just a thought.
---
Exactly, i'd say sprinting everywhere is WAAAAY worse than using Urban Evasion all the time.
---
When randoms fail a skill check there are no fucking excuses, but when I do it it‚Äôs understandable for one reason or another.
---
No you didn't.  Nice attempted flex though.
---
Ight imma head out
---
Shh, there, there.  It's okay ... You may all turn to Blood Warden, the one true end game perk.
---
OOH or when they see the deadlight other survivors look like Pennywise so they see 4 Pennywises running around the map.
---
I would agree with you if it lit up when the Exposed effect started, but I feel like Devour almost never gets used because 50% of the time you get nothing out of it because it gets cleansed at one stack.

---
That's exactly what I wrote.
---
How beautiful
---
why not
---
Nope im on xbox shit wasn't balanced i was the highest level in the game
---
He literally just said why. As killer it's easy to see a survivor in the distance, especially if they're walking/sprinting..
---
Urban Evasion makes you way harder to find, almost always..people really underestimate scratch marks and the killer's ability to see them through the fog I guess, idk..I think Urban Evasion is one of the best perks in the game
---
Why don't you like that idea?
---
Wait why is self care bad? I'm only a rank 10 survivor with not that much game time so I only see it being bad when you can just take Bond to find teammates.. I don't have Bond as a teachable yet though and none of the people I play with ever heal after unhooking lol
---
Seems like bad matchmaking.
---
Just trying to give some hope

I'm with you man, no idea why people would say Urban Evasion crouching is nooby, but sprinting everywhere is a good strategy. Pretty sure this whole thread is just killers trolling..
---
I personally disagree with both of those statements. Doctors ability does nothing against good or decent survivors as he slows down when shocking people giving a loop,skill checks are still easy, a great doctor will still struggle against good teams making him in my opinion low tier(he has great add-ons though).   For hag she has fantastic map pressure, she has the ability to bodyblock totems,teleport across the map(both of these are add-ons but still) she can defend totems greatly with her traps and she can camp the basement greatly and sure if someone brings a flashlight your traps.might get destroyed a few times but they need to know where they are to do it. Tier lists are opinions though so can't judge if you disagree
---
I laughed too hard at this
---
 he was tunneling before they dced because right off me finishing the first gen, he started chasing me after I unhooked one of the people who dced and after I pallet stunned a few times, he started chasing me specifically even though he ran into the other one twice while following me but I'm alright with getting tunneled because it's fun to waste the killers time but getting facecamped is lame.
---
How?
---
I can only see this Steve's sexy cowboy pose
---
Being ran for ‚Äú15 min‚Äù is lame to üòÇ I‚Äôd face camp u too
---
Similar thing happened to me but instead of sandbagging the guy healed me to 99% and then ran away when the killers heartbeat came (killer was no where near us but when the guy ran away he failed a skillcheck which led the killer to us) . I had the satisfaction as I watched him die later on
---
I always play 3 SWF and we always go out of our way to help the random. My friend even used his insta heal at the exit gate against a NOED killer to help them escape. There are some of us that are good!
---
nah
---
nope, thats when it spawns, not opens
---
I‚Äôm on Season Three and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen this yet, but I may be wrong
---
Use with ‚ÄúThe Beast‚Äù Add-on for galaxy-brain mindgames.
---
Poorly, I assume. Did they at least commit to a basement/chest guardian Bubba or were they hook/face camping?
---
Nope, just We're Gonna Live Forever :(
---
He got teabagged because he didn‚Äôt save me :( always letting me die Matt! Jk, hi mom I‚Äôm famous!!!! Get the camera
---

---
Okay, okay. 
---
Doctor is THE best at finding survivors, literally any other killer (cept nurse) can find survivors slower than doctor. All he needs to do is walk around in treatment mode, wait for any survivor to start screaming, chase them, make them go into madness 3, hook em, go back to treatment mode, rince and repeat, he can also use his shock to stop animations from happening like pallet drops or window vault if timed right. 
---
And yes. Doing this takes A LOT of time and he gets hard counterd with calm spirit (but who would be running that) but. His add ons make a big difference, one of his add ons which makes you see your illusion from anywhere might seem useless right? Until you find out that the illusion spawns and stares at the survivor. THAT is absolutely fucking powerful. Making it so you can see the last survivor if you were doing you‚Äôre job right as doctor and shocking everyone to madness 3
---
And don‚Äôt get me even started on his ultra.
---
The hag? Sure. Insane map pressure? Sure. At least in the early game. Until the survivors catches on and start crouch walking everywhere, 
---
Unless you bring the add on that makes you so oh can manually teleport to traps, you‚Äôre power is literally useless if they start crouch walking everywhere. And if they have urban evasion it makes it even worse. Except in chases, hag is good in chases, if she can place down enough traps at the right places, she can be god like in loops that has atleast one trap in it.
---
I don‚Äôt really see the problem with flashlights.
---
Good point but I was more so saying a killer shouldn't need a perk to make their ability good not just the killer. I just feel you shouldn't need to run perks to make a killers ability decent
---
Ah, yes. The ironic bad luck of the BPS. It's just bad luck. Personally I find bringing any highly sought over add on fucks me over. I bring a key? Tunneled. Bring a mori? Gen rushed and absolutley destroyed and dont get a chance to use it. Such is the way
---
"power roles don't exist in this game"  
---
shit man can you tell that to the fully stacked swf with insta heals that went out of their way to make me miserable 5 minutes ago? I think they missed the memo.
---
I'll try to do a kyf tonight to be 100% sure, but yeah, I'm 90% sure that Freddy with Nurse's Calling can see a survivor being woken up by another survivor (but weirdly enough, not the one doing the wake up action)
---
Yah
---
Pretty good job so far
---
This is really cool.
---

Yea I feel like David would be able to do it, especially a shirt less David and you know * DAVID IS KING *.
---
hah
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but I still can‚Äôt figure out what farming is. Or boosted. What do they mean, lol.
---
i usually DC if they're just waiting out the clock to teabag me
---
Don‚Äôt need the nobody: but ok
---
Hey I rock stealth nea with sprint burst, 70% of the time, it pays off 100% of the time
---
Just stalk him and rack in the bloodpoints.
---
I do not think uwill gat banned it would be wery suprising
---
Lorewise, these survivors and killers are going into trial after trial, even when they die or escape they're sent back in for another.
---
What weird dynamics show up, over who knows how many years of them chasing and being chased?
---
i just got a 4k as bing bong boy with no noed
---
Too long to read: killer spared me and somebody said they reported me for teaming though I was hooked before.
---
*Chuckles in Mori Myers*
---
Ooh I like the nurses for distance indicator. Thanks! I'll try that build out
---
Not bannable. If you sniped the killer's lobby and you two are buddies chatting on discord, then yeah that's literal cheating and bannable. But if the Killer is just dicking around and pseudo-farming with you/ignoring you and you're going along with it then nah, nothing anyone can do about that. It's not like you were intentionally gamethrowing or griefing them.
---
It's the killer's fault. They just could've left you to go after someone else. A possible 3k is better than a 1k.
---
Brother David main?
---
Nothing makes me madder than when someone is getting farmed but the killer goes along with it and tunnels them. If I see someone farming someone else as killer I tunnel them
---
Ok you make some pretty good points I guess I'll retract my statement about doctor being low tier and put him in low mid tier but only low mid tier I won't go more then that maybe. For Hag I admit survivors do crouch more but against survivors that don't expect Traps near generators or windows it could be quite a surprise. For her chase potential it is so big, she can make traps bodyblock great loops and get downs easily which is why I think she's high tier.
---
I didn‚Äôt know the killer so yeah hopefully I‚Äôm not banned killer decided to spare me.
---
Good.
---

\*cries in angry invisible elephant\*
---
Farming is where a Survivor rescues you off the hook directly in front of the Killer which causes the Rescued Survivor to immediately get knocked down again if the Killer chooses to. Boosted means you jumped from low rank to high rank via getting carried by your team and you're at a rank you shouldn't normally be, it's easy to tell if somebody is boosted if they make a ton of mistakes more than the average Survivor should.
---
I fully agree with you right now.
---
You're low key a salty killer main üòÇ
---
They deserve to be punished
---
He is fine.
---
Survivors got used to get bad killers as dlc so they complain
---
Damn, this was ‚Ä¢literally‚Ä¢ a round I had a few days ago
---
He was spamming me with lol say good bye to your account like four times can‚Äôt believe how toxic some people are.
---
Thanks, Chapter 14 maybe...?
---
You were the largest threat by miles. he secured what would be in his mind a big W by face camping you.
---
Ugh it reminds me of an uncut dick
---
Except I low key main survivor which I why I‚Äôm a rank 1 survivor üòÇ
---
Ok well glad you agree with me I guess idk. Anyways good talk I guess?
---
And you'd be the rudest.
---
yeah yeah we know, you're edgy, who cares
---
Good to know
---
Yea he just wanted to scare you tbh some kids do that
---
Yup, good talk.
---
Sounds like the one guy was just salty the killer decided to crap on everyone but you. Like you mention, you've been hooked and the killer just took pity/mercy on you for whatever reason. There is absolutely nothing bannable about it.
---
For those who like fun details like I do, the Demogorgon's power "Of the Abyss" is a Dugeons and Dragons reference. In DnD lore ( I am only familiar with 5e) the Demogorgon is a powerful demon that dwells on the 88th layer of the Abyss. The Abyss is a dark and chaotic realm where all demons are from. Hence "Of the Abyss" is referencing DnD lore, not just Stranger Things lore.
---
Idk why but nea looks really cute in this post.
---
Holy shit, I knew the JoJo fandom could get a bit.. bizzare, but this is a whole new level.
---
Hook farming is when a survivor intentionally unhooks a survivor when it is not safe, generally right after they are hooked, allowing the killer to down them again so that the farmer can unhook them, repeating the process to earn points. 
---
Boosted is when a player, killer or survivor, is at a higher rank than their skill level. They are significantly less skilled than everyone else in the lobby.
---
I don‚Äôt think survivor mains entirely understand how absolutely infuriating it can be to be genrushed then have everyone escape and do absolutely awful as a killer. I used to be a survivor main (I‚Äôm not a killer main now, I balance it out) and bitch about stuff like this, but then I played *1* match as a killer and understood completely. Some killers give the survivor the hatch, but I often give the killer a free kill because I feel bad.
---
Best build: Enduring, Spirit Fury, Save the best, Ruin, any movement speed while cloaked add on
---
Nah dawg
---
Ik Ik lol. I just posted this as a sarcastic shit post. I know most would've done the same
---
No it's the same as your walking speed at tier 3. Fixated however increases your walking speed while uninjured which is nice.
---
Ah okay, thanks.
---
Thank you good sir
---
Unfortunately you‚Äôre right lol
---
We got destroyed this happened in under two minutes he  probably wanted to take out his anger on someone. Me and the killer farmed a little I would drop a pallet they would break it but that‚Äôs it only 3 or 4 pallets. Then they left me alone and I eventually found the hatch in the kill shack.
---
na i‚Äôm using sloppy, bloodhound, bbq, and iron grasp. i don‚Äôt have many meta perks
---
The abyss is such a wildly commonly used realm across thousands if fantasy universes, not just DnD lol.
---
He was really determined he sent me a clip of that saying it would be proof for the report.
---
Thank you, this is an ONLINE game. I should be able to play with my friends.
---
I love this killer omg
---

---
They also share the same face lmao
---
Yea the devs arent that stupid i dont think and if u get bannde lets go bluuy his steam account lol
---
That's true, but I very much doubt it's a coincidence since DnD is referenced so heavily in Stranger Things.
---
Well, we did it boys! The hatch is no more!
---
Maybe he had monstrous shrine and you got really unlucky
---
This Is amazing. I want that first perk, more then anything here, to be real.
---
That's a funny combo, but that DS could have bought you a lot more time lol
---
You already Know brother, we be dead harding on the killer so *hard* the killer does not even know what hit em.
---
It was on Xbox though but hope I don‚Äôt get banned.
---
Can i kindly request you change your tag immediately? I'm gonna go bleach my brain now
---
Np
---
Oh well gl my guy but as i sait i would be suprised  if u get banned
---
David best waifu
---
Yay for update! You make the most beautiful icon packs around IMO.
---
In his current state?
---
This, not to mention Pig has no terror radius when she is crouched anyways.
---
The Jeff with the key and I were in discord, the Kate was a random, so I was tracking Kate's progress to the hook so Jeff could get to me just in time as I got off the hook. Worked out great.
---
people always say this when they see how many Deviousness points you get from the killer's power, but that's still only 1 category. Legion is still effectively the only killer who can farm BP in 3/4 of the categories in as little interactions as possible.
---
Which survivor is this?
---
Havent heard this 100 times in this subreddit already
---
This is nothing new, people posted videos of Pigs doing this right after she was released too
---
Honestly I don't know.
---
My first thought was some kind of accessory to help prevent any injury. Similar to her glove she's got on. Couldn't find anything online like it though.
---
Anything that happens on the PTB, including buying from the shrine, progressing characters, earning shards, buying cosmetics, etc. Does not carry over into the live version.
---
I have trouble using legion effectively in red ranks, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have the same problem with demo-boi

They have claimed to have patched it and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù it at least twice now. Yet there it still is. Last month I got this glitch at least 20 times a day. Absolutely infuriating to sometimes die to some trashcan of a killer this way that didn‚Äôt deserve the kill at all.
---
It's a technique mostly SWFs use. 
---
It's very simple to counter, just hit the guys blocking and they will move. If they don't move then you get a trade and can hook them instead.

That makes sense, I was just a bit panicky since the gate was open and I knew he was close from wiggling out. Thank you for the advice.

If you do make anything let me know, I'm shit at sculpting and have just been using what's already been created for the most part and repurposing things.
---
I think I might be able to repurpose the Claudette model to look like the Hag, but not sure how I'll be able to make a lot of the others without help
---
Clearly you‚Äôre not lmfao if you rip the models and compare them in their t pose, they‚Äôre identical. But keep going off I guess
---
I‚Äôve had Kate‚Äôs, megs, etc join my lobby t-posing in the past. Can‚Äôt replicate that, but yeah
---
So you‚Äôre so set on your position you‚Äôll say the devs lied?
---
Wondering whatlt you think autism is or "sounds like" - the guy is just an asshole, autism has nothing to do with it.  Lord.
---
This subreddit rarely comes up with original material. Someone comes up with 1 meme and then everyone else posts it over and over again until someone else can think of something new.
---
There are other killers that literally tunnel through the map?
---
I still walk away during those situations, but you‚Äôre right, it just hurts your soul to watch ‚Äòem run away and t-bag you at the gate. I‚Äôve been thinking about camping in those situations, especially if the survivor has been annoying.
---
I feel you, just this skins face reminds me a Noomi
---
The joke is that the Demogorgon's portals are literal tunnels he's crawling through.
---
Kinesiology Tape
---
If you know where people are hiding, you know where you can lead the killer. Sure they'll be pissed, but when you're on death hook and they haven't been hit ever because they haven't left the corner all game, it's a reasonable sacrifice.
---
Bbq and chili, ruin, dying light and thanatophobia. Run some action speed add ons and you‚Äôll slow the game down a ridiculous amount.
---
I obviously don‚Äôt know for certain it‚Äôs autism, I‚Äôve dealt with many people on the spectrum, but the way he expresses his exasperation and stutters/struggles to to get words out along with many other factors he definitely has something is wrong with him other than just being a dick
---
Thanks! Still a newbie over here getting the hang of things :)
---
It‚Äôs a lot to explain but to sum it up. Sleep bad, awake good. Not all pallets are real ...
---
I really hope the current PTB menu is scraped. The black outlines look ugly and cluttering, and the menu prior to the survivor menu looks lacklustre as fuck
---
Please tell me yall started swinging at each other to assert dominance
---
Yah normally if I‚Äôm with my SWF group, when we all can be on which is maybe 1 night out the week, we have one guy running borrowed time as a rule and then if the killers for the day or evening are in a camping mood we all run borrowed and DS, it‚Äôs saved are ass many times and we also make sure we knock out totems and count them as we make are rounds in the Match! I always run small game, that‚Äôs been a built in perk from day one after learning what NOED was along with hex ruin, devour soap or Lullaby! Plus is OP against trapper or hag aka ‚ÄúMarge‚Äù But I‚Äôve been running Object of Obsession allot lately and gotten good at hiding behind gens to block my aura and call the killer out as I see him or her moving thru the map. With that intel right there my guys know how to move thru the map, Only bitch part is trying to get some definitive land marks setup which is always a pain.

&gt; You really believe intellect can be found on this subreddit?
---
Sweet summer child I was once naive like you!
---
So because you couldn‚Äôt find intellect here, you decided to lower your standards?
---
&gt; The asymmetrical game leads to a rift in the player community, there is no decent talk about opinions on this forum, and by default downvotes on this subreddit mean jack-diddley-shit. I can get 2500 upvotes over the weekend if I want by just commenting on the fucked up bullshit meme's you douchenozzles spout in such frequency that actually topics regarding gameplay get smothered.
---
I agree.
---
&gt; Btw, we both know what Toxic perks I'm talking about... if you don't maybe you should stop posting replies on things you don't have a clue about!
---
No, that‚Äôs why I asked you to elaborate. If you refuse to elaborate, then it‚Äôs safe to assume *you* don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
&gt; Tell me where I was wrong predicting the downvotes? The simple fact is there are more Survivors then killers in this game, that statement is staved by the fact that I don't have to wait 15s. for a full group when I queue as a killer but have a 5m waittime for survivor.
---
I don‚Äôt know what game you‚Äôre playing. I literally wait 3-4 minutes in a killer lobby searching, while watching Huntress constantly throw hatchets at my screen or Nurse moaning at random. I typically find survivor lobbies instantly.
---
&gt; This flows over into the forums where self-proclaimed "pro's" come to get rid of pent up aggression by downvoting everything they don't like and spewing their bile in the form of meme's
---
Users who rant on this forum tend to be irrational, thus leading to downvotes by the more rational users. I predicted this in my original comment. Believing that ‚Äúpros‚Äù are downvoting stuff that they don‚Äôt like is pretty arrogant of you. If I said ‚ÄúALL SURVIVORS SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE FIVE HITS INSTEAD OF TWO AND REQUIRE SIX HOOKS TO BE SACRIFICED,‚Äù I‚Äôd probably get downvoted for being irrational, not because of your ‚Äúpros‚Äù conspiracies. I do agree that the memes here are atrocious.
---
&gt; BHVR allows this because it distract from the inevitable realisation that they don't do a proper job maintaining the game and they just keep making promises they keep extending the timer on.
---
Want to elaborate on this?
---
&gt; You just cater to the 80% of survivors over the 20% of killers, and even selling out like that gets you barely 2 or 3 upvotes per post, because toxic survivors don't live to upvote they just try to bring everyone else down to their level. Just go over the high upvote topics and cry from this game's fanbase.
---
Here‚Äôs the irrationality I‚Äôm referring to, people. 
---
Personally,
---
I cater to a balanced game. Judging by your Us vs Them mentality, that‚Äôs clearly not something you‚Äôre interested in. Please continue to believe that you always right and that you are the victim though and the majority is against you for no real reason.
---
I was not at all saying that it was toxic, I was just saying that it was frustrating because I was trying to hook a survivor who was teabagging and I‚Äôm just trying to have a fun as the wraith. I also don‚Äôt feel that one should be able to block said hooks considering a killers physical ability.
---
I just forsee getting angry messages from inner strength users if I break any dull totems without inner strength. I could deffinetly see people being super salty about that.
---
pretty thankful *most* changes aren't community driven or implemented. don't get me wrong, there's definitely been a some due to the community being vocal and that's a discussion for a different day but some of the suggestions and butthurt induced complaints I see people make would ruin this game so fast. you see it with every game aswell. always that crowd that wants something like bazookas added to a game of chess or something that's dumb downright dumb as shit.
---
Because Stonks. If demogorgon does well, BHVR does well and üìà Stonks. I suspect the reason for others not getting fair treatment, like Pig, Legion and Plague is because they are not going to sell as well as a new fresh killer.
---
I really never pay attention to that ... but it seems to happen at the right time. When I‚Äôm actually a diversion and the killer gives up on them and comes for me.
---
Newsflash fellas if you hold shift (im fairly sure it works in dying state too) you cannot be healed so if that idiot was runing he couldn't be stoped (unless body blocked) by healing.
---
I feel sorry when I spawn right next to the Ruin totem...
---
the post below this
---
This is the reason it's my favorite hair cosmetic for her.
---
And it turned out that the demogorgon is actually just hillbilly 2.0
---
That‚Äôs definitely hag dumbass
---
BTW second account
---
I don't even tunnel and i feel the same when doing dailies with low tier killers. :(
---
So spine chill just became pretty bad
---
I don't think that the black outlines are necessarily bad, I think they had the right idea, but they are a bit ugly and don't really give off the "survivor" vibe.
---
Shit they just having long ass wait times because everyone is on. Ive been playing killer since 8pm east coast time ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù because wait times were 15-20mins then and as killer I was insta Lobby with 4 poor souls ready to be butchered by Freddy, then Myers! It was fun and I just got off and it was working fine.
---
Not just survivors, there are plenty of toxic children/manchildren who just complain
---
Nice render!!!
---
( so I I‚Äôm a casual player and don‚Äôt know why these are op or not someone explain please)
---
I see this a lot too and in all my time playing on PC I can count on one hand how many truly toxic post chats there have been. 
---
I mean really toxic and not that t-bagging, flashlight clicking bullshit. That‚Äôs not toxic. Calling people racial and homophobic slurs just because they lost. That‚Äôs toxic.
---
Why
---
Wait you guys still play at 60?
---
Your turning is heavily impaired after blinking you also cannot flick blinks on console so i can understand why people would say she is harder on console.
---
But if they don't blame the killer, then they would have to admit they made mistakes and good luck with that.  Except for the quiet majority that're really nice people.
---
It‚Äôs happened a lot recently for me and my friends, mostly in custom games and with other killers too.
---
Lol. That's me 9/10 killer matches
---
Fastest way to gain BP as the killer is to use a survivor pudding offering, good add ons, bbq perk and while in the game do the actions that give most BP. I easily get 50k bp as bare minimum without pudding and offerings per game.
---
It was reported on the Gamepedia site, think they misread some code or something. They issued a retraction and apology but that seems to have been taken down now too.
---
Glad some people have integrity. Had this happen to me 3x all three times the killer killed me.
---
Lmfaooo üòÇüòÇ
---
Do meta survivor perks not do the same?
---
Now that‚Äôs what i like to see
---
Lol almost every survivor I‚Äôve ever killed with noed says I‚Äôm trash for using it and that it‚Äôs not fair but go off
---
Please look at the post above this üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You‚Äôre supposed to cleanse totems anyways and getting a free heal on top of that is a bonus. Not sure why people think that it‚Äôs too time consuming
---
I think it's from that one honey/whatever event. You can see the glowing parts oozing down off of it, which is what those event cosmetics do.
---
I don't know why they haven't done this yet or why they haven't given Wglf any other ability outside of BP farming. It's literally useless in-game, compared to BBQ which is a really good perk even without the BP bonus.
---
I pulled a sneaky on ya
---
Dont understand why you cant just k8t them to force them out. If you DC you automatically lose 2 pips. That's real dumb, my guy
---
You did good enough to get them!
---
I met a guy today he was bragging that his teammates were bad and he was the best I told him his loops are a bit jank and work on them he got all pissy started spamming ez ez rekt noob I start to say to the other guys they did good but I caught then because ect (one guy was running whole match) he keeps acting like a baby I then say I need to work on my throws and following and he gets all pissy still so I say you were decent not good and then just leaves in a fit like. That's toxic
---
Killers lost the ability to catch survs using the hatch when they gained the ability to close the hatch. There is no counter to survs unlocking it with a key though.

Well I mean you can earn them with shards and the reason you need to pay for them is because they have completely different designs then Frank and Julie and they have alot of effort in them.
---
Because their designs are more complicated

Every locker slam/fast vault kills me a little on the inside
---
Ah, my bad! I just run into a lot of Michaels who use both.
---
This makes me feel uncomfortable for some reason maybe it's imagining small demogorgon heads on plant but I don't know.
---
I don't defend it really. I treat it like a gen and will come around to check on it. I use it to slow the game down... "Just a little bit" so as long as it puts pressure on the survivors and I can catch them, its done its job. 
---
I have had games where it pops immediately and im like "well... This sucks" wasted perk
---
&gt;!test !&lt;
---
Well, he'd just kill the killer if he T-posed. That's why we made sure the most he could do is an A-pose at most
---
If everyone got 1mil bloodpoints by accident it wouldn‚Äôt affect the game in anyway tbh, that‚Äôs like 5 hours of gameplay.
---
kono me amareri maroreri merare maro
---
Noed is not a meta perk, it's Just a annoying perk, using ruin,barbecue, spirit fury or enduring ain't annoying because insentefies survivors to have a backup plan like hitting perfect skillchecks, dropping pallets early or hiding on a locker while The only backup plan for noed is looking for totems, it slows the game down but not like ruin, where you gotta have fast reflexes in order to counter it and when it activates it's the same thing, go around the map and look for a glowing skull.
---
The best way is to just run right thru and rng once ur caught üëåüèª
---
Yea, not much.  It mostly is a case of persistence once you are above rank 8 or so as anyone, as most players plateau there skillwise.  Perhaps save some of your better addons for the last few ranks.

There is definately some more tricks you can learn as you sit more in the highest ranks that help you get back up there/stay up there more, but it basically just is how good you are at your macro game as killer above rank 8.
---
Of course also add the no mither
---
It would be nice to have 1.5 million as the BP cap. It's enough to get 1 character from level 1 to lvl 50.
---
Ahh yes, i forgot, jeff‚Äôs might is too grand. A simple stare from jeff sparks more fear into a killer than the entity ever could.
---
First time here! How do I access to PTB? My code didn‚Äôt work (DbdPublicTest). It keeps on saying it‚Äôs invalid.
---
Your death will not be in vain
---
Not sure how I haven't seen this joke made yet, bless you.
---
Except it isn't that effective.  Once (good) survivors recognize how much you tunnel/camp, they will basically just treat any hooked survivor as dead unless they themself are running Borrowed Time, and hard push to gen rush your ass.
---
obviously im not talking about campers
---
i mean the people who straight up unhook you the second you get hooked
---
Leg thickness doesn't matter when you're filled with the dark, unnatural power of the Entity. Oh god that last bit sounds wrong.

funny, the game lists him as "easy" and freddy as "hard"
---
XDDDD le ebin esports 240hz snakeoil lad here
---
Not a killer main but if I play killer I'm a piggy main. I'm not a toxic player by any means but my last piggy game I faced the piggy was a good pig not gonna lie but she slugged the last guy, then before he could bleed out she picked him up and kept dropping, picking up, dropping and repeat till he died. I was gonna gg but that play just grinded my gears. Making the game go 5 or more minutes longer just to be a dick.
---
"Butt"
---
I've had mostly good experiences with the PTB.
---
Agree to disagree on that. When I grew up we always busted balls and that‚Äôs just part of it. I‚Äôve got a thick skin so I don‚Äôt get upset by that. At all. 
---
I feel people nowadays are too sensitive with things. If you ever played sports, you‚Äôd understand that taunting in a competitive setting is natural. And losers tend to take it harder. 
---
The line gets crossed when you make it personal and say things that are inappropriate. I can‚Äôt tell from this if you hooked anyone or not. But there‚Äôs nothing wrong with throwing some back his way. Especially if you got him.
---
Oh wow. Interesting. Thank you! Did not know that was a thing
---
I used to have 99% of the achievement. That one was the only one remains since I dont play huntress a lot
---
Neh, I got self control and know where to put my money
---
This could be fixed just be removing the sound Ghostface gets when he's being revealed.
---
He *already* gets the location (Killing Instinct) of the person who revealed him for free after fucking up and getting revealed, but he gets a sound cue that he's being revealed as well? It's ridiculous.
---
Survivors don't get a cue until the last possible moment when it's too late to stop getting exposed.
---
Was expecting Clementine.
---
Fair I guess.
---
That would be cool too, however she‚Äôs already been through enough. Hopefully the entity would have some mercy and leave her alone üòÇ
---
r/iselessnobody
---
Meep
---
You basically got one male and one female for free (who are like grunts) and you have to unlock the cool ones.
---
I personally don‚Äôt like it that Frank and Julie have like no cool skin when Joey and Susie have all the great ones
---
Like?
---
Some lightning McQueen type shit
---
Even though I think this sub doesn't lean heavy to either side I'd say killer.
---
Freddy looks like he has different shoulder heights tho
---
Thank you! I actually ended up with the different colors because I had to thrift shop and the small town I live in doesn't have a great thrift store
---
It happened in my previous game, I just edited out the all the names to comply with the rules of the subreddit.
---
Your build is nice, but Bloodhound is pretty unnecessary, you could switch it to any other perk available and it would end up helping you more once you learn how to properly track blood.
---
Anyone who cries that it‚Äôs OP, I‚Äôd like to point in the direction of The Nurse for just a moment.
---
I haven't seen a clown without NOED so far. ü§î
---
You haven‚Äôt see it yet. It‚Äôs from part 5
---
U miss the opportunity to use Wraith here tbh, still upvote.
---
The game would be far more interesting if all the perks were balanced to a similar level of usefulness. Ruin, NOED, and BBQ+Chili stand out as tremendously overpowered over the others. I dont think I've ever played a high level killer that wasn't using 1 or 2 of these. The game would be so much more interesting if there was an even chance a good killer could use any perk, not just these 3. Nerf these 3, buff all the others, i dont care which, its just so boring to get the same top tier perks on repeat.
---
It was great when they nerfed decisive strike, now not everyone uses it. Same idea.
---
You have a point, it's boring game design. The perk should be reworked but in afraid if bhvr will touch it, it will as usefull and situational as Fire up.
---
In my opinion it should always throw at the same distance and the charge time should scale with tiers
---
Also, make the current charge time the tier 2 value and make tier 3 a bit faster
---
Trust me when I say I‚Äôm not really having a choice in the matter
---
I'm personally not excited about current dedicated servers. I like what the goal is and what it tries to accomplish but it's current state feels far from live ready and hope they dont release what we have been given to live servers.
---
This.
---
People acknowledge that generators go by far too quickly if the survivors are any good (even people who disagree use Blendettes as their counter-argument, which is ridiculous).
---
But the moment the Killer starts camping they act like generators take forever, you can pop all five and teabagging in the gate area in like two and a half minutes (which presuming the would-be-camper wasted half a minute catching and hooking the first survivor), a little slower if they have Ruin and you can't hit Greats, but sheesh.
---
Time will come for Adrenaline. Back when they changed BNP I've heard devs are also looking for a solution to free instaheals. It's been a while but we all know changes to this game are snail paced.
---
There isn‚Äôt enough JoJo. We need a subreddit that‚Äôs purely JoJo and dbd memes
---
Ikr? I tend to lay a trap near a switch during the match so that I can beeline to the untrapped gate as well.
---
I play survivor but most of the time get called a salty killer main
---
Imo as someone that plays killer and survivor, mori‚Äôs (as well as keys) should not even be in the game. While I highly doubt that either change will happen, it is rather bs to lose as a survivor just because a killer burned an offering or as a killer to lose because someone brought an item. Same goes to instaheals to a lesser extent. If it was up to me, they would all be removed, but at the very least a rework would be nice
---
Did u have to ask? Urban players r disgusting...
---
Your walking through your local garden centre you see a mad Claudette in her uniform she stated eagerly at you holds up a strange looking plant red on inside white on the outside dirt turned to ash she runs at you plant snapping you close your eyes brace for impact. Thumpt you wake up ash falls from the sky it looks the exact same but it seems. The world is upside-down.
---
Yeah but if it did change the time rather than distance I think to should throw 20 meters then the charge would be 40/30/20 or /40/35/25
---
I don't. I don't know how to feel about them.
---
Great work!
---
BBQ, overpowered
---
Choose one.
---
This perk isn‚Äôt that good. It‚Äôs all about points that you almost always get (it‚Äôs hard not to hook everyone once)
---
Not a problem, happy to help!
---
Whats the ear one in the second row? Second one from the last
---
That sucks. To be honest I always thought you were a killer main but guess I was wrong
---
I also used to play with Urban Evasion every single game. It saved my ass quite a few times with jukes around trees to stay out of line and sight and progress across the map.
---
But the thing is that even if you're running in the distance while the Killer is chasing someone, they usually won't break off that chase to come after you if they spot you either; they'll lose any progress towards bloodlust they have.
---
Now I would run around the map even if I was packing Urban Evasion, just to save time in reaching my next objective, even if that objective is cleansing totems. It gets a lot easier if you're running Spine Chill instead of Urban Evasion - because then you know when to stop running, instead of deciding to never start.
---
Is BHVR publically traded?
---
2 states. You get hit you enter "sleep" you have to wake up. You also have a timer to fall asleep when you do you need to wake up. When you are asleep you can be affected by freddys dream powers. Snares or pallets.
---
Claudette is flayed btw
---
Ahh the Nancy perk
---
I got flamed so much on the PTB because I know the totem spawning pattern and I got into a habit of just running around the map at the start of the game when there‚Äôs little pressure and getting rid of all the totems before gen 1. 
---
People running inner strength were salty cuz they couldn‚Äôt find any totems
---
I've let teammates die on the hook for having racist and/or homophobic usernames.
---
Both.
---
Nancy with Demogorgon model pls
---
Rank is irrelevant in this game buddy.
---
I already said how do I improve, again not complaining about the game was looking for tips. I found a gold mine on youtube and gameplay is ez now.
---
What is that mask made out of? Looks like top tier material!
---
Good perk is fine. Interesting perk is even better.
---
Free second chance is not fine.
---
Her problem is an almost infinite skill cap. You cant beat a nurse who has spent thousands of hours to master the game unless youve spent thousands of  hours learning to juke them
---
As much as I love licensed chapters, they‚Äôre what brought me to the game, I would like another original chapter again just to mix things up
---
Quote on quote "You realize nearly every female survivor have the exact same body model too, right?"
---
When O.o can you tell me which pat h it was?
---
I feel the small town blues. I usually just take what I can get, because I'm also a pretty big fan of thrift stores. I'm going out on a limb and assuming they weren't selling Pig masks at Goodwill
---
I honestly love the peppermint twist perk with the vault speed switching.
---
tbh I am disgusted
---
I think the major flaw of the game is that survivors dictate the game. They control everything, even how much points you earn (fuck emblem system), when it should be the killer who should feel strong. Isn't this supposed to be an horror game? Yet whenever I play as a killer  I get anxious af, because I know that I'll probabpy meet a survivor that will know every inch of the map, have all the perks that gives him 4 extra chances and I can't do much about it unless I play a strong top tier killer.
---
Truly a shame. Also, what did they change? I've not heard at all about any change.
---
She still has fun and finally helps the team lol
---
There is only one entrance to where you are and you keep looking somewhere. After you already know for sure it's a Ghost Face? That is very brave my friend! Very cocky! This man has balls of steel. Can he even juggle you to a hook with those?
---
‚ÄúNearly.‚Äù Do you know what nearly means? That means almost every female survivor, meaning not every female survivor, but most of them. I‚Äôm sorry that wasn‚Äôt clear enough for you : (
---
Missing a shitpost tag my dude
---
If you want to know which Killer has the absolute worst design, look no further than Plague.
---
Her jumpscares get me litterally every time. Sometimes I'll hit like 4 in a row and I just üò∂
---
No i dont please tell me :( lmao relax dude no need to go on the offensive if this is the kind of argument you have
---
You literally came at me and tried to quote me as an opposition when my quote literally means the same thing I was saying. Why don‚Äôt you relax and learn to read before you try to start shit lmfao
---
Oooh ok
---
Supersize me
---
At certain levels in the bloodweb, more than just 2 perks will appear. It goes up to a maximum of 4 perks appearing, and being able to grab a total of 3 of you manipulate the bloodweb well enough. Well needed change!
---
I also remember though when BBQ didn't have the bloodpoint addition onto it - i'm pretty sure it was added to the perk to encourage killer queues because back then Survivor queue times were like 30+mins
---
Unfortunately
---
isnt that the point?
---
This took me to long
---
Im pretty calm dude I simply asked you a question dont get worked up over it :)
---
I was wondering the same thing.

She has an extra-bright flashlight that burns survivors, instantly injuring them.
---
If she t bags after downing, you instantly gain the mangled status effect
---
I- is this Roblox?
---
Thanks, I finally understand :)
---
You get respect from me because you play how you want

I really didn‚Äôt I just asked you a question and it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre creating a conversation neither, but whatever you say to make yourself sleep at night
---
Hoorah! has such wonderful meme potential.
---
Everyone who plays this game is toxic, you, me, everyone.
---
This how DbD work
---
Thats actually a pretty good idea, even though they won't do it. It'd be nice if my Devotion 8 was worth soemthing lol
---
If ashes theme wasnt space truckin i would be very disappointed
---
So far, the servers kick me inside of a few seconds.
---
Is that just everyone leaving?
---
I always hide for a few seconds and attempt to get eyes on the killer in case they try to tunnel vision me immediately after the game begins when I use a big booster. Like you said, I feel like it happens to me a lot too.
---
This is amazing great job!
---
Can we just ban this cunt? All he does is repost other people's memes and watermarks them to claim them as his own.
---
Sounds like a bad change, I sure do hate getting 70 green add ons and tier 2 Hope on my level 47 bloodweb. Really lifts my spirit and makes my day so much brighter!
---
This shit happens to me every single time. Like why is it even a thing in the game
---
I agree, and other things too...
---
People with Borrowed Time act like they can purposefully lead the Killer right to the hook and unhook the other Survivor *right in front of the Killer's nose*.
---
Killers who left the hook, who weren't camping.
---
Is that a fair use of Borrowed Time, for a Survivor to say "Haha I fucked up and instead of stealthing this unhook safely like I *literally could without any trouble* I'm going to rely on Borrowed Time!"
---
Borrowed Time wasn't made for that, I understand that you cannot really code the game to distinguish between "this is a Killer who is purposefully tunneling and/or camping and therefore BT should proc" and "this is an idiot survivor and therefore BT should not proc".
---
I just don't think it's really fair for Killers who are in the process of leaving (it takes 7 seconds for a 115% Killer to move 32 meters so that the hook is no longer in their TR, and this doesn't account for breaking nearby pallets/kicking gens either) to get punished by BT.
---
Also if you are leaving the hook and someone does an unsafe hook rescue because they have BT, doesn't that tilt? It's easy for me to want to put down the other person through BT because I wasn't tunneling and wasn't camping and suddenly I'm being punished for not being able to instantly teleport 40 meters away.
---
Don‚Äôt talk that way about our crack goblin!
---
Oh god, a Pig with Franklins? *STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!* 
---
Jokes aside, awesome job!!

It gets easier, trust me.
---
Thank you for the lovely message calling me the N-word. Really love it when bigots get offended.
---
Share the same face model
---
The killer exiting out of the lobby instantly is the ultimate act of cowardice. They're so scared of people saying not-nice things to them, that they deny the chance to discuss anything.
---
Every time this comes up, some folks act like the only thing survivors talk about in the postgame chat is how much they hate killers.
---
If they could legally make that work realistically I‚Äôd love it. When Ash came out I turned off the game music and just blasted Space Truckin‚Äô while leveling and waiting for lobbies.
---
I fucking haaaaaaaaate when you make a dumb call and watch the shit tornado ensue. But I just tell myself to learn and not make the mistake again.
---
You act like killer footsteps are anywhere near audible when they aren't shoving their weapon up your ass.
---
If she‚Äôs picking him up and dropping him repeatedly why didn‚Äôt he recover? I feel like ai‚Äôm missing something because that typically leads to the survivor breaking the killers grasp.
---
Laurie
---
Wuuuuzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaap
---
It wasn't that hard a game, but still a challenge.  I didn't know who I liked to play most as a killer main but I bought ghost face and i actually really like him.
---
Basement Bubba. No way am I gonna risk my life to save them. And I almost escaped too. Just got the gate open when I got downed.
---
The perk itself completely requires on the intelligence of a human player.. lol. Asking behavior to nerf human intelligence is hillarious
---
So you think that there should be no skill gap between good and bad players? What an interesting idea
---
This guy has an alt account that features the N word rather prominently iirc
---
Keep lookin around. Can't remember how I did mine
---
Yeah he‚Äôs good. Sometimes I aim for the stalk, other times I just use it to sneak up on de bois because it might be a waste of time
---
I'm just confused as to how the flashlight will affect the demogorgon. Considering he doesn't have eyes...Now for me, that begs the question... What is Steve through the lit up flashlight in it's mouth?

Reposts sure are annoying but this cunt is a whole other level.
---
He dc after a few times let alone he didn't even struggle. He was really pissed off. And just wanted to die so we could move on to the next game.
---
I play both evenly but only complain about survivors as a survivor. I understand my respective enemy in each role being annoying or worse, but when my teammates are lousy, that bothers me.
---
Idk if it works because I just saw it and didn‚Äôt go thru. Go to change user flair if you know where that is, then in the top right corner it says edit. Pick one and edit I guess idk
---
Wrong. 
---
Sandbagging is when you bodyblock a survivor, preventing them from moving, vaulting, or dropping a pallet. It's common with trolls but it's also really easy to do accidentally. 
---
Usually teams that bomb the hook will have the healthy people in the back and let the unhooked guy up front in order to force the killer to hit the 3 guys before reaching the 4th dude.
---
I did what u said, and went after different people after hooking one guy and I still got same amount of blood points

Skrah

Remember when they told us they added end game collapse to help stop toxicity and survivors holding the game hostage?

Cuz I sure remember
---
Killer bias like WHOOOOOAA.
---
You give an idea for balancing a killer or an add on or a perk or what not? Get downvoted for filth.
---
You say the same about a survivor perk? UPVOTED, LIKED, GIVEN ORAL SEX. YOU WIN LIFE. 
---
Reddit Killers is a joke you hear on Twitch for a reason.
---
The only difference between Rank 8 and Rank 1 is time investment. If you can hit Rank 8, you can get to Rank 1 if DbD is your "main game".
---
I think the reason is they tried to keep the whole couple matching theme with them so Frank and Julie look really similar and really generic whilst Joey and Susie were made to be more unique and have their own Styles and personality themed clothing which break from the generic Legion setup.
---
Joey's outfits being very out there to grab the attention everyone's attention and edgy as his description says he's very eager to impress and he's very headstrong.
---
Whilst Susie has a more reserved modest outfit that still has a very heavy school theme which is different from the rebel theme of the legion this matches her shy and naive personality whilst also showing off the she is typical geeky girl they said in the Legion dev stream
---
I think it was when Freddy was reworked
---
Damn rain man ... we got to hook up in game. Lol
---
Fuck me, I spelt Plague wrong.
---
Killer.
---
I know Legacy Leatherface doesn't exist. But that's what it looks like to me.
---
not stoinks.
---
And that's why my swf cleanse all totems
---
What ended up happening to Christa?
---
Second perk sounds pretty bad actually, no one is not gonna touch a generator for 2 minutes and even then 20 seconds of exposed is easy enough to loop, and then the killer still has 20 more seconds to wait before it activates again (not that it will because everyones gonna be on gens)
---
The first perk is super iffy, wouldn‚Äôt you rather want something that helps you mid game? The second perk seems cool and interesting. And you had me on the third perk until the part where it helps survivors because they fast vault? And that still consumes a token? Why would you want to help them
---
Another benefit to console, the killers red stain doesnt go through fucking walls.

NOED, bloodwarden, and camping. Name a better trio
---
Yeah now toxic killers pick the last survivor up, bring them to the hatch,  and then close it on their face or just sit between the two gates that spawned within spitting distance of each other.  It's truly awful.
---
I do not understand how the Plague works cause I don't really play killer and I don't like the look of the Plague, someone care to explain?
---
Man ur advice sucks, tunneling is the only way to get kills
---
A few seconds later...you find out it's actually a Nurse with Insidious hiding behind the exit gate waiting 4 u.
---
As long as he walked with a limp and had his axe, I‚Äôm down.
---
Thanks for planting that in my brain, now I'm disappointed.
---
I'd love to have 2v8 with 10 gens or really just other game modes. That 2 killers vs 1 survivor peaked my interest, but there would have to be no scratch marks. It could be a lot of fun.
---
Stbfl thirdseal bloodhound and bamboozles my fun build for them lol
---
Got it. Could be that she was going to let him go. In my experience if a killer picks up and drops a survivor it‚Äôs to speed up the wiggle progress so the survivor can escape.
---
I like to change my flair a lot and I haven't had any problems so far
---
Depends on how you measure a win I guess.
---
If it's, did the survivors get out alive? Then survivors 100%. Odds of a evenly matched killer with a evenly matched SWF, I'd always bet on SWF.
---
Not if you're good, just look at top level play. Tunneling rarely happens. I'm sorry that this advice may offend you, but it's literally the only advice that I can give you. You just have to get better at the game.
---
This sub definitely leans towards killer. The official forums are more balanced.
---
Just holding your sprint key stops the heal even if you aren't moving

---
Is Demogorgon the tallest killer?  Wraith is pretty lanky and Myers is pretty tall as well.
---
Yeah, but she is badly designed. Badly designed =!= bad. Most matches you wont actually get to use your power unless you have the apple add-ons. At that point she is basically just a 115% Killer with no power against broken survivors.
---
It's kinesiology tape
---
Typically activity that involve a lot of precise arm and hand movements tend to put a lot of strain on it.
---
Things like cycling, volleyball and in Min's case gaming
---
All it really does is helps with the strain and spraining also gives you a lot better movement
---
You really don't, I've never once in my life encountered an endgame chat that isn't the most toxic place on the planet. I once got told to hang myself in Russian.
---
Meh, I tend to get it activated even when I‚Äôm doing gens. But I see how it‚Äôs kinda up to chance sometimes
---
I think that whoever reveals him should have their progress reset, but only their progress and you can‚Äôt reset it if it‚Äôs active.
---
So long story short, I was trying to teach my cousin how to play survivor but he was more interested in killing (he‚Äôs a teen so it makes sense). So I loaded him up into a game and he managed to get some people down but they would always wiggle out so I had informed him that he had to hook them again but he couldn‚Äôt so I took over and attempted and failed to hook survivors on the same hook once someone had already been hooked. I managed to get them all hooked in the basement and played the waiting game and they just would not die. They claimed they weren‚Äôt hacking but would not leave the game and insisted that I dc instead. I managed to wait out 3 of them but the last guy just would not leave and I‚Äôm assuming they were trying to boot me offline because they kept inviting me to their party but I refused to join just to be safe. Is it possible to hack on ps4? I closed the hatch and everything and he still did not die.
---
I wish it‚Äôd just be the plus there, I think it‚Äôs nice, but the black is a bit much.
---
If you encounter a Myers with Noed then he's horny
---
Either you cleanse and you have an easier time hiding or you don‚Äôt and I find and down you either way that hook has your name on it
---
Definitely need the limp. I want post-concussion Jack, after Wendy beat the shit out of him with the baseball bat.
---
I wish there was some perk or feature that if a survivor stood in the exit zone for X amount of seconds they would suffer some status effect or something that would prevent them from leaving or prehaps prevent people in the dying state from crawling to the escape so people would be less inclined to bm at the exit.
---
As a rank 5, it gets pretty toxic. (Not sure if rank 5 is high enough to be considered "high rank" but its what ive got lol)
---
I mean tbh I get it, faster movement speed and insta down at all times, unlike t3 which is only temporary. It is really annoying to deal with though
---
He looks like if you poked him, his skin would erupt in maggots
---
No I‚Äôm talking about survivors. They wouldn‚Äôt die on hook I even closed the hatch on the last person and they‚Äôre still hanging. After I decided to leave I got a message from the last survivor that should have been dead from this screenshot saying ‚ÄúI won yayyyyyy‚Äù
---
Fuck yeah and have him say here‚Äôs Johnny right before he strikes. Like how the pig roars before she lunges
---
I don't know if it's just a visual bug or visual and BP bug, but when the lobby disconnects when I'm killer, the blood points I got from the match changes to 0. I don't know if this actually takes away my BP from the match. I'll have to remember to check my total before and after next time I play
---
Good: Ruin, Bamboozle, Enduring, Spirit Fury + Cold Dirt, Joey's Mixtape
---
Fun: Barbecue, Third Seal, Infectious Fright, Monitor &amp; Abuse + Stolen Sketch Book, Mural Sketch
---
I've been having a lot of fun with Fright builds. Generally you will leave a survivor on the ground if Fright shows you someone else, and hook them if it doesn't, then using Barbecue to find other targets that will usually be 40+ meters away since Fright + Monitor is 40m. With Legion specifically, you try to get Third Seal on all survivors as early as possible using Frenzy, to aid your slugging, but Knock Out can also be used instead of Third Seal or Barbecue. Or you can use variations on the build, such as incorporating chase perks, going with Fright, Enduring, Spirity Fury + Barbecue/Knock Out, or incorporating perks like Ruin, Bamboozle... The core is really just Fright + Knock Out or Third Seal. (On killers that have high innate snowball potential like Nurse and Billy you can go without Knock Our/Third Seal.)
---
I hate tunneling so much, I feel bad when I see anyone or myself targeted to be tunneled :/ Which is why as killer, I always make sure to hit the rescuer unless the rescuer is toxic, I steal their points by farming the survivor then downing and hooking the rescuer &gt;:)
---
It's cuz Susie and Joe do their clothes shopping at expensive clothing stores.
---
Really like the third perk, would be a fun mechanic. Dont know about the first two, one doesnt have an effect ingame and the other forces people to play the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù way. Afterall, it‚Äôs a videogame and we should play the way we want.
---
But the best part was the power. New, fun and probably good depending on the killer‚Äôs level.But a suggestion would be add more bonuses to the tiers of fear level. I think my tiers would be a bit op, but it‚Äôs easier to balance if goes live.
---
1 token: 3% movement speed(might slow the base movement speed to balance this)
---
2 tokens: 5% action speed
---
3 tokens: exposed status to all survivors
---
4 tokens: can mori survivors
---
You basicly have Devour Hope.
---
No, I‚Äôm at rank 9 and I got there by tunneling, ur advice sucks
---
Hell yeah. If Ash can get some one-liners, so can good old Jack
---
Last Man Standing: the winner is the last of 4 players alive. 
---
Of the 4 players, the two that are farthest away from the killer fill their "coward meter". Once filled, it makes the survivor scream three times over 30 seconds.
---
Each player has Bond so they can more easily throw the others under the bus while in a chase.
---
When you get hooked, youre instantly sacrificed. You respawn one single time far away from the killer. On your next down, its a mori, and you're out.
---
I like the matter of the mist stuff personally, however, make it likely "Slightly/Moderately/Greatly" to push it further, and maybe usage of also offerings that alter the mist to be returned at all perk levels. I'd make it more related to level of offerings rather than specific types like: "...all offerings up to Uncommon/Rare/Very Rare" or if too powerful then "Common/Uncommon/Rare".
---
Ayyyy you fucking sly dog you ;) just make sure to get a buddy to bodyblock Kamil since you're going for a 1 def pure
---
Higher than me, my best is like 11
---
&gt;:0
---
Thank you!! That means a lot!
---
Sounds great. A gamemode where fucking your friends over is the goalüòÇ.
---
I'm not saying what they did was justified. I'm just trying to think like a toxic killer.
---
Yeah he like slinks over the thing and it's just so chilling it really adds to the bestial characterization of the demogorgan
---
yeah it's a bug where sometimes they just wont die. never heard of it happening to everyone before but bugs are weird.
---
also of all things why would THIS be hacking? they can hack but instead of making themself invincible or super fast they choose to hack in...infinite hook timer?
---
i think you know that it was supposed to happen.
---
I want a Bowl of Happiness!
---
oink oink muhfucker. gimme your medkit.
---
Thank you though! üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
This is the exact type of scenario I was talking about
---
Plague can vomit on survivors/gens/vaults/pallets, etc.  If you touch the vomit, you start to get infected.  If she pukes on your more, if you do gens, if you sprint, the infection meter (circle, I guess) goes up, at 100%, you become injured &amp; broken.  If you cleanse, you get rid of the infection, and you're healed, but she can go up to the fountain you cleansed at and get corrupt purge.  This turns her puke black and let's it deal damage.  Problem is: she now has the best ranged damage source in the game, for a decent chunk of time, while everyone else on your team is injured and one shot.  It's not good for the survivors.
---
Oh, I think that's a glitch, sometimes if a survivor DCes when they're dying on the hook, it keeps the game going for a few extra seconds. It's happened to me before.
---
I never survive the Plague because PEOPLE CLEANSES 
---
except for one time, I was playing with a streamer and gave him/her a flashlight, and guess what?
---
NO ONE CLEANSED
---
AND NO ONE DIED
---
I was so happy that game :D
---
Good thing it wasn‚Äôt me
---
That's not rank one. I am rank one with a thousand hours in the game, playing mainly nurse and huntress. I know what I'm talking about.
---
Are you really using adrenaline to defend noed?
---
Nice to see killer mains feeling some type of way
---
it looks like something you could be hit over. like windows or the fences on haddonfield. big brain clown tho i didnt know you could swing over those
---
Nice
---
This wasn‚Äôt seconds this was minutes almost going on for an hour. I ended up giving up because it‚Äôs a Saturday night and I‚Äôd rather just play another game. Ended up getting a message from what I‚Äôm assuming was the hacker saying ‚ÄúI won yayyyyyy‚Äù
---
Yes actually. If an object is low enough to where the killer can reach over it to your survivor hitbox, it counts as a hit. I've seen it before on the fences on Haddonfield too.
---
nea deserved that*
---
I was super questioning it honestly. This clown was kinda... scarily good. I've honestly never been caught at that particular loop before so I was unsure.
---
That looks like an extremely uncomfortable hammock
---
I honestly don't know haha.
---
Weird. Never had that happen.
---
Shit, if it showed up in my bloodweb and I had the patience to wade through all the camping killers, I'd have also tossed on Breakdown. Actually, whenever I could've gotten an unhook through the matches with several camping killers, I found that I could've done with a couple more tokens of Distortion, but I guess that's what I get for trying to be the savior.
---
This one‚Äôs for the gay women üíñ
---
I feels like it sometimes
---
Fi hunnit bot baebee I mayyyk yoo feel soooooo gud joe
---
Good luck in purple ranks, bud.
---
Oddly enough, several killers I was up against played Doctor and was extremely desperate to hook everyone and protect Hex: Ruin before a single gen was touched.
---
I thought it would be a bit funnier...
---
No that's something different. There's not an exact term for it. I refer to it as "our X led the killer right to me" (X being the name of the Survivior). It's kinda scummy but if ur playing for yourself it's a strategy you can use.
---
Me toooo
---
Yeah
---
The perks are really fresh and unique. The power idk how I feel I'd have to see it in action but I love it.
---
Wait is that literally all it is? Framerate? The fuck is with this game, I got this shit running on the lowest settings and it skips like that.
---
I once stepped in my own trap  
---
after I had picked a survivor up  
---
and the exit gates were open  
---
Needless to say those were a stressfull few seconds
---
I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs badly designed. Her corrupt isn‚Äôt her true power, it‚Äôs just an extension of her power. She can turn all survivors broken, except that iron will won‚Äôt counter it and the survivors are extremely loud, they can‚Äôt hide in lockers and that Claudette that hides in the corner either had to do the unhook or do the injected gen, getting her injected and much easier to hide or not contribute to the team, so plague only has 3 people to worry about doing gens and unhooks. 
---
You factor in her addons, and she has wallhacks in they don‚Äôt cleanse, or you get corrupt every time they finish a gen, so it doesn‚Äôt matter if they don‚Äôt cleanse. 
---
She isn‚Äôt the strongest killer, but she‚Äôs far from the weakest.
---
I appreciate the info. :) Is there something about my post that makes it seem like I haven't seen the show? I've seen the entire series.  I am just appreciating the extra effort from the game devs to add extra DnD lore.
---
I think there is a slight killer bias, but that's possibly because we have nothing better to do while sitting in queue.
---
It has a habit of doing this if it runs out while being picked up, even though it doesn‚Äôt work the skillcheck pops up
---
Nah, Spirit's vault will never be beat.
---
With doctor and BBQ I average maybe 50-60k a game. Easy to max his deviousness out early.
---
No I knew about the Bandits I just didn't know if we got her fate confirmed. I know in the background of that moment after she told Clementine to run, I heard a gunshot. I just didn't know if she was confirmed dead or not
---
Spirit doesn't have a vault animation.
---
So one of the survivors turned into Joey? New Legion rework confirmed!1!!!1!!!1!1!1!1!1!!1!!! 
---
pls bhvr its so bad now
---
Yeah the only non-demo killer I‚Äôve seen on the PTB was a Ghost Face who camped and tunneled unhooks. Just generally trying to troll, sadly.
---
You‚Äôre not taking a dish using NOED like you are Adrenaline. People say using NOED makes it so you only have 3 perks but that‚Äôs wrong, you gain incentive with NOED regardless of if it activates. 
---
If it activates, then you now have perm bloodlust and insta downs. 
---
If it doesn‚Äôt, then that means they did all 5 totems, which is 70+ seconds (14 sec a totem x 5 total), even more for travel time, so the equivalent of an extra gen. 
---
Good survivors who run adrenaline usually don‚Äôt heal for the last 1-2 gens, so they‚Äôre walking around the map being injured, so they‚Äôre 1 hit and make a lot of noise assuming no Iron Will. If they‚Äôre already healed then Adrenaline hasn‚Äôt done much for them, it‚Äôs barely any different than Sprint Burst. Adrenaline takes risk whereas NOED doesn‚Äôt, 
---
Adrenaline rewards your risky play whereas NOED rewards your subpar play, you‚Äôre betting on losing a main objective for the game even starts.
---
There's a difference between skill and spending all day everyday playing this game with varying levels of latency or lag (which I have actually been told the issue with Skillchecks is more often framerate which is WTF because I play this game on the lowest settings to prevent that shit) to never ever miss great skill checks and there shouldn't be a skill that is reliant on rng because just as it fucks me over with back to back skillchecks, can fuck the killer over with a survivor that is extremely lucky and can work on gens with 0 fucking skill checks.
---
Nea has always been on hook duty. Even more so than killers.
---
The difference between piggy and the demo is that the pig is suppose to be stealthy and you can't hear her terror radius so she can get closer to you easier, allowing you to find a pallet, versus the demo which gives you time to find a loop because you can hear and see him, but he has way less of a charge time
---
Why everyone is talking like am a survivor main? I mainly play killer (even if it's at 20 fps) i Just think that noed is extremely annoying hence every killer in rank 12 uses this shit
---
Hi Drew, I'm Dad.
---
Hmmmm, that whooshing sound must be the Spirit without beads.....
---
No. People are using to signal the killer is gone.
---
Metoo this meme will never get old
---
There's a difference between just trolling once on awhile and just spamming troll posts, don't act like a 12 year old
---
Getting your kicks by using disgusting jargon online anonymously says a lot about how your shitty life is going, pal.
---
How does borrowed time exactly work. Ive had it but never used it.
---
Tbh I would too if I saw that thing
---
Really? I guess I was wrong all along.
---
&gt;me playing PC on a 1 gig graphics card
---
2 killers vs 1 survivor? Lol
---
That's a really hot ~~Trapper~~ Huntress, not gonna lie.
---
This is not true at all
---
Another option might be to increase the struggle time, damaging the hook means it's less effective - giving survivors a longer duration to rescue people on the hook.
---
This looks like a body made from perks. You got the bottom one is legs. Top is head. And sides are arms
---
So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm being sacrificed
---
For a while, it was at least on console. But on PC, they're flailing away the second the killer has left.
---
No, you're right
---
No
---
10 gens, 2 killers, 6 survivors
---
*insert comment about trench ware fare in the world wars*
---
At some point devs have to take into consideration gameplay vs lore authenticity. So while we can all say ‚Äúyah that SHOULDN‚ÄôT work‚Äù its kinda that, or make the demogorgan immune to flashlights, which obvi can‚Äôt be done. So we are probably just gonna get a weird explanation of ‚Äúthe entity doesn‚Äôt understand eyes, so flashlights just produce a burning sensation when shined on a killers face‚Äù instead of it being a genuine ‚Äúooh ouch owie my EYES‚Äù  kinda reaction. Which does fit lore wise bit we all would know it‚Äôs to explain why it works on an eyeless creature
---
Motherfucking JoJo reference all day
---
Bruh. I've always used it when the killer is proxy camping
---
I'm dead
---
Noted
---
This is so wrong. You should check out gameplay from Fungoose. He‚Äôs a Twitch steamer + killer main with 7,000 hours in the game. He mains Plague and 4ks 9/10 matches at red ranks. Like actually its not even exaggerated. He rarely loses. 
---
Unfortunately he‚Äôs in Australia so he has to stay at green/purple ranks or else wait 20-30 minutes for games. But he has VODs of him playing in red ranks, they‚Äôre not hard to find. Also vids on YouTube.
---
One very small thing about the third perk: it's pointless to have the "unable to grab part" on the vault switching because you already cannot grab a full health survivor from a vault. You can only grab an injured survivor from a vault and the difference of a grab vs. a down in a window is very minor.
---
I only do that when the killer is camping some poor man
---
Using Killers ability e.g. Chainsaw or hatchets, hooking survivors, chasing, etc.
---
One thing you want to avoid is chasing someone you couldn't catch in the first 30 seconds. Don't camp the hooked survivor unless others are overly altruistic.
---
Eh.. it looks like a pasta noodle with 80% of the sauce washed off.
---
Spine chill tells you if a killer is looking toward you, that can be really helpful regardless of terror radius and Dark Sense works outside the terror radius. They both give valuable information, i wouldnt be against giving mthe affected perks a secondary effect to buff them but i dont think this change in itself is unhealthy. Yea, it kinda sucks that there are 70 some perks and only 4 of them are really common, and considered worthy of a slot. The game will get stale for devoted fans if that doesn't change.
---
Or maybe they just want to get into another game asap, or have to go because most people especially adults, only have a limited amount of time to play?
---
I feel like he's one of those guys who only look like someone from the side or behind.
---
Lol I guess it‚Äôs all good then
---
I mean you know going into it that Ruin is a dice roll
---
Hey! I'm rank 7 I'll have you know!
---
Honestly, I don't identify myself as either main. I'm playing both roles rather equally and I try to stay objective in discussions like 'rework NOED or Adrenaline' but this sub will never believe that because majority think that if your suggestion is to nerf a survivor perk then you're a filthy killer main and vice versa.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you just buy the chapter? It‚Äôs great!!!
---
I used to think old Freddy was OP
---
Then I realized every single one of them used NOED cuz... Well... He sucked ass
---
I love how there‚Äôs no way the killer isn‚Äôt coming after that but boy still goes to open a chest lmfao
---
FWIW, I thought they already had his face model, they just decided they needed to swap it out at the last minute for some reason
---
So my headcanon is that the costumes for different survivors/killers might be them from other timelines or universes. Why would Claudette wear that traditional African healer outfit unless she WAS one? Or Jeff in his gala suit.  Ace's pilot outfit, from a life that could have happened. Victorian Doctor, drowned Trapper. I think it makes the Entity's realm a lot more interesting.
---
If you‚Äôre lucky, there might be another one when the Stranger Things update drops
---
atleast its next to some boxes
---
Can‚Äôt wait until they add the Pain
---
The Clown looks like a Celestial Dragon lmao.
---
I already had spirit so I just decided to unlock Adam with shards. I don‚Äôt buy chapters unless it‚Äôs licensed, I prefer unlocking characters with shards.
---
You got a storm coming, my dude
---
You're being vague. SWF is OP and has always been, that is nothing new. They're not unbeatable  but certain killers suffer far more than others against SWF.
---
It‚Äôs always funny to chase a survivor til they get the hint by you just colliding with them and furiously nodding your head.
---
I think increasing the fog is fine but idk about its interactions with Offerings.
---
Perhaps if it causes the fog to get thinner for the killer but thicker for survivors, or if survivors suffer from hallucinations of sort.
---
He did exactly what you wanted him to do when you pretended to phase?
---
That's not true at all... Camping and tunneling complaints happen a lot more at lower ranks
---
can you chat if the killer leaves though? The first day they had dedi's in this current PTB after about 15 seconds in the lobby i would get disconnected from the host, every time?
---
This made me really sad for some reason
---
What a brutal mori
---
Shaming specific players is agaisnt the rules, you remove his username and you'll be fine
---
And yet? Thana, at best, with all 4 survivors no mithered and assuming they all live till the end to get maximum debuff, adds 64 seconds to the total gen time. You get a measly one extra minute if ALL survivors spend ALL game injured at rank 3 of the perk. It's a terrible perk compared with other, better options. 
---
Penalty to the killer will do nothing, just like the emblem discouragement, multiple perks, general ineffectiveness, and amount of toxicity does not prevent people from camping. You have to provide more carrot, less stick.
---
Pathetic comparison
---
Yeah, I didn't know the first time I played against plague.  Ended up having 2 out of my 3 teammates messaging me blaming me for cleansing.  Now that I play killer more and actually have plague, I realize how much easier it is to hit people with the corrupt purge (whether they're injured or even full health) than it is to just down them with your basic attack.  Mainly because you can just chuck it over pallets/windows, walls of a jungle gym, it doesn't give you a long cooldown like swinging, and you can hit multiple people in one go.
---
Wtf why does Nancy actually look like Pam
---
No. Listen.
---
If you are not okay with totems being broken, then do not run totem perks. The whole point of a totem perk is to provide devastating and unstable effects that can be revoked if unprotected.
---
I hate the word bigot bigot that bigot this I don't disagree with you I just don't like that word
---
Yeah I had the same happen to me. Luckily nobody found it
---
What????
---
All now he gets to be tortured for all eternity until he loses all hope or will to continue and ceases to exist in any capacity.
---
;(
---
It would be worse than death threats man. The FBI would have to monitor dbd endgame chats if they were on console
---
Can't you join other countries? Honestly with the ping I use to get from killers you'd think east coast NA was smack dab on the moon anyway.
---
I play a lot of survivor. I loop...a LOT. I'm not saying hide and seek is fun. But mindgames are pitifully easy to avoid on 99% of pallets on 90% of maps. 
---
Everything else you've mentioned took me all of 4 hours to learn and another 10 to get bored of. It's not that hard to build a mental map of the...map...in your head, and then just run from structure to pallet to structure. The most exciting bit of this game for me is hitting DS since I have below average reaction times and 1.5 mb/s internet.
---
survivor is definitely boring as shit
---
Last time i used spine chill i could detect Myres in tier 1. Its just a shame that spine chill would be getting worse. I love the perk, i use it every game
---
I agree to some extent, but at I'd disagree with you saying a lot of the new perks in the ST DLC are meh. They're decent perks that can be used for fun. Just because they're not uber strong meta perks doesn't mean they're bad. I agree that there has been little to no actual flavor added for survivors in the last year.
---
I really gotta look at sub rules before posting sometimes lol
---
killer when the survivor unhooks themselves
---
sauce pls
---
Him reaching up to the trap wasn't part of the removal animation. That was the beginning of the snap animation. He still have 3% of the progression bar left.
---
If you mainly play killer at 20 fps you're probably below green ranks and get 360 every time.
---
doesnt even make sense since unsafes dont give stacks :(
---
I will greatly fuck you
---
You are forced to stay, you can‚Äôt escape during blood warden, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told so it sounds like the coward would just hang out at the gate waiting out the timer
---
Well I don't play on console so I can't say anything most ppl on pc don't run noed or camp.
---
the only thing that can barely be mindgamed are large structures and those maps don't happen that often. In addition maybe stuff like pig tree on top, but once the pallet is gone it's gone.
---
I seriously doubt you loop as well as you think you do. Running to every pallet and using it up after running around it once is not looping.
---
Except if everybody's playing Meg because she's broken,  you know it'll take the devs years to figure out what to do (if their response to DS was an indicator of future behavior).
---
If BHVR was capable of doing more than once thing at a time it'd be fine,  but we've already seen they can't.
---
May her days be filled with people using urban evasion, small game, and flashlights.
---
That‚Äôs why you can change one daily each day and hey why not try something new?
---
if that's the case they need to completely remove this killers ability to see anything when the dlc goes live. Just turn up the volume by 100% and he'll be good to go.
---
Yehea u know boah
---
BBQ was in the shrine about 2 weeks ago so now everyone has it
---
Well, the hatch is kind of a bailout a lot of the time, and teams can bodyblock Killers to get the gate open, so while it is true you've lost ONCE (can't count the gate as a loss when the bad placement is why it fails), matchmaking is still a travesty.
---
Every. One. Is. Playing. Survivor. EVERY FUCKING TIME. SURVIVOR LOBBIES TAKE 10 MINUTES TO GET INTO KILLER LOBBIES TAKE 30 SECONDS TO MAKE AND FILL.
---
*Working on a generator, fightend and all alone, you only hear the footsteps before it's too late. A cold knife tip scratches the back of your neck. You freeze with uncertainty what will happen next. You feel a cold but strong hand lift you up from the back of your neck into the air, then down back first into the generator. The fear yet curiosity has you frozen again. Your eyes meet a sweat iron-forged chest with beefcake fortitude. Myers has come. You can die peacefully now.*
---
Im always sent to badham and haddonfield. You‚Äôre lucky, atleast thats a interesting map.
---
They'll like that, though. DCing forfeits your gains, and if they're teabagging, they explicitly want you to suffer. Just go farm BP with something like placing traps or breaking remaining pallets. If they're REALLY jerks, they might even get themselves caught in the collapse venturing out to troll you.
---
This fucking kills me every time I watch it and I cannot for the life of me figure out why lmao amazing meme
---
Getting just a tad old
---
This thread did not age well, lol
---
Actually at my opinion they shouldn‚Äôt change anything. I like how toxic it is and on my opinion i want it to stay as a super toxic game.
---
I hear it's like a wave. Rank 5 is peak toxicity, Rank 1s tend to require chill to perform at that level, although there are SWF carries around red.
---
Similarly, purples are cool but greens are often trash-people.
---
They can still do donuts until they take a hit. I've seen it happen.
---
I bet he is 16 with a 9-5 job .paying Nothing but his skins and dlcs for the game, while his parents baby him after he whines about not getting FUCKING ICE CREAM. I HOPE HE BURNS IN HELL WITH THE REST OF THE KNOW-IT-ALL TEENS OF THIS GAME AND U KNOW WHAT? I HOPE HIS PS4 FUCKING DEATH LIGHTS ITSELF AND HE HAS TO PAY FOR ANOTHER ONE AND AFTER THAT HIS ACCOUNT GETS ERASED AND HE HAS TO RESTART AND HE CRIES HIMSELF TO SLEEP CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? I KNOW THIS MAN. I REMEBER THAT VOICE AND SOMETIMES IT FLOWS THROUGH ME LIKE A POISON IN MY VAINS. .... He hurt my feelings.. he said that exact same thing to me at the very end.... I almost did it.... I hate him.
---
What if I get 8 hooks before noed, then the survivors magically become tbagging infinity loopers as soon as exits are powered?
---
I thought a Doctor was trying to farm today, but it turned out he was just a psychopath.
---
The only time I'm super altruistic is when I'm running David with BT and WGLF
---
Dope
---
If i wanted to replace noed with some other perk, what should i get? (Rank 44 wraith, bbq, unrelenting, noed, distressing)
---
How is it possible to get healed while running? Anyway that's some baby survivor complaints because he wanted so bad to hide behind this exact particular rock 30 meters away
---
Playing *agaisnt* a new killer is new content for survivors too, in a way
---
Missed attacks so you have a better chance to scare them away and get back. If you land a git on them and they cant save then they freak out.
---
I‚Äôm gonna hold you to that. See you in 17 days ü§ôüèº
---
So rude. He should have gotten you back on your feet and then bodyblocked you in a corner so that you could at least teabag back!
---
I personally run Third Seal all the time and people always comment in post-game how devastating it was. I would not say it's a wasted perk slot 60% of the time, and even if it was, that is the whole point of gambling with Hexes. You at least got to use it for as long as you did, and if you didn't get to use it, well then you gambled and lost try again tomorrow.
---
The problem with Ruin, however, is how disproportionately more powerful of a *perk* it is over the other perks. The other totems all have severe snowball potential, but Ruin acts immediately and require no buildup. Ruin is the only Hex that is like that, and that's why it gets substantially more usage over any other Hex.
---
The only thing about Hexes that needs changing is Ruin. It is the only "out-of-place" Hex.
---
If you hitted your great skillchecks you probaply wouldve been alive xD
---
Killer is boring for me, it feels like I'm running a freaking daycare. Only cases where I genuinely enjoy playing killer is Jumpscare Meyers or just pig in general as I like spooking the survivors.
---
The guy that replied to me is more than likely right, as PTBs are in for about 2 weeks and I missed counted and did 3. But I guess we will see
---
Yeah sounds good, got money for it?
---
Feng must throw rocks the wrong way then.
---
That was me. Ran out of time switching to d man
---
How is Meg broken?
---
Okayyyy. The 17th then lol watch you be right though üòÇ
---
I dont like stranger things but hot damn, i am so hyped for this new season!!
---
I think you need to take a chill pill.
---
Skull-kid? lol
---
I dip into 9 fps at the low points
---
Yeah, YOU found it, hehe boi
---
O well
---
It do be like that.
---
That‚Äôs funny cause I only sandbag my friends (usually on accident)
---
That is giant for you???
---
But can he attack while his power is active?
---
Mitch Hedberg's dream of McDonald's spaghetti is real! Now where are the blankets..
---
Truck-kun boutta isekai us to the Entity‚Äôs realm.
---
I played a game where one guy couldn't pass a skill check to save his life. Still managed to keep him alive with the help of a high level claudette
---
How do I even activate it? Does the killer have to be within distance and that makes it work automatically. Or is there a button I have to press? I‚Äôm on PS4
---
Adrenaline is a free health state for no risk and cant be deactivated by the killer. Noed can be deactivated. I think noed is dumb but both are crutches nonetheless. Thus risk argument is trash because it's always used wrong. Someone tried to say old MoM rewarded risk and skill when the risk was just getting hit like a normal game. They said old decisive rewarded risk because you could miss that easy ass skill check, but if you hit it, youd have a free second chance. All 4 are just second chances rewarding you for nothing. Now that the latter two are nerfed though, that doesnt change adrenaline being most likely a free life.
---
Or or... here me out. *space truckin*
---
Pretty much. Sometimes it's better to just leave when NOED is up if you can't find the totem or have the right perks to make a safe unhook
---
Good old insidious Bubba, always there to remind us how unfun and broken the game can be sometimes.
---
In my opinion it won't really do much when it comes to complaining. Since most the time noed is used in lower ranks and the chance a new survivor plays nancy and uses that perk is low.
---
Maybe he didn‚Äôt want to chase because of odor.
---
Yes PLEASE, either one would be a dream come true
---
Why does that sound kinda fun
---
This happened to me with a spirit, I looped them for two whole minutes and only got downed once NOED activated, they missed 19/20 swings and it was actually depressing
---
I could p3 but I have prestigeophobia
---
(For brand new players. Sorry if you know all this)
---
1. Learn safe and unsafe pallets and loops. The two objects and a pallet loop? Unsafe unless you can get the killer on the longer part of the loop.
---
2. Exhaustion perks, mostly lithe and balanced landing until you start seeing 83 thousand nurses then use dead hard.
---
3. Windows. Don't jump through if the killer is too close. Instead, bait out the swing and go a different way. High rank killers know this trick and will seldom fall for it.
---
4. Once you get injured, don't throw down pallets or vault windows unless absolutely necessary. You have a temporary sprint burst for a bit so run like the wind.
---
5. The "god loop" a window or two and a pallet in close enough proximity. Use this as your go to 90% of the time.
---
6. The killer shack pallet. Do NOT waste it. It's called the god pallet for a reason.
---
7. Always think about where the killer could and will be coming from. 9/10 times this will help with your distancing once the chase begins, and will give you a good chance of getting to a loop before the first hit
---
8. Never, never EVER try to jump off a high platform without balanced landing in a chase. The killer has 0 stun, whereas survivors have a full second stun.
---
9. If you're not at a loop and are about to be hit, try and 360 the killer (hundreds of 360 tutorials on YouTube so, not gonna give one here.)
---
10. As a killer main, throwing a pallet before we get there is just a pallet wasted. They are your "get out og jail free" cards so don't throw one down when we got close unless you see the lunge.
---
11. Don't try stealth past rank 16 in the chase. Only with certain builds can it be done (see monto on YouTube using the Houdini build for a good example of this done right)
---
At least when the face rework comes out he won‚Äôt look like Freddy anymore
---
Your build is considered "tryhard" when your perk selecion is between
---
Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, DS, Deadhard and
---
Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, DS, Balanced Landing
---
Wasn't there this Book of a journalist called Benedict Baker, who was investigating and found all these places, before he got pulled in?
---
Use dead hard and learn it‚Äôs not necessarily about distance but more about positioning yourself close to a loop   and learning how to play loops and use them to there full potential I recommend running object and just get into chases over and over again and learn that way
---
Well while killers get killers survivors get maps my guy
---
Not only women, but men, and children, too!
---
Even when I die. I love it if the killer genuinely gets my heartrate up. I play this game for the thrill, not the whole looping and baiting stuff.
---
Are you trolling? Sweating out the hardest achievement of yours? You know, spending one year on 100 hatchet throws means landing a hatchet once in 3-4 days. That's complete dogshit to be honest. I'd be ashamed instead. For the record, the Huntress was released on 27.07.2017 and I've got an achievement on 07.08.2017 in 1,5 weaks of chilled gameplay while learning to play her. So I am quite puzzled what kind of a feeling you're taking about. And don't tell me I'm not nice and polite. If I see shit I won't pretend it's a chocolate cake, deal with reality.
---
I'd rework trapper. Make his basic power start him with 5 traps. Give him barbed razor wire to trap windows or regular sized doorways as normal power he starts with. Lower his terror radius by a lot, let him set traps faster and give him a terrifying scream with a 60 cooldown that reveals survivor locations and also makes a difficult skill check if someone is on a gen
---
I still don't understand why that's a question.
---
So my build is kinda Tryhard?
---
It takes no more then 35-ish seconds to patrol all gens to a point where you can hear if they are worked on. You don't need Billy or Nurse for that, you need to know your maps and the best route to patrol, nothing more... You don't need vision to check gens you just need to hear 'em and if they are worked on.
---
In a little new to dbd so bare with me.... What is noeD?
---
Playing against freddy, or ghostface...this happens to me on console ALL THE TIME.
---
People bring moris so they can see the new mori for themselves. This doesn't change bow unfun it it going against instaheals and how dirty it makes some feel using them.
---
Mori is only cool on the new killer. EVERYONE wants to see it first few days. After that, it's a crime. Some survivors will willingly kill themselves just to see it the first time.
---
wow
---
ThE eNtItY
---
What?
---
Avid supporter of baiting hits and breaking ankles. A lot of people 360 which I suck at so I‚Äôll QCF left to right or vice versa to fake and bait a hit. It‚Äôs easier to do when they‚Äôre close and depending on the environment, it can confuse them because scratch marks are all over the place.
---
This is so wholesome I love it
---
You know how in Dark Souls 1 the Dragon form you take doesn't account for your animations so you end up drinking a heal by pouring it onto your Adam's Apple?
---
It's like that with Demogorgon and torch stuns.
---
God damn this is great
---
The demogorgons eyes are where its balls should be.
---
...all the while being labelled as either survivor main or killer main, because it's impossible to play both sides according to some people.
---
Dedicated servers arent ready for live yet. Its better from last time but still needs work
---
Wait till console players get to be salty in their own chat boxes
---
This Amanda guy removes the watermark of my memes and I'm the thief or what? üòÇ
---
Yeah PTB should be there to try new things out and not play sweaty in my opinion. Second game I had on the PTB it was a face camping Clown. Some people just like to ruin the fun for others.
---
Very cool!
---
Nah having self care actually helps the killer most of the time so it's definitely not try hard
---
When is it coming out?
---
I have yes of course, but you can‚Äôt seriously say it happens every time you let go of a gen, or anywhere near that amount. It‚Äôs so rare and infrequent that it‚Äôs such a small complaint that‚Äôs it‚Äôs pointless crying about it. 
---
You keep saying it‚Äôs hinging on rng but it‚Äôs not. It goes off the ability of the player to hit great skill checks. If you can‚Äôt boo hoo find the totem or gen tap, or go too reddit to cry about a perk. 
---
It‚Äôs kicking no one in the balls, you either hit them, work through it or destroy it.
---
Or you know, you could stop playing since you seem to cry about one perk?
---
it's half way there, so no, it's not.
---
The government only sucks when people don't interact with it via voting. #ABV, Always Be Voting. 
---
On a better note, the jank of Dead by Daylight is part of its charm and a part of the horror. Like when hair physics freak out on Kate and her hair briefly enters the spirit realm or when you drop a pallet on someone and it cha Cha slides them to the other end towards the killer. This game is great for having the right amount of jank.
---
Then probably the unhook happened outside of terror radius. Some stealth killers (like Ghostface) can reduce the terror radius to 0, which means they can be right next to the unhook, yet Borrowed time won't activate.
---
I would rework Trapper's trap escapes. It's pure shit for it to be random chance. Just yesterday I literally had to try to escape 12 times until the killer finally came to me. It should work like Pig's RBT removal and Plague's purification; a little slower but sure progress bar that guarantees your escape after it's full.
---
Also Doctor's madness should be allowed to go down back to level 1. Or at least let it not progress by itself when within the terror radius.
---
Also also almost everyone can be applied to this but most noticeably Billy's chainsaw hitboxes need an urgent fix.
---
Not really but it's enough that during peak times people will have to wait.
---
Why would being unable to tele to one being worked on even be an issue?  People don't even spend 20 something seconds to fucking cleanse grays.
---
Ahh, a man of culture I see

You cannot activate portals

Thus the power is useless. And then only useful to lunge

It's not bad design... it's just counterplay. Plague is actually a pretty decent killer. For both sides.

Happens with a lot of games to be fair, Rainbow Six Siege having a similar circumstance where the game will be busted for 1-3 months after an update if the bug ever even gets fixed
---
It's understandable for randoms to be selfish, but SWF have so much more control over the game and it is unnacceptable they COMPLETELY ignore the 4th survivor.
---
Damn these salty SWF sure looove to dislike anything that even remotely "triggers" their asses xD
---
Why is it always the Russians lmao
---
I hope that I get ro experience this glitch someday. It'd be pretty lit to sneak up on another Killer as Ghostface.

If thats Dwight, do we kill the Clown at the very end of the game?

---
*Happiness oinks*
---
I'm not discussing the merits of Thana, I'm saying it's already providing that carrot and yet people that are running it still decide to tunnel, which makes it even more useless.
---
The penalties to killers tunneling in this game are non-existent. The emblem discouragement is almost a bonus because of the lack of rank rewards, there are only two perks that effectively discourage tunneling and they're both teachables that take a lot of BP to unlock, and against most survivor squads tunneling/camping ends up being the effective way to play. A carrot isn't going to change any of that.
---
I see two routes to fixing this perk:
---
Easy option - remove the "delayed heal" (where you are healthy on unhook). It makes no sense, "I just have a fuckoff great meathook through my shoulder, yet am perfectly fine!", and can make it impossible to down someone if a door is open.
---
Harder option - the perk actually functions like Adrenaline, not Wolverine's healing factor; when Adrenaline procs, you are healed for one health state, for 30/45/60 seconds. After that, you return to your previous state.
---
What do you think?
---
Report him to get their attention
---
This is why i think the plague is such an underrated killer.
---
If you cleanse you give her a damaging attack that incredibally easy to use and almost always results in her downing you after finding you.
---
But, if you decide to not cleanse then you put yourself into a permanent broken state and have to rely on your own looping skips and hope that your team havent used all the pallets.
---
No one got the Rick and morty reference and I'm sad.
---
Yeah, Cleansing makes her braindead to play but not cleansing means you have to actually be good at looping and chase breaking. 
---
It's why shes so underrated.
---
No speed boost; and the exposed status is revealed when the last gen is completed/hatch is closed, rather than when someone is downed with it.
---
The problem with not cleansing however is you basically leave yourself in an a constant one hit down state and have to rely on your own looping skills a lot more than usual.
---
but in high rank (3-1) most survivors are able to loop her long enough while being affected.
---
she is nea ..
---
[Here's the trailer video](https://youtu.be/1feZopZgU2w)
---
Yeah, keys are one of those things ONLY used by scumbag SWFers who want to piss off the Killer.
---
I think those were after he got pulled in? Baker is one of the first people the Entity snatched I believe, and he found out alot of things about the Entity's realm through the various trials he was thrown into, which he then documented somehow.
---
Skull Kid!
---
So you're telling me that the Abyss is like an onion?
---
it's Freddy's new statue effect when you're asleep
---
In the words of complete business I agree
---
thanks :3
---
It's the penalty for a teammate waking you up multiple times (vs. new Freddy), I think it's called Sleep Penalty?
---
Always read the killer add ons at end of trial
---
üëπ "Yo, Trapper"
---
Nice rear the dwight have
---
Oh nvr mind
---
So just nerf him even more?
---
I would probably agree and in that sense, some of the other franchises have huge legacies as well, arguably bigger than Stranger Things will have by the time it is through but the Stranger Things series is a big hit, especially with younger audiences and is still in production, that has people talking about it and creating buzz. Maybe I'm wrong, wouldn't be the first time but I think it will be the top selling dlc and bring in more new players than any others.
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
‚Äúfirst few days‚Äù oh my sweet summer child
---
You rather be unhooked without BT or enter the struggle phase?
---
OOf, salty survivor mains xD 
---
Good to hear that you think every killer is OP. 
---
And don't you even think about nerfing my doctor, he's getting buffed soon by the devs :)
---
I'd make wraith cloak speed nearly instant just *bing* *bong* *gone* so that you can "vanish" and hopefully get a cloak mindgame hit. I'd also change his uncloak to be as fast as his cloak speed is now but instead of ringing the bell during uncloak I'd make him ring it only once at the end of the uncloak it would be a sign that he's fully uncloaked and can swing and interact.
---
I do like your idea but I'll modify it so that hitting someone with a "surprise attack" gains you a token up to 6 and by pressing the active ability button ring your bell and a targeted survivor becomes invisible (to other survivors but they can still see the shimmer) you can see the invisible survivor and you can hit the invisible survivor while you are cloaked. Invisible survivors aura is not shown by aura reading perks. Survivor becomes visible when hooked or healed.
---
All that would do is punish altruistic teammates. Terrible idea.
---
Hitboxes are a Ping issue, we've been saying that for the past year now... Grow some ears.
---
Solid strat

You sound like Billy from Stranger Things.

Here comes the trapper please step into my traps!
---
If they're slow vaulting a window they usually aren't in a chase or are trying to sneak away when youre near so you would be alerted to their location.
---
The way you pressed space 3 times was just amazing, very very impressive.
---
Kyriu SSAAAAANN
---
Man 80s style is like the epitome of ‚Äúso bad it‚Äôs good‚Äù
---
Against most survivors it is effective and even against good ones it'll still take them a while to catch on, when it becomes ineffective you adapt and do something else
---
Just straight up saying its not effective is a lie and done purely to try and keep people from doing it
---
these are dope!!!
---
But aiming is hard on console even with aim assist. I‚Äôve been pc player my entire life and bought a Xbox and just couldn‚Äôt handle the clunkyness of just looking somewhere. You have to use movement in combination with aiming on console it‚Äôs way way harder in my opinion
---
come on guys hes not super toxic ir annoying, he just explained why he thought you made a bad play and said some dumb shit bc he was frustrated. im not saying its ok to go around calling people names over a game but if you can't deal with the very limited bad words he said life's gonna be pretty tough on you
---
Wha-
---
Oh, how wrong you are... EGC is the best thing that could happen to the game. It  brings so much with it and being chased by the killer while the timer is ticking down is honestly one experience you should try ( so much adrenaline). 
---
As a killer, EGC is supposed to relieve some of your stress you got from chasing survivors for the whole god damn game. Of course, running from one gate to the other in an attempt to find the last survivor whilst the clock is ticking down is extremely nervewrecking. I've succeeded many times to open the gates at EGC stage when I was the only one left alive. It's all about stealth and timing
---
I just quite like that currently killers have to protect all their hex totems and this may remove it. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad idea tho.
---
I think ruin should be unlit for at least 30-60 seconds, the first skill check happens so early on in the game that it wouldn't make any difference at high ranks.
---
I think it‚Äôs more so the animation, male survivors all have the same basic model afaik (except David)
---
Might want to check the community info buddy
---
In the show it hated light, seeing as the place it comes from doesn't have any. That's how you blind it.
---
Literally nothing to do with whether EGC was a fair and balanced addition or not.
---
Not with dedicated servers
---
Did I say every killer? All the others are nicely balanced imo. These would be quite minor tweaks to improve the game.
---
You honestly think the hitboxes are okay? I play killer and survivor and even as a killer I always encounter bs hitboxes when I'm the one swinging.
---
Lol I love when this happens. Btw I love your hair style!
---
I say killers. It feels like killers do no wrong on this sub but everything Survivors do is toxic. Also when killers complain about stuff I don‚Äôt see them get called out for being whiny killer mains, yet it seems like when Survivors complain about anything they get destroyed for doing so. Just what I personally see! It definitely can go both ways I just feel like I see more of a bias for killers. 
---
(Also yes I am a Survivor main so perhaps this is why I see it that way idk)
---
I WANT
---
Russians are very special creatures
---
I think it all boils down to the fact that the killers are real people. If they were AIs then this game would be boring, killers make mistakes but also make odd decisions, they can also completely ignore you or get tunnel vision and chase you for 4 gens. Survivors don't know what each game will bring, what killer it is, what map they are on, what perks the killer will run, I mean I've only ever comes across an insidious Meyers once, and that was a fun march.
---
Yeah its a bit like waiting for the game to die. I have good internet (for Australia üòÇ) and can play most titles but a lot of nights lately its an 30 mins of lobby sim and dodging 1000 ping lobbies
---
youre right, and im saying OP cant deal with it since he felt it necessary to post this on reddit. he shouldve just laughed it off and go on with his life instead of placing this on reddit.
---
I wouldn't say as much as that since we'll make it alone is already a good perk, but I'd love an increase in unhooking or altruistic actions to be automatically implemented into WGLF
---
I‚Äôd say 7 or 6 gens cause two killers would cause loads of map pressure
---
&gt; Did I say every killer? All the others are nicely balanced imo. These would be quite minor tweaks to improve the game.
---
&gt; 
---
Damn, fix your internet bro. Or at least wait for the dedicated servers
---
Make this happen!
---
why
---
how dare he not obey unspoken unwritten rules nobody cares about!
---
I hope I'm not asking too much of you; but, can you please make us a DIY vid? I've never seen anything this intricate!
---
I'll take that any day over hatch standoffs or someone being immersed for 20 minutes.
---
Also those killers would've been toxic anyway, it's not like EGC brings out the evil in all killers. Pretty much every killer I've ran into has just used it to accelerate the end of the game in either direction. I haven't seen many doing stuff like that since EGC was implemented and everyone wanted to see the animation, maybe you're just running into some especially dick killers.
---
Yes it is a healthy and very fair Imo addition to the game. Once you open the exit gates or do whatever you do to proc EGC, you're supposed to get out and leave. If you stay, you're really fucking dumb. 
---
You started bitching about "killers being toxic" at EGC stage. I gave you some facts and now you're in denial \*clap\* \*clap\* \*clap\*
---
I always use resilience for vault speed on its own? Has saved me quite a few times with the vault speed.
---
With spine chill it's even more effective
---
Well you need to be injured for resilience to work and have the killer directly look at you and if they try to mindgame spine chill will not go off most likely. I definitely think it's good but the requirements are kinda eh.
---
Yeah I thought they removed it.
---
Do we know when the ST chapter comes to the live version ?
---
Hatch standoffs were replaced with gate standoffs except killers get an automatic win timer that starts counting down. 
---
It's an improvement if you're a killer main I guess.
---
You not seeing it is anecdotal, I see it all the time. See how that works?
---
yea OP makes it look like jake did something absolutely stupid but in reality it looks like he was trying hard to predict.. I tmay not be the best thing to do but he would have got downed eventually since he was the last survivor.
---
As he should
---
I actually had this happen to me once in a non-PTB game about a week ago.
---
It seems to be a bug that can happen when you vault a window right when you get hit. The game then put you in some kinda teleportation state where you're zooming forward like that. 
---
If you vault another window it will remove the bug.
---
You sure you‚Äôre not carrying Jane? üçë

Let's agree to disagree, my friend :)
---
All survivors are entitled? No! Survivors who bitch in the endgame chat and on reddit- yes. If you're not toxic and played relatively well, I will give you the hatch, otherwise I will ensure your slow agonizing death.

I usually leave the last person alone and take them to the exit myself.

From what I've heard I believe it's something to do with how the SFM/modelling program lets their faces use actually somewhat human facial expressions that don't make them look like cromagnon replicants. Not sure why the designers don't just take a cue from those.

15% faster vault speed. Even if it only takes 0.3 seconds off a fast vault it's still useful. It can be life saving a lot of times. Plus if there is a t wall loop next to the shack it's kind of an infinite with spine chill and resilience

Around the 17th if we follow usual patterns I think. Try and keep around 1 mill til then

Mass downvoted for the truth. Typical reddit.

This is why the game is fucked. Some people only consider a perk good when it‚Äôs o.g mettle of man tier.  They fail to see the balance problems with that because they‚Äôre plebs who don‚Äôt understand the first fucking thing about videogames.

Yeah, your right I guess. The fact that ds adrenaline and some other perks are better is something I can't deny

No, you see, you're supposed to ignore the survivor on the hook AND the last survivor you hooked, and run across the map and try to find one of the other 2 survivors.

/s
---
It's not meant to spark joy. It's meant to be a last ditch effort if you happen to be be playing one of the several killers who can't pressure gens enough to matter. At least it's a hex perk. Back when I first started, it just activated for 2 minutes and there was nothing you could so about it besides escape or die.
---
I mean. NOED perk bad, ruins the game, crutch perk, etcetera.
---
Let him see scratch marks. I mean c'mon look at spirit.

Jeff Main :)
---
This excuse doesn't work anymore. The demogorgon's mori makes the characters bloody regardless of their clothings.
---
I have been using him recently and didnt know he got nerfed after coming coming out, and tbh the fact that if someone has adrenaline and then vaults a window is almost enough for me to lose my whole ability makes him kind of useless against some survivors, but to others it becomes easy to slow down the game, but I do think the vault speeds should be higher.
---
Well that's one way to secure/guarantee a kill...

Ok...wig!

If you haven't seen anything past season 5 watch the 6th season and skip season 7 and 8, start from season 9, it has improved a lot.
---
And then the killer tunnles u the rest of the game cause your the only one who knows where ruin is
---
There is not 1 person on this sub that ever said EGC is op. And I get why you killed her because you are a killer but it doesn't really look like you were gonna let her escape (and again that's fine you are a killer but don't lie about it).
---
OH SHIT, A BILLY!
---
Do Lay's have a Salt &amp; Vinegar flavour? If so, it's thematically perfect AND delicious!
---
i have trouble with losing people so bh just helps out
---
I don't play legion but I have friends that say he's better now. But I wouldn't know, I think letting em see scratch marks is fair tho
---
Those perks are amazing, someone hire dis guy.
---
That's classified
---
Isn't that one of those rules written in the amazing and unbeliable survivor rulebook for killers?
---
Piggy is also crouching in a corner.
---
lol the wraith's face
---
I second that,and i also wish the author great success in the future.
---
Well he went from just a dick to a lovable, aloof dick. It's what commonly known in storytelling as character development.
---
Wonderful, if you want cool dbd figures do it by yourself
---
idk bout PC but on PS4 if you exit to dashboard &amp; close application you keep your addons &amp; offerings, i learned that from survivor mains
---
Btw, apparently we can't post memes here, it will get removed, even though this /r has a "meme" flair.
---
Tier list aside, his base skin is so ugly it pulls me away from even trying to play as him.
---
sounds good to me. same with blood trails
---
These are amazing. You should keep doing this you are very talented !
---
All I know for sure is it usually drops 2 weeks after ptb.
---
Where's trappers nip
---
Points you almost always get, what? Do you understand how it works at all? Rofl.
---
I always reward t-bagging with a nice camp and if I'm ghost face I give them a bit of t-bagging myself
---
Would you mind sharing it here? I'm kinda curious.
---
I never met killer who said that
---
Next chinese new year event?
---
A guy was continuously vaulting a pallet infront of an exit gate.
---
I was plague, got corrupt purge, puked on his ass when he was on my side of the pallet and then downed his ass before he could sprint out.
---
I went all hinky dunky scooby doo on his ass and Mori'd him. It was so embarrassing for him lol
---

And I was just shocking her into oblivion. I could've hit her and hook her but I just decided to run around her, whilst she 360'd and ran backwards (yeah, idk how you can pull off running backwards but she did it).
---
Any key you press makes you crouch
---
That looks freakin' amazing! Great job!
---
dbd.onteh.net.au , seems like there‚Äôs a lot more killers in lobbies than last time I counted.
---
Also has a leaderboard for every player in the game.
---
Mmmm yea trapper is such a snack here, redden my whole, daddy
---
where can i throw money at you to obtain such art?
---
ROFL, why do survivors got to try to get away from the killer? Like seriously it's not a power role, let me hit you and down you, why are survivors trying too screw me over and get away??! I don't get it! 
---
See how stupid you sound?
---
I really do see IT being the next chapter, killer only. Especially with the new movie coming out soon it would be perfect and I would be hyped af.
---
It was one patch before Freddy's rework
---
I love the spirits hair!
---
Holy shit! Great job!
---
I see the clown is embracing his inner potato.
---
i knew Nea's were bad but jesus that takes it to a whole other level, by the grace of god i 4manned on Lery's as an M1 billy &amp; still got called trash after the match. 7/10 matches on console has 1 or more DC's, either instantly as the match starts, once they findout what killer you are, or after getting downed once
---
I had this and did the verify through steam, it downloaded an update and it worked.
---
Have you tried a full reinstall?
---
*laughs in iron maiden*
---
I‚Äôll give you my soul and two outdated sleeping pills for these
---
Boby blocking is more when you block someone in a corner or trying to stop the killer from hooking. Sandbag is more when you block someone tryin to run from the killer by stopping on a pallet or window they were going to use and just blocking chase survivors in general
---
I wonder why they removed the chat after a killer-DC anyways. It used to be helpful/funny to be able to talk with everyone, including the killer itself, after a DC. Had a trapper that dc'd because he stepped into his own trap all he said was ''Now I feel your pain, survivors. I promise to be a better man next time'' and left.
---
great art, but really weird/broken abilities and perks
---
It can also smell their blood or something
---
It's pretty even but I'd say a survivor bias just slightly
---
Thank you.
---
I‚Äòm pretty much new to the game &amp; the community so I actually don‚Äòt know that. Just saw that pig has more skins &amp; she is licensed too?
---
I got a prayer beads spirit on the ptb... easiest dc of my life. Everyone else dc‚Äôed and the spirit had the nerve to ask why we dc‚Äôed.
---
Stahp
---
Long Range Huntress, just working on a gen then ***WHAM*** hatchet
---
Oh god this so many times. It's so great when it happens, proper justice boner.
---
Except it is also used by nurses and spirits to get free kills
---
Hill-fucking-Billy. Nothing in the real world scares me, but a couple of pixels moving fast as fuck terrify me lol
---
Ahhh the cowards build
---
Freddy and Plag...
---
I really started loving the Plague after playing her for a while.
---
Brooooooooo idk wtf it is with billys limp but that is like the Horror Film cliche of scary as shit.
---
Unless the license agreement was written REALLY poorly and/or there is some backwards Canadian moose law I've never heard of - I still wouldn't hold my breath. 
---
Even if everyone agreed on everything and all aspects of the rework were complete - I can't see how they will get around needing explicit consent from the organization holding the license and copyright for NoES. If they don't, that organization MUST sue BHVR to hold their claim.
---
‚ÄúFuck loopers‚Äù
---
Goddamn survivors trying to survive so toxic wtf
---
Yes
---
I actually dont mind her. Shes nice.
---
Juicy story incoming.
---
So right, I never play killer, I‚Äôm a survivor main. So much so that I only ever play my lvl 1 Billy when I do (i refuse to level his or any killers BW because of how little i play killer).
---
Anyway, my buddy was playing a killer game yesterday so to pass the time, I did the same. Got paired with the following: Dwight, 2 Claudettes and a Feng. Gen rushed and tbagged like I had never see before. So being the toxic prick that I also happen to be, I chainsaw facecamped Claudette #1 til every gen was done. Claudette #1 is almost sacrificed when Claudette #2 comes in for the save. Heres the best part: I chainsaw Claudette #2 while she‚Äôs unhooking Claudette #1, insta downing her, and then the Dwight (the most toxic of them all, tbagged at every safe pallet) went for the unhook, where I grabbed him and hooked him not too far away. While this was all going on, Feng was opening the door. On my way back to pick up Claudette #2, I found the cheeky Feng reviving her, which I chainsawed and hooked. When I went back to pick up Claudette 2, I decided I would bring her to the hatch if she didn‚Äôt struggle. Surprise surprise, she struggles for her life and I hook her instantaneously. It was a sweet and sweaty victory. 
---
Moral of the story: don‚Äôt be a toxic prick, and if you‚Äôre going to, make sure you don‚Äôt f it up.
---
I'm disappointed at the lack of we'll make it.
---
Also, BT needs to be tweaked it won't activate with no heartbeat campers.
---
wow...the mindgames... absolutely impressive
---
Like it is already in high ranks? Ok, not a big change. the difference is now even rank 20s who cry about noed will cleanse totems
---
Username checks out tho.
---
My dudes. Here we have a 20+ something male with no achievements in life and nothing to be proud of. That's why he puts way too many emotions into a video game. Don't be like that guy.
---
ive met plenty of survivors that call me trash after the match even when i 3K doing daily's for killers i usually dont play
---
Killer
---
Unfortunately I now have to point out that "spelt" is the incorrect word here. Spelt is a type of grain. The word you were looking for is "spelled". Sorry :(
---
They're both second chance end game perks that also grant a speed boost,  how is it a pathetic comparison?
---
I had this same problem lol
---
Perfect!
---
BT should be based on killer proximity not terror radius. It‚Äôs infuriating to watch a wraith stand right next to me and wait for the unhook so they can tunnel me down again.

Nah this is a rare outfit. I have seen someone wear it during Halloween. It was so awesome. I want to see this in the game. It would go so hard.

I had to slug the survivors quite a bit after they got the gates powered, and I was able to hook the last survivor thanks to blood warden
---
I can barely read it cause the text color are just black on black or red on red.
---
Killers: *Scream at Survivors for gen rushing due to the fact that they were camping*
---
Survivors: I‚Äôll fuckin‚Äô do it again
---
It‚Äôs the same in reverse as well, I remember a killer started yelling at me because I teabagged him after he tunneled my teammate and just camped all game. You just can‚Äôt win with some people
---
To be fair, she is in like one Episode anyways ^^
---
shut up you stupid killer main
---
all you do is complain
---
I mean agree with you. Im just telling how it feels. Fealings dont always translate to reality. But the idiotic 12 yo that play this game dont get how to control themselves and so they act out. Plus you have no idea how tiring it can get to get camped trial after trial, so even when there is a sitch where camping is "fair" they just blow because its too much.
---
players are still complaining about totems' placements?
---
Tbf, pretty much anything Stephen King is perfect for this game.
---
Mr. Gaunt can spawn chests in the game that grant special rare and above items that are actually brown, and his active power can be that he reveals anyone who has an item/ anyone who used a chest gets a new status called Cry Havoc that allows them to attacck other survivors.
---
It ...well there's a video already that perfectly explains how he could be used.
---
Hell, you can even make the fucking hotel from the Shining a killer by having the host killer for a few seconds (like 20) take over a survivor and give them a random weapon, otherwise, you're just a ...thing, that floats invisible through the map , creating traps that allow you to infect survivors with ....whatever.  (haven't actually read the Shining, I'm sorry)
---
lol, i always thought that in the icon David was about to kick a ball
---
no it is a glitch
---
It will almost certainly be the 17th. They don't release updates on Fridays.
---
I can see why people would want to use their rare stuff without actually spending it, but yeah, I  found it strange that people were trying so hard in ptb. Nothing like spawning on the new map and not having the time to check it out properly, because you're busy dying to a red rank nurse with an ebony mori. :'(
---
I don't exactly know how does it work too, but i think the licensed characters can't have cosmetics unless the owner of the character gives permission, and it costs kinda a lot of money. Ghostface is different, cuz in dbd it's not the 'real' ghostface from films, devs just bought his mask, so they can do whatever they want with it. I don't know about the new killer, but cosmetics for pig was something everyone was waiting for, for a loooong time. And eventually it came out, so they probably managed to buy the permission. That's also why you can't buy these cosmetics with shards. Please correct me if i'm wrong, cuz this might be complete bullshit :v
---
Even worse when they are there, not even willing to unhook you (even in the second phase) but as soon as the other Person is on the hook, everyone is there and you die.
---
Power 1: Can put The Donkey down on the map or pick him up. The Donkey moves around but doesn't attack and emits a Terror Radius. While this power is used The Shreks terror radius is removed until he attacks. 
---
Power 2: Can hide in lockers and bash out. The bash injures and applies the exhausted status effect. The bash has a distinct musical sound effect which tells other survivors who are nearby that one of them just got served a swift dealing of swamp justice.
---
*Nea tries to enter a locker while hearing The Donkeys terror radius closing in

Had a game the other day with three Blendettes who kept cleansing... Sometimes without being out of T1 of the disease.
---
ahhhh. ok I knew that I would encounter one of you. so listen up, if you encounter a survivor with more than 5 brain cells which I guess from your description is all you play against, they can run you around for so long its not even funny. I don't want him to be top teir. I want him to be in the middle. I want him to be as fun as he was on release, I want him to not be a slightly above average m1 killer, id like him to be able to give survivors a run for their money. and what do you mean "damm near impossible to lose as him" the legion has at least a 30 or so percent chance to win any game, all legion games play out like this. he finds somebody, stabs them with frenzy, and then runs off to find another person to stab in the bum. he then gets looped and pallet stunned and blinded until he manages to down somebody and then they get saved and the process being anew until he either gets a brutal killer match or pips once. once again. he is fine how he is but he could be better and exciting, im after that possibility that he can be fun to play as and against.
---
I'll be honest, I was waiting for someone to get it, and then was even questioning it, It kinda is obvious for People who watch the Show.

Well the name survivors is an indication that someone is trying to live, while killer is someone trying to take a life. So I don't see how surviving is a power role whereas killer want a power role of having control of someone's fictional life in their hands. See how stupid you sound?

I've been wanting a killer that has a patrolling crow or something so I like the idea of Donkey moving around
---
I got the game two weeks ago, Ive played from ranked 20 all the way to rank 3 survivor. On the killer side Ive made it to rank 4. 
---
I honestly believe a couple things should be changed. Im not even talking about perks but the way the game works. 
---
IE my first change would be the dying recovery mechanic. I cannot tell you how many times it comes down to the last two survivors, the 2nd is downed and they crawl around and hide from the killer because hes pushing the 1st survivor. ( hes attemping to deny the chance to escape through the hatch) this is almost everyones go too. To fix this I believe survivors need to be able to fully recover themselves. 
---
If the killer is that neglible itll be his own fault that someone escapes. but because of the way the game is setup the only team that gets punished is the survivors, there also no mechanic that punishes the killer for making a mistake
---
Yeah someone with what looks like a yellow apron.

With blood on it. Maybe it is supposed to be leather face idk

Camping means you are letting three people go. You absolutely do not need to camp even if all the gens are done.
---
Im gonna have to snag that wraith if you ever add him to the ebay page
---
Dbd is a very different game depending on what rank you are at and how skilled the players in the match are.
---
Very experienced players who are skilled at looping will argue that both self-care and urban evasion are bad, and at ranks 1-3 they are correct, you give the killer way too much extra time to find survivors and kill/hook them and invite a lot of unnecessary pressure if you are spending all that time to self-heal and urban evading everywhere rather than just running to a gen and working on it immediately.  
---
At lower ranks the play is miles from optimal, and every second doesn't count as much as it does at rank 1, and thus self-care and urban are fine to use. Also unskilled players get downed much more quickly so generally hiding more and healing up will be more worthwhile and a good idea.
---
* Screenshots highlighting common UI bugs and/or glitches, e.g. bugged Devotion EXP gain, massive amount of negative bloodpoints, not being able to escape, ... .

Rarely happens to me on console tbh. If it does happen they normally take a protective hit for me, like I normally do for them

---
I have 16 GB of ram and live runs perfectly fine. You're saying i need to purchase double the amount of ram just for one game?
---
I've had way too many games where the killer is in red ranks, im in red ranks then we have like 1-2 green/yellow ranks. It's so frustrating because we don't win but the only funny moment I got out of it, was the new Meg player was stuck in the house thing in the swamp and she didn't know how to get out and ran in circles.
---
they will go anyways even if I dont camp, gens are done and all the doors are open. you basically tell me let 1 kill away for nothing lol. Also you are saying that I only have 1 kill by the time all gens are done and I'm camping. This is rarely happens. I get at least 2 kills 9 out of 10 matches
---
Bruh prayer beads arent even that serious. Usually spirits use their ability while you are in their terror radius, completely wasting the prayer beads because you cant hear phasing in the terror radius. Most don't look away from their target like a gen and cause I run spine chill it's easy to dip. Also I've been noticingalot of people saying "easy dc". I never dc on principle and usually the people running that shit are doo doo.of all the iri heads I've been against, I've escaped probably 75 percent of the time. Same with prayer beads. Last night I ran a spirit around who had prayer beads for 2 gens. I'm at rank 6 so.
---
Why those perks lol.
---
It doesn't get used, sometimes it's indeed possible to just heal normally and that works fine
---
Also, nice topical username
---
Hag. Cause at the beginning you dont know who it is and that jumpscare with her traps happen.

Being camped or watching a teammate get camped feels bad and makes them frustrated. That‚Äôs why.
---
WHA-

---
And DEVOUR IT
---
No one KNOWS, but we can make educated guesses. 
---
Usually 2 weeks after PTB start, and usually on a tuesday, so 17th would indeed make sense. Friday the 13th for the horror theme might be possible too but is unlikely
---
Frank‚Äôs the OG
---
Its 17th
---
Can't be later because the next Tuesday wouldn't be summer. Servers are due in Summer and the ST update is when they're added.
---
"You know we had to do it to those survivors"
---
What about Juile?
---
Just quit playing the entire game. thats what I did and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. They have kingdom come on game pass now and it shits on dbd even being single player. If a game depends on its player base playing nicely and not harassing eachother and taking advantage of the games weaknesses you know its gonna be garbage cause people cant handle that.
---
Is it wrong that I want to be intimate with both? ü§î
---
What ever button you use to hit skillchecks
---
Camping is completely valid imo. Especially if all the gens are going. The survivors have 2 avenues of escape and you can only cover one, so why not stay in a spot you know they'll be forced to return to?
---
Garbage survivors will complain and good survivors will team up to distract you and help their team out. 
---
This ESPECIALLY makes sense for new killers that don't have an entire load out of perks to level the playing field. 
---
Does it feel bad to get camped? Sure, but you're 1 being used as bait to lure more survivors in. And 2  the killer owes the survivors NOTHING. It's their job to kill by any means necessary.
---
I had this happen too, but just on the PTB when playing with a friend. didn't happen when I was solo though.
---
Removed - Uncivil
---
was unable to play so i had to leave the game :(
---
It's not at all. And anyone downvoting this purely logical statement are salty scrubs.

And that's coming from a new-ish survivor main who has been not only camped, but also rescued from being camping multiple times by the skill of my teammates.

---
Trapper is the original DBD daddy.
---
It depends. Is the killer right nearby?
---
Will this be the update that allows us not to keep inviting friends after every match. I don‚Äôt know how to say this much better. Will this be the update that ends us having to re-invite friends after every match?
---
And the best part is it‚Äôs a full commitment to one strat or the other, but the real fun starts when someone doesn‚Äôt follow. Like when the sfw choose to not cleanse and the random does. That‚Äôs 3 people who are going to be very easy to down because they aren‚Äôt all on the same page.
---
for perks i suggest spark of madness, since lithe and overcharge are pretty decent perks. monitor or abuse is good on certain killers too (cough micheal cough)
---
Like I always run spine chill so that saves me a lot but her head traps are anxiety inducing
---
But no seriously its prayer beads spirit. Ive been playing for years and nothing really scares me but once i got the prayer beads experience and got yoinked off a gen, that really jumpscared me
---
Nicely done
---
Because of the Peer To Peer trash connection! 
---
Dedicated servers will fix that! 
---
Also devs should have put a cap on Ping times as being able to play killer! 
---
So you get assholes with trash internet and they know it and don‚Äôt care and use it to their advantage because they are trash killers! 
---
So when dedicated servers finally roll out these scrubs will be left in the 18-20 ranks and finally realize that they suck at the game and can‚Äôt get kills anymore because they were using their trash laggy McDonald‚Äôs internet as a crutch!

ye, thats every online PVP Game ever

100% nothing wrong with your play style. I'd say your good if the killer never sees you all game

Cujo would be dope since we dont have any killer animals and he is the #2 (The shark from Jaws cant be used, unless he gets a water tank with wheels)
---
Same.
---
I'm upsetti because I have been waiting all year for bl3 and it comes out on the 13th so I probably won't play the new chapter till everyone stops playing Demogorgon.
---
Camping the last hook is perfectly fine if all the gens are done. Especially if you are running NOED or have an insta down killer. The only other time it is acceptable to camp is when you plop a survivor on the hook and see the other 3 survivors right behind the hook (it happens a lot). Otherwise, plop the survivor on the hook, do a quick sweep of the area and then go search gens
---
[Here! ](http://kawarayane.tumblr.com)
---
2nd chance perks aren't really much to complain about, but 3 insta heals and those ranks? fuck that.
---
if you are planning to slug use deerstalker, if you see a lot of flashlights in the lobby use overwhelming presence, noed and surge to KIND of counter gen rushing. whisperers is also a very good perk, but i dont suggest using it at tier 1 or 2.
---
So, let me dissect the important parts of this then. Lots of fluff. Devs didn't test fully. Needed to gather a bunch of materials, put them into a rare container. Combine the container and items. Then give it to a husk.
---
Devs testing the boss skipped that to summon the boss. You argue that they weren't "going to spend thirty hours acquiring that container normally" when all they had to do was spawn the item, as you stated they did for the finished item. Meaning not a single dev decided to make sure their item combine code was working for the container.
---
So. Let me start relating this back to DbD. They give us a shitload of BP for the PTB. You argue this could accidentally leak into the live build, or not include bloodpoint gains after matches. Now, of those two issues, they've already shown they have a separate file used for PTB progression and should be clearly marked, so that shouldn't be an issue. Now, I don't get what you mean by "removing that grant" considering PTB progression doesn't carry over to live last time I got involved with one. I could be wrong if you stay in the PTB until you're forced back to live, but they already have a PTB file as mentioned before. That said, if that somehow DOES cause a bug where you don't gain more BP it could be an issue. Yet, if they decided to push a ton of BP for all PTB players to fully test perks, buying them, bloodweb changes, and all that... they should have already done QA to ensure that you still gain bloodpoints.
---
Now, you're right that they should mimic live conditions. Yet, we're here to play test the game in live conditions and with minimal bloodpoints it makes testing the game that much more difficult. We're the people testing for that combine button. If it's known all the components and containers drop perfectly fine, then for testers, give them the components and container and have them test from there. From there, it's testing the combine button (bloodweb changes, perk purchasing), and the lich (Demogorgon, gameplay) in one strike.
---
aww you dont like instaheals? well that's too bad a killer has never listened to "survivor rules" so why would survivors do it for killers?
---
Id say Darkness Among us for Fun and some really good perks like Discordance
---
This looks like it could‚Äôve come from Kimetsu no Yaiba at first glance
---
Maybe I'm still new to the game, but I still get excited playing survivor. I love getting into a chase and losing the killer. My heart still pumps whenever I'm opening the exit gates and hear a heartbeat. I think I'd probably even like the game more without perks. That way you really have to use your environment to escape the killer.
---
Me as freedy with pop and overcharge ready
---
That's objectively false.  Go to /r/DestinyTheGame for example.
---
oh and ninja skin for claudete it wpuld be black or navy blue jakes would be pure green
---
Killer rulebook section #865: any kind of healing is not to be done. And if you use an instaheal, you are to walk to the nearest hook and stand in front of it while the killer downs you.
---
Wow. Thanks for the story, that‚Äôs actually quite interesting!
---
Id say spark of madness because the doctor is pretty cool and has some interesting stuff that no other killer has and feng is also very cute
---
You have to fail a skillcheck
---
I'll take your entire stock
---
Thanks for the reminder
---
That would honestly be really cool. The flashlights would have to last way longer though. Maybe if you stayed in the darkness too long without using your flashlight something would happen?
---
Where to buy???
---
i wonder what the "Thing" is
---
The stranger things ptb is out but the offical release on steam is in a few weeks
---
Okay jeez it was just a joke calm down...
---
Only browse that subreddit if you hate this one so bad.
---
You want me to make some good ones? Bc I'm tired of the bad ones too
---
‚ÄúThere is nothing risky about running around for 80-160 seconds being injured‚Äù
---
Yeah you‚Äôre obviously just a biased killer main, even looking into your profile all you do is complain about survivors lol. You‚Äôre not here to offer any valid discussion
---
Me at 3 am
---
So I'll get spark, thanks
---
those arent even a good hiding spot
---
 Congratulations that was quick ! =D
---
You good right there if you in rank 15-20 lol
---
It seems like anytime i try to run a killer around my teammates think its a group effort so I stick to stealthing and focusing on gens now too
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d1bclc/send_me_some_memes/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
This post deserves more updoots this is fucking amazing
---
No one is answering the question. Why so defensive?
---
Feng doesn't wear cowboy boots? Or are you missing the joke
---
Looks like you were farming all of your teammates off hook.
---
I like peppermint twist, a good perk that can really help with loops, but can also be countered by high rank survivors. Nice job
---
F
---
As long as you are always doing something, you're fine. I would suggest running the killer around late game if he has gotten hooks(You don't what your teamates dying). And Deliverance will work amazing in this new style.
---
Honestly dont understand the hate against pop, first complain about every killer running ruin, then they make pop actually viable and now they are sad that their gen gets regressed by 25%
---
I mean, I‚Äôm not wrong I see no flair so why would anyone expect you to want a discussion. 
---
Guess I‚Äôm brighter than someone crying about a few shitty memes on reddit.
---
Is there a problem? They can use whatever they want in order to complete their objective. If they use "2nd chance perks" as you like to call it maybe use something similar. To me it just seems like you're salty you lost.
---
I made it on my IPHONE 8 on adobe photoshop, Don‚Äôt bully me üò¢ü•∫
---
Who‚Äôs morris?
---
My tip is, if they try and do a 50 50 mindgame, just turn around and run awau
---
PGTW is a reward for good gameplay. 
---
I've actually never seen a Survivior bitch about it. It's a great perk but it's not like it's bullshit like NOED
---
You mean those totems most people don't do? To be fair, the new Badham maps and Hawkins lab have much better totem spots. Hopefully the older maps get updated too.
---
How do you know he is toxic, kid?
---
Week or two after reset I had my survivor and killer both at rank 10.
---
As survivor I was constantly getting put with people from ranks 12-20 on my team.
---
As killer I was going against people often in red ranks or purple ranks.
---
It wouldnt be as bad the ranks being fucked up if the game was fucking consistent and gave me the same quality of teammates as the people I play against.
---
Are these new kille....ohhhhh!
---
Wow, these look great! I hope you are considering making a Pig figure.
---
Literally the only thing i post about on this sub is how the Trapper is fucking hot. I want his to sit on my face.
---
Pretty sure you can click somewhere and not see "shit posts". And I have to agree, a lot of the memes are not that fun. But personally I would rather take a shitty meme than a bad player ranting about something being "OP".
---
To be fair it could be because matchmaking is so horrible and people are playing with their new friends to the game who are rank 17 whereas the vets are red ranks playing with them. I am a rank 13 killer who plays occasionally for daily challenges or trophies. And I matched lately put three red ranks and one 18 rank. And I quit because they were making it very apparent the difference in experience/ranks and were generally being toxic.
---
How am I toxic?
---
this is the best dbd cosplay I've seen!!!! I love this!!!!
---
Not sure how it is on console, but on PC you can see the ping of the killer. There are also programs which can more accurate calculate the ping. So if you get bad ping in the lobby just leave and re-queue.
---
What if for the first perk everytime a generator skill check is missed his terror radius reduces to 0 for 30/45/60. This entices survivors not to fail but allows the killer to benefit by having 0 terror radius and sneak up on people
---
Jesus I laughed too much now My insides hurt
---
Why did you feel the need to message them lmao
---
no fun for racists in my games sorry
---
The PTB sounds pretty buggy. I hope you found a match soon after.
---
Yeah I can understand that. 
---
The game I just had though the killer was rank 1 and just disconnects after two generations are done.
---
David*
---
I had a killer face camp me the other day after bodyblocking me on a gen and message me to tell me I was trash (even though at that point I couldn't have done anything anyways). I hadn't messaged him, none of my friends had, and he called me trash.
---
While he was camping, 3 gens got done, another mere seconds after I died, and everyone else escaped.
---
It's one of the only times I've really gone off, but I told him he was a dick and should learn how to play without needing shitty crutch gameplay.
---
Lemme tell you- I got him in a game I played last night where I was the killer. Didn't face camp because it's easy to get a 4k without doing so, but boy did I mori the ever loving shit out of him
---
And then that nea you spent chasing all game for runs off into the distance
---
I support u
---
Well some players (myself included) play the game very competitively. And for mew at least I don't care if the survivors have fun, I am trying to win. I don't DC as killer or survivor. But I can understand why some people do, specially when things don't work as intended, kinda sucks the fun out of the game. But DC:ing cause of "gen rush" is kind a weak excuse, and there are things killers can do to prevent it or counter it.
---
Oh yeah that‚Äôs different.
---
firecrackers are so hard to blind with, he probably dc'd out of pure shame
---
As you can see I genuinely wanted to know why he disconnected and if it was intentional or not bc to me it seemed so random? Like he hooked someone and then d/ced
---
Lmao I mean the photo came out great so it all worked out!
---
Yet somehow Quinton still looks more of a killer than Freddy
---
Read the community info
---
Tunneling- chasing a certain survivor for an extended period of time. 
---
Tunneling is GOOD when you can make time for it. If you know there‚Äôs 2 survs left and you‚Äôre tunneling 1, that‚Äôs good 
---
Tuennling is BAD when you can‚Äôt spare time for it and you‚Äôre doing it because you have a big ego/ are mad at the survivor for looping you for a long time. If you‚Äôre tunneling a guy down and all 5 gens get done, you‚Äôve ragetunneled  him (or maybe you just didn‚Äôt know) all game. That‚Äôs not good. You‚Äôre trying to kill all survivors, so sometimes tunneling is not the method. You have to understand when the break chase. 
---
Some games I go against survivors where one guy is doing well on his loops, so I take a pallet or M1 then leave him, immediately rotate and chainsaw snipe one of his bad teammates. This forces him instead to be altruistic, getting people of gens and giving me more power during the game
---
I‚Äôve seen theeeeeeeeeemmmmmmmmmmmm and I‚Äôm using it
---
Stupid GENRUSHER. Trying to do the objective smh. Lmao get good kid ez dc noob survivor lol get rekt rofl
---
Legend
---
I didn't, like I haven't met many killers who disconnect so I was curious
---
Big problem with this is two killers could easily corner one person so there'd be no real chase.
---
I am not a native english speaker and I have a question: Why is so damn hard for english speakers to differ between "your" and "you're"?
---
pro gamer
---
yeah thats what its supposed to be
---
I don't understand the plag
---
Oh man, I had a match where 20 seconds into the game I had accidentally thrown down the shack pallet because it was very close to a totem I wanted to cleanse.  You know, the embarrassment itself I thought would be punishment enough but when I flicked my camera back to see if anyone noticed this Dwight was standing there. Menacingly. He let me struggle on the hook longer than I needed it. Haha. (We laughed about it after the match.)
---
I'm sick of face campers
---
what about shirtless trapper
---
Everyone in the legion gang is 18 or 19 according to wiki
---
I think I'll get spark,fun seems better
---
oh thanks
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be happy to know that there is a salt and vinegar flavor. You can almost taste the survivors‚Äô salt.
---
It‚Äôs honestly so sick that you can literally be chased for 5 gens and escape and then derank
---
could also be a doctor
---
SUUUUURRRRGGGEEEEEE
---
I had a group rage at me because I wouldn't lunge
---
"Why even be on the ptb if you aren't going to test the killer"
---
Out of the hundred or so lunges I've attempted and entire matches where I've said "I'm gonna throw this match just to practice lunges" I've probably only hit about 5-10
---
Why the hell is it impossible to hit yet everyone else can land it first try, I'll never know.
---
No lol
---
Thanks!
---
because a lot of english speakers are american
---
frank looks good? what‚Äôre you on about son
---
You cant be banned for using a perk unless it is bugged and you are purposely using the bug as an exploit. They probably just got really upset and wanted to make sure you didn't want to use that perk again.
---
Toxic twats
---
it was like 3 of the people in the lobby thoughj
---
That‚Äôs very groovy of you
---
Playing devil's advocate here, but you've called 75% of the posts her "terrible", told people they're "defensive and mad" because they downvote you, insinuated someone is the dumbest in their class, called someone's response stupid, condescended anyone who enjoyed the memes, assumed that the majority of the people here are immature/ 14 years old.... Dude that's a lot of negativity. I'd much rather have the forum flooded with low quality memes than a "discussion" with someone that rude.
---
You'll be fine.
---
If you use insidious on huntress her lullaby is still 46 or 48 meters (forgot the range)
---
Oof, I'm a little guilty of this.
---
COVFEFE
---
They tried that and it was a shitshow. They can't fix her hatchets until they fix survivor's hitboxes (their limbs don't have collision).
---
But it would make sense, though? Hag and Trapper aren't supposed to chase early on.
---
12 Plauge shotgun
---
Their
---
&gt;you have a 2 foot squared hit box around a head... thats not common in video games and shows laziness from the developers. thats not latency thats bad form
---
This only shows how misinformed you are. The hitboxes you see on cheat videos have nothing to do with the actual in-game hitbox. DBD hitboxes are *cylinders* around the survivors body, which you can even see on that same video you posted multiple times. 
---
Again, sharing this video and claiming it is showing something regarding hitboxes only helps spreading misinformation. Most of the hits shown in that video are latency related.
---
Ok I see that it looks like I was pretending to phase but in the moment I was actually just waiting for him to throw down the pallet
---
Well yes but actually no. Hag is one of the best killer if you master her but she is very hard to learn. Hag is definitelly better than demo but demo is way easier to play.
---
Hate to be "that guy", but 'their'.
---
I think the feed on fear perk is a little weak. It would encourage survivors to focus on objectives more which you wouldn‚Äôt want as a killer. And being out of chase and not touching a gen for 2 minutes is almost never going to happen. Maybe make it around 45 second or a minute instead imo
---
Are they fixing dedicated servers? Cause as far as i know they're pretty bad rn.
---
The art team is amazing at BHRV. I feel like they're the best branch there. It would take a little longer to make a variant of an outfit but its it's nothing they haven't added blood on before
---
I think I'll try that,also I'll try being a friendly killer so we get tons of points,win win
---
Sounds like she was just a filler lol
---
Indeed
---
That's what I hope! It might just be an issue of if they have the time/they're focusing on other departments and things first. Fingers crossed, though! It'd be a good opportunity to bring in even more money for sure.
---
Same actually
---
Hmm, I've heard that huntress true age is below 17...hope that FBI won't find me
---
Ouch
---
Can someone explain to me the beans meme?
---
The doctor is the only killer, that makes me jump, due to his jump scares when shocking you. Other then that I fear Claudette‚Äôs, when they run at me out of nowhere.
---
Given what sub this is being posted on I'm pretty sure we know the answer
---
Same bro. Friday can't come sooner
---
The same can be said can for other aide xo.paning aboit adrenaline and exhaustion perks
---
10/10 title, lol! Good stuff though. :D
---
Interesting fact, Xbox will have Steam soon enough apparently.
---
Borderlands doesn't like pictures :( 
---
But I also know that at least one of my friends will be on for dbd, whereas idk if any of my buddies are getting B3 :/
---
TOTH is only good for Russian Roulette Spirit
---
this brighten up my day... thank you
---
As long as you weren‚Äôt cheating. Disregard report threats
---
Its perfect
---
im not exaggerating when i say i probably see it at least once every day lmfao
---
No I'm playing gf I'm on console and nurse is trash on console
---
There is nothing to explain with it. Just embrace the ***b e a n s***
---
"squared" 2¬≤ (quikmafs) i was using as a reference i didnt mean it was exactly a square especially since it would take a fucking rectangle to fit an entire human in (see caskets) even cylindrical would still be the "literal box" i was referring to. most games hit boxes are formed to the body and not overlapping more than a cunthair but i mean if you base the hitboxes off Minecraft then i guess thats the way to do it
---
I thought borderlands was coming out in april?  ^/^s
---
But Im gonna put the BP in her for thantophobia
---
This is something I always thought of. After getting hooked, the killer is in perfect kicking distance considering that the survivor curls their knees into their torso. It wouldn't be hard to just hoof them in the damn face or at least boot them in the chest to get away from you. 
---
Maybe it could be something like decisive strike, where it has to be specifically timed and either gives you extra blood points or does a temporary stun (like a pallet) after you've been hooked just...for a 'screw you' kind of thing I guess? They'd need to add something akin to this for the killer though for flavor.
---
The Office DLC confirmed.
---
You can tunnel, camp, use noed, even cheat, but once you break a pallet, I‚Äôm reporting you
---
https://youtu.be/szNuLvKltSk
---
wait i- to be FAIR....the killer did actually have franklin's so it was only like half a lie
---
They have better totem spots, as they aren‚Äôt visible from the other side of the map, but the rules are the same. Once you learn how to recognize the type of each random structure, the search becomes exactly the same as it is on the rest of the maps.
---
The issue is then everyone would play whichever survivor had the best ability, so the siverseness
---
im a rank 1 surv and the only killer that scares me is billy, every high rank billy is incredibly good to the point where my team never survives
---
That‚Äôs over exaggerated honestly. I played my nurse from 1-50 with no problem on console. It was tricky at first learning to play her but really wasn‚Äôt bad by the time I hit level like 20.
---
I totally agree, we need this! I was unhooked when the killer was right on top of my "rescuer" (who didn't have bt), but I had plenty of struggle time. Needless to say, I was unhooked, slashed, and hooked for my 3rd time.
---
You can make more friends
---
A good thing to keep in mind is that if a survivor is bodyblocking a hook, immediately start swinging, don‚Äôt try to wiggle around and find the hook prompt. It‚Äôs more effective and even if they get off, they now have to heal
---
I would take it over having a third or less of the population being the major players in politics. 
---
Also Brazil has had shit government going back to it's dictatorships and pseudo dictatorships and it sadly has never rebounded from those times similar to parts of Africa. What we do know is that having more voting in most democracies is a benefit and not a curse ala France, EU, UK, Canada, Germany, Sweden etc etc. The issue arrises when people vote without understanding ala Brexit more than the "Wrong" people voting.
---
Yes, but usually you'll still hear their terror radius anyway
---
Good bye chaser emblem and all chase related points.
---
They should have hook camping drain blood points and have insidious need to be x meters away from the hook.
---
Not at all. My logic only touches overpowered, "nurse hasn't been buffed" doesn't apply
---
knocking down a survivor and leaving them there to bleed out
---
I would like to play her but I can't i just had a game with her just now and got rekt I hit one guy and spent the rest of the time chasing him
---
It's as easy as other games. Tea bag the killer as you would an enemy spartan
---
If you‚Äôre doing gens then it‚Äôs fine. The worthless people are the ones using Urban Evasion around the map doing nothing.
---
downing a survivor and leaving them instead of hooking them
---
Yup its in the beginning of Halloween resurrection
---
I didnt really ask for your fucking opinion, so feel free to fuck off
---
Sequel to H20
---
Why do i like this and also why does she look Kristen Stewart
---
What?!
---
when the killer finally gets you after 4 gens then you deliverance in his face, hop into a locker, ds him, head on him, get andrenaline and run 5 feet to open the hatch with a key
---
What rank were they?
---
What rank were you at?
---
Looks cool, do you have a smaller picture?
---
Then you need more practice. She‚Äôs more complex than the other killers. Use 3 blink addons, they‚Äôll help a lot.
---
I‚Äôll take those over complaining posts
---
No?
---
Its not nearly as difficult on Xbox. Just click on their name and send message.
---
Exactly. The fucked up thing is the guy doing a minor inconvenience in a video game cuz someone has a racist username, and not the person with a racist username. Speak volumes about you.
---
Hello
---
as rank 15 killer everyone cleanses lol
---
as sad as it seems id say brown ranks have better players willing to do shit than say green ranks. im green rank now and my team mates fail to get a damn thing done. ive not made it into purple or red yet but i wanna say they probably get better so low rank/high rank probably better off, mid rank not so good at playing the game
---
lmao teabagging and flashlighting doesn't do anything to help the survivor unless you let it tilt you and survivors cant really stop killers playing the game in the same way killers can bodyblock, facecamp and tunnel. I play both roles before you try to pop off at me and honestly the only time people can really be toxic in this game is the post game chat
---
Honestly? I was playing with 18s which I know I‚Äôll probably get some ‚Äúwell there you go‚Äù comments..
---
But I‚Äôve played with some good 20‚Äôs on PC so I really don‚Äôt have the patience for that.
---
But how do you balance that with the cowards hiding on top of hatch waiting for their last teammate to die on hook? The unfortunate truth of team-based games is that you need your team to not suck. I'm not saying good players don't deserve rewards if they can't keep a bad team alive, I'm just saying it's better to encourage everyone to improve than to hand out bailouts.
---
The RNG also swings both ways. Maybe the hatch is directly by the Killer and the gates are close together, maybe it's right next to you and the gates are a mile apart incase that doesn't work out. I'm not about to defend DbD's core game design.
---
Lol. Blow me
---
I wasn't calling her bad, just that her mechanics are bad. You literally have to play the whole match injured because she gains access to an OP power if you cleanse. It's just really dumb.
---
Plow- geh
---
The killer is cancellation
---
Thank godddddd im not alone. When its Billy i assume the only way out is the hatch. Knowing that my team wont last so i just let them all die if they don't play smart.
---
1. There is no voice at all. You can only Chat before you enter a match and after the match, never during.
---
2. It's way more fun playing survivors with friends but you will still have a blast playing both survivor and killer.
---
They were self caring through mangled :/
---
a good trapper is scary, you dont know where to run there are traps every where
---
Demodaddys gonna slurp some beans
---
Okay, we can forget the ‚Äòpassive‚Äô part now.
---
They could probably have an icon appear when a survivor nearby has borrowed time to prevent confusion. The kick could also probably send the survivors backwards so they are not entirely screwed by the incoming killer.
---
They could probably add a very very very small skill check during the hook animation to kick the killer causing them to not properly hook the survivor and have the hook timer be delayed for 5-15 seconds.
---
I read what you said. The downside and potential for trolling of having such a feature is just way bigger than the benefits the game would get from it. People denying unhooks to randoms because they want their SWF buddy to unhook them. People denying unhooks because they hear a heartbeat even though the killer is busy with someone else. People denying unhook just for the sake of dying it. 
---
Also, as a DS user, often times I don't mind being farmed over reaching struggle phase because in the end, I stand a better chance of reaching endgame even if the killer downs me immediately after the unhook.
---
Some times you farm a teammate but expect to take their place on the hook, which is also a decent play considering your teammate goes free and you are fresh on hook. 
---
All of these scenarios without considering a possible BT save that even with the feature you suggested, there is a high chance that people will forget which survivor had BT on their build. 
---
Farming or being farmed isn't always a bad thing.
---
1- No, you can't talk to other survivors during the trial.
---
2- Yes, it also give you an advantage
---
3- Claudette and Meg are good for beginners. Claudette has a perk to heal herself when injured and Meg has Sprint Burst and Adrenaline. SB makes you go faster for 3 seconds, and Adrenaline gives you one health state when all gens are completed.
---
the amount of times it‚Äôs actually been the trapper when there‚Äôs no terror radius for a while when I‚Äôve played is quite high. Poor meme wouldn‚Äôt recommend
---
Oh damn I got confused, the term slow vaulting to me means when they hard vault during a chase but come at it from the wrong angle. So the ‚Äúslow vault‚Äù I didn‚Äôt realize OP meant the stealth vault. That‚Äôs much better
---
Just get Jack Torrance for Shining (Huntress will have to share her ax) and let him trap vault spots with the spirit that let him out of that cellar. Taking a trapped vault makes players have visions of chaotic things, which conceal the actual map.
---
How's Cujo going to hook? Just scare the Survivors into a car where they slowly succumb to nighttime Heat Stroke?
---
How is middle school anyway?

---
You can tell I don't participate here and with people like you, who cares
---
Probably more Stranger Things Cosmetics
---
Having a racist username or thinking it‚Äôs ok to have one does speak volumes about you, that‚Äôs true.
---
Especially in borderlands.
---
Might want to re-read what I said. Reading is hard.
---
-Giant rank numbers next to everyone's name and centering results screen around pips.
---
-Convincing people that escaping or killing isn't the main point of the game.
---
Pick one.
---
Stating that playing with your friends doesn't give you an advantage in the game ? Please, I'll all ears as to why not.
---
I said search by new, learn to read. 
---
Of course memes are going to be in hot, are you ok my dude?
---
I run Thanatophobia, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Bamboozle. It encourages survivors to cleanse and helps with ending chases super quickly. Make sure you fully infect the first survivor before downing them so they spread the sickness to the unhooker. Once it spreads, Thana kicks in more and more, it‚Äôs awesome.
---
Breaking pallets part is hilarious but if you‚Äôre slashing people on hook then that‚Äôs what‚Äôs toxic lol idk why we‚Äôre glazing over that sentiment
---
He is one of the most balanced killers. Super fun to play as and to play against
---
Strangers thing isn't on mobile though
---
He is very very very very very balanced.
---
k
---
Oh didn't recognise her
---
But with add ons he really strong?

Damn I only get a ‚Äúk‚Äù
---
Given up have you?
---
I'm the dwight in this picture! Thank you everyone for all the kind comments üòä
---
This is EXACTLY what I was thinking mate
---
You didn't read their question right. They said "I have no friends to play with will I have fun" and you answered like they said "I have friends to play with, will I have fun?"
---
I makes no sense to say it "give[s] you an advantage" if the person said they have **no** friends to play with
---
I don't think they are, only emblems screenshots
---
Woops. My bad, didn't see the negation. I'll edit that, thanks!
---
It was endgame, last survivor hooked, was a Myers so nothing else to do
---
Thanks for that.
---
I see now, thanks!
---
Fuck you too "we can forget the passive part now" you can tell jokes safe behind a fucking screen. If i knew where the fuck you were id burn your fucking house down you stupid pussy
---
Lmao
---
What does mobile have to do with anything i thought this was a q&amp;a live stream lol
---
Exactly. All the fuck you can say dumbass
---
Three of them are MH the rest are 1/6 scale bodies and have all been sculpted or enchanced. Doing the Clowns body shape is the easy part compared to his outfit
---
I did not mention the crouch thing, yes. But I did mention that her traps are extremely good at chases if they are put down.  I just forgot to add that crouch walking everywhere without urban evasion is a crawl
---
You are absolutely committed to the part, aren‚Äôt you?

Spine Chill

Can we get an F for our moried steve's
---
I may at some point but like I've said. He won't be cheap

I try to be as productive as possible when i play on ps4 i see the same thing  as you
---
Nah I'm just pissed off, it'll blow over eventually and I'll forget this whole thread even happened
---
Then don‚Äôt ready up when you see the names. Don‚Äôt ready up just to ruin the game for these people. Not only that but you‚Äôre ruining the experience for everyone else in that game too.

Her coat is done I can't get the head to look decent though, several tries

Nah in purple ur teamates are generally still trash. I've had a few good games in rank 1 ur teamates are sometimes good  but the killer is bringing a Mori and iridescent addons rank generally dosnt mean anything I have a friend who has to drink half a gallon of whisky every day or he gets sick true alcoholic and he always misses skill checks and can't loop at all and he's rank 8 just cuz he plays the game every day but he's perpetually drunk
---
I'm good, bitch

Yeah she's one of my favourites the figure seems to give off some Susie attitude ü§£

And what pissed you off, exactly? Looks to me you‚Äôre pretty bipolar.

Good luck to you too soldier

Yeah got it from my dad, don't know how to contain it sorry bro and the other guy

It‚Äôs a video game community. It‚Äôs not like the people are being racist in real life. That‚Äôs like saying you‚Äôre gonna shoot people in real life because you play call of duty.
---
if you sorted by new youd know that these get posted very, very often. idk why everyone thinks reddit is a place to come and post their achievements. tell that shit to your friends or something idgaf about your perfect game.
---
also this is against the rules of the subreddit. it is oversaturated content. but good on you calling someone(who is completely in the right btw) out and making yourself look like an idiot

I... right. See I, and everybody else was under the impression that you were a troll.

This is a twist.

Oh jesus

it is. how is this any different from the emblem screenshots? same shit different screen
---
Wow amazing work where can I buy one of these?
---
OMG i need these skins in the game
---
This shit goes hard

Ye i got hit trough that ones and i have been using this trick ever since. Only works in this corner.
---
Not this game my friend...not everyone can enjoy this game
---
god ur so right, killers are so much smarter than survivors üòùüòùüòé killer main btw :3333
---
U get points for tea bagging?? Lmaooo
---
Are these for sale? (Say yes)
---
These are so amazing! I think clown might be my favorite. I love the string of fingers attached to the fan lmao
---
Decisive Strike - I know it‚Äôs a bit of a meta boring pick but being able to Deliverance off the hook in front of the killer and stun him with DS feels so scummy I love it
---
My friend is like that too, ever since frames got better so did nurse
---
I play both and enjoy playing both but the downside to playing killer is that I get called out all the time if they lose. I really get discouraged to play killer when I get a bad game I get called a baby and people start acting toxic and when I get a medium game and only 1/2 people get killed I get called a tunneler/camper/cheater etc. Sometimes ggs and the only way to silence them is absolutely destroy them and get 4ks :p.
---
But I don't care anymore tbh. I know I did everything in my power to play a fair game and if you don't agree so be it.
---
It is so lame how killers think a survivor isn't getting that they want to farm. I 100% never want to farm. I play the game to challenge myself to get better not to gather points. Just play and you get points anyway.

The image isn‚Äôt related to DBD but it hasn‚Äôt been instantly removed? Weird, it‚Äôs happened to me whenever I‚Äôve tried.
---
People who make this argument by totaling up the overall time are completely missing the point. The inner strength total time is spread out and operates on convenience. People should be doing totems anyway **as they see them**, so you'll have inner strength ready to go **when you need it**. It's not like you get injured and say "oh shit I need to heal" and then find a totem to cleanse and then get into a locker.
---
You're also protected from Nurse's
---
What? No? You get points for chase and escape or whatever like you would if you waited at the gate.
---
This is honestly so good and I‚Äôm sad that we can‚Äôt have this on console
---
Its 4 player co-op. Unless you're using lfg you not gonna have in game matchmaking

The trick to Ghostface is constant map awareness and strategic use of your ability. Use tracking perks to find survivors constantly and do your best to keep track of where they go. Ghostface is really just an M1 killer without his ability, so use the ability as much as you can. Make sure it's worth the use because you have a 30 second cool down but the ability itself can be used for more than just stalking. Sometimes if someone's looping me pretty well I'll end up using my ability to mindgame them (go behind a wall and they have no idea where I went) and catch them off guard. Leaning is also a critical mechanic, it sometimes seems finicky but do it whenever you can, it almost guarantees a down. Ghostface is a tricky but rewarding killer to play. To really get him down you have to practice and learn the tricks to playing him through trial and error. A lot of the time you have to be the Ghostface in a sense. You have to think and act like the killer, track people and remain unseen. Think of how survivors would react and plan ahead, watch where they go and how they play, and try and outsmart them through mind games and surprise. Often survivors will see you before you're done stalking, but do what you can to stop yourself from getting exposed (crouching and hiding). If they're almost fully stalked and you get exposed, leave them and find another survivor so the next time you see the stalked one, just enter your ability, stalk for a second, easy down. The hardest aspect I deal with as Ghostface is knowing when to stop chasing. When you're aren't stalking people, putting them in fear and making them do less risky plays, gens get done quick. If someone's looping you and you've wasted a bit of time there, move on to another person and have the survivors come to you. When you are chasing someone you stop putting pressure on the map and that can really hurt the end result, especially because Ghostface is very prone to looping so chases can be long. I main Ghostface because I enjoy trying to outsmart the survivors and stealthily catch them off guard. When used right Ghostface is incredibly powerful, but they labeled him as a hard killer for a reason. You get off track and don't use your ability for a bit and just m1, the game ends quick, it's all about thinking ahead and doing something to outsmart the survivors. There unfortunately aren't many tutorials for Ghostface and while I main him, I'm not your rank 1, thousand hours in dbd kind of guy, so hopefully this brief rundown helps. You won't win every game but we all start somewhere, so have fun with it and learn as you go, you make the game what it is. Happy Ghosting!
---
I use BBQ/Thrilling Tremors/Hex: Ruin/I'm All Ears
---
Hmmm hmm hm hmmm la la laalaa laaa
---
A lot of these aren‚Äôt very good, either don‚Äôt make sense(what is pulling a pallet from a short distance mean?), are very slight variations on current perks(prayer closet is just nancys new perk but without the totem requirement), or are bad(how would screaming near the killer help at all?). Maybe some of the survivors would be cool to have, but none of these perks should be put in the game. Love flavor could be interesting though.

As a console player I have a question about ptb‚Äôs. Does everybody get to use the new characters or do they have to pay first
---
As one shit perk addonless Wraith :O Is it even possible?
---
It‚Äôs just to rub it in the Killers face that they managed to escape.
---
What‚Äôs it‚Äôs like having Tanataphopbia ? I‚Äôm convinced it doesn‚Äôt exist on my plague, it still hasn‚Äôt appeared.
---
Oh sorry the description made it sound like you thought that, but ya I think it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúhaha eat my ass‚Äù thing lol
---
Imagine making a post just to shit talk an entire sub.
---
Its saying haha you can't close it before i jump in. What about when the killer closes the hatch and slugs at it Same thing.
---
And that other 15% consists of pointless bitchy posts like this.
---
Twitch streamers are the worst, just play the damn game. Twitch takes the fun out of it for me imo.
---
Tbh i fucks with classic villians. That alone can be a whole new season. Wolfman dracula the creature from the black lagoon etc. Be lit.

Do you sell them any place?
---
What else do you want to see? This isn't some complex game with a professional community. There's really not too much else to discuss
---
I commonly have this happen when I get hooked or picked up, some you like it. lol
---
They did, unintentinal i think
---
We all are when we‚Äôre new. But now that you have this information, it‚Äôs up to you. But if you continue to tunnel despite this knowledge then don‚Äôt complain about genrush or toxicity like a majority of people on this sub
---
You complain about people being naturally defensive over something they love and then you continue to be a prick about it.
---
10/10 this is the internet dumpsterfire I live for.
---
I've seen some honestly claim it was to get points but I think it leans more towards the "haha, I get out" than anything else. The amount of boldness/chase points you'd get from that encounter are extremely low and won't make a difference for a pip anyway.

So they did or they didn‚Äôt? The description of the perk doesn‚Äôt include vaulting so.

It is a Q&amp;A live stream.. About mobile DBD
---
The dlc isnt out yet so you cant pay
---
If you're a "pussy" then I'd suggest Distortion, helps you hide better and be more aware of how to hide better from the killer.
---
You see her A LOT around ranks 6 - 10. Gotta agree with you though, she's a killer that really does force the knowledge and raw skill you have as a player out of you. Definitely the next killer I buy if I do, Ace main ‚úå
---
That's what I assumed but the lack of teabagging threw me off lol. I was like "I'm not even sure if they're being rude?"
---
They never intended it work with vaults, hence it is not in the description. Devs liked it so they kept it, thats what they said atleast. A patch however removed the effect. Some people in this thread say that it got added back so I honestly don‚Äôt know if it works that way right now.
---
As a 60/40 player I think both sides are entitled to complain, but for some reason this game makes people WAY more hostile
---
lol I assumed but wasn't sure. Thanks
---
Yeah mega confusion hahahahaha.
---
It is technically a sub-set of tunneling if the killer still goes after you, even with body blockers.
---
Question: do killers like to tunnel Dwights the most? Whenever I play Dwight, I tend to get more tunneled often, even with survivors trying to body block.
---
Sooo I would say then just do more blinks and a range increaser, so you get the extra blinks without the penalty to blink distance
---
 Not even the entity knows Obama‚Äôs last name,
---
Meh, i'll wait for bl to not be a epic game store exclusive and maybe for it to go on sale just because they pulled that crap
---
YES
---
But only when the killer just happened to be walking towards you, unaware that you are there
---
What about your perk in the box ?
---
Fuckin me everytime I get a 4K at rank 3
---
Was it? I haven‚Äôt kept up much on TellTale news since maybe ep 2 of their first walking Dead game. I always appreciated the style and artwork but life gets busy and well...Destiny and FGC titles have always kinda taken priority haha. I honestly didn‚Äôt know one was supposed to be made.
---
The laughing from the doctor makes it even better
---
Okay well Adrenaline shouldn‚Äôt be changed when the good survivors wanna use it since the bad killers wanna use Noed
---
how is dead hard a pussy perk literally every red rank surv uses it because its a good perk
---
fucking lol I goddamn love this. You literally ignored everything I said and just parroted the same talking point of "You get adrenaline by completing your objective" like an NPC
---
so you're telling me that every survivor who has ever received Adrenaline equally contributed to the objective being completed? Or was helpful to the team?
---
Do you think no one has ever ran Adrenaline and had it proc despite doing jack shit?
---
I‚Äôm rank 7 as Billy and I get a lot of salt for being good it sucks that‚Äôs why I just say gg and leave

Sorry I don‚Äôt see a link :(

---
How is there a  BP economy when it isn‚Äôt tradeable?
---
If all the gens are done and you‚Äôve only got 1 guy on the hook, don‚Äôt be an asshole and camp him. Like you‚Äôre not getting your pip, and it‚Äôs only like 1000bp to sacrifice him. Let them go honestly and give them their 5k bp. They beat you, get over it.
---
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs far stronger than most m1 killers‚Äù

That... was a joke right? You can‚Äôt be serious.

---
It's a team game. You got it for doing the objective. Did you deserve noed for being trash? No. But you still got it anyways.
---
Hunting mode a bit op?
---
Good meme
---
It's not camping them if you intend to use them as bait to lure other survivors. Worse case you do only yet 1000bp. 
---
Best case you lure other survivors to the bait and net even more kills. 
---
Face camping is one thing. Raging at a killer for using one survivor to catch others ridiculous.
---
That‚Äôs oddly specific, and actually makes a lot of sense.
---
something is either overpowered underpowered or balanced. nurse is undeniably  stronger than certain other killers and if she is balanced as you say then most other killers are underpowered
---
Are you a killer main?
---
It happens, lol. Awesome work!
---
&gt; You got it for doing the objective.
---
so the claudette who urban evade the whole match around the perimeter of the map did the objective? interesting
---
&gt; Did you deserve noed for being trash? No. But you still got it anyways.
---
I know that you desperately need it to be true, but I don't use NOED. sorry, sport
---
To be honest, having Asian themed killer skins that aren't the Spirit would be amazing.

I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt look the other way
---
It could be to help get the points in the evader emblem if they haven't had a lot of favorable chases in the match. It gives them a small nudge for being in your terror radius as you walk towards it and a little bit more for entering a chase and "evading" without being hit. It may just be to taunt for some.
---
Doesn't matter if you use it or not 'sport' Noed is a reward for failing your objective. Adrenaline is a rewarded for completing it. It's that simple.
---
Would love to see Space suit Dwight as a cosmetic.
---
Tenacity, Unbreakable, Flip Flop, Boil Over
---
I call it the "don't touch me!" build. It let's you crawl away and pick yourself up if they slug you. But if they try to pick you up before you get your recovery to 100% you have a good chance to wiggle free

I would have so much fun with this. It will make it so easy to switch targets and spread the pain and with certain perks he will be very good. The perks are all really cool, I especially like Hex: Agony. This is in fact, pretty damn neat.‚Äô
---
Oh very nice! Good job on the craftsmanship
---
okay, so your counter argument is just "no lol"
---
got it
---
this is exactly what I expected from a survivor main
---
but since we're going to go down this route, then wouldn't it be fair to say that a killer who got two kills and then got NOED deserved it? Or how about a killer who played really fair and two hooked everyone before trying to kill someone and the gens got done? Wouldn't they deserve it?
---
If not, why not?
---
If a survivor deserves Adrenaline just for barely doing the bare minimum, then similarly shouldn't the killer deserve NOED by that standard?
---
Faz o urro
---
Spine Chill, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, We'll Make It, Borrowed Time
---
We see ping too but it often doesn't help against these guys with unstable connections.  Their ping will show fine but then everytime they initiate a chase their connection suddenly goes to Jupiter and you're freezing at every vault and pallet and violently rubber banding backwards into the killer or in and out of houses.
---
Now we're talkin
---
I mean, yeah he kinda is. Not like I  would smash
---
Thanks for the help and replying so fast
---
It feels like it‚Äôs every time I leave, so whenever im about to leave a gem, I wait for a skill check to pop up, and then immediately get off.
---
I need this. Very epic
---
I don't seem cover until my Spine Chill goes off and I can see the killer is coming directly to the gen Im on. Or when a random survivor is in a chase and I'm not in a good area to run away and they bring the killer by me (I.e. dart behind a tree before the killer sees me as running by).
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call that a nerf, only ever applying deep wounds when the power is active is pretty useless since people just mend immediately and get back on gens but instead the power would just let him end chases sooner and stop looping easier
---
In this game mediocre is weak, he has no chance againts a swf of 4 man
---
all the damn time tho
---
never expect the skill check when I'm just trying to get off the gen and prepare to loop the killer
---
Unbreakable, decisive strike, deliverance and head on. Unhook yourself in the killers face, run to a locker and Tbag near it, they either slug you, which you just get up with unbreakable, or pick you up, at which point you D strike, then while they are stunned, get in the locker and head on them as soon as you can. Eeeeeeez DC.
---
Ask bhvr lol. That was their so called excuse üòÇ
---
It does that already (30s respawn time increases)
---
Looks like Ghostface is looking at that Trapper booty.
---
Yeah! Fuck you for using a perk for its intended purpose! /s
---
Thanks for the tips and easy dc
---
Survivor mains say that NOED rewards killers for failing the objective. I think that, similarly, a survivor who got Adrenaline but wasn't helping the team was rewarded for failing the objective and rode on back of people who actually did.
---
I think it's weird that survivor mains constantly complain about their teammates being bad, i.e. failing the objective, but don't mind their teammates who failed the objective getting Adrenaline
---
the survivor main talking point is that Adrenaline is the reward for doing the objective, but there are objectively people who do not do the objective and get Adrenaline. I know this because survivor mains are constantly complaining about teammates not doing anything
---
I was having fun lately with Dead Hard, We'll make it, Borrowed Time &amp; Head on. Consistently escaping. If I'm not in the terror radius I just heal them and if I am in the terror radius and the killer is returning or the survivor I unhooked moves to stop the heal.
---
You're exactlty right.  Neither one of them really needs a change.  They're both well known perks that are fairly easily adapted to.

I dont know how many times I gotta tell you. You failed to defend all five gens. Doesnt matter if theres one person left or four. You failed your objective plain and simple. You don't deserve a reward for being Shit. It doesn't matter how many hooks you got, or how many kills. NOED is a reward for failing to defend all the gens.
---
True. I did love this last season.
---
Just because you, a single person are fine with it, doesn‚Äôt mean we all are. You‚Äôre not the only person who plays this game and the person above is 100% right. There is too much potential for this to be misused. And the middle finger thing is literally just going to be BM to piss people off. 
---
Unsafe unhooks happen. Sometimes it‚Äôs desperation because the person knows it‚Äôs either try and save you or you both die. Unsafe unhooks are not always malicious in nature. And sometimes you have to at least try and safe someone before they hit struggle so that they at least have a second chance. Or to save them from dying on hook because you know you the only one capable of it. I‚Äôd rather die trying to same my team than leave them behind where they don‚Äôt even get a chance.
---
I don't disagree, I was just asking a question. Appreciate people that think you can't ask a question without downvoting it.
---
Hopefully they get you some dedi's.
---
So you farmed 3 times and then got two safe unhooks and you wonder why you got no emblem? Fuck you.
---
I find good enjoyment from ace in the hole, plunderers instinct, self care, urban evasion. Adds an extra level of excitement seeing what the entity will grant you from the chests.
---
RIP Diamond items
---
Ah okay, so you're going to hypocritically apply one standard to survivors and another to killers.
---
survivors deserve adrenaline no matter what they do or do not do, and killers never deserve NOED ever
---
what about survivors escaping with keys before all gens are done? they didn't do their objective fully and were rewarded, no?
---
Seems legit
---
Memes aside, is cleansing when all gens done and about to escape not fine? Means you can take an extra hit and she has to spend time going to collect it while gates are pressured.
---
?
---
Good survivors take advantage of DS having such a long timer. They'll sit on gens in your face or take hits for other survivors, etc. BT is only an issue at the end, but in that scenario it's a guarenteed escape for the saved survivor, which is very strong. Then adrenaline allows survivors to never worry about healing and just rush gens to get their free heals, dead hard let's you make mistakes that would have killed you but instead lead you to keep looping and you get like 3+ uses of DH. Second chance perks are VERY strong and that's why everyone uses them.
---
Yeah... Not sure if completely changing what makes that game good was the "obvious" choice. I love both of these games, but if you wanna call one of them repetitive it's definitely dbd more so than borderlands. To compare borderlands to FORTNITE tells me enough to know that we won't agree on anything LMFAO.

In his scenario of open exit gate it's endgame man those other 3 survivors are out regardless.  They'll all be in one of two places either close enough to the gate to make it out even after taking a hit OR going for the save on the hooked survivor.  Use logic and explain to us why strategically in that very specific scenario why a killer is best off leaving the hook.  I don't believe you can your opinion stems from the entitlement that that survivor is owed an escape.
---
I dunno, i'm checking Steam and i don't see anything about BL3, so it must have been cancelled.  Oh well, guess i'll have to give my money to BHVR instead.
---
Ahh nevermind then
---
Well then it should do more. Saboing hooks is already a huge waste of time as it is
---
Congratulations on your first shitpost here... cool
---
Its unfortunate because both sides are equally toxic but they both act like it's just one side. The killer and survivor feud has honestly killed the genre and main focus of this game being in the horror aspect and turned into one of the most toxic competetive games there is. I've played the same amount of time in both sides and its pretty fair to believe this when you have.
---
A) If you don't cleanse you create a 'stink aura' around you, any decent plague can trace your trail.
---
B) If you cleanse, yeah you can hide after that, but you just send your friends to the Normandy Beach to face Nazi Machine Guns my friend.

Only build that makes it possible to get 60k in a survivor match without any offerings, although I usually only get 40-50k :(
---
Instagram is pretty bad when it comes to posting artwork without credit or permission. I like prowling on twitter for DBD art. There's a ton of really talented artists from all around the world and with the retweets, they still get credit.
---
If you're rocking a swf easy counter and just gen rush. If you're in a pug then I would get popcorn and enjoy the show.
---
I see plenty of killers counter Adrenaline just like how you break all the totems to counter Noed
---
This is top tier shitposting.
---
Please blur the names in the future. :)
---
I've really be wanting to play, but the person in charge of my PS-Plus refuses to renew it because, "I don't use the Playstation."
---
Your Reddit age isn't much higher than mine?
---
I'm talking about the players that crouch whenever they hear the heartbeat and are to scared to get into chase. Also if they do get into chase they camp pallets and waste all of them to where others have nothing to try and loop.
---
I once had 2 Davids escorting me around at the end as I played as Kate.
---
Flair checks out
---
Dwight has ascended.
---
LOL XD thamks for sharing
---
Not when they don't do the objective and just crouch around and hide all game.
---
It's Sunday. I'm not in the mood for this.
---
There‚Äôs definitely no one or ‚Äúright‚Äù way to play a killer but I‚Äôd be a little confused after facing a Michael that didn‚Äôt stalk lol
---
Yum
---
Let me try
---
I don't use Twitter because the one time I went on it, there it was all politics.
---
It should let you cleanse totems faster
---
It works for me. I think they were mad they died
---
No idea what you mean.
---
It's sad to see it every game. I don't care if you use it just do the objective and don't throw every pallet down without looping when your in chase. I see so many people camp pallets and just waste them then everyone else gets downed because there's nothing to loop.
---
I mean then you just do the gens if they are only protecting the totem. Or you just do the totem when someone's being chased and the killer has to either let that survivor go or lose their totem. Or you use the Thrill of the Hunt notifications to distract the killer and make them think someones breaking the totem and waste their time.
---
If you're playing a no blink Nurse, then you are definitely playing wrong
---
They really should nerf lag, too op
---
I think it‚Äôs 5 tokens at end game, so that bad gameplay isn‚Äôt rewarded
---
I don‚Äôt really understand how these things are related? Survivors typically complain about useless teammates in games where they DON‚ÄôT make it to end game, precisely because their teammates were useless. If they do well enough to proc Adrenaline they probably won‚Äôt complain about their team because their team actually did the objective.
---
It's only if you have negative karma, which I do.
---
No. Everything you do on PTB doesn't transfer into the official server, and vice versa.
---
No sadly
---
Pretty "Lubed" job I would say!
---
Ok thx man

---
All I have is DBD artwork, horror artwork, cute comics etc. The algorithm will give you more suggestions of previous stuff you've liked. When I joined, I already knew the names of a few artists so it all built up from there.
---
Ohh. Thank you
---
I have spent entire 3 hour play sessions on DBD not having fun once.  
---
I also have new games I've never played because I play DBD instead.
---
Wow that‚Äôs a lot of perks. Good for you to come up with all this
---
Those ofuda on the huntress' hatchet...is that iridescent head?
---
&gt; A Massively Unreasonable Buff for Almost Every Killer Perk
---
I fixed your title, OP.
---
I always get the "you've been doing that too much try again in 5 minutes" on my second comment if I try to post within a couple minutes of another comment on this sub
---
This is the only sub that does that unless connection issues lead to me spamming post
---
I'm using the phone app btw
---
Spine Chill, Dance With Me, Quick and Quiet, and Lithe/Urban Evasion (I usually switch between these 2). You usually don't get caught til the very end when there are only 3 gens left. I once spent almost an entire came trying to figure out who the killer was...then i stepped in a fucking bear trap and figured it out
---
It would be a great opportunity to give him some new cosmetics, whether this or something else.
---
Your words dont move me
---
what part of my comment was serious
---
Oh no it's a wraith
---
I straight up just want the third perk in the game, it looks like so much fun.
---
Especially this.
---
dbdgw? haha just joking.. unless?..
---
Why rank 8 specifically? The requirements of ranking up get harder once you hit red rank so it's objectively more difficult.
---
shhhhh just be scarified
---
Demodevito works too
---
Cujo barks and Huntress goes to hook
---
Why is rank 8 the magic number
---
People will probably still complain about it in the comments somewhere. I'll see what can be done about removing the oversaturation of "haha salty killers/survivors" discussions and rants.
---
He has a bucket of water he‚Äôll be fine
---
I can admit, the demogorgon is pretty, but come on, those vinyl pop things are everywhere, with everything, every thing imaginable, clearly a company meant to milk money out of a everything
---
I left three team mates dies while watching them. Two were SWF who were toxic to the killer and refused getting healed by me the third was idiot who hide at the corner of the map all the time for no reason yeah I was running bond perk. I can see sons of bitches not doing gens and flash light tea bag killers at every pallet. I escaped through the hatch a second before killer Insta kill me with NOED. satisfaction
---
Thank :3
---
Hex: Death soup
---
Fuck that guy.  People like that are what's wrong with the world.
---
He's not effective in chases
---
i just want a 2018 michael with the worn out mask and stuff i love mike but i think his mask is too clean
---
I‚Äôd run the fuck out of beast of prey if it got that change
---
Why does this exist ? Just why?
---
This is amazing! Though if it portrayed you grabbing Dwight from a locker, it‚Äôd be hilarious! üòÇüòÇ
---
Potato ranks be like
---
Well, for me the choice is easy. Neither.
---
I ain't gonna support Epic Store with their exclusives and the ST DLC isn't interesting enough to warrant a purchase.
---
Never do teabag a ghostface.
---
Why because you will loop then on a window for 5 gens and when they finally catch you there gonna camp you behind the tree like people don't notice?
---
Enduring is a poor recommendation
---
*laughs in groovy*
---
Bothers me so much because the middle and left should be switched around.
---
I play console Nurse, and I like to mostly run tracking perks. I do fairly well with her when I play.
---
From her base perks, I use Nurse's Calling, but I'm thinking about switching it out for something else. At the moment, it's still a great perk for me, as getting the first hit is usually the easy part, but I tend to lose people during the blink stun. Some peoplelike to use Sloppy Butcher with Nurse's because it adds 8 seconds to the heal. I used to run it, but found I was usually fine without it.
---
BBQ is in my loadout mostly for when there are fewer survivors left. It really helps track down those last couple instead of hunting for immersed players.
---
Surveillance is my favourite perk for Nurse, because I can instantly see when someone is working on a gen I damaged. I can quickly blink back, and I know I've got at least one person in the area. Discordance might be a good option as well, as knowing where two or more survivors are at once can put a lot of pressure on the team.
---
My only non-tracking perk is Pop Goes the Weasel, arguably the best killer perk in the game at the moment. To take advantage of this one, you'll need to be getting hooks though, so swap it out if you're still having difficulties getting hooks.
---
Another option I might recommend is Infectious Fright, which can help you snowball a win if people are hanging out in groups. Nurse's high mobility can easily allow you to catch multiple people in the same area.
---
Personally, I don't run any add-ons. I used to run a 3rd blink when I was getting used to playing her, but I've dropped that now. I find that her blinking is muscle memory, so any changes to distance, charge time, etc can throw you off.
---
Good luck with the Nurse, and I hope you have some thick skin. People like to BM a lot when you play Nurse compared to other killers.
---
/r/deadmemes
---
Yeah, decisive strike, adrenaline and borrowed time
---
Probably not at rank 20
---
Ah yes, the famous werewolf ability to see in infrared
---
After i was body blocked from hooking survivors multiple times the other day i decided i will camp since they wanted to start their BS early and then i proceeded to get bombarded with messages screaming at me for camping after they wanted to body block hooks one after the other
---
The other day, an injured survivor was teabagging at the exit gate...so I hit her, and she didn't make it to the escape wall. I picked her up, teammate tried to flashlight me but I just turned around and hooked her. Everyone else left. She was a good sport about it post game though :)
---
Siiiiick
---
Keys are a bullshit mechanic
---
That‚Äôs a new one
---
Dumb Dwight stands at wrong spot, dumb nurse looks straight at person with flashlight
---
Epic rank 14 play
---
I wish I hadn‚Äôt clicked that.
---
Sounds like the DBD menu theme dont ya think?
---
I like how bubba is wearing crocs 10/10
---
Perhaps it‚Äôs human nature lol? I don‚Äôt really see Huntress having a threesome with Shirtless Myers and David as a problem hahaha
---
Its real. Asia always has the coolest spin to western fastfood chains.
---
7.
---
Breakdown. Every time they are unhooked, the hook breaks.
---
‚ÄúEntity, I‚Äôm trying to sneak around, but the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the survivors‚Äù
---
Ok then thrilling tremors or spirit fury
---
Here is the top notch high rank meta build :
---
Decisive, Borrowed time, Dead hard and as 4th perk either Unbreakable, or Iron Will, or We'll make it.
---
It will be extremely useful for all your survivor games.
---
Now, here are some fun specialized builds i play, way less meta :
---
**Medic** : Empathy, Autodidact, Solidarity, Spine chill. The point is to try to never be chased (thanks to spine chill for exemple) and run after all your injured teamates to heal them as fast as possible thanks to Autodidact. When you got your 4 or 5 stacks it's really fun.
---
**Scavenger** : Pharmacy, Plunderer instinct, Ace in the hole, bond. You start the game with an item and you give it to the first teamate you find, then you open a chest and either give the item to someone else or play in synergie with the item you found.
---
**Houdini** : Quick and Quiet, Dance with me, Lithe, Iron will. Ultimate anti Spirit build. As soon as the killer is on your ass, you search for a jungle gym and fast vault it to disappear. No scratchmarks no fast vault sound.
---
New Survivor:  ‚ÄòThe Wolf‚Äô Winston Wolfe
---
Perk 1:  **A Good Once Over**-  Survivors within (24/28/32) meters of you do not leave pools of blood when injured, and their scratch marks are moderately less bright.
---
Perk 2:  **I Like Oak, Myself**-  Start the game with (1/2/3) tokens. After opening a chest but before taking the item, you may spend 1 token to close the chest.  Searching it again is guaranteed to generate a new item, and rerolling a chest without taking the item has a (25/33/50)% chance of generating an item of higher rarity.  Note:  Once the item is taken, either by you or a teammate, you may not close a chest again.
---
Perk 3:  **I Solve Problems**-  If the last 3 uncompleted generators are within a (20/24/28) meter area, all survivors other than yourself gain a 12% increase in generator repair speed, and great skill checks grant a bonus (3/4/5)% generator progression.  Note: a survivor can only benefit from one instance of **I Solve Problems** at a time, with the highest version taking first priority if multiple players have different perk levels.
---
As someone who plays killer a lot... I don't agree with that.
---
For real, looked so awkward. #NotMyNea
---
Ik but I had other account before this one and I was just btw lol.
---
Edited save file
---
You can't de-rank back to brown ranks. I think the lowest you can get is 15 or something, one of the yellow ranks. 
---
They changed it when they did some rank tweaks.
---
You can't go below rank 15 iirc
---
420th like. Nice.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d1e9iz/inspiration_for_the_spirit/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
These perks aren't exactly... optimal. I don't think a hacker would give themselves tier 3 unrelenting lol. 
---
Most likely they haven't touched killer in a while and rank reset put them all they way down there.
---
Same!  Otherwise I feel like I‚Äôm playing Russian roulette
---
This guy has killer and survivor perks, I think he‚Äôs life hacking
---
I think tunneling is annoying but Its only shitty to an extent. Plus DS and BT does a decent job countering it, so I don't get that annoyed with it, unless its an all game tunnel.
---
I'm saying in this context, the meme is putting the blame on the farmer. Having tunneling killer isn't that relevent, it wouldn't fit the meme if it just said killer. And again, it is tunneling, so it fits. Even if it's more justifiable than other forms of tunneling.
---
Someone is a bad killer.
---
Totem: isn't behind the exist gate
---
Killer: uwu

You can play on a different console, so long as they don‚Äôt find out.
---
You‚Äôre free to make new accounts after getting banned, but if you repeat the offense they‚Äôll hardware ban you as they have already.
---
How about you just stop using glitches if you love the game so much
---
I love this, considered toxic but what are you supposed to do. Flashlight perhaps isn‚Äôt necessary but it isn‚Äôt toxic
---
Oddly cute
---
Perfection
---
Problem is that perks like UE and Self-Care keep getting recommended to newer players. Ranking system + matchmaking is whack so those players end up in your game regardless
---
The wolf among us?!
---
Myers*
---
I tried not like doing that what you said i ran into them that like keeps the game away. I mean now i had an glitch that i couldn¬¥t search for an lobby or the game wont satrt because of an error sign. But i tried making new accounts like most had 1.5 playhours and they banned me for nothing.. il just played normally
---
Can spend survivor BP on killer.
---
Can derank purposely.
---
Could have been a long time since he played killer and got rank reset.
---
Is that a smash mod that replaces luigi with wallace?
---
I have no clue what you said, English please
---
haha i know hey, he was super aggressive for what was the whole of the game, exactly, i could‚Äôve been toxic and tbagged or taunted him, but i really just wanted to play haha
---
You can also... Leave?
---
I know I know sound silly, almost like asking to a whole community to be funnier like some sort of dictator, but it might work!
---
Why the Vinegar though?
---
I did make new accounts to play Dead By Daylight again. But they banned me again and again. And i did nothing like with cheats and glitches this time it worked completly fine. but still get banned
---
I am cummed.
---
OwO what's this?
---
Look up some ptb footage, she was incredibly loud and got so many complaints they changed her voice actor.
---
The Demogorgon looks like it's a super fair and balanced Killer. Like No0b3 said, power has potential, but it's counter-able. I feel the Demogorgon will be around where Myers and Freddy is on the tier list, being lower end of high tier. Hopefully they take notes of how this chapter was so that they could make more like it.
---
If you‚Äôve been banned multiple times, they‚Äôll ban you for making new accounts. Your only way to not get banned is to play on a different console, and make sure they don‚Äôt find out its you(unless you‚Äôre a streamer, they probably won‚Äôt know its you).
---
Yeah lmao I know some killers have such a low tolerance for shit
---
Bruh
---
Omg I got pig by saying that what luck
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Is it just console that has these bugs?? I always see console posting bugs and have experienced only few on pc. Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky lol.
---
How could he not be cute? He's just a little walking flower with a 6 pack!
---
Please blur out the name next time. Thank you.
---
Haha this reminds me of my first Ghostface game earlier today, on Haddonfield, in that same room on that same generator, the same thing happened
---
That's crazy lmao
---
Susie mains rise up!
---
A walking flower with a six pack, never heard that one but I love it lol! I always thought the Demo was more goofy looking than scary (except for all those teeth rows, creeps me out) but hey!
---
Yeah, I love it when a stealthy killer manages to spook me. Or I'm hiding and they barely miss me. Or they go after the survivor that sandbagged or hook-farmed me.
---
I like to talk about these things with them. But they're so scared of some twerking pink-haired fartsniffer saying "gg ez" that they deny themselves the chance of any positivity.
---
Yeah except I wasn't as blind as this Ghostface lol
---
Demodog
---
Then say survivors have no second chance perks and call him a baby killer for not bringing Franklin's (which youd dc if he had), iron maiden(which youd call a crutch perk somehow), and exhaustion addons(which youd call op). Then say he camped and tunneled when you were the one who deliverance 2 seconds after hook.
---
had a 30 or so minute game against a freddy a couple days ago and it was like impossible to hit those skillchecks even when it wasn't lagging
---
I went to books a million and sadly couldn‚Äôt find a Steve one
---
&gt;it seems that players try to dissuade others from using high impact perks.
---
If you mean noed then no. It's simply the fact that noed is useless when you hit red ranks since it won't even activate. For example a Myers would prefer a Spirit fury endurance combo than that. Then ruin to be safe and save the best for last, it's not that you won't use high impact perks.. if they don't work it's a "no impact" perk.
---
Low survivors will cry for noed even if it's the weakest hex I can think about since by the time the gens are done also totems are gone.
---
If you look it up you'll find different perks for different killers unlike survivors which are just skins and the meta is more than enough to get through the ranks
---
For example a nurse won't use the pallet stun combo but something to help her find people, like huntress, having already a good chase ability. While who struggles with loops will use something else (like m1 killer with spirit + enduring combo(
---
how? title made it obvious
---
I don't know how he didn't see me but that ghost face was potato, he only got like 2 hooks that game, even with the white ghostface skin, don't you get that for testing him in the ptb?
---
In one of the streams they said that they were going to look into all changes with nurse and doctor.
---
Whilst with nurse they said it was going to be mainly focused on her add-ons and maybe some slight tweaks to her power if necessary
---
Doctor they said he was going to get decent look over so he's definitely going to get an add-on pass and power changes also he's going to get another ultra rare to match up with the new add-on system
---
Was there blood warden? He deserved to die for just sitting there like a rank 21 and probably being toxic.
---
My favorite is when I leave a gen to go save, get that wonderful bullshit check, and then the killer just runs straight to me from the person they just hooked cause now they know exactly where another target is
---
Region and rank?
---
I ask region since the average game duration is way different depending on it
---
Same for adrenaline
---
They didn't said that they gonna nerf nurse. Just rework her addons. And they said they gonna rework doctor. What kind of rework it's gonna be, no one knows.
---
some people aren't familiar with the meme. it's okay.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it considering that IT is an omnipotent entity that I doubt would work for the entity
---
No but I just love playing dbd when a new season comes out
---
Please censor the names next time. Thanks!

I know what it means, it just sounds petty.

I thought it spawned when one survivor died

I would use spirit fury enduring save the best for last and ruin. It depends what you have and how many teachable you can get tho
---
I;m thinking about thos Beans
---
I adore this idea
---
Why would having 3 balloons stun the killer for 6 seconds.
---
Does the dbd chapter have a date already?
---
No problem :)
---
i mean yeah but survivor is more consistently fun
---
It's not my fault you immediately assumed. I made it clear that he bodyblocked me, then facecamped me, and had no right to call me trash. That's the whole reason I brought up that he called me trash. Seriously, dude. üòÇ
---
Just get moved 4head
---
What in gods name is this from
---
This is a hard one cause legion(Susie) is my killer main and Fengs my survivor main lol. Lithe is great cause you can use it in any map but Discordance is my fave killer perk, though monitor and abuse is also really nice. With the newest chapter legions iron maiden is going to come in handy. Figure out which perks work best for you and go from there.
---
Then why mention he body blocked. You were the one with the misleading statement
---
it's 2017 all over again

Monster high dolls for Spirit? I watch dollightful a lot and always thought about trying it. No talent though lol

I'm very excited for him, his lunges is going to be super annoying at first until you can learn to counter it but it's going to give me a scare and I love it already.
---
My third day of school will be a Friday the 13th lol
---
Learn to read,  the "unsafe" unhooks were people trying to kill themselves. They would have been safe unhooks if they didn't run right back to the killer.

September 13th right? that's my birthday!

nancy.exe has stopped responding.

who pissed in your Cheerios? tell them to shit in em next time since youre already being an asshole

Thank god for a common sense post or comment a few days ago about changing the input for skill checks. On PS4 I switched mine from L1 to square and it‚Äôs like night and day. My right hand basically rests on square so my reactions feel a little better, too.
---
k, lemmie rephrase: a few extra "seconds." In this case at least.
---
yeah but "brits are stupid" isnt nearly as fun a meme as "americans are stupid"
---
Idiots...its already on.
---
Nerds colour but good framework hooks could use some work to buy IT looks good
---
Wtf, I expanded on your chain of events with what happens usually and the opinions I've heard on this sub and in game. How am I an asshole for relaying things I've heard.
---
Crop it my guy
---
It's because the killers host the game, but the new chapter they are adding dedicated servers. Which will stop the bad connection thing
---
Ight I'll repost it
---
Her addons like 5 blinks makes no sense in balance, it's not powerful. It's fricking op broken.
---
When do you ever run into shit for saying negative shit about Surviviors? Like... honest to God link me the statements you have made
---
I was thinking the hospital gown too from halloween 4 when he has bandages around his face, but the paramedic outfit or a 2018 mask is the only plausible cosmetic we would get for him.
---
Nurse will probably get the plaid flannel add-on by default (allows you to see the landing area of the blink) and cannot do more than two blinks at a time. Or could walk as fast as the Huntress with the downside of one blink available.
---
I like playing against the nurse, but it's impossible to dodge her if she has more than two blinks available. Two blinks you can dodge and play around with through mind games. But I also dislike playing AS the nurse because she gets stunned with each unsuccessful blink (looking down and the screen darkening makes me frustrated and dizzy with the low FOV) and sometimes gets stuck in the environment or overshoots the blink. So that's why I think the plaid flannel will be default or turned into a common add-on.
---
No clue what the devs might do with the Doctor. He is just annoying to play against because you can get out of Madness III, only to be put back into it a few seconds later once it's down to the last three gens.
---
That being said, changing or getting rid of some of her addons will be a nerf in itself.
---
The song is called ‚ÄúOther Friends‚Äù from the Steven Universe movie.

So you have nothing. Got it

I think I heard someone say that the closest region you are to is where you will play in
---
My favorite is when the killer has seen you and is coming to kick your ass so you start running. *boom* extra regression for the killer.
---
Oh your right with it being bad peoples on PS4! I get them all the time and it doesn‚Äôt matter if they are red rank to green rank! Now green ranks have the best solo randoms for some reason, but then most the idiots I get lumped in with between red and purple act like they never played the game before! It drives me bonkers!

Halloween resurrection was a shit movie and the idea was so stupid. Should of just let Laurie kill Michael and left it at that. Good thing we got Halloween 2018. Aside from that little rant we should get new Michael costumes. Even give us his masks from all the movies.

Look, if Im being honest, its a good strategy if \*you're starting out in the game\*.  You have to feel confident enough to leave the person on hook. Even get the idea of, leaving a short distance so you can go back and get another hit. As shitty as camping is, they're punished pretty hard if survivors keep working on gens.

It would be nice but hes a licenced character :(

I honestly picture it more as a ghost face type of chapter, featuring just the killer.

I feel like splitting apart the loser‚Äôs club would kind of defeat the whole idea of them, but including 5-7 survivors from one franchise would be even more ridiculous.

For a second I thought about going full-on King Multiverse and designing a Roland Deschain survivor to compliment him... but thought that was a bit to Fan-Fiction-y

I would honestly love to see a Derry Map included though with the downtown area around the Movie Theater and Arcade as well as a few open manholes to drop down into network of sewer tunnels underneath that opens up into a small shallow creek or field area like the barrens where you can walk in or out of the sewer from.

you're not totally wrong. The looks we have for the PTB are from season 1.

holy shit man, how long did that take you
---
Completely agree!
---
Why did you bring two enchanted diamond pickaxes? Noob
---
This happens every time, as well as getting a skill check the very moment the killer hooks someone so you don't notice it.
---
It isn‚Äôt important at all, if anything pennywise fits perfect imo. Derry seems to me like a place that the entity could have some form of power,And bhvr have a pattern of going for licensed killers most of the time anyway.

Bruh, how can you call someone toxic because they want the struggle mechanic changed? It's so unnecessary when it could be much more accessible if it was just mash-to-suicide or something like that, especially when lag can occasionally kill you anyway, even if you don't care about the controls.

Found the bad killer main.  The only necessary buff is you getting good at the game.
---
Welcome to the game lmao. Teammates increasingly lose brain cells as you climb the ranks
---
&gt;People should be doing totems anyway
---
That's where I disagree. Cleansing dull totems is a complete waste of time if the killer does not have NOED. And it is still a complete waste of time if the killer does have NOED, unless all dull totems get cleansed, which is why I don't consider cleansing dull totems to be a viable thing to do in any match, certainly not when you are soloing and would have to search for and cleanse every single one yourself just to be sure. Even more generally, I think dealing with NOED in the end game is regularly more managable than dealing with the additional time spent locating and cleansing all dull totems throughout the round even if you could reliably get every single one.
---
As such, the time spent cleansing is definitely something to be totalled.
---
&gt;operates on convenience
---
That might be true if you do happen to stumble upon a totem before you need to heal, but because there will be moments where you do need to heal, and where you did not just conveniently happen upon a totem without having to go out of your way at all, it can't operate on convenience alone. As that, it would be unreliable at best, or yet again, a waste of time as compared to other means of healing.
---
If you combine it with Small Game or a Map and go hunting for Hex totems early game and actually manage to swiftly find and cleanse any, the perk has some merit, but like I said, I don't even think "time spent healing" is a valuable-enough quality for it to be worth a slot even if it did consistently save you time. The locker timer would have to be reduced to 5 or even 3 seconds for me to consider using the perk seriously, because in that case it could be used for mid-chase stealth-juke heals. I think that would be balanced given the risk of locker-jukes and the fact that it would only work up to a maximum of 5 times in any given match, therefore not being very metagame-suited since the more survivors use the perk, the less totems there are to go around.

A killer's not a gonna leave a hex totem to go bother with a dull totem, killers absolutely have let survivors go to defend the Hex Ruin, literally what a Michael Myers did the other day, dropping a chase on a Toxic survivor that was running meta perks and all the usual toxic bullshit just to come defend Ruin. And again, the rng screws me over with gens so that the moment progress is available to be made on a gen, it gives me a skill check. I'm not asking for Ruin to be removed or Nerfed, but for rng to be tweaked so it's not so fucking ridiculous and effectively turning an unlucky player into the killer of gens.

What about those damn nails? Those shits are long on his santa costume

Ur insinuation is that there a Survivior bias. I'm asking you to prove your claim that anti survivor statements are unpopular here

Yeah I totally agree. My broke my thumb and tapping x over and over hurts so I hope they change it so I can just hold X or don‚Äôt even need to press a button to struggle.

Anywhere between 10 and 15.

Not really...healing and other things count too

when its timed properly you can getting the blind off before the killer can look away cuz animation lock.

Yea it‚Äôs pretty bad

really? never noticed

it‚Äôs not like they can change it unless you want teleporting survivors

Thanks god not every killer is doing a post about this, cause we all experience the same, so it would be a lot of cry post... learn to own them, camp tunnel or stop playing killer if u can‚Äôt deal with it.
---
Do you want my honest opinion on small games I think it should work as a counter to Thrill of the hunt.
---
It should tell you how many totems are on the map and it should let you cleanse them faster. Also maybe giving you some bonus points in a certain category
---
Depends on the rank because huggers won't fall for it but if you're playing lower ranks pretend to phase walk, like just stand dead still and they usually walk towards you. Not even joking
---
Dustin has his moments. He‚Äôs pretty charming for some but can be annoying for others. Kind of a love him or hate him kind of deal for most.
---
Oh yes I do, lol. I hope it does get better for you and keep pushing through it :))
---
I mean besides the shred(lunge) being a little buggy with it's hit registration the demogorgon is definitely the most polished killer, the screams sound terrifying like a enraged beast, the teleport animations look fantastic the vaulting animation also looks great and need I mention how smooth the mouth opens and closes and the details inside it, it also gets bloody when you have the prestige head.

It is a good perk. I reached Rank 1 with Bubba by using this, ruin, haunted grounds, and BBQ. Pretty consistent as the notification and chainsaw combination gets easy hooks.

Lmao indeed, we had a good laugh. It felt like I was breaking the game for a second.

---
Dude I feel this on a spiritual level
---
Many ppl make a joke of buying headphones and obv that‚Äôs a big part of it. Audio is so important with her. She mostly comes down to practice and mind games. Good perks on her are map pressure builds, slow the game down perks, and detection perks. I don‚Äôt recommend aura reading perks as they go away when you‚Äôre phasing.
---
Good perks would include: 
---
-ruin
---
-bbq
---
-spirit fury
---
-enduring
---
-pop goes the weasel
---
-infectious fright
---
-devour hope
---
-haunted grounds
---
-save the best for last
---
-make your choice
---
-discordance
---
-surveillance
---
-overcharge
---
-thrilling tremors
---
-sloppy butcher
---
In chases if suggest trying to catch them normally and hitting them. Then to knock them down use your phasing as the burst of speed they get will basically be eliminated by you phasing and because they‚Äôre injured they‚Äôre easier to hear.
---
Perks not to run:
---
-I‚Äôm all ears
---
-stridor
---
-predator
---
-shadowborn(it‚Äôs decent on her but it‚Äôs more of a quality of life improvement, getting rid of pesky jukes kinda, but jukes will happen mostly when you‚Äôre phasing so it‚Äôs useless)
---
-unrelenting(I put this here because unrelenting is only useful on spirit really but even then I don‚Äôt recommend it because you‚Äôll get better and it becomes more a hindrance than anything)
---
-nurses calling
---
Well hope this helps!
---
Nice ping dude
---
Technically 5 bucks(500 auric cells) if you just want the killer. The shred is actually really buggy sometimes though so he's not wrong about that.
---
Just bring a map
---
...do you play dbd? And do u know of Stranger things?
---
And you have fun camping out by Ruin, let me know if you need any beans to cook on the fire.
---
I really like him, he's strong, but not as crazy as someone like Nurse or Spirit.  His shred is annoying to deal with, but I think once he's released and survivors play against him, they'll get used to it.  His portals are really well balanced imo, and they're a blast to play with and against.  Only thing that could be problematic is that he is really strong in the endgame, since he can easily camp both doors and has the ability to sense survivors near his portals.  So if you have a portal at both gates, survivors can't sneak a door open easily.  Also one other minor thing is that his addons are pretty boring, and basically stat boosts for the most part besides the pink ones.
---

---
you don't seem to think a lot before talking.
---
As Op sait it, you can't just slow down the game pace. Even increasing the gen repair speed by something like 10% can completely turn the table and transform a 1K into a 4K.
---
Moreover, all killers don't have the same gen pressure potential. Which means you can't simply balanced the game around Clown without changing a lot of other things. Clown is a beast at chasing. If you just nerf gen repair speed what is left for survivors ?
---
It's a difficult question with a lot of variable : Nurse - Clown, Solo - Swf, Black forest - The Game...
---
That‚Äôs Africa‚Äôs ass

Nah, bro, I'm gonna have fun, you can enjoy whatever meta perks and life ~~wasted~~ long training acquiring skills to never leave Rank 1 with rank reset.

What do the slightly increase map offerings do?

---
spirit doesn't need ruin. It is not bad but if it gets destroyed early you are playing with 3 perks
---
If you still can actually still sit there and say that there‚Äôs no skill and it‚Äôs all rng, then you honestly need help my boy. Rng to decide how many skill checks, but skill to hit them.
---
Thanks! It's really surprising that either a creepypasta or SCP hasn't been added yet
---
I‚Äôll be honest 2 things u need to learn is where to mindgame, and where survivors can mindgame u, example u can‚Äôt mindgame phase walking if u have grass around, cause survivors(high rank) will be looking for movement, that‚Äôs one of the first thing I noticed when I start playing her, also is better walk around than go to gens phasing, u want to keep the power for chases.
---
At least Bubba can one shot survivors.

When you want to vault the window in the big Torment Creek loop while the killer is on you, but decide to open the chest right next to it instead.

&gt;It seems that toxicity and salt in this community is pretty abundant.
---
Well, the term "toxic" is also thrown around far too often and easily, its hard to say what behavior exactly you are talking about if you don't give specifics.

For some people, toxic ranges from blinding at pallets to leaving the scoreboard screen without saying "gg".

Why exactly is predator useless without the ultra rare add-on?
---
Yeah I know, you‚Äôve been complaining non stop about it. And I‚Äôve been saying if you get good, it won‚Äôt affect you at all and the perk becomes meaningless. But you‚Äôre that guy that sees ruin and refuses to do gens till it‚Äôs gone. ‚ÄúIn case‚Äù I get too many skillchecks boo hoo
---
In multiplayer games when there‚Äôs 32 people, it‚Äôs easy to not even notice the bloke spouting profanities at you in chat, but when it‚Äôs 5 people including you in one match 4v1, things get much more personal. You aren‚Äôt gunning down a miscellaneous opponent among dozens of others, you‚Äôre running from the one and only dangerous foe in the match or you‚Äôre chasing one of 4 measly specific targets.
---
When they're in an open field
---
The damaging secondary attack is impossible to avoid if she *does* find you, and any Plague who isn't a pepega 4head is going to wait until she knows where Survivors are to activate it. This also comes with the fact that cleansing makes less and less fountains to cleanse with, and being broken while Plague has an AR-15 is the ultimate fail state. It's far easier to avoid NOED than it is to avoid a hacking Huntress.

If you think a survivor is hiding on the other side of something hit and don‚Äôt wanna waste time going around it just to find nothing because they probably stayed opposite to you, give it a shock.
---
Lost a survivor in jungle gym? Choose one direction and shock. If you fail that‚Äôs ok, follow scratchmarks if they‚Äôre still around or go find another survivor.
---
A specific survivor the master of generators? Shock them relentlessly instead of attacking them, it hinders their abilities to only allow them to run away until thy complete a new objective (removing their insanity)
---
It's not buggy. It works like Billy chainsaw. The killer hit registration does not last an "eternity". If a survivor zigzag and is not in the hit box at the exact same moment you lougne it's not a hit and it's normal.

---
Another survivor main jumps in to shut down this talk of slowing the game down... WHILE COMPLETELY IGNORING THE FACT THAT YOU NEED RUIN TO SLOW THE GAME DOWN. Do you not see that? Do you not recognize that as being a problem, sir? Maybe you should think before writing?
---
"Clown is really good at the chase" WTF are you talking about? The OP isn't saying to remove loops or pallets. Clown can be looped just like everyone that isn't Spirit/Nurse and maybe Freddy/Hag/Trapper. "Clown is a beast at chasing." That just made me laugh because of the stupidity of that comment, thanks for that. 
---
Obviously if secondary objectives are introduced and killers no longer NEED to equip Ruin or an equivalent it would go hand-in-hand to nerf the Nurse and perks that affect gens. That would be fine. This isn't rocket science, bud.
---
He should always roar after a lunge. Just make it angery for when you miss.

Sounds cool. I like it.

It could work on an engineer/gremlin killer.

I don't like him because I think he is a manipulative liar. I say that because of the few incidents he had had with this game, like with the legacy hacking and such. He wanted to cry to his fans that he was banned and didn't know why when he knew exactly why and he just used his fanbase to slam the devs with that "free no0b3" b's.

Wait for the demogorgon, I've head he is pretty good and fun to use.

thats understandable, i would be disappointed to not have any of the losers club but just picking a couple would be even more disappointing. as for the map idea, i think it would work really well
---
No it is buggy  I see survivors get directly hit not even zigzagging and not get injured. It's definitely buggy currently if you look at gameplay because I see demogorgons lunge reach the survivor and miss
---
They could add it as a base perk for all killers. I don‚Äôt know if they will ever do that though.
---
Upvoted for not being another irritating "shirtless daddy Myers" request. This is actually a solid cosmetic idea that I think we could reasonably get.
---
No like actually do tho, last year of what, highschool?
---
If I'm chasing someone at a crap loop, then I let them go. If I'm in pallet town, I'll take a few free pallet breaks, and cycle out if things continue. If someone is just better than me at running a loop, then I'll find someone else. Hopefully I can get an M1 in somewhere so they'll need to go heal, but part of the time management aspect is to know when to drop chase.

For me, if I'm not seeing anything promising in 15 seconds, I start considering other options. If by 20 seconds things haven't changed, I'm out. I need to keep the pressure on the three other survivors, because if they're not hooked, healing, or saving someone, they're doing gens. 20 seconds on a gen is 1/4th of the gen. Not pressuring the other survivors also means their Exhaustion cooldowns could give them Dead Hard or Balanced Landing again.
---
Sometimes you just need to keep them busy if you can't hook them. It's why perks like Discordance are so good. You find at least two people and all of a sudden they are doing nothing.
---
I think an scp themed dlc would be pretty fun
---
It's highschool all right.
---
reread until you understand.
---
theres no one vid of it but he has like three screams when getting hooked and one sounds exactly like the meme
---
Yes, please! I‚Äôd buy that skin ASAP!
---
Ptb players walk so that us console players can run.....until bloodlust kicks in and the frames drop üòÇ
---
Noobs who doesn't know how to play against Spirit will not understand your comment.
---
a couple months or so, I found it on my gallery and felt like submitting it
---
Hail to the King, baby!
---
calm down, go buy some brain cells, rethink about all that and come back.
---
Ew survivors
---
ohhhhhhh lol idk
---
I'll swallow your soul!
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna count to 3, that shit better be deleted‚Äù
---
Naw Ash is just a big dicked badass
---
If you are truly playing this for fun, say gg in the chat and leave IMMEDIATELY! Don't engage with them. It's not worth it. Also, try playing at a different time of day or week. It seems to matter sometimes.
---
What about switching Spine Chill with Safe Care?
---
I was completely oblivious to the fact it was a swf until I read your comment, considering it was a swf, its pretty bullshit. I probably would have just dodged if I saw them all join at once with mutliple medkits
---
&gt;PERKS:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;meh im lazy.
---
And like that you've lost me.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, without the add on, the perk isn‚Äôt particulary good
---
Speaking of the movie, is it any good?
---
Made a lego entity
---
You have  1000000% chance to go to the map that you burned the offering for
---
Because you can‚Äôt see blood while phasing (without the add on)
---
I did but I'm saying the survivors still don't get hit even if they don't dodge and clearly in the hitbox. Now that you edited it I. Agree now you're right I guess
---
Get someone licensed if you're going to spend irl money. You can always get spirit with shards.
---
Predator is for scratch marks, blood hound is for blood
---
Right in the Stranger thing.
---
Again, fuckface can't dispute what I said so tries to derail and tell me to calm down. Go fuck yourself.
---
Seems like something Ash would do
---
Self promotion rule buddy
---
Not the hero we need, but the hero we deserve.
---
but this post doesn't have anything to do with this game, this would be the right sub r/StrangerThingsMemes
---
I had a Rank 16 and 3 Purples going against me last night and it was a total massacre. Weird part is that I‚Äôm Rank 11, and judging by their lack of coordination, this was just a random collection of survivors.
---
Where is your entity now?
---
You forgot the shitpost flair
---
It's way better than I anticipated.
---
The only main issue I had  is that some stuff in the middle seems to drag on.
---
Big mood
---
its alright
---
Ah ok. I only ask because I‚Äôm not a big fan of the series, but I heard it‚Äôs good.
---
Now do the Pyro fall into water "So guys we did it"
---
Who's shittin in the tall grass?
---
Mods would kill me if I did 3
---
True hardship right there. Unless the survivors are open books, then it ain't so bad.
---
What is the point of scared famous lmao
---
Sorry i got confused with blood hound
---
Pebble
---
That sucks, and no, im nog in the ptb. I hope they fix it soon, because this is quite an unwanted feature.
---
It's one thing to post your entire stream or full youtube video's ... this is just a clip.
---
"You were camping me while i was on the hook" when you were literally at the other end of the map. There you go ;)
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, if you leave through the exit gate but your trap is active, it will kill you, so you have to either escape by hatch or get it off first.
---
What an absolute "Clown" eh get it eh
---
Oh ok. Predator is the scratch mark perk not blood pools
---
Singleplayer would be great. But I am saying if someone DCs, a bot would be better than nothing.
---
The problem is that the TCM franchise is spread out over multiple studios. 
---
The original is independent. Hence, they licensed Leatherface from this movie and the skin is based on this one (and probably the #1 reason why we're getting the Pretty Woman skin which I don't mind at all.)
---
2nd movie was Cannon films and then absorbed by MGM 
---
3rd movie was New Line Cinema and then absorbed by Warner Brothers.
---
4th movie (Next Generation) is independent. But it's dog shit so we'll move on.
---
Remake and Prequel to that remake (The Beginning) are still owned by New Line/Warner Brothers.
---
Then you have Chainsaw 3D and Leatherface (not to be confused with part 3) which is owned by Lionsgate. 
---
The franchise became independent again after the latest film came and went. Behavior has a relationship with Lionsgate since Lionsgate owns Saw and added more costumes to the Pig so there's a chance we could get something from Chainsaw 3D and Leatherface (2017).
---
To know when you're in danger
---
If you try to leave while the traps ticking it rips your face open killing your character
---
So you posted a picture of you being salty and messaging the Killer.
---
r/emojipolice
---
Not with the slight ones, you don't.
---
but you need the toolbox :x
---
Don't know how you made it but it looks really cool. It'd be nice if they had loading screen pictures like this of all the different killers.
---
Well if you want specifics, there's plenty of profanities, 'kys's, and general talking down to other players happening on both sides, from what I've seen. But that's not the limit of it. What an individual might consider toxic is somewhat subjective, but I doubt anyone has never seen *something* that they themselves would consider toxic.
---
Yeah but just because a killer is close it doesn't mean he or she has seen you. So this perk is the one putting you in danger
---
If the trap is ticking you can‚Äôt leave. If it‚Äôs inactive meaning it‚Äôs not ticking and the circle around your name isn‚Äôt red, then you can leave
---
Well he was using the trapper and camped so think about it
---
Yeah you do. Do your research rank 20 noob.
---
My friends are like this in SWF as well and I always yell at them because not only are they embarrassing themselves they are embarrassing me because the killers usually know when it‚Äôs SWF... it‚Äôs so much more cringe if they message when the killer gets 2k+ and I‚Äôm just like
---
Bruh...why? You died...
---
[Here's your research, soy boy](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Offerings#Realm_Selections).
---
Since I was with trouble by recording it on PTB (I'm inexperienced, fps problems and the media player would't do its job), I recorded The King's video and put my idea over.
---
The footage used (The King's video) can be found [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19-zECsPvjw)
---
Idk why but just a regular base scream when he's eating the survivor's head doesn't fit well, so I made this
---
Man you‚Äôre flamey.
---
dfadfadfsdfsfsaadsfs he doesnt like it
---
Do you also know how to use hand gestures (e.g. pointing) using PS4, or if that‚Äôs exclusive to PC?
---
Friendo?
---
Also I always thought the Entity took people that entered one of it's locations or that were on the brink of death.
---
Meyers is easy, strong, and fun. 
---
Or buy spirit to unlock spirit fury. Most of the killers are too frustrating to play without enduring spirit fury
---
If the killer doesn't play toxic why should I text him

Why would you say something so controversial yet brave?

You and the team had a key, I‚Äôm glad the killer got a kill or two out of it.

I'd body blocking gets you tilted like that, I suggest running mad grit. Turns body blocking from being a source of frustration into a source of hilarious entertainment

---
So you killed a ttv? so what? what makes you think they are gonna stop playing the game?
---
I just hope they give us an 2x bloodpoint event too, because leveling 3 characters to level 50 with just the normal bloodpoint gain and my saved up 1.000.000 points is going to be a pain in the ass without it
---
It's also the same for me before this update came. I live in SEA so i thought the release of dedicated server is gonna be the end of SEA region. Fortunately, it goes beyond my expectation. 10+ games and not a single red ping to be found, while 2-3 yellow pings and the rest is well below 60.
---
Yes please!!!
---
For the streamer then? Whats the beef with streamers? I never really understood it.
---
i‚Äôll try it out i never thought of it since it doesn‚Äôt happen often and i like my set up on GF right now but i‚Äôll give it a try sometime. Just annoying that i get screamed at for being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù while they‚Äôre preventing me from doing what i‚Äôm supposed to be doing

I read this in Ron Howard‚Äôs voice, Arrested development style
---
Aww you
---
Don‚Äôt really get the downvotes but okay lol
---
Billy is anything but simple. Leatherface is easy. Trapper is easy and hard af at the same time. Hard because you have to know the maps, the general routing they take when looping, and knowing the best spots to place traps. Wraith is pretty easy.
---
Billy tips:
---
Get right up to their back and then rev the saw. A decent survivor isn't going to run in a straight line as you charge at them with the saw.
---
Bind turning left and right with the camera to Q and E. Congrats, now you don't need turn add-ons. Use Q and E to turn as you navigate the map, you use the mouse to aim as you chainsaw a survivor. 
---
You have to understand loops and pallets. Zubat's Billy is a very good introduction to knowing when to rev the saw at loop spots. 
---
When you're on a survivor's back and revving they can 360 and do crazy movement. You're best bet is to either follow them with your mouse or back off, move backwards while revving and keep them in your sight and then nail them with the saw. 
---
You can also bait them at pallets. If they throw it down, you can rev to 99% and make them think you'll break it as they take off.
---
Cool?
---
I was watching an Ace run round an afk Doctor, then I noticed the killer was slowly beginning to turn around. Ace only just made it...
---
I guess that makes sense, but I don‚Äôt want to bring those perks in the case that the killer is gonna be that one killer.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs weird, you didn‚Äôt even say anything contentious
---
Oh shut the fuck up we will continue to ask maybe the devs will hurry the hell up with this damn event

---
Yo, you should make shirtless Myers.

"farm this foot dweeb" lmao
---
we all know that, but what is concerning me is why are players using them together like... are they aware that only one can be used? do they read the perks' description?
---
i would've understood if it was Lithe with DH 'cause you could choose which one to use if you want to be prepared in every situation but Sprint Burst?

Spirit fury. Brutal strength isn‚Äôt good enough to ever be used over spirit, and if with all 3, you‚Äôre wasting a slot for something more useful

Thank you all for the great answers, very helpful. Didn't even think of headphones to hear well, great idea. I picked up a pair on the way home. Also thanks for the links, they've been very helpful. Hopefully I can make some friends in game to play with.
---
Just don‚Äôt let it bother you, everyone gets a comment bombed every once in a while
---
Woah you don't talk about big dick energy when talking about canadians you'll summon "them" but the other part is true
---
All we can do is pass the message along. If they don't listen, it's their choice. 
---
But if enough people preach the same thing to them, maybe they will realise.
---
All of those suck rat ass tho and i doubt its a good idea for a killer to only be countered with perks instead of ingame mechanics (look at Spirit everyone complains about her debatable counterplay)
---
That happened in this match he started chasing us after this and we nearly didn't escape.

Oh yea no I‚Äôm good, got nothing but love for my DbD players
---
Yep.  Today, I woke up and thought, "I'm finally going to play the final fantasy 8 remake that I bought a few days ago."
---
I proceeded to inmediately make some coffee and start up DBD.
---
Why leave when you can just run Bond and sand bag them?
---
Yea maybe, cause even if you do a pure sabo build it‚Äôs not all that useful. It‚Äôs good for anti tunnel to a limit, and slows down the killers game if they keep chasing you, but also all that time you‚Äôre not doing gens. Unless you 99 every hook and are constantly close to where the killer downs someone but good luck with that. That‚Äôs also the reason I think seeing all hooks all the time would be kind of op. If you can see every hook you can 99 all of them and run empathy to always be there. Though I guess you could just do that with a map anyway, so maybe it‚Äôs pretty balanced already?
---
Reasons not to take a joke seriously:
---
1. It‚Äôs a joke.

2. There‚Äôs literally no point in arguing with a joke.

haha so funny totally not overused and stale

i swear this shit happens almost every damn time when i'm playing survivor
---
but i can reveal him by mistake just by looking randomly around me when he's like 60m away
---
anyway, your own character model obstructs the process, you have to make sure you're not in the way, it's absurd
---
U can't knock him out of stalking while he's leaning around a corner also he stalks faster while leaning
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury are garbage on her because you‚Äôre never eating pallets. Overcharge is just a bad perk in general, dk why you‚Äôd recommend it.
---
&gt;As a killer main, there's nothing more frustrating than being looped a million times while gens pop left and right and suddenly you've done nothing the entire game.
---
That's your problem right there. You need to not let any player take you out of your game. And know when to break off a chase and either go for the weaker player or protect your gens.
---
People are shitty. I like to just respond like REAL POSITIVE because you can tell it pisses them off when you don't let it bother you. Just think how funny it is to be such a sad, sad little person that a video game makes you upset enough to be a prick to a complete stranger.

---
Those are just perks u could rub if you get them and have nothing else. Is it most optimal? No not really but even still these are great perks in general and they do help.
---
Not if you're a solo survivor.
---
Just look at some high Def shots online and practice on paper first. Or just paint and redo til you get it right
---
&gt; survivors cant really stop killers playing the game in the same way killers can bodyblock, facecamp and tunnel.
---
SWF certainly can.
---
Enjoy your 4 flashlights and offerings that move the hooks further away.
---
Bodyblocking killers doesn't really do anything - I'd argue bodyblocking is stronger for survivors. I've saved far more people bodyblocking hooks than I have bodyblocked as a killer.

New survivor item

I mean... u dont need the perk, the perk makes it easier, but if u find teammates, u got snapped out of it while doing the objetive
---
I dont understand what you just said
---
So, when's the event?
---
it is if you have bond
---
* Rule 1: Uncivil behaviour
---
Just take bond
---
Nah you did more than that.
---
Yeah except the teammate might be the killer and theres no way to know until its too late
---
In a way they don't but in a way they do, specially since a lot of unrealistic things already happen in the game, after all it is everything the entity wants to be.
---
and well, they punish hard things like camping or farming and make tunneling harder.
---
Depends if they report you. Not everyone is super salty and reports.
---
Isn‚Äòt there one on Yakamura estate near the main building

---

---
Yeah me too tbh
---
Oh I guess I got lucky
---
But then another one pops up the moment you finish the first one
---
Technically, every ghostface is just some random dude in a costume
---
Who needs Billys space program when Amanda has her own :D
---
I think that if you haven‚Äôt already, you need to level him up and get the borrowed time teachable to have it show up in bloodwebs now.
---
Last time I checked Ace's perks aren't extremely situational but alright
---
Yeah, the shoulder buttons would work too.  I get that fast presses are supposed to mimic a struggle, but there's not really any urgency in wiggling since hooks are so plentiful and really you're just hoping the killer gets delayed for some reason.  It's not like you're actually in a fair fight where your input matters, so it's a kind of facsimile of urgency.
---
I think I'll just accept for now I don't wiggle and try to focus on the other parts of the game.
---
That's what I was thinking but after Bill came out, I still had Borrowed Time on my Adam until I reset him.
---
Yes, when Bill was introduced to console his perks were removed from the generic perk pool, and they were made into teachable perks instead, you‚Äôll have to level him to level 40 to unlock the perks again, unless you get them from the shrine of secrets.
---
And a little side note, the icons where also changed to reflect the fact they are bills perks, instead of some random bald dude on unbreakable it‚Äôs now Bill.
---
Yeah, it all depends on the person you said hate mail to. Sony doesn't just ban you for saying bad words. You have to be reported. You just have to message someone and be unsportsman like and they'll get you for harassment.
---
The halloween blight kankers were good for slowing down the game. And the rewards for it were amazing bloodpoints

Nurse and Doctor are getting add-on passes and bug fixes. As for base kit changes, Doctor is likely getting buffed. I heard that the devs like the way he plays right now, so a rework is probably out of the cards for now. Nurse might receive a nerf but I‚Äôm not 100% sure about that.
---
We don‚Äôt know when they are being looked at or how they will be changed.
---
australian dead by daylight
---
I start playing my Dwight again after prestiging him and I just use bond and sometimes a med kit. I'm not gonna waste 32 seconds and a perk slot to heal myself.
---
Is it not worth it then ? I thought it would work as no one in high ranks cleanses themselves, so thana would put in work.
---
yeaa, like the movies!!! thats his power!
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
I finally got Adept Trapper the other day. It takes a lot of stupid survivors and maybe some basement cheese. Cheers Lad
---
Ive never seen a political name on Dead by Daylight. This is a first lol.
---
The Toymaker character I made this perk for (you can probably find it on my profile), was a gifted mechanic and inventor, so I figured a perk like that would make sense for him.
---
Problem is that thana's debuff is miniscule. Doesn't help too much cause it hardly slows down the game even with all 4 injured
---
Pig is amazing
---
Ur wlcm uwu
---
Honestly if I were you I‚Äôd just spend the blood points to teach borrowed time and then save for the next chapter. Most likely there‚Äôs still a week or two until the chapter gets released on console so getting the perk and then saving up to 1 mil beforehand isn‚Äôt impossible. Your choice ultimately tho
---
It's like, statistically speaking the odds are in my favour, but fuck me.
---
If I had that be the effect of Hex: Fatal Contraption, I would probably have to alter it to effecting all survivors, and maybe make it usable only 2-3 times per game. An interesting concept, though. I might build on that someday in a later post (I‚Äôll give you credit if I do, don‚Äôt worry!)
---

---
Thanks, I'll try it.  Maybe I just missed the check a couple times and mistakenly thought rotating didn't work well.  I still hope it gets changed, but maybe this will let me use the mechanic on occasion 'til then.
---
I would get the new left behind as well, if your the last one a lot and have a key, that‚Äôs a free escape.
---
OMG that Trapper &lt;3
---
No Mither players be like
---
So much cringe 
---
Just do the paper plate legion and be done with it.
---
Trapper looks so small lol
---
Haha sounds good. I could see it where maybe you can only do one or two gens at one time, and 3 or 4 max for the game. It would be a really strong perk even if it was only on skill check fails. You are injured AND you alter the killer of your location.
---
i mean exactly, people at high ranks only play Spirit, Billy and Nurse, they are the only killers that can deal with the genrush against a good team. It would be exactly the same on survivor - whichever survivor was the best at speeding the gens up or the game in general would be the best by far and unless another survivor had an amazing other ability. Nobody would compare.
---
This also makes licensed characters pay 2 win, especially if they had a good ability, but the same could be said about licensed killers.
---
Might use some of these in the future  :)
---
Lol I've been through that before, you ain't alone fam.
---
Oh ok
---
All of sudden I'm on a hook...
---
Well I mean still a high IQ prediction if one of them dies like that
---
Honestly, I understand how you feel. I played a Trapper game last night and I‚Äôm not red rank killer, I‚Äôm a survivor main, and I got paired with rank 1s at brown ranks. It was ridiculous.   I‚Äôm REALLY good with Spirit but I can‚Äôt play anyone else it seems (other then Michael and Freddy) 
---
My advice, turn off messages just while you‚Äôre learning. 9 out of 10 times messages are usually disrespectful. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to do that, just message ‚Äúgg‚Äù back and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm learning Spirit, thanks for being rude.‚Äù So they learn not to be complete assholes. I‚Äôll make people feel guilty if they‚Äôre booling me haha
---
Why not both ;)
---
Can you explain why you think it's cringe?
---
I just added something bad that a salty survivor would say about the wraith so the bing bong boi mains dont feel left out :)
---
I had this same situation happen to only I kept leveling Feng over and over with no BT showing up and my airhead couldn‚Äôt figure it out, it was in the patch notes have to read them each update you never know what‚Äôs going to change.
---
I managed to get the BT teach with Bill at 35 so not bad now I have that out of the way
---
I just find it strange how when I, or some others do it, it‚Äôs instantly removed for being unrelated despite it clearly being related in the title and you could even correlate it to DBD without having to insert anything in. Yet an image like this that has no relation to DBD whatsoever gets the pass.
---
so i take it you got the adept? lol.
---
Ahh ok I get you.
---
Killers who camp when gate are not open may as well look at the wall because it's the same thing.
---
I know on Xbox you at least gotta say a swear word.

Just a few minutes ago I was playing ghost face and I had just hooked one survivor and 4 gens had already been done. It really felt like the match had started 5 minutes ago too. It kinda sucks :/

thats awesome work &lt;3 Thank you!

Why would you leave?
---
You can still hit the skill check off of the gen.
---
Maybe they should decrease her turning speed after blink. Like billy chainsaw when he is running with it. So the nurse have to blink at survivors back then swing her wep with this way she cant do a 180 degree shot. So you have a way to counter her. When you go through her while she is blinking there is no way to hit you.
---
I think I saw you there! It looked fantastic!

You‚Äôre conveniently leaving out that killers have equally powerful things they can do. Run putrid oak and iron grip then.  Run ebony mori. Lots of things you can do too.

While, yeah you can use any Ace perk in any game, they either suck so much ass (Up the Ante) or must be ran with another perk to justify using them at all (AitH/Plunderer's or Open-Handed/Bond).
---
Meanwhile, Ash perks, with the exception of Flip-Flop, have seriously limited uses but have very good effects. Buckle Up reveals the killer to both of you when you pick someone up. Then MoM gives the extra health state. 
---
The protection hits are wonky sure, but if you body-block the killer when they're carrying someone, you'll never have an issue getting protection hits. If I'm running MoM, I just do that, and have yet to run into an instance where I don't get the free health state.

Then either you're hacker or a fucking GOD cause I've bodyblocked tons killers carrying Survivors, took a hit got a stack, then instahealed then took another hit but didn't get a stack. And that's the case for most people from what I've read and heard. Most of the time you just end up killing yourself before you can get all three cause of how inconsistent protection hits are
---
literally happened to me for the first time a few hours ago. dude was deadass just staring at me for 3 whole gens

The year 4 video from the devs
---
2:36
---
This is so damn true. When you can see the killer is trying really hard, or facecamps bit fails. When all escape they always feel the need to say "thanks for the daily" even when noone is saying anything. Like, they are lying to themselves cuz they can't admit they got destroyed. It's hurting their ego to much, but at the same time they don't want to look like a noob in front of the survivors. 
---
It's funny. It's really funny.

Doesn't healing imply getting better? Because that car looks like she's been on a meth bender since the movie fell out of vogue. Had a mid-life crisis paint job and everything.

---
I would just get him to 35 unless you want unbreakable. 30 you get left behind, which is getting a huge buff, 35 nets you borrowed.
---
I think your problem is that you're trying to get stacks too quickly. Taking a hit, instahealing, and taking a hit probably doesn't register the 2nd stack because of how fast you're trying to farm them.
---
Tragic, but deeply amusing to see someone RIP into their teammate's shoulder because they got startled while healing.
---
If I could get one of those in me I'd be in heaven
---
Maybe but still is that not me protecting my teammate? Should I not be rewarded?

Wow. Say something bad about a Mori, you‚Äôre a god damn hero. Say something bad about a key, and you get downvoted. This community is dumb
---
Ah yes bull dogs
---
It's a double standard IMO.
---
DS broke the game for two years, but they waited for years to fix it because they didn't have the perfect solution yet and didn't want to leave the perk useless.
---
Meanwhile, Legion is was comparable in annoyance to DS (if not in strength), and they just break every bone in his body with the nerf bat. No consideration for how to make him healthier, they just took every possible vestige of usefulness in Feral Frenzy and wiped it out.
---
Like, old Legion *definitely* needed a rework, but this isn't a rework.
---
They released Legion, got our money, and then removed him from the game.
---
It's not just the outfits. It's the entire look of the characters. The DLC content leaked/ announced is definitely later seasons.
---
I wish they'd use the cosmetic banners

This is most definitely a shitpost, but that NOED change is actually kinda.. decent? It‚Äôs a nerf but it no longer rewards killers who play like ass.

oh that makes sense body blocking for survivors isn‚Äôt toxic but if a killer does it everyone would be throwing a fit. Great logic.
---
Assassins??
---
really the only advice I can give is don't try new killers until rank reset. if your uncomfortable on a killer you haven't played then wait until you can play against people that will be around your skill level with that specific killer. it'll make moving into high rank play easier with her. unfortunately I think this community is too deep into the dumpster to ever come back from the toxicity
---
Legion i think
---
Lol. Those r the same type of people that say that using both pink add ons are easy on myers.
---
You can hit the survivors, they can‚Äôt do anything if they‚Äôre body blocked in a room? Sure it‚Äôs annoying, but if you‚Äôre losing multiple hooks to it in the same game.. you need to adjust man.

---
idk why you using assasin instead of killer but ok
---
Killers typically camp because of one of these reasons
---
1. They were gen rushed and the time it took to down one survivor 2 or 3 gens were done.
---
2. They bad at the game
---
3. Boosted fucks
---
4. Trash people
---
5. They new and think that they have to wait next to the survivor until he dies

Lol that's why they lost. Sense made.

That‚Äôs a shame, thank you anyway, so monitor doesn‚Äôt work either ?
---
Flip it around though, Nancy looks way different whereas steve looks PERFECT, like actually perfect, I don't think he could look much better.
---
I believe you mean "The game" and yes it is a killer favored map
---
(Tip: most generators on that map are on the first floor)
---
Console makes you press the button all the way in.

Your just seeing the cooldown phase of her power. She explodes and then runs someone over in a fiery mess. The cooldown gauge is visually represented with the look of the car.

You yourself aren't intentionally attempting to portray the players negatively, but others may not see it that way. The post has been removed. Just keep this in mind for future reference. Our rules are fine as they are- since it should be common sense not to show names at all.
---
I read the lil bit spicy in that guys voice. Honestly it's super hard to use them both I dont know why people complain. Maybe purple tombstone isnt but still. Also, locker is kryptonite to him like that.
---
There are seven generators on every map (when you're playing as a killer once rhere is only one generator left you can see three generators on the map). You were probably playing on "the game" which is a map from the Saw DLC. There are two levels so you have to look around more. Some doors only open after you've repaired a nearby generator so it's harder to spot them from a distance.
---
Best fan art I've seen yet!

no, it doesn't. It is still a terror radius affecting perk so

---
Step 2. Win
---
Yeah that makes sense, but I don't get the first part of that statement

&gt; but when you fully repair the generator

I don't get what this part is about.
---
Lol toxic moron.
---
I‚Äôm not an expert on it but that is a bubba. He‚Äôs already an asshole so I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him
---
idk honestly this happens to me way too much tho
---
uhhh. i think you need to re-read the perk buddy. it was an unfortunate frame error to have DS pop up last second, but the perk was null if you watch closer at the icons on the bottom right.
---
Not really I was trying to figure out how to use the new killer mostly so I had to kick gens to make sure I had enough time to do so I also bought hex ruin on level 1
---
Oh sorry for use assassin instead of killer, Im not english, In my lenguage its "assassin" not "killer"
---
Srry
---
Well I mean, good legion players are hard to find and no one else cares about the killer. Honestly the legion is just more of an annoyance than a threat as they will just slice you and then leave you alone
---
no. you also need to re watch? see how it goes black right when she fully picks him up? it was gone.
---

ye, my Mains are Zed and Evelynn tho sometimes I pick akali mid

It says it right there. It allows you to use the pig during the next trial.
---
Its in the description of the offering
---
You can play pig one time whit out perk
---
But ballerina Feng is epic
---
Ok thank you guys I was just confused I thought it meant that but I wasn‚Äôt sure
---
It basically gives you a "free trial" of a killer. If you equip it, regardless of what killer you're playing, for one match you'll be (this specific one says Pig) instead. It's a way BHVR lets people "try before you buy" for killers you don't actually own, and apparently getting one of these in your bloodweb is pretty rare.

W A T

He said ight I'm gonna head out at the end

Akali mid? You bad, bad man.
---
I don't know if it was intentional or not by the person that sculpted him, but I love lil baby Freddy haha
---
I get the joke but it's not about buffs or nerfs.  Hes just broken, it's inconsistent and that's why it's broken.
---
Allow you to take in the role of the pig in the next trial
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs just normal lag. When it‚Äôs lag switching you usually get hit when the killer is nowhere near you and you instantly teleport back to a place you already ran past.
---
I know the feeling, far too often Have I done a daily killer game where I decide to be nice and never hook anyone and if I down will chain drop from shoulder to get them back on feet only to have end game chat of "noob killer" or "ezgame"
